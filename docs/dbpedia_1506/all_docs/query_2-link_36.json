Countering this position was the difficult practical experience of Internal Revenue in accomplishing effective law enforcement. The bureau came to support a curative solution for addiction. Under its auspices, forty-four narcotic clinics were set up for the purpose of assisting gradual withdrawal, or providing maintenance' for addicts if necessary. Commissioner Daniel C. Roper praised the work of the clinics in his annual report for fiscal year 1918-19, but the bureau's next? report, subsequent to the Supreme Court decisions of 1919, condemned the clinics for \"pro- viding applicants with whatever drugs they required for the satis- faction of their morbicLappetites\" and applauded \"the wisdom of the policy being pursued. \"59 The fluctuating support for strict law enforcement, judicial deci- sions, and the complexity involved in actually reducing narcotic use help to explain in one sense why the nation's maintenance clinics never became more than a transitory experiment which had largely ended by July 1920. The Public Health Service and the AMA's Committee on Habit-Forming Drugs both lauded the clo- sure of the clinics.60 In another sense, the bureaucratic differences over narcotic law enforcement support conclusions in other studies concerned with the role of bureaucracies and institutions during the Progressive Era. Whatever its particular characteristics, the Narcotic Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Treasury Department, established in December 1919 after the passage of the Volstead Act, can be seen as representative of the organizational movement for efficient man- agement. Strict law enforcement therefore need not be seen as distinct from social reform. In this instance, as institutionalization in a penal rather than a therapeutic or curative facility for what was essentially a medical matter (although not universally recognized as such at the time) became a major organizational objective, humanitarian social reform lost its remaining importance. At this juncture, Kolb's depiction of addicts as psychopaths becomes indis- tinguishable from the reality of government policy.61 Interest- group administrative liberalism, as Theodore Lowi describes it, had replaced older, less administratively reliable ways of handling the socially unacceptable practice of narcotic consumption.\" - -- To implement antinarcotic policy, the Congress provided the Narcotic Division, under the direction of Levi G.

From 1916 to 1919, the number of known violators ranged from a low of 1,100 in 1917 to a high of 2,400 in 1919. There were 3,900 known violators in 1920, .an average of 10,300 in 1924-26, and ari average just below P9,000. for 1927-28. Of the 7,738 persons in federal prison at the end of the fiscal year 1928, nearly one-third, or 2,529, were imprisoned for Harrison law offenses. Daniel Roper believed that the drug ploblem in the United States was out of control by 1920. Terry and Penens concluded that enforcement practices induced higher lev- els of addiction, drug peddling, and associated criminal activity. Of America's addicts, the Special Committee observed, \"From infor- mation in the hands of the Committee, it is concluded that, while drug addicts may appear to be normal to the casual observer, they are usually weak in character, and lacking in moral sense.\"63 In many ways, the law and the evolving organizational structure through which it was administered had made the addict population of the United States into a social class not unlike that of Latin America, associated with extralegal, antisocial behavior. Official tolerance for drugs and related activity differed greatly. Moreover, the depiction of addicts in the United States as a coherent social class, useful for administrative purposes, did not reflect actual racial or socioeconomic conditions. There existed no distinct drug culture, no unified group similar to the Andean coqueros, the participants in rescates, or the rural poor, often Indians, who for generations had worked the land for the benefit of others. It was within the context of its emerging federal antinarcotic activity that the United States encouraged Latin American partici- pation in the larger, international campaign against narcotics. And it is from the perspective of the aspirations of officials in Washing- ton juxtaposed with the vastly different cultural history of Latin America that the success or failure of the narcotic foreign policy of the United States should be assessed. No Latin American country attended the Hague conference of 1911-12. At that meeting it became evident that the campaign against illicit drug traffic needed Latin American support to be effective.

Wright's letter pointed ? 4.. out that the conferees at The Hague realized the importance of S. Peruvian and Bolivian acceptance of the convention and concluded their business only after agreeing that the signature of the Con- vention by Latin Ainerican states was essential if the Convention was to become effective.\"65 The generally favorable response from Latin America pleased State Department officials, but Peru and Bolivia withheld adher- ence. Bolivia objected to the linking of coca with opitun in the convention and was reluctant to take any action threatening its coca - industry By the end of 1912, though, all Latin American countries except Peru indicated a willingness to sign the Hague Convention if they had not yet done so. Peru was undecided because of revenue derived from the coca trade and because of limited in- volvement in opium traffic, primarily within the Chinese popula- tion in Peru.66 In deliberations during the second conference at The Hague in July 1913, Great Britain and Germany reiterated an earlier concern that the 1912 convention would be, worthless regarding cocaine unless Peru signed. Peruvian reluctance was delaying ratification by several important narcotic manufacturing states. Before the conference adjourned, Peru promised to sign the convention, but the promise was made only after urgent appeals by the United States. The delay in depositing ratifications led to the convening of a third conference. The start was postponed from May until mid- June 1914 because officials in Washington were seeking Mexico's support at the meeting and hoped the delay might serve to lessen tension that arose between the two countries over the United States occupation of Veracruz earlier that year. With war on the horizon in Europe, the conference took place. By its final session. forty-four of forty-six nations had signed or pledged to sign the Hague Convention.

Through 1920 in Peru and Bolivia, adherence to the convention- tres did not signify its implementation. Both nations refused to jeopard- ., . ize their lucrative coca leaf operations.\" Only Mexico, of the Latin - CHAPTER 1 American countries crucial for control, tried in any way to restrict . drug-related activity. Early in 1916 the de facto government pro- : hibited opium importation. The following year President Venus- . ? ? ,g tiano Carranza sought to outlaw opium transactions in Baja ?!- California, but his own lack of control and the alleged complicity of the governor there in the trade (as discussed in chapter 2) nullified Carranza's efforts.\" These episodes presaged future difficulties that would impede antidrug activity throughout Latin America and cause concern in the United States. The overriding fear in Washington, then as later, was that illicit drugs produced in Latin America or shipped there from Europe or Asia would find their way to the United States. Compounding the matter, few Latin American states admit- ? ted the existence of a drug problem within their borders. With a rise in smuggling as a probable consequence of greater actions against drugs, concern in Washington over inadequate controls in Latin America was no doubt warranted. The legal-organizational process leading to the formation of a strict drug control program seems clear; just as apparent, conversely, is the cultural and eco- nomic background of Latin American inattention to controls in the early 1900s. The incongruity between the two would be further . revealed as the United States continued to press for more effective international controls on drug traffic. ; ? . . ? ?.? \" . - ??.?

In formulating a _ program of that nature, the League virtually assured United States participation in the latter conference, as NILT shall presently see:\" Latin American participation in the international movement fol- lowed an uncertain course as well in the early 1920s. Explanation - of this uncertainty can be found in the nature of the directives issuing from Geneva andin the unsettled domestic conditions then prevalent. In the first place the Opium Advisory Committee had unintentionally erred in transmitting questionnaires regarding cul- tivation, production, and manufacture only in French and English, the two official languages of the League. Replies reached Geneva belatedly, if at all. The use of Spanish, a goodwill gesture to countries largely unconcerned about drug control, might have improved the situation. The lack of substantive data in responses further underlined the differences in attitudes. Annual reports for 1921 came only from Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, and Venezuela; Bolivia sent a partial report.\" The import-export certificate system received even less attention. By the fifth session of the OAC only Mexico, not a member of the League, and Panama were experi- menting with the system; several other countries were considering doing so. As late as August 1925 only Cuba, Guatemala, and Haiti joined Mexico and Panama in using the certificates. Peru once contemplated adoption, but decided against doing so.\" In short, the administrative directives .of the League had little impact in Latin America. . Even more important, domestic conditions worked against the adoption of controls. Mexico, for example, was burdened with border difficulties and an increase in drug use by its own populace. Border conditions in the 1920s had not changed appreciably since the end of the revolutionary decade.47 Chihuahua, Sonora (one of the states most dramatically affected by the Revolution), and Baja California Norte continued to meet American demands for narcot- ics and oilier illicit pleasures. The situation in Baja stood as a. dubious legacy of the governorship of Esteban Cantu, 1915-20.\" While in office Cantti virtually set up an autonomous regime de- spite Carranza's efforts to the contrary.

Not surprisingly, numerous Americans, including some business interests in the West, preferred Canttl's control of Baja and the enjoyments found in Tijuana to the more restrictive, anti-American leadership of Venustiano Carranza in Mexico City.49 As in Tijuana, so, too, in Ciudad Juarez. To some observers the notoriety achieved there was truly appalling. -United States Consul John W. Dye remarked that \"Juarez is the most immoral, degen- erate, and utterly wicked platre I have ever seen or heard of in my travels. Murder and robbery are everyday occurrences and gam- bling, dope selling and using, drinking to excess and sexual vices are continuous. It is a Mecca for criminals and degenerates from both sides of the border.\" Said an American evangelist: \"I would rather shoot my son and throw his body in the river than have him spend an hour in the raging inferno of Juarez.\"5? Conditions in Juarez, exacerbated by continuing economic dependency upon El Paso and by the imposition in Texas of prohibition in 1918, sparked the inflammatory comments. The sentiments of Dye and the evangelist should not be viewed in isolation, but need to be seen in the context of the border's history since the Mexican War. In brief, a predisposition to illegal activity, including smuggling, emerged along the border soon after the war. Border areas are often regions of great opportunity. This potential took concrete form from the 1850s to the 1890s with the establishment on the Mexican side of a free zone for trade. Within the Zona Libre, whether through legal or illegal activity, standards of living were generally higher than in the interior, a result of considerable trade with the United States. Both this American orientation and discrimination in favor of the Zona ultimately aroused such strong domestic opposition that the Diaz government abolished the free zone. The resultant economic dislocation at Paso del Norte, the area encompassing Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, was particularly felt in the agricultural sector of the economy. To com- pensate for the socioeconomic travail of recession, Juarez turned to the tourist trade?a way of life even More dependent on the United States than existed with the Zona Libre.\" Tourism, of course, serves many masters; and tourism flourished during reform times in the _United States, notably during the era of _ , 45,1 ' ? ? - The Road to Geneva-- prohibition.

The rampant 'vice that Dye and Others decried re- . suited largely from .a demand being treated on the United States side of the border, the fulfillment of which had been forced to the Mexican side by social and legal Proscription. Illegal activity was - reciprocal. During the revolutionary decade, as Juarez wasacquir- ing its dissolute reputation; Americans were carrying on an illicit arms trade with various revolutionary factions in Mexico.52 Al- though Mexican needs from the contraband trade subsided as revolutionary violence abated, American demands?including _ ao- cess to narcotics?on the illegal border economy continued. Compdunding difficulties at the border for Mexico were domes- tic drug problems that President Alvaro Obregon and other federal officials could not readily bring under control. In February 1923 the governor of Yucatan, Felipe Carillo Puerto, issued a decree prohibiting trade in opiates, cocaine, and marijuana.53 Shortly thereafter, the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior called attention to the domestic use of narcotics. Demanding corrective action against alleged drug-induced violence by young Mexicans, the paper re- ported growing national concern about the spread of addiction. Excelsior charged that perhaps 90 percent of the addicts acquired their habit while in the nation's hospitals and sanitariums.\" The paper's campaign against narcotics elicited government response when in July Obregon prohibited by decree the importation of narcotics except for legitimate needs.55 The high incidence of smuggling and residual corruption of officials probably nullified the decree at the moment of its promulgation. The geographical and ideological configuration of forces during the Mexican Revolution restricted Obregem's authority as presi- _ dent.56 More-over, intern- al conditions reduced the likelihood of effective drug controls. That is to say, the Revolution put forth the intoxicating promise of democracy and socioeconomic change, as expressed in expanded political participation and agrarian reform. While such goals necessarily raise the level of expectation and aspirations of people in a revolutionary situation, fulfillment is a dismayingly more gradual process. As a result, established patterns of drug-related behavior persist even as changes occur. - ? - Although--Mexico's revolutionary? tribulations have been fre-- quently chronicled and analyzed, it seems worthwhile to recount them briefly, as indirect, though substantial, support for the pres- ent interpretation.

If the foregoing suggests that the Mexican Revolution, however factional and regional it may have been, experienced an early Thermidorean or reactionary phase, that conclusion should not obscure the essential complexity of the revolutionary process and the richness of its ultimate achievements. The Revolution brought Mexico economic growth, industrialization, and prepared the way for modernity. There continued at the same time, nevertheless, a concentration of wealth, but with a broader social base than prior to 1910. Instead of having a leveling effect, however, subsequent economic growth and urbanization, while expanding the middle class, sustained discernible class distinctions. There emerged at length what Peter H. Smith has termed \"a stable, authoritarian regime.?67 Limited political participation, social differentiation, and economic privilege for the few still characterize Mexican soci- ety long after the Revolution. On the surface the preceding analysis does little to alter the - traditional view of the rural Mexican, or campesino, a characteri- zation that finds the campesino to be scarcely more than a helpless, oppressed peon.68 At issue is not whether the Revolution suc- ceeded in changing the status of the campesino, for it inevitably did to some degree, but rather how campesinos may have acted during the Porfiriato to gain a measure of control over their own lives?so that we may revise our understanding of their role within _ society._ _ The emerging picture s-uggesis-a life-style of mutual adjustment and accommodation, especially in terms of service and the level of wages, in contrast to one of unbridled exploitation.

Before the Revolution the transition of the campesino out of peonage re- mained sadly incomplete. It was not unusual therefore to find him out of Work, dispossed,pf the land he shad.worked for another's- advantage. In the course of modernization of the work of the agricultural laborer to a form over which he exerted some control, a clash of values resulted?the impact of which ironically threat- ened the survival of his cultural heritage. The, demands of. an , increasingly market-oriented economy no doubt disrupted natural agricultural rhythms, often alienating the campesino from wage labor even when it was available.69 ? The scarcity of work, alienation, the threat of cultural change, and the promises of revolutionary caudillos combined to bring peones actively to the Revolution. In the south this meant joining with Zapata in a radical quest for land reform, consecrated, as it were, in the Plan de Ayala. For the Zapatistas, the Revolution was agrarian-based and political in nature, advancing a more coherent ideological position than evident elsewhere. The northern support- ers of the revolt against Victoriano Huerta, led by Carranza and Pancho Villa, were far less unified. Villa's revolt, described by John Womack, Jr., as \"more a force of nature than of politics,\" com- manded the allegiance of a diverse group of followers: dispossessed campesinos, cowboys, railroad workers, bandits, Yaqui Indians, and others. This congeries of social misfits and the downtrodden gave little organized support to the nationwide uprising. An effort to join with Zapata in opposition to Carranza and the Sonorans failed markedly.7? What the Villistas brought about, \"howeve-r, was their own brand of chaos in Chihuahua and parts of Sonora (for which they con- tended and lost)?a social anarchy whose impact was felt even after the revolutionary decade ended. Yet the Villistas could not ordain chaos in the north on their own. Social upheaval was generously abetted by economic dislocation, the result jointly of internal civil \\strife and international conflict. Nor were the actions of the Villistas as directionless as has been generally assumed, despite their being declared \"outside the ,law,\"-One of the principal examples of their alleged anarchy, the raid on Columbus, New Mexico, on March 9, 1916, may actually have been a rational if erroneous response by _ e Vi tween of that ficially Villa's raid c troubh, and ec, clear al had to Nun thoritiel ent, on; Yuma,. tian Tei; a dry z, petitioi ics, thel alent a situatic cernibl barely. preseno Atti tively the Qui stand ti PeruviE use cot largely succeec ites, it This Peru d lasting \"dictate of demo an expE class di nationa rlcfir in Part - Sanitized CODV Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25 : CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 ?

Domestic and international controls had to be made more effective. Numerous incidents occurred in the early 1920s providing au- thorities ample opportunity-to reiterate these sentiments. At pres- ent, one example will serve to make the larger point. Citizens from Yuma, Arizona, acting in conjunction with the local Women's Chris- tian Temperance Union, petitioned the State Department to set up a dry zone along the' border with Mexico. The practical effect, the petitioners argued, would be to halt the flow of liquor and narcot- ics, thereby containing the \"unbridled vice and debauchery\" prev- alent along the border.\" Attempts at control of this and similar situations met with scant success. Drugs continued to play a dis- cernible if veiled role in Mexican society. The Revolution had barely touched the foreign and domestic preconditions for their presence. At the same time, the situation in Peru presented a compara- tively clear picture, bound as it was to the observable culture of the Quechua and Aymara Indians. It is simpler therefore to under- stand the context in which drugs helped to shape the contours of Peruvian society. Primary, of course, was the presence of coca. Its use could not be eliminated, and scarcely reduced. Army officers, largely from the middle class, considered it an achievement if they succeeded in denying Indian conscripts their quid of coca. Urban- ites, it seems, smoked tobacco.\" This type of incident reveals much of the place of the Indian in Peru during el oncenio, the dictatorship of Augusto B. Leguia lasting from 1919 to 1930. Leguia, who disingenuously held that \"dictatorship is more popular than anarchy,\" imperiled the fortunes of democracy in Peru until his ouster. The fortunate coincidence of an expanding, supportive middle class and the impetus given that class during the First World War to participate more actively in national political life assisted. Leguia's rise to power in 1919. The -rre- SAP r _ASV_ Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 tt.

In 1923 the government issued a numbeJ. of decrees establishing a partial state monopoly over the commerce 6 in drugs.. By placing restrictions on imports of opium and cocaine, the government intended to limit usage to legitimate medical purposes.23 Concern, however, about drugs as a serious social . problem only arose five years later. The case of Uruguay raises an - important question with broad implications, If within a short pe- riod of time the nation changed from giving casual attention to drugs (the 1923 laws) to acute concern over their prevalence and ? misuse (the warnings of the National Health Council), how serious must the situation have been when drugs first received legislative _ response? As one official later Piit it, drug usage in 1923 had \"acquired the proportions of an actual plague.\"24 If this were true in Uruguay, what were actual conditions elsewhere in Latin Amer- ica? - Insufficient information leaves that question largely unanswered. Such is not quite the case with Mexico, however. The government there had equated increased drug usage with social problems since the early years of the decade, as the executive decrees of 192.3 and 1925 attest. Their promulgation had no discernible effect on a worsening situation. Marijuana continued to grow wild throughout the country and opium poppy cultivation flourished especially in northern states. The poppies were frequently processed into mor- phine and heroin. This indigenous crop, along with opiates smug- gled into Mexico from abroad, served both domestic addicts and 1 innumerable others in the United States. In a further attempt to control the situation, President Calles signed a decree late in 1927 94_ banning the export of heroin and marijuana.25 Two years later a revised penal code enumerated strict penalties for those persons found guilty of illegally growing or manufacturing drugs.26 ? Success in the Mexican effort depended, of course, upon effec- tive enforcement of the decrees. As before, congruence between intent and actual procedure seemed coincidental. For instance, Henry Damm, the United States consul at Nogales, reported the growing of large quantities of opium poppies in the region, yet Damm had no indication that local authorities were trying to halt cultivation. Similar reports reached the State Department from other consular districts in northern Mexico.\" ?

Inside the den many varieties of narcotics were available for sale and consumption on the premises; a special room was set aside for the smoking of opium. Upon Bohr's arrival the Chinese operators expressed suspicion. about his presence, -but Bofir's contact secured entry by buying a small amount of cocaine. The consul's report does not reveal whether he partook of the drug.\" This incident underlines the difficulty inherent in drug law enforcement for Mexican officials. _ _ In addition to internal narcotic problems, Mexican authoritig-' had to cope with the ubiquitous matter of smuggling. At Juarez and Nuevo Laredo, officials rarely confiscated more than a small per- centage of the quantifi of-drugs adiiinfedly_crossing_the b?order. Conditions in the Matamoros-Brownsville area resulted in a con- sular request for a special agent to investigate the illicit traffic there.\" The poor record of interception stemmed not_only_frona- Mexico's lie-tfifiger?Trs,and funds to patrol the border properly, but als-o-EC?n the absence of any cOo-peiative antismuggling effort with the-Mired ,States.\" Despite the difficulties they faced, upper echelon leaders in Mexico seemingly possessed antidrug sentiments similar to those held in the United States. Neither side working alone, however, could achieve the results each desired. Yet the idea of a common effort had been considered earlier and abandoned, but for reasons not strictly pers,aining to drug control. The plan for cooperation evolved from tlie previously mentioned request in 1924 by a group of citizens in Yuma, Arizona for a dry zone along the border.31 Recognizing the unilateral nature of the dry zone proposal, State Department officials instead issued an invitation to Mexico to join in a conference to create channels for improving information ex- change on illegal drug activity. All border consuls were instructed to attend the meeting in El Paso scheduled for May 1925.32 Against a backdrop that portended further smuggling at Ciudad Juarez and depicted Ensenada in Baja California as \"an entrepot of some [considerable] quantity of narcotics,\"33 the two sides quickly reached an agreement. Both pledged regular exchange of informa- tion on known smugglers and their activities. The pact took effect in March 1926.34 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 --1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25 : CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 ILLEGIB ? - ? ? 60 CHAPTER 3 The treaty was not an open-ended one, so as the conclusion of the initial year of its operation approached; the United States? notified Mexico of its intention to terminate the agreement. The decision resulted from an assessment by State Department officials of political and economic contitions within Mexico. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg e?cplained.theAlecision in a conversation, with. the British 'Ambassador Sir Esme Howard. Painting a picture of chaos and imminent disintegration of Mexican society, the secre- tary described a situation in which business activity was slowing -down and revenues decreasing. Kellogg feared that opposition to,,, Calles by \"radical Communists\" would prevent any corrective ac- tion. \"Mexico,''',, he-told Howard, \"[is] evidently on the brink of ancial collapse.\"35 In a postscript to the termination of the treaty, Consul Jon Dye in Juarez reacted to its lapse indifferently. He felt that the Mexican government had not seriously endeavored to enforce the accord.36 True, the task of transforming commitment into effective action often failed, producing understandable exasperation on the part of officials who were reminded daily of the large quantity of drugs moving northward. In April 1931, when a special Mexican agent arrived in the Juarez-El Paso area to assist the consul there, William Blocker remarked that \"the arrival of the narcotic agent. . . would indicate that the Mexican Government has at last decided to clean up the drug traffic on this section of the border.\"37 The vicissitudes associated with drug control activity throughout Latin America in the latter half of the 1920s prevented the United States from discrediting the work of the League of Nations at the 1928 Havana Conference.The___r_eneiging. -definition_of drug usage as a social problem was demonstrated more, by thmle.L.v goyem- IVIileh acted, ttirough acceptance...of the,..1925_Geneva ? vention than by sole adherence to the.1912 agieeas ate- United States desire& By the start of the meeting in Havana, Latin American nations including Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, Uru- guay, and Bolivia with reservations, had signed the Final Act of the 1925 convention; others were reportedly about to sign.

She offered few specific proposals except the vain hope that other nations' might be wiling to accept an amendment to the convention so it would not be,adopted in its present form. Johnson told Mrs. Wright that Porter and the Division of Far Eastern Affairs were studying the situation to determine what could be done.\" Caldwell and other officials realized that she was right in calling for a reassessment of policy. Johnson, though, remained skeptical; he saw no feasible way to revise Washington's policy toward the League. But Mrs. Wright interposed her ideas once again. In March she urged the secretary of state to formulate a policy reasserting United States leadership in the antinarcotic movement. This meant convening a new conference.4? Caldwell reversed his prior isolationist stance and supported the idea. He wanted the United States to ask for a conference, possibly for 1929, and then approach it with greater flexibility than had been the case in 1924-25. Johnson was not persuaded of the idea's merit. \"So far as I know,\" he told Caldwell, \"we have no program other than that which our delegation offered at Geneva in 1925, which was rejected and would be rejected again by the powers.\"\" That assessment seemed accurate, since, -by_ks_insistence on a program of limitation at the source, the United_States-strongly disc---ordagd?consideration of any other drug control scheme, - 4 cliiiminufa-cturing restricti9ns. American rigidity thus ob- ScTIFF-d the cultural, -financial, and political difficulties some countries had in accepting Washington's program wholesale.42 Renewed cooperation with the League was essential for effective drug control. If nothing else, the OAC provided an available forum in which pressure, however limited, could be brought to bear on producing and manufacturing nations. Such pressure might not have had sufficient influence if exerted through bilateral diplomatic channels.

He or she is the victim of a disease and should be placed where treatment can be given. You can't cure a sick person by sending that person to jail. \"76 That sentiment seemed to be anathema to the commissioner of narcotics in 1930, as his actions ? in office would soon reveal. ? Flexibility rather than rigidity marked the relationship of the United States with the international drug control movement at that time. During its January 1931 session the OAC, with Caldwell's active support, enlarged the list of narcotics that might become subject to manufacturing limitations at the May conference.77 In his instructions to the delegation Stimson told Caldwell and the other members (including Anslinger) not to oppose a convention \"which would be acceptable to other governments and unaccepta- ble to the United States . . . , provided it would seem likely to accomplish the desired restriction of manufacture.\" The secretary of state hoped that the United States would be able to accept any convention agreed upon.78 Prior to the opening of the Conference for the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs, Stimson also encouraged Latin American participation at Geneva. Some hesitancy about commit- ting themselves wholeheartedly to League-directed antinarcotic activity still existed, but over half the countries there sent repre- sentatives to the conference.\" In attendance were Argentina, Bo- livia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Ven- ezuela. Physical presence in Geneva did not ensure active partici- pation in the deliberations. Mexico, for instance, assisted in administrative procedures, but contributed little to the substantive discussions. This reluctance may seem anomalousmhen compared With her eputinuing domesticproblem with.drugs. Yet as Martinez de Alva explained for his government: :There [is] no problem of narcotic drugs in Mexico. Mexico produce[s] no raw material, [does] not manufacture narcotic drugs, [does] not export them and [does] not even consume them except for legitimate require- ments.-\"8?

' ? - 71 ' in the spirit of its revolution, was participating for the first time in a world narcotic conference and probably did not want to admit the existence of any blemishes on its antinarcotic record. ? Argentina, the only other Latin American nation to play a vocal role in the conference, naively became involved in the debate over manufacturing limitations. Its representative, Fernando Perez, i who had no constructive proposals to present, disiiiiiieTEIaire- m----e-rti -That overproduction and eTh7C?essiVe-Foicsiiinption of drugs had .. --a-dttetrilatioirs'hip. Perez told the assembled delegates in terms reminiscent of those heard years earlier in the United States: The spread of drug addiction and the development of the illicit drug traffic are not the effect of over-production, but are due to the moral perversion of the drug addicts and of the unscrupulous. traffickers who supply them with material for their vicious practices. This assessment of the motives behind drug usage led Argentina to support a proposal of the Soviet Union which, if adopted, would have expanded the scope of the conference to include a discussion about whether to place limits upon raw material cultivation.81 In more contentious times the United States would have ar- dently supported a similar drug control plan. To the credit of Caldwell and his superiors, the United States delegation did not have to labor under such restrictions in 1931. Instead Caldwell and Anslinger backed a Franco-Japanese proposal-based on the concept of in alien and .competitive..market..First,..each?government would submit to a central office..annuaLestimates.afiegitimate ,needs. Next, internal regulations would limit the supply of available nar- cotics 6-those requirements. Finally, the central office would have 1 the authority to regulate narcotic traffic as -a means of restricting i excessive exportatioq.82 If this plan had been adopted as com- posed, it would have ultimately resulted in limiting *e production of raw narcotic material. Because of objections, especially Germany's, to so comprehen- sive a plan, the scheme could not be adopted without modification. Agreement in principle was reached, however, on the need for strict supervision of the quantity of raw materials in the possession of each manufacturer.

Several nations, particularly Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia, began gradually to per- ceive drug usage as a social problem. Remedial action rarely al- tered existing conditions, however. On the other hand, Mexico and Uruguay employed legislative and administrative means to restrict drug commerce and usage. Yet even those efforts proved largely ineffective.

In the 1930s, the growth of the bureaucratic state there would contend with drug-related traditions for influ- ence over the direction of drug policy. The United States seemed the logical choice to lead the way toward greater hemispheric drug control, whether by example or direct diplomacy. A reconstructed bureaucracy and a revised narcotic foreign policy ostensibly pro- vided the example of sound management necessary for effective policy change.

Shortly after the convention went into effect in July 1933, the World Narcotic Defense Association celebrated. The association's leader, Capt. Richmond P. Hobson, a Spanish-American War veteran who had become an active campaigner for several organizations, deliv- ered a number of speeches praising the work of the Geneva confer- ence. In another tribute the Literary Digest heralded the implementation of the convention with an article entitled, \"End of the Illicit Drug Traffic Now in Sight.\"' Unfortunately, such euphoria was unwarranted. For nations steadfastly committed to the eradication of illicit drug commerce and usage, including the United States, the convention provided an additional tool to help in the fight. Nations with less systematic- programs, especially those in Latin America, were encouraged to reconsider the extent of their antidrug activities. In some cases more vigorous actions would be undertaken. For their part United States officials believed that the recent integration of foreign and domestic drug policies would mitigate some of the nation's drug problems. They miscalculated the complexity of the situation. ? In the early 1930s domestic addiction remained at a considerable level, a steady stream ? of illegal drugs, including marijuana and opium, continued to-flow north from- Mexico, and new problems ? appeared for policymakers as Central America and Colombia be- came important locales for, smuggling opiates and cocaine from \" .7V1 ? narlaccifipri in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 76 CHAPTER 4 Drug Control in the . ? . , Europe. These conditions plus a general inability to control illicit narcotic commerce by Latin American governments offered_ offi- cials in Washington scant hope for success in their endeavars. Conservative estimates provided by theFederal Bureau of Nar- cotics placed the number of addicts around 100,000 in 1926; six years later the official figure had increased by 20,000. This amounted to approximately one addict per one thousand people. - Testifying in 1930 on his bill creating the bureau, Stephen C. Porter stated that the most reliable estimates of addiction ranged from 200,000 to 1,000,000 addicts. Porter personally felt that the accurate number approached 400,000.2 If Porter's statistics exag- gerated the real extent of addiction, the government's figures underestimated it. The point is that addiction was probably not decreasing, despite the enforcement programs being carried out under the provisions of the Harrison Narcotic Law and its amend- ments. On the twentieth anniversary of the law's passage, an editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch termed it a failure which had only produced large-scale smuggling. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics denied the allegation asserting that addiction had de- creased during the two decades of the law's operation.3 Moreover, the continuing depiction of addicts as social deviants belied the faith officials placed in their capacity to reduce addic- tion. In 1932 Treasury Secretary Ogden L. Mills found addicts to be \"mentally defective and psychotic,\" easily given to the influ- ence of other addicts. Bureau Commissioner Anslinger doubted whether addicts could ever play a useful role in society. In remarks before the Attorney General's Conference on crime held in Wash- ington in December 1934, he commented that \"we understand that none of these addicts would have become habitu?had they possessed the mental stamina to resist the drug. The mere fact that they could not control their craving, and yielded time after time even when they knew from experience that they faced a jail sen- tence, is indisputable proof. . . that many of them will relapse to the ravages of the old habit and form underworld associates.\" To Anslinger, addicts were \"derelicts from a sinking ship.\"4 Only occasionally in the 1930s was there heard a dissent from such views. Dr. Walter L.

Treadway pointed out that addiction appeared in all social classes, although it remained more visible within the lower class. He also felt that a high level of recidivism did not so much lend support to the assertion that addiction was a function of a pathological personality. as it refuted the approach which 'sought to control drug usage primarily by punitive means.5 Since Treadway's views ran counter to the en- forcement patterns practiced by the Bureau of Narcotics, they did not obtain a large audience within the policy-making bureaucracy. At this time the major instance of an attempt to improve domes- tic controls came in the movement to adopt a uniform state narcotic law. Long before 1930 it became evident to officials that many states were defaulting to the federal government the task of enact- ing and enforcing adequate antidrug legislation. The Harrison law served not as a model for some state legislatures, but as an excuse not to pass complementary state laws.6 At its annual conference in October 1932 the National Conference of Commissioners on Uni- form State Laws accepted a draft proposal for a _uniform state. iI?otic act:Under the terms of the draft, no person could trade in drugs without specific authorization. The final version of the Uni- form State Narcotic Drug Act related primarily to the opiates and cocaine; marijuana was incidentally included under the general provisions of the act. The proposal also recommended the strict licensing of manufacturers and wholesalers. Hoping to create a receptive atmosphere, the Bureau of Narcotics prepared a number of articles about the need for the act. It is noteworthy that early in the government's campaign, the American Medical Association added its support for the adoption of the act. The rapid response throughout the nation pleased the bureau; by 1936 twenty-seven states had put the act into effect.7 The renovation of drug control policy did not proceed in a vacuum isolated from contemporary events. In fact, the economic exigencies brought on by the depression almost negated the metic- ulous work of the State Department and the young bureau. The problem appeared in the form of a proposed reorganization of various government agencies just as President Franklin D. Roose- velt's administration was settling into office. Among the contem- plated changes was the transfer of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General's office. Initiative for the change apparently came from the Bureau of the Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25 : CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 - 78 CHAPTER 4 Budget and its director, Lewis W. Douglas, who convinced the ? commissioner Of prohibition, A. V. Dalrymple, that the interchange of agents for narcotic and prohibition law enforcement would in- crease the operational efficiency of the bureaus being merged.8 --- Stuart J. Fuller, a narcotic expert speaking for the State Depart- . ment,?offered.tw. o *o'bjectiOn.' Firit, any change might contravene ? Article XV of the 1931 Geneva Convention which required each signatory to maintain a separate, central narcotics office. Further:- more, the proposal would probably place the enforcement of nar- cotic 4ws in a situation similar to that Which existed before the establishment of the Bureau of Narcotics. In a cover note on a memorandum to Undersecretary of State William Phillips on March 31, 1933, Fuller wrote, Our Narcotics Bureau has been held up at Geneva as a model one.\" Fuller therefore concluded that to: abolish the Bureau of Narcotics would be regarded as a dis- tinctly retrograde step and would discourage abroad the cen- tralization and coordination of foreign narcotics administration which the American Government has repeatedly urged.8 Fuller took his case both to the Justice Department and the prohibition chief. He informed Dalrymple that the 1931 conven- tion had been composed and signed on the insistence of the American Government.\" Any alteration in the policy structure would make it appear that the United States had reneged on its antidrug commitment, causing embarrassment for the State De- partment.1? Reports also reached Washington detailing concern by the Opium Advisory Committee over the proposed merger. Presi- dent Roosevelt finally ended all speculation when he told Phillips that there would be no merger or abolition of the bureau, espe- cially in view of the treaty obligations incurred in 1931.11 The defeat of the proposed merger underscores the bureaucratic skills at work in the management of national narcotic policy by Harry J. An slinger and his colleagues in the Department of State. After an early decrease in funding as a result of the depression, they were able to maintain appropriations for the Bureau of Narcotics at a relatively constant level throughout the depression, New Deal, and the years of the heavy fiscal demands generated by the Second World War.

With the end of the controversy over reorganization, drug policy could be 'looked upon almost as an entity unto itself?no longer subsumed within broader policy considerations as had been the case since 1914. By having to devote less time to obtaining support for their policy at home, drug officials were able to give more concerted attention to related problems abroad. As had been the case for some time, the situation in Mexico and its direct relationship to drugs smuggled into the United States required much of the energy officials in Washington were expend- ing in their effort to .improve the quality of control in the Americas. A crucial obstacle to their? goal arose out of the difficulties the Mexican government faced in handling its own drug situation. Usage apparently increased in the early 1930s. Marijuana smoking persisted, and heroin was found among the lower levels of society.12 Despite claims to the contrary by the government, the decrees of the 1920s had not really alleviated a deteriorating situa- tion. A report in the newspaper Excelsior on June 12, 1931 revealed the severity and extent of the situation. In a letter to the paper, the minister of government, Carlos Riva Palacio, announced his resig- nation, an action resulting from his alleged complicity in a smug- gling operation which was introducing illegal drugs into Mexico and then transporting them to the United States. 13 Plutarco Elias Calles, the most powerful man in Mexico and now ex-president, Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 , ^h- _ 4 Nr? ? t\"1.4;:i?Z\"Pd''.. ? ;?,-;?\"%e r- _ ????.?,- ? 4 ?k \"te, - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25 : CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 4-3 , 1 !

Mexico's financial condition, more precarious because of the depression, was worse than at any time since 1915. Credit was poor; gold and silver were in short supply. With the resignation of the head of the presidential staff, Calles's faith in the ability of Rubio Ortiz to govern effectively nearly evaporated. Fortunately for Mexico, the power and prestige of Calles held the government together. In August the crisis passed when Gen. Lazar? Cardenas, who would become president in 1934, accepted an appointment to Riva Palacio's former position.15 It is not clear that the appointment of Cardenas had a causal effect, but shortly thereafter the government undertook a reassess- ment of the operation of its drug control policies.

Whether the Mexican approach to drug control would prove any more successful than that advocated in Washington remained to be seen Despite the intentions Of the Cardenas. administration, it was - doubtful that the new' regulations had a discernible impact on the drug situation in areas distant from Mexico City. In April 1935 the United Press news wire carried a story from Geneva stating that a standing committee of the League of Nations, probably the OAC, named Mexico as a nation from which large quantities of drugs were being smuggled into the United States. It also noted that Mexican officials took part in the illicit activity. The government denied the allegations, putting the blame for smuggling instead on manufacturing nations with insufficient controls over exports. Whatever the level of official corruption and complicity, the gov- ernment's countercharges had a basis in reality. In Manchuria, British and Swiss interests were seeking to have the opium trade from Persia legalized: an increased trade would prove lucrative financially, particularly if the demand for narcotics could be artifi- cially stimulated in places other than China.19 Notwithstanding the denials, the level of smuggling from Mexico remained high.19 Based upon _i_Les_orLiallie....early-1930sr-the-govermnent.in _t_q7 a eat_,,np.,..,_.10.y___illing19...act_with?the...DattriAtack.t.o-stgp smuggling.

Around 1930 private planes began smuggling drugs out of Mexico. In response, an antidrug air patrol operated from various . sites in Texas starting in 1931. During the first two years of the --- program no drugs were seized, only liquor. Yet authorities re- mained' Convinced that 'smuggling by air Was a. Prime means. of ? '4* getting drugs into the United States.24 In addition to west Texas, Baja California continued to serve as a prominent locale for smuggling. The consul at Ensenada, William ? Smale, suggested that the State Department pressure Mexican authorities to act by taking steps \"which would reduce to a mini- mum the travg and expenditures of American tourists in Baja California. . \"25 Not until Operation Intercept thirty-five years later would the United States try, ih a comparable situation, to take the action Smale suggested. In place of economic pressure, a meeting was held on October 10, 1934 in Los Angeles to dissemi- nate information on smuggling to representatives from the state, treasury, labor, and justice departments. The need for the meeting became evident after the district supervisor of the Bureau of Nar- cotics in San Francisco stated that he saw no reason to believe anything other than liquor was being smuggled into the United States.26 Such ignorance of the actual situation was unacceptable in An- slinger's Bureau of Narcotics; nor would it help matters in Baja California. In January 1935 Smale found \"the matter of smuggling. . . taking more and more of the time of this office. \"27 The meeting in Los Angeles provided some assistance. Communi- cation lines between State Department representatives and 'Treas- ury agents, who had often operated in Mexico without consular ----- knowledge, were improved. Smale and other consuls would re- ceive any urgent information from the Customs Border Patrol Office in San Diego. In turn, they were required to report period- ically to a general coordinator in Los Angeles.28 The transfer of a clerk at the consulate, Paul Carr, to the employ of the Treasury Department provided additional help for Smale. Carr undertook most of the daily work concerning smuggling. He worked for the Treasury Department in order to avoid the necessity of presenting a formal request to the Mexican government to allow him to move freely about the Ensenada area. As noted previously, the United States had no interest in reciprocal operations of this kind. \"It is Diug mad of th Ye illici Was rela3 he rf mari able area in oil matt In a feeli: of th gling the sive Nom sion 1932 had f- Illi the e the acros tion respo the E begui in th( in oti State: versu On drugs Latin ation 1929 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/25: CIA-RDP98-01394R000200090001-8 ? ,? ?

The only action Smale was able to take was to have a staff member take a \"vacation\" in the -afea-and report on -conditions there. This and similar occurrences- in other consular districts moved the United States to bring the matter of border smuggling to the attention of the OAC in Geneva. In a presentation distinguished by sensitivity for the diplomatic feelings of Mexico, and therefore symbolic of the reciprocal nature of the Good Neighbor Policy, Stuart J. Fuller declared that smug- gling presented a problem on both sides of the border. In response, the Mexican delegate, Manuel Tello, promised a more comprehen- sive exchange of information on drugs would be forthcoming. Nonetheless, available records for 1936 do not reveal the conclu- sion of any agreement to augment the previous ones of 1930 and 1932.\" It seems unlikely that the Mexicans could believe, as they had at Geneva in 1931, that there was no drug problem in Mexico. . ? , Illicit drug activity also flourished elsewhere in Latin America in the early thirties. Most governments failed to respond even with the rudimentary measures of control prompted by smuggling across the Mexico-United States border. Instead, official inatten- tion and incompetence, even corruption, defined the spectrum of responses to drug problems:Such a situation brought -- -- the extent to which Latin American_governments-actually?had begun to view drug .usage.and .traffic,as .domestic,sociat.problems in_thejate,1920s..It also demonstrated the difficulty of inculcating in others by whatever means the antidrug fervor of the United States. As before, the division remained in part one of culture versus bureaucracy. Only Uruguay embarked upon a serious campaign to control__ drugs: In -June 1931 the State Department distributed throughout_ Latin America a questionnaire seeking information about the situ- ation there. Uruguay's reply showed a flurry of activity between 1929 and 1932. In May 1929 the Geneva Convention of 1925 had _ - - ? - , -? - ?,t.r - 12, t=t_ - ? - ? - l?k - .

Then came the implementation of an import- export. certificate system and a decree in March 1932 seeking to control further commerce in drugs. Most important, the govern- ment gave full power to the National Council of Public Health to supervise the enforcement of all narcotic regulations.31 _ In 1933 the government created the ornately titled Special Corn- -mission for the -Defense Against Toxicomania and Control of the Narcotics Traffic to work with the Public Health Council. The duties of the special commission included supervising compliance with all domestic and international regulations, compiling statistics on the extent of addiction, and promoting an antidrug educational campaign throughout the country. To assist the work of the special commission Uruguaj, planned to spend $10,000 per year.32 As was true elsewhere, attention to domestic matters alone could not mitigate the narcotic situation. The Uruguayan government also had to deal with the possibility of increased drug traffic result- ing from apparent Japanese efforts to establish an industrial center in the Free Zone of Colonia across the Rio de la Plata from Buenos Aires. The Anti-Opium Information Bureau in Geneva, a clearing- house for narcotics data, asked Uruguay to scrutinize closely any questionable activity in Colonia. Of particular concern to the bu- reau was the relative proximity of Bolivian coca fields, an available source of illicit cocaine.33 Unlike officials in Geneva and Washing- ton, Uruguayan authorities did not believe Colonia would become a transit point for smuggling. Dr. Jos?ora, a foreign office official in charge of narcotics, told United States representatives in Mon- tevideo that Colonia had never played a prominent role in illegal traffic. Problems with illicit drugs centered around the border with Brazil. Nonetheless, Uruguay promised to supervise any unusual activity in Colonia. By the mid-thirties, it should be noted, the feared Japanese industrial center had not come into existence.34 At this same time Uruguay took other steps to guard against the introduction of unwanted drugs. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo in December 1933 the government urged those Latin American republics which had not yet ratified the 1931 Geneva Convention to do so quickly.35 Uruguay also sought assistance from the Opium Advisory Committee. At the OAC session in May 1934, Alfredo de Castro asked the committee _ . _ _ _ to make a special appeal to all Latin American governments urging the prompt submittal of their annual reports.

Although, not formally establishing. a state monopoly, the gov- ernment effectively -assumed full.autliority to supervise' and direct all commerce in drugs.\" Also, the public health minister and prefect of police in Montevideo offered cash rewards to those officers who were most productive in their antinarcotic work. By early 1937 drug- co-n-sumPtion--seems Io have fallen below the 1930-34 level. What illegal drugs were uncoveredcame primarily, as before, from Brazil and secondarily from Argentina. \"Compared with cities of similar size in the United States or Europe,\" observed United States Minister Julius Lay, \"drug addiction in Montevideo is of minor importance.\"38 Uruguay imported all its narcotics, both raw and manufactured. This fact plus careful regulation of sale and consumption did much to restrict illicit traffic there. Finally in September 1937 the gov- ernment officially created a state monopoly governing the impor- tation, exportation, and distribution of all narcotic substances. This action went beyond the more limited effort of 1923. Public health officials took charge of the monopoly. Possession of narcotics be- came illegal whether intended for personal use or sale to others. The lair putting this program into effect outlined stiff penalties for any physician or police official who violated its provisions.

No other Latin American nation followed the example set by Uruguay. Argentina, for example, had never made a serious at- tempt at drug control.

In a comment on Argentina's action, the assistant secretary of the treasury, Stephen B. Gibbons, declared that the - regulations were malleable enough to permit phy-sicians to pre- scribe sufficient quantities f.drugs. to Maintain addicts in. their . In? Gibbons's view, Argentina's annual? estimates far sur- passed the actual yearly need. A newly created Section of Narcotics Control in the government evidently did not deem it necessary to revise national drug requirements.42 The narcotic-situation in Honduras seemectequally out of control? early?irthrd,rtar-denr-i tile?eighteen months_prior to the end of g33---11-tonditiaS?iMpoAed- enough morphine, eighty-seven kilo ?g raffig,--ftrinteritsr medical and scientific requirements-_ for one- l?he sukill, far in excess of quota allotments, came mainly from France, Germany, and Switzerland, nations tradition- ally reluctant to adopt manufacturing limitations. In 1934 when Honduras received another twenty-two-year supply of morphine, League of Nations officials suspected wholesale forging of import certificateS.43 Considerable amounts of the imports, including morphine and cocaine, found their way into the southern United States, particu- larly the New Orleans area, where local authorities managed to seize a portion of them. At least one other seizure took place in Dallas. When the smuggling continued, the United States began using Coast Guard vessels to track ships on which drug couriers were believed to be traveling. Consular officials in the Honduran ports of La Ceiba, Tela, Puerto Cort? and Belize provided the Coast Guard with information on ship movements. The State De- partment viewed the reconnaissance efforts as a temporary meas- ure which might provide a deterrent to smuggling. Such an eventuality was, of course, unlikely, given the historical role of smuggling in Central America during depressed economic times. In the 1930s as in earlier eras, smuggling became a part of the local way of life?a potentially rewarding enterprise for some individuals during the worldwide depression.\" Numerous Hondurans received narcotics from Europe, but one man, Jos?aria Guillen Velez, seemed to acquire larger quantities - than most. (It was morphine from one of his shipments that officials .in Dallas seized in 1932.) Guillen Velez, owner of a pharmacy in Puerto Cort? accepted shipment of forty kilograms of morphine ''I?ij??.;-; ?
