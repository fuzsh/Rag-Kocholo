        "text": "Roper History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe history of the Roper family name begins after the Norman Conquest of 1066. They lived in Derbyshire. Their name, however, is a reference to Rupier, in Calvados, Normandy, the family's place of residence prior to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.\n\n\"William de Rupierre (who came to England with the Conqueror) is mentioned by Ordericus Vitalis; and in 1090 commanded the forces of Duke Robert. The Counts of Rupierre continued in Normandy till the last century.\" 1\n\nThe name was derived fro the Old English word \"rap\" which was an occupational name for a \"roper\" or \"rope-maker.\" Interestingly, the Roper spelling tends to be seen more often in the north, while the Raper spelling tend to be found in the south. Conversely, another etymology of the name goes thusly: \"There is a very ancient family of the Ropers in Cumberland, who have lived immemorially near a quarry of red spate there, from whence they first took the surname Rubra Spatha. \" 2 This latter etymology is plausible as De Rubra Spatha is a Latinized form of Roper or Rooper.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Roper family\n\nThe surname Roper was first found in Derbyshire where they were recorded as a family of great antiquity seated as Lords of the manor of Turndiche and estates in that shire. One of the first records of the name was Roger Raper who was listed in the Assize Rolls of Yorkshire in 1219. One year later, Richard le Ropere was listed in Hertfordshire. 3\n\nOf note was Richard Furneux, a lineal descendant of Robert de Fourneux, temp. Henry I., assumed the name of Roper in 1428, on his marriage with the heiress of Roper of Turndiche. 2\n\nThe township of Moorhouse in Durham held a special significance to the family. \"In the seventeenth century this township was the seat, in succession, of the families of Ingleby and Roper.\" 4 At one time the family held a manor at Aston-Upon-Trent in Derbyshire. \"The manor was granted after the Reformation to Sir William Paget, and subsequently passed to the Ropers, from whom it was purchased in 1649 by the Holden family.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Roper family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Roper research. Another 134 words (10 lines of text) covering the years 1158, 1498, 1521, 1529, 1534, 1545, 1553, 1554, 1555, 1557, 1578, 1616, 1618, 1636, 1658, 1665, 1726 and 1928 are included under the topic Early Roper History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nRoper Spelling Variations\n\nAnglo-Norman names are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. When the Normans became the ruling people of England in the 11th century, they introduced a new language into a society where the main languages of Old and later Middle English had no definite spelling rules. These languages were more often spoken than written, so they blended freely with one another. Contributing to this mixing of tongues was the fact that medieval scribes spelled words according to sound, ensuring that a person's name would appear differently in nearly every document in which it was recorded. The name has been spelled Roper, Rooper, Ruper, Ropear and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Roper family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nWilliam Roper (c. 1498-1578), an English biographer of Sir Thomas More, the eldest son of John Roper. The father, who had property both at Eltham in Kent and in St. Dunstan's parish, Canterbury, was s...\n\nRoper was an ardent Catholic to the last, and during Queen Mary's reign took a part in public life. He had previously sat for Bramber (1529), Rochester (1545), and Winchester (1553), and he was return...\n\nSamuel Roper (died 1658), an English antiquary, was the eldest son of Thomas Roper of Heanor, Derbyshire\n\nSamuel Roper (died 1658), was an English antiquary, was eldest son of Thomas Roper of Heanor, Derbyshire.

More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nRoper migration to the United States +\n\nFor many English families, the political and religious disarray that plagued their homeland made the frontiers of the New World an attractive prospect. Thousands migrated, aboard cramped disease-ridden ships. They arrived sick, poor, and hungry, but were welcomed in many cases with far greater opportunity than at home in England. Many of these hardy settlers went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations in which they landed. Among early immigrants bearing the name Roper or a variant listed above were:\n\nRoper Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nPhillipp Roper, who arrived in Virginia in 1618 8\n\nClement Roper, aged 25, who landed in Virginia in 1623 aboard the ship \"Southampton\" 8\n\nClement Roper, who arrived in Virginia in 1623 along with Thomas\n\nJohn Roper, who arrived in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1641 8\n\nWalter Roper, who arrived in New England in 1642 8\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nRobert Roper, aged 26, a farmer, who arrived in New Plymouth aboard the ship \"Phoebe Dunbar\" between 1841 and 1850\n\nRoper Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nMr. James Roper, British settler travelling from London aboard the ship \"Harwood\" arriving in Auckland, New Zealand on 4th November 1858 14\n\nMrs. Charlotte Roper, (b. 1834), aged 26, English settler from Suffolk travelling from Bristol aboard the ship \"William Miles\" arriving in Lyttelton, Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand on 21st August 1860 15\n\nMr. Robert Roper, (b. 1835), aged 25, English farm labourer from Suffolk travelling from Bristol aboard the ship \"William Miles\" arriving in Lyttelton, Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand on 21st August 1860 15\n\nMr. Patrick Roper, (b. 1850), aged 27, Scottish settler travelling from Glasgow aboard the ship \"Marlborough\" arriving in Bluff, South Island, New Zealand on 4th November 1877 14\n\nMr. Daniel Roper, (b. 1858), aged 20, British settler travelling from London aboard the ship \"Western Monarch\" arriving in New Zealand in 1879 15\n\nRoper migration to West Indies +\n\nThe British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 16\n\nRoper Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Hanna Roper, (b. 1612), aged 23, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Paul of London\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 17\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Roper (post 1700) +\n\nRoper Stote Donnison Roper (1771-1823), English legal writer, the only son of the Rev.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Lux anglis crux Francis\n\nMotto Translation: Light to the English, a cross to the French.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Roper +\n\nThe Roper Family Bible Record by Mary Waller Shepherd Soper.\n\nCitations +\n\nCleveland, Dutchess of The Battle Abbey Roll with some Account of the Norman Lineages.
