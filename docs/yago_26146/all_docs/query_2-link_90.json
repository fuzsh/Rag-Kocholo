        "text": "This page generates random names using the one thousand most common last names from the 2010 US census; the one thousand most common 2020 female given names from SSA; as well as the one thousand most common 2020 male given names from SSA. First and last names are combined randomly when the page loads. Odd-numbered first names are female and even-numbered first names are male. Duplicate first name–last name combinations are improbable since the page can produce 2M different names; however no duplicate check is performed, since it is possible for real names to be identical as well. We made this page because we needed a quick way to get a long list of random names for use in UX mockups and UI designs, and the excellent app we normally use for this — uinames.com — was offline.\n\nSamhæng"
