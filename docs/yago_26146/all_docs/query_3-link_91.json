        "text": "In today’s culturally diverse classrooms, students possess and use many culturally, ethnically, and regionally diverse English language varieties that may differ from standardized English. This book helps classroom teachers become attuned to these differences and offers practical strategies to support student achievement while fostering positive language attitudes in classrooms and beyond. The text contrasts standardized varieties of English with Southern, Appalachian, and African American English varieties, focusing on issues that are of everyday concern to those who are assessing the linguistic competence of students. Featuring a narrative style with teaching strategies and discussion questions, this practical resource:\n\nProvides a clear, introductory explanation of what is meant by non-standard English, from both linguistic and educational viewpoints.\n\nEmphasizes what educators needs to know about language variation in and outside of the classroom.\n\nAddresses the social factors accompanying English language variation and how those factors interact in real classrooms.\n\n“A landmark book. . . . It guides linguists and educators as we all work to apply our knowledge on behalf of those for whom it matters most: students.”\n\n—From the Afterword by Walt Wolfram, North Carolina State University\n\n“In the ongoing debate about language we typically hear arguments about what students say and/or how they say it. Finally, a volume that takes on the ‘elephant in the parlor’—WHO is saying it. By laying bare the complicated issues of race, culture, region, and ethnicity, Charity Hudley and Mallinson provide a scholarly significant and practically relevant text for scholars and practitioners alike. This is bound to be an important contribution to the literature.”\n\n—Gloria Ladson-Billings, University of Wisconsin–Madison\n\n“An invaluable guide for teachers, graduate students, and all lovers of language. The authors provide a comprehensive and fascinating account of Southern and African American English, showing how it differs from standardized English, how those differences affect children in the classroom, and how teachers can use these insights to better serve their students.”\n\n—Deborah Tannen, University Professor and professor of linguistics, Georgetown University\n\nHow can teachers help their students to meet high standards of reading and writing while also preparing them to become thoughtful and productive members of a multicultural society? And why is it important to do this? In her new book, Mary Dilg brings us into her high school English classroom, where we see students reach across the social, cultural, and economic lines that divide them to build lifelong literacy skills. The book explores what happens when we introduce students to the words of a broad spectrum of American scholars, writers, and artists and then invite them to examine, debate, and negotiate the ideas presented. Dilg provides a safe space to explore complex issues and includes samples of classroom writing to demonstrate how students use their language arts classroom to make sense of themselves and their world.\n\nBook features:\n\nA detailed account of teaching in a culturally and linguistically diverse classroom, including practical strategies to engage and motivate adolescents.\n\nA model for integrating issues of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation into the English curriculum and into classroom instruction.\n\nA blending of a traditional American Literature curriculum with an up-to-date treatment that will be successful in today’s diverse classrooms.\n\nA glimpse at students sharing their voices and building a supportive, multicultural community in the classroom.\n\nExamples of student writing and online access to course syllabi, sample assignments, and project guidelines.\n\nMary Dilg teaches English at the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. She is the author of Thriving in the Multicultural Classroom: Principles and Practices for Effective Teaching.\n\n“Our Worlds in Our Words recognizes the complexities of our children’s world and the opportunities our classrooms provide. This is an important and timely book honoring the significance of each and every person not simply from the historical perspective but with a look to the future.”\n\n—Barbara S. Hiller, Assistant Superintendent, Curriculum and Instruction, Evanston, Illinois, public schools\n\n“Mary Dilg has written a remarkably useful book. Grounded in multicultural theory that she has absorbed and lived, Dilg shows how her commitment to multicultural education plays out in the courses she teaches. Because she discusses the model she offers with such depth and clarity, a wide spectrum of educators can draw from it when meeting the very real needs of their 21st-century students.”\n\n—Janice R. Welsch, Professor Emerita, Western Illinois University\n\n“Dilg's practical guidance on how to surface and discuss sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom is needed for all school personnel; her empathy with and understanding of young people struggling for safety, respect, and acceptance in often cruel school and family environments is needed for everyone.”\n\n—Shannon Sullivan, MPH, Executive Director, Illinois Safe Schools Alliance\n\n\"Read this important new book now and learn first hand from Mary Dilg what is truly possible to achieve in American high schools. Practical and conceptual, this inspiring book shows us how excellence in education requires diversity in people and perceptions in our classrooms and schools.\"\n\n—Daniel B. Frank, Principal, Francis W. Parker School, Chicago and Executive Editor, Schools: Studies in Education\n\nIn her award-winning book, Linda Darling-Hammond-renowned researcher, policy advisor, and educational leader-contends that improving America's performance in the global economy is closely tied to closing the minority-majority achievement gap at home. Today in the United States only 1 in 10 low-income kindergarteners goes on to graduate from college. At a time when education matters more than ever, the U.S. high school graduation rate has dropped from first in the world to the bottom half of rankings for comparable nations. While such sobering facts inform her new book, the author focuses on the successes of effective school systems in the U.S. and abroad in order to develop a clear and coherent set of policies that can be used to create high-quality and equitable schools. Drawing on her broad experience, Darling-Hammond examines the roots of our modern education system and shows how the skills required for our 21st-century global economy cannot be learned in traditional education systems, which have been in place since the early 1900s. She identifies an \"opportunity gap\" that has evolved as new kinds of learning have become necessary - a gap where low-income students, students of color, and English language learners often do not have the same access as others to qualified teachers, high-quality curriculum, and well-resourced classrooms. After setting the stage on current conditions in the United States, Darling-Hammond offers a coherent approach for effective reform that focuses on creating successful systems, inducting and supporting quality teachers, designing effective schools, establishing strong professional practice, and providing equitable and sufficient resources. The Flat World and Education lays out what the United States needs to do in order to build a system of high-achieving and equitable schools that ensures every child the right to learn.\n\nDarling-Hammond is the Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education at Stanford University, a chief education advisor to President Obama, Co-Director of the Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education, and Founding Director of the School Redesign Network at Stanford.\n\n“If the cogent messages of this searing and compelling book are heeded and implemented by educational researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, our nation will be greatly enriched by the abundant gifts of young men of color.”\n\n—James A.

Noguera, Peter L. Agnew Professor of Education, New York University, and author of City Schools and the American Dream\n\n“This book provides an important testament to the power we have to change lives and to the remarkable resiliency that brings hope in the face of hardship.\n\n—Rachel F. Moran, Michael J. Connell Distinguished Professor of Law and Dean, UCLA School of Law\n\nIn Streetsmart Schoolsmart, two respected scholars present original research on youth gangs and school success to explain why some boys become disengaged and join gangs while others do not. Chapters vividly describe how urban boys from different ethnic backgrounds (Asian, African American, and Latino) approach schooling and identify the sociocultural factors that affect their choices. The authors concentrate on three areas: (1) the role of marginalized communities in the formation of urban gang youth, (2) the role of community-based organizations in reengaging urban youth, and (3) the role of schools in creating opportunities for urban boys to succeed despite disparities in their economic and social circumstances.\n\nStreetsmart Schoolsmart points the way toward important changes that can break the cycle of poverty in American neighborhoods and society. It is essential reading for educators and all professionals working with urban youth, and anyone concerned with the success of young boys.\n\nGilberto Q.

Their experiences are brought to life in this groundbreaking empirical study through interviews with their principals, district representatives in charge of recruitment and orientation, recruitment agency personnel, and union representatives, as well as in-depth classroom observations and student commentary. This well-researched work raises an essential question: If international teachers face daily exploitation, a lack of personal and professional support, and a lack of pedagogical and cultural preparation, are they able to give urban students the high-quality multicultural education they need and deserve?\n\nBook Features:\n\nAn engaging case study that tackles competing discourses about immigration, globalization, and teacher quality.\n\nThe voices of international teachers highlighting the successes and challenges of their experience and comparisons to teachers in other cities across the country.\n\nAn examination of the differences in student and teacher expectations and how these influence teaching and learning.\n\nAlyssa Hadley Dunnis an assistant professor of urban teacher education at Georgia State University.\n\n“Teachers Without Borders?underscores the need for teacher educators and district personnel to incorporate culturally relevant pedagogy into their programs and professional support.”\n\n—From the Foreword byJacqueline Jordan Irvine\n\n“Teachers Without Borders?documents the advent of hiring international teachers to fill shortages in urban schools. Dunn’s extraordinary analysis shows the lack of preparation of these teachers and, as important, she teaches us how to build the kind of support that will transform this kind of teacher recruitment into a system that matters for students, their schools, and their communities.”\n\n—Ann Lieberman, Senior Scholar, Stanford University, co-author ofTeachers in Professional CommunitiesandHow Teachers Become Leaders\n\n“Alyssa Hadley Dunn argues that both students and international teachers are being misled. This is an excellent and important study.”\n\n—Carl A. Grant, Hoefs-Bascom Professor, University Wisconsin-Madison\n\n“In this highly readable case study, Dunn exposes how the rhetoric of ‘cultural awareness’ used to justify hiring temporary international teachers masks a deeper devaluation of teachers, students of color, and pedagogical knowledge.”\n\n—Christine Sleeter, professor emerita, California State University, Monterey Bay, co-author ofTeaching with Vision: Culturally Responsive Teaching in Standards-Based Classrooms\n\n\"Teachers Without Borders?will transport you through the local and the global, interweaving nuanced portraits of teachers from abroad with troubling unveilings of the bigger picture behind teacher recruitment and school reform.

This book provides a critical discussion of the role that select K–12 educational policies have and continue to play in failing Latino students. The author draws upon institutional, national, and statewide data sets, as well as interviews among students, teachers, and college administrators, to explore the role that public policies play in educating Latino students. The book concludes with specific recommendations that aim to raise achievement, college transition rates, and success among Latino students across the preschool through college continuum.\n\nFrances Contrerasis an Associate Professor of Higher Education in the area of Leadership and Policy Studies in the College of Education, University of Washington in Seattle\n\n“Prof. Frances Contreras is one of the nation’s leading authorities on Latino educational problems and on policies that will effectively address these. This book presents a unique and incisive analysis of the Latino educational achievement gap and its connections to concomitant gap in educational opportunities for Latinos. This very readable book combines rigorous scholarship with clearly stated policy recommendations. It should be read by all who are interested in understanding and addressing one of the most serious problems of our times.”\n\n—Jorge Chapa,University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign\n\n“Rich in data and social context, Contreras presents a compelling and comprehensive picture for the collective need to invest fully in the education of our Latino youth. As important, she delineates a bold public policy pathway for Latino student success that encompasses K–12 and higher education.”\n\n—James M. Montoya,Vice President, Higher Education, The College Board\n\n“This book offers valuable insights and productive recommendations for addressing a critically important topic: how to improve educational equity for Latinos, one of our nation’s fastest-growing but most-underserved populations.”\n\n—Laura Perna, Professor, Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania\n\nAmericans by Heart examines the plight of undocumented Latino students as they navigate the educational and legal tightrope presented by their immigration status. Many of these students are accepted to attend some of our best colleges and universities but cannot afford the tuition to do so because they are not eligible for financial aid or employment. For the few that defy the odds and manage to graduate, their status continues to present insurmountable barriers to employment. This timely and compelling account brings to light the hard work and perseverance of these students and their families; their commitment to education and civic participation; and their deep sense of uncertainty and marginality. Offering a rich in-depth analysis, the author presents a new framework for educational policies that recognizes the merit and potential of undocumented Latino students and links their situation to larger social and policy issues of immigration reform and higher education access.\n\nContents:\n\n1.

Conclusion\n\nWilliam Pérez is an associate professor of education at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California.\n\n“No topic speaks more forcefully about the values of our country than how we treat the poor. Americans by Heart gives voice, hope and clarity to one of America’s most invisible groups—undocumented students. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the country’s current immigration policies, we all need to better understand the topic and hear the challenges, dreams, and struggles of these young people. This book is a compelling and thoughtful analysis on a much discussed but little studied topic.”\n\n—William G. Tierney, University Professor and Wilbur Kieffer Professor of Higher Education, Director, Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis, University of Southern California\n\n“In America today a growing caste of youth are coming of age on the shadows of the law. They are American at heart, but alas, not in the eyes of the law. Far from paralytic or silenced, they are fully engaged in a struggle for the autonomy of the human spirit. As Americans by Heart poignantly reveals, these youth are fully engaged—with a fierce optimism and Kantian rational agency—performing for us all nothing more and nothing less than what it means to be an American. I applaud William Pérez this urgent, important, and loving book. It is essential reading for all who worry about threats to our democratic promise.”\n\n—Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco, Ross University Professor of Globalization and Education, New York University\n\n“This is a very courageous text that asks us as a nation to broaden our construction of citizenship to include the rights of the undocumented in our midst through policies that simultaneously tear down barriers and build bridges to higher education institutions for them. To do so is not only in our best interest as a country, but it responds to fundamental, national—and indeed, human—values related to fairness and human dignity. Kudos to William Pérez for his cogent, stirring analysis of an otherwise vexing social problem.”\n\n—Angela Valenzuela, Professor, University of Texas at Austin, and author of Subtractive Schooling and Leaving Children Behind\n\nThis is a comprehensive introduction to the main frameworks for thinking about, conducting research on, and teaching about race and racism in education. Renowned theoretician and philosopher Zeus Leonardo surveys the dominant race theories and, more specifically, focuses on those frameworks that are considered essential to cultivating a critical attitude toward race and racism. The book examines four frameworks: Critical Race Theory (CRT), Marxism, Whiteness Studies, and Cultural Studies. A critique follows each framework in order to analyze its strengths and set its limits. The last chapter offers a theory of “race ambivalence,” which combines aspects of all four theories into one framework. Engaging and cutting edge, Race Frameworks is a foundational text suitable for courses in education and critical race studies.\n\n“Race continues to be a topic that is central to understanding education in the United States today, yet more often than not it confuses and confounds. This detailed and comprehensive analysis will shed light on the complexities of the role of race in education. Leonardo's work is insightful, compelling, and original.”\n\n—Pedro Noguera, Peter L. Agnew Professor of Education, New York University\n\n“Highlighting points of confluence and divergence, Leonardo provides a superb overview and interrogation of distinct critical frameworks on race. Placing these paradigms in conversation with one another, he synthesizes and extends their key insights to imagine a new and generative framework for the study of race and education.”\n\n—Michael Omi, Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies, University of California, Berkeley\n\n“Zeus Leonardo provides a valuable overview of the confusions and contradictions in racial theory, using a dialogical approach to demonstrate how both popular and scholarly understandings of race are deeply flawed. Whether or not you agree with him that a postracial perspective is desirable, you will be informed (and entertained) by Race Frameworks.”\n\n—Howard Winant, Professor of Sociology, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nClass Rules challenges the popular myth that high schools are the “Great Equalizers.” In his groundbreaking study, Cookson demonstrates that adolescents undergo different class rites of passage depending on the social-class composition of the high school they attend. Drawing on stories of schools and individual students, the author shows that where a student goes to high school is a major influence on his or her social class trajectory. Class Rules is a penetrating, original examination of the role education plays in blocking upward mobility for many children. It offers a compelling vision of an equitable system of schools based on the full democratic rights of students.\n\nBook Features:\n\nProvides a fresh, dynamic way of understanding educational inequality and social reproduction.\n\nOffers a breakthrough social/psychological theory of how adolescents acquire class consciousness.\n\nCompares the cultures and curricula of five American high schools focusing on the class composition of their students.\n\n“This highly readable and original book illuminates why we don’t have open class warfare in our society, despite huge inequalities. Peter Cookson shows how schools reproduce classes through institutional practices that forge class-based consciousness. He also suggests how education might be changed.”\n\n—Caroline Hodges Persell, professor emerita of sociology, New York University\n\n“Cookson does a superb job of analyzing the powerful forces in our schools that reinforce the racial, ethnic, and social-class structures our nation hopes to overcome. Breaking out of one’s social class was always hard but may now be harder than in previous decades. Cookson reminds us of what high schools can be, the great equalizers, institutions for promoting America’s finest values.”\n\n—David Berliner, Regents’ professor emeritus, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University\n\nIn his new book, the author of the bestseller Why Race and Culture Matter in Schools examines the chronic under-performance of African American males in U.S. schools. Citing a plethora of disturbing academic outcomes for Black males, this book focuses on the historical, structural, educational, psychological, emotional, and cultural factors that influence the teaching and learning process for this student population. Howard discusses the potential and promise of Black males by highlighting their voices to generate new insights, create new knowledge, and identify useful practices that can significantly improve the schooling experiences and life chances of Black males. Howard calls for a paradigm shift in how we think about, teach, and study Black males.\n\nBook Features:\n\nExamines current structures, ideologies, and practices that both help and hinder the educational and social prospects of Black males.\n\nTranslates frequently cited theoretical principles into research-based classroom practice.\n\nDocuments teacher-student interactions, student viewpoints, and discusses the troubling role that sports plays in the lives of many Black males.\n\nHighlights voices and perspectives from Black male students about ways to improve their schooling experiences and outcomes.\n\nIdentifies community-based programs that are helping Black males succeed.\n\n“Howard is more than a reformer. He seeks to dismantle a system that stifles dreams, devours hopes, and destroys opportunities. . . . He offers us a road map for how to do this and an invitation to join him in this venture. Let us hope that more than a few of those who read this book will enthusiastically accept his offer and join him in this important work.”\n\n—From the Foreword by Pedro A. Noguera, New York University\n\n“Black Male(d) is a timely, masterfully crafted contribution to an important conversation about one of our nation’s most misunderstood populations. Anyone who is troubled by the status of Black boys in schools and society will find much that is useful in this book. The author’s brilliance is apparent and praiseworthy.”\n\n—Shaun R. Harper, Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, University of Pennsylvania\n\n“This book pushes educators to not only know more but to do more on behalf of Black males. This is the book that shows us how to reform practices, policies, and places in order to improve the human condition of Black males. Howard reminds us all that we absolutely must do better—our children’s lives depend on it!”\n\n—H.

With a new Introductory Chapter and a new Epilogue, Nieto addresses some of the changes we have experienced during the past decade that help explain the current sociopolitical environment—our increasing diversity, the altering conditions in schools and in society, the influence of poverty on learning, and the impact of NCLB on classrooms and schools. This updated edition of The Light in Their Eyes:\n\nFocuses on the significant role of teachers in transforming students’ lives.\n\nConsiders recent theories, policies, and practices about the variability in student learning and culturally responsive pedagogy.\n\nExamines the importance of student and teacher voice in research and practice.\n\nProvides an update, in their own words, on former students whose journal entries were included in the first edition.\n\n“In search of a critical community, Sonia Nieto combines respect for what children bring to school with a desire to awaken each one and tap into their passion for learning. This classic work radiates with the sensitivity Sonia Nieto is known for in all her work.”\n\n—Maxine Greene, Professor Emerita, Teachers College, Columbia University\n\nPraise for the First Edition!\n\n\"A spirited, provocative defense of multicultural education.\"\n\n—Choice\n\n\"In this important and thought-provoking book, Sonia Nieto reaffirms her reputation as one of the leading theorists in multicultural education.\"\n\n—Rethinking Schools\n\n\"Perhaps once every 5 years, one is fortunate enough to read a scholarly book that is as hard to put down as a good novel, yet is brimming with profound insights on virtually every page.

She is the author of the bestselling books Why We Teach and What Keeps Teachers Going?\n\nThis timely and critical look at the teaching of English shows how language is used to create hierarchies of cultural privilege in public schools across the United States. Drawing on the work of four ESL teachers who pursued anti-racist pedagogical practices during their first year of teaching, the author provides a compelling account of how new teachers might gain agency for culturally responsive teaching in spite of school cultures that often discourage such approaches. She combines current research and original analyses to shed light on real classroom situations faced by teachers of linguistically diverse populations. This book will help pre- and inservice teachers to think about such challenges as differential achievement between language learners and “native-speakers”; hierarchies of languages and language varieties; the difference between an accent identity and an incorrect pronunciation; and the use of students’ first languages in English classes. An important resource for classroom teaching, educational policy, school leadership, and teacher preparation, this volume includes reflection questions at the end of each chapter.\n\n“This is an important and timely book. How to best educate new Americans, including the best language policies, is a matter of controversy and dissent. Race, Empire, and English Language Teaching is must reading for teachers and school administrators, policymakers, and concerned citizens who are interested in a deeper understanding of how anti-racist pedagogical practices and culturally responsive teaching can work to engage all students moving forward.”\n\n—Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco, dean and distinguished professor of education, UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, co-author of Learning a New Land\n\n“Foregrounding teachers’ voices, Motha lucidly conceptualizes ideological facets of teaching English—monolingualism, native speakerism, and standard language—as racialized practices that undergird colonial power and contradict pluricentric understandings of English. Her analysis is intellectually robust, morally engaging, and discursively accessible. This is a must-read for all ESL professionals.”\n\n—Ryuko Kubota, professor, Department of Language and Literacy Education, The University of British Columbia\n\nSuhanthie Motha is assistant professor in the Department of English at the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\nIn his new book, Carlos Alberto Torres, an internationally renowned critical theorist of education, explores the early writings of Paulo Freire whose ideas have had a tremendous and long-lasting impact on the world of pedagogy and politics. Torres analyzes Freire’s works, from the 1960s and 1970s, before Freire gained worldwide recognition for his Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Offering an in-depth look into the formative thinking of Freire, Torres identifies how his ideas produced frameworks for educating global citizens, building community and mutual respect, creating social responsibility, instilling an appreciation for diversity, promoting multiple literacies, and social justice education. This volume is the result of more than 3 decades of research with access to Freire’s personal library and the archives of the Paulo Freire Institute, as well as the author’s extensive conversations with Paulo Freire over two decades—Dr. Torres was Freire’s adviser during his tenure as Secretary of Education in the Municipality of São Paulo, Brazil, 1989–1991.\n\n“First Freire is a fascinating discourse on the meaning and power of Freire's contribution by a noted colleague and scholar.”\n\n—Henry M. Levin, William Heard Kilpatrick Professor of Economics and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University\n\n“Paulo Freire was one of the great educational and political philosophers of the 20th century. In First Freire, Torres—a foremost Freire scholar—has provided us with a wonderful and insightful analysis of the many facets of Freire's writings. Particularly important is Torres’ ability to situate Freire's work in the political context that framed and defined his writings. Hopefully, First Freire will inspire a new generation of educators to move beyond the current neo-liberal discussions about student test scores and ‘what works’ to understand the political meaning of education.”\n\n—Martin Carnoy, Vida Jacks Professor of Education, Stanford University\n\n“Professor Torres successfully combines, in unconventional ways, his personal reminiscences of Freire with essays that illuminate Freire’s political philosophy and thoughts on the anthropology of education, demonstrating specific approaches one can use to engage in the method of thematic investigation proposed by Freire. A considerable merit of this book is how it persuasively shows the timely relevance of the critical observations of this great Latin American thinker to contemporary society, as we struggle to go beyond economic and technological globalization to rebuild our changed but still community-oriented selves.”\n\n—Nelly P. Stromquist, professor, University of Maryland\n\nIn this book, nationally renowned scholars join classroom teachers to share equity-oriented approaches that have been successful with urban high school mathematics students. Compiling for the first time major research findings and practitioner experiences from Railside High School, the volume describes the evolution of a fundamentally different conception of learners and teaching. The chapters bring together research and reflection on teacher collaboration and professional community, student outcomes and mathematics classroom culture, reform curricula and pedagogy, and ongoing teacher development.\n\nMathematics for Equity will be invaluable reading for teachers, schools, and districts interested in maintaining a focus on equity and improving student learning while making sense of the new demands of the Common Core State Standards.\n\nBook Features:\n\nCore principles of an equity-centered mathematics program.\n\nExamples of how to focus and organize the collaborative work of a math department to develop a shared pedagogy.\n\nStudent experiences with an equity pedagogy that focuses on building perseverance, flexibility in thinking, and deep conceptual understanding.\n\nConnections between reconceptualizing learners and teaching, and achieving deep mathematics learning and equitable outcomes.\n\nContributors include: Jo Boaler, Ilana Seidel Horn, Judith Warren Little, and Rachel Lotan.\n\n“Mathematics for Equity provides a kaleidoscopic view, in the voices of teachers, researchers, and students themselves, of one of the nation’s most ambitious and successful attempts at teaching mathematics for equity. It shows what it takes to create a climate that supports students and teachers in engaging in meaningful mathematical activity—and, alas, how vulnerable such environments are to the wrong kinds of ‘accountability.’ Read it and learn.”\n\n—Alan H. Schoenfeld, University of California at Berkeley\n\n“Want to fix what's wrong with mathematics instruction in your school? Read this book with your colleagues and do what it inspires you to do. Written by the brave teachers and former students who did it, as well as researchers.”\n\n—Phil Daro, writing team, Common Core Standards, Strategic Education Research Partnership\n\nIn his new book, Michael Vavrus helps readers better understand why issues of diversity and difference are so highly contested in the United States and across the globe. Vavrus incorporates specific education examples throughout the text to examine six contested areas: race and ethnicity; socioeconomic class and culture; multicultural and ethnic studies; language; religion; and sexuality and gender. In each of these areas, the author explores how contrasting worldviews found in social conservatism, liberal multiculturalism, and critical multiculturalism influence our understandings about difference and diversity and the education policies we develop as a result. Diversity and Education is designed to help educators move beyond the “how can they believe that?” knee-jerk reaction toward a more informed, strategic understanding of belief systems and political affiliations.\n\nBook Features:\n\nBrings a contemporary, 21st–century perspective to differing political orientations toward diversity and education.\n\nExamines outcomes of diversity debates on children of color, the poor, immigrants, women, and sexual and religious minorities.\n\nUses critical pedagogy with a historical and political economy lens to explain current diversity issues in education.\n\nCritiques the diversity stance of new national teacher education standards from the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation.\n\n“Diversity and Education can not only help us have conversations about racism, institutionalizedoppression, and cultural fear, it can also offer an intervention that can movereaders towards a deeper critical consciousness about diversity and multicultural education in their own lives.”\n\n—From the Foreword by Wayne Au, associate professor at the University of Washington, Bothell, and an editor for Rethinking Schools\n\n“Few education scholars have offered as potent and cogent a political and economic analysis of multicultural education and diversity as Professor Michael Vavrus has in his new book. His critique of neoliberalism via critical pedagogy and his advocacy of social justice education are timely and praiseworthy.”\n\n—Ramin Farahmandpur, professor, Graduate School of Education, Portland State University\n\n“Diversity and Education is a must-read for anyone concerned about why so many policies claiming to ‘help’ diverse students fail, and what alternatives exist. Vavrus clearly believes in the power of teachers who are well-educated critical thinkers. In this lucid and compelling text, he skillfully applies a highly useful framework to unpack historical and contemporary debates about core concepts underlying multiple struggles for education and rights.”\n\n—Christine Sleeter, professor emerita, California State University, Monterey Bay\n\nThis book is for anyone who is challenged or troubled by the substantial disparities in college participation, persistence, and completion among racial and ethnic groups in the United States. As codirectors of the Center for Urban Education (CUE) at the University of Southern California, coauthors Alicia Dowd and Estela Bensimon draw on their experience conducting CUE’s Equity Scorecard, a comprehensive action research process that has been implemented at over 40 colleges and universities in the United States. They demonstrate what educators need to know and do to take an active role in racial equity work on their own campuses.\n\nThrough case studies of college faculty, administrators, and student affairs professionals engaged in inquiry using the Equity Scorecard, the book clarifies the “muddled conversation” that colleges and universities are having about equity. Synthesizing equity standards based on three theories of justice—justice as fairness, justice as care, and justice as transformation—the authors provide strategies for enacting equity in practice on college campuses. Engaging the “Race Question” illustrates how practitioner inquiry can be used to address the “race question” with wisdom and calls on college leaders and educators to change the policies and practices that perpetuate institutional and structural racism—and provides a blueprint for doing so.\n\nBook Features:\n\nProvides concrete examples of policy and practice for improving equity in postsecondary education.\n\nExamines the role of individuals and groups in the change process.\n\nIncludes examples of action research tools from the Equity Scorecard.\n\nOffers strategies for professional development and organizational change.\n\n“Dowd and Bensimon have been at the forefront of racial equity research in higher education for nearly two decades, and their racial equity scorecard has changed the way higher education thinks about the issue.”\n\n—Patricia Gándara, co-director, The Civil Rights Project\n\n“Proven strategies that every educator in America can use to develop context-specific solutions for advancing equity while exploring the legacy of institutionalized racism that typically paralyzes reform and hinders change.”\n\n—Tia Brown McNair, senior director for student success, Association of American Colleges and Universities\n\n“A valuable step-by-step guide to making our colleges more academically inviting and egalitarian.”\n\n—Mike Rose, author of Back to School: Why Everyone Deserves a Second Chance at Education\n\nAcclaimed African American scholar and teacher educator Gloria Ladson-Billings examines the field of teacher education through the accomplishments and contributions of well-known African American teacher educators—Lisa Delpit, Carl Grant, Jacqueline Jordan Irvine, Geneva Gay, Cherry McGee Banks, William Tate, and Joyce King.\n\nUsing in-depth interviews and storytelling, Ladson-Billings depicts deeply personal portraits of these scholars’ experiences to confront race and racism, not only theoretically, but within their everyday professional lives in “the Big House” of the academy. Ladson-Billings gives these portraits even greater resonance and meaning by pairing these teacher educators with historical figures—such as Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, and Charlotte Forten—whose contributions to the struggle for social justice are a wellspring of hope and courage to all educators, and a tribute to African Americans whose political, scientific, and spiritual efforts made life better for us all.\n\nThis compelling book is important reading for all educators who want to transform teacher education for the better.\n\n“The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education is enthused and excited about Ladson-Billings’s dynamic and provoking scholarship. Its focus on outstanding African American teacher educators is a major contribution to teacher education literature. This cutting-edge research is likely to prompt some of the best of unconventional teacher education thought.”\n\n—David G. Imig, President and CEO, American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education\n\n“In this moving and original book, Gloria Ladson-Billings offers complex insights about the politics of scholarship, the experiences of scholars of color in universities, and the larger enterprise of teaching and teacher education for social justice.”\n\n—Marilyn Cochran-Smith,Lynch School of Education, Boston College and President of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) for 2004–05.\n\nBased on 20 years of teaching experience and research in schools across the country, Teaching and Learning on the Verge demonstrates how educators in all disciplines can integrate civic engagement, multicultural literacy, and leadership into their classrooms and programs. Featuring voices from literature and philosophy in dialogue with the living stage of classrooms, streets, and community spaces, this book offers an imaginative and practical guide to democratic education.\n\nTeaching and Learning on the Verge will help educators to:\n\nApply models for breaking down walls between school and society.\n\nProvide students with experiences that deepen their understanding of identity, justice, and relationships.\n\nMake learning meaningful to students by bridging communities, generations, and other social divides.\n\nResist a narrow focus on achievement and make space for students as independent thinkers and leaders of social change.\n\nMake schools stronger by challenging the processes that people in power use to thwart movements for equality.\n\n“Teaching and Learning on the Verge exemplifies the giddiness, unpredictability, and intrinsic messiness of democratic action and civic learning. Elliott offers an engaging whirlwind of examples and ideas in examining civic action among and with youth in a multicultural democracy.”\n\n—Meira Levinson, associate professor of education, Harvard Graduate School of Education\n\n“One teacher’s efforts to practice democracy in her classroom, becomes a scholarly, yet sparkling, exploration of the thought and practice and real difficulties involved in enacting varieties of democratic learning. Personal testimony goes hand in hand with intellectual depth to produce this vital handbook for adventurous teachers everywhere.”\n\n—Jay Featherstone, poet, writer, and educator, former editor of The New Republic\n\nMost of the struggles for equitable schooling, including multicultural curricula and culturally responsive teaching, have largely taken place on a local or national stage, with little awareness of how international human rights standards might support these struggles. Human Rights and Schooling explores the potential of human rights frameworks to support grassroots struggles for justice and examines the impact that human rights and child rights education can make in the lives of students, including the most marginalized. The author, Audrey Osler, examines the theory, research, and practice linking human rights to education in order to broaden the concept of citizenship and social studies education. Bringing scholarship and practice together, the text uses concrete examples to illustrate the links between principles and ideals and actual efforts to realize social justice in and through education. Osler anchors her examination of human rights in the U.N Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training.\n\n“Audrey Osler offers timely and relevant insights into education for human rights and social justice. The book examines complex global realities and the power of narrative to create a grounded and critical cosmopolitanism.”\n\n—Monisha Bajaj, associate professor, International and Multicultural Education, University of San Francisco\n\n“Educators specializing in social studies/civic education, multicultural, comparative, and/or social justice education will find Audrey Osler’s Human Rights and Schooling a fascinating read. It is filled with practical strategies for teaching about, in, and for human rights. In her wide-ranging discussion of concepts such as cosmopolitan citizenship, intersectionality and identity, and narrative, Osler draws on examples from across the globe to show how educators can foster solidarity with human rights struggles near and far as they empower youth to take action for social justice at home and abroad.”\n\n—Carole L.
