        "text": "My Journey\n\nby Alger Marsh\n\nI entered the world in Portland, Oregon on October 5, 1944. My parents were religious, though they didn’t love and follow Jesus like they did later on. Preceded by a brother and two sisters, I eased into a life of compliance, happy with the status quo. After four years, another sister arrived. I enjoyed our family.\n\nDad worked as a welder, and found a job working on the Fort Peck dam in Montana. From age 3 to 7, I found the sub-zero winters and hot summers delightful. Among my treasured memories are the times we four younger ones wrestled my brother Allen. He was strong and gentle – he always won, and it was fun. Merrie (the sister nearest my age) and I were close companions. One day we decided to tunnel through the snow to school: we didn’t get there until after lunch. Were we ever in trouble (but it sure was fun)!\n\nA few spots of pain are still vivid in my mind. At various times, we had dogs, cats, and other pets. One spring, when many kittens were just learning to walk, I ran outside, letting the screen door slam behind me. I heard a distressed meow and turned to see one of the kittens caught in the doorway, his neck badly injured. Soon, he died. I felt absolutely terrible! Dad had us all gather for a “funeral.” I now recognize his wisdom in helping me grieve that loss, including my feelings of self-accusation and misery.\n\nThe dam was completed, and Dad found a job in the shipyards of Bangor, Washington. We moved several times in the next couple of years, always close to Bangor. Living close to Grandma Marsh, our family began attending her church. Soon I became aware of a growing change in my parents, especially my Dad. He became more interested in God, and in enjoying his family. He began reading a chapter of the Bible and praying with the family each day. I also became aware that I sometimes wanted to do bad things, and tried to be sneaky about doing them. When I disobeyed and Dad disciplined me, I remember him sometimes saying, “This hurts me more than it does you.” I thought, “How could it?”\n\nA children’s evangelist came to our church, and our family faithfully attended the daily meetings. I think it was the last day of the meetings that I turned to Dad as the alter call was being given and asked, “Can I go up there?” Dad said we should get my little sister to bed, and then he would talk with me about what I was feeling. When we got home, I was tired, so I went right to bed. But in moments, Dad came and asked to have a talk with me. I got up, and at the big overstuffed chair in the living room, my Dad and I knelt as he led me to ask for forgiveness for my sins and receive Jesus into my heart. I don’t remember a big rush of feelings, but I was content as I went to sleep that night.\n\nHow little did I know the dramatic change that decision, made when I was eight years old, would have. Instead of wanting to be sneaky in doing bad things, I felt a desire to help people – even my parents. And I felt terrible when I did do something bad.\n\nWe moved to Seattle when I began sixth grade. Dad became sick with Rheumatic Fever and was flat on his back for six months. My part in helping the family was to take a morning Post Intelligencer route. Before long I was delivering two routes, and a year later was “shack manager,” responsible for stuffing the Sunday papers for the dozen or so routes at our shack.\n\nAllen became an international Bible Quiz champion. He loved God, and wasn’t embarrassed to show affection to his little brother, even in public. How I admired him. I could hardly wait until I was a teenager so I could be on a Bible quiz team, too. Finally, the year arrived: the book chosen for that year was Genesis. Allen was happy to help me learn how to be a champion quizzer. The first step, he said, was to memorize the book. I spent nearly every minute I could working on that memorizing. I took my Bible to school and asked my classmates to look up any verse and ask me a question about it, or to start reading a verse somewhere and see if I could finish the passage. Then Allen – and my quizmaster, I’m sure – taught me how to compare and contrast verses with each other, how to identify patterns and notice reoccurring actions or themes. I studied hard, simply desiring to be good at quizzing. But God surprised me: he hit my heart with new truths! He revealed to me that his purpose for choosing Abraham’s descendents to be his special, chosen people was so that all nations on earth would be able to recognize how wonderful He is, and everyone would come to love and worship Him. He began burdening my heart with the desire to partner with Him in revealing His story to people who have never had opportunity to hear it before. I wrestled with what that might mean – what would it look like? But God won my heart, and as I committed myself to go anywhere and do anything He would direct, I sensed a deep peace and joy filling my heart.\n\nMy high school years were fun, busy, and rewarding. We moved to Medford, Oregon. Having developed a habit of early rising, I found those hours excellent times to focus on God (and study for quizzing). I also got a number of before-school jobs. When I didn’t have a job, I worked on our vegetable garden in the early morning hours. I helped begin Youth For Christ in Medford High School. When other area schools had YFC clubs, we began interschool Bible quiz competition. Looking back, I can see that God protected me in many ways from the normal afflictions of teenagers: I was oblivious to the enticements of drugs or partying that led to a downhill path that many of my peers experienced.\n\nUpon graduating from Medford High School, I determined to follow in my brother’s footstep: I would attend Seattle Pacific College, then complete seminary, after that find a wife, and then be ready for the missions work that God would lead me to. It didn’t work that way!\n\nI worked as a janitor for the school as I attended college. One break week I logged 108 hours: my supervisor noted that my work was excellent, but told me not to work that much in a week again. I also led a college and careers Sunday School class that grew to over 100 people before dividing into two groups. When gospel outreach teams were formed, I was delighted to be chosen to be a preacher and leader of one of the teams. Music was a major part of our presentations.\n\nThrough all these things, God continued pruning and molding my life. During one discouraging period, I formed a “besetting sin.” The habit was strong before I took steps to break it. I would repent and say “God, I will never sin like that again!” I was stuck in Romans 7. Romans 8:2 seemed out of reach: For the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you through Christ Jesus from the power of sin that leads to death. Not until I confessed to a friend, asking him to hold me accountable in that area, did I begin making progress.\n\nI was one of a number of men in Moyer Hall that simply had no time for dating. One day, a group of women came to me and said, “Alger we have a problem: we would like to date, but lots of the truly godly men here don’t date anyone. The non-believers from other schools are coming over and asking us out, but we only want to date Christians. What can we do?” After talking it over with the guys in my dorm, we began the “date a quarter” club: each of us was required to have at least one date each quarter. Gloria was my date for the third quarter. Long story short, God knocked me over the head and let me know that His plan for me wasn’t what I had planned. We were married in Orangevale, near Sacramento, on June 25, 1965.\n\nI dropped to part time schooling to work full time. My draft number came up. My time with the Army in Vietnam in the First Air Cavalry brought more learning. Foremost was the friendship that four of us developed: a flaming charismatic, a devout Catholic, a solid Baptist, and a zealous Free Methodist (me). We all learned that denomination meant little out there. Our personal relationships with Jesus led us very close together, valuing one another’s walks with God.\n\nI returned to SPC, and Eric joined our family. At 5 ½ months, he still wasn’t sitting at all, or even rolling over. A friend stayed up all night praying for him, and the next day he sat solidly for over ½ hour! How we praised God for that miracle!\n\nI graduated with majors in Business and Economics. No missions opportunities showed up, so I took a job with Safeway Stores. I trained in Riverside, CA, for 7 months and was then appointed to be Ranch Cartoning Manager for Oregon and southern Washington. We bought a home in Oregon City, where Devin was born. We had some 440 stores in our district. God granted me favor, and in my three years there, our district won the “Golden Chicken” award for the best growth statistics for 10 of the 12 quarters!\n\nI wanted to do more with my life than provide safer eggs for people to eat. After much searching, I applied for a position as Christian Education Coordinator at a Lake Oswego Church. God taught me many lessons there! One was that as long as I allowed the children and youth to depend on me for their spiritual food, they would remain spiritual babies. God showed me some material and ways to help them learn to hear God’s voice for themselves. It was exciting to watch them grow!\n\nAfter three years, Gloria and I joined Wycliffe Bible Translators. We learned more lessons through our 11 years with them, 8 while in Papua New Guinea. We truly were a part of bringing the gospel to people who had never had opportunity to hear before. It was rewarding!\n\nGod indicated it was time for us to change our roles. We were to return to the USA to help prepare the Bride for the Bridegroom. We had no clue what that would look like, but we sold our home, turned our work over to others, and prepared to move back home. Five weeks before our departure, Eric disappeared from a birthday campout. He was missing for six days. It was an agonizing time. His body was found in the river. That story is told in the children’s coloring book Gloria wrote: Called Out. In all this, God’s grace was abundant, and we felt cared for and lifted on many people’s prayers.\n\nIt took over a year before Gloria and I realized we had “fallen into” what God wanted us to do. Devin was the key to it all. He asked us if we could take one hurting friend into our home, then another. One day, we realized we were involved in reparenting people who had not been able to grow up in a healthy way “the first time.” We had some 50 people live with us for 6 months to 3 years over the next 15 years. It was slow, hard work, but most of those people evidenced wonderful growth, both in self-esteem and in spiritual life. During this time, we identified many “tools” that significantly sped up the freeing, healing process.\n\nBelieving that at some point God will flood the church with new believers, we began praying for a faster, more effective way to help people get rid of the things holding them back from the abundant, joy-filled life God has promised His people. He brought us to a pattern of intensive workshops. We call them Heart Workshops. As we continue to learn and grow, God is showing up in more powerful, miraculous ways. He heals everything: bodies, emotions, spirits, relationships …\n\nDevin married Andrea, and they have given us two delightful grandchildren: Jacob and Michaya. Devin served six years in the Airforce. Now “Dr. Marsh” is a civilian, counseling military personnel and their families. He and his family love God, and we enjoy the times we have together. Could life be better?!!\n\nI believe I have finally arrived at the work God planned for me from before my birth. I am thrilled with the people He has brought around us, the victories He consistently provides, the transformations I see taking place in so many lives, including my own. I am thrilled to be working with House of Myrrh Ministries! Check us out at http://www.heartchange.org.\n\nBut then, I might be wrong: God just might have something else for me to do “next.” I’ll keep listening.\n\nAlger Marsh, algglo@integrity.com"
