        "text": "Copeland: Gloria passed away suddenly on Sunday, February 5th 2024 at Four Counties Health Services, Newbury. at the age of 86. Born in Tichbourne Ont. in Frontenac County, daughter to the late Georgina Jean-Marie and Wilfred Jean-Marie and Step Father V. Alvin “Bud” Esseltine. Beloved wife of the Late Fred Copeland (2020) and predeceased by her first husband William “Bill” Marsh (1958). Loving Mother to William “Jerry” Marsh and Kelley Marsh. Grandmother and “Nanny” to Jason Beamish (Katharine), Brandon Marsh (Annika), Mackenzie Marsh (Aaron), Great Grandmother to Kaius and Stevie.

Gloria taught grades 1,2 and 3 for over 30 years at Saint Ignatius School in Bothwell. She was an original member of the Bothwell Slow Girls Hockey League, where she played well into her 60’s. A proud member of the Wardsville, Golf and Country Club, her smooth golf swing with her little bounce was absolutely beautiful. She always’s hit it right up the middle, her three holes in one will attest to that!. She served on the ladies league executive and ran many tournaments. She was an Inaugural member of the Wardsville Girl Guide troop and was instrumental in starting minor baseball in Wardsville. From bowling to badminton to golf, she always competed hard and encouraged others to join in. Gloria was a member and drummer in the Argyle Pipe Band of West Lorne, the Marsh-McMaster Pipe Band of Bothwell and the Campbell Pipe Band of Ridgetown. Acted as President of the Bothwell Legion Ladies Auxiliary. Gloria was an avid reader. Belonging to many book clubs, she was eager to hear fresh perspectives on the latest novel. Gloria will be remembered as the kind, welcoming and loving woman that could often be found enjoying her time on her deck with a glass of wine with her wonderful friends. Saturday nights were spent screaming “GET IT OUT OF THERE”! at the TV watching her beloved Hab’s play on Hockey Night in Canada. She went back to U.W.O. to complete her Bachelor’s Degree in Art History at the age of 50. Gloria lived with a thirst for knowledge and kept up with the daily puzzles and word games up till the end. With all of her accomplishments in her life, she had one thing on her bucket list that she never got to accomplish, Gloria never got to drop the “F bomb”, she just never got the chance. Her life inspired so many of us in our little towns. She was the best friend to so many and her memory will be cherished forever. Gloria's wishes where to be cremated. A Celebration of Gloria's Life will be held at the Bothwell Legion Br.#252, 162 George St, Bothwell, ON on Sunday February 18, 2024 from 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM. Donations to the Four Counties Health Services Foundation (c/o 1824 Concession Dr, Newbury, ON N0L 1Z0) would be appreciated. Online condolences and donations may be left at www.badderfuneralhomes.com. Arrangements entrusted to the Badder & Robinson Funeral Home, Bothwell"
