Forbidden the use of their language yet still the voice of her parents, she lives between the worlds of deaf and hearing. Not fully belonging to either, she follows her singular path to uncover and to find her own voice.\n\n“It’s rare that we get to see a play that puts the life of the Deaf – and specifically, the experiences of hearing children born to Deaf parents – front and center.”– Lisa Strum, Assistant producer Jersey City Theater Center\n\nShow Description\n\nShows about the Deaf are indeed rare: Children of a Lesser God; Spring Awakening; Tribes. Shows about Codas (Children of Deaf Adults) even more so. ​Gloria Rosen was raised as a non-signing Coda, making this story unique even within that community.\n\n​W​elcome to Gloria’s childhood home where ringing telephones and doorbells light up the house, watching TV requires great feats of concentration and a little girl becomes the world’s first lip-syncher. Come on in and meet all the many characters wandering in and out of this tale causing much havoc and joy!\n\nListen…Can You Hear Me Now? explores the vital importance of family communication through experiences that are fun and frustrating and fierce Gloria’s vision and goal is to explore and bring to light the very special and largely unknown worlds of the Coda and Deaf Communities and to bring the Deaf, Coda and hearing worlds closer together in an alliance of mutual trust and understanding.\n\nArtists Biographies\n\nGloria Rosen is an award winning playwright and actor.
