        "text": "Olds Year Two: RA Edition\n\nI spent my first year at Hillsdale living in Olds Dormitory and experienced connected community, loving friends, and vibrant social outlets there. I wanted to continue that experience and share it with the incoming freshmen.\n\nRead More about Olds Year Two: RA Edition\n\nBaker Unknown: The Enduring Tradition of Waterman Tea\n\nWeekly tea at Waterman Dorm spans the last decade or more. No one quite knows when it began, but before the weekly tea there was an annual party at Waterman open to all of campus.\n\nRead More about Baker Unknown: The Enduring Tradition of Waterman Tea\n\nComfort Ye My People\n\nThis was the year of “Messiah,” sung every four years at the College, and we were glad to have the chance to sing something so glorious.\n\nRead More about Comfort Ye My People\n\nCultivating Friendships That Will Last A Lifetime\n\nBy the end of freshman year, I had developed a close bond with several girls living on the upper west side of McIntyre Residence, so much so that we did not want to leave it behind come sophomore year. Koon Residence allowed us to keep our community.\n\nRead More about Cultivating Friendships That Will Last A Lifetime\n\nWe are Upper West\n\nFrom the excitement of freshman convocation to a budding sense of homesickness at the overwhelming number of strangers, to the anxiousness of already having a thick pile of reading due by Monday, the first week of college was nothing like I’d ever experienced. I found sanctuary in my suitemates’ room in the Upper West hallway of McIntyre Dormitory.\n\nRead More about We are Upper West\n\nTime for a Study Break\n\nThere comes a point in every college student’s week when a fifteen-minute break scrolling through Instagram just does not cut it. Because we are no exception to this rule, here is a list of the myriad activities that both the College and city provide students who need relief from the rigor of Hillsdale College academics.\n\nRead More about Time for a Study Break\n\nAll About Hospitality\n\nAs soon as I walk in the door, I am struck by Sue Postle’s love for Benzing. She’s bubbly and incredibly warm, and she can’t stop talking about how much the dorm’s residents mean to her.\n\nRead More about All About Hospitality\n\nCommunity, Service, and Tradition at the “Quiet” Dorm\n\nAfter Niedfeldt’s impressive showing in the Spirit Week competitions, I asked Head RA Sam Clausen to give some insight on how a quiet dorm comes up with such notable performances.\n\nRead More about Community, Service, and Tradition at the “Quiet” Dorm\n\nTo Parents, Teachers, Friends, and Donors – Thank You\n\nCollege life the week before Thanksgiving Break would be like one really long run-on sentence of last-minute meetings and assignments if the Student Activities Board and 1844 Society didn’t conspire together to insert a dash of gratitude into our lives.\n\nRead More about To Parents, Teachers, Friends, and Donors – Thank You\n\nGalloway’s “No Man Left Behind” Mentality\n\n“We try to emphasize the ‘no man left behind’ mentality,” said Calvin, a resident assistant in Galloway Dormitory. “Everyone knows everyone, and everyone includes everyone. If I am leaving to go do something on campus, I will stop by other guys’ rooms to see if they want to come along.”\n\nRead More about Galloway’s “No Man Left Behind” Mentality\n\nIntramural Football: Bringing Back the Glory Days\n\nNowhere does tradition run as deep as it does in the Hillsdale College IM Football League. (It’s hyperbole, people. The Western tradition obviously runs deeper.) On weeknights in the fall, students from all over campus meet under the lights on the football field to compete.\n\nDiscover Hillsdale in the Fall\n\nIt’s hard to stay inside as leaves whirl before the warm October wind. It’s like the blue skies are raining gold. The beautiful weather this autumn has made it the perfect opportunity to explore Hillsdale and the surrounding countryside.\n\nRead More about Discover Hillsdale in the Fall"
