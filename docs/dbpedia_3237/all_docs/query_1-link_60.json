        "text": "The Obsession\n\nHe started on his obsession in 2007 when he met M S Dhoni, Indian One-Day Captain. “My entire journey started with M S Dhoni and even today it revolves around him. He had come down along with team the for a training camp. I ended up meeting not only him, but the entire cricket team and since then I have not stopped”. Even to this day Dhoni and many others recognise him and can spot him in a crowd.\n\nAt the recent test series between India and England in Chennai for example, Pranav met the entire English team and had a memorable chat with Joe Root. “I showed Joe Root the ticket of his debut game in India a few years back. He was very happy and chatted with me for a while. I told him that he would make a century in this series, but he fell short by a few runs,” says Pranav.\n\nPranav also met the all-time great England all-rounder Ian Botham. “It’s very difficult to meet Ian Botham, but I managed to catch him in the hotel lobby he was staying at and asked him for his 60 seconds. He told me he was busy and asked me to wait for one hour. Finally, he met me and I got a lot of things signed. I also met Michael Atherton and Nasir Hussian,” he says. All of these cricket greats were commentators at the series. He also met other England players such as James Anderson, Keating Jennings and Stuart Broad.\n\nOpening a Gallery\n\nPranav has a collection of signed jerseys, wickets from important matches, historic match tickets photos with rear cricketers that would make and any fan green with envy. This includes photos with C D Gopinath, one of the oldest former Indian cricketers, Chaminda Vaas, former Sri Lankan pacer’s World Cup, 1996 final jersey in which Sri Lanka won the cup.\n\nDhoni’s 2009 ODI jersey, Sadananda Vishwanath’s final Benson and Hedges’s jersey from the 1985 finals between India and Pakistan, the wicket from the Rothman Cup final, 1986 where Pakistan’s Imran Khan took 6 wickets.\n\nWith such a collection it’s but obvious that Pranav has started thinking about opening a gallery to house his collections. “My collection runs into thousands of memorabilia since 2007. I want to start something big with it, something that the entire country and the worked would notice. I hope to open this gallery soon,” he says."
