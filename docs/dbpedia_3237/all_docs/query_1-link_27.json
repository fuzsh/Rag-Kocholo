        "text": "CricInfo: You went to England in 1986. It is another remarkable series because it's the last time India won a series abroad, but you didn't play that series...\n\nShivlal Yadav: Not playing in the Test matches was a big disappointment for me. Having got the highest number of wickets in the three Test matches in Australia, I don't get a game to play. But the team did well and we won the series 2-0, which is a remarkable achievement. But this is part and parcel of the game. [Audio]\n\nCI: Allan Border came to India with a very young team in 1986-87. What are your memories of the Tied Test match in Madras in which you were very much part of the team?\n\nSY: Well, actually the game started on a very slow note. It was a good Test wicket. The wicket was helping the batsman initially for the first three days and then on the last two days it was a slow turner with the spinners able to get some purchase out of it. It so happened that the Australians gave us a challenging declaration which prompted us to go for the runs on the last day. The run chase started on a good note though we kept losing wickets. So the chase was on even till the last wicket. The biggest winner of the match was the game and credit should go the game itself. [Audio]\n\nCI: In 1987 against Pakistan, you picked up your 100th wicket at Ahmedabad in the same match that Sunil Gavaskar got his 10,000th run. You seem to have this knack of being attached to the big moments in Indian cricket.\n\nSY: My 100 wickets was forgotten totally because getting 10,000 runs for Sunil was a greater achievement and he did it in style. It was a proud moment for me to be associated with that particular Test match because getting hundred wickets is not that big a milestone. But It was a memorable match for me and I will always remember that. [Audio]\n\nCI: You finished your career with 102 wickets, did you think you still had some cricket left in you at international level?\n\nSY: When you give up, you always feel that you have some game left in you. But one day or other you have to quit. It is a difficult and painful decision but one has to accept the facts of life amd make room for others. It was painful for me but I had to take a decision. [Audio]\n\nCI: You had a long career and came across many different batsmen. Who was the most difficult among them you bowled to?\n\nSY: When it comes to batting, to me straightaway the most difficult batsman to bowl is Viv Richards. Why I would say this is because he never allowed the bowler to dominate. I remember in the fourth Test match in Bombay in 1983-84, I think I had taken two wickets in two balls and was on a hat trick. He came just before lunch and hit me for three boundaries which goes to show his confidence. Though he could have got out playing those shots, still he always wanted to dominate. [Audio]\n\nCI: Coming to modern cricket, things have changed so much in the last twenty years. Australia is dominating today's cricket. You have played them in the 70s and in 80s and played a total of four series against them. What are your thoughts on Australian cricket?\n\nSY: Basically, you see that right from Jim Laker's time to the recent players, the Australians are a little suspect against off spin, good off spin bowling. If you see, India's Erapalli Prasanna, England's John Emburey and Geoff Miller have done well and I have taken 51 wickets in 13 matches against Australians. So, basically I feel that they are little suspect. I am sure if given a chance, in the present team Harbhajan Singh should make use of their weakness [Audio]\n\nCI: You were the last Indian off spinner to take 100 Test wickets for India. Why hasn't anyone achieved it since?\n\nSY: One reason could be that far too many one day matches are being played, so any bowler who tries to experiment doesn't have a long life. But you can't think a batsman out by bowling tight all the time. You've got to vary your line, length, flight, trajectory... [Audio]\n\nCI: You come from a place like Hyderabad which has produced so many elegant players like Jaisimha and Azharuddin with whom you have played. What are your memories of Hyderabad cricket?\n\nSY: Hyderabad cricket is absolutely on a strong footing. Basically, our school cricket is very active and you are well aware that recently we have had a AT Rayadu and Abhinav who are doing well and so also Anoop Pai. School cricket is the supply line. When you have a supply line like that, your future is definitely going to be good. You know the players will keep on coming one by one. Sometimes you have ordinary or average players and sometimes you have brilliant players. But basically what we have to see is the supply is on. And as the secretary of HCA, I feel that our cricket is on a very sound note. [Audio]\n\nCI: In the 90s, you turned to administration. There is always the debate whether good players can be good administrators.? What are your thoughts on this?\n\nWell It all depends on how much time one gives to the game. As a player, you have to practice hard, may be four or five hours a day. But as an administrator, you have to give more time to the game, attend your duties and see that all matches are done. Again as a player, you are only concerned about getting the opposition out as a bowler and how to win the game, but as an administrator you have to manage, you have to look after several things right from the arrival of the team to the departure of the team, issues like conduct of the match, transportation, lunch, accommodation etc. Therefore it's a different ball game altogether. But if one is prepared to give time, I am sure that you can do both job s with equal sincerity. [Audio]\n\nCI: You had a long stint as a national selector. How difficult is the job of being a selector in India?\n\nSY: Well, it is quite difficult mainly because India is such a big country, you have to travel the length and breadth of the country to look for talent. But luckily our system is so well organized. As selectors we go and watch the Ranji Trophy games and the other matches. Here you could find the right talents. I am a selector from the South and so I would know the boys from that area more easily. I can recognize them and spot talent. I can keep track of their performances. It was an interesting job and I enjoyed it. If it comes to me again I would love to do it. [Audio]\n\nCI: In women's cricket, they have decided to scrap selectors on the zonal basis and have gone in for three selectors. In men's cricket, five selectors go around the country. Should we stick to the zonal system? What is your personal opinion on this issue?\n\nSY: As I told you, India is a big country. Five selectors are not able to do the job properly. Instead of five, you should increase the number of selectors rather than making it come down. Because if you are aware, even Tripura is playing cricket these days. Assam is coming up and Kerela has done well. Therefore in a country like India, even five selectors are not sufficient since they have to travel and see so many matches. So I don't see the reason why it should be brought down or changed for the five member selection committee has produced players from Vijay Merchant to Vijay Manjrekar to Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar. So bring some more junior selectors and some more people who can be involved, so that they can give te feedback to the senior selectors.\n\nCI: There is a view that the zonal system should be changed.\n\nSY: There is nothing wrong with the zonal system, the matches are still being played on the zonal system, so I don't see any reason why it should be changed. [Audio]\n\nCI: You son Arjun played in the Under 19 series against England. He bowled a bit of off spin but he's more of a batsman, isnt he?"
