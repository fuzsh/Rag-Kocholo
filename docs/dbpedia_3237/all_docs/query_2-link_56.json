        "text": "Venkataraghaven, having led India briefly on the fruitless 1975 World Cup campaign, saw the captaincy taken from him and passed on to Bedi. After a shared series in New Zealand, India was faced with the challenge of meeting the mighty West Indies team in a four-Test series. India made a disastrous start, but Bedi rallied the team to have the best of the drawn second Test match and win the third. Following torrential rain, the third Test had been shifted from Georgetown to Port of Spain where the Queens Park Oval pitch gave some assistance in turning the ball but the West Indies trio of spinners were unable to prevent India reaching a huge target; in future they would rely on an all-pace attack. This victory at Port-of-Spain was historic; India became only the second team to score 400 in the fourth innings to win a Test match.\n\nWest Indies then won the final Test at Kingston with India protesting that the fast bowlers were using intimidating tactics against them.Bedi declared his first innings closed at 306-6 in protest, and was thought to have done the same in the second innings at 97-5 but in fact there was no-one left to come in because five men were unable to bat because of injury.\n\nIndia had come to the Caribbean from a gentler three-Test series in New Zealand.Gavaskar arrived late in the West Indies because of an operation for a fractured cheekbone received in New Zealand.\n\nDespite the eventful Test series, West Indies Board could not entice enough spectators through the gates to watch, and suffered a loss of approximately £17,000 on the tour.\n\nâ¢Surinder Amarnath scored a Test century on debut (124 at Auckland), as his father had done in 1933.\n\nâ¢Surinder added 204 in a second wicket partnership with Sunil Gavaskar (116)\n\nâ¢ Prasanna took 8 wickets for 74 runs in the 2nd innings at Auckland to win the match.\n\nâ¢ Syed Kirmani took six catches and a stumping in the innings at Christchurch, equalling the Test record\n\nâ¢Gavaskar (156) and Brijesh Patel (115*)\n\nâ¢ India were set 403 runs to win at Port of Spain. Only Australia in 1948 had reached such a target before\n\nâ¢ Chandrasekhar took 21 wickets in the four match series (average 31.2)"
