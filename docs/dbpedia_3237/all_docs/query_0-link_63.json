In particular, this work aims to provide a set of optimal FF processing parameters for the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) mission. The S6-MF satellite carries an advanced radar altimeter offering a wide range of potential FF-based applications which are just beginning to be explored and require prior optimization of this processing. In S6-MF, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter acquisitions are known to be aliased in the along-track direction. Depending on the target, aliasing can be tolerated or may be a severe impairment to provide the level of performance expected from FF processing. Another key aspect to consider in this optimization study is the unprecedented resolution of the FF processing, which results in a higher posting rate than the standard SAR processing. This work investigates the relationship between posting rate and noise levels and provides recommendations for optimal algorithm configurations in various scenarios, including transponder, open ocean, and specular targets like sea-ice and inland water scenes. The Omega–Kappa (WK) algorithm, which has demonstrated superior CPU efficiency compared to the back-projection (BP) algorithm, is considered for this study. But, unlike BP, it operates in the Doppler frequency domain, necessitating further precise spectral and time domain settings. Based on the results of this work, real case studies using S6-MF acquisitions are presented. We first compare S6-MF FF radargrams with Sentinel-1 (S1) images to showcase the potential of optimally configured FF processing. For highly specular surfaces such as sea-ice, distinct techniques are employed for lead signature identification. S1 relies on image-based lineic reconstruction, while S6-MF utilizes phase coherency of focalized pulses for lead detection. The study also delves into two-dimensional wave spectra derived from the amplitude modulation of image/radargrams, with a focus on a coastal example. This case is especially intriguing, as it vividly illustrates different sea states characterized by varying spectral peak positions over time.

Nonetheless, owing to the inherent uncertainties embedded within remote sensing imagery, LC datasets inevitably exhibit inaccuracies. In this study, a local accuracy assessment of LC datasets in Southwest China was conducted. The datasets utilized in our analysis include ESA WorldCover, CLCD, Esri Land Cover, CRLC, FROM-GLC10, GLC_FCS30, GlobeLand30, and SinoLC-1. This study employed a sampling approach that combines proportional allocation and stratified random sampling (SRS) to gather sample points and compute confusion matrices to validate eight LC products. The local accuracy of the eight LC maps differs significantly from the overall accuracy provided by the original authors in Southwest China. ESA WorldCover and CLCD demonstrate higher local accuracy than other products in Southwest China, with their overall accuracy (OA) values being 87.1% and 85.48%, respectively. Simultaneously, we computed the area for each LC map based on categories, quantifying uncertainty through the reporting of confidence intervals for both accuracy and area parameters. This study aims to validate and compare eight LC datasets and assess precision and area of diverse spatial resolution datasets for mapping and monitoring across Southwest China.

One effective approach to mitigating these events involves incorporating more green infrastructure into the cityscape. The ecological services provided by urban vegetation play a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability and livability of cities. However, monitoring urban vegetation and accurately estimating its status pose challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of the urban environment. In response to this, the current study proposes utilizing a remote sensing-based classification framework to enhance data availability, thereby improving practices related to urban vegetation management. The aim of the current research is to explore the spatial pattern of vegetation and enhance the classification of tree species within diverse and complex urban environments. This study combines various remote sensing observations to enhance classification capabilities. High-resolution colored rectified aerial photographs, LiDAR-derived products, and hyperspectral data are merged and analyzed using advanced classifier methods, specifically partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and object-based image analysis (OBIA). The OBIA method demonstrates an impressive overall accuracy of 95.30%, while the PLS-DA model excels with a remarkable overall accuracy of 100%. The findings validate the efficacy of incorporating OBIA, aerial photographs, LiDAR, and hyperspectral data in improving tree species classification and mapping within the context of PLS-DA. This classification framework holds significant potential for enhancing management practices and tools, thereby optimizing the ecological services provided by urban vegetation and fostering the development of sustainable cities.

However, the ecological impacts or improvements of the PPG&GP projects and their daily operations on the local environment are still unclear. To solve these problems, this study retrieved the ground deformation velocities and time series of the study region by performing the Small-Baseline Subset (SBAS)-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR and Sentinel-1 SAR datasets. With these deformation results, the spatial analysis indicated that the area of the subsidence region within the PPG&GP projects reached 10.70 km2, with a magnitude of approximately −21.61 ± 12.10 mm/yr. Also, even though the ground deformations and their temporal changes were both visible in the construction and operation stages of the PPG&GP projects, the temporal analysis demonstrated that most observation points finally entered into the stationary phases in the late stage of the observation period. This phenomenon validated the effectiveness of the PPG&GP projects in enhancing the ground surface stability in coal-mining areas. Additionally, the precipitation, geological structure, increased coal-mining depths, and emergent agricultural modes were assumed to be the major impact factors controlling the ground deformation within the local PPG&GP projects. Finally, a novel risk assessment method with a designed index of IRA was utilized to classify the ground subsidence risks of the PPG&GP projects into three levels: Low (69.7%), Medium (16.9%), and High (9.4%). This study sheds a bright light on the ecological monitoring and risk management of the burgeoning industrial and agricultural infrastructures, such as the PPG&GP projects, constructed upon the traditional coal-mining areas in China from a multi-temporal InSAR perspective.

However, current detection methods face significant challenges in complex scenes, such as inaccurate background estimation, inability to distinguish targets from similar non-target points, and poor robustness across various scenes. To address these issues, this study presents a novel spatial–temporal tensor model for infrared small target detection. In our method, we introduce the tensor tree rank to capture global structure in a more balanced strategy, which helps achieve more accurate background estimation. Meanwhile, we design a novel self-adaptive local prior weight by evaluating the level of clutter and noise content in the image. It mitigates the imbalance between target enhancement and background suppression. Then, the spatial–temporal total variation (STTV) is used as a joint regularization term to help better remove noise and obtain better detection performance. Finally, the proposed model is efficiently solved by the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance when compared with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of target enhancement, background suppression, and robustness across various complex scenes. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each module in the proposed model.

Understanding how urban transportation and mobility are affected by spatial planning is vital. Urban vibrancy, as a crucial metric for monitoring urban development, contributes to data-driven planning and sustainable growth. However, empirical studies on the relationship between urban vibrancy and the built environment in European cities remain limited, lacking consensus on the contribution of the built environment. This study employs Munich as a case study, utilizing night-time light, housing prices, social media, points of interest (POIs), and NDVI data to measure various aspects of urban vibrancy while constructing a comprehensive assessment framework. Firstly, the spatial distribution patterns and spatial correlation of various types of urban vibrancy are revealed. Concurrently, based on the 5Ds built environment indicator system, the multi-dimensional influence on urban vibrancy is investigated. Subsequently, the Geodetector model explores the heterogeneity between built environment indicators and comprehensive vibrancy along with its economic, social, cultural, and environmental dimensions, elucidating their influence mechanism. The results show the following: (1) The comprehensive vibrancy in Munich exhibits a pronounced uneven distribution, with a higher vibrancy in central and western areas and lower vibrancy in northern and western areas. High-vibrancy areas are concentrated along major roads and metro lines located in commercial and educational centers. (2) Among multiple models, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model demonstrates the highest explanatory efficacy on the relationship between the built environment and vibrancy. (3) Economic, social, and comprehensive vibrancy are significantly influenced by the built environment, with substantial positive effects from the POI density, building density, and road intersection density, while mixed land use shows little impact. (4) Interactions among built environment factors significantly impact comprehensive vibrancy, with synergistic interactions among the population density, building density, and POI density generating positive effects. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the resource allocation and functional layout in Munich, emphasizing the complex spatiotemporal relationship between the built environment and urban vibrancy while offering crucial guidance for planning.

This study established a seasonal aerosol model based on data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of the sea area around eastern China, and its performance in calculating the aerosol optical depth (AOD) was evaluated. The seasonal columnar volume particle size distributions (VPSDs) illustrated a bimodal structure consisting of fine and coarse modes. The VPSDs of spring, autumn, and winter roughly agreed with each other, with their amplitudes of fine and coarse modes being almost equal; however, the fine mode of the summer VPSD was approximately twice as high as that of the coarse mode. Lognormal mode decomposition analysis revealed that fine and coarse modes comprised two sub-modes. Fitting the seasonal VPSDs to the four-mode lognormal distribution yielded a parameterized aerosol size distribution model. Furthermore, seasonal variations in complex refractive indices (CRIs) indicated unignorable changes in aerosol compositions. Overall, error analysis validated that the proposed model could meet accuracy requirements for optical engineering applications, with median AOD calculation errors of less than 0.01.

In particular, because the water temperature observation along hot water mass transportation is hard work. Acoustic tomography is an advanced method to measure water temperature variations via sound signal transmission with multi-station network sensing. The 5 kHz frequency acoustic tomography used for observing water temperature variations caused by ocean heat waves is interesting work. In this paper, the numerical simulation of hot water mass is completed first, then floatation and diffusion of hot water mass in a simulation are monitored by acoustic tomography. A new inversion optimization method is proposed to obtain hot water mass transportation variations at two-dimensional temperature vertical profile. The proposed inversion method adds a regularized mode matrix and the optimization method adds the model correlation matrix to improve the results quality.

This paper addresses these critical aspects by introducing an advanced analytical model for assessing the Doppler power spectra of convex quadric revolution bodies during precession. Our model is instrumental in calculating the Doppler shifts pertinent to both precession and swing cones. Additionally, it extends to delineate the Doppler power spectra for configurations involving cones and sphere–cone combinations. A key aspect of our study is the exploration of the effects exerted by geometric parameters and observation angles on the Doppler spectra, offering a comparative perspective of various micro-motion forms. The simulations distinctly demonstrate how different micro-motion patterns of a cone influence the Doppler power spectra and underscore the significance of geometric parameters and observational angles in shaping these spectra. This research not only contributes to enhancing LIDAR target identification methodologies but also lays a groundwork for future explorations into complex micro-motions like nutation.

The rapidly evolving bloom required equally rapid management response, leading to the use of near-real-time image analysis of chlorophyll from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) aboard Sentinel-3. Standard algorithms failed to adequately capture the bloom, signifying a need to refine a two-band algorithm developed for coastal and inland waters that relates the red-edge part of the remote sensing reflectance spectrum to chlorophyll. While the bloom was the initial motivation for optimizing this algorithm, an extensive dataset of in-water validation measurements from both bloom and non-bloom periods was used to evaluate performance over a range of concentrations and community composition. The modified red-edge algorithm with a simplified atmospheric correction scheme outperformed existing standard products across diverse conditions, and given the modest computational requirements, was found suitable for operational use and near-real-time product generation. The final version of the algorithm successfully minimizes error for non-bloom periods when chlorophyll a is typically <30 mg m−3, while also capturing bloom periods of >100 mg m−3 chlorophyll a.

The main challenge is represented by the difficulty of separating hot and cold pixels in areas where their temperatures are quite similar. This task is indeed much simpler, for example, for lava flows where the temperature differences between the hot lava and the cold soil is rather big. This paper shows various software developed in order to perform this extraction and calculate the trends over time of both the average temperature and the heat flux from the soil. This prototypal implementation used thermal flights performed over a time span of a few years on an area in the Campi Flegrei caldera in southern Italy. Standard image manipulation techniques were used to segmentate and clusterise each thermal mapping in order to reduce the thermal anomalies to some sets of simpler features characterised by their fundamental parameters. The temporal trends of some physical parameters (temperature, heat flux, etc.) were extracted from these sets, and we found interesting results necessary for correlations and for ongoing research with other parameters.

In response to this issue, this study introduces a novel method for classifying sea ice during the Bohai Sea’s melting period. The method categorizes sea ice into five types: open water (OW), gray ice (Gi), melting gray ice (GiW), gray–white Ice (Gw), and melting gray–white Ice (GwW). To achieve this classification, 51 polarimetric features are extracted from L-, S-, and C-band PolSAR data using various polarization decomposition methods. This study assesses the separability of these features among different combinations of sea-ice type by calculating the Euclidean distance (ED). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, when employed with single-frequency polarimetric feature sets, achieves the highest accuracy for OW and Gi in the C-band, GiW in the S-band, and Gw and GwW in the L-band. Remarkably, the C-band features exhibit the overall highest accuracy when compared to the L-band and S-band. Furthermore, employing a multi-dimensional polarimetric feature set significantly improves classification accuracy to 94.55%, representing a substantial enhancement of 9% to 22% compared to single-frequency classification. Benefiting from the performance advantages of Random Forest (RF) classifiers in handling large datasets, RF classifiers achieve the highest classification accuracy of 95.84%. The optimal multi-dimensional feature composition includes the following: L-band: SE, SEI, α¯, Span; S-band: SEI, SE, Span, PV-Freeman, λ1, λ2; C-band: SE, SEI, Span, λ3, PV-Freeman. The results of this study provide a reliable new method for future sea-ice monitoring during the melting season.

This paper addresses the simultaneous detection requirements of multiple substances in the ultraviolet range of Venus’ atmosphere and proposes a multi-channel hyperspectral imaging system design using pupil separation prisms and grating multilevel spectra. The system achieves a multi-channel design by splitting the entrance pupil of the telescope using prisms. Spectra from different channels are diffracted to the same detector through different orders of the grating. The system features a single spectrometer and detector, enabling simultaneous detection of spectra from different channels. It also boasts advantages such as compact size, ultra-high spectral resolution, and simultaneous multi-channel detection. The system design results indicate that within the working spectral range of three channels, the spectral resolution is better than 0.15 nm, surpassing previous in-orbit or current in-orbit planetary atmospheric detection spectrometers. With a Nyquist frequency of 56 lp/mm, the full-field MTF exceeds 0.7. The system’s smile is less than 0.05 μm, and the keystone is less than 0.04 μm, meeting the requirements for imaging quality.

With the adoption of a megacity (Changchun) in northeast China, we analysed the vertical characteristics of aerosols and the causes of aerosol pollution throughout the year using multisource data for providing recommendations for controlling pollution events (i.e., straw burning and fireworks). Based on a ground-based LiDAR, it was found that the extinction coefficient (EC) of aerosols at a height of 300 m in Changchun was highest in winter (0.44 km−1), followed by summer (0.28 km−1), with significant differences from those in warmer regions, such as the Yangtze River Delta. Therefore, it is recommended that air pollution control policies be differentiated between winter and summer. On Chinese New Year’s Eve in Changchun, the ignition of firecrackers during the day and night caused increases in the EC at a height of 500 m to 0.37 and 0.88 km−1, respectively. It is suggested that the regulation of firecracker ignition should be reduced during the day and strengthened at night. Based on the CALIPSO and backward trajectory analysis results, two events of dust–biomass-burning composite pollution were observed in March and April. In March, the primary aerosol component was dust from western Changchun, whereas in April, the main aerosol component was biomass-burning aerosols originating from northern and eastern Changchun. Hence, reducing the intensity of spring biomass burning can mitigate the occurrence of dust–biomass-burning composite pollution. These findings can provide emission policy suggestions for areas facing similar issues regarding biomass-burning transmission pollution and firework emissions.

However, it also faces challenges such as resource limitations in spaceborne environments and significant uncertainty in the intensity of interference in application scenarios. These factors make the performance evaluation of object detection key to ensuring the smooth execution of tasks. In the face of such complex and harsh application scenarios, methods that rely on single-dimensional evaluation to assess models have had their limitations highlighted. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation method for deep learning models used in SAR image object detection. This method evaluates models in a multi-dimensional manner, covering the training, testing, and application stages of the model, and constructs a multi-dimensional evaluation index system. The training stage includes assessing training efficiency and the impact of training samples; the testing stage includes model performance evaluation, application-based evaluation, and task-based evaluation; and the application stage includes model operation evaluation and model deployment evaluation. The evaluations of these three stages constitute the key links in the performance evaluation of deep learning models. Furthermore, this paper proposes a multi-indicator comprehensive evaluation method based on entropy weight correlation scaling, which calculates the weights of each evaluation indicator through test data, thereby providing a balanced and comprehensive evaluation mechanism for model performance. In the experiments, we designed specific interferences for SAR images in the testing stage and tested three models from the YOLO series. Finally, we constructed a multi-dimensional performance profile diagram for deep learning object detection models, providing a new visualization method to comprehensively characterize model performance in complex application scenarios. This can provide more accurate and comprehensive model performance evaluation for remote sensing data processing, thereby guiding model selection and optimization. The evaluation method proposed in this study adopts a multi-dimensional perspective, comprehensively assessing the three core stages of a model’s lifecycle: training, testing, and application. This framework demonstrates significant versatility and adaptability, enabling it to transcend the boundaries of remote sensing technology and provide support for a wide range of model evaluation and optimization tasks.

The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) aboard the second generation of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS−SG) is the first operational submillimeter wave radiometer used for ice cloud remote sensing. Ice clouds simultaneously contain three species of ice hydrometeors—ice, snow, and graupel—the physical distributions and submillimeter wave radiation characteristics of which differ. Therefore, jointly retrieving the mass parameters of the three ice hydrometeors from submillimeter brightness temperatures is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a multiple species of ice hydrometeor parameters retrieval algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can jointly retrieve the total content and vertical profiles of ice, snow, and graupel particles from submillimeter brightness temperatures. The training dataset is generated by a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model and a submillimeter wave radiative transfer (RT) model. In this study, an end to end ICI simulation experiment involving forward modeling of the brightness temperature and retrieval of ice cloud parameters was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CNN retrieval algorithm. Compared with the classical Unet, the average relative errors of the improved RCNN–ResUnet are reduced by 11%, 25%, and 18% in GWP, IWP, and SWP retrieval, respectively. Compared with Bayesian Monte Carlo integration algorithm, the average relative error of the total content retrieved by RCNN–ResUnet is reduced by 71%. Compared with BP neural network algorithm, the average relative error of the vertical profiles retrieved by RCNN–ResUnet is reduced by 69%. In addition, this algorithm was applied to actual Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) 183 GHz observed brightness temperatures to retrieve graupel particle parameters with a relative error in the total content of less than 25% and a relative error in the profile of less than 35%. The results show that the proposed CNN algorithm can be applied to future space borne submillimeter wave radiometers to jointly retrieve mass parameters of ice, snow, and graupel.

Compared to synthetic aperture radar (SAR), polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) provides richer information for analyzing the scattering mechanisms of ships and enables better detection of ship targets. However, ships in nearshore areas tend to be highly concentrated, and ship detection is often affected by adjacent strong scattering, resulting in false alarms or missed detections. While the GP-PNF detector performs well in PolSAR ship detection, it cannot obtain satisfactory results in these scenarios, and it also struggles in the presence of azimuthal ambiguity or strong clutter interference. To address these challenges, we propose a nearshore ship detection method named ECD-PNF by integrating superpixel-level GP-PNF and refined polarimetric decomposition. Firstly, polarimetric superpixel segmentation and sea–land segmentation are performed to reduce the influence of land on ship detection. To estimate the sea clutter more accurately, an automatic censoring (AC) mechanism combined with superpixels is used to select the sea clutter superpixels. By utilizing refined eight-component polarimetric decomposition to improve the scattering vector, the physical interpretability of the detector is enhanced. Additionally, the expression of polarimetric coherence is improved to enhance the target clutter ratio (TCR). Finally, this paper combines the third eigenvalue of eigenvalue–eigenvector decomposition to reduce the impact of azimuthal ambiguity. Three spaceborne PolSAR datasets from Radarsat-2 and GF-3 are adopted in the experiments for comparison. The proposed ECD-PNF method achieves the highest figure of merit (FoM) value of 0.980, 1.000, and 1.000 for three datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this approach, DT-CWT is introduced into the complex-valued convolutional neural network to suppress the speckle noise of PolSAR images and maintain the structures of learned feature maps. In addition, by applying active learning (AL), we iteratively select the most informative unlabeled training samples of PolSAR datasets. Moreover, MRF is utilized to obtain spatial local correlation information, which has been proven to be effective in improving classification performance. The experimental results on three benchmark PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a significant classification performance gain in terms of its effectiveness and robustness beyond some state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

However, it suffers clutter range dependence that makes the samples fail to satisfy the condition of being independent and identically distributed (IID), and it severely degrades traditional approaches to clutter suppression and target detection. In this paper, a novel reweighted extreme learning machine (ELM)-based clutter suppression and range compensation algorithm is proposed for non-side-looking airborne radar. The proposed method involves first designing the pre-processing stage, the special reweighted complex-valued activation function containing an unknown range compensation matrix, and two new objective outputs for constructing an initial reweighted ELM-based network with its training. Then, two other objective outputs, a new loss function, and a reverse feedback framework driven by the specifically designed objectives are proposed for the unknown range compensation matrix. Finally, aiming to estimate and reconstruct the unknown compensation matrix, special processes of the complex-valued structures and the theoretical derivations are designed and analyzed in detail. Consequently, with the updated and compensated samples, further processing including space–time adaptive processing (STAP) can be performed for clutter suppression and target detection. Compared with the classic relevant methods, the proposed algorithm achieves significantly superior performance with reasonable computation time. It provides an obviously higher detection probability and better improvement factor (IF). The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is effective and has many advantages.

The test site, located at the “Sale ‘e Porcus” pond (hereafter SPp) in Western Sardinia, Italy, offers particularly homogenous characteristics, making it an ideal location not only for experimentation but also for calibration purposes. Three remote-sensed data acquisitions have been performed by these agencies (ASI and DLR) starting on 14 July 2023 and continuing until 22 July 2023. The DLR-EnMAP data acquired on 22 July overestimates both that of the ASI-PRISMA and the 14 July DLR-EnMAP radiance in the VNIR region, while all the datasets are close to each other, up to 2500 nm, for all considered days. The average absolute mean difference between the reflectance values estimated by the ASI-PRISMA and DLR-EnMAP, in the test area, is around 0.015, despite the small difference in their time of acquisition (8 days); their maximum relative difference value occurs at about 2100 nm. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the averaged ground truth value of reflectance, acquired by means of a portable ASD FieldSpec spectoradiometer, characterizing the test site and the EO reflectance data derived from the official datasets.

This study developed an optimal random forest classification model for URSs based on spectral–topographic–radar polarization features using Landsat 8, NASA DEM, and Sentinel-1 SAR as the remote-sensing data sources. An optimal urban and rural settlement boundary (URSB) extraction technique based on morphological and pixel-level statistical methods was established to link discontinuous URSs and improve the accuracy of URSB extraction. An optimal random forest classification model for URSs was developed, as well as a technique to optimize URSB, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The URSB of Xining, China, in 2020 was then extracted at a spatial resolution of 30 m, achieving an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 96.21% and 0.92, respectively. Compared to using a single spectral feature, these corresponding metrics improved by 16.21% and 0.35, respectively. This research also demonstrated that the newly constructed Blue Roof Index (BRI), with enhanced blue roof features, is highly indicative of URSs and that the URSB was best extracted when the window size of the structural elements was 13 × 13. These results can be used to provide technical support for obtaining highly accurate information on URSs.

The objective of the study is to propose a one-step strategy for automatically mapping the active deformation areas of potential landslides from a Sentinel-1 SAR dataset. First, we built a generalized convolutional neural network (CNN) based on activity and topographic characteristics. Second, we conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of various multi-channel combiners for detecting the active deformation areas of the potential landslides. Third, we verified the transferability of the pretrained CNN model for an unknown region. We found that by incorporating topographic characteristics into a generalized convolutional neural network, we were able to enhance the accuracy of identifying the active deformation areas of potential landslides, rapidly mapping these areas. The methodology is robust and efficient, and it has the capability to automatically detect the active deformation areas of potential landslides, even in unknown or unfamiliar regions. This product can facilitate automated pipelines, updating and mapping active deformation areas for final users who are not InSAR experts. This implementation can be used for providing support to risk management activities.

However, the spatiotemporal patterns and suitability of long-term cropland change remain poorly understood. Using the annual China land cover dataset (CLCD), we provide a cropland abandonment and land reclamation mapping approach based on actual land use processes (rather than land cover conditions) to investigate spatiotemporal features of abandonment and reclamation and evaluate the rationality. Our findings show that: (1) Returning farmland to forest and grassland has been a clear trend in the study area over the past 30 years. Specifically, cropland use has undergone three phases of change, i.e., cropland contraction and expansion alternately (before 2000), followed by substantial abandonment (after 2000), and low-intensity reclamation (after 2010). (2) In the last decade, the intensity of the abandonment of cropland with high and moderate suitability is low. The rate of abandonment decreased, while the intensity of land reclamation was relatively high. The rate of the reclamation increased, and the spatial distribution of cropland tended to be reasonable. Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring actual cropland changes based on land use processes, and this method can be effectively extended to regional or global long-term cropland monitoring.

The spatial arrangement of forests inside and outside of PAs may affect ecosystem functioning and wildlife movement. The Osa Peninsula—and Costa Rica in general—are unique conservation case studies due to their high biodiversity, extensive PA network, environmental policies, and payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs. This study explores the relationship between forest management initiatives—specifically PAs, the 1996 Forest Law, and PES—and forest cover and landscape metrics in the Osa Conservation Area (ACOSA). The Google Earth Engine API was used to process Surface Reflectance Tier 1 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data for 1987, 1998, and 2019, years with relatively cloud-free satellite imagery. Land use/land cover (LULC) maps were generated with the pixel-based random forest machine learning algorithm, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and functional landscape metrics were calculated. The LULC maps are the first to track land use change, from 1987 to 2019 and the first to separately classify mature and secondary forest in the region, and have already proven useful for conservation efforts. The results suggest that forest cover, NDVI, EVI, and structural connectivity increased from 1987 to 2019 across the study area, both within and surrounding the PAs, suggesting minimal deforestation encroachment and local leakage. These changes may have contributed to the increasing vertebrate abundance observed in the region. PAs, especially national parks with stricter conservation regulations, displayed the highest forest cover and connectivity. Forest cover increased in properties receiving PES payments. Following the Forest Law’s 1996 deforestation ban, both forest conversion and reforestation rates decreased, suggesting the law curbed deforestation but did not drive reforestation across the region. Connectivity outside of PAs slightly declined following the adoption of the law, so the subsequent forest growth likely occurred in mostly previously unforested areas. Forest expansion alone does not ensure connectivity. We highlight the importance of developing policies, PES programs, and monitoring systems that emphasize conserving and restoring large, connected forest patches for biodiversity conservation and landscape resilience. Resumen: Aunque las áreas protegidas (APs) son una importante estrategia de conservación para proteger ecosistemas y especies vulnerables, algunos análisis recientes cuestionan su eficacia para frenar la deforestación y mantener la conectividad del paisaje. La distribución espacial de los bosques dentro y fuera de las AP puede afectar el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y los movimientos de la fauna. La Península de Osa–y Costa Rica en general–constituyen casos de estudio únicos de conservación debido a su elevada biodiversidad, su extensa red de AP, sus políticas medioambientales y sus programas de Pago por Servicios Ambientales (PSA). Este estudio explora la relación entre APs, la Ley Forestal de 1996, PSA, cobertura y métricas del paisaje en el Área de Conservación Osa (ACOSA). Se utilizó la plataforma Google Earth Engine API para procesar datos de Reflectancia Superficial Tier 1 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper y Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager para 1987, 1998 y 2019, años con imágenes satelitales relativamente libres de nubes. Se generaron mapas de uso del suelo con el algoritmo de aprendizaje automático basado en pixeles Random Forest, y se calcularon el índice de vegetación de diferencia normalizada (NDVI), el índice de vegetación mejorado (EVI) y las métricas de paisaje funcionales. Estos mapas, los primeros en clasificar por separado los bosques maduros y secundarios de la región, han demostrado su utilidad para los esfuerzos de conservación. Los resultados sugieren que la cobertura forestal, el NDVI, el EVI y la conectividad estructural aumentaron entre 1987 y 2019 en toda la región de estudio, tanto dentro de las AP como en sus alrededores, lo que sugiere una expansión mínima de la deforestación dentro y fuera de las AP. Estos cambios pueden haber contribuido al aumento de la abundancia de vertebrados observado en la región. Las AP, especialmente los parques nacionales con regulaciones de conservación más estrictas, mostraron la mayor cobertura forestal y conectividad. La cobertura forestal aumentó en aquellas propiedades que recibieron PSA. Tras la prohibición de la deforestación por la Ley Forestal de 1996, disminuyeron tanto las tasas de conversión forestal como las de reforestación, lo que sugiere que la ley frenó la deforestación, pero no impulsó la reforestación. La conectividad fuera de las AP disminuyó ligeramente tras la entrada en vigor de la ley, lo que sugiere que el crecimiento forestal posterior se produjo en zonas que antes no estaban forestadas. Por lo tanto, la expansión forestal por sí sola no garantiza la conectividad. Resaltamos la importancia de desarrollar políticas, programas PSA y sistemas de monitoreo que hagan hincapié en la conservación y restauración de grandes zonas forestales conectadas para apuntalar la conservación de la biodiversidad y la resiliencia del paisaje.

In this paper, we introduced the WSCS and the dedicated equipment including permanent GNSS reference stations (PGSs), acoustic tide gauges (ATGs), and dedicated GNSS buoys (DGB), etc. placed on Zhi’wan, Wai’ling’ding, Dan’gan, and Miao’Wan islands of the WSCS. The PGSs data of Zhi’wan and Wai’ling’ding islands were processed and analyzed using the GAMIT/GLOBK (Version 10.7) and Hector (Version 1.9) software to define the datum for Cal/Val of altimeters in WSCS. The DGB was used to transfer the datum from the PGSs to the ATGs of Zhi’wan, Wai’ling’ding, and Dan’gan islands. Separately, the tidal and mean sea surface (MSS) corrections are needed in the Cal/Val of altimeters. We evaluated the global/regional tide models of FES2014, HAMTIDE12, DTU16, NAO99jb, GOT4.10, and EOT20 using the three in situ tide gauge data of WSCS and Hong Kong tide gauge data (No. B329) derived from the Global Sea Level Observing System. The HAMTIDE12 tide model was chosen to be the most accurate one to maintain the tidal difference between the locations of the ATGs and the altimeter footprints. To establish the sea surface connections between the ATGs and the altimeter footprints, a GPS towing body and a highly accurate ship-based SSH measurement system (HASMS) were used to measure the sea surface of this area in 2018 and 2022, respectively. The global/regional mean sea surface (MSS) models of DTU 2021, EGM 2008 (mean dynamic topography minus by CLS_MDT_2018), and CLS2015 were accurately evaluated using the in situ measured data and HY-2A altimeter, and the CLS2015 MSS model was used for Cal/Val of altimeters in WSCS. The data collected by the equipment of WSCS, related auxiliary models mentioned above, and the sea level data of the hydrological station placed on Dan’gan island were used to accomplish the Cal/Val of HY-2B, HY-2C, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A (S3A) altimeters. The bias of HY-2B (Pass No. 375) was −16.7 ± 45.2 mm, with a drift of 0.5 mm/year. The HY-2C biases were −18.9 ± 48.0 mm with drifts of 0.0 mm/year and −5.6 ± 49.3 mm with −0.3 mm/year drifts for Pass No. 170 and 185, respectively. The Jason-3 bias was −4.1 ± 78.7 mm for Pass No. 153 and −25.8 ± 85.5 mm for Pass No. 012 after it has changed its orbits since April 2022, respectively. The biases of S3A were determined to be −16.5 ± 46.3 mm with a drift of −0.6 mm/year and −9.8 ± 30.1 mm with a drift of 0.5 mm/year for Pass No. 260 and 309, respectively. The calibration results show that the WSCS can commercialize the satellite altimeter calibration. We also discussed the calibration potential for a wide swath satellite altimeter of WSCS.

Optical sensors onboard satellite platforms face a tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolutions. Spatiotemporal fusion models can produce high spatiotemporal data, while existing models are not designed to produce moderate-spatial-resolution data, like Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has moderate spatial detail and frequent temporal coverage. This limitation arises from the challenge of combining coarse- and fine-spatial-resolution data, due to their large spatial resolution gap. This study presents a novel model, named multi-scale convolutional neural network for spatiotemporal fusion (MSCSTF), to generate MODIS-like data by addressing the large spatial-scale gap in blending the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Landsat images. To mitigate the considerable biases between AVHRR and Landsat with MODIS images, an image correction module is included into the model using deep supervision. The outcomes show that the modeled MODIS-like images are consistent with the observed ones in five tested areas, as evidenced by the root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.030, 0.022, 0.075, 0.036, and 0.045, respectively. The model makes reasonable predictions on reconstructing retrospective MODIS-like data when evaluating against Landsat data. The proposed MSCSTF model outperforms six other comparative models in accuracy, with regional average RMSE values being lower by 0.005, 0.007, 0.073, 0.062, 0.070, and 0.060, respectively, compared to the counterparts in the other models. The developed method does not rely on MODIS images as input, and it has the potential to reconstruct MODIS-like data prior to 2000 for retrospective studies and applications.

Changes in snow patterns due to global warming have far-reaching impacts on water management, agriculture, and other economic sectors such as winter tourism. Additionally, they have implications for environmental stability, prompting migration and cultural shifts in snow-dependent communities. Accurate information on snow and its variables is, thus, essential for both scientific understanding and societal planning. This review explores the potential of remote sensing in monitoring snow water equivalent (SWE) on a large scale, analyzing 164 selected publications from 2000 to 2023. Categorized by methodology and content, the analysis reveals a growing interest in the topic, with a concentration of research in North America and China. Methodologically, there is a shift from passive microwave (PMW) inversion algorithms to artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the Random Forest (RF) and neural network (NN) approaches. A majority of studies integrate PMW data with auxiliary information, focusing thematically on remote sensing and snow research, with limited incorporation into broader environmental contexts. Long-term studies (>30 years) suggest a general decrease in SWE in the Northern Hemisphere, though regional and seasonal variations exist. Finally, the review suggests potential future SWE research directions such as addressing PMW data issues, downsampling for detailed analyses, conducting interdisciplinary studies, and incorporating forecasting to enable more widespread applications.

Although land surface temperature (LST) obtained using satellites and air temperature (Ta) have different physical meanings and are measured with different techniques, LST has often been successfully employed to estimate Ta. For this reason, in this work, we estimated Ta from LST MODIS collection 6 (C6) and used other predictor variables. Daily mean Ta was calculated from Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) stations data on the Livingston and Deception Islands, and from the PERMASNOW project stations on Livingston Island; both islands being part of the South Shetland Islands (SSI) archipelago. In relation to our previous work carried out in the study area with collection 5 (C5) data, we obtained higher R2 values (R2CV = 0.8, in the unique model with Terra daytime data) and lower errors (RMSECV = 2.2 °C, MAECV = 1.6 °C). We corroborated significant improvements in MODIS C6 LST data. We analyzed emissivity as a possible factor of discrepancies between C5 and C6, but we did not find conclusive results, therefore we could not affirm that emissivity is the factor that causes differences between one collection and another. The results obtained with the applied filters indicated that MODIS data can be used to study Ta in the area, as these filters contribute to the reduction of uncertainties in the modeling of Ta from satellites.
