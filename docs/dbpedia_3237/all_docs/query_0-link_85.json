The\n\nunauthorised population increased by 3.3 million between 2000 and 2007\n\nwhile the annual average increase during this period was 470,000.\n\nNearly 4.2 million (35%) of the total 11.8 million unauthorised\n\nresidents in 2007 had entered in 2000 or later. An estimated 7.0\n\nmillion (59%) were from Mexico.\n\nCalifornia remained the leading state of residence for the illegal\n\npopulation in 2007 with 2.8 million, followed by Texas with 1.7\n\nmillion and then Florida with nearly one million.\n\nCalifornia's share of the national total declined from 30% in 2000 to\n\n24% in 2007 as the greatest percentage increases of unauthorised\n\nresident population occurred in Georgia (120%), Arizona (62%) and\n\nTexas (57%).\n\nRelated Articles :\n\n• 'Amma Home' In Naxal-Affected Area\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=20001&scat=25\n\n• Sex swami speaks to man who filmed him\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19999&scat=25\n\n• Andhra student's death caught on CCTV in US\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19993&scat=25\n\n• No pre-marital sex please, we are Indians!\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19992&scat=25\n\n• Nothing wrong in pre-marital sex, says SC\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19969&scat=25\n\n• Prasanth Goinaka shot dead in Oklahoma City, OK\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19947&scat=25\n\n• NRIs, expats return home to earn a living\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=19939&scat=25\n\nhttp://www.greatandhra.com/ganews/viewnews.php?id=10834&cat=10&scat=25\n\nIllegal Immigration is a Crime\n\nUnder Title 8 Section 1325 of the U.S. Code, \"Improper Entry by\n\nAlien,\" any citizen of any country other than the United States who:\n\nEnters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place\n\nother than as designated by immigration officers; or\n\nEludes examination or inspection by immigration officers; or\n\nAttempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully\n\nfalse or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a\n\nmaterial fact;\n\nhas committed a federal crime.\n\nViolations are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment for up to\n\nsix months. Repeat offenses can bring up to two years in prison.\n\nAdditional civil fines may be imposed at the discretion of immigration\n\njudges, but civil fines do not negate the criminal sanctions or nature\n\nof the offense.\n\nSee: Unlawful entry a crime since '29 - Rocky Mountain News -- June\n\n11, 2006\n\nEach year the Border Patrol is making more than a million\n\napprehensions of people who flagrantly violate our nation's laws by\n\nunlawfully crossing U.S. borders to work and to receive publicly-\n\nfunded services, often with the aid of fraudulent documents. Such\n\nentry is a misdemeanor and, if repeated, becomes punishable as a\n\nfelony. Over eight million illegal immigrants live in the United\n\nStates -- some estimate even more.\n\nIn addition to sneaking into the country in violation of the\n\nimmigration law that requires that aliens be documented for legal\n\nentry (referred to as \"entry without inspection -- EWI\"), others enter\n\nwith legal documentation and then violate the terms on which they have\n\nbeen admitted by taking jobs that are not authorized or overstaying\n\nthe authorized period of stay in the country. The INS estimated in\n\n1996 that about 60 percent of the then estimated five million illegal\n\nimmigrants were EWI and 40 percent were overstayers. Both types of\n\nillegal immigrants are deportable under Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct Section 237 (a)(1)(B) which says:\n\n\"Any alien who is present in the United States in violation of this\n\nAct or any other law of the United States is deportable.\"\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME\n\nApologists for illegal immigration like to paint it as a victimless\n\ncrime. But in fact, illegal immigration causes substantial harm to\n\nAmerican citizens and legal immigrants, particularly those in the most\n\nvulnerable sectors of our population--the poor, minorities, and\n\nchildren.\n\nIllegal immigration causes an enormous drain on public funds. The\n\nseminal study of the costs of immigration by the National Academy of\n\nSciences found that the taxes paid by immigrants do not cover the cost\n\nof services received by them. We cannot provide high quality\n\neducation, health care, and retirement security for our own people if\n\nwe continue to bring in endless numbers of poor, unskilled\n\nimmigrants.\n\nAdditionally, job competition by waves of illegal immigrants willing\n\nto work at substandard wages and working conditions depresses the\n\nwages of American workers, hitting hardest at minority workers and\n\nthose without high school degrees. Ý\n\nIllegal immigration also contributes to the dramatic population growth\n\noverwhelming communities across America--crowding school classrooms,\n\nconsuming already limited affordable housing, and straining precious\n\nnatural resources like water, energy, and forestland.\n\nBORDER PATROL: NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT\n\nThe Border Patrol plays a crucial role in combatting illegal\n\nimmigration, but illegal immigration cannot be controlled solely at\n\nthe border. About half of the illegal alien population is comprised of\n\nvisa overstayers--people who entered the country legally, but became\n\nillegal aliens by their failure to leave the U.S. upon expiration of\n\ntheir visa. Once entry occurs, there is little chance of detection and\n\nvirtually no chance of deportation, except for convicted criminals.\n\nWHAT CAN WE DO?\n\nWe need a comprehensive program to end illegal immigration; that means\n\nensuring that people who enter illegally or overstay their lawful\n\nstatus will not be able to obtain employment, public assistance\n\nbenefits, public education, public housing, or any other taxpayer-\n\nfunded benefit without detection.\n\nThe three major components of immigration control--deterrence,\n\napprehension and removal--need to be strengthened by Congress and the\n\nExecutive Branch if effective control is ever to be reestablished.\n\nControlling illegal immigration requires a balanced approach with a\n\nfull range of enforcement improvements that go far beyond the border.\n\nThese include many procedural reforms, beefed up investigation\n\ncapacity, asylum reform, documents improvements, major improvements in\n\nINS detention and deportation procedures, limitations on judicial\n\nreview, improved intelligence capacity, greatly improved state/federal\n\ncooperation, and added resources. See How to Combat Illegal\n\nImmigration.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE COSTS?\n\nEffective control and management of the laws against illegal\n\nimmigration require adequate resources. But those costs will be more\n\nthan offset by savings to states, counties, communities, and school\n\ndistricts across the nation.\n\nFAIR, 3/03\n\nhttp://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/8/12/II/VIII/1325\n\nhttp://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_4762657%2C00.html\n\nhttp://www.americanpatrol.com/REFERENCE/AidAbetUnlawfulSec8USC1324.html\n\nhttp://www.americanpatrol.com/REFERENCE/isacrime.html\n\nRich illegal immigrants in U.S. hide in shadows\n\nJohn Buchanan\n\nATLANTA\n\nWed Feb 6, 2008 4:23am EST\n\nMike Lozano, an immigrant from Mexico, marches during an immigrant\n\nrights rally in Boston, Massachusetts in this May 1, 2006 file photo\n\nas part of a nationwide ''A Day Without Immigrants'' protest staged by\n\nimmigrant rights advocates.\n\nCredit: Reuters/Brian Snyder/Files\n\nATLANTA (Reuters) - Many illegal immigrants in the United States are\n\nmanual laborers on low wages. But there's another group that attracts\n\nmuch less attention: entrepreneurs who have set up businesses, created\n\njobs and grown affluent.\n\nU.S.\n\nThere are up to 20,000 illegal immigrants earning upward of $100,000 a\n\nyear as entrepreneurs, and their existence challenges the stereotype\n\nthat illegal immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy, according to\n\nimmigration lawyers and academics.\n\nMany say they are living the \"American Dream,\" but almost none trumpet\n\ntheir achievements because they fear deportation.\n\nOne example is a 38-year-old computer engineer who overstayed his visa\n\nafter arriving from Colombia in 1999. Not long after, he founded a Web\n\ndesign firm in Miami that specializes in e-commerce.\n\nToday it's a fast-growing, tax-paying company that recently developed\n\na Web platform for online radio and television that could be a\n\nbreakthrough technology.\n\n\"We are at a good point now, making money,\" said the man, who spoke on\n\ncondition of anonymity because of his immigration status. \"We are\n\ngrowing every month because our customers are happy. They are U.S.\n\ncompanies making a lot of money from our Web sites.\"\n\nBut the man is near the end of a long administrative process that will\n\nlikely lead to his deportation. Then his company would close and\n\nworkers, including Americans, would be laid off.\n\n\"I have always tried to look at things in a positive way but now I am\n\ndisappointed,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nMichael Bander, a Miami immigration lawyer who has represented the man\n\nfor six years, said his client's dilemma showed a larger flaw in the\n\nimmigration system.\n\nSPECIAL STATUS?\n\nIt is not easy to determine the number of illegal immigrants who earn\n\nsix figure salaries, but there could be 20,000 of them and a\n\nsignificant proportion earn up to $300,000 a year, said Jeff Passel,\n\nlead demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington.\n\nAdvocates see the group as trailblazers for the more than 12 million\n\nillegal immigrants estimated to be living in the United States, most\n\nfrom Mexico or other Latin American countries.\n\n\"These people should be treated like heroes not criminals,\" said\n\nFelipe Korzenny, professor of marketing and communications at Florida\n\nState University. Wealthy illegal immigrants also came from India,\n\nChina, Taiwan, Israel and South Africa, he said.\n\nCongress should address their unique situation, not least because they\n\nhave more to lose than others, said George Tzamaras, spokesman for the\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nThe United States runs a Green Card residence permit program for\n\ninvestors but it does not apply to those already in the country\n\nillegally.\n\nBut opponents of illegal immigration said the United States should\n\ngrant no special status according to wealth for people who break the\n\nlaw.\n\n\"They should be deported as existing law dictates. We'd like to see\n\ntheir assets seized to compensate American taxpayers who are losing\n\nbillions of dollars due to rampant illegal immigration,\" said William\n\nGheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration.\n\n\"We need to send a strong message to people who would like to come to\n\nthe U.S. that disrespect for our laws will not lead to prosperity,\"\n\nsaid Gheen.\n\nTEN-YEAR BAN\n\nUnder existing law, people who overstay their visas must return to\n\ntheir home country, and cannot re-enter for 10 years. Visas waiving\n\nthis process are increasingly rare, immigration lawyers said.\n\nMore than half of Silicon Valley start-ups between 1995 and 2005 had\n\none or more immigrants as key founders, according to a study by the\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley and Vivek Wadhwa, founder of\n\nRelativity Technologies.\n\nImmigrant entrepreneurs launched 25 percent of technology or\n\nengineering companies in the same period, it said.\n\nSome can be assumed to be illegal immigrants, said Wadhwa, a columnist\n\nand professor whose company was rated by Fortune magazine as one of\n\nthe 25 coolest in the world.\n\n\"You have to figure out what to do with the 12 million illegal\n\nimmigrants that are unskilled,\" said Wadhwa, who was born in India.\n\n\"But what about the few hundred thousand that help us boost our\n\ncompetitiveness?\"\n\n(Writing by Matthew Bigg; Editing by Michael Christie and Eddie Evans)\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2533661620080206\n\nGuest Opinion/Commentary*\n\nIllegal Immigration: India Invades America\n\nBy William H. Calhoun (12/18/06)\n\nAn ex-Army intelligence officer recently said, \"We are under attack.\n\nAnd it's not just Mexico. It's all Central and South American\n\ncountries. It's India. It's China. It's most of the non-European\n\nworld. And if we do not fight back soon, America will be third-world\n\nsewer within 30 years!.\"\n\nAmerica is currently being invaded from all corners of the world.\n\nMexico. China. Africa. India. They all are invading and carving out\n\ntheir enclaves. And you know what? They are backed by big business and\n\nthe American government.\n\nA perfect case in point is India. The Indian Government and American\n\ncorporations have been lobbying the US for more H-1B visas to allow\n\nIndians to move to the United States.\n\nAmerican companies use the H-1B to drive down American wages. An\n\nassociate of mine who works for a high-tech company in California\n\n(whose name I cannot say for legal reasons) recently watched about 90%\n\nof his fellow American employees be fired from his company. They were\n\nreplaced with H-1B imports from India, who were paid about one-third\n\nof what the Americans were making.\n\nGW Bush has largely supported this H-1B invasion, portraying it as\n\nsound policy. He, however, and the mainstream media always fail to\n\nmention that large companies are using the H-1B to drive down wages\n\nwhereby they fire American employees and replace them with low-paid\n\nforeigners. They also fail to mention that India has the largest\n\nMuslim population, the most terrorist cells, and now the most reported\n\ncases of HIV in the world.\n\nAt my friend's high-tech company in California, within a few months of\n\nthe firings, two of the Indian employees had already spread HIV to\n\nthree Americans, three of the other Indians had known ties to\n\nterrorist cells in India, and the Indians would openly speak of\n\n\"exterminating the European race.\" Was any of this reported in the\n\nmainstream media? Of course not. Did any of these people serve jail\n\ntime? Of course not. In essence, because of H-1B provisions, they have\n\nmore rights than American citizens. Nor is this incident isolated.\n\nAs previously reported, I was at the airport recently in Los Angeles,\n\nand I could overhear the conversation of some younger Indians waiting\n\nfor a flight from India. These youths were obviously raised in\n\nAmerica, as they did not have accents, unlike their parents sitting\n\nnext to them. The Indian youth, after debating their favorite rappers,\n\nbegan to discuss how recent DNA studies show that Indians are closely\n\nrelated to Sub-Saharan Africans. They then began to speak approvingly\n\nof India invading California, and went on to say that they should\n\n\"wipe out all the whites.\" Now, the parents, seeing that I was\n\nlistening, lightly admonished the youth, not really because of what\n\nthey said, but only because others could hear.\n\nThis is the norm all across America. After previously publishing my\n\nexperience in the Los Angeles airport, I received many emails from\n\npatriots saying they had experienced very similar situations.\n\nAnd you know what? GW Bush and Condoleezza Rice just gave these people\n\nmore nuclear technology.\n\nThe same ex-intelligence Army officer said to me, \"This policy of\n\ngiving nuclear technology to India is borderline treason. The\n\nmotivating factor was big business, not national security. All of our\n\nintelligence has shown that now it is just a matter of when, not if,\n\nan Indian detonates a backpack nuke within the United States or sells\n\none to a Mexican nationalist.\"\n\nAnd Bush has sworn to uphold the US Constitution? perduellio est\n\ncommunis!\n\nIf we don't immediately lose our country via a backpack nuke, then we\n\nmost certainly will lose our jobs and standard of living. Americans'\n\nwages are dropping every year (adjusted for inflation) due to legal\n\nand illegal immigration. We are being ambushed from every angle.\n\nPatriotic Americas had better wake up! We are under attack. Be\n\nvigilant and prepare! Stop the third-world invasion!\n\nWilliam H. Calhoun is a writer, paleoconservative, and a farmer who\n\nlives on his ancestral estate.\n\nhttp://www.americandaily.com/article/16838\n\nIndian illegal immigrants in US up 64 percent last decade\n\nIANS, Feb 10, 2010, 10.29am IST\n\nWASHINGTON: In 2009, India accounted for the third highest increase in\n\nthe number of illegal immigrants in the US in ten years, according to\n\na new government report, though only two percent of all illegal\n\nimmigrants were Indians.\n\nThe number of illegal immigrants in the US fell by seven percent to\n\n10.8 million last year.\n\nA majority of them came from Latin America, according to the\n\ndepartment of homeland security (DHS) report, though India with\n\n200,000 was the sixth biggest sender of illegal immigrants to the US.\n\nIn overall numbers, Indians accounted for only two percent of illegal\n\nimmigrants. Mexico (6.7 million) topped the list with 62 percent,\n\nfollowed by those from El Salvador (530,000), Guatemala (480,000),\n\nHonduras (320,000) and the Philippines (270,000).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, the Mexican-born unauthorised immigrants\n\nincreased by two million or 42 percent. But the greatest percentage\n\nincreases occurred among unauthorised immigrants from Honduras (95\n\npercent), Guatemala (65 percent), and India (64 percent).\n\n\"The number of unauthorised residents declined by one million between\n\n2007 and 2009, coincident with the US economic downturn,\" said the\n\nreport based on census data and extrapolations from the total foreign\n\npopulation in the country.\n\nBeside the US and global financial crisis, other reasons the report\n\nadduces for the drop in the undocumented population include tougher\n\nborder enforcement and a national crackdown on illegal immigrants.\n\nThe overall annual average increase in the unauthorised population\n\nduring the 2000-09 period was 250,000 with ten leading countries of\n\norigin representing 85 percent of the unauthorised immigrant\n\npopulation in 2009.\n\nOf the nearly 11 million undocumented people living in the US in\n\nJanuary 2009, 37 percent, or four million, arrived since January 2000,\n\n44 percent since the 1990s and 19 percent since the 1980s, the DHS\n\nsaid.\n\nBetween January 2008 and January 2009, the number of unauthorised\n\nimmigrants living in the US decreased seven percent from 11.6 million\n\nto 10.8 million after growing from 8.5 million to 11.8 million between\n\n2000 and 2007, DHS said.\n\nAn estimated 8.5 million of the 10.8 million unauthorised immigrants\n\nliving in the US in 2009 were from the North America region, including\n\nCanada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. The next leading\n\nregions of origin were Asia (980,000) and South America (740,000).\n\nCalifornia remained the leading state of residence of the illegal\n\nimmigrants in 2009, with 2.6 million, followed by Texas (1.7 million),\n\nFlorida (720,000), New York (550,000) and Illinois (540,000).\n\nCalifornia's share of the national total was 24 percent in 2009\n\ncompared to 30 percent in 2000. The greatest percentage increase in\n\nthe illegal population between 2000 and 2009 occurred in Georgia (115\n\npercent), Nevada (55 percent) and Texas (54 percent).\n\nIn 2009, 61 percent of unauthorised immigrants were aged 25 to 44\n\nyears, and 58 percent were male. Males accounted for 62 percent of the\n\nillegal population in the 18 to 34 age group in 2009 while females\n\naccounted for 52 percent of the 45 and older age groups.\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/indians-abroad/Indian-illegal-immigrants-in-US-up-64-percent-last-decade/articleshow/5554881.cms\n\nNew report says illegal immigration population plummeted last year\n\nResearchers cite recession as cause for decline; other analysts say\n\nmany opt to\n\nBy Matt O'Brien\n\nContra Costa Times\n\nPosted: 02/09/2010 03:56:30 PM PST\n\nUpdated: 02/10/2010 06:45:42 AM PST\n\nThe number of illegal immigrants living in the United States dropped\n\nby 1 million in two years, according to new estimates by the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\nThe government thinks that 10.8 million illegal immigrants lived in\n\nthe country in January 2009, down from a peak of nearly 12 million in\n\n2007.\n\nIf the official estimates are correct, not since 2005 has the\n\npopulation of illegal immigrants been as low as it was last year.\n\nSome private researchers, however, are questioning the magnitude of\n\nthe drop.\n\n\"It's very clear the undocumented population basically stopped growing\n\nafter 2006,\" said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer with the nonpartisan\n\nPew Hispanic Center. \"It's plausible that the numbers have gotten\n\nsmaller. But the way that they're measuring it, if you compare this\n\nestimate with the one two years ago, it overstates the degree of\n\ndecline.\"\n\nTwice over the past two years, Passel said, the U.S. Census Bureau has\n\nchanged the way it measures immigration in its annual population\n\nsurveys.\n\nSince nearly all estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population\n\nrely on census survey numbers, these changes might have distorted the\n\nresults. The authors of the government estimates could not be reached\n\nfor comment Tuesday.\n\nThe report cautioned that changes made to the census survey could have\n\naffected the results.\n\nThe report, produced annually since 2005, is the government's official\n\ntabulation of immigrants living here illegally.\n\nMost researchers agree that no matter the size of the population,\n\nwhich is notoriously hard to measure, the rate of illegal immigration\n\ndropped sharply during the recession.\n\nThey disagree, however, on the causes.\n\n\"The number of new undocumented immigrants coming in has plummeted,\"\n\nPassel said.\n\nOther researchers conclude that the drop is not because fewer illegal\n\nimmigrants are coming in, but because more are leaving.\n\n\"The illegal population is falling significantly,\" said Steve Camarota\n\nof the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates reducing\n\nimmigration. \"The only way for that to happen is for a lot more people\n\nto be going home.\"\n\nThe government demographers reached the same exact estimate — 10.8\n\nmillion illegal immigrants nationwide — that Camarota concluded in his\n\ndemographic study last year.\n\nBut while most researchers cite the recession as the cause for the\n\ndecline, Camarota said border enforcement plays an important part.\n\n\"The decline in the population begins before the economy turns down,\"\n\nhe said. \"That suggests that, at least initially, it's because of the\n\nstepped-up enforcement that increased during the end of the Bush\n\nadministration.\"\n\nOther analysts disagree, saying that slower migration flows are a\n\nworldwide trend associated with the economic downturn.\n\n\"It's really driven by fewer people coming in,\" said Jeanne Batalova,\n\na researcher with the Migration Policy Institute based in Washington,\n\nD.C.\n\n\"People are staying put wherever they are. They are less likely to\n\nmigrate, but if they're already in the country, the preferred\n\ndestination, they will do their best to stay and weather the storm.\n\nThat's particularly the case for undocumented immigrants.\"\n\nThere are no estimates of how the population of unauthorized\n\nimmigrants has changed in the first year of the Obama administration,\n\nbut demographers are likely to begin guessing later this year when the\n\nCensus Bureau releases new population estimates for 2009.\n\ninformation\n\nTop countries of origin for illegal immigrants in the U.S.:\n\nMexico: 6.65 million (up by 42 percent since 2000)\n\nEl Salvador: 530,000 (up by 25 percent)\n\nGuatemala: 480,000 (up by 65 percent)\n\nHonduras: 320,000 (up by 95 percent)\n\nPhilippines: 270,000 (up by 33 percent)\n\nIndia: 200,000 (up by 64 percent)\n\nSouth Korea: 200,000 (up by 14 percent)\n\nStates with the most illegal immigrants:\n\nCalifornia: 2.6 million (up by 3 percent since 2000)\n\nTexas: 1.68 million (up by 54 percent)\n\nFlorida: 720,000 (down by 10 percent)\n\nNew York: 550,000 (up by 1 percent)\n\nIllinois: 540,000 (up by 24 percent)\n\nGeorgia: 480,000 (up by 115 percent)\n\nArizona: 460,000 (up by 42 percent)\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\nhttp://www.insidebayarea.com/search/ci_14367660?IADID=Search-www.insidebayarea.com-www.insidebayarea.com\n\nIllegal immigrants from India on the rise\n\nExperts say many come to U.S. legally, overstay visas\n\nBy JAMES PINKERTON Copyright 2007 Houston Chronicle\n\nSept. 11, 2007, 12:47PM\n\n.\n\nSharon Steinmann Chronicle\n\nSurinder Singh, left, recently received his U.S. citizenship while his\n\nsister-in-law, Ravinder Kour is struggling with the process.\n\nShare Print Share Del.icio.usDiggTwitterYahoo!\n\nBuzzFacebookStumbleUponThe fastest-growing group of illegal immigrants\n\nin the United States doesn't speak Spanish. They typically aren't\n\nfound at day labor sites or streaming across the Southwest border into\n\nthe U.S.\n\nInstead, they're here in America working in tech companies, small\n\nbusinesses, as engineers or other highly skilled jobs. And they're\n\ncoming from India.\n\nThe profile of the illegal immigrant may need to take on a slightly\n\nmore South Asian persona since a recent federal report revealed that\n\nIndia had the greatest percentage increase in unauthorized immigrants\n\nin the U.S. since 2000.\n\nIllegal immigrants from India grew to 270,000 in 2006 from 120,000 in\n\n2000, a 125 percent increase, according to a report late last month\n\nfrom the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nUndocumented Indians, however, remain a small segment of the total\n\nestimated population of 11.6 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.\n\nMexico tops the list with 6.6 million — up from 4.7 million in 2000 —\n\nfollowed by El Salvador and Guatemala, according to the Homeland\n\nSecurity report.\n\nLocally, this trend is especially relevant since Indians make up one\n\nof the fastest-growing immigrant groups in Harris County, with 35,971\n\ncounted in the 2000 Census. They also represent a highly visible and\n\ninfluential immigrant community. The Houston area has 6,629 businesses\n\nowned by Indian-Americans, according to the most recent Census Bureau\n\ndata.\n\nExperts say illegal Indian immigrants are coming here legally on visas\n\nbut are overextending their stays and subsequently slipping under the\n\nradar screen of authorities.\n\n'The system is broken'\n\nImmigration lawyer Bruce Coane said Indians have replaced Mexicans as\n\nthe largest group of clients at his Houston practice. He estimates\n\nthat more than 1,000 Indians in the Houston area do not have legal\n\nstatus to remain here.\n\n''The numbers are large because there are just so many coming to the\n\nUnited States, and almost all of them are coming legally,\" said Coane,\n\nreferring to the undocumented population. ''And over time, they fall\n\nout of legal status.\"\n\nThe most recent government data showed that in fiscal year 2005,\n\nIndians received 194,611 temporary work visas to come to the U.S., the\n\nmost of any nation. India eclipsed Mexico, which had 169,786 of its\n\nworkers admitted, and the United Kingdom with 156,635.\n\nCoane and other immigration attorneys stressed that most Indian\n\nimmigrants come here legally to work, go to school, visit as tourists\n\nor conduct business.\n\n''In most cases, they're trying to do everything the right way, but\n\nbecause the system is broken, they fall out of status,\" said Coane,\n\nreferring to lengthy waits to become a permanent resident.\n\nMore than half of Indian immigrants who came to the U.S. in fiscal\n\nyear 2005 — about 102,000 — arrived on the H-1B visa for the highly\n\nskilled. So, typically, they aren't going to be busted by immigration\n\nagents during raids at meat-processing plants such as those owned by\n\nSwift & Co., the site of high-profile investigations last year.\n\n''We have not come across many illegal Indian immigrants in Houston,\"\n\nsaid Robert Rutt, special agent in charge of the U.S. Immigration and\n\nCustoms Enforcement office in Houston. ''Most are Mexicans, South and\n\nCentral Americans, and some Chinese.\"\n\nLax federal oversight cited\n\nThere is debate in the Indian community about why immigrants become\n\nillegal, and just how many reside in Houston.\n\n''My knowledge tells me that most of the Indians we interact with are\n\nhighly educated — doctors, engineers and business owners,\" said Jagdip\n\nAhluwalia, director of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce. ''I\n\npersonally have not run into any undocumented Indians here, and I've\n\nlived here for many years.\"\n\nFaisal Amin, board member of the South Asian Chamber of Commerce in\n\nHouston, said lax oversight of the federal guest workers program is\n\none reason many Indians stay here when their visas expire.\n\n''We see an increase simply because a lot of those workers are coming\n\nin on H1-B visas,\" Amin said. \"And, we don't have a good way to track\n\nthat these workers are, indeed, going back to their countries when\n\nthey're finished.\"\n\nOne U.S. Department of Homeland Security official, who asked not be be\n\nidentified, agreed there isn't a method to keep tabs on guest workers.\n\n''Once they get in, there's no exit program in place yet — they're\n\ntalking about it,\" the official said.\n\nA dozen years ago, India native Ravinder Kour came to Houston with her\n\nhusband on a tourist visa. They found opportunity and stayed after\n\ntheir visas expired, which turned them into illegal residents.\n\nMeanwhile, they were raising two children who were born here.\n\nBut now Kour, a 39-year-old housewife, and her husband are hoping to\n\nregain their legal status with the help of an immigration attorney.\n\n''There are no jobs\" in India, said Kour. ''That's why so many Indian\n\npeople are coming here.\"\n\nBad advice, bad situation\n\nAfter arriving in Houston the couple decided to try to remain legally.\n\nThey were advised by an immigration lawyer to make a claim for\n\npolitical asylum, which was rejected, and the couple was ordered\n\ndeported after not attending a hearing, said attorney Gordon Quan.\n\n''They weren't trying to cheat anyone; they got bad advice,\" Quan\n\nsaid.\n\nKour is being assisted by her brother-in-law, Surinder Singh, 47, who\n\nalso came to Houston on a tourist visa. He lived the life of an\n\nillegal immigrant until becoming a citizen in 2003.\n\n''We can't fly, if you want to go somewhere, you have to go by car,\"\n\nSingh said. ''If you do something bad, and don't have papers, you will\n\nbe in trouble.\"\n\nThe Houston housewife said she constantly worries about immigration\n\nproblems.\n\n\"It's a big, big depression,\" Kour said.\n\nQuan, her attorney, noted the federal government assigns a quota of\n\nimmigrant visas to each country, and with so many Indians here on\n\ntemporary work and other visas, the demand outstrips the supply.\n\n''It's not first-come, first-serve,\" Quan said. ''A certain percentage\n\nis given to each country. Since there are so many Indians that are\n\nskilled, and being sponsored by employers, their backlog is longer\n\nthan other countries.\"\n\njames.p...@chron.com\n\n324 Comments 4 Recommend\n\n(12)\n\nmudkip wrote:\n\nWell, send them back too! 9/11/2007 12:33:55 AM\n\nRecommend: (14) (0)\n\n(0)\n\nareyoukidding wrote:\n\nHow can there not be jobs?

Illegal\n\nimmigrants from other countries are mostly low-skilled workers.\n\nMercurynews, in its report, also says if the trend continues India\n\nwill only trail only Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala in illegal\n\nimmigration.\n\nThe report quoting experts says virtually all immigrants enter the US\n\nlegally and then violate the visa terms, thus becomimg illegal\n\nimmigrants.\n\n\"How do you get in? You come across the border, or you arrive here\n\nwith a visa,\" Lindsay Lowell, policy director for the Institute for\n\nthe Study of International Migration at Georgetown University told\n\nMercurynews.\n\n\"Indians aren't going to be walking across the border like Mexicans,\"\n\nhe said.\n\nFederal officials calculated the number of illegal immigrants by using\n\ncensus estimates of the total number of immigrants from individual\n\ncountries, compiling the total number of legal immigrants using\n\nfederal immigration and naturalization records, and then subtracting\n\nthe number of legal residents from the total immigrant population to\n\ndetermine the number of undocumented people, the report said.\n\nAsked by Mercurynews about the number of illegal Indians in Silicon\n\nValley, Banjit Singh, an Indian-born taxi driver, said, \"Here, there\n\nis a little bit. But you go to another city or state, like Los Angeles\n\nor New York, there are many illegal people.\"\n\nLocal immigration lawyers say that particularly among Indians, the ups\n\nand downs of Silicon Valley's economy since 2001 are one reason why\n\nIndians have fallen out of legal status.\n\n\"Most are bachelors; the way they get here is they have a job,\"\n\nGabriel Jack, a San Jose immigration lawyer, said of many of his\n\nIndian clients.\n\n\"They come here as professionals, most often in the H-1B program, and\n\ngiven the fluctuations of Silicon Valley, the business climate, these\n\nguys lose their jobs. They get laid off or they wager their hands on a\n\nstart-up coming in,\" Jack said.\n\n\"The problem with the H-1B program is, you can't have any significant\n\ntime between jobs\" without falling out of legal status.\n\nIndians made up 44 percent of H-1B applicants in the 2005-06 fiscal\n\nyear, five times the number from second-place China, the report says.\n\nThe report says another source is relatives from India who arrive for\n\na visit on a tourist visa and never go home.\n\n\"America is a very attractive country; everybody who comes here wants\n\nto stay,\" said Shah Peerally, a Silicon Valley immigration lawyer. \"I\n\ncan tell you right now, there are nearly 1 billion people in India, of\n\nwhich maybe 800 million want to come here.\"\n\nThe United States deported close to 500 Indians a year in recent\n\nyears, another expert tells Mecurynews.\n\n\"Unless Congress reforms the immigration system we are going to see\n\nthis high-skilled, illegal workforce emerging,\" said Frank D.

Where do\n\nthey come from and where do they settle in the United States? After\n\nentry, what socio-economic roles do they play in the US economy?\n\nAs of 2008, the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States\n\nis estimated to be approximately 11.6 million. 61% of the unauthorized\n\nimmigrants in the country are from Mexico, and 25% of all unauthorized\n\nimmigrant workers reside in California. Unauthorized immigrants, as of\n\n2008, represent 5% of the total civilian labor force in the United\n\nStates. 51% of these immigrants, compared to 21% of native workers,\n\nhold occupations in the service (30%) and construction (21%)\n\nindustries.

KRISHNAKUMAR\n\nin Thiruvananthapuram\n\nONCE again, the Adivasis of Kerala are at a crossroads. These tribal\n\npeople have become more assertive about their rights and the nature of\n\ntheir demands has undergone a subtle transformation. They are now more\n\naware of the law and the ways of the non-tribal people, politicians,\n\ngovernments and the courts. They have media-savvy leaders, invisible\n\n'friends', and funds to sustain high-profile agitations in the State\n\ncapital. They are increasingly intolerant of hollow promises and they\n\nthreaten to storm the State Assembly and camp on the streets of\n\nThiruvananthapuram permanently. At times they disrupt public\n\nfestivities, walk out of meetings with government representatives or\n\ntake District Collectors hostage. They have definitely become prime-\n\ntime news material. But the question is, will they fail again?\n\nThe year 1975 once seemed a crucial one for the marginalised tribal\n\npeople of the State. Although they did not have a powerful presence in\n\nthe State, their plight had struck a chord and they had found\n\nthemselves being offered the protection of a law that promised to end\n\nexploitation by non-tribal settlers and forest encroachers, and lack\n\nof livelihoods.\n\nIn April 1975, the State Assembly unanimously adopted the Kerala\n\nScheduled Tribes (Restriction on Transfer of Lands and Restoration of\n\nAlienated Lands) Act, which sought to prevent the lands of the tribal\n\npeople from falling into the hands of non-tribal people. The Act also\n\nsought to restore to the tribal people their previously alienated\n\nlands.\n\nK.G. SANTHOSH\n\n\"Refugee camps\" run by agitating tribal people outside the State\n\nSecretariat in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nThe tribal people were once in possession of large tracts of forests\n\nin the State, especially in areas that are now in Palakkad, Wayanad,\n\nIdukki, Pathanam-thitta, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram districts. To a\n\nlarge extent, post-Independence governments were responsible for the\n\nAdivasis losing their lands. Non-tribal settlers made their plight\n\nworse as the pressure on land increased in the plains. The land-people\n\nratio is very high in the State.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the ignorance and innocence of the Adivasis\n\nwere used to the hilt by the non-tribal settler \"farmers\". Either by\n\nusing force or inducements such as a bundle of tobacco, or by offering\n\na low price, they made the Adivasis part with their \"ancestral land\".\n\nIn most cases there was no document validating such transfers and some\n\ntribal persons were even forced to sign on blank sheets of paper. The\n\nnon-tribal people who got possession of the lands gradually became the\n\nvirtual owners.\n\nOver the years, alienation from their land of birth pushed the\n\nAdivasis into poverty and dependence and forced them to search for\n\nother forest land for food and shelter. However, the same process was\n\nrepeated in the new stretches of forest land, and these too became the\n\nfarmlands of non-tribal settlers. Political parties and successive\n\ngovernments turned a blind eye to the process, as more settlers meant\n\nmore votes. (The Adivasis, who number 3.21 lakhs, account for only 1.1\n\nper cent of the population of the State.) The social and ecological\n\nimplications of this were serious.\n\nWhen the 1975 Act got the presidential assent in November that year\n\nand was subsequently included in the Ninth Schedule of the\n\nConstitution (which ensured that the Act would not be challenged in\n\nany court of law), it seemed a dream come true for the Adivasis. But\n\nit was not to be. Successive governments allowed more than a decade to\n\npass (during which the encroachments continued, especially in the\n\ntribal areas of Palakkad and Wayanad districts) before framing the\n\nrules to implement the Act. When the State government finally\n\nformulated the rules in 1986, it specified that the Act would come\n\ninto effect retrospectively from January 1, 1982.\n\nThe rules made all transfer of property \"possessed, enjoyed or owned\"\n\nby Adivasis to non-tribal people between January 1, 1960 and January\n\n1, 1982 \"invalid\" and directed that the \"possession or enjoyment\" of\n\nproperty so transferred be restored to the Adivasis concerned.\n\nHowever, the Act required that the Adivasi return the amount, if any,\n\nthey had received during the original transaction and pay compensation\n\nfor any improvements made on the land by the non-tribal occupants. The\n\ngovernment was to advance this amount to the tribal people as loans\n\nand recover it from them in 20 years. Only about 8,500 applications\n\nseeking restoration were received from the tribal people, because most\n\nof them were either unaware of the new law or afraid to accept the\n\noffer of loans or were cheated by the corrupt encroacher-official\n\nnexus. Hence, even after the framing of the rules, the general\n\natmosphere helped only to encourage the encroachers to continue to\n\noccupy tribal land and successive governments took no action to\n\nimplement fully the 1975 Act.\n\nTHIS triggered the second important phase of the Adivasi struggle. In\n\n1986, Dr. Nalla Thampi Thera, a non-tribal person from Wayanad\n\ndistrict, approached the Kerala High Court seeking a direction to the\n\nState government to implement the 1975 Act. It took five years for the\n\ncourt to give a verdict - a favourable one - on the public interest\n\npetition. In October 1993, the court ordered the government to\n\nimplement the Act within six months. Yet the case dragged on for two\n\nand a half years with the government continuing to seek extensions of\n\ndeadline to implement the Act.\n\nS. GOPAKUMAR\n\nThe Adivasi Gothra Mahasabha take out a rally in Thiruvananthapuram\n\non October 3.\n\nFinally, in 1996 the court fixed a final deadline of September 30,\n\n1996 to evict the non-tribal occupants, if necessary with the help of\n\nthe police, and threatened the officials concerned with contempt of\n\ncourt proceedings if they failed to implement the court directive.\n\nHowever, the government responded with yet another controversial act\n\nof amending the 1975 Act.\n\nMeanwhile as the non-tribal settlers where getting entrenched in the\n\nalienated land of the tribal people, the tribal people themselves were\n\ngetting increasingly disillusioned with the ability of the government\n\nand the courts to find a remedy for their plight. Hence, although\n\ngovernment programmes had helped improve the lot of many tribal\n\npeople, the majority of them continued to be landless, had no means of\n\nlivelihood, and became more dependent on the non-tribal settlers for\n\nwork and wages.\n\nAs a large section of the landless tribal people had not filed\n\napplications and were hence outside the purview of the 1975 Act, they\n\nwere ineligible for a piece of land even if the Act was implemented in\n\ntoto. By the early 1990s, the first signs of discontent were already\n\nbecoming evident in the Adivasi-inhabited areas, especially in Wayanad\n\ndistrict, where some extremist groups had been active for a long\n\ntime.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the land from which the settlers were to be\n\nevicted under the 1975 Act had by the 1990s been in their possession\n\nfor 15 to 30 years. They were cultivating the land and had constructed\n\nbuildings and other structures on them. In several cases, the next\n\ngeneration of the original encroachers were in possession of the\n\nlands. When the State government could get no more extensions of the\n\ndeadline from the High Court, the politically and economically\n\npowerful settler-farmers activated their organisations and raised the\n\ndemand to amend the \"impractical provisions\" of the 1975 Act.\n\nTo the consternation of the tribal people, successive governments\n\nstarted to give in to the demands of the settlers. Two ordinances\n\nseeking to amend the 1975 Act, introduced by the United Democratic\n\nFront government during early 1996 and later by the Left Democratic\n\nFront government, which came to power in May 1996, did not get the\n\nGovernor's approval. As pressure from the court mounted on the\n\ngovernment to evict encroachers by September 30, 1996, the government\n\nhastily introduced an amendment Bill in the State Assembly.\n\nWhatever may have been the justification for it - the impracticality\n\nof the provisions of the 1975 Act perhaps being the most important one\n\n- it must have been an eye-opener for the mushrooming tribal\n\norganisations in Kerala to see the 140-member State Assembly pass the\n\nKerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction on Transfer of Land and\n\nRestoration of Alienated Lands) Amendment Bill, 1996 almost\n\nunanimously (there was only one dissenting vote).\n\nThe 1996 Amendment Bill dashed all hopes of the Adivasis. Most\n\nimportant, it made legal all transactions of tribal land up to January\n\n24, 1986. In other words, the government made the need for the\n\nrestoration of alienated land (as per the 1975 Act) unnecessary.\n\nAccording to the government, it was the only practical alternative,\n\ngiven the turmoil and the political repercussions that would have been\n\ncreated had it tried to evict the non-tribal settlers. However, the\n\ntribal people felt that the government was trying to give legal\n\nsanctity to the alienation of their land. The agitation in front of\n\nthe State Assembly, with the Adivasis, led by their leader from\n\nWayanad C.K. Janu, trying to enter the State legislature, supported by\n\na group of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) volunteers, was\n\nperhaps an early indication of the gradual transformation of the\n\nagitation.\n\nThis was soon followed by one of the best known incidents in the\n\nstruggle. On October 4, 1996, a so-far unknown extremist group named\n\n\"Ayyankali Pada\" (named after a Dalit leader from Kerala), stormed the\n\nPalakkad Collectorate and held Collector W.R. Reddy hostage for over\n\nnine hours. The incident invited a strong response from the government\n\nagainst growing signs of radicalism among Adivasis and also in a way\n\nprevented the agitation from taking a turn for the worse. Later, the\n\nPresident refused to give assent to the 1996 Amendment Bill passed by\n\nthe State Assembly on the grounds that the 1975 Act had been included\n\nin the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, to bypass this difficulty, yet another Bill was passed\n\nunanimously by the State Assembly in 1999. The Kerala Restriction on\n\nTransfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Bill, 1999,\n\ndefined \"land\" as \"agricultural land\" (a State subject) in order to\n\ntry and get over the need to send it for presidential assent. The new\n\nBill also had a controversial provision to repeal the 1975 Act.\n\nAs per the 1999 Act, only alienated land in excess of two hectares\n\npossessed by encroachers would be restored, while alternative land, in\n\nlieu of the alienated land not exceeding two hectares, would be given\n\nelsewhere. The thinking was that the number of applicants claiming\n\nland in excess of two hectares would be negligible, making restoration\n\nunnecessary. The new Bill also had a provision to provide up to 40\n\nacres (16 hectares) to other landless tribal people - a new set of\n\nbeneficiaries - within two years. The government said that it\n\nestimated that there were about 11,000 such families in the State.\n\nHowever, the High Court rejected both the 1996 and 1999 Amendment\n\nBills and declared the provisions under them illegal. The State\n\ngovernment, in turn, went on appeal to the Supreme Court and obtained\n\nstay orders. Several appeals against the stay orders are pending\n\nbefore the Supreme Court.\n\nIt was in this context that starvation deaths were reported from the\n\nAdivasi-inhabited areas in the State from July 2001. The outside world\n\ncame to know about it only after a group of tribal people, supported\n\nby some naxalite groups, waylaid a mobile store run by the State\n\nDepartment of Civil Supplies and took away its contents. They\n\ndistributed the foodstuffs and encouraged the tribal people who\n\ngathered there to take home the rest of it.\n\nOn August 30, Adivasi agitators led by Janu pitched their tents\n\noutside the Chief Minister's official residence in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nThey were organised under the banner of the \"Adivasi Dalit Action\n\nCouncil\", which now claims to have the support of all Adivasis in the\n\nState. Despite two rounds of discussions with the government, the\n\ntribal people refused to withdraw their agitation, which was more than\n\na month old at the time of writing.\n\nThe main demand of the Adivasis was five acres (2 ha) each to all\n\nlandless tribal families in the State. Although the government's offer\n\nto prepare a master plan for the tribal people was welcomed by the\n\nagitating Adivasis, they refused to withdraw the agitation until their\n\ndemand for land was met. The tribal people have lost their faith in\n\npromises and court cases. They were sure that running after alienated\n\nland was a futile exercise which, even if it succeeded in the long\n\nrun, would benefit only a few among them.\n\nHOWEVER, some disturbing trends have emerged in the course of the\n\nstruggle. The Adavasi-inhabited areas have become breeding grounds for\n\nextremist organisations espousing the tribal cause and swearing to\n\nempower the tribal people in order to fight for their rights. There\n\nhave been sporadic incidents of violence since 1992, when such groups\n\nencouraged the Adivasis to take the law into their own hands and\n\nforcibly occupy government land. Since the 1990s the activities of\n\nHindu chauvinist organisations, Christian missionaries and voluntary\n\nagencies, often funded from abroad, have also increased in the tribal\n\nareas. The past decade saw the disillusioned tribal people move\n\ntantalisingly close to extremism and communalism. Such proclivities\n\nwould certainly undermine their genuine struggle.\n\nYet, for the present, the most significant factor is the shifting\n\nfocus of the demands raised by the Adivasi leaders who are in the\n\nlimelight. They are no longer asking for alienated land, at least not\n\nas emphatically as they used to in the past. Instead they demand\n\nmainly five acres of other land each for all landless tribal families.\n\nAnother demand is the inclusion of tribal areas in the Sixth Schedule\n\nof the Constitution in order to make them autonomous regions.\n\nThe fact that they were able to sustain their agitation by putting up\n\nshacks outside the Secretariat, along the State capital's arterial\n\nroad, and pitching tents on the road to the Chief Minister's official\n\nresidence for more than a month itself took Kerala by surprise. Over\n\n150 tribal families were in these camps, where food and even\n\nfacilities to continue school education of the children were being\n\nprovided by the organisers. A grand council of elders and other\n\nleaders representing the 30-odd tribes in the State was formed under\n\nthe umbrella of the Adivasi Dalit Action Council. As a show of\n\nstrength and as part of an attempt to evolve a consensus regarding\n\ntheir demands among the various tribes and organisations, it organised\n\nan 'Adivasi Gothra Sabha' ('Adivasi Parliament') in Thiruvananthapuram\n\non October 3. As the government announced that it would not allow the\n\ntribal people to establish camps permanently before the Secretariat,\n\nAction Committee chairperson Janu declared that she was going on a\n\n\"fast unto death\" before the Secretariat.\n\nWhile Chief Minister A.K. Antony claimed that his government was more\n\nsympathetic to the tribal people's cause than the previous government,\n\nother leaders of the ruling coalition said there were vested interests\n\nbehind the agitation. There are also allegations that organisations\n\nand political parties more sympathetic to the interests of the settler\n\nfarmers are now supporting the tribal people in order to prevent them\n\nfrom demanding the restoration of alienated land, especially when the\n\nlegality of the amendments striking down the 1975 Act is coming up as\n\nan issue before the Supreme Court.\n\nBut as Janu told Frontline, Kerala's Adivasis are not fighting the\n\nsettler farmers any longer. However, the question whether there are\n\nvested interests behind the Adivasi agitation is overshadowed by\n\nanother one - whether the shift in demand will genuinely help the\n\ntribal people's cause.\n\nhttp://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1821/18210490.htm\n\nVolume 18 - Issue 22, Oct. 27 - Nov. 09, 2001\n\nIndia's National Magazine\n\nfrom the publishers of THE HINDU\n\nPromise of land\n\nKerala's Adivasi Dalit Action Council ends its struggle over land and\n\nlivelihood issues following an agreement with the State government.\n\nR. KRISHNAKUMAR\n\nin Thiruvananthapuram\n\nTHE 48-day-old agitation over land and livelihood issues undertaken\n\nfor the tribal people in Kerala ended on October 16 following a seven-\n\npoint agreement between the State government and the Adivasi Dalit\n\nAction Council. The Adivasi \"refugee camps\" erected by the agitating\n\ntribal people outside the State Secretariat and the Chief Minister's\n\nofficial residence in Thiru-vananthapuram and in the district\n\nheadquarters were dismantled soon afterwards. There was jubilation in\n\nthe streets, and praise for C.K. Janu, chairperson of the Action\n\nCouncil, who led the agitation.\n\nThis is what the Adivasi agitation has seemingly achieved for the 3.2\n\nlakh tribal people:\n\nS. GOPAKUMAR\n\nJubilant Adivasi agitators carry C.K. Janu, chairperson of the\n\nAdivasi Dalit Action Council, in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n* \"Wherever possible\", the government is to provide five acres (two\n\nhectares) of land to each landless Adivasi family; at other places,\n\nthe offer is a minimum of one acre, which can go up to five acres,\n\n\"depending on the availability of land\";\n\n* A five-year livelihood programme is to be implemented in the land\n\nthus provided until it becomes fully productive for Adivasis to\n\nsustain themselves;\n\n* The State is to enact a law to ensure that the land provided to\n\nAdivasis is not alienated as had happened in the past;\n\n* The State Cabinet is soon to pass a resolution asking the Union\n\ngovernment to declare the Adivasi areas in the State as scheduled\n\nareas, bringing them under Schedule V of the Constitution;\n\n* The government also gave a commitment that it will abide by whatever\n\ndecision the Supreme Court takes on its appeal against the Kerala High\n\nCourt order quashing the unpopular law (the Kerala Restriction on\n\nTransfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Bill, 1999)\n\npassed by the State Assembly in 1999;\n\n* The government is to implement a master plan for tribal development\n\nand the plan is to be prepared with the participation of Adivasis;\n\n* The maximum possible extent of land will be found and distributed in\n\nWayanad district - at least 10,000 acres - where there is the largest\n\nconcentration of landless Adivasis.\n\nThe agitators' demand that all landless Adivasi families must be given\n\nfive acres each has not been conceded. Chief Minister A.K. Antony told\n\nFrontline it was impossible for any government to agree to such a\n\ndemand in a State where there was so much pressure on land. But the\n\ngovernment had readily agreed to provide at least one acre during its\n\nearlier round of discussions with leaders of the Action Council and\n\nother tribal organisations (Frontline, October 26).\n\nIn effect, this is what the Action Council accepted eventually.\n\nThis does not mean that the agitation was a failure. For the first\n\ntime, landless Adivasis in Kerala have got a firm commitment from the\n\ngovernment on at least one acre of land. They are also to get the\n\nprotection of a new law preventing any further alienation of their\n\nland. In Janu's own Wayanad district, the government is to make an\n\nextra effort to find more land for Adivasis.\n\nPerhaps the most important fallout of the latest agitation is that\n\nboth the government and the Action Council leaders have succeeded in\n\nshifting the focus of the nearly 50-year-old tribal struggle in Kerala\n\nfrom the issue of \"restoration of alienated land\" to one of \"land for\n\nthe landless tribal people\".\n\nIn short, whether Adivasis are any better off as a result of the\n\nagitation will be known only in January 2002, when the government, as\n\nper its promise, has to start distributing the land. The\n\nidentification of the beneficiaries would prove a major hurdle in the\n\ninterim period.\n\nhttp://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1822/18220420.htm\n\nOpinion - News Analysis\n\nBehind the Adivasi unrest in Assam\n\nM.S. Prabhakara\n\nThe Adivasis’ fight is not so much for their recognition as a tribal\n\ncommunity as for the restoration of the tribal identity to which they\n\nbelieve they are entitled.\n\n— Photo: Ritu Raj Konwar\n\nVigilantist retaliation: Local residents of Dispur and Beltola beat up\n\nAdivasi protesters in Guwahati on November 24.\n\nThe continuing violence in Assam over the last few days, in particular\n\nthe wanton vandalism and the crude and vigilantist retaliation that\n\ntook place in and around Dispur in Guwahati on November 24, has\n\nrightly attracted wide and critical notice. However, any exclusive\n\nconcern with the violent events of that Saturday, in particular the\n\nvoyeuristic focus by the visual media on the shameful attack on the\n\nperson and personal dignity of a young woman by the mob that has been\n\nunreservedly condemned by the people of the State, may obscure the\n\nreal issues: the demand of the Adivasis for classification as a\n\nScheduled Tribe, and the complex factors that inform the resistance to\n\nthat and similar demands.\n\nThe Adivasi, a nomenclature now adopted by the approximately 20\n\nmillion strong Tea Garden Labour and ex-Tea Garden Labour community,\n\nis not the only community in Assam seeking classification as a\n\nScheduled Tribe. Five other communities (the Tai-Ahom, the Moran, the\n\nMotok, the Chutia and the Koch-Rajbongshi), all presently classified\n\nas Other Backward Classes (OBC), have also for long been pressing for\n\nrecognition as Scheduled Tribes. The first four live predominantly in\n\nthe districts of Upper Assam while the Koch-Rajbongshi live\n\npredominantly in western Assam, sharing broadly the same physical (and\n\npolitical) space as the Bodos, the most numerous of the tribal\n\ncommunities of the State. The Adivasis are, for the most part, settled\n\nin the vicinity of the tea gardens.\n\nContrary to the general impression, the clashes do not bespeak any\n\ndeeply ingrained hostility between ‘tribal people and non-tribal\n\npeople,’ or between the tribal people and caste Hindus, in Assam — a\n\nconvenient distinction between supposedly irreconcilable categories\n\nmade in much of the analysis of the so-called ethnic clashes in Assam\n\nand the north-eastern region. The Adivasis, though aspiring for\n\nrecognition as a tribal community and indeed historically belonging to\n\nauthentic tribal stock, are at present not recognised as a tribal\n\ncommunity. It is only in popular usage that they are referred to as\n\nTea Garden Tribes and ex-Tea Garden Tribes. Strictly speaking, their\n\nfight is not so much for their recognition as a tribal community as\n\nfor the restoration of that tribal identity to which they believe they\n\nare entitled, being the descendants of various tribal communities of\n\nCentral India who, over a century-and-a-half ago, went or were\n\nindentured to work in the gardens of eastern India. What they are\n\nfighting for is therefore the restoration of their legitimate cultural\n\npatrimony.\n\nWhy and how did the descendants of the tribal people whose ancestors\n\nwere brought to Assam from other parts of India cease to be tribal\n\npeople in their present environment? The answer lies in the peculiar\n\nrules that determine such recognition, according to which a person’s\n\ntribal identity is irrevocably and forever linked to her or his place\n\nof origin — in the present instance, the persons’ ancestral origins.\n\nFor instance, the progeny of a Munda, a recognised tribal community in\n\nJharkhand and other contiguous States, one of the 96 communities\n\nlisted under the category, Tea Garden Labourers, Tea Garden Tribes, Ex-\n\nTea Garden Labourers and Ex-Tea Garden Tribes in the official ‘Central\n\nList of Backward Classes, Assam,’ who was taken to Assam to work in\n\nthe tea gardens over a century-and-a-half ago has lost his tribal\n\nidentity, though were such a person to return to his (now notional)\n\nancestral place, he would regain his tribal identity.\n\nSuch absurd rules and requirements do not however obtain in other\n\ncases of migration. A non-tribal person moving, say, from Karnataka to\n\nAssam continues to retain all the socio-cultural coordinates of his or\n\nher identity.\n\nIndeed such absurd anomalies govern even the movement of tribal\n\ncommunities within Assam, and in the States that were carved out of\n\ncolonial Assam after independence. For instance, the 23 recognised\n\ntribal communities in Assam are broadly identified under two\n\ncategories: the Hill Tribes, that is, the 14 communities recognised as\n\n‘tribal’ in the ‘hill areas,’ now comprising the two Autonomous\n\nDistricts of Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills; and the Plains\n\nTribes, that is, the 9 communities recognised as ‘tribal’ in rest of\n\nAssam, supposedly all ‘Plain’. Neither of the locational\n\nidentifications is accurate, indeed cannot be accurate, given the\n\nfacts of geography but that is the least of the problems.\n\nMore materially, neither of these two categories carries its tribal\n\nidentity when it moves out of its ‘designated areas.’ Thus, Census\n\nfigures for Guwahati city, very much in the Plains of Assam, which has\n\npeople from every part of the country and also from foreign parts, do\n\nnot enumerate a single person belonging to any of the 14 ‘Hill Tribe’\n\ncategories. Indeed, every Plains district enumerates zero population\n\nof Hill Tribes.\n\nSimilarly, the Census figures for the two Hill districts do not\n\nenumerate a single person from any of the nine designated ‘Plains\n\nTribe’ categories. The reality is different; however such personas\n\nliving outside their allotted spaces are for official purposes simply\n\nmade ‘un-persons’.\n\nWhile the Adivasis’ case for the restoration of their primordial\n\ntribal status seems strongest, the issues and demands underlying the\n\nstruggle of the five other communities seeking recognition as\n\nScheduled Tribes are equally complex. The Koch-Rajbongshi, also known\n\nas Sarania Kachari, historically part of the Bodo Kachari stock, lost\n\ntheir tribal identity over a long period going back to the days before\n\nthe colonial conquest of Assam through a complex process of conversion\n\nand acculturation into the Vaishnavite variety of Assamese Hinduism.\n\nSuch advantages as the conversion may have brought have lost their\n\nrelevance in post-independence India where, increasingly, the tribal\n\nidentity is getting to be perversely privileged by non-tribal\n\ncommunities. Corresponding urges and expectations no doubt drive the\n\ndemands of the other communities seeking to be classified as Scheduled\n\nTribes.\n\nThe State government says it is not opposed to conceding the demands\n\nbut has pleaded its inability in view of the existing rules. There are\n\nindications that these rigidities may be relaxed, at least in respect\n\nof the Adivasi demand. However, if the Adivasi demand is conceded, the\n\ndemands of other communities too will have to be eventually conceded.\n\nThe issue also has national implications, in the context of the\n\ncontradictions highlighted in the presently dormant Gujjar agitation\n\nfor classification as ST.\n\nThe more immediate opposition in Assam to the extension of ST\n\nrecognition to the six communities is however likely to come from the\n\npresently recognised Scheduled Tribes. The estimated 20 lakh Adivasis\n\nconstitute about 60 per cent of the total ST population of the State\n\nwhich, according to the 2001 Census, was 3,308,570.\n\nThe addition of such a large population to the present ST pool will\n\nundoubtedly affect existing allocations in areas such as reservation\n\nof seats in legislative structures, higher education and jobs. Put\n\nsimply, such identity struggles carry a cost, and a price.\n\n(For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Manufacturing\n\nIdentities?

There\n\nis a marked increase in news items which claim that a gruesome murder\n\nof an elderly couple was committed by a group of Sansis who robbed\n\nthem of all their valuables, or that a woman living alone was brutally\n\ndone to death in the dead of night by a group of Pardhis. There are\n\nalso frequent television programmes on these communities putting the\n\nfear of the devil in the minds of the terrified spectator, and the\n\nvery words \"criminal tribes\" have become synonymous with criminality\n\nof a mindless, violent kind.\n\nWho are these so called criminal tribes - Sansis, Pardhis, Kanjars,\n\nGujjars, Bawarias, Banjaras and almost 200 such communities? Is it\n\njust a descriptive label, or is it a category of some special new kind\n\nof criminals? Such a terror in the public mind is being fanned\n\nregarding these people that public lynchings of a hapless Sansi or\n\nPardhi have already become acceptable to even civilised members of our\n\nincreasingly brutalised society.\n\nA visit to localities where most of these people drudge out their\n\ndaily lives may reveal the grossest poverty and want, shocking even to\n\nthose hardened eyes which daily witness sickly, hungry, unwashed,\n\nunclothed children at every major crossing in the Capital. The\n\nquestion then to be asked is this: if all members of such communities\n\nare merciless robbers, why then, does the community live in appalling\n\nconditions of poverty?\n\nShashi Shetye\n\nMoreover, even educated members of these communities, who constitute a\n\nfew first-generation office-goers or professionals, are subjected to\n\nthe deep suspicion and insults by the wider society when they set out\n\nto look for jobs, and at their workplaces: there is constant,\n\nrelentless humiliation they have to suffer at the hands of\n\n\"respectable\" people. Swimming against the tide each day, they\n\nstruggle to enter the virtuous cycle of education, work and\n\nrespectability which has eluded them and their children for several\n\ngenerations. Since \"criminal tribes\" make such sensational headlines\n\nso frequently, the phenomenon needs to be examined historically in\n\nsome detail.\n\nShashi Shetye\n\nThe people mentioned above are a staggering 60 million in number, and\n\nfall in the category of today's Denotified Tribes. The term \"criminal\n\ntribes\" was concocted by the British rulers, and entered the public\n\nvocabulary for the first time when a piece of legislation called the\n\nCriminal Tribes Act was passed in 1871. With the repeal of this Act\n\n(which was condemned by Pandit Nehru as a blot on the legal books of\n\nfree India, and a shame to all civilised societies) these communities\n\nwere officially \"denotified\" in 1952.\n\nIntensive research on the issue shows that about 150 years ago, a\n\nlarge number of tribal communities were still nomadic, and were\n\nconsidered useful, honourable people by members of the settled\n\nsocieties with whom they came into regular contact. A number of them\n\nwere small itinerant traders who used to carry their wares on the\n\nbacks of their cattle, and bartered their goods in the villages\n\nthrough which they passed. They would bring interesting items to which\n\npeople of a particular village and a little further away - spices,\n\nhoney, grain of different varieties, medicinal herbs, different kinds\n\nof fruit or vegetables which the region did not grow, and so on.\n\nAlmost invariably, nomadic people were craftsmen of some kind or the\n\nother and in addition to their trading activity they would make and\n\nsell all sorts of useful little items like mats and baskets, brooms\n\nand brushes or earthenware utensils. Some like the Banjaras or\n\nLambadis functioned on a larger scale, and moved in larger groups with\n\npack animals loaded mainly with salt, and their women in addition to\n\nthe salt also bartered the exquisitely crafted silver trinkets with\n\nsettled villagers.\n\nStan Thekaekara\n\nSome nomadic communities also became cattle traders, herdspeople or\n\nsellers of milk products, since they bred their own cattle for\n\ncarrying their merchandise. The nomadic communities were not just\n\nuseful to the villagers on a day to day basis - they were also\n\nacknowledged for averting the frequent grain shortages and famine like\n\nconditions in villages where crops failed. In addition, among them\n\nwere musicians, acrobats, dancers, tightrope walkers, jugglers and\n\nfortune tellers. On the whole, they were considered a welcome and\n\ncolourful change in routine whenever they visited or camped near a\n\nvillage.\n\nThere were several reasons for these communities first becoming\n\ngradually marginalised, and finally beginning to be considered useless\n\nto the settled societies. First, the network of roads and railways\n\nestablished in the 1850s connected many of the earlier outlying\n\nvillages to each other as also to cities and towns.\n\nThe scale of the operations of the nomadic traders was thus\n\ndrastically cut down to only those areas where wheel traffic could not\n\nyet reach. This was the single most important reason for the loss of\n\nlivelihood of a number of nomadic communities. Further, under newly\n\nimposed forest laws, the British government did not allow tribal\n\ncommunities to graze their cattle in the forests, or to collect bamboo\n\nand leaves either, which were needed for making simple items like mats\n\nand baskets for their own use and for selling. These two developments\n\nhad disastrous consequences for the nomadic traders.\n\nThere was one other major historical factor responsible for the\n\nimpoverishment of a very large number of nomadic communities. The\n\nnineteenth century witnessed repeated severe famines - during each\n\nsuccessive one the nomadic communities lost more and more heads of\n\ncattle which were the only means of transporting their goods to the\n\ninterior villages. The cattle were in fact becoming more crucial than\n\never, as with increasing network of roads and railways these\n\ncommunities had to travel longer distances to sell their wares. Loss\n\nof cattle meant loss of trading activity on an unprecedented scale.\n\nThe British government gradually began to consider nomadic communities\n\nprone to criminality in the absence of legitimate means of livelihood.\n\nThere was a parallel process taking place all along. A number of\n\ntribal chiefs, especially in the north, participated in the 1857\n\nevents, and earned the title of traitors and renegades with the\n\nBritish government. Elsewhere, hill tribes determinedly resisted the\n\nattempts by the British to annexe their land for establishing\n\nplantations, and to try and use them as plantation labour. A number of\n\ntribal communities, thus, would not yield to the British armed forces\n\nand consistently fought back, though whole habitations were burnt down\n\nin retaliation by the frustrated British officers deputed to co-opt\n\nthem. Generally, it began to be felt that most tribal communities,\n\nincluding nomadic ones, were dangerously criminal. The Criminal Tribes\n\nAct was born in these historical circumstances.\n\nA large number of communities were officially declared criminal tribes\n\nfrom 1871 onwards. The British government subsequently ran special\n\nsettlements for them where they were chained, shackled, caned and\n\nflogged while being surrounded by high walls under the provisions of\n\nthe Criminal Tribes Act. In the name of the homegrown science of\n\n\"curocriminology\" it was declared that they would be cured of their\n\ncriminal propensities if they were given work and such an\n\nunderstanding had an obvious corollary: the more they work, the more\n\nreformed they would be. They could be thus forced to work for up to 20\n\nhours a day in factories, plantations, mills, quarries and mines all\n\nthrough the first few decades of the twentieth century. This was an\n\nera when the Factories Act had come into existence, but the British\n\nemployers were officially able to do away with those provisions of the\n\nFactories Act which restricted the number of hours of work in a day,\n\nor number of days in a week, or allowed minimal facilities at the\n\nworkplace.\n\nAshish Kothari\n\nAn important point for our purposes here is that the British\n\ngovernment was able to summon a large amount of public support,\n\nincluding the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such\n\ncommunities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely\n\nas a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work.\n\nHowever, when they tried to make a living like everybody else, they\n\ndid not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice\n\nand ostracisation. This curious logic and anomalous situation has\n\ncontinued to this day.\n\nOnce more we are at a juncture when the issue of \"criminal tribes\"\n\nneeds to be reviewed so that the wider public, 130 years later, does\n\nnot end up supporting measures to \"flush them out\" of the existing\n\nsystem. What needs to be emphasised here is that police harassment and\n\nrounding up of \"criminal tribes\" in the last few years has not\n\nimproved the crime situation on the ground. Less obtrusively and much\n\nless glaringly, news items of the following kind have also appeared in\n\nprint which were earlier asserting to the contrary, confirming that\n\nthe worst criminal gangs are not constituted by the members of\n\ndenotified communities: \"Police still baffled by attacks on\n\nfarmhouse\" (Indian Express, January 21, 1998), \"Many sensational\n\nmurders remain unsolved\" (Hindustan Times, November 27, 1999).\n\nAs has happened all through the history of denotified tribes,\n\nconfessions are wrested out of \"busted gangs\" of Bawar"
