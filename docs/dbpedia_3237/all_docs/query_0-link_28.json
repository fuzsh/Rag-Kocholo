Over a median period of 0.57 year (IQR 0.26–1.71), 23 (54.7%) patients achieved and were maintained in steroid-free remission (survival curve analyses 56.3% at 1-year follow-up). Two (40%) paediatric CD cases achieved steroid-free remission (range 0.44–0.49 years). 19 of 34 (55.9%) patients on fortnightly therapy required dose escalation to 40 mg weekly (0.65 years IQR 0.13–1.44). 7 (63.6%) primary non-responders to infliximab achieved and maintained steroid-free remission (median 0.80 years follow-up IQR 0.44–1.87). There were 4 (9.5%) serious complications requiring permanent discontinuation of Adalimumab therapy: 2 patients developed serious infective complications (severe facial cellulitis and psoas abscess secondary to colonic perforation, after 8 weeks and 2.6 years of therapy), one patient developed lung cancer and one with central demyelinating illness (after 1.7 years and 9 weeks of therapy respectively). No patients developed infusion reactions.\n\nConclusion: Adalimumab is efficacious in the treatment of patients with refractory CD, with particular benefit in patients who have lost response or developed adverse reaction to infliximab. In this audit, we also present data for the first time in paediatric Crohn’s disease. However, many patients require escalation of dosing regime. Moreover, the treatment carries definite risks of serious adverse events, and careful patient selection, and continuous monitoring is needed.\n\nONCE- VERSUS TWICE-DAILY MESALAZINE (PENTASA) GRANULES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS: RESULTS FROM A MULTINATIONAL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL\n\nA. Dignass1, H. Veerman2. 1Head Department of Medicine I, Markus-Krankenhaus, Frankfurter Diakonie-Kliniken, Frankfurt-Main, Germany, 2Medical, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands\n\nIntroduction: Patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC) do not frequently adhere to prescribed mesalazine treatment. This is, in part, due to the low acceptability of currently available mesalazine formulations, which often require multiple-daily dosing regimens and a high number of tablets. Non-compliance is directly linked to relapse and disease exacerbation. This study investigated remission and relapse rates in patients with UC in remission receiving once daily (od) a single 2 g mesalazine granules sachet or twice daily (bd) a 1 g mesalazine granules sachet.\n\nAims & Methods: A 12-month, multicentre investigator-blinded randomised controlled trial. Patients with mild to moderate UC in remission who had had a relapse within the past year were randomised to receive either mesalazine granules 2 g/day given od or bd. Clinical evaluations were undertaken at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority (defined as not more than 10% less efficacy below the od treatment) of the two regimes in terms of probability to remain in clinical and endoscopic remission during one year defined by an UCDAI score of <2, or an UCDAI of 2 without any adjustment of therapy. Treatment difference was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.\n\nResults: 362 patients were randomised. At end-of-study, 73.8% and 63.6% of patients in the od and bd groups were in clinical and endoscopic remission, respectively. The difference between the two treatment groups after one year was significantly above the non-inferiority limit with a treatment difference of 11.9% in favour of od (p = 0.024). Once daily dosing had a higher compliance than bd dosing in terms of % sachets used. Patient questionnaires yielded higher compliance scores for od than bd (p<0.05) and patient acceptability of treatment was significantly better for od (96.3% vs 85.6%, p<0.001) at end-of-study.\n\nConclusion: Once-daily 2 g mesalazine granules sachets (PENTASA) are an effective maintenance therapy in patients with mild to moderate UC. A once daily dosing regimen using a single 2 g sachet is not only non-inferior but even superior to twice daily dosing. Mesalazine granules taken once daily (2 g) ensure better remission rates, patient compliance and acceptability than twice-daily (2×1 g) administration.\n\nEndoscopy free papers\n\nCAN DEATH FOLLOWING ERCP BE PREDICTED? RESULTS OF A LARGE SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDY\n\nE. J. Williams. On behalf of the BSG audit of ERCP Steering Committee, British Society of Gastroenterology, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: The incidence of early mortality (from all causes) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is rarely described in prospective studies, though retrospective analyses of deaths suggest patient selection could be improved.\n\nAims & Methods: The aims are to examine 30-day mortality following ERCP, and identify independent predictors of early death. Results are derived from a prospective multicentre study of ERCP complications, based in 5 English regions. Where patients consented to follow-up, death within 30 days of ERCP was identified through contact with carers and interrogation of hospital electronic records. Where patients did not consent to follow-up mortality was calculated from death registrations. Binary regression analysis of participating patients’ first recorded procedures identified independent risk factors for early mortality.\n\nResults: A total of 6910 ERCPs were performed in 66 centres during the study period. Consent for detailed follow-up was acquired for 5264 procedures, performed on 4561 patients. A therapeutic intervention was attempted in 3447/4561 (76%) of these patients as part of their first recorded ERCP. In total 121 participating patients (2.7%) died within 30 days of first recorded ERCP. Thirty-day mortality among non-participating patients was calculated to be higher (92/1646; 5.6%). Closer examination of participating patients revealed 18/121 deaths were directly attributable to the patient’s first recorded ERCP, with a further 2/121 deaths attributable to a second ERCP performed within 30 days of the first procedure. The remaining 101/121 deaths resulted from progression of the underlying disease process (which was carcinoma in 82 cases). Risk factors for death (OR, 95% CI) among participating patients were: ASA score (120.1, 24.5 to 588, when ASA 5 patients were compared to ASA 1 patients); a malignant indication for ERCP (2.94, 1.67 to 5.15); lower albumin (1.05, 1.02 to 1.08 for every g/l decrease); ln bilirubin (1.49, 1.18 to 1.88) and ln white cell count (1.54, 1.09 to 4).\n\nConclusion: The extrapolated 30-day mortality following ERCP, based on participating and non-participating patients is 3.4%. While detailed analysis was limited to 5264/6910 procedures, results suggest that most deaths arise from progression of underlying disease, rather than as a result of ERCP itself. ASA score and pre-ERCP diagnosis are identified as important predictors of outcome.\n\nVALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF AN ACCREDITATION ASSESSMENT FOR COLONOSCOPY\n\nR. Barton. For the Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, Newcastle University and Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK\n\nIntroduction: After national audit demonstrated very variable quality of colonoscopy, the introduction of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme prompted the introduction of a searching assessment to select the screening programme’s future colonoscopists. Leading endoscopists, trainers and the JAG collaborated to develop an appropriate assessment tool after consultation with clinical educationalists in 3 countries. This comprised performance data, a knowledge test (MCQ), and a DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) assessment.\n\nAims & Methods: The aims of this study are to determine the validity and reliability of the assessment. A true/false 30 item × 5 answer MCQ was devised covering key issues. To ensure both professional and educational input, DOPS forms from two centres were reviewed by the Trainers Group appointed under the NHS National Endoscopy Training Programme, and important colonoscopy skills were identified and amalgamated into domains. Detailed descriptors for all skill levels were written for each domain. An outline curriculum was published, and assessors underwent both the assessment and further assessor training. Self-reported, verified, performance and demographic data, as well as assessment data both from the MCQ and DOPS over two cases by two assessors were collected prospectively from 76 candidates. Semi-structured questionnaires were collected from candidates and 17 assessors on the validity of the assessment.\n\nResults: Colonoscopists submitted performance data and attempted the assessment. In 2284 paired judgments over 76 candidates during a total of 151 cases, overall there was 96% congruence of agreement across the pass/fail divide (98% for major domains), and high absolute congruence between assessors in many domains, for example 72.4% for “communication”, 69% “maintains luminal views”, 73% “uses torque steering” and 81% “adequate mucosal visualisation”. The expert global opinion agreed with the grading system in 74/76 (97%) of cases. Gradings correlated weakly with self-reported caecal intubation rates and MCQ scores (r = 0.24 and 0.27, p<0.01) respectively. No correlation was seen between the grading and colonoscopies in previous year. Overall 27/30 candidates felt the DOPS assessment was fair/very fair, while 27/32 felt the MCQ was fair/very fair. Of the assessors, 12/16 felt the DOPS was valid/very valid, while 17/17 overall felt the process was fair/very fair.\n\nConclusion: The DOPS accreditation has good face and content validity, and very high reliability across the crucial pass/fail divide. There is ongoing work improving the MCQ.\n\nBOWEL CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMME ONE YEAR IN: EXPERIENCE OF A SINGLE FIRST WAVE CENTRE\n\nM. R. Tighe1, M. G. Phillips1, W. S. L. Stebbings2, B. Brett1, A. Cook1. 1Department of Gastroenterology, 2Department of Surgery, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, UK\n\nIntroduction: The Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital was one of the first centres to launch the national bowel cancer screening programme, commencing in July 2006. The NNUH started covering a population of 550 000 based in mid Norfolk, with an estimated 68 000 falling into the 60–70-year-old age group. In June 2007, the population covered by screening in Norwich was expanded to the whole county of Norfolk with a population of 900 000.\n\nAims & Methods: A year on, we have reviewed our work to date to see if our results reflect the experience drawn for the large scale FOB trials and the pilot sites.\n\nResults: Uptake for the programme has been high at 67%. In the first year, 53 711 invitation FOB kits were sent out, with 2933 over 70-year-olds requesting additional kits. 35 592 FOB kits have been returned with a positivity rate of 1.65% (584). Among these 584, 71 FOBT +ve were over the age of 70. 99% of patients attended pre-assessment and only 4 were deemed unsuitable for colonoscopy and underwent CT colonography instead. Colonoscopy was complete in 98.9% and 6 cases went on to have a CT colonography to complete the examination. Pathology detected: In year one 84 cancers have been detected (14.8% of colonoscopies)—23 were polyp cancers, an additional 10 cases were staged as Dukes A, 15 cases as Dukes B and 19 cases as Dukes C. 17 patients are awaiting final staging and surgery. All 23 polyp cancers were removed endoscopically. Six went on to have a segmental resection for poor prognostic features with no evidence of residual disease being found. Overall, 56% of cancer detected in screening population were Dukes A, 21% Dukes B and 23% Dukes C. Among over 70-year-old self-referrers, 14.6% with FOBT +ve had cancer, staged as Dukes A 18%, Dukes B 27% and Dukes C 55%, mirroring the symptomatic service. 49% of patients had adenomas at colonoscopy, subdividing into 13% high risk adenomas, 54% intermediate risk and 34% low risk adenomas. 35% of colonoscopies were normal. Complications: One patient has died following surgical removal of a caecal adenoma. Two patients have bled post large polypectomy, one of whom required surgery—the other settled spontaneously.\n\nConclusion: The first year experience of the screening programme supports the trial and pilot study data. The detection of predominant early stage disease amongst the screened population infers that the trial benefits in terms of mortality from colorectal cancer will be seen in our population. The programme has been very well received by the public. We are targeting publicity to those geographical areas of lower take-up.\n\nCOMPARISON OF HIGH RESOLUTION MAGNIFICATION ENDOSCOPY, NARROW BAND IMAGING WITH MAGNIFICATION AND CHROMOENDOSCOPY WITH MAGNIFICATION IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF COLORECTAL NEOPLASIA: A FEASIBILITY STUDY\n\nR. Singh1, A. Shonde1, P. Kaye2, C. J. Hawkey1, K. Ragunath1. 1Wolfson Digestive Diseases Centre, 2Department of Histopathology, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, Nottingham, UK\n\nIntroduction: With the emergence of colorectal cancer screening, the distinction between non-neoplastic from neoplastic colorectal polyps during colonoscopy is paramount. A suitable technique which allows this differentiation could increase the efficiency of treatment by eliminating additional cost associated with unnecessary biopsies. Although chromoendoscopy (CHR) has been propagated as a technique that improves prediction of polyp histology, it has failed to be incorporated into routine practice. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a novel endoscopic imaging technique which is relatively simple to use and simulates CHR during the procedure.\n\nAims & Methods: We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy (Acc) of three different techniques: conventional high resolution white light endoscopy (WLE), NBI and CHR, all with magnification in differentiating adenocarcinomas, adenomatous and hyperplastic colorectal polyps. Each lesion was sequentially assessed first by WLE, followed by NBI and finally by CHR. Digital images of each polyp with each modality were taken. Biopsies or polypectomies were then performed followed by blinded histopathological analysis. Each image was then blindly graded based on the Kudo’s pit pattern (KPP). In the assessment with NBI, the meshbrown capillary network pattern (MBCN) of each polyp was also described. The PPV, NPV and Acc of differentiating hyperplastic (Type I & II - KPP, Type I - MBCN) adenomatous (Types III, IV - KPP, Type II - MBCN) and carcinomatous polyps (Type V- KPP, Type III- MCBN) were then compared with reference to the final histopathological diagnosis.\n\nResults: A total of 50 colorectal polyps (5 adenocarcinomas, 38 adenomas, 7 hyperplastic) in 37 patients (25 men, mean age 68.5 years) were assessed. Morphologically, 19 were classified as type Is, 6 type Ip, 24 type IIa and 1 type IIa-c polyps. The PPV, NPV and Acc of the various modalities are depicted in the table.\n\nConclusion: NBI was superior to WLE and CHR if both the KPP and MBCN criteria were combined and applied in the prediction of non-neoplastic and neoplastic colorectal polyps. This feasibility study demonstrated that this combined classification for NBI could potentially be useful in routine clinical practice, allowing the endoscopist to predict histology with higher accuracies.\n\nCONFOCAL ENDOMICROSCOPIC LASER SCANNING IN VIVO CELLULAR IMAGING OF BARRETT’S OESOPHAGUS: FIRST PROOF OF ENDOSCOPIC CONCEPT IN THE UK\n\nD. P. Hurlstone, N. Tiffin, S. S. Cross. Endoscopy, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Confocal laser scanning endomicroscopy permits cellular resolution imaging in vivo during ongoing video endoscopy. Microvascular architecture and connective tissue stroma can be visualised to a depth of 250 μm. In Barrett’s oesophagus, specialised columnar epithelium presents in a “patchy” distribution. Previous studies assessing magnification +/− chromoscopy have failed to show a definitive clinical advantage compared to quadrantic biopsies alone.\n\nAims & Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of live cellular endomicroscopic imaging for the in vivo diagnosis of Barrett’s epithelium during ongoing video endoscopy. Consecutive patients with long-term reflux, known Barrett’s oesophagus or patients with known complicating IN were recruited. Endomicroscopy following methylene blue 0.1% chromoscopy was performed using topical acroflavin for surface mucosal nuclear imaging in addition to 5 ml of iv 10% sodium fluorescene for deep z-axis vascular imaging. Endomicroscopy was performed at 10 mm quadrantic segmental intervals and targeted to focal mucosal defects unmasked by chromoscopy—classified according Paris guidelines. Confocal greyscale macro data were collected at 1.6 frames/sec/optical z-axis sectioning 0.7 μm—field view 500 μm×500 μm, minimum 12 macros per segment. The in vivo endomicroscopic diagnosis (according to Mainz criteria) was then compared to targeted biopsies equating to the raster scanned mucosal segment taken as the gold standard.\n\nResults: 48 patients completed the endomicroscopy protocol-median duration of procedure 18 min (range 10–32)/median Barrett’s length 3.4 cm (range 1–12). A total of 9216 endomicroscopy images from 243 target sites were analysed. The in vivo diagnosis of Barrett’s oesophagus using endomicroscopic vascular and cell architecture criteria was predicted with a sensitivity 94.3%/specificity 91.8%/PPV 94.8% and NPV of 96.4%. Basement membrane integrity loss, sub-epithelial vascular tortousity +/− leakage and irregular dark epithelial cell architecture were highly predictive of high-grade dysplasia in vivo (sensitivity 88.1%/specificity 94.1%)/K = 0.88.\n\nConclusion: Endomicroscopy permits live cellular, sub-cellular and deep vascular imaging of high quality during ongoing video endoscopy. In vivo cellular-vascular architecture has a high correlation with ex vivo histopathology and may prove a novel tool in the rapid diagnosis of Barrett’s oesophagus and associated neoplasia. Multiple optical biopsy sites can be obtained in vivo without white light “field loss” due to biopsy site bleeding. Targeted high quality specimens can improve histopathological processing and patient “flow” in endoscopy.\n\nCATCHING THE BIT IN BETWEEN: ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND-GUIDED MURAL TRUCUT BIOPSIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF THICKENED OESOPHAGOGASTRIC WALL\n\nT. Thomas1, P. Kaye2, K. Ragunath1, G. Aithal1. 1Gastroenterology, 2Histopathology, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, QMC Campus, Nottingham, UK\n\nIntroduction: A thickened oesophagogastric wall (OGW) in patients with alarm symptoms raise the possibility of malignancy, but establishing a tissue diagnosis may be difficult as mucosal biopsies are usually negative. Using linear array endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) it is possible to target and biopsy the thickened part of the gut wall.1\n\nAims & Methods: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EUS-guided transmural biopsies in detecting underlying malignancy in patients with thickened oesophagogastric wall and negative mucosal biopsies. Patients were referred for EUS guided sampling as a part of their clinical management. Linear array echoendoscope (GF-UCT240-AL5, Olympus- KeyMed) and 19 G Trucut needle (Wilson Cook, Quickcore) were used for sampling. A previously described technique was used for mural biopsy.1 Clinical and investigatory data were collected prospectively from 2004 to date.\n\nResults: Thirty one patients (19 men) aged 60–74 years (median 68) were included. All patients had thickened oesophageal wall (n = 10), gastric wall (n = 20) or both on CT scan. Prior to EUS, patients had 1–5 (median 1.2) endoscopies and 2–8 mucosal biopsies. The mean oesophageal and gastric wall thickness was 12 and 18 mm respectively. During sampling 1–5 (median 3) needle punctures were made. On EUS trucut biopsy, adequate specimen was obtained for histology in 25/31 (80.6%) although biopsies were fragmented in 16/31 (51.6%) patients. The size of the samples were 4–10 (median 6) mm. Malignancy was confirmed in 17/31 patients (54%) on histology and in 11/31 patients (35.5%) an underlying malignancy was excluded (confirmed at a median follow-up 12 months). There was no significant correlation between wall thickness and biopsy size (Rho, 0.11, 95% CI −0.25 to 0.45, two sided p = 0.53). Transmural biopsies have a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 94% respectively. The positive and negative predictive value was 94% and 77% respectively. There were no major immediate or late complications\n\nConclusion: EUS-guided trucut biopsy is a safe and useful technique in the investigation of thickened oesophagogastric wall with a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of cancer.\n\nDEDICATED BLEED UNITS: SHOULD THEY BE ADVOCATED?\n\nR.

Department of Gastroenterology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGH) is a common emergency, however dedicated bleed units with 24-hour endoscopy are still only available in selected hospitals. A previous study from this unit supported a lower case mix adjusted mortality rate in a specialised bleed unit.\n\nAims & Methods: To evaluate the re-bleeding and mortality rate of patients admitted with UGH to the Sheffield Bleed Unit in comparison to the National Audit and previous performance. Notes of patients admitted between January 2005 and December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively for demographics, Rockall and Child Pugh scores and outcome. Multiple logistic regression was performed.\n\nResults: 66% were emergency admissions, while 23% were tertiary referrals and 11% were current inpatients. 29% of gastroscopies were done out of hours while 82% were within 24 hours. The table tabulates results with a comparison to the previous study and the National Audit. In the 2005–6 cohort, pre and post-endoscopy Rockall scores were predictive of re-bleeding (p = 0.013, p = 0.045) and mortality (p = 0.003, p = 0.01) while only the Child Pugh was predictive of mortality in liver patients (p = 0.002). Compared to the previous cohort, a reduction in the number of bleeding points identified at endoscopy and the number of patients requiring surgery may reflect the vigorous use of intravenous proton pump inhibitors pre-endoscopy and the aggressive endoscopic intervention performed in our unit.\n\nConclusion: This study has shown that in comparison to the National Audit, the re-bleeding rate and mortality is consistently lower in both cohorts of patients admitted to our bleed unit over time. This further supports the evidence to encourage the development of dedicated bleed units across the UK.\n\nPATIENT POSITION CHANGES DURING COLONOSCOPE WITHDRAWAL INCREASE ADENOMA DETECTION: A RANDOMISED, CROSSOVER TRIAL\n\nJ. E. East1, P. Bassett1, M. Stavrinidis1, N. Arebi1, S. Thomas-Gibson1, T. Guenther2, B. P. Saunders1. 1Wolfson Unit for Endoscopy, 2Academic Department of Cellular Pathology, St Mark’s Hospital, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Colonoscopy has a miss rate for adenomas which may partly relate to poor visualisation of the colonic surface. Position changes during colonoscope withdrawal can improve luminal distension.1\n\nAims & Methods: We aimed to assess whether position changes during colonoscope withdrawal improve adenoma and polyp detection. 130 patients attending for routine colonoscopy underwent back-to-back segmental examination of the colon proximal to the sigmoid-descending junction, randomised to have the first examination in either left lateral position alone or with position changes (cecum to hepatic flexure, left lateral; transverse, supine; splenic flexure and descending colon, right lateral) followed by examination in the other position. After both examinations, polyps were removed for histopathology. Luminal distension was measured in each position on a scale of 1–5: 1, total collapse; 5, fully distended.\n\nResults: At least one adenoma was detected in 34% of patients in colonic areas where position change differed from left lateral (transverse, splenic, descending) compared to 23% examined in left lateral alone, p = 0.01. At least one polyp was detected with position changes in 52% versus 34% respectively, p<0.001. Both adenoma and polyp detection were positively correlated with improved distension score, correlation coefficient 0.12, p<0.001. Adenomas were detected in 16% of colonic areas with an adequate distension score (4 and 5) compared to 7% of those with a borderline or non-diagnostic score (1–3), p<0.001.\n\nConclusion: Position changes during colonoscope withdrawal, a cost-neutral intervention, significantly improved adenoma detection between hepatic flexure and sigmoid-descending junction. The effect appears to relate in part to improved luminal distension. This intervention could improve efficacy of colonoscopy in cancer prevention without additional resources.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00234650.\n\nPREDICTING OUTCOMES FOLLOWING GASTROSTOMY INSERTION USING THE SHEFFIELD GASTROSTOMY SCORE. A PROSPECTIVELY DEVISED SCORING SYSTEM WITH A VALIDATION COHORT\n\nJ. S. Leeds1, M. E. McAlindon1, S. R. Morley2, R. Marr2, H. E. Robson1, J. Grant1, F. K. T. Lee3, M. T. Donnelly4, D. S. Sanders1. 1Gastroenterology, 2Clinical Chemistry, 3Radiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, 4Gastroenterology, Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Several scoring systems are used in the field of Gastroenterology. Although previous studies have demonstrated the substantial risk of death following gastrostomy insertion and some risk factors have been identified, no previous investigators have described a scoring system for gastrostomy insertion. We undertook a prospective, unselected, dual centre study in order to establish the relative importance of risk factors for mortality after gastrostomy insertion. We then formulated a simple numerical scoring system to categorise patients’ risk of death. We then sought to validate our scoring system on an independent second cohort of patients.\n\nAims & Methods: All patients referred for gastrostomy are prospectively included in a database along with demographic, biochemical and outcome data. We analysed gastrostomy insertions from two teaching hospitals from February 2004 to February 2007. There were 887 referrals resulting in 837 gastrostomy insertions. The largest cohort was at site A and was used to construct a risk stratification scoring system. Site B was used to validate the scoring system.\n\nResults: Site A received 552 referrals and 403 new gastrostomies were inserted (median age 64, 268 males). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 51/403 (12.7%) with the highest risk in those with dementia (40%) followed by stroke (22.2%). Univariate analysis identified that 30 day mortality was associated with age (OR 3.4), albumin (OR 5.6), cardiac comorbidity (OR 2.0) and neurological comorbidity (OR 1.7). On multivariate analysis only age and albumin remained significant (both p<0.001) and were then modelled and attributed scores with age scoring 0 or 1 and albumin scoring 0, 1 or 2 giving composite scores from 0 to 3. Scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3 gave 30-day mortalities (95% CI) of 0% (0 to 2.1), 7% (2.9 to 13.9), 21.3% (13.5 to 30.9) and 37.3% (24.1 to 51.9) respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by total score showed a significantly increased mortality at 7 (p = 0.0003), 30 (p<0.0001) and 90 (p<0.0001) days. Site B (validation cohort) received 335 referrals and inserted 153 new gastrostomies (median age 77, 64 males) with a 30-day mortality of 24/153 (15.7%). Application of the scoring system in this validation cohort gave comparable 30-day mortality figures of 0%, 7.7%, 15.6% and 29.3% for scores 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nConclusion: The gastrostomy score can be used to categorise patients being considered for gastrostomy insertion and to calculate risk of death at 30 days. Further external validation is required.\n\nNATURAL ORIFICE TRANSLUMINAL ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY (NOTES) VERSUS LAPAROSCOPY FOR COLON PERFORATION AND REPAIR: FEASIBILITY AND RISK OF ADHESIONS\n\nJ. Morris, J. Romagnuolo, K. Morgan, S. Palesch, R. Hawes. Digestive Disease Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA\n\nIntroduction: Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has evolved as a novel endoscopic approach to surgery with the potential to offer scarless procedures and minimise adhesion formation. Postoperative adhesions are an important cause of morbidity in the USA each year. Case reports suggest that NOTES procedures are feasible but little is known of the pathophysiological response to transluminal procedures.\n\nAims & Methods: To determine if colon perforation repair is feasible with NOTES and to assess adhesion severity with NOTES transgastric colon perforation repair (TGCR) compared with laparoscopic colon repair (LCR) 40 25 kg male pigs were randomly assigned to either TGCR or LCR. TGCR involved a trangastric needleknife puncture with a double channel therapeutic endoscope, peritoneal cavity entry after balloon dilatation, pneumoperitoneum with CO2 and performance of a 2 cm perforation of the spiral colon with a needleknife, and repair of the perforation with clips. The gastric perforation was then closed with a detachable snare and clips using a purse string technique. Pigs were given colon prep preoperatively and antibiotics during the procedure followed by standard chow the next day. Necropsy was performed at 21 days. Adhesion score was a 9 point composite score of (a) density and vascularity of adhesions (1 = filmy, avascular, 2 = dense or vascular, or 3 = dense and vascular) (b) breadth of adhesions (0 = <4 cm, 3 = >4 cm) and (c) extent of adhesions (1 = 1×2 organ pairs, 2 = 2×2 organ pairs, 3 = 3 or more 2 organ pairs). Final score was a mean of the necropsy surgeon and 2 independent reviewers of necropsy video. Mann-Whitney and Fisher’s exact test were used.\n\nResults: Preliminary composite adhesion scores were analysed for 13 TGCR and 14 LCR pigs. Mean scores were 4.8 (TGCR) and 4.5 (LCR) p = 0.7. Subscores were similar. No pigs had significant procedure-related adverse events. Weight gain and postoperative behaviour were normal in both groups. All colon perforation sites were well healed.\n\nConclusion: NOTES colonic perforation repair is feasible. Preliminary data show similar adhesion score with TGCR compared with LCR.\n\nService development free papers\n\nPROVIDING A REGIONAL SMALL BOWEL ENDOSCOPIC SERVICE: THE SHEFFIELD EXPERIENCE\n\nR. Sidhu1, M. E. McAlindon1, D. P. Hurlstone1, M. Thomson2, I. C. Cameron3, D. S. Sanders1. 1Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, 2Department of Gastroenterology, Sheffield Children’s Hospital, 3Department of Surgery, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: The small bowel is an important area for diagnosis, but endoscopic access has historically been limited. Our centre provides push enteroscopy (PE), capsule endoscopy (CE) and double balloon enteroscopy (DBE). However the clinical utility and impact of these modalities on service provision (in the UK) is unknown.\n\nAims & Methods: To evaluate the diagnostic rates of PE, CE and DBE as well as the impact on patient management, in a tertiary setting in the UK. Data were collected on patients that underwent PE (since January 2002), CE (since June 2002) and DBE (since July 2006). Case notes were reviewed for age, sex, indication of referral, comorbidity, previous investigations and diagnosis obtained including follow-up data. The initial choice of investigation performed depended on the referral indication and the suspected anatomical location of the pathology. The demand for each modality was also assessed since the inception of the service.\n\nResults: Eight hundred CEs, 182 PEs and 30 DBEs have been performed over 70 months. Forty per cent of the referrals originated from outside the region. The commonest indication for all three procedures was obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGB). Patients underwent a mean of 4.3 tests prior to CE or DBE. The overall diagnostic yield was 39% for CE, 33% for PE and 43% for DBE respectively. The diagnostic yield was highest for the indication of overt bleeding for both PE (p<0.01) and CE (p<0.001) when compared to other referral indications. Management was altered in 26% of patients that underwent CE, 22% for PE and 43% for DBE respectively. Importantly there were no cases where PE or DBE recognised a lesion that had not already been detected at CE. When comparing CE and DBE, complete small bowel examination was more likely with CE; p<0.001, however, there was no significant difference in the diagnostic yields of the two groups (p = 0.41). DBE allowed intervention in 38% of patients who had a lesion identified by CE. Referrals for either a therapeutic DBE or PE have occurred in 11% of all CE undertaken. There has been a year by year increase in demand for CE. The increasing demand for CE has resulted in a relative decline in the number of diagnostic PEs performed while the demand for DBE is rising particularly for lesions considered beyond the reach of PE.\n\nConclusion: As part of the regional service, CE should be used as a first-line investigation for the small bowel. PE and DBE should be used as an adjuvant to CE for therapeutic intervention, depending on the location of pathology seen at CE. This ensures efficient use of the small bowel service.\n\nTRANSFUSION IN ACUTE UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING: PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE UK COMPARATIVE AUDIT\n\nS. A. Hearnshaw1, D. Lowe2, R. F. Logan3, S. P. L. Travis1, K. R. Palmer4, M. F. Murphy5. 1Gastroenterology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, 2CEEU, Royal College of Physicians, London, 3Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, 4Gastroenterology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, 5NHS Blood and Transplant, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK\n\nIntroduction: More than 60% of red blood cells (RBC) are now transfused to medical patients. Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) are one of the main groups of medical patients using blood (∼14% of all RBC transfusions).1 However, there are no large randomised controlled trials showing transfusion in AUGIB improves outcome. Every transfusion carries risk, and inappropriate transfusion is also a waste of a scarce and costly resource. The BSG guidelines recommend transfusion in patients with a haemoglobin (Hb) <10 g/dl with acute bleeding, or ongoing haematemesis with shock.2 UK transfusion guidelines exist for the use of RBC, platelets and FFP in bleeding patients.3–5 This comparative audit of AUBIG provides the opportunity to review current practice in these patients where transfusion is common. The audit data will be provided to each participating hospital with recommendations for avoidance of inappropriate transfusion.\n\nAims & Methods: To audit current transfusion practice in AUGIB against published guidelines, and to investigate the relationships between transfusion and patient outcomes including re-bleeding and death. All UK acute NHS hospitals were invited to participate. Enrolled hospitals identified all new admissions and inpatients presenting with suspected AUGIB between 1/5/07 and 30/6/07. Endoscopy, laboratory and transfusion data were entered online.\n\nResults: Data were received from 6750 patients from 208 UK hospitals treating patients with AUGIB. 43% received RBC transfusion for AUGIB. 10% of all initial transfusions were to haemodynamically stable patients with Hb>10 g/dl, and 5% were given to stable patients with no recorded Hb. FFP was transfused to 503 (7%) patients, 29% of whom had normal coagulation studies. 189 patients received a platelet transfusion, 39% being given to patients with a platelet count >50 ×10*9/l. 23% of patients who received RBC transfusion had ongoing or further bleeding following transfusion. For all Rockall scores, the rate of re-bleeding was lower in patients who did not receive RBC transfusion.\n\nConclusion: RBC transfusion remains common in patients with AUGIB, with the majority of RBC transfusions being given according to published guidelines. 15% did not appear to be justified. Inappropriate transfusion of platelets and FFP was higher.\n\n30-DAY MORTALITY AUDIT USING A LATE QUALITY AND SAFETY OUTCOME IT SYSTEM\n\nS. Hebbar, E. Nowell, K. Dowler, R. Valori, P. Dunckley. Gastroenterology, Gloucester Royal Hospital, Gloucester, UK\n\nIntroduction: Following an endoscopic procedure, the capture of immediate outcomes is relatively easy compared to that of late outcomes. Locally, we have set up an automated late quality and safety outcome IT system to identify patients who have died within 30 days of an endoscopic procedure, thus facilitating the systematic audit of these procedures and their appropriateness.\n\nAims & Methods: The aim of the audit was to identify the number of cases assigned to the clinical governance review, the number of days from the endoscopic procedure to death and the percentage of deaths in community. The average time to review each case note was also identified. The late quality and safety outcome IT system obtains 30-day mortality data by linking the PAS and Patient Administration System’s (PAS) theatre module, SwiftOp. An endoscopist was assigned to review the notes who, on signing into the system, can open a data entry screen for each case which displays full details of the endoscopic procedures, into which the outcomes and comments from the notes review are entered. Date of procedure and death and any adverse events are also displayed in the system. Cases where it was determined that the procedure was inappropriate or contributed to death, or where the reviewer was unsure about either of these, were assigned to a clinical governance review.\n\nResults: Between January 2006 and October 2007, 17 744 endoscopic procedures were performed and 341 patients died within 30 days. 138 notes have been reviewed to date. The average time to review each notes was 3 min. The average number of days to death from the time of endoscopic procedure was 14.53. 25 patients (18.1%) died in the community. Nine (0.05% of total endoscopic procedures) cases are assigned to clinical governance review, of which 7 cases possibly and 2 (0.01% of total endoscopic procedures) cases definitely contributed to death. The deaths in all the 9 cases have been within 8 days of procedure and all died within the hospital.\n\nConclusion: The late quality and safety outcome IT system is user-friendly and quick. The audit has identified 2 cases whereby the endoscopy directly led to patient death. These cases will be reviewed as part of the endoscopic clinical governance framework in order to further enhance the quality and safety of our endoscopic practice. The 9 cases where the endoscopic procedure possibly or definitely contributed towards death all died within 8 days of the procedure and within the hospital. Although this is only a small number of cases, these initial data suggest that reducing the late outcome mortality audit data from 30 to 10 days, in patients who have died in hospital only, may still capture the majority of late deaths and reduce the workload associated with collecting this data.\n\nCAN WE ACHIEVE THE 18 WEEK PATHWAY TARGET? EFFECT OF DIFFERING PATIENT PRESENTATIONS\n\nP. Sakellariou, D. A. Elphick, G. Toy, D. S. Sanders, D. P. Hurlstone, M. E. McAlindon, A. J. Lobo. Gastroenterology Unit, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Investigation of out-patients with a wide range of presenting features is a major part of a gastroenterologist’s workload. Few data exist on the extent to which different units investigate similar presentations. This is of critical importance in provision of an 18 week (126 day; from referral to initiation of treatment) patient pathway—a key objective for the NHS.\n\nAims & Methods: This study aimed to quantify the investigative load of newly referred patients to the Gastroenterology clinic of a single University Teaching Hospital and to evaluate performance against the local Trust’s 18 week “clock rules”. 306 new out-patients were reviewed by 4 consultant teams over a 62-day period (16/08/06–16/10/06). All case notes were reviewed. Referral category, main and additional symptoms, time to first appointment and outcome at 18 weeks were recorded. Time and reason for stopping the clock were identified.\n\nResults: Median age (range) was 56 (18–94) years and 61% were female. Referrals were from GPs (240, 78%) or another consultant (66, 22%). 77 (25%) referrals were through the “suspected cancer” system. Median time to first appointment was 56 (1–192) days. The commonest main symptoms were diarrhoea (74, 24%), dyspepsia (43, 14%), iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (53, 17%). At 18 weeks the clock had been stopped in 164 (54%) patients while 60 (19%) were undergoing further investigation, 53 (16.7%) awaiting treatment to be agreed, 22 (8%) awaiting first appointment, 6 (2%) referred to another specialty and 1 (0.3%) had a new clock started. The clock had been stopped for 268 (87%) patients with a median time 111 (7–499) days (68 (25%) offered treatment; 112 (43%) decision not to treat; 20 (7%) declined treatment or investigation; 68 (25%) commenced active monitoring). With administrative changes, the pathway could have been accelerated to stop the clock at median 77 (7–499) days compared to actual time (p<0.01, Wilcoxon test). Median time to stopping the clock was 41 (11–249) days for the “suspected cancer” pathway, and 130 (7–499) days for the remainder. Those with diarrhoea had median 2 (1–6) further investigations (dyspepsia 2 (0–5); IDA 3 (0–5)). Median time to stopping the clock for patients with diarrhoea was 120 (13–491) days (dyspepsia 78(7–499); IDA 103 (12–494)) and proportion of patients with completed investigation by 18 weeks was 42% (diarrhoea), 70% (dyspepsia) and 47% (IDA).\n\nConclusion: The investigative practice of one hospital unit is described allowing comparison with others and benchmarks to be set. To achieve the March 2008 milestone with 90% of patients having received initial treatment by 18 weeks from referral, our audit highlights the requirement for a transformation of services and for the complexity of investigative pathways to be considered in delivering that objective.\n\nUSING THE 13C-UBT TO PROMOTE NICE GUIDELINES FOR SIMPLE DYSPEPSIA: AN 8-YEAR FOLLOW-UP COHORT STUDY\n\nA. J. Norman, S. Din, N. J. Taylor, S. Swain, R. P. H. Logan. Department of Gastroenterology, King’s Mill Hospital, Mansfield, UK\n\nIntroduction: The 2004 NICE guidelines advise that in patients with dyspepsia, gastroscopy (OGD) should be reserved for patients with alarm symptoms. However there is continued demand for OGD, often as a means of providing reassurance. This study evaluates the long-term effectiveness and safety of an alternative management pathway in minimising the use of OGD in patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia.\n\nAims & Methods: Observational cohort study of patients 65 years old and under with uncomplicated dyspepsia routinely referred to a district general hospital between 11/08/98 and 1/11/03 with follow-up to 1/11/07. Hospital activity and pathology database analysis for death, cancer diagnosis, OGD (out-patient and in-patient) and case note review. Ascertainment bias (for OGDs performed elsewhere) was evaluated by review of GP records in a subset of referred patients (n = 30). The two-step pathway was a 13C-UBT and a subsequent 20 min out-patient consultation in all patients with a negative result.\n\nResults: Between 11/08/1998 and 28/10/2003, 242 patients (median age 41 years, range 14–65 years, 130 male, 112 female) with uncomplicated dyspepsia were referred, had a negative 13C-UBT and were reviewed as an out-patient. The clinical diagnoses were GORD (74%) and non-ulcer dyspepsia (14%). During the period of follow-up (median 78 months, range 45 to 111 months), 39 patients had an OGD either within one year (n = 15; indication for OGD: severe/atypical symptoms (n = 7), pre-fundoplication (n = 4)) or subsequently (n = 24, 24/227 (11%), median follow-up 33 months, range 14–92 months). In the latter group, a normal OGD was the most common endoscopic diagnosis (n = 20) followed by oesophagitis (n = 6). During a total follow-up of 1593 patient years, there were 3 deaths (lung cancer and LVF. One patient’s cause of death could not be found). From a subset of GP records (n = 30), only one patient had an OGD performed elsewhere.\n\nConclusion: These data show that uncomplicated dyspepsia can be safely managed without performing OGD in up to 90% of cases referred to secondary care. The alternative pathway exploits the reassurance value of a negative 13C-UBT reinforced by out-patient clinic review. This strategy may allow endoscopy resources to be used more appropriately.\n\nA TEMPLATE PROFORMA AND OPERATIVE INFORMATION IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORTING IN COLORECTAL CANCER\n\nP. N. Siriwardana1, A. Pathmeswaran2, J. S. D. E. Hewavisenthi3, K. I. Deen1. 1University Surgical Unit, North Colombo Teaching Hospital, 2Department of Community Medicine, 3Department of pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, Sri Lanka\n\nIntroduction: The histopathology report is vital to determine the need for adjuvant therapy and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC).1 We and others have highlighted the inadequacy of histopathology reports in paragraph prose.2 3 To improve the completeness and quality of histopathology reports, the Royal College of Pathologists (RCP), UK has formulated a proforma to include a minimum dataset required for accurate assessment of a colorectal cancer specimen.4\n\nAims & Methods: The aim of this prospective study is to assess the robustness of the histopathology report following introduction of a template proforma based on RCP, UK guidelines, which had 19 items for rectal cancer (RC) and 15 items for colon cancer (CC). A total of 150 reports were evaluated; 68 consecutive histopathology reports in proforma format were prospectively analysed and compared with 82 consecutive histopathology reports in text format. The percentage of reports containing a statement for each data item in the dataset in template proforma format was obtained and compared with the series in paragraph format. Completeness (%) of each report classified <80% or >80%.\n\nResults: Eleven data items common to CC and RC had a comment in all proformas compared to only 2 in text format reports. The completeness of reports in text and template format is shown in table 1. Except for comments on presence of “histologically confirmed liver metastases” in CC and RC, “distance from dentate line” (information provided by surgeon) and “distance to circumferential margin” in RC, all other items were reported in more than 90%, where 71% of the items based on the minimum dataset were present in all. Mean percentage completeness of all reports in template format for RC was 91% (SD±4%) and 99% (SD±1%) for CC, whilst a text report had completion rates of 74% (SD±8%) and 81% (SD±5%) respectively.\n\nConclusion: A checklist of report items improves the quality of the histopathology report in CRC which can be further enhanced by the surgeon’s contribution of operative findings.\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE UK COMPARATIVE AUDIT OF ACUTE UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING: ORGANISATION OF CARE\n\nS. A. Hearnshaw1, D. Lowe2, R. F. Logan3, M. F. Murphy4, S. P. L. Travis1, K. R. Palmer5. 1Gastroenterology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, 2CEEU, Royal College of Physicians, London, 3Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, 4NHS Blood and Transplant, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, 5Gastroenterology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK\n\nIntroduction: Prompt assessment, investigation, resuscitation (including appropriate transfusion), and endoscopic therapy are required to manage optimally patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB). BSG guidelines state that patients with major bleeding should undergo urgent endoscopy, and that therapeutic endoscopy should be provided by skilled endoscopists 24/7.1 2 A dedicated space on routine endoscopy lists should be provided daily for patients presenting with AUGIB.3\n\nAims & Methods: To survey the current organisation of care for patients admitted with AUGIB against published guidelines. To examine the availability of emergency endoscopy, endoscopic therapies, and skilled medical and nursing staff in hospitals admitting patients with AUGIB. Organisational questionnaires were sent to the clinical lead for endoscopy in the 217 hospitals that participated in the audit.\n\nResults: 190 hospitals provided organisational data. 91% provide level 2 care beds on site, with 15 hospitals having a dedicated AUGIB unit. 99% provide endoscopy on site, and 89% have out of hours endoscopy. 99% have facilities for endoscopic therapy in patients with AUGIB, with 57% ensuring a dedicated slot for emergency endoscopy. Only 55% of hospitals have a consultant on call rota for out of hours emergency endoscopy; 75% of these have 3–8 consultants on the rota. 41% of hospitals have an endoscopy nurse assistance on-call rota. In 14% of sites, out of hours emergency endoscopy is provided by unsupervised junior doctors. 5% of hospitals treating patients with AUGIB do not have a transfusion laboratory on site. 82% of hospitals have written guidelines for the management of AUGIB in the hospital, and 85% audit their practice.\n\nConclusion: There is wide variation in service provision for patients with AUGIB in the UK, with many hospitals not having a named consultant on call for endoscopy out of hours. The use of out of hours emergency endoscopy and its appropriateness needs to be reviewed both at national and local levels, and will be evaluated in this audit. The impact of the current service provision on patient outcomes needs to be assessed, before recommendations of “best practice” can be made.\n\n“STRAIGHT TO TEST” UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER SERVICE: EFFICIENCY, SAFETY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS\n\nR. Madhotra1, P. Steer2, A. Ignjatovic2, C. Akubuine2. 1Gastroenterology, Milton Keynes Hospital Foundation Trust, Milton Keynes, 2Gastroenterology, Milton Keynes General Hospital, Milton Keynes, UK\n\nIntroduction: Rapid access to diagnosticvs is essential for early diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. In the UK, Cancer Plan 2000 requires all suspected cancer patients to be seen in two weeks and diagnostics must be completed within 31 days. These targets put huge service delivery challenges for most NHS hospitals with limited resources. We, therefore, started a “Straight to Test” STT service to reduce access times, and rapid diagnosis and staging suspected cancer patients. There were no extra cost for setting up the service. The patients were followed up for 6 months after endoscopy by telephonic interview and/or review of medical records.\n\nAims & Methods: We conducted a prospective audit of the new STT service over the first 12 months to study the efficiency, safety and cost effectiveness. All consecutive patients referred by the GPs for urgent cancer assessment were studied. Data were collected to include the demographics, presenting symptoms, endoscopy findings, follow-up plan and 6-month outcome. Cost savings were calculated using Outpatient Mandatory Tariff Coding system.\n\nResults: A total of 241 patients (116 males, 125 females) were studied. Ninety five per cent patients had endoscopy within two weeks of referral. Majority had multiple symptoms. the commonest presenting symptoms were dyspepsia (68%), dysphagia (48%) and weight loss (40%). The endoscopy diagnoses were gastritis (32%), hiatus hernia (26.9%), oesophagitis (16.8%), duodenitis (12%) and gastric ulcers (2.4%). Cancers were detected in 27 (11.2%) patients. Cancers included 11 oesophageal, 4 gastric, 3 pancreas, 2 liver and 3 colon. One hundred and seven (44.3%) patients were discharged back to the GP after endoscopy, 134 (55.7%) were followed up in hospital. Excluding cancer patients there were no significant difference in presenting symptoms, endoscopy findings and clinical outcomes at 6 months in the two groups. No missed cancers were detected at 6-month follow-up. STT service saved 107 new patient appointments (£188 each) and reduced 134 follow-up appointments (£88 each) for the remaining. The net saving was £32,576.\n\nConclusion: Our audit shows that STT service for upper GI cancer assessment is efficient, safe and highly cost effective. The audit also shows that more patients could be safely discharged to their GPs, hence there is scope more cost saving. This model of cancer assessment service in the NHS has potential for widespread use in upper GI as well as other cancers.\n\nLIVER HISTOPATHOLOGY IN THE YORKSHIRE REGION: A NETWORK MODEL\n\nJ. I. Wyatt1, G. Reall1, R. Jones2. 1Histopathology Department, 2Hepatology, St James’s University Hospital, Leeds, UK\n\nIntroduction: The national plan for liver services UK 2004 envisages that “each hepatology centre should have access to a specialised liver pathologist. Ideally this would be in the site of the lead centre providing expertise and training for the local pathology departments within the managed clinical network.”1 This arrangement has evolved informally in West and North Yorkshire.\n\nAims & Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the volume and provision of liver histopathology in our region originating outside Leeds, as a potential model for a hepatopathology network. A questionnaire was sent to all pathologists in west and north Yorkshire, covering 11 hospital trusts, referring into the main centre at Leeds. It covered departmental statistical data on liver biopsy workload, and attitudes of individual pathologists to reporting liver biopsies. Individual attitudinal responses to statements were on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree), 3 (neutral), to 5 (strongly agree).\n\nResults: Replies were received from all 11 hospitals: 23/31 (74%) pathologists in non-specialised DGH departments and 3/4 liver pathologists in larger specialised departments (Bradford, Hull). The DGH departments receive on average 70 biopsies/year (range 30–150; 67% medical, 33% for tumour) representing 0.55% (0.33–1.1%) histology requests. Reporting is shared by all 2–6 pathologists/department. On average estimated 35% (5–100%) cases are discussed with the clinician during a CPC (5/9) and/or by phone (5/9). About 10% biopsies are reviewed in Leeds. The two larger departments receive 120 and 170 biopsies/year reported by 2 named subspecialist pathologists out of the 10–11 consultants/department. <5% biopsies are reviewed in Leeds. Of 23 DGH pathologists expressing a view (>16 not neutral for each question), >90% enjoyed liver work, often read up about biopsies, and discussed them with their colleagues. 94% said they would like to do liver CPD, 62% had done liver CPD in the last 3 years. 7/23 would like to refer more biopsies centrally. Only one said they would prefer not to do any liver work.\n\nConclusion: In Yorkshire, liver biopsies account for 0.5% DGH histopathology specimens. Most pathologists enjoy the challenge of this work, and would like more opportunity for CPD. A minority would like a more centralised service. This indicates support for a more formalised network, providing support, training and guidelines to pathologists to work with their local clinical hepatologist.\n\nA DECADE AFTER ROCKALL: A 12-MONTH SINGLE-CENTRE STUDY OF CLINICAL OUTCOME IN NON-VARICEAL UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED\n\nR. Arulraj1, I. Khan1, S. Pathmakanthan1, K. Kane1, R. Boulton1, M. Hallissey2, J. Goh1. 1GI Unit, 2Surgery, University hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK\n\nIntroduction: A decade following the publication of the Rockall risk score have seen significant medical and endoscopic advances in treatment of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (NVGIB) and also a change in the epidemiological pattern of NVGIB. Many gastroenterologists feel there has been a progressive fall in the incidence of bleeding and endoscopic therapy is useful in control of bleeding.\n\nAims & Methods: We report a 12-month (2006) study of clinical outcome of patients presenting to the emergency department in a single centre with a 24/7 consultant-led GI bleed service. All patients admitted with acute NVGIB were included (GI bleed in our tertiary services including transplant units were excluded). Case/electronic record of all patients were reviewed and discussed at weekly bleed audit meeting.\n\nResults: 202 patients were identified as true NVGIB (mean age 67±18; M:F = 125:77). Medication: Aspirin (n = 54), Clopidogrel (2), NSAID (22) and Warfarin (15). Endoscopy was performed within 24 h in 90 (45%; mean Rockall: pre 2.9 post 4.6); 24–48 h in 46 (23%; mean Rockall pre 2.3 post 3.7) and >48 h in 59 (29%; mean Rockall pre 2.3 post 3.5). 23 (11%) were performed out-of-hours (Rockall pre 3.2; post 5.8). The top 4 diagnoses were duodenal ulcer (56; 28%), gastric ulcer (32; 16%), oesophagitis (32; 16%) and gastritis (32; 16%). In total, 15 (7%) underwent emergency surgery. The overall mortality was 9% (18/202). Endoscopic interventions were carried out in 35 (18%; Rockall pre 3.4 post 6.1). Mortality in the intervention and non-intervention groups were 5.7% (2/35) versus 8.9% (15/169) respectively (p = NS; χ2 test).\n\nConclusion: NVGIB remains a significant workload for gastroenterologists both in and out of hours and is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The Rockall score continues to be useful in risk stratification despite the shift in epidemiological pattern from Helicobacter to increasing anti-platelet therapy usage.\n\nBSG pancreatic/radiology section joint symposium\n\nA COMPARISON OF CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY WITH SMALL BOWEL MRI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PEUTZ-JEGHER’S SYNDROME\n\nA. J. Postgate1, A. Fitzpatrick1, D. Burling2, A. Gupta2, C. Fraser1. 1Wolfson Unit for Endoscopy, 2Intestinal Imaging Department, St Mark’s Hospital, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Capsule endoscopy (CE) is more accurate and better tolerated than barium follow through x ray for small bowel polyp surveillance in patients with Peutz-Jegher’s Syndrome (PJS).1 2 However polyp size estimation and localisation is difficult at CE. Small bowel MRI is an evolving modality which may have a role for this indication.\n\nAims & Methods: We compared the accuracy of CE with MRI follow through for the detection of significant (>10 mm) small bowel polyps in adults with PJS. Study patients underwent an MRI and a subsequent CE. Each test was reported by different reviewers, blinded to the results of the other modality. A visual-analogue scale documenting patient comfort was completed. The results were confirmed at double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) or operative enteroscopy (IOE) when clinically appropriate.\n\nResults: An interim analysis of 9 patients was performed. 705 polyps of all sizes were identified by both modalities: 681 by CE and 24 by MRI (table). CE identified significantly more diminutive polyps (6 mm or less) than MRI (643 vs 2, p = 0.008), and more 6–10 mm polyps (24 vs 8, p = 0.07). Six patients had significant (>10 mm) polyps: 5 were identified at MRI and CE, and 1 at MRI only. Each modality identified 14 significant polyps. To date confirmation of the results by DBE has been performed in 1 patient (no 1, table 1), at which 3 significant polyps were noted: two 12 mm polyps in the jejunum, and one 22 mm polyp in the proximal ileum. CE identified a 15 mm and 20 mm polyp in the jejunum and two 12 mm polyps in the ileum, while MRI found a 16 mm polyp in the jejunum and a 13 mm polyp in the ileum. Patients found CE more comfortable than MRI (78% vs 52%) but of equal convenience (77% vs 77%). Patient preference was split between the two tests.\n\nConclusion: CE is superior for identifying small (10 mm or less) polyps but MRI is comparable in performance for clinically significant (>10 mm) polyps. Further data from DBE or IOE are required to examine which modality most accurately localises and sizes significant polyps. Although patients rate CE as more comfortable than MRI, neither test was preferable overall. In conclusion, MRI follow through is a promising alternative to CE for small bowel polyp surveillance, and it is likely that the two modalities will complement each other in the management of difficult cases prior to organising invasive polypectomy.\n\nNeurogastroenterology/motility free papers\n\nSYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM CO-ACTIVATION UNDERLIES HEART RATE INCREASE IN BOTH HUMAN VISCERAL AND SOMATIC PAIN\n\nP. Paine1, J. Kishor2, L. Gregory1, Q. Aziz2. 1Department of Gastroenterology and Translational Imaging Unit, Manchester University, Manchester, 2Wingate Institute of Neurogastroenterology, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Somatic pain animal models have recently identified novel, seemingly paradoxical, sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) co-activation in pain evoked heart rate (HR) increase. It is not known whether this can be seen in humans or for visceral pain.\n\nAims & Methods: To compare brainstem selective autonomic nuclei outputs for visceral and somatic pain. Methods: 18 healthy volunteers (2 males), mean age 35.4 (range 18–59 years) underwent serial nail bed (NB) pressure stimuli; 16 of whom also had serial oesophageal balloon (O) distension. Both stimuli were delivered to pain tolerance threshold. In addition to HR, selective cardiac PNS (cardiac vagal tone (CVT)) and SNS responses including cardiomotor (Cardiac Sympathetic Index (CSI)); sudomotor (skin conductance (SCR)) and vasomotor (mean blood pressure (MBP)) were acquired pre- and post-stimulation using a novel beat to beat technique.\n\nResults: There were comparable ratings between sites of pain intensity (O = 7.9 + 0.2, NB = 8.1 + 0.2; p>0.05) and unpleasantness (O = 7.9 + 0.2; NB = 7.8 + 0.3; p>0.05). HR increased during both somatic (71.02 + 2.1 bpm pre-stimulus; 73.9 + 2.05 post-stimulus, p<0.05) and visceral pain (72.3 + 2.05 bpm pre-stimulus, 76.9 + 2 bpm post-stimulus, p<0.05). This was accompanied by CVT increases for both somatic (pre-stimulus 8.11 + 1.06, post-stim 8.50 + 1.12, p<0.05) and visceral pain (pre-stimulus 8.15 + 1.4, post-stimulus 8.84 + 1.32, p<0.05). CSI also increased for visceral (pre-stimulus 2.38 + 0.19; post-stimulus 3.33 + 0.31, p<0.05); p<0.01) and somatic (pre-stimulus 2.36 + 0.15, post-stimulus 2.91 + 0.26) pain. SCR increased for somatic (pre-stim 6.86 + 0.97 uS, post-stim 8.35 + 1.05, p<0.05) and visceral (pre-stimulus 6.25 uS + 0.96, post-stimulus 7.32 uS+1.08, p<0.05) pain. MBP fell however: somatic (pre-stim 99.1 + 2.5 mmHg, post-stim 95.5 + 2.24, p<0.05) visceral (pres-stim 95.8 + 3.5 mmHg post-stim 91.2 + 4.3, p<0.05). The pain related change was greater for SCR for NB than O (p<0.05) but there were no differences otherwise in magnitude of pain-related changes between sites.\n\nConclusion: For the first time, co-activation of SNS and PNS has been shown to accompany pain evoked HR increases in humans for somatic and visceral pain. This confirms recent similar findings in animal studies. The ANS is not a simple reciprocal system but its subcomponents are capable of nuanced patterned responses in pain. Visceral and somatic pain responses were qualitatively similar.\n\nANXIETY INDUCTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER SENSITISATION TO OESOPHAGEAL ACID IN A HUMAN MODEL OF VISCERAL PAIN HYPERSENSITIVITY\n\nA. Sharma1, L. Van Oudenhove2, P. Paine1, Q. Aziz3. 1GI Sciences, Hope Hospital, Salford, UK, 2Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 3Wingate Institute of Neurogastroenterology, Barts and the Royal London, Queen Mary University, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Patients with stress or anxiety at the time of gastrointestinal injury/inflammation (for example, gastroenteritis) have a higher risk of developing subsequent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Patients with these disorders often display a heightened sensitivity to experimental gut stimulation, termed visceral pain hypersensitivity (VPH). We have previously shown that distal oesophageal acidification induces sensitisation of spinal dorsal horn neurones leading to the development of VPH in the non-acid exposed proximal oesophagus (PO).1 How anxiety modulates this VPH is unknown.\n\nAims & Methods: To determine whether anxiety induction affects the magnitude of acid-induced oesophageal pain hypersensitivity. 16 healthy volunteers (10 female, age 22–57 years, mean 35.7 years), were studied on two occasions. Pain thresholds (PT) to electrical stimulation (in milliamperes, mA) were determined in the PO and foot (somatic control) pre- and post a 30-min infusion of 0.15M HCl. During the infusion, all subjects randomly received a 10 min cognitive mood induction paradigm combining autobiographical recall of an anxiety-inducing life event with presentation of fearful faces or a neutral life event with neutral faces in a cross-over design. A Spielberger state anxiety inventory (SSAI) was recorded before and after the acid infusion. Subjects also completed unpleasantness ratings on a 10 cm Likert scale before, during and after the infusion.\n\nResults: The mean change in SSAI score with infusion was significantly greater for anxiety versus neutral conditions (21.7 (12.6 SD) vs 3.6 (6.4 SD), p<0.0001 Wilcoxon). Anxiety induction increased unpleasantness scores compared to neutral (2.5 (2.0 SD) vs 0.63 (1.2 SD), p = 0.008 Wilcoxon). There was a greater reduction in PT in the PO during anxiety compared to neutral condition (−4.5 mA (6.4 SD) vs −2.1 mA (6.2 SD), p = 0.05 Wilcoxon). The mean maximum change in PT was also greater with anxiety than neutral mood induction (−7.6 mA (6.7SD) vs −3.8 mA (5.8SD), p = 0.02 Wilcoxon). There was no difference in the mean change in foot PT between the conditions (p = 0.14, Wilcoxon).\n\nConclusion: Combining anxiogenic autobiographical recall with fearful faces increases subjective anxiety, and unpleasantness scores during oesophageal acidification and the magnitude of subsequent visceral sensitisation. These findings provide objective evidence for the role of anxiety in the development of prolonged VPH, and provides a model for studying the biological reasons for the effect observed and will also allow testing of therapeutic strategies.\n\nFAECAL LACTOFERRIN: A NOVEL TEST TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN IRRITABLE OR INFLAMED BOWEL?\n\nR. Sidhu1, L. Foye2, S. Morley2, P. Wilson2, A. C. Wright1, A. J. Lobo1, M. E. McAlindon1, D. S. Sanders1. 1Department of Gastroenterology, 2Department of Clinical Chemistry, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may not always be discriminated by using symptoms alone. Thus invasive tests may be performed. Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein expressed by activated neutrophils. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of faecal lactoferrin (FEL) in patients with IBD, coeliac disease and infective diarrhoea. It has been proposed as a non invasive test to screen patients with gastrointestinal symptoms for the presence of inflammation. However there is paucity of data on the use of FEL in IBS.\n\nAims & Methods: To investigate the clinical utility of faecal lactoferrin (FEL) as a marker of GI inflammation when assessing patients with Rome II IBS, IBD and healthy controls. Patients with Rome II IBS and IBD were invited to participate in this study. Disease activity in IBD patients were assessed using the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBI). Healthy volunteers acted as controls. Stool samples were analysed using an ELISA assay (Techlab). A two-tailed t test was used to compare means between groups and Kendall-Tau correlation calculations were performed between lactoferrin concentrations and disease activity.\n\nResults: Eighty seven patients with IBS, 55 patients with IBD: 33 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 22 Crohn’s disease (CD) and 98 healthy volunteers were recruited. The mean +/− SE FEL concentration (μg/g faecal weight) was 1.63 +/− 0.44 for IBS patients, 39.3 +/− 16.6 for UC patients, 35.4 +/− 10.7 for CD patients and 2.43 +/− 0.72 for healthy controls. FEL levels were significantly higher in IBD patients compared to IBS patients (p = 0.001) and healthy controls (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in mean FEL concentration between UC and CD patients (p = 0.8) and between IBS and healthy controls (p = 0.34). However, the mean FEL concentrations were significantly higher in active UC patents compared to inactive UC patients (mean FEL: 100 +/− 40.9 vs 4.67 +/−1.2, p = 0.04). This comparison was not significant for Crohn’s patients (p = 0.1). The correlation coefficient between disease activity and FEL concentrations for UC patients were 0.54 (p = 0.0001) and for CD patients was 0.4 (p = 0.02).The sensitivity and specificity of the FEL assay for distinguishing active IBD from IBS/healthy controls were 90.5% and 95.7% respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 70.4% and 98.9%.\n\nConclusion: FEL is an inexpensive and non invasive test that can provide the clinician with a marker to differentiate between IBD and IBS. These preliminary data suggest that FEL could be used as a non-invasive marker for determining whether patients who have IBS should have endoscopic investigations.\n\nREVERSING A VIRTUAL LESION IN HUMAN SWALLOWING MOTOR CORTEX WITH CORTICAL STIMULATION: A MODEL FOR DYSPHAGIA AFTER STROKE?\n\nS. Jefferson1, S. Mistry1, L. Hancock1, J. Rothwell2, S. Hamdy1. 1GI Sciences, University of Manchester, Salford, 2Sobell Department of Neurophysiology, Institute of Neurology, UCL, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: We have previously shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered at 1 Hz to pharyngeal motor cortex can unilaterally suppress cortical excitability (virtual lesion) which can transiently alter swallowing behaviour.1 Here we examine if an excitatory intervention (5 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS)) applied to the contralesional hemisphere can reverse a virtual lesion as a prelude to applying such neurostimulation in the treatment of dysphagia after stroke.\n\nAims & Methods: Healthy volunteers (n = 12, 5 male, mean age 39 years) underwent single pulse bi-hemispheric TMS measurements of cortico-pharyngeal excitability via a swallowed intraluminal catheter, before and for 60 min after 10 min of 1 Hz rTMS delivered to unilateral pharyngeal motor cortex. Five Hz rTMS (250 pulses over 90 seconds) or sham was then applied to the contralesional hemisphere randomised to different sessions, 1 week apart. Post-lesional cortical excitability following active intervention vs. sham was compared using ANOVA.\n\nResults: As expected, sham rTMS had no effect on the suppression of excitability induced by the virtual lesion, with both lesional and contralesional hemispheres decreasing by a maximum of −35% and −16% respectively. By contrast, active 5 Hz rTMS completely abolished the virtual lesion, reversing the direction of excitability both in the lesional and contralesional hemispheres by +35% and +25%, respectively (p = 0.035, fig).\n\nConclusion: Fast rTMS applied to the contralesional hemisphere completely reverses a unilaterally induced virtual lesion in pharyngeal motor cortex. These data support the notion that rTMS might be usefully applied in stroke patients, as a therapeutic intervention for dysphagia.\n\nAUTONOMIC EFFECTS OF OESOPHAGEAL ACIDIFICATION AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN VISCERAL PAIN HYPERSENSITIVITY\n\nA. Sharma1, P. Paine1, Q. Aziz2. 1GI Sciences, Hope Hospital, Salford, 2Wingate Institute of Neurogastroenterology, Barts and the Royal London, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Visceral pain hypersensitivity (VPH) is a common feature of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). We have shown previously that distal oesophageal acidification induces sensitisation of spinal dorsal horn neurones leading to the development of VPH in the non-acid exposed proximal oesophagus (PO).1 Variability exists in the degree to which individuals sensitise but factors that modulate this are unknown. As the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS) have been proposed as pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive respectively we decided to study their influence on sensitisation in our model.\n\nAims & Methods: To determine whether differential autonomic reactivity predicts the degree of VPH to oesophageal acidification. Methods In 25 healthy volunteers, pain thresholds (PT) to electrical stimulation (in milliamperes, mA) were determined in the PO pre- and post a randomised double-blind 30-min distal oesophageal infusion of either 0.15M HCl or saline. All subjects had autonomic monitoring before and during the infusion. Selective PNS (cardiac vagal tone (CVT) and cardiac sensitivity to baroreflex (CSB)) and SNS (cardiac sympathetic index (CSI)) measures were derived.\n\nResults: There was a significant difference between the mean change in PT in the PO between acid (−3.9 mA (5.5 SD)) and saline 2.6 (4.9 SD)) suggesting the development of VPH with acid (p<0.0001 Wilcoxon, n = 25). Of the 25, 16 had a fall in PO PT of ⩾5 mA with acid and thus sensitised. End-infusion heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly higher with acid than saline (73.4 (9.9 SD) vs 67.7 (7.6 SD), p = 0.0001 for HR, paired t test) and (100.4 (13.4 SD) vs 95.0 (13.5 SD), p = 0.0007 for MAP, paired t test). End-infusion CVT and CSB were significantly lower with acid than saline ((p = 0.01, Wilcoxon; CVT) and (p = 0.0038, Wilcoxon; CSB). End-infusion CSI was greater for acid than saline (p = 0.0016, paired t-test). In the 16 sensitisers, the degree of sensitisation was related to increasing heart rate (r = −0.66, 95% CI −0.87 to −0.25, p = 0.005), and fall in CVT (r = 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.82, p = 0.031) and CSB (r = 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.82, p = 0.030). A trend was also apparent that increasing CSI might be associated with increasing sensitisation (r = −0.43, 95% CI −0.76 to 0.08, p = 0.09).\n\nConclusion: Oesophageal acidification is associated with SNS activation and PNS withdrawal. In turn greater PNS withdrawal is associated with greater sensitisation. These data suggest the PNS may have anti-hyperalgesic properties in the human viscera. Future studies using pharmacological modulation of the autonomic nervous system may be beneficial in modulating VPH.\n\nPlenary session\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE UK COMPARATIVE AUDIT OF OVER 6500 PATIENTS WITH ACUTE UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING\n\nS. A. Hearnshaw1, D. Lowe2, R. F. Logan3, M. F. Murphy4, S. P. L. Travis1, K. R. Palmer5. 1Gastroenterology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, 2CEEU, Royal College of Physicians, London, 3Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, 4NHS Blood and Transplant, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, 5Gastroenterology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK\n\nIntroduction: In 1993, Rockall et al reported a large audit of patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) to 4 health regions in England.1 Mortality overall was 14%, with in-patient bleeding mortality 33%. A risk-score developed from this audit (Rockall score) has been shown to predict re-bleeding and death.2 Guidelines recommend early endoscopy for those at high risk.3 Considerable changes have occurred in the presentation and management of AUGIB in the 14 years since Rockall. These include differences in demography, resuscitation, endoscopic therapy and use of specific drugs. At the same time there is concern that inadequacies in service provision may have adversely affected outcomes in some hospitals.\n\nAims & Methods: To audit current care in UK hospitals for managing AUGIB against published recommendations.3 To look at aetiological factors, diagnoses and mortality in AUGIB, and to audit the use of risk stratification and early endoscopic therapy in high risk patients. All UK acute NHS hospitals were invited to participate. Enrolled hospitals identified new admissions and in-patients presenting with suspected AUGIB between 1/5/7 and 30/6/7. Endoscopy, laboratory and transfusion data were entered online.\n\nResults: 6750 patients were included for analysis from 208 hospitals; 82% new admissions and 16% in-patients. 37% of patients were aged <60 yrs and 28% >80 years with mean (SD) age 64.4(19.7) years. 50% had at least one comorbidity, with 9% having documented cirrhosis. 29% were taking aspirin, 12% an NSAID. 26% had a history of alcohol excess. Risk assessment scores were calculated by hospitals for 19% of cases. Scores calculated from submitted data showed 28% had final Rockall score 0–2, 44% score 3–5, 24% score 6–8 and 3% score >8. 50% had endoscopy within 24 h of presentation, including 50% of those with a pre-endoscopy Rockall score of >2. Varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy were found in 12%; peptic ulcer disease was the commonest diagnosis (36%). Endoscopic therapy was undertaken in 19% of non-variceal and 65% of variceal cases. 64% received iv PPI after endoscopic therapy (excluding varices). 2% had surgery for AUGIB. Postoperative mortality was 30%. Unadjusted mortality was 10% overall—7% in new admissions and 26% in in-patients.\n\nConclusion: Despite a population with increasing medical comorbidity and a marked increase in the proportion of patients with varices, the unadjusted mortality of patients with AUGIB has significantly improved in the UK. This could be due to improvements in general health, supportive care, endoscopic haemostasis and acid suppression.\n\nDEFINING THE IMPACT OF ORGAN DYSFUNCTION IN CIRRHOSIS: SURVIVAL AT A COST?\n\nD. L. Shawcross, M. J. Austin, R. D. Abeles, M. McPhail, A. Yeoman, A. J. Portal, W. Bernal, G. Auzinger, E. Sizer, J. A. Wendon. Institute of Liver Studies, King’s College Hospital, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Cirrhosis kills more men than Parkinson’s disease and more women than cervical cancer. The incidence of cirrhosis is increasing exponentially and it is projected that there will be a fivefold increase in demand for liver transplantation in the next 6–10 years. Historically, the perception of cirrhosis with organ dysfunction as having a poor prognosis has fuelled a self-fulfilling prophecy with iniquitous access to intensive care (ICU). However, recent data to support this view is lacking. We report the 7-year experience of the outcome, physiological disturbance and resource utilisation of 658 emergency admissions with cirrhosis and organ dysfunction to a specialist liver ICU at King’s College Hospital.\n\nAims & Methods: We prospectively collected and analysed physiological and biochemical variables on day 1 and 3 of admission. Outcome variables, organ scores (Child Pugh, MELD, SOFA and APACHE II) and number of days requiring vasopressors, ventilation and renal replacement therapy (RRT) were recorded. The Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) score, validated as a tool for estimating cost in ICU, was calculated.\n\nResults: Alcohol was the most common aetiology (47%) and variceal bleeding the most common reason for admission (35%). 51% required inotropes, 72% invasive ventilatory support and 49% RRT during their ICU stay. Despite this, ICU admission for many of these patients with cirrhosis was not futile, with 55% surviving their ICU stay and 41% surviving to discharge. Variceal bleeders had a 30-day survival of 53% versus 33% with a non-variceal indication for admission (p<0.0001). 19% of survivors subsequently underwent liver transplantation. Survival was at a significant cost to the NHS (median cost per patient: £12,403 (4636–27,283) for a median 7-day admission (3–15)). Admissions with multi-organ failure (with and without requirement for RRT) cost significantly more (multi-organ failure p<0.001; RRT p<0.0001) and had more prolonged lengths of stay compared to those that did not (p<0.0001). There was no difference in cost, length of stay or outcome (p = 0.2) between patients with alcoholic liver disease and other aetiologies. RRT was well tolerated and facilitated stability and/or recovery in 23/59 (39%) patients who were subsequently transplanted.\n\nConclusion: More than 50% of patients admitted as emergencies will survive their ICU stay with the majority of these surviving to hospital discharge. These data challenge the widely held prejudice that patients with cirrhosis requiring emergency admission to ICU inevitably die. This endorses the establishment of managed clinical care networks and demands the engagement of all levels of critical care and ward based care models in the treatment of organ dysfunction in cirrhosis.\n\nGastrointestinal physiology associates group\n\nTHE EFFECT OF ARGON PLASMA COAGULATION ABLATION ON OESOPHAGEAL MOTILITY AND CHEMORECEPTOR SENSITIVITY\n\nK. Elghellal, A. Smythe, R. Ackroyd. Surgery, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK\n\nIntroduction: Barrett’s oesophagus is of clinical importance because of the strong association with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The use of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) ablation to eliminate intestinal metaplasia combined with oesophageal acid control has been shown to minimise if not remove the cancer risk.\n\nAims & Methods: Oesophageal motility and sensitivity appear to be disturbed in Barrett’s oesophagus. As ablation treatment is a thermal technique causing superficial damage, the aim of this study therefore was to look at any further effect of APC on both oesophageal motility and mucosal sensitivity. APC was used to treat 20 patients with Barrett’s oesophagus (16 males and 4 females, median age 56 (range 51–81) years) confirmed at endoscopy and histologically, median Barrett’s segment length 4 cm (range 2–10 cm). Station pull through manometry was carried out 1 week before APC treatment. The lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (LOSP), proximal and distal wave amplitude, primary peristalsis with 5 ml water swallows and secondary peristalsis with air and water bolus was measured. To assess oesophageal sensitivity, acid (0.1NHCl) and alkaline (0.1N NaOH ) provocation was carried out. Lag time to initial discomfort (t), sensory intensity rating (i) (no discomfort = 0, intense pain = 20) and acid perfusion sensory score (t × i/100) were obtained. These tests were repeated 4–6 weeks following successful APC.\n\nResults: Using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for statistical evaluation, no significant differences were seen in any of the motility parameters comparing before and after APC. Sensitivity intensity rating and acid perfusion sensory score were significantly higher after APC treatment (pre-APC sensory score for acid = 1.6 (1.8), post-APC sensory score for acid = 0.5 (0.3), p<0.01. Pre-APC sensory score for alkali = 1.5 (1.7), post-APC sensory score for alkali = 0.9 (1.0).\n\nConclusion: Following reversal of Barrett’s epithelium using APC, no changes in oesophageal motility are seen but a decrease in oesophageal sensitivity occurs. Longer term studies are needed to see if sensitivity improves.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE, FRUCTOSE AND TAGATOSE ON GASTRIC EMPTYING\n\nA. McGlone, T. J. Little, D. G. Thompson. Section of GI Sciences, University of Manchester, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK\n\nIntroduction: The mechanisms by which nutrients, in the small intestine, signal to the CNS to alter gastrointestinal function are poorly understood. It has been suggested that sugars slow gastric emptying (GE) (a proxy measure of brainstem activation) by stimulating “osmoreceptors” in the small intestine; however, at a low osmolality, solutions of glucose and fructose appear to empty differently,1 suggesting that the potency of the feedback may also depend on the sugar molecule per se. It is known that the length of intestine exposed to nutrient is important for the regulation of GE. In dogs, slowing of GE by glucose is dependent on exposure of at least 15 cm of the small intestine to nutrient, and the intensity of the feedback increases as the length of exposure is increased.2 Differences in the absorption of hexose sugars may, therefore, be an important determinant of their effects on GE.\n\nAims & Methods: This study therefore aimed to determine whether tagatose, a poorly absorbed hexose sugar (used as a non-caloric sweetener), would slow gastric emptying to a greater extent than glucose or fructose. 12 non-obese subjects (7F, 5M; BMI 23 (0.76) kg/m2) drank 500 ml solutions of 250 mOsmol glucose, fructose or tagatose, and water (non-osmotic control for volume), each labelled with 100 mg of 13C-acetate. Gastric emptying was assessed over 45 min (breath samples collected every 5 min) using a 13C-acetate breath test; the lower the cumulative 13CO2:12CO2, the slower the rate of gastric emptying.\n\nResults: There was a significant effect of hexose type on gastric emptying (p<0.05). The mean cumulative 13CO2:12CO2 values for tagatose were 139.5 (18.2) units lower than those for water, 123.8 (23.4) units lower than those for glucose, and 99.4 (17.5) units lower than those for fructose (p<0.05, for all), whereas there was no difference between glucose, fructose and water. There was, however, substantial interindividual variation in the gastric emptying response, particularly for tagatose and fructose. In general, those individuals who were most able to slow their GE in response to tagatose, had a tendency to slow the GE of fructose.\n\nConclusion: The poorly absorbed hexose sugar, tagatose, slows GE more potently than fructose and glucose, both of which would be expected to be absorbed more completely in the proximal small intestine, thus limiting the length, and duration, of exposure of the small intestine. However, there was substantial phenotypic variation in the gastric emptying responses to hexose sugars. Since the rate of GE closely correlates with ingested meal volume, this observation may have implications for the regulation of food intake.\n\nOesophageal free papers\n\nAN IMPROVED STAGING SYSTEM FOR OESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA BASED ON THE NUMBER OF INVOLVED LYMPH NODES\n\nC.

Oesophageal adenocarcinoma is now the commonest oesophageal malignancy yet is staged using a system originally developed for squamous cell carcinomas. This system does not take into account the number of involved lymph nodes despite increasing evidence this is prognostic. There is a growing consensus in the literature that a new staging system is required.\n\nAims & Methods: The aim of this study was to develop a new staging system for GOJ adenocarcinoma based on the number of involved lymph nodes. A systematic retrospective database was created of 280 patients diagnosed with GOJ adenocarcinoma in whom outcome data were available from 3 UK tertiary referral centres. We collected detailed information on lymph node status and found the association with outcome using SPSS and Prism. We developed a new N-stage using recursive partitioning with the R Statistical package.\n\nResults: T-stage (p<0.0001), current N-stage (p<0.0001), differentiation (p = 0.0002), presence of neurovascular invasion (p<0.0001) and resection margin status (p<0.0001) were all prognostically significant on univariate analysis. Recursive partitioning of nodal positive patients generated the following revised N-stage: N0 = No involved nodes (from present system), N1 = 1–2 involved lymph nodes, N2 = 3–5 involved lymph nodes, and N3 = 6 or greater involved lymph nodes. This new system was highly prognostically significant on univariate analysis (p<0.0001) and outperformed the current N-stage on multiple regression analysis. Furthermore it identified a subgroup of nodal positive patients (N3) with a dismal prognosis (0% 5-year survival), equivalent to that of M1 disease.\n\nConclusion: We have developed a new N-stage for GOJ adenocarcinoma, based on the number of involved lymph nodes, which outperforms the existing system on multiple regression analysis and provides the ability to discriminate between nodal positive patients. We are in the process of validating our findings on an external dataset but this system has the potential to vastly improve our ability to make management decisions. We feel it is time to change the way we stage GOJ adenocarcinoma.\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL INTO THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF ALA VERSUS PHOTOFRIN PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR HIGH GRADE DYSPLASIA IN BARRETT’S OESOPHAGUS\n\nG. D. Mackenzie, J. M. Dunn, M. R. Novelli, S. Mosse, S. M. Thorpe, S. G. Bown, L. B. Lovat. National Medical Laser Centre, University College London, London, UK\n\nIntroduction: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using Photofrin is a licensed minimally invasive treatment for Barrett’s high grade dysplasia (HGD). Photofrin PDT affects the entire oesophageal wall and causes strictures in 18–50% of patients. Patients must also avoid bright light for 3 months to prevent sunburn. 5 aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is preferentially concentrated in the oesophageal mucosa. The risk of stricture is therefore very low. Light sensitivity for ALA lasts for only 36 hours. The aim of current RCT is to determine if PDT for HGD using ALA is safer and more effective than Photofrin.\n\nAims & Methods: Patients with HGD in Barrett’s oesophagus confirmed on at least two occasions by at least two independent pathologists were offered participation in the above RCT. Any visible nodules of HGD were removed and patients only treated if residual HGD was proven to still be present. To ensure length of Barrett’s and extent of HGD were similar in each treatment group patients were stratified for these two factors prior to randomisation. Patients received either Photofrin PDT with the standard licensed protocol or as previously shown to be the most effective 60 mg/kg of ALA activated by 1178 J/cm of red laser light. Follow-up was quadrantic biopsies every 2 cm throughout the treated area of Barrett’s at 6 weeks, 4 months and 1-year post therapy. All side effect data were collected.\n\nResults: Forty patients (out of a planned 66) have so far been recruited and 32 treated; 16 with ALA and 16 with Photofrin. Five patients are undergoing repeat therapy (3 with photofrin and 2 with ALA) and 27 patients are in follow-up. Remission rates are 14/14 (100%) in the ALA group and 9/14 (64%) in the photofrin group (Fisher’s exact test, two-sided p value<0.05). Strictures developed in 6/16 patients treated with Photofrin and 1/16 with ALA, the latter is thought to relate to uncontrolled and significant acid reflux at the time of therapy measured on 24-h pH monitoring (Fisher’s exact test, one-sided p value<0.05). Skin photosensitivity developed in 7/16 patients treated with Photofrin, one of whom was briefly admitted to hospital. There were none with ALA (Fisher’s exact test, one-sided p value<0.05). There are no significant differences to date between groups with respect to other side effects.\n\nConclusion: The preliminary data are encouraging and suggest that ALA PDT is both safer and potentially more effective than Photofrin PDT but follow-up is short and only half the planned number of patients have been treated to date.\n\nNARROW BAND IMAGING WITH MAGNIFICATION IS SUPERIOR TO WHITE LIGHT ENDOSCOPY WITH MAGNIFICATION IN STUDYING THE MUCOSAL MORPHOLOGY IN BARRETT’S OESOPHAGUS\n\nR. Singh1, V. Owen2, H. Karageorgiou1, G. K. Anagnostopoulos1, K. Garsed1, P. Fortun1, E. Fogden1, V. Subramaniam1, A. Shonde1, P. Kaye1, C. J. Hawkey1, K. Ragunath1. 1Wolfson Digestive Diseases Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, 2Trent Research and Development Support Unit, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK\n\nIntroduction: Narrow band imaging with magnification (NBI-Z) can reliably predict histology in Barrett’s oesophagus (BE). Although available in a single unit, the utility of white light endoscopy with magnification (WLE-Z) in BE has not been assessed in prior studies.\n\nAims & Methods: The aim of the study was to see if there is any appreciated difference in imaging characteristics between WLE-Z and NBI-Z in BE and if this translated into clinically relevant benefit in the prediction of histology, specifically looking at dysplasia detection. This was a prospective cohort study involving 21 patients (75 areas with corresponding NBI-Z and WLE-Z images) with BE. Mucosal patterns were evaluated for its image quality on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 1–10 by 5 expert endoscopists specifically looking at the pit pattern and microvascular morphology. The endoscopists then predicted the histology based on four subtypes which can be visualised in BE: Type A: round pits with regular microvasculature (columnar mucosa without intestinal metaplasia); Type B: villous/ridge pits with regular microvasculature (specialised intestinal metaplasia); Type C: absent pits with regular microvasculature (specialised intestinal metaplasia); Type D: distorted pits with irregular microvasculature (high grade dysplasia). The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV) and accuracy (Acc) compared to the final histopathological analysis and the interobserver variability among the 5 assessors were then calculated.\n\nResults: The overall pit quality was significantly higher for NBI-Z compared to WLE-Z (VAS: NBI-Z = 6, WLE-Z = 4.5; z = 11.0, p<0.001). The overall vasculature quality was also significantly better for NBI-Z (VAS: NBI-Z = 7.3, WLE-Z = 4.9, z = 14.1, p<0.001). This translated into a superior prediction of histology in BE with higher Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV and Ac for NBI-Z compared to WLE-Z (table). Looking specifically at the prediction of dysplasia, NBI-Z was superior to WLE-Z (χ2 = 10.3, df = 2, p = 0.006). The overall kappa agreement amongst the 5 endoscopists for NBI-Z and WLE-Z were 0.59 and 0.31 respectively (p<0.001).\n\nConclusion: NBI-Z is superior to WLE-Z in the prediction of histology in BE with good reproducibility. This novel imaging modality could be an important tool for surveillance in patients with BE.\n\nIMPROVING OUTCOME IN PATIENTS WITH OESOPHAGEAL CANCER\n\nA. K. Saha, C. Sutton, S. P. L. Dexter, A. I. Sarela, H. M. Sue-Ling. Academic Division of Surgery, The General Infirmary at Leeds, Leeds, UK\n\nIntroduction: The management of oesophageal cancer has changed significantly over the past 30 years. Improved preoperative and postoperative care, sub-specialisation and increasing use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy have all contributed to improved survival. Our unit has previously reported how these changes had begun to improve overall outcomes1 and suggested that they could be further improved by continuing these changes.\n\nAims & Methods: Using a prospectively maintained database, all patients who underwent oesophageal resection between January 2000 and December 2006 were reviewed. The results were analysed and compared with previously published and presented audits of oesophagectomy from our unit between 1975–88 and 1990–9.\n\nResults: Results are summarised in the table. In-hospital mortality has improved from 27% to 2.9% and 5-year survival has improved from 7% to 52%.\n\nConclusion: These results are encouraging and suggest that the outlook for patients with oesophageal cancer can be greatly improved by earlier diagnosis, greater specialisation and a multi-disciplinary approach to the management of oesophageal cancer.\n\nEOSINOPHILIC OESOPHAGITIS: RARE DISEASE OR A DIAGNOSIS FREQUENTLY MISSED?\n\nV. Kanakala1, C. Lamb2, R. W. Stirling3, S. E. Attwood1. 1General Surgery, 2Gastroenterology, 3Pathology, North Tyneside General Hospital, North Shields, UK\n\nIntroduction: The diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EO) is relatively rare although there has been a dramatic rise in the frequency of case reports and case series over the past 10 years.\n\nAims & Methods: This study aimed to identify the frequency of diagnosis of EO in our community, how the diagnosis was made or suspected and the outcome of specific interventions once the diagnosis was made. The pathology records of gastroscopies performed (62 437) in all the hospitals in Northumberland during years 2001–Oct 2007 were reviewed for patients with a diagnosis of EO (>20 per HPF) on any biopsy sample. The clinical details were obtained from the case notes and hospital electronic database.\n\nResults: Eighteen patients who were diagnosed as having EO were all male with a median age of 46 years (range 17–85 years). There was a median time delay of 2 years between onset of symptoms and diagnosis (range 1–>10 years). Our results show that the endoscopic findings rarely directed the decision to biopsy as most patients had the suspicion of the disease raised beforehand (13/18). In 5 the endoscopic appearances prompted a biopsy not previously planned. 17 patients presented with intermittent dysphagia which is the characteristic symptom of EO. Only two patients had definite response to PPI therapy. In three we felt that treatment was not necessary due to mild symptoms. Treatment outcomes >6 months are available in 13 with good response to oral systemic ste"
