        "text": "On Saturday, February 17, BCCI honoured former India captain Dattajirao Gaekwad, as the Indian players wore a black armband in his memory. Notably, Gaekwad was the oldest living Indian cricketer from 2016 to 2024.\n\nOn February 13, Gaekwad breathed his last at the age of 95. BCCI took to Twitter to reveal that the players would wear the armband on day 3 of the third Test to honour Gaekwad’s legacy. “#TeamIndia will be wearing black armbands in memory of Dattajirao Gaekwad, former India captain and India’s oldest Test cricketer who passed away recently.”\n\nIn the 1957-58 season, Dattajiro Krishnarao, who was commonly called DK, captained the Baroda team and led them to a Ranji title. After the death of Deepak Shodhan in 2016 at the age of 87, Gaekwad was the oldest living Indian cricketer. However, with DK’s passing, C.D. Gopinath has now become the oldest-living Indian cricketer.\n\nIn 1952, DK Gaekwad started playing for India and continued to represent the country for nine years in international cricket. During his career, he played 11 Test matches and scored a total of 350 runs, with an average of 18.42. He managed to score only one fifty during his entire tenure.\n\nGaekwad was a prominent cricketer in the domestic circuit, having played 110 first-class games for Baroda. He had an impressive record of scoring 5,788 runs, which included 17 centuries and 23 fifties, at an average of 36.40. Additionally, he was a leg-break bowler and took 25 wickets in first-class cricket before retiring.\n\nHowever, India legend Sunil Gavaskar slammed the apex board for being late in honouring Gaekwad. Gavaskar stated that the players should have worn the armbands on day 1 instead of day 3.\n\n“Better late than never… they should’ve done it on Day 1 but better late than never,” Gavaskar said on commentary as the players took the field. “He was captain of the Indian team in a five-match series. He captained four out of the five matches and the other one was captained by Pankaj Roy.”"
