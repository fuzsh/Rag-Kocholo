        "text": "New Delhi: In a sad day for Indian cricket, the former oldest Indian Test cricketer and captain, Dattaji Gaekwad, passed away in the early hours of Tuesday, February 13. Dattaji was 95 years old and held the title of being the oldest living Indian cricketer before his death.\n\nRenowned sports editor, Abhishek Tripathi reposted Adirajsinh Jadeja’s tweet, where he confirmed the passing away of Gaekwad.\n\nDattajiro Krishnarao, famously known as DK, represented Baroda and led his side to a Ranji title in the 1957-58 season in his first edition as the captain. Gaekwad became the oldest living Indian cricketer after the sad demise of Deepak Shodhan aged 87 in the year 2016. Now with DK’s demise, C.D. Gopinath has become the oldest-living Indian cricketer.\n\nTalking about DK Gaekwad, he made his India debut in 1952. In his nine-year international career, the right-hand batter represented his country in 11 Test games. DK scored 350 runs at an average of 18.42, which featured a solitary fifty.\n\nHowever, he played for Baroda in 110 first-class games and amassed 5,788 runs, averaging 36.40. With 17 centuries and 23 fifties, Gaekwad was a prominent figure in the domestic circuit. He also bowled leg-break and ended his career with 25 wickets in first-class cricket.\n\nNotably, Gaekwad celebrated his 95th birthday on October 27, 2023. Here is a compilation of DK’s biography posted on Twitter by Aditya Bhushan,\n\nAfter retirement, DK joined the Baroda Cricket Association and guided several budding cricketers, some of them even went on to represent India.\n\nGaekwad’s son Anshuman also went on to play for India. The 71-year-old represented India in 55 matches across formats and was conferred with the C.K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in June 2018, the highest honour conferred by BCCI on a former player."
