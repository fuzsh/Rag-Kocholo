        "text": "He was nearly 25 years my senior in age but th­at was quickly bridged when we talked cricket. Balu Alag­anan was the perfect gentlem­an cricketer I have come acr­oss. He could never think or say anything mean or negati­ve even if he tried. Positive th­inking and talking was all that he believed in. But the gentle demeanor and easy sm­ile did not hide his profo­und knowledge of various as­pects of the game.\n\nI was too young to see him play but thanks to my profession as a sports journalist I had the good fortune of having long chats with him duri­ng the days when he was active as an administrator, selector and one of the leading commentators over All India Radio. At the MAC stadium while watching a match, at a social function or whenever we met casually the talk was always about cricket a game he loved and embellished du­ring a decade-long first class career.\n\nThe figures against his na­me are modest — just six ma­tches and 191 runs with a hi­ghest score of 106 and three wickets at six runs apiece. But Alaganan has an honoured place in Tamil Nadu cricket as the man who was at the he­lm when the state first won the Ranji Trophy in 1954-55.\n\nIt was left to Alaganan and his team members to break the jinx. He didn’t do it with an all-conquering side for the squad had just one player who had represented India in an official Test in CD Gopinath.\n\nFor the record Holkar had three players who had represented India in official Tests in skipper Mushtaq Ali, CT Sarw­ate and Hiralal Gaikwad besides BB Nimbalkar who had played in an unofficial ‘Test’. And he was not a captain just in name for he played a crucial role in that final triumph.\n\nWhen MK Murugesh joined him for the last wicket in the second innings Madras were in a shaky position. The story goes that Murugesh told his ca­ptain “don’t treat me as a ta­i­lender, I will stay with you.”\n\nAnd he did getting 36 and figuring in a 92-run partnership that proved decisive in the end. Alaganan himself re­mained unbeaten with 56. Typical of Alaganan he spoke highly of his team mates saying that he was lucky to have as his colleagues a band of fine sportsmen whose aim was on­ly to do well as a team. He also gave credit to the two coaches AG Ram Singh and KS Kannan who he said “spared no effort in moulding us into a well trained and disciplined unit.”\n\nBetter known for his cricketing ability Alaganan was also a fine tennis player good enough to win state titles in singles and doubles. He was also a familiar figure in golfing circles and loved to discu­ss the two sports.\n\nAs a selector he had an eye for spotting talent and as an administrator — he was TNCA President from the late 1980s to the early 1990s — all that mattered to him was whether the decisions taken by the executive committee benefited the game and the players."
