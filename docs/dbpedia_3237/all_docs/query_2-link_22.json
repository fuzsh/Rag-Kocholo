        "text": "What's more precious than owning this watch? Here, I have an incident that is more precious than this watch. I had an appointment at 11 am to meet the CEO of a startup firm at Technopark, Trivandrum. While I was waiting in the reception, glancing at the magazines and my watch for my meeting, I noticed another person anxiously fidgeting with an A4 sheet in his hand. When the CEO walked in and smiled at me, this person quickly approached and said, \"I just need 10 minutes of your time.\" I stepped back and told the CEO I could wait. 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧: \"I am Suresh from Kanyakumari, and I have been working as an Automation Engineer for the past 3 years. Our company had to lay off a few employees due to business issues, and I have been asked to serve notice until next week. I have applied to 12 companies in the last week. Would you be able to help me with any opportunities in your firm?\" 𝐂𝐄𝐎: With a slightly changed expression, he called the HR in-charge after reviewing the papers given. The HR confirmed there are no active positions currently. 𝐂𝐄𝐎: \"Suresh, did you look for jobs online instead of meeting people in person and look for jobs in Kerala?\" 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡: \"Yes, I did apply but I am looking only for jobs in Trivandrum.\" 𝐂𝐄𝐎: \"Why do you appear so desperate in your job search now?\" 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡: \"Sir, I have financial issues at home, and I am clueless what to do without a job!\" 𝐂𝐄𝐎: \"Suresh, I want you to appear more confident and less desperate in your job search, regardless of what's happening at home. Never sell yourself short! And above all, if you want to grow, you should be flexible enough to consider opportunities in other locations to advance in your career.\" 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡: Nodded his head and replied with a moderate tone, \"Sir, I visited 12 companies in Technopark over the past few days, and most of the security personnel just took my resume and kept it on their desk. Few HR members collected my resume but did not respond properly. Today I feel happier that a CEO listened and gave me some guidance, which I will try to implement in my job search. Thank you, Sir,\" and he left. Though I had to wait for an additional 15 minutes, I found this encounter very meaningful. When I asked the CEO why he spent so much time helping Suresh? He shared that he had a very tough childhood with enormous challenges at home. Just because today I am successful doesn’t mean I shouldn’t do basic things like guiding others when the opportunity arises. Often, I see people in desperate need of a job behaving weakly due to various reasons, and we never know their story. Most of the time, their profiles end up in files or boxes that are rarely visited. To the #HRprofessionals here, \"Can we at least respond to candidates with respect and compassion?\" Let us not forget, \"We rise by lifting others.\" 𝑰 𝑰𝒏𝒌 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝑰 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌 # 11 #hiring #empathy"
