        "text": "[Cricinfo has carried a modified and abridged version of my article. Here is the full piece I penned (along with its original title) about meeting a gentleman and his family in Ahmedabad……..enjoy this dip into India’s cricket history and rekindle some nostalgia about an era, now long gone, that may appear kinder and gentler, but had its fair share of politics.]\n\nThe Cricinfo article is here: http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/993291.html\n\nThe tall and elegant 87- (going on 88-) year old met me with a broad smile as he gingerly, yet without assistance, descended the small flight of stairs leading to the drawing room at his family home in Ahmedabad. Slim and so well maintained for someone nearing 90, I thought – the word ‘gangly’ passed through my mind, but that would have been inappropriate for this distinguished gentleman, with the kindly smile, grayed bushy eyebrows and warm demeanor. And, he was hardly awkward as the term ‘gangly’ implies; something I was totally convinced of during my conversation with him of under an hour. If anything, his voice cracked just a bit every now and then, which made him slightly inaudible (or was it my own hearing?!) – throughout our conversation he maintained that smile even as his eyes appeared to look into the distance as he recounted one tale after another, almost as if he was searching back deep into his memory, all of which I sensed he treasured immensely. All hallmarks of someone who knew exactly what he was talking about; and had his mind and wits fully about him.\n\nThanks to my acquaintance and his niece, Manisha Shodhan Basu, I was visiting her beloved ‘kaka’, Roshan Harshadlal Shodhan, better known as Deepak Shodhan. “D K is younger to me by 15 days!!”, he exclaimed to me as I said I was privileged to be meeting India’s oldest living test cricketer. Dattajirao Krishnarao [‘D K’] Gaekwad, father of the former India opening batsman and later coach of India, Anshuman, and who played 11 tests for India captaining the side in five rather disastrous test matches in England in 1959, is born on 27th October 1928, nine days after Deepak Shodhan – so, he had got the dates slightly wrong, but that made no difference to the moniker of ‘Deepak Shodhan, India’s oldest living test cricketer’. “You know, apart from D K and me, I’ve counted at least six other old Indian test cricketers – [C D] Gopinath; [Madhav] Apte; ‘Bapu’ Nadkarni, Nari [Contractor], Chandu [Borde]; and Salim [Durrani]. There are apparently 11 of us Indian test players over 80, although I can’t recall the names of the others!” He is only off by one – there are actually twelve above 80-year old Indian test cricketers still alive today; the others being Chandrakant Patankar; Sadashiv Patil; V V Kumar; and Prakash Bhandari.\n\nCarrying the conversation forward, I mentioned to Deepak Shodhan that India’s oldest living first class cricketer had only recently expired at the end of February – at age 99, Bindiganavile Krishnaswamy [B K] Garudachar played for, and later captained, Mysore. I asked Deepak Kaka if he had ever known or played against B K Garudachar, or for that matter any of the other well-known Mysore cricketers, such as, for instance, Shafi Darashah, Mysore’s first captain. He answered in the negative, while reading the articles I had printed out for him on B K Garudachar – he asked for, and I left with him, those articles, as he was keen to read them at leisure. “Most of my domestic cricket with the South Indian teams were against Madras and their players, so I know them quite well. But, Kasturirangan is the one Mysore cricketer I remember and know well – he was selected with me for the first Indian tour of the West Indies in 1953 but could not make it, he actually declined the invitation. Kanaiya Ram from Madras came instead”. After going back and doing my follow-on homework, I confirmed what I was beginning to realize about Deepak Shodhan – that, in addition to him being in fine physical mettle for an octogenarian, his mind was not only active retelling many stories, his memory was also razor sharp and accurate. He was right on both counts – N Kannayiram of Madras had, indeed, replaced Gopalaswamy Iyengar Kasturirangan who used to open the bowling for Mysore, for the 1953 West Indies tour, India’s first tour there.\n\nOur chat then moved to Deepak Shodhan’s ‘in-the-limelight’ moment – that for which he will forever be remembered. “I was in the reserves for the series against Pakistan in 1952-53, the historic first test series between our two newly independent nations. And, in the final test match at Calcutta, I was drafted into the playing eleven after our captain Vijay Hazare pulled out unwell. It was Lala Amarnath who was captaining India in Vijay Hazare’s absence, who asked for me to be brought in; that tall Gujarati boy who had done so well in the trials and other matches!” What follows is so well documented that I actually skipped through this portion which most people would otherwise focus on in Deepak Shodhan’s career, to try to dig deeper into his tryst with cricket – suffice it to say then that, coming in No. 8 when India were at 179/6 in their first innings behind Pakistan’s 257, the left-handed Deepak Shodhan scored a 110 on debut before being the last man out at 397, securing for India a lead of a 140 runs. He thus became the first player to score a hundred in the very first innings of his first test match for India. As Cricinfo notes (http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/34007.html), after this ‘memorable debut’, Deepak Shodhan was ‘immediately hailed as a bright new star on the Indian batting horizon’. That his case soon became one of ‘the most baffling in the history of Indian cricket’ has again been widely documented, chiefly because he played – amazingly – only two further tests and has the highest batting average of any Indian cricketer over a completed career.\n\n“I loved playing cricket: my first class career stretched on to 1962, ten years after I played my last test match”. And, in that one sentence, indeed one phrase – ‘loved playing cricket’ – I sensed the glint in his eye about his favourite sport as he looked at the blank wall ahead. Here was someone, in his prime and rearing to go as a young cricketer, who loved to play the game the way it was meant to be – fun – in a kinder, gentler era. And, he was probably telling me – not without perhaps a hidden tear – that he would have loved to have played for his country more. Nostalgia soon, however, overtook him and enveloped me as well.\n\n“Winning the Ranji Trophy in 1957-58 was the highlight of my later career. I had moved in 1956 from playing for Gujarat to Baroda. We beat the Services in the Final in that year, 1958. D K was captain, but the man who called all the shots was the Maharaja, Fatehsinh Gaekwad, in terms of team selection and batting order. Neither of them, D K or Fatehji, were great players; look at their records. But they ensured they and several other players who would not have otherwise made it to the team on the basis of their performance, were picked – I mean, look at ‘Mama’ Ghorpade!” I was getting to know that apart from a clear memory and a solid physical frame at his age, Deepak kaka was also candid – another great characteristic of a senior not afraid to speak his mind, a culmination so to speak of a youth and a life well spent on his own terms and now, finally, in the eventide of his life, candor emanating from a position of knowledge, understanding and fearlessness to be forthright. Looking at the career of Jaysinhrao Ghorpade, the Maharaja of Baroda’s uncle or ‘Mama’, one wonders how one with no real performance worth citing, played in 8 test matches. And, even the records of D K and Fatehji Gaekwad, are testimony to mediocrity so often seen in the Indian teams of those days, while class players were left out to wither and rot without a proper playing career.\n\nDeepak Shodhan then jumped back to his debut test match – “Two of the earlier batsmen [out of deference to Deepak Shodhan, I won’t mention their names], threw their wickets away going for big shots – I got the feeling that the ugly politics of the Indian team was behind it. Denying me a hundred was the reason. But, (D G ‘Dattu’) Phadkar was a great guy, unlike many of his Bombay teammates, and we had a good partnership. For the last wicket, the mild gentleman cricketer from Hyderabad, Ghulam Ahmed, supported me right through to my century. We were lucky to have had Lala (Amarnath) as the captain for that match – he was standing in for Vijay Hazare. Lala was an attacking captain and he was the one who picked me for that test match. He always maintained contact with the players, spoke to them. Unlike Vijay Hazare, a great batsmen, but not fit for the captaincy as he was too mild, defensive and would not talk to the players”. Deepak Shodhan’s scintillating performance in Calcutta meant that he was an almost automatic selection for India’s maiden tour of the West Indies: “The sea journey was horrible; it was a small boat without much ballast, so it kept rolling and tossing, and almost all of us were sick. (G S, Gulab) Ramchand was originally my roommate in sharing a room on this tour. But, I switched to Pankaj Roy’s room, who was earlier staying with D K, who hardly spoke. Pankaj was glad to have me as his roommate.” What was left unsaid was the reason for Ramchand shifting out of Deepak Shodhan’s room – that left we wondering too, perhaps some part of the ‘politics’ of the Indian cricket team?\n\nI moved our conversation along to Deepak Shodhan’s first class debut: “That was Gujarat against Saurashtra in 1946 – 47”. Here, for the one and only time in my conversation, did Deepak kaka get his facts wrong – he actually made his debut in India’s year of independence, against Kathiawar (not Saurashtra) at the Municipal Stadium in Rajkot. “I took four wickets in the first innings; three in the second. The rest were all taken, I think, by Mankad. I was unusual you know – a left handed batsmen and a left arm medium pacer”. And, saying that he lifted his left arm over his shoulder with his fingers and wrist bent slightly as if clutching a cricket ball, and ‘spun’ the imaginary ball out with his middle and index fingers of his left hand. Once again the sprightly youth in the man seemed to jump out, and I could just about imagine him running in to bowl his left armers – that along with his ‘loved playing cricket’ comment seemed to me the highlight of our chat as both epitomized the vigor, strength and character of this fine, old cricketer.\n\n“You know my brother, Jyotindra, who is a few years senior to me and still alive, was a much better cricketer than me”. At this juncture, Deepak Shodhan’s wife of 62 years, Gauri, interjected to say that Jyotindra should have been selected to play for India; Deepak’s selection was by chance. Indeed, in Deepak Shodhan’s debut first class match against Kathiawar, Jyotindra scored his maiden first class century, the first of only two centuries he ever made. What a fine way to greet a younger brother into the team!\n\nDeepak Shodhan then began to reminisce about his time as captain of the Gujarat team: “I became the captain in the 1952-53 season when Nari Contractor made his debut for Gujarat. And, what a debut that was! Against a strong Baroda team, Nari scored a century in both innings! I was with him playing when he got the second; I scored a century too”. What Deepak Shodhan omits is the fact that in this match both brothers, Jyotindra and Deepak, would have made history by scoring centuries; except that Jyotindra missed his by two runs in the first innings.\n\nI was now coming to the end of the interview, and got up to click some photographs. Just as I was done photographing, Deepak Shodhan suddenly said: “You know C K Nayudu, right?”. I nodded and said yes, of course I knew one of India’s foremost cricketers of yesteryears. Pat came the reply: “He was no good as an administrator or selector; nor did he have any real good performances on the test field. Look at his record”. That stumped me. Deepak Shodhan continued: “Once for the Combined Universities XI, where I was included in the team, we played against the visiting Commonwealth team in 1953-54 in Bangalore, on the Central College Ground. Nayudu was the team manager or selector, I can’t remember, and he was there deciding the batting order. So, he would make these on-the spur decisions, and he asked Nari to open, which Nari refused saying that he was a specialist No. 3 batsmen. So there I was a lower order batsmen and bowler, asked to open the batting by Nayudu! Nari and I scored centuries in the second innings and we shared a wonderful partnership for the 3rd wicket. I remember Raman Subba Row from that series; as well as Wes Hall from the earlier Commonwealth team tour of 1950”.\n\nThat got me thinking – here was a fine cricketer who had an impeccable, though short, record in test matches and a consistent set of performances against touring teams, in the Ranji and other domestic competitions. Why was he discarded so soon and so unceremoniously without having been given a fair shot? The answer sadly, is the all-to-familiar story of the early days in the 1950s and 60s, in particular, of Indian cricket – in one word as Deepak Shodhan summed it up “Politics!”. And, in his case, his well-known run in against India’s first celebrity cricketer, the Sachin Tendulkar of his day, Vinoo Mankad. That story having been told elsewhere fully, I only ventured to enquire of Deepak Shodhan why he and Mankad had this falling out – Deepak Shodhan’s answer was instructive and illuminating: “Human nature. Mankad was employed in Ahmedabad in the late 1940s and played for Gujarat. Then, for some reason he got kicked out and always held a grudge against Gujarat and Gujarati players. He was a hopeless man: asking me at the time I got into the Indian team whether I choose to support him or Vijay Hazare. To which I told him I support India and the team, and that ticked him off. Also, after the West Indies tour, our manager C Ramaswamy from Madras (the man who, many years later, walked out of his home one day and disappeared) is supposed to have written against me in his report. I have never held any thing against him, Mankad or anyone else for not having played more for India.” Again those words came back to my mind – he ‘loved playing cricket’ and how might that boyish enthusiasm have matured into him having attained a long and successful test career, we shall never know.\n\nAs I started preparing to leave, Deepak “kaka” said: “You know my wife waited until after I came back from the West Indies after spending time in the USA, to get married to me. We got married in 1954 after a four year courtship”. The loving smile on Mrs. Shodhan’s face says it all – the absence of a test career pales into insignificance before such a loving family so closely knit together, great-grandparents now, the Shodhans still live in a joint family. Bidding my goodbyes, I was seen of by Deepak Shodhan at his front door, as he walked me out. Small gestures from a gentlemanly cricketer that I wish I could have seen in his prime – and daresay, India should have seen more of him in his heyday. I turned at the gate to wave to him, and he waved back all smiles which I’ve come to associate with him – he certainly made my day; and, perhaps I, his.\n\n* * * * * * * *"
