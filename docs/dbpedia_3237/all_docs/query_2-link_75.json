        "text": "India's 25th Test brought its first win\n\nCRICKET: To get the first victory in Test cricket is what every cricket playing country yearns for because that first win is bound to spur the team to better deeds in the future. So, this was the case as India was concerned. So they waited patiently and their moment of joy came in the 25th official Test when they met England in the 1951-52 series in Chepauk, Madras.\n\nIn that memorable game for India, England batted first and made 266 in the first innings and 183 in their second turn. India struck up that good first innings total of 457 for 9 wickets declared.\n\nFor England J.D.B. Robertson had two fine half-century knocks. What spurred up the Indian team in their victory charge was the fine batting of five of their top cricketers - Pankaj Roy, Polly Umrigar, D.G. Phadkar and bowlers Vinoo Mankad and Ghulam Ahmed.\n\nIf there was one cricketer to be singled out in this game, he was undoubtedly that fine allrounder Vinoo Mankad. It was Mankad's bowling that really tilted the match in favour of the Indians. He had a record haul of 12 wickets in the match, getting 8 for 55 in England's first innings and then when the England batsmen were facing an innings defeat, Mankad it was who caused their downfall with a haul of 4 for 53 and Ghulam Ahmed got inspiration from Mankad and Ahmed too came in for wickets - 4 for 77 for bring victory India's way.\n\nMankad was an allrounder of immense talent and he had the unique distinction of being perhaps the only cricketer to have batted at every slot, from number one to ten in first-class cricket. In this Test, Mankad made just 22, but it was his bowling that tilted the scales in favour of the Indians.\n\nRecipient of the President's Award for his outstanding contribution to cricket in India, Mankad had played for his country as the first choir in England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies and Sri Lanka too.\n\nMankad was here in 1945 as a member of the Indian team on its first tour of the country under the leadership of Vijay merchant. Mankad gave the Sri Lankan crowd a glimpse of his bowling greatness. This was long before Sri Lanka thought of Test cricket and at the Saravanamuttu Stadium - then known as the Colombo Oval, in a three-day game, Mankad bowled with utmost accuracy and claimed 8 for 35 off 21.3 overs to destroy Sri Lanka for 107 runs.\n\nIndia made 179 in their first innings. In the second innings, Sri Lanka were saved from defeat with a fine century by S. Sathasivam.\n\nIn their victory march against England, in batting it was Pankaj Roy the opener and Polly Umrigar who made centuries and pushed India to get on top of their Test. Roy made 111 and Umrigar 130 not out and to give further push in the batting, there was D.G. Phadkar who made 61 to push the Indians to 457 for 9 wickets and then the innings was closed.\n\nPankaj Roy was sometimes erratic in his performances. He was an opening batsman and had periods of success interspersed with those of failure. He had a successful debut against England at home in 1952.\n\nGhulam Ahmed who captured 4 for 77 in the England second innings total of 183, gave sound back-up support to Mankad when the Indians pushed for victory in that memorable game that brought up India's inaugural win in Test cricket.\n\nPolly Umrigar's fine unbeaten knock of 130 runs contributed in no small measure to India's victory against England in this match. He gave the necessary punch to the batting and helped India's cause."
