The show aired on Zee TV from 16 January 2006 to 12 March 2009, when the series ended due to cost issues.[1] The story is about three sisters: Bani, Piya and Rano.\n\nThree Dixit sisters; Bani, Pia and Rano are different but are close to each other. They live in Mount Abu. After their father's death, the three sisters go to Mumbai to live with Jai Udai Walia, a ruthless business tycoon who knew their parents. Jai falls for Pia, but she loves Jai's employee Pushkar Shukla and is more interested in Jai's wealth. Their marriage is arranged but on the wedding day, Pia elopes with Pushkar. To save the Dixit family's honor and mostly persuaded by Jai's cunning sister Jigyasa, Bani takes Pia's place at the altar and marries Jai. Jai is initially furious, but slowly comes to fall for Bani. They kiss after a family function arranged by Jai’s friend Roshni. Jai's younger nephew and Jigyasa's younger son Sahil falls for Rano and they get married.\n\nThough Pia is married to Pushkar, after an argument with Pushkar she becomes interested in Jai's wealth and tries to steal him from Bani. Once Jai goes on a business trip, Pia follows him, spikes his drink, and sexually assaults him. This leaves Jai shaken.\n\nOn Bani and Jai's one-year anniversary, it is revealed that Pia is pregnant with Jai's child. Bani goes into trauma but later forgives them. Pia gives birth to a son, Veer while Rano gives birth a son, Varun. Sahil is killed and Pia frames Bani for Sahil's death and blackmails Jai: he can either let Bani spend life in jail or testify that she is mentally ill and she can spend only five years in a mental hospital. Jai, who is left with no option, rules that Bani is mentally ill and she is sent to a mental hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, she gives birth to twins Krishna and Atharva but they are taken away by Jai. Bani escapes from the hospital and is rescued by a man named Aparajit Deb who takes her under his wing. He takes an interest in her. He offers her to come with him abroad so she can get away from her past. Bani agrees but promises that she will return for her children.\n\nKrishna and Atharva are now five years old. Pia does not take care of them. Bani, who has adopted the name Durga Dasgupta, returns to take her children and exposes Pia for what she has done and take revenge against Jai. Later she learns that Jai has done nothing and he testified against her only to save her. Pia is thrown out of the house. Pia meets with an accident and is left in a wheelchair. Bani and Rano forgive her and help her.\n\nIt is revealed that Bani had a twin sister Anamika and she is dead. Her husband Daksh Randheria became mentally unstable after that. He only acts normal when he is with Bani. Krishna and Atharva are kidnapped and murdered in front of Bani and Jai. Struck by the loss of his children and instigation by Jigyasa, Jai kicks Bani out of the house. Jai's aunt supports Bani and leaves the house. Bani, feeling like she has nothing left, tries to kill herself but is saved. She is revealed to be pregnant and finds hope in her life again. Daksh is cured.\n\nBani lives by the name of Maithili with Jai's aunt and her 5-year-old daughter Ganga in Meerut. Daksh is helping Bani. Jai has moved on and made his business flourish. He has remarried to Meera Khandelwal. Jai meets Ganga and has a good connection with her, not knowing that Ganga is his daughter. Later he learns that Ganga is his daughter. Ganga is revealed to have blood cancer and the only way she can survive is by a bone marrow transplant that can only be donated by family. This makes Jai and Bani come together to save Ganga. Jai learns the truth that Bani was never having an affair with Daksh and apologizes to her. Jigyasa is revealed to have gotten the Walia twins kidnapped. Jai sends Jigyasa to jail but Bani does not believe that Jigyasa killed them. Jigyasa is taking the blame for the murder because the actual killer has blackmailed her that they would kill Jigyasa's elder son Ranbir if she didn't take the blame.\n\nBani gives birth to another set of twins, who are named after Krishna and Atharva. Ganga undergoes surgery and is cured. Daksh finds out who killed the twins but before he can reveal it, he is murdered. The family takes a trip to Bani's maternal home in Mount Abu. Pia is revealed to be fine and had been pretending to be handicapped to save Bani because the real killer is one of their family members. Pushkar takes Pia and Veer with him. It is revealed that Krishna and Atharva's killer is Meera. Meera confesses her crimes to Bani and sets Bani on fire. Bani falls off a cliff, burning, into the lake. She is declared dead, which leaves Jai and the family devastated.\n\nBani is revealed to be alive. She is saved by a man named Partho Mitra. She loses her memory and her face is severely damaged. She gets a new face with plastic surgery. Partho adopts her and moves to Kolkata with her.\n\nBani and Jai's children, Krishna and Ganga are grown up. Bani lives as Pronita Mitra and has hazy nightmares of the night Meera tried to kill her. Soon, she meets Jai in Mount Abu but Jai does not recognize her because of her new face. She also completes Ganga's painting in a painting exhibition. Bani is invited to a party at the Walia mansion where she sees Meera and regains her memory. She vows to take down Meera. She learns that Meera has spoilt her children and her own son. She exposes Meera in front of Jai. Meera accepts all the allegations and tells Jai the truth that she spoilt his children because Ganga and Krishna are Bani's daughters and if he divorced her she will claim her share in the property. Jai and Bani decide to teach her a lesson. Jai pretends to apologize to Meera and asks for their second marriage. Jai and Bani trick Meera into signing divorce papers and Bani sits in the mandap and they marry. They also teach their children a lesson. Jai and Meera's son also learns about Meera's truth and disowns her. It is revealed that Partho had been working with Jigyasa and Jigyasa was the one who saved her when Meera tried to kill her 16 years ago.\n\nMeera tries to ruin Ganga's life by having her marry Pratyush Mittal. Mittals are bankrupt and Pratyush is pretending to be in love with Ganga. Bani learns about it and with the help of Ganga's friend Rishi Tyagi and her hired actress Sonali expose Pratyush and Mittal family on the day of marriage. The Mittal family is arrested and Rishi who had fallen in love with Ganga makes a proposal in front of Walia family of marrying Ganga. Ganga initially refuses but later agrees. They then marry. Bani tries to scare Meera pretending to be Bani's ghost/spirit/soul. Meera learns that Bani is alive and tries to kill her. Bani is saved by Jigyasa. Jai stops Meera from attacking Jigyasa. He is so furious that he tries to kill Meera but he is stopped by Walia family. Meera is exposed and sent to jail. Jigyasa reunites with her family. Jigyasa lies to Walia family that she had hired Pronita to expose Meera. Rano and Pia come to know that Pronita is actually Bani and with help of Pushkar prove that Pronita is actually Bani. Ganga falls in love with Rishi. Jai and Pia's son Veer comes to Mumbai. He is unaware of Jai, Bani, Pia's past because he is raised by Pia and Pushkar. He thinks Pushkar is his father. When he learns about Jai, Bani, and Pia's past, he, after Jigyasa's instigation, starts planning and plotting against Bani. Jigyasa then creates a rift between Jai and Meera's son Vicky and Ganga, and due to this stress, Jai has a heart attack and is paralyzed. The Walia family then make peace and Jigyasa apologizes to Bani for everything.\n\nThe family has relocated to Mount Abu, Bani and Jai come to their family during the festival of Holi and they celebrate with the whole family. Jai is completely well. The three sisters talk about how they started their journey here in Mount Abu, they are happy together with their family and all ends well.\n\nPrachi Desai as\n\nBani Dixit Walia (before plastic surgery) – Nishikant and Kiran's eldest daughter;
