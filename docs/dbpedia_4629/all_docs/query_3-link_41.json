        "text": "Indian actress\n\nPakhi Sharma, famous as Bobby Darling and formerly known as Pankaj Sharma, is a trans Indian actress active in Bollywood and regional Indian film industry.[1]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPakhi Sharma was born in Delhi, India,[citation needed] as Pankaj Sharma.[2] She is famously known as Bobby Darling.[3] Coming out as a trans woman at a young age, she ran into problems with her family due to her gender identity.[citation needed] Her mother died when Darling was a teenager.[citation needed] She said in a 2009 interview that her appearance on the reality show Sacch Ka Saamna (Hindi: सच का सामना, \"Facing the Truth\"), the Indian version of the popular American show The Moment of Truth, helped reunite her with her father.[citation needed] The two were brought together on the show when her dad was the special surprise guest.\n\nShe has been a vocal supporter of LGBT rights.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2015, Darling declared that she was going to marry Ramneek Sharma, a Bhopal-based businessman. The couple married in February 2016.[4]\n\nIn September 2017, Darling filed for divorce against Ramneek Sharma, citing cheating, breach of trust, matrimonial cruelty and unnatural sex.[5] In May 2018, Ramneek Sharma was arrested and sent to jail on charges of domestic violence. In a message, Bobby said, “This is to inform all my fans, friends and family that my husband was arrested by Delhi police on 11.5.18 and was in police custody for 4 days. Thereafter, he moved application for bail before Delhi courts which has been rejected. Justice is being meted out!”.[4]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\n2005, Best Supporting Actor/Actress, Monaco International Film Festival, (Monaco) for Navarasa\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1999 Taal Dress Designer 2001 Style — 2002 Na Tum Jaano Na Hum — Maine Dil Tujhko Diya Jeena Sirf Merre Liye 2003 Valentine Days Stumped Chalte Chalte 2004 Tum – A Dangerous Obsession Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa Tauba Tauba 2005 Page 3 Kyaa Kool Hai Hum Kiran Nazar Dancer Navarasa Bobby 2006 Mr 100% – The Real Player Herself Naughty Boy Saawan – The Love Season Tom, Dick, and Harry Ek Se Mera Kya Hoga Katputtli Hota Hai Dil Pyaar Mein Paagal Apna Sapna Money Money Bobby Mohabbati 2007 Traffic Signal 2008 Phir Tauba Tauba Mr. White Mr. Black Dhoom Dadakka Money Hai Toh Honey Hai 2009 Shadow Club '07 Potadar Kirti 2010 Will You Marry Me?
