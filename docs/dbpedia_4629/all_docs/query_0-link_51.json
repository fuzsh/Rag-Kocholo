        "text": "4 Years Later\n\nJagdish completes his MBBS and wants to work at Mumbai. Jagdish wants to marry Gauri, so he confesses the truth to Anandi that he doesn't love her, actually, he didn't his self knows that whether he loved Gauri or just impressed by her. Bhairon slaps and breaks all his ties with Jagdish stating that he has cheated Anandi. Gauri comes to know that Jagat is married and also that he lives in Jaitsar, not in Jaipur, ruined her life in childhood by marrying her with him and rejects her. So she wants to leave him.\n\nLater she accepts Jagdish. Jagdish marries Gauri thinking that his marriage with Anandi was not valid as they were married in childhood and he comes back home with Gauri where family refuses to accept their marriage except Anandi. Bhairon asks Anandi to file a case against Jagdish by claiming that she is his legally wedded wife as according to the law if you are married in childhood and continue your marriage even after teenage then your marriage is considered legal. Anandi Singh refuses to do so and allows Jagdish to live with Gauri by thinking that marriage should be believed by heart and not forcefully.\n\nAfter sometime Gauri gets pregnant but miscarries the baby which is then blamed to Anandi by brainwashing Jagdish. Because of the rejection from her in-laws, Gauri becomes vengeful towards them creating problems in her marital life with Jagdish. Anandi faces new challenges trying to carve her identity out in the world. She starts to educate the village girls, fights against child marriage, and becomes Sarpanch Bitiya of Jaitsar. Anandi decides to move on by giving divorce to Jagdish, soon she sends divorce papers to Jagdish which makes Jagdish furious and he asks for his share in the property in spite of the divorce because of Gauri's attempt of brainwashing him. Anandi refuses to do so by saying if he will not divorce her without asking any share then she will file a complaint against him for illegally marrying Gauri. By hearing this Gauri steps back and asks him to sign the divorce papers without asking for anything. Anandi meets district collector Shivraj Shekhar, who is impressed with her.\n\nJagdish's family wants Anandi to marry Shivraj. Jagdish and Gauri have constant fights and finally, he comes to know that Gauri is cheating on him. He divorces her and realizes his mistakes. Jagdish vows to reunite with Anandi but is shocked learning about her wedding with Shiv. He tries to create misunderstandings between Shiv and Anandi but fails. Anandi marries Shiv and forgives Jagdish and they remain friends.\n\nJagdish meets Ganga, another victim of child marriage and domestic violence and helps her in fulfilling her dream of being educated and becoming a nurse. Later Jagdish goes to Mumbai to complete his MS and Anandi moves to Udaipur with Shivraj.\n\nAfter Anandi moves to Udaipur, Saanchi started hanging out with Jagdish and eventually developed a crush on him. She proposed the idea of marrying Jagdish to her parents and family and they agreed to talk to Jagdish's family. Jagdish agreed to marry Saanchi and the preparations for their marriage started. He actually did not want so, but thinking that the proposal came from the in-laws of Anandi, and that he did not want Anandi to suffer upon his rejection, and seeing that his family was too in favour of the marriage, he is left with no option but to agree.\n\nSaanchi thought that Ganga might be an obstacle to her marriage and tried to turn Sumitra against Ganga. A few days later, Ratan Singh (Ganga's husband) attacked Jagdish's family for Ganga's son, completely turning Sumitra against Ganga. However, Ratan Singh ended up getting arrested by the police and Ganga divorced him.\n\nSanchi wanted to marry Jagdish but later Jagdish come to know that Sanchi is just acting that she liked their family and to live in the village. Saanchi and Jagdish get engaged and Ganga goes to Mangalore for further studies. In order to complete his MS, and to stop his feelings for Ganga, Jagdish also goes to Mumbai. But in Mangalore, a bad guy named Bala tries to rape her. Ganga tries to seek help of the police, but she ended up being in jail.\n\n6 Months Later\n\nJagdish completes his MS and returns home. When the coffee shop incident (when Sanchi reavels the real truth infront of her friends) takes place, Jagdish goes to Sanchi's home and confesses that he'll not marry Sanchi; without telling the actual reason to Anandi's in-laws.\n\nAnandi's in-laws are left in distraught and are highly offended at Jagdish. Meanwhile, he feels that Ganga is the most suitable wife for him, who also reflects the qualities of Anandi, and he marries Ganga. His family (especially his mother Sumitra) does not accept Ganga as their daughter-in-law. But gradually, Jagdish's father Bhairon, Basant and Gehna feel compassion towards Jagdish. Sanchi gets so offended that she becomes ready to get Jagdish arrested by filing a court case. A respected lawyer, Mr. Vivek Kabra fights the case on Jagdish's behalf. Anandi discloses the fact that she too was there with Jagdish in the coffee shop where Sanchi had revealed her inner truth. Also, Ganga records the bad words of Sanchi in her phone when she had met her outside her house, which serves as a good proof for Jagdish to win the case. Both the families come to know that Jagdish was completely innocent and Sanchi was the one who had such evil plans. Later on, Jagdish and his family also accepts Ganga's son Mannu and later Ganga gives birth to Abhimanyu. After some time Alok and Meenakshi confess the truth that Shiv is not the son of Alok And Iravati, but he is son Of Anoop and Meenakshi. Later family comes to know that Anoop is Alive and Anoop returns. Anandi and Shivraj adopt an orphan named Amol who suffers from osteoarthritis giving him love and affection. Meanwhile, Sanchi comes under the influence of bad friends, who encourage her to consume alcohol. She falls in love with a bad guy named Saurabh. But later on, Saurabh got physical with her and records the whole activity in his mobile phone. He starts blackmailing Sanchi with that video. This time, Sanchi really accepts that she had always been a bad person. She got very emotional when her family still supported her. She realises all her mistakes and wholeheartedly accepts Anandi. Anandi encourages her to raise her voice against the injustice that Saurabh had done with her. Sanchi suggests the name of the lawyer Mr. Vivek Kabra who had previously fought the case against her (being Jagdish's lawyer). Sanchi feels that he can fight her case because even on the past, Mr. Kabra did not disrespect her family. When Shiv goes to Mr. Kabra's office, he is shocked to know that Mr. Vivek Kabra was the elder brother of Saurabh who had raped Sanchi! Vivek fights for his brother for few days, but when he comes to know the real truth that his brother was a rapist, he fights for Sanchi by providing the video that Saurabh had made as the proof. He sends Saurabh to Jail for 7 years. But in spite of doing the right thing, Vivek's parents get really offended and Vivek has no choice but to leave them. Later on, he gets really impressed by Sanchi by seeing how courageously she fought against the fake news spread by media. He goes to Sanchi's family and says that if they are ready, then he himself would marry Sanchi. After some time, Sanchi wholeheartedly accepts Vivek and marries him. After some time, Amol gets kidnapped, but Anandi and Shiv fortunately find him. Jagdish enters into politics and starts campaigning with his family and Anandi also. Jagdish has to face many obstacles set forth by bad politicians and people. One day, when a girl name Gulli, who was a friend of Anandi and was helping Jagdish in his campaigning, gets stuck in the middle of a deserted road in the car. She is told by Kaliyani devi on phone to go and wait for her to arrive in a nearby mandir. When Gulli walks towards the mandir, she spots Het Singh's son Ajey, consuming alcohol with his friends in a small hut like structure. Gulli spies on him and starts recording their activities in her mobile phone. But unfortunately, a person from the gang spots Gulli and Ajey and his friends abduct her and try to get physical with her. Just at that moment, Kaliyani Devi comes in the scene without Ajey's knowledge. She pick up the gun and ultimately frees Gulli and locks the bad guys in the room. When she and Gulli are about to leave from the site, Ajey comes on his motor cycle in full speed and throws a heavy rod to injure Gulli and Kaliyani Devi. Just at that moment, Kaliyani Devi, without a second thought fires the gun and shots Ajey dead on his motor cycle. She then takes injured Gulli to the hospital and in the way, realized that what she had done was a violent act that must not have been done by her. She regrets her fault and self-surrenders herself in the police station all by herself. She is locked up in the jail, and Gulli goes into coma. A court case is filed but at the end, with full evidences to support Kaliyani's point, she is declared innocent by the court in respect of self-protection. Soon, Jagdish successfully becomes the \"vidhayak ji\" of Jaitsar.\n\nBasant meets with an accident and dies, Gehna is left distraught with the news.\n\nKalyani and all her family go to the Mandir to pray and whilst there, they hear someone singing and his voice is so soothing, Kalyank asks the (pandit) priest who's voice it is and the pandit pointed up at the stairs and said that he did not know his name but he is such a devotee to the Mandir, that he doesn't speak to anyone, he just cleans, eats and sleeps there. Kalyani looks up at the stairs and called him to come down and as the devotee looked down he slips on some water on the stairs and comes rolling down the stairs, Shiv and Jagdish run towards him and as they turn him over, they realized it's Gehna's music (guru) teacher Niranjan and they take him home to take care of him.\n\nA painter Pralash comes to the village, Shiv shows him around. He has a portrait of Anandi in his room which he calls Venus, and when he Shiv first introduces Anandi to Pralash, he thinks its Venus and starts to pester her to make her life hell, from calling her constantly to following her to work and threatens to take her away from Shiv. Diwali night, everyone is enjoying the fireworks display as well as sparklers, the fireworks are so loud that Pralash kidnaps Anadi from under Shiv's nose. Shivraj and Anandi help Amol regain his ability to walk. Shivraj dies while trying to Udaipur from a terrorist attack. Amol is found by his real parents who had never abandoned him but lost him thinking he was dead, but they Give Anandi Amol Back.\n\nShortly after his death, Anandi gives birth to their twin children, Nandini and Shivam, but Akhiraj Singh kidnaps Nandini who is renamed Nimboli and made a slave by marrying his son Kundan as he wants to avenge Anandi for preventing Kundan's wedding with a child bride."
