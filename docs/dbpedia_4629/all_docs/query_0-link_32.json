Salman Khan returned as the host for the fourth time for a season which was longer than its predecessor, Bigg Boss 6 and lasted for 15 weeks (104 days) concluding on 28 December 2013. The seventh season was launched with the tagline- 'Jannat Ka Wow Aur Jahannam Ka Aaw Dekhege Saath Saath'.[2][3]\n\nThe series was won by Indian model and actress Gauahar Khan on 28 December 2013.[4] While Tanishaa Mukerji was runner-up, Ajaz Khan remained 3rd and Sangram Singh remained 4th.[5]\n\nProduction\n\nEye Logo\n\nThe season had a realistic eye logo having hell and heaven in the background. The eye featured eyelashes made of fire, red iris and black pupil having white veins in reddish sclera.\n\nHouse\n\nThe contestants were initially divided into two separate sections of the house, one called \"Heaven\" and the other \"Hell.\" The \"Heaven\" side of the house included the pool and considerably more luxuries, while residents of the \"Hell\" side lacked running water and a kitchen of their own. Inmates in \"Hell\" were forced to rely on the housemates in the \"Heaven\" side for food and to use a tap outdoors for water. This was revealed to the housemates on launch night, and entrants Tanishaa and Andy were tasked with dividing them into households.[6]\n\nAs long as the division lasted, inmates were not permitted to cross the boundaries or, except for food, share items between the two sides. On the 31st day, the \"Hell\" facility was demolished and all remaining contestants moved to \"Heaven.\"\n\nBroadcast\n\nThe series was first broadcast in India on network Colors beginning 15 September 2013.[7] The series was also broadcast in Pakistan on ARY Digital beginning 21 September 2013[8] and in the United Kingdom on Colors UK on 15 September 2013.[9]\n\nHousemate status\n\nSr Housemate Day entered Day exited Status 1 Gauahar Day 1 Day 44 Walked Day 45 Day 104 Winner 2 Tanishaa Day 1 Day 104 1st runner-up 3 Ajaz Day 40 Day 104 2nd runner-up 4 Sangram Day 1 Day 104 3rd runner-up 5 Andy Day 1 Day 101 Evicted 6 Armaan Day 1 Day 94 Ejected Day 95 Day 98 Evicted 7 Kushal Day 1 Day 44 Ejected Day 68 Day 95 Evicted 8 Kamya Day 1 Day 91 Evicted 9 Sofia Day 45 Day 84 Evicted 10 Elli Day 1 Day 70 Evicted 11 Pratyusha Day 1 Day 63 Evicted 12 Candy Day 42 Day 56 Evicted 13 Apurva Day 1 Day 49 Evicted 14 Asif Day 11 Day 42 Evicted 15 Vivek Day 32 Day 38 Evicted 16 Shilpa Day 1 Day 35 Evicted 17 Ratan Day 1 Day 28 Evicted 18 Anita Day 1 Day 21 Evicted 19 Rajat Day 1 Day 14 Evicted 20 Hazel Day 1 Day 7 Evicted\n\nHousemates\n\nThe participants in the order of appearance and entered in house are:[10]\n\nOriginal entrants\n\nTanishaa Mukerji – Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Telugu and Tamil actress.[11] She is the daughter of Tanuja & Shomu Mukherjee and is the youngest sister to Kajol.
