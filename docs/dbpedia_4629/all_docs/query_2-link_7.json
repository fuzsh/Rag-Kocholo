Currently, Mohit is seen as Haider Sheikh in Zee TV's Qubool Hai.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMohit Sehgal was born in Chandigarh, Punjab, but was brought up and received his schooling in Delhi. Upon finishing his education, he graduated from a College and eventually moved to Mumbai. The actor announced on November 19, 2010 that he is dating his Miley Jab Hum Tum co-star Sanaya Irani. On their second year anniversary, Mohit spoke of his insecurities towards his girlfriend. \"I used to be extremely scared initially and was afraid that I might lose her. But now I have full faith in her and I am secure.\" On 25th January 2016, Mohit married Sanaya in Goa.\n\nCareer[]\n\nMohit, began his acting career in 2007 as Vicky, a college boy in the movie Delhi Heights.

In 2012, Mohit starred in a comedy film titled, Family Aa Rahi Hai . Mohit's next major television role was as Siddharth Kapoor, the male protagonist of Mujhse Kuchh Kehti...Yeh Khamoshiyaan, which premiered on November 12, 2012. However, Mohit decided to quit the show, stating various reasons for his decision. The show was already under the scanner due to its poor ratings and hence, it had to be replaced by Saraswatichandra on February 25, 2013. Mohit is now seen in the role of Haider in Zee TV's popular show Qubool Hai. Haider is a mature and charming man who brings in a lot of ambiguity in the equation that Zoya shares with the Siddiqui family.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2007 Delhi Heights Vicky Supporting Role 2012 Family Aa Rahi Hai Unknown Main Role\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYear Show Channel Role 2008 – 2010 Miley Jab Hum Tum STAR One Samrat Shergill 2010 Zara Nachke Dhikhana (Season 2) STAR Plus Himself (Host) 2012 - 2013 Mujhse Kuchh Kehti...
