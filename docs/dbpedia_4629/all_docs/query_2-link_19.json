        "text": "Indian actress and screenwriter\n\nHoney Irani is an Indian actress and screenwriter, who works in Hindi cinema. She started her career as a child actor with roles in films such as Mahesh Kaulâ€™s Pyar ki Pyas. She was probably four to five years old when the shooting of the movies Chirag Kahan Roshni Kahan and Bombay Ka Chor started.\n\nBackground and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHoney Irani is the youngest of five siblings, the others being Menaka, Bunny, Sarosh, and Daisy Irani. Irani's oldest sister, Menaka, is married to the stunt film-maker Kamran Khan.[1] Her other sister Daisy, who was also a famous child-star like herself,[2] is the widow of screenwriter K.K. Shukla, and is the mother of three children.\n\nIrani met the script-writer and poet Javed Akhtar on the sets of Seeta Aur Geeta. They were married on 21 March 1972. She is the mother of film-makers Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar. Zoya was born on 14 October 1972, when her career as a child star had already ended and Javed's career as a script-writer had not yet properly begun. They had no place to live, and were given a room in the house of Irani's sister Menaka. Their son Farhan Akhtar was born in 1974. Irani became a devoted home-maker, but the marriage ended in divorce after her husband became involved with the actress Shabana Azmi in the mid-1970s.[3] The couple separated in 1978 and divorced in 1985. While Akhtar married Azmi in 1984, Irani devoted herself to the care of her two young children, who were six years and four years old respectively in 1978. She started doing embroidery on sarees as a way of earning money to support her children. Eventually, she managed to make a second career for herself as a writer of film scripts. Both of Irani's children grew up to be successful filmmakers in the Hindi film industry.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHoney Irani began her Bollywood career as a child actress with roles in films such as Chirag Kahan Roshni Kahan and Bombay Ka Chor. She has acted in over 72 films.\n\nAfter her divorce, she started doing embroidery on sarees to support her family. Though she had been writing short stories all this while, she never shared them. She narrated the story idea of Aaina (1993) to Pam Chopra, wife of Yash Chopra for a TV series, but he developed it into a film. Yash had also previously asked her to develop a story idea, which went on to become her debut as a screenwriter, Lamhe (1991), starring Sridevi. The film saw mediocre success, but she won the Filmfare Award for Best Story for the film and it paved her way for a successful career as screenwriter. Both Aaina and Lamhe strengthened her bond with Yash who gave her his next film Darr (1993). However she parted ways with him after she was not given credit for her work on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. She won the award again for Kya Kehna in 2002, besides winning Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay with Ravi Kapoor for the blockbuster Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai in 2001.[3]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Award Category Result 1992 Lamhe Filmfare Award Filmfare Award for Best Story Won 2001 Kya Kehna Filmfare Award Filmfare Award for Best Story Won Kaho Naa...
