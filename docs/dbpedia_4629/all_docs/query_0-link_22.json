Initially, it focused on cousins Gopi and Rashi and their life in Modi Mansion after marrying Modis' sons Ahem and Jigar, respectively. After a leap, the series focused on Gopi's daughters, Meera and Vidya. Further leap focused on Ramakanth, Gopi's son and Sita.[7] The storyline constantly skips forward in time: a year in June 2013,[8] eight years in February 2014,[9] ten years in February 2015,[10] four years in May 2016,[11] and three months in March 2017. The series ended on 23 July 2017, completing 2,181 episodes.[12][13]\n\nThe second season of the series, Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 2, premiered on 19 October 2020 on Star Plus starring cameo celebrities Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Rupal Patel, Mohammad Nazim, as well as Sneha Jain and Harsh Nagar (later replaced by Gautam Singh Vig) as protagonists.[14]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nGopi is an orphan who lives with her aunt Urmila Shah, uncle Jeetu Shah, and cousin Rashi. Kokila Modi decides to get her son Ahem Modi married to Gopi. Urmila and Rashi plot to get Rashi married to Jigar. Soon Ahem-Gopi and Jigar-Rashi get married. Kokila trains and supports Gopi to become self-confident and educated. Ahem's sister Kinjal is married to Urmila's nephew, Dhaval Desai. Rashi often tries to create trouble for Gopi but later regrets, while Ahem, who initially berates Gopi for her illiteracy, later realizes her worth, and rejects his girlfriend, Anita. Soon, Gopi has a daughter, Meera, while Rashi has twin sons, Sahir and Samar. Gopi's long-lost parents, Madhu and Jayantilal reunite with Gopi's sister Radha. Radha marries Kinjal's ex-boyfriend, Umang Mehta, whose first wife Tripti murders him. Tripti blames Gopi for Umang's death which Radha believes. However, Kokila works together with Gopi and Rashi to find out the truth and later reveals Umang and Tripti's intentions to Radha, thus, sentencing Tripti to eight years of imprisonment. Gopi finds out she is pregnant again. Yet again, Tripti brainwashes Radha against Gopi. When the family is out for a picnic, Radha schemes an accident to kill Meera which results in Gopi accidentally slipping and throwing baby Meera in the river. Kokila holds Gopi responsible for Meera's death and a guilty Gopi leaves the Modi house.\n\n8 years later\n\n[edit]\n\nGopi raises her second daughter, Vidya, single-handedly. Kokila decides to get Ahem married to Radha. On the day of the marriage, Rashi finds Gopi and with the help of Samar, Sahir, Pappu, and Vidya, they make a plan to remarry Ahem and Gopi and are successful in doing so. Gopi reveals to the family that Vidya is their daughter. Kokila finds out that Meera is alive and was ill-treated by Radha and made to grow up as an orphan in a temple. Kokila decides to expose them but Tripti causes her accident which leads to her losing her partial memory. Gopi and Ahem bring a girl Gauri to the house who turns out to be Meera. Kokila regains her memory and the whole family is reunited after Radha's crimes are revealed, and she is sent to jail along with Tripti for trying to kill her and Meera.\n\nRashi's maternal cousin, Paridhi, enters the Modi house. Rashi sacrifices her life to save Gopi from the latter's obsessed colleague, Anurag Joshi. Jigar goes into depression due to Rashi's demise. He marries Paridhi after being forced by his family. Radha returns and tricks Jigar into sleeping with her and gets pregnant. She delivers a daughter who is named after Rashi and threatens the Modis to kill her. Realizing that Radha will never reform, Gopi stabs her with a trishul repeatedly to save Rashi, killing her. She is then sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.\n\n10 years later\n\n[edit]\n\nGopi is released from jail after a reduction of 4 years in her sentence and is shocked to learn that Kokila does not live in the Modi house anymore and is a maid at a fakely-mentally-ill Urmila's house. Paridhi refuses to foster Rashi and does not let her stay at the Modi House. Ahem has broken all ties with the Modis and lives with Meera, Vidya, and a woman, Mansi Raheja (caretaker of Meera and Vidya) in Bandra, Mumbai. He runs a bakery shop called MV (after Meera-Vidya). Kinjal separates from Dhaval and lives at Modi's house after an argument which causes Urmila's fake memory loss. Gopi's mother Madhu escapes after failing to take Rashi Jr. with her.\n\nGopi, Jigar, and Kokila travel to Mumbai to bring back Ahem and Meera-Vidya. After many failed attempts, they finally reunite the family. Vidya's marriage is fixed with Shravan, whose grandmother, Gaura, is Kokila's childhood friend. Gaura, who wants revenge on Kokila for her brother's death, secretly gets Meera married to her son, Dharam. Madhu returns with her adopted daughter, Sona, seeking revenge against the Modis for Radha's death. While trying to stab Kokila, Madhu accidentally stabs Gopi. Guilt-ridden after getting slapped by Sona, she runs away and jumps into a lake and suicide. Gopi survives and Sahir marries Sona, which is not accepted by Paridhi. Dharam and Meera gradually fall in love and they get remarried. But their happiness is short-lived as Ahem dies due to a car accident.\n\n4 years later\n\n[edit]\n\nGopi has been in depression since Ahem's demise and has not talked in years. Paridhi has thrown Sahir and Sona out of the Modi mansion and got Samar married to a rich girl named Monica. Baa, Chirag, Hetal, and Parag have moved to America for Baa's treatment. While Dhaval, Kinjal, and Pappu have moved to London. Vidya has a 4-year-old daughter with Shravan, Priyal. Kokila fixes Gopi's marriage with her therapist and doctor, Krishna Raheja, who turns out to be Mansi's brother and wants to take revenge on Gopi for separating Mansi and Ahem. Soon, Gopi and Kokila meet Ahem's look-alike, Jaggi, and request him to save Gopi from Krishna's evil plans. Later, it is revealed that Jaggi is Parag and Urvashi's illegitimate son.\n\nGopi learns from her friend, Antara, who is on her deathbed, that she gave birth to a son, and that Vidya is not Gopi's daughter. Antara had cheated on Gopi by swapping her daughter with Gopi’s son. Gopi's long-lost son, Ramakant, has now grown into a spoiled and selfish young man. Gopi and Jaggi bring Ramakant to live with Modis. Later, the Modis arrange his marriage to Sita. Ramakant reforms and marries Sita.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nGiaa Manek as Gopi Kapadia Modi – Jayantilal and Madhu's elder daughter; Radha’s sister; Rashi’s cousin; Ahem's widow; Jaggi's wife; Meera and Ramakant's mother; Vidya’s adoptive mother; Medha and Jr. Ahem’s grandmother; Priyal's adoptive grandmother (2010–2012)\n\nDevoleena Bhattacharjee replaced Manek as Gopi Jaggi Modi (2012–2017)\n\nRucha Hasabnis Jagdale as Rashi Shah Modi – Jitu and Urmila's daughter; Gopi, Radha, Dhaval and Paridhi's cousin; Jigar's first wife; Sahir and Samar's mother; Jai, Veeru, Geeta and Jr. Sita's grandmother (2010–2014)\n\nRupal Patel as Kokila Desai Modi – Revati's elder daughter; Praful, Jigna and Paresh's sister; Parag's wife; Ahem and Kinjal's mother; Jaggi's step-mother; Meera, Ramakant and Prateek's grandmother; Vidya's adoptive grandmother; Medha and Jr. Ahem's great-grandmother; Priyal's adoptive great-grandmother (2010–2017)\n\nMohammad Nazim as\n\nAhem Modi – Kokila and Parag's son; Kinjal's brother; Jaggi's half-brother; Jigar's cousin; Gopi's first husband; Meera and Ramakant's father; Vidya’s adoptive father; Medha and Jr. Ahem’s grandfather; Priyal’s adoptive grandfather (2010–2016)\n\nBharath ;Ahem and Jaggi's lookelike (fake)/(2016)/(dead)\n\nJaggi Modi – Parag and Urvashi's son; Kokila's step-son; Ahem and Kinjal's half-brother; Jigar's cousin; Gopi's second husband; chachu of Meera, Vidya and Ramakant; Priyal's adoptive step-grandfather; Medha and Jr. Ahem's step-grandfather (2016–2017)\n\nVishal Singh as Jigar Modi – Hetal and Chirag's son; Ahem, Jaggi and Kinjal's cousin; Rashi and Radha's widower; Paridhi's husband; Sahir, Samar and Jr. Rashi's father; Jai, Veeru, Geeta and Jr. Sita's grandfather (2010–2016)\n\nLoveleen Kaur Sasan as Paridhi Mehta Modi – Jay and Veena's daughter; Rashi and Dhaval's cousin; Jigar's second wife; Sahir, Samar and Jr. Rashi's step-mother; Jai, Veeru, Geeta and Jr. Sita's step-grandmother (2014–2017)\n\nTanya Sharma as Meera Modi Suryavanshi – Gopi and Ahem's daughter; Jaggi's step-daughter; Ramakant's sister; Vidya's adoptive sister.

Members of CINTAA had meetings with Manek and asked her to quit the reality show. Manek declined and Star replaced her with Devoleena Bhattacharjee.[17]\n\nIn January 2014, Rucha Hasabnis playing Rashi confirmed that she planned to quit the series any time in that year.[18] However, she decided to quit acting and left with her character being killed.[19]\n\nIn September 2015, Lovey Sasan playing Paridhi quit the series as she did not want to play the role of a mother.[20] However, after sometime when the makers approached her, she agreed and returned in March 2016.[21]\n\nIn May 2016, Mohammed Nazim as Ahem quit the show because of one member of the production crew stating:[22]\n\n\"Since the existing key actors aired their reservations about playing grandparents, the creatives had no option but to put the time leap on hold. Something drastic needed to be done to liven up the storyline.
