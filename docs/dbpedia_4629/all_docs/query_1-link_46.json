No other physical descriptions of the suspects have been provided.\n\nEyewitness\n\nWhen Wactor was shot she was with a female co-worker. His brother, Grant, shared that Johnny did not provoke the attackers. He said, “He did not confront them and did not try to stop them. He was just trying to diffuse the situation by stepping back.” Grant added that the suspects were not expecting anyone to approach them, which scared them. “And there’s nothing more dangerous than a coward with a gun in his hand,”\n\nLAPD asked for Public Help\n\nAs per the reports, The LAPD is now asking the public to help them find the killers. They have urged anyone with information to contact the department’s Central Bureau Homicide division or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.\n\nThere is no doubt that the situation is tragic and unsettling.
