She was brought up by Thakurain Mala, and has consistent nightmares about her parents' deaths. The corrupt Raja Tejawat arranges Paro's wedding with Varun who plans to smuggle weapons across the border during the wedding procession. The procession is disrupted by BSD officers led by Deputy Commandant Rudra Pratap Ranawat and Varun is killed.\n\nAn oblivious Parvati blames Rudra for her husband's death. Rudra suspects that she is a material witness and hopes that she will testify. To prevent this, Tejawat hires goons to murder her. Rudra relocates her to his paternal home but when his malicious aunt Mohini insults Parvati's virtue, Rudra's father covers for them and announces she is Rudra's fiance. Eventually, Parvati emotionally sympathizes with Rudra after learning that his mother eloped with another man, unaware that his mother is the Thakurain. On the day of her wedding to Rudra, Parvati chooses to trust Tejawat and flees with him only to discover the truth behind her marriage to Varun. Upon realizing her mistake, she also becomes aware of her love for Rudra and returns to him.\n\nParvati tries her best to win over Rudra but in vain. He is accused of domestic violence and loses his job after which in a drunken state, he marries Paro. Rudra is reinstated and initially rejects Paro for betraying him but recognizes that he loves her. The couple go through: Rudra recovering from paralysis of his right arm, the interruptions of his ex-girlfriend Laila and their mutual hesitation to confess their love for each other. They eventually unite and confess their feelings.\n\nThakurain Mala and Rudra meet again but Rudra has pure hatred towards her. Paro tries hard to unite mother and son and is eventually successful. Touched by his efforts to forgive his mother for her, Paro and Rudra finally consummate their marriage. The family is happy till Rudra receives an anonymous call saying that Paro will be killed. For safety, the family relocates. Varun's younger brother, Shanthanu Kumar enters their house as a bodyguard seeking revenge. Parvati finds out and Rudra comes in time to save her. Shanthanu gets arrested. Later on, Parvati becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy that the couple name Dhruv. Their happiness ends abruptly when Shanthanu escapes from prison and murders Parvati who dies in Rudra's arms. Shantanu is killed by Rudra.\n\nRudra lives with his now seven-year-old son, Dhruv and his family. Having quit the BSD, his new assignment is being the bodyguard of Myrah Mehra. Myrah, who is identical in appearance to Parvati, is an NRI and has arrived from the US to pick a venue for her wedding to Rohit Sehgal. Rudra tries to keep his distance from her, in the process becoming hostile. While she is in Rudra's house, Myrah unknowingly falls in love with Rudra and they become friendly. When he rescues her from kidnappers, he recalls how he failed to save Parvati. Under the influence of pain medication Myrah kisses Rudra, who reciprocates, thinking she is Paro, but catches himself just in time.\n\nWhile Myrah starts to accept her feelings for him, he expresses his frustration over her resemblance to his late wife. Heartbroken, she decides to leave Rudra's life but her fiancé arrives, inspiring jealousy in Rudra. After Myrah helps Maithlee and Samrat adopt a baby, Rudra develops a liking for her. Rudra refuses to confess that he loves Myrah but has a conversation with Paro in a dream where she tells him to move on and be happy. She assures him that she has sent Myrah for him and Dhruv. In a drunken state, Rudra confesses his love to Myrah. She is confused about her feelings for him and chooses to marry Rohit. Rudra writes a letter in which he apologizes for being unable to attend her wedding because he cannot bear the loss. Myrah sends a video that explains her love for Rudra to Rohit, who asks Myrah to pursue it. The show ends with Rudra and Myrah confessing their love and the whole family celebrating.\n\nAshish Sharma as Deputy Commandant Rudra Pratap Ranawat: Idealistic Border Security Force Officer; Mala and Dilsher's son; Samrat, Sumer and Sunehri's cousin; Parvati's husband ; Myrah's love interest; Dhruv's father[7]\n\nSanaya Irani as\n\nParvati \"Paro\" Chauhan Ranawat: Mala's foster daughter; Varun's ex-wife; Rudra's wife; Dhruv's mother\n\nMyrah Mehra: Parvati's lookalike; Rudra's love interest [8]\n\nRishi Sonecha / Kapish Chawla as Dhruv Pratap Ranawat: Parvati and Rudra's son[9]\n\nPrashant Chawla as Samrat Pratap Ranawat: Mohini and Danveer's elder son; Sumer and Sunehri's brother; Rudra's cousin; Maithili's husband.\n\nGeetanjali Mishra as Maithili Ranawat: Samrat's wife.\n\nKali Prasad Mukherjee as Dilsher Pratap Ranawat: Danveer's brother; Mala's husband; Rudra's father; Dhruv's grandfather\n\nSadiya Siddiqui as Mala Ranawat: Dilsher's wife; Rudra's mother; Parvati's foster mother; Dhruv's grandmother\n\nSanjiv Jotangia as Danveer Pratap Ranawat: Dilsher's brother; Mohini's husband; Samrat, Sumer and Sunehri's father\n\nAnanya Khare as Mohini Ranawat: Danveer's wife; Samrat, Sumer and Sunehri's mother[10]\n\nUdit Shukla as Samay \"Sumer\" Pratap Ranawat: Mohini and Danveer's younger son; Samrat and Sunehri's brother; Rudra's cousin; Shatabdi's husband\n\nManasvi Vyas as Shatabdi Ranawat: Sumer's wife[11]\n\nKhushbu Thakkar as Sunehri Ranawat: Mohini and Danveer's daughter; Samrat and Sumer's sister; Rudra's cousin\n\nTarun Khanna as Tagor Param Singh Tejawat: Corrupt smuggler\n\nVishal Gandhi as Varun Agnihotri: Shantanu's brother; Parvati's ex-husband\n\nUnknown as Shantanu Agnihotri: Varun's brother; Parvati's murderer\n\nPadam Bhola as Aman Deep Singh: Rudra's fellow officer at Border Security Defense\n\nSyed Zafar Ali as General Vaman Kumar \"VK\" Singh: Rudra's superior officer at the Border Security Defense\n\nNeha Narang as Bindiya \"Bindi\" Parekh: Parvati's friend\n\nVishal Karwal as Shantanu Kumar Agnihotri: Varun's brother[11][12]\n\nAnkita Mayank Sharma as Kajal \"Laila\" Suri: Dancer; Rudra's former companion[13][14]\n\nGurpreet Singh as Rohit Sehgal: Myrah's ex-fiancé\n\nPearl V Puri as Samir\n\nToral Rasputra as Anandi from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nSidharth Shukla as Shiv from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nShashank Vyas as Jagdish from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nSargun Mehta as Ganga from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nAnup Soni as Bhairon from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nSmita Bansal as Sumitra from \"Balika Vadhu\"\n\nHarshad Arora as Zain Abdullah from \"Beintehaa\"\n\nPreetika Rao as Aaliya Zain Abdullah from \"Beintehaa\"\n\nMrunal Jain as Akash from \"Uttaran\"\n\nTina Datta as Meethi from \"Uttaran\"\n\nDheeraj Dhoopar as Prem from \"Sasural Simar Ka\"\n\nDipika Kakar as Simar from \"Sasural Simar Ka\"\n\nManish Raisinghan as Siddhant from \"Sasural Simar Ka\"\n\nAvika Gor as Roli from \"Sasural Simar Ka\"\n\nFalaq Naaz as Jhanvi from \"Sasural Simar Ka\"\n\nShakti Arora as Ranveer from \"Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi\"\n\nRadhika Madan as Ishani from \"Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi\"\n\nEmraan Hashmi from \"Raja Natwarlal\"\n\nSidharth Malhotra from \"Ek Villain\"\n\nShraddha Kapoor from \"Ek Villain\"\n\nRiteish Deshmukh from \"Ek Villain\"\n\nThe show was shot extensively across arid terrains of Jaisalmer and dunes of Jodhpur.
