The Victoria Memorial, located in Kolkata, India is a memorial of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom who also carried the title of Empress of India. It currently serves as a museum and a tourist attraction.

The memorial was designed by Sir William Emerson in an architectural style similar to Belfast City Hall. Built between 1906 and 1921, it is a majestic white marble building at the southern end of the Maidan (Kolkata's biggest ground with lash green grass) and surrounded by a sprawling garden. A black bronze Angel of Victory, holding a bugle in her hand was placed at the apex of the dome above the Memorial. It is fixed to its pedestal with ball bearings and acts as a weathercock when the wind is strong enough. Mr. A. C. Mitra, Bengal Engineering and Science University-alumnus, was Engineer-in-Charge in the construction project of the Victoria.
