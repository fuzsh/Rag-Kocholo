This stunning marble edifice, known officially as the Victoria Memorial Hall, is more than just a historical monument; it is a symbol of the rich cultural heritage and history that Kolkata boasts.\n\nA Brief History of the Victoria Memorial\n\nThe Victoria Memorial was conceived by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, to honour Queen Victoria after her death in 1901. The foundation stone was laid in 1906, and the construction was completed in 1921.
