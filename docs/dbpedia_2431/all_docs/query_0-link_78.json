        "text": "Kolkata to me has a charm that is both special and sublime.\n\nKolkata brings about images that are hard to describe – but which are easily understood by all who know and love the city.\n\nRevisiting Kolkata amazes me every time to find how the city still retains its tradition and cultural heritage amidst rapid urbanization.\n\nA vast expanse of green in the heart of the city that still remains today as fundamental to Kolkata as Central Park is to New York City. Its the MAIDAN. Since its development, the Maidan has been an army property and continues to be so. Surrounded by a host of renowned structures, one of them on the south side is the Victoria Memorial, one of the most significant architectural marvels of British Raj that stands in all its beauty and finesse. (Kolkata, West Bengal, India).\n\nKolkata is a city of wonders, be it the breathtaking buildings and marvelous monuments that adorn it or the natural treasures it is blessed with. We, as Kolkatans, have come to accept them as part of our being. Yet, they never cease to surprise us or visitors who can’t help but be amazed at our landmarks.\n\nStanding at the base of the steps of this beautiful monument, the enormity of the heritage building will take your breath away. You will find the answer why this memorial took so long to build — it was opened on December 28, 1921, by King Edward VIII.\n\nAs the white chequered marble glistened in the sun, I felt like royalty walking under the huge arch adorned with Italian figurines.\n\nThere is a black bronze statue on the apex of the dome of the Victoria Memorial. This statue means the “Angel of Victory”. This angel of victory acts as a weathercock when the wind is strong enough.\n\nThe forms in the museum like the great dome, clustered with four subsidiary, octagonal domed chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the domed corner towers speak of a splendid richness in architecture.\n\nWe know that Lord Curzon commissioned the Victoria Memorial and Sir William Emerson, who made Crawford market in Mumbai. designed it but the actual building was done by Calcutta-based firm Martin & Co. It was the partnership between Sir Thomas Aquinas Martin and Bengali Sir Rajen Mookherjee. The Victoria Memorial is what got Sir Rajen his knighthood.\n\nThe gardens cover an area of 64 acres and are maintained by a team of 21 gardeners.\n\nBefore the Victoria Memorial was erected, the location housed Presidency Jail, which was later demolished from there and relocated to Alipore, to construct the memorial.\n\nVoluntary Funds came from Princes and people of India in response to Curzon’s appeal.\n\nThis huge white-marble museum, made from Makrana marbles from Rajasthan, is filled with a vast collection of remnants from the period of British Empire rule in India.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial has 25 galleries, which include the Royal gallery, the National Leaders gallery, the Portrait gallery, Central hall, the Sculpture gallery, the Arms and Armory gallery and the newer, Calcutta gallery.\n\nOn way to the North Gate is a bronze statue of Queen Victoria. The queen is seated on her throne wearing the robes of the Star of India, Approaching the building from the south, you will pass the King Edward VII memorial arch with a bronze equestrian statue of the King and a marble statue of Lord Curzon. There are other statues of various dignitaries like Lord Bentinct, Lord Ripon and Sir Rajendranath Mookherjee, the pioneer industrialist of Bengal.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, Kolkata enjoyed the privilege of being the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, by the Portuguese and French.\n\nThe monument is a blend of an Indian, British, Mughal and Egyptian artery.\n\nThe Times Of India newspaper had invited readers to send suggestions on what they thought were the top wonders of Kolkata. The passionate response was on putting none other than Victoria Memorial and Howrah Bridge to the top of the grand list.\n\nEven today, the memorial is one of the most recognizable structures in the city. People often compare Victoria Memorial to the Taj Mahal for their overall appearance and extravagant use of shiny, white marbles from the same quarries in Makrana.\n\nSome of the similarities of the two buildings are definitely striking in their great domes, high portals, terraces, and dome-corner towers, including the purpose for which they were constructed. Emerson, however, claimed that he did not intend to replicate the Taj Mahal but was simply echoing Mughal architecture in his work.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is possibly the most awesome reminder of the Raj to be found in entire India!!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
