        "text": "Back to Kolkata\n\nBack To The History Of India\n\nSome interesting facts\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is a magnificent marble monument dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901). It was built between 1906 and 1921. It is and is now a museum and tourist destination. The Prince of Wales, later King George V, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906 and it was formally opened to the public in 1921. The Victoria Memorial’s architect was William Emerson. The total cost of construction of this monument amounting to one crore, five lakhs of rupees, was entirely derived from voluntary subscriptions.\n\nIn January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria, George Curzon, Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial.\n\n“Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history, and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past.”\n\nArchitecture and Decorative features\n\nThere is a close reminiscence with the Taj. Like the Taj, the theme of this architecture is symmetry. Like the Taj, this is a memorial to an empress. Like the Taj, it is constructed of white Makrana marble. It is surrounded by a small lake that runs around all sides.\n\nSuccession and uniformity are two most important ideas behind any great European monuments. A great monument consists in an uniform succession of great parts: When you stand in front of the Victoria Memorial and say, look on either side of the main arch, you see a number of very similar “units” demarcated by wide As your eyes moves, the succession of these very similar ornamental units keeps reinforcing the image of these units, each in its order as it succeeds, as a result of which our eyes present the mind with a grand or sublime conception of the monument in front (See Ref 2.).\n\nSo, succession of “uniform” parts are what constitute the artificial infinite. Uniformity is the characteristic where the parts are absolutely similar, there are no variations. This characteristic alone can stamp on bounded objects the character of vastness or infinity. You use the use of both these properties in the architecture of the Victoria Memorial that makes its facade massive yet it matches perfectly with its height to present a sublime look from the front.\n\nThe other important European design principle on buildings is: “There is nothing more prejudicial to the grandeur of buildings than to abound in angles; a fault obvious in many; and owing to an inordinate thirst for variety, which, whenever it prevails, is sure to leave very little true taste.” The grand appearance of this monument is rectangular in form with a range of uniform massive windows and columns on every side.\n\nThe color of the ornaments\n\nThe color of all metallic ornaments — the statue of Queen Victoria, that of Edward VII, the angel, and other inlaid works are all of dark color, mostly black. This follows this European principle: In buildings, when the highest degree of the sublime is intended, the materials and ornaments ought neither to be white, nor green, nor yellow, nor blue, nor of a pale red, nor violet, nor spotted, but of sad and fuscous colors, as black, or brown, or deep purple, and the like.\n\nThe color of all stone ornaments like the statues, the fairies etc are white.\n\nIn design, it echos the Taj Mahal with its its huge and magnificent dome at the center and four large chattris anchoring the four corners of the main structure. The dome is also surrounded by four small chattris. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning. At the entrance is the huge arch on top of which is the Royal Coat Of Arms. You see the majestic monument with a unique blend of beauty, strength and solidity, while the Taj has got sublime beauty.\n\nThe height of the monument is 269 ft. Atop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft figure of the Angel of Victory. It is made of bronze, weighs 3 tons and revolves on its axis driven by the wind.\n\nNote:\n\nThe exterior of St Peters Basilica is surrounded by a giant order of pilasters supporting a continuous cornice. Four small cupolas cluster around the main dome, much like Victoria Memorial.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo#/media/File:Ortographia_Partis_Exterioris_Templi_Divi_Petri_in_Vaticano.jpg\n\nAs said above, Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures, prominent among them above the North Porch is Motherhood shown below.\n\nThe main entrance is from the North side. The grand Victorian gate with Royal Coat Of Arms stands on rectangular granite tiles. The area behind the gate leading to the main structure is covered with yellow cobblestones.\n\nOn the Main entrance, the main attraction is the magnificent bronze statue of Victoria by George Frampton. Raised on a high marble platform, Victoria is seated on her throne. She is wearing the robes of the Star of India.\n\nAnd a closer view:\n\nThe magnificent narrative panels inlaid with bronze sculpture by John Gascombe at the base of the statue:\n\nThe South Side\n\nApproaching the Victoria Memorial building from the south, visitors pass the Edward VII memorial arch. Upon the arch is a bronze equestrian statue of Edward VII by Bertram Mackennal and, a marble statue of Curzon by Frederic William Pomeroy.\n\nAnd a closer view\n\nAs you walk towards the main structure along the cobbled walkway, you see the beautiful, lush green garden leading all the way to the boundary of the structure.\n\nThe cobbled walk meets a circular garden within which is a white marble statue of a member of the Royal family.\n\nThe white statue and behind it is the magnificent monument, from the south side.\n\nThe facade on the East side: The colonnade of Corinthian columns in the front. The main dome with small chhatris and two large decorative chhatris on the end.\n\nVictoria Memorial is frequented by people from widely different streams. They might range from pilgrims of Haridwar to professionals of Wall Street. They all tend to wear bright orange clothing on summer days to blend well with white marble in the backdrop.\n\nAnd the lake around the main structure\n\nAnd the water in the lake:\n\nYou become quiet and pensive as the hour slowly passes and it is time to leave. As we came out of the main gate, we saw the yellow taxis and other vehicles parked along the Maidan. A tinge of sadness crept in. Lot of memories of growing up in the city of my birth. But you have to leave. You family are not from that city, for them it is a nice place. People of Calcutta don’t go there every year. During my growing up, I probably went there twice. Only once did I enter inside this majestic monument.\n\nA melancholy lesson of staying abroad for most of your life is the realization that you can’t come here as you wish. Perhaps only those people that are from Calcutta but now live far away, those who could have gone there every day while growing up but didn’t, this unique, deep sadness is reserved for. For everybody else, it is a different feeling."
