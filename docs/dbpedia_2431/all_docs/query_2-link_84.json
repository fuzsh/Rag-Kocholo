It was originally built in 1862 as a Town Hall that served the dual purpose of providing space for a theatre as well as offices and meeting rooms. In January 1901, following the death of Queen Victoria, it was decided that a Memorial Hall should be built in her honour. By 1902, the architectural firm Swan and Maclaren had designed a new theatre that was integrated into the existing structure. Known as the Victoria Memorial Hall, the completed building reflected a blend of Classical and Renaissance architecture which was adapted to suit the tropical climate of Singapore. A central clock tower was incorporated into the building in 1906. In 1979, Victoria Memorial Hall was renamed Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall.</p>",
