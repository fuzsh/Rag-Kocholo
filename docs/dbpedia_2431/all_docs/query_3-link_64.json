        "text": "Outside Buckingham Palace, Thomas Brock’s statue of a mature, substantial, and dignified Queen Victoria looks down the Mall, the centrepiece of the national Victoria Memorial (Fig. 1). Five thousand miles away, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), another statue of Victoria by Brock, this time of the youthful Queen in her coronation robes, stands at the heart of the shimmering and bombastic Victoria Memorial Hall, built as the All India commemoration of the Queen-Empress (Fig. 2). Both statues now spend most of their days being passed by thousands of tourists (the Victoria Memorial Hall museum and gardens attract around 3.5 million visitors a year and it claims to be the most visited museum in India).1 In their original conception though, both statues were part of schemes that situate Victoria as the maternal heart of the British Empire. She is made to carry the ideological weight of being the charismatic focal point of British rule. From Calcutta to Cape Town, Victoria’s motherly concern for all of her subjects was used to emphasize the existence of an imperial family and to soften the imposition of British rule. In his work on Queen Victoria and India, Miles Taylor describes the second half of the century as ‘the heyday of viceregal rule; that is to say, a system of government in which the apparatus of European monarchy was applied to remote colonies and dependencies’.2 David Cannadine has likewise noted that, to the degree there was a coherent imperial project, ‘it was the effort to fashion and to tie together the empire abroad in the vernacular image of the domestic, ranked social hierarchy.’3 Both memorial schemes foreground Victoria as a familial and familiar presence, an important part of the way that British Empire modelled itself at home and abroad.\n\n22 January 1901: Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. It was the worst of times, it was the best of times. The Queen who had reigned for over sixty-three years was dead, but her achievements (and those of the Victorian age) would continue. The question soon turned to how best to commemorate her. Hundreds of memorial schemes were launched across Britain and the empire, but this article analyses the two largest national schemes, whose outcomes still dominate Calcutta and London.4 It argues that these schemes’ insistent imperial myth-making reveals some of the broader instabilities and dynamics in fashioning Victoria. Both schemes are notable for their scale, such that Brock’s statues form only a small component. Such supplemental architectonics typify the way Victoria was appropriated into a grand imperial vision. And this brings into focus Victoria’s own agency or lack of it in her fashioning. Memorial schemes sought to honour her, to be ‘representative’ of her, but what did this mean? Schemes were also invariably ‘representative’ of the group or communities directing them. Moreover, Victoria’s commemoration was complicated by her unique reign and character. Would the most suitable memorial be practical and philanthropic? Or would some monumental scheme — typically used to commemorate great men — better reflect her place in the affective lives of her subjects? To be sure, these questions were common for memorial projects of the period; however, these two national memorial schemes demonstrate the way her legacy was shaped by an imperial overdetermination.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace sought to renovate that area of London into a grand imperial theatre — the scheme encompassed Brock’s statuary group, the architectural remodelling of the surrounding area, the creation of a grand processional road down the Mall, and the refronting of the drab and uninspiring Buckingham Palace. Imperial symbolism runs through Brock’s design, celebrating Victoria atop a seafaring island empire founded on a maritime supremacy that began in Elizabethan times. One of the most affecting parts of her funeral was the sea journey that took her cortège from Cowes to Portsmouth, with minute guns being fired by the attendant naval fleet. The hagiography around Sir Francis Drake, the Armada, and English sea power was at its height in these decades, as exemplified by the 1888 tercentenary celebrations; poems such as Henry Newbolt’s ‘Drake’s Drum’ (1896) and Alfred Noyes’s epic ‘Drake’ (1906–08); and histories such as J. A. Froude’s English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century (1895).5 The national memorial scheme was equally influenced by ideas of ‘Greater Britain’ and imperial federation with the settler colonies of Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand.6 On 10 June 1901 Joseph Chamberlain, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, sent a circular to the dominions and colonial governments inviting subscriptions. At the 1902 Colonial Conference in London, attendees agreed to contribute to the cost of the memorial; they eventually donated £115,295, nearly a third of the overall cost.7 Settler colonies contributed the bulk of this with £30,000 from Canada, £10,000 from Natal, £20,000 from Cape Colony, and £20,000 from Australia. Smaller sums were given by the Transvaal (£1000), Gambia, and Jamaica (£500). Tori Smith has rightly argued that the extent of their contribution is not fully recognized in the completed scheme, attenuated by cost and the more than two decades it took to complete.8 Nonetheless, the initial plans — both the chosen design and those which were unsuccessful — exemplify a high point in the desire to create an imperial urban space for a British audience.\n\nThere was one obvious absence from the colonial contributors to the London Victoria Memorial. Lord Curzon and Indian maharajahs and communities politely but firmly declined to contribute to a scheme that was thousands of miles away. The gleaming white marble of the Victoria Memorial Hall (Fig. 3), the brainchild of the viceroy, Lord Curzon, seemingly embodies the self-confidence of the British Raj. However, this should not efface the turbulence that afflicted the scheme.9 It should also not be taken as shorthand for the overall commemoration of Victoria in India, marginalizing the way that her legacy was curated and contested. The Victoria Memorial Hall was the exception rather than the rule; its colonial triumphalism has cast into the shade the many regional, district, and local memorial schemes that — contrary to the wishes of British provincial governors and elites — sought to avoid Curzon’s high-handed scheme as well as colonial statuary and everything it stood for. Instead, Indian communities aligned Victoria with a wealth of educational, philanthropic, and welfare initiatives. The question is perhaps not why there were so many statues of Victoria in India but rather why there were so few, considering the size of the country and its status. Given recent debates about colonial-era statues and their continued political resonance, perhaps the most effective opposition is to make sure that they are never erected in the first place. Queen Victoria’s statue in Bombay (now Mumbai) — the first erected in India after the rebellion of 1857 — had already been subject to an attack. In 1895 it was covered with a large bucket of tar and had a pair of old sandals draped around her neck (showing the sole of your shoe being a particularly disrespectful insult).10 Propelled by the emergence of Indian nationalism, the political frictions around Victoria’s commemoration in 1901 demonstrate that her legacy was already contested, long before postcolonial debates in the aftermath of independence.\n\nThere were two key fault lines in the commemoration of Victoria in India, which foreground the question of who Victoria belonged to, and of the competing agency between colonial elites and local populations in her curation. The first fault line was that between Curzon’s plan for an All India memorial in Calcutta and the desire by regions and cities to have their own local memorials. The second was the choice of memorial itself, whether to commemorate through a statue or some other monument, or through a philanthropic scheme that would, arguably, create more tangible benefits. These were not unprecedented tensions in that, as Taylor notes, ‘the memorials of 1887 and ten years later tell us more about civic patriotism than they do about an unqualified loyalty to Britain’ (p. 233). However, in both fault lines, Indian communities generally favoured the latter, the British Raj the former. Victoria’s memorialization was fashioned through the complex and conflicting interplay of colonial ideology and local politics. As Maria Nugent and Sarah Carter have argued in their work on indigenous communities and Queen Victoria, ‘symbolic vocabularies and vernaculars of monarchy, empire, sovereignty, and the Crown (among other things) were produced — or at the very least co-produced — by colonised communities and constituencies.’11 While the Victoria Memorial Hall was a top-down effort led by Curzon, Victoria’s broader commemoration in India is an example of a more complex co-production of her figure.\n\nNotes"
