        "text": "Queen Victoria Memorial\n\nThe Mall, London SW1.\n\nThis is the second part of my definitive guide to the Queen Victoria Memorial and to the Albert Memorial. Married in life, separated by death and each the recipient of a grand, excessive and elaborately detailed London memorial. Victoria and Albert were a pair in life and are now adversaries in a face-off to see which of them has the most overblown and extravagant memorial in London. Queen Victoria died almost 40 years after Albert and her memorial is thirty five years newer. Victoria’s death and the creative trends behind this memorial marked an end to the Victorian and Edwardian eras.\n\nVictoria (born Alexandrina Victoria in Kensington Palace; May 1819-January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from June 1837 until her death in 1901. She gave her name to the Victorian era reigning for 63 years and seven months, longer than any previous British monarch. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific and military change within the United Kingdom and was marked by continuing expansion of the British Empire. In 1876 Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India. Victoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. They had nine children and following his sudden death in 1861 Victoria went into almost perpetual mourning.\n\nFollowing Victoria’s death her son, King Edward VII, suggested that a Parliamentary committee should be formed to develop plans for a memorial. The first meeting took place in February 1901 at the Foreign Office in Whitehall. Sites for the memorial in The Mall and in Green Park were soon dismissed in favour of its present position. Thomas Brock’s design had been accepted by July.\n\nFunds poured in from all over the British Empire. So much that the money also paid for Sir Aston Webb to design and build Admiralty Arch, reface the rather glum Buckingham Palace and add new gates and railings. Webb also widened The Mall, redesigned the road system around Brock’s monument and built the Dominion Gates, now referred to as the Commonwealth Gates."
