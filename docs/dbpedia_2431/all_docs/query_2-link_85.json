        "text": "“Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history, and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past.” – Lord Curzon suggested the creation of a fitting memorial in January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria.\n\nVictoria Memorial was opened in 1921 by the then Prince of Wales. This majestic structure is made with white marble.\n\nAfter a century this monument is standing tall to attract visitors from all across the globe to witness the history. Indeed this is one of the landmark destination of Kolkata for every tourist. It houses a museum containing a large collection of memorabilia relating to Queen Victoria and the British presence in India. Certain additions were made to this structure after India gained independence in 1947. A 16ft. high black bronze figure of winged Angel of Victory, holding a bugle in her hand was placed at the top of the dome of the memorial.\n\nA place to be worth visited with kids."
