        "text": "Structures of beauty and grace are many! Victoria Memorial is, however, a monument of colonial legacy combined with Indian culture. Nestled in the heart of Kolkata, the Victoria Memorial is an awe-inspiring monument paying homage to Queen Victoria. It beautifully blends classical and Neoclassical architectural styles.\n\nThis cultural place houses a museum and 25 galleries showcasing Indian history during the British Raj. It also has gardens in the surrounding area with several statues. Planning a getaway already? Check out affordable hotels in Kolkata for a comfortable stay!\n\nThe Victoria Memorial was dedicated to Queen Victoria. It is believed that she was keen on the subject of India and their aspects. Lord Curzon put forward the idea of building a memorial to preserve the history and later, introduce a museum. A site was chosen, which in today’s time, is near to the Raj Bhavan. It is located in the Maidan and attracts thousands of tourists every year.\n\nLocation: Victoria Memorial Hall, 1, Queens Way, Maidan, Kolkata, West Bengal 700071\n\nDesign and inspiration of the Victoria Memorial\n\nIndo-Saracenic revivalist architectural style is one the prime styles used during the British rule in India. It implies a fusion of various styles ranging from Mughal, Indian and European. That’s exactly why Victoria Memorial stands as a testament to excellent architecture and design. You can witness the columns throughout the structure. It is a European inspiration.\n\nSimilarly, domes are inspired by Mughal-style architecture including the Taj Mahal. Even the usage of white marble is significant in the Rajput styles. Walk through the interiors and you can find Indian inspirations in the form of decorative motifs and intricate patterns. The Islamic style floral design and geometric shapes are also a part of the interiors. It is the seamless integration of styles that makes it a must-visit destination.\n\nWhat makes the Victoria Memorial a stunning historical monument is the use of white marble. It showcases elegance and grandeur as the colour stands out during the daytime too. This white marble was used as it was known for its lustre and purity. The usage of this marble is inspired by classical European architecture. It sure communicates vibes of elegance and luxury!\n\nThe central dome of the Victoria Memorial is one of the prominent attractions here. Adorned by the Angel of Victory (sculpture above it), the dome steals the show! It is 184 feet high and the idea was to create a monument slightly higher than the Taj Mahal. This is again a fusion of Mughal and Indo-Saracenic architectural styles.\n\nRefer to the Gardens section to know more about the statues and their significance.\n\nThe Angel of Victory\n\nAs you watch the Victoria Memorial, you are sure to witness the Angel of Victory on the top of the central dome. Such a thoughtful creation speaks volumes about the ideation of this marvel. Designed by Sir Thomas Brock, the Angel of Victory is a statue of a winged female holding a bulge.\n\nIt symbolises victory.
