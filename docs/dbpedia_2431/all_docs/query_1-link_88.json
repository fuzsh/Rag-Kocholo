The Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most apt examples of the splendid British architecture in the entire country and stands as an authentic icon in the city of Kolkata.\n\nDesigned by Sir William Emerson, foreseen by Lord Curzon and inaugurated by Prince of Wales, King George V, himself, this white-marble grandiose was built between 1906 and 1921, dedicated to the deceased Queen Victoria to commemorate her 25 year reign as the Empress of India. Currently a museum under the Ministry of Culture, it still stands proudly on the Maidan (grounds) beside the bank of the Hooghly River, near Chowringhee Road or the Jawaharlal Nehru Road.\n\nThough a memorial, with a great dome-like structure, surrounded by four octagonal domed chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the domed corner towers, it was designed to be more consisting of divisions like The Royal Gallery, sprawling gardens, the extensive library and so much more.\n\nWhat is astounding is the fact that the collection inside the building is just as impressive as the monument itself. The memorial has a museum of British India memorabilia like famous European paintings and picturesque oil paintings depicting Queen Victoria herself at the various, important events of her life; such as her coronation, christening of the Prince of Wales and many more. Not to forget the several other prized artefacts from Indian history like the dagger of Tipu Sultan, rare books dating back to 1870, a cannon used in the battle of Plassey and invaluable manuscripts of the Ain-i-Akbari by Abul Fazal, held in this grandiloquent structure."
