        "text": "When thinking of exploring the city of joy, the first place that comes to mind is the famous Victoria memorial. Built during 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901) The monument still stands proudly, showing off her magnificent gardens and boasting of the wonderful “museum” that holds the antiques of the memorial. The memorial lies on the maidan (grounds) by the bank of the Hooghly River, near Jawaharlal Nehru road.\n\nMy friends, had come in from Patna to pay Kolkata a visit. Akul had his special bucket list where visiting the Victoria was right at the top and underlined with a red marker pen. He and Rajvi were looking forward to visiting the Victoria memorial.\n\nGetting there was pretty easy a simple bus ride from my house, a walk from Rabindra Sadan and we were outside the gates of the memorial, where Able met us. She too would accompany us in this visit. We were then warmly welcomed by a rather shabby looking transgender guy, a notorious “hijra” who was let us go. It (I wouldn’t really know if I should address this person as a him/her) seemed hell bend on obtaining some money to which I flatly refused. Not to mention the rather heart skipping method they used to ask for money. Nevertheless, I learnt that they are easily shooed away with 20 rupees, a rather displeasing but effective method. So next time on visiting a famous monument, I’d remember to pay for my welcome and keep 20 rupees ready.\n\nThe monument itself is extremely pretty. The statues, images, etc speak highly of the Victorian era. Queen Victoria was certainly a lucky girl. Beautiful art pieces and ceiling work indicate the dedication and hard work that was put into every triflic detail. The Victoria Memorial has 25 galleries. These include the royal gallery, the national leaders gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, the sculpture gallery, the arms and armoury gallery and the newer, Calcutta gallery\n\nThe ceiling itself had such splendid art pieces where one could feast his eyes on.\n\nGardens. Many of them. And I don’t mean the stones outside the monument. I mean the fresh greenery around the monument. And it stretches far and wide, so much that the gardens have to be broken up and named individually. They are maintained by a team of 21 gardeners. They were designed by Redesdale and David Prain. On Esch’s bridge, between narrative panels by Goscombe John, there is a bronze statue of Victoria, by George Frampton. Victoria is seated on her throne, wearing the robes of the Star of India. In the paved quadrangles and elsewhere around the building, other statues commemorate Hastings, Charles Cornwallis, Robert Clive, Arthur Wellesley, and James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie. Approaching the Victoria Memorial building from the south, visitors pass the Edward VII memorial arch. Upon the arch is a bronze equestrian statue of Edward VII by Bertram Mackennal and a marble statue of Curzon by Frederic William Pomeroy. The garden contains statues of dignitaries such as Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India (1833–1835), George Robinson (1st Marquess of Ripon), governor-general of India (1880–84), and Rajendra Nath Mookerjee, a pioneer industrialist of Bengal. The beautiful ponds too add to the splendor of the place. The Park benches around the gardens provide perfect resting places for those tired, and the bushes around provide good places for a little bit of cuddling and ahmn ahmn.. (Cough!).\n\nA Victoria memorial trip isn’t completed without walking out to the horse-cart stand. Of course people freak out on hearing the price of one ride. Others do go on a good ride around the area in the traditional horse cart to make their trip more memorable.\n\nAkul of course had other plans on feeding the horses, but the guy didn’t really go too near to those expensive animals."
