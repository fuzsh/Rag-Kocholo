        "text": "Victoria Memorial, Chandra Shekhar Azad Park, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nAllahabad which is now again Prayagraj. Apart from being the religious-cultural center of medieval India, it was the provincial capital of the Mughals. In 1764, Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, Nawab Shujauddaulah of Awadh and Nawab Mir Qasim of Bengal were defeated by the British East India Company's forces in the Battle of Buxar, after which Shah Alam II, signed a treaty with Robert Clive, the Governor of the East India Company, in August 1765 in this fort which was written by Itisham Uddin as it's a handwritten document. The British Raj started in India and Nawab Awadh, in handed over this fort to the British and the British continued to use it for military activities. After the failure of the revolt of 1857 AD, on November Ist, 1858, Lord Canning handed over the entire rights of the East India Company to the British Empire or government and this announcement was made in Minto Park Prayagraj, which was also the joint capital of Agra and Awadh province. Thus India became under the British. But this city was the center of the freedom struggle and home of many freedom fighters including Maulvi Liaqat and Azaad.\n\nQueen Victoria became the Empress of British India and many memorials were built in India to commemorate her majesty. Among such memorials one such elegant canopy was erected in Alfred Park now it's renamed as Chandra Shekhar Azad Park.\n\nThis excellent and attention-grabbing wonderful majestic memorial umbrella was built in memory of Queen Victoria after her death. When the construction work started, this fact could not be confirmed, but on March 24th, 1906, James Diggs La Touche inaugurated and opened it to the general public. The architect appears to have preferred a neo-classical type of architecture, which was a fusion of the Gothic Revival and Indo-Islamic styles, with more Islamic influences. The whole structure, which is based on hexagonal high pillars and arches and these pillars are like minarets on the roof and are topped with domes, is built on a raised platform and is characterized by four similar canopies on the four corners of that platform. Which are changing into domed minarets and are giving a new dimension to this architecture. The main canopy is built on four massive arches while the arches at the four corners are lower than the arches of the main structure. Six arches on the roof of the main structure and again six arches means this canopy is three storeys. Surrounding the dome above the monument are four more chhatris, which resemble the minarets of a mosque. The dome itself is purely Islamic, surmounted by an inverted lotus bud. In the middle of the main structure, which is built on a high platform, there is a blank pedestal on which the sitting statue of Queen Victoria was installed and this canopy was built to enhance and shade the beauty of the same. This monument was built by the British with special attention to provide protection from sun, rain etc. After independence, the magnificent statue of Queen Victoria was removed from here. White Italian marble stone was used in the construction of this monument and it is a protected monument of national importance maintained by the ASI."
