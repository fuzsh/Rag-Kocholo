In 1908 the Essanay Company released a one-reeler of World Series highlights, and in 1913 another ﬁlm production company, Selig Polyscope, distributed four reels of World Series footage. From 1908 to 1920 fans packed movie houses for showings of the visual highlights and plays they had read about or seen in newspaper photographs or illustrations. In 1924, at the same time that baseball ﬁlms (dramatic and documentary) were becoming popular, the National College Athletics Association declared the use of movies in scouting college football opponents “unfair” and “unethical.” Even before this, the value of slow-motion ﬁlm analysis had been established in baseball and golf, and it was extended to football by Walter Camp. Early interest in seeing the visual and dramatic elements of sports contests, sports personalities and stars, and the places where these contests were held (e.g., ballparks, stadiums, and boxing rings) was satisﬁed by the documentary qualities of these ﬁlms. Feature ﬁlms tended to be comedies, melodramas, or action adventure—that is, other forms grafted onto sports. When the talking, full-length feature ﬁlm became the standard product of Hollywood studios, studio heads and producers deemed sports ﬁlms “box-ofﬁce poison.” Sports ﬁlms were not commercially viable and not suitable to multiple variations of the same story format or to the “star” system. However, over time this negative assessment lessened, as producers learned that sports and sports heroes offered compelling stories that could be put into formulas: the underdog or unlikely winner; the big comeback after failure, decline, or adversity; the relationships of coaches and play-\n\nviii / Foreword\n\ners or teams; the phenom or fast-rising star or sensation; the athlete’s experience with women and romance; the inside story of how a sport is run by those who control it and make it proﬁtable, with the athlete as the pawn in this larger game. These ﬁlms were, of course, stories of white male athletes, coaches, and teams, and with the exceptions of certain ﬁlms about boxing and football, they reinforced and inscribed the hegemonic order and its values about competition and its attendant rewards. These values include fame, fortune or wealth, social visibility, admiration and emulation, and immortality. The contributors to this volume focus substantially on story elements that have been necessarily omitted, silenced, changed, marginalized, or minimized in sports ﬁlms—speciﬁcally, race, class, and gender. Standard commercial products like feature ﬁlms cannot usually accommodate the complexities of culture and identity because box ofﬁce appeal involves leveling out race, class, and gender so as not to create issues or resolve issues easily. A number of the contributors to this volume have read against the grain of the ﬁlms’ explicit themes to uncover substrata of meaning and implications or to ﬁnd salient connections to the times in which the ﬁlms were released. Another major contribution of this volume is the extension of its focus beyond and outside the Hollywood ﬁlm genre to documentaries, international cinema, and television coverage of sports. As the volume’s editors note in their introduction, one of the central developments in sports has been the dramatic expansion of individual sports such as running, triathlons, snowboarding, cycling, biking, golﬁng, surﬁng, ﬁshing, and conditioning. The multidirectional nature of individual sports means that mass media products such as feature ﬁlms about certain sports have less of a hold on those pursuing individual sports. Their interests run along the lines of specialized feature or instructional videos, cable television channels, publications, or websites. More important than the narrative or dramatic representation of it is the actual experience of the sport and the culture in its venue. It is little wonder that a number of these sports have been brought into Olympic competitions and have developed into organized, sanctioned sports with international competitions or championships. Consumerist forces co-opt and market what is proﬁtable, and it is proﬁtable because it is popular. Nations hold on to sports because athletes and competitions continue to provide a means of promoting national\n\nForeword / ix\n\nmythologies and ideologies and keeping athletic prowess and excellence before the nation as an achievable ideal. The feature ﬁlm plays an increasingly diminished role in the cultural diffusion of sports, which makes the excellent sports ﬁlm seem even more remarkable when it comes along. When ideals or success formulas have been tarnished or compromised by athletes or those involved in sports, it is more difﬁcult for sports ﬁlms to uphold or reify these. Amateurism or non-performance-enhanced athletes seem, at times, anachronistic, even when we know that virtues and values still exist in sports because competitors put them there and share them. We ﬁnd in our sports ourselves and our worlds—small and contained, large and expansive. Each of the essays in this book is part of that process.

Schoenecke, and Deborah A. Carmichael\n\nIntroduction Sports in Film: Cultural and Historical Representations of Athletic Competition on the Screen Traditionalists often perceive the athletic playing field as a meritocracy in which issues of race, gender, class, and nationality play no role. Films such as Miracle (2004), which focuses on the upset victory of the U.S. hockey team over the Soviet Union in the 1980 Olympic Games, and Ron Howard’s Cinderella Man (2005), which chronicles the rags to riches story of heavyweight ﬁghter James Braddock during the 1930s, perpetuate the idea that the athletic world provides a vehicle for social mobility in which hard work will prevail in the best tradition of Benjamin Franklin and Horatio Alger. The authors represented in this volume, however, question this assumption, arguing that nationalism, race, class, and gender are major components of sports and their representation through cinema. Athletes are often burned out at a young age and fail to acquire the education and skills necessary to succeed in life. Sports as an avenue for social mobility often proves illusive, as the documentary ﬁlm Hoop Dreams (1994) well illustrates. And notions of fair play in the increasingly big money world of sports are challenged by the emergence of performance-enhancing drugs. Yet we are still drawn to the struggle in which underdogs do achieve that impossible victory, encouraging us all to believe that equality and justice might truly reign on and off the ﬁeld of play. The bottom line is that, for better or worse, sports are big business, with sporting spectacles in baseball, football, basketball, hockey, boxing, horse racing, race car driving, and soccer reﬂecting the mass culture of the twentieth century. Increased leisure time for the middle class has led\n\n2 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\nBased on the life of James Braddock, Cinderella Man (2005) is but one example of the athlete hero triumphing over adversity.

These sports are an integral part of the culture and cannot simply be dismissed as bread and circuses for the masses. In America’s Obsession: Sports and Society Since 1945, Richard O. Davies concludes that American sports are “unquestionably big business in terms of dollars generated . . . [and] also of major importance in a social sense. For many Americans, ‘winning is the only thing,’ as football coach Vince Lombardi once promised, for them sports has become an obsession of dubious worth. For the great majority, however, sports provide a wholesome and positive means of enriching their lives.”1 Although Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali are two of the most recognizable faces on the planet, modern sport is not all about American hegemony. The power of sports on the international stage was certainly evident in the 2006 World Cup, the world’s premiere sporting event. Although\n\nIntroduction / 3\n\nsoccer increasingly is played in both male and female youth leagues, the sport has failed to register as a mass spectator sport in the United States, and as usual, the U.S. team fared poorly in the tournament. Nevertheless, U.S. television ratings for the World Cup were at record levels. Who could not be fascinated by the drama of the championship game between France and Italy? In overtime, the French star and captain Zinedine Zidane was ejected from the game for head-butting Italian defender Marco Materazzi. With Zidane absent, the Italians were able to prevail in a shoot-out, and delirious celebrations erupted in Rome. The postgame analysis focused on what Materazzi said to provoke Zidane, who had already announced that he would retire following the 2006 championship game. Both players were disciplined by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international soccer federation, after speculation that Materazzi had insulted Zidane’s mother or called the Algerian-born Zidane a terrorist. This is the type of drama that makes sport such a ripe arena for cinema. Thus, it is not surprising that Hollywood is drawn to the sports genre ﬁlm. As Aaron Baker suggests in Contesting Identities: Sports in American Film, sports are of interest to ﬁlmmakers because they are hardly apolitical and they serve as an arena in which the “contested process of deﬁning social identities” regarding race, class, gender, and sexuality takes place.2 One of the leading box ofﬁce successes of 2004, Friday Night Lights, which was adapted from the 1990 bestseller by H. G. Bissinger, makes this process evident. Friday Night Lights chronicles the 1988 high school season of Odessa Permian in football-crazy West Texas. It captures Americans’ obsession with sports in the words of an Odessa, Texas, businessman, who proclaims, “Life really wouldn’t be worth livin’ if you didn’t have a high school football team to support.”3 In the 1920s Hollywood began to recognize the importance of sports heroes such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Red Grange, and Jack Dempsey, incorporating these ﬁgures into small-budget pictures that drew on the celebrity status of the athletes. During the Depression, football was often the subject of Hollywood’s attention, with ﬁlms such as Saturday’s Heroes (1937), Hero for a Day (1939), and Yesterday’s Heroes (1940) raising serious reservations about the hypocrisy of college sports. Pugilist ﬁlms such as Golden Boy (1939), in which a promising young violinist sacriﬁces his musical career to become a prizeﬁghter, also questioned the greed of capitalism. A more positive representation of sports in the post–World War II era was developed in the popular ﬁlm biographies Knute Rockne—\n\n4 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\n“Life really wouldn’t be worth livin’ if you didn’t have a high school football team to support.” Friday Night Lights (2004). Courtesy of Oklahoma State University Special Collections.\n\nAll-American (1940), starring Pat O’Brien in the title role and Ronald Reagan as George Gipp, and The Pride of the Yankees (1942), which starred Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig. Two popular archetypes were created in these ﬁlms: in Rockne, the coach who is tough on his players because he cares for them; and in The Pride of the Yankees, the athlete who perseveres against tremendous obstacles. The latter archetype was used in a series of biographical baseball ﬁlms in the post–World War II era in which male athletes had to overcome difﬁculties, usually with the encouragement of their adoring spouses. In The Stratton Story (1949), James Stewart stars as Chicago White Sox pitcher Monty Stratton, who must learn to cope with losing his leg in a hunting accident. The Pride of St. Louis (1952) features Dan Dailey as St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Dizzy Dean, who must deal with his lack of education. And in The Winning Team (1952), Ronald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander copes with alcoholism. Baseball was also the subject of Strategic Air Command (1955), in which a ﬁctional Dutch Holland, portrayed by James Stewart, leaves a lucrative baseball career to serve his country in the\n\nIntroduction / 5\n\nair force. In a Knute Rockne–like role, Frank Lovejoy plays commanding ofﬁcer General Hawks, who is supposed to personify the cigar-chomping General Curtis Lemay. Despite the burgeoning post–World War II civil rights movement, sports ﬁlms in the 1950s continued to focus on a white male America. Two exceptions to this were The Jackie Robinson Story (1950) and Jim Thorpe: All American (1951). Robinson portrays himself in the ﬁlm biography, which concludes with the baseball star testifying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), refuting Paul Robeson’s statement that black Americans would not defend the country during the Cold War. Robinson later regretted his decision to provide this testimony. The movie becomes another American epic of success as he surmounts the problems of racial discrimination. In Jim Thorpe: All American, Burt Lancaster portrays Jim Thorpe, the famous Olympic athlete and professional football and baseball player. Thorpe’s problems derived from what the ﬁlm depicts as his oversensitivity to possible racial discrimination (Thorpe was of mixed white and Native American ancestry), which culminated in the drinking problems that destroyed his marriage. While these two ﬁlms broadened the sports ﬁlm genre to include African Americans and Native Americans, they placed their protagonists within the traditional success ethic of hard work and democracy. Only postwar boxing ﬁlms such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949) seemed to challenge the American consensus, offering a more critical analysis of American society and capitalism as being based on greed and exploitation. Similarly ambiguous elements are apparent in Elia Kazan’s On the Waterfront (1954), the story of prizeﬁghter Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), a ﬁlm that usually is used in defense of the decision by director Kazan and scriptwriter Budd Schulberg to cooperate with HUAC. With the civil rights and women’s movements taking center stage during the 1960s and 1970s, sports ﬁlms began to broaden their focus in the last decades of the twentieth century. Women increasingly participated in athletics following the implementation of Title IX in 1972. The legislation denied federal funding to any educational institution that failed to maintain equity in its men’s and women’s athletic programs. Although discrepancies persist, more young women participate in athletics today than ever before. However, based upon Hollywood’s depiction of women in sports, one would not necessarily gather this fact. Films such as A League of Their\n\n6 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\nOwn (1992), Personal Best (1982), and Bend It Like Beckham (2002), although they tend to perpetuate gender stereotypes, suggest the potential in making women the protagonists of sports ﬁlms. The sports ﬁlm genre, like sports in general, has made few inroads into exploring issues of sexual preference. In the macho and male-dominated world of professional athletics, it is difﬁcult for gay athletes to openly discuss their sexuality. Male athletes who publicly identify themselves as gay—for example, Billy Bean and Glenn Burke in baseball and David Kopay and Esena Tuaoio in football—usually do so only after their playing days are over. One of the few sports ﬁlms to tackle the subject is Personal Best, which deals with lesbianism in a fashion that some critics consider to be exploitive. Filmmakers are more comfortable addressing the intersection between race and class, and in ﬁlms such as Brian’s Song (1971), Remember the Titans (2000), and Glory Road (2006), sports are portrayed as the means through which racial barriers and discrimination can be broken down. The pursuit of the American dream is embraced by Rocky (1976) and its many successors. Nostalgia for an idyllic America is also apparent in the baseball ﬁlms Field of Dreams (1989) and The Natural (1984), and sports ﬁlms that contest the American success ethic include Cobb (1994), That Championship Season (1982), Eight Men Out (1988), and Martin Scorsese’s masterpiece of the ﬁght genre, Raging Bull (1980). The increasing popularity of sports in American society is evident in the number of ﬁlms dealing with athletic endeavors beyond mass spectator sports. Many of these ﬁlms also address social and class issues, but they are generally notable for their emphasis on white America. The widening lens of the sports genre ﬁlm has covered sports such as bicycling in Breaking Away (1979), pool in The Color of Money (1986), skiing in Downhill Racer (1969), skating in Ice Castles (1979), track and ﬁeld in Prefontaine (1997), golf in Tin Cup (1996), tennis in Players (1979), and surﬁng in Endless Summer (1964). This brief survey indicates that the sports ﬁlm genre offers a rich resource for scholars of ﬁlm and sports. One of the major strengths of this collection of essays, however, is that the treatment of the topic extends beyond Hollywood to include television sports coverage, documentaries, and international cinema. We have divided the anthology into three sections: sports as cultural production and representation; masculinity, misogyny,\n\nIntroduction / 7\n\nand race in sports; and national identity and political confrontation in sports competition.\n\nSports as Cultural Production and Representation The section on cultural production and representation begins with an essay by Joan Ormrod on the classic surﬁng ﬁlm Endless Summer (1964). Ormrod investigates the cultural fascination with surﬁng during the 1960s, a phenomenon that extended from the coasts to the landlocked Midwest. Ormrod maintains that the search for the “perfect wave,” as exempliﬁed in Endless Summer, represents the consumerism of the 1960s, a time when the United States attempted to impose American cultural values in the international sphere, culminating in the Vietnam War. In the next essay, “‘I’m Against It!’: The Marx Brothers’ Horse Feathers as Cultural Critique, or, Why Big-Time Football Gives Me a Haddock,” Daniel A. Nathan examines the Marx Brothers’ ﬁlm Horse Feathers (1932) as a critique of college athletics. Nathan is conﬁdent that the Marx Brothers never read the Carnegie Foundation’s report American College Athletics (1929), which criticized colleges and universities for putting a greater priority on sports than education; however, the comedians always had an excellent eye for hypocrisy among pompous individuals such as university presidents. Unfortunately, many of the points made in this ﬁlm still ring true today. The essay by Michael Schoenecke explores the relationship between celebrated athletes and the movies, focusing on one sportsman who preferred not to “go Hollywood.” Unlike his 1920s contemporaries such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jack Dempsey, and Red Grange, golfer Bobby Jones chose to participate in instructional ﬁlms rather than feature ﬁlms. As Schoenecke reveals, however, humorous scenes were included in the ﬁlms in order to respond to audience expectations, reﬂecting cultural assumptions about both sports ﬁgures and sports ﬁlms. We have yet to see Tiger Woods in a feature ﬁlm, but his commercials are a staple of contemporary television. The more frequent depiction of golf in cinema today, with features such as The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), is a product of the growing popularity of professional golf on television. Although the uninitiated might think of golf as incredibly uncinematic and about as exciting as\n\n8 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\nwatching corn grow, it is a lucrative part of contemporary sports television, as is evident in the creation of the Golf Channel. In “Televised Golf and the Creation of Narrative,” Harper Cossar investigates this phenomenon, concentrating on television coverage of the 2003 Funai Classic as an example of how the networks have made golf a staple of weekend coverage. Cossar’s essay suggests the necessity for further investigation into the relationship between sports and television. The proﬁt margin for many professional sports franchises comes not from ticket sales but from lucrative television contracts. The question that scholars of television and sports need to examine is the inﬂuence that television networks now have on how games are played. Sports also are gaining a spot in the nation’s classrooms, with sports history classes attaining high enrollments in many universities. In “What’s Natural About It?: A Baseball Movie as Introduction to Key Concepts in Cultural Studies,” Latham Hunter discusses her experience teaching The Natural (1984) to community college students. In her predominantly male classes, many students are taking a cultural studies course only because it is a requirement; however, Hunter ﬁnds that teaching an accessible ﬁlm such as The Natural allows her to critically engage students in a dialogue regarding ideas of gender, heroism, and nation. Her experience suggests sports ﬁlm can be used successfully as a pedagogical tool.\n\nMasculinity, Misogyny, and Race in Sport The second section of the anthology examines the roles of masculinity, misogyny, and race in sports as revealed through ﬁlm. Focusing on both male and female athletes, in movies such as Rocky (1976), Slap Shot (1977), Raging Bull (1980), A League of Their Own (1992), and Pat and Mike (1952), Dayna B. Daniels argues that cinematic depictions of the athletic world as a male domain have perpetuated sexism and misogyny in American culture. Daniels observes that coaches in the locker rooms of the nation, and in the ﬁlms that depict them, use language that viliﬁes women to motivate male athletes. In the vocabulary of misogyny, the only thing worse than being called a girl is to have one’s heterosexuality questioned. Perhaps the only way to rectify the situation described by Daniels is to have more gays, lesbians, and women involved not only on the athletic ﬁeld but also in sports ﬁlms.\n\nIntroduction / 9\n\nIn “As American As . . . : Filling in the Gaps and Recovering the Narratives of America’s Forgotten Heroes,” Pellom McDaniels III observes that, with the exception of Bingo Long’s Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings (1976), Hollywood baseball ﬁlms have ignored the accomplishments of the Negro Leagues. According to Hollywood, black baseball began with Jackie Robinson and integration. Filmmakers have overlooked the fact that integration destroyed the black institution of baseball, although McDaniels acknowledges that documentaries such as There Was Always Sun Shining Someplace (1984), Kings on the Hill: Baseball’s Forgotten Men (1993), and The Journey of the African-American Athlete (1996) document the contributions of the Negro League players, fans, and entrepreneurs. The essay underscores the importance of consulting sports documentaries in research and teaching. Some of the points raised by McDaniels are echoed in Ron Briley’s essay on the popular basketball ﬁlm Hoosiers (1986). Briley attempts to place Hoosiers within the historical and cultural context of Ronald Reagan’s America of the 1980s. The “Milan Miracle” of 1954, in which an all-white team from a farming community defeated a black urban high school team for the state basketball championship, is interpreted as a longing for a mythical white middle-class America of the 1950s, a time before the challenges posed by feminists, civil rights reformers, antiwar protesters, and advocates for greater economic equality. Hoosiers thus represents nostalgia for the simpler (white as opposed to multicultural) America found in Field of Dreams (1989), the rhetoric of President Reagan, and Disney theme park recreations of Main Street at the turn of the century. Boxing ﬁlms have often challenged this simplistic and nostalgic perception of America. The boxing ﬁlm genre in the United States is noted for such acclaimed movies as Golden Boy (1939), Body and Soul (1947), Champion (1949), Raging Bull (1980), and Hurricane (2001), but perhaps the most beloved Hollywood ﬁght ﬁlm is Rocky (1976). Rocky and its sequels are extolled by many ﬁlmgoers and critics as the embodiment of the American dream of success through hard work and determination. The essays by Victoria Elmwood and Clay Motley challenge this simplistic reading of the ﬁlm and the character. In her reading of Rocky, Elmwood interprets the ﬁlm as a reﬂection of male insecurity during the troubled economic and political period of the 1970s. Reacting to the growth of feminism and the blurring of traditional\n\n10 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\ngender boundaries, Elmwood argues, Rocky enlists the support of black men into the consensus in order to roll back the gains of feminism. Motley also perceives the ﬁlm as reﬂecting male insecurity during the 1970s, comparing the crisis in American manhood in the 1970s to a similar crisis during the 1890s. During the earlier period, men like Theodore Roosevelt were threatened by modernism and questioned their masculinity. They sought “manly” experience in conﬂicts such as the Spanish-American War of 1898. Motley asserts that a similar identity crisis was present during the 1970s, as the economy tumbled and Americans suffered from the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.\n\nNational Identity and Political Confrontation in Sports Competition The ﬁnal section of the anthology examines national identity and political confrontation in sports. In his essay “Do You Believe in Miracles? Whiteness, Hollywood and a ‘Post-9/11’ Sports Imagination,” David J. Leonard supports many of the points made in the preceding essays. Focusing on the Hollywood feature Miracle (2004) and its documentary companion Do You Believe in Miracles? The Story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team (2001), Leonard argues that the victory of the U.S. hockey team in the 1980 Olympics should be read through the lens of whiteness. Sports ﬁlms often celebrate the victory of David over Goliath, and in this case the Americans were the underdogs against the favored Soviets. In a postmodern analysis, Leonard insists that the 1980 U.S. hockey team overcame their lack of athletic ability and their poor facilities through their white working-class work ethic and their masculinity. Leonard concludes that in a “post-9/11” world, this cinematic trope resonates with Americans who perceive themselves as underdogs in the war on terror, ﬁghting an enemy that does not play by the rules. Accordingly, Leonard concludes that America’s greatest sports heroes demonstrate the power and possibility of a collective white masculinity. As Leonard’s essay suggests, the Olympic Games provide a venue for political statement as well as athletic excellence. The 1936 Berlin Games were employed by Nazi Germany to assert Aryan superiority, but this notion was shattered by the accomplishments of Jesse Owens. The Mexico City Olympics of 1968 witnessed the brutal suppression of student dissent by the Mexican government, as well as the symbolic black power salutes\n\nIntroduction / 11\n\nof sprinters Tommy Smith and John Carlos. While political boycotts in response to the Cold War and racial apartheid were signiﬁcant factors in several of the post–World War II Olympics, perhaps the most infamous example of politics intruding into the games is the 1972 terrorist attack that resulted in the slaying of Israeli athletes. David Diffrient offers an interesting commentary on the ofﬁcial documentary of the 1972 games, Visions of Eight (1973), in which a deliberate effort was made not to focus on the violence of the summer games in Munich. Produced by David L. Wolper and Stan Margulies, Visions of Eight consists of eight short ﬁlms directed by such outstanding international ﬁlmmakers as Arthur Penn, Milos Foreman, and John Schlesinger. Diffrient argues that, by concentrating on the tension between cooperation and competition, these ﬁlms exemplify the Olympic spirit and experience. The essay by John Hughson provides an international perspective on class and sports, addressing issues of social class in director Tony Richardson’s The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962). Hughson places this well-known sports ﬁlm within the context of the “angry young man” genre, which is represented most notably by the work of playwright John Osborne. Christoph Laucht and Tobias Hochscherf contributed the ﬁnal essay in the collection. They examine the 2003 German feature ﬁlm The Miracle of Bern, which narrates Germany’s soccer victory in the 1954 World Cup. Laucht and Hochscherf assert that The Miracle of Bern, which was produced a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ensuing uniﬁcation of East and West Germany, uses Hollywood emotional techniques to foster a German foundational myth. They examine the important link between the Hollywood sports ﬁlm genre and one of Germany’s most beloved sports features, demonstrating the capability of sports and ﬁlm research to reach across international boundaries. Considerable work remains to be done to fully explore sports documentaries, the connection between sports and television, and the relationship between international sports cinema and the Hollywood sports ﬁlm genre. The pieces contained in this anthology only begin to suggest the wide range of research and writing that is needed in the ﬁeld, thus pointing the way for additional study in this important arena of life in the twenty-ﬁrst century. We trust that the collection will inspire and foster further work on sports and ﬁlm.\n\n12 / Briley, Schoenecke, and Carmichael\n\nFilmography Bend It Like Beckham. Directed by Gurinder Chadha.

For the ﬁrst time the rest of the world would have a clear look at the surﬁng lifestyle. —Matt Warshaw, Surfer’s Journal History of Surﬁng Films Brown cobbled together $50,000 and set out with two California surfers, Mike Hynson and Robert August, to produce a true documentary on real surfers. Not beach bums or playboys who sang to their girlfriends, surfers were athletes who enjoyed the adventure of scanning the globe in search of the perfect wave. —Ben Marcus, “The Sick Six: Six of the Most Important Surf Movies Ever Made, from the Fifties to Now” After World War II, America and the West experienced a consumer boom as a result of greater disposable incomes, advances in technology, and an increase in commodity production. The consumer culture focused in part on the pleasure derived from acquiring goods, and goods came to symbolize lifestyles and identities.1 The baby boom generation, which was born following the war and became teenaged in the 1950s, was an integral part of the consumer culture. American teenagers numbered ten to ﬁfteen million in the 1950s and had a potential spending power of nine billion dollars.2 It is therefore not surprising that this market became the target of advertising and mass media exploitation and that it has been shamelessly exploited since the 1950s.3 By the early 1960s youth culture was the locus for innovation in fashion, music, and style, and this innovation crossed over into adult lifestyles as well, bringing about, for example, dance crazes such as the Twist in the early 1960s.4\n\n18 / Joan Ormrod\n\nAmong young people the growth in consumerism included leisure activities such as going to the movies, driving, and sports. Surﬁng in particular was regarded as a hot new sport with a youthful focus, which appealed to middle class, white youth and epitomized the ideal California lifestyle. “Surfsploitation,” as the surf craze became known, emerged in the United States as a cross-media drive to attract youth audiences through the glamour and freedom supposedly offered by the surﬁng lifestyle. Surfsploitation included the surf music represented by groups such as the Beach Boys, the Ventures, and Jan and Dean. The Beach Boys were marketed as allAmerican high school boys who surfed, were clean cut, and cared only for cars, girls, and fun, fun, fun. Hollywood produced about seventy surf-related exploitation ﬁlms purporting to lift the lid on just what happened on the beach when adults were not around to regulate undesirable behavior. Out of this heady, consumerist mix of mass media exploitation emerged what many surfers regard as the deﬁnitive “pure” surf movie, Bruce Brown’s The Endless Summer (originally released in 1964). The Endless Summer has a simple premise—the quest for the perfect wave, which is one of the deﬁning myths of surf culture and its representation outside the subculture. Director and surfer Bruce Brown followed two surfers, Robert August and Mike Hynson, around the globe to experience an endless summer and catch the perfect wave. The two friends traveled to little-known destinations such as Australia, Ghana, New Zealand, South Africa, and Tahiti, in addition to more familiar locales such as Malibu and Hawaii. Brown explained, “Originally we were just going to South Africa and then come back . . . but it turned out to be $50 cheaper to go all the way round the world, so we did that.”5 The Endless Summer belongs to a subgenre of surf ﬁlms that Douglas Booth describes as “pure.”6 These are surf ﬁlms that were made by surfers for a surﬁng audience and typically were exhibited at surf clubs. Brown’s credentials as a surfer and surf ﬁlmmaker, and his association with signiﬁcant surfboard shapers such as Dale Velzy, ensured the authenticity of his representation of surf culture. “Pure” surf ﬁlms relied on the ﬁlm producer to distribute and exhibit them at independent cinemas and other small venues. Brown exhibited the ﬁlm along with a running commentary to enthusiastic surfer audiences at high school halls and clubhouses.7 Brown developed a script from which he distilled the best of the jokes and script elements before recording a permanent soundtrack. In an effort to\n\nEndless Summer / 19\n\ngain Hollywood studio distribution, Brown, aided by Paul Allen, toured around the United States, stopping in cities such as Wichita, Kansas—a venue hardly famed for its waves—where the ﬁlm ran for two weeks to full houses. However, something unexpected happened with The Endless Summer: it crossed over from niche to mainstream audiences when the distribution was taken up by Columbia Pictures Corporation. Indeed, the ﬁlm was so popular that Newsweek dubbed The Endless Summer one of the best ten ﬁlms of 1966, after it was re-released by Columbia. So why was The Endless Summer so popular? Robert August, one of the ﬁlm’s stars, believes that the distribution of the ﬁlm to mainstream audiences in 1966 was a reminder of a more innocent time, providing Americans with time out from the Vietnam War and the chance to have fun for a while. “It was the right time for it,” August said.8 Bruce Brown is not sure: “I don’t know . . . I’ve run into so many people who saw The Endless Summer, particularly back east, and said it had some effect on them. But a lot of ’em, they didn’t surf, and they never did surf. It’s always been a mystery to me.”9 A generation of surfers later, Albie Thoms wrote of The Endless Summer, “What everyone picked up on was the beauty of surﬁng, the harmonious union of man and nature, the adventure implicit in riding waves no-one surfed before, and the sense of freedom to be found away from civilisation’s complexity.”10 Thoms, however, ignored the consumer aspect of The Endless Summer, conferring upon it an Edenic innocence with which it has been associated ever since. However, this essay argues that it is impossible to wrest the ﬁlm from its consumer roots. The reason for the popularity of The Endless Summer was that it perfectly expressed the dreams of American culture in a hedonist search for freedom from the restrictions of conformity. Further, the main premise of the ﬁlm, the surfers’ quest for the perfect wave, was attractive to American culture in the early to mid-1960s, articulating a reenactment of the conquering of the American frontier and, as August suggests, reminding Americans of a simpler, more innocent time before the Vietnam War.\n\nSurf Exploitation and the Teenage Consumer In the early to mid-1950s, teenagers were represented as transgressive, and the perceived threat of juvenile delinquency to the American way of life was, according to J. Edgar Hoover, second only to communism.11\n\n20 / Joan Ormrod\n\nHowever, the late 1950s and early 1960s saw the emergence of the “clean teen”—the fun-loving teen who conformed to the strictures of society. The clean teen phenomenon was “a quite literal product of the parent culture, fabricated from above, peddled down below.”12 Rebellious teen pop icons of the 1950s, including Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Chuck Berry, were replaced by squeaky-clean stars such as Pat Boone, Frankie Avalon, and Annette Funicello. Clean teen stars were promoted in ﬁlm, pop music, and television. For instance, Frankie Avalon had a big hit with “Venus in Blue Jeans,” and Annette Funicello starred as a Mouseketeer in the Mickey Mouse Club and also had a hit record with “Tall Paul.” Just as pop music was tamed, so Hollywood quickly changed its representation of teenagers in the early 1960s, depicting them as fun loving, clean living, and most of all, good consumers. Surﬁng, which previously was regarded as transgressive, became part of the clean teen phenomenon when it was identiﬁed as a sport enjoyed by teenagers—more importantly, by white, middle class teenagers from families with good incomes. The surf boom was fueled by the release of the 1959 ﬁlm Gidget, starring teen star Sandra Dee as the “girl midget.” Gidget was adapted from Fred Kohner’s book about his daughter Kathy’s experiences with a bunch of surfers at The Point in Malibu. Sandra Dee’s costar was heartthrob James Darren, who played a surf bum wannabe, Moondoggie. Gidget was a typical white, middle-class teenager who either had enough disposable income to buy a surfboard or was able to cajole her doting parents into buying it for her. The story is about her romance with Moondoggie and the romantic, dropout lifestyle of the surf bums, led by Kahuna. By the end of the ﬁlm, Gidget gets her man and converts Kahuna, previously a conﬁrmed bachelor and layabout, into a productive member of society. Following on the success of Gidget, American Independent Pictures released a series of six exploitation ﬁlms with a surﬁng background. The ﬁrst of the series, Beach Party (1963), set the paradigm for the other ﬁlms: Muscle Beach Party (1964), Bikini Beach (1964), Beach Blanket Bingo (1965), How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965), and The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966). Most of American Independent Pictures’ beach ﬁlms starred Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, and a regular gang of surfers, such as Joel McCrae as Deadhead.13 There was also a regular supporting cast, which included Harvey Lembeck as Eric von Zipper, a middle-aged “wild one,”\n\nGidget book cover, 1957.

The liminal nature of the beach, coupled with scanty beachwear and the lack of adult supervision, offered the opportunity for frolics and sexual innuendo in the sand dunes, as well as pop songs and slapstick comedy. However, this shameless exploitation of their culture caused such fury in the Californian surf community that Mickey Dora, the most famous surfer in California and a vociferous opponent of surf commercialism, released a jar of moths onto the screen at Beach Party’s ﬁrst screening. Paradoxically, Dora was not above taking money for stunt work in the ﬁlm. He also provided stunt footage for several other Hollywood ﬁlms of the time, including Ride the Wild Surf (1964) and Gidget (1959). Coincidentally, surfboard technology was also undergoing a revolution at this time. Previously, surfboards had been made from the increasingly rare and expensive balsa wood, and the boards were too expensive for the average teenager to buy. The weight of the surfboards also made them more difﬁcult to carry and maneuver in the water. Surfboards also were scarce. A surfboard might take up to three weeks to craft. However, when Hobie Alter and Dale Velzy began to use foam to make surfboards, they could produce up to 160 boards per week at a cost of seventy to eighty dollars.14 Indeed, Alter noted that, “If that movie’d [Gidget] come out in the balsa era . . . no one could have supplied ’em.”15 The production of cheaper and lighter boards enabled a whole generation of teenagers to take to the waves. Coupled with the growing afﬂuence in California, an afﬂuence that was especially experienced by teenagers, the production of cheaper surfboards soon made Malibu and other Californian surf spots very popular and very crowded. The exploitation of the sport dismayed many of the bona ﬁde surfers. It was in an effort to depict the authentic surf lifestyle that Bruce Brown claims he produced The Endless Summer. The sobriety of the ﬁlm is apparent from the press pack, which is restrained, consisting of a brief history of surﬁng and some stills from the ﬁlm with reviews from Time, The New Yorker, and Playboy. When compared with the ﬂashy, hyperbolic poster for Muscle Beach Party, the simplicity of the poster for The Endless Summer promises a mythic and idealized portrayal of surﬁng and surf culture, as Robert August and Mike Hynson “follow this everlasting summer around the world.” Columbia Pictures, which took over the release of the ﬁlm in 1966,\n\nEndless Summer / 23\n\nThe poster image for The Endless Summer (1964) was taken from a photograph of Mike Hynson, Robert August, and Bruce Brown. Courtesy of Columbia Pictures.\n\ndeliberately placed a good deal of clear blue water between The Endless Summer and its exploitative cousins. Poster and advertising copy for The Endless Summer is predicated on youth and tourism. The notion of summer connotes the optimism of vacations and youth, and adding “endless” to this idea holds out the promise that youth and vacationing may go on forever. The poster copy begins as follows: “On any day of the year it’s summer somewhere in the world.” It goes on to describe the quest for the perfect wave and concludes with this offer to audiences: “Share their [Mike Hynson and Robert August’s] experiences as they search the world for that perfect wave that might be forming just over the horizon.” The wave forming “just over the horizon” promises the fulﬁlment of the quest, but it also suggests pushing back a frontier or exploring a new and undiscovered country. The frontier myth has been a part of American culture since its origins.16 Surfers’ quest for the perfect wave expresses an underpinning American value, an aim to explore the wilderness and thereby extend the frontiers of civilization.17 It also intersects with the aim of the tourist to discover new locations in which “authentic” life may be scrutinized. The\n\n24 / Joan Ormrod\n\nsurfer as constructed through tourist discourse is a phenomenon that originates from the dissemination of surﬁng from the Paciﬁc Islands to the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century. Surﬁng was part of the ancient kapua caste system of Hawaii for at least one thousand years. When Captain Cook’s ship The Resolution anchored at Kealano Bay, the kapua system was already in decline.18 The arrival of European missionaries and disease hastened that decline, and surﬁng too virtually disappeared until the mid- to late nineteenth century. Surﬁng reemerged as a result of consumerist discourse and modernity in the late nineteenth century. In an effort to overthrow plantation culture, Hawaii developed its tourist potential using myths of paradise on earth and unspoiled beauty to attract mainly American tourists.19 The Waikiki Hotel in particular attracted tourists with its outrigger club and the Waikiki Beach Boys, native Hawaiians who gave surﬁng demonstrations to tourists. Before The Endless Summer, surfers regularly made pilgrimages to “the Islands.” Beginning in the 1920s, surfers migrated to Hawaii to experience surﬁng’s spiritual home. The Hawaiian Islands were associated with an exotic mystique that conferred subcultural capital on the émigrés.20 Indeed, in the 1930s, one of the ﬁrst surﬁng colonies in California, at San Onofre, celebrated the Hawaiian lifestyle in a hedonistic and bohemian way of life. Reverence for Hawaii was translated into popular notions of surﬁng through the character of Kahuna in Gidget. In the movie, Kahuna, who was named after a Hawaiian priest, is regarded as the head of the surﬁng colony at Malibu both because of his lifestyle as a dropout and because he has surfed the Islands.21 In The Endless Summer Bruce Brown took the mystique of surﬁng the exotic and primitive “other” and developed it into a global quest for the perfect wave.22 However, despite the movie’s simple premise, the construct of the perfect wave and the representations of surfers and other places in the ﬁlm could only be expressed as such because of American culture at that speciﬁc historic and societal moment. Indeed, the consumerism that underpinned exploitation ﬁlms in that era was more crucial to the production of The Endless Summer than either Columbia or Bruce Brown would care to admit.\n\nThe Development and Commodiﬁcation of Californian Surﬁng Several issues are important to the discussion of The Endless Summer. First, the importance of California cannot be overemphasized. Beginning in the\n\nEndless Summer / 25\n\nlate 1950s, California, home of the typical American surfer, was regarded as a state ﬁlled with golden people who were all young, tan, and afﬂuent.23 Second, America was “discovered” in 1492 as a result of European exploration and expansion.24 However, before Columbus, America was imagined on maps as “terra incognita,” and Europeans made assumptions about the inhabitants of such a land. Once Europeans began to colonize the United States, European clerics and academics began to position the indigenous population as children. The continent was described as “the New World,” as opposed to Europe, the Old World. These associations have informed representations of the United States ever since the sixteenth century, and they continue to inﬂuence contemporary notions of the United States as a youthful society. These notions also have inﬂuenced America’s ideas about its own culture and are particularly apparent in the worship of youth and youthfulness.25 Herbert Gans suggests that much of American ideology revolves around the idea of personal liberty and freedom of choice.26 Within American capitalism there is the notion that an individual can make money by striving harder than anyone else. Competitiveness is a major component of the American Dream, suggesting that it is every person’s duty to strive and ultimately to win. These ideas are enshrined in what Slotkin describes as America’s frontier myth, in which early settlers conquered the land, pushing back the frontier and civilizing the wilderness. By the early 1960s the only frontiers left to conquer were space and the ocean. Surfers seemed to represent frontiersmen conquering the ﬁnal American frontier. Indeed, in 1958 the Saturday Evening Post noted that surfers represented “the last frontier. Civilization drops behind them when they leave the shore and the beauty and challenge of the great oceans is all around them.”27 Surfers seemed to symbolize the Californian spirit. They were golden people who represented inﬁnite possibility and youthfulness to American mainstream culture. Travel and surﬁng were inexorably linked, and they coalesced in the notion of the surﬁng safari (the “surfari”). Malibu, California, was crucial to the growth and development of surﬁng. Foam technology from the aircraft industry made possible the wider availability of affordable surfboards. Hobie Alter is credited with ﬁrst using foam technology in surfboard production. His aim was to shape a board that could substitute for rare and expensive balsa wood. Alter’s main rival, Dale Velzy at Venice Beach, quickly adopted the foam technology and was so successful that he was able to buy himself a Mercedes.\n\n26 / Joan Ormrod\n\nHis altruism was legendary amongst Californian surfers. He would give good surfers free surfboards and send surfers to international contests in Australia. He gave Bruce Brown his ﬁrst camera and enough money to shoot his ﬁrst ﬁlm, Slippery When Wet (1958). However, ﬁlms were not the only advances in the surf culture. In the early 1960s the ﬁrst major surﬁng magazine, Surfer, appeared, and it solidiﬁed the international surfing community and promoted Californian surf culture. Surfer started in 1961 as a newsletter with a circulation of ten thousand, promoting ﬁlmmaker John Severson’s latest ﬁlm, Surf Fever. The ﬁrst newsletter sold ﬁve thousand copies in Southern California, which inspired Severson to produce the newsletter as a quarterly magazine. Within three months Surfer sold ﬁve thousand copies and became a vital part of surf culture. The magazine was issued bimonthly starting in 1962 and monthly starting in 1976. Initially it promoted the Californian fantasy of the surﬁng lifestyle, featuring articles about surﬁng and travel and highquality surﬁng photography. In 1965, for instance, Fred Wardy claimed that “surﬁng is a release from exploding tensions of twentieth-century living, escape from the hustling, bustling city world of steel and concrete, a return to nature’s reality.”28 Wardy’s comment articulates the romance of the leisure surfer’s escape to the natural, which was to become fully developed with the emergence of the soul surfer of the 1970s. Wardy also expressed the surfer’s “endless search for the windless day, an uncrowded beach, the perfect wave.” Surfer, which became known as “the surfer’s bible,” presented surfers with images of perfect waves six times a year in the early 1960s. In an early editorial, “Surﬁng Is . . . ,” Severson described Surfer as “a dream magazine. I saw that right away. The perfect surf, the faraway places . . . we all dream about the same things.”29 This notion of the daydream is worth discussing here as it is central to consumer and tourist discourse and, in surﬁng, to the perfect wave. Indeed, The Endless Summer could be described as a cinematic realization of Surfer magazine in its evocation of the quest for the perfect wave, a quest that was not predicated on “discovery” so much as “rediscovery.” By the early 1960s, Malibu’s waves had become too crowded. Indeed, whenever a hot new surf spot was discovered, word quickly traveled and it became a nightmare to surf. Matt Warshaw notes that in the 1950s and early 1960s, surf magazines and ﬁlms were quite transparent about the best locations for waves. However:\n\nEndless Summer / 27\n\nDiscovery . . . invited ruin. In the late 1950s, when the “perfect wave” designation ﬂoated above Malibu like a neon sign, surfers were banging off one another in the line-up like heated molecules. To varying degrees, the same would eventually hold true for the Pipeline, Kirra, Jeffreys, Grajagan, and any other spot renowned and cursed as “perfect.” For many surfers . . . the real search for the perfect wave has been less to do with adventure, romance, and the pursuit of new experiences and more with just getting the hell away from what . . . Mickey Dora called “all the surf dopes, ego heroes, rah-rah boys, concessionaires, lifeguards, fags, and ﬁnks.” Surfers on the road didn’t look for anything particularly different. They wanted Malibu (or Kirra, or Grajagan, etc.) without the crowds.30 Indeed, so intense was the pressure on popular surf spots that in the mid1960s Surfer stopped identifying locations. Starting in the late 1950s, Californian surfers began to travel farther aﬁeld on the “surfari” to ﬁnd the perfect wave. However, as Warshaw notes, the aim of the surfari was not to discover new waves but to rediscover waves that surfers already knew. Thus, according to Warshaw, ﬁlms such as The Endless Summer and magazines such as Surfer promoted travel to distant beaches as a dream, a fantasy, a “reality heightened by imagination.”31 Surﬁng is a leisure activity predicated on consumerism. It is the romantic aspect of consumerism that is crucial here, for as Colin Campbell argues, consumerism is based on desire and the possibility of achieving the perfect life through buying and consuming objects or experiences.32 This separates the physical from the imaginary world for the consumer, who “learns to substitute imaginary for real stimuli and by self-consciously creating and manipulating illusions or imaginary experiences or emotions in daydreams and fantasies constructs his or her own pleasurable environment.”33 Images are an important part in the daydream of the perfect life. However, images can never live up to the dream. The idea of vacationing also conjures up an image of the perfect experience, whether in reality or in the images constantly broadcast on television, displayed on the Internet, or printed in newspapers, magazines, and travel brochures. Alluring images also encourage the potential tourist’s daydream: “Names like Waikiki, Nice, Majorca, Acapulco, Bali and Marrakech roll across the page evoking images of sun, pleasure and escape. In a world dominated by bureaucracies and machines, we are offered these destinations as retreats\n\n28 / Joan Ormrod\n\nto a childlike world in which the sun always shines, and we can gratify all our desires.”34 This quotation neatly summarizes many of the notions associated with vacationing. There is the idea that a vacation is a retreat or escape from the routine of everyday life. And there is the notion of a return to childishness and the implicit notion of a return to an Edenic state of innocence, in which tourists can satisfy their whims. These ideas, at their root, coalesce around notions of time and the ways in which time is segmented in modern Western cultures, but the cultural appropriation of space is also signiﬁcant. As Turner and Ash argue, tourism is implicated geographically in the “pleasure periphery,” in which certain geographical locations are designated tourist areas by virtue of their proximity to urban centers. Tourist destinations tend to be two to four hours away from big cities in northern or industrialized nations. Turner and Ash identify the United States’ pleasure periphery as the Caribbean, Latin America (Mexico, Tijuana, Acapulco), and the Paciﬁc Islands. Hawaii became a popular destination for rich American tourists beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. It appealed to the desire for the exotic—for paradise and the simple life. Although Turner and Ash wrote in the mid-1970s, their arguments concerning vacationing remain valid today and are peculiarly appropriate to our discussion of surﬁng and leisure. A further reason for the desire to retreat to an idealized lifestyle is urbanization. Urry notes that, beginning in the late eighteenth century, the growth of urbanization, with its attendant overcrowding and the squalor of city life, induced in city dwellers a wish for escape to a rural idyll.35 Along with romantic sensibilities, increasing urbanization caused city dwellers to desire to return to a rural or idyllic space, a space that might be likened to Eden or Arcadia—in short, a paradise on earth. To this end, tourists might anticipate the vacation, or a daydream about it, using tourist literature to spur their imagination. The imagining of future pleasures is a symptom of modern hedonism: “Pleasure is sought via emotional and not merely sensory stimulation, whilst . . . the images which fulﬁl this function are either imaginatively created or modiﬁed by the individual for self-consumption, there being little reliance upon the presence of ‘real’ stimuli. These two facets mean that modern hedonism tends to be covert and self-illusory; that is to say, individuals employ their imagination and creative powers to construct mental images which they consume for the intrinsic pleasure they provide, a practice best described as day-dreaming or fantasizing.”36 Daydreaming, an integral part of the\n\nEndless Summer / 29\n\nsojourn or tourist experience, depends on the visual and may be induced by vacation brochures, television programs, or other mass media texts.37 Rosengren takes the importance of the visual further in his discussion of the sojourn: “to dwell in a place temporarily or as a stranger, the implication being that once returned to the point of departure the sojourn is of no further consequence.” The “surfari” is a type of sojourn; it is an activity that is based on sensation but that contains many elements of tourism, such as the daydream (which Rosengren describes as the “selfdeparture”). The experience of sojourning is fueled by the rhetoric and images in surf magazines and ﬁlms, which hold out the promise of escape from everyday routine. A “surfari” is a daydream based on consumerism and articulated through media representations. Issues surrounding the romance and daydream implicit in tourism and the appropriation of space recur continuously in The Endless Summer.\n\nThe Endless Summer: Constructing the Known/Unknown The press book for The Endless Summer includes several reviews that praise the ﬁlm. Playboy, for instance, notes: “The Endless Summer is one of the most pleasant and least self-conscious travelogs and sports commentaries to come along in years, a delightful sojourn into surfdom.”38 The opening credits pick up the theme of the title in gold-drenched images of surfboards packed into a car driving toward the sun. Travel is highlighted in the opening credits—a yacht bobs on sun-ﬂecked water, and an airplane ﬂies toward the sun. As the ﬁlm begins in California, Brown contextualizes surf culture, describing the favored type of surf: “Most surfers like to ride a regular board and perform on a medium sized wave.” When Brown suggests the surfer “performs,” he refers to the popularity of the hotdogging style of surﬁng. Hotdogging was a performance style of surﬁng in which the surfer performed maneuvers on the board. The ideal hotdogger wave was the small to medium Malibu wave. Matt Warshaw reinforces the argument that surfers enact both a spectacular and performative identity when he describes hotdogging as “trick riding . . . often on beaches full of onlookers.”39 Brown lists hot surfers of the early 1960s, including Mickey Dora, who at the time was the star of the Malibu medium wave; Phil Edwards, the ﬁrst to surf the Pipeline, Hawaii, whom Brown had starred in his previous ﬁlm, Surﬁng Hollow Days (1961); and Australian Nat Young, who had just won the World Surﬁng Championship in San Diego.40 There is\n\n30 / Joan Ormrod\n\nthe archetypal wipeout and footage of surﬁng in Hawaii, with a list of the most famous waves: the Garbage Hole, Waikiki, and Number 3.41 Brown says that the object of surﬁng is “to remain in the curl, stay as close to the wave without getting caught by it. All the movements in surﬁng, stalling, turning, riding the nose are directed towards the ultimate aim of riding the curl.” There is some slapstick footage of surfers carrying their surfboards and attempting to cross the busy highway, a sequence that demonstrates the overcrowding of the Californian surf. Another negative aspect of Californian surﬁng, according to Brown, is the winter: “The ultimate thing for all of us would be to have an endless summer; the warm water and waves without the summer crowds of California. The only way to do this is to follow the summer season as it moves around the world.” Robert August and Mike Hynson sit in front of a ﬁre one evening planning and daydreaming about such a trip. They consult travel magazines such as National Geographic, read a malaria manual, and browse a book on how to repel shark attacks. The following ninety minutes shows the pair visiting Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Australia, Tahiti, and Hawaii. Each location is stereotyped in a particular way. Brown notes that in Senegal they stamp “sucker” on your forehead, because August and Hynson are forced to stay in a government hotel costing them $30 per day and $1 for coffee. Brown estimates that each wave costs $9.95. However, they convert several “natives” (a term used incessantly by Brown) to surﬁng. In Accra they stay in a small ﬁshing village, the ﬁrst white men ever seen by some of the villagers. Brown stresses the unchanging way of life for thousands of years. Here villagers make canoes from a tree trunk, money is rarely used, and when Hynson and August surf the children quickly make paddleboards for themselves and begin surﬁng. The surf is compared favorably with that at Malibu. The lack of surfers is stressed in the visit to South Africa, where there are only one hundred surfers around the Cape. However, the brotherhood of surﬁng is stressed when all one hundred arrive on the beach to welcome Robert and Mike. Despite the lack of surfers, when Mike and Robert hitchhike outside Durban (“you can wait three days for a car”), they manage to hitch a lift with two passing surfers. In South Africa, defying narrative conventions, Robert and Mike discover the perfect wave just off Cape St. Francis. Brown describes it in typical hyperbole: “so perfect it could be made by a machine . . . so long I couldn’t get most of them [the waves] on one piece of ﬁlm.” The local\n\nEndless Summer / 31\n\nﬁshermen note that the waves in this area are funny-looking things—“like pipes”—and, as Brown asserts, they are like this three hundred days a year. The water temperature here is also perfect—seventy degrees, with a prevailing offshore wind. The wave is so long and perfect that the surfers get cramps in their legs from squatting down in the curl. Brown concludes, “I couldn’t help but think of the hundreds of years these waves must’ve been breaking here but until this day no one had ever ridden one. Thousands of waves must’ve gone to waste right now on Cape St. Francis.” Hyperbole continues in the Australian segment, when Brown, August, and Hynson cannot ﬁnd any waves and are constantly told that they “should have been here last winter.” However, the perfection of New Zealand waves echoes that of South Africa, and on Christmas Day August and Hynson surf in a cove by themselves. Brown says, “I can’t even show you a full ride; it would take the whole second half of the ﬁlm.” The ﬁnal leg of the journey marries the weird with the familiar. In Tahiti, where reputedly there are no waves, the surfers discover well-formed waves. In Papeete waves can be ridden in and out. The ﬁlm climaxes in Hawaii (“good old Hawaii”), the surfers’ spiritual home. Brown demonstrates the art of the ﬁlmmaker when he straps the camera to the front of the board to show the waves from a surfer’s point of view. There are shots of the Pipeline, which is described as “a Roman gladiator’s pit” because of the razor-sharp coral underneath the shallow wave. The spikes can wound or kill. “Any wipeout at the Pipeline in Hawaii is a bad one.” As if to underline this point, a surfer named Bob Pike takes a wipeout and Brown reports that he sustains a broken collarbone and three broken ribs. The board of another surfer, Butch van Arsdale, is broken in two—and, as Brown informs the audience, surfboards are so tough they cannot be broken even if you drive a car over them.42 The ﬁlms ends with Brown’s admonition: “With enough time and money you could spend the rest of your life following the summer around the world.” This describes the wish of many surfers, to have enough free time and money to surf without the routine of work and everyday living. The ﬁlm gives surfers a taste of what such a life might be like.\n\nThe Endless Summer: Surﬁng the Frontier, Selling the Wave The Endless Summer is a documentary, but it is not a documentary in the traditional sense of the genre. It is not a sober and objective narrative. Rather, like all “pure” surf ﬁlms in the early 1960s, it was meant to be\n\n32 / Joan Ormrod\n\nexhibited by its director in front of an enthusiastic surf audience. Brown, like other “four-wall”’ producers, produced, distributed, and presented the ﬁlm, and he would play music from a tape recorder while narrating from his written script. The ﬁlm was meant to “stoke” the audience. It was imperative that something was happening throughout the ﬁlm; there could be no quiet passages. Therefore, Brown disrupted the narrative in reel and real time. So, for instance, while Mike and Robert ﬂew from Africa to Australia, Brown injected interest by showing footage of Hawaii: “While Mike and Robert are on their way to Australia, let’s look at waves in Hawaii.” When they arrived in Australia, he directed the audience to rejoin Robert and Mike. This was obviously a narrative device to prevent boredom in the audience, but it also used up Brown’s excess footage of Hawaii. These ﬂashbacks also served the purpose of reminding surfers of the familiar compared with the unfamiliar, reinforcing the recognition and rediscovery of their own waves through the unfamiliar wave. Pleasure in the past was reﬂected upon and compared with the imperfection of the present. Therefore, when Hynson and August attempted to hitch a lift in Durban, rather than showing several minutes of the isolated African road, Brown took the audience to Newport Beach, California, to “the dirty old Wedge.” He stressed the crowded beach and waves and compared them with the isolation and strangeness of the African road. Similarly, when there was a lull in the waves at Bell’s Beach in Perth, Australia, Rod Sumpter described a surﬁng session he enjoyed with Nat Young in the winter. In Sydney, August and Hynson reﬂected upon the monster waves in Waimea, which had to be ridden on “big gun” surfboards. These three ﬂashbacks contain the juxtaposition of the familiar and the unfamiliar and also an engagement in daydreaming and imagination, an integral part of modern hedonism. In all of three cases, pleasure and the perfection of the imagination, the daydream, is compared with the imperfection of reality. The Endless Summer, however, did not always represent a true picture of what happened on the surfers’ quest for the perfect wave. It glossed over some of the more tedious aspects of production. Each location was represented as containing certain elements. Robert August admitted, “We went to a lot of places [where] there was just nothing.”43 Nevertheless, this aspect of production is not apparent in the ﬁlm’s narrative. For instance, Brown describes how the perfect wave was discovered after a trek across three miles of sand dunes at Cape St. Francis in South Africa. Narrative\n\nEndless Summer / 33\n\ntension is built up when Brown comments that the odds of ﬁnding a perfect wave were ten million to one. The ﬁlm shows the surfers on top of a sand dune looking down on the ocean, and Brown says, “They ﬁnally got their ﬁrst look at St. Francis, South Africa.” The camera then shows the perfect wave. Brown built up tension and the “stoke” in the audience by selling them the wave in South Africa—a wave so perfect it looked like it was made by a machine, so long it could not be contained on one ﬁlm. “I timed them in the curl for forty-ﬁve seconds.” Brown exhorts surfers to visit South Africa by reminding them of the wasted opportunities to ride this perfect wave: “Out of a whole day’s surﬁng . . . each wave was perfect.” Indeed, he compares this wave with Malibu and Rincorn, concluding, “And it’s better every day.” Selling the wave to American surfers through the pure surf ﬁlm commodiﬁed it just as much as the exploitation ﬁlms commodiﬁed surﬁng. Indeed, The Endless Summer shared many of its values with the image of “clean teens.” The two stars of the ﬁlm, Robert August and Mike Hynson, were typical middle-class, clean-cut youth. At the airport they dressed in suits, their hair was neatly cut, and they were respectful to their elders. In a scene in Africa, they call the village chief “sir.” They were, at the same time, ambassadors of American youth and frontiersmen venturing into the wilderness and colonizing waves in undiscovered territories.44 Further, their exploration of the unknown wave was only made possible by increasingly cheap airfares in the early sixties. The Endless Summer articulates issues surrounding the American frontier myth that is encapsulated in consumerism and tourism discourses. These issues recur throughout the ﬁlm in binaries such as the known/ unknown, named/unnamed, exotic/familiar, and crowds/isolation. Brown begins the ﬁlm with an account of the crowds on the beaches of Malibu and Hawaii. The theme of the crowd was juxtaposed with that of isolation and the notion of the idyllic ride in locations around the world. For instance, on Christmas Day, when August and Hynson surfed by themselves in New Zealand on what is an extremely long wave, Brown notes that eventually the ride became so long that August and Hynson resorted to chatting with each other as a means of diverting boredom. Obviously this was an exaggeration aimed at selling the unknown and, more importantly, the uncrowded wave so desired by frustrated American surfers. As if to emphasize the point, Brown juxtaposed footage of crowds on the beach at “the dirty old Wedge” in California with an empty highway in Durban,\n\n34 / Joan Ormrod\n\nSouth Africa (“one of the few places in the world you can be alone on a main highway”). Of the beaches in South Africa, Brown states, “Most beaches haven’t been set foot on for ten years.” The crowds/isolation theme was intimately linked with that of the exotic (elsewhere) and the familiar (the United States). Throughout the ﬁlm, California and Hawaii are continuously contrasted with unknown and exotic locations through ﬂashbacks. California is positioned as the physical home of surﬁng, Hawaii (described as “good old Hawaii” by Brown) as the spiritual home of surﬁng. August and Hynson traveled to Hawaii on the last leg of their journey, in effect, travelling from the familiar to the familiar, from home to “paradise on earth.” Brown concludes, “Hawaii is truly a land of an endless summer.” Throughout the ﬁlm Brown refers back to California in terms of time or distance. For instance, in Dakata, Senegal, Brown states, “Here they were only four hours off an airplane from the United States and already into better surf than the day they left California.” Time and space is conﬂated through the act of riding the wave: “They rode those waves knowing they were the ﬁrst to ever do it and also knowing the closest surfer to them was four thousand miles away.” August and Hynson are portrayed in this segment of the ﬁlm as civilizing inﬂuences, akin to the civilizing inﬂuence of Europe on the United States after Columbus. They descended like gods into a primitive village in Ghana—so primitive that money was unknown and goods were obtained by barter or exchange. They were the ﬁrst white men ever seen by many of the villagers. As missionaries in Hawaii, they set about spreading the good word—in this case, the good word was explicitly about surﬁng and implicitly about capitalism. They established a surf school to teach children how to surf. The children quickly took to this new pastime, making paddleboards so they could surf the waves.45 Adults enjoyed surﬁng too, and one attempted to surf in his outrigger canoe in a style similar to that of early surﬁng in the Paciﬁc Islands. The wilderness, uncultivated and unshaped, is evoked in descriptions of the unknown surf spot. A wave with ideal conditions in Durban, South Africa, “doesn’t even have a name.” In Dakata, Senegal, Brown describes “surf that no one had ever ridden before, and as far as we know, surf that no one ever knew before.” Brown gives these unnamed surf spots names, names that in some cases remain to this day. In Tahiti, for instance, a wave was named “The Other Spot,” a title designed to be as obscure as the location. It is worth\n\nEndless Summer / 35\n\nnoting that the names Brown gave to a particular spot might overlay names given to these places by local people. The renaming is reminiscent of Columbus’s claiming and naming islands for the Spanish throne.46 In claiming symbolic ownership of the wilderness for surﬁng and America, Brown’s naming of the waves echoes a colonial enterprise. Another aspect of the known/unknown binary relates to the representation of the surfers whom August and Hynson encountered. When the duo visited South Africa, all one hundred local surfers, some from as far as four hundred miles away, descended on the beach and surfed with them. Brown suggests that surfers are part of a global tribe, sharing the waves and a special brotherhood. However, the difference between different surf cultures is also noted. South African surfers tended to be older than Californian surfers. Australian surfers were of similar age but were very competitive with the “Yanks”—a phenomenon that became signiﬁcant with the advent of the shortboard revolution within two years of the making of The Endless Summer.47 The quest for the perfect wave did not aim to discover the unknown; rather, it aimed to recreate the known. The constant comparison between waves in Lagos, Senegal, and Cape St. Francis and waves in California and Hawaii reﬂects the search for a new Waimea or Malibu. Just as surfers the world over were similar to but different than Californian surfers, so the waves were also continuously compared to already known waves in California and Hawaii. In Sydney the lack of waves and ﬂat conditions were juxtaposed with the mountainous waves of Waimea in Hawaii, which were ﬁrst ridden in 1958 after surfers spent ten years looking at them. In an analogy to hunting, Brown notes that these waves needed special surfboards—“big guns”—and were surfed by “only a handful of surfers . . . sportsmen and nuts.” In these dangerous waves the ﬂailing surfboard could cut you in half. For this reason surfers dove away from their boards in a wipeout. The water temperature was also compared with “home”—in South Africa it was ﬁfty-four degrees, while Lagos’s ninety-one degrees was so warm that “it melted the wax right off the surfboards.” What is of note here, however, is that until 1958 this wave had not been ridden or given a name. When it was named and tamed, surfers, usually American surfers, claimed it as theirs. Unknown waves could be dangerous, and Brown constantly stresses the importance of surﬁng with a friend in strange waters. It was not only the waves that were dangerous but also what lurked beneath them. In\n\n36 / Joan Ormrod\n\nAustralia and South Africa beaches are cordoned off from shark attack. In Australia, sharks are known as “the men in grey.” In South Africa, when the sinister grey ﬁns are seen cutting the surface of the water where Hynson and August are surﬁng, Brown warns that despite netting, there is a ﬁfty/ﬁfty chance you would be killed by a shark. However, the danger is mitigated later, when the sharks are identiﬁed as porpoises. Brown turns this into a political statement, noting that porpoises and sharks do not swim in the same waters. “They have yet to integrate.” In addition to sharks in Lagos, there was the hazard of the stoneﬁsh: “If you step on a stone ﬁsh, you die in about ﬁfteen minutes.” In the global quest for the perfect wave, Brown, August, and Hynson made known the unknown and incorporated locations and waves into American culture. It was a culture based on consumerism. A quest for the perfect wave could not have been made by a subcultural surﬁng group from any society other than the United States—and speciﬁcally, California—at the time. All the conditions for such a journey were in place within this speciﬁc sociohistorical moment. In addition to being a journey of exploration and adventure, it was a journey of colonization and incorporation of other surfers and waves into American surf culture. It afﬁrmed U.S. dominance of global surﬁng at the time and was a crucial component in the popularity of the ﬁlm with surﬁng and non-surﬁng audiences.\n\nNotes 1.

Nathan\n\nDaniel A. Nathan\n\n“I’m Against It!” The Marx Brothers’ Horse Feathers as Cultural Critique; or, Why Big-Time College Football Gives Me a Haddock Fast-paced and witty, antiauthoritarian and anarchic, the Marx Brothers’ Horse Feathers (1932) is a seriously funny ﬁlm. More than seventy years after it was released, it continues to evoke laughter—not just because it is a timeless “classic” but also because it is still timely. Its objects of ridicule are still with us—academic pretentiousness and inanity, and the hypocrisy and foolishness of institutions of higher education chasing gridiron glory. In other words, Horse Feathers was and is more than “the mere antics of funny men” and “pure clowning,” as one reviewer noted when the ﬁlm was in theaters.1 On the contrary, its “peculiar brand of lunacy” had some well-recognized and well-deserved targets.2 As critic Richard Rowland remarked in 1947 when praising the Marx Brothers, “the ﬁnest comedian in the world cannot be funny without something to be funny about.”3 College life in the early 1930s, especially big-time college football, provided the Marx Brothers and their writers with rich material, an opportunity to have a good time and to produce a commercially successful product but also to do widely accessible cultural criticism, albeit via a mélange that was “part vaudeville, part theater of the absurd, part surrealistic satire,” rather than a cogent, carefully documented critique.4 This essay aspires to the latter, and I can hear some people now: Do we really need or want to think critically about something that’s as much fun as Horse Feathers? Obviously critiquing a text does not diminish it or the pleasure it gives us, but isn’t it a mistake to take something like a Marx Brothers ﬁlm seriously? Apparently at least one of the Marx Brothers thought so, for historian Lawrence W. Levine notes that “Groucho Marx\n\n“I’m Against It!” / 41\n\nwas amused at the professors who professed to see signiﬁcance in the routines he did with his brothers, when in fact they were just improvising without any grand purpose, just trying to make people laugh.”5 Laughter can be its own reward, and there is some truth to Groucho’s claim. After all, the Marx Brothers were ﬁrst and foremost trying to be amusing, and they were not cultural critics in the same way that a contemporary like Reinhold Niebuhr was. Moreover, one needs to be mindful that the last thing most comedians want is to be taken seriously. They usually want to be taken humorously, which is ﬁne and does not preclude the fact that comedy, like other forms of popular culture, is a practice or discourse that can also be a trenchant form of cultural criticism, a way of promoting critical thought about myriad subjects. It may come as a surprise to some, but Horse Feathers (a phrase that means nonsense or foolishness) did and does just that, even though the social world the ﬁlm creates is bizarre and, thankfully, far from realistic.6 The movie’s plot, as with most Marx Brothers ﬁlms, is uncomplicated and not particularly noteworthy per se.7 The following synopsis elides most of the events that do not have much bearing on the ﬁlm’s portrayal of college life and football, like the famous and still wonderfully funny “swordﬁsh” speakeasy scene.8 The ﬁlm begins in an auditorium where Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho Marx) is introduced as Huxley College’s new president. (Why Huxley would hire the roguish Wagstaff is hard to imagine, but it is a Marx Brothers ﬁlm so viewers know they must suspend their disbelief.) Wagstaff’s inaugural speech is impertinent and snappily delivered, riddled with non sequiturs and ridicule for the trustees, administrators, students, and faculty. Early in his speech, Wagstaff explains that he has come to Huxley to save his son Frank (Zeppo Marx), a student who has been at the school for twelve years, partly because he has been fooling around with Connie Bailey (Thelma Todd), the “college widow” (a non-college woman “who makes a habit of going with students”).9 Soon thereafter, Wagstaff bursts into song, which is as anti-intellectual and nihilistic as it is funny, and includes the lyrics: I don’t know what they have to say It makes no difference anyway Whatever it is, I’m against it. No matter what it is or who commenced it, I’m against it!10\n\n42 / Daniel A. Nathan\n\nFilm critic Allen Eyles asserts that this song “sums up the Marx Brothers’ attitude toward life—irreverent, comic and fearless.”11 The next scene features Wagstaff and his wayward son, who explains that Huxley has had a new president every year since 1888, the same year the school’s football team last won a game. Despite his knee-jerk opposition to new ideas, Wagstaff is convinced (why is a mystery) that it is important for Huxley to ﬁeld a football team that can beat rival school Darwin. So, on Frank’s advice, Wagstaff recruits two “ringers” who hang out at a speakeasy. Unfortunately, the real football players, Mullen and McCarthy, a couple of thugs, have already been hired to play for Darwin, and thus Wagstaff mistakenly retains and enrolls misﬁts Baravelli (Chico Marx), an iceman and bootlegger, and his sidekick Pinky (Harpo Marx), a mute dogcatcher. By any measure, they are an athletically and intellectually challenged duo. Meanwhile, Connie Bailey, the ﬂirtatious college widow, who is in cahoots with the unethical Darwin ﬂunky (is he a school ofﬁcial? a booster?) who hired the ringers, tries to get the Huxley football signals from Wagstaff, but to no avail. Once Wagstaff ﬁnds out that Darwin has beaten him to the real players, he enlists Baravelli and Pinky to kidnap them. No more adept as kidnappers than as college students or football players, Baravelli and Pinky are held captive by Mullen and McCarthy, who lock the inept pair in their apartment before they leave to play in the Huxley-Darwin game. In spite of themselves, Baravelli and Pinky manage to escape and make it to the game, which is in progress. Huxley comes from behind and wins the game, thanks to a series of chaotic on-ﬁeld events, including the use of a huge rubber band attached to the end of a football, several dozen banana peels, and a horse-drawn garbage wagon/chariot. In the ﬁlm’s ﬁnal scene, Wagstaff, Baravelli, and Pinky simultaneously marry (and then maul) Connie, apparently as a reward for Huxley’s gridiron victory.12 Horse Feathers was a critical and commercial success, but before discussing those subjects I want to make an obvious though important point: the ﬁlm did not make itself. This is worth mentioning because, as historian George Lipsitz puts it, sometimes people seem to underestimate or forget “the origins and intentions of the messages we encounter through the mass media; sometimes we forget that artists have origins or intentions at all, so pervasive are the stimuli around us.”13 So besides the Marx Brothers, who made Horse Feathers? What is its production history? The children of German-Jewish immigrants, the Marx Brothers did\n\n“I’m Against It!” / 43\n\nnot go to college. Thanks in part to an aggressive mother, they learned their craft on vaudeville stages, graduated to musical comedy, and made their ﬁrst ﬁlm, The Cocoanuts, in 1929. They made two more movies, Animal Crackers (1930) and Monkey Business (1931), before Horse Feathers. Years earlier, the Mar"
