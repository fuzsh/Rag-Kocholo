        "text": "Synopsis by author David Mitchell: “An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.”\n\n***\n\nOne viewing isn’t sufficient for a comprehensive “review” of a movie like this. Like Roger Ebert, who called Cloud Atlas “one of the most ambitious films ever made,” I knew before it was half over that I wanted to watch it again. Different critics have praised and panned the movie. I want to offer a brief synopsis and weigh in with a solid two thumbs up.\n\nIt’s harder to move around in time in movies than in books. Inception 2010, notably altered the linear flow of time, with four levels of dreaming that unfolded simultaneously, yet fundamentally it was structured as a frame-tale. Scheherazade did the same thing centuries ago in the The Arabian Nights.\n\nBritish author, David Mitchell tried something more ambitious in his novel, Cloud Atlas 2004. Six stories take place in different times and places, with implications that past, present, and future interconnect in ways that are too complex for a linear narrative. For one thing, Mitchell says that the main characters in the different tales that bear an unusual birthmark are reincarnations of the same character. Somni~451, the clone-turned-visionary in the dystopian future scene voices what I take to be the core theme of the movie: “Separation is an illusion. All our lives are interconnected.”\n\nCounter to what I expected, the different stories were not hard to follow. Anyone interested in fresh ways of imagining novels and movies should not miss Cloud Atlas. I’m pretty sure you’ll want to see it more than once.\n\nRate this:\n\nLast night, I gave up five innings of the Giants National League pennant victory to watch the presidential debate.\n\nI sacrificed the five run 3d inning in hopes of hearing the candidates answer a single question that moderator, Bob Shieffer, asked about 40 minutes in: “What is your vision of America’s place in the world?”\n\nSeconds later, a voice-over interrupted with tornado warnings for several counties north of here. By the time it ended, the candidates were talking about the economy. I waited for Shieffer to lead them back to the question he’d asked, but it never happened. Same old, same old, I guess – the same dysfunctional vision I wrote about in January, in a post called, “Sabre-rattling over oil: better get used to it.” http://wp.me/pYql4-1AT\n\nThis was the first of several posts about the ideas of Col. Andrew Bacevich, a Vietnam veteran, West Point graduate, and currently a professor of History and International Relations at Boston University. Like George McGovern, the first man I ever voted for as president, who died earlier this month, Bacevich is a warrior who hates warfare.\n\nBacevich pulls no punches in The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism (reviewed here http://wp.me/pYql4-2kX).\n\nRereading key passages recently, Bacevich’s anger became even more apparent – the anger of a patriot who sees his country sliding down a slippery slope to disaster. His core thesis is that in turning away from President Carter’s 1980 call for energy independence – never mind the lip-service it gets every four years – the United States has squandered lives and wealth in a hopeless series of wars aimed at compelling the rest of the world to play by our economic rules:\n\n“For the United States the pursuit of freedom, as defined in an age of consumerism, has induced a condition of dependence – on imported goods, on imported oil, and on credit. The chief desire of the American people, whether they admit it or not, is that nothing should disrupt their access to those goods, oil, and credit…The chief aim of the U.S. government is to satisfy that desire, which it does in part through the distribution of largesse at home…and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad.”\n\nBacevich argues that the status quo benefits those in power in Washington:\n\n“…rather than addressing the problem of dependence, members of our political class seem hell-bent on exacerbating the problem…To hard-core nationalists and neoconservatives, the acceptance of limits suggests retrenchment or irreversible decline. In fact, the reverse is true. Acknowledging the limits of American power is a precondition for stanching the losses of recent decades and for preserving the hard-won gains of earlier generations going back to the founding of the Republic.”\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Bill Moyers, Bacevich said, “I happen to define myself as a conservative,” yet when you read his prescription for addressing the ills he enumerates, they parallel those of Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for president. Moyers interviewed Stein on September 7: http://billmoyers.com/segment/jill-stein-and-cheri-honkala-on-third-party-politics/\n\nDr. Stein graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Medical School, and has specialized in environmental health. She got her start in politics with a successful effort to pass a referendum to reform election spending in Massachusetts. Reality set in when the Democratically controlled legislature overturned the people’s will in an unrecorded vote.\n\nBoth mainstream presidential candidates refer to their “plans” to create jobs, though they haven’t offered specifics. Stein has a plan too: cut defense spending in half and use the money to fund a “Green WPA” which would train and employ many of those now unemployed to work toward true energy independence.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Moyers, Bacevich answered the obvious objection that cutting defense spending would jeopardize national security. Those persons and groups that wish us harm are ““akin to a criminal conspiracy…Rooting out and destroying the conspiracy is primarily the responsibility of organizations like the FBI, and of our intelligence community, backed up at times by Special Operations Forces. That doesn’t require invading and occupying countries.” Events last year proved him correct.\n\n***\n\nWhat chance do ideas like these have of making it into the mainstream? Little or none at present, but I don’t think that is the point. Ideas rooted in reality can be seeds that sprout over time. The first Earth Day was a peripheral event, but it has picked up momentum every since.\n\nBacevich repeatedly stresses that not all limits are bad, and despite the title of his book, affirms that he does believe in American exceptionalism “if American exceptionalism implies that there are certain qualities that make the United States of America a special place, a wonderful place– a place worthy of a patriot’s love.”\n\nIn the course of their critiques, both Bacevich and Stein affirm that it’s love of country and citizens that motivates their efforts to change what’s broken.\n\nAfter all, what other nation on earth could have invented the World Series?\n\nRate this:\n\nYesterday, I struck up a conversation with another San Francisco Giants fan about the possible conflict between the National League Championship Series and Monday’s Presidential Debate. The Giants are down three games to two. If they pull off a win tonight, the final game will be Monday.\n\nLater, considering which program I want to watch vs. the one I should watch, I thought of how clear it’s become to me that this election is not about the candidates themselves, but about the visions, or perhaps more accurately, the stories about America they embody. Most people seem less than thrilled by the candidates themselves, but everyone takes the stories seriously.\n\nA high school history teacher planted the seeds of this understanding decades ago. At the time of another presidential election, he suggested that most voters are swayed by an image of times past, a story of “the good old days,” which probably never existed. He argued that the imagination of the conservatives of his day echoed the television show, Bonanza.\n\nBen Cartwright and his three sons carved a fine spread out of the wilderness – they did it on their own, by the sweat of their own brows, thank you very much. The only hint of government was the Virginia City sheriff, and generally the Cartwrights told him what to do and not vice versa.\n\nIn a similar manner, liberals dream of Kennedy’s “Camelot” and its precursor, The New Deal. For the generation that came of age during The Great Society and the War on Poverty, “less government” is a codeword for Charles Dickens’ London: “Are there no prisions? Are there no workhouses?”\n\nAnd whenever you hear a politician of any persuasion invoke “family values,” you can bet their story embodies the world of Norman Rockwell. Anyone grow up in a family like this?\n\nWe’re dealing with powerful stuff here – nothing drives us more than our dreams, which means we need to be careful. I liked Bonanza and still enjoy Norman Rockwell, but I try not to bring them into the voting booth. Kids learn how to separate dreams from the world of make-believe: they know that “I want to be a doctor” is different from “I want to fly like Super-man.” What kids know, politicians seem to forget.\n\nTomorrow night, the presidential candidates are scheduled to discuss “foreign policy.” Webster’s Dictionary defines policy as, “1. wise, expedient, or prudent conduct or management. 2. a principle, plan, or course of action, as pursued by a government, organization, or individual, etc.”\n\nI expect to hear a story that goes like this: “We are number one and if you want to keep it that way, vote for me.” I’m not so sure we’ll hear much about policy, aka, “wise, expedient, or prudent conduct or management.” For that we often have to look to outsiders.\n\nI’ve done precisely that over the last few months, and was startled to find a clear and feasible foreign policy articulated with very similar features from both a liberal and a conservative point of view. There’s a beautiful story in there too, one involving national renewal through shared effort and dedication. A dream, to be sure, but it doesn’t require Superman. This will be the topic of a post in the coming week.\n\nMeanwhile, though I’ll be watching the debate, I’ll have my phone set to the instant scoreboard app. “The Giants are number one,” is a dream that could happen, but if Superman is listening, we’re not above asking for help!\n\n*** Update, Sunday Night ***\n\nThe Giants won, 6-1, so there will be a game 7!\n\nRate this:\n\nIt took me a while to get the gist of Njal’s Saga. The first time through, I could have used a Cast of Characters; much of the effort was just keeping track of people whose names I couldn’t pronounce. In rereading key sections aloud with the group in Iceland – the mode of presentation the author intended – the drama and human passion began to emerge. And as I read these passages again while writing posts for this blog, a larger picture appeared.\n\nNjal’s story is framed by the end of an era. The best minds of the time made wrong decisions and couldn’t hold back the tides that swept outworn institutions away. The suffering was intense and the body count was high. “Things fall apart, the center cannot hold,” said Yeats at a similar time.\n\nAs I read of the battle at Thingvellir, a moment of near civil war, I kept thinking of similar periods. Of the fall of Troy, the Mahabharata war, the end of the Roman Empire, and the “great war” in Europe. And I thought of our own time, that Andrew Bacevich likens to the period of the Peloponnesian War, when the Athenian empire bled itself dry. We know our current mode of living cannot be sustained. We know that our leaders don’t have the wisdom the times demand, and like Matthew Arnold, we find ourselves, “Wandering between two worlds, one dead the other powerless to be born.”\n\nDoes Njal’s Saga offer any insight for times like these?\n\nNot directly, for simple platitudes would be of no help. It does offer up a number of vivid characters, some of whom manifest courage and generosity in the face of disaster, and others whose self-centered designs bring the disasters about. We can’t help but ask ourselves who we want to emulate. And something very interesting happens at the end of the tale.\n\nBy the end of the saga, Kari, who survived the killing of Njal, and Flosi, the chieftan who led the killers, have hunted and fought each other across Iceland, Scotland, and Ireland. Both crossed Europe on foot to seek absolution in Rome.\n\nFlosi returns to Iceland first. Kari’s ship is wrecked on the coast in a winter storm, though his crew survives. They wash up near Flosi’s homestead, and make their way there during a blizzard. When they arrive, the saga tells us Flosi recognized Kari at once and “jumped up to meet him and kissed him, and then placed him in the high seat by his side. He invited Kari to stay there for the winter. Kari accepted. They made a full reconciliation. Flosi gave Kari the hand of his brother’s daughter, Hildigunn.”\n\nThe next summer, Flosi set out for Norway in a ship in bad condition, that he said was “good enough for an old man doomed to die.” The ship was never seen again. Kari named one of his sons, Flosi, and this Flosi’s son grew up to be “the most distinguished man of that line.”\n\nMarriages like this, in folklore and myth, are never one dimensional affairs – a sacred marriage also takes place that brings new life to our broken world. The Pandava line survives the Mahabharata war, and Aeneas leads the survivors out of Troy. Monks on the coast of Ireland preserve the wisdom of Rome, and poppies grow in Flanders field.\n\nFor the rest of us, who won’t see a new dawn anytime soon, we can remember the words of Tolkien, who was inspired by the sagas of Iceland as he wove his own account of surviving Mordor, a hell he experienced first-hand at the Battle of the Somme.\n\n“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” Frodo tells Gandalf.\n\n“So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the times we are given.”\n\nRate this:\n\nIn order to follow this discussion, it will help if you’ve read two earlier posts:\n\nNjal’s Saga, an Introduction: http://wp.me/pYql4-2sS\n\nNjal’s Saga, part 2: http://wp.me/pYql4-2tb\n\nScholars suggest that the author wove together two separate stories, an oral “Gunnar’s Saga,” and a related but distinct, “Njal’s Saga.” Both men die during attacks on their homes. Historically 18 years passed between the events; Gunnar died in 992 and Njal around 1010. In the last third of the saga, Njal’s son-in-law, Kari, mounts a campaign of revenge against the killers which threatens the stability of the nation. A pitched battle breaks out at the Althing, the National Assembly, which was sacred ground where fighting was forbidden. When reconciliation finally comes, it signifies the dawn of new vision of life and its purpose.\n\nOnce the saga gets going, certain scenes come alive like movies – I know there’s a screenplay here…\n\n***\n\nSoon after Gunnar and Hallgerd were married, they attended a feast with Njal and his wife, Bergthora. In no time, the two women were at each other’s throat. The insults grew so extreme that Gunnar dragged Hallgerd out of the hall. Soon after that, she had one of Bergthora’s slaves killed. Bergthora paid her back in kind, initiating a feud that escalated and took the life of free retainers and then kinsmen on both sides.\n\nThe killings took place while the husbands were at the Althing which convened for two weeks every summer. Aside from social activities, this was the time for legal action on matters the lower courts couldn’t settle. It was also where “compensation” for killings was determined.\n\nIf you killed a man, even in self defense, you confessed it in front of witnesses. A hidden killing was treated as murder and could result in exile for life. A killing confessed was manslaughter and terms of compensation could be set: a slave was worth seven ounces of silver, a freeman fifteen, and a kinsman as much as 200. It may seem cold, but the system was designed to break the cycles of revenge that the old ethic of “honor” and blood retribution entailed.\n\nGunnar and Njal tried to keep up with the legalities of the killings-for-hire their wives initiated, but it became harder as stakes were raised. Each killing drew more people, bound by family and friendship, into the feud. Into this deadly mix came Mord Valgardsson, son of Unn, who despised Gunnar and Njal.\n\nIf Hallgerd spawned chaos and harm, she did so in a half-unconscious manner. She was reactive, without clear designs or premeditation. Mord, by contrast, was cunning, able to weave elaborate snares for his enemies. Our tour leader, Robert Willhelm, pointed out the similarity of Mord’s name to Mordred, King Arthur’s son and nemesis.\n\nDuring a famine, Hallgerd sent a servant to steal food from a man who refused to sell any to her husband. When Gunnar, with his concept of honor, discovered the theft, he slaped his wife, who had already buried two husbands who hit her. Hallgerd warned Gunnar that she would never forget the blow.\n\nNjal prophesied that if Gunnar killed two members of the same family and broke the legal settlement for the killings, he would die soon after. Through trickery, Mord ensured that Gunnar killed the son of a man he’d already slain. In addition to a financial settlement for the killing, the Althing court sentenced Gunnar to three years in exile.\n\nIn one of the most poignant scenes, as Gunnar and his brother rode to the harbor, Gunnar’s horse slipped while fording a river. Springing off the horse, Gunnar looked back at his farm and said, “Lovely is the hillside – never has it seemed so lovely to me as now, with its pale fields and mown meadows, and I will ride back home and not leave.”\n\nThat autumn, Mord sent word that Gunnar was home alone and 40 of his enemies mounted an attack. Firing arrows from the second floor, Gunnar killed two assailants and wounded eight. Then a man named Thorbrand got close enough to cut Gunnar’s bowstring.\n\nGunnar turned to his wife and asked for two strands of her waist length hair for a new bowstring. Hallgerd said, “Does anything depend on it?”\n\n“My life depends on it,” Gunnar said, “for they’ll never be able to get me as long as I can use my bow.”\n\n“Then I’ll recall,” she said, “the slap you gave me, and I don’t care whether you hold out for a long or short time.”\n\nGunnar wounded eight more attackers before he finally fell, exhausted and wounded in fifteen places. One of the attackers said, “His defense will be remembered as long as this land is lived in.”\n\nGunnar’s mother was ready to kill Hallgerd who fled the house. Gunnar’s friends raised a burial mound, and one night, as two of Njal’s sons passed by, they saw the mound open. Four lights shone and cast no shadows. The brothers heard Gunnar’s spirt sounding content as it spoke skaldic verse.\n\n***\n\nGunnar embodied the old warrior ideal of life and death with honor that won you a place in Valhalla. The dark side of this ethos was an unending string of killings that threatened the nation itself. Things were about to change. Shortly after Gunnar’s death, a Christian missionary named Thangbrand arrived in Iceland. He wasn’t the sort of evangelist you want on your doorstep, since he carried a crucifix in one hand and a sword in the other and didn’t much care which he used.\n\nOne autumn morning, as Thangbrand celebrated mass, a man named Hall of Sida approached. “In whose memory are you celebrating this day?” he asked.\n\n“The angel Michael’s,” Thangbrand said.\n\n“What features does this angel have?” Hall asked.\n\n“Many,” said Thanbrand. “He weighs everything that you do, both good and evil, and he is so merciful that he gives more weight to what is well done.”\n\nHall said, “I would like to have him for my friend.”\n\nWith his openness to new ideas and the simple way he voices his spiritual longing, Hall becomes the first convert. In 999 or 1000, the Althing declared Christianity to be the new religion. Mord continued to work behind the scenes fomenting trouble for Njal and his sons, and around the year 1010, 100 armed men attacked Njal’s home and burned it, with him and most of his family inside. Only Kari of Orkney, Njal’s son in law, escaped. He raised a force to attack the burners, and at the next Althing, when the retribution process broke down, a pitched battle erupted at Thingvellir, the spiritual heart of the nation.\n\nDuring a lull in the fighting, members of the assembly intervened to arrange a truce. Hall of Sida stood between the combatants and said, “All men know what sorrow the death of my son Ljot has brought me. Many will expect payment for his life will be higher than for the others who have died here. But for the sake of a settlement I’m willing to let my son like without compensation, and what’s more, offer both pledges and peace to my adversaries.”\n\nThings have changed. A few decades earlier, such a statement would have cost Hall his honor, but the saga says that when he sat down, “much good was spoken about his words, and everybody praised his goodwill.”\n\nThe combatants submitted to judgement. Cash payments were levied as well as three years exile from Iceland for the combatants. During the exile, they slew each other in Orkney and along the coast of Ireland, but finally, when the leaders returned to Iceland, they pledged friendship to each other. The old ways had cost too much in blood and suffering. The survivors had no stomach for anymore fighting. The saga ends with a sense that a new wind was blowing through the land.\n\nNext: reflections on the story.\n\nRate this:"
