        "text": "Here’s another “hand over your badge and your gun” moment, but without a badge or a gun. It comes from the movie Chariots of Fire, which won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay in 1981.\n\nI cite this to illustrate the “hero’s journey” beat in so many novels and movies, in which the hero is stripped of his institutional approval, in whatever form that may take, and must make the choice to continue his journey entirely on his own hook.\n\nTo set the stage:\n\nHarold Abrahams (Chariots of Fire is a true story, by the way, and Abrahams a true historical character) is a Cambridge undergraduate slated to run in the hundred-meter dash at the 1924 Olympics. He’s also a Jew, experiencing all the subtle and not-so-subtle prejudices we might imagine in that era in an institution that represents the centuries-old soul of the English class system.\n\nIn one scene, Abrahams is summoned to dinner with the Master of his college at Cambridge (Caius College, pronounced “keys”) played by Lindsay Anderson and the Master of Trinity College, played by Sir John Gielgud—both at their stuffy Old English best. Abrahams himself is played by Ben Cross. The three men meet in the Masters’ Rooms, a book-lined Gothic setting radiating history and tradition. All are attired formally.\n\nWhy has Abrahams been called on the carpet? It takes a few minutes before the two Masters get to the point.\n\nTRINITY\n\nAbrahams, I’m afraid there is a growing suspicion\n\nin the bosom of the University that in your enthusiasm\n\nto succeed, you have, perhaps, lost sight of [Cambridge’s\n\nloftiest traditions.]\n\nABRAHAMS\n\nMay I ask what form this disloyalty takes?\n\nCAIUS\n\nIt’s been said you use a personal coach.\n\nHAROLD\n\nMr. Mussabini, yes.\n\nCAIUS\n\nDo I take it that you employ Mr. Mussabini on a\n\nprofessional basis?\n\nHAROLD\n\nSam Mussabini is the finest, most advanced, clearest\n\nthinking athletics coach in the country. I am honored\n\nthat he considers me worthy of his complete attention.\n\nCAIUS\n\nNevertheless, he’s a professional.\n\nHAROLD\n\nWhat else would he be, he’s the best!\n\nTRINITY\n\nAh, well there, Mr. Abrahams, I’m afraid our paths\n\ndiverge. The University believes that the way of the\n\namateur can produce the most gratifying results.\n\nHAROLD\n\nI am an amateur!\n\nTRINITY\n\n(suddenly vitriolic)\n\nYou are trained by a professional. You have adopted a\n\nprofessional attitude. For the past year you have\n\nconcentrated wholly on developing your own technique,\n\nin the headlong pursuit, may I suggest, of individual glory.\n\nHAROLD\n\nI am a Cambridge man first and last. I am an Englishman\n\nfirst and last. What I have achieved, what I intend to achieve,\n\nis for my family, my university, and my country, and I\n\nbitterly resent your suggesting otherwise.\n\nCAIUS\n\nMy boy, your approach has been, shall we say, a little\n\ntoo plebeian. You are the elite, and, as such, must be seen\n\nto run rather to the manner born.\n\nHAROLD\n\nWould you prefer I played the amateur — and lost?\n\nCAIUS\n\nTo playing the tradesman? Yes!\n\nAbrahams regards the two Dons—petrified, as they are, in a bygone age. He stands. He extends his hand to Caius.\n\nHAROLD\n\nThank you, sir! The evening has been most illuminating.\n\n(to Trinity)\n\nAnd good-night to you, sir!\n\nAbrahams starts toward the door, then turns and faces back.\n\nHAROLD\n\nYou know, gentlemen, you yearn for victory just as I do.\n\nBut achieved with the apparent effortlessness of gods.\n\nYours are the archaic values of the Prep School play-\n\nground. You deceive no one but yourselves. I believe\n\nin the relentless pursuit of excellence — and I shall\n\ncarry the future with me!!\n\nCaius and Trinity watch Abrahams exit. Trinity turns to Caius.\n\nTRINITY\n\nThere goes your Semite, Hugh. A different God.\n\nA different mountaintop.\n\nSee how Abrahams has been called on the carpet and ordered to “hand over his badge and his gun”?\n\nPrior to this scene, Abrahams had trained and competed believing he did so with the blessing of his college and his university. He felt like a fully-vetted Englishman competing under the banner of his beloved native land.\n\nBy the time he exits this evening, however (even though he did not hear the “Semite/mountaintop” comment), Abrahams feels that the scales have fallen from his eyes. He realizes that he will never be accepted, at least not by the deeply conservative masters of his universe, as a true Englishman and member of the elect. He will always be, by one definition or another, “the tradesman.”\n\nIn hero’s journey terms, the stakes have gone way up in this scene. Abrahams’ inclusion among the elite has been jerked out from under him, exactly like a police detective being forced to hand over his badge and his gun. From here on, Abrahams realizes, it is him (and Sam Mussabini) against the world.\n\nOur hero has been forced to make a choice. Does he cave or does he dig in and fight?\n\nIt seems that this beat, or a moment very much like it, is necessary in any hero’s journey story. How much, the hero must answer, do I really want my objective? What price am I willing to pay? For us as storytellers, that price must be as high as possible. The higher the price, the better the story.\n\nP.S. Abrahams (in the movie and in real life) goes on to win the gold medal in the Olympics. The filmmakers give us a brief scene in which the Master of Trinity College is informed of this. Sir John Gielgud delivers his line with supreme aplomb.\n\nSERVANT\n\nHe did it, sir! Abrahams. He won!\n\nTRINITY\n\nAs I always knew he would.\n\nChariots of Fire was conceived by David Puttnam, written as a screenplay by Colin Welland, and directed by Hugh Hudson. Its producers were Jake Eberts, Dodi Fayed and David Puttnam."
