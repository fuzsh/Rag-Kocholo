        "text": "01/01\n\nY, Me Worry?\n\nThe year 2000 goes off without a hitch — no major Y2K-related computer problems are reported. Dejected doomsayers take a ”wait till next year” approach.\n\n01/04\n\nTed’s Fonda Farewell\n\nTed Turner and Jane Fonda call it quits after eight years of marriage. Looks like somebody didn’t consider the restoration of Barbarella a top priority.\n\n01/10\n\nUpon The High Seeds\n\nJust as we’d been helplessly hoping, David Crosby is revealed to be the father of the brood (Bailey and Beckett, then 3 and 1) belonging to Melissa Etheridge and Julie Cypher.\n\n01/20\n\nDunce In A Lifetime Opportunity\n\nContestant Brian Fodera pulls a Bill Buckner on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire‘s $100 question. Rosie O’Donnell (see Feb. 8) isn’t on hand to tell him Jack Horner pulled a plum — not a blackbird — out of his pie.\n\n01/23\n\nThe Globe Sessions\n\nAt the 57th Annual Golden Globe Awards, Jim Carrey takes home his second sphere for Man on the Moon, while American Beauty more accurately forecasts the Oscars by winning Best Drama. Another preview: Twisted sister (and Globe winner) Angelina Jolie drags her overly devoted bro onstage.\n\n01/24\n\nTeenage Wasteland\n\nAs cast members start collecting Social Security, tottering youth-demo standbys Beverly Hills, 90210 and Party of Five are canceled by Fox to make room for newer, hipper fare…like Freakylinks.\n\n01\n\nWho Let The Garth Out?\n\nGarth Brooks says he’ll join the Mets for spring training. Bobby Valentine agrees, figuring he’ll get a decent third baseman in Brooks and trade alter-ego Chris Gaines to the Marlins.\n\n02/03\n\nMamma Mia!\n\nSwedish Uber-groovers ABBA turn down an offer of $1 billion from an anonymous U.S.-British consortium to reunite for a 100-concert tour. What’s more, they threaten to write Chess II if anyone asks them again.\n\n02/07\n\nThey’re Gonna Remake It After All\n\nABC reunites Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper in made-for-TV movie Mary and Rhoda, which picks up with the Mary Tyler Moore Show alums as still-frisky chicks. Reviews are mediocre. The proposed Murray Slaughter 2000 is scuttled.\n\n02/07\n\nYou Gotta Be Kidney!\n\nIt’s announced that Steven Spielberg has had a kidney removed. The media bandies about the C-word, but the director’s condition is later determined to be residual damage from 1941.\n\n02/08\n\nRing Around For Rosie\n\nRosie O’Donnell is contestant Jerry Halpin’s lifeline on ABC’s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Luckily, the question isn’t about Tom Selleck (it asks for the title Princess Di lost in divorce, ”Her Royal Highness”) and Rosie’s in the right.\n\n02/10 & 02/17\n\nLife Doesn’t Go On\n\nOn a special two-part ER, Kellie Martin’s icky character, Dr. Lucy Knight, is dispatched to the big OR in the sky by a crazed, knife-wielding patient. Or was it just one of the show’s producers?\n\n02/11\n\nCop Out\n\nJulianne Moore fly-fly-flies in to replace Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, the planned sequel to 1991 Oscar champ The Silence of the Lambs. With Anthony Hopkins licking his lips to reprise his role as the eponymous cannibal, the Ridley Scott-directed flick lurches toward production.\n\n02/15\n\nWinning Streep\n\nWith her portrayal of inner-city violin teacher Roberta Guaspari in Music of the Heart, Meryl Streep ties Katharine Hepburn for the record of total career Oscar nominations — 12. One more and she gets a set of steak knives.\n\n02/24\n\nArquette, Uncaged\n\nNicolas Cage files for divorce from Patricia Arquette, his estranged wife of four years, then suddenly changes his mind. On Nov. 17, Arquette files her own petition to divorce the star of The Family Man.\n\n03/01\n\nOscar Dire, Part 1\n\n4,200 of the nearly 5,600 Academy Awards ballots vanish after being deposited at the Beverly Hills Post Office. Fresh ballots are sent March 7. Harvey Weinstein remains at large. 03\n\nOscar Dire, Part 2\n\nAfter 55 Oscars are filched, pro scavenger Willie Fulgear locates 52 of them next to a Dumpster on March 19 and gets $50,000 and a ticket to the show. In October, his brother is arrested for involvement in the theft. (He pleaded not guilty.)\n\n03/05\n\nYou Be Ellen\n\nHBO airs the lesbian-themed if these walls could talk 2, one segment of which is written and directed by Anne Heche and stars her girlfriend, Ellen DeGeneres. By the time the flick hits video stores, Heche and DeGeneres are history, and Heche is dating a guy.\n\n03/09\n\nToast Of The Town\n\nDJ Elvis Duran of NYC station Z-100 puts ‘N Sync-er Justin Timberlake’s uneaten French toast on eBay. (The band stopped in for an early-a.m. interview.) By 5 p.m., the ‘N breakfast is worth $1,025 and still tasty.\n\n03/13\n\nNo Harmon Asking\n\nLaw & Order prosecutor Angie Harmon gets a surprise marriage proposal from her boyfriend, New York Giants defensive back Jason Sehorn, on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. Harmon agrees, on the grounds that Sehorn pleads to murder two.\n\n03/14\n\nDesktop Publishing\n\nStephen King’s short story, ”Riding the Bullet,” is made available exclusively on the Internet. Even after discovering it isn’t porn, 400,000 Web surfers shell out $2.50 apiece to read the yarn on its first day online.\n\n03/22\n\nBrand New Bag\n\nThe once-scandalous, now-fabulous Monica Lewinsky’s full line of totes goes on sale at Henri Bendel’s. Pundits note that this will probably not affect Hillary’s long-term accessorizing plan.\n\n03/31\n\nSummit Of All Fears\n\nActor Leonardo DiCaprio interviews President Bill Clinton for an ABC News Earth Day special, creating an uproar after meticulous research reveals that DiCaprio is not a journalist.\n\n04/03\n\nIntensive Carey\n\nMariah Carey, felled by bad oysters and dehydration, must postpone a Boston concert. Just days earlier, Britney Spears gets stitches after being hit in the head with a camera. Christina Aguilera and Hoku are given round-the-clock security details.\n\n04/09\n\nLive Nukes\n\nA version of the Cold War classic Fail Safe airs live on CBS, with ER vet George Clooney producing and starring, alongside Richard Dreyfuss, Harvey Keitel, and Don Cheadle. Unlike ER’s live experiment in 1997, Fail Safe loses the ratings race: The Practice and Millionaire spell mutually assured destruction for Clooney’s stunt.\n\n04/19\n\nBuy One, Get Winfrey\n\nOprah Winfrey’s women’s magazine O launches, and (surprise!) quickly establishes itself as a success. Oprah vows it will shed those extra 30 pages by the end of the year.\n\n05/02\n\nTake That, Pavlov\n\nTaco Bell’s Chihuahua becomes the latest pup to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Sadly, the Chalupa-loving pooch’s ad campaign is soon put to sleep, replaced by four Chalupa-loving men.\n\n05/02\n\nReege Against the (Sewing) Machine\n\nRegis Philbin announces the launch of a line of shirts and ties from Phillips-Van Heusen to be called the Regis Collection. Insiders say Regis Pez is just around the corner.\n\n05/12\n\nJedi Knighted\n\nLucasfilm announces that little-known Canadian actor Hayden Christensen, 19, will play Anakin Skywalker in the next two installments of the Star Wars movie franchise (sweeping both popular and electoral votes).\n\n05/20\n\nA Lotta Swerve\n\nShortly after his release from the hospital for a stomach ailment, Matthew Perry of Friends crashes his Porsche when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car in the Hollywood Hills — a funny way to celebrate that new $750,000-an-episode paycheck.\n\n05/23\n\n‘Twas Divine?\n\nHugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley, arguably Britain’s least dentally challenged couple, say they’re putting their 13-year romance on hold. Jane quotes Hurley slamming Grant’s sexual prowess, but later issues a retraction saying that — oops — Hurley never made those comments.\n\n06/01\n\nSwayze Conditions\n\nPatrick Swayze’s twin-engine Cessna crash-lands near a small Arizona town. The Ghost star denies there were spirits on board.\n\n06\n\nReturn To Gender\n\nSinead O’Connor declares, ”I’m a lesbian.” But later, the singer sets the record, uh, straight in the London Times: ”I’m not a lesbian…if you fall in love with someone it doesn’t matter if it’s a man or a woman or alien.”\n\n06\n\nRoan Stone?\n\nSharon Stone and her journalist husband, Phil Bronstein, adopt a baby boy named Roan. They immediately place all household copies of Basic Instinct out of reach.\n\n06/22\n\nGridirony\n\nABC adds Dennis Miller to the announcing booth for Monday Night Football. Critics say veteran sportscasters Al Michaels and Dan Fouts will beat him to death with his own thesaurus, but the allusive Miller has survived.\n\n06/25\n\nHail To The Chef\n\nCulinary heartthrob Bobby Flay loses a cook-off to the Iron Chef (Masaharu Morimoto) in a special Stateside episode of the Food Network’s hit Japanese import. Flay manages not to commit ritual seppuku.\n\n06/25\n\nIs This A Flop I See Before Me?\n\nBroadway’s Macbeth, starring Kelsey Grammer, closes after 13 performances. Plans for a Grammer-driven Braveheart stage show are put on hold.\n\n07/05\n\nBond. Sir James Bond.\n\nSean Connery is finally knighted by Queen Elizabeth, two years after he was denied the honor — rumor had it — because of his support for Scottish nationalism.\n\n07/12\n\nAt Least It Wasn’t Kathie Lee\n\nRoger Ebert chooses Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper to succeed the late Gene Siskel on his show, which is retitled Ebert & Roeper and the Movies.\n\n07/13\n\nDisposable Cameron?\n\nVariety reports that James Cameron will not be back to direct Terminator 3. A new liquid-metal version of the helmer, the Cam-1000, is the rumored replacement.\n\n07/20\n\nGood News, Babs News\n\nIt’s reported that Barbra Streisand will perform four final concerts in September — two in L.A. and two in New York — before bidding goodbye to her concert career. Ticket sales, however, are not the way they were.\n\n07/22\n\nIt’s A Mob!\n\nMore than 10,000 people show up for an open casting call of The Sopranos at Harrison High School in Harrison, N.J. Precious few are actually ”made” that day.\n\n08/02\n\nDana Sullied\n\nMoney manager Dana Giacchetto, 37, tearfully admits to a federal judge that he bilked investors (including Matt Damon) out of millions. He refuses to take any blame for The Legend of Bagger Vance.\n\n08/08\n\nBreak Out The Hyphens\n\nMichael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones become the parents of a baby boy, Dylan. To help celebrate, the pair get hitched Nov. 18 in an intimate, low-profile ceremony at the Plaza Hotel in New York. This is probably the first you’ve heard of it.\n\n08/11\n\nTime For ”Virgin Birth” Jokes\n\nMadonna gives the world a boy, Rocco, along with new material for Letterman and Leno. Following the example of Catherine Zeta-Jones, she reportedly plans to make an honest man of boyfriend Guy Ritchie on Dec. 22.\n\n09/07\n\nRiot On The Set!\n\nAt the MTV Video Music Awards, Rage Against the Machine’s Tim Commerford is arrested for scaling a huge prop during Limp Bizkit’s speech. He pleads guilty to disorderly conduct and is freed the next day.\n\n09/10\n\nEnd Of The Feline\n\nAfter 18 years of caterwauling on Broadway, Cats is finally put down. The Winter Garden Theatre’s next tenant will be the ABBA musical Mamma Mia!, set to open next fall.\n\n09/11\n\nThe Vice-Man Cometh\n\nPresidential hopeful Al Gore appears on Oprah. The Veep introduces a plan that would reduce Oprah by 20 percent by 2002.\n\n09/15\n\nBored Of The Rings\n\nWith much fanfare and weird floating jellyfish in the opening ceremonies, the 27th Olympic Summer Games debut in Sydney, Australia. Ratings also go down under, much to NBC’s chagrin.\n\n09/19\n\nThe Bush-Man Also Cometh\n\nGeorge W.
