        "text": "A Closer Walk\n\nThis documentary, A Closer Walk, is one of several on the List of Will Smith Movies.\n\nA Closer Walk is the first film to depict humankind's confrontation with the global AIDS epidemic.\n\nIn his review of the movie, A Closer Walk, Jack Garner, Chief Film Critic of the Gannett News Service stated: \"This is an artful motion picture and a beautifully told story of human suffering that inspires hope and action. This film rates a '10', a must-see film if ever there was one.\" Robert Butler of the Kansas City star wrote in his review of A Closer Walk: \"This is one of the most artful, heartrending and inspirational documentaries I have ever seen. It has the potential to actually change lives. Its real power comes from the way the filmmaker understands human psychology.\" A Closer Walk, written, directed, and produced by Oscar nominee Robert Bilheimer, with narration by Glenn Close and Will Smith, explores intricate and entangled relationship between health, dignity and human rights. It shows AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and its harsh realities are an expression of the way the world is. A portion of the film has interviews with well known individuals including The Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan, and musician Bono. Other portions of the film include stories and portraits of people, old and young, male and female, from four continents living with AIDS. The cinematography by Robert D. Young captured and celebrates human dignity, and it captures forever the immense human suffering. A Closer Walk also includes contributions by these additional artists: Annie Lennox, the Neville Brothers, Dido, Eric Clapton, Moby, Geoffrey Oryema, and Sade.\n\nCast:\n\nGlenn Close - Narrator\n\nWill Smith - Narrator\n\nKofi Annan - Himself\n\nBono - Himself\n\nDalai Lama - Himself\n\nBack to Top\n\nAfter Earth\n\n\"After Earth\" was released in 2013 at the very end of May and currently is the most recent addition to the Will Smith movies list.\n\nAfter Earth\n\n(Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray /\n\nDVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)\n\nAfter Earth (+UltraViolet Digital Copy)\n\nBack to Top\n\n\"After Earth\" stars Will Smith and his son Jaden and is directed by M. Night Shyamalan of \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Unbreakable\" fame. Will Smith plays the part of General Cypher Raige. Jaden plays his son, Kitai. They live on the colonized planet Nova Prime which is light years from abandoned planet Earth. Earth has continued to flourish without man’s interference.\n\nAfter Earth starring Will Smith takes a look at not only the science fiction and thriller genre, but the father and son drama, putting them in a place which is familiar to the viewer, but unfamiliar to the characters. Cypher Raige is the leader of the Ranger Corps (a peace keeping organization on Nova Prime). He is a father who is buried in his work and inadvertently neglects his son. Kitai is a new recruit for the Ranger Corps, but has a penchant for mischief and does not advance with his training group this frustrates Cypher.\n\nAfter Earth starring Will Smith tells the tale of an Earth which was abandoned after the planet and every being on it evolved to kill humans. Cypher (at the insistence of his wife) takes Kitai with him on a mission trip to Earth. The ship encounters an asteroid field and crashes on Earth killing all of the passengers except Cypher (who is wounded) and Kitai. These two must get to a tracking beacon 1000 kilometers away from where they land to be rescued. Along the way they have to fight animals that have evolved to kill humans and an alien creature which was aboard the ship when they crashed.\n\nAfter Earth starring Will Smith is a promising addition to the growing list of science fiction blockbusters by Smith. It is also another movie where he stars with his son Jaden.\n\nCast (In Credits Order):\n\nJaden Smith as Kitai Raige\n\nWill Smith as Cypher Raige\n\nSophie Okonedo as Faia Raige\n\nZoë Kravitz as Senshi Raige (as Zoe Isabella Kravitz)\n\nGlenn Morshower as Commander Velan\n\nKristofer Hivju as Security Chief\n\nSacha Dhawan as Hesper Pilot\n\nChris Geere as Hesper Navigator\n\nDiego Klattenhoff as Veteran Ranger\n\nDavid Denman as Private McQuarrie\n\nLincoln Lewis as Running Cadet\n\nJaden Martin as Nine-Year-Old Kitai\n\nSincere L.

It's the display of Sam Cooke, the rhythm & blues singer, inspiring a nightclub audience to a close rage. The year is 1964, and as Cooke shows a combination of his famous hits, you can feel the pleasure rising through the air of a nation. Ali, in his amazing preface. The film is lengthy and plays longer, It allows itself series that are drawn out to perplexing lengths while hurrying past others that should have been staged high points. It feels like an incomplete cut that might play better after editing. We see Cassius Clay as a little boy on train station sulking in silent identification jogging through nighttime streets. He exactly molding himself as a freedom fighter. Already known for his eccentric and boasting mouth style, a impetuous and furious 22 year old box steps in the ring for Heavy Weight Title fit with Sonny Liston. Their match is up and it is one of the most legendary bouts in American Sports History. Clay is huge boxer and moves to dodge the small man's blows with dodging and absorbing. Clay moves here and there then finally enter in the fight to kill. His fighting style is just like his friend Malcolm X who is in the crowd watching his every move.\n\nAfter he wins the match, Ali claims to be freest black American. He shockingly outspoken that He is the first African-American super star of this age. He says, “Now I show my allegiance to the Religion Islam and become Mohammad Ali, A disciple of Nation of Islam”. No one could own him even black and white establishment. For all of its spinning drama, Ali is such a gloomy epic, full of soft, reflective moments in which show us ’Ali’ pulling the ropes of his celebrity character. There is a lack of dramatic show in a mid of movie that should really buzz- Ali's refusal of the draft, and his first wife's rejection of his Islamic customs, feel rather cajoled than they should be. Around amusement of Ali's press conferences and weigh-ins, there are moments of inspiring power. The film doesn't concentrate much on the boxing (and even when it does, it's nothing exciting happen), which is good since boxing is exploitative sport.\n\nWhile Ali comes out on top on most of the fights represented in the movie, he took his share of punches later on in his life, something that is not exposed in the film nor actively comprehended by most people who are familiar with his private life. Close to Ali are various characters pushing and pulling for ownership of his soul like Malcolm X, promoter Don King, his friend Howard Bingham, spiritual guru Drew Brown - but the most sentimental connection placed between Ali and TV pundit Howard Cosell (an unrecognizable Voight). Mann weeds out a friendship of mutual dependence - Ali needed Cosell to provide a spokesperson, Cosell needed Ali to raise ratings - and facade affection. John Voight struggles too far to make-up but made a fine notion as Howard Cosell, the sportscaster who was Ali's favorite straight man and a truest friends.\n\nWith just these matters, this would make for a good movie. Fortunately, there is much more then it. One of the good thing about this movie is the fact that it is not solely fixed on Muhammad Ali. It would have been real simple for the director to tell the providers to only speak of what it was like to take on the ostensible figure. Up till now, the director tolerate those who went against Ali, Also serve up their own personal dilemmas. This was really a nice direction, and it serves two purposes:\n\n1. It obviously allows for more association with understanding of those not named Ali.\n\n2. It make more humane Ali from this idol-like icon he often comes across as in early media to just a regular man who isn’t all that special.\n\nAmazingly , the movie is emotional than projected. It will most definitely strike a harmony with viewers. The last 10 minutes of the film, focusing on Ali’s battle with Parkinson’s, are some of the more powerful moments have ever seen in a movie. For those anxious with bright flashes of light on the screen, a few instances of that occur in the film.\n\nAkin to many sports-themed movies, those who have no such interest should probably pass that but for those who loves hardcore boxing and people who at least have a passing interest in Muhammad Ali, Ali is a must watch. An honest, sincere and bold performance, not once does Smith invoke that skinny rapper \"getting jiggy with it\".\n\n\"Ali\" a worthwhile film that deserves to be seen? Yes, absolutely. But Mann and Smith devoted two years of their lives to this project, they refuse to believe they were determined for anything less than a masterpiece.\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Cassius Clay, Jr. / Cassius X / Muhammad Ali\n\nJamie Foxx as Drew Bundini Brown\n\nJon Voight as Howard Cosell\n\nMario Van Peebles as Malcolm X\n\nRon Silver as Angelo Dundee\n\nJeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham\n\nMykelti Williamson as Don King\n\nJada Pinkett Smith as Sonji Roi\n\nNona Gaye as Belinda/Khalilah Ali\n\nMichael Michele as Veronica Porsche\n\nJoe Morton as Chauncey Eskridge\n\nPaul Rodriguez as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco\n\nBruce McGill as Bradley\n\nBarry Shabaka Henley as Herbert Muhammad\n\nGiancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay, Sr.\n\nLaurence Mason as Luis Sarria\n\nLeVar Burton as Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAlbert Hall as Elijah Muhammad\n\nDavid Cubitt as Robert Lipsyte\n\nMichael Bentt as Sonny Liston\n\nJames Toney as Joe Frazier\n\nCharles Shufford as George Foreman\n\nRobert Sale as Jerry Quarry\n\nCandy Ann Brown as Odessa\n\nDavid Haines as Rudy Clay / Rahaman Ali\n\nLeon Robinson as Joe Smiley\n\nDavid Elliott as Sam Cooke\n\nShari Watson as Singer\n\nMalick Bowens as Joseph Mobutu\n\nZaa Nkweta as Foreman Fight Announcer\n\nBrandon T. Jackson as Club Goer (uncredited)\n\nBack to Top\n\nBad Boys\n\n\"Bad Boys\" and its sequel are two action movies of many on the list of Will Smith Movies.\n\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence are one of the classic comedy teams. Bad Boys is one of their greatest accomplishments on the Movie screen together. This movie is a collectable for any comedy movie collector. This is one of the funniest movies with smart cracking Will Smith and Martin Lawrence together investigating from two sides of life as detectives.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD (Special Edition)\n\nDVD (Bad Boys & Bad Boys 2)\n\nBack to Top\n\nWill Smith the upper class detective who only does police work out of a sense of duty to his fellow man. But he is always killing people before they can be interrogated. Martin Lawrence is his messy side kick and both end up protecting the beautiful not so bad girl Tea Leoni from a criminal mastermind that won't quit in Miami. This bad guy has connections inside the department. But this won't stop Will and Martin from getting down to business and catching this crazy criminal mastermind.\n\nThese two are friends off the force and have serious love for Martin's family and aim to protect from this crazy foreign criminal who has infiltrated the force and is killing off people themselves. Tea Leoni is in the wrong place at the wrong time and finds Will's number in her best friend's book and calls him. Then begins the fun, because a disheveled Martin and upper crust Will trade places in life to protect Tea from being murdered as an eye witness to the hit men who killed her friend in front of her.\n\nThis is one of the greats because the timing is fantastic as Martin eats fast food and is a regular cop where Will plays Superman in regular police style. The jokes are original and hilarious and some of the funniest scenes are about Tea and her dogs. Will's display of OCD in his beautiful upscale apartment is hilariously funny. This is an action filled glitzy film with crazy nonstop gun play and action.\n\nWho can resist a good comedy like this for their collection? Will Smith is a definite must for any comedy collector or anyone who loves sarcasm at its finest. This is a great story line with great cast and crew. The production Is high scale and the comedy never stops.\n\nWill Smith is one of the great actors of our time. The X generation loves Will from his old appearances starting on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to his latest greatest films such as \"I am Legend\" as we have seen him grow up his talent never ceases to amaze.\n\nBad Boys is a must have because it is his humble beginnings on the screen and it is a fast and funny movie with hilarious comedy and antics. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have a chemistry we all know and love as they cut on each other like brothers the whole film.\n\nThe funniest part is when they have to trade lives after they both want each other's benefits in life. Will loves the stability of Martin's family life and Martin loves that Will has all the girls and not enough time to be with them all. The bad guys in this film are super crazed as they try to steal a hundred million in heroin from the Police Station!\n\nTcheky Karyo is unhinged and scary as this movie's criminal mastermind and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants which is the money, power and drugs. He goes after people in an unrelenting fashion making you jump in your seat as a criminal mastermind.\n\nAnother high point as always is Joe Pantoliano as their Police Captain. He is great at reigning in the logic for Martin and Will as they get frustrated trying to figure out who is on the inside ratting them out. There is nothing worse than an inside job at the police station for cops! Joe is a must see for his funny method acting he can corner a comedy every time with ease and this is one of his first stellar appearances in a lead role.\n\nTea Leoni adds a great spice to this movie as her calm demeanor and quiet questioning of why Will's pictures are all over his own apartment but she doesn't know it is his apartment. Then comes her questioning the boys as to their partnership and just how deep it goes!\n\nThe slap stick action of Bad Boys 1 was so awesome they made a number 2 because it was a must to see Martin and Will team up again in this action packed non-stop comedy. Some of your favorites are in this movie as well.\n\nThe cast and crew is stellar for this movie with all of your favorite side kicks from action movies past in the 1990's. This movie was made by the classic Jerry Bruckheimer who knows how to please for eye quality and film making. Jerry is responsible for such classics as Con Air and Top Gun. He knows how to produce a good quality action film with lovable characters you never forget.\n\nCast:\n\nMartin Lawrence as Det. Marcus Burnett\n\nWill Smith as Det.

Alison Sinclair\n\nMichael Imperioli as Jojo\n\nKaren Alexander as Max Logan\n\nBack to Top\n\nBad Boys II\n\nThis sequel to \"Bad Boys\" is yet another action movie on the Will Smith movies list.\n\nNo one goes to a movie directed by Michael Bay for delicacy and grace; you go because Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) knows how to make your bones rattle during a high-speed chase when a car flips over, spins through the air, and smacks another car with a visceral crunch.\n\nDVD (Widescreen Edition)\n\nDVD (Bad Boys & Bad Boys 2)\n\nBack to Top\n\nBad Boys II fulfills this expectation and then some. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence may be mere puppets amid all this burning rubber and shrieking metal, but they actually provide a human core to the endless cascade of car wrecks and gunfights. Their easy rapport makes their personal problems--a running joke is Lawrence's attempts at anger management--as engaging as the sheer visual hullabaloo of bullets and explosions. The plot is recycled nonsense about drug lords and dead bodies being used to smuggle drugs, but orchestration of violence is symphonic. If that's your thing, then this is for you. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCast:\n\nMartin Lawrence as Detective Marcus Burnett\n\nWill Smith as Detective Mike Lowrey\n\nGabrielle Union as Sydney \"Syd\" Burnett\n\nJordi Mollà as Hector Juan Carlos \"Johnny\" Tapia\n\nOtto Sanchez as Carlos\n\nJon Seda as Roberto\n\nPeter Stormare as Alexei\n\nOleg Taktarov as Josef Kuninskavich\n\nMichael Shannon as Floyd Poteet\n\nTheresa Randle as Theresa Burnett\n\nJoe Pantoliano as Captain Conrad Howard\n\nJason Manuel Olazabal as Det.

Instantly, every aspect of Dean's once-normal life is targeted by a lethal team of skilled NSA surveillance operatives who wage a relentless, ultra-high-tech campaign to discredit him and retrieve the incriminating evidence! Also featuring Regina King (JERRY MAGUIRE, BOYZ N THE HOOD) in an impressive, star-studded cast -- get ready for the action to explode as Dean desperately races to reclaim his life and prove his innocence before it's too late!\n\nRobert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a lawyer with a wife and family whose happily normal life is turned upside down after a chance meeting with a college buddy (Jason Lee) at a lingerie shop. Unbeknownst to the lawyer, he's just been burdened with a videotape of a congressman's assassination. Hot on the tail of this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a belligerently ambitious fed named Reynolds (Jon Voight). Using surveillance from satellites, bugs, and other sophisticated snooping devices, the NSA infiltrates every facet of Dean's existence, tracing each physical and digital footprint he leaves. Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Brill (Gene Hackman), and Enemy of the State kicks into high-intensity hyperdrive.\n\nTeaming up once again with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Top Gun director Tony Scott demonstrates his glossy style with clever cinematography and breakneck pacing. Will Smith proves that there's more to his success than a brash sense of humor, giving a versatile performance that plausibly illustrates a man cracking under the strain of paranoid turmoil. Hackman steals the show by essentially reprising his role from The Conversation--just imagine his memorable character Harry Caul some 20 years later. Most of all, the film's depiction of high-tech surveillance is highly convincing and dramatically compelling, making this a cautionary tale with more substance than you'd normally expect from a Scott-Bruckheimer action extravaganza. --Jeremy Storey\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Robert Clayton Dean\n\nGene Hackman as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle\n\nJon Voight as Thomas Brian Reynolds\n\nBarry Pepper as David Pratt\n\nRegina King as Carla Dean\n\nIan Hart as John Bingham\n\nLisa Bonet as Rachel F.

His Philly roots run deep, but even a street-smart rapper can wrap his mind around croissants and credit cards and his arms around upscale hotties. Guest stars include Queen Latifah, Milton Berle and Zsa Zsa Gabor.\n\nBefore he became one of the biggest movie stars in the world, Will Smith (Independence Day, Men in Black) spent six seasons as a poor kid from Philadelphia who gets sent to his wealthy aunt and uncle in California to learn some class--leading to a classic sitcom collision of street smarts and pampered privilege. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Second Season finds the show in a happy groove. Will and the Banks family snipe and bicker cheerfully while grappling with problems ranging from true-to-life to truly preposterous. The more realistic side of life is found in episodes such as when Will's mother Vy (Vernee Watson-Johnson) has a new boyfriend and Will gets jealous, or when Will finds himself attracted to a girl (Queen Latifah, Bringing Down the House), but won't take her to the prom because she's overweight. The ridiculous side bursts out when Will and his pompous cousin Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) decide to make money by becoming strippers.\n\nBut whether realistic or silly, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air stays a crisp, clean sitcom, with snappy writing and brisk, capable interplay among the cast, which also included James Avery and Janet Hubert-Whitten as Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the tolerant and usually sensible parents; Karyn Parsons as the spoiled, narcissistic Hilary; Tatyana M. Ali as the cute, sassy Ashley; and Joseph Marcell as the droll British butler Geoffrey. Despite living in a fantasyland of wealth, the show regularly touched on racial and class issues--lightly, but not turning a blind eye to the complexities of American life. When Will's aunt Janice (Charlayne Woodard, The Crucible) wants to marry a white man, Vy refuses to accept the match; Geoffrey falls in love with a neighbor, but rejects her when he learns that she's an heiress and not a housekeeper. The writers are clever enough to subvert expectations, such as when Will loses a basketball game so another player can catch the eye of a pro scout--only to learn that the other player thinks professional sports are an absurd gamble and doesn't want that kind of career. Through it all, Will Smith kept the show from being just a showcase for himself; he's secure enough to let the other actors take the spotlight, but carries episodes easily when they're built around him. No longer a rookie in this season, his comic chops start to equal his cocky charm, making the second season particularly strong. --Bret Fetzer\n\nSeason 3\n\nThere's a lot hip-hoppenin' in the Fresh Prince's third season showcased in this fabulous 4-Disc Set: Philip runs for Superior Court judge (and runs into plenty of comic complications). Vivian develops a taste for sardines and Rocky Road (guess who's pregnant). Hilary lands a gig as a TV weather reporter (although she probably thinks an occluded front is a new kind of bustier). But the biggest story is that Will is ready to graduate. He's checking colleges (including sororities from alpha to gamma to bad-mama jamma). And choking when his mom wants him to come back to Philly ? because this homeboy realizes that home now means the fly flair of Bel-Air!\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's third season simultaneously provided some of the best and worst episodes of the show's six-year run. Set up as a classic collision of streets and society, the show soon found Will (Will Smith) beginning to adapt a little too well to his upper-crust home. He transfers to the same prep academy as Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), peruses Ivy League colleges, and truly starts to believe everything comes to him easily. Two spoiled characters (Carlton and Hilary, played by Karyn Parsons) are tolerable, but three begins to get grating. Five is even worse, if you count parents Philip and Vivian Banks (James Avery and Janet Hubert-Whitten), who jumped on the whining bandwagon just enough for their tired butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) to abruptly quit for one episode.\n\nWhile strong family core values remained the show's focus (Avery and Hubert-Whitten are good role models for parents who don’t try to be their children's buddy), Will became less of a good-natured jokester and more of a flagrant womanizer, going as far as to trick an abstinent girl (Kim Fields) into thinking they had married to get her into bed. Other less entertaining storylines included Philip's run for Superior Court judge against his sleazy mentor (Sherman Helmsley), and Will's possession of drugs, which Carlton accidentally consumes and nearly dies from (leading to the first of Smith's clumsy attempts at teary confrontations; in later seasons he would prove more successful at them). The show also wrote in Hubert-Whitten's pregnancy resulting in a new baby for the Banks, and gave Hilary a \"real\" job as a weather girl. Season three's highlights include the Banks family's appearance on Oprah, and more instances of Carlton's famous dance to Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" -- with guest appearance by Jones as his guardian angel. And that, we can never get enough of.--Ellen A. Kim\n\nSeason 4\n\nCombining urban edge with sizzling sitcom style, Will Smith gives a graduate course in comedy in a 4-disc collection that features all 26 fourth-season episodes of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Your homework assignment is to watch 'em all. You'll laugh large!\n\nThe fourth season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (which aired on television for six years) finds Will (Will Smith) and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) as college freshmen trying to fit in on campus. Carlton's mom, Vivian, who was played by Janet Hubert-Whitten, is now portrayed by the attractive but not-as-funny Daphne Maxwell Reid. And supermodel Tyra Banks shows up as Will's latest girlfriend, Jackie. While not quite as strong as the series' first two years, this fourth season--which aired from 1993 to 1994--still packs plenty of laughs. Smith, who at the time was busily parlaying his TV success into a film career, had not yet become a huge movie star. His charm and likeability were more important at this time than his acting skills, but Smith's charisma is undeniable. Whether he's manipulating his indulgent uncle Philip (James Avery), bossing around his bumbling cousin Carlton, or basically pimping out his other cousin Hilary (Karyn Parsons) to a professor in order to get a good grade, Will comes across as a good boy who does stupid things. There is always a lesson learned and, just as often, a lesson forgotten. Though played for laughs, the series also deals with serious subject matters in an evenhanded way. After Philip is told to diet and exercise, Will thinks he's doing his uncle a favor by sneaking him fatty meals. When Philip has a heart attack, Will has to deal with the consequences of what he did. Did he give Philip the snacks to make his uncle happy, or because it made him feel good to go against authority? When Will is accepted into a snooty African-American fraternity that rejects Carlton, he learns what it's like to discriminate against your own people.\n\nSome of the characters on The Fresh Prince by now have overstayed their welcome. Hilary has become a caricature of the spoiled and ineffectual rich girl. And as with many sitcoms based around their young stars, Philip and Vivian are superfluous add-ons now. But Carlton's baby sister Ashley (Tatyana Ali), who is growing into a lovely young woman, exhibits spunky exuberance as she tackles the rituals of dating and trying to show her parents she's not a little girl anymore. Ali also gets to show off her singing chops this season, tackling Aretha Franklin's \"Respect.\" As for the show's celebrity guest stars (Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner), it's Smith's former rapping partner DJ Jazzy Jeff who makes the most refreshing appearance as (what else?) Will's buddy from back in the day. --Jae-Ha Kim\n\nSeason 5\n\nThis season, Will meets Lisa – and before you can say “Go slow, bro,” he’s in love, engaged and standing before the minister with 50 pounds of iced shrimp melting in the banquet hall. All that romance must be contagious, because Carlton finds his soul sister through online dating. (Unfortunately, that’s only half right. It’s Hilary.) And there’s a lot more than love going on as Will grapples with a big orange whale, a mobster, a bear, Jay Leno, Lisa’s cantankerous dad and in one of the series’ most memorable episodes, a bullet with his name on it. With this 4-disc set, you are cordially invited to all 25 laugh-out-loud, love-happy Season 5 Episodes of the hit, hilarious show that gave sitcoms street smarts.\n\nFrom KIDS FIRST!: Get ready to wipe tears of laughter out of your eyes as you watch the fabulous fifth season of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Will has just enough edge to keep life interesting in his uncle’s mansion, but he’s smooth and sensitive enough to keep it real. During this season, he meets Lisa, falls in love and begins to plan his wedding. He also goes through a series of adventures with his cousins, aunt and uncle from establishing singing careers and dealing with fame to dancing on Soul Train. In spite of mishaps and misunderstandings, Will’s extended family enjoy a unique bond that helps them work through any problem. Geared towards older, teenage viewers, this title has some humor that is not appropriate for young children. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Season Five helps children are working through problems or emotional issues. Some episodes deal with the sobering truth that bad things do happen to good people sometimes as we see when Will gets shot and hospitalized.\n\nKIDS FIRST! Child Juror Comments: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a very original comedy that's been known as a classic on Nick at Night, and now the entire fifth season is on DVD. It has a catchy theme song, lovable and funny characters, and rather \"fresh’ jokes because of the scenario, such as when Will finds the \"love of his life\" online, and his family is picking on him for it, and also when Will is trying to act like a manager when he has absolutely no experience. The characters treat each other fairly well. Despite they all have their flaws, they all eventually work out their problems and get along again. This series is generally not appropriate for children, but maybe for more of the 12+ age range. There are, however, a few episodes that are family-friendly. Overall, I'd say that this is a refreshing taste of what good comedy is.\n\nSeason 6\n\nIt’s a rap: the final season! The Fresh Prince’s reign is over. Will Smith and the rest of the hilarious cast take their final bows with all 24 Season 6 Episodes on 3 Discs. A lot's happened since Will's life got flipped, turned upside down and he showed up at the Banks's Bel-Air doorstep. And the final season keeps the fun rollin' to the very end with hip comedy style, phat one-liners, a not-to-be-missed blooper episode, and guest stars that include William Shatner, B.B. King, Dick Clark, Richard Roundtree, Wayne Newton and – in a standout turn – Chris Rock as an on-the-rise comic and his butt-ugly sister. Any guess who ends up as Will's date for a night for dancin' and (ugh) romancin'? You go, Will!\n\nBack to Top\n\nHancock\n\n\"Hancock\", how do you classify it? A comedy? An action movie? A super-hero movie? This Will Smith movie is a little of each.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Will Smith (Best Actor, The Pursuit of Happyness, 2006) stars in this action-packed comedy as Hancock, a sarcastic, hard-living and misunderstood superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nUnrated Special Edition)\n\nDVD (Single Disc, Rated Edition)\n\nDVD (Single Disc, Unrated Edition)\n\nDVD (Two Disc, Unrated Edition)\n\nDVD (Two Disc,\n\nUnrated Special Edition,\n\nWith Booklet)\n\nDVD (Two Disc,\n\nUnrated Widescreen\n\nSteelbook Special Edition)\n\nDVD (UMD for PSP)\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhen Hancock grudgingly agrees to an extreme makeover from idealistic publicist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, Juno), his life and reputation rise from the ashes and all seems right again--until he meets a woman (2003 Academy Award® winner Charlize Theron, Best Actress, Monster) with similar powers to his and the key to his secret past.\n\nHancock turns the standard superhero movie inside-out: The title character (Will Smith) can fly, has superstrength, and is invulnerable, but he's also a sloppy, alcoholic jerk who causes millions of dollars in property damage whenever he bothers to fight crime. When he saves the life of a public-relations agent named Ray (Jason Bateman, Arrested Development), Ray decides to improve Hancock's image--starting by having Hancock surrender himself to the authorities and go to prison for his lawless behavior. The idea is that once he's in prison, the crime rate will go up, and people will start to realize Hancock might be of value after all. This is only the first act of Hancock--from there, the movie takes several clever turns that shouldn't be revealed. Hancock isn't a great movie (among other things, director Peter Berg overuses close-ups with a hand-held camera to a degree that may cause motion sickness), but it is an extremely entertaining one. The script, which holds together far better than most superhero movies, has a propulsive plot, good dialogue, some compassion for its characters, and even an actual idea or two. The spectacular action at least gestures towards obeying the laws of physics, which actually makes the special effects more vivid. The three leads (Smith, Bateman, and Charlize Theron as Ray's wife, Mary) deftly balance the movie's mixture of comedy, action, and drama. All in all, a smart subversive twist on a genre that all too often takes itself all too seriously. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as John Hancock, an alcoholic superhero. Smith described the character, \"Hancock is not your average superhero. Every day he wakes up mad at the world. He doesn't remember what happened to him and there's no one to help him find the answers.\"Hancock is invulnerable, immortal, possesses superhuman strength, reflexes and stamina, highly developed regeneration, and can fly at supersonic speeds. To give a realistic appearance of superhero flight, Smith was often suspended by wires 60 feet (18 m) above the ground and propelled at 40–50 miles per hour (64–80 km/h).\n\nJason Bateman as Ray Embrey, a corporate public relations consultant whose life Hancock saves. Bateman said, \"My character sees life through rose-colored glasses so he doesn't understand how people can't see the positive side of Hancock. I like being the everyman. I like being the tour guide, the one who tethers whatever absurdity might be in a film and helps make that tangible to the audience.\"\n\nCharlize Theron as Mary Embrey, Ray's wife. Theron described Mary, \"She makes this conscious decision to live in suburbia and be this soccer mom to her stepson and be the perfect wife—she lives in this bubble. But when people do that it usually means they are hiding some characteristic inside themselves that scares them. That is Mary's case. She knows who she is and what she is capable of.\"\n\nEddie Marsan as Kenneth \"Red\" Parker, Jr., a bank robber who later becomes Hancock's arch-nemesis. Having previously filmed the low-budget Happy-Go-Lucky, Marsan found the transition to the big-budget Hancock to be a shock. Marsan said, \"I went from being in a car with Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky to blowing up a bank in downtown LA.\"\n\nJae Head as Aaron Embrey, the son of Mary Embrey and Ray Embrey. He's a fan of Hancock.\n\nFilm producers Akiva Goldsman and Michael Mann appear as executives listening to Ray's lecture.\n\nTelevision host Nancy Grace also has a cameo appearance.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHitch\n\nThis comedy, \"Hitch\", is an excellent addition to the list of Will Smith movies.\n\nAlex Hitchens, a dating couselor who has helped countless men woo the women of their dreams, has trouble forming his own romantic relationships.\n\nGenre: Feature Film-Comedy\n\nRating: PG13\n\nRelease Date: 8-SEP-2006\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray, Hitch / Jerry Maguire)\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray, Groundhog Day / Hitch)\n\nDVD (Full Screen Edition)\n\nDVD (WideScreen Edition)\n\nDVD (Hitch [Widescreen] /\n\nBewitched [Special Edition])\n\nBack to Top\n\nWill Smith's easygoing charm makes Hitch the kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore's Ever After so effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go, Hitch doesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style. --Jeff Shannon\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens\n\nEva Mendes as Sara Melas\n\nKevin James as Albert Brennaman\n\nAmber Valletta as Allegra Cole\n\nJulie Ann Emery as Casey Sedgewick\n\nAdam Arkin as Max\n\nRobinne Lee as Cressida Baylor\n\nNathan Lee Graham as Geoff\n\nMichael Rapaport as Ben\n\nJeffrey Donovan as Vance Munson\n\nPaula Patton as Mandy\n\nAto Essandoh as Tanis\n\nBack to Top\n\nIndependence Day\n\n\"Independence Day\", a great science fiction movie on the list of Will Smith films.\n\nOne of the biggest box office hits of all time delivers the ultimate encounter when mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all-out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth's skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet. Now the world's only hope lies with a determinded band of survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of all mankind.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD\n\nDVD (Five Star Collection)\n\nDVD (Limited Edition)\n\nDVD (Single Disc WideScreen Edition)\n\nDVD (I, Robot / Independence Day)\n\nBack to Top\n\nIn Independence Day, a scientist played by Jeff Goldblum once actually had a fistfight with a man (Bill Pullman) who is now president of the United States. That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials. Independence Day is the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich, Independence Day is a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story. (Such as the way the girlfriend of one of the film's heroes--played by Will Smith--just happens to run across the president's injured wife, who are then both rescued by Smith's character who somehow runs across them in alien-ravaged Los Angeles County.) The movie is just sheer fun, aided by a cast that knows how to balance the retro requirements of the genre with a more contemporary feel. --Tom Keogh\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Captain Steven Hiller: An assured U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 pilot with VMFA-314. Devlin and Emmerich had always envisioned an African-American for the role, and specifically wanted Smith after seeing his performance in Six Degrees of Separation.\n\nJeff Goldblum as David Levinson: An MIT-educated computer expert, chess enthusiast and environmentalist, working as a satellite technician in New York City.\n\nBill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore: President of the United States and a former Persian Gulf War fighter pilot. To prepare for the role, Pullman read Bob Woodward's The Commanders and watched the documentary film The War Room.\n\nMargaret Colin as Constance Spano: White House Communications Director, David's ex-wife.\n\nRobert Loggia as General William Grey: A U.S. Marine Corps general who is the head of U.S. Space Command. Loggia modeled the character after generals of World War II, particularly George S. Patton.\n\nRandy Quaid as Russell Casse: A widowed, alcoholic crop duster and veteran Vietnam War pilot who claims to have been an alien abductee ten years prior to the film's events.\n\nJames Duval as Miguel Casse, Russell's eldest son. Originally derisive of Russell because of his alcoholism, he changes his mind once he sees Russell showing true concern for his children.\n\nJudd Hirsch as Julius Levinson: David's father. The character was based on one of producer Dean Devlin's uncles.\n\nMary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore.\n\nVivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow: A single mother, Steven's girlfriend (later wife), and exotic dancer.\n\nJames Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki: The U.S. Secretary of Defense and former director of the CIA. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North. The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki, MGM's head of advertising and reportedly accounted for unpleasant experiences for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of Stargate.\n\nHarvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert: David's boss.\n\nAdam Baldwin as Major Mitchell: A U.S. Air Force officer who is Area 51's commanding officer.\n\nBrent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun: The unkempt and highly excitable scientist in charge of research at Area 51. Devlin, who is open to the idea of bringing Dr. Okun back in the event of a sequel, later implied the character is merely in a coma. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate.\n\nHarry Connick, Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder: Steve's best friend and fellow pilot. Connick took over the part for Matthew Perry, originally cast in the role.\n\nKiersten Warren as Tiffany: Jasmine's exotic dancer friend.\n\nMae Whitman as Patricia, the President's daughter. She is called 'Munchkin' by her parents.\n\nFrank Welker as Alien vocal effects\n\nBack to Top\n\nI Am Legend\n\n\"I Am Legend\" is another science fiction movie on the list of Will Smith movies.\n\nRobert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and maybe the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague -- The Infected -- lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered... and quickly running out of time.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray,\n\nUltimate Collector's Edition)\n\nDVD (Combo HD DVD\n\nand Standard DVD)\n\nDVD (Single Disc, Full Screen Edition)\n\nDVD (Single Disc, Widescreen Edition)\n\nDVD (Two Disc, Widescreen Edition)\n\nDVD (Two Disc, Widescreen Edition,\n\nwith Limited Edition Steelbook Packaging\n\nand Digital Copy of Film)\n\nDVD (Ultimate Collectors Edition)\n\nBack to Top\n\nWill Smith stars in the third adaptation of Richard Matheson’s classic science-fiction novel about a lone human survivor in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by vampires. This new version somewhat alters Matheson’s central hook, i.e., the startling idea that an ordinary man, Robert Neville, spends his days roaming a desolated city and his nights in a house sealed off from longtime neighbors who have become bloodsucking fiends. In the new film, Smith’s Neville is a military scientist charged with finding a cure for a virus that turns people into crazed, hairless, flesh-eating zombies. Failing to complete his work in time--and after enduring a personal tragedy--Neville finds himself alone in Manhattan, his natural immunity to the virus keeping him alive. With an expressive German shepherd his only companion, Neville is a hunter-gatherer in sunlight, hiding from the mutants at night in his Washington Square town house and methodically conducting experiments in his ceaseless quest to conquer the disease.\n\nThe film’s first half almost suggests that I Am Legend could be one of the finest movies of 2007. Director Francis Lawrence’s extraordinary, computer-generated images of a decaying New York City reveal weeds growing through the cracks of familiar streets that are also overrun by deer and prowled by lions. It’s impossible not to be fascinated by such a realistically altered cityscape, reverting to a natural environment, through which Smith moves with a weirdly enviable freedom, offset by his wariness over whatever is lurking in the dark of bank vaults and parking garages. Lawrence and screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman wisely build suspense by withholding images of the monsters until a peak scene of horror well into the story. It must be said, however, that the computer-enhanced creatures don’t look half as interesting as they might have had the filmmakers adhered more to Matheson’s vampire-nightmare vision. I Am Legend is ultimately noteworthy for Smith’s remarkable performance as a man so lonely he talks to mannequins in the shops he frequents. The film’s latter half goes too far in portraying Smith’s Neville as a pitiable man with a messianic mission, but this lapse into bathos does nothing to take away from the visual and dramatic accomplishments of its first hour. --Tom Keogh\n\nCast:\n\nDr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) - A former military biologist and scientist before the worldwide plague. He lost his wife and his child in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan was quarantined and has spent the last three years in his home in New York City, scavenging for supplies and hunting for wildlife in the city. He is immune to the virus and uses vials of his blood to try to create a cure.\n\nAnna Montez (Alice Braga) - A survivor from Brazil, who spent her days harboured on a Red Cross ship in Philadelphia; after the city was overrun, she stayed with Ethan and several other survivors on the ship, but eventually, only she and Ethan survived, since they were immune and the others were either infected or killed. She followed Neville's broadcasts to track him.\n\nEthan (Charlie Tahan) - A boy who spent days on the ship with Anna and accompanied her when the ship was overrun; he does not have a speaking role in the movie, which maybe means he's mute.\n\nInfected alpha male (Dash Mihok)\n\nSamantha (Abbey & Kona) - Neville's dog and companion\n\nDr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson) -The doctor who creates the cancer cure that inadvertently brings mankind to the brink of extinction; Neville dubs the virus \"The Krippin Virus\".\n\nZoe Neville (Salli Richardson) - Robert's wife.\n\nMarley Neville (Willow Smith) - Robert's daughter.\n\nInfected alpha female (Lauren Haley)\n\nMike (Darrell Foster)\n\nVoice of the President of the United States (Pat Fraley)\n\nVoices of the Darkseekers (Mike Patton)\n\nBack to Top\n\nI, Robot\n\nThis Will Smith movie, \"I, Robot\", is another remake of this science fiction classic.\n\nIn the year 2035, technology and robots are a trusted part of everyday life.

Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories; I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks. Also featuring Bridget Moynahan (The Sum of All Fears), Bruce Greenwood (The Sweet Hereafter), and James Cromwell (Babe, LA Confidential). --Bret Fetzer\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Det.

Will is the executive producer for this entry on the Will Smith movies list.\n\nA remake of the 1984 film of the same name, The Karate Kid well exceeds expectations, delivering a powerful viewing experience filled with action-packed martial arts scenes, great footage of China and its many wonders, and an absorbing story of a preadolescent boy's struggle to find his own inner strength. The title Karate Kid is really a misnomer as it is the art of kung fu that is practiced in this remake, not karate, and other details, including the film's setting in China, also differ from the original film. What remains the same, and just as powerful, is the underlying story: a young boy moves to a new place where he feels isolated and is bullied by his peers. Through an unlikely relationship with an adult, the boy not only learns to protect himself through martial arts, but develops the much more important qualities of respect and the mastery of one's own mind and body. Relative newcomer Jaden Smith (son of actors and producers Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith) is excellent as the main character Drek Parker; Jackie Chan gives a restrained and highly effective performance as his mentor Mr. Han; and Zhenwei Wang is eerily believable as the bully Chen. This is an intense and often violent film that fully engulfs its viewers--be prepared to gasp and cheer out loud, and know that you may never look at the act of putting on and taking off a jacket in the same way again.

It is an excellent addition to the list of Will Smith movies.\n\nIn Lakeview Terrace, a young couple (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) has just moved into their California dream home when they become the target of their next-door neighbor, who disapproves of their interracial relationship. A stern, single father, this tightly wound LAPD officer (Samuel L. Jackson) has appointed himself the watchdog of the neighborhood. His nightly foot patrols and overly watchful eyes bring comfort to some, but he becomes increasingly harassing to the newlyweds. These persistent intrusions into their lives ultimately turn tragic when the couple decides to fight back.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray, +BD Live)\n\nDVD\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe usually provocative Neil LaBute reigns in his more eccentric tendencies for this straightforward domestic thriller. Then again, LaBute, who divides his time between cinema and theater, didn't write the material. The bad vibes begin when Chris (Patrick Wilson) and Lisa Mattson (Kerry Washington) move in next door to widowed cop Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson, as nasty as Aaron Eckhart in LaBute's In the Company of Men). A strict father of two, Turner works in a diverse unit (Jay Hernandez plays his partner), but takes less kindly to interracial relationships. From the start, he makes the Mattsons uncomfortable with inappropriate remarks and unwarranted intrusions, like the security light trained on their bedroom, under the guise of self-appointed neighborhood guardian. Initially, Turner's actions exacerbate the tensions between the seemingly happy pair--Lisa wants to start a family, Chris wants to wait--until they realize they'll have to work together to protect themselves from their troubled neighbor. And since he's a member of the LAPD, Turner's colleagues have his back, despite the break-ins and flat tires bedeviling the Mattsons. When they make it clear they intend to stay, Turner takes his harassment campaign to the next level. The A-list cast does what they can, but the B-movie script from Howard Korder and Passenger 57's David Loughery, offers few surprises--at least to those who've seen Fatal Attraction and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle--and LaBute's by-the-books direction lacks its usual bite. --Kathleen C.

Redford does for golf what A River Runs Through It did for fly-fishing: the sport is a conduit for a philosophy of living, and Redford achieves the small miracle of making golf a central metaphor that's visually compelling.\n\nSet in Savannah, Georgia, during the early '30s, the story charts the redemption of disillusioned World War I veteran and former golf champion Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who emerges from self-imposed obscurity in an exhibition match against legendary golfers Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). Having earlier abandoned the socialite (Charlize Theron) who has organized the tournament to promote her late father's spectacular golf resort, Junuh now depends on the support of a young fan (perfectly cast newcomer J. Michael Moncrief) and the mysterious Bagger Vance (Will Smith), a smiling Jiminy Cricket who serves as Junuh's caddy, golf guru, and Socratic angel of mercy.\n\nAs Junuh regains the \"authentic swing\" he feared was lost forever, Redford guides his splendid cast through a spiritual journey that is specific to the discipline of golf and yet potently universal. As always, Redford also conveys his respect for nature and the rhythms of life as well as a sweet nostalgia for simpler times and purer values. With the casting of Jack Lemmon as the film's present-day narrator and elderly version of Moncrief's character, The Legend of Bagger Vance gains even greater dignity and, indeed, the glowing aura of legend. --Jeff Shannon\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Bagger Vance\n\nMatt Damon as Rannulph Junuh\n\nCharlize Theron as Adele Invergordon\n\nBruce McGill as Walter Hagen\n\nJoel Gretsch as Bobby Jones\n\nJ.

The two MiB find themselves in the middle of the deadly plot by an intergalactic terrorist (Vincent D'Onofrio) who has arrived on Earth to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray, + BD Live)\n\nDVD\n\nDVD (Deluxe Edition)\n\nDVD (Collector's Series)\n\nBack to Top\n\nThis imaginative summer comedy from director Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty) is a lot of fun, largely on the strength of Will Smith's engaging performance as the rookie partner of a secret agent (Tommy Lee Jones) assigned to keep tabs on Earth-dwelling extraterrestrials. There's lots of comedy to spare in this bright film, some of the funniest stuff found in the margins of the major action. (A scene with Smith's character being trounced in the distance by a huge alien while Jones questions a witness is a riot.) The inventiveness never lets up, and the cast--including Vincent D'Onofrio doing frighteningly convincing work as an alien occupying a decaying human--hold up their end splendidly. --Tom Keogh\n\nCast:\n\nTommy Lee Jones as Agent K / Kevin Brown: J's grizzled and humorless mentor. Clint Eastwood turned down the part, while Jones only accepted the role after Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg's track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said \"stank\"; he felt it did not capture the tone of the comic.[2]\n\nWill Smith as James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J: A former N.Y.P.D. member, newly recruited to the M.I.B. Smith was cast because Barry Sonnenfeld's wife was a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in Six Degrees of Separation.[2] Chris O'Donnell turned down the role because he found the role of a new recruit too similar to Dick Grayson, whom he played in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.[3] David Schwimmer also turned down the part.[2] Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer.\n\nVincent D'Onofrio as Edgar the Bug: A giant alien insect who eats a farmer and uses his skin as a disguise. He comes to earth to kidnap the Galaxy and use it to destroy the Arquillians. John Turturro and Bruce Campbell were both offered the role.[2]\n\nLinda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent L: A deputy medical examiner who has had a few run-ins with the M.I.B. in the past.\n\nRip Torn as Chief Z (Zed): The head of the M.I.B.\n\nTony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs: An alien, posing as a pawn shop owner, who deals in illegal weapons.\n\nSiobhan Fallon Hogan as Beatrice, the wife of the Edgar.\n\nMike Nussbaum as Gentle Rosenberg, Arquillian Jeweler: Guardian of the Galaxy, which he has attached to his pet cat's collar.\n\nJon Gries as Van Driver\n\nSergio Calderón as Jose\n\nCarel Struycken as Arquillian\n\nFredric Lehne as INS Agent Janus\n\nKent Faulcon as 2nd Lt.

That's fine if you loved the original's fresh humor, weird aliens, and loopy ingenuity, but as sequels go, it's pure déjà vu. Makeup wizard Rick Baker is the only MIB alumnus who's trying anything new, while director Barry Sonnenfeld and costars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones (as alien-fighting agents Jay and Kay, respectively) are on autopilot with an uninspired screenplay. The quest of a multitentacled alien--on Earth in the form of Lara Flynn Boyle--for the light of Zartha requires Jay to deneuralize Kay, whose restored memory contains the key to saving the planet. The tissue-thin premise allows all varieties of special effects--mostly familiar, with some oddly hilarious new stuff tossed in for good measure. Certainly enjoyable as a popcorn distraction, but the MIB magic has worn a bit thin. --Jeff Shannon\n\nCast:\n\nTommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown/Agent K\n\nWill Smith as James Darrell Edwards III/Agent J\n\nRip Torn as Chief Zed\n\nLara Flynn Boyle as Serleena\n\nJohnny Knoxville as Scrad & Charlie: Scrad has second head named Charlie\n\nRosario Dawson as Laura Vasquez\n\nTony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs\n\nPatrick Warburton as Agent T\n\nJack Kehler as Ben\n\nDavid Cross as Newton\n\nColombe Jacobsen as Hailey\n\nJohn Alexander as Jarra\n\nMichael Jackson as Agent M (cameo)\n\nPeter Graves as Himself\n\nBack to Top\n\nMen in Black III\n\nThe second sequel in the \"Men in Black\" series, \"Men in Black III\" is another comedy science fiction film and a wonderful addition to anyone's collection of Will Smith films.\n\nIn Men in Black™ 3, Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back... in time.\n\n(Two Disc Combo:\n\nBlu-ray / DVD +\n\nUltraViolet Digital Copy)\n\n(2012) $40.99\n\n(Three Disc Combo:\n\nBlu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD +\n\nUltraViolet Digital Copy) $55.99\n\nDVD $30.99\n\nBack to Top\n\nJ has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner.

When his girlfriend Linda (Thandie Newton) walks out, Chris is left to raise their 5-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) on his own. Chris' determination finally pays off when he lands an unpaid internship in a brutally competitive stockbroker-training program, where only one in twenty interns will make the cut. But without a salary, Chris and his son are evicted from their apartment and are forced to sleep on the street, in homeless shelters and even behind the locked doors of a metro station bathroom. With self- confidence and the love and trust of his son, Chris Gardner rises above his obstacles to become a Wall Street legend.\n\nDVD (Blu-Ray)\n\nDVD (Full Screen Edition)\n\nDVD (Widecreen Edition)\n\nDVD (UDM for PSP)\n\nVideo on Demand\n\nBack to Top\n\nA heartwarming film that demonstrates how good, hard-working people can become homeless almost overnight, Pursuit of Happyness is a tour-de-force showcase for Will Smith, who convincingly portrays a down-and-out dad trying to better his family's life. Smith, who usually is cast in effortlessly boyish roles (Men in Black, Independence Day), is wonderful in the film--even in the scenes that shamelessly tug at viewers' heartstrings. Based on the true-life story of Chris Gardner, a San Francisco salesman forced at times to shelter his young son (played by Smith's adorable look-alike offspring Jaden Smith) in a men's room, there is little suspense to the film in terms of Chris' outcome. (His story and eventual success a successful and wealthy Chicago businessman was well-publicized on the newsmagazine show 20/20.) And let's face it, Hollywood's not too keen on making feel-good movies with unhappy endings. The beauty (and suspense, to a certain extent) of this film is in the way the story is told. Though he is constantly rushing around to get to appointments and pick up his child, things do not happen quickly for Chris. When he accepts an internship with a prestigious stock brokerage firm, there's a catch: The position is unpaid, suitable more for trust-fund children than single parents with no other source of income. In many scenes, the viewer panics along with Chris, wondering how he's going to feed his child. While Smith and his son, Jaden, share many tender moments together, Thandie Newton has the thankless role of playing Chris' shrill wife, who deserts her family early in the film. It's not a particularly challenging part for the talented actress, and her departure doesn't impact the storyline much at all. As for the movie's misspelled title, it's inspired from a scene in the film. (Seeing a mural drawn by the children at a daycare center, Chris points out to the proprietor that \"happiness\" is spelled incorrectly. She notes that it doesn't matter how the word is written--just that the kids have it.) With Pursuit of Happyness, Smith has come out of his safety zone and, in turn, ends up playing his most heroic role to date. --Jae-Ha Kim\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Chris Gardner\n\nJaden Smith as Christopher Gardner Jr.\n\nThandie Newton as Linda Gardner\n\nBrian Howe as Jay\n\nDan Castellaneta as Alan Frakesh\n\nJames Karen as Martin Frohm\n\nKurt Fuller as Walter Ribbon\n\nTakayo Fischer as Mrs. Chu\n\nBack to Top\n\nSeven Pounds\n\nThis drama, \"Seven Pounds\", is a heart tugging film that belongs in everyone's collection of Will Smith films.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Will Smith (2006, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, The Pursuit of Happyness) stars as Ben Thomas, a man at a crossroads searching for a way to redeem his heavy conscience. He discovers he has the power to change the circumstances of seven strangers who deserve a second chance. But when one of them captures his heart, he must decide if he should reveal his secret -- even if it means giving up on his plan.\n\nDVD (Bly-Ray)\n\nDVD\n\nUMD for PSP\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe mysteriously titled Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, who flashes his badge as an IRS agent to gain entrance into the lives of seven strangers in need. To each, he offers something that will reverse their troubles, seeking to atone for a haunting past mistake. But when Ben starts falling in love with a young woman with heart trouble (Rosario Dawson), his carefully laid plans threaten to collapse. To reveal more of the story would diminish it. Smith is an engaging, charismatic presence, but the impact of Seven Pounds comes from Dawson--she has the kind of emotional transparency that shimmers off the screen. Which is crucial, because Seven Pounds requires considerable suspension of disbelief; some scenes push and pull at plausibility, and you may question a few plot turns after the movie is over. But as the story unfolds, the performances can carry you over these bumps. If you surrender to its gently circling rhythms and its luminous images (including the glowing undulations of a poisonous jellyfish), Seven Pounds will pack an emotional wallop, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. Also featuring Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan), Michael Ealy (Sleeper Cell), and Woody Harrelson. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Timothy \"Tim\" Thomas, under the identity of Ben Thomas.\n\nMichael Ealy as Benjamin \"Ben\" Thomas, Tim's brother and an IRS agent.\n\nBarry Pepper as Dan Morris, Tim's friend and executor of his will.\n\nRosario Dawson as Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer and Tim's love interest.\n\nOctavia Spencer as Kate, Emily's caring nurse.\n\nWoody Harrelson as Ezra Turner, a blind meat salesman who plays the piano.\n\nElpidia Carrillo as Connie Tepos, a woman in a battered relationship with her boyfriend.\n\nJudyann Elder as Holly, a child services employee.\n\nBill Smitrovich as George, a junior hockey coach.\n\nQuintin Kelly as Nicholas, a child.\n\nRobinne Lee as Sarah Jenson, Tim's fiancee\n\nMadison Pettis as Connie's daughter\n\nRocio Del Mar Sevilla Ortiz\n\nBack to Top\n\nShark Tale\n\nThis animation film, \"Shark Tale\", has Will Smith providing the voice of the character Oscar. This is only animation film on the Will Smith movies list.\n\nA comic catch from the studio that brought you Shrek, Shark Tale is a hilarious hit and \"a wonderful under-the-sea adventure for movie lovers of all ages!\" (Clay Smith, Access Hollywood)\n\nOscar (Will Smith), a lowly tongue-scrubber at the local Whale Wash, becomes an improbable hero when he tells a great white lie. To keep his secret, Oscar teams up with an outcast vegetarian shark, Lenny (Jack Black), and the two become the most unlikely of friends. When his lie begins to unravel, it’s up to Oscar’s loyal friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) and Lenny to help him stand up to the most feared shark in the water (Robert De Niro) and find his true place in the reef.\n\nDVD (Full Screen Edition)\n\nDVD (WideScreen Edition)\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhen a shark accidentally clobbers himself, a small fish named Oscar (voiced by Will Smith, I, Robot) just happens to be around, prompting everyone to believe that he killed the shark himself. This lie soon makes Oscar a celebrity, worshipped by the general mass of fish, wooed by a glittering golddigger (Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted), missed by his best friend (Renee Zellweger, Cold Mountain)--and hunted by the godfather of great whites (Robert De Niro, Goodfellas). Can a vegetarian shark named Lenny (Jack Black, School of Rock) get Oscar out of this mess? The formulaic story of Shark Tale never reaches the giddy heights of Pixar's output (Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., Toy Story) or the freewheeling comedy of Shrek, but it's capably told and impeccably animated--the sheer technical skill is stunning. Kids won't get the mobster jokes or the other pop-culture references, but they'll enjoy it nonetheless. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCast:\n\nWill Smith as Oscar, an underachieving worker in the Whalewash of Reef City. He wants to be rich, but his schemes always fail and he owes 5,000 clams to Mr. Sykes.\n\nJack Black as Lenny, a great white shark who is a closeted vegetarian.\n\nRobert De Niro as Don Lino, Lenny and Frankie's father, the leader of a mob of criminally-inclined sharks.

Angie harbors a secret unrequited love for Oscar.\n\nAngelina Jolie as Lola, a seductive female gold-digger lionfish whom Oscar develops a romantic interest in.\n\nMartin Scorsese as Mr. Sykes, a porcupinefish and a loan shark whom Oscar owes five thousand clams to.

Like Lino, he is embarrassed by Lenny's vegetarian tendencies.\n\nVincent Pastore as Luca, Don Lino's \"left-hand, right-hand man\". Luca is an octopus with a tendency to state the obvious.\n\nPeter Falk as Don Ira Feinberg, an elderly leopard shark who is friends with Don Lino. He performs karaoke (badly) at the sharks' headquarters.\n\nDavid P. Smith as Crazy Joe, a deranged hermit crab who is Oscar's other friend. He normally lives in a dumpster near the Whalewash.\n\nKatie Couric as Katie Current, the local reporter, in the U.S. release. At the time, Katie Couric hosted Today in America. In the Australian release, then local Today co-host Tracy Grimshaw dubbed the lines. Fiona Phillips of the UK's GMTV performed the voice for the UK release of the film. Cristina Parodi of Italy's Verissimo provided the Italian version of the character.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSix Degrees of Separation\n\n\"Six Degrees of Separation\" is a comedy and social commentary (and true story) film. It is a welcome addition to the list of Will Smith movies.\n\n'the ultimate movie about the New York cult of class (Glamour), this rich and challenging cinematic treat (Playboy) is both a laugh-out-loud comedy and a biting social commentary about the separation between the 'haves and the 'have-nots. Will Smith gives a mightily impressive debut, Donald Sutherland is perfection and OscarÂ(r)-nominated* Stockard Channing moves from brilliance to somewhere above and beyond brilliance (CBS-TV) in a story that's all the more amazing because it's true! Posing as the son of Sidney Poitier, Paul (Smith) deftly penetrates the world of art-dealing urbanites Ouisa and Flan Kittredge (Channing and Sutherland). But as Paul's web of dropped names and near fame begins to unravel, he provides his hosts with much more than just the ultimate cocktail party anecdote sets in motion a series of events that will alter the course of their lives forever. *1993: Actress\n\nJohn Guare's hit Broadway play--about an Upper East Side couple who gets bilked by a young black man claiming to be Sidney Poitier's son--receives a terrific screen translation in this film by Fred Schepisi. Though the play was discursive and episodic, Schepisi, working from Guare's adaptation, makes it all flow like a fascinating evening listening to friends recount something that happened to them. But the story itself is also intriguing for the disparity it reveals between the wealthy, the would-be wealthy, and the have-nots yearning to be rich. Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland are exceptional as the couple who open their home to a young man they believe is a friend of their children (to whom they barely speak); Will Smith is fascinatingly glib as the young man, who claims that his famous father is casting a film version of Cats and offers his hosts roles as extras in the film. Smith finds the heartbreaking core of this character and Channing is haunting as a woman looking to make a connection, even with a confused young con artist. --Marshall Fine\n\nCast:\n\nStockard Channing – Ouisa Kittredge\n\nWill Smith – Paul\n\nDonald Sutherland – Flan Kittredge\n\nIan McKellen – Geoffrey Miller\n\nMary Beth Hurt – Kitty\n\nHeather Graham - Elizabeth\n\nBruce Davison – Larkin\n\nRichard Masur – Dr. Fine\n\nAnthony Michael Hall – Trent Conway\n\nEric Thal – Rick\n\nAnthony Rapp – Ben\n\nOz Perkins – Woodrow ('Woody') Kittredge (as Osgood Perkins II)\n\nCatherine Kellner – Talbot ('Tess') Kittredge\n\nJ.

This comedy has its place on the Will Smith movie list.\n\nAnother addition to the \"mockumentary\" subgenre of comedy, Welcome to Hollywood follows a hot, young director who decides to pick an unknown actor and make him into a star. Adam Rifkin plays the director and is also the director of Welcome to Hollywood. The actor, rechristened Nick Decker (played by Tony Markes), is unfortunately a bit of a washout, forcing Rifkin to take drastic measures, including hiring supermodel/actress Angie Everhart (who plays herself with a fine sense of irony) to be Decker's girlfriend in order to stir up buzz. The movie doesn't quite have the laughs or the sting of This Is Spinal Tap, which clearly inspired it, but there is a fairly cutting portrait of people who want to be famous at all costs, despite a lack of any apparent talent. It also has a stunning number of cameos by famous actors and directors ruminating on what makes someone a star, including John Travolta, Sandra Bullock, Will Smith, Ewan MacGregor, Glenn Close, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Jeff Goldblum, and several who actually get worked into the movie's plot, including Laurence Fishburne, Ron Shelton (Bull Durham, Tin Cup), Allison Anders (Food Gas Lodging, Mi Vida Loca), and Roger Ebert (!). One of the movie's strengths is that it's not always clear if these famous folk entirely know that they're appearing in this fake documentary, as they've almost entirely been captured at big events where, in the story of the documentary, the filmmakers went to try to sneak some footage of celebrities. One of the best sequences is when Decker gets a bit part on Baywatch, and we get to watch David Hasselhoff and Carmen Electra play themselves. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCelebrity cameos:\n\nAlison Anders\n\nTom Arnold\n\nHalle Berry\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nGlenn Close\n\nWes Craven\n\nCameron Crowe\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nRoger Ebert\n\nCarmen Electra\n\nAngie Everhart\n\nLaurence Fishburne\n\nPeter Fonda\n\nJeff Goldblum\n\nCuba Gooding Jr.\n\nWoody Harrelson\n\nDavid Hasselhoff\n\nSalma Hayek\n\nEvander Holyfield\n\nDennis Hopper\n\nRon Howard\n\nMike Leigh\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nEwan McGregor\n\nAnthony Minghella\n\nKelly Monaco\n\nJulianne Moore\n\nCathy Moriarty\n\nPat O'Brien\n\nNancy O'Dell\n\nJada Pinkett Smith\n\nKelly Preston\n\nFred Roggin\n\nSteve Schirripa\n\nJoel Schumacher\n\nRon Shelton\n\nWill Smith\n\nMira Sorvino\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nAlly Walker\n\nJohn Waters\n\nIrwin Winkler\n\nRobert Wuhl\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhere the Day Takes You\n\nA gritty film, \"Where the Day Takes You\", is another entry on the list of Will Smith movies.\n\nIt was the film that captured the grim reality of Hollywood's homeless teens, featuring an ensemble of actors delivering the most startling performances of their young careers.
