It’s been years on kind of What kind of pathetic person hasn’t seen the shining It? I mean what? I mean, no one in this room, right? Yeah. We’ve all seen the Shining. Yeah, later will be doing a couple special special bits. I’m really excited about this one we’re going to do it came from social Media, where we’ll read a couple comments from our social media feeds on people reaching out to us. And then, yes, it returns horror or porno. Theo. The last time we played this, Aaron was also a special guest on the show. That was for the already or not show. You’ve done this on purpose. There’s one or two things happening either either. I mean, either the porno is following Aaron around or she’s bringing it here with this thing is not the case. This is just basically the only thing that gets us in the mood anymore. Is that your movie or a porno on the podcast. Yeah, You gotta listen to this Really necessary for a relationship at this point, those screams and suffering, and then you just like it’s time to go. So if you’ve never listened a horror porno the game before, buckle up and we definitely earn are not safe for work. Yeah, connotation. Yeah. This is a great game. I’m very excited. Now. You just do it when I’m on so that you know, I can’t recommend it to any of my friends. Yeah, exactly. Well, I don’t know. Maybe still recommend. Yeah. See, that’s one of the problems with me sharing the podcast with my network on Facebook because it’s all just chock full of Mormons. It’s like, Well, I’m got, like, 500 friends that are Mormon and, like the story that are not you say that like it’s a problem. But Utah has the biggest porn porn usage per of any state in all of the United States. Is that true? That is 100% true, according to Pornhub statistics. Interesting. Yeah. So this week we watch the shining, and it’s pretty good. Hello. Oh, wait. What? Really? Here is the trailer. I don’t suppose they told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970? Well, a man named Charles Grady is the winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls think Muddy. From what I’ve been told me, he seemed like a completely normal individual. But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown. Ran a muck, killed his family with an ax. You can rest assured, Mr Own. And that’s not gonna happen with me. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I guess so. For some people, solitude, isolation, Johnny the Shining is available to rent on most streaming platforms. But if your horror movie fan, you should probably have this on DVD line around anyways. It’s the shining, right? Yeah. Um, so let’s give it snaps. The Shining is a tale of an aspiring writer, Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, taking his wife, Wendy, played by Shelley Duvall. Hello. I’m Shelley Duvall on and, uh, thanks, Shelly. She’s a special guest today, and, ah, his son Danny played by some kid named Danny, and he takes them to the Overlook hotels. It lies secluded deep within the heavily forested mountains of Colorado. He’s hired to be the caretaker of the Overlook in the winter off season. While there, he intends to write the next Great American novel, whose protagonist is worn down by the pressures of capitalism and the lack of leisure time. Meanwhile, Danny Torrance is tutored by a magical Negro about Danny’s ability to see into the future and read minds. Also, the hotel is haunted and Jack goes crazy. Do you really not know what the plot of the shining is? It’s the shining. It is that. Is that true? I’m just a little taken aback by your usage of of, um, the word, uh, the shining. No, that’s a trope. The magical Negro. You never heard of that before? No. Yeah. You need to defend yourself immediately. Well, yeah, like the legend of Bagger Vance. Like where it’s or driving Miss Daisy where you know, white people are. You have all these problems and their life is out of order. And then some super folksy African American person enters their life and solved all their problems and teaches them how to love again, or something like that. Oh, so it’s a trope. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But also, he is magical. And he is a Negro. That is, it’s the most direct A representation of that trophy there could possibly be. I’m sad that the the joke fell flat of the of the novel. I’m gonna be honest. Whose protagonist was worn down by the pressures of capitalism in the lack of leisure time. Well, I mean, man, I love this movie so much. Uh, there’s so many different things about this movie that All right, calm down. Okay, here we go. I appreciate this movie. It is one of the It is one of Kubrick’s masterpiece is It’s visually stunning and meticulously crafted. It’s undeniably a great and important movie. I just don’t like it proves you it’s slow. The characters are empty shells of people that lack most semblance of humanity and motivation other than a to be scared or B to be menacing. And to be frank, I couldn’t figure out what was going on or why. Most of the time the book was better. Come at me, horror fans. I don’t like your pressure shiny. Wow. I mean, it’s just it’s It’s I mean the real lesson to learn in this show is it’s OK to be wrong, which is which is to say that everybody’s taste is very different and and sometimes we get people who are very angry at us. And you come at us about very strange things that are like they’re like, What? What? What was It was the guy, The guy I really liked the curse a la Llorona, but hated like terrified. And it was like terrified is objectively terrible movie. But the curse of La Llorona, though wow, really itch on my body was scratched up. OK, you fucking lunatic. He was He was really concerned for people that would listen to our show and take our advice and not see the curse of law. You’re ona that he thought, like we’re leading people away from really great or movies, which is fair. He’s got a different taste in us. Yeah, he’s like you. He’s just like you. You know, I liked watching like Siskel and Ebert back in the day, and I always disagreed with him, always disagreed with both of them. Like a lot of the time. I would usually disagree with critics when I was growing up, Um, so I mean, I don’t feel bad about it, but when it gets to vitriol when they’re like, these guys are fucking idiots. How dare they not like, first of all, your own? A. That’s just so telling of them, you know? I mean, it’s it’s just a taste thing. Yeah, it’s just a taste this anyways, the shining is terrible way. What did you give it? Oh, yeah, we gotta give the score. I give it an eight out of 10. Fight me. That wasn’t terrible. Yeah, that doesn’t sound like someone. I mean, it’s a good movie. It’s, you know, it’s a classic. It’s visually stunning. It’s amazing to watch in terms of filmmaking and craft, but storytelling leaves much to be desired. Seen my opinion? Seems so, uh, this movie. I feel like this movie’s responsible for my taste in in horror. Yeah, it’s hugely influential to and and I watched it when I was very young. Ah, it may have been one of the first. It may have been the first horror movie I ever saw, and, um, and and there was so much about it that was mysterious and vague and And that in and of itself was creepy to me. And not only creepy, but like, titillating like it made. It made me think about it, all that, you know, it may be like, Oh, what was that? What? What was that? What was that? And so you go back to the movie hoping that you you get something more from it, and but and in each time you would. But he would still be mysterious and in clinical and cold and weird. And it’s just it’s what I love Now you know, it’s almost like it. It recreates that feeling of when you’re a kid and you’re seeing something that’s inappropriate and you just cannot process it or understand it exactly. Even as an adult, it’s exactly that you watch it and you’re like, I don’t understand what’s going on. Yeah, yeah, it’s just this is just this vague wash of like terror and unease and just like Whoa! Hey, what? Wait a minute. What the fuck was that like? And then it really builds into and the music killed me as a kid, like it was like, you know, all those strings and all, and just so much intensity with the heartbeat and like, yeah, so what do you give it? Oh, this is the most solid 10 I’ve ever given, Aaron. Um, well, it is purpose that eyes this. This is the first time you’ve seen way Watched it days ago, three days ago, I had never seen it. I mean, I’ve seen clips and parodies, and but I have seen it start to finish, but yeah, it was. I mean, I can see why it’s beloved by so many people. And at the same time, I there were a couple moments. It’s story wise that I kind of shook my head and it’s like, Well, that was abrupt and there was no really leading to it Other than foreshadowing liken our previous. But I don’t know, it’s I’d say filmmaking wise brings it up a notch for me, just the mastery of it. So I’d probably say, nine out of 10 9 being the reflection of like there I feel like there should be a clear like story that, if that that you should at least understood. Even if you don’t understand what’s happening, you should understand the character’s motivations for what’s happening or you understand their motivations. But you don’t understand what’s happening. And I don’t think either one of those things occurred. Yeah, and we should. We should also mention that for those of you who aren’t who haven’t listened to Aaron, she’s been on a few episodes. I think you were on hereditary. And then also ready or not, Yeah, Hereditary was just like a special interview. She she wasn’t on the regular podcast, most of it. And Aaron is, of course, prices wife, and she is not a big horror fan. So she it’s like pulling teeth, getting her to watch a horror movie. So the context of getting her to watch the shining was that she saw a trailer starring the dreamy Ewan McGregor on She was like, Well, I got to see Dr Sleep So I want to see that which is on the face just completely shocking to me. I had to like I had to just dragger to see Interview with the vampire like that is the level of discomfort. Wait, what was in that movie released in 1994. Yeah. Oh, wait. Yeah, I was like, I was just really like she really dislike score movies you took. Wait, you took Aaron to see Vacher make her watch. Okay? He said he said, drag her too. So I was like, What? Have you guys drag her to the living room for ever? Um, what was the so anyways? The context was she wanted to see Dr Sleep, and she felt like she needed to see the Shining to understand it, which you don’t. But I definitely jumped at the opportunity to get her to watch the Shining so she could be on the episode today. Yeah, in terms of in terms of just being scared or feeling, feeling worried and that kind of thing as someone who’s not really a horror movie fan. How did the shining hit you? Um well, I think I was kind of ruined by, you know, 39 years of parody and endlich clips. But, um, I mean, the most shocking part is when Jack is like full psychopath mare, and that’s like the only thing you see it from the movie. I don’t know. The movie is so disconcerting to me. It’s It’s like I don’t know. There’s something so strange about a little kid riding around in a big, empty hotel and then he likes stops. And then the blood gets off the elevator and you’re like, What the fuck was that? No, that was It was definitely disturbing. And, um, I think there’s more instead of frightening, it was more just disturbing and uneasiness and then seeing the I won’t say a descent into madness because it was a hard left hand. But the, uh I mean, just seeing, like the setup for it and then the super weird sex scene with the dead person and are almost sexy. And I should say And then I don’t know, it just seemed like make out. We’ll talk about it later. But it wasn’t it wasn’t frightening. Yeah, I mean, she she didn’t really? Well, yeah, it’s not a movie that a non horror movie person would hate because it’s it’s pretty. Well, here’s that’s pretty tame compared to hereditary. Here’s the thing, Though. Internet Aaron has always done well. Yeah, in my experience with hereditary. No, she’s great. It’s just she just does not like the feeling of being scared. Of course. Does not like the feeling of dread. Yeah, like she does not like living there. Yeah, and that’s just my entire life. So, yeah, it’s like going It’s like wrapping myself in a warm blanket. Warm embrace. Yeah, All right. So let’s ah do mineral real quick. Um, if you want to support the show and we hope you d’oh, we go through great time of an expense toe. Try to bring a good product.

Here’s Here’s the things the two things he gave me He was like, You absolutely need to watch the raid to which I think is a Thai movie. Or maybe is that a horror movie? I think that’s an action. It is not a horror movie. It is an action. When he’s like we were talking about Commando and I was like, I action movies and he was like, Yeah, but the raid to this is the best action movie you’ll ever see. The camera works amazing. So I gotta watch that. And then and then also berserk. The the enemy Siri’s from the nineties, I believe, which was a mango thing anyway. So check out dust and he’s got some great stuff. Yeah, let me adjust this thing here real quick, so he does a for each of the posts for the last, like, a month and 1\\/2 fish. He’s He’s created a custom artwork for it, and they’re all awesome. I especially like the lighthouse, one where he has bird characters with Siegel shit on him. And what’s the other really funny one that he did the pumpkinhead one with the Yabba Pumpkinhead one was with earbud was that that was great. It was better than that movie dessert. Yeah, it was good. So thanks again for listening and let’s get into spoilers. First of all, we just watched Doctor sleep, too. So that’s the context of this whole thing is that Dr Sleep was coming out. We wanted to shining before it. We usually do. You know the source material, like the original movie if there’s a remake coming out or the original if there’s a sequel coming out and we looked out and there was, ah, Week advanced screening for Dr Sleeps and now we’re doing the shiny Yeah, not that you care about any of this information, but that’s what it is. So let’s talk about first the I guess only I will be talking about this, but the movie versus the book okay for the Shining. Yeah, and we can even talk about the book versus the movie Doctor sleep because there’s a lot of crossover that’s interesting for people that are going to Dr Sleep this week. Aren’t yeah next week or whatever. So the main difference is in, I think the Shining is like Stephen King’s best selling work. Yeah, I think it is the one thing that got him. No, I guess the Kerry probably got him the most attention. I think that was the first, like, really big one. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. But I think the Shining is his number one book. Yeah, ever. And I’ll tell you after I watched the movie, you know, I didn’t I watch The movie is the first time as an adult, So I was in my twenties at least, and I was kind of underwhelmed or just like I. It’s one of those things where you get told something so important over and over again that when you watch it, it could never live up to it. But mostly I was confused. Yeah, and that’s like the taste it left in my mouth. And then I listened to the Audio Book of the Shining and it filled in all of the gaps. I was like, Oh, yeah, it made me see the movie in a different light and I started understanding right that Stanley Kubrick was telling his very own story. He was telling his very own story, but also telling it in like the vibe of it like that. He’s telling the story of seclusion and claustrophobia and insanity with vibe with with vibe and visuals but none of like the establishing story. It’s the same reason why you could never understand. I still don’t understand what the end of 2000 won is supposed to mean a fucking lord of 2001. It’s just he’s a visual artist, but he doesn’t necessarily tie it to a story or like conveying information other than look at how cool this looks look and listen like it’s all looking. Listen stuff, Yeah, So watching the shining and listen listening to you describe like how the book fills in gaps. Um, like, reminded me of reading 2001. A Space Odyssey think is in seventh grade and then watching the movie after we read it in our science class and you read the Shine, the Shining No. 4001. I apologize and uh huh. And still what? Well, it was okay. The teacher, like I walk in on parent orientation night and you know, the whatever orientation night, and he’s got like, various versions of the Enterprise models hanging from the ceiling and Star Trek. The next generation is playing cause it’s six o’clock and it’s on the TV. So anyway, so this is all coming in the front. So we read 2001 and then we watch the movie. And even like at that time, when we were discussing the book, he talked about how Kubrick was not necessarily making an adaptation. He was making a companion right to the book. So, um, I kind of feel like maybe that’s what he was like Maybe doing maybe he was making a companion to the Shining the book, but also, I guess he changed it a lot to make it his own. Yeah, there’s definitely so I think probably one of the best people to explain this is Stephen King himself. I have a clip of Stephen King. I don’t know if you know this or not, but Stephen King hate this movie like he absolutely hates Kubrick. Virgin of the Shine, which blows me away because this because it’s widely regarded to be maybe maybe one of the best horror films ever made ever. Right and use, You know he’s fair. But all of these points that Stephen King makes about Kubrick Shining are all completely valid to me. Like it totally valid, but explains why. Um, I prefer the book over over the movie. Anyways, here’s here. Stephen King talking about his take on the Shining The movie in the novel Shining Jack Torrance is a difficult character, but he’s fundamentally a sympathetic character, and I always visualized him is a piece of metal that’s bent 1st 1 way and the other by these malignant spirits who basically want Hiss son because his son is a psychically powerful person. So I saw these always warm characters characters that were being threatened by forces from without, from ghosts from riel supernatural creatures. And the film is extremely cold. Stanley Kubrick saw The haunting is coming from Jack Torrance from the Jack Nicholson character, whereas I always saw it from outside. So we had a fundamental a difference of opinion about, and I always thought that really difference between my take on it and Stanley Kubrick’s take on It was this. In my novel, the Hotel Burns in Kubrick’s movie, the hotel freezes. It’s a difference between more coal, but the images are striking, there’s no doubt about it. I mean, Jack Nicholson’s face in the doorway, his bearded, crazy printing face says, Here’s Johnny, which was his ad lib, and it became, you know, part of the movie. So the images is striking. But to me, that surface, it’s not substance. So I used to describe the Shining. The film is something like a beautiful car that had no engine in it. This this is so like this is so perfect to me like that. I love that I love. I love everything, Stephen King says. I hate everything he writes typically, but But I mean, the dude like I’ve said it before, did like Amazing Powerhouse of a writer. He’s a great storyteller. Yeah, here’s the thing. A great storyteller. It’s interesting to me that still, he can’t see this as art inspired by art like he’s so wrapped up in his own art that he like that he’s that he’s mad about the story being told in someone else’s. Aren’t that was inspired by Hiss? Yeah, I mean, yes, but it has. The only problem is probably has the name The Shining. It’s one of the most important books for him personally, probably because not just because it’s one of the best selling, but also it’s a pretty personal tale about alcoholism. Yeah, and being a writer and basically peeing on the edge of insanity because of, you know, disease and outside, you know, forces, supposedly And um, yeah, I mean, I would even go this far. It’s Stephen King said that the ending was the difference. Is the book the hotel Burns? I’d say, Instead of the hotel freezes and Stanley Kubrick’s It’s Jack Freeze like that, it really shows the focus of where the story is because in the book it’s It’s the hotel itself has power, and it’s trying to consume the family very literally Night and in the movie. It’s all about Jack Torrance and his inner demons. And then, in the end, it’s just it shows him him dying. And in the book, it’s the hotel dine. So it’s it’s kind of interesting that way. Yeah, I mean, it’s you can’t deny that this movie is very cold. Oh, yeah, absolutely not. Not not just literally, but emotionally. It’s very cold and detached. Yeah, absolutely. And but I mean, you know, and it’s But it’s, you know, I’m I’m an adult child of an alcoholic and and and I experienced alcoholism as a child. And I know that everybody, you know and I’ve talked to many kids or people who have also gone through that, and everyone’s experience is so similar, but also so different, you know, and it’s all. And I mean, maybe that’s just, uh, you know, maybe it’s just speaks to Maybe Q bricks. Experience with alcoholism was very different than kings. Actually, I’m sure it was because because they’re very different people. Yeah, but I knew it was even that the alcoholism is a much bigger part in the book, like it’s a main story point that it’s a source for the reason for why he is watching the Overlook Hotel because he got fired from his teaching job are like lashing out at a student. There is less alcohol in the movie then, then we’ll and it also explains it in the in the book. There’s no alcohol like he’s not consuming alcohol, but he’s acting like right. He is because the hotel is basically getting him drunk off of its off of its power. Um, so a couple things to talk about people that are interested in What’s the difference between the book and the movie The Shining and Dr Sleep? We can talk. I can talk about it briefly together cause I listen to the audio book for both, and I’ve watched both. Now the main differences are in the shining Tony, and this is one of the really confusing parts for me when I first watch it like, What exactly is Tony? Is it something possessing Danny? Or is it Danny Subconscious? Where? It was my impression, just from watching the movie that it was that it was the shine within Danny. Yet in the book, it’s much more specific. Tony is an actual spirit that communicates with Danno, so it’s It’s an imaginary friend that is, apart from Danny and Danny can see and talk with, and that’s that’s how it works, Okay, and then the in the movie, it’s like what? It’s Danny talking in a different voice mints like he’s make believing. It’s like he’s doing a puppet show. It’s like he’s fucked up to begin with. So you’re not it’s not. It’s not detached from Danny at all, right? It is so it’s somehow integrated into Danny. But really, it’s supposed to be his imaginary friend. That’s actually a ghost. Another one, this is Ah, this’d probably a good choice on Stanley Cooper. Expert Big part in the novel was these hedge animals. There is no hedge maze. But there was these hedge animals out in the front, and the hedge animals attacked like and it was all sweetie. The biggest part of menace was these hedge animals. Well, it was really creepy in the book. Like it was used to great effect in that they be like that. Did that hedge animal just move? Did it? Didn’t just start looking at me. You’re talking like topiaries or bushes, okay? And, uh, I’m sorry, Topiaries. She just She just listened to Dr Sleep, and she put me on blast for calling her out for saying u N z a U N. And, uh, her audio book e wing is what he prefers to be called. She’s It’s okay. It’s not your fault. You in your fucking buddies. It’s not your fault being Scottish in Norwegian, us, Welsh and Irish and British like we know. What’s up? Hey, I am Well, you’re Scottish English. I’m all that. And I just say, E wing, Yeah, you in that? Your your snooty and, uh and, uh, condescending. Yeah, And I’m like, Ah, that guy got nothing. The other changes that we’ve already explained. The hotel burns at the end of the book the Shining, which is difficult because in Dr Sleep the movie, you have to adapt a source where the hotel doesn’t exist. Well, so they hotel still exists in the movie, Doctor sleep on dhe, then the other main differences. Dick Hallorann survives in the book. I’m in the movie he’s murdered. So if you’re if you’re Mike Flanagan adapting Dr Sleep and Dr Sleep, the book exists in a world that Dick Hallorann is still alive and mentoring Danny and the Overlook Hotel no longer exists. It gives you some interesting, but I thought that they dealt with it really well. You would not be ableto notice that anything was out of place, the way he handled Dick Hallorann and and the hotel. And I think the hotel in Dr Sleep was very satisfying in the ending. And basically, if you if you know the books, you see that the ending of Dr Sleep. The movie is basically the same as the end of the shining. The book. Yeah, right. Yeah, it’s not being left with shining cue bricks shining on and then having to do Doctor a doctor sleep movie would not be terribly hard because they did leave the hotel intact. And so now you can just have an intact hotel to go to and be spooked out in and then and then blow up. Okay, so that’s enough about the books in the movies. Um, Jack Nicholson is 100% Jack Nickle sentence. He’s full, Full Jack. It’s creepier. I know, right? I really I really love. I was gonna share this leader, but I’ll jump the gun and just share this clip about, um, this isn’t what Ari asked Ari Astor says about the Shining, which is an interesting take Hey mentioned specifically about Jack, the character to which I agree with a SZ for his atmosphere is concerned. Like the Shining was, you know, it was a big one. I kind of I think the Shining is almost more, but it works almost for me more as a comedy than it does a horror film What’s that? You got technical cities like crazy from the beginning, before they even get up to the hotel like he’s ready to kill his family well before he even gets the job you want was being taken on. And then you have, like the title slamming into Monday and Wednesday. He’s gone totally insane. Three days then it was important to me to sort of sustain this doom laden tone where you know something awful is coming. So yeah, he is wrong. It doesn’t happen in three days, but yeah, it’s in the movie. It jumps forward a month, and it’s basically the same. And then Jacko’s and saying within like, three days. But I agree with him like if you if you watch Jack on the car ride to the Overlook, he’s basically like, I want to take this fucking car off the road. I’m gonna give everybody here. Yeah, he’s When you look at Jack Nicholson, you just always assumed that he’s insane. And a psychopath who are on this earth, or at least just supremely sarcastic right. I like he gives off this. He gives off the vibe of like, I get fucked every night. You know, like and twice on Sundays And, like, just and it’s it’s It’s it’s like, ominous, you know, he’s just he’s got that. It’s like super straight Tom Cruise, you know? What are you insinuating? I don’t know if they both have this weird striking to give anything more straight than Tom Cruise. My apologies. Have you ever seen risky business? So, um, Shelley Duvall is the weirdest proportioned human being ever. Hey, you be nice to poor Shelly. Jesus. Hello. I’m Shelley Duvall. I forgot she was here. Um, so sorry. Yeah. Shelley Duvall is She’s she’s greatness. She’s in terms of the character existing solely. Toe look terrified. I can’t think of anyone better than Shelley Duvall. And apparently Kubrick borderline tortured that he tortured her to get those react on the side of this movie to make her to basically give her ptsd. Um, not cool. There’s There’s a few shining moments in this no pun intended for me. And one of them is Shelley Duvall. When, when she’s talking with the child psychiatrist, it’s the pediatrician that comes to check on a pediatrician or whatever. So the there’s there’s just two moments that I can point to where humans act like human people. In this movie, one is Shelley Duvall. Talking to the pediatrician and two is when Dick Hallorann is talking to Danny. Yeah, when he’s sitting with him with the ice cream, those areas like, Look, kid, what’s up? Those were the two most like, resonant human moments where people act like normal people. Yeah, and then the rest of it’s just like I don’t understand, Like what they’re feeling or what’s going on internally with them. Well, Shelley Shelley is provide. I would I would argue that that she has a lot of humanity when she’s scared. Yeah, it’s specifically when she like when she finds what he’s been writing this whole time. And it’s just all all all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy at written a 1,000,000 different ways. And then, like in prose and then, like in straight lines and stuff and she’s like, Who? Shit? And then and then he starts coming at her and she’s got the bat and she’s backing up snaking her way through that room, and she’s like, I don’t know, I’m just really confused. I mean, if you if you if you want someone this acting menacing and someone that’s acting terrified, you will be completely satisfied with this movie. But, um, other than mad like Yeah, yeah, yeah, It’s a standard Q Brick. Uh, right tick. And for me, I do love some Kubrick movie is like, I’m not a huge fan where I’m just all upon Kubrick stick for everything. But what your favorite one of my favorite ones are Clockwork orange. Okay, Like, fabulous. And his coldness works in that one. Yeah. Like, absolutely works. Um and then, um, full metal jacket. Oh, Forman. Oh, yeah, Absolutely. But I mean, I consider that, like to movies like the first, the first movie of full metal jackets, like 11 out of 10. What about you, Aaron? Do you dare You fan of any any Q brick films? I’ve only seen the shining in 2001. And what do you think about 2001? I thought it was great. I really liked it. Well, I read the book too, so I understood what’s happening. And then I got this very nice visual presentations. Not already read. Was that Arthur C. Clarke? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think that my reaction to 2001 was very similar to my reaction of the shining ones like it’s slow and boring and I don’t understand, Like what the story is supposed to be telling right now. You know, stuff happens. Yeah, and I see stuff happening and it looks great, but I don’t know why I should care. Like my family was big were big cubic fans, and so and they were big, Um, symphony fans like symphonic music like Old Classic And so So by virtue of the fact that, like a lot of his movies, had some amazing tracks, we just end up watching them a lot. And so 2001 was like the most like, another very formative movie for me, where I was like Oh my God, what is this? What’s interesting? Kubrick is very particular about everything, like use super particular, and I don’t know if you know this, But he commissioned a composer to write an original soundtrack for 2001 which does exist like completely new music, and what he did was, he said, the film to he like included tracks. I want the the score to sound like these pieces and So he includes a blue Danube he includes, like all the music that’s in the movie now and gives it to the composer composer it kills. It kills it like there’s a full score and Kubrick listens to it. He’s like, I think I like the blue Dan. I think I just like the songs that I picked better and so use that. But you can Sometimes you see concerts of the actual score that was wow created from the shining So cool. Yeah, if you haven’t watched room to 37 that the Yeah, the 3 to 37 is basically, like the equivalent of 9 11 truthers talking about their obsession with the Shining. Yeah, like Kubrick has a master plan where Look at these cans in the back and see the cans of Cal You meant in the background with the Indian head on it that the Native American head on Yeah, that stands for Western expansion. Literally. That’s literally like something that said in that I watched about, like, 30 minutes and then I’m like, Okay, I get like, these people are crazy. It’s like three hours worth of talk about a two and 1\\/2 hour movie. Yeah. Um, the music. We were gonna talk about the music. The music in the Shining is a huge part of the impact of the movie. Great. One of the reasons why a lot of the moments work without the music and without the score, this movie would not be talked about. And I should say, I will. You have mentioned. But when this came out, it was a critical failure. People didn’t like it, really. And I don’t think a lot of people that watch it early on liked it either. Because it was different from anything that was done before. Hugely influential now. But, I mean, it’s really interesting Thio here about movies that weren’t received well when it first was released and now is considered a masterpiece. And sometimes I agree with the original audience. I’m like, Yeah, it’s not back. Great. Yeah, yeah, I mean, but then you got silent night, Deadly night that beat out nightmare on Elm Street first week and then got pulled for being too obscene. Yeah. So, um, the both me and Aaron have music, degrees, bachelors and music, and and a lot of the composer’s that air featured on the soundtrack for The Shine in a recognizable 20th century composers, Penderecki is featured in most of the music, which is, if you think about a horror movie soundtrack, it’s gonna sound like Penderecki. And then he’s, like, legit, considered a classical composer of the 20th century. Like, um, academics and music professors like make students study his music. And it sounds like a horror soundtrack, like in your music history classes, like the string stings like the right and the weird kind of timpani sounds. And I’m so Inger Ceramic Buller, the Water Bowl or whatever it is that they hit. I’m so interested in these artists who choose to live their life in this fucking jar space. Oh, man, like you actually like you should listen to. I know you’re not a huge symphony fan, but Penderecki, there’s, ah, he did that thready, right? What was it but like, but artists like HR Geiger, who, you know, inspired did all the inspiration for alien. And in these binned and apparently Penderecki, who just lives in this audio space of terror of just like Oh my God, this is so horrifying. I know. I need to introduce you to some mid century 20th century classical music because it’s like all the Alia Tor IQ and a tonal stuff. I think that you’re all right up your alley. I love I love like Have you listen any like Scott Walker’s Like It’s So Low Career Oh my God, it’s terrifying. There’s there’s there’s pieces where it sounds where it sounds like like wet meat dripping. And it’s and what it is, is it’s him. He has a holding. What? Meet a stripping. If you haven’t seen 30th Century Man, it’s It’s a documentary about about Scott Walker. He died this year, and, uh, and he for this for the set to make this sound. He got like, this slab this half of, ah, of a pig, and he just was punching it, punching it next to a nice microphone. So one the Penderecki piece that I really like is threatening t to the victims of Hiroshima Symphony number three. That’s that’s a really good one, fits Jesus. As you can imagine, some other composers that we found there’s bar talk lickety licky like and bear Leo’s, um, the producer of the dreaded lickety split. Well, okay, so the very first thing you hear in the shining is the d s here a theme, Um, that dun dun Dun Dun Dun, Dun Dun that’s that is old that is centuries old. That theme and it’s like a chant is It’s It’s a chant, and it’s literally the day of, like, judgment. Damn, yes, Oh, it’s It’s intended to frighten the masses and into submission. And, um, like Bear Leo’s uses it to like, um, kind of evoke, like, satanic kind of dark things in his dream of the witches Sabbath. Like which, if you haven’t heard it, you you probably have heard at least part of it. But that’s like the beginning of the shining when they use the synthesized kind of low brass. Low strings combination is really effective because it’s like an organ. Sound almost sounds as if the size from like an electrical or something like that, and it’s for me. It felt like just the sound of it. The way it’s like designed makes me feel like I’m going through a tunnel like you’re sweeping across this big lake with this helicopter shot. But the sound of the like the quality of sound makes you feel you’re going through a tunnel and it feels very narrow. And then, like contrast that with seeing Dr Sleep. And when they use that theme in Dr Sleep, they’re using, um, low brat like actual low brass and low strings. Um, probably low woodwinds, too. But they they also like, filter it through like digital synthesizing whatever. But it’s. But it feels way more epic, way more expansive. And so you really feel bigger punch. You feel like there’s more at stake. There’s they’re like, there’s something bigger happened. I know I don’t Yeah, I know in the trailer, like when they played d S e r A. And it’s the symphony. You’re like, Yeah, God damn your hackles rise, you know? But you brought up in an interesting point, Aaron, which is there’s a There’s a contract, a heavy contrast going on right here in this big open space. And then and then the sound you’re for you that’s being forced upon you is is confining or constricting. That’s it, then, is that this? This contrast Ah, Kubrick threw in through the whole movie like he’d wanted you to feel uneasy so he would throw in these very contrasting things or turn things around like intentional, intentional in continuity and of where? Where, you know, Maybe he’d be riding his bike one way down the hall, and then and then you cut to another shot from behind him. But he’s writing the same way down, like the opposite way down the hall so it can kind of mess with your head a little bit well, and it’s a It’s a big hotel, too, and it feels big when they first go there. And it’s full of lively people, and everyone’s having fun. And did you know it’s timber? Lilac right here? It’s right next to you, right nearby in the theater for Dr Slave Hunting people, Theo the like. Wide shot is definitely Timberline Lodge, but then, when they get closer shots of the entrance of the hotel, it’s not. No, it’s a different interior. And then and then the interior is completely different. Interior staged sports some other hotel anyway, So what I was saying was like, the hotel is feels big in the beginning, but then, as like the it feels like the walls are kind of closing in as um, you realize what’s happening in this hotel with, like, craziness happening. And then the fear just makes the feel like the walls are closing and even the ballroom scene, like when he first walks in and he goes up to Lloyd, the bartender, Um, like it’s empty. It feels big. But then all of a sudden it’s full of people and it feels like closed in and claustrophobic. And it’s I think that’s a good point. You make about like the contracts. So a couple more points to talk about before I put this movie on Blast even more is a good conversation. Like again, I I appreciate this movie. It’s just not necessarily for my taste. Um, but the one thing that a super appreciate is the torrents family sweater game is on point. Dude, I love your sweaters. They all are just hard core sweater. Yeah, I gotta tell you, I got better. Fam. I got it, I got it. I got this sweater and I will never like there is one of a collection. It will be a collection now because a wool sweater is just comfy all the time. It’s just comfy cozy. It’s a right temp. It lets enough win through That’s enough wind through that. You’re not. You’re not drowning and in heat. It’s great. Yeah. Yeah. David’s wife gave him the dudes sweater. Yeah, from the Big Lebowski. I love it. And at first it was really hard to wear it in public. It was like, I can’t be that guy, But now I don’t give a shit. Yeah, I’m fully that guy Who will do that, do she think? And, uh, Pendleton Woolen Mills is right from the area, which is the maker of the sweater. And Yeah, man, I wish I could by some of their stuff there got wool blankets that air just world renowned. And it’s like $300 for, like, a little square. Yeah. Fun with this. Grow like a throw blanket that will cover. You know, just your legs, the factories hiring right now. I mean, maybe get an employee discount. Um, another one. Just an observation. Jack Torrance is a huge asshole. Like a separate separate from being insane. So yells it, Wendy, Don’t disturb me when I’m writing. Can’t you see that I’m working? And he chooses the most central huge area in the hotel. He’s got the choice of probably like 200 hotel rooms. Least that if they don’t have a desk, you can put a desk in there. It’s a typewriter. He doesn’t need power. Yeah, he’d just sit there. But no, he’s gotta have the gigantic central meeting room that is the hub of the entire hotel. Did he? This is This is why it doesn’t Jack Torrance in The Shining. The movie does not need alcohol to be an alcoholic. It’s so it’s so reminiscent of alcoholic behavior. It’s just it’s just like, Oh yeah, that guy’s in total debt, dipshit. Yeah. Um, okay, so this this is here’s some of my main questions, Um, and my my beast with the movie has talked about a lot of them, but to me, I wrote this down as I was watching it again. This movie has no connective tissue. Or to say it another way. The movie does a really bad job of answering why. So here’s here’s a couple questions that I have that I don’t think the movie does a great job of answering, and it’s it’s stuff that’s not unimportant, not unimportant. So things like what causes Jack to go insane. It’s not super clear in the movie. It is in the book. Right? Um what purpose did the ghost served in the hotel? To be? Spooky. Yeah. Uh, What do you mean, what purpose? What purpose? To go serve outside of a hotel. So Haman What’ll what? I mean, what was specifically what’s the connection between them and Jack going insane? Yeah, like there’s it’s like two separate things were happening once they’re in a haunted hotel. That’s creepy. And they’re ghosts. That will attack Danny, apparently. But also, Jack is going insane. Yeah, there’s no, like, explicit connection. And there is one in the original story, right? Yes. So if you listen to Kubrick and that it’s, you know internal like, then why is Danny seeing him? And why are they attacking him? Like if it’s Jack, If Jack is the evil eyes because alcoholism is genetic people who’s passed down the trade to his child, he’s just a dry alcoholic. Yeah, I don’t I don’t even think Kubrick would say It’s it’s internal either. I think he’s just not. He’s not concerned about the original character and story of the of the Shining. Um, so what’s the the other one we talk about? What’s up with Tony? Is Danny possessed? Is it Danny Subconscious? Um, the sexual stuff. What even is the shining? Yeah. What? Yeah, What is? I mean? They explained that they, like some people, shine. Some people don’t like the you know how you can read people’s mind and see the future. Well, some people can do that, and some people don’t. So I thought those enough of an explanation for the Shining just for the movie because it was just like, Oh, it’s a It’s a special thing. He’s special and he’s special talking about being special and that that works. But it also has no connection to what happens in the movie. That’s just like, Here’s what the Shining is what the movie is named after, Um, and it’s just two special guys just having a talk over some ice cream you. And if you want to know what the Shining is watched doctor sleep because it actually explains it. Yeah, I got to say, Doctor, sleep is is a like if you haven’t listened to our episode about it, we just did it and it was my favorite blockbuster of the year. I think I had kind of a unique experience because I I saw the shining on Wednesday night. And then I saw Dr Sleep on Friday night way exactly. So So like having those like, I only have 48 hours to digest the shining. And honestly, like I had seen a bunch of parodies, you know? Sure. Bits. And she hasn’t seen The Simpsons one yet. Oh, wow. I think I have, like, I think I have. But I don’t have much of an encyclopedic knowledge of The Simpsons. You’ve got an ocean in, boy, that Shin ae yours. So like having having said that like, I only maybe seen like I’d say, probably 1\\/4 of the movie The Shining before I watched the whole thing because there was a lot that surprised me like about the movie that was in the movie because I and I never heard of before. Um, the like, the scene with the pediatrician. Uh huh. And, um, like, that’s, like, the best back story that the movie does. It was like that’s like, all the back story that we get. And, um, and the What was the other thing? The oh, the fact that she’s that Wendy is basically doing all the work in the hotel. Like Jack his leg. I got this job because blah, blah, blah, and I have mouths to feed blah, blah. And he’s like like, there is no, like there was no establishing shot of him doing any work, what so ever? And he’s like, It’s my contract, right? I’m like, Dude, Wendy was checking the boiler room. She’s like fixing all the food for your really keeping are really keyed on in on this. Yeah. I mean, lives because of their backs, just like his computer all day long. And then he goes out these days. Shut up here and I’m working. Don’t disturb me when I’m working. I chose the most central room in the house because I need to stretch out. I need to focus on pulling porno clips. Okay. They have to sound just like horror movies. Um, So the other questions are the sexual stuff in this movie. Like why? Why is the it’s it’s sudden they add a such an element of, like, spinning you around. It’s like Whoa, whoa, e. I mean, that was That was great. When, when, uh, Aaron saw the blowjob sequence first. That’s that’s That’s the most confusing part in the whole movie. Like, Whoa, Why is that dog given that butler a blowjob? Mommy, why is the dog on that man’s lap? That was me in 1992. You were the dog. Yeah. No, I was the one saying, Oh, uh, so you and Aaron made the point while we were watching that. That was probably a lot more shocking back in early eighties, you know, just having homosexuality on film. I guess you don’t. I mean, it could have been a woman in the No, no, it was definitely man, are you? I’m telling you that. Are you designing them? A gender? I don’t presume to know what dogs you. Even if I asked him, He is a canine can. But the I mean, that’s that shot when that happens. Like the front known evidence of fairies. Probably not, but, uh, like in 20 watching it in 2019 for the first time, I’m like, Oh, so this is like a rager, like they’re having a great party, and people were breaking off into separate rooms and goes all these ghosts, like, are still keeping the party going, you know, 50 60 years later, and Blake and then I was thinking about it like men in 1980. Just the idea of showing any homosexuality on screen would be terrifying to lots of men, especially, and that would that would just be like, Oh my gosh, you just add to the scariness of everything because homosexuality is so scary. If the Shining was shot in 2019 it just be like 22 Girl goes just way too obvious. And I would be just like two girls, one cup, way to a to Z. Yeah, it’s just way too inappropriate and over the top. Instead of like the insinuation of sexuality, it be like full blown ghost. I don’t know. People are so desensitized. Everything now like I don’t know that there’s any like, sexual thing that they could do that we shocking have toe. There’s a few I know of. A few would have to be violent, just like like the torture scene in it have to have to be like the torture scene in Dr Sleep. What about that guy? What about that guy on the Internet who freezes poop and then puts it in condoms and then uses. Now I know that exist uses it to pleasure. You’re welcome. And then, um, last two questions. Why does Dick come back? That’s not really explain. Just lunch. Especially special election with Danny. Why does Howard and come back? Yeah, Yeah. Danny shots at him with his head. Danny’s like, Ah, the trends Heller. And sitting there in his bed with his two froze porn ladies a bit above his bad and above his TV. And he’s like, Oh, shit, that little boy in trouble. And he’s like, he like, he’s the best. I love Halloran and Scatman Crothers so much in this man. He’s a shining moment in The movie is great is the funnest wonder. What? Well, I mean, I guess, Jack find us one of Jack’s crazy, uh, the less He’s just crazy. The last question is, why is Jack in that photo at the end? Yeah, so I mean, I think that implies that he was always here, like they say that. I mean, they they say that, but what has been the caretaker, right? Like what? It’s thinking like hotel adding a tally mark to the you know, like like we got another one boys, you know, like, I guess, See that that is like the the final image. And it feels like just that weird twist that’s there to be a twist but doesn’t have any sense other than be like, Yeah, well, that means something. Is that Is that mentioned at all in the book like that? He’s been there previously. Or is that just something that Kubrick at it in or that he talked? It was definitely time in. The photo is like from the twenties, so it’s not actually Jack Torrance the character. So I don’t know, maybe I’m not remembering. Maybe there is a photo with a guy that kind of looks at it. So in the book, it’s really interesting that the descent into madness is very attached to Jack’s obsession with the hotel and that he discovers the history of the hotel. He finds these documents in the basement about the history of the hotel, and it’s got a bunch of shady connections with the mob and, um, like money laundering kind of stuff. And he’s like, This is what I can write my book about, and he he reaches out to the manager of the owner of the hotel is like, I want to do my book on all the dirty laundry about the Overlook Hotel. And they’re like, um no, don’t do that. Please don’t do that. And if you do that, you will suffer consequences, Basically. And so ah, lot of his rage comes from his reaction to that to his reaction to the man basically telling him what he can’t do. And it expands out from there. And the his obsession with the hotel in the history, um, really shows the power that the hotel has over him. Um, so, yeah, that’s that’s that’s kind of missing from the movie as well. Um, but the the one part where it does kind of show the hotel as being an entity and a power of itself is the is the character of Grady the butler. When he’s talking to Jack in the bathroom and he’s he’s basically pushing Jack to be like, Well, you know, you got to do, you know, and it’s definitely the personification of the hotel itself and then the other, like a great side care home. Come on and waste your family and give you a beer. That’s right, because that that butler was greedy. But when the when the hotel owner or manager, whatever was interviewing talked about the murder, The Grady murder later. Yeah, he was the He was the caretaker. Yeah. So? So. And then when he tells Jack you’ve always been the caretaker, like, does that mean that Jack was, like, 10 years previous? He murdered and was That’s just great. He he’s just doing it. He’s just fucking with your head, all right? That was too much, too many. Um, And then the other great moment is the bartender. What’s his name? Lloyd Lloyd Lloyd. Bartenders is great. He’s got the greatest dead stare. Yeah, um, and then the That’s the other part. That kind of tells you that the hotel is has a personality, cause when he specifically says, you know, it’s on the house is basically saying like, this is the hotel giving you what you want. Your money is no good. You know, um, anything else that we want to talk about? The shining man? I, uh really Well, first of all, I don’t know. I don’t I don’t know if there’s really a maze. I don’t think there is a maze up a Timberlake? No. Um, but I would really love to find one of these mazes. And that is a like a 13 foot tall maze. It’s amazing. And it’s all No, but that would be a blast to do. First of all, And then second of all, um, I don’t know, I I love I love the more I watched this movie like. Okay, so I got I gotta admit, there is a little There’s a small not totally in substantial part of me that kind of dreads every week having tow watch another horror movie. Especially when I when I’ve already seen. But when I watched the Shining, you’ve seen it The miniseries and Part one and part 20 Anyway, so, yeah, I mean, so there’s a part of me that’s like, Mmm mmm, mmm mmm. I got to get kind of amped up to do these things. And the shining was like, I’ve seen this so many times, but I went back out and I watched it, and it was It was like I got so much more out of it is this time and so I don’t know if you haven’t seen the shining in a while. And you you are a fan. Uh, then, you know, check it out. Because And it’s a great winter movie. Yeah, it’s a good time to watch it too. Since Dr sleeps out like, watch the shining and then go see Dr Sleep. Yeah, it’s very good Companion pieces And later, the very complimentary The stories in two very different styles, but very good. And cover is my favorite director, Maybe of all time. Yeah. Yeah. Godric Coop, Coop Brack. Come blur. Okay. Um so final recommendations, final recommendations. Who should see this movie? Everyone. Yeah, you go first, everyone. Yeah. I mean, it’s not only is it, you know, a good horror movie, it’s iconic. It’s like part of the, you know, lexicon of film. Like you have to see it. Yeah, yeah, I agree. It’s It’s a must see for anyone. It’s one of Kubrick’s masterpiece is It’s one of Jack Nicholson’s absolute best performances ever. Yeah, and yeah, I mean, it’s it’s ah, fantastic filmmaking. Um, you might not. I love it, but it’s worth saying, definitely if you if you listen a horror movie, talk regularly and you want to get, like a good bead on on my opinions on, like the things that I enjoy about horror horror films. This is like a master class in it. This is so similar. Like I it’s been so interesting to do this podcast because I’ve realized so much about my own taste and how it differs from other people’s. And like I enjoyed the killing of a sacred dear so much, so much more than you. It’s because it’s It’s a cube. Rick ask movie. Yeah, that’s true. It’s interesting because we have really similar tastes as well in terms of, like, family based emotional Yeah, horror like you have that to love it. But you love this. Yeah, just as much. Justus much there and this like, um, just in books, all stories. I love them to be cold and clinical and, like, detached And really, there’s something just so mysterious about that to me that I don’t know, just scratches my itches. Okay, so go see it. Go see Dr Sleep too. On. Let’s move on to it came from social media. Yes, it came from social media to fill the world with terror to bring you one forgettable suspense. What was it? Where did it come from? For the all powerful creatures that brought from social media And what did they want? So it came from social media is ah portion of the podcast that we sometimes dedicate to going over some comments that we’ve gotten from Facebook, Twitter, instagram, wherever they’re coming in at us. And this is ah, very special came from social media because I think we need Thio, maybe make some changes to the podcast going forward. Um so Stephen Stephen M. On Facebook just recently you skipped the 1st 1 What’s this friend? And I know I’ll get to that one. So Stephen M on Facebook? I guess it’s Yeah. A couple of days ago Said Just discovered your podcast on Li. Listen to two episodes so far, but really enjoying it, particularly the witch episode. It made me want to revisit a film. I was totally underwhelmed by just one thing. Please stop burping into the mic. It’s fucking disgusting. And as I was doing brother, as I was going through wth e YouTube, there was a comment that I missed from a month ago from Isaiah and I never saw that? Yeah, he said Hot hot tip in capital letters. If you didn’t belch into the mic and slurp drinks like moronic man children, you might get some extra subscribers. I couldn’t get past two episodes on stitcher, and the APP doesn’t let me express my absolute disgust. Get your shit together. You make all horror movie fans look terrible. Do that. That person. Isaiah, you’ve got some anger issues, buddy. And you in there directionless, and you need to take him out yourself. So this is the level vitriol that this is created that he heard it. He found us on stitcher. And he he wanted to tell us so bad that he had to seek us out on another platform to leave a comment that could fully describe his discussed and then way back, going way back into olden times an April 10th Dana see on Facebook. We love you, Dana. Yeah, we love Dana, and she was the original originator of this concern on Facebook. She says, keep doing what you’re doing. Maybe with less belching Ella. Well, this is from one of your female fence. You do have them so moronic, man. Children are our reaction to this request is like some people like it, But I don’t think anyone’s ever commented that they do. Like no one likes it. Let me. Uh Well, I don’t know. They tolerate any. Think you’re someone like me? Let me think. Here. What’s what’s what was the biggest terrestrial radio show ever? Yeah, but we’re no cowards. No, no, I know, but what was it? Oh, yeah, it was Howard Stern. What did they, uh, what do they do all the time? Still, they’ve done it for 30 years. So I’m not saying I’m not saying they’re wrong, That this is their taste. They don’t enjoy it. And you know what? After after Thea. The other thing is that this is the hill that David is gonna die on. No, it’s not a hill. I’m going to die. And the other thing is, I think I think there, there, there, there may be an aspect to this. That is right. It may it may drive people away, but I mean, the other part is I mean, if you listen to comments, you’re gonna have people telling you you’re a Moran on moronic man child for providing them with a free piece of something that they don’t have to listen to you. I mean, it’s it’s Ah, it’s hard not to get your feelings hurt when you called a moronic man child, when you’re tryingto provide a free service, the people they try to put it in a lot of efforts, your silly, but I think it’s a very valid thing that I think early on it was I was more concerned about. Sounds like drinking Mike mouth sounds and like coughing sure and belching into the microphone. And I think, you know, maybe it’s time that we make an effort to class up the place and not discuss our listeners. We’re gonna put it I’m gonna officially say we’re gonna put a moratorium on belching on horror movie talk way Need to be This is this is a partnership. You can’t just you can’t just make it. You can’t just make e. I need to agree to the people. So if you disagree with this moratorium, you have to reach out on on social media and tell us like we love the belching. Do not stop the belching and you need to do you need to put up like an actual demonstration to show that it’s worth keeping because I don’t think we deserve the the privilege of belching into our listeners ears directly because we’re not quite, I don’t know. We’re really close to the quality of Howard Stern Show, but not quite there. So I think if it’s ah, perfectly rational to put a moratorium on belching on horror movie talk, we need to be more considerate and mature for audience. So now let’s play horror or porno whore porn ing. All right, horror. Porno is a game or a partner is a game where we play clips from horror movies and clips from poor nose, and it’s surprisingly hard to predict where they came from cause there’s lots of squelching sounds, screaming passion, you know, it’s really hard to suss him out. So we played this once on Ready or not, it was a really, really delight again on a chapter two. Do we? Oh, yeah, that was twice, Um anyways, so since I didn’t go to the movie last night, I had an extra $10 that I was expecting to spend on a ticket, so I decided to get a to buy some music for intro music. I feel like it deserves it. That’s a good intro. I got to say, Can we just get the 1st 5 seconds of that one more time? God damn, That’s a funky beat. Slaps fucking slap literally. Uh, so it goes without saying that if you’re if you’re sensitive to uh huh. You know, sexually explicit sounds. Or if you’re don’t have this on headphones, rear work may be May be turned off this one. But how we play leave. No, you have to participate. Um, David, can you keep score? So I will play a clip. And you have to tell me if it’s from a horror movie or a porno, Right? And extra points if you can guess the title of either. Okay, extra points, If you can guess the title. So it cz one point, if you guess correctly on the genre. And then it’s another point if you actually get the Yes, right. Okay, first clip. Are you ready? And Aaron is playing too. Yes. Here we go. Clip one. Wow. Okay, So was that a horror or porno? Erin, I say horror. What makes you say that? The the screaming, the music Yeah, Something hard to me. Okay? I don’t I don’t have a guess. It I don’t want to get any given anything away. David. I’m going to say that did sound an awful lot like a horror movie. But there was There was an inordinate amount of squelching and kind of gagging time. It’s hard it could be. Could be gagging. Could be knifes going into bodies. Yeah, yeah, sure. There’s a lot of it, no matter what. There was definitely some plunging involved. Right. Um, so I’m going to say I think I’m gonna say were is Well, yeah, Okay. I get your rational, but you’re both wrong. That is a porno. That was nightmare on Dik Street. Oh, wow. Um, look, clip number two. That seems unlikely. Okay, David Horror, porno. And once you ration out, I’m really gonna have to go. I think that’s definitely a porno movie. Yeah, that’s a partner. That was that. Sounded like a woman getting hammered. No, it sounded like a woman really, really faking that. She was enjoying hers. I mean, regardless, she was getting hammered. Yeah. I mean, see this. This just shows you how hard this game and that was actually no movie. What? Yeah, that was screamed. That was just a dream. I I honestly can’t say that I remember that part. Well, it isn’t like an opera scene. And sky was I don’t remember. It was Drew Barrymore That was seen how that was. That was Drew Barrymore. Yeah. Okay. All right, celery tied for nothing. Anybody for enough? Anybody’s game we’ve got, we’ve got six, and then a tiebreaker if we need it. But you can aren’t doing that. Great. We’ll see if we can turn it around on clip number three. All right. Horror or porno? Aaron, what do you think? Can you take this seriously for, like, five seconds? That is actually, considering We just saw squirrel that it went such That is such a normal thing for me to hear because you watch a lot of horror movies. That’s a That’s a porn. That’s got to be a porn. Okay, David. Okay, now, now, the first thing that comes to mind is porn on this one for sure, Because like I said, it comes comes to my mind no AA lot, but I e think of Aaron and I keep guessing the same than the known has a chance to pull. Right? So I’m going to go against my better judgment and say, That’s a horror movie. That’s clearly a porno. You think that’s a porno? I I do. I believe I think that same thing. But so do you have a guess on the title? Either one of you on the title for the for that? Yes. So you you’re guessing porno. So do you have a guest for the title? I wouldn’t even pretend. Okay, that I could think of something. Um, I guess that could be the bride of Chucky. Okay. All right. So David gets one point. It is a horror movie. That is from the grudge. There it is. Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, that’s I mean, that’s the those Japanese horrors for you. Yeah. Okay. Clip for Aaron. You gotta catch up. I’m doing that to Mrs Move. Relax. Bastard led us here. Wow. All right, horror, porno, I gotta say, is definitely a horror movie. Okay, David, She said it was tearing me apart. I mean, it shows how how hard it is to choose, because I could work even. Wait. There was a lot of male voices there as well. That’s clearly a horror movie. You think that’s a heart? Be for sure. Yeah. Um, I think it may be a horror movie as well. I’m going to say, In fact, I’m gonna hazard a guess. I’m going to say that was Silent Hill. Okay, Aaron, you gotta guess for your title. Uh, no. I don’t know. No more movies. All right, um, you guys air not close. It is a porno. That was from the bear bitch project. The bear bitch product. That just seems unlikely that they’d name a porno. That but, I mean, you know what? That’s actually not true. That poor nose gets a fucking weird names, Okay? This one is an easy one. This is a total. Gimme it. So you don’t If you don’t know what this is and the title of it Like what are you doing? Okay, Theo. I mean, come on. Yeah. Aaron, I Everyone, everyone knows this let you go first on this one because I’m I’m a I’m a co host on a horror movie podcast. So this is gonna be a hole in one for me, and I feel like, Well, this is definitely a horror movie and I’m I’m pretty sure it’s psycho, but I’ve never actually seen it go. You’ve never seen Psycho never see the next one iconic score like I mean, you can hear you can hear it in that. In that clip Ri ri ri It’s, I mean, that’s as big or bigger than Jaws. You know, like the Jaws Dun Dun, Dun Dun That’s even bigger. And I’m gonna also I’m gonna go with air and say, Yeah, this is the second. This has gotta be psycho. This is how for Titch Cox Psycho? You know, it’s kind of play a trick on you guys that that score is using different places, like appeared on Psycho. And it’s also in Re Animator. He noticed that, but yeah, but I still thought you guys were to God. This is like a classic. It’s the classic adaptation of Bram Stoker’s classic ejaculate, that z you’re living that the horror movie. This is a porno. Yeah, that’s like one of the most It’s a support. Yeah, it’s one of most famous Porn O’s and Ejaculate. Yeah, like seventies. I got to see this like Debbie does. Dallas Deep Throat and Ejaculate Dracula right next to that. Have you seen Caligula? Uh, it’s you have, Uh oh, man. Wow. When did you see that? Oh, yeah. Maybe. Maybe it’s the plan, Caligula. I didn’t think about that. But ejaculate, it’s It’s actually if you watch the movie, it’s based on calculate. Wow. Sorry, guys. Real, real close. I mean, come anywhere. Where? Yet? So you still got one? I got one point in Aaron. Every man, I really thought you would have had it on psych. I thought I had it on a psycho. Okay, so, um, I will try one last time. Maybe Aaron can tie it. Okay. Oh, please only believe Thank you. Oh, wait, please. Oh, apologies. So, horror movie or porno? I got to say that it’s This is definitely I feel like I saw this yesterday. This is definitely a porno. You okay? Yeah. I didn’t need that level of Well, okay, so for the sake of because I think I’m finally figuring out this game, huh? Um, I’m going to say it’s a horror or movie. Okay. Do you have a guess? Is the to the title frozen too? Frozen to isn’t a horror movie, but Good guess it is actually a Disney property. It is hocus pocus. Oh, damn. You know, hocus pocus has I mean, that doesn’t surprise me at all. I get a point. Yeah, Yeah. Get a point. Yeah, we’re tied up. So that means we’re tight, So go ahead, Day. But hocus pocus is commonly confused, right? I mean, when you just separate out the audit with you when you have the visual owned, by the way, did anybody else get in on the pre pre order for Disney? Plus, uh, that’s a good segue way hocus pocus gun beyond there. Yeah, and good, maybe. And it comes out, comes out in two days, 70 bucks, 70 bucks gets you your subscription and like and then your grandfather didn’t know that that plants. Oh, hocus pocus. Super hard to tell whether that’s when it’s just audio, But I don’t remember that scene from the movie. I’m gonna have to watch. You have to watch again. Like Sarah Jessica Parker had a lot of interest, and I mean, you know that meddlers. Yeah, she’s a demon in the sack. I mean, uh, okay, so we need a tiebreaker. Luckily, we have this last clip. So clip number seven. Yeah. Lots of encouragements. Yeah, take it. Get it in, Get it in? Yeah, horror movie or porno? Wouldn’t it be weird to like being I mean, assuming, Like I’m sorry. You go ahead and guess it’s a porno. You think that’s a porno? Yeah, I think this is. This is pretty clearly a behind the scenes clip of a horror movie where they’re where they’re like, they’re practicing their lines and they’re getting, you know, they’re they’re they’re getting encouragement from from the other actors and actresses and like the lighting writing that you’re saying You’re saying a horror movie. I’m gonna say a horror movie? Well, no, it’s It’s a horror movie. Wouldn’t be behind the scenes. It has to be like an actual poor or partner. So your assumption doesn’t I just want to give you the benefit, Okay? That election, it’s gonna mean the actual movie. Okay, then I’m going to say this is, um I’m gonna say this is I’m going to say the ring. Um, you are correct that it’s a horror movie. Oh, so you got you got me there, But it’s actually from Poltergeist 20 Yeah. No, I don’t remember. I think still thinking about it. Do you recall which scene it’s the scene where all the ghosts are together and And there? Yeah. Fucking that. That point start. Yeah. No, Now I remember that. Okay, so David pulls ahead. David wins horror. Porno, which I get shouldn’t surprise anyone. He’s an expert at both. And, uh, thank you for playing Aaron, but you can hang your head in shame You did not know how or and or porn I think I never wanna win this game. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
