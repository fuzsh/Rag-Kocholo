        "text": "R8 I hope you are in therapy for your PTSD for that, there are some promising new treatments now.\n\nAnd with over a dozen tours of duty under your belt, you need them\n\nAt my age, I've seen more movies than I can remember. I've probably forgotten any bad ones I saw 30 or 40 years ago. A couple of years ago, though, I streamed the Austrailian film \"True History of the Kelly Gang\", which was the worst movie I had ever watched. But I recently watched \"I Saw the TV Glow\". What a piece of shit. I still think \"Kelly Gang\" is the worst, but \"TV\" is giving it a run for its money.\n\nMy best friend and I use John Houstons' The Dead as the measure for worst movie we ever sat through.\n\nWe were college sophomores and I dragged her to it. She still holds it against my movie picking abilities.\n\nThe last one I paid to see was a Hulk movie directed by Chang and Eng or whatever his name was (he of \"crouching tiger hidden bullshit)\" I forget who played the hulk, he looked like a poor man's Victor Garber. Horrible doesn't even begin to describe how horrible it was. .the guy played Victor Von Doom on something else and I so don't care I'm not even going to Google it.\n\nBad bad or fun bad?\n\nAs far as the latter goes, I'd say \"The Lonely Lady.\" It was such a perfect object that I went back to the theater twice that week, not sure if I'd ever get to see it again (long before videocassettes and DVDs, much less streaming). When it was released on Blu-Ray after decades I got my first Blu-Ray player to watch it again.\n\n\"I don't suppose I'm the only one who's had to FUCK her way to the top!\"\n\nA dreary, dour and dull film in which nothing really happens. Roger Ebert gave it 11/2 ‚≠êout of ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êHe was being generous. It was Kate Jackson's film debut, and though she has the lead female role, her name isn't featured on the poster. David Selby who play's Jackson's husband is an unappealing leading man. This was the second feature film based on the popular TV series. The first, House of Dark Shadows, is considerably better.\n\nThat Psycho remake with Anne HeHe and Vince Vaughn was beyond bad. I do have a fond memory of seeing it in the theater. My friends and I indulged in a little wacky weed beforehand and smuggled in some wine. At a tense, quiet moment in the film (not the shower scene, darnit), my friend Amanda kicked the wine bottle and you could hear it clinking all the way to the front of the theater. Followed by her really loud giggles. This always makes me ü§£.\n\nI actually don't think Hallmark Christmas movies are bad, r68. True, they are formulaic, but that's a large part of their charm. Visually, the films are quite beautiful, not unlike Christmas itself.\n\nOther networks that have tried to emulate the formula -- Lifetime, Netflix, that weird Christian channel that I think Candace Cameron Bure defected to -- haven't quite mastered that formula.\n\nI had forgotten how much I hated ‚ÄúShining Through!‚Äù What a stupid piece of crap. Like a 1950‚Äôs romance comic with swastikas.\n\nBut my all-time worst is still Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúBabes in Toyland.‚Äù Total sugary, shitty kitsch! Like a turd covered with Technicolor frosting. Saw this in a theater with my older brother when it first came out. I was 12. Already I had some good sense.\n\nOh gosh, so many. The one that comes to mind atm is The Avengers movie from 1998. Went to see it with my ex bf at the theater. The room was about 1/4 full. By midway through almost half the audience left. I don't blame them, it was absolutely dreadful! Hands down the worst movie I've seen in a theater. My ex was so disappointed, lol. He had a crush on the tv version of Miss Peel as well as one on Uma Thurman. I don't even know where to start. SLow pace, no chemistry, American made film so it doesn't get the nuance of British culture.\n\nQue Horrible!\n\nRichard Attenborough‚Äôs A CHORUS LINE: THE MOVIE. Totally misses the point of the source material. They swap out the best production number that reveals the personalities and histories of each dancer for that crappy ‚ÄúSurprise‚Äù song. And, worst of all, Cassie is ugly, obnoxious, unlikeable, and she destroys the most famous song from the show, making it about her relationship with Zach, instead of allowing it to be the heart of everyone‚Äôs journey.\n\nThe ‚Äò80s street choreography, that replaces Michael Bennett‚Äôs signature original choreography for the show, is absolute dated crap.\n\nOh, and Audrey Landers, obviously absent from the challenging choreography (like the opening number), and swapped out with a real dancer at the end.\n\nIt‚Äôs really bad, because of what it COULD have been with the right director and cast.\n\n[quote]And, worst of all, Cassie is ugly, obnoxious, unlikeable, and she destroys the most famous song from the show, making it about her relationship with Zach, instead of allowing it to be the heart of everyone‚Äôs journey.\n\nPlus, they rewrote most of that song, to awful effect. Agreed that A CHORUS LINE is a really bad movie and certainly one of the worst screen adaptations of a Broadway musical.\n\nI'm sure the movie of A Chorus Line is bad, but a long time ago, not having seen the show, I rented the VHS and I remember I enjoyed it. I had nothing to compare it to but it didn't seem like a badly-made or difficult to enjoy movie, if you see what I mean. I could tell it seemed too \"adapted\" to film, or something. It didn't have a lot of pizazz.\n\nI thought Time Bandits was great, when it came out I saw it three times. It got some great reviews. I wouldn't call it a \"really bad movie\" by a long shot. Are there things in it that are politically incorrect or offend people now that nobody worried about then?\n\nSaw Vision Quest when it came out, liked it a lot. Sincere, well acted. Again here's a film where a white guy plays a Native American - is that the issue? Or because Madonna is in it as a bar singer? I was in my 20s when I saw it.\n\nZodiac (2007). Just an incredibly boring movie and a waste of an interesting subject. Gyllenhaal plays an annoyingly spunky reporter even though he's ten years too old to be acting like that. Mark Ruffalo is so bland and flat that you'd think he just chugged a whole bottle of Xanax. RDJ is doing his coked-up fast taking routine that he thinks is charming. Despite being obsessed with aesthetics, Fincher does NOT capture the griminess of the 1970s. Everything is sterile and fake. The movie is so long (2 hrs 40) that I completely lost interest in the mystery by the end.\n\nMy arguments lie not with the poor ideas poorly executed.\n\nMy arguments lie with the fascinating ideas twisted out of shape and corrupted.\n\nTo wit:\n\nOppenheimer\n\nBarbie\n\nZodiac\n\nCrash\n\nHigh Rise\n\nGosford Park\n\nSuspiria (both versions)\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nBarry Lyndon\n\nLess Than Zero\n\nThe Shining\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\nHappiness\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nMad Max and all sequels\n\nThe Conformist\n\nThe Dirty Dozen\n\nChinatown\n\nHalloween\n\nTop Gun\n\nAll the Right Moves\n\n48 Hours\n\nFrancis Ford Coppala's Dracula\n\nFellini's Satyricon\n\nThe Damned\n\nDeath in Venice\n\nThe Last House on the Left\n\nManon of the Spring\n\nThe Funhouse\n\nAngel Heart\n\nReturn to Oz\n\nManchester-by-the-Sea\n\nPrick up Your Ears\n\nThe French Connection\n\nDay of the Dead\n\nSilkwood\n\nR233 Well...I guess I'm old but it was shown on TV regularly in the 70's, so I do remember it! And you know people here talk a lot about Joan Crawford movies (for ex.) and she died in the 1970s. They seem familiar with films that area lot older than The Oscar.\n\nThe child's injury in KRAMER VS. KRAMER is quite serious, requiring several stitches. And if you've ever tried to take a cab in midtown Manhattan during the day in an emergency situation, you would know it's often far faster to just run or walk to the hospital.\n\nR298, your stupidity knows no bounds.\n\nR298 Dustin Hoffman played a man still learning how to be both mother and father to his son. When the son had the accident, Hoffman's character panicked because he didn't know what to do or how serious the injury was.\n\nThe character's reaction in that situation is authentic, based on the dad's circumstances.\n\nR305 No, because in this case, the character was trying to figure out how to do all the things his son's mother did.\n\nSo he was trying to figure out how to be the mother his son was missing, in addition to being a father.\n\nI thought the movie resonated with many people because it showed, maybe for the first time, the ‚Äúrealities‚Äù of divorce.\n\nIt was still the late 70‚Äôs and divorce was becoming common. It attempted to show the damage caused to everybody.\n\nI‚Äôve seen it once and since I was much younger, I‚Äôm sure the nuances escaped me.\n\n[Quote] Why doesn't Dustin hail a cab to take his son to the emergency room. NY is full of them.\n\nBesides not knowing about taxis his character was apparently unaware of nannies who were all over the UES and UWS in NY in the 70s and 80s just like the numerous restaurants where he could have taken his son. Thoroughly unconvincing film which becomes a courtroom drama. Besides not deserving the Best Picture and Director Oscars, how did Jane Alexander get a nod for her dreary, bore you blind divorcee?\n\n[quote]You said it right there. \"The way it used to be.\"\n\nYes, but the argument here is that some people are using the old definitions of \"mother\" and \"father,\" and others are using the new. That's all I meant. The poster who wrote \"Dustin Hoffman played a man still learning how to be both mother and father to his son\" was still using the old definitions, even though he's apparently writing from 2024 and not 1979. He could have written \"learning how to be a single parent,\" but he didn't. Get it?\n\nThe first film I ever walked out of was The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai. It was so cringe that my skull almost imploded from extreme secondhand embarrassment for the poor actors on screen. Eventually my friends and I couldn‚Äôt take anymore and we bolted for the exit.\n\nThe next film I practically ran out of was Naked Lunch. I‚Äôm very sensitive to surprise depictions of sexual violence, especially when the perpetrator of the sex/violence is a giant fucking cockroach and the victim is a beautiful young twink.\n\nAlong similar lines, a film I wish I had walked out on was Robert Altman‚Äôs Short Cuts, an ensemble piece billed as a comedy-drama, but I was not amused at all the suicide and random murders of young women. Maybe if I‚Äôd known going in what to expect it would have been fine, but that viewing experience just infuriated me.\n\nAlso, a film I would not recommend on a first date: One Hour Photo with Robin Williams. Seriously killed the mood.\n\nI saw Heaven's Gate in its original release cut, or whatever that was. I love when people blame the viewer for not enjoying something. I just remember it being a formless mess. It began with Oxford substituting for Harvard (how does Oxford look anything like Harvard?) and then went into this paceless western miasma of overindulgent crap.\n\nR1 mentioned \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.\" I have to say it's a disturbing movie. The first time I watched it was in the middle of the night, and I felt a little sick and could sleep afterwards. But somehow it has become one of my favorite movies. It think it's like a whacky-looking abstract painting that has different effects on people. The story and scenery are all stunningly depressing. Plus, as I understand it, it's actually a big metaphor, though I don't see it.\n\nHowever, I think it's understandable why people dislike this movie.\n\nI'll shut up now.\n\nI watched a very low budget movie called A Girl, Three Guys, and a Gun (2000) because it's often listed as June Allyson's final film, and she's listed on IMDB and in the Wikipedia article as plying the part of \"Joey's Grandma.\" This seemed like something worth checking out, so I watched most of the film thinking, \"What the hell did they do to June Allyson?\" because the grandma was this rather beat up hag, but she had a somewhat raspy voice and I figured that must be June, even though she seemed too tall.\n\nThen, about three quarters into the thing, the real June comes by in a truck driven by her real-life husband, David Ashrow, looking great. After a lot of research I found out the other actress's name. I don't know why this error persists. But anyway--not a good movie. One of those festival movies.\n\nLynn Redgrave in Midnight [1988]. Lynn plays a TV horror hostess called Midnight based on Elvira except not sexy. Her character is weird on camera, and unfortunately just as weird behind. Redgrave plays Midnight with a bizarre and fevered energy. There's a bunch of unimportant shit that happens in the movie, but it doesn't know if it's a comedy, satire, or drama. A complete misfire and wasted opportunity.\n\nMidnight made no sense whatsoever, starting with Lynn R as a sexy horror hostess (!). I think most of the budget went to cocaine.\n\nAnother cocaine movie is \"Voyage of the Rock Aliens\" starring DL fave Pia Zadora. Even by camp standards it makes no sense. And her musical co-star is Alison LaPlaca, because when you think song-and-dance gal you naturally think of horsey Alison.\n\nfrom the NY Times review\n\nNear the end of 'De-Lovely,' the lethally inert new cinematic portrait of Cole Porter, the composer (Kevin Kline) and his wife, Linda (Ashley Judd), attend a private screening in Los Angeles of 'Night and Day,' Porter's notoriously inaccurate, sugar-coated but commercially successful 1946 screen biography. After the blissful final clinch of Cary Grant and Alexis Smith in a movie that exalts the Porters' regulation Hollywood-perfect union, 'De-Lovely' shows the composer turning to his wife and remarking, 'If I can survive this, I can survive anything.'\n\nBut I wonder if Porter, who died in 1964, could have survived 'De-Lovely,' a movie so lifeless and drained of genuine joie de vivre it makes you long for the largely fictional earlier film. 'Night and Day,' after all, starred Cary Grant. When you think about it, what man in his right mind wouldn't be flattered by having Grant as his screen alter-ego? I seriously question whether watching the suave, handsome actor in his prime was an embarrassment that the physically unglamorous Porter felt he had to survive.\n\n1980s WINDOWS a real curio. Starring Talia Shire and Elizabeth Ashley\n\nWindows is a movie of firsts and lasts: Windows is the first and last film to be directed by famed cinematographer Gordon Willis (The Godfather, Annie Hall); It‚Äôs the first & last screenplay to be written by one Barry Siegel (not to be confused with the Pulitzer Prize-winning LA Times journalist). It's the last major motion picture to feature up-and-coming The Godfather/Rocky alumna Talia Shire in a lead role; Windows being the three-strikes-you‚Äôre-out, last-straw flop that followed on the heels of the underperforming features Old Boyfriends (1979) and Prophecy (1979). Finally, Windows has the dubious distinction of being the first film to be released in 1980 (January 18th)-Dreams Are What Cinema is For . . .Ken Anderson\n\n\"Alexander\" (2004) by Oliver Stone. I still have nightmares of that Russian hooker accent Angelina Jolie adopted in that movie. It wasn't sexy, it wasn't exotic, just laughably bad. Colin Farrell didn't fare much better and I didn't buy him as Alexander the Great for a second. It was truly awful in every single way.\n\nI mean, I'd rather watch something like \"Howard the Duck\", which is awful, but entertainingly awful, unlike \"Alexander\", which aspires to be prestige moviemaking but fails so miserably.\n\nR405 The Towering Inferno at 2h45m is a dreadful and dull disaster film with a limited setting and repeated shots of dummies falling from the building. It's easily an hour too long, the direction is flat, and you couldn't care less about the fate of the cardboard characters. This awful film was a Best Picture nominee and Astaire was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and the film won for Best Cinematography, and the dreary \"We May Never Love Like This Again\" won for Best Original Song! WTF!\n\nR410 I don't know if she actually overacted in The Towering Inferno. She didn't really have much to do except guide people to the elevator. Dunaway provided the glamour. Pauline Kael famously wrote:\n\n\"Best, surprisingly, is Faye Dunaway as Newman's girl. it's not that she acts much but she looks so goddessy beautiful, wandering through the chaos in see-through puce chiffon . . . When Dunaway has nothing to do it's all to the good, she doesn't pull her face together into that tight, Waspy acting mask that she usually puts on. Without it, her porcelain world-weary face becomes wounded by the fear of falling apart-and she's more beautiful than ever. Perfection going slightly to seed is maybe the most alluring face a screen goddess can have\""
