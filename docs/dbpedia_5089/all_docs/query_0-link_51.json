After the shell-shocking experience, Junuh came back a broken man just wanting to be hidden from the world. But when a high stakes tournament is set up in his hometown, he is convinced by the townsfolk to enter the match. With the aid of a mysterious stranger who acts as his caddy, Junuh regains a connection with the world and his place in it.",

        "text": "Director Robert Redford has assembled a cast, crew and script all bent on satisfying popcorn munchers. With his likeable actors and thought-provoking story, Redford uses the game of golf as an analogy to the “game” of life. There is a spiritual depth to the film as the title character helps the film’s hero find his way. Alas, the five profanities keep me from recommending this for family fare. Profaning God’s name was unneeded and unnecessary. I keep wondering why great filmmakers to incorporate irreverence toward the Creator in otherwise entertaining productions."
