        "text": "It is a mark of the wide-ranging success of Jake Eberts, founder of the once-mighty Goldcrest Films, who has died aged 71 after suffering from cancer, that few headline writers summing up his life could agree on his most notable producing credit. Was it Chariots of Fire (1981), Gandhi (1982) or The Killing Fields (1984)? The Name of the Rose (1986), Driving Miss Daisy (1989) or Dances With Wolves (1990)? Easier instead to herald him as the man whose films won a staggering 37 Oscars.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s onwards, Eberts combined business acumen and creative energy with an integrity much admired in the film industry. The actor Kevin Costner, with whom he worked on Dances with Wolves and Open Range (2003), said of him: \"Hollywood is full of people who either have intelligence or integrity. Jake is the only one with both.\" Lord Attenborough, who collaborated with Eberts on Gandhi, Cry Freedom (1987) and Grey Owl (1999), expressed similar sentiments: \"Someone like Jake, a talented businessman and a producer with a wonderful artistic sense, is really quite rare.\"\n\nEberts was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied chemical engineering at the city's McGill University. After graduating in 1962, he designed and built gas liquefaction plants for the French company Air Liquide, but soon tired of the job and enrolled at Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts. Emerging in 1966 with a master's in business administration, he worked in New York, on Wall Street and then at Oppenheimer and Co, an investment bank which transferred him to its London office, where he was promoted to be managing director.\n\nHowever, Eberts soon amassed considerable personal debts which forced him to sell his house. A fellow banker, Dimitri de Gunzberg, was looking for investment in the development and production of an animated film version of Richard Adams's popular novel, Watership Down. Eberts came on board and, the year before the movie was released in 1978, formed Goldcrest Films.\n\nAlthough stung by the failure of Zulu Dawn (1979), a poorly regarded sequel to the 1964 film Zulu, into which he had ploughed some of his own money, Eberts's early adventures in the film industry were characterised largely by sound judgment. Goldcrest notched up a string of prestigious hits in quick succession: Chariots of Fire, Gandhi, The Dresser (1983), Local Hero (1983), The Killing Fields. Apparently unhappy with an expansion into television, Eberts accepted an offer from Embassy Films in 1984 and left the company he had founded. Two years later, he returned to try to rescue the now-floundering Goldcrest, which was badly bruised by expensive liabilities including Revolution (1985) and Absolute Beginners (1986). \"I hate selling something I don't believe in,\" Eberts said in 1998. \"But what choice did I have? I had a payroll to meet. There were 50 people on staff whose livelihoods depended on what I did.\"\n\nThe company was sold in 1987. Eberts reflected on its history in the candid and meticulous book My Indecision is Final (1990), co-written with Terry Illott.\n\nHe continued to back projects which other producers considered too risky: he financed Driving Miss Daisy, another Oscar-winner, after every Hollywood studio had turned it down. He could also boast the ultimate badge of fearlessness: a Terry Gilliam film on his CV (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, 1988). Other credits included John Boorman's The Emerald Forest (1985) and Hope and Glory (1987), Robert Redford's A River Runs Through It (1992) and The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), and the first Aardman animation movie, Chicken Run (2000).\n\nIn recent years, he had specialised in nature documentaries, though he was also an executive producer on The Illusionist (2010), an animated film based on an unproduced Jacques Tati script. His Imax 3D documentary Jerusalem is scheduled for release next year.\n\nEberts was not without his critics. The author and film historian Peter Biskind has pointed out that Goldcrest \"had no hand in the most exciting films that came out of Britain in the 1980s, films such as Sid and Nancy, The Long Good Friday, Prick Up Your Ears and My Beautiful Laundrette\" and insisted that the company's status as an Oscar magnet exemplified \"an affinity between the Academy audience in its Sunday best out to do the right thing and the kinds of uplifting, well intentioned, missionary films … in which Goldcrest specialised.\"\n\nIf Eberts was loved by Hollywood, he was also quite distinct from it. He moved to Paris in order to be separate from the industry. \"If I lived there, I would have been sucked into that world,\" he said. \"There are probably more truly awful people in the film industry than there are in any other business. Not at the independent production level, mind you. All the nonsense tends to go on at the major studios. They see nothing wrong with lying – it's all part of the business to them. But there are absolutely terrific people in this industry, too. And there are enough of them around for me to make films with.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Fiona, their daughter, Lindsay, and sons, Alexander and David."
