        "text": "\"Secrets are dangerous things, Ben. We all think we want to know them. But if you've ever kept one yourself then you understand to do so is not just knowing something about someone else, it's discovering something about yourself.\"\n\nJIM GRANT\n\nFilmed in and around Vancouver, BC, principal photography for THE COMPANY YOU KEEP began on September 19, 2011 and continued through late November of that year. Redford worked with many of his key production collaborators for the first time, including the award-winning director of photography, Brazilian Adriano Goldman (Sin Nombre), and production designer Laurence Bennett (best known for his work with Paul Haggis and, most recently, Michel Hazanavicius on The Artist).\n\n\"I'd never worked with these guys before, but this is a terrific crew,\" says a beaming Redford of his team. \"Film is a collaborative medium despite the auteur theory and all that. Each role is really important. It's important to show respect for these roles and let them know how important they are and how important they are to us to get a project completed.\"\n\n\"I work pretty hard to show a crew that respect and yet you still have to be pretty demanding of them,\" says Redford of his approach on set. \"I've always been fortunate to have good ones and this is certainly the best I've ever worked with.\"\n\nSo too did the director arrive in Vancouver well prepared. \"We had all of the conversations that we had to have before we got there,\" LaBeouf explains. \"Redford knew that he wouldn't have the time to have conversations about character motivation, etc., in the middle of the fight – you know, when he's on set it's got to be about that.\"\n\nWhile many members of the all-star ensemble would come in and out of Vancouver to shoot their scenes, owing to their own additional filming commitments, LaBeouf would remain with Redford for the whole of the shoot. \"I was sort of the set mascot,\" jokes the actor.\n\n\"What happened was I read with most of the other actors on my own time with Bob's ‘homework list,'\" says LaBeouf of his prep work. \"For me, there was a lot of rehearsal. There was a lot of rehearsal for Bob too, but there wasn't a lot for Julie Christie or most of the other actors because no one was available. So I'd track these dudes down, sometimes when they arrived on their travel day, and get to it. I actually got the majority of my rehearsal in, selfishly, without Bob even knowing.\"\n\n\"For example, my stuff with Stanley could be six or seven pages,\" LaBeouf explains, noting his onscreen run-ins with Stanley Tucci who plays his boss in the film, the editor-in-chief of a financially besieged local newspaper, The Albany Sun-Times. \"It was all run and gun, so I'm happy that I had that rehearsal time with Stanley - that way, we could actually play the scenes.\"\n\n\"That scene with Susan Sarandon is eight pages long,\" LaBeouf continues, citing another sequence in which his character interviews Sarandon's, Sharon Solarz, the woman whose arrest sets the story in motion. \"Even with rehearsal that's a heavy pressure,\" says LaBeouf. \"But that's why you had pros around. It was really wild to be a part of all that.\"\n\n\"It's an amazing thing when you really trust your director because you let go and you feel really free,\" says Marling. \"You trust him to locate you in the story. You trust him to be your guide. And that's a beautiful feeling because that's the only way you can really be free enough to do your job... It was really a special thing to work on this movie.\"\n\nFor Redford, the onscreen pyrotechnics in THE COMPANY YOU KEEP wouldn't come from elaborate effects or CG-work, but instead the explosive interaction between his characters – a throwback, he agrees, to a different era in filmmaking.\n\n\"You have new technology now that's driving a lot of films,\" says Redford. \"You have a lot of amazing stunts that are done to the point where you don't even know what's virtual and what's real. Some of that can be wildly entertaining – there may not be a lot of story there, but there's a lot of action and a lot of entertainment. That wasn't there in the 70s. It was much more of a storytelling time and that of course appeals to me. I think I still fall on the humanistic side of cinema.\"\n\nRedford continues, \"When I was a kid I loved Frankenstein, I loved The Three Stooges, I loved musicals. I still love all of it. But when you become an artist, you do what's important to you. What's important to me are stories about American life. It's a great country, but let's look at the gray area of our country too. And that's what interests me because I've lived through it.\"\n\nTHE COMPANY YOU KEEP can be seen as a cat and mouse game between two men – journalist Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) and fugitive Jim Grant (Robert Redford) – both attempting to expose the truth and, in the process, redefine their lives. While the film, which is set in the present day, recalls the history and aftermath of the radical antiwar protest movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s (and in particular one of its most violent manifestations, The Weather Underground), it remains a work of fiction. Indeed it was the dramatic potential of the story itself, even more so than the meticulously researched underpinnings of Neil Gordon's 2003 novel, which first attracted Robert Redford to the project.\n\n\"I thought it was a good story and it gave you a chance to look inside of an event that is a piece of American history,\" says Redford of the film, his first as both actor and director since his 2007 drama, Lions for Lambs. \"It truly gets inside how people were living their lives thirty years later... underground and with a false identity.\"\n\n\"For me it was a bit like Les Misé́rables, with the character Jean Valjean sentenced to nineteen years for a loaf of bread,\" Redford explains. \"He escaped from prison, built a false identity, had a daughter, had a good life, but the pain of that time was always going to haunt him. So how do these people deal with that? Do they change? Do they not change? That was the interesting story to be told. It wasn't so much about the antiwar movement itself, because that belongs to history.\"\n\nWorking with fellow producers Bill Holderman, who previously collaborated with Redford on Lions for Lambs and his most recent directorial effort, The Conspirator (2010), and Nicolas Chartier (The Hurt Locker), the project was developed over the course of four years. Adapted by Lem Dobbs, who scripted Haywire and The Limey for Steven Soderbergh, the screenplay centers on Grant's journey as he reconnects with the ghosts of his past – many still living underground – with the hope of ultimately exonerating himself from the murder charges he fled as a student linked to the radical fringe of the antiwar movement. All the while, Ben Shepard and the FBI pursue him, never more than a few steps behind his trail.\n\n\"This is about a group of people that were underground,\" Redford explains. \"They were very close, bonded by the styles of their time, the passions of their time, and now they've grown older and they've taken different paths. Some resent that they did it. Others have remorse. Some believed in it at the time, but feel they have to spend the rest of their lives paying for it. Others feel it was a just cause at the time and still is a cause for today. So there's also all these multiple feelings and relationships – how they all interacted fascinated me.\"\n\nWhile Redford planned both the scenario and the production itself down to the finest detail, he also left considerable elements of the story open to the actors' own interpretations. Indeed, as an actor himself, he encouraged each individual's input.\n\n\"It was a skeletal script at the beginning that he was fleshing out through rehearsal,\" explains Shia LaBeouf (Transformers; Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) of the collaboration between the director and his cast. \"I think it was like 80 pages when I first received it – and then he just started pumping life into it,\" says LaBeouf. \"He allowed twenty pages for the script to evolve. He was still comfortable enough to pull the green-light-trigger on it... And he had the confidence in himself and his team to be able to move forward.\"\n\nLaBeouf points to a scene shared with Brendan Gleeson (The Guard) by way of example, one in which his journalist prods Gleeson's retired police chief for information at an Ann Arbor, Michigan diner. \"That scene didn't even really exist initially,\" explains LaBeouf. \"Then you bring in somebody like Gleeson and you start riffing a bit... Redford allows it to breathe, but it's structured. It's not just ad-libbed – it's very structured as to what needs to be explained and why.\"\n\nHe acts as though he's completely in control, but he allows his film to be as free as something that has no control or boundaries at all, which allows life to exist... which allows real moments to happen and he maintains structure,\" says LaBeouf of Redford. \"It's really amazing what he does and he does it so easily, it seems. That's the beauty of him.\"\n\nINTRO\n\nWith over 52 years in the business, 30 films as a producer, nine as director and an estimated 66 screen-roles to his credit, Robert Redford is one of the most influential figures in the film industry. He has received two Oscars®; the first for his directorial debut, Ordinary People in 1980, the second for Lifetime Achievement in 2002. He is also the founder of The Sundance Institute, and with it, The Sundance Film Festival, known for their passionate commitment and immeasurable contribution to independent cinema. For THE COMPANY YOU KEEP, Redford would call upon his experience and passion to bring the film and central character to life, shepherding his own independent project forward over the course of several years with his producing partners.\n\nThough clearly captivated by the character of Jim Grant – his sense of loyalty, nobility and integrity – Redford is nevertheless quick to point out the differences between himself and the man we see on screen. \"At that time, I was raising a family and starting a career, so I wasn't involved politically,\" he says. \"The activism in my life was centered around the environment. On the other hand, I had a lot of friends who were involved. I saw what was happening; I could see the good of it. The reason people were so passionate was because there was a draft then... People didn't want to fight a war they didn't believe in and so they rebelled against it. I sympathized with that at the time, but I didn't get involved.\"\n\nAlthough Redford ultimately welcomed the task of directing and simultaneously playing the leading role on screen, he did have his initial reservations – along with his own unique approach.\n\n\"I think you have to be schizophrenic in a controlled way,\" he explains. \"To act and direct is not something that I'm particularly drawn to. When I act, I like to be free to act and when I'm directing I like to be free to look at the situation in the way the conductor of an orchestra would. Instead of being a single instrument, you're looking at how they all come together and create a story.\"\n\n\"I was just in awe of him,\" says rising star, Brit Marling, who stars as Brendan Gleeson's daughter, Rebecca Osborne, of working with Redford. \"It was an incredible experience just to be a part of it.\"\n\n\"He's just a great guy, a wonderful guy,\" says Richard Jenkins, who plays one of Grant's former cohorts, the former radical and now ‘respectable,' history professor, Jed Lewis. \"You can tell that just by this cast. He asks you to do something and you go, ‘Sure...'\n\n\"I would say he's one of the sweetest people I've ever met,\" says Julie Christie, who plays Redford's former lover and fellow underground fugitive, Mimi Lurie, on screen. \"He has an enormous sweetness which is quite striking. But he also knows what he wants and as a director he's absolutely single-minded about getting it.\"\n\n\"I met him as a fan and that stayed throughout the entirety of our whole working relationship,\" says Shia LaBeouf of his close collaboration with Redford as director and co-star. \"But he also has a way of diminishing that fan bubble and getting right to work. I got my script on the very first day I met him. And it was right to work.\"\n\nBIO\n\nROBERT REDFORD has won wide acclaim for his work as an actor, producer, director, champion of independent film and environmentalist. He won an Academy Award®, a DGA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for best direction for his feature directing debut, the intensely emotional family drama Ordinary People. He was also nominated for an Academy Award® for directing Quiz Show.\n\nAs an actor, he earned an Academy Award® nomination for his performance in The Sting. In 2002, he received an honorary Academy Award® recognizing his achievements as an actor, director, producer, and the creator of Sundance Institute. Redford also directed and produced The Milagro Beanfield War, A River Runs Through It, The Horse Whisperer, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Lions for Lambs, and The Conspirator, and served as executive producer and narrator of Incident at Oglala, a documentary about the Native American activist Leonard Peltier.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, California, Redford attended the University of Colorado but left school after two years to travel through Europe, studying art in Paris and Florence. He continued his art studies when he returned to the U.S. by enrolling at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. At the suggestion of an instructor, Redford moved to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where a passion for acting superseded his interest in pictorial art. A small part on Broadway led to roles in several major live television dramas, and, in 1961, he made his feature debut in War Hunt.\n\nLater that year, he starred in his first Broadway show, Sunday in New York, which was soon followed by Barefoot in the Park. It was the film version of Barefoot in the Park that first brought him both public and industry notice. Redford went on to portray an array of characters in a spectrum of films, many from his own production company, Wildwood Enterprises.\n\nUnder the Wildwood banner, Redford starred in Downhill Racer and The Candidate, and he produced and starred in All the President's Men. Other film roles include Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were, The Three Days of the Condor, Brubaker, The Natural, Out of Africa, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, The Last Castle, Spy Game, The Clearing, and An Unfinished Life. Redford received the 1997 National Medal for the Arts from President Clinton. In December 2005, Redford accepted the Kennedy Center Honors for his \"distinguished achievement in the performing arts and in recognition of his extraordinary contributions to the life of our country.\"\n\nINTRO\n\nShia LaBeouf came to international prominence thanks largely to his roles in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the immensely popular Transformers film series. With THE COMPANY YOU KEEP, the actor saw a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with Robert Redford, along with an incredible role in Ben Shepard.\n\n\"When I read the script, I saw Ben as an idealist,\" says LaBeouf. \"I looked at Redford and Dustin Hoffman in All the President's Men (Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film on the Watergate scandal); there was a bit of both of them there. To me, Ben was an amalgamation of those two men. I pitched that idea to Bob and he was very comfortable with it.\"\n\n\"Still, Ben's a complex character and, admittedly, a bit of a fame-whore too,\" says LaBeouf, with a smile. \"In a sense, he's living in a turtle shell. He's all about him. He's all about making that turtle shell bigger – and it's all self-propelled insanity, really. He's all about getting famous for being the best reporter in the world and he's got the story... But at the same time his life doesn't have a lot of love in it. He's in solitude. He's the kind of guy who googles himself every night for self validation. Ben is like that, and then he finds a woman like he's never known and he chases that dream in the midst.\"\n\n\"In the story I meet Shia's character who's a reporter and I'm guarded; I don't exactly trust him,\" says Brit Marling, who plays Rebecca Osborne, of their relationship on screen. \"And then we sort of get to know one another and it turns out I may have a right to be guarded.\"\n\n\"It's a very political movie, but it's also just very fundamentally human,\" Marling continues. \"I don't think it works to make a movie that's just about politics, because movies are ultimately about moving people. When you talk about politics, but it's buried within a human story, the audience is more willing to open up and let those ideas in along with the emotions.\"\n\nUltimately for LaBeouf, there was also the attraction of playing a role unlike any he's done before. \"I'm playing the antagonist for the first time, which is really fun for me,\" says the young star. \"It's sexy as hell to do that. And for the protagonist to be Robert Redford is really wild for me. To be on the same poster as Robert Redford is really wild for me... Throw in that cast that we had, those really amazing actors who brought so much cool stuff to the table and really fleshed out the script – it was just an amazing ride. \"\n\nBIO\n\nShia LaBeouf has secured his place as one of the new generation of Hollywood leading men.\n\nIn addition to his participation in the all-star ensemble cast of Robert Redford's The Company You Keep (2013), Shia can be seen in the crime drama Lawless for director John Hillcoat. The film, set against the backdrop of Depression-era bootlegging, also stars Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska, and debuted in Cannes to a standing ovation.\n\nFollowing Lawless, Shia stars in The Company You Keep, directed by Robert Redford. The story centers on a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run from a journalist who has discovered his identity. The film co-stars an award-winning ensemble cast that includes Robert Redford, Julie Christie, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon and Chris Cooper.\n\nShia most recently wrapped production in Romania on The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman opposite Evan Rachel Wood and Melissa Leo. The film focuses on Charlie and his romantic exploits with a girl who was previously claimed by a mob boss with a penchant for violence and a gang at his disposal.\n\nIn 2011, LaBeouf was seen in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which marked his third and final turn as Sam Witwicky. Also in 2011, he starred opposite Michael Douglas in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, directed by Oliver Stone. In 2008, he starred in the fourth installment of Steven Spielberg's \"Indiana Jones\" series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opposite Harrison Ford; teamed with director D.J. Caruso for a second time on the thriller Eagle Eye, co-starring Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis; and appeared with Julie Christie and John Hurt in the Anthony Minghella-scripted segment of New York I Love You, a romantic anthology. Additional film credits include: Disturbia; the Oscar® nominated animated film Surf's Up; A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints; Bobby; The Greatest Game Ever Played; I, Robot; Constantine; Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle; and HBO's Project Greenlight feature The Battle of Shaker Heights, produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. He made his feature film debut in the 2003 comedy Holes, based on the best-selling book by Louis Sachar.\n\nIn 2007 Shia was named the Star of Tomorrow by the ShoWest convention of the National Association of Theater Owners, and in February 2008, he was awarded the BAFTA Orange Rising Star Award, which was voted for by the British general public. In addition, he was nominated for four Teen Choice Awards for Transformers, winning the Breakout Male Award; the Teen Choice Award for Movie Actor in a Horror/Thriller for his performance in Disturbia, as well as a Scream Award. In 2004, he was nominated for the Young Artists Award for Leading Young Actor in a Feature Film and the Breakthrough Male Performance at the MTV Movie Awards for his performance in Holes.\n\nOn television, LaBeouf garnered much praise for his portrayal of Louis Stevens on the Disney Channel's original series Even Stevens. In 2003, he earned a Daytime Emmy award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his work on the highly rated family show.\n\nLaBeouf currently resides in California.\n\nINTRO\n\nSince bursting onto the scene in 1965 with her Oscar®-winning performance in John Schlesinger's Darling, Julie Christie has remained a perennial force in motion pictures. With a career spanning over fifty years and over fifty film and television projects, the British actress has starred in such popular and critically acclaimed hits as David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, Francois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451, Schlesinger's Far from the Madding Crowd, Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Hal Ashby's Shampoo, along with more recent films like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (for director Alfonso Cuaró́n) and Catherine Hardwicke's 2011 film, Red Riding Hood, with Amanda Seyfried.\n\nStill, it was Christie's performance as a woman suffering from Alzheimer's in Away From Her which caught the attention of Robert Redford (the film was featured at Sundance), the industry and audiences alike. It also marked Christie's fourth Oscar® nomination in 2008, along with Golden Globe, SAG and National Board of Review awards for her performance.\n\n\"I had always admired Robert Redford for his work, his environmental activities and of course, his amazing achievement with Sundance,\" says Christie, who welcomed the overdue opportunity to work with Redford on screen. Indeed, while the two veteran performers had started their careers at roughly the same time, neither had worked together until Redford cast the British actress in THE COMPANY YOU KEEP.\n\nHere, Christie stars as committed radical Mimi Lurie. Like Redford's Jim Grant, Lurie is also a former member of the Weather Underground, living under various false identities since becoming a fugitive as a young woman. Unlike Grant, however, she remains unrepentant about her past, while holding the key to her former lover's future.\n\n\"In the film, she's perceived as a terrorist because of her activities in the 70s,\" says Christie of the character. \"They were targeting these particular institutions, to cast light on what was going on in Vietnam, because the nonviolent action they were involved in seemed to be going nowhere.\"\n\n\"From her own perspective she's gone underground and remained underground because she believes that to hand herself over would be collaborating with those very forces she's been fighting; an acceptance of their mores, which she deplores,\" Christie explains. \"She would be perceived by a lot of people as having tunnel vision, when in fact she has enormous vision. The problem with ‘enormous vision' though is that you can see all sides of the equation and you have to choose out of all those sides... You choose what you think is the most effective way of operating, whereas most people follow what they are told to follow. That's the real tunnel vision.\"\n\nKnown for her own, at times controversial, political views, Christie could empathize with the character while simultaneously noting the need of making a \"stretch\" to portray her. \"In the end what she has is enormous integrity,\" says the acclaimed actress. \"I would say, ‘painful' integrity, because integrity is a painful business.\"\n\nBIO\n\nBorn in Assam, India, Julie Christie attended school in England, but at sixteen moved to Paris to study art. Later she became a drama student in London, gained experience on stage, and appeared on television before making her screen debut in John Schlesinger's Billy Liar. Just two years later, she re-teamed with Schlesinger for Darling, which earned her an Academy Award® for Best Actress, and that same year she starred in David Lean's epic, Dr. Zhivago, as the beautiful, love-torn Lara.\n\nIn 1971, Christie garnered her second Academy Award® nomination for Best Actress for her role in Robert Altman's western McCabe & Mrs. Miller, a film which also was her first of three screen collaborations with Warren Beatty, the other two being Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait.\n\nAfter slowing her output of films in the 1980s, Christie returned to mainstream movies with a string of more recent high-profile releases, including Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Afterglow (for which she received her third Academy Award® nomination), Troy, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Neverland, and Away From Her, for which she received her fourth Oscar® nomination for Best Actress.\n\nChristie stars among an all-star ensemble cast in Robert Redford's The Company You Keep (2013) as Redford's former lover, an unrepentent former 1970s radical who has been living underground for thirty years.\n\nTerrence Howard is best known for his Golden Globe and Academy Award ® nominated work in Hustle & Flow, as well as for his supporting role in Crash, for which he received a National Board of Review Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. Born in Chicago, IL, Howard began his acting career as Jackie Jackson in the ABC miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream, which was quickly followed by several notable TV appearances on shows such as Living Single and NYPD Blue. He made his film debut in 1993 in Who's the Man? which he followed with the role of Cowboy in the period saga Dead Presidents. In 1995 Howard was noticed for his role as a star high school athlete in Mr. Holland's Opus, and soon after was offered a lead role in the UPN TV series Sparks. In 1999, Howard was honored with the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor, an Independent Spirit Award nomination and a Chicago Film Critics Association Award nomination for his role as Quentin in The Best Man.\n\nPrior to his participation in the all-star ensemble cast of Robert Redford's The Company You Keep (2013), Howard's feature film credits include diverse roles in the Academy Award® nominated Ray, Pride, The Brave One, August Rush, and Iron Man. He also appeared on Broadway with the legendary James Earl Jones in Debbie Allen's revival production of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\n\nA self taught musician, Howard plays both the piano and the guitar. He displays his musical talents in Ray as Ray Charles' one-time guitarist Gossie McKee, and in Hustle & Flow as the rapper Djay. For the movie, Howard performed all the tracks for his ® character, including \"It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp,\" which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nHoward was recently seen in Law and Order: Los Angeles, where he won an NAACP award for best supporting actor in a drama series. Howard recently starred alongside Cuba Gooding Jr. and Bryan Cranston in George Lucas' Red Tails.\n\nHoward will be seen playing Nelson Mandela alongside Jennifer Hudson in Winnie; and in On the Road alongside Garrett Hedlund and Viggo Mortensen. In 2013, Terrence will star alongside Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace in the thriller Dead Man Down, as well as The Butler alongside Oprah Winfrey, Forrest Whitaker, Liam Neeson and Nicole Kidman, House of Bodies along with Queen Latifah and Peter Fonda, Lullaby alongside Garrett Hedlund, Jennifer Hudson and Fellini Black and White. Howard will also be one of the many All Stars appearing in an upcoming Untitled Farrelly Brothers comedy which includes Gerard Butler, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Kate Winslet, Josh Duhamel, Elizabeth Banks, Uma Thurman and Hugh Jackman.\n\nTerrence has become an Ambassador for Stand Up To Cancer and the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF). Howard has been very involved in cancer research, and done many public service announcements for the cause. Earlier this year South Carolina State University conferred an honorary doctorate upon Dr. Terrence Dashon Howard. He is the father of three.\n\nAcademy Award® nominated Richard Jenkins is one of the most in-demand character actors in Hollywood, having made over sixty feature films.\n\nJenkins received an Oscar® nomination for Best Actor for his highly praised performance in director Tom McCarthy's The Visitor. The film premiered to critical acclaim at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival and the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and won the Grand Prix at the 34th Deauville Festival of American Film. Richard's performance as 'Walter Vale', a disillusioned Connecticut economics professor whose life is transformed by a chance encounter in New York City, made The Visitor the independent film hit of 2008 and also earned him Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\n\nPrior to his participation in the all-star ensemble cast of Robert Redford's The Company You Keep (2013), Jenkins has appeared in a number of films released in 2012, including Drew Goddard's horror thriller, The Cabin in the Woods for Lionsgate, also starring Chris Hemsworth and Bradley Whitford; Lawrence Kasdan's Darling Companion opposite Kevin Kline, Diane Keaton and Dianne Wiest; Killing Them Softly by Andrew Dominik with Brad Pitt; and Christopher McQuarrie's film, Jack Reacher, opposite Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall. In addition, he appears opposite Josh Radnor, Elizabeth Olsen and Allison Janney in Radnor's film, Liberal Arts, which premiered to rave reviews and a standing ovation at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.

He has received two Oscars®; the first for his directorial debut, Ordinary People in 1980, the second for Lifetime Achievement in 2002. He is also the founder of The Sundance Institute, and with it, The Sundance Film Festival, known for their passionate commitment and immeasurable contribution to independent cinema. For THE COMPANY YOU KEEP, Redford would call upon his experience and passion to bring the film and central character to life, shepherding his own independent project forward over the course of several years with his producing partners.\n\nThough clearly captivated by the character of Jim Grant – his sense of loyalty, nobility and integrity – Redford is nevertheless quick to point out the differences between himself and the man we see on screen. \"At that time, I was raising a family and starting a career, so I wasn't involved politically,\" he says. \"The activism in my life was centered around the environment. On the other hand, I had a lot of friends who were involved. I saw what was happening; I could see the good of it. The reason people were so passionate was because there was a draft then... People didn't want to fight a war they didn't believe in and so they rebelled against it. I sympathized with that at the time, but I didn't get involved.\"\n\nAlthough Redford ultimately welcomed the task of directing and simultaneously playing the leading role on screen, he did have his initial reservations – along with his own unique approach.\n\n\"I think you have to be schizophrenic in a controlled way,\" he explains. \"To act and direct is not something that I'm particularly drawn to. When I act, I like to be free to act and when I'm directing I like to be free to look at the situation in the way the conductor of an orchestra would. Instead of being a single instrument, you're looking at how they all come together and create a story.\"\n\n\"I was just in awe of him,\" says rising star, Brit Marling, who stars as Brendan Gleeson's daughter, Rebecca Osborne, of working with Redford. \"It was an incredible experience just to be a part of it.\"\n\n\"He's just a great guy, a wonderful guy,\" says Richard Jenkins, who plays one of Grant's former cohorts, the former radical and now ‘respectable,' history professor, Jed Lewis. \"You can tell that just by this cast. He asks you to do something and you go, ‘Sure...'\n\n\"I would say he's one of the sweetest people I've ever met,\" says Julie Christie, who plays Redford's former lover and fellow underground fugitive, Mimi Lurie, on screen. \"He has an enormous sweetness which is quite striking. But he also knows what he wants and as a director he's absolutely single-minded about getting it.\"\n\n\"I met him as a fan and that stayed throughout the entirety of our whole working relationship,\" says Shia LaBeouf of his close collaboration with Redford as director and co-star. \"But he also has a way of diminishing that fan bubble and getting right to work. I got my script on the very first day I met him. And it was right to work.\"\n\nBIO\n\nROBERT REDFORD has won wide acclaim for his work as an actor, producer, director, champion of independent film and environmentalist. He won an Academy Award®, a DGA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for best direction for his feature directing debut, the intensely emotional family drama Ordinary People. He was also nominated for an Academy Award® for directing Quiz Show.\n\nAs an actor, he earned an Academy Award® nomination for his performance in The Sting. In 2002, he received an honorary Academy Award® recognizing his achievements as an actor, director, producer, and the creator of Sundance Institute. Redford also directed and produced The Milagro Beanfield War, A River Runs Through It, The Horse Whisperer, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Lions for Lambs, and The Conspirator, and served as executive producer and narrator of Incident at Oglala, a documentary about the Native American activist Leonard Peltier.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, California, Redford attended the University of Colorado but left school after two years to travel through Europe, studying art in Paris and Florence. He continued his art studies when he returned to the U.S. by enrolling at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. At the suggestion of an instructor, Redford moved to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where a passion for acting superseded his interest in pictorial art. A small part on Broadway led to roles in several major live television dramas, and, in 1961, he made his feature debut in War Hunt.\n\nLater that year, he starred in his first Broadway show, Sunday in New York, which was soon followed by Barefoot in the Park. It was the film version of Barefoot in the Park that first brought him both public and industry notice. Redford went on to portray an array of characters in a spectrum of films, many from his own production company, Wildwood Enterprises.\n\nUnder the Wildwood banner, Redford starred in Downhill Racer and The Candidate, and he produced and starred in All the President's Men. Other film roles include Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were, The Three Days of the Condor, Brubaker, The Natural, Out of Africa, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, The Last Castle, Spy Game, The Clearing, and An Unfinished Life. Redford received the 1997 National Medal for the Arts from President Clinton. In December 2005, Redford accepted the Kennedy Center Honors for his \"distinguished achievement in the performing arts and in recognition of his extraordinary contributions to the life of our country.\"\n\nSão Paulo-born Adriano Goldman is currently working with John Wells on August: Osage County, starring Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. In addition to his work as DP on Robert Redford's The Company You Keep, Goldman recently wrapped Closed (starring Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall) directed by John Crowley. Goldman also shot Fernando Meirelles' 360, starring Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Anthony Hopkins. Goldman's previous credits include Jane Eyre, which stars Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, and marks his second collaboration with director Cary Fukunaga. They first partnered on the immigrant thriller Sin Nombre that earned Goldman his first Independent Spirit Award nomination and the Excellence in Cinematography Award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. Goldman also shot Tony Goldwyn's Conviction, starring Hilary Swank, which received a number of nominations and awards.\n\nThe award-winning Goldman got his start as a camera operator for director/producer Fernando Meirelles' company and soon after directed and photographed his first short, Is Renaldo Still Swimming? which won top prizes at both the São Paulo Fotoptica Video Festival and the Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba. Over the next decade, he earned his stripes in the commercial and music video world by forging a strong relationship with MTV Brazil, where he directed the inaugural acoustic program Unplugged for the popular music network as well as Sepultura's rendition of Orgasmatron, which took home the International Viewer's Choice Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. Goldman's musical prowess enabled him to capture the raw spontaneity on the live concert films Emories, Chronicles and Declarations of Love for acclaimed female vocalist Marisa Monte, and Kaya N'Gan Daya for Brazilian superstar Gilberto Gil. In 2002, he reteamed with Meirelles to shoot the first of eventually four seasons of the TV Globo/O2 Filmes smash hit television series City of Men, based on the visionary filmmaker's City of God.\n\nGoldman's dazzling work in spotlighting two teens living in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro earned him the ABC Trophy for Best Cinematography in a Television Series. The team embarked on the feature film version helmed by Paulo Morelli in 2006, which was released domestically by Miramax and served as a fitting coda for the 35 million faithful viewers. Goldman's color-infused, handheld camerawork was instrumental in depicting the emotional plight of these sympathetic characters.\n\nAmongst his other credits are the Brazilian version of the popular Canadian Shakespeare series Slings & Arrows for Fernando Meirelles, and two high-profile series for HBO Latin America: the 13-episode arc Alice and the Cao Hamburger-helmed Sons of Carnival, for which Goldman garnered his second ABC trophy. Other notable films include Romance by Guel Arraes, Casseta & Planeta: The Cup is Ours directed by Lula Buarque, Bruno Barreto's Romeo & Juliet Get Married, and Hamburger's The Year My Parents Went on Vacation, which netted Goldman his third ABC trophy win for Best Cinematography, this time for a feature film.\n\nCliff Martinez, who was born in the Bronx, but raised in Ohio, moved to California in 1976 landing in the middle of the punk movement. After stints as the drummer for The Weirdos, Lydia Lunch and Foetus front-man Jim Thirlwell, and the final incarnation of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, Martinez joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers (playing on the band's first two albums) and later The Dickies. It was during his tenure with The Chili Peppers that Cliff began exploring the new technologies of that era, which would eventually guide him towards the film music world.\n\nA tape Martinez had put together using these new technologies made its rounds, leading him to score an episode of Pee-wee's Playhouse. The same recording also ended up in Steven Soderbergh's hands and Martinez was hired to score the famed director's first theatrical release 1989's sex, lies, and videotape. Martinez's longstanding relationship with Soderbergh has continued through the years and they have worked together on ten theatrical releases including Kafka, The Limey, Traffic, Solaris and 2011's Contagion.\n\nPerhaps it is because of his time in the punk scene that Martinez's approach to scoring is nontraditional. His scores tend towards being stark and sparse, utilizing a modern tonal palette to paint the backdrop for films that are often dark, psychological stories like Pump Up the Volume (1990), The Limey (2009) Wonderland (2003), Wicker Park (2004), and Drive (2011). Martinez has been nominated for a Grammy Award (Steven Soderbergh's Traffic), a Cesar Award (Xavier Giannoli's A L'origine), and a Broadcast Film Critics Award (Drive).\n\nStill the drummer at heart, Martinez's use of audio manipulations, particularly for percussive sounds, has been evolving through the years and is evident by the hammered dulcimer of Kafka (1991), the gray-areas between sound design and score for Traffic (2000), the steel drums and textures of Solaris (2002), what Martinez called ‘rhythmi- tizing pitched, ambient textures' of Narc (2002), and ‘using percussion performances to trigger and shape the rhythmic and tonal characteristics of those ambient textures,' as he described his score for 2011's The Lincoln Lawyer.\n\nCliff Martinez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012 with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He recently served as a juror for the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and served on the International Feature nominating committee for 2011 Film Independent Spirit Awards. Martinez's upcoming films include Robert Redford's The Company You Keep, Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers (co-composed with Skrillex), and Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives."
