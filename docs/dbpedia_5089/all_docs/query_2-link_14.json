        "text": "Adam Beach was born in Ashern, Manitoba, the son of Sally and Dennis Beach, and was raised on the Dog Creek First Nations Reserve, with his two brothers. A troubled childhood saw his mother killed by a drunk driver, and his alcoholic father drowned only weeks afterward. The three brothers went to live with their grandmother and then with their uncle and aunt in Winnipeg, where Adam joined drama classes and began acting in local theatre productions.\n\nSince then he has appeared in over 60 films and television programs. His performance in the Academy Award-nominated Clint Eastwood-directed Flags of Our Fathers (2006) was phenomenal. He played Ira Hayes, a Pima Native American who was one of the six US Marines to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima and who found the resulting fame hard to handle, subsequently giving way to alcoholism. This alone would have been an emotional role for Adam to play; however, during filming, both his grandmother and best friend passed away. His role as Hayes is both realistic and heartbreaking, earning him two Best Supporting Actor Award Nominations. He stands out well above the rest of the cast.\n\nAdam has been further nominated for three Awards for his role in Begrabt mein Herz am Wounded Knee (2007) including a Golden Globe. He has put in terrific performances in the comedy film Joe Dreck (2001) and the John Woo World War II war epic Windtalkers (2002) in which he co-starred with Nicolas Cage.\n\nHe headlined the cast in the Walt Disney production Squanto - Der große Krieger (1994), featured in John Singleton's Vier Brüder (2005) and starred with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the science fiction-western smash hit Cowboys & Aliens (2011). He had a starring recurring role in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) and Big Love (2006).\n\nIn 2016, he played Christopher Weiss / Slipknot in the supervillain film Suicide Squad (2016).\n\nAdam hopes to be appointed leader of his Lake Manitoba First Nation.\n\nCharlize Theron was born in Benoni, a city in the greater Johannesburg area, in South Africa, the only child of Gerda Theron (née Maritz) and Charles Theron. She was raised on a farm outside the city. Theron is of Afrikaner (Dutch, with some French Huguenot and German) descent, and Afrikaner military figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle.\n\nTheron received an education as a ballet dancer and has danced both the \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Nutcracker\". There was not much work for a young actress or dancer in South Africa, so she soon traveled to Europe and the United States, where she got a job at the Joffrey Ballet in New York. She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career.\n\nIn 1994, her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard, but without any luck. She went to a bank to cash a check for $500 she received from her mother, and became furious when she learned that the bank would not cash it because it was an out-of-state check. She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange for learning American English, which she did by watching soap operas on television.\n\nHer first role was in the B-film Kinder des Zorns 3 - Das Chicago-Massaker (1995), a non-speaking part with three seconds of screen time. Her next role was as Helga Svelgen in 2 Tage in L.A. (1996), which landed her the role of Tina Powers in That Thing You Do! (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies like Im Auftrag des Teufels (1997), Mein großer Freund Joe (1998), Gottes Werk und Teufels Beitrag (1999), Die Legende von Bagger Vance (2000) and The Italian Job - Jagd auf Millionen (2003). On February 29, 2004, she won her first Academy Award, a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Monster (2003).\n\nIt took a summer of acting in a children's theater group to convince Matthew Morrison that he wanted to become an actor. He auditioned and attended Orange County High School of the Arts, and followed that with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, although he didn't enjoy his college foray. Despite a regulation that students couldn't audition in the first two years at NYU, he got himself an agent and dropped out from NYU. His musical debut was in the musical version of Footloose (1984), which was then followed by \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\" His big break, however, was in \"Hairspray\" when he landed the part of \"Link Larkin.\" It was after this role that he made a debut into the television and film world, with small roles in Sex and the City (1998), Die Straßen von Philadelphia (2002), Steinzeit Junior (1992), and others. His self-proclaimed favorite role he did in television was in Es war einmal... Die Prinzessin auf der Erbse (2005), a musical for TV that starred Carol Burnett. He was nominated for a Tony for his role in \"The Light in the Piazza\" and eventually left the show in late 2005. He dabbled some more in roles among the television, film, and theater world. After starring in the Lincoln Center production of \"South Pacific\" as \"Lieutenant Cable\" in 2008, he took on the role of \"Will Schuester\" in the upcoming Fox series Glee (2009), which premiers in fall 2009.\n\nScott Eastwood is an American actor and model. He was born as Scott Clinton Reeves in Carmel, Monterey County, California, to Jacelyn Ann Reeves, a flight attendant, and Clint Eastwood, an actor and director. He grew up in Hawaii. Scott has a younger sister, Kathryn Reeves, and many half-siblings.\n\nScott made his film debut in Flags of Our Fathers (2006), directed by his father, and has also appeared in the film Gran Torino (2008). He has since co-starred in the sports drama Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009), as union rugby player Joel Stransky. Eastwood played the lead role in Enter Nowhere (2011), appeared in the dramas Farben der Liebe (2012) and Back in the Game (2012), and the horror sequel Texas Chainsaw 3D - The Legend Is Back (2013), as Deputy Hartman. He had a supporting role in David Ayer's war action film Herz aus Stahl (2014), as Sergeant Miles, and in the drama Die perfekte Welle (2014), appeared in the 2015 music video for Taylor Swift's \"Wildest Dreams,\" and starred alongside Britt Robertson in the film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel Kein Ort ohne Dich (2015).\n\nEastwood appeared in the drama Mercury Plains (2016), and played Lieutenant GQ Edwards in the film Suicide Squad (2016), an adaptation of the DC Comics series. The same year, he starred alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley in the biographical drama film Snowden (2016), directed by Oliver Stone. He appeared in the comedy Walk of Fame (2017), played a special agent in the action film Fast & Furious 8 (2017), and starred in Overdrive (2017), a thriller film which was shot in Paris and Marseille. He starred as Nate Lambert in the science fiction follow-up Pacific Rim 2: Uprising (2018).\n\nThe middle child between two sisters, Zachary Levi was born as Zachary Levi Pugh on September 29, 1980 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Susan (Hoctor) and Darrell Alton Pugh. He uses his middle name as his stage surname because his birth name, \"Pugh\", which is of Welsh origin, sounds too much like \"Pew.\" His other ancestry includes Irish, English, French, German, Scottish, and Swiss. He grew up all over the country before his family put down roots in Ventura County, California. At the early age of six, Zachary began acting, singing and dancing in school and local theater productions.\n\nAfter graduating from Buena High School he headed to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of acting. Zachary began acting in theater, performing roles in such regional productions like Grease, The Outsiders, Oliver, The Wizard of Oz, and Big River. It was his portrayal of Jesus in Ojai's Godspell that brought him to the attention of Hollywood.\n\nHe had a supporting role in the television movie Big Shot - Wie das Leben so spielt (2002) with David Krumholtz, Tory Kittles, Jennifer Morrison, and Nicholas Turturro. He then began acting as Kipp Steadman in the TV series Office Girl (2002) with Sara Rue, Andrea Parker, Eric Roberts, Andy Dick, and Sherri Shepherd.\n\nHe was seen in the television movie See Jane Date (2003) on the WB with Charisma Carpenter, Holly Marie Combs, Linda Dano, and Rachelle Lefevre. In his spare time, Zachary enjoys skateboarding, snowboarding, skydiving, and participating in various other sports. After living in Los Angeles for the better part of a decade, he recently moved to Austin, Texas.\n\nIn 2019 he starred in the action-comedy film Shazam! (2019), playing the title superhero; a magic-created older version of teenager Billy Batson played by Asher Angel. The film and his comic-heroic performance received positive notices.\n\nBlake Ellender Lively was born Blake Ellender Brown on August 25, 1987 in Los Angeles, California to Elaine Lively & Ernie Lively. Her brother is actor Eric Lively, and her half-siblings are actors Lori Lively, Robyn Lively and Jason Lively. She followed her parents' and siblings' steps. Her first role was Trixie, the Tooth Fairy in the musical movie Sandman (1998), directed by her father. Her big break came along a few years later, though. Blake was up to finish high school when she got the co-starring role of Bridget in Eine für 4 (2005).\n\nBlake was so perfect for the role of Bridget that, with no big references or even auditioning, she landed the role. According to her, all she did was walk in and leave a photo of herself. It was clear that she was the Bridget needed. After the film, Blake went back to high school for her senior year to have the life of a regular teenager -- or a very busy regular teenager. She was class president, a cheerleader, and performed with the choir.\n\nMario Van Peebles is a highly regarded director, actor, producer and writer. His directorial skills can be seen in the retelling of the epic mini-series \"Roots\" starring Forest Whitaker and Matthew Goode. Van Peebles has directed award-winning shows such as the recent hit \"Empire\" and \"The Last Ship,\" as well as \"Sons of Anarchy,\" \"Lost,\" \"Damages,\" and \"Boss.\" As an actor Van Peebles has credits are as equally impressive.\n\nAn independent filmmaker to his core, Van Pebbles grew up watching Melvin Van Peebles, his maverick filmmaker father. A true master craftsman in his own right, Van Peebles is defined as a director, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and composer; known for funding his own work.\n\nHis many talents can be seen in films like his directorial breakout hit \"New Jack City,\" \"Posse\" and \"Panther;\" plus Michael Mann's Oscar® nominated \"Ali,\" in which he received critical acclaim for his role as real life minister and human rights activist Malcom X; the multi-award-winning \"Cotton Club\" written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Clint Eastwood's \"Heartbreak Ridge;\" and several projects with Ava DuVernay.\n\nThroughout his career, Van Peebles has brought challenging, compelling material to the screen, including his hip hop coming-of-age film \"We the Party,\" for which he wrote, directed and produced; his documentary short \"Bring You're a Game;\" and, of course, \"Baadasssss!\" This was Van Peebles' odyssey about the making of his father's groundbreaking film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" and was one of Ebert and Roeper's ten best movies of the year for 2004.\n\nAs a director, Van Pebbles has affected unusually strong performances from his fellow actors. They often remark that he creates a collaborative climate where they feel free to do their best work. He believes his background as an actor helps him approach the actor's character development process internally. Conversely, he believes being a director has made him a more trusting, nuanced actor. Being able to do both is like creative crop rotation for Van Peebles. Not many directors get the privilege of being directed by other strong filmmakers. Acting for others is still \"super exciting\" to him.\n\nIn 1994, Hofstra University awarded Van Peebles an honorary doctorate of humane letters. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, Van Peebles spent two years working at New York's Department of Environmental Protection before moving to Hollywood to try his hand at acting writing and directing.\n\nIn addition to directing and acting in features, Van Peebles is passionate about supporting education and eco-consciousness through media. With his reality show, Mario's Green House, he teamed up with his five children and his father to chronicle the Van Peebles family's often-humorous attempts to raise their eco-consciousness as they try to go green in Hollywood. Green \"We never got to the full green, more like Olive green,\" jokes Van Peebles.\n\nJames Wan (born 26 February 1977) is an Australian film producer, screenwriter and film director of Malaysian Chinese descent. He is widely known for directing the horror film Saw (2004) and creating Billy the puppet. Wan has also directed Dead Silence: Ein Wort. Und du bist tot. (2007), Death Sentence - Todesurteil (2007), Insidious (2010), Conjuring - Die Heimsuchung (2013) and Fast & Furious 7 (2015).\n\nBefore his success in the mainstream film industry, he made his first feature-length film, Stygian, with Shannon Young, which won \"Best Guerrilla Film\" at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival (MUFF) in 2000.\n\nPrior to 2003, Wan and Leigh Whannell had begun writing a script based for a horror film, citing inspiration from their dreams and fears. Upon completing the script, Leigh and James had wanted to select an excerpt from their script, later to be known as Saw (2004), and film it to pitch their film to studios. With the help of Charlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Leigh and James shot the film with relatively no budget. Leigh had decided to star in the film as well.\n\nAfter the release of the full-length Saw (2004), the film was met with overwhelming success in the box office both domestically and internationally. The film ended up grossing 55 million dollars in America, and 48 million dollars in other countries, totaling over $103 million worldwide. This was over 100 million dollars profit, over 80 times the production budget. This green-lit the sequel Saw 2 (2005), and later the rest of the Saw franchise based on the yearly success of the previous installment. Since its inception, Saw (2004) has become the highest grossing horror franchise of all time worldwide in unadjusted dollars. In the United States only, Saw (2004) is the second highest grossing horror franchise, behind only the Freitag, der 13. (1980) films by a margin of $10 million.\n\nA graduate of Wesleyan University, Michael Bay spent his 20s working on advertisements and music videos. His first projects after film school were in the music video business. He created music videos for Tina Turner, Meat Loaf, Lionel Richie, Wilson Phillips, Donny Osmond and Divinyls. His work won him recognition and a number of MTV award nominations. He also filmed advertisements for Nike, Reebok, Coca-Cola, Budweiser and Miller Lite. He won the Grand Prix Clio for Commercial of the Year for his \"Got Milk/Aaron Burr\" commercial. At Cannes, he has won the Gold Lion for The Best Beer campaign for Miller Lite, as well as the Silver for \"Got Milk\". In 1995, Bay was honored by the Directors Guild of America as Commercial Director of the Year. That same year, he also directed his first feature film, Bad Boys - Harte Jungs (1995), starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, which grossed more than $160 million, worldwide. His follow-up film, The Rock: Fels der Entscheidung (1996), starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, was also hugely successful, making Bay the director du jour."
