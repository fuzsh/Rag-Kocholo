A golfer struggling to revive his moribund career earns a new lease on his passion thanks to the help of a mystical caddy.

ABSTRACT

Rannulph Junuh, pride of Savannah, Georgia and a promising golfer, devolves into a tortured existence filled with drinking after a traumatic tour of duty in World War I. Years later, once-wealthy girlfriend Adele Invergordon sets out to restore her family's fortune, decimated by the Great Depression, through a series of golf tournaments, turning to Junuh as a former talent designed to generate local interest by participating. Junuh, unable to reignite his once-promising career at first, ultimately finds guidance in the form of mysterious caddy Bagger Vance, a kind soul implied to hail from a dimension other than our own who teaches Rannulph to cope with issues both on and off the course.

REVIEWS

Review by anonymous (posted on 24-Jul-2005)

A golfer (Matt Damon) loses his soul in the trauma of World War I, and descends into the confusion and pain of alcohol and cynicism in the Roaring Twenties. Lost and clueless, he is redeemed by the experience of playing an exhibition golf tournament in Savannah against the two best players of his day, at the beginning of the Depression. Resisting and hurt, he nevertheless returns to a place where he once was strong with the help of a mysterious and possibly phantasmagoric caddy (Will Smith) who connects him once again to his humanity through the metaphor of golf. Not just golf, but absolute golf, golf as a measured movement with the spirit of the field, of the world, of one's own authentic stroke. A beautiful, often quiet film; a successor to Redford's other movies, such as "A River Runs Through It," it tackles a treacly subject and handles it with an artistic sincerity that cuts much of the sentimentality. The movie has eerie resumblance to "The Natural," in which Redford starred, made decades earlier. Baseball seems to haunt the film. Every other shot seems to beg to be a swing of the bat, knocking the cover off the ball. Shots are filmed with a repetitive sense of somewhat dubious poetry. Always teetering on the edge of corny, the fine script and very beautiful performances, particularly by Smith and Damon, and Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen, keep it a poetic balancing act. Ultimately, it's Redford's sense of style which suffuses the film and its pace. His sincerity, and, most of all, the deep commitment to simple story-telling which mark all his work, make this a rather lovely yarn. The romantic interest has no life in it; but Damon's discovery of his authenticity and integrity stirs something tight in the viewer. Nevertheless, there is a kind of mawkishness in such a tale which is impossible to avoid. A beautiful effort though. Enjoyable and well-intentioned.
