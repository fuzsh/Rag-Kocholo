Producer Jake Eberts will receive the George Eastman Award at ShowEast 2000, which runs Oct. 11-14 in Orlando, Fla.

Eberts co-produced forthcoming Robert Redford pic “The Legend of Bagger Vance,” which is screening at ShowEast, and has exec produced such films as “Chicken Run,” “Dances with Wolves,” “A River Runs Through It,” “Texasville,” “Adventures of Baron Munchausen” and “The Name of the Rose,” among others.

“The quality of the films (Eberts) has been associated with over the past two decades is astounding and he has positioned himself as one of the preeminent producer-financiers in the business,” DreamWorks theatrical distribution head Jim Tharp said.

Company man

Before starting his current company, Blackbird Films, Ebert was head of the London- and Paris-based Allied Filmmakers, which he founded in 1985. Prior to that he ran Goldcrest Films, whose projects included the Oscar-winning “Gandhi,” “Chariots of Fire” and “The Killing Fields.”

Among previous George Eastman Award recipients are James L. Brooks, Nora Ephron, Norman Jewison, Barry Levinson, Sidney Lumet, Rob Reiner and Martin Scorsese.

The honor will be given at the gala final night banquet and award ceremony.
