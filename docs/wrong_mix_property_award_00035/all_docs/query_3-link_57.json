        "text": "Enrico Fermi (1901−1954, Fig. 1, see, eg, the Fermi biographies by Emilio Segrè [1] and Laura Fermi [2]) was appointed to a chair in physics at the University of Rome at the age of 26. He was a great promise in Italian physics and became a leader on the world stage. He stayed in Italy through 1938 when immediately following his receipt of the Nobel Prize he emigrated to the United States. By the time of the discovery of the slow neutrons he had already made his name with significant discoveries in theoretical physics and afterwards he made others as well, both in theory and experiment. In the list of his discoveries, that of the slow neutrons is only one of several seminal discoveries, but it earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938. It was an important discovery, one that soon found its utilization in the fast-emerging nuclear science and technology. It was also a remarkable discovery in that it happened in one day, including the crucial experiment, its correct interpretation, and the production of the manuscript describing it. It was a group achievement, which also reflected Fermi’s genius who was at home in experimental and theoretical physics alike, perhaps the last giant about whom this could have been said. What adds to the fascination of this discovery is an element of intuition that played a conspicuous role in the crucial step of the experiment.\n\nFrom the time of his appointment to the physics professorship at the University of Rome, Fermi built up a group of young and talented scientists, physicists mostly, but also chemists. It was part of the Institute of Physics headed by Orso Mario Corbino (1876−1937). Corbino was a noted physicist who supported Fermi’s vision of creating internationally recognized physics. His support was the more effective as Corbino was also a politician, though not a fascist, he was a member of one of Mussolini’s early governments and was influential in academic circles. Not only did Fermi attract young talent to his laboratory, but he also published reviews and popular papers on modern physics to lift the general level of science and science education in Italy. The Physics Institute was located on Via Panisperna and Fermi and his immediate associates were sometimes referred to as the “Boys of Via Panisperna” (Fig. 2).\n\nFermi and his colleagues were very much part of the international physics community and he and two of his associates, Franco Rasetti (vide infra) and Gian Carlo Wick (1909−1992), attended an important international gathering of physicists in London in 1934, organized by the Royal Society (Fig. 3). The list of participants read as a Who’s Who in Physics with several Nobel laureates and future Nobel laureates among them. Fermi was very much part of the international physics community; he visited leading laboratories and learned from leaders such as Max Born in Göttingen. He was a keen follower of the progress in physics, which at the time was happening in a relatively narrow circle of places. The discovery of slow neutrons at Via Panisperna was preceded by two recent discoveries showing how organically progress is building on previous achievements in science. One was the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in Cambridge in 1932. The other was the production of new radioactive isotopes of nitrogen and phosphorus by bombarding boron and aluminum, respectively, with alpha particles by Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot in Paris in 1934. Both discoveries were recognized as great achievements and acknowledged quickly by Nobel Prizes, Chadwick’s in physics and Curie and Joliot’s in chemistry, both in 1935.\n\nAs early as March 1934, Fermi raised the possibility of an experiment, similar to Curie and Joliot’s, in which neutrons would be used instead of alpha particles. Subsequently, the Via Panisperna group carried out systematic experiments using a strong neutron source for bombarding one element after the other, starting with hydrogen. Still in March they detected activity upon the bombardment of fluorine and published their findings in the Italian periodical Ricerca Scientifica of the National Research Council. The title of the communication was “Radioactivity produced by neutron bombardment. I” The “I” indicated that it was the first communication in a series and more would be expected. It was a foresight justified as 9 more followed this initial announcement. Fermi understood the importance of fast communicating their results. Ernest Rutherford congratulated him in a letter of April 23, 1934, on the “recent experiments in causing temporary radioactivity in a number of elements by means of neutrons” ([1], pp 74−75). In addition, Rutherford congratulated Fermi on his taking up experimental work and having such a successful start at it.\n\nFermi and his group continued their systematic work irradiating all elements one by one. They had to acquire all elements and they had financial support for doing so from the Italian National Research Council. This is how they reached element no. 92, uranium. The general expectation was that if there would be a successful experiment with uranium, some transuranic elements might be produced. Doing this experiment, they carefully checked whether elements between lead and uranium might have been produced; they were not. They did not check the possible presence of elements with much lower atomic numbers. In other words, they were not looking for the possibility of fission products. In contrast, it seemed as if an element of atomic number higher than uranium, ie, 93, might have been produced. The institute director, Orso Mario Corbino announced its discovery on a festive occasion, at a gathering of the Academia dei Lincei, attended by the king of Italy. Corbino appeared careful and he stressed the need of further tests, and he praised Fermi’s reserve in claiming it: “the investigation is so delicate that it justifies Fermi’s prudent reserve and a continuation of the experiments before the announcement of the discovery” ([1], p 76). Yet he did announce it without Fermi’s knowledge and agreement, and it was picked up immediately by the Italian press thirsty for sensation and the Fascist regime saw in it another proof of its superiority. The press communicated this as, eg, “Fascist victories in the field of culture,” and that the discovery “proves once more how in the Fascist atmosphere Italy has resumed her ancient role of teacher and vanguard in all fields” ([2], p 91]. The eventual embarrassment of this false discovery was compounded by the omission of a real discovery of nuclear fission. This became yet more painful eventually because already at the time Ida Noddak had warned of the possibility of nuclear fission (see, eg, [3], pp 136−138).\n\nThe relevant statement in Fermi’s Nobel lecture reads: “We concluded that the carriers were one or more elements of atomic number larger than 92; we, in Rome, use to call the elements 93 and 94 Ausenium and Hesperium respectively. It is known that O. Hahn and L. Meitner have investigated very carefully and extensively the decay products of irradiated uranium and were able to trace among them elements up to the atomic number 96” [4]. Just around the time of Fermi’s Nobel lecture in Stockholm in December 1938, Lise Meitner, already in exile, had suggested to Otto Hahn in Berlin to repeat some of Fermi’s experiments from which the conclusion of the formation of transuranic elements had been drawn. Before the end of December, a more extensive chemical analysis than before revealed the presence of barium and the seminal observation of nuclear fission was recorded (see more, eg, [5]). Accordingly, the printed version of Fermi’s Nobel lecture was augmented by a footnote: “The discovery by Hahn and Strassmann of barium among the disintegration products of bombarded uranium, as a consequence of a process in which uranium splits into two approximately equal parts, makes it necessary to reexamine all the problems of the transuranic elements, as many of them might be found to be products of a splitting of uranium.” [4]\n\nThe sad irony of the pseudo-discovery of transuranic elements in the Via Panisperna experiments was that it happened to Fermi, a scientist of exceptional care and reserve, and the Nobel Prize magnified the error. The prize motivation read: “for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons.” So, the first part of the motivation referred to the existence of new radioactive elements that included true discoveries and pseudo-discoveries whereas the second part referred to the seminal discovery of the slow neutrons. Ausenium and Hesperium both meant to enhance the glory of Italy. Ausenium was named after a Greek name of Italy, Ausonia, and Hesperium after Hesperia, a poetic name of Italy. Originally, the name Hesperia was used by the ancient Greeks to indicate the lands west of Greece. Eventually, following their true discovery, the corresponding elements 93 and 94 were named Neptunium and Plutonium, respectively.\n\nWe now return to the fall of 1934 when Fermi and his group continued the systematic study of irradiating the elements one by one with neutron bombardment. They were looking for significant effects and effects that were reproducible. This was not a simple matter as several experimental conditions might have influenced the outcome. Just to give an intriguing example: When silver was irradiated, and the instrument stood on a wooden table, the results were different from those when the stand was made of marble rather than wood. In hindsight, the explanation is easy, but at the time it was an uninterpretable puzzle. The researcher decided to enhance the scrutiny of all possible experimental conditions of their tests. One such experiment was to probe the effect of a lead wedge to be placed between the neutron source and the detector. The wedge shape would provide the possibility of varying the thickness of the lead filter. Here then comes a most intriguing moment of the discovery of the slow neutrons. In Fermi’s words: “I took great pains to have the piece of lead precisely machined. I was clearly dissatisfied with something; I tried every excuse to postpone putting the piece of lead in its place, I said to myself:’No, I do not want this piece of lead here; what I want is a piece of paraffin.’” ([1], p 80). The original lead wedge and a piece of paraffin, very much the same as the one Fermi used, are shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThis experiment happened in the morning of October 22, 1934, in which, again, a silver sample was being bombarded by neutrons. Apart from describing his sudden change of mind in the above quoted conversation, Fermi never explained what caused his change of mind about the filter. It appears to have been an intuition, and a most constructive one at that. The presence of the paraffin piece in between the neutron source and the target resulted in an enormous enhancement of the activity. This appeared to be a puzzling experience and for the moment with no explanation. Fermi and his colleagues left for their lunch break and siesta with apprehension. It was a few hours pause and when they returned in the afternoon, Fermi presented an interpretation of what they had observed, an interpretation that has stood the test of time: the paraffin was rich in hydrogens and the neutrons slowed down by repeated collisions with hydrogen nuclei, ie, protons. The neutrons of lower energy would have interactions of higher intensity with the target, by a factor of tens or even a few hundreds. When using water rather than paraffin, the effects were the same. Even prior puzzles found explanation by this interpretation, viz., why there was enhanced activity when the experiments were done on a wooden table versus using a marble stand. Subsequent experiments using water as a medium showed similar enhancement of activity strengthening the interpretation by the effect of hydrogenous media. In the evening of October 22, the researchers came together in the home of Edoardo and Ginestra Amaldi for composing a report of the discovery. Fermi dictated the note to Segrè, the others made comments, and Ginestra Amaldi took the manuscript to the editor of Ricerca Scientifica the next morning. She worked for the journal at the time. The submission date of the communication was October 22, 1934; indeed, the date was given as “22 October 1934−XII.” Where XII indicated that it was in the twelfth year of the Fascist era. The authors’ list read E. Fermi, E. Amaldi, B. Pontecorvo, F. Rasetti, and E. Segrè, and the title was, in English translation, “Influence of hydrogenous substances on the radioactivity produced by neutrons.” The discovery had tremendous value for basic science and perhaps even greater significance for practical applications. The same Corbino who hastened to exploit the political gains from Ausenium and Hesperium, hastened to suggest taking out a patent on the discovery of the slow neutrons. Corbino did indeed have a broader view of the implications of scientific discoveries. The patent covered a broad range of the work done in the Via Panisperna laboratory and had relevance to future production of nuclear power as well and nuclear weaponry.\n\nI am moved to make two additional comments in connection with this discovery. One refers to the mistaken notion of the pseudo-discovery of Ausenium and Hesperium. It has received much publicity reinforced by its contemporary political utilization and by the fact that it happened to a scientist well known for his care and reserved demeanor. Great scientists, however, are remembered not for their mistakes but for their true discoveries. Thus, eg, Linus Pauling, arguably the greatest chemist in the twentieth century, erred when he proposed a triple-helix structure for DNA and when he could not bring himself to recognize the validity of the discovery of what has become known as quasicrystals. My other comment concerns the counter-intuitive behavior of neutrons that showed hugely enhanced activity when slowed down as compared with their much faster, ie, higher-energy versions. Similarly, electrons accelerated by 50 to 100 kilovolts produce elastic scattering by molecules and are used for molecular structure determination. In contrast, electrons accelerated by a few tens of volts are capable of ionizing molecules as it is utilized in mass spectrometry. Intuitively, one might have expected the higher-energy electrons rather than the low-energy electrons to interact with the molecules, but this is not the case. Once the interpretation is in place though the observations no longer appear to be counter to common-sense expectation.\n\nFour of the five scientists shown in Fig. 2 were co-authors of the October 22 manuscript. The fifth, Pontecorvo, was the one who took the picture. Oscar d’Agostino (1901−1975) who is in the picture and who was not one of the co-authors, was also a member of Fermi’s team as a chemist. He had no immediate role in the discovery of the slow neutrons. He stayed in Italy and worked as a research chemist for the rest of his career. The five co-authors of the seminal manuscript composed in the evening of October 22, 1934, did not stay together for long. When Fermi left for receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm in December 1938, he and his family did not return to Italy; they continued in the United States. By then, Mussolini’s Italy had become a closest ally of Nazi Germany and had introduced anti-Jewish legislation that would heavily discriminate against Fermi’s Jewish wife and children. The anti-Jewish legislation had also forced Franco Rasetti (1901−2001), Emilio Segrè (1905−1989), and Bruno Pontecorvo (1913−1993) out of Italy. Rasetti first lived in Canada; then, in the United States. Eventually, he left nuclear physics and did substantial work in paleontology and other sciences having become a “generalist” in the best meaning of the word. Pontecorvo continued his career in France and in 1950, he defected to the Soviet Union, which was a great sensation as defections usually happened from the East to West and not the other way around (see, eg, [6]). Segrè continued in the United States, participated in the Manhattan Project and in 1959 he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the antiproton. Edoardo Amaldi (1908−1989) was the only one of the five who stayed in Italy. He continued his research in physics and after the war held leading positions in Italian scientific life. All five except Fermi lived a long life. A devastating illness cut Fermi’s life short, but he was one of the giants of twentieth-century physics, the last who was at home both in experimental and theoretical physics.\n\nAs for the discovery of slow neutrons, the events in Rome during a single day, October 22, 1934, constitute a bright chapter in science history, and, indeed, it all happened on a single day. Nonetheless, realistically, it should be considered as being embedded in the story of other discoveries preceding it and the prehistory and all the preparation that Enrico Fermi and his team had undertaken before that glorious day had come. This is how, two decades later, Eugene P. Wigner referred to the discovery in his Fermi obituary [7]: “The discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity, of the effectiveness and nature of slow neutrons, show all the marks of a great experimental physicist. It was Fermi’s first significant excursion into experimental physics and the choice of the subject and the timing of the excursion show deep intuition. The execution was speeded by his wonderful ability to make use of whatever equipment was handy in a laboratory not at all equipped for these investigations, and by the enthusiasm he inspired in his collaborators.” This was as eloquent as it was succinct an evaluation, worthy of both Wigner and Fermi."
