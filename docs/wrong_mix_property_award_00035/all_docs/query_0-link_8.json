Exquisite ANS from Enrico Fermi, penned in Italian on an off-white 9.25 x 4.75 sheet dated December 11, 1938 (one day after the Nobel Prize award ceremony), which reads, in full (translated): in full: \"Iâ€™m convinced that physical sciences should orientate themselves towards an intense collaboration with other sister sciences and equally with biology.
