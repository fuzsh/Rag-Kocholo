        "text": "This year‚Äôs Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to France‚Äôs Alain Aspect, an expert on quantum optics and atomic physics, American theoretical and experimental physicist John F. Clauser, and Austrian quan tum physicist Anton Zeilinger.\n\nOn Tuesday (Oct. 4), the prestigious award went to the three ‚Äúfor experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.‚Äù The three took forward John Stewart Bell‚Äôs work, which attempted to answer questions raised in a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Poldosky, and Nathan Rosen.\n\nT he Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Swedish geneticist Svante P√§√§bo yesterday. The chemistry, literature, and the peace prizes will follow every day for the rest of the week, with economics closing the year‚Äôs series on Oct 10. All the announcements will be livestreamed.\n\nEach winner will get a medal, a diploma, and 10 million Swedish krona ($901,608).\n\nBrief history of the Nobel Prize\n\nNov. 27, 1895: The will of Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist Alfred Nobel, most famously credited with inventing dynamite, sets aside the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes. His assets‚Äîincluding holdings in Russian oil company Baku Petroleum and a hundred or so ammunition and dynamite factories around the world, a yacht, a stud farm, three apartments scattered around in Europe, and more‚Äîamounted to 31 million Swedish krona\n\nJune 29, 1900: The Nobel Foundation is established to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes\n\nDec. 10, 1901: The first Nobel Prizes are awarded. There were five categories: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace\n\n1968: Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden‚Äôs central bank, makes a donation to the Nobel Foundation on its 300th anniversary to establish the Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nQuotable\n\n‚ÄúIt is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.‚Äù - Nobel‚Äôs will\n\nA snapshot of recent winners in Physics\n\nPerson of interest: John Bardeen\n\nAmerican physicist and engineer John Bardeen is the only laureate who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, once in 1956 as the co-inventor of the transistor, and again in 1972, for the explanation of superconductivity.\n\nThe Physics Prize, by the digits\n\n115: Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded since 1901\n\n219: People who‚Äôve been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics since 1901\n\n4: Women who‚Äôve won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Among them is Marie Curie‚Äîthe first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the only one to win it twice; once in the physics category with her husband Pierre Curie in 1903, and once as the sole winner for chemistry in 1911\n\n25: Age of the youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Lawrence Bragg, who was awarded the Nobel Prize together with his father in 1915 ‚Äúfor their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays‚Äù\n\n3: the number of father-son duos that won the Physics Nobel Prize‚Äîbut separately, unlike the Braggs.\n\n96: Age of the oldest Nobel Prize laureate in Physics to date: Arthur Ashkin, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018 ‚Äúfor the optical tweezers and their application to biological systems‚Äù\n\n85: The US has bagged the highest number of Physics Nobel Prizes. The UK and Germany tie a distant second at 24 each\n\nAmerica‚Äôs immigration edge in Physics\n\nIn the early days of the Nobel Prize, Germany was eclipsing everyone else in the science prizes. So how did the US come to dominate physics?\n\nDuring the 1930s, the rise of Nazi Germany prompted many scientists to flee from Europe. Between 1930 and 1941, twelve Nobel prize winning scientists came to the US because of the threat of Nazi Germany. Notable German physicists Wolfgang Pauli, Otto Stern, and Eugene Wigner would win their prizes after coming to the US.\n\nWhen Italy‚Äôs Enrico Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938, he used the opportunity to travel to Stockholm to receive the award to flee his country‚Äôs fascist regime with his family and moved to the US, where he worked on making the first atomic bomb alongside J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nThe bulk of immigrant scientists‚ÄîNobelists and otherwise‚Äîworked at prestigious US universities, teaching and mentoring future Nobel laureates.\n\nRelated stories\n\nü©∫ Svante P√§√§bo, the 2022 Nobel laureate in medicine, helped humans understand their origins\n\nüå± The 2021 physics Nobel upholds the grim truths of climate science"
