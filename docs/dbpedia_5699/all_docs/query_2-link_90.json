        "text": "The civil registration of births, marriages and deaths began in 1864. Non-Catholic marriages were registered from 1845. It is often stated that in the early years of civil registration 15% of births were not registered. There are numerous cases reported in newspapers where fathers were fined 5 shillings for failing to register their child’s birth within the prescribed three months. It is not known how many deaths went unreported in the early years of registration. However, with the required reporting of deaths there was also an increase in the number of inquests reported in local newspapers. Today, we are going to highlight three 1866 Glenmore inquests as reported in the Kilkenny Moderator. In addition to the family research value these short articles provide details of ordinary life, customs and the state of medical knowledge and treatment 155 years ago.\n\nIn early January 1866 an inquest was reported in the Kilkenny Moderator (Sat. 6 January 1866, p. 3) concerning the death of a man who fell into the fire. Although the article incorrectly identifies Rochestown as being in the Barony of Galmoy, there is little doubt that the death was of a local man. Death as a result of falling into the fire was a common cause of death of small children and the infirm. “Thomas Haberlan, 24 years old, and unmarried, son of the smith there resident. It appeared this young man was of weak intellect and subject to epileptic fits. On the morning of New Year’s day, his father and family went to prayers at Glanmore (sic) chapel, leaving him alone in the house; but on their return they found the unfortunate creature extensively burned and almost in a dying state. He lingered on to the evening, and then expired. It would seem that he had been taken with a fit in the absence of the family, and had fallen on the fire. The jury found a verdict of “accidental death, “and it was considered no blame attached to the family. There was usually a premonitory warning of the coming on of the fits, and in such case a person had always been left to mind the deceased; but on this occasion nothing unusual had been observed previous to leaving him in the house.”\n\nThere were two Thomas Haberlin’s born in Glenmore about 1841. Through later marriage records we believe that the deceased, [1] Thomas Haberlan was baptised on 7 January 1840 at Aylwardstown. He was the eldest child of Thomas Haberlan and his wife, Ellen Gorman. His parents were married at Slieverue on the 19th of January 1839. At the time his father was married his father was living at Carrickanurra, Slieverue. This Thomas Haberlan had six siblings and three of his brothers were given the same name: [2] Edmund Haberlan (bapt. 15 April 1841); [3] Patrick Haberlan (bapt. 6 July 1843); [4] Catherine (bapt. 24 Sept. 1844); [5] Patrick Haberlan (21 January 1847); [6] John Haberlan (bapt. 15 Oct. 1847); [7] Patrick Haberlan (bapt. 20 June 1855). It is not known when Thomas Haberlan, Sr. died but Edmund’s marriage provides details concerning his profession. Edmund Haberlan (bapt. 1841) married Ellen Kehoe, of Aylwardstown on the 18th of April 1873. Ellen was the daughter of Thomas Kehoe (farmer) and Edmund was a blacksmith and the son of Thomas Haberlan (blacksmith). It was reported that both fathers were deceased in 1873. For further information on another contemporary blacksmith Haberlan/Haberlin, Rochestown family see our post of 24 June 2021.\n\nThe second inquest involved the sudden death of a previously healthy man. In May 1866, T. Izod, Esq, County Coroner, conducted an inquest at Kilbride, Glanmore (sic), on the body of William Donovan, “a labourer in the employment of a farmer of the locality, Mr. William Fitzgerald, of Wetherstown (sic), who died suddenly on the previous Sunday evening. James Donovan gave evidence as to having met the deceased on the evening in question, after supper, and walked along with him for about half an hour, in company with two other persons. The deceased, who was about 37 years old, seemed in perfect health at the time, and went up the hills, and down, without showing the slightest distress of any kind; when suddenly be caught the witness’s hand, crying out. “Oh! James,” and immediately fell down on the road. His breathing became of a snorting character, and in three or four minutes he expired. Nothing whatever had occurred, apparently, to cause the man’s death. Had not seen him eat his supper, but he did not seem to have taken anything that disagreed with him. John Walsh deposed as to having been present when the deceased took his supper that evening, and he and the rest of the family partook of the same food, which did them no injury. Both before and after supper the man appeared in excellent health and spirits. He was an unmarried man. Some other witnesses were examined, without the eliciting of any other fact of importance to the case; and the jury ultimately found a verdict of ‘Death from natural causes’” (Kilkenny Moderator, Sat. 12 May 1866, p. 3.)\n\nIt is believed that the deceased William Donovan was baptized at Glenmore on 6 June 1824, the son of John Donovan and Mary Donovan née Norris of Ballyveria, Glenmore. His brother James Donovan was baptised on 8 March 1832. Other siblings included: Mary Donovan (bapt. 8 March 1818; John Donovan (bapt. 23 June 1819); Mary Donovan (bapt. 14 June 1826) and Honor Donovan (bapt. 9 Mar. 1834).\n\nLastly, late in 1866, Thomas Izod, the County Coroner, was back in Glenmore to conduct an inquest into the death of Patrick Murphy, a farm labourer residing in Parkstown, Glenmore. It was reported that the 24-year-old went to the fair of Waterford on the 1st of November. “When returning, he was riding a young horse, which was very free; and while trotting pretty smartly, the bridle broke, and he fell backwards and was thrown heavily upon the road. Assistance having been procured, he was taken up, when it was found his spine had received serious injury. He was carried home to Parkstown where he lingered on to Monday the 5th, when he expired. An inquest was held at Glanmore (sic), on Wednesday last, by Thomas Izod, Esq., County Coroner, when these fact were given in evidence; and in addition Doctor Hendrick, medical officer, of Kilmackevogue Dispensary, stated that he had been in attendance on the deceased, and that death had resulted from concussion on the spine, causing paralysis, from the effects of which he died. The jury found a verdict suitable to the facts” (Kilkenny Moderator, Wed. 14 Nov. 1866, p. 3). Unfortunately Patrick Murphy is a very common name and without any further details it was difficult to determine which of the multiple candidates might be the correct Patrick Murphy. Interestingly this inquest was the most reported of the three as it was also reported in all the Waterford City newspapers perhaps due to the fact he was returning from the Waterford fair.\n\nIf any readers can identify Patrick Murphy or provide further information or corrections concerning the three deceased men or their families please email glenmore.history@gmail.com.\n\nDr. Kathleen Moore Walsh"
