        "text": "A true friend shares freely, advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, and continues a friend unchangeably. – William Penn These words embody the very meaning of the extraordinary friendship I shared with Kevin O’Donovan over the past thirty years. Kevin held many roles in my life. He was my consultant for energy, conservation, maritime, and ocean exploration initiatives. He was my business partner on a couple of media contracts, and I was his consultant on his AFPM, CCA, and various other engagements. We sailed together, hunted together – and worked together. Our mutual affection for all things ocean – scuba diving, submarine exploration through OceanGate, the Marine Technology Society, HARTE Research, CCA, etc., was tied to a commitment to leaving the world a bit better for future generations. Underlying all of those activities was Kevin's steady, quiet, friendship that provided a supportive runway for me to develop and grow. Years ago, when I held my annual Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm weekend - and somehow we were \"oversold,\" Kevin with Porter Davis in tow, stepped in to provide extra ammo for the shoot, Cuban cigars for the cocktail party, and more quail when I ran out of “game” to serve at the dinner. I was never politically savvy - just the opposite; however, on more than one occasion, I had to speak on the Hill on maritime and technology issues. Terrified, Kevin was there scripting me, tempering my \"passion,\" to ensure the message resonated with key policy influencers. From Ducks Unlimited charity shoots to Decade galas, Kevin was the kind of friend that suited up – black tie, camo, or jeans, to support his friends' endeavors. He always put his money where his commitments stood – and never vacillated. When Grace was born – the world changed for Kevin. Grace was his sun, moon, and starshine. His excitement of being a Father trumped all the other things he loved. Grace was his entire world, and all of us would move to second fiddle – at least we were still in the orchestra. Once when Kevin and I were on the road in Houston for an Idle Iron conference, he told me that he hoped Grace would always know that she was brought into the world with love. (And she truly is SO very much loved by all of us.) Kevin would text me pictures regularly – I still have the pink cowboy boots shot on the rocking chair, the first fishing rod, etc. My favorite evenings over the past few years were baking my magic brownies with Kevin and Grace. (Hopefully, Grace, you will remember the good times, all the great things he taught you, and find strength in the challenges you’ve overcome.) However, the greatest gift Kevin gave me was his unwavering friendship. During a difficult time and over a glass of wine, he gave me these amazing words of encouragement: “ In life, it’s like we are all geese flying in formation. While most of us stick to the pattern, you, Colleen, are flying from one side of the “V” formation to the other. Sometimes you’re flying ahead of us, and sometimes you are way up high in the clouds too far to see. Even if, most of \"us\" geese shake our heads and wonder why – don’t pay attention. I believe in you, even when you are flying to close the ground for comfort. I know you are making your own path in the journey of life.” And then Kevin would add – “Just keep flapping because, in the end, you’ll see the world with a deeper perspective.” Then he would laugh, \"besides, it's so darn entertaining to watch.\" So with those words of encouragement, I say, \"Thank you, Kevin.” I am still in formation, flapping away. With each stroke, I carry your words and a piece of you. And with each stroke, I move forward in my adventure of life. I promise to share freely, advise justly, assist readily, adventure boldly, defend courageously - still working on the patience thing, but most of all, I will remain Kevin’s friend unchangingly… now and forever.\n\nA true friend shares freely, advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, and continues a friend unchangeably. – William Penn These words embody the very meaning of the extraordinary friendship I shared with Kevin O’Donovan over the past thirty years.

We both were members of the same fraternity. After graduation, Kevin and I spent many evenings talking about life and politics while consuming a few beers. Good times we had just hanging out! I visited him while he studied in London and also took a few nearby road trips together. I will share with you what I initially posted for friends shortly after I heard of your father's passing. We have lost, way too early, Kevin O'Donovan, a devoted father and a loyal friend. I cannot even begin to describe the wonderfulness of Kevin. His presence lit up a room because he focused on the time you spent with him as nobody else could. He always showed more excitement about those around him than himself, even though he accomplished great things. I will share my favorite Kevin story only because it shows so much about what it meant to be Kevin's friend and his passion to help others. On a cold November evening in 1992, Kevin and I were heading home after a very late dinner. On the radio, we heard that a 12-year-old boy, Donny Wentz, was lost in Shenandoah National Park. We listened intently and Kevin commented about how his ski patrol training might be useful. He pondered out loud, \"Should we go?\" We both smiled and agreed, \"Let's do it!\" We stopped at his place to get some supplies. Well after midnight, we started the two-hour drive to the park and then another long drive along the park's windy road to find the rescue efforts. We had no idea where we were going or what we planned to do to help. We arrived in the darkness before sunrise. After parking, we looked for the rescue headquarters and decided to confidently offer our assistance. We walked right in and hugged the wall at the back of the room, trying to look like we belonged there. The rescue leader started the planning session by saying that he expected people to just show up and try to help. While well-intentioned, the rescuers in that room should immediately send away anyone who just shows up because surely volunteers \"off the street\" will distract from the search effort. Everyone looked around the room and we think they even stared at us wondering if they should send us away, Kevin and I nervously held our best poker faces for what seemed like minutes. Would they send us away? Didn't happen. The planning effort continued with us included. Kevin and I searched with other rescuers for hours until the next shift change. We and the other rescuers could not find Donny. We returned home having done our best to help. Thankfully, on the next day, ironically, Donny walked out of the woods and found the rescuers. (The Wash Post has a great write-up on the amazing ending.) Adventure, humor, selfless service, friendship, inspiration - that was Kevin and a whole lot more. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nGrace, Kevin and I both attended George Washington University, though he started after I did and then studied overseas for a while.

May his memory be a blessing.\n\nDear Grace, I got to know your father when he was working at NYMEX and we were lobbying together on energy issues. Even though he was often the youngest people in the room he was also amongst the smartest. His ability to understand complex issues and how they fit into the \"big picture\" was impressive. Also impressive was his ability to connect with people. He was kind and thoughtful in how he dealt with others, whether he agreed with them or not. He was always honest, both personally and professionally, and would talk fairly about people with whom he disagreed, which made people respect and trust him. I went with your dad a few times on golf trips that he organized to Myrtle Beach and Kiawah. Each trip was a mix of people whom didn't really know the others in the group but we always knew that if they were friends of Kevin then they were probably good people. And your dad always helped us connect and have a great time. Probably his greatest gift was the ability to bring people together. Which is a great gift to have. The day you were born I saw your dad at Washington Golf and Country Club. He was there because Belle Haven's course was closed for renovation and was trying to get in a round before you came along and he had more important things to do. I was walking to the pro shop as Kevin was running up the stairs from dropping his golf cart off after his round was cut short by a phone call from your mom telling him she was in labor. Your dad was all smiles as he told me he had to get to the hospital so he could become a father. I was so excited then and equally excited in the years that followed when he would tell me about how you were growing, what you guys had done together and how much he loved you. Over the past few years your dad and I talked a bit over the phone and played golf a couple of times. It brought me joy to hear him talk about how much fun you guys had together and how proud he was to be your dad. One regret I will always have is that we didn't spend more time together because doing so always enriched my life. I miss him now and always will. With love, Jim McVaney\n\nDear Grace, I got to know your father when he was working at NYMEX and we were lobbying together on energy issues.

As you look back on it years from now, when you have a little more experience with such things, I hope you'll remember just how clearly your Dad was seen by his friends, how \"known\" he was. Kevin O'Donovan lived his life \"out loud\"....vigorously and vividly, energetically and passionately. Kevin's generosity spanned many sectors, conservation, sportsmen, veterans and those less blessed. He shared those causes with many of us, invited us to share his joy in service to others. And we grew to know him this way. So my dear Grace....here's my learning from your Dad's Celebration. As sad as it was, as great as our collective loss will long be.....as we told our stories and shared our memories, there were really no surprises. Usually such events are characterized by people saying \"wow, I wish I'd known that\" or \"I had no idea that...\". But that's not how people responded to the stories about your Dad. Our Kevin lived his life vibrantly, he sought and found meaning in my things. And then he SHARED those things, experiences, causes and events and in doing so he enriched all of us that knew him. His generosity knew no bounds. His life was well lived. He loved his family, especially you Grace, with his whole heart. Sometimes the Good do die young, but his spirit, good humor and legacy will long comfort us.\n\nKevin's Celebration of Life was a remarkable event.

We both started at DoE at the same time, and later both worked at the White House. We bonded over our love of sailing and fishing and growing up in the Great Lakes. Your Dad was such an easy person like and to get along with. Whenever we saw each other, we rarely talked about work or politics. Our conversations were easy, and mostly about the other more important non-work things - sailing and fishing of course, but also friends, family, traveling back \"home\" to spend a beautiful summer week or weekend on \"the Lake\" (which each had a different \"Lake\"), as well as volunteering and helping others. When we hadn't seen each other in a while, our conversations went along as if we had been together the day before. My two sons were little when Kevin and I met, and he used to ask me about them all the time - how did they like playing hockey and baseball, were they \"up at the Lake\", had we been fishing, how were the sailing lessons going,...So it was so so great when you came along and I could listen to your Dad tell me about you. He loved sharing stories and updating me on how you were doing. Your Dad adored you, he treasured you, and was in awe of you. Kevin knew he was blessed that you came into his life and that he was your father, and I so enjoyed hearing in his voice the love he had for you. I'll miss your Dad, and wish I could hang out and have another drink with him and catch up. I treasure our friendship, and I am so glad and lucky to have known him.

When we hadn't seen each other in a while, our conversations went along as if we had been together the day before. My two sons were little when Kevin and I met, and he used to ask me about them all the time - how did they like playing hockey and baseball, were they \"up at the Lake\", had we been fishing, how were the sailing lessons going,...So it was so so great when you came along and I could listen to your Dad tell me about you. He loved sharing stories and updating me on how you were doing. Your Dad adored you, he treasured you, and was in awe of you. Kevin knew he was blessed that you came into his life and that he was your father, and I so enjoyed hearing in his voice the love he had for you. I'll miss your Dad, and wish I could hang out and have another drink with him and catch up. I treasure our friendship, and I am so glad and lucky to have known him. With love, Matt Koch\n\nDear Grace - I met your dad when he started working in the George W. Bush Administration. He was a force of nature on the job and a great person to be around. He was smart, genuine, generous and compassionate. His career success was a testimony to his intelligence, problem solving and persuasive skills. The long list of colleagues turned friends (myself included) is a testimony to his character. While I have fond memories from hanging out with him over the years, I will always be particularly thankful for his friendship this past summer where he was a major source of support and good humor during an otherwise rough time. Your dad’s stamp on the world went beyond work and friendships. He made time to support causes he cared about and he inspired others to join in. A few months ago, I was with him when he asked the manager of a sporting goods store for help selecting, boxing and shipping sneakers and socks he wanted to purchase for orphans at the U.S./ Mexico border. By the end of the conversation, the store manager offered to match your dad’s purchase dollar for dollar and handle the delivery. Your dad didn’t just talk the talk - he practiced acts of kindness and made good things happen. He was passionate about the things he loved and he loved to share. He had a great story for every occasion - be it about fishing, a past travel adventure, or some historical reference. What was always clear in talking to him was that what he really cared most about and loved above all else was you. He cherished your time together - from the day to day activities like having weeknight dinners at home to your fishing trips. He loved sharing his passions with you and he was dedicated to giving you the perspective, experiences, love and support to set you up for a successful and happy future. While the time he had to show it was much too short, I hope you will forever feel and know the intensity of his love for you.

Amy Farrell\n\nDear Grace, You and I have never met, perhaps someday we will. And, it’s been many years since I last saw your dad. But, he is one of those individuals who has left a wonderful lasting impression on me. Your dad was a good man, and I am grateful to have known him. Kevin and I first met only in the late 90s, when I still lived in my native Washington, DC. At the same time, I met several other wonderful people, who were already friends with Kevin. We quickly hit it off. In a wonderful way, we all came from different political perspectives, and we all had tremendous respect for those beliefs in each other. Your dad was a strong common bond among us. And, within only a month or so we had already planned a summer trip to my vacation place in the Adirondacks, where I now live full-time. We all got along so genuinely that we nicknamed ourselves \"The Band,” and that was the first of several summer and winter trips to the Adirondacks. Kevin was one of the most affable people I have known. A genuinely good heart, always kind, always generous, and always willing to help. But, that did not mean that Kevin did not have his convictions. He was intelligent, thoughtful, and committed to his beliefs in an honest way. All good testaments to the kind of person your dad was. And, perhaps most importantly of all, he was very strong of good, admirable character. One time, as a favor to me, Kevin arranged and led one of those special private behind-the-scenes tours of the White House for some college friends of mine and their son. And for me, it was the first of only two times in the past 25 years that anyone … in this case, a uniformed Secret Service agent posted at the entrance to the Oval Office … has been able to correctly answer my all-time favorite trivia question. And, yes Grace, I’m going to leave you in suspense on that one! The only time I have ever gone hunting was with your dad. It was up here in the Adirondacks during one of The Band's New Year’s trips. Kevin suggested I bring up with me one of my dad‘s shotguns, he would bring his, and we would set out through the woods for grouse. We each bagged one, brought them back to the lighthouse where we were staying, and we all had as appetizers the two grouse. Though I had never hunted before, I was well familiar with firearms, and hunting safety practices. As was, of course, Kevin. So, I felt perfectly at ease, and had no hesitation about, hunting with him. But, fast forward a few years to when his boss, Vice President Cheney, (accidentally) shot a friend in the face while hunting. I told your dad that had I known who he was going to work for, I would’ve never gone hunting with him! I don’t remember if it was that same trip, or another New Year’s trip The Band made, but there was also the time that Republican Kevin jokingly railed against liberal Democratic Vermont right across the lake from us. As your dad was well into his missive standing outside the lighthouse, one of The Band members pointed out to Kevin that he was shaking his fist northward toward Canada. Without skipping a beat he turned 90 degrees to the east and launched right back into it! In 2000, some of we members of The Band also shared a Thanksgiving trip to London and Paris. And, it was a pleasure to be introduced to some of Kevin‘s old haunts from his London School of Economics days. We ate at Rules in London, visited pubs, enjoyed beers on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and shared Thanksgiving dinner there. The Band shared a fondness for good food as a catalyst for conviviality, and many a wonderful time was spent breaking bread with your dad. I do believe that your dad and I shared the philosophy that pork ought to be its own food group! Sadly, Grace, life‘s course has robbed you of the very many years that you should’ve had with your dad. The tears will always be there through a distance that can never be bridged. The pain will never completely go away. Yet, these will moderate as time gives you perspective. And, with each warm memory you have of your dad, with each beat of your heart when you think of him, you and your dad will always be bound together by a love and enduring closeness that no one and nothing can ever take away from you.

Gary Heurich\n\nDear Grace, Knowing your father and counting him as a friend for many years was such a privilege for me. I was so sorry to learn of his passing and have remembered him in my prayers, asking God to embrace him for the very kind and outstanding man he was. Just as a little background, I had the great fortune to meet your Dad when we both worked at the White House for President Bush. In that fast-paced environment, your Dad stood out for his intelligence, principles, humor and loyalty. He was able to cut quickly to the heart of complex issues and apply logical principles to the approaches we took. He was extremely courteous and thoughtful, seeking out my perspective on matters and always sharing what he saw as weaknesses and strengths concerning the options we discussed. I could always count on him to guide me toward a perspective that was more refined due to his insights; most importantly, we had a lot of mutual respect and trust in each other, something that I did not take for granted. He also has such a ready laugh, or joke to tell, and I always appreciated so much his positive outlook on life, even if we were feeling the pressures of those demanding jobs at that time. After President Bush’s first term, I left the Administration to take a new job, as many other colleagues did. At the time, I received some personal criticism from some media outlets, which was very challenging. Your dad made sure to keep in touch with me, to see how I was doing and let me know that he and others missed me on the job – and that meant a lot to me at the time, and it still does. He also asked me back to the White House, to have pictures taken there with my family and Vice President Cheney – which I am so glad to have to this day, as they remind me of his thoughtfulness and friendship. In the years after the Bush Administration, we both took new jobs in the private sector with energy companies, and we stayed in touch in phone conversations and would share meals when I came to DC for business meetings. As I had lived in Belle Haven for many years, he was very interested in my experience as he considered moving there too (which, as you know, he did!). After he moved, he inquired about Belle Haven CC’s amenities and atmosphere, and I was so honored when he asked me to support his joining. I saw your Dad about two years ago now (before COVID), and we had a great lunch together at an Italian restaurant downtown, and, as usual, he had me laughing with his observations and jokes. On a more serious note, however, he shared how much he loved you and how much fun he had with you and your activities, including school. He caught me up on Belle Haven and how things are there now, (as I had moved to Texas). While you know this very well, your Dad was seen by so many people as an outstanding man, who possessed so many God-given talents and interests, and who had so much character and integrity too. I am sure that many of his same qualities and gifts live on in you and will for your lifetime. As you were blessed in a major way to have him as your Dad, I too was blessed to have him as my friend.
