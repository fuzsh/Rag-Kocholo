The photographs associated with his work are extremely varied, including portraits, posed nudes, studies of figures in motion, and casual images of friends and family. These images exist as cyanotypes, platinum enlargements, and album contact prints measuring four by five inches. While many seem directly related to his paintings, others are only tangentially or ambiguously associated, and some are not connected at all. It is difficult to attribute photographs to Eakins in several cases because many of his students, friends, and family members also experimented with the camera. Recent scholarship has revealed much new information about the artist's use of photography and suggests that he projected photographic images directly onto the canvas as a step in producing a painting.\n\t\n\t<b>Medium</b>: Black and white photographic print\n\t\n\t<b>Dimensions</b>: 6 cm x 8 cm\n\t\n\t<b>Date</b>: 1891\n\t\n\t<b>Repository</b>: <a href=\"http://www.aaa.si.edu/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Archives of American Art</a>\n\t\n\t<b>Accession number</b>: AAA_miscphot_8247",
