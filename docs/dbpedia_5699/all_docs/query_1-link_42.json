        "text": "I write this week as usual, though it is so long since I have had a word from you that, in spite of all allowances for distance and the delay of the change, recovery from the fatigue etc. I am beginning to be rather alarmed: but I do not like to worry you by cabling at this juncture, so I shall wait another week and try to be patient. I do hope that Grand Manan is proving to be what you hoped of it, and that your house is comfortable and the people congenial. I should expect it to be very very solitary at this time of year.\n\nYesterdaySecond World WarNorth African campaign;d4 the church bells were rung, for the first time since the war,1 and I thought of Campden on Sunday morning. There has naturally been a great revival of cheerfulness (exceptingFaber, Annfiancé's death;a8 for some individuals: AnneWatt, Alankilled in North Africa;a1 [sc. Ann] Faber’s fiancé was killed early in these operations, just as she had had a letter from him expressing the hope of getting a period of leave within a reasonable future)2 but the general temper remains admirably sober everywhere – everyone is prepared for further stages of deadlock and difficulty – but if, we say, there are no unwanted reverses anywhere, two years may see us through. But the news have [sic] been a great help, and the war which seemed in danger of falling apart into two wars, one in the East and one in the West, has become one war again.\n\nI have for the third time in succession to spend three nights in town: I hope, after this, that I may be able to spend three nights and two nights alternately, as the difference between three and four consecutive days of writing in the country, is considerable. TheFabers, themove into 23 Russell Square;f3 Fabers, as I may have said, are in town the same nights as myself. TheFaber and Faber (F&F)fire-watching duties at;e6 fire-watching is not, under present conditions, very arduous: indeed, in my first experience of it – and it means no more than getting up at 2.30 and staying up until 4.30 – the watcher who was supposed to call me must have dropped off to sleep – I waked of myself at 3.30 – and gave the young lady whom I had to call an extra three quarters of an hour’s sleep as her share. But I must see that this does not happen again. The flat is beautifully warmed by central heating, so that there is no need to take a chill."
