(OâCurryâs manuscript collection is also held in UCD Library Special Collections).\n\nThis fieldwork involved writing an explanation of over 60,000 townland names as well as details of the history and antiquities of these townlands.\n\nIt was as part of this fieldwork that the famous OâDonovanâs name books and OâDonovanâs letters were produced. (Copies of OâDonovanâs letters and name books are held in UCD National Folklore Collection).\n\nOâDonovan was a prolific writer and appeared in various publications of the time.\n\nHis greatest achievement was the publication of a transcription and translation of the Annals of the Four Masters in seven volumes in 1848-51.\n\nCreator\n\nWilliam Reeves (1815-1892).\n\nBiographical History\n\nHe was a celebrated antiquarian and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore.\n\nPrior to this he had been the Armagh diocesan librarian for a time.\n\nReeves published several books including the Life of St. Columba and the History and Antiquities of Down, Connor and Dromore and the paper On the Townland Distribution of Ireland.\n\nSource of Acquisition\n\nInherited by UCD Library from an antecedent body of UCD.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThere are 80 letters either to or from John OâDonovan OâDonovanâs principal correspondent is William Reeves.\n\nOne letter is to George Petrie [1789-1866).\n\nThree letters are to James Henthorn Todd (1805-1869).\n\nOne letter is to Edmund Getty\n\nOne letter is to OâDonovan from Arthur Blennerhassett Rowan (1800-1861).\n\nOne letter is to OâDonovan from W. Oldham.\n\nThe correspondence with William Reeves often takes an interesting form. Reeves writes to OâDonovan with enquiries about Irish words and place-names and OâDonovan annotates the letter with his answers and sends it back.\n\nIn addition to these letters, there are 26 fragments, mostly of questions and answers; some of these may belong with letters, as there is sometimes reference in a letter to queries enclosed.\n\nAccess and Use\n\nThe material in this collection is available by appointment to students, teaching staff, and independent researchers.
