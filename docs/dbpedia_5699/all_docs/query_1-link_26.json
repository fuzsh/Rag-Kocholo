He did well in the USA and had a very large family. Many of us continue to try and find his birth place in Ireland, although, he didn’t speak of Ireland much and has left us guessing. The records for Daniel Lenahan b1850 appear to be non-existent.\n\nWe came across a birth in 1851 of an illegitimate child “Daniel” fathered by Daniel Curtin with a Mary Lenihan in Limerick. The child was baptized on Nov 4, 1851 in Monagea, Limerick. Subsequently, a Daniel Curtin migrated to the US in 1865. These two dates match information that we have on his birth year and arrival year in the US. It is possible that he was raised as Daniel Curtin and traveled alone to the US as Daniel Curtin and then adopted his mother’s name some time after arrival.\n\nWe know this sounds like a really long shot, but feel we need to verify it or eliminate it. I and a number of my family members have DNA on Ancestry, MyHeritage, etc… I’m looking for Curtin family members in Limerick around the 1850s whose decedents I can try and match our DNA against.

This is actually not new. My great-great grandfather Jeremiah Darby Glenn (about 1789-1876), born in Ennis, Ireland emigrated to the the US in May, 1831 and came to Curtin. For three more generations my family lived side-by-side with the Curtins. The person I'm interested in most is Jeremiah's wife, Margaret Curtin, about 17 years his junior. I wondered where her lineage fits in to the Curtins already in Pennsylvania when she arrived. She might have come at the same time as her future husband, but I'm uncertain. I found a baptismal record for Margaret Curtin at St Mary's, Cork City Sep 29, 1810. The parents of that child are Jeremiah Curtin (born roughly 1785) and Catherine Hasset (born roughly 1790). It is there that the trip runs cold. I've tried my best using Ancestry and Family Search, but I'm new to genealogy. Can you point me in the right direction? Your books must hold the answer. Thanks.

In the Tithe Applotment books for Kilfenora in 1827, a Patrick Conole had land about one and a half kilometres from Kilfenora at Ballybreen. The Nestor name is also very common around this area. In the Kilshanny ejection records of 1832/33, the names of Augustine, Honora, James, Michael and Patrick Nestor are shown as being ejected from land owned by Thomas Blood, the local large landholder. In the 1834 Tithe Applotment books, a John and a Thomas Nestor are named. Patrick and Honora Conole had at least four children that I have found, John (born c. 1817), Margaret (born c.1819), Honora (born c. 1824) and Denis (born c. 1830). According to her death certificate, from information given by her husband William, Margaret was 27 at the time of her marriage. The couple had at least seven children in Ireland before the family emigrated to Australia. I have only been able to find birth certificates for 4 of the children. The others are named on William’s death certificate. Young William, Daniel and Michael must have died young before the family left Ireland. I have not been able to find the evidence of John and Patrick’s births in Kilfenora, but this may be because the records did not begin until about 1842, or they may have been born in another parish. On the 11th of February, 1844, little Mary Curtin was baptised in Kilfenora. Her parents, William Curtin and Margaret Conole were supported by Mary’s sponsors, Denis and Honora Conole. Denis was possibly Margaret’s brother who later came out to Australia and Honora may have been either Margaret’s sister or mother. Margaret Conole’s younger sister, Honora left Ireland and arrived in Australia on the 27th of November 1851 on the ship “Hooghly”. She was a dairy maid, aged 24, sponsored by Mr John Kirby from the Benevolent Asylum for 3 months and to be paid 20 shillings. She married Cornelius Hortigan in 1853. Honora (Mrs Hortigan) died in1880, aged 56 years. (#488 Melbourne, catholic church). Then in 1852, the Curtin family followed Honora and arrived in Australia. William Curtin was described as an agricultural labourer who could both read and write, aged 36 years on his shipping document (therefore born c. 1816 but aged 38 according to his death certificate). He and his wife Margaret (nee Conole) aged 33 years (who could read only) on the shipping document (therefore b. c.1819?) and their children Patrick (aged 13), John (aged 12) and Mary Ann (aged 7 years), sailed from Plymouth 5/11/1851 on the “Joshua” as assisted immigrants, arriving in Hobson’s Bay on the 30/1/1852 (an 86 day trip). Denis Conole, Margaret’s brother, also arrived in the colony 2 years later as an unassisted immigrant. Denis became a policeman and is mentioned in quite a few police reports. When he died in 1885, aged 55 years #6802 Sandhurst, his death certificate showed his father as Patrick Conole and his mother was Honora Nester. (Therefore, he was born circa 1830, so younger than Margaret). After 21 months in the colony, Margaret died in Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) on the 24th of October 1853. Her husband William gave her age on death as 43 years. In July, 1855 William left to return to Ireland via Liverpool on the “Marco Polo” (aged 54 on the shipping documents) and took with him his 10 year old daughter Mary. William returned to Kilfenora and married in 1856 (aged 49 years according to his death cert – at odds with his shipping document again) Honora Garden (or Gardin), the daughter of Maurice Garden and Ann Power. Honora was born in 1836, so she was only 20 years old when she married. The witnesses were Michael Kellaurhy(?) and Mary Conole (a relative of his first wife?). Honora arrived in Australia in 1858 with her infant son, William as an assisted immigrant, a housekeeper and only 21 years of age. She is also in a group listed as ‘Widows’. Her step-daughter Mary was also on the “Caractacus”, and is listed as staying ‘with friends’. Is this the cheapest way for the two women to get back to Australia? Honora and William had at least 4 children, 2 girls, one who apparently died young, and 2 boys. I have as yet been unable to find when William returned to Australia. One possibility is that he became part of the ship’s crew. On Williams death certificate, his occupation was given as 'School Master\" Did he come as the ship's school master? So, Mary became the girl who travelled between Ireland and Australia 3 times by the age of 14, between 1852 and 1858. She had completed 3 long arduous voyages halfway around the world. Her experience was very unusual for those times. What stories she could have told!! Mary Ann Parkinson (nee Curtin) died quite young on the 10th March 1884 aged 40, and is buried in the Bendigo cemetery. Her youngest child was 5 years old. Only 8 months later, husband George travelled from Bendigo to Adelaide (a distance of over 600 km) to marry 29 year old Catherine Ann Curtin, the daughter of a Thady (Timothy) Curtin. I have been unable to find a relationship between this lady and William Curtin’s family. Do any of these names sound familiar to people in this group?

Can anyone help us find this information?\n\nUPDATE 2/14/2021: Found a baptismal record for this couple in Margaret's file \"Co Cork Curtin Marriage and Baptisms\" on this website, so we now have a place for them. Baptism was in Kilworth RC parish on Mar 4, 1847. If anyone has info about this Curtin family in Cork, please let me know.

He married Elizabeth Morgan and they had 7 children 2 boys David and Connie... and 5 daughters Marie, Winifred, Betty, and twins Anna and Catherine. I do not know his brothers and sisters names, I remember stories that he may have ran from the \"Irish mob\" to escape some trouble he may have gotten himself in. but for all I know that was just a story he or someone else made to embelish his background.\n\nI dont know if there is any beter records kept in ireland to access information, I'd love to learn more.\n\n​\n\nDeborah L Harrington sent the following message on 1/21/2021:\n\nWhat I know is that I`m the great granddaughter of Mary Curtin (believe she was born approx. 1844), who married Patrick Shine, February 23, 1868, in Newmarket.

My Grandmother was Lizzie (Elizabeth/ Eliza) Curtin (b. 1894, d. 1960) and she was from MILTOWN MALBEY. The family lived a few miles from the town, on a small plot of land. Her parents were Thady (Timothy) Curtin (b. 1850) and Mary Curtin (nee Gallagher, b. 1861). Mary was the local midwife. Lizzie emigrated at age 12 with a stepsister, to Australia (where a stepbrother lived) then to NZ, where she settled here. Most of her family emigrated to America in late 1800s, and a couple went to Australia. The names of lizzies siblings were Margaret (b.1883) patrick (b.1887) norah (b. 1890) Matilda (b.1892) and Kate (b.1900). Lizzie also had 6 other older step sisters and brothers (as her father had been married previously/wife died). They are Bridget (b1871), Pat (b.1872), Timothy (b.1874) mary (b.1876) Honor (b. 1878) and Martin (b.1879) Many also went to America.\n\nIt would be very helpful if anyone recognises any of these people, we have very little info from this side of the family line. Thank you!\n\n​\n\nCatherine Green sent the following message on 10/27/2020:\n\nHello clan Curtin historian. I have been working in records on Findmypast and Ancestry.com for Daniel CURTIN because a man of this name was witness to marriage of my William O'connor in NYC in 1867. My William O'Connor was from county Kerry and we have consistent DNA matches to Castleisland/Brosna area Kerry \"cousins.\" So it was of interest to me particularly, when I found a Daniel Curtin married Mary Bresnahan in 1856 in NYC and Daniel's birthplace recorded by priest as \"Brosnan Kerry\" with his bride Mary from Castleisland. Daniel Curtin with a wife Mary Bresnahan in Emigrant Savings account book signed \"his mark\" illiterate - birthplace \"\"Bresla\" Kerry. I feel confident this must mean Daniel Curtin was from Brosna parish of Kerry ...I just thought, perhaps all this data I am gathering will be of use for your files ? Daniel states also, he came in 1854 to NY on ship Columbia. Ancestry's index recorded him as Dr Curtin age 18 but on the page it is clear it is D with a small letter l to abbreviate \"Daniel.\" He was traveling solo.Daniel's occupation in NYC for many years was \"junkman\" however it must have been profitable. He made a will in 1868 designating various cash and properties to his wife and children and an allowance per month for his mother Mary to cover her expenses and eventual burial costs, so we know his mother's name Mary and that she was in NYC; he also left a bequest to his sister Margaret Read married to Jeremiah Read, of NYC. I of course have further of him back in Ireland than his stated year of birth 1831, since that parish's records do not exist that early, unless you happen to have anything so early from Brosna ? Daniel was in the mortality index of 1870 census. In regular 1870 NYC census there is a David Curtin in household with the widow Mary in 1870 after Daniel died; the house # was 334 E. 48th, the address of home Daniel left to his beloved widow Mary. Per city directory this David Curtin, age 35 in 1870, was in liquors at 1063 Second Ave and h 334 E. 48th. Directory that same year also listed Benjamin Curtin, laborer, h. 334 E. 48th. After all the detailed searches for Daniel Curtin I am really no closer to knowing if the Daniel Curtin witness on the marriage record of William O'connor is the same as this Daniel Curtin of Brosna ... I do hope you can file these details on a Curtin of Brosna for your records, and perhaps the information may be of some use to someone. I've not found any family trees for these people. At the time that Daniel made his will in 1868 he had a son James \"about ten\" a baby Francis \"9 months\" and a daughter Mary Anne. The 1870 household on 48th st in census is David Curtin, presumably a brother of the deceased; Mary, 30; James, 10, Mary 5 and Frank,2. Daniel also in his will left a sum up to $1,000 for the cost of his grave marker at Calvary cemetery so I now await my photo request with Findagrave for his marker; that may give any more detail on his birthplace or other information. all best, Catherine Green\n\nMichael Smith sent the following message on 10/23/2020\n\nMy name is Mike Smith.

I think that Patrick's parents are Dennis Curtin born 1793 or 1800 in Ireland married to Mary born 1794. They lived in Elmira New York and Patrick may have married for asecond time according to the 1865 census.

I am trying to find her birth date and mother's maiden name. She was born in 'approx' 1884 and married James Mackie in 1915 in London, England (she died in 1962 in Weybridge, England). I don't have her Father's name, although we think it might be Cornelius Curtin, a Cork Farmer.\n\nAny help would be gratefully received.\n\nThanks\n\nNick\n\nNicholas Houston\n\n​\n\nMaureen Haynes Wentling sent the following message: 10/19/2017\n\nThis is in response to Colleen A (Curtin) Termini of 1/29/2015\n\nI believe my grandmother Bridget (Della) Curtin was a sister of your grandfather Daniel. The family resided outside of Carrigaholt, Clare and there were several siblings. Your information about a sister Mary who resided in England for a time is correct. Daniel and his brother John emigrated to the US. Bridget also emigrated in 1912 to Chicago and then moved to Cleveland, Ohio where she spent the rest of her life.\n\nI had a chance to visit Clare in 2004 and was able to find some folks who remembered the Curtin family, although no one remained in the area. I believe you may have meant that your grandfather was born in the corner of a room in Kilrush, which is in the general area rather than Kildare. The neighbors who remembered the family told us that the original house burned down, but that a new house had been rebuilt and was still standing. Through the unsurpassed hospitality that can hardly be described of these wonderful West Clare residents, we were able to meet and enter the second home of the Curtins. It was tiny--so with the seven or so children in the family--I would not be surprised that giving birth was relegated to a corner! The gentleman who lived there at the time told us that the Curtins were involved in Irish nationalism--so that could be a possible reason your grandfather was jailed.\n\nWe were told of another Curtin who had passed through the area a few years earlier, and with a flurry of phone calls around the Loop Head, we were given the name of Patrick Keating, son of Mary Curtin Keating (your grandfather's sister), who resided in Virginia. Once home, I was able to connect with Patrick and we were able to meet. He was able to provide me with some more family lore. Sadly Patrick passed away the following year (2005). Patrick recalled his Uncle Michael (Mary, Bridget, and Daniel's brother) joined the British Army and was disowned by the family, but that Mary's husband insisted he be invited for dinner at the Keatings one time when he was in the area.\n\n​\n\nOndria Hart (nee Curtin) sent the following message on 9/20/2017\n\nGreetings. I'm hoping to find some more information about my paternal great grandfather and his ancestors. His name was Bryan Patrick Curtin born 27 March 1879 in Dublin. He married Nelly Daisy Gee. His brother was Cornelius Curtin. I've heard reference to a family home that was in Khyber Pass. Bryan and Nelly emigrated to South Africa in the early 1900s around the time of the Anglo Boer war. His father was Patrick Bryan Curtin and his mother was Helena Curtin nee Dixon. This is as far as I have been able to trace. Bryan and Nelly had Maurice, Desmond and another (who passed as a baby) all born in South Africa.\n\nAllegra Sleep sent the following message on 9/5/2017\n\nHello,\n\nI have been trying to find out more on our ancestor who emigrated to the United States. Charles McCurtain (1770-1796) who married Margaret Odgen in 1792 in England and they came over together. I believe that he is from Ireland. He died very young. (His widow remarried, Felix Rock, in 1799, in Ohio.)\n\nCharles and Margaret had two children before he died, Margaret W. (b. 1795) and John Alexander (b. 1796) in Kentucky.\n\nLooking for more information on Charles McCurtain, please email me at allegrasleep@hotmail.com if you have any clues.

She came to Massachusetts in the 1870s and married Michael Looney. On their marriage certificate it notes Denis Lane and Ellen Curtin as Bridget's parents. I've looked at documents on your site and wasn't able to find anything directly connecting me to folks listed. I've only found one document that lists Denis and Ellen as being from Brosna and that was a request for 1855 census data that was filed by a woman name Nora, during the early 1900s.

He had siblings Dennis, Stephen, Lawrence (just some of apparently 16 kids in total) Thomas Leo came to South Africa, we are trying to trace parents of Thomas Leo and up the line if you have\n\nJohn Curtain sent the following message: on April 28, 2017\n\nMy name is John Curtain, I live on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was born on 9 August 1937 although my birth certificate lists a different date.\n\nMy great grandfather was David Thomas Curtin, born Nov 1831 in Brosna, County Kerry, Ireland. He emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, and arrived on 18 Nov 1857 per the \"Princess of the Seas\". He had been in the Irish Constabulary for some years and joined the Victoria Police Force as Constable Number 256.\n\nHe married Mary Anne Ryan on 31 Oct 1861 and they had five children, one of them being my grandfather John Thomas Curtain.\n\nThough being born David Thomas Curtin and his Police Records of which I have a copy listing the same spelling, the surname subsequently changed to Curtain as did that of his brother Bartholomew.\n\nMy late aunt Marion did mention once of an incident that happened in Ballarat where he was stationed that caused the name change but being young I never followed it up.\n\nSo here we have a name and birth date difference which would not be unfamiliar to most readers. On with the story.\n\nA couple of years ago I was in Melbourne and visited the Old Coburg Cemetery where my grandparents John Thomas and Catherine Curtain are buried. I wanted to view the grave as quite often helpful information can be gleaned from these sites. Alas, the imposing granite headstone simply carried the name \"Curtain\". As I was about to leave I spied a hutch with what seemed like a map of the cemetery behind an outbuilding and being a \"Curtain\" I just had to have a look. It was certainly a map with historical sites marked together with names. I nearly fell over when I read John Thomas and Catherine Curtin, same christian names but different surname. Then I noticed that the grave was marked in a different section of the cemetery. I just had to have a look. Sure enough the grave was clearly identified and easy to find and contained the parents of Australia's wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin.\n\nHad not my great grandfather changed the spelling of his surname this would have been a super coincidence. All my life I have been asked if I were related to John Curtin and explained the different spelling which in reality should have been the same.\n\nAre we related? Probably, but I will never know.\n\nT. Yazmine Tingle on 4/25/2017 sent the following message:\n\nGreat Evening,\n\nI am Yazmine Tingle.

She is laid to rest in a family vault erected by John O'Dwyer of M.Malbay for his beloved wife Mary in Kildimo Cemetery Kilmurry Ibricken Annagh/Mullagh near M. Malbay, Clare.

His wife was Mary Ann Talty, most likely also from Clare b/c that surname is very common in Clare but nowhere else. Patrick emigrated in about 1857. From at least 1861 on (if not earlier) he was a resident of Washington DC. He was a tailor, a Civil War Veteran and active in Irish-American affairs. Some research suggests he MAY have been born in Lavarreen Townland, not far from Ennistymon, and that his parents MAY have been John Curtin and Margaret (maiden name not known with certainty). His and Mary Ann's surviving children were, in order, Mary, Margaret H., Elizabeth A.

Their daughter, one of 13 children, Ellen \"Nellie\" O'Connell was my grandmother and the mother of my grandfather Austin McMahon.\n\nMy mother, Isabel McMahon was Austin's daughter, Nellie's granddaughter and Julia Curtin's great-granddaughter.\n\nI am writing to you to see if you might possibly have some clues or be able to point me to resources that might.\n\nMy mother, Isabel McMahon, died last year. She NEVER would talk about her father Austin, because he left her, my grandmother and her sister when my mom was two in the late 1920,s. Four month before my mom died, she asked me to try to track down whatever happened to him.\n\nI have found his parents, and Julia Curtin, but it appears his siblings all died before they were 30 or younger and I can only find a record that has him dying in 1945 in the British Navy.\n\nAnyway, since Julia had 13 children, I am wondering if any of Austin's 12 aunts and uncles - or now the great, great nieces or nephews might hold some clues.\n\nThanks so much, Mary Beth\n\nJohn Curtin sent the following message on 1/22/2016\n\nI am from Lisdoonvarna, Clare, Ireland.

As I understand it from a cousin who is of the generation prior to mine, his father was Martin and he came from Lissycasey, County Clare. He came to the USA with his wife Catherine O'Connor Curtin and one son in the mid-1850s. The couple had 3 more sons and a daughter before she died in Houston Texas @ 1873.

Her parents were Thomas Curtin (about 1826-1871) and Margaret Howe (about 1828-1889). They were both born in Ireland, but we don’t know what county or town.

They had one daughter together, Eileen Fitzgerald. Mary Coughlin Barry Fitzgerald died in 1892.\n\nI'm curious to know if anyone in your group might know of any Barry or Coughlins from Knockaclarig or if any of John Fitzgerald's descendants are still alive and would know if any of my Barry/Coughlin relatives are still in the area.\n\nFor more information, here is my website with my great grandmother's information. If anyone you know might know more about these people such as where they're buried, if they had any siblings, or if anyone related to them is still alive, please let me know.

My father was Thomas Murphy from Ahane Cross,\n\nBrosna, Co Kerry. My paternal grandfather was known as John Murphy but he was born to Mary Murphy from Ashford, Co Limerick. Mary gave birth 1894 to John in the Gortboy Workhouse, Newcastlewest, Co Limerick and did not leave the workhouse until she married in 1904. John's baptismal certificate names the father as John Curtin.\n\nMary married a John Murphy from Scart, Knocknagashel, Co Kerry in 1904.
