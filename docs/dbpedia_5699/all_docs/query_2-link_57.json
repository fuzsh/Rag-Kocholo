        "text": "Post by Steve U on\n\nHello,\n\nI'm grandson to Maj. James J. O'Donovan, XO and Batt'n Commander of 2nd/3rd Bn, 31st Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Bataan.\n\nMy grandfather was injured on 3 occasions in the battles on Bataan and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in Abucay Hacienda. He survived the infamous Death March, only to perish from Beriberi 6 months later in Oct 1942. His remains were never conclusively identified, and are now among the \"Unknowns\" buried in Manila. I'm interested in learning as much about my grandfather's life and experiences as I can. Thanks for allowing me to share and learn on your forum.\n\nSteven Unwin\n\nVista,CA\n\nMaj. James J. O'Donovan - 31st Infantry Reg\n\n_______________________\n\nEXO has renamed this thread to more accurately reflect the topic.\n\nPost by chadhill on\n\nHello Steven,\n\nWelcome to the website. I am making some inquiries about your distinguished grandfather and will let you know what I learn. Perhaps someone here will be able to provide further information, too. I would also suggest you try contacting John Eakin at BataanMissing.com; unknowns are his forte.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChad Hill\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nMaj. James J. O'Donovan was recovered out of Cabanatuan Plot 6, Row O, Grave 649. Cause of death \"Beri B eri.\" Today the remains are buried in the American WWII Cemetery in Manila, Plot H, Row 10, Grave 140.\n\nPost by steveu on\n\nThank you all for the warm welcome and the quick informative replies.\n\nI was lucky enough to spend an hour and and half with John Eakin today and learned 10x more than I already knew, and UN-learned a few things too. Great information. Thank you Davidleigh and Chadhill for sharing what you know.\n\nI'll be sure to check out the facebook pages you mentioned.\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve U\n\nPost by steveu on\n\nThanks to James Erickson I now have a copy of my grandfather's death certificate. The image behind the text had me confused. I reversed the image and here's what I got. Obviously they were short on paper in Cabanatuan. Did they actually have evaporated milk though? Is there more to this?\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve U\n\nPost by chadhill on\n\nHello Steven,\n\nMany of the Cabanatuan death certificates came from can labels, and Alpine evaporated milk labels seemed to be especially common. I noticed this a year or so ago while reviewing many of the camp's records at the following website (which is a gold mine of information, see the Cabanatuan records on page 3):\n\ncollections.pvao.mil.ph/BataanDiary/Collections\n\nI'm guessing that some of the cans came from Red Cross boxes. However, other cans had Russian labels, which I cannot explain!\n\nCalvin Chunn's book \"Of Rice and Men\" (page 130) mentions in the August 19, 1942 entry that breakfast was served with \"condensed milk\".\n\nPost by steveu on\n\nThanks Chadhill. I did not know about that website. Tons of good info there. Could keep me busy for a while reading that one.\n\nPost by steveu on\n\nBTW, I emailed the american cemetery in Manila, asked them if they would please email me a picture of what we hope is the location of our late grandfather. They were very nice to do that."
