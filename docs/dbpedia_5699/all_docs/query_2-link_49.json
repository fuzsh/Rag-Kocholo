        "text": "SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - Mr. Charles William Donovan Jr., known to his friends and family as \"Bill\", died in Seattle, Washington, on the 19th of November, 2023 at the age of 82.\n\nBill was born on March 5th, 1941, in Lynn, Massachusetts. He was a graduate of Saugus High School in 1959, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1963 and gained an MBA from Boston University in 1970. Bill spent the early part of his career working in the chemicals industry and commercial banking, which first took him to Seattle. Over the next 50 years, Bill managed and owned several small businesses in the Seattle area. He was most recently President and CEO of a company that manufactures ground support equipment for the aeronautical industry.\n\nBill is remembered by his son and daughter in law, Charlie Donovan and Pascale Harter, residents of Belmont, Massachusetts, his daughter, Lizzy Donovan, a resident of Boise, Idaho, his sisters, Patricia Lavoie and her husband, Normand and Kathleen Donovan, four grandchildren, his sisters-in-law, Patricia Donovan and Maryann Donovan, nieces and nephews and a wonderful group of extended family and friends. He was preceded in death by his brothers, James Timothy Donovan and Michael Donovan.\n\nLong after retirement age, Bill remained active in the Seattle business community and was an entrepreneur and innovator in many fields. He was most passionate about helping other people realize their business dreams and used his creativity and fortitude to help many businesses thrive.\n\nBill was an enthusiastic rose gardener, traveler, and was insatiably curious about the natural world. He loved his family and work family above all else. He thought deeply about his past and was deliberate about helping create a better future.\n\nIn memory of Bill, please consider joining a credit union, offering fresh cut flowers to a neighbor, being generous with what you know and even more curious about what you don't know.\n\nARRANGEMENTS: Relatives and friends are invited to his funeral service which will be held graveside at Puritan Lawn Memorial Park, Lake St., Peabody, Friday, Dec. 8th at 11 A.M. Please meet at main gate by 10:45 A.M.\n\nA memorial reception will be held immediately following the committal service. In lieu of flowers, a donation can be made to Pike Place Market Foundation in Seattle, WA or My Brother's Table in Lynn, MA. Assisting the family with the arrangements is O'Donnell Cremations - Funerals - Celebrations, 167 Maple St., DANVERS, MA. To share a memory or offer a condolence, please visit"
