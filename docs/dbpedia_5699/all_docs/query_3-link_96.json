        "text": "Professional Profile\n\nWith nearly three decades of dedicated service in the legal field, I am proud to introduce myself as a Conveyancing Solicitor and Property Law Expert at HOMS Assist. Since joining the firm in 2006, my commitment has been unwavering in providing top-tier legal advice and assistance, specialising in all nuances of residential property transactions and probate matters.\n\nMy expertise encompasses a comprehensive range of property services aimed at making the purchase, mortgage, and sale of both residential and commercial properties as seamless as possible. This includes handling residential leasing and ground rent applications with diligence and speed, ensuring every client receives the highest standard of service.\n\nThe realm of probate is another area where I have honed my skills, meticulously preparing and executing wills, enduring powers of attorney, extracting grants of probate, and letters of administration. It’s a privilege to support clients through these processes, ensuring the distribution of estates to beneficiaries is handled with sensitivity and professionalism.\n\nThere is nothing more rewarding than assisting clients in purchasing their next home, making the process stress-free, efficient, and legally sound. The joy of informing clients that their sale has completed and that the keys to their new home are ready is unmatched. It’s about more than just transactions; it’s about facilitating meaningful life transitions for my clients, whether they’re buying, selling, or settling estate matters.\n\nIn addition to my professional pursuits, I am a passionate supporter of Tipperary GAA and Munster Rugby, enjoying the thrill and camaraderie of sports. My commitment to the community extends beyond the courtroom, as I am an active member of the Galbally Voluntary Housing Association and regularly share my knowledge on wills and estate planning through presentations to organisations like the ICA and various charitable institutions.\n\nMy academic foundation was laid at University College Cork, where I earned my BCL, further solidified by a Diploma in Property Tax from the Law Society of Ireland. Being admitted to the Law Society of Ireland was a significant milestone in my career, reinforcing my dedication to excellence in the legal profession.\n\nI am not only a Conveyancing Solicitor and Property Law Expert but also an advocate for my clients’ well-being, ensuring they are supported and informed every step of the way. My goal is to make pivotal moments in their lives as positive and fulfilling as possible, backed by expert legal guidance and a genuine understanding of their needs."
