        "text": "A remixed, remastered, 4K, 40th anniversary re-release of Jonathan Demme’s 1984 film “Stop Making Sense“ has excited Talking Heads fans — and members like Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, who across the Sturges Highway border in Fairfield.\n\nThere’s been a nationwide publicity tour, with everyone from Stephen Colbert to Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon paying tribute.\n\nNow it’s coming to Westport.\n\nOn February 9, the re-release comes toThe Westport Library.\n\nThe event is a benefit for both VersoFest and WPKN-FM, where Frantz hosts a monthly radio show (“The Talking Head”).\n\n‘PKN DJs will spin vinyl before and after the film, followed by a Q-and-A with Frantz and Weymouth.\n\nVersoFest 2024 — the 4-day music and media conference and festival featuring performances, panels and workshops — takes place April 4-7. Music producer Tony Visconti and pop rockers the Lemon Twigs have already been signed. More names will be announced soon.\n\nFrantz and Weymouth supported VersoFest since its inception. He has moderated discussions with music producer Steve Lillywhite and Psychedelic Furs front man Richard Butler, and discussed his memoir “Remain in Love.”\n\nFor 60 years, WPKN (89.5) has been a hallmark of listener-supported, freeform community radio. The New Yorker called it “the greatest radio station in the world.”\n\nVerso Studios — with its 18×10-foot LED screen and concert hall sound system, has screened Connecticut premieres of Todd Haynes’ Velvet Underground documentary, and other innovative screenings.\n\nDancing in the aisles is encouraged.\n\nClick here for tickets (starting at $20), and more information.

Thank you!)\n\nWhen organizers brought everyone from Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Joe Cocker to Joan Baez, Ravi Shankar and Sha Na Na to Woodstock, the world thought that was very cool.\n\nThe Westport Library’s 2nd annual VersoFest won’t feature skinny dipping, bad acid and mud.\n\nBut the 4-day event promises a lineup at least as broad as Woodstock’s, plus panels, workshops and other events about an across a wide array of media and platforms. It’s our town’s special festival — 2023-style.\n\nRunning from March 30 through April 2, VersoFest ncludes Sunflower Bean and the Smithereens; androgynous rock fashion, and hip hop’s 50th anniversary, and something for both Deadheads and gearheads.\n\nLast year’s inaugural event drew thousands to the Library’s Trefz Forum, and meeting rooms throughout the building. This year’s VersoFest — named for Verso Studios, the state-of-the-art media facility — builds on that creative start.\n\nSunflower Bean kicks it all off on Thursday, March 30. Hot off headlining at South by Southwest, they’ll follow Americana opening act Amilia K Spicer, and vinyl DJ Miriam Linna.\n\nOn Friday, the Smithereens — featuring Marshall Crenshaw — keep VersoFest’s energy sky-high.\n\nSaturday and Sunday are jammed with panel and workshop programming.

(Anthony Coscia’s scale model recreation will also play music throughout VersoFest.)\n\nNew York Times trend reporter Rachel Felder will host a panel on “Evolving Rock Fashion: From Marianne Faithfull to Debbie Harry to Lizzo.\n\nArtist Dylan Hundley moderates a photography panel that includes Westport native Michael Friedman, whose “lost negatives” from the 1960s form the basis of a stunning upcoming book.\n\nSaturday night showcases “Laser Stranger Things” and “Laser Floyd” shows. Both feature music of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” series, and the music of Pink Floyd.\n\nAlice Cooper fans get a two-er: an exhibition of costumes, props, instruments, unpublished photos and more on Saturday and Sunday, plus a screening of the documentary “Live from the Astroturf” (and a Q-and-A and book signing with bassist Dennis Dunaway, on Sunday. (His Blue Coupe group, with Joe and Albert Bouchard of Blue Öyster Cult, play a pre-VersoFest fundraiser March 10.)\n\nNorton Records co-founder Miriam Linna — whose roots in rock, garage, punk and R&B run deep — is the subject of a Music Oral History with Beehive Queen and “Saturday Night Live” singer Christine Ohlman (returning after her memorable 2022 VersoFest appearance).\n\nEarly Sunday evening half a century of hip hop is celebrated with a Legends Beats and Grooves block (scratch DJ demonstrations and discussions).\n\nAll day Sunday, vinyl dealers will sell and trade their records. All weekend long, workshops cover topics like “Writing for Independent Film,” “TV/Media Production,” “Podcast, Streaming and Radio,” and “The Business of Music.”\n\nConcerts and workshops are ticketed events; panels and keynotes are free.\n\nA cash bar will be available all 4 nights of the festival.

Both lost to the #1 seeds.\n\nThe field hockey team dropped a 3-0 decision to Darien, at Brien McMahon High School. The Blue Wave earned their 5th consecutive title.\n\nThe girls soccer squad lost 3-1 to St. Joseph.

I’m not sure how long ago it left, but it looks like a while.\n\n====================================================\n\nI’m guessing I wasn’t the only one who didn’t go there much.\n\nBlack holes: fact or fiction?\n\nDefy the gravitational pull of Netflix. On November 15 (8 p.m.), open your laptop to the Westport Astronomical Society’s free online science lecture series.

It’s a place for conversation and community. There’s a MakerSpace for discovery, a café for coffee, a stage with a beautiful piano.\n\nBut it’s unlikely that any library has done what Westport’s will do April 8-10. That’s the weekend for VersoFest: a unique, immersive music and media festival and conference.\n\nFor 3 days, the Library will rock even more than usual.\n\nConcerts, panels and workshops with Grammy winners, a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member, actors, movie studio executives, legendary journalists and famous songwriters — VersoFest promises something for everyone.\n\nLez Zeppelin — a Led Zeppelin tribute band — kicks off the festival Friday night.

Want more bike lanes? How can we balance growth with greenery? Interested in Westport’s goal of Net Zero by 2050, energy, transportation, waste, water and conservation issues?\n\nSustainable Westport and Earthplace are sponsoring a pair of “environmental debates,” prior to next month’s election.

It’s a chance to see the moon as you’ve never seen it before. All you have to do is look up.\n\n=======================================================\n\nChris Frantz knows music. The Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club artist — and Fairfield resident also knows the importance of introducing new musicians to new audiences.\n\nHe’s partnering with the Westport Library on a new series. The inaugural “Chris Frantz Presents Emerging Musicians” concert (December 4) features New York’s Lulu Lewis, and New Haven’s The Problem with Kids Today.

She’s new — but her family is very familiar.\n\nGinger’s mother, Nancy Gault — yes, of those Gaults — served as president from 1991 to ’93. Ginger’s aunt, Judy Sterling, held the position from 1983 to ’85.\n\nGinger’s grandmother, Georgiana Gault, was not president. But she was an active Garden Club member from the 1950s until her death in 1994.\n\nKelly Pollard — Ginger’s’ cousin, and Judy’s daughter — is the club’s current hospitality chair. And — who knows? — perhaps a future president herself.\n\n=======================================================\n\nWestporter and animal Reiki volunteer Cathy Malkin is featured in this month’s Connecticut Humane Society spotlight.\n\nShe describes herself as “an animal muse who is able to translate animals’ thoughts, feelings and viewpoints so they can be better understood.” For the full Q-and-A, click here.\n\n=======================================================\n\nDespite the recent deaths of 3 of the their most active, engaged members — and the COVID cancellation of the traditional Great Duck Race and Wine Tasting fundraisers — Westport’s Sunrise Rotary Club pushes forward with its mission to give talent, time and money to community and social causes.\n\nSunrise Rotary’s International Service Committee got approval last week for 2 new projects: sustainable agriculture to benefit Syrian refugees in Jordan, and battling malnutrition through improved food security in Guatemala.

Here’s today’s “Westport … Naturally” image, for example, from Weston Road near Lyons Plains.\n\nA week from now, this will be an entirely different scene.\n\n======================================================\n\nAnd finally … on this day in 1878, the Edison Electric Light Company began operation. By 1890 it merged with several other Edison companies, and became the Edison General Electric Company. Today we know it as GE.\n\n=====================================================\n\nThe healthcare open enrollment period has been extended through March 15.

The air is a little warmer. The joggers — and birds — are out.\n\nHere are 2 shots from Compo Beach. Enjoy!\n\n======================================================\n\nAnd finally … Lawrence Ferlingetti died Monday, in his beloved San Francisco. He was 101.\n\nOn a visit to San Francisco 20 or so years ago, I wandered into City Lights Bookstore. He’d always been my favorite poet. But for years, I’d assumed he was dead.\n\nYet there he was, standing by the counter, talking about books with someone who may or may not have known the old bearded guy was one of the most famous poets in the world.\n\nI just listened. It was one of the most memorable days of my life.\n\n================================================\n\nHighlights from last night’s Board of Education meeting:\n\nThe 2021-22 budget of $126,942,298 passed. Among other cuts, Staples High School will lose 2 teachers and 2 paraprofessionals. Not cut, however, are 4 Staples grade level assistants and 4 elementary school world language teachers. Also defeated: a proposal to implement “pay to play” for Staples sports. Next step for the budget: the Board of Finance.\n\nStaples is planning for 75% of students to return to full-time learning in March. Details will be announced soon.\n\nDr. Mary Lou DiBella has resigned as principal of Kings Highway Elementary School, effective at the end of the school year.\n\n======================================================\n\nFor years, Calico’s Post Road store near Stop & Shop has been a favorite destination for fabrics, window treatments, shades, wallpaper, furniture, bedding, pillows and cushions.\n\nIt’s still a great spot. But now it’s closer to downtown. The new Calico is in the old State Cleaners space, at the Post Road/Imperial Avenue corner.\n\nThere’s plenty of room, now that all the dry cleaning racks are gone.\n\nThe new store is a way for Calico — part of a 70-store national chain — to show off its decorating chops.\n\nCOVID has been tough on many businesses. But with families spending more time indoors, interior design stores have been busier than ever.\n\nClick here to learn more about Calico.\n\n=======================================================\n\nThis is a big year for Chris Frantz.\n\nThe almost-Westport resident (other side of Sturges Highway) — and drummer for Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club — will be honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. (He’s already in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.)\n\nPlus, he’ll curate a virtual concert at the Westport Library.\n\nThat may sound pretty local, compared to the Grammys. But the March 13 event (7 p.m.) is virtual, meaning anyone anywhere in the world can watch.\n\nIt will be quite a show. Frantz has assembled an all-star lineup:\n\nDeep Banana Blackout, the soul/funk band with full horn section\n\nMystic Bowie’s Talking Dreads, who mix roots reggae, ska and lover’s rock\n\nPlastic Ivy aka Lira Marie Landes, Philadelphia multi-instrumentalist\n\nXeno & Oaklander, an electronic group\n\nThe Zambonis, an indie-rock band that writes songs exclusive about ice hockey (!)\n\nSadie Dupuis, poet\n\nDu-Rites/Lulu Lewis, New York City husband-and-wife rock band.\n\nThe concert — which benefits Neighborhood Studios of Fairfield County, the art, music, theater and dance non-profit for underserved Bridgeport students — will be livestreamed form the Library’s state-of-the-art Verso Studios. It’s co-sponsored by the Westport Weston Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe March 13 date is significant. That’s almost one year to the day that Westport went into a sudden COVID lockdown (hence the name: “Lockdown Music Festival”).\n\nThe goal of the concert is to celebrate “optimism, resilience and the power of music.” Tickets are $25. Click here to register.\n\n======================================================\n\nOn Saturday, Sean Gallagher completed a solo marathon around Central Park’s outer loop — over 4 full laps.\n\nHis time was 3 hours and 47 minutes.\n\nNot real good for a former soccer and track star, Annapolis grad and Marine infantry officer.\n\nExcept … the 2011 Staples High School alum did it while carrying a 35-pound Marine Corps “ruck” (backpack).\n\n“Rucks teach Marines how to handle adversity with grit and determination — the same qualities necessary for small businesses to survive,” Gallagher says.\n\nGallagher mentions small businesses for a reason. The purpose of his marathon run was to raise money for small businesses impacted by COVID.\n\nWhen Sean Gallagher sets a goal, he accomplishes it. He said he was going to run 26.2 miles wearing a 35-pound ruck, and he did.\n\nAne he said he would raise $20,000. Yesterday’s total: $20,712.\n\n======================================================\n\nThere’s a Westport connection to everything.\n\nIncluding — or “especially”? — the Puppy Bowl.\n\nAs you probably heard, Sunday’s 17th annual event ended in dramatic fashion. Trailing by 3 points with less than a minute left, Team Ruff rallied to defeat Team Fluff, 73-69.\n\nThe local poop?\n\n(Former) resident Martha Stewart was host.\n\nMore excitingly, former Staples Players lighting designer Jeffrey Small served as production manager. He fills that role for many live events now, nationally.\n\nArf!\n\n================================================\n\nThere was another “bowl” on Sunday. Perhaps you heard of it: Super Bowl LV.\n\nStaples High School class of 1986 grad Ted Marcus — now an Emmy-winning New York-based sound designer and audio engineer — created the sound design and audio for 2 pre-game promos.\n\n“Polishing the Trophies and Plaques,” with the song “I Love Somebody” in the background, aired at 5 p.m.\n\nThe second was shown just before kickoff. It was narrated by Brad Pitt.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … the story about Chris Frantz (above) brought back memories of Talking Heads’ “Once in a Lifetime.” The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame named it one of the 500 songs that shaped rock."
