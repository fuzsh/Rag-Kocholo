        "text": "Counterparty risk a party that the Portfolio transacts with may fail to meet its obligations which could cause losses.\n\nCredit risk the failure of a counterparty or an issuer of a financial asset held within the Portfolio to meet its payment obligations will have a negative impact on the Portfolio.\n\nCustodian risk insolvency, breaches of duty of care or misconduct of a custodian or subcustodian responsible for the safekeeping of the Portfolio's assets can result in loss to the Portfolio.\n\nDerivatives risk derivative instruments are highly sensitive to changes in the value of the underlying asset that they are based on. Certain derivatives may result in losses greater than the amount originally invested.\n\nEmerging markets risk emerging markets are likely to bear higher risk due to lower liquidity and possible lack of adequate financial, legal, social, political and economic structures, protection and stability as well as uncertain tax positions.\n\nExchange rate risk changes in exchange rates may reduce or increase the returns an investor might expect to receive independent of the performance of such assets. If applicable, investment techniques used to attempt to reduce the risk of currency movements (hedging), may not be effective. Hedging also involves additional risks associated with derivatives.\n\nHigh yield risk high yield instruments, meaning investments which pay a high amount of income generally involve greater credit risk and sensitivity to economic developments, giving rise to greater price movement than lower yielding instruments.\n\nInterest rate risk when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reflecting the ability of investors to obtain a more attractive rate of interest on their money elsewhere. Bond prices are therefore subject to movements in interest rates which may move for a number of reasons, political as well as economic.\n\nLeverage risk the Portfolio may operate with a significant amount of leverage. Leverage occurs when the economic exposure created by the use of derivatives is greater than the amount invested. A leveraged Portfolio may result in large fluctuations in the value of the Portfolio and therefore entails a high degree of risk including the risk that losses may be substantial.\n\nLiquidity risk the Portfolio may not always find another party willing to purchase an asset that the Portfolio wants to sell which could impact the Portfolio's ability to meet redemption requests on demand.\n\nMarket risk the value of assets in the Portfolio is typically dictated by a number of factors, including the confidence levels of the market in which they are traded.\n\nOperational risk material losses to the Portfolio may arise as a result of human error, system and/or process failures, inadequate procedures or controls.\n\nComplete information on the risks of investing in the fund are set out in the fundâ€™s prospectus."
