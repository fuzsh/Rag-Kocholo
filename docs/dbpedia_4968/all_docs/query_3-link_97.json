        "text": "NEW HAVEN\n\nWYBC-FM, the radio station on the Yale University campus, has just celebrated its 25th anniversary with its reputation intact as an experimental, eclectic provider of music and news to the New Haven area.\n\nYale University provides the station with electricity and free quarters, stipulating that a percentage of its members be Yale students. But unlike regular college stations, it is a nonprofit corporation separate from Yale; its disk jockies come largely from the New Haven community. The Federal Communications Commission lists it as a ''college/commercial station'' and a training station for future broadcasters.\n\nUnlike fully commercial stations, WYBC's members elect the station directors. They all work for free, except for the receptionist. The selection of music - jazz, new wave, reggae and folk - has no place on the play list of most popular stations, which usually confine themselves to best-selling records.\n\nOn a typical Friday, WYBC may play the recordings of artists as diverse as the late jazz singer Billie Holiday, the late reggae star Bob Marley and the ''rapping'' sensation Grandmaster Flash, interspersed with a public affairs call-in program about New Haven's women's health clinic. Then, on Sunday, the programming ranges from classical music to a sports talk show and a popular folk music segment entitled, ''Heritage.''\n\n''YBC is not just a radio station,'' said the station's 25-year-old program director, Mitch Stanger, who works in a tuxedo store for a living. ''It's a cultural bread basket. There are so many different backgrounds here. So many people expressing themselves.''\n\nThe 50 to 75 people who belong to the station at any one time, like the volunteer staff of WPKN at the University of Bridgeport, comprise a broad cross-section of ages, ethnic groups and education levels.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
