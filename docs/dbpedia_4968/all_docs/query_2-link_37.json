        "text": "I wasn’t planning to post another drone-over-Westport video — until I saw this.\n\n(Click here if your browser does not take you directly to YouTube.)\n\nThe views of Sherwood Mill Pond, Old Mill Beach and Compo Cove are spectacular.\n\nIt’s one of Westport’s greatest — and, believe it or not, hidden to some — gems.\n\nBut even though of us who love the area can’t always sense its majestic scope.\n\nThanks to today’s technology, we now appreciate this timeless expanse of waterfront.\n\nAnd boy, is there a ton of water.\n\nOn Thursday, an alert “06880” reader was golfing at Longshore.\n\nI say alert because — while concentrating at the 2nd green — he noticed a house directly adjacent being torn down.\n\nThe reason he was so intrigued — and snapped a photo — is because he believes the house is less than 1000 days old. He says the recently demolished house replaced an older home, which itself was a teardown.\n\nTurns out he’s wrong. The house was built in 1965. Last year the owner removed all the trees from the back of the property toward the golf course — so some people thought it was a new house. In fact, it had been there 50 years.\n\nAt any rate, here’s a Google Maps view of the most recent house, before the wrecking ball:\n\nMeanwhile, not far away — in the Compo Beach neighborhood — a smaller, older home will soon be torn down too.\n\nBut despite the large “Demolition” sign on the outside wall, the owners seem to be enjoying themselves. Between the hammock, easy chair and twin lion statues with Uncle Sam hats, all’s right with the world.\n\nIt’s late June, and summer is already in full swing.\n\nA few newly minted Staples graduates are doing actual jobs: caddying and working at restaurants. Some are taking summer courses, to get ahead for college (or make sure their acceptances are not rescinded).\n\nMany recent grads are interning. In 2014, internships are the way to get jobs after graduating from college in 2018. (Although, even then, they might need a few internships before landing a full-time, paying gig.)\n\nBut these are not the first internships for the Class of ’14. For a month — from mid-May until right before commencement — 94% of all Staples seniors took part in what has become one of the most important, highly valued and intriguing parts of their entire education.\n\nThe Staples Senior Internship program is several years old. But this year it exploded, with 426 of the 463 class members taking part. (The ones who did not had their reasons, including academic or disciplinary ineligibility.)\n\nForget senioritis. Instead of sitting around for the last month of school, burned out and bored out of their skulls, the Future of Our Country headed to offices, other schools, even farms, to learn about the Real World before actually entering into it.\n\nThanks to the incredible work of program director Lee Saveliff, every intern has a site, a supervisor and a Staples staff mentor. Each intern must complete 95 verified hours of work — and each week, must write an in-depth “reflection” on the experience so far.\n\nThe reflections provide great insight into the world of work — and the minds of today’s teenagers.\n\nFour interns went to New York with MLB.com — the online arm of Major League Baseball. They worked on social media projects, and enjoyed devising ideas for GoPros at every different stadium. (For example: a “tour” of Fenway’s Green Monster.)\n\nBut they also had to make a presentation to top executives, including CEO Bob Bowman. One intern was amazed at the vast difference between standing up in a classroom, and a boardroom. (MLB execs were quite impressed, fortunately.)\n\nSeveral interns worked with the Himes for Congress campaign. (Hold your fire. Republicans had interns too. One traveled often to Hartford with State Representative Gail Lavielle.)\n\nThe Himes interns slogged through mundane tasks, like stuffing envelopes. But they also learned the ins and outs of campaigning. They met the Congressman — and Governor Malloy.\n\nAnd they had to do something most folks older than 25 or so take for granted: talking on the phone.\n\nThe interns followed up with constituents. They called likely and uncertain voters. For a generation raised on texting, that aspect of the job was “terrifying.”\n\nBut they did it. And their weekly reflections show their confidence in going outside comfort zones, gratitude for learning an important life skill, and pride in doing something tangible, with results that can be measured.\n\nThe internships spanned nearly every job imaginable. Some seniors worked in Westport schools (where teachers and — especially — young students adored them).\n\nOthers worked at Wakeman Town Farm. Tauck World Discovery. Voices of September 11. Marinas. Wealth management firms. Contractors. WPKN. Country Clubs. Restaurants. CLASP Homes. Harbor Watch. The police. Norwalk Hour. Auto body shops. Discovery Museum. Terex. Jewish Home for the Elderly. Verizon. The public defender. Longshore. Priceline. Law and medical offices. The Westport-Weston Health District. Westport Arts Center. Winged Monkey. Veterinarians. The Bridgeport Bluefish. Yale University. Mitchells.\n\nInterns were exposed to everything: The tedium of some jobs. Bosses who don’t always explain things clearly. Commuting. (A number of interns freaked when problems at the South Norwalk bridge threw Metro-North into chaos. They instantly gained new appreciation for what their parents go through every day.)\n\n“We know our kids are hard-working, polite, creative problem-solvers,” says Staples principal John Dodig — one of the internship’s driving forces. “It’s nice for the community to see that too.”\n\nIt certainly is. But that’s just a side benefit.\n\nThe main reason the program is such a success is seen by the nuanced reflections the interns write. The strength of their voices as they describe how much they’ve learned and grown in just one month. The confidence they display as they return to Staples, for one final week, to graduate.\n\nAnd the ease with which they go on to their next steps in life: College. Travel.\n\nThe next internship.\n\nWestport First Selectman Jim Marpe reacts to the death of Westport resident Bill Meyer:\n\nThe passing of Bill Meyer has left a hole in our community that will never be filled.\n\nHis enthusiasm for his town of Westport and for every Westport organization to which he belonged was unmatched and infectious.\n\nHe never tired of selling Westport and all the things that make it a special place. But he always said that selling a great product is easy. For us, Bill was the one who made Westport special.\n\nFrom Sunrise Rotary to First Night; from Saugatuck Congregational Church to Y’s Men; from mentoring young students to ushering at the Community Theater, and many other organizations as well — Bill left his high energy imprint on everything he was a part of.\n\nWhen Bill became a member of Sunrise Rotary he became one of its most dynamic members; bringing in far more new members than anyone. A true Rotarian – how wonderful to see him supporting his beloved Duck Race as he rode in this year’s Memorial Day Parade.\n\nBill was on the Board of First Night for many years. His energy and enthusiasm for the organization was a key factor in sustaining this great family event.\n\nAs the Senior Center Super Bowl Party organizer, Bill arranged for cheerleaders and members of the Staples High School football team to attend and provide spirit to the festivities. It didn’t matter which teams were playing in the Super Bowl – it was enjoying the day and the event that mattered.\n\nAs our most recent longest serving RTM member, Bill brought a new meaning to civic duty. He loved to campaign at the train stations and in front of the area supermarkets on behalf of the candidates he supported — and they came from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nBill Meyer is probably most famous as the creative force behind our town’s girls’ softball program. He paved the way for gender equality in our town’s sports programs long before it became the accepted norm.\n\nThe town’s softball diamond on North Compo is Bill Meyer Field. For the last 25 years he has been umpiring games and is well known to all of the girls and their families who have played softball over that period.\n\nIn contrast to his vocal and unabashed enthusiasm for organizations in town, Bill was quiet and unassuming in his outreach to those in need. Bill mentored several young boys in both Bridgeport and Westport. He was a board member of Isaiah House in Bridgeport, which is a half-way house for people leaving prison. Again, these are true examples of his dedication to those in need and his desire to serve his community with his talents and gifts.\n\nThe list of contributions Bill Meyer made to the town of Westport is long and inspiring. These contributions were not monetary in nature, but rather contributions of mind, spirit, enthusiasm, and self. He was selfless – always thinking of others and how he could provide an opportunity for others to become involved as he had. His love for Westport shone throughout. His legacy will surely endure but, for now, he has left us with aching hearts and fond memories of raucous enthusiasm enveloped by gentle dedication and kindness. He will be sorely missed.\n\nOur deepest sympathy goes out to his wife, Carolyn and to Bill’s children.\n\nBefore it focused its attention on Brooklyn — its real estate, its music scene, the type of glasses its hipsters wear — the New York Times actually reported metropolitan-area news in places like Westport.\n\nKathie Bennewitz — who was researching the construction of I-95, and the destruction it wrought on Saugatuck — unearthed a couple of interesting Times stories from nearly 60 years ago.\n\nOn June 20, 1956, the newspaper announced: “Advancing ‘Pike Drives Wild Animals to Town.”\n\n“Human dwellers in Fairfield County are not the only inhabitants to be dislocated by the construction of the Connecticut Turnpike,” readers read. “Denizens of the woods on and near the Thruway route are also being displaced.”\n\nA Westport Humane Society spokesman said he’d received “frequent” calls from residents wanting to know what to do about “the wild life that is invading their backyards and sometimes even their swimming pools.”\n\nRaccoons, possums and skunks were “regular visitors.” No word, though, on deer.\n\nLess than a year later — on February 15, 1957 — the Times reported that Westport had saved a 35-foot, 70-year-old holly tree from the chainsaw.\n\nTown officials rescued it from highway demolition. Uprooted and towed 2 miles behind a police escort car, it was transplanted “a short distance from the police station in the center of town.”\n\n“It was too beautiful to destroy,” said First Selectman W. Clarke Crossman.\n\nWildlife being forced from its natural habitat by construction. Saving trees from destruction.\n\nAs the saying goes: “The more things change, the more they remain the same.”"
