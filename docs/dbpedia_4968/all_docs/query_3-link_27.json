Successful completion leads to state certification, allowing EMTs to volunteer on Westport ambulances.\n\nTeenagers who are 14 or 15 are eligible for the organization’s EMR class, also this fall.\n\nThe training program for new EMTs has been revamped. New members will be placed in service faster, to begin on-duty training with a crew chief.\n\nNo prior experience or knowledge is necessary. To apply, or for more information, click here.\n\n==================================================\n\nThis weekend marks the 55th anniversary of Woodstock.\n\nAnd the best celebration anywhere is taking place on WPKN-FM 89.5.\n\nThe Bridgeport station is airing the complete original recording of the 1969 Woodstock festival. It runs all weekend long.\n\nThis is not the double album released as the “Woodstock” movie soundtrack.\n\nAnd it’s not some outtakes, added later.\n\nThis is the entire concert. Complete musical performances by every band — all 32 sets, from Richie Havens, Joan Baez, the Who, Sly & the Family Stone, Johnny Winter, Ten Years After, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Santana, Joe Cocker, Canned Heat, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Jimi Hendrix and more.\n\nEvery stage announcement. The entire affair (on air from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.).\n\nThe “06880” connection — besides the proximity to the studio — is that Jim Motavalli, WPKN’s publicity director — and a 1970 Staples High School graduate — was at Woodstock.\n\nAs were, presumably, dozens of other “06880” readers.\n\nAnd thousands of others, who wish they were.\n\n===============================================\n\nSpeaking of outdoor concerts: The Levitt Pavilion has a special offer for “06880” readers.\n\nSpecial “member pricing” tickets are available for tonight’s show, featuring Grammy nominated multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bird. The opening set is Malian duo Amadou & Marian.\n\nTickets start at $39.25 — 10% off face value. Click here for tickets; enter promo code 50THSeason.\n\nGet ready for another fun night at the Levitt. (Photo/JC Martin)\n\n================================================\n\nYesterday’s Friday Flashback featured a 1973 New York magazine cover depicting Compo Beach, by Westport artist Albert Hubbell.\n\nI noted that between 1925 and 1989, 16 local illustrators designed 761 covers. An amazing 44 of those show Westport scenes.\n\nSo of course at least one other was of Compo Beach.\n\nDorrie Barlow Thomas quickly responded: “My grandfather, Perry Barlow, was also a cartoonist and cover artist at The New Yorker. His cover of September 13, 1952, was clearly inspired by Compo Beach.”\n\nIndeed it was. That was the 2-story pavilion on the left, before it was damaged by a hurricane.\n\n“06880” welcomes other Westport-inspired New Yorker covers — beach scenes or otherwise. Email 06880blog@gmail.com.\n\n=================================================\n\nTomorrow’s Family Day (Sunday) at MoCA CT promises — well, fun for the whole family.\n\nThe noon to 2 p.m. schedule includes art, music, gallery exhibitions, handcrafted items for sale, and ice cream treats will be in abundance—no matter the weather.\n\nAmong the highlights: interactive African drumming, storytelling with Timbalooloo, and “create your own masterpiece” with a MoCA art instructor.\n\nThe “ColleCTomania” exhibit, featuring an assortment of poster art, is open too.\n\nIt’s free for MoCA members, $20 for non-members ($5 for children under 5). Click here for more information.\n\n================================================\n\nCatching up with Ben Casparius: The 2017 Staples High School graduate is ranked #23 of all Los Angeles Dodger prospects, by MLB.com.\n\nThe 6-2, 215-pound pitcher plays for their AAA affiliate, in Oklahoma City. He spent 2 yeas at the University of North Carolina, then transferred to the University of Connecticut, where he led the Big East in strieouts.\n\nHe had a 5.18 ERA in his first 3 pro seasons, before finding more success in AA and AAA this year.\n\nMLB says, “Los Angeles continues to develop Casparius as a starter, but he looks like more of a multi-inning reliever for the long run. He almost never uses a changeup, has battled walks throughout his pro career and lacks fastball command. His slider is a legitimate weapon that could be useful in high-leverage situations.”\n\nAt Staples, Casparius led the Wreckers to the 2017 state championship. He was Connecticut’s Gatorade Player of the Year, among other honors, and graduated as the state’s all-time hits leader.\n\nClick here for more details. (Hat tip: John McCarthy)\n\n==================================================\n\nSpeaking of sports: Rebecca Schachter — a rising junior at Staples — is the captain of the varsity girls squash team.\n\nIt’s well deserved: She is a very competitive squash player on the national stage, reaching a rank of #30 nationally.\n\nRebecca loves the sport, and wants other girls to love it too.\n\nShe has partnered with Intensity Squash to create Girls Power Squash: a program for elementary school girls\n\nStaples athletes will work with an Intensity pro squash member in weekly clinics to introduce elementary girls to the sport — and mentor them.\n\nSunday sessions run from 3:15 to 4 p.m., September 15 through November 24. The cost is $330.\n\nClick here to sign up. Questions? Email Rebecca: esinfo@westportsquash.org.\n\n==================================================\n\nSpeaking still of sports: Though the Staples field hockey team is coming off their 5th state championship in 8 years, freshman numbers are low. So far, only 9 players have registered.\n\nThe 9th grade squad is developmental; no experience is necessary, and there are no cuts. Tryouts begin August 22. septemberstevens@yahoo.com for more information.\n\n2023 state champion Staples field hockey team.\n\n==================================================\n\nLongtime Westport resident Nina Streitfeld died Thursday, at home.\n\nA celebration of her life will be held in the Westport Library’s Brooks Room tomorrow (Sunday, August 18, 1:30 p.m.), with a gathering an minyan to follow at 4 p.m. at her house. She was 92.\n\nThe New York native grew up with a love for the outdoors.\n\nShe edited the literary magazine, and graduated second in her class, at James Madison High School. She performed in plays at Swarthmore College, and thrived in the school’s intellectual rigor and down-to-earth culture.\n\nAfter earning a master’s degree in literature from Columbia University, she held communications and public relations jobs with ABC News, Visiting Nurses of Brooklyn, and the Traveler’s Aid Society. She covered the 1956 rescue of passengers from the Andrea Doria liner when it sank off the coast of Nantucket.\n\nIn 1957, Nina married Frank Streitfeld, an internist, and moved to Westport. With physician friends including Al and Jean Beasley, and Danny and Judy Doctor, the couple co-founded the medical center at the corner of King’s Highway North and Wilton Road.\n\nNina raised a daughter and son in Westport until she divorced and moved with her children to Neponsit, New York in 1968. She was vice president of Adams Oil Company in Brooklyn, PR director of Leisure Tech in New Jersey, and led press relations for New York Congressman James Scheuer.\n\nIn 1974, Nina appeared as an impostor on the TV game show To Tell the Truth, cramming for hours before the taping to learn about speedboat racing.She persuaded the celebrity panel that she was the world’s only woman offshore speedboat racer.\n\nAfter more than a decade in New York and New Jersey, Nina returned with her kids to Westport in 1978. She worked for William Pitt Realty and Kerr Kelly before founding her own PR firm, Nina Streitfeld Inc. The Public Relations Society of America recognized Nina with the Silver Anvil award and inducted her as a fellow.\n\nIn Westport, Nina volunteered with Friends of Music planning classical concerts, welcomed visitors on United Nations Day, and served on the board of Save Westport Now. She played a leading role in a community theater production of “Steel Magnolias.” She traveled frequently too.\n\nIn the 1990s she learned Japanese. For her work as president of the Japan Society of Fairfield County, the Japanese consul in New York honored Nina with a ceremony and reception.\n\nHer family says, “Nina was a strong feminist and role model. She was generous with family and friends and inspired many in her circle to care well for loved ones. Nina valued higher education, working hard and setting ambitious goals.”\n\nSurvivors include her sister Martha (Karl), of Berkeley, California; daughter Laura of Chapel Hill, North Carolina; son David (Deb) of Berkeley; grandchildren Thea and Kai; nephew Aaron, and numerous cousins.\n\nContributions in Nina’s memory may be made to Swarthmore College and the 92nd Street Y.\n\nNina Streitfeld\n\n==================================================\n\nYou never know what you’ll find in your garden watering container.\n\nChuck Greenlee spotted this tree frog.\n\nHe was only 2 1/2 inches — about the size of this “Westport … Naturally” photo.\n\nBut he sure covered a lot of territory.\n\n(Photo/Chuck Greenlee)\n\n==================================================\n\nAnd finally … Maurice Williams, the singer and songwriter whose 1960 single “Stay” was hit for his group the Zodiacs, then was covered by many others include the Four Seasons and Jackson Browne, died earlier this month in Charlotte. He was 86.\n\nClick here for a full obituary.\n\n(Stay! Just for a few seconds — long enough to click here, and make a tax-deductible contribution to “06880.” Thank you!)\n\nIn 1961, Federal Communications Commission chair Newton Minow called television a “vast wasteland.”\n\nSixty years later, the same could be said about radio.\n\nUp and down the FM dial, there are a few tired formats: pop, classic rock, rap. NPR spices things up a bit — though every affiliate sounds similar — while on AM talk radio, angry citizens and overworked sports fans ramble inarticulately.\n\nWhich is why WPKN is such a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe 10,000-watt station — broadcasting at 89.5 FM, and streaming online at WPKN.org — offers 1.5 million listeners in Connecticut and Long Island an eclectic mix of live and recorded music, news, public affairs, spoken word, arts and culture, and other free-form programming.\n\nIt’s listener-supported, commercial-free, community-driven radio. Just this week, the New Yorker magazine called it “the greatest radio station in the world..”\n\nThough based in Bridgeport, the station has flourished thanks to many Westporters.\n\nSome — like Richard Epstein — have been there almost since its founding in 1963. A bassoonist and choir member in Staples High School’s Class of 1968, he discovered the joys of alternative radio at Brown University’s WBRU. Starting with a 4-hour show Sunday nights, he played everything from “Blonde on Blonde” to Babatunde Olatunji.\n\nThen — because making a living as a musician or radio host was not the most secure career path — he followed his father’s footsteps.\n\nHe became a Westport dentist.\n\nBut Dr. Epstein was not through with music. Or radio.\n\nHe joined the Norwalk Symphony and a chamber group, and coordinated classical and jazz events for the Westport Arts Center.\n\nIn 1977, he started playing classical music on WPKN.\n\nFor the past 44 years, “Sometimes Classical” has been a Wednesday staple. True to its name — and his radio background — Epstein stretches normal boundaries. A show could include Frank Zappa’s variations on Igor Stravinsky, Bach played by a jazz trio, or an interview with Wynton Marsalis.\n\nSeveral years ago, when the station’s transmitter was failing, Epstein led a fundraising campaign. It raised $75,000 — the biggest fundraiser to date.\n\nNow WPKN is raising nearly 3 times as much. Once again, Epstein is in charge.\n\nFor nearly 60 years, the station has been located at the University of Bridgeport. It started as a college station (the call letters refer to the Purple Knights, the school’s mascot).\n\nIn the early 1990s, when an affiliate of the Unification Church (aka “Moonies”) took over the school, a group of WPKN aficionados bought the radio station license from UB. They established it as a non-profit, and paid rent for their studios.\n\nIn 2019 — after years of peaceful co-existence — the school said it wanted to renegotiate the lease. A committee began searching for new space.\n\nThey looked at dozens of places, all over the area. They did not have to remain in Bridgeport.\n\nBut they found a perfect site: right above the Bijou Theater, downtown.\n\n“It’s the cultural hub of the city,” Epstein explains. “There’s the theater, restaurants, arts spaces and co-working spots. The landlord (Phil Kuchma) was gung-ho about having us.”\n\nThey signed a 25-year lease. They look forward to being more visible, accessible and technically capable.\n\nThey’re adding a third studio, with opportunities for community members to participate in educational and cultural programs.\n\nIt will cost $400,000 to move. Epstein pledged some funds. Fairfield County’s Community Foundation has been a great help. An anonymous donor kicked in $40,000. Donations have come from all over; thanks to the internet, WPKN can be heard around the globe.\n\nThe campaign runs through the end of the year. It’s about 3/4 of the way to the goal.\n\n“When I was a kid, I’d go to the Record Hunter. Jay Flaxman would turn me on to new music,” Epstein says. “Sally White did the same,” first at Klein’s, then at her own Sally’s Place.\n\n“There are no more record stores. Radio today is so homogeneous. There are very few places where you can be exposed to Zydeco, African music, real jazz. The landscape is so narrow. PKN offers a fiercely independent, real alternative for music and news.”\n\nThe station also publicizes local events and community organizations, providing platforms that no longer exist on radio or in print media.\n\nEpstein is just one Westport WPKN supporter. The list is long. Staples graduate Jim Motavalli mixes up long, carefully arranged sets in multiple genres (including live performances), plus interviews with musicians, authors and others.\n\nFormer Paul Butterfield Blues Band member Mark Naftalin, writer Ina Chadwick, musician Robin Batteau and Martha Nachman are on the air. So is Chris Frantz of the Talking Heads, who lives a few yards away in Fairfield, and Eric Cocks of Weston.\n\nMike Zito, who taught radio production for years at Staples High School, is a PKN alum.\n\nEpstein’s own show has local roots. In 1977 he took over from fellow Westporters Kathy Geisler.\n\nHe’s been heard on WPKN ever since. Thanks to his hard work — and the generosity of loyal listeners — he and his very diverse group of volunteers will continue to keep 89.5 anything but a “vast wasteland.”\n\n(For more information on WPKN — and to donate — click here.)\n\nYesterday marked one month since the Westport Public Schools closed — and the full impact of the coronavirus hit home.\n\nThe original “2-week” period has been doubled. Though there has been no word from the governor, it looks increasingly likely that schools will remain shut through June.\n\nFour weeks ago, we could not imagine being out for 2 weeks. Now, we realize we can do this. And we can do a lot more, in all facets of our lives.\n\nHuman beings are remarkably adaptable creatures. But it takes an enormous amount of support and collaboration to adapt. Here’s a shout-out to all who have done whatever they can, to help us through that very tough first month.\n\nIt’s still too early to get a handle on the financial impact of COVID-19 crisis on Westport. When Board of Finance chair Brian Stern sat for an interview with Rob Simmelkjaer yesterday, he noted that it is too early to know about its effect on the mill rate, which will be set in mid-May. Click on the app for the full interview; download it here.\n\nYesterday marked Westport’s 2nd Wednesday of bell ringing. Churches, businesses, families — all got together at 5 p.m., to show support for medical personnel and frontline workers.\n\nOne of the special ringers was Rebecca Schachter. Her bell came from her dad Seth’s World War II collection. It was used by British wardens during air raids.\n\nEight decades later, we’re in a different war. But the bell is as important as ever.\n\nLike many Westport families last night, the Aders and Yormarks celebrated Passover — commemorating the Israelites’ escape from slavery when God inflicted 10 plagues upon the Egyptians — in the midst of a plague. Here’s their “virtual” Seder:\n\nAlso yesterday, Governor Lamont ordered all flags lowered to half staff statewide, mourning those affected by COVID-19. Flags will remain lowered throughout the emergency.\n\nReader Brendan Byrne spotted a firefighter at the Saugatuck station responding immediately:\n\nPosted without comment (though there undoubtedly will be some from readers):\n\n“SISTD” is the Saugatuck Island Special Taxing District. It was established in 1984 to tax island property owners on the land just beyond Harbor Road for local costs — mainly road maintenance. (Hat tip: NextDoor)\n\nSt. Luke Church will livestream all Holy Week masses and services. That’s Holy Thursday (tonight, 7:30 p.m.); Good Friday (8 a.m., 3 p.m.), Holy Saturday (8 a.m., 8 p.m.) and Easter Sunday (7:30 a.m.).\n\nAfter livestreaming, they’ll be available on YouTube. Click here for details.\n\nAspetuck Land Trust’s 44 preserves are still open. They’re great places to walk, de-stress, and leave the coronavirus world behind.\n\nBut — unless people start obeying the well-marked rules — they won’t be open much longer.\n\nThere is a clear “no dogs” policy. The reasons make sense: the COVID-19 virus may be spread on dog fur just like on other surfaces. Plus, the heavy volume of dogs harms wildlife.\n\nYet people still bring dogs. And recently, people who did not want to follow the rules went further, and ripped up signs.\n\nBeaches and athletic fields have been closed. Aspetuck’s preserves are still open. But some entitled morons may soon put an end to that.\n\nJust in case you haven’t gotten the memo that Westport sports facilities are closed: There are new electronic signs at Staples High School.
