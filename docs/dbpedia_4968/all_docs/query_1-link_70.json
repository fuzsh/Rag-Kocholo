        "text": "Written by Miasha Lee\n\nAfter ten years of giving listeners commentary, poetry and music on Monday mornings\n\nfrom 6-9 a.m., Valley Free Radio programmer/host Bob Balogh of the Morning Roll has retired\n\nand broadcast his final show on Nov. 14. “I’ve reached my age and threshold of energy, so it’s\n\ntime to retire,” stated Balogh. “It’s been a richly rewarding experience in the last ten years at\n\nVFR. I’m hoping that by opening a space on Monday morning it will give someone else an\n\nopportunity to start something artistically for them.”\n\nBalogh has been on a radio station every year since 1981. He was in the Marine Corps in\n\nthe late 60’s as a radio man in the Vietnam War calling airstrikes, resupplies and medevacs. He\n\nattended Western Connecticut State University in the early 1980s, where he majored in theater\n\nand joined the college’s radio station WXCI. From there went on to a bigger community station\n\nin Bridgeport, CT known as WPKN for 30 years. Then transitioned to a station in Great\n\nBarrington, MA called WBCR from 2004-2012. One of the programmers at WBCR informed\n\nBalogh about a station they were doing some stuff in Northampton called WXOJ. He started\n\nlistening to the station and was attracted to what they were doing artistically so in 2012, he made\n\nthe move to Valley Free Radio WXOJ-LP 103.3 FM Northampton.\n\n“I’ve always been influenced by free form radio,” Balogh explained. I was really\n\nattracted to the whole greater Northampton community, what was going on musically and it was\n\nvery fulfilling.”\n\nThroughout his ten years at VFR, Balogh said he’s learned things along the way and has\n\nevolved based on what he’s been influenced by over his entire lifetime. He credits WXOJ and the\n\ngreater Northampton area for being exposed to so much new music and new artists that he\n\notherwise would have never paid attention to. That gave him energy and the thrill of being on the\n\nair alive.\n\n“Bob brought a level of professionalism and gravitas to VFR,” said Board of Directors\n\nmember Mark Bove who’s been at the station since 2014. “He has an authority in his delivery on\n\nair announcing the weather, time and news and does things you don’t expect of a morning show\n\nwith his wry commentary and humorous twists on obscure news events, the reading of his poems\n\nand writings from his chapter books and occasionally, bad puns.”\n\nBove continued, “Bob has done a really good job of talking to his audience as if he was\n\ntalking to an individual listener. He strived to make a connection between the person in the booth\n\nhere at the station and the person listening. That will be a legacy for others to strive to do\n\nthroughout their shows.”\n\nLila Wolan-Jedziniak, one of the founding VFR members/programmers has been good\n\nfriends with Balogh for many years. She considers him as a surrogate father who’s always looked\n\nafter her best interest. “One thing I’ve learned after this year is that I realize the meaning of\n\nfriendship,” Jedziniak replied. “He’s a positive person with his own sense of humor. I admire his\n\nwork ethic and drive. Bob manages to pull through no matter what he’s going through, and I want\n\nto be just like that 20 years from now in my life.” She went on to say, “Thank you Bob for the music. Thank you for keeping us informed of what’s going on in the community and thank you\n\nfor bringing some levity to the morning.”\n\nVFR member/board treasurer Stefan Ward-Wheten said, “Bob has been a benefactor of\n\nValley Free Radio. His willingness and ability to contribute in various different ways that makes\n\nhim a model programmer and a model community member of a station like ours.”\n\nWheten was just starting out and had been a few months on the air when Balogh came to\n\nthe station. During that time, Wheten recalled VFR didn’t have as full of a roster as they do now.\n\nThe community of programmers was still pretty small and there were still large gaps in the\n\nschedule that they were filling with Pacifica content or rebroadcast content. VFR didn’t have a\n\nmorning broadcast and the morning is traditionally an important time slot in radio because that’s\n\nwhen a lot of people are in their cars driving and listening to the radio. For Balogh to get a big\n\ntime slot of three hours in the morning was a lot even on a community radio station, but\n\nnonetheless he proved capable of keeping the momentum.\n\n“Before Bob, we really didn’t have anything like that in its place,” Wheten responded. “After his show became a fixture on our calendar, we started trying to actively cultivate a regular\n\nmorning lineup which has been pretty successful. Bob started the week off on Monday mornings\n\nand has connected us to a wider new audience.”\n\nWheten wants Balogh’s legacy at VFR to be his sensibility for bringing together various\n\naspects of his life, work, and interest into radio. His creativity in making all of these things fit\n\ntogether. As well as being open and generous with his time, insight and experience with other\n\nprogrammers, younger programmers especially. “That’s precisely what a station like Valley Free Radio is all about,” Wheten added. “It’s the kind of ethos that we really try to cultivate here, and, in some ways, I think it’s the reason we\n\nall do this, but Bob just happens to exemplify it really well.”\n\nRight now, Balogh is happy, content and has a plan. After leaving WXOJ, he’s\n\nvolunteering once a week at a station walking distance from where he lives in Pittsfield called\n\nWRRS devoted to the blind and handicapped reading the newspaper for two hours live on the air.\n\nHe also has his own performance studio in Pittsfield where he has poetry readings and theatrical\n\nperformances on CTSB-TV (Community Television for the Southern Berkshires) in Lee, MA.\n\nBalogh wants to be known as someone who appreciates his fellow broadcasters and learns from\n\neach and every person that’s there.\n\n“Preparation is the key to having a good radio show,” Balogh responded. “I just hope that\n\nI presented myself as a good enough person to win somebody’s respect. I’m just glad that I was\n\nable to be in a mellow frame of mind at this stage in my life where I could meet people at VFR\n\nand be a good listener and a good friend.”\n\nOn behalf of all the members here at Valley Free Radio, we thank Bob Balogh for his\n\nservice.\n\nMore Posts for Show: The Morning Roll"
