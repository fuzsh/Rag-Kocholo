        "text": "ONE afternoon last summer, the host on radio station WPKN-FM in Bridgeport began what was nominally a jazz show. First he played a series of singles by James Brown, the soul singer. Then he read a selection of newspaper editorials about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Only then was it on to Duke Ellington.\n\nThe show was vintage WPKN, typical of the eclecticism, range and freedom on the station of the University of Bridgeport. At WPKN, a station without either advertisers or a network affiliation, radio remains a passionately individual affair.\n\nRay Terlaga, a station disc jockey who is an astronomer by hobby, often interrupts his Friday night music show to discuss the constellations in the evening sky. Another disc jockey, Lisa Sahulka, once juxtaposed a rock song entitled ''Fat-Bottomed Girls'' with a folk-song rejoinder, ''We Don't Need Men,'' and launched into a discussion of sensitivity in lyrics.\n\n''You try to be genuine,'' said Rod Ross, who has been on WPKN for seven years. ''And that means sometimes sweet, sometimes melancholy.'' In a good mood, Mr. Ross has invited callers to discuss the best way to stop a dogfight. In more pensive moments, he has spoken of Sid Grinder, a friend from WPKN who died at age 21, and played some of Mr. Grinder's favorite songs.\n\nThis week is a time for Mr. Ross, Mr. Terlaga, Miss Sahulka and the rest of WPKN's staff to take stock and look back. The station turns 20 years old.\n\nWPKN began with 10 watts as the province of the university's Radio Hobby Club; it was heard only on the university campus. Today, at 10,000 watts and with a staff of 60 student and community volunteers, WPKN-FM, 89.5, reaches 30,000 to 50,000 listeners from Norwalk to New London and from the north shore of Long Island to Torrington and Hartford. (WPKN-AM is a closed-circuit station available only on campus.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
