Just awesome.\n\nLast few hours I've heard Gary Moore, joe bonamassa, srv, Albert Cummings, moe, Ben Harper, Jeff beck, trower, abb, mule, win wood, raitt, Gregg, Susan, dtb, rush, doors, Steve miller, plus several artists I was not familiar with....just great radio....check it out. This blows away plalists I've heard on any satellite radio station, or Pandora.\n\nhttp://www.gulchradio.com/\n\nAnybody care to recommend one near you or online you like?\n\nEdit - remembered more they also played Stones, Skynyrd, Peter green...whoever picks the songs digs up some deep ones and the flow is good.\n\n[Edited on 9/14/2017 by nebish]\n\nUsed to listen to WPKN. I thought Bill Nolan on Sunday night was one of the best DJs in the US... he still might be! Used to be able to get WBGO 88.3 (Newark jazz station) but some local God station took 88.3, and now nomore BGO. Although most stations can be streamed from your computer , you don't get great sound as you do from your stereo."
