        "text": "For co-founding Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz, the idea of marriage defines his new book Remain in Love: Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Tina (now available via St. Martin’s Press) in two ways: via the pairing of music and art that defines his work and the 43 year union alongside wife Tina Weymouth in life as well as groups like Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club.\n\nFrantz’s new book traces the earliest days of Talking Heads, a band which grew out of three members’ time at the Rhode Island School of Design, where Frantz and Weymouth began dating.\n\nIn 1974, The Artistics, a group featuring Frantz and singer/guitarist David Byrne broke up. Weymouth picked up bass and, following a move to New York, Talking Heads took on their earliest incarnation as a trio the following year (keyboardist Jerry Harrison joined once the band signed with Seymour Stein’s Sire Records in 1977).\n\nRemain in Love presents early dealings with people like Andy Warhol and Lou Reed and traces the explosion of a New York arts scene which nurtured musicians, models, writers, photographers, painters and actors, many of whom would go on to find fame in the 1970s and beyond.\n\nThe book is graphic in its depiction of the gritty New York City which gave birth to not just Talking Heads but punk rock in 1976, with legendary venue CBGB acting as ground zero, a setting which functioned at any given time as an oasis, refuge, incubator or, eventually, place of reflection.\n\nFrantz, Weymouth and Byrne lived together in cheap, cramped conditions which lacked heat and hot water, boasting instead cockroaches and mice. Gunshots pierced their ninth floor windows and band members dodged dead bodies in the Bowery - an affordable environment which allowed them to prioritize the making of art and music on their own terms.\n\nGrowing alongside unique artists like Blondie and Television, Talking Heads embarked upon their first tour as opener for The Ramones in Europe at a time when punk rock was defined by unpredictability and rebelliousness, an attitude as much as it ever was a particular sound.\n\nFrantz looks back upon that tour in stunning detail, ultimately tracing his career from Talking Heads through groundbreaking new wave work alongside Weymouth as Tom Tom Club, who beat Talking Heads to gold status in 1981, going gold with both their self-titled debut album and the single “Genius of Love.”\n\nWhile the four Talking Heads members briefly reunited, following a 1991 breakup, to perform during their 2002 induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Frantz lays out in detail a history of often acrimonious dealings with Byrne, which date all the way back to a spat over songwriting credits on “Warning Sign,” the second Talking Heads song ever written, a perhaps ominous sign of what was to come.\n\nChris Frantz is in the midst of a virtual book tour he’s dubbed “Remain Online” amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and we spoke about the marriage of music and art, life with Tina Weymouth, the legacy of Talking Heads and whether the instant success of Tom Tom Club further fueled a quickly growing divide with Byrne. A lightly edited transcript of our phone conversation follows below...\n\nYour recollections in this book - take that first Talking Heads European tour with the Ramones for example - are very detailed. How did this book come together? Did you journal?\n\nChris Frantz: Well, I thought I should be keeping a journal the whole time… but I didn’t. I’m kind of beating myself up years later for not keeping a journal - and also that I didn’t have a camera. That was really dumb.\n\nBut I was really fortunate in that Tina kept datebooks. Not really a journal - but she kept one of those for each year that we were touring. And she would write in it things like, “The Bataclan, Paris: Excellent show.” She’d write down the amount we got paid. And she’d also write down the amount of encores we had and whether or not she thought it was a good show. Sometimes she’d write something like, “Never come back here again.” (Laughs) Things like that.\n\nSo, that was very helpful to me. Because you can go online and search “Talking Heads tour dates” and get a big list of tour dates. But a lot of times, those are not correct. If you’ve ever been on a tour, you know that they evolve. The roadies would say when they got the first itinerary, “this is nothing but a tissue of lies.” Because they would know from experience that dates get cancelled and other dates get added. Venues change. And so on and so forth.\n\nSo, I was very fortunate that Tina kept these very accurate datebooks. And that helped. Because I would think about it and realize, “Oh, I remember having dinner after the show!” Things like that.\n\nHow long did you spend working on it?\n\nCF: I worked on it for approximately two years. I thought it would go much faster.\n\nFirst, I had to decide on the tone of the book. And I decided that it should be an optimistic and positive tone. Although, I was listening to BBC Radio yesterday and I heard some author say, “Nobody wants to read about a good marriage. They want to read about conflict. They want to read about problems.”\n\nBut my marriage has been great. My love for Tina remains very strong. We just celebrated our 43rd wedding anniversary. Yes, our life has had many twists and turns but the constant in my life has been Tina. And that was really good. And still is.\n\nAs important to the heart of Remain in Love as Talking Heads or Tom Tom Club is the strength of your relationship with Tina...\n\nCF: It’s been with Tina that I’ve really lived my entire life. Well, since college days. That was why I decided to make her sort of like the hero of the book. Because I’ve had a lot of good friends and a lot of wonderful experiences but it’s been with Tina that I’ve remained in love.\n\nWhat’s always amazed me about the punk scene - at least the one from which Talking Heads emerged - is that punk, at that point, seems to have existed almost more as an idea or an attitude than any particular sound. Groups like Talking Heads and Blondie didn’t sound like The Ramones but were all considered “punk.” You shared bills with Television. What does the idea of punk mean to you?\n\nCF: We never considered ourselves to be punk. But we realized that it was to our advantage to share the same stage with these bands. Actually, I don’t know anybody who really called themselves “punk” in New York. But there was this was little magazine called Punk. And that was a fun magazine. They wrote about Lou Reed and Iggy Pop and The Stooges and The Ramones and ourselves and the New York Dolls. So we became associated with punk even though it was not a very accurate description of us or our music.\n\nAnd, as you probably know, when that became a problem was with marketing. It did become a problem with marketing in the United States. Because radio station program directors would say to the promotions man who handed them the record, and asked them to play it, “Oh, they’re punk. We don’t play punk. We only play good music.” And so Seymour Stein very astutely said, “Oh, Talking Heads are not punk. They’re new wave…” And then the program directors said, “Oh, new wave? Well, we can play new wave.”\n\nSo these names “punk” and “new wave,” “power pop,” “electro” - these are all descriptors that sometimes fit the band and sometimes don’t.\n\nRadio comes up frequently in the book. Listening to rock radio on KQV and R&B on WAMO. Later at Brown University’s WBRU. You tell a story about what a thrill it was hearing “Psycho Killer” on the radio outside Nashville. At a vastly different time for that medium, radio had the capability of describing a city or locale before that visual was a click away. How did radio shape your early musical influences and your worldview prior to the internet?\n\nCF: It was extremely important. Because that’s where we would hear things first - particularly as teenagers, when you couldn’t really go anywhere to speak of. You would hear the new Beatles or Dave Clark Five. When psychedelic music came out, the new Big Brother and The Holding Company with Janis Joplin, you would hear that on the radio first. And then you would go out and buy the record. That was how it went. So the radio was very important to me.\n\nI still love the radio. In fact, I have a little monthly radio show at our local community radio station WPKN here in Connecticut. I love doing it.\n\nRadio was of extreme importance. Tina and I would listen to WBRU - and to a lesser extent WPRO, which was Providence’s top 40 station at the time - while we were working in our studio. And I would think, “Oh. I can write a song better than that…” But it was also very inspiring when you would hear a new David Bowie song or a new song like “Walk on the Wild Side” by Lou Reed. Or even The Delfonics or The Stylistics.\n\n[In the Velvet Underground song “Rock & Roll”] Lou Reed said, “Despite all the amputations, you could dance to the rock and roll station.” And that’s pretty much how I felt about it.\n\nWhen Talking Heads were initially approached by Seymour Stein to record for Sire Records, you waited until you were as comfortable in the studio as you were on stage. You waited almost a year and a half to sign a deal. That’s almost unthinkable today. Everyone jumps at those offers. How important do you think that turned out to be for the band moving forward?\n\nCF: Oh, I think it was a really good idea. Because our stagecraft and our musicianship wasn’t good enough until we got to a certain point. And then it started to gel and sound like a real band. I mean, we could put on an interesting show - and maybe even a little bit exciting show - but it was not the type of thing that you’d want to record and listen to over and over again in the privacy of your own home.\n\nWhen you make a record, you hopefully wanna record a record that people will want to listen to again and again. So you have to have your sh-t together.\n\nHow freeing was it during the Tom Tom Club sessions to not only make music on your own terms but also have the nearly instant success that came with it? Was that validating in a way for you at that point?\n\nCF: It felt really great. It was like magic. It was like magic was happening. I mean, we did the work and everything - but it really took off.\n\nAnd a lot of people didn’t know who Tom Tom Club was. They had no idea that it was Tina and me.\n\nTalking Heads was always the mother ship - and we never had any thoughts about leaving Talking Heads. We never even thought about making a Tom Tom Club record until our hand was kind of forced to do something outside of Talking Heads - because David was and Jerry was. We needed to make some money. So we did it despite the fact that it wasn’t really something that we had planned on.\n\nBut we got it together and we came up with some really different sounding tracks that had enormous appeal.\n\nYou don’t come right out and say this in the book. But there was something I couldn’t help but wonder after reading it. Do you think that initial massive success of Tom Tom Club became a source of jealousy for David, even if it was down the line - maybe following the lack of success around his True Stories film?\n\nCF: Yes. David was very competitive with the rest of us in that respect. You’d think he would’ve said, “Oh! That’s great! I’m so happy for you.” But no. He never said that ever. Jerry Harrison was a little more sanguine.\n\nBut, you know, nobody was expecting that. Certainly not us. We weren’t really expecting to have our first gold and platinum records with Tom Tom Club. I’m sure glad we did it though.\n\nWhether it’s Tom Tom Club or Talking Heads, we’re talking bands and music that made it seem OK to look or act or sound different. It seems like maybe that’s an idea that’s as important in the world today as it’s ever been. Is that a role music can play today, to help people embrace things that are different?\n\nCF: Oh, I think so. Yes.\n\nIt’s hard to be different these days though isn’t it? There’s so many formulas that people expect you to kind of follow or at least observe. We were trying to get away from formulas and try to be somewhat unpredictable and surprising, you know? It’s much harder work to be surprising these days.\n\nAlthough, I must say, Bob Dylan surprised me with his new record. It hearkens back to the late-60s. Maybe even the mid-60s. I think it’s up there with his greatest work. And who was expecting that?\n\nI remember hearing Talking Heads’ “Life During Wartime” after 9/11 and thinking that it sounded so relevant again at that time. I saw Mavis Staples cover “Slippery People” recently, as she has many times, and thought, “That song is more appropriate today than it’s ever been.” I’m amazed at how well some of your songs kind of speak to these contemporary times despite having been written decades before. In your opinion, can the meaning of a song change or evolve with the times?\n\nCF: I don’t know that it can change. I guess the answer is yes… but I don’t know. I’m so happy that our repertoire still sounds good - still sounds with it and contemporary. God, if it didn’t, that would really be terrible.\n\nBut “Life During Wartime,” I think, really means the same thing now as it did then. Same with some of our more happy songs. “Once in a Lifetime” or “Found a Job.” I think they’re still relevant in the same way they were in the 70s or the 80s.\n\n“It’s time to move on,” is a quote attributed to David Byrne on multiple occasions in the Remain in Love book. What I find ironic about that is that musically, whether it’s been with Talking Heads or Tom Tom Club, you and Tina have always found a way to push the music forward... Together. How important has that concept of discovering new sounds and pushing forward together been for you?\n\nCF: You know, sometimes we succeed at that and sometimes we don’t.\n\nThe reason you make a record or you make a painting or a movie - it’s all the same thing I think: You want to convey your feelings to other people and hopefully have the people remember them for more than just a year or a week or something.\n\nSome people say they don’t care what other people think about their music - or whatever their art form is. But I think it’s kind of crazy to do stuff if you don’t care what people think.\n\nI know we try not to read our bad reviews but we sure love our good reviews.\n\nWhether it’s Talking Heads or Tom Tom Club, how did the marriage of music and art come to define the music you’ve made?\n\nCF: We always felt that music and art went hand and hand. Really, the same impulse that makes you want to write a song makes you want to create a painting or photograph.\n\nWe always felt like popular music is capable of being great art. People that demonstrated that to us over the years were The Beatles, Stones, Otis Redding, James Brown, Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Aretha Franklin - all of these people wrote very popular songs. But they’ve also lasted. And I’m sure will continue to last far into the future.\n\nPopular music is capable of being great art."
