        "text": "ALTHOUGH the University of Bridgeport has decided not to yield control of WPKN‐FM, its widely popular “alternative” radio station, to a National Public Ratio affiliate, the controversy over who will operate the station, and with what sort of programming, has not been resolved.\n\nThe university is considering three future models for the station. Two of them would grant National Public Radio access to WPKN's airwaves (though the university would remain the licensee) and the third model calls for revising present programming to conform to “Public Radio standards.”\n\nBut the university has overlooked a crucial factor in its deliberations over the station's future: the listeners. They plainly do not want National Public Radio, nor do they want any other substantial changes in the free‐form format the station has followed since its inception 14 years ago.\n\nShortly after the university announced the contemplated switch to Public Radio, the university's president, Leland Miles, the board of trustees and the Federal Communications Commission received hundreds of letters and petitions from listeners in Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield Counties and from Long Island, Westchester County and Manhattan. The message from the listeners was unequivocal: Let it be, don't deprive people of a unique, irreplaceable station that has earned its large and loyal audience.\n\nMany letter‐writers likened the proposed change to Public Radio to a mugging of the airwaves, a deliberate attempt to stifle unconventional radio in favor of “safer,” prepackaged programming.\n\nA university spokesman said, however, that the letters were “absolutely not a factor” in the trustees’ decision to keep the station's license. That decision, he asserted, was prompted solely by a feeling that “some exciting things could be done on our own with the station.”\n\nThespokesman's remarks are revealing on two counts. They indicate not only that the trustees, as WPKN's “owners,” are indifferent to the wishes of the listeners, but also that the trustees have not been listening to the station, or at least not with any regularity. If they had, they would have been aware that exciting things are already being done, and that the best thing the university could do would be to adopt a laissezfaire policy toward the station.\n\nIn urging that WPKN be allowed to retain its current format, this writer must admit to some personal involvement. As a part‐time community staff member (whose involvement is limited to broadcasting a weekly one‐hour program of Jamaican reggae music), I obviously have a stake in the station's future. But since my participation has been peripheral, I was unaware of what the totality of WPKN's programming means to its listeners.\n\nA Westport fan wrote that he was “shocked and dismayed that something so important to me was going to be destroyed.” A Bridgeport lawyer declared, “It would be a tragedy to transfer the license.” A Yale professor wrote that “no other station offers the kind of news coverage offered by WPKN,” and a Long Island listener said that “outside of Columbia University radio, WPKN has no equal in presenting the most progressive and classical music of today and tomorrow.”\n\nAnother writer said that WPKN “is simply the best radio station in New England.”\n\nWhat is it about WPKN that elicits such support? Listeners consistently commended its “alternative” programming, so perhaps a review of that programming is in order.\n\nMusical broadcasts are wildly eclectic, featuring everything from Appalachian folk music and contemporary rock to ävant‐garde jazz and classical sounds. In addition to the four‐hour shows, the station presents a number of specialized programs. These include Sunday‐morning program of Indian classical music; a program of salsa and other types of Latin music popular with Hispanic audiences in Bridgeport and surrounding cities; this writer's own reggae hour, and a rhythm‐and‐blues: show of interest to collectors of obscure: classics of that genre.\n\nThe station also regularly offers live, in‐studio performances and taped music by local musicians.\n\nNews coverage is likewise more sophisticated than what is usually offered’ on a college station. The station supplements Associated Press, ABC and Reuters dispatches with news and public‐affairs shows produced by staff members.. WPKN broadcasted gavel‐to‐gavel coverage of the Watergate hearings; coverage of last year's Presidential conventions provided by the Pacifica network, and taped reports by an on‐the‐. scene staff member from the recent: Seabrook, N.H., antinuclear demonstrations.\n\nThe station has also broadcast lectures from the university by Ralph Nader and Buckminister Fuller, psychological “self‐management” programs and debates on prison reform be: tween former convicts and representatives of the state's penal system. WPKN has consistently offered cogent and indepth coverage of environmental issues, earning a commendation from the Friends of the Earth.\n\nWhen confronted by this roster of achievements, the station's detractors will sometimes say, “Well, yes, there are good things, but the editorializing must go.” Actually, there is no editorializing—what WPKN does is offer commentary and opinion by individual announcers, and noncommercial, educational stations such as WPKN have traditionally been allowed latitude in this area.\n\nThis writer cannot help feeling that since much of the commentary expresses alternative or left‐of‐center views, the complaints stem less from an aversion to “editorializing” than from the contents of the “editorials.”\n\nThe substantial support WPKN has received (and continues to receive) from its listeners convincingly demonstrates that there is a sizable audience for the type of programming the station offers. But in addition to serving as an outlet for creative broadcasting, the station is of considerable public‐relations value to the University of Bridgeport, whether the university realizes it or not. Prospective students are attracted by the sophisticated image of the university projected by the station and by the opportunity to gain broadcasting experience. The station may also indirectly benefit the university by improving job prospects for graduates.\n\nA New York‐based advertising executive wrote: “It is not inconceivable that I might be in a position to hire a University of Bridgeport graduate. Frankly, before I heard WPKN, the University of Bridgeport was merely a name to me. But my new awareness of the school means that I would give that graduate more attention than I would have, had I not heard WPKN.”\n\nTo abandon WPKN‐FM's alternative format would certainly be an injustice to its listeners. It could also very well be a blow to the University of Bridgeport's public image.\n\nJohn Cayea"
