It was\n\nhalfway through the new Rufus Wainwright song that caught my ear. I was\n\nthrilled because I had not purchased the CD yet. When the song was over I\n\nleft the dial just where it sat and for what could have been an awful 40\n\nminute, traffic filled ride on the Belt Parkway, I heard some of the best\n\nradio programming ever. It was such a good program that I actually embraced\n\nthe idea of circling the blocks, looking for a parking spot. When you gave\n\nthe set list, I frantically scribbled down names I was unfamiliar with:\n\nDamien Rice, Mojave 3, etc. The following day, I went to Tower Records and\n\nbought them all.\n\nI thought I had discovered a secret when I stumbled onto your program, but\n\nwhen I searched on google, I immediately realized that I am just one of\n\nmany, many New Yorkers who are blessed to have you steering us through an\n\notherwise desperate sea of bad music.\n\nSo, I just wanted to say thank you for such a fantastic radio program.\n\nI look forward to many more Saturdays tuning in,\n\nand am wistful that I have missed so many...\n\nBest,\n\nKevin McLoughlin\n\nProduction Manager,\n\nHistory Detectives\n\nDate: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 20:04:13 -0700 (PDT)\n\nFrom: Rachel Mabbett\n\nSubject: how to get copies of the show?\n\nTo: mixedup@pipeline.com\n\nHi,\n\nI heard the 13th of September show in the car, but\n\ndidn't make it home to tape it, and it was great.

Please keep doing it.\n\nI have been a WBAI person on and off since 1979 as my\n\nfortune, my address with respect to the transmitter,\n\nand station politics, have waxed and waned.

From Buddy Ebsen, to Leni Riefenstahl and\n\nEdward Teller, who truly bring the 20th Century to an\n\nend, from Gregory Peck to Strom Thurmond, not to\n\nmention those of the last 3 days.

What a great playlist--and no commercials!\n\nAnyway, I wasn't able to find the pipeline website you spoke of, so I thought I'd email you.\n\nYesterday you said you had tickets for a Morcheeba concert on Wednesday night in the city.\n\nI've been listening to them for about 7 years now and missed them the one time they came to Texas.\n\nIs there any chance you have 2 extra tickets that you'd be willing to spare for a poor college student and his girlfriend who completely LOVE this group? Their cover of \"Summertime\" with Hubert Laws is amazing, by the way.\n\nIf there's any way you could get that on the air this time of year, your listeners would probably eat it up...\n\nWell, thanks so much for your time. I look forward to listening to the station on a regular basis now and hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEvan Thompson\n\nFrom: \"rae rae\"\n\nTo: <Mixedup@Pipeline.com>\n\nSubject: Hello\n\nDate: Sat, 6 Jul 2002 18:14:40 -0400\n\nI like your show.\n\nIt's smooth & comfortable\n\nand yet stimulating at the same time.\n\nI guess the selections\n\nrepresent the selector.\n\nThank you.\n\nDate: Sat, 29 Jun 2002 18:46:48 EDT\n\nSubject: (no subject)\n\nTo: mixedup@pipeline.com\n\nHey Pete,\n\nI wondered if you had any information on the song you played today (6/29)\n\nat 5:10pm.

I'm making MY\n\nshare of noise about this, even though I have been physically ill and having\n\nto deal with severe abuse in my present situation....I'm still trying to do\n\nwhatever I can about the beleaguered station...all those who ARE so\n\nthreatened and concerned should NOT be let DOWN! I KNOW what it is like to\n\nhave very little or no help! Inseverely frightening circumstances! I CAN\n\n---and have BEEN!--finding many people online who are sometime listeners who\n\ndidn't even KNOW about the crisis, much less know how to deal with it!\n\nTo: BP <mixedup@pipeline.com>\n\nSubject: you, too, now?\n\nDate: Thu, 11 Jan 2001 11:25:11 -0500\n\nhey peter.\n\nsomebody on the wfmu gab email list referred to you being censored on 'bai.\n\nbut they didn't elaborate.\n\ni heard part of your show this monday, but i didn't catch anything that\n\nmade me think something was up.\n\nso, what's up?\n\nthis is such a bizarre situation. this is not a good time for a resource\n\nlike wbai to be in disarray.\n\nbye!\n\n=bw\n\nFrom: Frenchy315@aol.com\n\nDate: Wed, 10 Jan 2001 09:39:01 EST\n\nSubject: question about Pacifica Board of Directors\n\nTo: mixedup@pipeline.com\n\nHello, ALL MIXED UP\n\noften, your show is so muscially stimulating,\n\nthat i find myself practicing at the piano by 11\n\nbut on monday i stayed to the end because i was interested in the censorship news\n\nmy question, which i can't find answered anywhere:\n\nWHO CHOOSES THE PACIFICA BOARD OF DIRECTORS?\n\nI know they didn't fall from the sky ... what was the process?\n\nif you can't find time to answer i'll understand ... and will get the answer\n\nelsewhere\n\nthanks, ira goldstein\n\nDate: Tue, 9 Jan 2001 10:34:59 -0800 (PST)\n\nFrom: bill satoris\n\nSubject: Re: Order Status\n\nTo: mixedup@pipeline.com\n\nPeter -\n\nThe 3 CD anniversary set finally arrived this weekend. Thanks again, they're really great. Your work captures so much....\n\nyou warn that we all edit reality, but your editing seems to track pretty well with my own view of things....\n\nI think what I like is the way historical moments are distilled with political, cultural, and artistic counterpoint.....\n\nsort of a sound montage haiku....very evocative ..\n\nANYWAY I really like what you've done and would love to hear more....\n\nI tried to listen to your WBAI audiostream yesterday, but .... the music was pretty low fidelity,\n\nthe portion of the 21st Century Shortcut came through a little better.\n\nIt sounds like you are still editing/finishing a final version of that program but I think I'd add that to my list when it's available....\n\nSo, when time allows, please let me know your suggestions...\n\nThanks again and good luck with the WBAI/Pacifica crisis\n\nFrom: \"Eva Yaa Asantewaa\"\n\nTo: <mixedup@pipeline.com>\n\nSubject: censorship at WBAI\n\nDate: Tue, 9 Jan 2001 09:13:43 -0500\n\nJust got an email about the censorship of your most recent Shortcuts\n\nprogram.
