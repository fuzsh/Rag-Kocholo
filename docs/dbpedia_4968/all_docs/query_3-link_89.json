        "text": "In the winter of 1979, on February 22, to be exact, I initiated the weekly blues show and dance, Mark Naftalin's Blue Monday Party, at the Sleeping Lady Cafe in Fairfax, California. As part of advertising the event, I made drop-by appearances on San Rafael's KTIM, which is now defunct but was then a last bastion of free-form radio on the commercial side of the Bay Area dial. My host was the late Paul Boucher, who made me most welcome. My first guest appearance with him, which I referred to as the Blue Monday Party Of The Airwaves, was on March 26, 1979. After a couple of weeks of this, the management of the station invited me to pre-record an hour for broadcast on Monday evenings. I continued to use the name Blue Monday Party Of The Airwaves for about five months; then I switched over to Mark Naftalin's Blues Power Hour. I thank Paul Boucher for bringing me into the world of radio.\n\nIn 1982, after three years of weekly Blues Power Hour broadcasts and Blue Monday Party dance-concerts, production director Dennis Hale and I developed another Monday-night broadcast for KTIM. Airing from 9 to 10 p.m. and followed by the pre-recorded Blues Power Hour, this new radio show emanated from our weekly event at the Sleeping Lady Cafe and was also called Mark Naftalin's Blue Monday Party. The Blues Power Hour and the Blue Monday Party, along with all the rest of KTIM's free-form or specialty programming, went off the air in the fall of 1983 when the station changed ownership.\n\nOn June 25, 1984, the Blues Power Hour began what turned out to be a very long run as a weekly broadcast on non-commercial KALW-FM, which is an NPR outlet in San Francisco. The show aired on Monday nights until April, 2007, when it moved to Wednesdays. On KALW, as I did on KTIM, I program blues of all stripes from the 'twenties on forward, along with music from the overlapping realms of gospel, soul, R&B, zydeco, rock'n'roll, country and jazz.\n\nFrom February, 1987, through January, 1990, I also presented the Blues Power Hour on commercial KFOG, San Francisco's powerful pop-music station. My show was part of the \"Adventure Hour,\" which was the creation of Dave Logan, the KFOG program director at that time. The \"Adventure Hour\" was an umbrella for various specialty shows, such as a Grateful Dead hour, a reggae hour, and so forth, all airing at a given time (first it was 9, then 11) on weeknights (my night was Thursday). I tried to tailor my programming to a stereotypical notion of the \"KFOG listener.\" In other words, I leaned more on the guitar-heavy blues, stayed away for the most part from country blues or blues from before the 'fifties, and never played gospel. The show seemed to be well-received and the station asked me to produce two 18-hour blues marathons, which they said were very successful. When Dave Logan moved on to a New York City station, a new program director came in who cleansed the KFOG airwaves of the Blues Power Hour and all the rest of the \"Adventure Hour\" shows. And so the adventure ended. Such are the ways of commercial radio. I thank Dave Logan for hiring me at KFOG, for his encouragement, and for his programming creativity .\n\nIn 1992, the Blues Power Hour, then in its eighth season on KALW, received the Tom Donahue Radio Award for best program on a non-commercial station.\n\nIn 2002, my wife, Ellen, and I moved from California to Connecticut. At first, I produced my shows in real time onto a CD, which I sent back to the station. In early 2006 I started the transition from real-time production to hard-drive-based production.\n\nOn December 28, 2011, the Blues Power Hour completed a twenty-seven-and-a-half-years-long run of continuous broadcasts.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe Blues Power Hour continues to air on KALW from time to time. Following broadcast, the show resides for awhile on the station's website: www.kalw.org. To listen, please click here and select \"Blues Power Hour.\"\n\nBlues Power Hour showcount as of June 15, 2016 (original shows, not including re-plays):\n\nKTIM 239\n\nKFOG 145\n\nKALW 993\n\nTotal: 1,377\n\nThere are playlists for all shows.\n\nMARK Naftalin was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he lived until his mid-'teens, gaining an early outlet for his blues piano style with area favorites Johnny & The Galaxies.\n\nMOVING to Chicago in 1961 and enrolling at the University of Chicago, Naftalin continued his pursuit of blues piano by sitting in (from time to time) at the campus \"twist parties,\" where the resident bandleader was blues singer and harmonica player Paul Butterfield, whose band featured guitarist Elvin Bishop.\n\nAFTER graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, Naftalin moved to New York City for a year of study at the Mannes College of Music. On September 9, 1965, at a midtown-Manhattan recording studio, he sat in with Paul Butterfield and his band again — playing organ, this time, and sharing solos with Paul and the group's new lead guitarist, Michael Bloomfield, on a session warm-up song. As the session continued, Naftalin was invited to keep playing, and then to join the band, with whom he toured for two-and-a-half years and recorded four albums, including the classic East-West. The results of that fateful session — including the warm-up song, \"Thank You Mr. Poobah\" — are on the Elektra album The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which was the group's first album release.\n\nAFTER his stint with the Butterfield Band, Naftalin settled in the San Francisco Bay Area and embarked on a career which has included playing with and leading bands; solo concertizing; playing on blues and rock recording sessions (more than one hundred albums); producing festivals, concerts and radio shows; co-founding a non-profit cultural organization; songwriting and composing; and producing records for his own label.\n\nFROM the late 'sixties through the mid-'seventies, Naftalin played in the Bay Area and around the country (and on a number of recordings) with Michael Bloomfield, sometimes as a duo, but most often as a band called Mike Bloomfield And Friends.\n\nIN 1979, after producing several short blues concert series (starting at the Boarding House in San Francisco), Naftalin initiated Mark Naftalin's Blue Monday Party, a weekly blues show which ran for four-and-a-half years in two Marin County nightclubs, featured over sixty blues artists and groups, and was the scene of 86 live radio broadcasts and three television specials. Two of these specials (one with John Lee Hooker and Charlie Musselwhite, the other with Percy Mayfield and Lowell Fulson) have been broadcast on PBS stations in major markets and released as videos. The Blue Monday Party radio broadcast was honored with the Billboard Radio Award for best locally-oriented special programming, 1982.\n\nAS the Blue Monday Party grew, Naftalin developed his Rhythm & Blues Revue and his weekly Blues Power Hour radio show. Winner of the Bay Area Music Award (BAMMIE) for best blues/ethnic/gospel group of 1980, the Mark Naftalin Rhythm Rhythm & Blues Revue has played festivals and clubs on both coasts. On San Francisco's KALW-FM since 1984, Mark Naftalin's Blues Power Hour is the winner of the 1992 Tom Donahue Radio Award for the best program on a non-commercial station and has run on two commercial stations in the Bay Area: KTIM-FM (1979-1983) and KFOG-FM (1987-1990).\n\nFROM 1981 to 2000, Naftalin produced the annual Marin County Blues Festival. For eighteen of those twenty years, the festival was a special feature of the Marin County Fair in San Rafael, California. In 1985 and 1986, the festival took place at the Dominican College, which is also in San Rafael. Festival stars included Charles Brown, Nappy Brown, Dr. John, Mable John, Albert King, Nellie Lutcher, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Brownie McGhee, The Johnny Otis Show, Sonny Rhodes, the original Soul Stirrers, Rufus Thomas, Jimmy Witherspoon...and many more.\n\nFROM 1982 through 1992, Naftalin programmed blues for the Monterey Jazz Festival, where he earned the title of Associate Producer of the Blues Afternoon, and where the artists he chose include Bo Diddley, Ruth Brown, Albert Collins, Pee Wee Crayton, Lowell Fulson, Lloyd Glenn, Buddy Guy, Johnny Heartsman, John Lee Hooker, Etta James, B.B. King, Little Milton, Percy Mayfield, Jimmy McCracklin, Charlie Musselwhite, Yank Rachell, Carla Thomas, Irma Thomas, Henry Townsend, Luther Tucker, Katie Webster, Junior Wells...and many more.\n\nNAFTALIN'S other concert productions include blues festivals or shows at the San Mateo, Alameda and Sonoma County Fairs (all in California) and the Westport Blues Festival (1993-94) in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nIN 1982, Naftalin acted as interviewer and pianist in the video-documentary Percy Mayfield — Poet Laureate Of The Blues, the 1985 recipient of the Blues Foundation's Keeping The Blues Alive award in visual broadcast. This 30-minute video features blues poet Percy Mayfield singing his famous compositions with Naftalin on piano, along with interview segments, songs recorded onstage at the Blue Monday Party and testimonials from Ray Charles and B.B. King.\n\nIN 1983, Naftalin and Blue Monday Party production director Dennis Hale founded the Blue Monday Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering the appreciation and understanding of indigenous American music. The foundation has supported the Marin County Blues Festival, presented free community concerts and produced more than fifty historical shows sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, Inc. Naftalin has served as the organization's executive director and board president.\n\nIN 1988, Naftalin established Winner Producing Company and entered the record business with the independent label, Winner Records. Winner releases include two albums of live Paul Butterfield Blues Band nightclub recordings collected by Naftalin during his travels with the group (East-West Live and Strawberry Jam), and two albums recorded during Blue Monday Party radio broadcasts (Just Like A Devil by slide guitar virtuoso Ron Thompson and Percy Mayfield Live, Mayfield's only authorized live recording).\n\nRECORDINGS of Naftalin's compositions include the instrumental \"Strawberry Jam\" on the Butterfield Band's Strawberry Jam album (Winner); \"Lonely Song,\" sung by Buddy Miles on the Electric Flag's album The Band Kept Playing (Atlantic); \"Blues For Special Friends,\" played by Naftalin and an ensemble featuring guitarist Bobby Murray on the Bay Area anthology The Usual Suspects (Tomistoma); \"I Just Can't Stay\" sung by Sonny Rhodes in two versions (on The Blues Is My Best Friend (Kingsnake) and on Won't Rain In California, which was recorded in France for the Album label; and the Winner 45 \"Treehouse Blues,\" a piano solo, backed by \"Honest & True\" (a.k.a. \"Theme From The Blues Power Hour\"), on which Naftalin plays all five instruments.\n\nFOR his multi-faceted work as a musician and producer, Naftalin's reward has been friendship and professional connection with a host of musical greats, including — in addition to those mentioned above — Roy Brown, Francis Clay, Cool Papa, James Cotton, Nick Gravenites, John Hammond, Dottie Ivory, Little Joe Blue, J.J. Malone, Maurice McKinnies, Fenton Robinson, Otis Rush, Big Mama Thornton, Big Joe Turner, and Mississippi Johnny Waters, among others.\n\nSee also: Credits and Discography."
