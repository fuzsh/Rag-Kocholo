        "text": "Just wanted to let you know that your new CD blows me away. I got it from CDBaby a couple days ago and have been listening non-stop since then. It's really great to hear you step out a little and broaden your range, both instrumentally and song-wise. Who'd'a thunk we'd hear Garrin on baritone guitar and mandolin!!! In particular, \"The Loop\", \"Don't Panic\", and \"Where Joy Kills Sorrow\" are really powerful songs. I've got some extra copies of your new CD and I'll be distributing them to my friends to convert some more Garrin fans.\n\nDan Wardlow, SF, CA\n\nI'd like to request anything from the new Garrin Benfield (local guy) \"Where Joy kills Sorrow\". He's quite a musician, and has a gift for putting together some haunting rythyms, and his songs are really beautiful. I haven't heard him on KFOG at all, but have heard him LIVE and he totally captures the audience and holds us hostage while he plays...breathtaking really. I hope you'll consider his new CD for new releases Thursday.\n\nLakota Harden (Letter to KFOG, 104.5 FM), SF, CA\n\nSaw you opening for Dan Bern in Nelsonville, Oh. I'm hooked. Hooked I tell you. Just be glad I don't have the $ to follow you around on tour. I'm wearing out your CDs. You are so smooth. Haven't heard anyone play like you in years. Top it off with your writing and that lovely voice and face. You've got it all. Hope you keep playing and making CDs till I'm dead and gone. Bill Monroe must be really happy right now. Wish you health, strength, and many loving unions along your way. Oh yea, and lots of big money.\n\nRonda Emory, Columbus, OH\n\nGARRIN BENFIELD is an endearing part of music today. He grabs your heart with such hit's like \"Ugly\", one that makes my arms tingle and my eyes wet. I am so honored to air his music & will do so for months to come, maybe years! This man is a treasure, one that I will follow and will keep my listeners wanting more. There are many tracks to fall in love with and there are songs that will be played forever. He's a heart breaker and a heart maker.\n\nChris Mayner, www.kmud.org, CA\n\nI really enjoyed seeing you in Binghamton, NY a couple of weeks ago, & especially liked getting to chat with you. It's always nice to get to know someone whose music you like--it really adds an extra dimension to listening to the CDs! I have one complaint about the new CD--I can never make it to the last few tracks. After 'When Joy Kills Sorrow' ends, I keep hitting replay!! I was also so pleased that you sang my request of 'Hard Times.' The review you quote about taking all the roads is such an insightful one!\n\nJohn Duda, Binghampton, NY\n\nJust wanted to thank you again for the beautiful evening at muddy waters in Arcata, CA. Maybe it isn't the crowd you need, but little venues like that are so great for seeing terrific artists. Anyway, you have a gorgeous rich voice, and your music is quietly affecting. it really made my day. i hope you come back. and i'll look for you in SF when i am down. The Matthew Shepard song touched me. his murder was a turning point in my life.\n\nClayton Tschudy, Arcata, CA\n\nMaria & I caught you perform live at the 12 Galaxies...It was pretty amazing, just as it was at the Tongue & Groove...just one problem though...it was not long enough! I wanted more! Thanks for letting us know & I'll be sure to catch your new CD (congrats to you). Thanks for sharing your genius with us!\n\nJen, San Francisco\n\nLast night, Norman and I participated as a listening, laughing, love-inspired audience for Garrin Benfield's show at San Francisco's \"12 Galaxies\" Club. That one-man whirlwind of an entertaining guitarist-singer-soul-soaring-sprite kept us awed for almost an hour. Doing his famous \"looping jams\" as well as new tunes on a bill with two other talented folk, Libby Kirkpatrick and Tom Freund, Garrin Benfield lived up to everything we had heard about him and then some! He was so aware of his audience that he even included me in his acknowledgements and told everyone how he'd seen and been impressed by my performance at Martuni's over a year ago. His generosity reminded me that my mentions of all the talented folk in audiences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as those who were gracious enough to share their performances with us, proves that in show business, it's better to be inclusive than exclusive....Thank you, Garrin!!!\n\nHouston Allred, San Francisco\n\nHey Garrin! Just sitting here listening to the snippets from your new album courtesy of cdbaby and wanted to send you a quick shout out with as much kudos as an email can hold. Great job, your playing continues to inspire me! Hope all is well with you, see you out there mate!\n\nMartine Locke, Australia\n\nJust received my new Live CD and was surprised to see my name in the credits. Thank You very much, I'm honored. The CD is wonderful and getting heavy rotation in my house!\n\nSteve Murray, San Francisco\n\nIt's nice to hear your song Home on the Not In Our Name CD. It's definitely one of the strongest pieces on the CD and it's great that you were part of that project.\n\nJim e Sparkle Pants, San Francisco\n\nWOW!!!! It just keeps getting better and better. Thank you so much for continuing to share your gift.\n\nChris Lamorte, Burlington, VT\n\nJust wanted to let you know that you are beautiful, and people are listening to you and buying your cd's in po-dunk Ogden, Salt Lake Ciy, Lubbock. Just weird places, Please continue to do what you do, and we're all looking forward to seeing you very soon.\n\nBryce Franis, UT\n\nAs soon as you started singing ... i felt a chill. then as you continued playing and looping back and soloing and your voice. My whole body felt the chills. What a nice tribute to Elliott Smith. Everyone did a wonderful tribute but yours blew the audience away. I was with 2 others and they felt the same as I. WOW. i think the whole audience felt it. electrifying. My friends will be there on the 12th .. unfortunately I will not be able to make it your show. I am very disappointed but now i need to wait until April. The anticipation.... oh my..\n\nCherie, San Francisco\n\nI just wanted to thank you for your contribution tonight. It was the most heart-felt performance that I've seen in a long while! It was moving (for lack of a better description) and brought tears to my eyes. I was going to tell you in person, but caught the next bus instead...I figured there was not much reason to stick around after your set. Totally made my night. Thanks for making me feel alive. You are great....and I wish you luck. I know you'll do well!\n\nLisa Monstar, San Francisco\n\nYou're on fire - you're music is the best I've heard, your songwriting has taken off, you have charisma and a great band. Your guitar playing is much much stronger and confident now with all the effects and pedals. As they say in the music biz, you're \"poised\". I've never seen you better and I still believe a perfectly crafted live CD will break you, specially with what you do with \"How Shall I Send Thee\". The whole DSO, Dead, String Cheese audiences will adore you as long as you slip in a noodling 3-minute jam into every song (which you pretty much are). You must open national tour for one of them and the live CD will sell thousands.\n\nSteve, San Francisco\n\nI \"discovered\" you on accident about 1.5 years ago at the Bazaar Cafe (I was going to see someone else and showed up on the wrong night). On 4 separate occasions while I was playing your CD, I have had friends stop to say \"who is this?\" and \"can I burn a copy?\" (I felt kinda bad about this, so the last show I went to I threw some extra $ in the hat). I went to the show last week at the Tongue & Groove in SF with a couple of friends - Just wanted to say - Wow - great new stuff. I like the direction you are taking. I have another friend I'd like to take to the DuNord show next month. I look forward to the new CD and I wish you much success.\n\nMel, San Francisco\n\nIt was just amazing to hear you at the home concert. I found a lot of inspiration in what you do. The brave soloing, and of course the way you open up and sing, and the song \"Hungry Ghost\" which still haunts me. Peace, love, and music.\n\nEarl, Santa Barbara, CA.\n\nThanks so much for sending the CD -- I have really been enjoying listening to it. So far, my favorite tracks are \"To Know\", \"Tonight, I Know\" and \"Leg\", but I think the whole CD is excellent. Your voice and your guitar playing are both great.\n\nStephen Schwartz, New York, NY\n\nI was finally able to get the CD from CD Baby, it is tremendous!"
