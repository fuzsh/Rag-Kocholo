        "text": "[Transcript: I think it’s important to hear the voice of incarcerated contributors because prisoners are intersectionally disenfranchised and marginalized. Racism, sexism and classism all come into plan when we talk about those affected by mass incarceration.\n\nBy giving voice to the voiceless and listening to their stories we acknowledge that prisoners are human beings and not objects of correction or punishment.\n\nJust like it took a collective effort of outside and inside organizing and direct action to make this radio program possible; it will also take a collective effort to imagine an abolitionist future. A future without prisons.\n\nYou can’t force anyone to change but you can give people the opportunity to change. By giving prisoners an opportunity to speak you give them an opportunity to be something other than convicts.\n\nOn behalf of all the incarcerated contributors I say thank you for listening.\n\nOur pasts can’t change, however our present and future can.\n\nBy listening to this show and sharing your comments or questions, you are a part of that positive change.\n\nAgain, thank you for having us. -Lee Teka]\n\nNaturally, due to the innumerable restrictions placed on incarcerated people, this project requires some nontrivial level of outside support and coordination. However, we work to give our incarcerated family as much agency as possible in shaping and envisioning this project. Nearly all decisions are made by majority vote among inside contributors and all content is produced by folks inside.* From the show’s name and logo to the responses featured in the final show, everything is produced and voted on by incarcerated people unless explicitly specified otherwise. We on the outside just play a supporting role, and we plan to keep it that way. Our folks inside edit each other’s [anonymized] pieces and shape the show into what it becomes. Incarcerated people are the ones driving the show — we on the outside provide our reflections and have some influence in matters of editing/framing of the show’s content, but we never make decisions without consulting our folks inside and obtaining their consent.\n\n*We on the outside do have control over things like website design and social media, but any matters related to the show’s content require participation from our folks inside, along with a majority vote."
