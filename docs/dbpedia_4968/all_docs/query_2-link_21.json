        "text": "For 18 years, VFR member and automator Warren Odess-Gillett has been making sure the right programs play at the right times every week.\n\nGet to know more about Warren in this Q & A interview. Read on!\n\nInterview by Miasha Lee\n\nWhat is the name of your show, the premise and when it airs?\n\nMy show is called “A Bahá’í Perspective.” It airs on Saturday mornings at 10 a.m., and I interview people who have either chosen the Bahá’í faith as a way of life or who have a relationship with the Bahá’í faith.\n\nWhat is Bahá’í faith and what does it mean to you?\n\nThe Baha’i Faith is a world faith that has three basic tenets:\n\nGod is One – we all worship the same god regardless of what we call god (e.g., Great Spirit, Jehovah, Allah, etc.)\n\nHumankind is One – we have reached the age of maturity to realize the potential that we are all one human family (“The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens”).\n\nReligion is One – god reveals his message from age to age in a progressive manner like school. This message is communicated to us via the world’s great religious founders: Abraham, Moses, Christ, Mohammad, Buddha, Krishna [and others that are part of Indigenous cultures]. I became a Baha’i when I was eighteen looking for a spiritual community that shared my most treasured values and I have been a Baha’i ever since.\n\nHow many days do you automate?\n\nEditor note— automation is software that helps our radio station stay on air 24/7 between live programs. Automation requires weekly maintenance.\n\nI automate three days a week (Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday). Technology has changed over the years. Initially, you had to be at the station to put the program files into the automation application, but now it’s so much simpler because you can do everything at home. You don’t even need to interface with the automation program. I can put files in a certain location and a folder structure. That’s all I need to do.\n\nWhat town are you from and did you always aspire to be in radio programming?\n\nI’m from Hadley, MA and I’ve been living there for 29 years. After I graduated high school, I didn’t have a clue what I wanted to do. At first, I thought I wanted to be an engineer; then to be a social worker and then I thought about psychology, so I left college for a year. I went back to college to study special education for a year and a half, but I wasn’t cut out for that. All of this took place in the Baltimore area. After that I moved to Connecticut and tried engineering again. I studied electrical engineering at the University of Hartford. I had no intention of going into radio at all. It just came to be.\n\nHow did you first hear about Valley Free Radio?\n\nDavid Gowler, one of the founding members of Valley Free Radio, told me about a new station coming on the air and if I was interested, propose a program. I thought, what an opportunity to get the Bahá’í message out there on the airwaves. I started interviewing local Bahá’í’s and then I was able to broaden my interviewee base by using Skype. I’ve been doing that since 2006 and I have had about 500 interviews.\n\nWhat made you want to automate other shows?\n\nTo be a VFR member you have to have a job and since I was familiar with the automation technology to load my own pre-recorded program, I was happy to take on the responsibility of automating certain periods of time. At first it started with Saturdays. Then on Tuesdays and at some point, it expanded to the whole weekend as well as Tuesdays. It was going to be a job that I can do for Valley Free Radio in order to have my program. That would be a perfect fit for me, and it’s been a great job.\n\nWhat’s the most interesting thing that happened while you were automating?\n\nI don’t know if this is funny or not, you have to connect remotely to the computer that hosts the automation software. I thought I had disconnected myself and then I was going to shut down my own computer. I wasn’t disconnected, so I shut down the automation computer instead and nothing was playing on the air. I frantically called Bob Gardner who lives close by the station and told him what happened, and he graciously went over there and got things started again. Now, I’m a lot more careful when it comes to that kind of thing.\n\nEditor note: we still have a dedicated office computer that needs to stay on 24/7 for this task!\n\nWhat is the biggest technological enhancement you’ve seen in automating?\n\nThe biggest technology enhancement I appreciate is being able to log in remotely because it makes facilitating the automation process that much easier. If there’s an opening for somebody to automate a particular day, I highly recommend taking that job because you can do it at home on your computer and they’ve made it so much simpler.\n\nWhat has been the most rewarding or fulfilling part of this entire experience?\n\nGetting to know the radio technology, which was very mysterious to me. I remember the first day I did my program I had to switch on the microphone and be on the air. It was scary because now everybody can hear me from all over and it’s just been rewarding to understand how radio is done and to work with good people at Valley Free Radio that were very helpful and understanding especially if I made a mistake when I automated. It’s amazing to be able to work with a station that appreciates what I do and what I contribute.\n\nWritten by Miasha Lee\n\nAfter ten years of giving listeners commentary, poetry and music on Monday mornings\n\nfrom 6-9 a.m., Valley Free Radio programmer/host Bob Balogh of the Morning Roll has retired\n\nand broadcast his final show on Nov. 14. “I’ve reached my age and threshold of energy, so it’s\n\ntime to retire,” stated Balogh. “It’s been a richly rewarding experience in the last ten years at\n\nVFR. I’m hoping that by opening a space on Monday morning it will give someone else an\n\nopportunity to start something artistically for them.”\n\nBalogh has been on a radio station every year since 1981. He was in the Marine Corps in\n\nthe late 60’s as a radio man in the Vietnam War calling airstrikes, resupplies and medevacs. He\n\nattended Western Connecticut State University in the early 1980s, where he majored in theater\n\nand joined the college’s radio station WXCI. From there went on to a bigger community station\n\nin Bridgeport, CT known as WPKN for 30 years. Then transitioned to a station in Great\n\nBarrington, MA called WBCR from 2004-2012. One of the programmers at WBCR informed\n\nBalogh about a station they were doing some stuff in Northampton called WXOJ. He started\n\nlistening to the station and was attracted to what they were doing artistically so in 2012, he made\n\nthe move to Valley Free Radio WXOJ-LP 103.3 FM Northampton.\n\n“I’ve always been influenced by free form radio,” Balogh explained. I was really\n\nattracted to the whole greater Northampton community, what was going on musically and it was\n\nvery fulfilling.”\n\nThroughout his ten years at VFR, Balogh said he’s learned things along the way and has\n\nevolved based on what he’s been influenced by over his entire lifetime. He credits WXOJ and the\n\ngreater Northampton area for being exposed to so much new music and new artists that he\n\notherwise would have never paid attention to. That gave him energy and the thrill of being on the\n\nair alive.\n\n“Bob brought a level of professionalism and gravitas to VFR,” said Board of Directors\n\nmember Mark Bove who’s been at the station since 2014. “He has an authority in his delivery on\n\nair announcing the weather, time and news and does things you don’t expect of a morning show\n\nwith his wry commentary and humorous twists on obscure news events, the reading of his poems\n\nand writings from his chapter books and occasionally, bad puns.”\n\nBove continued, “Bob has done a really good job of talking to his audience as if he was\n\ntalking to an individual listener. He strived to make a connection between the person in the booth\n\nhere at the station and the person listening. That will be a legacy for others to strive to do\n\nthroughout their shows.”\n\nLila Wolan-Jedziniak, one of the founding VFR members/programmers has been good\n\nfriends with Balogh for many years. She considers him as a surrogate father who’s always looked\n\nafter her best interest. “One thing I’ve learned after this year is that I realize the meaning of\n\nfriendship,” Jedziniak replied. “He’s a positive person with his own sense of humor. I admire his\n\nwork ethic and drive. Bob manages to pull through no matter what he’s going through, and I want\n\nto be just like that 20 years from now in my life.” She went on to say, “Thank you Bob for the music. Thank you for keeping us informed of what’s going on in the community and thank you\n\nfor bringing some levity to the morning.”\n\nVFR member/board treasurer Stefan Ward-Wheten said, “Bob has been a benefactor of\n\nValley Free Radio. His willingness and ability to contribute in various different ways that makes\n\nhim a model programmer and a model community member of a station like ours.”\n\nWheten was just starting out and had been a few months on the air when Balogh came to\n\nthe station. During that time, Wheten recalled VFR didn’t have as full of a roster as they do now.\n\nThe community of programmers was still pretty small and there were still large gaps in the\n\nschedule that they were filling with Pacifica content or rebroadcast content. VFR didn’t have a\n\nmorning broadcast and the morning is traditionally an important time slot in radio because that’s\n\nwhen a lot of people are in their cars driving and listening to the radio. For Balogh to get a big\n\ntime slot of three hours in the morning was a lot even on a community radio station, but\n\nnonetheless he proved capable of keeping the momentum.\n\n“Before Bob, we really didn’t have anything like that in its place,” Wheten responded. “After his show became a fixture on our calendar, we started trying to actively cultivate a regular\n\nmorning lineup which has been pretty successful. Bob started the week off on Monday mornings\n\nand has connected us to a wider new audience.”\n\nWheten wants Balogh’s legacy at VFR to be his sensibility for bringing together various\n\naspects of his life, work, and interest into radio. His creativity in making all of these things fit\n\ntogether. As well as being open and generous with his time, insight and experience with other\n\nprogrammers, younger programmers especially. “That’s precisely what a station like Valley Free Radio is all about,” Wheten added. “It’s the kind of ethos that we really try to cultivate here, and, in some ways, I think it’s the reason we\n\nall do this, but Bob just happens to exemplify it really well.”\n\nRight now, Balogh is happy, content and has a plan. After leaving WXOJ, he’s\n\nvolunteering once a week at a station walking distance from where he lives in Pittsfield called\n\nWRRS devoted to the blind and handicapped reading the newspaper for two hours live on the air.\n\nHe also has his own performance studio in Pittsfield where he has poetry readings and theatrical\n\nperformances on CTSB-TV (Community Television for the Southern Berkshires) in Lee, MA.\n\nBalogh wants to be known as someone who appreciates his fellow broadcasters and learns from\n\neach and every person that’s there.\n\n“Preparation is the key to having a good radio show,” Balogh responded. “I just hope that\n\nI presented myself as a good enough person to win somebody’s respect. I’m just glad that I was\n\nable to be in a mellow frame of mind at this stage in my life where I could meet people at VFR\n\nand be a good listener and a good friend.”\n\nOn behalf of all the members here at Valley Free Radio, we thank Bob Balogh for his\n\nservice.\n\nMore Posts for Show: The Morning Roll\n\nVFR Chronicles, Volume 2: Collaborators of Technology\n\nWritten by Miasha Lee.\n\nValley Free Radio has a flourishing partnership with NCTV (Northampton Community Television), the city of Northampton’s public access television network. Collaborating on public events such as Northampton Pride, have an underwriting group with them and had an internship program from 2015-2016 training high school students on audio productions and editing.\n\n“Like us, NCTV has been a partner organization in terms of trying to foster independent media and independent media creators in giving them a platform. They’re more in the visual realm and we’re of the audio realm,” responded VFR member Stefan Ward Wheten.\n\nIn 2005, Former VFR member Joel Saxe began attending VFR meetings in a social hall at the First Churches of Northampton. He got his start in video production, filmmaking and teaching at Amherst Community Television and Springfield Community Access in the 1980’s when public access television was called community access television. “It was a really important side of community media production,” said Saxe. “Very much a\n\nprecursor in some ways to the low power FM movement that valley Free Radio is a part of.” He continued, “Now, people are making broadcast quality videos on iPhone. Back then if you wanted to make a video, you had to go to a community access station or a video production facility.”\n\nWith his background in video production, Saxe went to those meetings proposing a collaboration between Valley Free Radio and Northampton Community Television. To create programming for both shows through this partnership. “It would be synergetic to have the possibility that people could be doing public affair shows that would come out on Valley Free Radio on the airwaves, but there could also be a broadcast on Northampton Community Television on cable access,” Saxe told. “This was before\n\ncable and streaming was what it is now. We didn’t have it at that point so the ability to distribute independent media was something you didn’t have the kind of networks that we have today that are through the Internet.”\n\nSaxe had a series of conversations with NCTV on a possible collaboration. However, it didn’t pan out at that time for them to pair with VFR.\n\nIn 2006, Saxe became an VFR member and joined the Bread and Roses Radio. When Ed Charla the driving force of Bread and Roses passed away, Saxe took over the leadership capacity of the show until his departure from the station in 2018. In 2014, Saxe continued to do media work and editing projects at NCTV. While advocating a partnership with Valley Free Radio. Saxe, Wheten and other VFR members Bob Gardner and Rick Haggerty reached out to NCTV for a second time. They spoke to director Al\n\nWilliams and his board of directors on working together. NCTV said yes and that same year, the first studio camera was installed followed by two more in 2017.\n\nIn addition, NCTV advised the station on setting up the Dow studio and helped them do remote broadcasts. “In that time,” Wheten stated. “We’ve been able to lay the foundation of how- to multimedia content creation. We’ve been able to bring in cameras and given the opportunity to\n\nbroadcast video content. For programmers to record their shows on camera and make them available also to rebroadcast on NCTV on the actually television channel.”\n\nRecently, NCTV changed their name to NOM (Northampton Open Media) which is a direct re-brand of the network. As Northampton Open Media, they’re more than just television. They are still continuing to foster media creation in terms of Internet and multimedia content which Wheten hopes there’ll be more opportunities in the future to do that as well.\n\nThe cameras are set up at the radio station and there are resources available for shows that want to use the editing facility and borrow equipment such as remote audio recorders, microphones or\n\ncameras that are up.\n\nVFR still has a standing underwriting agreement with NOM and do their best to share their resources wherever possible.\n\nStick around for Vol. 3 of Valley Free Radio Chronicles."
