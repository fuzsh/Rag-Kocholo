        "text": "For the link to the May 23 episode of Franorama 2.0 on WPKN, click here and, for the final hour, here. Franorama 2.0 appears sporadically as a fill-in at PKN until your hostess’ job situation clears up and she can wrangle a regular shift.\n\nLast week was another double-duty week for Franorama 2.0 — the usual 10 a.m.-1 p.m. Friday shift (May 24) on Cygnus Radio, preceded by a fill-in shift from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday on WPKN, my terrestrial radio home in Bridgeport.\n\nIt was my first time back on the air in 2 1/2 months; my last show, part of a day-long Women of WPKN programming block in March, was a midnight-to-2 shift in the midst of the winter’s last big snowstorm. This was no usual show, either. Nor was it a usual fundraiser. It was the second shift into a two-day “Dylan Days” fundraiser, using Bob’s name in vain and exploiting the 40th anniversary of the day he could no longer be trusted (last Friday) in order to generate operating funds for the station.\n\nIt was Christmas for me, too. Got to hear (and rip into my laptop) a recent Columbia box set of his first eight albums remastered in mono on CD, plus a couple other albums. Also heard and played selections from a six-CD import box set, A Long Time a Growin’, a collection of live recordings from that pivotal year of 1961, which ended with Bobby Z being signed to Columbia Records. And it pays to read the liner notes: I played three songs (all Woody Guthrie tunes) recorded May 6, 1961 at the Indian Neck Folk Festival, an exclusive, invite-only fest staged by a couple of Yale grads at the old Montowese Hotel, in the Indian Neck section of Branford.\n\nThe radio shift was a success, as was the weekend — where, in addition to box sets, we put up, for the pledging, tickets to Dylan’s July 19 show at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport (with Wilco, My Morning Jacket and Ryan Bingham), as well as tickets to the Gathering of the Vibes the last weekend of July at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, and the Green River and Falcon Ridge festivals. The station’s goal for the two days was $10,200; John Corvino’s morning drive shift, preceding mine, brought in over $2K to open the fundraiser, and my shift brought in over a grand. It certainly was productive.\n\nWell, here was my Dylan playlist. Hope I passed the audition, No, wait, that was a Lennon reference …"
