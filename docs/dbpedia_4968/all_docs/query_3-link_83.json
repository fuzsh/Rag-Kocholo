        "text": "NIGHT BUS RADIO\n\nOctober 25, 2010 at 2:00 am | Posted in NIGHT BUS RADIO | Leave a comment\n\nThis is a very special presentation… a mix that I pieced together digitally over the past few months, but had been formulating for a few months before that. It’s partially an audio document of my first year in Ann Arbor, but it’s also a way to represent night bus on the radio airwaves. There isn’t really a formal definition of night bus, but credit must be given to boarders on a certain forum for developing the concept, and especially for posting a lot of ideas which I pretty much stole for this mix.\n\nMore than anything else these are just songs I’ve had stuck in my head to various degrees over the last year, that I thought maybe sort of there was some sort of underlying mood to.\n\nNIGHT BUS RADIO: WPKN (89.5fm / wpkn.org) October 24/25, 10PM-2AM\n\nhttps://theanswerisinthebeat.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/nightbus1.mp3 Hour 1\n\nBrian Eno: “Music For Airports: 1/1” (edit)\n\nHrvatski: “Second Zero Fidelity Mandible Investigation”\n\nSalem: “King Night”\n\nBalam Acab: “See Birds (Moon)”\n\nMemoryhouse: “Lately (Deuxième)”\n\nLil B: “B.O.R.
