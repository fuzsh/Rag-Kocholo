So, welcome to my whatever it's called this week.\n\nSee a program guide for the show every week at www.wpkn.org/cliff\n\nMusic from around the globe: roots, folk, jazz and the odd lot. Plus news, weather, traffic and whatever else comes along.\n\nAnd please join me on Facebook.\n\nRead more about the music I play (sometimes) at www.rootsworld.com\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nCliff Furnald"
