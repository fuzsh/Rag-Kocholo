I was using a program called Crystal Topas 3D.\n\nIt was decent for the early jobs when just having some text with a soft drop shadow was enough. Having anything 3D animation in 1995 was still considered pretty high end.\n\nIn 1996 I went to Siggraph in Los Angeles at the Staples Center. Siggraph was really something to behold back then. The big Softimage booths, Renderman/Pixar Booth, Alias/WAvefront Booth, and Silicon Graphics booths. I remember seeing the o2 and Octane and had just saved what I thought was a fat $12,000 from a few recent 3d jobs.\n\nI met with the Silicon Graphics guys, played with Softimage, and they told me to meet them at their Olympic/Bundy office in Santa Monica.\n\nWent there a week or so later. Can't remember which floor. They had a full on interactive experience where you check which software and which computer with which ram/cpus/hard drives etc.\n\nThey brought out donuts, coffee, etc.\n\nWhen I was finished I was quoted like $22,000ish for Softimage and around $44,000ish for the computer.\n\nI was hopelessly depressed. My measely $12,000 was able to get a decent early model o2 but then no Softimage. :(\n\nI ended up buying into Lightwave 3D for like $1000-ish and got a top notch Intel computer.\n\nLater that year the guys across the hall got an Octane and I was able to use it to mess with Softimage here and there.\n\nNever really was able to use an SGI for a paying gig. My first Maya and Softimage gigs were on a PC later as well.\n\nThe o2 I bought in 2009 was a kind of retro gift to my younger self. The Octane I acquired last year from Fox was really the Octane I wanted back then.\n\nIt is snappy and runs really nice and is the proper SGI experience I was hoping for back in 1996.\n\nIt is pure pleasure making tutorials on them and using the IRIX OS. Getting to try Houdini on Irix was a big surprise as well as Alias in this last year.\n\nMaya and Softimage were far more capable than I thought they would be after having run them through the paces trying to make them behave like modern software.\n\nThey still do very well considering it was on hardware/software that is 20ish years ago now.\n\n2x400 300 400 2x250\n\n(This post was last modified: 09-07-2018, 10:46 PM by Intuition.)\n\nRE: Your first SGI encounter?\n\n(09-07-2018, 10:45 PM)Intuition Wrote: Same story I told at Nekochan.\n\nI moved to Los Angeles to do computer animation/3d VFX etc. The o2 and Octane hadn't come out yet.

I know exactly how it feels, except I only had $5000 to buy an Indy because all the Indy ads in the catalyst magazine advertised the Indy for $4995. I called the Sgi hotline from the magazine ad, and they told me the same thing. I would need at least sped $12k and up. The $4995 didn’t come with a monitor, no hard drive, no CD-rom and 16 or 32mb ram. Basically a useless machine. I was depressed and ended up painting my windows 3.1 desktop computer running 3d studio r2 blue as my personal version on an sgi... yes it was sad.\n\nMy first encounter where I was in the same room as an sgi was at a information fair in 1998 when one of the exhibitors had a 21” sgi granite monitor displaying some 3d images. I could care less about what his company was about, but I had to compliment him on his choice of computer systems. So he lifted the skirt that was covering the green octane under the desk the monitor was sitting on. I was star struck. I was talking to the guy who purchased it to do 3d scans of dinasour bones. He said it requires 2 people to lift the machine and he said he spent $66k to purchase the machine. Then I went home and painted my Intel mini tower green because I knew I would never see one of these again up close.\n\n2x600mhz R14000 Octane2 dual head V12 / V10, 7 gig Ram\n\n2x250mhz R10000 2gig ram, MXE, Digital Video, MSCSI, Jaleo\n\n400mhz R12000 O2, 1gig Ram AV1 - 250gig Media' raid\n\n180mhz R5000 Indy XZ 256mb ram\n\n200mhz R4400 Extreme…….Under Construction\n\nDell T7600 dual 3.5 Xeon, 512 gb ram, Quadro K6000 + Tesla k20 - DaVinci Resolve Studio Editing\n\nDell T5500 dual 3.2 Xeon, 72gb ram, Quadro 6000 + Tesla C2075 - DaVinci Resolve Studio Cutting\n\nIntel i7-990x 3.46GHz Extreme 6 core / Quadro 5000 & 2 x Tesla C2075 / 24gig Ram inside an SGI 320vw case\n\n(This post was last modified: 09-12-2018, 03:43 AM by bjames.)"
