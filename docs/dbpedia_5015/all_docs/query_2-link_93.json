        "text": "Geography Geography\n\nEach month, about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers. We estimate that 21 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students.\n\nOur estimate of professional developers comes from the things people read and do when they visit Stack Overflow. We collect data on user activity to help surface jobs we think you might find interesting and questions we think you can answer. You can download and clear this data at any time.\n\nDeveloper-Roles Developer Roles\n\nDeveloper Type\n\nBack-end developer\n\n57.9%\n\nFull-stack developer\n\n48.2%\n\nFront-end developer\n\n37.8%\n\nMobile developer\n\n20.4%\n\nDesktop or enterprise applications developer\n\n17.2%\n\nStudent\n\n17.1%\n\nDatabase administrator\n\n14.3%\n\nDesigner\n\n13.1%\n\nSystem administrator\n\n11.3%\n\nDevOps specialist\n\n10.4%\n\nData or business analyst\n\n8.2%\n\nData scientist or machine learning specialist\n\n7.7%\n\nQA or test developer\n\n6.7%\n\nEngineering manager\n\n5.7%\n\nEmbedded applications or devices developer\n\n5.2%\n\nGame or graphics developer\n\n5.0%\n\nProduct manager\n\n4.7%\n\nEducator or academic researcher\n\n4.0%\n\nC-suite executive (CEO, CTO, etc.)\n\n3.8%\n\nMarketing or sales professional\n\n1.2%\n\n92,098 responses; select all that apply\n\nAlmost 60% of respondents identify as back-end developers, and about 20% consider themselves mobile developers. The median number of developer type identifications per respondent is 2, and the most common pairs are combinations of back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer. Pairs that are highly correlated are database administrator and system administrator, DevOps specialist and system administrator, and designer and front-end developer.\n\nContributing to Open Source\n\nNo\n\n56.4%\n\nYes\n\n43.6%\n\n98,855 responses\n\nNo\n\n55.5%\n\nYes\n\n44.5%\n\n87,450 responses\n\nAlmost half of professional developers on Stack Overflow contribute to open source projects. Involvement in open source varies with language. Over 70% of developers who work with Rust, Julia, and Clojure contribute to open source, while less than 40% of developers who work with VBA, VB.NET, and C# do so.\n\nCoding as a Hobby\n\nYes\n\n80.8%\n\nNo\n\n19.2%\n\n98,855 responses\n\nYes\n\n81.0%\n\nNo\n\n19.0%\n\n87,450 responses\n\nMany developers work on code outside of work. Over 80% of our respondents say that they code as a hobby. Other interests or responsibilities outside of software don't seem to reduce developers' interest in coding as a hobby. Those who said they are parents or have other caretaking responsibilities, those who exercise daily, or those who spend the most time outside were slightly more likely to code as a hobby than other groups.\n\nExperience Experience\n\nYears Since Learning to Code\n\n0-2 years\n\n11.4%\n\n3-5 years\n\n24.8%\n\n6-8 years\n\n20.6%\n\n9-11 years\n\n13.0%\n\n12-14 years\n\n8.6%\n\n15-17 years\n\n6.5%\n\n18-20 years\n\n5.4%\n\n21-23 years\n\n2.8%\n\n24-26 years\n\n2.0%\n\n27-29 years\n\n1.1%\n\n30 or more years\n\n3.8%\n\n93,835 responses\n\n0-2 years\n\n9.6%\n\n3-5 years\n\n24.4%\n\n6-8 years\n\n21.4%\n\n9-11 years\n\n13.5%\n\n12-14 years\n\n8.9%\n\n15-17 years\n\n6.8%\n\n18-20 years\n\n5.6%\n\n21-23 years\n\n2.9%\n\n24-26 years\n\n2.0%\n\n27-29 years\n\n1.2%\n\n30 or more years\n\n3.8%\n\n87,259 responses\n\nThere is a wide range of experience levels among developers, and a full third of professional developers on Stack Overflow learned to code within the past five years.\n\nYears Coding Professionally\n\n0-2 years\n\n30.1%\n\n3-5 years\n\n27.4%\n\n6-8 years\n\n14.6%\n\n9-11 years\n\n9.7%\n\n12-14 years\n\n5.5%\n\n15-17 years\n\n3.9%\n\n18-20 years\n\n3.6%\n\n21-23 years\n\n1.8%\n\n24-26 years\n\n1.1%\n\n27-29 years\n\n0.6%\n\n30 or more years\n\n1.7%\n\n77,903 responses\n\nOver half of respondents have five years of professional coding experience or less. Developers who work with languages such as Cobol and Perl have the most years of professional coding experience, while developers who work with languages like Matlab, Haskell, and Kotlin have the fewest.\n\nYears of Professional Coding Experience by Developer Type\n\nEngineering manager\n\n10.2\n\nDevOps specialist\n\n8.0\n\nDesktop or enterprise applications developer\n\n7.7\n\nEmbedded applications or devices developer\n\n7.5\n\nData or business analyst\n\n7.2\n\nSystem administrator\n\n7.0\n\nDatabase administrator\n\n6.9\n\nFull-stack developer\n\n6.3\n\nBack-end developer\n\n6.2\n\nEducator or academic researcher\n\n6.2\n\nDesigner\n\n6.0\n\nQA or test developer\n\n5.8\n\nFront-end developer\n\n5.5\n\nData scientist or machine learning specialist\n\n5.5\n\nMobile developer\n\n5.2\n\nGame or graphics developer\n\n4.6\n\nMean of 77,078 responses\n\nDevelopers who work in different areas of software development have different average amounts of experience. DevOps specialists and developers who code for desktop and enterprise applications have the most experience. DevOps as a discipline and professional identity is relatively new, but the people working in this field are highly experienced. Game/graphics developers and mobile developers have the fewest years of experience.\n\nEducation Education\n\nHow Many Developers are Students?\n\nNo\n\n74.2%\n\nYes, full-time\n\n19.4%\n\nYes, part-time\n\n6.4%\n\n94,901 responses\n\nAbout one-quarter of respondents are enrolled in a formal college or university program full-time or part-time.\n\nEducational Attainment\n\nI never completed any formal education\n\n0.7%\n\nPrimary/elementary school\n\n1.7%\n\nSecondary school\n\n9.5%\n\nSome college/university study without earning a degree\n\n12.4%\n\nAssociate degree\n\n3.1%\n\nBachelor's degree\n\n46.1%\n\nMaster's degree\n\n22.6%\n\nProfessional degree\n\n1.5%\n\nDoctoral degree\n\n2.3%\n\n94,703 responses\n\nI never completed any formal education\n\n0.6%\n\nPrimary/elementary school\n\n1.3%\n\nSecondary school\n\n8.2%\n\nSome college/university study without earning a degree\n\n12.1%\n\nAssociate degree\n\n3.1%\n\nBachelor's degree\n\n47.7%\n\nMaster's degree\n\n23.2%\n\nProfessional degree\n\n1.5%\n\nDoctoral degree\n\n2.2%\n\n85,710 responses\n\nWorldwide, about three-fourths of professional developers have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree or higher.

Almost half of our respondents who said they went to a coding bootcamp said they were already working as developers; these developers are likely updating their skills and moving to new areas of the tech industry. Of other bootcamp participants, the most common outcome is to find a job immediately or soon after graduating.\n\nDemographics Demographics\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\n92.9%\n\nFemale\n\n6.9%\n\nNon-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming\n\n0.9%\n\n64,364 responses; select all that apply\n\nMale\n\n93.1%\n\nFemale\n\n6.7%\n\nNon-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming\n\n0.9%\n\n60,389 responses; select all that apply\n\nMale\n\n92.5%\n\nFemale\n\n7.4%\n\nNon-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming\n\n1.1%\n\n13,985 responses; select all that apply\n\nWe asked our respondents about their gender identity, and found that over 90% of our respondents are male. According to Quantcast, women account for about 10% of Stack Overflow’s US traffic; this year 9% of US survey respondents are women. We had survey participation at almost the rate we would expect from our traffic, although such a low percentage points to problems with inclusion in the tech industry in general and Stack Overflow in particular. In regions including the United States, India, and the UK, women are represented at higher levels among students than among professional developers.\n\nThis year, 0.7% of respondents identified as transgender men or women. The gender identifications are select all that apply, so transgender men and women are included in the categories shown here.\n\nRace and Ethnicity\n\nWhite or of European descent\n\n74.2%\n\nSouth Asian\n\n11.5%\n\nHispanic or Latino/Latina\n\n6.7%\n\nEast Asian\n\n5.1%\n\nMiddle Eastern\n\n4.1%\n\nBlack or of African descent\n\n2.8%\n\nNative American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian\n\n0.8%\n\n57,473 responses; select all that apply\n\nWhite or of European descent\n\n74.3%\n\nSouth Asian\n\n11.5%\n\nHispanic or Latino/Latina\n\n6.7%\n\nEast Asian\n\n5.0%\n\nMiddle Eastern\n\n4.1%\n\nBlack or of African descent\n\n2.7%\n\nNative American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian\n\n0.8%\n\n53,982 responses; select all that apply\n\nWhite or of European descent\n\n64.2%\n\nSouth Asian\n\n15.3%\n\nHispanic or Latino/Latina\n\n8.6%\n\nEast Asian\n\n7.4%\n\nMiddle Eastern\n\n6.1%\n\nBlack or of African descent\n\n4.0%\n\nNative American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian\n\n0.9%\n\n12,023 responses; select all that apply\n\nHere again we see evidence for problems with diversity and inclusion. We see higher proportions of developers of color in students than professional developers. This year, 7.4% of professional developers in the United States identified as black, Hispanic or Latino/Latina, or Native American while over 10% of students in the United States identified as a member of one of these groups.\n\nSexual Orientation\n\nStraight or heterosexual\n\n93.2%\n\nBisexual or Queer\n\n4.3%\n\nGay or Lesbian\n\n2.4%\n\nAsexual\n\n1.9%\n\n59,765 responses; select all that apply\n\nStraight or heterosexual\n\n93.4%\n\nBisexual or Queer\n\n4.2%\n\nGay or Lesbian\n\n2.4%\n\nAsexual\n\n1.8%\n\n56,131 responses; select all that apply\n\nStraight or heterosexual\n\n91.7%\n\nBisexual or Queer\n\n5.2%\n\nAsexual\n\n2.9%\n\nGay or Lesbian\n\n2.5%\n\n12,552 responses; select all that apply\n\nThis is the first year we asked our respondents about their sexual orientation.\n\nParents' Education Level\n\nThey never completed any formal education\n\n1.9%\n\nPrimary/elementary school\n\n5.2%\n\nSecondary school\n\n17.3%\n\nSome college/university study without earning a degree\n\n9.2%\n\nAssociate degree\n\n4.6%\n\nBachelor's degree\n\n29.3%\n\nMaster's degree\n\n22.1%\n\nProfessional degree\n\n4.4%\n\nDoctoral degree\n\n6.0%\n\n61,813 responses\n\nThey never completed any formal education\n\n1.9%\n\nPrimary/elementary school\n\n5.2%\n\nSecondary school\n\n17.4%\n\nSome college/university study without earning a degree\n\n9.2%\n\nAssociate degree\n\n4.6%\n\nBachelor's degree\n\n29.4%\n\nMaster's degree\n\n22.0%\n\nProfessional degree\n\n4.4%\n\nDoctoral degree\n\n5.8%\n\n58,064 responses\n\nThey never completed any formal education\n\n2.4%\n\nPrimary/elementary school\n\n5.9%\n\nSecondary school\n\n16.3%\n\nSome college/university study without earning a degree\n\n9.2%\n\nAssociate degree\n\n4.5%\n\nBachelor's degree\n\n29.1%\n\nMaster's degree\n\n22.4%\n\nProfessional degree\n\n4.3%\n\nDoctoral degree\n\n5.9%\n\n13,326 responses\n\nLike developers themselves, most developers' parents have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree or higher.

For example, twice as many women than men have been coding two years or less, evidence for the shifting demographics of coding as a profession. Also, developers who identify as transgender men or women or of non-binary gender contribute to open source at higher rates (58% and 60%, respectively) than developers who identify as men or women overall (45% and 33%.)\n\nDeveloper Role and Gender\n\nThe dashed line shows the average ratio of men's to women's participation\n\nWe see varying representation by men and women in different developer roles on our survey. All categories have dramatically more developers who identify as men than women but the ratio of men to women varies. Developers who are educators or academic researchers are about 10 times more likely to be men than women, while developers who are system admins or DevOps specialists are 25-30 times more likely to be men than women. Women have the highest representation as academics, QA developers, data scientists, and designers.\n\nAge\n\nUnder 18 years old\n\n2.5%\n\n18 - 24 years old\n\n23.6%\n\n25 - 34 years old\n\n49.2%\n\n35 - 44 years old\n\n17.8%\n\n45 - 54 years old\n\n5.1%\n\n55 - 64 years old\n\n1.5%\n\n65 years or older\n\n0.3%\n\n64,574 responses\n\nUnder 18 years old\n\n1.9%\n\n18 - 24 years old\n\n22.4%\n\n25 - 34 years old\n\n50.8%\n\n35 - 44 years old\n\n18.2%\n\n45 - 54 years old\n\n5.1%\n\n55 - 64 years old\n\n1.4%\n\n65 years or older\n\n0.2%\n\n60,583 responses\n\nAbout three-fourths of professional developers who took our survey are younger than 35.\n\nAge and Experience by Country\n\nAustralia\n\n29.0\n\nUnited States\n\n28.7\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n28.2\n\nCanada\n\n27.7\n\nGermany\n\n26.6\n\nFrance\n\n26.0\n\nBrazil\n\n25.0\n\nRussian Federation\n\n24.7\n\nPoland\n\n24.6\n\nIndia\n\n22.7\n\nMean of 42,042 responses\n\nAustralia\n\n11.7\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n11.3\n\nUnited States\n\n10.7\n\nCanada\n\n10.2\n\nGermany\n\n10.2\n\nFrance\n\n9.2\n\nBrazil\n\n8.0\n\nPoland\n\n7.6\n\nRussian Federation\n\n7.6\n\nIndia\n\n4.2\n\nMean of 59,559 responses\n\nDevelopers on Stack Overflow are older with more experience in Australia, countries in Western Europe, and North America and younger with less experience in countries like India and Russia.\n\nKinship, Competition, and Self-Evaluation\n\nI feel a sense of kinship or connection to other developers\n\n3.6\n\nI think of myself as competing with my peers\n\n2.7\n\nI'm not as good at programming as most of my peers\n\n2.2\n\n68,577 responses; agreement on a 1-5 scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree\n\nWe asked how much respondents agree or disagree with several statements about their place in the developer community. Overall 70% of developers agree or strongly agree that they feel a sense of connection with other developers. Developers are overall confident about their own skills compared to their peers, with only 18% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are not as good at programming as their colleagues.\n\nExperience and Belonging\n\nRespondents' feelings on how much they belong and how they stack up to their peers change with how much experience they have. More experienced developers feel more connected, more confident, and less competitive. Notice that feeling less skilled drops quickly with experience while feeling less competitive drops more gradually and continues to drop into the second decade of coding experience.\n\nChildren and Other Dependents\n\nNo\n\n71.1%\n\nYes\n\n28.9%\n\n62,596 responses\n\nThis year we asked respondents if they have children or other dependents that they care for, and about a quarter of respondents say that they do. We asked in a free response question what these developers do for dependent care during work hours, and our respondents talked about options like school, their spouses/partners, and daycare.\n\nThe developers who said they do not have dependents to care for are younger on average than those who do. Over 30% of the developers without dependents are younger than 25, while only 5% of those with dependents are younger than 25. Almost 60% of developers with 10 or more years of professional coding experience have children or other dependents.\n\nWhat Time Do Developers Wake Up?\n\nBefore 5:00 AM\n\n2.4%\n\nBetween 5:00 - 6:00 AM\n\n12.4%\n\nBetween 6:01 - 7:00 AM\n\n28.2%\n\nBetween 7:01 - 8:00 AM\n\n29.5%\n\nBetween 8:01 - 9:00 AM\n\n14.7%\n\nBetween 9:01 - 10:00 AM\n\n4.8%\n\nBetween 10:01 - 11:00 AM\n\n1.4%\n\nBetween 11:01 AM - 12:00 PM\n\n0.5%\n\nAfter 12:01 PM\n\n0.4%\n\nI work night shifts\n\n0.5%\n\nI do not have a set schedule\n\n5.3%\n\n72,146 responses\n\nWe are confident that most developers have pulled a late night here and there, but most of our respondents say they are up by 8am.\n\nHow Much Time Do Developers Spend on a Computer?\n\nLess than 1 hour\n\n0.3%\n\n1 - 4 hours\n\n3.3%\n\n5 - 8 hours\n\n30.6%\n\n9 - 12 hours\n\n52.7%\n\nOver 12 hours\n\n13.2%\n\n72,133 responses\n\nOur respondents include people who code as professionals, students, and hobbyists.

Erlang and Scala developers in the US are among the highest paid, while Clojure, Erlang, and Haskell developers earn the most in India.\n\nCorrelated-Technologies Correlated Technologies\n\nHow Technologies Are Connected\n\nTechnologies cluster together into related ecosystems that tend to be used by the same developers. In this chart we see a large central cluster for web development (with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) connected via SQL to one for Microsoft technologies (with C#, Visual Studio, and .NET Core). Along the left we see a constellation connecting Java, Android, and iOS across to Linux, bash/shell, and Python. Other smaller correlated clusters include Scala/Spark, C/C++, and other smaller technologies that include language-specific IDEs.\n\nWhat Do Developers Think Is Dangerous and Exciting About AI?\n\nAlgorithms making important decisions\n\n28.6%\n\nArtificial intelligence surpassing human intelligence (\"the singularity\")\n\n28.0%\n\nEvolving definitions of \"fairness\" in algorithmic versus human decisions\n\n23.7%\n\nIncreasing automation of jobs\n\n19.8%\n\n63,115 responses\n\nIncreasing automation of jobs\n\n40.8%\n\nAlgorithms making important decisions\n\n23.5%\n\nArtificial intelligence surpassing human intelligence (\"the singularity\")\n\n23.3%\n\nEvolving definitions of \"fairness\" in algorithmic versus human decisions\n\n12.4%\n\n65,367 responses\n\nSome types of developers are involved in the increasing role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world today, so we asked developers what they think is dangerous and exciting about these technologies. There is not much consensus among developers about what is most dangerous; each answer was chosen roughly equally. The top choice for what is exciting about increasing AI is that jobs can be automated.\n\nWho is Primarily Responsible for Considering the Ramifications of AI?\n\nThe developers or the people creating the AI\n\n47.8%\n\nA governmental or other regulatory body\n\n27.9%\n\nProminent industry leaders\n\n16.6%\n\nNobody\n\n7.7%\n\n65,553 responses\n\nDevelopers are most likely to think that the creators and technologists behind the machine learning and AI algorithms are the ones who are ultimately most responsible for the societal issues surrounding artificial intelligence.

For example, data scientists are 1.5 times more likely to consider issues around algorithmic fairness dangerous than any upcoming singularity when computers become more intelligent than people, the most of any kind of developer. We included a free response option on this question; there was not much serious worry about Skynet, but many developers discussed systemic bias being built into algorithmic decision making and the danger of AI being used without the ability to inspect and reason about decision pathways.\n\nemployment Employment\n\nEmployment Status\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n74.0%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n9.7%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n6.1%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n5.6%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n4.3%\n\nRetired\n\n0.2%\n\n95,321 responses\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n76.9%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n10.0%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n5.1%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n5.0%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n2.8%\n\nRetired\n\n0.2%\n\n86,447 responses\n\nOver 90% of developers are employed at least part-time.\n\nEmployment Status by Geography\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n80.4%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n6.6%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n4.8%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n4.4%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n3.6%\n\nRetired\n\n0.4%\n\n19,948 responses\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n78.7%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n9.3%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n6.2%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n3.8%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n2.0%\n\nRetired\n\n0.0%\n\n13,025 responses\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n78.0%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n11.6%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n4.4%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n3.2%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n2.4%\n\nRetired\n\n0.5%\n\n6,652 responses\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n70.3%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n13.0%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n8.9%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n4.5%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n3.1%\n\nRetired\n\n0.2%\n\n6,236 responses\n\nEmployed full-time\n\n74.7%\n\nIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\n\n9.6%\n\nNot employed, but looking for work\n\n5.5%\n\nNot employed, and not looking for work\n\n5.1%\n\nEmployed part-time\n\n4.8%\n\nRetired\n\n0.3%\n\n3,314 responses\n\nGermany has an unusually high proportion of developers working part-time.

Overall, career satisfaction does not vary significantly by industry. However, current job satisfaction is significantly lower for developers working in financial services and IT. Career satisfaction is highest for older developers, with ages of 50 or higher, and those with 20, 30, or more years of professional experience. Job satisfaction, by contrast, is highest for developers between 35 and 44 years old.\n\nEthics Ethics\n\nWhat Would Developers Do If Asked to Write Code for an Unethical Purpose?\n\nNo\n\n58.5%\n\nDepends on what it is\n\n36.6%\n\nYes\n\n4.8%\n\n70,782 responses\n\nWhen posed with a hypothetical situation where they are asked to write code for a product or purpose that they consider clearly unethical, over half of our respondents say that they would not write such code.

The most common answer, from almost half of respondents, is that how to report an ethical problem depends on the particulars of any given situation.\n\nWho Is Ultimately Most Responsible for Code That Accomplishes Something Unethical?\n\nUpper management at the company/organization\n\n57.5%\n\nThe person who came up with the idea\n\n22.8%\n\nThe developer who wrote it\n\n19.7%\n\n64,540 responses\n\nMost developers feel that management is ultimately most accountable for unethical results of code. Just under 20% of respondents said that a developer who writes code used for unethical purposes is most responsible.\n\nDo Developers Have an Obligation to Consider the Ethical Implications of Their Code?\n\nYes\n\n79.6%\n\nUnsure / I don't know\n\n14.3%\n\nNo\n\n6.1%\n\n69,309 responses\n\nAlmost 80% of respondents affirm that considering what their code can be used for is the right thing for developers to do. Those who said they were unsure about this were 40% more likely to also say that they do not need to report any ethical problems.\n\nWe included a free response opportunity after this question, and we saw thoughtful reflections from developers. These include responses about how the tools developers build are powerful and come with a lot of responsibility, situations where unethical outcomes may accidentally arise, and how large teams are involved in building software but developers can be the last line of defense against unethical code.\n\nJob Search Status\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n59.8%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n24.3%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n15.9%\n\n79,488 responses\n\nOnly 16% of respondents are actively looking for a job, but about three-fourths of developers are interested in hearing about new job opportunities.\n\nJob Search Status by Geography\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n56.4%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n29.4%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n14.2%\n\n17,706 responses\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n58.5%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n30.7%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n10.8%\n\n9,886 responses\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n55.9%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n33.1%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n11.0%\n\n5,812 responses\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n58.0%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n31.3%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n10.7%\n\n5,317 responses\n\nI’m not actively looking, but I am open to new opportunities\n\n61.4%\n\nI am not interested in new job opportunities\n\n26.4%\n\nI am actively looking for a job\n\n12.2%\n\n2,881 responses\n\nJob seeking status is largely consistent across these regions.\n\nWho's Actively Looking for a Job?\n\nEducator or academic researcher\n\n18.5%\n\nMobile developer\n\n18.1%\n\nData scientist or machine learning specialist\n\n18.0%\n\nData or business analyst\n\n17.9%\n\nGame or graphics developer\n\n17.9%\n\nDesigner\n\n17.7%\n\nFront-end developer\n\n16.0%\n\nDatabase administrator\n\n15.6%\n\nBack-end developer\n\n15.4%\n\nQA or test developer\n\n15.3%\n\nFull-stack developer\n\n15.2%\n\nEmbedded applications or devices developer\n\n14.8%\n\nSystem administrator\n\n14.5%\n\nDesktop or enterprise applications developer\n\n14.4%\n\nEngineering manager\n\n13.6%\n\nDevOps specialist\n\n13.5%\n\nProduct manager\n\n13.0%\n\nC-suite executive (CEO, CTO, etc.)\n\n12.0%\n\nMean of 76,354 responses\n\nAmong professional developers, those who work at the C-level and as engineering managers or product managers are looking for work the least.

See our Methodology section for information on how we converted local currencies used by respondents to U.S. dollars.\n\nAverage top earners vary by geography. In India, for example, data scientists are among the top earners, while in European countries, back-end developers and developers working with embedded devices are among the top earners.\n\nSalary and Experience by Developer Type\n\nNaturally, developers with more years of experience are paid more. However, we also see that some type of coding work is paid more highly at the same level of experience. Data scientists and DevOps specialists are high earners for their level of experience.\n\nSalary and Experience by Language\n\nDevelopers using languages that appear above the line in this chart, such as Go, Clojure, and F#, are being paid more even given how much experience they have. Developers using languages below the line, like PHP and Visual Basic 6, however, are paid less even given years of experience. The size of the circles in this chart represents how many developers are using that language compared to the others.\n\nhire\n\nLooking to hire developers?

Developers were largely positive about Stack Overflow, focusing on the helpful nature of the community, and specifically had ideas about how questions, answers, comments, and reputation are handled. The treatment of new users and new people in our community were mentioned often as well.\n\nDevelopers' Perspectives About Our Community\n\nThis year, our survey included questions about what developers think the best, worst, most annoying, and most exciting things about Stack Overflow are. (These questions were randomized so that each respondent got one positive and one negative version.) In the positive versions of these questions, respondents were more likely to talk about the wealth of sharing and collaboration on our site. In the negative versions, respondents reflected on harsh interactions they've witnessed, downvotes, and handling of duplicate questions.\n\nenterprise_teams\n\nLooking for a place for you and your technical team to ask and answer questions in a secure environment?
