While Rackable won’t announce detailed plans until after the bankruptcy process is concluded, he says he fully expects to keep supporting most of SGI’s products. He wouldn’t comment on whether the once-beloved Silicon Graphics name would live on.\n\nSo why buy the world’s sickest computer company, in the middle of what looks to be the worst downturn in computer history? He says that as the economy worsened, he became convinced that Rackable needed to make a move to spark future revenue growth. While Rackable specializes in more commoditized servers used in Internet data centers, SGI sells extremely powerful machines in the so-called high-performance computing market. So rather than sell primarily to the likes of Microsoft and Amazon (who between them were about half the company’s sales last year), Rackable can now sell to the world’s rocket scientists, actual and figurative—defense and intelligence agencies, national labs and other customers who can never get enough compute power. “Our products help power the Internet. Their products help design race cars,” he says. “Together, we’d be positioned to solve the most demanding business and technology challenges there are. This will help us grow beyond the crowd.”"
