I wanted to buy an SGI Indy, but at that time the computer was way too expensive for a start up. The decision was made to buy a second hand Indigo R3000 instead. This SGI computer has been used for several years by me for web application development, using Perl, the Apache web server, mySQL and C.\n\nA few years later I was able to buy more second hand SGI workstations: a few Indy workstations and even an O2.\n\nIndy R4600 PC\n\nSGI Iris Indigo R3000\n\nLinks"
