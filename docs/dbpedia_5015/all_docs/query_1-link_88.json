        "text": "National Center For Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)\n\n(1985 to present)\n\nFounded in 1985 by Nancy St,John & Craig Upston (Co- Managers). Located at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Pioneering Scientific Visualization software projects that created tools that scientists themselves could use. Stefen Fangmeier (ILM) was a TD from 19?? To ??.\n\nNew York Institute of Technology (NYIT)\n\nIn 1974 Dr. Alexander Schure, a wealthy entrepreneur, began to assemble the Computer Graphics Laboratory (CGL) at the New York Institute of Technology. His vision was to create a feature length animated film, with the aid of the days most sophisticated computer graphics techniques. NYIT itself was founded by Dr. Schure, had grounds encompassing numerous estates situated in the beautiful wooded hillsides of Old Westbury New York. Some of these estates were owned by members of the Rockafeller family, who also happened to have a seat on the board of Evans & Sutherland. Because of the close association of E&S with the University of Utah, Dave Evans recommended to Alex to seek out Edwin Catmull to head the new CGL. Ed Catmull had just finished his Ph.D. at Utah and taken a job at a CAD/CAM company called Applicon. It was not a hard sell to get Ed to leave Applicon for NYIT however, so he and fellow Utah graduate Malcolm Blanchard packed their bags for New York. Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco (both fresh from Xerox PARC) joined the team a few months later in what was called the ³Gerry Mansion². Alvy and David had heard of Dr. Schure¹s plans from Martin Newell at Utah (whom Alex had just hired briefly as a consultant). Dr. Schure had recently come through Utah and literally ordered ³one of everything² to jump start his NYIT project. Some of this equipment included a DEC PDP-11, a new E&S LDS-1 and the first random access frame buffer also from E&S. Later, the CGL group would also receive the very first commercial VAX. [SIDEBAR] VAX ALMOST SMASHED! In fact, the VAX almost never made it inside the building, if not for Alvy Ray Smith¹s quick actions. It seems that when the computer was just lowered off the back of the delivery truck, another truck parked behind and uphill had it¹s brakes slip, which started it rolling towards the brand new machine. Alvy quickly jumped in the driver-less truck and stopped it just before it could smash the VAX back into the very truck it was just unloaded from. The CGL quickly attracted other technology experts and artists, including Christy Barton(from E&S), Tom Duff, Lance Williams, Fred Parke, Garland Stern, Ralph Guggenheim, Ed Emshwiller, and many others. Throughout the 1970s, the people of the CGL thrived in a pioneering spirit, creating milestones in many areas of graphic software. Many of the ³firsts² that happened at NYIT were based on the development of the first RGB full color (24bit) raster graphics. A few of the more notable ³firsts²: First RGB anything (because they had the first RGB framebuffers in the world). First RGB paint program (Paint by Alvy Ray Smith). First soft-edged fill (Alvy Ray again). First computer-controlled video editing. First TV commercial with raster graphics (Lance, I think, or maybe it was Ephraim Cohen). First pixel dissolve. First networked computer system (Christy rolled our own for us). The alpha channel is invented by Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith. First hidden surface algorithm within a pixel (Ed). Lance Williams invented mipmapping (texture mapping is still done this way today). Garland Stern implemented the first scan and paint system (this is how the Disney/Pixar CAPS system now makes 2D animation - different system but same idea). The atmosphere at the CGL was also very open, with many invited tours coming through the lab all year-round. Other universities like Cornell, and companies such as Quantel were among those to visit and take notes about what was being developed. The personnel structure was virtually non- existent, with never any heavy handed management from Dr. Catmull. People did what they were best at and helped each other out whenever needed. [Strangest Job Title ever!] Alvy Ray Smith would later accidently come across an organization chart for the lab put together by Dr. Shure. Ed Catmull was running the lab of course but there where people listed above and below him that no one had even heard of. Alvy was particularly amused to find that his official title was ³Information Quanta². A term very much in keeping with Dr. Shure¹s somewht unique, and non-standard form of communicating. Ed Catmull¹s Tween, Alvy Ray Smith¹s Paint program, and the 2D animation program SoftCel, all were in keeping with the original charter of the CGL, which was 2D CG. There were also many breakthroughs in image techniques involving fractals, morphing, image compositing, and Mip-Map texture mapping and many others. Key to this pioneering effort was the seemingly unlimited financing evidenced by Alex Schure. One such example took place when Alvy Ray Smith spoke with Alex about how good it might be to have not just the one, but three frame buffers. This way, Alvy explained, the three 8bit buffers could be combined to create the first RGB color frame buffer ever! Sometime later Alex not only delivered the two additional frame buffers, but an additional 3, which gave the CGL team a grand total of 6. (³Enough for two of those RGB things² said Alex.) At $60,000 each (plus the $80,000 for the first) what this meant in today¹s dollars was that on a simple request, Alex had just delivered about $2million worth of equipment. More Utah people joined the CGL, including Garland Stern who would write the vector animation system BBOP. David DiFrancesco would also begin what would be turn out to be a long association with film recording at this time. Jim Blinn even worked at the CGL as a summer intern in 1976. [SIDEBAR] TUBY THE TUBA! At this same time as the CGL was up and running, Alex had about 100 traditional animators working on a film called ³Tuby The Tuba². Unfortunately, after two years when the film finally screened, everyone¹s worst fears were realizedit was worse than awful. Several different department also existed at NYIT by now, in different neighboring mansions; an audio group, a video/post production lab, and a computer science department as well. One project that was successfully completed, was a half hour video (2² with a single frame recorder) called ³Measure for Measure², which combined conventional cel animation with TWEEN imagery. In 1979 when Ed Catmull left to start the Computer Graphics Division at Lucasfilm, many wanted to come with him. In fact, Alvy, Tom Duff, and David DiFrancesco all left and went elsewhere while waiting to join Ed in California when the time was right. Ralph had promised to stay at NYIT a full year, and he honored that commitment, even turning down an offer from Alex Schure to head the CGL group so that he would be free to leave one that year was up. A New York City commercial office was also established to market and sell the technology developed in Old Westbury. Known as CGL Inc. CGL Inc. also produced numerous commercial graphics jobs for the broadcast market. The WORKS (The remaining historical text for NTIT/CGL was contributed by Paul Heckbert) Shortly after Catmull left NYIT, Alex's son, Louis Schure, became lab director. At about the same time, the NYIT lab began preparing to make the first three-dimensional computer animated movie, to be called \"The Works\". Its science fiction screenplay was written by Lance Williams. A number of people were hired to work on the project. The principal robot designers and modelers were Lance, Bill Maher, Dick Lundin (designer of the famous robot ant), Ned Greene, and Carter Burwell. Some of the animators were Rebecca Allen and Amber Denker. [THE WORKS!] A great deal of effort at NYIT went into the development of the film \"The Works\", which was written by Lance Williams and worked on from about 1979 to 1986. For many reasons, including a lack of film-making expertise, it was never completed. Sequences from the work in progress still stand as some of the most astounding animated imagery of the time. Software development during the early 80's was guided by Lance Williams, Paul Heckbert, Fred Parke, and Pat Hanrahan. A number of excellent graphics software developers did pioneering work there during those years: Jim Blinn and Tom Duff (MAT: yacc-based modeling language), Jim Clark (E&S Picture system library from the 70's; Jim later went on to found Silicon Graphics and Netscape), Lance Williams (z-buffer and texture mapping techniques), Tom Duff (SOID: z-buffered quadric surface rendering with texture mapping, bump mapping), Garland Stern (BBOP: interactive keyframe animation system), Dick Lundin (dynamics simulation and robot modeling and animation tools), Ephraim Cohen (ZOOM: filtered image resampling and EPT: paint program), Thad Beier (SSOID: CSG on quadric surfaces), Mike Chou (SOID's environment mapping), Frank Crow, Andrew Glassner, and Tom Shermer (antialiased line drawing), Robert McDermott (geometric modeling tools), John Schlag (image processing software), Paul Heckbert (POLY: z-buffered polygon renderer with texture mapping), Paul Heckbert and Pat Hanrahan (beam tracing), Paul Heckbert (early splatting, a form of volume rendering), Lance Williams and Ned Greene (mesh modeling tools), Lance Williams, Fred Parke, and Paul Heckbert (face modeling and animation), John Lewis and Peter Oppenheimer (fractal modeling), Ned Greene and Paul Heckbert (z-buffer rendering for fisheye projection), Ned Greene (sky modeling from photographs), Jules Bloomenthal and Lance Williams (DEKINK: antialiasing, recording tools), Jules Bloomenthal (realistic tree modeling), Kevin Hunter (early marching cubes), Pat Hanrahan (EM: interactive modeling system), Pat Hanrahan (winged edge library), David Sturman (animation database and tools), Lance Williams and Paul Heckbert (Coons image warp), Tom Brigham (image morphing), Tracy Petersen, Mike Kowalski, and Carter Burwell (audio synthesis), and many other amazing graphics hackers and graphics hacks. The workhorse hardware during the early 80's was six DEC VAX 11/780's as main computers, about three E&S Picture System II's for animation preview, about eight E&S and Genisco frame buffers for 512x486x24-bit raster graphics, about six programmable Ikonas graphics processors, the largest with 12 megabytes of image memory (an ungodly amount in that day: 2048x2048x24-bits), viewed with rare thousand line color monitors, several IVC 2000 2\" videotape recorders, and a Dicomed film recorder. Although The Works was never completed (the group was ahead of its time; it wasn't until 1995 that the first 3-D computer animated movie -- Toy Story -- came out), some major milestones of computer animation came out of the effort, including: The Works Trailer - hit of the SIGGRAPH '82 film show, 3DV, Inside a Quark, and segments for the 1984 Omnimax movie \"The Magic Egg\". The lab's animation demonstrated the first extensive use of texture mapping and environment mapping in animation, and some of the first 3-D character animation. Some pictures from the early 80's are available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/nyit After this peak, the party began to wind down in the mid and late 80's: Bloomenthal left for Xerox PARC in 1985, Heckbert left for PDI and Pixar in 1985, Hanrahan left for Wisconsin, DEC, and Pixar in 1985, and Williams left for Apple in 1986. The dispersal of its lab members helped spread NYIT's ideas to many other sites. [FACTOID] Many people regarded the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab of the late 70's and early 80's as the top computer graphics research and development group in the world.\n\nOhio State University\n\n-Charles A. Csuri In 1963 Charles Csuri joined OSU as a Professor in the Department of Art. A former All-American football player and painter, he soon became interested in the computer as an aid in creating new forms of art and animation. By 1967, with the assistance of a fellow faculty member from the Department of Mathematics (and a mainframe computer) Csuri created several interpolated line drawing sequences, including one of a hummingbird in flight. Csuri produced over 14,000 frames, which exploded the bird, scattered it about, and reconstructed it. These frames were output to 16mm film, and the resulting film Hummingbird was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in 1968 for its permanent collection as representative of one of the first computer animated artworks.\n\n-The CGRG Beginning with a National Science Foundation grant for $100,000 in 1969, The Computer Graphics Research Group (CGRG) began working with a PDP 11/45 minicomputer and Vector General Display. The CGRG was truly multi-disiplined, included faculty and graduate students from Art, Industrial Design, Photography and Cinema, Computer and Information Science, and Mathematics. Additional grants from the Air Force Office For Scientific Research and the Navy continued the center until 1990, working in that time on two dozen different research projects worth about eight million dollars in research support. The CGRG projects specialized in computer animation languages, geometric and terrain modeling, motion control, and realtime playback systems.\n\n-Animation Systems Early animation language projects focused on a new concept of ³user friendly-ness² termed ³habitability² by Tom DeFanti. This was promoted as an interface to the real-time systems consisting of dials and joysticks.\n\nGRASS (Graphics Symbiosis System) animation programming language by Tom DeFanti in 1972. ANIMA motion language by Manfred Knemeyer in 1973. ANIMA II was developed with contributions from Ron Hackathorn, Alan Myers, Richard Parent and Tim Van Hook. TWIXT was designed by Julian Gomez as a ³track-based keyframe animation system².\n\n[MORPHING Factoid] Mark Gillenson (now at IBM) developed a technique of blending images of facial drawings, one of the earliest examples of the now familiar technology called morphing.\n\n-Other important developments Procedural animation was also developed in the late 70s by Wayne Carlson, Bob Marshall and Rodger Wilson. Frank Crow arrived from the University of Texas and continued his work with shadows and antialiasing that were started at the University of Utah. He later went to Xerox PARC.\n\n-Character Animation A great many individuals at Ohio created award winning character based short animations; including Tuber¹s Two Step by Chris (Blue Sky) Wedge and Snoot and Muttly by Susan Van Baerle and Doug Kingsbury.\n\n-Cranston/Csuri Productions Inc. In 1981, Chuck Csuri approached investor Robert Kanuth of The Cranston Companies to form a production company based on the great array of custom software written at the CGRG. Mark Howard designed and built a frame buffer which was used extensively for realtime animation testing at the CGRG and Cranston/Csuri Productions until they went out of business in 1987.\n\n-The ACCAD In 1987 Chuck Csuri and Tom Linehan (now President of Ringling School of Design) converted the Computer Graphics Research Group into The Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD). Also in the late 1980s, Scott Dyer(Windlight Co-founder, now at Nelvana) and a group of ACCAD personnel connected with The new Ohio Supercomputer Center for the purpose of developing flexible software solutions in the burgeoning field of scientific visualization.\n\n-Alumni works\n\nFor a more complete listing of CGRG, Cranston/Csuri and ACCAD alumni and their work, please visit these web sites:\n\nhttp://www.cgrg.ohio- state.edu/accad/people/alumni.html http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/accad/research/ http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/accad/gallery/films.html\n\nWayne Carlson has been Director of the ACCAD since 19?? Charles A. ³Chuck² Csuri is currently the Director and Professor, Emeritus of the Departments of Art, Art Education and Computer and Information Science at Ohio State University.\n\n-footnote: Excerpted with permission from ³A Short History of ACCAD²: by Wayne Carlson.\n\nOmnibus Computer Graphics Inc.\n\n(1982-1987)\n\nThe Omnibus Group Inc. began as a Canadian group of companies in marketing and communication founded in London, Ontario in 1972. It expanded with affiliated and shareholding offices in Toronto (Omnibus Video Inc.), Los Angeles (Image West Limited & Downstream-Keyer Inc.), and Sydney Australia (The Picture Company). John C. Pennie joined in 1974 as President. Image West was developed by Omnibus beginning in 1975 located in Hollywood, CA. (see below for the Image West company entry for more details.) Omnibus Video Inc. began in 1981 and was headed by President Jack Porter (Who for 14 years was president of Sheridan College in Toronto.), located in the Yonge-Eglinton area of Toronto, Canada. The NYIT TWEEN system was acquired and used by animator Robert Marinac (Now a CG Supervisor at ILM), one of nine employees at the time.\n\n[Robert¹s NYIT story picking up the machine?] TERRENCE: actually, they never picked up the machine, but I had to return the original RK05 disk pack to prove that we have wiped the software. No search was made for backups (duh) but by that time the s/w was pretty much unusable anyway.\n\nOmnibus Computer Graphics Inc. began in early 1982 with W.Kelly Jarmain as Chairman and J.C.Pennie as President and CEO. In 1983 they installed a VAX 11/750 and produced the first CG commercial in Canada. In 1983 an IPO (which raised $4.2 million) made Omnibus the first publically traded CG company. The plan was to expand and operate three main facilities: Toronto, New York and Los Angeles. The original Toronto location was for computer operations and the Canadian broadcast and agency work. Its Production group was run by Dan Philips (now head of CG production at DreamWorks). The New York facility, for video broadcast and recording, was on 57th street West under a lease from Unitel Video Inc. The Los Angeles location was intended primarily for motion picture film work; all linked by satellite by the end of 1984. (The satellite link amounted to modems for many months, and finally a WAN that was painfully slow and unreliable.) As part of the initial expansion in mid 1984, several larger VAX 11/780 systems were installed at the Toronto facility. [FACTOID] Kevin Tureski relates his first day on the job at Omnibus in Toronto: ³I remember walking in past reception to where the animators worked. There was Eric Ladd hunched over a massive drafting table. He was digitizing, by hand, the x,y and z coordinates of a horse. Someone had drawn about 5 sectional slices of a horse on 4 foot by 3 foot graph paper, one slice per paper. Eric was calculating the x,y values from the grid and writing down the coordinates down on a piece of paper, later typing them in, manually creating several .ppt files. There was no digitizing tablet to be found anywhere. Later, on a tour of the edit suite, I saw Mike Johnson feeding paper tape containing the boot program through the ESS a still store capable of holding 30 seconds of video on it¹s RK05 disks.² Now majority owned by Santa Clara-based Ramtek, Omnibus/LA hired David Sieg from Image West as VP of R&D and a team of programmers from CalTech, working with Al Barr, Brian Von Herzen, and many others. In addition to developing their own software (called PRISMS), Omnibus obtained ³several exclusive software license agreements² with Robert Abel & Associates and Triple-I. (The deal with Abel was originally signed to last seven years, the Triple-I deal until the year 2001.) To start up the Omnibus/LA facility, they bought the F1 computer system and older film printers (called PFR's) from Triple-I (Triple-I had just shut down their CG group.) and started working out of the Triple-I offices in Culver City. Omnibus/LA soon moved to the Paramount Studios Lot in Hollywood, sharing facilities with Unitel Video. Art Durinski was hired as Creative Director and staffed the initial dozen employees, which included a number of student from UCLA where he had been teaching. Star Trek III The first feature film contract Omnibus worked on was for Paramount Pictures Star Trek III. Omnibus (one of three companies to contribute) created a number of video graphic displays seen on the bridge of the Enterprise and Klingon starships. About 30 to 40 computer generated video clips comprised almost an hours worth of imagery. Artists included Technical Director Dan Krech and animator Dan Philips. Jeff Kleiser came on board the LA office as Director of the Motion Picture Special Effects division and directed animation for Flight of the Navigator and the original Captain Power pilot for Landmark. [THE FIRST D.O.A. DOMINO TIPS] The Captain Power project was meant to save Digital Productions from bankruptcy, but when Jeff brought the project to Omnibus instead, DP was forced to sell out. The rest, as they say, is history. Flight of the Navigator showcased the first feature film use of 3D morphing and animated texture mapping. (Environmental film footage was transferred to video, digitized and used to simulate the chrome surface of the spaceship.) Explorers would require a dream sequence illustrating a fly-over of a city represented by a 3D CG circuit board. Without the capability to render different colored vector graphics, Art Durinski designed the effect to be output in multiple black and white layers, each of which was filmed out and optically colored ad composited at Industrial Light and Magic. (ILM was the primary traditional effects house on the movie.) Bob Hoffman coded and animated on both Navigator and Explorers. DOA In June of 1986, Omnibus bought Digital Productions, having been approached by their majority owner Control Data who was desperate to get out from under the increasing debt of DP. In September of that same year Omnibus also bought Robert Abel and Associates for $7.3 million. Abel¹s likewise was on the verge of bankruptcy, and was led to believe Omnibus was a legitimate bid from a publicly held and stable company. The management at Omnibus saw the purchases as a way to consolidate all the best of everything, (and all their customers) into a single monolithic parent company. Unfortunately nothing was as it appeared, as everyone was soon to find out. Gary Demos and John Whitney Jr. had no choice but to leave Digital Production when their contract agreement with Control Data was violated by the sale to Omnibus. They both left to form Whitney/Demos. Art Durinski was privy to the financial state of the recent deals early on and decided to leave the company and go to Toyo/Links in Japan.\n\n[SIDEBAR QUOTE] ³The Omnibus management knew nothing about computer animation, but kept muttering about \"Economies of Scale\". The reality was: three separate sales forces, three separate production crews, three separate facilities, philosophies, software systems and hardware systems, none of which were likely to ever work together. What is ironic is that the next Star Trek movie was about to go into production, and had tons of CGI work in it. We had good contacts with the right people, and we did some amazing tests (I have videotape!) of the Enterprise that blew the modelmakers away. But they were too scared Omnibus would go under to give us the contract that would have saved us.² ­David Sieg dave@ns.zfx.com\n\nDiana Walczak began working on human figure tests for Marvel Comics, and Jeff Kleiser was in Vancouver Canada scouting locations for the film Millennium when the end came. In early 1987, with a debt of $30million, Omnibus defaulted on investments and closed Abel, DP and Omnibus on April 13th, 1987.\n\n[QUOTE] ³Auctions were held for the remainder of the equipment, including people's desks with papers still in them. I bought an Ikonas framebuffer for $50 that had been bought eighteen months earlier for $35,000. I still have it today. It still works.² ­David Sieg\n\nPresident John Pennie later headed The Virtual Reality Company, until it went under in 1993. Kim Davidson and Greg Hermanovic purchased the rights to the PRISMS source code and started Side Effects Productions, which later became Side Effects Software. Kevin Tureski went to Alias and was Director of Engineering for PowerAnimator from its inception, and is now responsible for various bits and pieces of Maya. There was also an Omnibus Japan that still exists today, and uses the 3-D Omnibus orb logo.\n\nOptoMystic\n\n(1988 to 19??)\n\nFormed by John Whitney Jr. after Whitney/Demos declared bankruptcy in 1988. It used one of the first Connection Machines, and did some work with Karl Simms and Jerry Weil around the era of \"PanSpermia\".\n\nPacific Data Images (PDI)\n\n(1980 to present)\n\nIncorporated on August 11th 1980 by Carl Rosendahl, originally in a small office in Los Altos. Carl grew up in LA, and graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford in 1979. Wanting to combine entertainment with his technical experience, computer graphics seemed a natural solution. Times begin what they were (so early in the CG evolution), Carl formed his own company rather than seeking employment at one of a very few established companies. Richard Chuang and Glenn Entiss made it a company of three in 1982. Later, after moving to one Sunnyvale industrial complex until 1984, PDI moved into another larger building owned by Carl¹s father. They remained their until moving to their present location in Palo Alto in 1997. PDI has grown from employing less than 20 people in about 1984, to over 300 total today. The first PDP-11/44 was used for much of the original proprietary code written by Richard and Glenn (and Carl too.) Richard concentrated on the renderer, and later on lighting tools. A DeAnza frame buffer also was used early on. The very first jobs were doing broadcast graphics for Jose Diaz of Brazilian Globo Television. Globo actually lent a more powerful VAX computer to PDI for a year, and in return licensed a sub-set of the PDI code for their own production. Many early commercial jobs that kept the company busy were also from the Harry Marks creative agency. By the late 1980s PDI was using RIDGE Unix workstations (similar to Solarity) and controlled about 60% of the high- end commercial broadcast market. Clients included virtually every network and cable channel along with hundreds of affiliate local stations. From the very beginning it was clear that PDI (and Carl in particular) had a uniquely keen business savy that enabled the company to thrive through a time when CG company bankruptcies were otherwise the norm. At least two key strategies were instrumental to PDIs continued financial success. Firstly, unlike most companies that were going heavily into debt to finance ³glamorous² feature film work, PDI concentrated through the 1980s on the lucrative commercial market. It was an easy transition to build on their early reputation in broadcast graphics work. The second important factor in keeping the books in the black was the wise decision to purchase and use ³last years² models of computer equipment, and to depreciate it in just a few short years. It was also at this time (1989/90) that Carl and Tim Johnson began to visit the Hollywood Studios to try and begin a dialog about creative content partnerships. It was a proactive decision to what they saw was a future trend of CG as a commodity, possibly limiting the uniqueness of what PDI might have to offer in the future. As would be expected, the studios were much less forward thinking and no deals came to pass. In 1990 PDI did however open a feature film production office in LA for work on their first film project; the Japanese funded ³Solar Crisis². New equipment included a film scanner built by non-other than Les Dittert, and a Management Graphics film recorder. (The effects work was optically composited.) Soon after that PDI got a big break with some lesser known but still important work on Terminator2: Judgement Day. PDI did a number of different ³invisible² effects such as wire removal and digital plate reconstruction. Work continued on many other features, including the several Batman films. In 1994 PDI closed the LA office, with several key employees (including Jamie Dixon and Thad Bier) staying to form HammerHead. Meanwhile back at home base in Sunnyvale, PDI was continuing to set new standard in broadcast commercial CG techniques. In 1991/92 the technique of ³morfing² was used with great success on numerous projects. The first was a Plymouth Voyager commercial, followed soon by the Exxon tiger, and the famous Michael Jackson video ³Black or White². A perfect subject, perfectly executed, the Black and White video only served to increase the demand for this new technology in broadcast work. Along with the strong 2D effects work being produced, PDI also began very early to experiment and create 3D character animation. Waldo, the first ever 3D CG realtime animated ³muppet², was created for the Jim Henson Hour in 1988. (See the Milestones Chapter for more details.) Crest Toothpaste ³Singers² (88) and Scrubbing bubbles (89) were followed by the Last Halloween television special in 1991. (Based in the M&M Mars candy commercial campaign started by ILM). In 1994 PDI broke a long standing stop motion tradition by introducing a 3D CG Pillsbury DoughBoy with the ³Mambo² spot. The doughboy would in fact continue to be created by PDI for another four years. Gradually more subtle enhancements crept into the spots, including motion blur, which was originally intentionally left out to more closely resemble the look of stop motion animation. 1995 saw Carl knocking on Hollywood Studio doors again, this time (in March, 1996) resulting in PDI signing a co- production deal with DreamWorks to create original, computer- animated feature films. Antz, of course, was the first of the films to be produced under this deal. Shrek is in production now for a late 2000 release, to be followed by Tusker, probably in 2002.\n\n[PDI SHORTS] PDI has a always went beyond pure commercialism with its support of short animated films for their own sake. Some of the earliest memorable SIGGRAPH clips featured the ³Happy Drinking Birds², Chromosaurs, Opera Industrial, Cosmic Zoom, Burning Love, Max¹s Place, Locomotion, Gas Planet. Recent shorts are no exception in Gabola the Great and Sleepy Guy. Their next short Fat Cat is due out soon.\n\nOther fun projects have included the long running Bud Bowl half time series and The Simpsons 3D episode. In 1998 Richard Chung, Glenn Entis and Carl Rosenthal werer awarded a Scientific and Technical Achievement Award for the concept and architecture of the PDI Animation System. Employees included Thad Bier(Hammerhead), Scott Anderson (ILM, Sony). Carl and Richard are still with PDI, while Glenn Entis left PDI to become President of Dreamworks Interactive. www.pdi.com\n\nPixar\n\n(1986-present)\n\nPixar was formed in 1986 when Steven Jobs (of Apple and NeXT computer fame) purchased the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Division from George Lucas. George had decided about a year before that he did not wish to continue a hardware development effort in-house, and also did not at that time want to pursue computer generated animation (as did the employees). He therefore agreed to allow Edwin Catmull, Alvy Ray Smith and the rest of the employees of the Graphics Group to seek out investors so that they could spin off into their own company. Many different options were explored over the course of that year, and in the end the negotiations went down to the very last minute with the outcome not always certain. The deal that was finally made called for $5 million dollars to purchase the division with an additional $5 million for immediate capital investment. Founding members included (in alphabetical order): Tony Apodaca, Loren Carpenter, Ed Catmull, Rob Cook, David DeFrancesco, Tom Duff, Craig Good, Ralph Guggenheim, Pat Hanrahan, Sam Lefler, Darwyn Peachey, Tom Porter, Eben Ostby, Bill Reeves, Alvy Ray Smith, Rodney Stock. [SIDEBAR STORY] The story of how Pixar got its name: It was 1981 and the Computer Graphics Group at Lucasfilm was developing the hardware and software for a digital imaging ³scanning/manipulating/filming computer-machine². David DiFrancesco was hardware, Loren Carpenter was software and Alvy Ray Smith managed the project. When it came time to write up a formal proposal about the new device, it seemed appropriate to come up with a catchy name for the middle componant of the system, the computer that did the image processing between the scanning and the filming. One night over dinner (at ³Franks Country Garden² restaurant in Bel Marin Keys, CA) four men got around to discussing the topic of a name. Present were Rodney Stock (a hardware consultant), Jim Blinn (who worked at LucasFilm for a short time), Loren Carpenter and Alvy Ray Smith. Since the hope was for this clever device to actually ³make pictures², the name ³Picture Maker² was suggested. This was quickly rejected in favor of Alvy¹s suggested contraction of ³Pixer². Loren then made the suggestion to change it to ³Pixar² (it had a nicer ring to it) and the rest is history. Loren relates that there are occasionally some attempts to put a greater meaning to the word after the fact (such as ³Programmed Image transformation(X) And Render²) but hereinabove the true story is now told. Suddenly, the new company Pixar was no longer part of a larger profitable effects studio but rather a business all of its own. In the first few years the Pixar Image Computer sold well to a few (very different) client markets. Philips bought over 20 systems to use in the medical image processing market, while Disney made a significant partnership with Pixar to develop the graphics end of what would eventually become the CAPS system. Roy Disney himself wanted to get his company back into feature animation in the right way, and this was seen (wisely) as an investment in the future technology of 2D animation production. Ed Catmull and Pixar soon realized however that the 2D image processing power of the Image Computer was not a money maker, and indeed its days were numbered because of the ever increasing power and low cost of new general purpose PCs. Ed chose however not to drop the hardware development business right away, mainly because the CAPS deal with Disney was entirely based on the Pixar Image Computer and he did not want to leave them ³high and dry². Ed also know it was only a matter of a short time before they could port the CAPS development to the new SGI platform, it was just a matter of waiting it out while they continued to loose money. Just then, Ed received a call from one of their chief competitors in the image processing market, a company called Vicom. Vicom was taking the position that in order to make that market more successful, all the competitors should join forces with one product. ³Would Pixar be willing to SELL their hardware outright to Vicom?² Ed: ³Let me think about that and get back to you on that² (Ed smiles to himself). Edwin happily sold the Pixar Imaging Computer hardware business to Vicom for $2 million, hoping that they could keep it as a viable product just long enough for the Disney CAPS system to transition over to SGI; which is exactly what happened. Pixar was still a struggling company, with small profit margins and occasional layoffs during particular hard times. It is a testament to the belief of the key partners and employees of Pixar that they hung on during the hard times without giving up their hope to make CG animated movies. John Lasseter himself turned down several offers from Disney to come back and direct a film for them. About this same time, 1990 or so, the commercial division was started to cut some teeth on real production experience. The Listerene, Life Savers and Tropicana spots immediately stood out as being in a creative class by themselves. Produced in conjunction with Colossal Pictures, they blended what was (and continues to be) Pixar¹s trademark realistic rendering ³look² with outstanding character animation and humor. It was at this time that Andrew Stanton and Pete Doctor joined the company as animators. The hope was to get the hang of commercial production and then step up to make a half our television short film based on Tinny from the Tin Toy short film. Then in 1991 Ed Catmull made the 3 picture deal with Disney to create fully CG animated films. Disney¹s point of view was that if Pixar was ready to commit to a half hour show, than doing an 85 minute feature film really shouldn¹t be that much of a stretch. (Yeh .sure!). The first film, to be called Toy Story was given a budget of only $17 million. While the final cost was considerably more than that, it was still however considerably LESS than the cost of a traditionally animated Disney feature film. [SIDEBAR TRIVIA] Toy Story was rendered with a render farm consisting of some 300 Sun computers, each roughly the processing power of one original Cray 1 Supercomputer (XX? MIPS). A Bugs Life used 1400 Sun computers, each with a processor upgrade that was 3 to 4 times faster than the ones used on Toy Story! Today, Pixar is overhauling the very foundations of their production environment: the Marionette animation software, Renderman, and their film recording. The software tool sets will be rebuilt from the ground-up into the next generation of animation and rendering software. David DiFransisco has culminated his twenty years of pioneering film recording technology knowledge into ³Pixar Vision². The new laser based recording system is meant to be the finest and fastest in the world, operating with 35mm, 65mm and Vista Vision film stocks at between 4 and 8 seconds a frame. The system was tested on Bugs, but should see full use on Pixar¹s next film, Toy Story II, due out in the fall of 1999. (Early problems with the ³Pixar Vision² laser film recorder were eventually tracked down to the air-conditioning system that keeps Pixar¹s vast render farm cool. The AC system was so large, that the vibrations caused the whole building to vibrate just enough to throw the delicate film recorder¹s quality off!) In 1998 Eben Ostby, Bill Reeves, Sam Leffler and Tom Duff were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award for the development of the Marionette Three- Dimensional Computer Animation System.

To present)\n\nProtozoa is a pioneering \"performance animation\" company that provides complete systems, production, and Web based animation content. Founder Brad deGraf (along with then partner Michael Wharman of Degraf/Wharman) created the first real-time character performance, Mike the Talking Head, at Siggraph 1988. Brad was also part of the team that Jim Henson contracted at Digital Productions in 1988 to digitize Kermit the Frog as the first attempt at . Protozoa and its founders have been leaders in the medium ever since. Moxy, the first ever live 3D character for television, was created and originally produced by Protozoa¹s founders while at Colossal Pictures in 1993 (and later by Turner Productions). Turner also licensed ALIVE, for the Cartoon Network. Ziff-Davis Television bought ALIVE and Dev Null (recent Emmy) from Protozoa to co-host The Site on MSNBC. They produced more than 20 minutes a week for a year, viewed by 55 million homes worldwide, making Dev easily the most widely seen virtual character in the world. Protozoa also created Floops, the first live 3D episodic cartoon, published twice weekly on the Web for over six months using VRML 2.0 (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). Floops won Best of Show at the 1997 VRML Excellence Awards. Others successful projects include: · Dilbert in 3D - 47 episodes in VRML, sponsored by Intel for their Mediadome website. · The BBC is has licensed ALIVE for production of a series in CQ2¹98. · MTV premiered Virtual Bill, the digital President, during the State of the Union address 1998 · Sinbad performs Soulman, his digital alter ego, live on his late night talk show, VIBE. · The Blue Man Group commissioned Protozoa to create Virtual Blue Man for live shows. · The Disney Channel commissioned a pilot, designed by Protozoa, for a series for 1998. The company has numerous international licensees (Germany (2), Spain (site license) Italy (site license), South Africa (2), Britain (2), a growing reseller/representative network, and a full sales pipeline. Protozoa is located in SanFransisco, CA. www.protozoa.com\n\nRezN8\n\n(1987 To present)\n\nFounded by Paul Sidlo and Evan Ricks. Paul Sidlo was Creative Director for Cranston/Csuri Productions from 1982 to 1987.\n\nRhythm and Hues\n\n(1987 to present)\n\nWhile working at Robert Abel¹s company, Randy Roberts suggested to John Hughes that they spin off a new company. Once the venture got going (as six people in John¹s living room with one SGI) Randy actually ended up Directing independently for a few years, ultimately joining R&H in 1993. Founded in a former dental office in Santa Monica by John Hughes, Charles Gibson, Pauline T¹So and Keith Goldfarb.(from Bob Abel¹s) along with Larry Wienberg and wife Cathy White from Omnibus. Other early employees included Frank Wuts, Cliff Boule and Peter Farson (from Digital Productions) Their very first job (on April 23rd, 1987) was a film project, to realize the MGM/UA logo for that studio. This was especially unusual at a time when virtually all the work was for broadcast television. The following years were spent creating many different commercial and logo projects, starting with their second job for a New Zealand station. 1990 saw some incredible breakthrough work for the feature film ³Flight of the Intruder². Remember at the time, the Abyss had just come out a year before and T2 was still a year away (1991). R&H created over 30 shots of photo- realistic aircraft, cluster bombs, and smoke in full daylight ..all with proprietary software. This was truly breakthrough work that unfortunately was not as recognized as it should have been when the film itself did poorly. With four out of the six original employees code writers, the in-house software effort had began from day one. Eventually four main components would be written: animation, modeling, rendering and compositing. Before all the code was production ready however, Wavefront software was used, based on an agreement John had made earlier with the company started by his former co-worker Bill Kovaks. While working at Bob Abel¹s on and off from 1976 to 1987, John had his own company called ³Motion Control Systems² (MCS) with partner Jim Keating. Jim at that time wrote the ³model² component of the Wavefront code, and in exchange for sole rights to that software Wavefront gave a number of licences to John¹s new company R&H. Bill Kovacs actually wrote his ³preview² code while consulting for John¹s earlier MCS company, but retained sole ownership of that software for himself. Rhythm and Hues¹ work on ³Babe² won an Academy Award best Visual Effects in 199? (VFX Supervised by Scott Anderson and VFX Produced by Nancy St.John.) In March of 1999 R&H bought the visual effects CG company VIFX (which was located just two blocks away in Hollywood). Richard Hollander¹s new position is as head of the film effects group, bringing some 80 of VIFX¹s employees with the purchase. Bill Kroyer has also recently joined the company as a Director, and Richard Taylor is there still today also. R&H in total now employs over 300 people.\n\nRobert Abel and Associates\n\n(1971-1987)\n\nTalk about CG history with anyone who¹s been in the biz for at least 10 years, and one name will inevitably come up very early in the conversation. In fact, Bob Abel¹s name itself is virtually synonymous with the pioneering early days of computer graphics. Talk to him yourself and you will quickly realize that this is a man to whom the tool is much less important than the creative result. Abel¹s introduction to new technology came at an early age, even in fact as a pre-teen in the 1950s. His uncle Earl Kanter, a World War II draftee and ³high IQ² Harvard student, began experimenting with electronics and early computers. This ³high-tech² childhood would set a foundation for things to soon come. In 1957 a young Abel was doing paste up work for the legendary Saul Bass. It was a trip that Abel made to one man¹s garage that would soon change his life. Saul was working on the opening titles to Hitchcock¹s ³Vertigo² with a man by the name of John Whitney. Whitney was using analog computers and homemade motion control rigs to create artwork of various kinds, and Abel got on very well with the older artist. So much so that Abel was hired as a graphics design consultant on one print job for Foodmaker, the parent company of Jack-In-The-Box. Abel would remain busy doing a great variety of things that would run the gamut from the realistic to the surreal. Abel would shoot an award winning documentary for David Wolper, spend a tour on Vietnam as a combat photographer, and contribute to multi-screen music festivals and rock concerts. All this would solidify in 1971 when that icon of advertising, Harry Marks, would provide Abel and his old friend Con Pederson with the opportunity to create a new look for ABC television. From 1971 to 1973, in 6000 square feet of vacant space behind and accountants office, the fledgling Robert Abel and Associates would begin to take shape. There was no phone, no sign on the building, no advertising and no secretary; just Abel, Con, an optical guy named Dick Alexander and a camera mannamed Dave Stuart.\n\nMajor projects included:  7up ³see the light² campaign  The ³Gold Series² for Benson and Hedges  Amazing Stories opening  The Randy Roberts designed \"Brilliance\" commercial for the Canned Food Council ( The \"Sexy Robot\" )\n\nLarry Cuba joined RAA for a short time at the start of 1976, hoping to program the new motion control computers, But left just four months later to create the famous DeathStar graphics for George Lucas¹ Star Wars film. Abel assembled a computer graphics team to work on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but the work which was eventually discontinued to be completed by Doug Trumbull and others with traditional effects techniques.\n\nAmong Abel¹s early associates were Richard Hollander, John Hughes, Richard Taylor and Wayne Kimall. By 1979 Abel¹s was a full service effects company with a miniature shop and 6 different motion control rigs to augment live action footage. A real breakthrough came when they wanted to have a way to preview motion control moves. To this end, Bill Kovacs was hired to modify an E&S realtime vector PS-2 flight simulation computer. A deal was made to acquire the source code for the $100k machine in exchange for promising to E&S that they would not go into the flight simulator business. Eventually, with new employee Ray Feeney¹s help, the resulting ³Abel/Kovaks box² would drive six axes of movement in both the camera and the motion controlled object for virtually unlimited range of motion combinations. RAA sold it¹s own software under the division Abel Image Research. Bill Kovacs went away to found Wavefront and Frank Vitz took over his job as head of R&D. (Frank ended up as VP of Production while they produced the Gold Series for Benson and Hedges and the \"Brilliance\" commercial for the Canned Food Council or \"Sexy Robot\" as it was called.\n\nDisney¹s ³The Black Hole² Disney had awarded the job to an independent company ³Neo Plastics² run by C.D. Taylor and Mick Hagerty. They in turn hired John Hughes to create a vector graphics grid/black hole simulation. John rented Abel¹s E&S system and shot the images off the screen, optically compositing the CG with artwork and additional traditional animation. Unfortunately once he had the job, but also realized that he had to deliver it in a mere 14 days. Not only did John actually finish the job in just 9 days, but Disney like it so much they would have them repeat the effect for the film¹s opening sequence and one-sheet poster.\n\nTRON! Kenny Merman and Frank Vitz headed the team that produced the opening titles and ³Flynn¹s Ride² sequences.\n\n(BOB: what¹s the story about an Australian ³con artist² trying to buy RAA?)\n\nAt its peak, RAA occupied some 45,000 square feet and employed 240 people. With the best of intentions, Robert Abel & Associates was sold in September of 1986 to John Pennie of Omnibus Computer Graphics of Canada for $8.5 million. The hope was to gain much needed capital investment from an established, publicly traded company. As soon as January of 1987, just a few months later, it was clear that all was not right with the new parent company. Sure enough, that April the 12th all the Omnibus people left en mass in the evening. The next day, April 13th, 1987, with word that Omnibus had defaulted on mountains of dept, all of Abel¹s had one last party before packing up for good.\n\nHundreds of talented people passed through Abel¹s, many of whom are leaders of the CG field today. Clark Anderson, Richard \"Dr.\" Baily (Image Savant), John Grower(Santa Barbara Studios/Wavefront), Charles Gibson(R&H), Keith Goldfarb, Steve Grey, Rich Hoover, John Hughes(Rhythm & Hues), Pauline T¹So (R&H), Bill Kovacs(Alias|Wavefront), Sherry McKenna, Tim McGovern(MetroLight, Sony ImageWorks), Kenny Mirman, John Nelson, Con Pederson(MetroLight), Randy Roberts, Richard Taylor, Michael Wahrman.\n\nRobert Abel himself went on to explore other varied independent projects in various interactive multimedia. He continues to work actively today, speaking frequently at many CG and visual effects related conferences.\n\nRobert Greenberg and Associates\n\n(1981 To present)\n\nChris Woods set up a computer graphics department in 1981. Early on some folks from Hanna Barbara did some research, but not until 1985 did the CG department really get off the ground. The initial crew were all from MAGI/Synthavision: Josh Pines and Ken Perlin wrote the RGA rendering code, Jan Carlee and Christine Chang were also joined later by Tom Miller. [FACTOID] The first film project (of many) that Ken Perlins noise function code was applied to was the film Weird Science in 1985. (Now there¹s an obscure factoid for you!). Integral to RGA up to that point was a world class optical and motion control effects department headed by Joel Hynek and Stuart Robertson. The Los Angeles production office, run by George Joblove (Technology/ILM) and Ellen Summers (Producer/Boss Film) and RG/LA operated from 19?? To 199?.\n\nSanta Barbara Studios (SBS)\n\n(1990 to present)\n\nSanta Barbara Studios was founded in 1990 by John Grower, and began specializing in procedural natural phenomenon effects using Wavefront Technologies Dynamation software. Employees included Bill Kovacs, Will Rivera, Eric Guagliani, Bruce Jones, Phil Brock, Eric DeJong, Mark, Wendell, Diane Holland and Matt Rhodes. Programmer named Axel? Large format work has included the the 70mm 3D film Shooting Star and IMAX space films Destiny In Space and Cosmic Voyage. Television series contributions included Other Worlds: A Tour of the Solar System and two collaborations with the Kleiser-Walczak Company on The Astronomers and 500 Nations (which depicted beautifully realistic re- constructions of Native American cultures.) Recent feature film work has included An American Werewolf in Paris, Spawn, Star Trek: Generations, and Star Trek: Insurrection.\n\nSide Effects Incorporated\n\n(1987 to present)\n\nMakers of the procedurally based 3D systems PRISMS and its modern version Houdini. Founded by Kim Davidson and partner Greg Hermanovic after the demise of Omnibus Toronto. Greg was Director of Research at Omnibus and Kim programmed and was the Director of Animation. When Omnibus went under in 1987, Greg and Kim bought the rights to the PRISMS software they had developed from the Royal Bank of Canada (the majority dept holder of Omnibus at the time of it¹s collapse). They started up a production house called Side Effects that later split into two: Side Effects Production and Side Effects Software. (The production side eventually was renamed ³Spin Productions² to reduce confusion. Greg Hermanovic, Kim Davidson, Mark Elendt and Paul Breslin were presented with a 1998 Academy Scientific and Technical Achievement Award for the development of procedural modeling and animation componants of the Prisms software package. Prisms has been used in dozens of major feature films such as Apollo 13, Titanic, Contact, Independence Day, Fifth Element and Ghost in the Shell. Side Effects is thriving today, having renamed PRISMS in September of 1996 as their new updated Houdini software. Houdini also has recently been made available for the Windows NT platform, and has been ported to Linex. Side Effects presently has offices in Santa Monica, CA and Toronto, Canada. 416-504-9876 www.sidefx.com\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc.\n\n(1982 to present)\n\nFounded in 1982 by Dr. Jim Clark (Ph.D. University of Utah 1974). Manufacturer of RISC processor based IRIS graphics workstations. SGI IRIS (Integrated Raster Imaging System) Jim Clark, while at Stanford University, invented the \"Graphics Engine\" the first VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) graphics chip.\n\n-FACTOID: Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics went on to found Netscape Communications Corporation.

Acquired both Alias and Wavefront in 1995 and Cray Supercomputers in 1996. Announced in 1997 was a new joint effort with Microsoft and Intel to develop a next generation processor line for its graphics workstations, a new SGI Intel/NT. Just introduced in spring of 1999, the SGI 320 and 540 workstations are Windows NT based and cost between $3,400 and $5,995 US. The 540 supports up to 4 PentiumII Xeon 450MHz processors, and up to 2GB or graphics memory.\n\nFAMILY TREE OF HARDWARE 1983/84 SGI's first 1000 series workstations were really terminals, as they required a VAX host.

Its first interactive 3D software product ³Creative Environment 1.0² debut at the 1988 Siggraph in Atlanta. SoftImage led the way in advanced IK character animation tools for high end 3D users with the Actor module. The work on Actor started late 1990 and was first shown in public at Siggraph 1991 in LasVegas, and first released in version 2.51 of the Softimage Creative Environment in early 1992. Dominique Boisvert, Rejean Gagne, Daniel Langlois, and Richard Laperriere were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1998 for the development of the \"Actor\" animation component of the SoftImage computer animation system. The company did well by being promoted at a time when industry leader Alias was floundering due to management and marketing troubles. SoftImage was acquired by Microsoft in 1994, and sold to Avid in June of 1998 for $285 million. Current products include ³Toonz² 2D cell animation production software, and Softimage|DS which runs on SGI, NT and Integraph platforms.

Sogitec is a big industrial group that act mainly in the military field as part of Dassault Electronic. The Sogitec CG department was created in 1982/83 By Xavier Nicolas with Daniel Poiroux and Alain Grach to try to create images using a customized version of a flight simulator software. The first short animated film they created was called \"Maison Vole\". Early employees included Veronique Damian, and David Salesin. Sogitec became a subsidiary of Dassault Aviation in France, and is now involved in simulation, but not in CGI directly. Nicolas joined with TDI¹s production unit in 1989 to form Ex Machina.\n\nStanford\n\nThe Stanford Computer Graphics Laboratory can be found online at http://www-graphics.stanford.edu\n\nSymbolics Graphics Division (SGD)\n\n(1981 To 1992)\n\nIn 1980, Symbolics, Inc. was formed, headed by Russell Noftsker and his right hand man & CTO Jack Holloway (both from Triple-I). Hardware architecture was based upon work by researchers at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Lisp Machine project in 1974 (Thanks to the close proximity of the Symbolics Cambridge Research Center). The Symbolics LM-2 was introduced in 1981, the 3600 in 1982, followed by the Symbolics 3640 and 3670 (1984), and the 3675 and 3645 systems (1985). At its peak in 1985 Symbolics had over 650 employees and 35 sales offices in North America, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East. Symbolics had over 1500 systems installed around the world. Color graphics system hardware included 8-bit or 24-bit high-resolution frame buffers, 32-bit broadcast resolution frame buffer, CAD buffer, Digitizing frame grabber, Genlock option (for synchronization to video), Color monitors (standard, premium, NTSC-resolution, and CAD buffer monitors), Graphics tablet, NTSC encoders and decoders. The Symbolics Graphics Division (SGB) was created by former members of Triple-I when that company ceased computer graphics production work in about 1981. Founded initially by Tom McMahon (General Manager from Triple-I), he was soon joined by Craig Reynolds, Dave Dyer, Larry Malone, Jeremy Schwartz, Larry Stein(hardware) and Bob Coyne(software). Matt Elson, Jay Sloat and Ken Brain were artists, TD¹s and trainers.. Tom first worked out of the small Woodland hills office, commuting often to the Massachusetts research center. Chatsworth was home for a short while before finally locating to Westwood, CA. In 1983. SGD¹s first general Manager was Howard Cannon from the Cambridge office; followed by Sheila Madsen, John Kulp and then Tom McMahon. Tom went on to design most of the hardware and video systems for the company, including all of the framegrabbing, genlock and High Definition Capabilities that SGD pioneered with Sony and others.\n\n[SYMBOLICS FIRSTS] Symbolics produced the first workstation which could genlock, the first to have real time video I/O, the first to support digital video I/O and the first to do HDTV.\n\nIn-house tools included S-Geometry for modelling and S- Dynamics for animation. S-Paint was a LISP based 32bit paint system designed by Craig Reynolds, Tom McMahon, Bob Coyne and Eric Weaver.\n\n[SIDEBAR] Stanley and Stella: Breaking The Ice As many as 50 people worked on the project and shared responsibility. Some key people included , Phillipe Bergeron(hero animation), Joseph Goldstone, Kevin Hunter, Larry Malone, Craig Reynolds(flocking and schooling code), Jim Ryan, and Michael Wahrman(Producer). Richard ³Dr.² Baily was hired by Michael Wahrman to model the two main characters based on sketches. He also composed and recorded the original soundtrack, which was later replaced by another one.\n\nAround 1990, Symbolics started to fail and began to lay off people. Even though the SGD had a successful ongoing business with a good customer base, it still relied on their parent company for workstation and operating system technology, as well as other corporate infrastructure like HR, finance, customer service etc.\n\nTom McMahon relates the following events: ³Eventually, SGD was the target of a takeover and transition to Japanese management. SGD's Japanese distributor (Nichimen) had a thriving business based on the SGD product line of videographics hardware and the animation & rendering software. They couldn't afford to see us get blown away less the be left without a source of supply. SO they started buying up an insurance policy. They made Symbolics some offers it couldn't refuse given its poor financial health. In a sequence of financial transactions, Nichimen bought rights to certain hardware technologies. They also started picking up the payroll for SGD employees in exchange for certain worldwide distribution rights. In the end we had the people but Nichimen ended up owning most of our hard-earned technology. We had already begun looking at how to port these tools off of Symbolics workstation platforms.SGI became the porting target. By 1991 we were well into the re-write and port. But Symbolics needed to pull the plug on us. I worked out a pretty amazing salvage deal with our old friends at III. I negotiated a contract where I could take ALL of SGD's key employees back to the employ of III, but under a funding arrangement with Nichimen. Nichimen got their security blanket and the employees kept their jobs. (A blanket layoff and the entire extermination of SGD was the alternative at the time.) At III we proceeded to port all of the SGD products to SGI machines. But things started going sour there too. We spun out of Triple-I and started yet another new company (with Nichimen seed funding) called Del Rey Graphics (co- founded by Al Fenaughty (President and CEO of Triple-I), along with Jack Holloway, one of the Foonly designers at Triple-I). But that didn't work due to a hostile takeover by Nichimen. My partners and I ended up selling the whole thing to Nichimen and what is left of this very long thread is now called Nichimen Graphics.²\n\nSymbolics declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995, and was bought back by it¹s original founder Russell Noftsker.\n\nSynthavision\n\n-See MAGI\n\nSystems Simulation Ltd.\n\n(1977 To 1988)\n\nJohn Lansdown founded System Simulation in London with his colleague George Mallen and others from the Computer Arts Society. Through it, he developed major innovations in computer animation, such as special effects for advertisements and television titles, the feature films Alien (1979), Saturn III and Heavy Metal and the realization of the original animated Channel 4 logo. John created what was then the world's largest computer generated mural. (Reviewed in 'Building Design' as a 'waste of electricity', although few today would question the bright power of his creative output. John Lansdown chaired the company until 1988.

Overviews correctly showed sub-pixel data as anti- aliased averages. The same system could also be used to reveal different symbology at different levels of zoom. As far as we ar aware, it was the first display system to achieve either of these. The hardware required to do this was carefully chosen and designed but quite modest.\n\nReferences\n\nImprovements in display apparatus for controlling raster scan displays.

We moved on to use the HLH Orion Unix workstation's new colour display (the design of which was in part influenced by us: we later took delivery of the pre-production prototype).

This reflected a commitment to using technology in education, and a belief in its transformative power, which have again become important in the 90s. The Lab's earliest home was in the Chemistry department, which already boasted the most advanced computer graphics available for state-of-the -art chemical modeling - a Vector General Calligraphic Display (PDP 11/45). The earliest goal was to develop computer-based introductory material for the chemistry curriculum, with the basic premise that this would constitute a self-paced learning environment specifically designed for the varying entry levels of students at an urban university.\n\nCircle Graphics Habitat brought together Tom DeFanti and Dan Sandin. The media development system they designed used DeFanti's Graphics Symbiosis System and the Sandin Image Processor. The Graphics Symbiosis System (GRASS) was a computer graphics language that DeFanti had developed for his PhD thesis. The Sandin Image Processor was a patch- programmable analog video synthesizer. A combination of the two systems was the basis of a video production facility for the generation of educational materials. Sandin was a faculty member of the sculpture department where he taught video and was involved with the making of electronically-based, interactive, kinetic sculpture. Circle Graphics therefore also brought together chemists, engineers and artists. An equally important early goal for the Lab was to use the systems created to make art. The GRASS and Image Processor systems were used to make real-time animations that were distributed on the experimental video circuit. The Lab also organized a series of Real Time Interactive Installations and Performances - performance in the music tradition rather than in the newer sense of performance art.\n\nElectronic Visualization Events 1-3 The first EVE (1973) event was actually an IEVE - Interactive Electronic Visualization Event. The performers were faculty and students of Chicago Circle (UIC) and of the School of the Art Institute. The performances took place in the rotunda of the Science and Engineering South building. In the evenings images, manipulated using the GRASS system and analogue processor, were projected onto large video screens and shown on monitors to the accompaniment of live music.\n\n\"Real time\", with respect to these performances, meant that the images changed instantaneously as the controls were manipulated. In effect, the performers \"played\" both musical instruments and visuals. The performances were improvisational, in a a variety of musical styles. Preparation involved not only technical and programming issues, but extensive jamming. The interactivity of Interactive Electronic Visualization Event was supplied during the day when the audience could come and play with the equipment. Subsequently the \"I\" was dropped, EVE2 and EVE3 continued as performances, which were interactive for the performers but not for the audience.\n\nEVE1 was the prototype, establishing the possibility of such an event. EVE2 (1975) involved a lot more planning and quality control of content but was also held in the rotunda with live musical accompaniment. EVE3, in 1977, still emphasised the Real Time possibilities of this medium. However, the performers felt that the logistics of organizing a complicated live performance and a large-scale physical event, were beginning to interfere with aesthetic goals. Therefore, the performances were recorded in front of a small studio audience and edited on a 3/4\" deck. The finished show took place in the auditorium of the First National Bank, the computer graphics and sound were played back on a light-valve projector. By the end of the '70s calligraphic systems were being replaced by raster graphics systems with frame buffering. Except in the video games industry, computer graphics became very static. The possibility of interacting in real-time with graphics is only becoming a possibility in the 90s.\n\nIn 1976, Larry Cuba came to the lab to create his wireframe Death Star Simulation for George Lucas¹ Star Wars film. (Please see the Milestones chapter for all the details.) The EVL is current actively working on new projects, information about which can be found online here: http://www.evl.uic.edu/EVL/index.html .

The number one problem of the day (according to Ed Catmull at least) was hidden surfaces. Many continually evolving algorithms, such as Watkin¹s algorithm (which subdivided the picture) were never actually implemented but served as inspiration for more practical solutions, such as Catmull¹s more expensive techniques that actually subdivided surfaces. (This work was presented in his thesis work ³Characteristics of 10 hidden surface Algorythms.² in 1974). At the time Ivan Sutherland did not like Catmull¹s ³brute-force² approach, but the advent of much cheaper memory and storage made it an extremely effective, and increasingly practical. Indeed it is just such a technique that is used as the basis for most all CG systems today. Catmull, as part of his interest in solving curved surface problems, had briefly attempted techniques of bending polygons before making his discovering of how to very efficiently and quickly subdivide cubic patches.\n\n[Utah Image processing] Tom Stockham was a brilliant teacher at Utah who brought together the disciplines of image processing and computer graphics. His extraordinary contributions in his related work in audio processing were honored in February of 1999 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with a Technical Achievement Award.\n\nHow to light things? Henry Gouraud had been working for some time on linear interpolated shading, when he visited Martin Newell and his brother in England who were working on similar research. A stumbling block with the early implementation was mach-banding artifacts, which also hindered the Newell¹s, allowing Gouraud to travel to Utah to finish his ³Continuous Shading of Curved Surfaces² in 1971. Other important individuals at Utah over the years included Frank Crow in the image processing group who developed the concept of anti aliasing; Jim Blinn develops bump mapping and environment mapping while a graduate student; Jim Clark, Lance Williams, Garland Stern, Ron Resch, Alan Kay, John Warnock, Fred Parke, Patrick Baudelaire, Jim Kajiya, Christy Barton, Gary Watkins and man of others.

Vertigo: a brief history written by Rick Stringfellow Starting Up Vertigo started developing in the early 80¹s in Vancouver BC, Canada. Its exact starting date and who had the original idea is not known. The team that started the product gained funding from the Canadian government. The system was designed largely by animators for animators seemingly looking to solve the problem of creating the best animation system without much too much regard for the final cost. Cubicomps Vertigo system In the later part of the 80¹s when Vertigo International had sold few systems, Cubicomp stepped in and purchased the whole venture. Cubicomp¹s reason for purchasing was speculated to be that it¹s own workstation development was falling behind and it need to acquire Vertigo to keep up with the success of other workstation products such as Wavefront and TDI. The acquisition saw Cubicomp take the Vertigo development to the next phase. In 1990 Cubicomp collapsed, leaving Vertigo in Vancouver. At this point the system was just poised to really take some leaps forward; however without the marketing support of Cubicomp, Vertigo seemed doomed. Vertigo Technology Inc. In 1990, out of the ashes of Cubicomp a couple of ex- vertigo employees and a group of investors purchased the code. With little money and little experience this team managed to finish the next release of code, which sold well. Existing Vertigo users, fearing that this would be the last cut bought up the software. Surprised by success the team then continued to expand and rebuilt the company. For a number of years the successes continued, as did the releases of versions. New features were added and the team grew back to the size that it was in the early days. In 1993 the decision was taken to ditch the old renderer in favor of supporting the industry standard RenderMan. The team undertook to do this directly creating a seamless link to RenderMan. An interface was created to allow easy interactive editing of shaders and renders to RenderMan without writing out RIBs. Finally this allowed Vertigo to break into the film market. Disney BVVE took the system, along with a great deal of support from Vertigo. This relationship grew into Vertigo eventually producing shots for Disney movies in Vancouver. Even with this success and turning into a public company Vertigo again began to run short of cash and its lost its ability to compete with teams such as Softimage and Alias/Wavefront. In a final attempt to get out of the way of these bigger competitors the team started to move the entire development to the Mac using Apple Quickdraw3D. At the same time spinning off smaller components into 2D applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Vertigo still exists and still functions on the SGI. (see the Animation chapter for more details.) Rick Stringfellow was Head of Animation, Product Manager and Designer of versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6 and the Mac port. Rick can be reached at Radical Entertainment (604 ­ 602 2664 / rstringfellow@radical.ca )\n\nVIFX\n\n(1985 to 1999) Co-founded by partners Richard Hollander, Greg McMurry, Rhonda Gunner and John Wash. The companies first job was to produce video display graphics for the feature film 2010:Odysee Two. Virtually all the 3D CG in the early years was produced using Cubicomp equipment. Richard was inspired by a NASA/Kodak article about CCD technology and promptly designed and built a 1k by 1k input scanner for production use. The first digital composites it was used for were on the feature film ³Bill and Ted¹s Excellent Adventure² in 199?. In about 1990, the company began creating more ambitious motion picture visual effects and was then known by VIFX/Video Image. Feature film visual effects work for Twentieth Century Fox production as well as other studios, was wide ranging and extensive. The work included Batman Returns, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Down Periscope, Volcano, Face Off, X-Files, Relic, Star Trek Insurrection, Blade, and Pushing Tin. VIFX was sold to Twentieth Century Fox in 1996, and partners Greg McMurry and Rhonda Gunner left the company. In 1998 the Fox animation production Planet Ice was changed from an all 3D CG feature to being traditional cell animation, leaving VIFX with an opportunity to sell themselves yet again to Rhythm & Hues in the spring of 1999. About 80 people, including Richard Hollander, transferred to the new company following the merger. John Wash is no longer with the company but does continue to consult. Richard Hollander currently is President of the film effects division of Rhythm & Hues. He also co- chairs the Motion Picture Academy of Arts & Sciences¹ Digital Imaging Technology Subcommittee with Ray Feeney.\n\nWavefront\n\nA Brief History of Wavefront by Mark Sylvester, Ambassador: Alias|Wavefront\n\nOverview: Larry Barels, Bill Kovacs and Mark Sylvester founded Wavefront Technologies in 1984. The company created its first product, an animation software application called PreView and shipped it to Universal Studios for use on the television series Knight Rider, and to Lamb and Company for use in previsualizing and controlling a motion control camera rig. During the next several years the product line was expanded to include modeling, rendering, compositing, and material editing capabilities. The company enjoyed early relationships with key partners that shaped the direction of the products and the marketplace. Those early partners included Disney (The Great Mouse Detective), NASA (The Shuttle accident recreation), NBC (1986 Olympics) and Failure Analysis (Legal animations, including the World Airways crash at Logan Airport).\n\nThe company's first real competition came in 1987 with the advent of Robert Abel and Associates software division, AIR (Abel Image Research). This company, originally founded on a codebase developed by Bill Kovacs, was started to capitalize on the momentum that Wavefront was enjoying in the marketplace. This software was incomplete, undocumented, and very expensive, however AIR had the best marketing materials in the industry with an award winning animation reel done by Robert Abel. Unable to compete against this body of work a deal was struck in 1988, which had Wavefront purchasing the assets of AIR. The AIR software was never incorporated into the Wavefront codebases, even though urban myths have contrary opinions.\n\nThe company was originally financed by the founders for the first year, then went through several rounds of venture funding, culminating in an IPO ten years later in 1995. Initial revenues were in the several hundred thousand per year range, and ended in 1994 with annual revenues around 26$M.\n\nThe company went from 3 founders and 4 employees, to 12, then 28, then 50, then 90, and then 160 at its highest point in the late 80¹s. Expansion into Europe happened in 1987 with the creation of Wavefront Europe, located in Belgium. It was at that time that the Belgian government also became an investor. The next year, concurrent with the AIR acquisition, Wavefront moved into Japan, and then throughout the rest of Asia.\n\nIn the early 90¹s a round of funding with CSK, a major Japanese computer company resulted in the founding of Wavefront Japan, a wholly owned subsidiary. CSK at one time owned 14% of Wavefront.\n\nHow the Company Got Started\n\nOriginally designed as a production company to create visual effects for commercials and feature films, the initial fundraising efforts were ineffectual until the business model was changed to that of a software company that could sell the same software that the production company would create to produce the commercials. During the first year the company¹s production department, headed by John Grower, now president of Santa Barbara Studios (Star Trek: Insurrection, American Werewolf in Paris) created opening graphics for ShowTime, BRAVO, and the National Geographic Explorer television show. These projects allowed the new software to be tuned to meet the needs of the animators and provided the company with early marketing materials.\n\nIn March of 1985 the company attended its first tradeshow, NCGA, and (with Alias) participated in Silicon Graphics¹ booth. At this show the first systems were sold, to NBC (New York), Electronic Arts (London), Video PaintBrush (Australia), Failure Analysis (Mtn. View) and NASA (Houston). This put the company in two markets, Broadcast and Engineering Visualization, and on multiple continents, forcing management to deal with multiple opportunities across diverse geographies.\n\nIn 1993 Wavefront entered into discussions to acquire another of the pioneering computer graphics companies, Thomson Digital Images (TDI). TDI had developed a similar set of technologies, in modeling, animation and rendering, and had innovated in the area of NURB modeling and Interactive Rendering. Those technologies coupled with extensive distribution in Europe and Asia made for an ideal fit with Wavefront. The acquisition was treated more as a merger, however, more than half of the employees of TDI left immediately. It took nearly two years to blend the distribution channels in Europe and Asia, as Wavefront had a toehold in those areas already, and fierce competition between the channels was clearly in play.\n\nWhat Markets Did Wavefront Serve?\n\nWavefront started with the intent of working with the film and high-end commercial market. However, as a result of its first major tradeshow, it was accepted into the Visualization, Engineering, Broadcast and Post-Production marketplaces as well. The fact that the system was designed to be open-architecture allowed for this market expansion. The majority of the software as designed served both markets well, with some modification for data import, and numerical accuracy to satisfy the military (NASA) and forensic animation (Failure Analysis) requirements. Because of the open architecture of the system, originally crafted by Roy Hall, who went on to receive an Academy Award, and Bill Kovacs, for the system design, third party developers were able to create ancillary applications and market them through a program called Ripples. This open approach was a hallmark of Wavefront, and tended to draw users that were more technical, and interested in customizing the application.\n\nThe original business plan talked about military, educational, medical, electronic game, simulation, film/entertainment, engineering and product visualization marketplaces. The only one that never materialized was the simulation market. The company expanded into the scientific market in the late 80¹s with a product called The Data Visualizer. This product, aimed at non-polygonal databases was a success until Silicon Graphics and IBM developed competing products offered for free in bundles to sell high end server hardware into the scientific marketplace. The Data Visualizer built upon Wavefront¹s reputation for open systems, and fast graphics interaction.\n\nThe company made one foray into the desktop¹ marketplace with a project co-developed with Silicon Graphics, called The Personal Visualizer. This product was created to give CAD users a point and click interface to highend photorealistic rendering. Initially targeted to SGI hardware, the product was eventually ported to Sun, IBM, HP, Tektronix, DEC, and SONY. The strategy was to bundle the software on every system sold, then follow on with module sales into the installed base.\n\nThe company had its best success in the post- production marketplace with sales into the major networks, as the software was extremely fast, productive and reliable. It was able to keep up with that industries incessant demand for more speed. The other major success for the company was in Engineering Visualization. Based upon the idea that the software would be a compliment to CAD, the Wavefront system specialized in file translation, with native translators for every major CAD package. At one Autofact tradeshow, Wavefront was in the booths of 22 vendors, showing interactive visualization of parts, mechanisms, and assemblies created with a plethora of CAD packages. This, coupled with the systems open architecture for reading any type of ASCII data, allowed it to also serve in the post- simulation visualization space, which included NASA, and virtually any company that wanted to view results derived from supercomputers and proprietary software. In 1995, nearly half of the company¹s installed base was in this marketplace.\n\nIn 1993 the company entered the Electronic Game market with a repackaging of its core application, The Advanced Visualizer, into a tailored offering called GameWare. This bundle focused the marketplace on Wavefront for game development and was very successful. This effort lasted for one year until the merger (of Alias and Wavefront) when the program was canceled so that PowerAnimator could be sold to game developers instead.\n\nMajor Customers\n\nIn the film market, Disney was the premier customer, with Warner Digital, BOSS Film (both now defunct), Industrial Light and Magic, Film Magic (Hong Kong), TRIX (Belgium), and Electronic Arts (London). In video production, NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN (Turner Broadcasting) were the premiere partners. In engineering visualization there was Harvard, NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research), NASA (6 locations), Alcoa, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The military visualization marketplace included the CIA, FBI, Naval Surface Warfare Center, US Air Force and the National Security Agency. At the high point there were nearly 8000 Advanced Visualizer users.\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nFor the first few years the company enjoyed rapid growth in the film, video and engineering marketplaces. As most customers were doing mostly the same types of things the company was not stressed with specific product requests that were not generally applicable to all types of users. The visualization market was mostly in place to create marketing videos and presentations, so the tools to create pretty pictures¹ were most desirable. It was after the effort of The Personal Visualizer, and the growing demand for CAD Visualization that the company had to began custom engineering to develop CAD translators.\n\nThese efforts at CAD visualization were significant because Wavefront was the first to take on this arena, but the efforts of porting to every platform that carried CAD applications, and the fact that it took nearly one year per port, AND the fact that most facilities eventually would run CAD on Sun, HP, or IBM, and then use Silicon Graphics for Visualization really took the competitive wind out of the sails of the company. Because so much effort was spent on CAD compatibility, and trying to negotiate porting deals with hardware manufactures, the focus on film and video application advancement was lost.\n\nThis loss of focus allowed Alias to make inroads into the entertainment market, and also created a vacuum in the entertainment space, especially in animation, that Softimage filled. Softimage was originally billed as a blend of the best of Alias and Wavefront software. Designed by artists, for artists, it languished and was not taken very seriously until they released the product Actor, which was the first Inverse Kinematics package that allowed animators to do real character animation easily. (Actor was recognized this year with a Technical Achievement Award by the Academy). This propelled them into the spotlight of the entertainment marketplace. Remnants of this period still exist in the entertainment market today, with Alias used for modeling (Alias also received a Technical Achievement Award for the modeling component of Power Animator, the recognized industry standard), Wavefront (Dynamation) used for simulation animation, Softimage for character animation, and Renderman for rendering.\n\nFor Wavefront, this meant a retrenching into Engineering Visualization, with a renewed focus on CAD translation, and less on porting, as porting efforts started to dwindle post-1992, with the demise of the Personal Visualizer. The reliance on revenue from the visualization market allowed for the development of the Data Visualizer, and continued emphasis on motion data import into The Advanced Visualizer. The efforts to continue to work with the Engineering Visualization market were terminated post- merger as the Alias sales force had no expertise, nor management acumen in this marketplace.\n\nIn 1994, the activities that lead to the release of GameWare invigorated the company¹s marketing efforts and returned to them the spotlight, and increased the competition between Alias and Wavefront. The company teamed up with Corypheus Software to produce a real-time simulation environment for use on Onyx systems, giving greater control to game developers. (Called Activation, this product was terminated as it conflicted with Alias¹s efforts in the game business, post-merger). Several Wavefront executives and technical personnel went to Corypheus post-merger.\n\nIn early 1995, another effort was undertaken to capture the architectural market. ArcVision was designed to take existing CAD translation software and bundle it with preset color and environment controls, using IPR (Explore¹s renderer front-end) to offer a low cost solution to small firms that wanted to experiment with different color and lighting schemes, using existing CAD architectural databases. This project was terminated post-merger as the Alias management had bad experiences in this market with their Sonata purchase, and did not believe that the market was viable. It never really got off the ground, as it was scheduled to be launched at Siggraph, 1995.\n\nIn June of 1995 the merger of Alias Research, Wavefront and Silicon Graphics was culminated.\n\nIn 1998, a Scientific and Technical Achievement Award to Jim Keating, Michael Wahrman and Richard Hollander for their contributions that led to the Wavefront Advanced Visualizer computer graphics system. Also in 1998, A Scientific and Engineering Award was presented to Bill Kovacs for his creative leadership and Roy Hall for his principal engineering efforts that led to the Wavefront Advanced Visualizer computer graphics program.\n\nWhitney/Demos Productions\n\n(1986 to 1988)\n\nFounded by John Whitney Jr. and Gary Demos after their company Digital Productions was taken over by Omnibus. Funding assistance included Tom McMahon from the Symbolics Graphics Division and other private investors. Initial production was based upon the Thinking Machine¹s Connection Machine II fronted by a Symbolics workstation, along with other computer systems. Their first project was to team up with fellow ex-Triple-I employees from the Symbolics Graphics Division to produce the film Stanley and Stella: Breaking The Ice. Unfortunately before they could collect the remainder of an initail $5million loan, the majority of the CG production industry collapsed (thanks to the Omnibus fiasco), and the investors balked. THE NAME GAME After declaring bankruptcy in June of 1988, Gary Demos went on to form his own research company DemoGraFX while John Whitney Jr. elected to stay and take the company through the bankruptcy proceedings himself. John continued the company under various names, initially starting fresh as Optomystic. When another company¹s name was found to be similar to that of Optomystic, he changed the name to Digital Animation Laboratories, later selling the assets of the company to US Animation Labs. In December of 1996, that company split in two, keeping the production side as Virtual Magic and selling the company name and software side to Toom Boom Technologies. Today John runs his remaining original assets of Digital Animation Laboratories under the name Digital Editions Inc. (There will be a quiz on this later so I hope you paid attention to all that. ­Tman)\n\nXaos\n\n(1988 to present)\n\nFounded in early 1988 by Arthur Shwartzberg and Michael Tolson. Arthur's strength and experience was in Marketing while Michael was the creative visionary. Xaos was originally called Eidolon when they both left a studio in SF called Synthetic Video, where Arthur was Director of Marketing and Michael was a co-founder. Xaos began at the time of collapse for so much of the CG community, and made the decision to go with 100% proprietary tools as the basis for their work. As a small shop (10 or 11 people) there was a conscious decision to not pursue the standard fare of \"flying logos\" which was the backbone of the industry at the time. Their unique design esthetic won instant acclaim at places like the NCGA, BDA and SIGGRAPH. Arthur and Michael left the company in 1991 to form Xaos Tools, in a hope to capitalize on the very unique software tools that Xaos had created. Taking over in their absence was Marc Malmberg who kept the company going at its then current state. Significant at the time was a decision to make a 100% change over to an NT based production pipeline, a situation that is still the case today. Arthur left Xaos Tools in 1996, with Michael following in late 1998. Xaos Tools has gone threw bankruptsy but should continue in some form at least for a while. Arthur then returned to Xaos in 1998, and preceded to implement significant changes to it's whole business strategy and long term plans. Marc Malmberg left Xaos in 1998. Today, Xaos is in the midst of a re-birth of sorts, planning to roughly double in size from 25 to 50 employees in the next year. It is this \"boutique\" sensibility that is the intended format to carry them into the next era of creative content markets. Key to this plan is strengthening the already strong presence in the large format film market, and expanding their commercial presence. Early employees included Chitra Shriram(Creative Director), Roberta Brandao, Henry Preston(ILM), Amelia Chenoweth and Hayden Landis(ILM), Eric Texier(ILM), Ken Pearce(PDI), Tony Lupidi(Electronic Arts). http://www.xaos.com\n\nXerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)\n\nThe Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) opened on July 1st, 1970 in Palo Alto, California; just outside the Stanford University campus. [FACTIOD] PARC initially followed the pure research model of such facilities as IBM's Yorktown Heights research Center, AT&T Bell labs, MIT Lincoln Labs, and The Stanford Research Instutute \"Augmentation Research Center\" (Where Douglas C. Engelbart created the mouse.) PARC also spawned the follow up DEC Systems Research Center, founded later by Bob Taylor just across the Stanford campus from PARC. Jacob Goldman, chief Scientist and founder of PARC initially divided the facility into three separate units: 1) The Computer Science Lab (SuperPaint!) 2) Systems Science Lab 3) General Science lab. While computer graphics was never a goal of PARC per se, Bob Taylor himself was very familiar with this new area of computer science research. He had overseen the Information Processing Techniques Office of ARPA (The Defense Departments Advanced Research Project Agency) which funded many early university grauduate programs, including Dave Evans' graduate program at Utah back in 1965. The person who did bring CG research to PARC under Taylor was Dr. Richard Shoup of Carnegie Mellon University. Shoup had been at the short lived BCC (Berkeley Computer Company) from 1968 to 1970, and was given a full year upon starting at PARC to explore what it was he wanted to do. What he ended up doing was developing Superpaint. Along with artist Alvy Ray Smith, Shoup experimented designed and built the first digital paint system with a non-random access, 8- bit frame buffer. [FACOID] SuperPaint records and stores it's first image (a picture of Dick Shoup holding a sign saying \"It works, sort of\") With assistance from Flegal, Curry and Patrick Beaudelaire on April 10th 1973. 486 x 640 res. Shoup left to form Aurora Systems and was Awarded a Technical Emmy Award in 1983. [QUOTE] ³My big technical contribution (I was really there as an artist) at Xerox PARC, to Shoup's Superpaint, was invention and implementation of the RGB to HSV transform for artistic selection of colors. Other than this contribution, all other programming of Superpaint was Dick's.² ­Alvy Ray Smith Other CG related breakthroughs at PARC included: -February 1975, the first GUI is demonstrated, with multiple windows and pop-up menus that would be incorporated later as a standard in both Mac (and later Windows) operating desktop systems. -The first Alto was powered up in 1973 (displaying an image of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.) It¹s bitmap display was a vertical format 8x11 inch screen with a resolution of 606x808 pixels. With a maximum of 128k of main memory and 2.5 meg disc over 2000 were manufactured by 1978 at a cost of about $12,000 each. Upgraded as the AltoII in 1975, and the AltoIII in 1976 it was actually the first PC installed in the White house (in 1978). Some irony perhaps as the world first WYSIWYG computer being used in the heart of Washington politics? -The Smalltalk object oriented language by Alan Kay (1974) developed the WIMP (Window manager, Icons, Mice and Pop-up) interface concept. PARC is still an active research center today. http://www.parc.xerox.com/parc-go.html\n\nEmail me with comments, contributions or corrections please!"
