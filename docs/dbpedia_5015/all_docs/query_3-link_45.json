        "text": "First time SGI owner here with no previous experience with the platform... seems like I am jumping in head first as they say.\n\nI picked up an SGI Octane from a swap meet a couple weekends ago. It was the base model, but hey, I paid $75.\n\nI then found an IP30 030-0887-005 system board on Mercari, and the seller of that board sent me an offer for $70. I couldn't resist having the 400MHz processor, plus whatever RAM was on the system board, for the bargain price.\n\nThe board arrived yesterday, and I went to swap out my board for the new system board. When I plugged the machine back in, I heard two relays clicking but nothing else happened (no fans, no lights except for an internal one that briefly flashes).\n\nI swapped my board back in, plugged it back in, and the Octane powered up.\n\nI then proceeded to swap between both boards, hoping the dance would result in both boards working. However, even after many attempts to reseat the new board, then swapping back to my board to make sure I had not done worse to the Octane, the behavior stays the same. My system board allows the system to power up, and the new system board results in two relays clicking and that's it.\n\nIs there anything I've overlooked?\n\nI agree that SGI machines seem to be much more fiddly in both hardware and software from their contemporary Sun counterparts, but this might be partly due to the fact that I spend a lot of time with Suns back in the day. Even so, in the last month I've brought back to life two Octanes, a R4K Indigo, and an Indy, and each had their hardware or IRIX struggles. That said, it's been kind of a fun challenge.\n\nI have left an R3K Indigo that sometimes posts. If it does, it quickly crashes with a \"CPU Parity\" error. In most cases, it immediately fails POST with a \"Replace CPU board\" message. The bonus problem with this is that I have an Indigo Elan graphics board, but the machine wont boot at all with that in. Any progress I've made has been using the base LG1 graphics board. Once I get the machine to reliably boot, then I can worry about the ELAN..."
