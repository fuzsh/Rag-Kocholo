        "text": "Hello @K03212\n\nThank you for posting on the Intel️® communities. We would be more than glad to help you with your issue.\n\nIn order to have a better understanding of your issue, please provide me with the following:\n\nSSU: Please download and scan your system using our tool, Intel® System Support Utility so we can help check your system info first. Once finished downloading, open the tool, click on scan 'Everything', click next, then save the system information to a .txt file. Please provide the .txt file.\n\nThis document will be necessary to check your entire system, to find possible errors or incompatibilities.\n\nAs part of our initial troubleshooting process, we recommend the following actions:\n\na. Ensure that your system's BIOS is up to date. It is important to note that issues pertaining to compatibility with your CPU may often be rooted in the motherboard. As such, updating the BIOS to the latest version is essential, as newer releases may resolve compatibility concerns.\n\nb. Reset your BIOS settings to their default values. This step is intended to eliminate any instability resulting from inadvertent configuration changes.\n\nc. Inspect all hardware components, including the motherboard, power supply, and RAM, for potential faults or loose connections. A detailed guide on this matter is available in the article titled Scenarios for Using a Processor Swap Test to Help Isolate an Issue.\n\nd. Ensure that your operating system is both up to date and functioning correctly. It is important to recognize that software-related issues can sometimes manifest as hardware instability.\n\nIf, after implementing these recommendations, your issue persists, we advise you to consult your motherboard's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to validate the proper functioning of your motherboard. Alternatively, if you wish to initiate a return merchandise authorization (RMA) with us, please do not hesitate to inform us of your decision.\n\nAdditionally, we encourage you to peruse the following articles, as they may contain valuable insights into resolving your concern:\n\n· Random System Crashes on an Intel® Boxed Processor.\n\n· Tips for Random System Freezing Issue.\n\nThank you for your patience and cooperation in addressing this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIsaac Q.\n\nIntel Customer Support Technician\n\nHello Isaac, I am so glad someone responded!\n\nI am desperate by now. Nothing seems to work and the system seems to be very unstable unless I extremely underclock the CPU. By now I am very certain that the CPU is somehow faulty. Crashes happen randomly, but much quicker under load. Even with XMP off nothing is stable and when the CPU is on default settings it crashes very fast under load. Only downclocking the speed helps. TXT file is attached. Spent days by now, trying to find out whats wrong.\n\nBut please keep in mind most crashes are not visible anymore since I reinstalled windows to exlcude potential software errors. I had plenty of crashes before reinstalled windows and my event logger claimed that the source been several of my CPU cores which had critical errors. It first began with hardware errors that the computer was able to compensate (it did not crash the PC back then, just single applications), then it turned into crashing the whole computer at some point with bluescreens. By now the whole computer just freezes without bluescreens and after 1-2 minutes it usually boots back up. So, there are no detailed crash logs anymore. The crash logs usually reported this for several APIC IDs when the computer was still able to log things:\n\nEvent ID 19\n\nFixed hardware error.\n\nReported by component: processor core\n\nSource of error: Machine check corrected\n\nError Type: Internal parity error\n\nProcessor APIC ID: 32\n\nThe detailed view of this entry contains further information.\n\nRegarding the suggestions:\n\na. Already using newest BIOS.\n\nb. Done so several times. In fact, this will increase the frequency of the crashes and crashes the computer under heavy load. Downclocking helps.\n\nc. I build two identical computers which began to have the same issues over time. Both been running mostly well for months and there was no physical tampering done during that time. The one that got used more started to have these issues earlier but both CPUs did stop to run stable on the default BIOS settings at some point. They are in closed proper cases and I knew what I did when I build them, nothing is lose, everything is well cooled.\n\nd. It is up to date and was before. I reinstalled windows to make sure of that. Tried everything with only the most basic software on it. Nothing seems to fix it.\n\nSince I have these issues on both identical motherboards it is most likely safe to assume that it is not the motherboard. And it would be unlikely that both mainboards became more faulty over time.\n\nAn RMA for a refund would be great and helpful! The I9-13900K was a disappointment for me to be honest. But I am an Intel costumer for over two decades now. One flawed release will not make me turn to the competition since I bought plenty of Intel CPUs and never had these issues before. The I9-14900K is using the same socket isn´t it? And people have not reported the same issues with it compared to the I9-13900K I could just buy the 14900K after the refund.\n\nSince I work with one of these computers this would be a better solution than having to face this mess again after a few months due to it not working for long with default BIOS settings.\n\nBut I never had an RMA case before. How would that work?"
