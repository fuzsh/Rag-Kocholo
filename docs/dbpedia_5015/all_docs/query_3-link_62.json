        "text": "This is a question regarding the viability of getting Blender to run on said workstations… I wasn’t sure where on the forum to put it, so it ended up here\n\nIntro(skip this if you don’t want the background)\n\nAt the Architecture School from which I’m(hopefully) soon to graduate, in the Chilean Santa María University, we have about a dozen of old SGI O2 Workstations. Ours is a very new school,(founded circa 1996), and from early on it decided to be heavily devoted to digital design(Santa María being a Technical Universiry). It opted for Alias(-Wavefront back then)'s Studio Tools as our designated software, hence the purchase of the workstations. Nowadays, with StudioTools and Maya(now the property of Autodesk) running on PC’s, and since the Amazing specs of the Workstations don’t seem so amazing after 10 years, the O2’s are stowed away someplace gathering dust, since 2001 or 2002. But now some professors have wondered what would the viability of putting these machines in use again. The idea is to see whether or not they can run on Linux(to replace their native IRIX, not sure why), and that, together from the fact that there’s no way the school can afford another Maya license for Linux machines, means Blender will probably be the only decent 3D app for us to toy with(I love Wings3D but I see little architectural potential in it for the moment… though I said the same of Blender not so long ago).\n\nI’m pretty excited about this, because even if Linux and open source in general are quite commonplace on the academic world of engineering, it is still rare(or at least uncommon) for an Architecture School to get to toy with open software. Of course, this workstations, if activated, would be some sort of “side dish” to our computer lab, and not the main course, but still it would help me to spread the word and advance our cause of world domination…\n\nQUESTIONS…\n\nand now what I wanted to know… Well, first of all, I’ve never used one of this machines, and I don’t know how they would stand by today standards. I’ve searched wikipedia and read their specs and some figures look good, others look bad. The other thing I noticed is that apparently there is no complete Linux port, but both OpenBSD and NetBSD have been completely ported. Now I’m probably the most software savvy student of my school… and I’ve barely got Ubuntu to run on my PC, so the idea of trying the BSD’s frightens me a little. So, in short:\n\nHas anyone done something akin to this, with these or similar machines?\n\nDoes anyone know the best OS to use(or if it would be wiser to keep IRIX)\n\nCan anyone anticipate how smoothly would they run?\n\nand last and more importantly,\n\n-Do you think I can get Blender to run on those machines? I’m guessing the 64-bit version? yes, no? Would this need some special port?"
