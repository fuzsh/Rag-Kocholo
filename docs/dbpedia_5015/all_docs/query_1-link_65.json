        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (July 12, 2001)-SGI’s long-time customer Tippett Studio created more\n\nthan 60 3D-animated shots for Warner Brothers’ Cats & Dogs and over 150 3D-animated\n\nshots-plus 15 all-CGI 3D creatures-for DreamWorks SKG’s Evolution, using a powerful\n\ncombination of high-performance IRIXÂ®, LinuxÂ® and Windows NTÂ® OS-based workstations,\n\nservers and storage from SGI. Academy Award winner for visual effects for the films Jurassic Park\n\nand Return of the Jedi, Tippett Studio relied on its recent purchase of 10 Silicon GraphicsÂ®\n\nOctane2TM IRIX OS-based visual workstations, 25 Silicon GraphicsÂ® 230 and Silicon GraphicsÂ®\n\n330 Windows NT OS-based and Linux OS-based workstations, an SGITM 2100\n\nhigh-performance visualization server and a 2TB SGITM TP9400 storage system, in addition to\n\npreviously purchased Silicon GraphicsÂ® O2Â® workstations and SGITM ChallengeÂ® and SGITM\n\nOriginTM family servers. “This was the first time we had IRIX, Linux and Windows NT workstations from SGI all working on\n\nthe same production,” said Eric Leven, Tippett Studio’s CG supervisor on Evolution. “We started\n\nwith a large number of Silicon Graphics O2 workstations and a render farm made up primarily of\n\nSGI Origin 200 servers. Later we added a smaller number of dual-processor Silicon Graphics\n\nOctane2 workstations and, for the first time in the shop, we began using Windows NT and Linux\n\noperating systems running on Silicon Graphics 230 and 330 visual workstations. Compositors used\n\n10 Linux OS-based machines from SGI with 20 processors to run Nothing Real Shake and\n\nadditional processors to run Pixar RenderMan. The animators used the Silicon Graphics 230\n\nworkstations, and we found that those boxes gave us the best performance from Alias|Wavefront\n\nMaya on Windows NT. The technical director, the paint artists and the modelers used Maya and\n\nAlias StudioPaint software on the IRIX OS-based O2 and Octane2 workstations. Then everything\n\nwas networked together and rendered on SGI Origin family servers.”\n\nTippett Studio designed all the visual effects sequences in Evolution, including 15\n\nnever-before-seen creatures. Maquettes were sculpted from the final creature designs and\n\nscanned into Silicon Graphics O2 and Octane2 visual workstations using a 3D laser scanner. The\n\ndigitized creatures were then refined and manipulated by Tippett Studio’s world-class character\n\nanimators. The studio’s 120-plus Evolution crew also created many other unique CG effects to\n\naccomplish the 150-shot production, from the seemingly adorable dog sequence to the\n\napocalyptic finale-all created on its networked mix of SGITM high-performance visual\n\nworkstations. SGI technology was key to finishing the immense project on time. According to\n\nLeven, “From the very beginning of preproduction to the last shot was about 11 months, from July\n\n2000 to June 2001, which was a crazy schedule. I think we were averaging about six shots every\n\nweek for the entire duration of production. It was absolutely the shortest schedule we ever worked\n\non.”\n\nFor the live-action Cats & Dogs, which turns the age-old animosity between house pets into a\n\nfull-scale war, Tippett’s 50-artist team again used the full complement of SGI high-performance\n\nworkstations to create 60 shots of digital cats, primarily to replace the live-action cats’ heads to\n\nanimate facial expressions. Using Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstations, Tippett created two CGI\n\ndogs, including a digital beagle who catches a boomerang, is propelled around a room and lands\n\nat the feet of a digital cat, where a fight ensues. On the Silicon Graphics O2, 230 and 330 visual\n\nworkstations, artists also designed a 3D CGI version of the mercenary villain, called “the\n\nRussian,” who is a Russian Blue kitten outfitted in a CGI weapons vest complete with guns and\n\nknives.\n\nScott Souter, Tippett Studio’s co-visual effects supervisor with Blair Clark on Cats & Dogs, said\n\nthe producer’s primary directive was photo-real animation-the stock-in-trade of the Berkeley,\n\nCalif. facility, which has used SGI technology since it opened in 1983. “Our studio came into play\n\nbecause of our history with naturalistic, yet fantastical, animation. Our ability to blend those two\n\ncharacteristics, to keep something real-adhering to enough physics to keep it believable and\n\nnatural-yet be able to take the character beyond and into the realm of, in this case, very\n\nacrobatic, highly specialized fantastical animations is a very large part of our trade,” said Souter.\n\nTo truly achieve photo-realistic animals, Tippett Studio’s in-house research and development\n\nteam created its own fur software. “We linked the fur software between Maya and RenderMan; it’s\n\na little thing that bridges the gap between the two,” explained Souter. “It was just for fur and fur\n\ncurve information, written primarily on Silicon Graphics O2 systems.”\n\nSouter noted that Cats & Dogs compositors and animators were just as pleased with the Linux and\n\nWindows NT OS-based Silicon Graphics 230 and 330 visual workstations, as were the artists who\n\nworked on Evolution. “We started production on the IRIX OS-based O2 workstations, and then\n\ntoward the middle and end of production we started animating in Maya on the Windows NT\n\nOS-based workstations from SGI,” Souter said. “That worked out very well. It’s definitely the\n\nchoice of our animators, because Maya seems to perform better on Windows NT boxes from SGI.”\n\n“Tippett Studio’s technological Evolution-the networking of IRIX, Linux and Windows NT\n\nOS-based workstations from SGI-creates a powerful production pipeline that enables artists to\n\ncomplete an amazing amount of content creation and effects work to meet seemingly impossible\n\ndeadlines,” said Greg Estes, vice president of corporate marketing, SGI. “Tippett’s continued\n\nchoice of SGI technology to meet the ever-increasing demands of visual effects production is\n\ntestimony to the power of SGI’s strategy to be the computer company for the entertainment\n\nindustry-regardless of operating system. We are particularly pleased that the Linux OS-based\n\nworkstations from SGI played such an important role in these two summer blockbuster films.”\n\nAbout Tippett Studio\n\nLocated in Berkeley, Calif., Tippett Studio was founded in 1983 by President Phil Tippett and his\n\npartners Jules Roman, vice president and executive producer, and Craig Hayes, creative director\n\nand visual effects supervisor. The studio has more than 125 artists, designers, engineers,\n\ntechnical directors and animators. A visual effects and animation studio for feature films, Tippett\n\nStudio has won two Academy Awards for visual effects (Return of the Jedi and Jurassic Park) and\n\ntwo Emmys (Dinosaur! and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor) and has received Academy Award\n\nnominations for visual effects for five other feature films (Starship Troopers, Dragonheart, Willow,\n\nDragonslayer, and Hollow Man). Tippett Studio has also received an Academy Award for\n\ntechnical achievement in the development of a motion-input device for motion capture. Tippett\n\nStudio is currently working on the vampire movie sequel Blade II and will soon be lending its\n\ntalents to commercials. The studio is also preparing to expand into producing full-length animated\n\nfeature films and mixed live-action and CGI features.\n\nAbout SGI\n\nSGI, also known as Silicon Graphics, Inc., is a technology solutions provider with a broad range\n\nof high-performance computing, advanced graphics, and consulting services that enable its\n\ntechnical and creative customers to maintain a competitive advantage in their core businesses.\n\nWhether being used to design and build safer cars and airplanes, discover new medications and\n\noil reserves, helping us to understand and better predict the weather, or entertain us with the\n\nthrilling movie special effects, SGI systems and expertise are empowering of a world of innovation\n\nand discovery.
