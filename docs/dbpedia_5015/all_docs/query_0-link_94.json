        "text": "SGI Inventor File Format Summary\n\nAlso Known As: IRIS, 3D Interchange File Format\n\nType 3D scene description Colors Unlimited Compression Uncompressed Maximum Image Size Unlimited Multiple Images Per File Yes Numerical Format NA Originator Silicon Graphics Platform UNIX Supporting Applications Many See Also SGO\n\nUsage\n\nKnown primarily through SGI's IRIS Inventor system.\n\nComments\n\nSGI Inventor was designed for the exchange of 3D modeling information between software applications.\n\nVendor specifications are available for this format.\n\nCode fragments are available for this format.\n\nThe SGI Inventor file format was first released in July 1992 by Silicon Graphics, and was specifically designed for the exchange of 3D modeling information between software applications. It has been used by CAD, chemistry, financial data, scientific visualization, art history, earth sciences, creative, presentation, architecture, animation, and other applications.\n\nContents:\n\nFile Organization\n\nFile Details\n\nFor Further Information\n\nThe SGI Inventor file format was created as part of the IRIS Inventor 3D Toolkit. The toolkit is an object-oriented 3D class library for the C and C++ languages that enables programmers to write interactive 3D graphics programs. IRIS Inventor's file format is used by a large assortment of 3D applications, such as SGI's Showcase, SGI's Explorer Scientific Visualization System, Industrial Light and Magic's animation system, SDRC, Parametric Technology, and many more.\n\nThe toolkit is based on an object-oriented database (OODB) to represent a 3D hierarchical scene. The scene database contains many types of objects, such as groups, transformations, labels, materials, drawing styles, cameras, lights, 18 different geometry types, and so on. And because SGI Inventor is object-oriented, the file format can be extended to support custom objects. The SGI Inventor file format therefore is an ASCII version of a scene database.\n\nFile Organization\n\nThe SGI Inventor file format may write either binary or ASCII data, depending on how the file is to be used. The data in both file types are machine-independent. The internal format of the Inventor binary format is proprietary and cannot be discussed in depth in this article.\n\nSGI Inventor ASCII files contain only 7-bit, ASCII information and are parsed just as any other text file would be when read. Each line of information in an Inventor ASCII file is terminated by a linefeed (ASCII 0Ah) character. Lines beginning with the # are comments and are generally ignored.\n\nInventor ASCII files contain the following header signature:\n\n#Inventor V1.0 ascii\n\nwhile Inventor binary files contain the following header signature:\n\n#Inventor V1.0 binary\n\nAlthough these signatures may vary in design in future versions of the Inventor file formats, they will never be longer than 80 characters and will always begin with the # comment character.\n\nFile Details\n\nFollowing the header signature is a series of data nodes that contain the actual rendering information. All information in an Inventor file is conceptualized as objects called nodes. Nodes may contain other nodes (called child nodes) and may also be grouped into collections of nodes called graphs. The syntax for a node is as shown below:\n\nnodename { fieldname1 value1 value2 fieldname2 value1 value2 value3 fieldname3 fieldnameN value }\n\nA node contains a node name followed by a series of data field names and data field values. The fields may appear in any order within a node and are not written out if their values are the default values for the field. The fields of a node are always enclosed in braces.\n\nNodes may also contain other nodes called child nodes:\n\nnodename { fieldname1 value fieldname2 value fieldnameN value childnode1 { fieldname1 value fieldname2 value fieldnameN value } childnode2 { fieldname1 value fieldname2 value fieldnameN value } }\n\nThe values in each field are defined for each node. A field may contain one or more values. Each value is separated by a white space character. A field containing multiple groups of values surrounds the entire grouping with brackets, and commas separate each group; for example:\n\nnodename { fieldname1 value1 value2 value3 fieldname2 [ value1a value1b value1c, value2a value2b value2c ] }\n\nThe format used to write field values depends upon their data type, as shown below:\n\n100 Integers 100.0 Floating-point 1.0e2 Floating-point \"name\" Strings mnemonic Enumerations and bit fields ~ Ignore this field\n\nA field name which contains a tilde (~) for a value is ignored by the SGI Inventor file reader. The following is a fragment of an SGI Inventor ASCII file:\n\nSeparator { Normal { vector 0 1 0 } Material { ambientColor 0.2 0.2 0.2 ~ diffuseColor 0.720949 0.714641 0.492981 specularColor 0.2 0.2 0.2 ~ emissiveColor 0 0 0 ~ shininess 0 ~ transparency 0 ~ } Coordinate3 { point [ 0.0 0.0 0.0, # 0 1.0 0.0 0.0, # 1 1.0 1.0 0.0, # 2 2.0 0.0 0.0, # 3 2.0 1.0 0.0, # 4 2.0 1.0 0.0, # 5 3.0 0.0 0.0, # 6 ] } IndexedTriangleMesh { coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1 ] } }\n\nEach node stored in an Inventor file represents a 3D shape, property, or grouping. All SGI Inventor nodes are divided into five classes:\n\nShape\n\nProperty\n\nGroup\n\nLight\n\nCamera\n\nShapes include geometric objects. Properties are the qualitative aspects of the objects. Group indicates the type of organization applied to one or more nodes. Light and Camera information affect the appearance of the rendered image.\n\nThe following list contains the Inventor nodes grouped by class:\n\nShape:\n\nCone IndexedNurbsCurve PointSet Cube IndexedNurbsSurface QuadMesh Cylinder IndexedTriangleMesh Sphere FaceSet LineSet Text2 IndexedFaceSet NurbsCurve Text3 IndexedLineSet NurbsSurface TriangleStripSet\n\nProperty:\n\nBaseColor MatrixTransform Texture2 Complexity Normal Texture2Transform Coordinate3 NormalBinding TextureCoordinate2 Coordinate4 NurbsProfile TextureCoordinateBinding DrawStyle PackedColor TextureCoordinateCube Environment PickStyle TextureCoordinateCylinder Font ProfileCoordinate2 TextureCoordinateEnvironment Info ProfileCoordinate3 TextureCoordinateFunction Label ResetTransform TextureCoordinatePlane LightModel Rotation TextureCoordinateSphere LinearProfile RotationXYZ Transform Material Scale Translation MaterialBinding ShapeHints Units\n\nGroup:\n\nArray LayerGroup Separator CustomNode MultipleCopy Switch File PathSwitch Group Selection\n\nLight:\n\nDirectionalLight PointLight SpotLight\n\nCamera:\n\nOrthographicCamera PerspectiveCamera\n\nFor Further Information\n\nFor further information about the SGI Inventor format, see the following documents included on the CD-ROM.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc., How to Write an IRIS Inventor File Translator, Release 1.0.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc., How to Write an Open Inventor File Translator, Release 2.0.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc., IRIS Inventor Nodes Quick Reference Guide, Release 1.0.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc., IRIS Inventor Nodes Quick Reference Guide, Release 2.0.\n\nInformation on the SGI Inventor file format may also be found in the following document, available directly from Silicon Graphics:\n\nSGI Inventor Programming Guide, Volume I: Using the Toolkit.\n\nThe following book contains a chapter describing the SGI Inventor file format for Release 2.0:\n\nWernecke, Josie, The Inventor Mentor, Addision-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1994.\n\nFor additional information, contact:\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc\n\nAttn: Visual Magic Marketing\n\n2011 North Shoreline Blvd.\n\nMountain View, CA 94039-7311\n\nVoice: 800-800-4SGI\n\nFTP: ftp://sgi.com/sgi/inventor/\n\nWWW: http://www.sgi.com/Technology/Inventor/textonly.html\n\nYou can also contact:\n\nGavin Bell\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc.\n\nFAX: 415-390-6056\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nThis page is taken from the Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats and is licensed by O'Reilly under the Creative Common/Attribution license."
