This got me thinking about how most guys are stuck on selling a product even though customers want a personalized experience before sales even happen. I’m not sure if convincing customers of a product’s benefits still works. I feel it’s a shot in the dark. If I have learned anything in this business, it’s this – customers are looking for a great experience in the sales journey. Crafting it is our responsibility. I believe these three lessons have helped my organization excel at sales by delivering an exceptional experience - 1. Listen to your customers. It will help you uncover their hidden desires and pain points, which will help you serve the right solution at each step in their journey. 2. Don’t sell a product, sell an experience. Customers can find valuable products everywhere. Can you give them a memorable experience? Sales happen as a byproduct of building a delightful customer journey. 3. Build a relationship. As cliche as it sounds, I am a strong proponent of building a relationship with your customers. My customers are happy because I genuinely care for their needs. My organization has trained sales guys to deliver a personalized experience to every prospect and customer. It will inevitably lead to sales. #customerexperience #customersatisfaction #salesstrategy #salesleadership\n\n𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘁. 𝗢𝗿 𝘀𝗼 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀. Thousands of flights grounded, medical procedures halted, schools, offices, and even basic purchases in supermarkets had hiccups. Our daily routine was disrupted, and how! All this is because of a failed update on a server. We focus on business as usual, but in fact, it is life as usual that comes to a standstill. That's how dependent we have become dependent on technology, the internet. Is it a good thing or bad? We cannot really sit on judgment But it is definitely a thought to reflect. Now is the time to think about what backup plans we can put in place if a catastrophic incident like this, which in all likelihood will happen again in some form or the other. Covid showed us the fury of nature. This worldwide outage brought to light the fault lines in technology. A black swan can just swim by at its will, causing ripples beyond our control. Time to hope for the best and be prepared for the worst, isn't it? Pic Credit - Freepik.com\n\nAI is not really making the cyber world equal. Security threats continue to rise, enterprises continue to remain vulnerable. Hackers are making smart use of AI in orchestrating attacks. Businesses on the other hand are implementing AI tools to safeguard their systems and data. In this game, who will have the upper hand? In my recent conversations with some CISOs, the concerns regarding the effectiveness of tools are coming up quite a lot. Perhaps the challenge lies elsewhere. Ad hoc security patches are in fact part of the problem. Investments are being made but a cohesive security roadmap is still a work in progress. If miscreants can get creative with technologies, there is no question why we cannot play our hands well. Won't you agree? #AI #cyberattack #cybersecurity #cyberthreat\n\nIt's a race against time. Enterprises worldwide are rushing to migrate to S4/HANA before SAP ECC slips into sunset mode. However as per Gartner at the current pace, slightly more than half of 35,000 ECC customers are likely to meet the deadline. That doesn't sound promising enough, right? If you are still on fences, the time to make a decision is now. You will find some clear perspectives in this blog. https://lnkd.in/giw8tY4x\n\nConversations around cloud investments are changing. What began as a cost-saving exercise has come to cost dearly over a period of time. I met the CIO of a major healthcare company in Toronto last week. We were discussing the ways to secure their patient data while bringing a higher level of personalization. Interestingly, we spent the evening talking about the best ways to optimize their investments in the cloud. Turns out that the strategy was not thought through well. While some workloads were moved to the private cloud, others, more sensitive ones were on the public cloud. No wonder their spending outweighs the gains by miles. A planned approach that goes beyond immediate concerns and has farsight towards emerging business needs must precede any cloud deployment. Many companies rush to make initial cost savings but lose sight of optimization opportunities. How do you prioritize your investments, immediate cost savings, or long-term optimization? #cloudcomputing #cloudinvestment #cloudoptimization pic credit - freepik\n\nCybersecurity is now a major concern for all organizations across the globe.
