        "text": "Trygve.Com > Images > \"Weird World of Hardware\" Translate this page:\n\nI don't usually wear one of these things\n\nHonest.\n\nTrygve.Com sitemap\n\nwhat's new FAQs\n\ndiary\n\nimages\n\nexercise\n\nsingles\n\nhumor\n\nrecipes\n\nmedia\n\nweblist\n\ninternet\n\ncompanies\n\ncommunity\n\nvideo/mp3 comment\n\ncontact\n\nit's not just for storing soda in anymore\n\nNormally, even the coolest SGI workstations run pretty hot and their servers, well, if you used them for serving tea, you wouldn't have to worry about the tea cooling off in between cups.\n\nBut at its debut, the Onyx 3200 ran cooler and quieter than any of SGI's previous offerings, mostly because the circuits to power this particular computational beast hadn't been installed. Ooops. Turns out that this model likes to have a couple of 220volt circuits all to itself, something one doesn't normally expect to see from anything other than large mainframes and Krell amplifiers.\n\nI have no idea whether Dan D'Agostino had been consulted in the design of the Onyx series. My guess is \"not,\" but you can never be entirely sure about these things.\n\nMy rather modest complement of SGI gear is more antiquated (the O2 and an Origin 200), but at least they can be run without modifications to the local power distribution system and the Origin 200 uses barely any more power than an ordinary handheld blow drier.\n\nIt's just that, with an Origin 200 server, you don't turn it off, so it keeps blowing, and blowing, and blowing....\n\nIt's not like I don't have my own share of imposingly monolithic computers that are presently dedicated to providing support for such diverse applications as vases, floral arrangements, and a lot of interesting minerals and fossils.\n\n- and by \"fossils,\" I do mean the \"prehistoric life form\" type, not something made by, say, Data General.\n\nBut the uses for computing equipment aren't limited merely to tasteful home decorating. For starters, the sartorial applications of computer equipment are, if not endless, at least more than two.\n\nas featured in Geek's Quarterly\n\n(BTW, the red-bordered studs shown in the photograph above are TO-220 heat sinks.)\n\nOne of the less obsolete arrivals out here on the Island of Misfit Servers (or \"Leaf-Node,\" if you prefer) is \"Tenaya,\" the almost mythical Sun Enterprise T3120 1U server:\n\nFront view of the Sun Sparc Enterprise T3120 server\n\nBack view of the Sun Sparc Enterprise T3120 server\n\nWidely announced but never released, Tenaya was supposed to come out as a lower-cost alternative to Sun's family of pricier \"Coolthreads\" systems. Few people have ever seen one in person and lived to tell the tale, and there are precious few pictures of a real live T3120 to be found anywhere on the net, so I'm putting some up myself to change that.\n\nWrapped around Sun's second generation Niagara T2 processor, Tenaya sports 8 CPU cores, 64 simultaneous threads, 32GB FB-DIMM RAM, and a couple of expansion slots including a pair of low-profile x8 PCI-express slots and slots for a duet of Sun's flash modules (which I won't be getting unless I find an amazing deal on them) and, oh yes, an upward-facing USB port that's about half an inch below the cover justting upwards right in the middle of the mainboard. You could put one of those super-short USB drives on it--the kind that's barely bigger than the connector itself--but most USB drives, including all the ones shaped like cute animals, are not going to fit.\n\nOn top of Tenaya...\n\n...and a peek inside the enterprise\n\nA better look at the Sun Sparc Enterprise T3120 server motherboard\n\nYou get only a single pair of gigabit ports (as opposed to the quartet found in the T1-based T1000 and T2000 boxes or the other T2-based T5120 and T5140 machines) and no 10GbE ports at all. But if your networking needs are modest enough, that can still be enough. To be fair, most of the computers--even the lastest and greatest ones--that you'll find in a typical Best Buy don't have 10GbE either. Even if it is a bit stripped down compared to the models that were actually released, packing 64 threads into a 1u case wasn't so bad, at least for its time.\n\nUm, the designer drank what...?\n\n...the screwdriver, please....\n\nFortunately, not so very far from the shelf in the home warehouse where the Dialogic box went back to, after its fifteen kilobytes of fame were uploaded, I happen to have a fine collection of wonderfully overbuilt power supplies that had been intended for the Fort St. Vrain nuclear power facility, but were never installed. They're a little bigger than most of the regulated power supplies I've built for my own analog design projects, but doesn't it give you a warm feeling somewhere deep inside when you know that the preamp you're using has a power supply approved for use in a nuclear power plant?\n\nUpdate: I got a note from Lon <mymailpale@gmail-com> who writes:\n\nI saw your pics of the super high-end IBM display card from 1985 that used 3 full slots and also curious on its performance. Heres what I dug up.\n\nIntroduced in 1984, and obsoleted by 1987, the Professional Graphics Controller (often called \"Professional Graphics Adapter\" and sometimes \"Professional Graphics Array\") offered slightly higher resolution and color depth than the EGA, up to 640 x 480 and 256 colours at 60 frames/second. It was intended for the computer-aided design market and included 320 kB of display RAM and an on-board microprocessor, which gave it the ability to do 3D rotation and clipping of images. While never widespread in consumer-class personal computers. US$4,290\n\nThanks, Lon!\n\nIt's funny to note that--thanks to Crossfire and SLI--the latest and greatest 3D video cards once again occupy multiple slots and employ a bridge connector. Bet they're a little faster, though.\n\nEven so, it's a good idea to have this kind of equipment on hand, just in case you happen to be hosting an international symposium less than sixteen hours after the film crew has finished shooting several movie scenes throughout your house--and at the last minute you find out that the network hardware for the computers to be used at the symposium hadn't been arranged for after all.\n\nAdmittedly, that's only happened to me once so far, but I figure, \"better safe than sorry.\""
