        "text": "InsideHPC brings us the shocking news that SGI, the oldest of graphics companies that hasn’t done any graphics lately, is returning to its roots a bit and announcing their “new” VUE suite of products. I put “new” in quotes because I distinctly remember the VUE products from abou 5 years ago. But insightful John Leidel noticed that perhaps this announcement went a bit deeper:\n\nI spent about then minutes flying through presenations from their VP of viz, Bob Pette, when I noticed something interesting. The logo was no longer the singular sgi cube [affectionately called the “Bug Logo”], but rather it actually contained “Silicon Graphics.” Plot thickens. Is SGI going back to its roots, not only in graphics, but in corporate logo as well?\n\nI’ve not seem much success in the VUE line in the past, as it seemed more gimmicky than functional. However, maybe this new version will change that. Their SoftVUE, PowerVUE, RemoteVUE trio seems to be a stab at systems like HP’s Scalable Visualization, which I looked at several years ago and passed on. The other tools are, from what I remember, primarily hardware accelerated live-video viewing tools, so they’re honest in saying you can view data from any source, because you’re getting those sources as video streams live in your view, and then you can overlay, stretch, and warp them around. It’s a neat way to merge disparate systems like Google Maps and live video streams, or CAD and Simulation outputs, but there’s no cross-talk between the applications.\n\nHopefully this new release not only signals some new features to these tools, but a newfound thrust without SGI towards reinstating the “G” in their name"
