        "text": "1.3 - Computer Graphics - A Brief HistoryÂ¶\n\nThe first computer graphics design system was developed by Evan Sutherland as his PhD thesis at MIT in 1963. It was called Sketchpad and allowed a user to sketch a mechanical part on a computer screen, place constraints on the part, and have the computer calculate the exact design of the part. It was revolutionary and computer graphics took off “as a thing” from that time forward."
