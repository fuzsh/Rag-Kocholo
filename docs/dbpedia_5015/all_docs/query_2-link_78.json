        "text": "Once Upon A Time I used to live and work in Silicon Valley.\n\nOkay, it was nearly 20 years ago. I was in my 20s, I was young, idealistic, and heavily involved in the computer industry.\n\nLike many of my generation we pledged our lives, first marriages and immortal souls for a shot at working for the biggest computer companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhy? Because it was totally cool.\n\nFrom my vantage point I was a witness to history – I was there when the World Wide Web was born. I was there when 64-bit game systems first came out, I got to see some truly amazing innovations foisted on the world that are as commonplace now as a telephone and about as easy to use.\n\nMy resume reads like Who’s Who of Silicon Valley. You name the company and chances are at some point in my life during the 90s I worked for them.\n\nApple, Hewlett-Packard, Borland, Intel, Microsoft, IBM….\n\nSee, back then hardly anybody I knew had permanent employment. You worked contract, which meant you were a temp. You went in, you did your job and then you moved on.\n\nAnd that’s what I did. I made an obscene pile of money in a short period of time. Granted, I had no health insurance, job security or retirement benefits of any kind but I was raking in some pretty good dough back then.\n\nI was also living the dream – working and living in the center of the technological universe. I had a pretty cool apartment, a smoking hot girlfriend and we always ate out at the best establishments in the area every night of the week.\n\nOne of the places I ended up at was quite possibly the greatest of them all, a Silicon Valley company leviathan whose computer systems roamed (and ruled) the earth much like the dinosaurs of old.\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) was the leader in high-end computer systems and it would have been next to impossible to find anyone who hadn’t been touched by their technology.\n\nBack in the 1990s, it was the engine that drove the Hollywood machine with it’s workstations as common as highly-paid actors.\n\nThe list of movies SGI technology helped propel to blockbuster levels is staggering: Star Wars (Episode I), The Matrix, Jurrasic Park, Terminator 2, The Crow, Lord of The Rings and Starship Troopers (just to name a few).\n\nAll boosted by SGI-created special effects.\n\nSGI was also one of those companies that made geek chic and technology cool. After Jurrasic Park came out, everybody wanted to work at SGI.\n\nWearing a T-Shirt with an SGI logo on it made you the center of attention.\n\nWorking at SGI was both surreal and amazing. It’s Mountain View campus, nestled right next to the Shoreline Ampitheatre was beautiful, harmonious (I remember spending my lunch hours in the park in the center of campus and found it a great place to unwind) and well kept.\n\nIt was also the envy and goal of every technological firm in Silicon Valley – they didn’t want to just be like us, they wanted to be us.\n\nFor nearly a year I was contractual temp worker for this amazing company and while I never got hired permanently there (hey, why tank my independent status?) I personally built hundreds of those beautiful high-end workstations that are most likely still in use to this day by the biggest Hollywood studios.\n\nI worked in Building 11, also known as IMSD – Integration and Manufacturing Solutions Division on the high-end workstation line (yup, the place where those amazing machines were built) and a typical day started at 7:30 AM where I’d first take inventory of all the hardware components (boards and hard drives) in my area. From there, I would be handed build orders to begin piecing together systems to specification per the client’s orders (and what a client list it was – the biggest names in defense, aerospace and entertainment!).\n\nThis section of the work was called, aptly enough, Integration – the “I” in IMSD.\n\nWell, I didn’t think that was sexy enough. It was sort of monotonous and not nearly entertaining enough for my brain so one day, on a slow afternoon, I took matters into my own hands and took a seat at the Systems Test area.\n\nNow THIS was pod racing!\n\nImagine a line of 12 high-end SGI Challenge and Onyx systems (six on each bank) running diagnostic tools to pinpoint which board on these computers needed replacing.\n\nIt was pretty straightforward: you moved a workstation into an empty bank on the test line, plugged it in, power cycled it (by turning it on and off several times) and if flames or smoke didn’t shoot out the back of it (sometimes they would, and that always provided entertainment for everyone else on the floor) or if it just didn’t flat out fail you’d then walk back to your master console and began issuing startup commands to each workstation.\n\nIf the workstation failed to boot properly you would then walk back over to it, power it down, remove the offending board, replace with a new one, power it up, walk back over to the master console and issue your startup commands.\n\nLather, rinse and repeat about 12 times.\n\nFrom this point you would watch your console sessions for each workstation as the board test scripts (yes, this was all done in UNIX) would begin a battery of tests on each board. The Challenge and Onyx systems had boards that were dedicated to a specific function of the workstation.\n\nIf the script reported a problem with a specific board you would stop the test, power down the workstation, remove the offending board, replace with a new one and restart. This would go on for about 8 to 10 hours a day, sometimes 12, 14, 16 or maybe even 20 depending on how close to the end of the quarter it was where the whole company would turn into a madhouse as we scrambled to get those orders out the back door on time.\n\nOn a Challenge system, it was just memory card (MC3), a processor board (IP19) and an input/output (IO4) board but it could be scaled to multiple MCs and multiple IPs. These workstations were typically built as servers.\n\nOh yeah, they came in two flavors – Eveready, a deskside model (if you’ve ever seen the size of this model you’d never wonder why it was called a deskside. This thing was the size of a small refrigerator!) or Terminator, a rackmount model (it, too, was the size of a standard kitchen refrigerator).\n\nThe Onyx RealityEngine2, on the other hand, were a bit more complex in their design (well, if you’re gonna make that T1000 morph into a puddle of liquid metal it had better be).\n\nThis little puppy came loaded with all the goodies – aside from the standard MC3 memory board usually loaded to the gills with as much memory as you could stack (that being 2GB – hey, that was serious memory capacity in 1994!)\n\nDepending on if you ordered a rackmount (Terminator) system, you could have up to six (count ’em) IP19 boards each with uni, bi or quad MIPS R4400 processors running at a screaming 150MHz (again, this was powerful stuff, circa 1994).\n\nA fully loaded Terminator on the processing and memory side would sport 2GB of RAM and 24 CPUs.\n\nBut the real heart of the Onyx was its graphics capabilities: the GE12 (a Geometry Engine board with twelve on-board processors), the RM4 (a raster manager), and the DG2 (display generator).\n\nThis is where the magic happened.\n\nLike the dinosaurs that SGI helped bring to life in the movie Jurrasic Park, the systems we created were big and cumbersome compared to the smaller, sleeker and more nimble systems of the competitors that were to follow.\n\nIf you consider evolutionary models, these majestic leviathans were poised for extinction.\n\nSGI’s metaphorical KT killer came around the time when movie making started to become less expensive and more open to any film school sophmore who found that they could create the same quality effects with cheaper and smaller computers.\n\nSGI couldn’t evolve fast enough to adapt to this changing environment. It’s stock priced tumbled, layoffs mounted and even a desperate Hail Mary from a 2006 bankruptcy filing didn’t pan out.\n\nAs of April 1st, in what would have been an April Fools joke on folks like me, SGI announced that this time it was going into bankruptcy and never coming back.\n\nThey also announced they were selling off their assets to Rackable Systems, Inc. at the unbelievable fire sale price…\n\n…of 25 million dollars.\n\nThis is indeed a sad day.\n\nSGI was what really got me jazzed about working in the technology industry. SGI showed me what was possible by doing what was seemingly impossible at the time.\n\nSGI also inspired people all over the world to learn about this incredible technology. Were it not for SGI, many of the advancements we now enjoy today probably would still be a decade off or never realized.\n\nThe Mountain View campus is now occupied by Google, most of whose staff were barely in their teens when SGI ruled the roost (some, I venture, were probably just born).\n\nSGI leaves behind a rich and cool legacy in Silicon Valley, as well as some really fantastic DVDs."
