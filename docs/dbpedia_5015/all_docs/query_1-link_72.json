        "text": "The prediction, in brief:\n\nWhen the phone system was invented it was primarily for voice. We commercialized it when we began to use it for business, and we commercialized it further when we began to do data transfers over the wire, money transfers over telephone lines. It’s exactly the same thing. Commercialization of the Internet is as inevitable as the sun coming up tomorrow.\n\nPredictor: Clark, Jim\n\nPrediction, in context:\n\nIn a 1994 article for Wired magazine, Michael Goldberg interviews Mosaic executive and former Silicon Graphics Inc.
