        "text": "A survey of the computer gear used for editing and effects in Hollywood and the vidgame industry might lead one to believe that Silicon Graphics Inc. is devoted primarily to manufacturing digital compositing hardware. Attendees of this week’s E3 show, for instance, will see SGI in Nintendo’s booth demonstrating new game technology.\n\nBut the truth is, the entertainment industry segment represents a small slice of SGI’s overall pie: Only about 16% of SGI’s 1994 sales were in the entertainment field.\n\nThe lion’s share of SGI’s business actually falls in the manufacturing and scientific realm, with its systems in wide use in applications like CAD/CAM and visual simulation. But in SGI’s view, one industry feeds the other; whether you’re animating a car design or animating a character, the basic processes are the same.\n\nFrom the very start, SGI’s focus has been 3-D color graphics. The company originally grew out of a 1981 project conceived by then-Stanford professor Jim Clark to develop a computer system that could rapidly calculate and display 3-D color images. SGI proceeded to establish itself as a major player in the scientific and engineering marketplace, making its initial public stock offering in 1982.\n\nSGI’s involvement in entertainment began in 1989, when Industrial Light & Magic acquired four SGI systems to do animation work for “The Abyss.” Those original four systems (which are still in active use at ILM) have been joined by 200 more, and ILM has remained integrally involved with SGI’s entertainment ventures.\n\nWhile SGI didn’t initially set out to conquer the entertainment and gaming industries, it hasn’t been blind to the opportunities those areas present. Over the last year, SGI has made a number of moves designed to strengthen its position in what is now its fastest-growing market segment:\n\n* The establishment of Silicon Studio Inc., a new wholly owned subsidiary devoted to the entertainment business;\n\n* Silicon Studio Live, a blueprint for providing service, support and training to entertainment industry users;\n\n* The purchase of graphics software companies Alias and Wavefront;\n\n* A new training facility in Santa Monica geared toward the entertainment market; and\n\n* The Keystone initiative, a software standards consortium of developers and post houses, aimed at establishing an open programming environment for digital compositing tools on SGI platforms."
