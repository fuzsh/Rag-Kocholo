NEC Reports Financial Results For Q1. Netezza Secures $20M In Financing.\n\nSHORT TAKES\n\n08/01/03\n\nSGI REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS\n\nSGI announced results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2003, which ended June 27, 2003. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $240 million, compared with $217 million in the preceding quarter. Gross margin increased to 40.3% from 37.1% in the previous quarter.\n\nGAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $131 million, including $12.6 million in restructuring and non-cash impairment charges, compared with $128 million for the previous quarter. SGI’s fourth-quarter net loss on a GAAP basis was $36.6 million or $0.18 per share compared with $35 million or $0.17 per share from the third quarter. These results are consistent with the preliminary results announced on July 10, 2003.\n\n“Our fiscal year 2003 was a challenge. Although we have seen a sequential increase in our Q4 revenues and gross margin, we still need to take aggressive steps to reduce costs and to drive revenue from our new line of products,” said Bob Bishop, chairman and chief executive officer of SGI. As of June 27, 2003, unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investments were $141 million, which was unchanged from the previous quarter. Revenue for full fiscal year 2003 was $962 million, compared with $1.3 billion from fiscal year 2002. Net loss for the year was $130 million or $0.64 per share, compared with $46 million or $0.24 per share from the previous year.\n\nAbout SGI\n\nSGI, also known as Silicon Graphics, Inc., is the world’s leader in high- performance computing, visualization and storage. SGI’s vision is to provide technology that enables the most significant scientific and creative breakthroughs of the 21st century. Whether it’s sharing images to aid in brain surgery, finding oil more efficiently, studying global climate or enabling the transition from analog to digital broadcasting, SGI is dedicated to addressing the next class of challenges for scientific, engineering and creative users. SGI was named on FORTUNE magazine’s 2003 list of “Top 100 Companies to Work For.” With offices worldwide, the company is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., and can be found on the Web at http://www.sgi.com.\n\nNEC REPORTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR Q1\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Japanese economy saw some improvement of its financial stability through the injection of public funds and the recovery of the stock market during the latter part of the period. This has resulted in a gradual boost of confidence in the economy. However, the real economy of Japan still remained severe due to continuing deflation in Japan and growing concern regarding the United States economy.\n\nThe business environment surrounding NEC has also remained challenging since the previous fiscal year. There are, however, various positive signs due to the steadily growing popularity of broadband and mobile communications. In fact, broadband subscribers now exceed 10 million in Japan and the penetration rate of mobile phones has surpassed 60%.\n\nNEC has concentrated on optimizing its management structure to match the characteristics of individual business sectors, the innovation of its manufacturing process, and reducing materials cost. These steps are intended to reinforce NEC’s corporate structure so as to yield profits even in the midst of deflation. During the current fiscal year, NEC is implementing the following four strategies:\n\n1. Secure stable profits by strengthening core businesses.\n\n2. Eliminate down-side risk by improving loss making business areas.\n\n3. Rebuild a sound financial structure.\n\n4. Establish a growth strategy with IT/network integrated solutions.\n\nConsolidated net sales of NEC for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased by 9.5 billion yen, or 1%, to 1,030.7 billion yen as compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to increased sales in mobile communications products and social infrastructure business. Sales decreases were mainly in the areas of personal solutions and computer platforms.\n\nRegarding profits, there was a significant improvement during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year due mainly to lowering fixed expenses and promoting cost reductions. During this quarter as well, both the ratios of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses against net sales showed improvements. As a result, NEC recorded an operating income of 12.0 billion yen, an increase of 19.1 billion yen as compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.\n\nAs compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, income before income taxes decreased by 9.9 billion yen to 9.8 billion yen. The main reason for such a decrease was that NEC recorded a considerable amount of gain on the sale of marketable securities in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. NEC posted a net income of 0.7 billion yen, this is a decrease of 6.5 billion yen as compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. However, NEC recorded equity in losses of affiliated companies of 3.9 billion yen (an improvement of 1.0 billion yen as compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year) mainly due to the weak operating results of semiconductor-related affiliated companies.\n\nNETEZZA SECURES $20M IN THIRD ROUND OF FINANCING\n\nNetezza Corporation announced that it closed a round of financing totaling $20 million from top-tier venture capitalist firms. Led by California-based Sequoia Capital, the series C round includes previous investors Matrix Partners, Charles River Ventures, Battery Ventures and Orange Ventures, bringing the Company’s total funding to more than $53 million.\n\nThe Netezza Performance Server (NPS) system is the world’s first purpose- built, tera-scale data appliance optimized for business intelligence (BI). It delivers 10 to 20 times the performance for large, complex and constantly growing BI efforts at half the cost of existing data warehouse systems. The NPS system combines servers, storage and database into a single powerful and scalable appliance created from the outset to process queries faster — and enable complex data analysis that was not previously possible because of large and fast-growing data sizes.\n\n“Netezza continues to gain momentum in the marketplace, enabling customers to quickly analyze enormous amounts of information to make better, more strategic business decisions that were either too burdensome or just not possible with older systems,” said Jit Saxena, co-founder and CEO of Netezza. “The early traction that we are receiving in the market with our customer wins and the enthusiasm we heard from the investment community during this fund raising validate the power of the Netezza value proposition.”\n\nNetezza continues to receive widespread industry praise for its innovative technology, leadership and early momentum. Just last month, CEO and Co-founder Jit Saxena was named an Ernst & Young New England Entrepreneur Of The Year.

The testimonials from Netezza’s customers confirmed our belief that this company is transforming the marketplace and changing the way enterprises do business.”\n\nCo-founded by Jit Saxena and Foster Hinshaw in 2000, Netezza received more than $8 million in series A funding from Matrix Partners and Charles River Ventures.

Net income was $7.9 million or $.10 cents per diluted share, up from $1.2 million or $.02 cents per diluted share reported in the second quarter of 2002. Second quarter results benefited from previously announced revenue of approximately $6 million that was deferred from first quarter 2003.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2003, Cray reported total revenue of $105.9 million compared to $73.8 million last year. Net income for the first six months was $9.1 million or $.12 cents per diluted share compared to first half 2002 net income of $1.9 million and $.04 cents per diluted share respectively.\n\n“The first half of 2003 came in as planned, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the entire Cray team as well as our customers,” said Jim Rottsolk, Chairman and CEO of Cray Inc. “Improved profitability in the second quarter indicates we’re getting closer to our target business model and we are beginning to see the leverage in the model as revenue increases. With the Cray X1 system now in full-production mode, we are focused on product delivery and successfully meeting increasingly challenging customer acceptance tests for the second half of the year,” said Rottsolk.\n\nProduct margins in the second quarter improved due to higher volumes, lower component costs and improved yields. Service margins were negatively affected by bid costs associated with Cray’s successful DARPA funding award and by severance costs.\n\n“We used cash in the second quarter to retire remaining bank debt and to fund inventory and accounts receivable accompanying the growth of our business,” Rottsolk said. “The effect was exaggerated due to the timing of acceptances late in the quarter, and due to our decision to assemble large systems for software testing in advance of deliveries. The balance sheet strengthened during the second quarter, with working capital increasing by over $12 million. We expect strong positive cash flow in the second half the year,” Rottsolk said.\n\nAKAMAI REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS\n\nAkamai Technologies, Inc., a provider of services that enable the world’s leading enterprises and government agencies to extend and control their e- business infrastructure, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.
