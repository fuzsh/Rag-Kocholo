        "text": "If you were gaming in the mid-90's when Rareware started making waves with their new pre-rendered 3D sprite art style in games like Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country, then you might have heard of the Silicon Graphics workstations. They were expensive pieces of kit used in big-budget film special effects productions like Terminator 2 in the early-to-mid 90's, and Rare was the first developer to invest in the tech and put it to good use in games. They would render the character models, environments, and other in-game assets in 3D before converting them to 2D sprite keyframes, and the resulting look was a \"3D\" game that could run smoothly on hardware that lacked the power to handle polygonal rendering at a playable framerate.\n\nBut we all know what those games looked like. That's not what we're here to talk about. I'd like to discuss the high-res, pre-rendered artwork created with Silicon Graphics workstations that was used in promotional materials in the mid-90's. It had a very distinctive, hyper-reflective 90's 3D look that is unmistakable and beautiful in equal measure.\n\nI'm not sure how many people are into this look as much as I am, but I thought I'd broach the subject to find out. Here are some image galleries to demonstrate the kind of artwork I'm talking about.\n\nDonkey Kong Country Gallery\n\nKiller Instinct Gallery\n\nMario 64 Gallery\n\nI am not the biggest fan of most remakes in general, however, if we got remakes of some 90's 3D games, this is what I want. No modern fancy 3D. I want them the silicon workstation 90's 3D with the cool as heck mood as fuck lighting all in real time.\n\nIf they ever remade Mario 64, this is what I want. The promo shots.\n\nMario 64 Gallery\n\nI am not the biggest fan of most remakes in general, however, if we got remakes of some 90's 3D games, this is what I want. No modern fancy 3D. I want them the silicon workstation 90's 3D with the cool as heck mood as fuck lighting all in real time.\n\nIf they ever remade Mario 64, this is what I want. The promo shots.\n\nExactly what I was about to say. Hell, ever since that SM64 PC port was released I've always wanted to see if it was possible for modders to update the graphics to be more representative of the 90s promo art but I've just not found it (if it's been done yet). Even just taking in the reflective surface of Metal Mario, that's a pic that goes hard.\n\nExactly what I was about to say.

Even just taking in the reflective surface of Metal Mario, that's a pic that goes hard.\n\nWell you're in luck. There are several projects out there that are setting out to do just that. Here's one:\n\nBro WHAT\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nFUCK YES\n\nHere's a trailer for a much more recent build of Render96 than what was shown in the other video I linked:\n\nI also feel that any of the mods that enable ray-tracing make M64 look pretty similar to the promo art as well:\n\nHere's how Metal Mario looks with a ray-tracing mod:\n\nWell you're in luck. There are several projects out there that are setting out to do just that. Here's one:\n\nThat is really cool BUT still to bright and it looks more like a cosmetic change on the actual game. I meant, re-made ground up with Silicon Workstation promo visuals. That is what I want.\n\nSomething about the use of shadows, more muted color pallete of those promos.... just delicious to my eyes. Had this really cool plastique look to them that I loved as a kid.\n\nWell you're in luck. There are several projects out there that are setting out to do just that. Here's one:\n\nI'm playing this.\n\nIt has an HD texture pack designed to replicate the \"overdone\" style of the SGI promo renders, as well as remade worlds to make them look like they were made on SGI stations. It's In a more advanced state than those videos.\n\nWell you're in luck. There are several projects out there that are setting out to do just that. Here's one:\n\nNGL, when I heard the rumor about 3D All-Stars, this is what I was hoping they'd do. I was spoiled by the graphical overhaul of the OG All-Stars, assumed they'd do it again with the 3D games (although the only one that'd really benefit is 64, and barely at that because I think the polys are so charming).\n\nmy (new) dream game is a 3D platformer that makes full use of raytracing to perfectly capture the look of these silicon graphic pre-renders. like a playable cheesy CG pre-render from the 90s. what i imagined actual video game graphics to look like when i first saw these promo shots. that's my new dream lmao.\n\nstill gotta check out that mario 64 mod on pc that changes the textures to look more like the silicon graphics shots... it's not exactly what i want... but it's close!"
