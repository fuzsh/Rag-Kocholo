Silicon Graphics, Inc., generally known as SGI (though historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American manufacturer of high performance computing solutions, usually for rendering computer graphics.

SGI's products and solutions were widely used by the video game industry during the 1990s, most notably as the component of the Nintendo 64. For the first half of the 1990s, they were also widely used by Sega, at one point working on the graphics hardware for the Sega Saturn, before Sega of Japan stepped in and cancelled the contract.

Primarily SGI workstations were used across the video game industry to generate 3D renders, usually for promotional material, in-game video or in some cases, to create sprites with a pseudo 3D look.
