Alyson Stoner is one of many child stars who grew up in the spotlight. From starring in "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody," to "Camp Rock," the Disney Channel actress proved that she had the acting chops at a young age (via IMDb). And after showing off her dancing skills in "Step Up 3D" and a handful of music videos, including Missy Elliot's "Work It" and Eminem's "Just Lose It," Stoner amassed quite the net worth after establishing herself as a multi-talented performer (via Popsugar).

But behind-the-scenes, being famous as a kid is never all glitz and glam. Stoner opened up about her experience as a child star in a YouTube video describing it as both "weird and unhealthy." She explained, "it takes a huge toll on you. The competition, narcissism, perfectionism, the pressure, schedule, the traumatizing experiences that we can never talk about, because we're either under contract or we'll get shot or other things will happen to us if we open our mouths."

And aside from all of that? Stoner also had to grapple with navigating romantic relationships and coming to terms with her sexuality, all while knowing that her personal life was on public display. In a personal essay published by Teen Vogue, Stoner opened up about how falling in love with a special someone changed her life.

From Emily Osment and Kevin Jonas to David Henrie and Jason Earles, there are many famous Disney stars who dated regular people. Alyson Stoner is part of the club. When she was 24 years old, Stoner penned a personal essay in Teen Vogue about falling in love with a woman for the first time. The "Camp Rock" star was introduced to her great love one fateful day at a dance workshop. The woman in question was none other than Stoner's dance instructor. That same day, Stoner admitted to her mother and her best friend that she knew this woman would be a significant person in her life, she just didn't know what role she would play. "The question of whether she was a cool new friend or more kept me awake in wonderment and dread. I tried to be patient and stifle the emotions so I could think objectively. Our bond didn't feel quite sisterly or platonic," Stoner wrote.

The relationship between Stoner and her dance instructor flourished over time. Casual texting spiraled into spending evenings together which transcended into a romantic relationship. "I fell in love with a woman," the star revealed.

Alyson Stoner faced a lot of inner turmoil at the time of this relationship due to her religious beliefs. "My faith at that time played a large role in every aspect of my life, and my worldview neither supported nor accepted same-sex relationships. I prayed in turmoil nightly, begging to be healed from these desires," the actress shared with Teen Vogue. The "Phineas and Ferb" star even tried to engage in both conversion therapy and physical relationships with men to reverse her attractions.

The public nature of her profession didn't help matters. "Some people in the industry warned me that I'd ruin my career, miss out on possible jobs, and potentially put my life in danger if I ever came out," Stoner revealed.

Stoner struggled with coming to terms with her sexuality, but once she did, the actress felt like she was simultaneously hitting rock bottom and accepting who she was for the first time in her life. In the essay, the Disney Channel star revealed that "I, Alyson, am attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways. I can love people of every gender identity and expression. It is the soul that captivates me." In 2021, BuzzFeed included Stoner on a list of famous figures who identify as pansexual.

According to the essay Stoner published with Teen Vogue, the dancer is no longer dating the anonymous dance instructor, and there is no evidence that she has been in a serious relationship since. That said, the actress has opted to keep her romantic relationships fairly private over the years. In fact, of all of Stoner's relationships, the one that arguably received the most media attention was the actress's first. "The first boy that I had a crush on and dated was Cole Sprouse," Stoner spilled on "The Night Time Show" podcast.

The "Riverdale" star had recently been "involved" in another relationship before he began "dating" Stoner. Sprouse's ex was none other than another teenage superstar: Victoria Justice. Stoner recalled how Sprouse's relationship with the "Victorious" star always made her feel insecure. "Like, "She's a babe. What am I going to do? What do I have to offer? I play sports. I don't know. We were maybe 11," Stoner revealed.

Things didn't end well for the young co-stars. "He dumped me on my birthday," Stoner shared. While Sprouse could have issued a far more tactful break-up, it seems like that's all water under the bridge for Stoner. The actress wasn't afraid to jokingly call out her ex-beau. "What the hell, Cole?," the actress quipped. Since the "Suite Life of Zack and Cody" stars parted ways, Sprouse has spoken out about the unfair treatment of his Disney Channel female costars.
