Are you in the mood to sing, dance and just rock out? If so, you definitely want to tune into the premiere of Disney Channel’s newest original movie, Camp Rock, at 8:00 pm ET. The main cast of Camp Rock includes Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas, Demi Lovato, Alyson Stoner.

The movie is about a girl named Mitchie (Demi), an ambitious and talented girl who gets to attend Camp Rock, something she’s always wanted to do, but she has to work in the camp kitchen between her classes to help pay for the camp tuition. Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) is a cocky pop star whose band mates send him to be a guest teacher at this camp to bring his attitude back to earth. When Shane hears Mitchie singing from behind closed doors he sets out to match the amazing voice with the right girl.

Come back all weekend to chat with gals about what you liked, what you didn’t and whether or not you can get those catchy tunes outta your head.
