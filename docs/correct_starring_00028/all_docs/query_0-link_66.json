Aside from the former Disney Channel stars, the supporting cast also includes Sterling Sulieman, Adam Faison, Greer Grammer and Kimmy Shields.\n\nProduction for the film is expected to begin later this month. The project is financed by Watch the Footage Productions, the production company founded by Snyder and her husband, former “Kickin’ It!” actor Dylan Snyder. Watch the Footage produces with Exit Strategy, with individual producers include Allisyn Snyder, Montgomery and Exit Strategy’s Charles M. Barsamian. Dylan Snyder and Bob Morrison executive produce for Watch the Footage.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMontgomery is repped by 11:11 Entertainment. Ryan is repped by CAA and Industry Entertainment.
