In 2019, Martin made her professional London stage debut in The Actor's Nightmare at the Park Theatre in London.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin appeared in several community theater productions in Las Vegas such as Peter Pan and performed for her Showteam and later made her professional theater debut as Kendra in the Los Angeles production of 13 by Jason Robert Brown, directed by Todd Graff.[3][4]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin started her acting career in 2007, in television programs such as Nickelodeon's Just Jordan and CBS's Close to Home, as well as a guest stint in the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Martin was eventually cast as the lead antagonist Tess Tyler in the Disney Channel original film, Camp Rock, starring Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Martin was selected by TV Guide in 2008, as one of the \"13 Hottest Young Stars to Watch\".[5] She was the online host for the 2008 Disney Channel Games.\n\nMartin voiced the character Naminé in all subsequent releases in Kingdom Hearts series, replacing Brittany Snow, who did not return to the series. Martin starred in the ABC Family sitcom 10 Things I Hate About You as Bianca (originated by Larisa Oleynik in the film version) and received rave reviews for her performance in the series. Mike Hale of The New York Times described Meaghan as \"the high point of an excellent ensemble\".[6] She also played the role of Megan Kennedy in the independent film Dear Lemon Lima which received the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Woodstock Film Festival.[7] Martin returned to reprise her role as Tess Tyler in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, premiered on September 3, 2010, on Disney Channel.

Martin also played the role of Aubrey in the feature film Sironia.\n\nOn June 16, 2011, Martin appeared for one night in Super Summer Theatre's live production of \"Annie\" at Spring Mountain Ranch in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the role of Star-To-Be. Martin is also starring in the web series Wendy as the title character alongside Tyler Blackburn. Wendy is a dark twist on 'Peter Pan'. The series premiered on macys.com on September 15, 2011. In 2013, Martin appeared in the film adaptation Geography Club as Trish, earning a nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role at L.A. Outfest. Entertainment Tonight wrote \"Every year sees the release of one film so culturally important it should be required viewing. This year, that film is Geography Club\".[citation needed]\n\nLater in 2013, she appeared in the thriller The Good Mother which aired on Lifetime Channel and was cast as Julie #2 in MTV's Awkward, replacing Sophie Tilson. Martin voiced and motion-captured the character of Jessica in the PlayStation 4 exclusive Until Dawn opposite Rami Malek and Peter Stormare.\n\nPlayed the role of Sharon opposite Evan Peters and Juno Temple in the drama feature film Safelight, written and directed by Tony Aloupis.\n\nMartin trained as an actor in London, England.

The show is a dark satire exploring the entertainment industry. She starred in the world premiere production which played at London's Park Theatre, July 16 – August 10, 2019. The show received mixed reviews, though Martin received unanimously positive reviews for her performance, with The Stage writing \"Meaghan Martin - best known for film work - makes a strong stage debut here, nailing her part as a stand-up comic desperate for approval, wincing anxiously every time her laugh track plays\".[9] Michael Billington of The Guardian called Martin's performance \"Chilling\", writing: \"Meaghan Martin plays, with a marvellous mix of ingratiation and panic, a collapsing standup who pleadingly asks: 'Do you find me funny or disturbing?' On a lighter note, Martin also appears to great effect as a Hollywood hustler meeting a dithering dramatist\".[10]\n\nMartin starred in award-winning short films Wives of the Landed Gentry and British political satire Bad News which premiered at the 2020 London Independent Film Festival at Vue Cinema West End.[11] Martin played Henrietta in the video game Kosmokrats with actor Bill Nighy. Martin also appeared in Naked Times directed by Jake Kuhn, premiering at the Cannes Straight 8 Film Festival.[12]\n\nIn December 2020, Martin played Lucy in the LGBTQ+ drama radio series Hell Cats for Audible, directed by Kate Saxon, alongside Adetomiwa Edun, Jonathan Bailey, and Erin Doherty. The series was a Critics Pick for The Sunday Times.[13] Martin filmed the short Before Seven directed by the Ray Sisters, starring in the lead role of Sage in the film.\n\nIn March 2021, Martin played Julie in a reading workshop of the play Smoke by Kim Davies, at the Arcola Theatre in London.[12] The play is a modern adaptation of Miss Julie exploring sexual consent at a BDSM party in New York. Martin starred in the 1950s drama short Tap Twice.[14][15]\n\nIn January 2022, it was announced that Martin will star in the UK premiere of the play Never Not Once at the Park Theatre running through February and March 2022, in a cast including Flora Montgomery and Amanda Bright.[16] The play is written by Carey Crim and directed by Katharine Farmer. Martin plays Eleanor, who is described as \"bright, funny and completely happy apart from one small thing: she wants to know who her father is\".[17] The play is a \"searing new drama about the families we choose and the secrets that can pull them apart\" and was the winner of the Jane Chambers Award for Feminist Writing and Eugene O'Neil Award in America.[18]\n\nNever Not Once received positive 4 and 5 star reviews from critics including The Guardian, WhatsOnStage, The Upcoming, and London Theatre. The Guardian called the play \"Gut-wrenching, weighty and forceful - a visceral interrogation of the lasting effects and consequences of rape\".[19] The Upcoming said \"This is a play for our time, the topics it discusses resonate in every corner of society\".[20] Critics praised Martin's \"superbly acted\" performance.[21] Everything Theatre called Martin \"spine-tingling and uncomfortably brilliant\"[22] and The Arts Desk praised a \"pitch-perfect Meaghan Martin\".[23] London Theatre wrote \"Eleanor is very believably acted by Meaghan Martin with a terrific sense of energy and disbelief at the havoc she has unleashed by her quest for the truth\".[21] WhatsOnStage described Eleanor as \"imbued with irresistible warmth and energy by Meaghan Martin\".[24]\n\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Martin would star in the upcoming British rom-com feature film Ten Dates, alongside a cast including Rosie Day, Rhiannon Clements and Sagar Radia.[25] Filming began in April 2022. The film is due for release in February 2023.\n\nMartin starred as Julie in the London première of the play Smoke by Kim Davies at the Southwark Playhouse in February 2023.[26] The production was produced by Katy Galloway Productions and featured Martin's real-life partner Oli Higginson in the opposite role of John.[27] Smoke is a modern adaption of August Strindberg's Miss Julie set at a BDSM party in New York City, and was co-directed by Polina Kalinina and Júlia Levai.[28] The play is described as a \"piercingly witty and sometimes painful exploration of gender, sexuality and desire\".[29]\n\nSmoke opened at Southwark Playhouse on February 1, 2023, to very positive 4 and 5 star reviews from London critics including 5 stars from The Arts Desk and Theatre News, and 4 stars from WhatsOnStage, Theatre Weekly, London Theatre Reviews, and Everything Theatre.[30] In particular, Martin's performance was highly praised with WhatsOnStage writing \"Higginson and Martin are delivering two of the most exciting performances on any current London stage\".[31] WhatsOnStage goes on to say \"what makes Smoke rise from thought-provoking shocker to unmissable event, is the quality of the acting. Meaghan Martin and Oli Higginson are astonishing. Tender, brutal and utterly convincing, the measured sensuality of their movements contrasting intriguingly with line deliveries so naturalistic they sound like improvisation, this stunning pair mine Davies's text for all its dark humour and ambiguity.\"[31] The Arts Desk 5 star review from critic Gary Naylor praised Davies' \"dazzling Strindberg update\" as a \"complicated, clever and challenging play unafraid to treat its audience as grown-ups and all the more rewarding for that.\"[32] Naylor writes that \"the co-directors, Polina Kalinina and Júlia Levai are extremely adept at constructing this delicious set up and get super performances from their leads\", before concluding that \"Meaghan Martin, perfectly captures the coquettish bravado of Julie, that curdles into confusion, fear, and a cruetly both inflicted and endured.\"[32]\n\nAs of its release on April 30 2023, Meaghan Martin can be seen starring in feature film Journey alongside Rafael Cebrian, Arcelia Ramirez and Gustavo Sanchez Parra.[33] Journey is a drama feature written and directed by Christopher Rodriguez and explores poignant themes of family, love, legacy, and immigration - shot on location on the border between the US and Mexico.[34]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin recorded two songs in Camp Rock, \"Too Cool\" and \"2 Stars\".

The song debuted at number fifty-two on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart, becoming her first and only chart single. It has since peaked at number thirty-seven.\n\nMartin also recorded a version of the Olivia Newton-John song \"Magic\" for the Wizards of Waverly Place soundtrack.
