        "text": "Campers will put on an entire short musical in just two weeks. Camp days will include staging, choreography, music, lunch time (Star campers will bring lunch from home), snack, and loads of fun. Camp tuition includes costume pieces (campers will need to provide some costume items such as shoes and base costume items under their clothes), hours of instruction, snack, and a camp t-shirt. Come spend your summer dancing and singing with friends at The Actors Conservatory Theatre!\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\n\nDisney's Camp Rock The Musical, a combination of The Disney Channel's Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (starring teen idols Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers), is a classic story of rivalry and power. The story opens with Mitchie and her friends arriving at Camp Rock, ready to spend another summer jamming out and having the time of their lives. But the new, flashy Camp Star across the lake now threatens Camp Rock's very existence. To keep the doors open, Mitchie steps up, rallies her fellow Camp Rockers, and gets them into top shape for the ultimate showdown!\n\nBook by Faye Greenberg and Robert L. Freedman.
