        "text": "The list of young actors with North Texas ties associated with Disney Channel programming starts with Selena Gomez of Grand Prairie.\n\nBut Gomez is just one of several actors and entertainers with Texas ties who have gone on to significant roles on Disney television or film productions.\n\nGomez had a recurring role in Hannah Montana as Miley Cyrus’ frenemy and musical rival Mikayla Skeech. Gomez has made her mark as a singer, selling hundreds of millions of singles worldwide, and amassing billions of global streams of her music.\n\nIn an Apple TV+ documentary last November, Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me, Gomez opened up about major moments in her life, including a kidney transplant to treat lupus, her bipolar diagnosis and the cancellation of one of her tours because of mental health issues.\n\nGrapevine-reared Demi Lovato earned roles in several Disney Channel productions, including Princess Protection Program, alongside Gomez. Lovato also faced personal setbacks. A 2018 drug overdose resulted in her having three strokes and a heart attack, leaving her with physical limitations that still affect her, the Associated Press reported.\n\nArlington-born Hayley Orrantia, who had a 10-year run on ABC’s The Goldbergs, also has a deep Disney background. In 2009, she recorded vocals on Disney’s Tinker Bell and The Lost Treasure soundtrack. A year later, she sang background vocals for Lovato on Disney’s Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam soundtrack. She also sang background vocals for Cyrus on the Hannah Montana Forever soundtrack.\n\nCody Linley, who was reared in Lewisville, played Cyrus’ boyfriend for four seasons on Hannah Montana. He was Julianne Hough’s partner on the seventh season of ABC’s Dancing With the Stars and appeared in Syfy’s Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens in 2016.\n\nGomez, Lovato, Orrantia, Linley and several more Texas natives were all products of Cathryn Sullivan’s Acting for Film program in Lewisville.\n\nOn its Wiki fandom page, Disney lists scores of Texas-born actors, actresses and crew, ranging from Amy Acker to Renée Zellweger.\n\nGarland-born Mitchel Musso, who was recently arrested by Rockwall police, also had a role in Hannah Montana, playing Oliver Oken, one of Hannah’s best friends.\n\nRelated:‘Hannah Montana’ actor arrested, accused of public intoxication, petty theft, records show\n\nMusso also had multiple outstanding warrants related to traffic violations in Rockwall, police said. Musso is accused of public intoxication, theft and other charges. In 2011, Musso was arrested for a DUI in Los Angeles, according to E! News.\n\n“In becoming an adult, I have learned first-hand that stepping up and taking responsibility is the best way to move forward,” he said in a statement after his 2011 arrest."
