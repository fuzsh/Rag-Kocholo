        "text": "Demi Lovato is one busy lady!\n\nDuring a recent visit to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which airs on Wednesday, the \"Confident\" singer stopped by to talk about her new film, Smurfs: The Lost Village, and her big plans for Camp Rock 3.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Demi Lovato Talks New Soulful Music, Past Career Struggles: I Felt Like 'I Wasn't Going to Work Again'\n\n\"We want to come out with an R-rated Camp Rock 3,\" she reveals. \"All of our fans have grown up. So, anyone that watched Camp Rock is now older and can appreciate it.\"\n\n\"So, you'll be cursing in this?\" DeGeneres asks, to which Lovato responds, \"I think so.\"\n\n\"Is that something you enjoy doing?\" DeGeneres presses on.\n\n\"It's something I do everyday, all day,\" Lovato confesses, adding, \"I am terrible at not cursing.\"\n\nDeGeneres then challenges her to play an R-rated version of the game \"5 Second Rule,\" during which each person has five seconds to give three answers to a question and then hit a red buzzer to stop the time.\n\nThe 24-year old singer was so nervous that she had a hard time figuring out the rules of the game and she couldn't even think of a bad word to say!\n\nWatch how it all went down in the clip below.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Demi Lovato Opens Up About Her Sobriety: I Know 'My Life Depends On It'\n\nOn a more serious note, Lovato also took a moment to reflect on being five years sober.\n\n\"It means so much to me, because I feel like the day that I got sober is the day I started living,\" Lovato explains. \"I've decided to be open about my story and share everything that I've been through because it helps others. I've had several people come up to me and say, 'Hey, my dad got sober because you did' or 'I got sober because you did.' It's just so meaningful and impactful to me that I wouldn't change it for the world.\"\n\n\"You share so much about your journey and I think that is so important,\" DeGeneres adds. \"A lot of people try to hide things that we consider embarrassing but they are not embarrassing, they are things that we should all talk about.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Lovato responds. \"When you create stigma around certain topics you have to break that stigma by raising awareness, talking about it, creating a conversation and that's what I try to do.\"\n\nFor more on Lovato, watch the video below.\n\nRelated Articles:"
