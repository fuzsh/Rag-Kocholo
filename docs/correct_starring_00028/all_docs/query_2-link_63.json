        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nBorn August 20th, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Demi Lovato made her television debut on \"Barney and Friends\" alongside future star and close friend Selena Gomez. Lovato's big break arrived in 2008 when she starred in Disney's \"Camp Rock,\" and \"Sonny with a Chance.\" She started singing and releasing music at the same time, quickly finding chart success. While touring with The Jonas Brothers and appearing on more TV shows and movies, Lovato also had some personal struggles, which she eventually overcame through professional help. In 2012, she became a judge on \"The X Factor.\" In this http://www.WatchMojo.com video, we take a look at the musical origins of Demi Lovato.\n\nThis former Disney star has the X factor. Welcome to WatchMojo.com and today we're taking a look at the musical origins of Demi Lovato.\n\nTV Debut\n\nDemetria Devonne Lovato was born August 20th, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Growing up in a musical home, she began playing piano at seven and made her first television appearance as Angela on the children's show, “Barney & Friends.”\n\nBig Break\n\nFollowing several television show appearances, Lovato had her big break in 2007 when she landed the leads in two Disney productions. The television movie “Camp Rock” catapulted Lovato to stardom and increased her popularity among teens in 2008. The following year, “Sonny with a Chance” was an instant hit with kids, though Lovato only stayed with the television series for two seasons.\n\nMusical Debut\n\nWhile her acting skills were turning her into a household name, it was her singing that really resonated with fans. During this period, Lovato launched her singing career by contributing several songs to the Disney Channel show “As the Bell Rings” in 2007. The year after, she signed with Hollywood Records and recorded several songs for the “Camp Rock” soundtrack. The top three album included the Joe Jonas-assisted \"This Is Me,\" which reached the Billboard Hot 100’s top ten.\n\nTouring\n\nIn anticipation of her solo debut, Lovato then embarked on the \"Demi Live! Warm Up Tour\" and opened for the Jonas Brothers on their Burnin' Up Tour. Her first album, Don't Forget, dropped in 2008. The pop rock effort sold almost 90 thousand copies in its first week and reached the second position of the Billboard 200.\n\nSophomore Effort\n\nThe next year, Here We Go Again, premiered at number one on the Billboard 200. On this disc, she changed musical direction by leaning towards a more pop style. The album’s title cut became her first top twenty solo single. 2009 also saw Lovato share the screen with her good friend Selena Gomez in the highly watched Disney TV movie, “Princess Protection Program.”\n\nMore Music and TV\n\n2010 was a busy year for the actress and singer. By returning to the role of Mitchie Torres in “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” she found success once more as the Disney Channel Original Movie became one of cable television’s most watched programs that year. Her contributions to the film’s soundtrack also helped it reach the Billboard 200 chart’s top three.\n\nBranching Out on TV\n\nThat same year, Lovato appeared on the “Sonny with a Chance” soundtrack and received praise for her portrayal of a young girl with schizophrenia on the medical drama “Grey's Anatomy.”\n\nThird Album\n\n2011 saw the release of Lovato's third album, Unbroken. While working with a host of songwriters and producers, including Timbaland, Lovato aimed for a more R&B style with great success. The record reached the Billboard 200’s top five and spawned two singles: the popular radio track, “Give Your Heart a Break,” which also sold over a million digital downloads, and the top 10 tune, “Skyscraper.”\n\nPersonal Troubles\n\nDespite all her success and quick rise to fame, Lovato’s life hasn’t always been easy. As a victim of bullying when she was a child, she started cutting herself and developed an eating disorder. She was eventually home-schooled and earned her diploma in 2009. Her personal struggles resurfaced in 2010, which forced Lovato to enter rehab for physical and emotional issues for a brief period.\n\n“The X Factor”\n\nFortunately, Lovato pulled through. She has even publicly spoken of her troubles in the hopes of helping others facing similar situations. And in 2012, she returned to the small screen to enjoy renewed success as a judge for the reality television show, “The X Factor.”\n\nCarrying On\n\nLike everyone else, Demi Lovato isn’t perfect. But it’s her imperfections that make her such a good role model. With the right amount of determination and support, the young star has shown that anyone can overcome their obstacles and find success and happiness once more."
