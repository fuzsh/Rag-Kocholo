She got fugly.\n\nshe has a pointy chin\n\nwell it's an old pic of her that i used (as you can tell), but yeah, i guess. she's only 14 though... she still has time to mature.\n\nbtw i just realized she looks strangely like alexa vega in the pic i posted... hmm.\n\nYeah, I just watched Camp Rock and I was feeling bad because she's so not pretty, even though I don't like Demo Potato, (hence the potato) she's still got that cute teenage girl thing, I just don't see this girl having that.\n\ni wish my last name was stoner\n\ni know rite\n\nI was gonna say 'amazing last name.'\n\nShe did that \"Mike's Super Short Show\" on Disney right?\n\nmmhmm! she also used to dance in missy elliot videos as well.\n\nOMFG that was the most obnoxious bit ever. I feel as though I've seen it maybe three or less times, but as soon as I read what you wrote it came flooding back. She did my head in.\n\nI just remember it because they played one episode for so long that I couldn't stand it anymore. I think it was for The Shaggy Dog or some movie. It was so annoying.\n\n(no subject) - caseyyybreannn Expand\n\nand now you know...cause it's Mike's Super Short Show!\n\n...I'm in my 20's but I was actually disappointed when they got rid of that and replaced it with some other kids\n\n(no subject) - williammiller Expand\n\n(no subject) - venus_boy_love Expand\n\nlol that was cool\n\nA. B. Quintanilla III was Selena's brother.\n\nlol sorry just noticed that in the beginning.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI was thinking the same god damned thing!\n\nHigh schoolers aren't very smart anyways, so it's easy. :P\n\nShe probably had a tutor or did independent study. I did independent study and graduated at 15.\n\nI wish I had done that. My high school was such a joke, and thank god I graduated before the MCAS were required to graduate. And my high school is one of the \"prestigious\" ones in Boston(or at least it is supposed to be).\n\nThe Panabaker sisters [Kay and Danielle] graduated from UCLA with honors by the time they were 17/18.\n\ni wouldn't mind seeing more alyson stoner on ONTD tbh. that is, if we got to pick and choose which tween/disney ppl there would be posts on, i'd pick her\n\nheh. i think she's awesome.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nOMG I remember when one girl commits suicide... it's so sad...\n\nWait, did one of her friends really get molested, because I only remember the one friend faking that she was molested by their teacher.\n\nikr? They were better than any high school angst TV show at the time.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - damntrippy Expand\n\nman i love YA fiction and ive never heard of these.\n\nis it just referred to it as the alice series?\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - tomxginny Expand\n\n(no subject) - shanniesaysyo Expand\n\ni'm reading the new one right now! i've read them since the sixth grade :]\n\nWow, those books seem like the shit...\n\nI'm totally going to read them.\n\ni'm almost 24 and i've been reading these books since i was in the 4th grade :)\n\ni HATE this girl. seriously, irrationally hate her.\n\nthat's funny, where'd you see it? i just saw JoeTi (you know him, right?) and he'd been working at Soundview handing out the Wall-E promo watches. he thought it was really great and then started comparing it to Charlie Chaplin films... but that's JoeTi.\n\nof course i know JoeTi! haha. i saw it at roosevelt raceway, 11 pm showing :) i guess i can understand where he's coming from 'cause there's not much dialogue b/w the robots themselves... yeah, that's the only reason i can come up with.\n\nand i had no idea they made promo watches! that's kinda cool actually.\n\nyeah...she's unfortunate looking.\n\nwork it out, bb\n\ni'll always think of her as being the little girl in the missy videos\n\nwow, what a throwback (although the song's probably not that old haha) just haven't heard that song in a while!\n\nEvery time I hear that song I think of Dr. Drew trying to sing the chorus on Loveline way back in the day. It was so funny.\n\nshes so little!\n\ni honestly hated her...but shes not so terrible.\n\nI was wondering if that was her. I'm not familiar with these Disney Channel things she's doing now (or whatever - skimmed)\n\nOh man, I miss when Missy was good.\n\nI teach every Friday with my friend. It's a 16/17-year-old dance class. It's just a great social night.\n\nI'd be really embarrassed/feel pretty shitty if I were 17 and being taught by a 14-year-old.\n\nAw you beat me to it, haha.\n\nHaha comment twins. And IKE!\n\n(no subject) - moondream Expand\n\nomg omg, my sister and i got those glasses for them!!!\n\nlol As long as said 14 year old is not Indio Downey, I tend to agree\n\n(no subject) - skellington_27 Expand\n\nMe too. I would feel seriously, seriously pathetic.\n\nLmao ikr? It's like wow, I'm a failure..\n\nIf I were 16 or 17 I would feel weird taking lessons from a 14 y/o.\n\nwait. she graduated high school? unless she has school 24/7 how is that possible?\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nTrue that. I'm hoping my daughter can test out at 14 or 15. Wish I had.\n\nhomeschool.\n\nshe could have tested out. I technically graduated high school at 16."
