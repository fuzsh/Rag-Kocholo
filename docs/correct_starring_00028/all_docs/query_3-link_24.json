        "text": "Disney Channel has provided breakthroughs for some of today’s biggest pop stars, growing from announcing themselves as, “Hi, I’m [insert name] and you’re watching Disney Channel!” to winning Grammys and embarking on sold-out tours.\n\nFormer Mickey Mouse Club members Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake grew up to become the faces of teen pop at the turn of the millennium. The following generation of Disney Channel stars, including Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez grew up in a golden era of the network, complete with drama, lots of music and TV shows. Lovato once even called the group “Disney High.”\n\n“We called it ‘Disney High’ because when there’s only a select few of you that can relate to one another, you start dating each other, you become friends with one another, you fall out with one another and then you break up with one another,” they said on a segment of the In Bed with Nick and Megan podcast. “It’s just confusing and dramatic, and that’s ‘Disney High’ for you.”\n\nThe latest batch of Disney stars have taken their careers into their own hands, releasing the types of music that feels most authentic to them, without succumbing to the pressure of being a “role model.” Olivia Rodrigo, Zendaya, Bella Thorne, Sabrina Carpenter and Sofia Carson are just some of the few who have become popular in the late 2010’s.\n\nWe’ve compiled a roundup of musicians who got their star on Disney Channel. See them in our gallery here."
