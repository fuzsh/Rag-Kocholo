        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe (2020)\n\nLowest Rated: 7% Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005)\n\nBirthday: Aug 11, 1993\n\nBirthplace: Toledo, Ohio, USA\n\nFans of Alyson Stoner who know her as Max on the tween-centric TV show \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" probably don't remember when she made her first big splash, as the adorable, munchkin-like b-girl with the surprisingly authentic breakdance moves in the music videos of Missy Elliott and Eminem. Stoner studied jazz and tap dancing in her hometown of Toledo, Ohio before moving to Los Angeles to learn hip-hop dance from renowned choreographers Wade Robson and Fatima Robinson. She gained special attention for her dance work in Elliott's videos for \"Work It\" and \"Gossip Folks,\" and appeared with Elliott in a number of live performances, including the \"2003 American Music Awards.\" She was one of the family of 12 siblings in the remake of \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" and its sequel. A frequent contributor to the Disney Channel, Stoner has starred in Mike's \"Super Short Show\" and \"Camp Rock,\" and provided voices for \"Lilo and Stitch: The Series\" and \"Phineas and Ferb\" in addition to her work on \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\" Although busy with her film and television work, Stoner still finds time to dance. She released her own musical-fitness dance video, \"The Alyson Stoner Project,\" in 2009.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n50% Camp Rock\n\n47% Step Up 3\n\n42% Step Up: All In\n\n24% Cheaper by the Dozen\n\n21% Step Up\n\n7% Cheaper by the Dozen 2\n\nPhotos\n\nAlyson Stoner at arrivals for STRANGER THINGS 3 Season Premiere on NETFLIX, Santa Monica High School - Barnum Hall, Santa Monica, CA June 28, 2019.
