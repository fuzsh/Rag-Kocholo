        "text": "Photo gallery: The Disney Channel’s “Camp Rock” in Ontario\n\nONTARIO – Gardiner W. Spring Auditorium attracted a piece of the national spotlight Friday as the Disney Channel filmed a performance there of “Camp Rock, the Musical.”\n\nAs the first-ever pilot stage production of the musical wraps up this weekend, production crew members from “Disney 365,” a television segment that airs between shows on the Disney Channel, were filming the Ontario version.\n\nThe crew arrived on the Chaffey Campus on Friday afternoon to record shots of the campus as well as rehearsals. They also recorded that evening’s performance.\n\n“At first, I was super nervous, but when I got here I was like ‘Oh my gosh.’ I’m glad everyone gets to experience this,” said Leanna Arredondo, who plays the lead role of Mitchie Torres. Actress Demi Lovato plays Torres in the movie.\n\nThe musical is a hybrid of the first “Camp Rock” movie and the second movie, “Camp Rock 2,” which will premiere on the Disney Channel in September.\n\nThe same musical is being put on at a handful of other locations throughout the United States, but Disney has requested permission to use Chaffey High’s stage version for promotion on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe musical has been showing at Gardiner W. Spring Auditorium for the past week and is being directed by Dave Masterson, who teaches at Chaffey High.\n\nLeanna said it took some time to adjust to the presence of the camera crew.\n\n“It’s really different than what we’re used to,” Leanna said. “I try not to pay attention (to the cameras).”\n\nDuring rehearsals, the cast had to do several takes of the song, “It’s On,” while the Disney crew filmed.\n\nAt one point, the cast was asked gather in a circle and shout, “Let’s get started!” as they stared into the camera.\n\nSegments filmed on Friday are expected to air on the Disney Channel in September.\n\nThe show runs about 80 minutes with an intermission.\n\n“Camp Rock, the Musical” will play tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Monday at 7 p.m.\n\nChaffey High is at 1245 N. Euclid Ave.\n\nliset.marquez@inlandnewspapers.com\n\n909-483-8556"
