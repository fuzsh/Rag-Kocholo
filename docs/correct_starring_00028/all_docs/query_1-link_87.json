So apologies for the chaotic, unorganised mess this post will probably be.*\n\nSynopsis\n\nAt a music camp for gifted teens, a popular teen idol overhears a girl singing and sets out to find who the talented voice belongs to. What he doesn’t know is that the girl is actually a camp kitchen worker with a fear of being heard.\n\nCast\n\nDemi Lovato…Mitchie Torres\n\nJoe Jonas…Shane Gray\n\nMeaghan Martin…Tess\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera…Connie Torres\n\nAlyson Stoner…Caitlyn Geller\n\nJulie Brown…Dee La Duke\n\nDaniel Fathers…Brown Cesario\n\nAnna Maria Perez de Tagle…Ella\n\nJasmine Richards…Peggy\n\nJordan Francis…Barron\n\nRoshon Fegan…Sander\n\nKevin Jonas…Jason\n\nNick Jonas…Nate\n\nBest character\n\nI was going to choose the random guy who does a backflip off a bus when Mitchie first arrives at Camp Rock, but that’s way too obscure. So instead I’m choosing Jason, played by Kevin Jonas. Purely because he has the funniest lines and also I feel bad that Kevin always plays the dumb one. Why is this? Does someone at Disney hate him?\n\nFavourite scenes/musical moments\n\n*I do not own the rights to any videos in this post, no copyright infringement was intended. All rights go to the production studio*\n\nThe opening scene is so iconic, you really can’t beat a classic DCOM opening. The part where Mitchie takes off the sunglasses to reveal smaller ones is just too good. Also, Demi Lovato is such an incredible singer.\n\nMitchie throwing flour on her face is so weird and I’ve only just realised. As a kid I thought “Yeah, that’s a great way of hiding who you are” but now it’s just strange.\n\nThis dance sequence will never not make me cry with laughter. Who the hell choreographed this film? I’m sorry, but it’s so bad. All I put in my notes for this was “Whoever let Joe Jonas dance to hip hop should be fired”\n\nHere it is, everyone’s favourite moment in this film. It makes me laugh every single time. They really did Alyson Stoner dirty in this film, her character is so weird.\n\nIf Joe Jonas serenaded me I would have literally died. He was my ultimate crush when I was younger. Looking back now, the aggressively straightened hair is a red flag.\n\nI couldn’t review this film without talking about This Is Me. The chokehold this song had on me as a child was ridiculous. I’ll never get over Shane being surprised the girl is Mitchie because apparently he’s never heard her sing despite them performing a duet section in the final song. Did they not rehearse the number? Or is Shane so self absorbed that he doesn’t notice anyone else in the room? I’m guessing the second one as it has some intense synchronised choreography.\n\nBest quotes and one liners\n\nSHANE: [on the phone with Nate and Jason] Come on, guys. I learned my lesson! I showered in cold water! I looked at a tree! It’s been three hours. I need hair product.\n\nBROWN: I hate when I have to be uncool.\n\nSHANE: That’s the song!\n\nNATE: So that must be the girl.\n\nJASON: Ya think?\n\nSHANE: I don’t want to waste my summer at some camp! I’m Shane Gray for crying out loud!\n\nNATE: Hey, man, we used to love this place. Three years ago, we were campers.\n\nJASON: Yeah, man, this is where Connect 3… connected!\n\nNATE: [shakes his head] And you get to see our Uncle Brown.\n\nSHANE: [scoffs] Not a selling point.\n\nNATE: Look, man, right now, you’re the bad boy of the press, and the label has a problem with that, which means, we have a problem with that.\n\nJASON: Actually, I don’t really have a problem with that. [Nate glares at him] We have a problem with that!\n\nNATE: This camp thing is supposed to fix it, it’s great PR. So do your time, enjoy the fresh air…[sniffs in] … get a tan…\n\nJASON: Oh, and can you make me a birdhouse or something?\n\nSHANE: [scoffs at Jason] One word. Payback!\n\nJASON: That’s two words!\n\nCAITLYN: Her mom is a great person. What’s your mom like?\n\nBARRON: Uhh, she’s like a mom.\n\nNATE: [answering his phone on speaker] Hello?\n\nJASON: Hey, buddy! How’s my birdhouse coming?\n\nNATE: Jason!\n\nJASON: Sorry! It’s not my fault you didn’t ask him to make you anything.\n\nNATE: I didn’t want anything.\n\nJASON: Well, I wanted a birdhouse! So what?\n\nNATE: And what do you need a birdhouse for?\n\nJASON: Because I wanted to see more birds about…\n\nSHANE: [interrupting Jason] Guys? Guys!\n\nNATE, JASON: [together] Sorry.\n\nBROWN: So, you coming up to the campfire?\n\nSHANE: Yeah, right!\n\nBROWN: All right. Well, you sit in here by yourself, superstar, because you’re right – way cooler.\n\nELLA: [holds up two nail polish] Guys, which colour?\n\nPEGGY: Ella, they’re exactly the same.\n\nELLA: So you see my dilemma!\n\nSHANE: So here’s some advice. It’s not all about your image. None of it means anything unless people see who you really are. And your music has to be who you really are. It’s gotta show how you feel, or it doesn’t mean anything.\n\nI don’t really comment on quotes anymore, but this one is surprisingly deep for a Disney Channel movie.\n\nFinal thoughts and fun facts\n\nHonestly, the songs are so good in this film. The actual film isn’t as good when you’re an adult, it doesn’t quite have the magic of High School Musical, but I do love it.\n\nI’m probably going to shock a lot of people when I say I prefer the second film. I think the songs are even better and I liked the competitive nature of it. I’ll definitely review it at some point!\n\n[Thanks to IMDB for the following facts]\n\nMitchie was banned from participating in The Final Jam because she was “banned from all camp activities until after the end of Final Jam.” However, she participates in the final number “We Rock!” It seems that she would have been replaced because it appears she doesn’t get to do anything, including rehearsals, until Final Jam was over. This number occurs after Final Jam, but it seems logical she would have been replaced, yet she just jumps up and performs like it was planned all along and she had never been banned from participating in activities. I have so many questions about this performance.\n\nTowards the end, when Peggy is performing, she is supposed to be playing the guitar but she is only strumming it, one of her hands, which is supposed to be changing the notes, is simply holding the guitar. I like to think this is because the film producers/director wouldn’t let her actually sing.\n\nWhen Mitchie sings “This is Me” and finishes the chorus, the camera shows Shane turning around and he says “That’s the song.” This implies he kept his back turned during her singing a verse and chorus of the song. Even though this is an unexpected performance and he likely would have turned around at the start of hearing an unplanned and unannounced performance. This brings me back to my self absorbed comment from earlier.\n\nMeaghan Martin actually dislocated her shoulder while filming the song played at the campfire jam ‘Too Cool for You’. The iconic shoulder shimmy dance move literally injured here. I love her dedication though.\n\nJason and Nate did not exist in the original script of the movie. They were added in after Joe Jonas was cast as Shane, as Disney wanted to turn the film into a vehicle for the Jonas Brothers but no roles existed for Kevin or Nick.\n\nThe term “jam [session]” is used inaccurately at Camp Rock. A “jam session” is meant to be a musical act that is played without extensive preparation or arrangements. In the “jam” sessions featured at Camp Rock, all music and dancing appears well-rehearsed, defeating the true sense of a “jam session”.\n\nCheck out Young Creative Press on all socials\n\nYou can also check out my StoryGraph here"
