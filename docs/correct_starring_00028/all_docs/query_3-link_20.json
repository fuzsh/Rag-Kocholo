        "text": "Every Disney Channel stan of past and present knows and understands the cultural impact of Camp Rock. The DCOM convinced us all that we *had* to attend summer music camp and boasted an all-star cast that included Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres and the Jonas Brothers as Shane, Nate, and Jason Gray. But apparently, the lead role almost went to Selena Gomez.\n\nPer E! News, David DeLuise, Selena’s TV dad on Wizards of Waverly Place, revealed in a 2020 interview with Wildchat Sports that she was originally offered the part of Mitchie.\n\n“I’ve never really said this story, but they offered Camp Rock to Selena,” he said. “And she knew that if she passed on it…Demi would get the part.”\n\n“So she passed on it, which was very nice of her to do,” he added. “And they were friends. They were on the show Barney together.”\n\nCamp Rock landed Demi their breakout role on the Disney Channel and eventually led to a sequel and their own series on the network, Sonny With a Chance. In 2009, Demi and Selena shared the screen once again in Princess Protection Program and collaborated on an iconic song together for the film, titled “One and the Same.”\n\nWhile Selena and Demi were once besties, they drifted apart over the years. In April 2020, Demi shared in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar that they are no longer close. “When you grow up with somebody, you’re always going to have love for them. But I’m not friends with her,” the “Cool for the Summer” artist shared. “I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best.”"
