        "text": "Fans are worried about Alyson Stoner today, as she revealed on Twitter that her experience filming Camp Rock wasn’t all rainbows and sunshine like we thought, and she’s kept it all secret this whole time. It’s also been ten years since the movie first premiered.\n\nIt all started when she took to Twitter to clarify a rumor that she was up for the role of Hannah Montana — which she wasn’t. However, she was in the running to have her very own show, a spin-off of That’s So Raven. It just never got picked up. Miley Cyrus‘ Hannah Montana went on to premiere in 2006, and two years later, Alyson starred alongside Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers in Camp Rock in 2008. Alyson re-appeared in the movie-musical sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, which came out in 2010. Alyson now says something went on during that period of time that affected her – and based on the way it sounds, it’s something traumatic enough to keep her from talking about it for a decade after the DCOM franchise began.\n\n(Credit: Twitter, @AlysonStoner)\n\n“I wasn’t up for HM. I had my own show, a spin off of Raven, that competed against HM during same pilot season. If you want real drama, ask what Disney did to me on Camp Rock that I’ve had to keep secret this whole time,” the star clarified on Twitter.\n\n(Photo credit: Getty)\n\nThe singer, actress, and dancer has spoken highly about the Camp Rock era of her life in the past, which makes her recent reveal even more shocking.\n\n“Working on Camp Rock with the Jonases and Demi [Lovato] is forever such a fun and exciting memory,” Alyson exclusively told J-14. “The international premieres, South American tour – it was a dream!”\n\n(Photo credit: Getty)\n\nBut it wasn’t all positive as we’re learning. Back in 2017 actually, she opened up that her time being a child star did, in fact, cause her trauma. She revealed this after a fan tweeted that she was under-appreciated in the Camp Rock films.\n\n(Credit: Twitter, @AlysonStoner)\n\n(Credit: Twitter, @AlysonStoner)\n\nShe then put out a YouTube video explaining that she can’t talk about the details of what happened to her.\n\nAlyson said in her video, “I was a pack mule growing up. Being in that little box, being a part of that machine – it take a huge toll on you. The competition, narcissism, perfectionism, pressure, schedule, the traumatizing experiences that we can never talk about because we’re either under contract or we’ll get shot or other things will happen to us if we open our mouths.”\n\nAlyson has yet to reveal details about what it was that exactly happened to her and she totally has a right to keep it to herself until she is comfortable sharing. We are wishing her nothing but positivity and hope to continue to see her shine."
