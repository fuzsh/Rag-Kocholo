        "text": "Presley Elizabeth Borsky is a brain in cut-off overalls and maroon tights who \"loves all things cute and cuddly, especially pug-related.\"\n\nShe has attracted at least one admirer for her \"perfect little shoe size, seven-and-a-half, narrow.\"\n\nKat Conner Sterling is not Presley Elizabeth Borsky, exactly. But those large horn-rim nerd-cool glasses you see Presley wearing? Those are Kat's.\n\nAnd, of course, when you see Presley spike a football, take a dodge ball in the face, eat a whipped-cream pie without the use of her hands, and deploy a strategic quote from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" you're seeing Kat do those things.\n\nKat Conner Sterling is one of the four lead actors in \"A Week Away,\" a Netflix teen summer camp musical that debuts worldwide Friday on the globe's most popular streaming service.\n\nShe won the role with an audition tape, but perhaps a higher power exerted its influence: After all, who better to play a kid named \"Presley\" than someone born and raised and living in Memphis?\n\n'Faith-based' musical\n\nShot pre-pandemic near Nashville, \"A Week Away\" is targeted at those kids-of-all-ages who love Disney's hit \"High School Musical\" and \"Camp Rock\" movies (as well as the less fresh-faced likes of \"Pitch Perfect\" and even \"Hamilton\"). The movie complements its youthful energy with a \"faith film\" agenda, but its Christian message — unlike the vocals of some of its teen heartthrobs — is pitched at a low key. As the camp director played by comic actor David Koechner advises the kids: \"Go out in the world, the great big awesome world, and make some magic.\"\n\n\"Movie musicals are very challenging, but I had the time of my life,\" said Sterling, 24, cocooned back home in Cordova with her parents, David and Charlotte Sterling, after the COVID-19 scare cut short her relocation to Los Angeles.\n\n\"The musical itself is a ton of work, but you've also got to work in the shots and the camera angles,\" she said. \"We had hours and hours of rehearsal and eight- and nine-hour dance days, but it's so much fun.\"\n\nOr, as the chorus of a song in her new movie puts it: \"This is the best thing ever!\"\n\nMEMPHIS ARTS: Ballet Memphis documentary debuts this week: Here's a closer look at 'A Ballet Season'\n\nThe plot\n\nThe feature film debut of director Roman White, known for his music videos with Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Carrie Underwood, \"A Week Away\" casts Disney Channel graduate Kevin Quinn as a \"broody and cool\" foster-home youth who avoids a stint in \"juvie\" by agreeing to spend time at Camp Aweegaway (slurringly pronounced \"A Week Away\"), where a spunky camper played by former child star Bailee Madison encourages his best behavior while not discouraging his romantic interest.\n\nSterling and her fellow feature-film newcomer, Jahbril Cook, are the film's co-stars and the leads' quirky comedic sidekicks, Presley and George. Together, the foursome participates in such camp hijinks as paintball \"war games\" while occasionally expressing their feelings in exuberant song and dance; some of the tunes are original (a soundtrack album is available on Capitol Records), while others are pulled from the hit \"Contemporary Christian\" catalogs of Amy Grant, Steven Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith.\n\nPresley and George are sweet but a little goofy (George has a Buggin' Out haircut and tucks his shirt into his shorts). But \"in the movie, that's not seen as a bad thing,\" Sterling said. \"They're seen as beautiful. It's not, 'We've got to change them because they're losers.' It's, 'They're great as they are.' I like that, and I hope the kids who watch it will like that, too.\"\n\nDream come true for Memphis actress\n\nAppearing in a movie musical was wish fulfillment on a grand scale for Sterling. \"I grew up obsessed with 'High School Musical' and 'Camp Rock,'\" she said. \"What's crazy is I'm fulfilling my dream by being in a high school musical.\"\n\nAlthough she has no \"entertainers\" in the family, Sterling describes herself as a lifelong natural ham. \"I've always been a little performer, ever since I could walk and talk,\" she said. \"I would write my own plays and make my friends perform in them, or my older cousins and sister (Kimberly Sterling, now a lawyer). It's something I guess I was born to be.\"\n\n\"From the very beginning, she's always acted this way,\" said proud dad David Sterling, 59, a supply-chain management consultant. \"She's been a self-starter. Even when she was little, she was doing research, and identifying a potential manager.\"\n\nON NETFLIX: Bingeing 'Buried by the Bernards': Highlights from the made-in-Memphis series\n\nTransferring her energy to the stage, Sterling appeared in what she calls \"a ton\" of Memphis theater productions. In 2014, her role as Little Red in Evangelical Christian School's production of \"Into the Woods\" earned her the Best Supporting Actress honor at the annual Orpheum High School Musical Theatre Awards, a ceremony that celebrates local talent.\n\nAt Samford University in Birmingham, Sterling majored in theater. She began booking parts — mostly filmed in nearby Georgia — on such series as the Fox network's \"9-1-1\" and Marvel's \"The Gifted,\" and acquired an agent (Barbara Garvey with East Coast Talent). She was on a graduation-gift cruise with her parents when she got the call that her audition tape had won her a lead role in \"A Week Away.\"\n\n\"I look and sound a lot younger than I am, so I always play all the teens,\" said Sterling, whose breathy, Kewpie dollish voice is key to her eccentric appeal.\n\nENTERTAINMENT NEWS: Memphis animated series 'The Mound' coming to Oprah Winfrey Network\n\nFilming location\n\nFilming on \"A Week Away\" took place in the fall and early winter of 2019 at Camp Widjiwagan at the Joe C. Davis YMCA Outdoor Center near Nashville. It originally was intended as a theatrical release, but after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down cinemas, the movie was purchased by Netflix to appear as one of the platform's \"Original\" movies — and its first \"faith-based\" musical.\n\nThe Netflix synopsis describes \"A Week Away\" as the story of \"a troubled teen\" who \"takes a leap of faith by attending summer camp,\" where he \"unexpectedly finds love, friends and a place to belong.\" Sterling took her own leap of faith after working on the film by moving to Los Angeles, to pursue her acting career; her return to Cordova, motivated by the entertainment-industry disruptions of the pandemic, is only temporary, she says.\n\nPandemic or no, in recent weeks Sterling has had her first taste of a certain level of stardom, as she and her co-stars participated in days of Netflix-organized Zoom press interviews with such magazines and television programs as People and Entertainment Tonight. She said she tries to promote her hometown as much as possible during such sessions.\n\n\"I'm so proud to be from Memphis,\" she said. \"I think it's so cool that a Memphis girl has gotten this opportunity.\"\n\nShe added: \"We have our fingers crossed for a sequel.\""
