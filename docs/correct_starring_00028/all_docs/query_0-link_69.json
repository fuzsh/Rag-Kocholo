        "text": "Alyson Stoner: The mask that I wore was someone who's allegedly a good role model. Yet behind the scenes is like, you know, obsessively counting every morsel of food I'm consuming. Like, yeah, these things didn't match. You know, I cared about this concept of integrity. I wanted to be someone who was the same person in public as they are in private. And it just felt like, you know, this is not okay.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Welcome to Imposters, the show where I talk to world-class execs, athletes, and entertainers about their personal challenges, and how overcoming those challenges has shaped their careers and lives for the better. I'm your host, Alex Lieberman, co-founder and executive chairman of Morning Brew.\n\nMy guest today is Alyson Stoner. Alyson is an actress, dancer, and entrepreneur who got her start in Hollywood at just seven years old. Alyson skyrocketed to fame after she starred in Missy Elliott's “Work It” video in 2002. And she subsequently landed roles in movies like Cheaper by the Dozen and Step Up, as well as Disney Channel’s The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Camp Rock. But the intensity of the entertainment world that Alyson was growing up in would soon take a toll. At 17, she finally admitted herself to rehab after suffering from an eating disorder, and since that time has been on a journey to heal herself from some of the psychological wounds that growing up in Hollywood has had on her. My full conversation with Alyson Stoner right after this quick break.\n\nSponsored content: Making sure we're consuming enough water can sometimes feel like a never-ending cycle, and sometimes it almost feels like a chore. But with Action ion-charged alkaline water, staying hydrated has never been easier. Action water goes through multiple stages of purification and filtration, so it's even more delicious. And with a 9.5 pH or higher at the time of bottling, plus added electrolytes for taste, you can enjoy tasty water anytime. As the official water of Spartan Races, Action water is what tough athletes are drinking when they need to bring their A game. Learn more at drinkaction.com. That's drinkaction.com.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Alyson Stoner, thank you so much for joining Imposters.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Thank you for having me.\n\nAlex Lieberman: We're gonna go way back to start. Tell me about the beginning of your career in entertainment. And I believe it was at six years old when you were introduced to the industry. What was the impetus for you getting involved so young?\n\nAlyson Stoner: You really are going all the way back to the beginning. So actually, three years prior, at three years old, is when I started performing. But this is actually a loaded question. I'm gonna give you two very different answers that were playing out simultaneously. It's just kind of a matter of vantage point. So track with me. So first I'm told that I was a young, precocious child who enjoyed dance class, and when an opportunity arose to attend a modeling school and then thereafter an acting convention, my mother and stepfather were supportive of, you know, seemingly burgeoning interests and skill sets. And then after positive outcomes of winning some of the competitions and receiving callbacks, we were strongly encouraged to meet and sign with agents in Hollywood in order to pursue the entertainment industry more formally. Now, having zero background in the industry, it was all new territory. And early on, I booked a few gigs which drove our family to the decision-making point sooner than later regarding, do we relocate our family? Am I switching now from public school to homeschool? You know, et cetera. So from that vantage point, it's a story of a young kid with creative and professional potential and the fortunate means to support this passion-turned-career.\n\nNow, story number two, which is a little thicker. I am three to six years old, performing and training, first recreationally and then competitively, as many funnels flow. Developmentally, my identity and my personality are largely subsumed into my caregivers. Meaning, I don't have an individual sense of self yet, right? And I'm making decisions based on what's modeled for me, yes, but also whatever decisions like, you know, following a teacher's rules, helped me remain worthy of love, attention and belonging. 'Cause that's my ticket for survival at four years old. Further, when asked if I want to keep performing, or you know, when applauded after a great show, I don't have the cognitive apparatus to understand the implications of turning this hobby into a career, right? Like, I can't fathom how it'll affect my attachment style to be uprooted from my hometown. I can't estimate the alienation, and safety precautions of being socialized as a famous commercial kid product with fans approaching me on the sidewalk, you know, versus just being a kid in your neighborhood or class.\n\nAlex Lieberman: You mean you weren't thinking about codependency as a four-year-old?\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yeah, right. And like, I don't know how this is affecting my nervous system or stunting my emotional and physical development to have an adult work schedule and to be in that pressurized performance-driven environment. So from this vantage point, to me, and you know, please weigh in on this, to me there's a glaring consideration of the parents’ role in making these decisions, even with the purest of intention. And then there's also some cultural considerations, like our enchantment with entertainment and success and notoriety, and how that creates room for an entire system of child laborers to exist in plain sight and be celebrated, while internally experiencing immense psychological, social, physical disruptions that often later lead to mental distress, addiction, abuse, and sometimes suicide. That is my entry point for this conversation.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Yeah, well, unfortunately, the entry point for this conversation sounds quite reminiscent of a conversation I had a few months ago on this very podcast with Josh Peck.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Oh, yeah.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Who has had a journey that unfortunately, to kind of the point you allude to, a lot of people who get into the industry very young have had to experience. I want to talk about this trend that you've written in op-ed around, even the other day I saw you had tweeted out about basically this journey that child actors and actresses make throughout their life, and the difficulty of it and how it hasn't been, you know, scientifically studied yet, but there's so much there if someone was to do the work…\n\nAlyson Stoner: One hundred percent.\n\nAlex Lieberman: …to see it. But tell me for a second, what was your parents' perspective around all this? Like when the decision was being made to ultimately give you a shot at fame and taking a personal passion and taking it professional, what was their viewpoint?\n\nAlyson Stoner: So from my understanding, because there's the story I inherited about my upbringing, and then there's the reflections that come 20 years later, I understood my mother to be fully supportive of whatever interests I had forming. My sisters were in sports; I happened to be in this acting school, and she said if I wanted to become a pilot, she would hope that she could support me in, you know, taking aviation lessons. So it wasn't viewed as a career. However, and this is what I notice happening day in and day out with families trying it in Hollywood, there is no preparation for the kind of processes you're about to go through. And it's a lot of chaotic last-minute sacrifices that's put stress on the family to decide which kid’s event they're going to attend tonight. And acting, singing, dancing, not just in local community theater, but once it's commercialized in an industry, you're now in like a corporate setting with expectations that are far beyond, you know, are you gonna do your competitive dance convention this weekend?\n\nSo I don't think my parents were prepared or aware of what was about to ensue. And I know that my mother did so many things to protect me in terms of like auditions, for example. She would, you know, say, “Hey, you're not going out for anything where you have to cuss. You're not doing things that are violent. You're not doing x, y, z. We've got some boundaries. We're a Midwest family; we got some morals, and you know, if you wanna quit, let's have a conversation. Like there's no pressure and certainly no expectations that you're gonna be famous.” So from that angle, it was like a pretty wholesome, you know, happy-go-lucky, exciting opportunity, but there's just way too much happening at the subconscious levels in all of us that I just, I gotta believe that there's probably something more, and it's not necessarily for me to air that out on a microphone, you know, but if my mother wanted to talk about it at some point I would be equally curious to hear what was going through her mind.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Outta curiosity, as we're about to kind of unfold your journey, have you had these conversations with your mom?\n\nAlyson Stoner: I have had a few. She has seen the challenges I've faced. Mind you, you know, Josh and many of my peers, they had experiences that included substances, that included addiction. Some have experienced abusive relationships and/or being an abuser, and my vices were much more socially acceptable, which allowed me to hide them in plain sight. I chose things like overachievement and things like “I just wanna be ultra healthy, so I'm gonna work out all the time and count every calorie,” right? Which eventually led to an eating disorder. But you couldn't really tell the impact it was having on me because I was still hitting my mark. So I think it's hard for my mom to understand sometimes, like, “You seem to be doing just fine,” when in reality, I know in my therapy sessions when I'm unable to access emotion, 'cause I've had walls built up from childhood to help protect from the amount of attention I was absorbing all the time from every direction. Like, yeah, Mom, like I hope one day you can understand this a little bit more fully. So yeah, I try, but she's on her own journey and process as well.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Alyson is careful not to place blame for her early childhood traumas on her parents or on anyone in particular. Rather, she's been very open about the fact that she sees her experience as being part of a larger systemic issue. Last year Alyson published an op-ed titled “The Toddler to Trainwreck Industrial Complex,” in which she talks about the impact that being a child entertainer has on short- and long-term development, brain chemistry, and nervous system regulation. She says that the high-pressured environments that surround child entertainers are a major part of this problem. And that the first step to alleviating some of these issues is to have trained mental health professionals on every single set. I think you've done an exceptional job painting a picture at kind of the macro level of what's happening in entertainment to children within entertainment. And also the feeling I get is, at least societally I speculate maybe one reason that there isn't the sense of urgency to change things is maybe this perception that actors and actresses are famous. They choose to be famous; they have all of the benefits of fame.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Right, right.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Is this really a big problem? And I think, to your point, there's a number of things to at least ask the question of there, which is, does everyone have this choice? Is everyone fully aware of the trade-offs? Just because people have certain benefits in an industry doesn't mean there aren't also great trade-offs and consequences of that. I would love to get a little bit more micro for a second, and understand, within your own experience, how did these early experiences impact you mentally, spiritually, your ability to regulate your emotions? And I believe in your op-ed, there was a story you told about an audition that involved a scene of assault and rape. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that experience had on you?\n\nAlyson Stoner: Sure. If you are lucky enough to get an agent, lucky enough to be submitted for roles out of a hundred thousand performers, lucky enough to get an audition out of the 10,000 submitted, lucky enough to have an acting coach help you prepare, enough flexibility in your school or job that you can call in last minute, still the audition process is a complex set of overlapping experiences. So, you know, I wanna give you a couple factors just to situate ourselves in the context of an audition. So one, you're entering a random room with a stranger, and you are creating a fantasy world on the spot. And that requires you to deeply manipulate your psychological and emotional state of being on cue. So there's that set of stuff.\n\nTwo, you're given scripts and roles with clear descriptions of a character's attributes. And based on what you're submitted for, you'll start to see patterns emerge in the way that your agents and the industry and the world perceives you. Perhaps you only ever go out for the funny sidekick or the beautiful vixen or the ugly relative. These archetypes and stereotypes inevitably shape your sense of artistry, your career path, and also your own self-concept. So there's that batch of things.\n\nNext, there's a stat that says it's approximately 200 times auditioning before you'll book a job. So just imagine the time, energy, money, emotional labor of putting yourself out there 200 times, getting 200 nos all across town. And if you haven't been released from your agent by then, getting one yes, that'll only pay a couple hundred bucks. It'll only last a couple days before you're unemployed again. Okay? So like this chaotic schedule and roller coaster of emotions, as well as this art of learning to people-please in auditions to win the job, the impact of constant rejection. All of that's happening around the clock. And yes, that took a toll on how I navigate social interactions and relationships. But for the mature and explicit scenes I had to portray, I do wanna double down that my mother did a great job at not agreeing to ever have me audition for something so awful.\n\nHowever, what happens, as is with most films, there's usually something in there that's an intense scene, whether the kid is supposed to be there or not. And it could be grief, it could be abuse, it could be violence, it could be illness. And so in the audition room, sometimes the casting people will want you to experiment and improvise. So now the parent doesn't even know that their kid is enacting certain emotional states or accessing these places psychologically, right? And reminding you, this kid cannot differentiate reality from fantasy, right? So this is in their body memory like it's a real event. So, you know, flash forward, how has this affected me in some specific ways? One thing is this parasocial relationship landscape that I navigate as my norm. There are millions of people who know a lot about me and who feel connected to me, but I've never met them. And it's a more of a one-sided relationship. That is something worth Googling because we all do it, whether it's a character in, you know, a film we love, or it's an actual celebrity or public figure.\n\nSecond is this mask, right? I've had a persona from childhood, and I have worn a mask and I've kept it on at all times. And this mask is both protective, it's a protective shield for me, as well as the persona that helps me continue to book jobs and build a career. And then, you know, there's concepts like career momentum and the pressure to stay relevant and what happens in puberty when you start getting roles that are sexualizing the character and blah, blah blah. But these are just some of the ways that it could affect young performers, and did affect me.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Another impact that the intensity of the entertainment business had on Alyson was a desire for control in her life. And as she alluded to earlier in the interview, this eventually manifested in the form of an eating disorder.\n\nAlyson Stoner: So around 13, I was noticing I had some eating disorder behaviors. My best guess is that, you know, it was a way to bring some routine to my life in the midst of the chaos. And at first, you know, I was just, I wanted to be selective about food, and dedicated to a workout. And then it took over my life. I tried getting help and recovering on my own, but it was really…it got way too big to face alone. And so after a while I had an audition for The Hunger Games. And typically, you know, by then I knew, don't put all of your eggs in one basket. Like, don't be obsessive, have a balanced approach, do your best and then let it go. But The Hunger Games, man, that was such a special project and I really wanted to do my best. Well, in training for it, even just the audition, I became really underweight, and it reached the point where all of the mechanisms I put in place to help me if things were starting to go too far just did not work. So I removed myself and said, I really need to get into treatment.\n\nAlex Lieberman: So you had this awareness, you had the awareness that you were not in a good place.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Oh, for sure, because I wanted to be. The mask that I wore was someone who's allegedly a good role model, yet behind the scenes is like, you know, obsessively counting every morsel of food I'm consuming. Like, yeah, these things didn't match. You know, I cared about this concept of integrity. I wanted to be someone who was the same person in public as they are in private. And it just felt like, you know, this is not okay. I mean, of course, and also the scale showed me, it's not okay. My, you know, heart rate was like the heart palpitations, the sallow skin, the hair loss, and everything that comes with it.\n\nAlex Lieberman: We're gonna take a quick break here, but when we come back, we'll get into how Alyson has learned to heal emotionally and trust others, and the new way in which she's approaching her career. Stay with us.\n\nSponsored content: On this show, I talk to people about overcoming the things that used to make them lose sleep. Anxiety, indecision, imposter syndrome, you name it.

That's athleticgreens.com/imposters.\n\nAlex Lieberman: And we're back. Before the break, Alyson described the grueling nature of the entertainment industry and the psychological impacts it had on her and her development. But after hitting the low point of putting herself into rehab, I was curious to know what the process of healing mentally and emotionally looked like for her. One thing that you've mentioned as a function of these masks, as a function of having fame early, is a fear of building authentic relationships.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yeah.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Because of this feeling that you have to maintain a certain image that became your identity.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yeah.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Tell me about how this fear shaped your behavior, and also the things that you did in your life to try to deconstruct and then reconstruct yourself so you could actually form authentic relationships.\n\nAlyson Stoner: This is such a tender and obviously intimate area to speak about. What I noticed growing up, even when I tried to start dating…something my peers and I speak about is that we don't have the chance to make a first impression. If someone's familiar with our work, they already have an idea in their mind of who we are. And so we can't really start from square one. Many of us, on purpose then, date people who are like a lot older, because they didn't see our work, or we date people who don't have a TV. I'm a big fan of going that route. And I think when it comes to authenticity, it's very difficult to build trust when the people around you are either on your payroll, or they're benefiting from your success and maybe even enabling some of the unhealthy behavior.\n\nAnd so I really struggled to ever be willing to rely on someone else to help me in my emotional needs and the deepest, most vulnerable spaces. To this day, you know, my partner is wonderful and patient and because of the container we've built together, I'm now finally learning to lean on my partner in moments and to let myself be held in moments, to not be hyper self-sufficient or to be quick to, you know, kind of have the martyr complex, where you abandon your own needs because someone else said they need something. And I never learned that having my own needs was okay. So it's taken, you know, a drastic toll. But each of us in our life paths have our first map of reality and then you have, you know, the option of whether or not to stick with that. If that's something that's working for you, then kudos. But for those of us who are like, something's not right, I need to go back, rewrite my perception of my past and also write a new future, 'cause I don't want next year to be what this year or the past was like, yeah, we gotta do some deconstruction.\n\nAnd for me it looks like a lot of therapy, a lot of books, a lot of moments alone. And learning how to listen to my mind and body, but also create distance from the story that's driving me every day, so I can start to play with new ideas and have the capacity to withstand the necessary discomfort of transformation.\n\nAlex Lieberman: As you reflect on your journey thus far, what do you think are the most important decisions you made or resources you consumed that had the biggest, let's call it, like, stepwise shifts in your ability to know who you truly are, your ability to have compassion and love for yourself, and also your ability to not have this martyr complex, where you can actually take care of yourself and not feel like you have to do things for others at the detriment of your own happiness and wellbeing.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Ooh. Yes. Some of these moments and decisions were, one, choosing rehab. That was more than just naming for the first time that my health and well-being are important. It was also recognizing that sometimes the people around me are not necessarily going to be in agreement with the decision that focuses on health, maybe loses career momentum. So that was a moment of reclaiming some power and agency over my own body and what happens mentally and physically and emotionally.\n\nAlex Lieberman: And just for the listener before we go to the next one, when was that specifically, just in your chronology?\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yep. I was about 17 years old.\n\nAlex Lieberman: And was that, and was that right after The Hunger Games auditions?\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yeah, it had to be soon after, yes, actually, because while I was in rehab—this shows you, this shows you where people's priorities are. I was on bedrest and my management still sent me an audition for another role in Hunger Games. They said, “Okay, so you didn't get this one, but do you wanna go out for this character?” I'm like, “I am hooked up to a machine right now.” And they said, “Yeah, but you'll be out by the time they're filming.” Y'all are missing the point here.\n\nSo that was a moment to be in a bit of a cocoon, which I hadn't had the chance to do. Some changes that happened in treatment…I had always longed for the bravery to leave entertainment and to venture out and see what existed beyond entertainment. But the fear of not having any other skill, and also the admiration of like, wait, you quote unquote “made it,” so why do you wanna leave it now? really, you know, kept me in my pattern. So coming outta treatment, I had a little bit more willingness to believe that there could be a second story for me.\n\nAnd ironically, even though I was nervous about going back to audition and getting back into things, the first audition I went on, I booked, and it was my first-ever series regular role on an ABC show with a star-studded cast. This is something I longed for for 20 years. And you know how I felt when I booked it? I had absolute dread, 'cause I was like, “I'm not ready to go from zero to 100 again. I don't know if I really want this.” So having that, thankfully the show didn't get picked up. Whew. Just like the 10 other shows that didn't get picked up.\n\nSo that was working on my psyche and my heart. The next moment was when social media era began and I realized, oh, I can actually create my own content and share things directly with an audience, so I'll have a little bit more control over my life and schedule maybe some alternative ways to have financial stability. So that was empowering. There came a time when I was juggling both. I had a music video that was releasing one day and then, you know, was making content to promote it.\n\nAnd a friend reached out and said, “There's this trip and it's with a bunch of entrepreneurs and social impact folks and I really think, you know, you might resonate with this.” That activated all the parts of me that were dormant but that were eager to surface. And so in the middle of my release, I did something I would never have done. I left and went on a trip and that trip changed my life, because it showed me there are people outside of entertainment doing cool things for a purpose. And I was like, “Wow, I feel awake. I feel like I can contribute, like, let me get more involved.”\n\nThereafter, you know, the next, or amidst that, one of the other milestones was coming to terms with my own sexuality, and that just invited a deconstruction of my family of origin, a deconstruction of faith, a deconstruction of all kinds of systems that were in place. And each of these things were liberating me more and more and more so that I could start to generate creative, you know, ideas for a different future.\n\nAlex Lieberman: And part of this different future was starting her company, Movement Genius, with her sister two years ago. And this, Alyson says, is what she feels is her life's work. And while Alyson's clarity of self seems so assured and put together, now she's quick to put down that myth. Alyson is open about the fact that she's still very much hard at work on herself and that it wasn't a simple path to get to where she is today.\n\nAlyson Stoner: I would like for all of you to know that I have had dishes in my sink for at least a week now. And I do wanna share a bit of, you know, the quote unquote “dark night of the soul.” And I've had several. And one of them, truly I felt so confused for a whole season, a whole chapter of life. I had, you know, fits in bed of just crying, and no idea where it was coming from. If it was something from the past coming up or if it was the pressures of today. Even the concept of transitioning from childhood to adulthood was like, basic adulting functions seemed like the hardest things in the world for me to do. To brush my teeth every single day? Like I could hardly keep anything in order. So, and I still every day, like I just yesterday had to lead a workshop and we’re offering tools to support people. Well, this morning, like I myself was like, wow, I really need to use some of those tools 'cause I'm struggling. So yes, there's clarity because this is a part of the job that I know best, is how to articulate this experience. But I am a full human with the full spectrum of it all, and I'm learning every single day. And I am also painfully normal in the challenges that I'm facing. Like brushing my teeth sometimes is much harder than doing this interview.\n\nAlex Lieberman: And doing your dishes as well.\n\nAlyson Stoner: And doing dishes. And just so you know, I have now worn this sweatshirt three days in a row.\n\nAlex Lieberman: That's what we call efficiency.\n\nAlyson Stoner: I love the reframe.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Exactly. First of all, thank you for sharing that. I want to talk about Movement Genius. Tell me the impetus for starting this company, and also tell me what it has been like becoming a founder. What are the things that have come naturally to you, and what are tools that you've had to add to the toolkit you didn't have before?\n\nAlyson Stoner: So given my own health journey and transformation many years ago, I started researching the fields of psychology, neurophysiology, et cetera. And the tools that had been most transformative for my nervous system as well as my mindset were tools that combined the mind and body simultaneously. So it was both a cognitive and somatic approach. Some folks have heard the term top down, which is when you use tools focused mostly on your thoughts to help your body feel better. And then there's also bottom up approaches, where you're helping your body and nervous system relax in order to improve your mental health.\n\nWell, I got a few certifications in this space and I started collaborating with therapists and experts to bring these tools to more people since they're often inaccessible, they're quite expensive. And still a lot of us separate mental health and physical health, and forget the importance of that mind/body connection for this deep transformation. So at the start of the pandemic, I led…you know, we were all inside. I led a 14-day series of live classes on Instagram using these tools and these concepts, and over 150,000 people showed up, and it showed me that we all badly needed support. And from there, Movement Genius was born.\n\nAlex Lieberman: I have one final question for you.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yes.\n\nAlex Lieberman: If you could wave a magic wand, would you change your childhood?\n\nAlyson Stoner: Ooh. Oh, man.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Because I don't believe in regret, necessarily, but I believe if you had something within your power, having a perspective on something is reasonable as well.\n\nAlyson Stoner: I appreciate that. And just so you know, after this conversation, one of these days, I'm gonna put you in the hot seat, and I will be asking you all of the questions of your experience as a founder and a human.\n\nAlex Lieberman: Happy to talk about all of It.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Yeah. And so to answer your final question for now, because I know that I wouldn't wish this life on any other young person, I have confidence saying I would wave a magic wand and change some of those experiences, mostly just to be more holistic so that my development didn't focus primarily on only one to two interests and skills, but I just felt a little more equipped to navigate the fullness of life. But now that we're here, we all have gaps in our development, losses, benefits, privileges, and it's, you know, now it's like, what do we do with these pieces? What puzzle do we want to make? And that's when I play a game called “keep, toss, and transform,” and I look at an aspect of my life or a belief or maybe even a material object in your house. And you say, is this contributing to a journey of wholeness? Is it contributing to well-being? Is it contributing to the way I wanna serve the world? If so, keep it. If not, and it's like completely irredeemable, get rid of it. If you need to, transform it and help it become more effective. So that's, you know, that's been my journey. Look at the pieces, see what you need to keep, toss, and transform, and keep going.\n\nAlex Lieberman: What a great tool to leave listeners with. Alyson Stoner, thank you so much for joining Imposters.\n\nAlyson Stoner: Thank you.\n\nAlex Lieberman: I'm impressed with Alyson's ability to look back on her time as a child actor with a thoughtful perspective rather than a bitter one. Here is someone who grew up in the weird and intense environment of the entertainment industry, and rather than letting it inform the way she leads her life, she has found her way to a more grounded, healthy mindset as well as career by following her instincts and paying attention to what actually helps her feel whole. So as we head into the new year, I think it's a perfect time to implement Alyson's keep, toss, and transform practice. What have you done this year that has contributed to your sense of well-being and what you want to be contributing to the world, and what have you been doing that does not push you towards where you want to be, that you want to get rid of?\n\nImposters is a production of Morning Brew.
