        "text": "Did somebody wish upon a star, because former Disney Channel actors Demi Lovato, Cole Sprouse, Matthew Scott Montgomery, Debby Ryan, and Alyson Stoner had an epic reunion on Wednesday night (April 4) for a very good reason: a party for another Disney Channel alum, Hayley Kiyoko, and the recent release of her debut album Expectations.\n\nDemi shared the photo to her Instagram story and titled it with \"Disney Channel Reunion!\" and Debby followed suit soon after. Matthew also posted the photo as a regular Instagram upload, captioning the photo with \"season finale of my life aka disney high reunion celebrating @hayleykiyoko @colesprouse @alysonstoner @ddlovato @debbyryan.\"\n\nFans will remember that Demi starred in the Disney Channel Original Movies Camp Rock and Sonny with a Chance before becoming the pop star she is today. Matthew appeared on Shake It Up and Jessie back in the day. Debby played the titular character on Jessie and can most recently be seen in the movie Every Day. And, of course, everyone remembers Cole from his time with twin brother Dylan Sprouse on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody before he was a Riverdale star. Alyson was also in the Camp Rock franchise, along with cohosting the beloved segment \"Mike's Super Short Show\" and lending her voice to Phineas and Ferb, and is now currently working on new music. Before Hayley was dropping albums, she was also in the DCOM Lemonade Mouth.\n\nFans on social media have since reacted to the post, tweeting, \"A DISNEY CHANNEL REUNION, MY HEART\" and \" I’m LIVING for this iconic Disney channel reunion!!\""
