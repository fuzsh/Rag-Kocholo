        "text": "Raven-Symoné has been a force in the entertainment industry since her breakthrough with That’s So Raven and The Cheetah Girls. Since then, she’s continued expanding her resume with credits such as Sister Act on Broadway and co-hosting The View on ABC.\n\nFans fell in love with Miley Cyrus when she originated the role of Hannah Montana on Disney Channel in 2006. Although hits such as “The Climb” and “He Could Be The One” were part of Miley’s claim to fame, she’s gone to great lengths to separate her current sound from what her fans knew her for. Bangerz, Miley’s fourth studio album, which featured more pop and R&B sounds, debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, selling 270,000 copies in its first week. Since then, Cyrus has released four additional studio albums. Her most recent, Endless Summer Vacation, spawned the No. 1 hit “Flowers,” debuted at No. 3 three on the Billboard 200 and is arguably one of Miley’s sharpest albums.\n\nAfter her time on Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place, Selena Gomez took her career in a different direction, ultimately starring in movies like Spring Breakers and Monte Carlo. As she continued growing as an actress, Gomez released three solo albums (Stars Dance, Revival, and Rare) from 2013-20. She brushed up her acting chops when she joined the cast of Only Murders in the Building in 2020. Apple TV+ released their documentary, Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me, two years later, documenting a six-year journey starting in 2015.\n\nEven though many fans remember Hilary Duff from her time as Lizzie McGuire from 2001-04, she starred in other movies like Cheaper by the Dozen and A Cinderella Story shortly after. In 2015, Duff originated the role of Kelsey Peters, a 26-year-old book editor in the TV series Younger. After the series ended, the actress scored a new gig in Hulu’s How I Met Your Father.\n\nAfter Shake It Up concluded in 2013, Zendaya shifted from Disney Channel sitcoms to big-screen features. She debuted in Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017 and starred alongside Zac Efron in The Greatest Showman the same year. However, Zendaya’s breakthrough would come in 2019 after starring as Rue Bennett in the American TV series, Euphoria. Critics have praised her performance, and she's even earned a Golden Globe and an Emmy.\n\nDemi Lovato’s Disney Channel dominance exploded after the success of Camp Rock. With a powerhouse voice and expansive range, Demi’s eight studio albums (and four top-10 hits) easily place her among some of the most successful Disney stars. Her latest album, Holy Fvck, debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200.\n\nKeke Palmer has starred in both iconic Disney Channel and Nickelodeon original programming. After leading roles in Jump In and True Jackson VP, Keke has continued taking on different roles in films like Alice, Lightyear, and Nope. Since late 2022, she's hosted her podcast, Baby, this is Keke Palmer, available to listen to on all streaming platforms.\n\nOver the last few years, Ariana Grande has quickly become a force in pop music. With No. 1 albums such as Yours Truly, My Everything, Sweetener, Thank U, Next, and Positions, it’s hard to believe she played the light and bubbly Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s Victorious.\n\nJennette McCurdy’s breakthrough happened after starring as Sam Puckett in the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly. Although she retired from acting in 2017, in 2022, she would remind her fans why they fell in love with her in the first place. Her memoir, I’m Glad My Mom Died, which readers described as “mordantly funny,” was released on August 9 and sold out within 24 hours. Later that month, it would become a No. 1 New York Times Best Seller — selling over 200,000 copies in its first week.\n\nAlthough Adrienne Bailon is most known for her time in the Disney Channel original movie, The Cheetah Girls, we can’t forget her time as Raven Baxter’s arch nemesis, Alana Rivera, in That’s So Raven. Although both were impressive performances, her credits don’t stop with just Disney. From 1999-2006, Adrienne was part of the R&B girl group 3LW. After deciding to take a break from singing, she dabbled in other projects like reality tv and co-hosting talk shows The Real and E! News.\n\nFrom starring roles in Camp Rock, Hannah Montana, and their show, Jonas, viewers fell in love with Kevin, Nick, and Joe Jonas on the Disney Channel. After a five-year hiatus, the band announced their comeback in February 2019 with the release of their No. 1 single, “Sucker.” Since then, the Jonas Brothers have embarked on their “Remember This Tour” and performed a 7-date residency show in Las Vegas in 2022. Their sixth studio album, The Album, will be released on May 5, 2023.\n\nDisney Channel’s Good Luck Charlie starred Bridgit Mendler as she and her siblings helped their parents raise their fourth (and newborn) child. After GLC and Lemonade Mouth, Bridgit released her debut album, Hello My Name Is…, in 2012 and her EP, Nemesis, in 2016. A few years later, she played the role of Emmy Quinn in Netflix’s Merry Happy Whatever.\n\nVannessa Hudgens originated the role of Gabriella Montez in Disney’s High School Musical. During her time with Disney, Hudgens released two studio albums, V and Identified. In 2015, she played the titular role in Gigi on Broadway. She returned to the TV screen from 2018-20, starring in the Netflix Christmas movie The Princess Switch and its sequels.\n\nWith Disney Channel credits like Phil of the Future and Cow Belles on their resumes, Aly and AJ started gaining traction with their third studio album, Insomniatic, and their charting hit, “Potential Breakup Song.” Their fifth album, With Love From, was released on March 15, 2023.\n\nFrom 2000-07, Christy Carlson Romano starred in a handful of Disney Channel original content. And despite her busy schedule with shows like Even Stevens and Kim Possible, she still found time to take on additional roles like Belle in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway."
