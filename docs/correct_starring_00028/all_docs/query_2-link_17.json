        "text": "It's hard to imagine anyone other than Demi Lovato playing Mitchie Torres on Camp Rock, but, as it turns out, the role almost went to Selena Gomez.\n\nAs noted by PopSugar, the tidbit was shared in a 2020 interview with David DeLuise, who played Selena's dad on Wizards of Waverly Place. Speaking to Wildchat Sports, David revealed Selena had been offered and turned down the lead role in Camp Rock to make sure Demi would land it.\n\n\"I've never really said this story, but they offered Camp Rock to Selena,\" David says in the interview after recounting an anecdote of how he met Demi. \"Selena knew that if she passed on it, Demi would get the part. So she passed on it, which was very nice of her to do.\"\n\nAs Disney Channel fans probably know already, Demi and Selena were BFFs at the time. The two met on the set of Barney & Friends when they were around ten and stayed close in the years after, though they've seeming fallen out of touch more recently.\n\nThey also started their Disney journey around the same time, with Sel landing Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007, after guest runs in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Hannah Montana. On the other hand, Demi landed As the Bell Rings in 2007, as well as Camp Rock and Sonny with a Chance later. The two even starred together in the fan-favorite DCOM Princess Protection Program in 2009."
