        "text": "Meeting the cast of Camp Rock\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nCamp Rock 2 was a Disney Channel Original Movie that was a sequel to Camp Rock. It premiered on the Disney Channel on September 3, 2010.\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) returns to Camp Rock with her mother Connie (Maria Canals-Barrera) for another year of summer camp. A rival camp called Camp Star was opened by a old friend of Camp Rack’s owner. Luke Williams (Matthew Finley , MDot) is the most talented performer of Camp Star. He is kind of the leader. He sings Fire at the bonfire when both camps come together. Many counselors and campers leave Camp Rock to go to Camp Star. The Jonas Brothers return as members of a band called Connect 3. When we first meet them, their tour bus has a flat tire and their bus driver Oliver (Big Rob) is trying to fix it. It rolls down a hill and the boys make it to the camp in a truck full of chickens. Chloe Bridges plays Dana the daughter of Camp Star’s owner. Nate (Nick Jonas) falls in love with her and sings Introducing Me to prove he really does love her and can share his thoughts with her! Roshon Fegan and Jordin Francis play Sander and Barron, two talented friends who like hip hop. Tess (Meaghan Martin) decides to go to Camp Star. At the Final Jam, she and Luke Sing “Tear it Down” Frankie Jonas plays Trevor. He takes video of the camp at that video is used at Final Jam when Camp Rock plays What We Came Here For.\n\nThere is a lot of funny parts in Camp Rock 2. There was also a lot of cool songs. At the end, there is a show down between the camps!\n\nI was lucky enough to go to a screening of Camp Rock 2 a few months before it was on TV. We went to the Disney Studios and watched it there. After we met Paul Hoen and a few other people who made the movie. That was cool. They didn’t let us take cameras in but that’s where the pic above was taken.\n\nDemi Lovato plays Mitchie Torres. I met her at a free concert in Glendale. She signed my Friends For Change Poster and was really sweet. She tried to meet a whole lot of fans that day, so I only saw her for a little while.\n\nI haven’t officially met the Jonas Brothers but I went to and their Burn It Up tour, the Road Dogs Game and and The Camp Rock 2 tour in September 2010. I had front row seats so I really enjoyed the concert. I met Ashley Greene there. We went to the bathroom and when we came back, she was in our seat! I took a pic bit it doesn’t really belong here.\n\nSome of the Cast of Camp Rock\n\nDemi and Joe singing Wouldn’t Change a Thing\n\nI’ve met many members of the cast at different events, screenings, premieres, and charities. They have all been nice. I hope you follow them all on Twitter and follow @CR2News .. they are huge supporters of the movie and members of the cast!\n\nMarie Canals-Barrera before the concert\n\nMaria also plays Theresa, the mom on Wizards of Waverly Place. She is married to David Barrera and have two little girls. She is very nice and helps charities and her daughters’ school. She even did a book reading at a local book store and invited her fans to come down to meet her.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at @Maria_CB\n\nAlyson Stoner at the Step-Up 3D Premiere\n\nI’ve met Alyson about 7 times. She is an awesome dancer and loves to support her friends and charities. She went to Shane Harper’ s concert at the Roxy. She was also at the premiere of Jake T. Austin’s movie The Perfect Game. She attended Debby Ryan’s 16 Wishes premiere and she played basketball with the Hollywood Knights. I met her at these events and a couple of charity events too. She is SOOOOOOO sweet.\n\nFollow her at @AlysonOnTour\n\nRoshon Fegan at 16 Wishes Premiere\n\nRoshon was great in Camp Rock but he is even more amazing as Ty in Shake it Up. He is 18 and I’ve met him a couple of times at premieres and at tapings. He is very nice and sweet and super talented.\n\nFollow him at @YaBoyRo\n\nChloe Bridges at 16 Wishes Premiere\n\nChloe Bridges at a charity event in LA\n\nChloe starred in Legally Blondes with Britanny Curran and was Dana in CR2. A lot of people wished that Nick was singing to them instead of her!\n\nI’ve met her at a premiere and a charity. She was very nice to me and my friends.\n\nHer Twitter is @ChloeBridges\n\nMDot at a charity event in Hollywood\n\nMatthew Finley , MDot plays Luke Williams. He is so talented and sweet. I wrote a whole blog just for him. Please check it out!\n\nHis Twitter is @4MDot please follow him.\n\nMeaghan Martin\n\nI only met Meaghan who plays Tess one time. She was very nice.\n\nHer Twitter is @EtteJNahgaem\n\nI loved the movie! I think Demi and the Jonas Brothers are great together. I loved all the supporting cast and I hope they all have a lot of success in their lives and their careers.\n\nI hope you liked this Blog, my mom and I worked hard on it!\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @AlexiRob\n\nCheck my pics of another stars on Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexirob/\n\nPlease share this with friends ..\n\nThanks"
