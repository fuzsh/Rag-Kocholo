        "text": "Olivia Rodrigo Then\n\nRemember Olivia Rodrigo in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\"? Of course, you do. Before she played the series’ central character, Rodrigo was also on another Disney show as Paige Olivera on “Bizaardvark” for three years (2016 to 2019).\n\nShe met her first serious boyfriend, Ethan Wacker while filming but her relationship with High School Musical co-star Joshua Bassett made pop culture history. The Nini-Ricky pairing had blossomed into a real-life romance! What’s more? It allegedly involved a love triangle with fellow Disney star Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Now\n\nWhat’s Olivia Rodrigo doing today? From Disney star to Grammy-winning artist, Rodrigo’s taken her career to the next level. Her breakthrough single “Driver’s License” (2021) reached the top of the charts everywhere. The lyrics led fans to speculate that Rodrigo may be referring to the supposed love triangle involving Sabrina and Josh. The three actors have never addressed the rumors.\n\nRodrigo and Basset never even confirmed they were dating back then. Love triangles or not, Rodrigo has arrived as a musician and songwriter. She writes about love, heartbreak, and finding herself – not unlike her idol, Taylor Swift.\n\nMadison Hu Then\n\nMadison Hu kickstarted her journey on Disney as Marci, a recurring role on “Best Friends Forever” (2015). While the show wrapped up in 2016, big prospects were on the horizon for the Texas-born actor.\n\nShe’s best known for playing songwriter Frankie Wong on “Bizaardvark” from 2016 to 2019. She brilliantly embodied the quirks and humor of her character on the show. The teen star kept her dating life private — no alleged rumors or whispers about her love life made the rounds.\n\nMadison Hu Now\n\nMadison Hu has appeared in numerous films and shows since “Bizaardvark.” Hu appeared in two episodes of “The Misadventures of Psyche & Me.” (2018). She played the role of Jessica on the show. You might even remember her as Chelsea Nevins in “Remnants of the Fallen” (2020).\n\nShe also played Anda in the 2021 film “Voyagers.” Her character’s inherent goodness is at odds with a mission to colonize another planet. Hu continues to keep her private life private.\n\nRowan Blanchard Then\n\nFor anyone obsessed with “Girl Meets World” (2014), the quirky Rowan Blanchard needs no introduction. Blanchard’s portrayal of Topanga in the Disney series earned her tremendous fame. Before her breakout role, Blanchard played Caitlin on the TV series “Dance-A Lot Robot.” Later, Blanchard played one of the central characters in “Invisible Sister,” a Disney Channel Original Movie based on a book of the same name by Sara Pinto and Beatrice Colin.\n\nAlthough mostly hearsay, the actor was romantically linked to “Girl Meets World” co-stars Peyton Meyer and Uriah Shelton.\n\nRowan Blanchard Now\n\nRowan Blanchard’s glow-up has been pretty amazing. Not only does the fashionable star have plenty of starring roles, but she also advocates for numerous causes close to her. Post-Disney, she had recurring roles on “The Goldbergs\" (2013) and “Splitting Up Together”(2018). She uses her social media channels to discuss gender equality, intersectional feminism, teen mental health, and planned parenthood.\n\nThe actor has also reprised the role of Alexandra Cavill in “Snowpiercer” since 2020. While always private about her love life, fans on social media discovered she was dating model Franklin Ayzenberg. The two are reportedly still dating.\n\nSabrina Carpenter Then\n\nThe world may remember her as the other girl in a love triangle, but Sabrina Carpenter is much more than that. Her breakout role was the rebellious Maya Hart in Disney’s “Girl Meets World” (2014), where she displayed not just her acting talents but powerful vocal abilities.\n\nIn 2014, the singer released a four-song EP titled “Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying,” followed by a debut album “Eyes Wide Open” in 2015. Prior to playing Maya, Carpenter appeared in numerous films and shows, including the Disney movies “Austin & Ally” (2011) and “Gulliver Quinn” (2012).\n\nSabrina Carpenter Now\n\nSabrina Carpenter continued acting after the show wrapped up. She’s appeared in numerous films over the years, including “The Hate U Give” (2018), Netflix’s “Work It” (2020), “Tall Girl” (2019), and the Disney movie “Clouds” (2020). As to her alleged feud with Rodrigo, the internet can’t seem to let things go. When Carpenter released her visceral track, “Skins” (2021), wild speculation ensued!\n\nThe timing certainly didn't help things with the single coming out soon after “Driver's License,” where Rodrigo supposedly refers to her as the other woman. The singer took to Instagram to clarify that “Skins” was no diss track, just an outlet for her emotions.\n\nMadison Pettis Then\n\nMadison Pettis was destined for stardom. The talented actor began receiving modeling offers when she was only five. By the time she turned eight, Pettis landed her first Disney role in “Hannah Montana” (2006) as Sophie Martinez – daughter of President Richard Martinez.\n\nIn 2007, she returned as Sophie Martinez, this time as part of “Cory in the House.” That same year, she starred alongside Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson” as his long-lost daughter, Peyton Kelly in “The Game Plan.” Later, Pettis had a recurring role as Janelle in the Disney XD series “Lab Rats” (2012).\n\nMadison Pettis Now\n\nHer Disney days might be behind her, but Madison Pettis refuses to slow down. She voiced the character of Zuri in “The Lion Guard” from 2016 to 2019. We also saw her play Natasha Bennet on “Five Points” (2018).\n\nAdditionally, she starred in “He’s All That”, a remake of the 1999 hit film “She’s All That.\" Over the years, the gorgeous actor has made the news for her many romantic links – a list of names that include Jaden Smith and NBA star Michael Porter Jr.\n\nChina Ann McClain Then\n\nChina Ann McClain’s rise to fame was nothing short of meteoric. At the young age of 7, McLain’s incredible singing helped her land a pivotal role in “Spy Kids 2” (2002). The rest was history. Disney fans know and love her as Chyna Parks on “A.N.T. Farm” (2011). Her vocals powered the show’s theme song.\n\nShe also knocked everyone’s socks off with a cover of “Dynamite” by Taio Cruz. The track soared to No 2. on the Billboard chart for kids’ digital songs. Later, McClain worked on several projects for the Disney franchise, such as “Wizards of Waverley Place” (2007), and “Jonas” (2009.)\n\nChina Ann McClain Now\n\n“A.N.T. Farm” may have ended in 2014, but China Ann McClain’s career was just getting started. From 2007, the actor was synonymous with the character of Jazmine Payne in the series “House of Payne.” She bid farewell to Jazmine in 2020 when the show ended. She’s also made her OTT debut on Netflix’s “Hubie Halloween” (2020).\n\nMcClain portrayed the role of Jennifer Pierce in “Black Lightning” (2018) for three seasons before leaving the show to pursue other passions. Who’s she dating these days? We might not know for a while since the star is known for being a private person.\n\nCarlon Jeffery Then\n\nCarlon Jeffrey began acting in community productions at the age of 8. His big break came in when the young star bagged the role of Chris in “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” (2005).\n\nJeffrey also played Damon Dawson on the hit series “Heroes” (2006). But most people know him as Cameron Parks – the self-professed ladies’ man on Disney’s “A.N.T. Farm” (2011). Jeffrey was memorable as the young Parks, trying to break out of his sister’s shadow.\n\nCarlon Jeffery Now\n\nJefferey continues to act in his adult life. In 2014, he starred in the Disney Original movie “Cloud 9” and appeared in one episode of “Kickin’ It\" (2011). Jeffrey has also reinvented himself as a rapper, MC, and acting coach.\n\nHe’s pursuing his music career under the pseudonym Lil C-Note. Hard to believe, but the actor is also a dad now. Jeffery married Yaneris Mendiola, and the couple welcomed a baby girl in 2017.\n\nSierra McCormick Then\n\nSierra McCormick is best known for her breakout role as therapist Olive Doyle in “A.N.T. Farm” (2011). McCormick came to the audition, only to discover it wasn’t an audition. They never asked her to do improv or act out scenes. The producers asked her to talk about tigers instead.\n\nWhen McCormick finished speaking, they were sure they had found their Olive Doyle. Around this time, the actor also landed a recurring role as Connie Thompson in “Jessie” (2011). Later, the young actor starred in numerous shows including, “Hannah Montana” (2006), “Curb Your Enthusiasm” (2000), and “CSI\" (2000).\n\nSierra McCormick Now\n\nLife after Disney has been busy for Sierra McCormick. She played one of the central characters in the 2015 horror flick “Some Kind of Hate,\" which received positive reviews on the festival circuit. The actor also starred in “Vast of Night” (2019).\n\nCritics lauded the sci-fi film, widely considered one of the best movies of 2020. The actor also starred in “Camp” (2020) and the psychological drama “We Need to Do Something” (2021).\n\nJake Short Then\n\nJake Short’s career in Hollywood began almost immediately after he moved to L.A. to look for work. His breakthrough moment arrived when he signed on to play Scott Smith in the crime series “Dexter” (2006). Around this time, Disney had plans for an ambitious children’s series called “A.N.T. Farm.”\n\nLater, the actor also appeared in “Mighty Med” (2013) and “Labs Rats: Elite Force” (2016). The actor also found and lost various loves during this period – including co-stars China Anne McClain, Paris Berelc, and Alexxis Lemire.\n\nJake Short Now\n\nJake Short kept a low profile after Disney compared to his other contemporaries, but he never stopped acting. In 2018, he appeared in a 10-episode series called “All Night.”\n\nShort then starred in “The First Team” (2020), a riveting BBC sports comedy series. The role seemed tailor-made for the actor, who could show off some of his soccer skills in the film. He continues to take on new acting projects.\n\nMiley Cyrus Then\n\nFew people have influenced a generation and pop culture like Miley Cyrus in “Hannah Montana” (2006). The Hannah Montana era swept the world off its feet spawning tours, a movie, and several albums. It seems everyone wanted a piece of Miley Cyrus. She began dating Nick Jonas during this time, and the two quickly became Disney’s newest “it” couple.\n\nEven though the role catapulted Cyrus to stardom, it wasn’t long before cracks began to appear. The world began to sense her unease and a desire to ditch the bubblegum persona that had made her famous.\n\nMiley Cyrus Now\n\nThe star came in like a wrecking ball, tearing down anything holding her back from a fresh start. Miley Cyrus's first act of defiance was chopping off and bleaching her signature Hannah Montana hair. Her salacious twerking routine at the 2013 VMA Awards raised plenty of eyebrows. She also released her album “Bangerz” in 2013, signaling the arrival of a brand-new Miley.\n\nSince then, the singer has also married, divorced, reunited, and broken up again with Liam Hemsworth. Media and public opinion notwithstanding, her transformation is fascinating and endlessly entertaining.\n\nHilary Duff Then\n\nDuff, as the clumsy but relatable teen in “Lizzie McGuire” (2001), was a household name. She reprised the role in 2003 for “Lizzie McGuire: The Movie.” Duff also starred in “Cadet Kelly” (2002) and bagged her first major movie role in “Agent Cody Banks” (2003).\n\nLove and romance were in the air as well. The young starlet had an on-again-off-again relationship with Aaron Carter and later with Frankie Muniz. On top of that, the star released her first full-length studio album “Metamorphosis” (2003), which topped the U.S. and Canada charts.\n\nHilary Duff Now\n\nYou can call Hilary Duff many things, but “so yesterday” isn’t one of them. After Disney, she made appearances in “Raise Your Voice” (2004), “A Cinderella Story” (2004), and “Younger” (2015). She has also recorded five studio albums and gone on tour to promote them. Duff married Matthew Koma in 2019, and the couple is now proud parents to two children. She co-parents her first son, Luca, with Mike Comrie, her ex-husband.\n\nIn 2021, Duff played the role of Sophie in “How I Met Your Father”, the spin-off series of “How I Met Your Mother.”\n\nShia LaBeouf Then\n\nShia LaBeouf is best known for playing the naughty Louis Stevens on “Even Stevens” (2000). The show’s massive popularity prompted Disney Channel executives to create a TV movie version. LaBeouf was on a roll, and little did he know this was just the beginning.\n\nSoon, major blockbuster projects came knocking for the talented LaBeouf, including “Transformers” (2007) and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008). Although fans were curious, the actor never divulged details about his relationships or life outside the big screen.\n\nShia LaBeouf Now\n\nLaBeouf’s life after Disney has been eventful, and that’s putting it mildly. The actor made appearances in movies such as “Honey Boy” (2019), “The Peanut Butter Falcon” (2019), and “Pieces of a Woman”(2020). He also made his directorial debut with a short film titled “Let’s Love Hate” (2004).\n\nOn the personal front, LaBeouf’s journey has been far from peachy. He’s had several run-ins with the law due to substance abuse. The star was arrested for public drunkenness during a particularly raucous night in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nJake Thomas Then\n\nJake Thomas is best known for his character, Matt in “Lizzie McGuire\" (2001). You remember Matt. He was Lizzie’s younger annoying brother, forever scheming and pranking his older sister and her friends.\n\nBefore his breakout Disney role, Thomas also appeared in “If Tomorrow Comes” (2000). His showbiz career began early since his parents had their own radio and television shows. The day Thomas was born, he appeared on his mother’s TV show, live from the nursery!\n\nJake Thomas Now\n\nAfter “Lizzie McGuire”, the actor continued to act in numerous shows. He landed a role in Steven Spielberg’s “A.I. Artificial Intelligence.” (2001). The child star also graduated from high school and attended California State University to study Japanese and screenwriting. Later, he appeared in shows such as “Cory in the House\" (2007), “CSI Miami” (2002), “Criminal Minds” (2005), and “House\" (2004).\n\nIt appears he found another career calling over the years. Thomas is a director and a well-known entertainment photographer.\n\nDylan and Cole Sprouse Then\n\nCole and Dylan Sprouse landed their first acting gigs while still in diapers! The twins appeared in several cult shows and films of the '90s, such as “Big Daddy” (1999), “Friends” (1994), and “That '70s Show” (1998). But they came into their own in 2005 on Disney's “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\", one of the network’s most successful premieres, bringing in over four million viewers.\n\nThe show ended in 2008, but the brothers continued appearing in various spin-offs of other Disney classics, including “Hannah Montana,” (2006), “Wizards Of Waverley Place” (2007), and “That’s So Raven” (2003).\n\nDylan and Cole Sprouse Now\n\nThe siblings took a break to attend New York University. Dylan kept a low profile for a few years, preferring to act in independent and short films. Meanwhile, Cole’s career reached dizzying new heights after he landed the role of Jughead in “Riverdale” (2017). The twins haven’t worked on a project together since their Disney Days but they are not ruling it out.\n\nCole also gained a reputation for dating his co-stars. His last serious relationship was with Lili Reinhart, who plays Betty Cooper on “Riverdale.” Dylan is currently dating Barbara Palvin.\n\nDemi Lovato Then\n\nDemi Lovato began acting at the age of 10. The star got their first big TV break on “Barney & Friends.” Lovato made their Disney debut on a show called “As the Bell Rings” (2007) and later landed the starring role in “Sonny With a Chance” (2009).\n\nDemi's Disney journey and career took off in earnest with a lead role on “Camp Rock” (2008) alongside Joe Jonas. While filming the movie, Lovato recorded and sang three songs for the soundtrack. Since then, the singer-actor has put out several solo releases.\n\nDemi Lovato Now\n\nThe last few years have been challenging for Lovato, battling an eating disorder and substance abuse — the trauma leading her down a path of self-harm. With consistent help and effort, the star is on a journey to recovery today. Demi is a passionate spokesperson and source of support for people going through what they did. Despite personal struggles, Lovato cemented their career as a successful pop star.\n\nLovato has also released a YouTube series with unfiltered and intimate details about their life, career, and addiction struggles.\n\nZac Efron Then\n\nZac made his TV debut in 2002 on an episode of “Firefly.” A young Efron also appeared as Cameron Bale in “Summerland” (2004). But the star got his breakthrough role in 2006 as Troy Bolton in “High School Musical.” The original series became a cult phenomenon, firmly establishing Efron as the new heartthrob of a generation.\n\nWhen fans came to know he was dating co-star Vanessa Hudgens, the response was mixed – equal amounts of heartbreak and delight. The world couldn’t get enough. So of course, there was High School Musical 2 (2008) and 3 (2009) as well.\n\nZac Efron Now\n\nMany teen actors struggle to shed their Disney tag, but not Zac Efron. He established himself as a serious actor – appearing in movies like “Neighbors” (2014) and “The Greatest Showman” (2014). The actor got his OTT break on “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile,” a 2019 Netflix crime drama where he played serial killer Ted Bundy. Efron even hosted his own travel series on Netflix titled “Down to Earth With Zac Efron” (2020).\n\nThe actor also went from gawky teen to hunky heartthrob. Over the years, he’s dated Lily Collins, Sami Miró, and Vanessa Valladares but is now reportedly single.\n\nSelena Gomez Then\n\nAlthough Selena Gomez was the veritable Disney darling, her first TV role was as Gianna on “Barney & Friends” (1992). She made her Disney debut on “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” (2005), where her stellar performance as Gwen led to other Disney projects.\n\nShe played mean Mikayla in “Hannah Montana\" (2006). Later, the star bagged the starring role in “Wizards of Waverley Place” from 2007 to 2012. She also began making music alongside her acting career and signed with Hollywood Records in 2008. Soon after, the internet found a new obsession – her tumultuous relationship with Justin Bieber.\n\nSelena Gomez Now\n\nGomez built a mega-successful career. In 2013, her first solo album, “Stars Dance,” debuted at No.1 on the U.S. Billboard charts. In 2020, she released “Rare,” her third studio album, and launched a beauty line with the same name. The star has dated a few good men, including Zedd, and Charlie Puth. Despite briefly getting back with Justin Bieber, she seems to have moved on, for good this time.\n\nIn 2021 she began working on a new show, “Only Murders in the Building” with Steve Martin and Martin Short, the show became a high success.\n\nKeke Palmer Then\n\nWe first saw Keke Palmer in a small role on “Barbershop 2: Back in Business” (2004) as Tina’s (Queen Latifah) niece. After the show, the Illinois–born actor found numerous singing and acting projects. In 2007, Palmer made her Disney debut with “Jump In!” – a movie about a boxer who unexpectedly gets pulled into a Double Dutch tournament.\n\nShe portrayed the character of Mary on the show that also featured two of her original songs – “Jumpin’” and “It’s My Turn Now.” Despite a successful stint on Disney, her role on the Nickelodeon sitcom “True Jackson VP” (2008) is widely considered one of her best works.\n\nKeke Palmer Now\n\nPalmer has had several starring roles since “Jump In!” wrapped up in 2011. You may have seen her on the \"90210\" reboot in 2013. She landed one of her bigger roles in the horror series \"Scream Queens\" (2015) by Fox. The actor went on to star in “Berlin Station” (2017) and “Scream: The TV series\" (2019).\n\nShe also acted alongside Jennifer Lopez in the critically acclaimed film “Hustlers” in 2019.
