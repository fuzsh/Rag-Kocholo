Coauthoring a book isn’t quite like synchronized swimming. It’s more like gaining perspective and depth through incongruity. Through writing and arguing in what seemed like endless and percussive to-and-froing, helped along by endless and percussive e-mailing, we strove to achieve a coherent voice. But first, to honor the differences, we thought it only appropriate to offer our individual reflections on this project and its meaning.\n\nFrom Warren Bennis:–That I would eventually write a book on geeks and geezers will come as a surprise to no one. I have almost always allowed personal experience to peek through in my work, however distanced and objective the surface. When I was a younger man, I never thought of myself as a geek. At the time, the word did not mean a nerdy, technologically sophisticated person in the mold of Bill Gates. A geek was a carnival performer who made his living biting the heads off live chickens—and that’s still the only definition you’ll find in any but the most recent dictionaries. Although I did not know I was a geek (in the current sense) when I was one, I am acutely aware that, in the eyes of the world at least, I am now a full-fledged geezer—born in 1925 and seasoned\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage x\n\nx Preface\n\nTE\n\nAM FL Y\n\non the now almost mythological battlefields of World War II. I will spare you a protracted discussion of such autumnal truths as the fact that all of us stay 16 in our hearts and, at some point, look into the mirror and wonder who that white-haired person is. If you are my age, you already know that; if you are younger, you will learn it soon enough. But I will tell you a little about how this book came to be. Information guru and intellectual matchmaker Richard Saul Wurman called me several years ago and asked if I would speak at one of his annual TED conferences. As you probably know, TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. And every year Richard gathers a group of people he finds interesting—and a somewhat larger group of people willing to pay to be around that core group—for three days of observation, prognostication, idea swapping, food, drink, bombast, and schmoozing. “This year, Warren,” Richard told me, “we’re only inviting speakers seventy years and older and thirty years and younger.” I thought Richard was onto something here, as he usually is. A project began to coalesce around the idea that geeks and geezers have valuable but different things to contribute to almost any discussion. Both groups know things that all of us should know. Much of the appeal of this project-in-the-making was the opportunity to delve deeper into the thought world of geeks, the cohort born around 1970 and after that has preoccupied the media, and especially the business media, for almost a decade. Nothing gives me greater joy than learning something new, and I realized there was a gap in my understanding of the views and values of these geeks and their younger brothers and sisters—the first generation, as Bob and I say in our book, to have grown up virtual, visual, and digital. The realization that there were holes in my understanding of what motivated and moved the young was most vivid in the classroom. For several years, University of Southern California president Steve Sample and I have cotaught a course on leadership at USC. Every year, we invite Michael Dukakis to speak to our class. As all of you who are over 30 know, Dukakis was the Democratic\n\nTeam-Fly®\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xi\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\ncandidate for president in 1988 and a distinguished governor of Massachusetts. But our students, bright as they are, tend to look back blankly when we excitedly announce that Mike will be speaking to them. The few who recognized his name knew it from reruns of the “Saturday Night Live” parody of Mike’s ill-fated campaign tank ride, in which comic Jon Lovitz impersonated him. I know that most of our students, however bright and well informed, tend to think of Vietnam, Watergate, and other landmarks of the last forty years as distant, even ancient history. But I am always a little shaken that so many have never heard of Michael Dukakis, whose run for president seems so recent to me. Besides wanting to probe the minds and experiences of geeks, I was also eager to learn more about my fellow geezers. As a lifelong student of leadership, I’ve always been fascinated both by those who become leaders and those who don’t. Just as intriguing as great leaders, in many ways, are those gifted people who somehow get stuck and never manage to actualize their talents. The frustration of talent and the embitterment that usually follows is one of the saddest phenomena I know—and one of the most instructive. Moreover, I have always been interested in development, even before I took up the subject of becoming a leader. In 1956, my first published paper was about group development. By 1964, I was writing about organizational development, and about the correspondences between healthy individuals and healthy organizations. Growth and change have been the major themes of my entire professional life. Not surprisingly, in recent years, I’ve grown ever more curious as to why some people seem to age and others do not. We all know people who hit 70, say, and suddenly look and act old, with all the diminution and loss that term has traditionally implied. And yet, thankfully, there are others who manage to stay forever young, whatever their chronological age. To some extent, the difference is probably genetic. But it is not only that. There is some other quality that allows a Rudolph Serkin to dare, at the age of 80, to master an entirely new, modern repertoire when he might so easily have continued to perform more traditional music forever. Or\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xii\n\nxii Preface take 76-year-old film director Robert Altman, who keeps reinventing himself with such films as his 2001 Gosford Park. People like Serkin and Altman, or dancer Martha Graham (who transcended the blow of being fired by her own troupe and reinvented herself as a crowd-pleasing lecturer/performer), or Winston Churchill (who, one of his biographers wrote, jay-walked his way through life until he was 66), have a secret that all of us would do well to discover. They are proof, heartening to see, that growing old does not preclude living life with enormous brio. Meanwhile, at another TED Conference, I ran into old friend Phil Slater, the gifted sociologist and writer. I told him about the geeks and geezers project and talked excitedly about a couple of great geezers I had interviewed and the almost magical quality of excitement and engagement they radiated. “Neoteny,” Phil said. “It’s called neoteny.” Later, I asked him to elaborate, and he answered with an autobiographical e-mail. “I often feel isolated because so many of the people I know,” he wrote, “have ‘settled’ in some way. The world has jelled for them—closed. It no longer has the sense of possibility that it had for many of us as children. The neoteny I was talking about has to do with the fact that some of us have kept that sense of possibility and wonder alive. I’m not sure what all is involved in that or why it happens, but I see it in a lot of successful people (it’s why they’re so much more fun to talk to about ideas than academics are), and it’s very meaningful to me.” Much of this book is about that remarkable quality. In the fall of 1999, I was in London, having lunch with Tom Davenport, a partner at Accenture and author. With Tom was colleague Bob Thomas. A Northwestern-trained sociologist and former MIT professor, Bob told me of his deep interest in the impact that era has on leadership. It was clear that Bob and I were covering some of the same ground and moving in the same direction, and I realized, almost at once, what a find he was and what a fine collaborator he would be. Again and again, he sharpened my thinking and we pulled from each other insights neither of us would have had working alone. He was an intellectual sparring partner of the first order and a generous soul. The truth is that I am not\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xiii\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nsure, and don’t think Bob is either, about who came up with this or that idea. As the best projects always do, this one turned out to be even more interesting than we thought it would be. You will discover all that we did in the pages that lie ahead, but let me make one point at the outset. It soon became clear that we were studying not just lifetime leadership, but how people learn to live well decade after decade. The more we talked to our geeks and geezers, the more apparent it became that this was a story not just about leadership development but about human development. At some point, we realized that the two are inexplicably intertwined, that the very factors that make a person a great leader are the ones that make him or her a successful, healthy human being. It was a thrilling “eureka!” moment. Want to find out how able a leader an individual will be? Look at how he or she deals with being imprisoned, as our geezer Sidney Rittenberg was. (Rittenberg was imprisoned for sixteen years by the Chinese Communists.) The leadership of a Rittenberg or a Nelson Mandela doesn’t magically appear when the spotlight is turned upon them. It was there, waiting to be expressed, long before the prison doors swung open, thanks to the qualities and almost alchemical process that we will describe in depth in the coming chapters. As we have talked to different audiences about geeks and geezers, we find that certain of our key ideas excite them most. The crucible—the transformational experience that all our leaders have had—is one. Era is another. David Gergen recently asked me to talk about the book at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, which Gergen heads. Afterwards, he excitedly covered the blackboard with notes on the impact of different eras on recent history. Leaders like Truman, he pointed out, were shaped by World War I, the growth of big business, and the idea of the melting pot. Subsequent leaders such as JFK and George Herbert Walker Bush were formed in the crucible of World War II and came of age in a nation unified by its fight for its very survival. A distinguished commentator and advisor to four presidents, Gergen then spoke movingly of his own\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\nxiv\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xiv\n\nPreface\n\ngeneration. Like Gergen, former President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and the younger President Bush were all children of the 1960s, who grew up in a nation divided over the Vietnam War, in a nation of divided families. None of the presidents served in that war. Most poignantly, Gergen contrasted their formative era of fragmentation and national discord with that of earlier eras that seemed to share a common purpose and simpler values. I can only hope that all our readers respond to our study of geeks and geezers as thoughtfully, enthusiastically, and personally as Gergen did.\n\nFrom Bob Thomas:–A few years back, while watching choreographer Twyla Tharp lead a class with her students at City Center in New York, I learned something important about practice. I am not a dancer, but I sensed that Tharp’s students were struggling to understand what she wanted them to do with a particularly complex combination of moves (or phrases, in the grammar of dance). Marveling at the back-and-forth interrogation, the demonstration and mimicking of physical gestures, and the quiet but earnest pleading to “do it my way” taking place between choreographer and dancers, I realized that in that moment, the distinction between practice and performance hardly existed at all. They were performing while they practiced. I could easily imagine them onstage a few weeks hence practicing while they performed. Watching Twyla Tharp and her dancers, I was reminded that business managers routinely complain that they don’t have time to “practice” being leaders. They have to perform all the time. Each in his or her own way genuinely wants to improve as a leader but doesn’t know how. They enroll in leadership workshops, pay for coaching sessions, and pack off to weekend retreats, but the lessons just don’t seem to stick. From my perch in the balcony that night in Manhattan, I realized that the problem wasn’t that managers couldn’t learn to lead. What they lacked was a concept of practice. To be more precise, they needed a way to practice while they performed. After creating an experimental curriculum for the Leaders for Manufacturing Program at MIT—a curriculum that included dance\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xv\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nlessons for engineers—I left the university to see what I could learn about leadership practice by watching effective leaders perform. Along the way I had the great fortune to work with business, union, and political leaders in the United States, Venezuela, Jamaica, India, Germany, and Japan. And the effective ones, the ones who truly engaged their people as what Warren calls “intimate allies,” were the men and women who practiced leading every moment of every day. They recognized no distinction between work and life. They were the same people on the job and off. They used every situation they encountered as a practice field and they mined every experience for insight about themselves and the people and the world around them. Leading is not only what they did, it was who they were. Which brings me to geeks and geezers. Warren and I first talked about studying older and younger leaders only a few days after a former student of mine called to say he was departing a very senior position in a conventional bricks-and-mortar manufacturing firm for the wilds of online retailing. I understood his sense of adventure, but what I didn’t get was why he would walk away from almost certain success. Sighing, he warned me, “White guys in their fifties and sixties just don’t get it.” I hastened to remind him that I wasn’t 50 yet. But, reluctantly, I had to admit that I didn’t get it either. This project with Warren gave me the opportunity to see if I could get it. I think now that I do. Warren G. Bennis Santa Monica, CA Robert J.

Especially when you know that this book would never have seen the (de)light of day if it hadn’t been for the dozens of individuals and groups and institutions who served, one way or another, as cheerleaders, supporters, midwives, producers, critics, advisors, subjects, facilitators, sponsors, connectors, listeners, reviewers, and so on. One of our favorite book dedications goes simply “Without whom . . . .” Well, there are many “whoms” to whom we want to express our gratitude. In fact, we wish we could roll the credits the way films and TV shows do, with all the subtleties that the insiders understand, like best boy and gaffer and ADs, caterers, creators, executive and coproducers, and so forth. In a way, this book was developed like a film or TV show. First of all, we have a producer, Tom Davenport, a distinguished author and director of Accenture’s Institute for Strategic Change. His support and uncurbed enthusiasm, plus his ability to provide the generous financial and intellectual resources, were critical. You couldn’t want for a better maestro than Tom. Along the way, he enrolled a few coproducers from within Accenture. Mike May, along with John Rollins and Chris Burrows, recognized the value of investigating generational differences in leadership style. They\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\nxviii\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\ngave us the stage, the cameras, the crews, and the wherewithal for this project. Inspirational leaders all. Then we had a “High Concept”: comparing the Digital Set with the Analog Set, the 70-years-plus leaders with the 30-yearold leaders, the geeks and geezers. That was handed to us by Richard Saul Wurman, the whiz, master impresario, stand-up creative genius who convened one of his TED conferences in Monterey in 2000, where the only invited speakers were 70 years and older and 30 years and younger. He had two titles for this conference, Geeks and Geezers, which he allowed us to steal, and the less catchy but delightful Will and Still. We also assembled a terrific cast who agreed to work without fees and showed up on time. Robert Altman, who was himself shooting Gosford Park in England and was unable to join us, couldn’t have done better. We’re talking about our “subjects,” really our coinvestigators, our geeks and geezers, who dropped what they were doing to appear with us. Though not as well known as Maggie Smith or Michael Gambon, Muriel Siebert and Sidney Harman have as much presence on life’s stage as any of Altman’s cast. Just about every idea in this book came from one of our stars. We also had a number of consultants and advisors, paid and unpaid. The Harvard Business School Press sent out advance copies for “peer review” to a slew of people who were paid equity fees, which means enough to pay for postage and make copies at Kinko’s. So we can’t credit them publicly though we have an idea or two about who they are. Not naming them is much the same as when Jack Nicholson or Meryl Streep makes one of their cameo appearances and goes unlisted when the credits are rolled. So thanks to all those behind-the-scenes folks who gave us, sight unseen, such terrific suggestions. We also profited enormously from the tips, admonitions, and wisdom given us by a wide number of scholarly friends. We want to single out a number of them—a banquet of “whoms.” First, to get even close to meeting our own expectations of what this book could be, the counsel of Robert Butler and James\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xix\n\nAcknowledgments xix Birren, the two pioneers and virtual founders of the field of gerontology, was essential. We also want to thank Edward Schneider and Caleb Finch of USC’s School of Gerontology; Howard Gardner, Roger Gould, Hal Leavitt, Gil Levin, Mel Roman, and George Vaillant, all more knowledgeable about the field of human development than we are and, just as important, such generous minds. We also have to add—are bursting with pride to add— Will Bennis, working on his Ph.D. in human development at the University of Chicago. He has served us well, like a mentor. (He also interviewed his dad for this book.) Others whose ideas have advanced our thinking are Nitin Nohria, David Gergen, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Jean LipmanBlumen, Lester Thurow, Paul Lagace, Jan Houbolt, and Barbara Kellerman. Barbara deserves major kudos for weighing in with her intellectual heft from the very beginning of our work. She also has the useful talent for asking the annoyingly right questions. We also want to single out the redoubtable Horace Deets, who only recently stepped down from a long run of success as executive director of the AARP. Horace, to be fair, was concerned about our title. We reassured him that the geeks wouldn’t mind at all. His wisdom and his leadership of AARP serve as an exemplar of all we’ve been writing about here. To continue the movie metaphor, we’ve had some “sneak previews” at various venues over the past two years or so. The truth is that neither of us has ever written a book quite like this. We wanted to present our central ideas to live audiences before committing our words to paper. So we opened in Monterey, California, at the TED conference in February, 2001; in March at USC’s Provost Writers Series; in August at Gil Levin’s Cape Cod Institute; in October at Harvard to the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership; and in November to Boston University’s School of Management, the Linkage Global Leadership Institute, and the Leadership and Behavioral Sciences faculty at West Point. These “sneak previews” were, for us, like focus groups, helping us clarify our ideas and learn, as they say in Hollywood, what’s hot and what’s not.\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xx\n\nxx Acknowledgments\n\nTE\n\nAM FL Y\n\nBecause we videotaped nearly all of our interviews, we had several production teams. Marina Kalb and Michael Kirk, professional filmmakers, gave advice and access to their stellar video crew contacts. Cameraman Jim Sicile recorded many of our interviews and added great fun to the task. Cary Benjamin and his team at T&R Productions helped us capture vivid moments from our tapes so that we could study them closely and illustrate our key concepts. Cherie Potts transcribed every word from our interviews and, though distant from the process, offered valuable insights. Jim Wilson, whom Bob refers to as a “literary green beret,” stepped in with brief but valuable bursts of editorial support. Alex Beal, Diana Moscone, Alyssa Bottone, Fiona Heldt, and Lawrence Tu also pitched in and gave us a hand when needed. Again, Accenture’s Institute for Strategic Change gave them the license and the time to help out. The Los Angeles crew consisted of three indispensable and longtime associates of Warren’s. His assistant at USC, Marie Christian, has an eye for error and a loupe glass for judgment. Geoff Keighley, a former student, is one of our geeks and a techie entrepreneur. (You’ll see in the book how he started his business at the advanced age of 14.) He translated almost 90 percent of the presentation material from video, interviews into PowerPoint, which at times seems like his, and other geeks’, first language. And thanks and hugs to Warren’s longtime friend and coauthor, Pat Biederman, a Los Angeles Times reporter. Her fine editorial acumen is noticeable throughout. Our research crew, from both coasts, consisted of, again, Geoff Keighley, Chris Maguire, and Margaret Stergios who contributed valuable insights on the world according to geeks, as well as expert research assistance. USC’s Marshall School of Business Administration has helped us in so many ways—a venue for our interviews, secretarial and administrative support, and wise counsel from Tom Cummings and Randy Westerfield. USC’s president and provost, Steve Sample and Lloyd Armstrong, respectively and respectfully, are owed a deep bow of thanks.\n\nTeam-Fly®\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxi\n\nAcknowledgments xxi Let us now praise some Remarkable Women: Carol Franco, the guiding light of the Harvard Business School Press, who, in her “neotenic” way (in order to understand the fullness of that compliment, read chapter 1) recruited us, encouraged us, made us feel terrific and loved throughout a rather long gestation period, and gave us access to her incredibly able staff, from the designers to the marketers to all those who can bring a superb product to market. Finally, we have been blessed to have the editorial advice of two of the most prized editors at the Press, Hollis Heimbouch and Suzanne Rotondo. The artist Georges Braque famously said that “the only thing that matters in art, can’t be explained.” Well, you can say the same thing about editing. It is an art form, and Hollis and Suzanne are virtuosi to whom we shout BRAVA! BRAVA! And yes, without whom . . . without whom this book would not make us as proud as we are. Between us we have published some thirty books. Neither of us has ever worked with a crew as supportive, as competent, as trustworthy, and as caring as the Press’s staff. Finally, a personal note. Rosanna Hertz has proven (again) her extraordinary talent as Bob’s critic, commentator, editor, cheerleader, logician, and confidante—all while chairing an academic department and moonlighting as a building contractor. A final, final personal note. Grace Gabe, who has been kept busy enough writing her own book, has been supportive and loving and more than a little helpful throughout the two and a half years it has taken her husband, Warren, to coauthor this book. Somehow or another, she was able to endure the ups-and-downs of her husband’s obsessiveness with something approaching equanimity. That’s devotion.\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxii\n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxiii\n\n\n\nG\n\nrowing up , Harry Truman never thought of himself as a leader, nor did anyone else. With “eyeglasses thick as the bottom of a Coke bottle,” historian David McCullough writes, Truman couldn’t try out for school sports and mostly stayed home, working the farm, reading, or playing the piano.1 Friends thought he was a sissy, and so did he. When he graduated high school, his family had run into hard times and he remained on the farm, the only president of the 20th century who never went to college. But the course of his life changed forever when, at the age of 33, he signed up for the Army to fight in World War I. He was shipped off to France as the head of an artillery battery, and there for the first time in his life he was forced to lead men through moments of mortal danger. His initial test came on a rainy night in the Vosges Mountains. The Germans had dropped an artillery barrage close by, and his troops, panicked that they were being gassed, ran for it. In the frenzy, Truman’s horse fell over on him and he was nearly crushed. Writes McCullough: “Out from under, seeing the others all running, he just stood there, locked in place, and called them back using every form of profanity he’d ever heard . . . shaming his men back to do what they were supposed to do.” They regrouped, got through the night and many of them eventually got home safely. Throughout the rest of their lives they\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\nxxiv\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxiv\n\nForeword\n\nwere loyal to Harry Truman, their leader who refused to back down in the face of his own fear. According to McCullough, Truman discovered two vitally important things about himself that night. First, that he had plain physical courage; second, that he was good at leading people. “He liked it and he had learned that courage is contagious. If the leader shows courage, others get the idea.” Adds McCullough: “And the war was the crucible.”2 The crucible—how important that was in Truman’s life and how central it is to the story that Warren Bennis and Robert Thomas tell in the pages of this illuminating book. Time and again, as we see here, leaders both young and old have emerged as they have faced tough—even harrowing—challenges, stiffened, adapted, and eventually have come through on the other end. Business leader Sidney Rittenberg survived sixteen years in a Chinese prison; journalist Mike Wallace was seared by the accidental death of a beloved son; Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, had to endure years of prejudice against women executives; Nathaniel Jones had to struggle against intense racial prejudice; the noted public servant John Gardner grew up quickly as a Marine officer responsible for the welfare of his men; Wendy Kopp went through numerous trials building Teach For America, the organization she founded just after she left college. These are engrossing stories and show, as the authors say, that if a person can not only survive but create positive meaning out of such experiences, she or he can grow into a durable, effective leader. Like Harry Truman, they embarked upon “a hero’s journey,” conquered their dragon, and returned in a state transformed. At least one national organization has formally embraced the idea of a crucible as a training ground for future leaders—and has found that it works. In the mid-1990s, with the economy booming and labor markets tight, the U.S. military services were struggling to meet their enlistment goals. The Army, Navy, and Air Force decided to make their services more appealing by improving living conditions, allowing recruits more time with their families, and the\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxv\n\nForeword xxv like. The Marine Corps went the other way: It toughened up. General Charles Krulak, the Commandant, introduced “The Crucible” to Marine training—an incredibly grueling fifty-four straight hours of live fire exercises, long marches, and sleep deprivation at the end of basic training. After climbing the final hill in this test, recruits are presented with the eagle, globe, and anchor emblem. And with that, finally, they are Marines. Potential recruits rallied to the idea and the corps, alone among the services, saw its enlistments shoot up. Not long ago, Seth Moulton, a young Harvard graduate who signed up to become a Marine officer in the wake of September 11, returned to Cambridge after ten weeks in Quantico and related to me that the idea of the “Crucible” has now been incorporated throughout training. For Seth, and for others like him, the Marines provide a welcome path toward positions of leadership. Yet the very fact that a crucible appears so central to the development of leaders raises questions for which we do not yet have full answers. Why, for example, do some people find times of testing and adversity a great source of strength while others become discouraged and shrivel up? If you are running an organization, how can you spot those who will succeed and those who will fail when trials come? As a mentor or teacher, how can you help someone prepare for difficulties that may lie ahead? What counsel can you offer? History has certainly made it clear that adversity often separates winners from losers. In his work Greatness: Who Makes History and Why, Dean Keith Simonton argues, “To achieve success of the highest order, a person may have to suffer first.”3 He points out that orphanhood, especially the tragic early loss of the mother, has been conducive to the development of political reformers, philosophers, and religious figures in modern times. Some 63 percent of British prime ministers between Wellington and Chamberlain suffered early parental loss. However, two other groups, juvenile delinquents and depressive or suicidal psychiatric patients, show orphanhood rates similar to those of the eminent public figures. In other words, some rise from their crucible but others certainly fall. Why?\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\nxxvi\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxvi\n\nForeword\n\nThis portrait of “geeks and geezers” also suggests that for women, it appears more difficult to gain the developmental experiences that help to shape leaders. Most of the men here were thrown into a cauldron and grew by learning how to adapt. Once in the crucible, they discovered qualities in themselves that then propelled them forward as leaders. That was certainly true of John Gardner and others who signed up for the military and were soon thrust into positions of leadership. It was true as well for Vernon Jordan, who signed up for a job in a white home and suddenly found himself struggling to assert his own identity. But the women who appear in these pages had to strike out on their own—they had to assert a significant degree of leadership before they found their crucible. Tara Church formed a national organization as a young girl; Wendy Kopp formed a national organization as a young woman. Elizabeth Kao worked her way up through Ford Motor Company. The women who emerge as leaders are far more the product of self-selection than are the men. What that suggests is that many other women have not had the same opportunities as men to discover their leadership potential and thus remain hidden. In all likelihood, that means the pool of women who develop into leaders remains smaller than the pool of men. And thus we face the inevitable question: Having encouraged greater educational opportunities for women in past years—and seeing how rapidly they have succeeded—how do we encourage greater leadership opportunities for women too? We know that women make excellent leaders; that debate is largely over. Now we must face the challenge of ensuring equal opportunities for development. This book also points to an issue about male development. Among men in the older generation of leaders, World War II was often the defining moment in their lives. As horrific as war might be, the years in uniform transformed many of those who survived. But in today’s context, even with a war on terrorism underway, the percentage of young men who serve in the military has shrunk dramatically. For kids coming out of rural America or off the streets of inner cities, that ladder up has largely disappeared. It is worth asking what, if anything, has taken its place as a crucible. If\n\nBennis i-xxx FM 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:13 PM\n\nPage xxvii\n\nForeword xxvii you come from a well-heeled family, a chance for travel and adventure is still there, but for millions of young men today— especially those who are black, Hispanic, or from rural areas— horizons can be extremely limited. We don’t offer the kind of democratizing experiences that we had in the days of a military draft when, as it was said, a Saltonstall took orders from a Polish kid from Brooklyn. Reading this excellent book, I couldn’t help but wonder how America could provide more inspiring opportunities for the potential leaders of the next generation, both men and women. Is national service an answer? Wouldn’t it help if we created a national culture in which the young were expected to give at least a year back to the country? Wouldn’t many of them find their own crucible? This is not the time or place to explore those questions, but perhaps as you join Warren Bennis and Robert Thomas in their reflections on “geeks and geezers,” you might think of ways we could inspire leaders to arise from the next generation. We need them.

B. White, sage of the New Yorker, wrote: “There is a bright future for complexity, what with one thing always leading to another.” As he so often does, White wraps a profound idea in the simplest of packages—not surprising for a man who dared to use the word crepuscular in a children’s book and created an eight-legged thought leader in Charlotte, the oracular arachnid of Charlotte’s Web.1 What White distills in his observation about complexity is a basic truth about leading and learning—about the way we discover something valuable, give it a tug, and find that it inevitably leads us to another discovery and then another. The ability to learn is a defining characteristic of being human; the ability to continue learning is an essential skill of leadership. When leaders lose that ability, they inevitably falter. When any of us lose that ability, we no longer grow.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n2\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nAt its heart, this is a book about leadership and learning and about the almost magical process by which some people succeed, however they define success, not just once but again and again. It is a book about cross-generational leadership that looks, for the first time, at two groups of leaders—our youngest and our oldest, the geeks and the geezers—and asks them to tell us what they have discovered about leading, learning, and living well in the course of their very different lives and times. It is a book that grapples with such compelling questions as why some people are able to extract wisdom from experience, however harsh, and others are not. It asks successful geeks to share the secrets of their youthful triumphs and distinguished geezers to tell us how they continue to stay active and engaged despite the changes wrought by age. What all these people have to say is so important, so useful, that we believe it will help readers find their own best strategies for leading and learning, not just for a time but for a lifetime. The predictable format for such a book would simply be to ask well-known leaders to share their secrets—that is what most books on leadership do. But this book goes beyond personal revelations to postulate a theory of leadership. An important part of that theory is recognition of the role that distinctive periods in history play in producing leaders. All of us come of age in a particular place and time—an era—that shapes us in large and small ways. Although we are rarely aware of this influence from day to day, our era determines choices both mundane and profound, from the music we prefer to the things that we long for, the things we take for granted, and much of the emotional coloration of our lives. Our geeks and geezers are no exception. In the two chapters that follow, we will attempt to place our geeks (most of them under 30) and our geezers (most in their 70s and 80s) in the historical contexts that produced them. We know that this is a little like trying to write a twelve-page version of the collected works of Shakespeare. But in order to understand what our participants have to say, it is important to keep in mind some of the major forces that shaped them.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 3\n\nImage Not Available\n\nSource: ©2002 The New Yorker Collection from cartoonbank.com. All rights reserved.\n\nThe world has changed more in the eighty or so years since our oldest leaders were born than it had in the previous millennium. To name a single remarkable difference, the world is now “wired,” a term that would have made little or no sense to the man in the street of 1920. We believe that leadership in this world of ever-accelerating change requires both the wisdom of our elders and the insights of younger people who, despite their youth, have already demonstrated their leadership ability. We often hear of the impact that 70 million baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1963, are having on every aspect of our lives, including the global economy. Too little has been said about the way the world is being transformed daily by another, even larger, cohort —the 85 million people who are now between the ages of 2 and 22.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n4\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nThis is the first cohort to grow up visual, virtual, and digital, and we ignore it at our peril.\n\nA New Model of Leadership As we explain in the preface, this book started out as a study of both young and old leaders and how era influences leadership, but it evolved into something more. As a result of our research for the book, we have developed a theory that describes, we believe for the first time, how leaders come to be. We believe that we have identified the process that allows an individual to undergo testing and to emerge, not just stronger, but equipped with the tools he or she needs both to lead and to learn. It is a model that explains how individuals make meaning out of often difficult events—we call them crucibles—and how that process of “meaning-making” both galvanizes individuals and gives them their distinctive voice. That model (shown in figure 1-1) describes a powerful chain reaction of change and growth.\n\nFigure 1-1 Our Leadership Development Model Era\n\nExperiences\n\nOrganization of meaning Individual factors\n\nCRUCIBLE\n\nLeadership competencies\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 5 Much of this book is devoted to explicating that model and showing how it is reflected in the development of leaders of all ages. The process we will explore is one that allowed Nelson Mandela not simply to survive, but to emerge from twenty-seven years in a South African prison as the most powerful moral leader since Gandhi. It is the process that forged a Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Golda Meir, and a Martin Luther King, Jr. It is the process that led one of our geezers, Sidney Rittenberg, to pioneer business ties between the United States and China after spending sixteen years in Chinese prisons during the 1940s and 1950s, and that produced gifted geeks like educational activist Wendy Kopp and serial entrepreneur Michael Klein. Our model explains how leaders develop, in whatever era, and predicts who is likely to become and remain a leader. In the pages that follow, you’ll discover why some people are able to lead for a lifetime, while others never seem able to unleash remarkable gifts. You’ll see why learning to learn is key to becoming a leader. And you’ll discover why the factors that produce leaders are the same ones that predict something far more important than professional success: They are the very factors that allow us to live happy, meaningful lives.\n\nDefining Our Terms When we first began talking about leadership as a lifetime process, we used polite, even euphemistic, terms to describe the two groups that most interested us—youthful leaders who discovered their abilities early and older ones who were able to create leadership roles for themselves decade after decade. (For a complete list of those we studied, see table 1-1 and the brief biographies in appendix A.) At first, we spoke of “younger leaders and mature leaders,” of “Greatest Generation leaders and those from Generation X.” But as our conversations became more animated and intense, we dropped the polite terms and opted for a more convenient, if less flattering, shorthand. We began referring to our two groups as geeks and geezers.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nTable 1-1 Geezers and Geeks Interviewed in the Project Geezers Warren G.

The geeks whose leadership fascinated us are young (35 and under); most of them are involved in the now troubled but still vital New Economy. In deciding upon our geeks, we looked for outstanding achievement at a notably early age, combined with a thoughtful ability to articulate their experiences, observations, and views. We consciously sought out men and women who had led or even built organizations—having a good idea or a “killer app” alone would not qualify someone for inclusion if they did not also prove themselves capable of leading people. The geeks in our study are a varied lot. They are the heads of dot-coms and other information-based organizations, including Sky Dayton, founder of Earthlink and Boingo Wireless; chocolatier\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 7 Dan Cunningham; and digital iconoclast Ian Clarke, founder of FreeNet. They are accomplished executives in more conventional businesses, like Elizabeth Kao at Ford Motor Company and Elizabeth Altman at Motorola. A few started organizations in order to serve causes dear to them, such as Tara Church, who was an 8-year-old Brownie when she founded the environmental group Tree Musketeers, and Lorig Charkoudian, who founded Baltimore Community Mediation, which helps community members resolve disputes nonviolently. Whether or not they work in the technology sector, they are geeks in the sense of “computer geeks”— young people who have been working with digital technology for as long as they can remember. Theirs is the first cohort to have had computers in elementary school. People with 1s and 0s in their blood, they interact with machines as easily as with other human beings—more easily, critics say. The leaders we termed geezers are the grandparents of our geeks. That’s literally true in the case of Bob Galvin, vice chairman of Motorola, who is the grandfather of Brian Sullivan, CEO of Rolling Oaks Enterprises. These geezer men and women (far more of the former than the latter, sad to say) are widely admired for their wisdom and skill. Some are retired, but most continue to lead major corporations and other successful organizations. Reduced to what National Public Radio’s David Brancaccio calls “the numbers,” our geezers are all 70 and over. When selecting geezers, we were especially interested in people who may have changed arenas but continue to be involved in important work and engaged with the world. The geezers who fascinate us are people like Mel Brooks, who, at 75, launched a new career for himself as a songwriter and won twelve Tonys—the all-time record—for the Broadway show he helped create from his manic film classic The Producers. You need only to have seen Brooks giddily accept Tony after Tony during the 2001 telecast of the theatrical awards show to realize that creativity and vitality are functions of factors other than age. Indeed, his strategy for dealing with his age is to ignore it: “I don’t look in the mirror and I don’t look in the calendar,” he has said. Thus, we were intrigued by leaders like Frank\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n8\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nGehry, designer of the most talked-about building of recent times—the gleaming, undulating Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. He turned 70 in 2000 and yet continues to play the ice hockey he has loved since he was a boy in Toronto. Other geezers include Visa International founder Dee Hock, former Securities and Exchange Commission head Arthur Levitt, Jr., former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan (who once played ice hockey against Gehry), Wall Street pioneer Muriel Siebert, CBS News editor and correspondent Mike Wallace, and UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.\n\nRecording Leadership in Images and Stories We wanted our leaders to share their experiences because we know the power of stories and their ability to convey complex, nuanced information. We wanted the leaders to tell us, in their own words, the aspirations, drives, and events that shaped them, the lessons they learned, and the insights they gained. At the same time, we wanted to collect data systematically so we could see what patterns emerged when that data was analyzed. In order to collect information that could be collated and compared, we asked each person the same set of questions, but we also gave them the opportunity to make any observations they deemed relevant. We decided to videotape the interviews whenever possible, because we knew taping would preserve a wealth of information that no transcript could capture, from body language to subtle shifts in emphasis and energy. Watching the tapes later did indeed remind us of the catch in a voice that marked some unforgettable event, the brio with which they talked about their work, the visible anguish that some showed as they remembered instances of tragedy and loss, the tenderness with which mentors were recalled. We reasoned that this mixed-media approach would give us the best of both worlds— empirical data that would allow us to draw valid conclusions and\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 9 an invaluable archive of images and stories of leadership that would long linger in the reader’s, and the viewer’s, mind.2 After several refinements and considerable tweaking, the questionnaire we administered asked such key questions as: What were the defining moments in your life? How did you get from here to there? How do you define success? How did you define it at 30? What makes you happy? What role has failure played in your life? Remember that the questionnaire (appendix B) was only a starting point, albeit a critical one. Some of the most telling information emerged late in these interviews of two hours or more, after the subjects, assuming the interviews were essentially over, had forgotten the video camera and relaxed. The resulting 43 interviews with leaders ranging in age from 21 to 93 are powerful in their insight and candor. As we asked our subjects to think deeply about their lives, we realized that we were really writing collaborative autobiographies. We were asking them to reveal how they saw themselves, to share the lives they had both lived in reality and constructed in their own minds. In a sense, we were asking them to tell us who they believed themselves to be. Insights from the interviews will form the core of the next two chapters. Chapter 2 elaborates our arguments about the importance of era and values in shaping leaders while focusing on the formative period for our geezers, 1945–1954. We turn to the geeks in chapter 3 and learn what leadership, success, and fulfillment look like to those who came of age in the years 1991–2000. Although Bennis and Biederman have proclaimed the death of the Great Man (and Woman) in Organizing Genius: The Secrets of Creative Collaboration and elsewhere, this project literally focused the camera on the person at the top and gave only fleeting acknowledgment to the network of people who make any complex organization or enterprise a success.3 We made a deliberate decision to emphasize the leader rather than his or her inevitable partner, the group, because we had so much that is new and important to say about leaders. However, it is still true that “None of us is as smart as all of us” and that one is usually too small a\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n10\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nnumber for greatness. In virtually every case, our leaders, both young and old, are successes because of their ability to identify, sustain, and inspire other talented people. Our goal in structuring this book is to convey the excitement we experienced as we listened to our geeks and geezers and began to formulate our underlying model of leadership development (see figure 1-1). In the brief sections that follow we post a road map of the main elements of that model and how they emerged, beginning with the impact of era on leadership aspirations and behaviors, exploring the power of crucible experiences in shaping leadership values and character, and closing with an introduction to the distinctive capacities of men and women who lead for a lifetime.\n\nAM FL Y\n\nThe Impact of Era\n\nTE\n\nEra is an aspect of leadership that has not received the attention it deserves, given how profoundly it shapes individual leaders. We see era as important, not because it defines individuals, but because it presents them with a shared history and culture and a specific arena in which to act. As Oliver Wendell Holmes observed: “A great man represents a strategic point in the campaign of history, and part of his greatness consists of his being there.” Eras are quite different from generations, those periods that occur every eighteen years or so and define all who fall within them. The eras we are talking about are characterized by defining events, and may occur every twenty years or less. Members of the same generation may react quite differently to the opportunities and challenges each new era creates. Certainly the era in which we grew into maturity remains an important force throughout our lives. But in the course of a long life, we experience many eras. The last twenty years, marked by the advent of the Internet and the end of the Cold War, can be seen as one coherent era. It is not yet clear whether the terrorist attacks of 2001 marked the end of that era of American hegemony and unprecedented prosperity. Analog is the umbrella word that best describes the era that\n\nTeam-Fly®\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime\n\n11\n\nproduced our older leaders, digital the term that characterizes the era of our younger leaders (see table 1-2). Many of the older subjects mastered such analog tools as the slide rule, an object as foreign to most of our geeks as a record album or a typewriter. An in-depth analysis of the pervasive impact of digital technology is beyond the scope of this book. But it is obvious that the computer and the Internet have had a profound effect on those who grew up with them (as well as on those who didn’t), from shrinking the size of their mental globe (almost anyone on the planet is only a keystroke away) to providing instant access to information that may or may not be accurate. One of the geeks we interviewed, Ian Clarke, is so much a child of the digital age that he says he can’t imagine what he would have become without the Internet — perhaps, he says with a shudder, “an accountant and miserable.” What are some relevant characteristics of the world in which our older leaders were formed? How is the world different today? The analog world was one that valued linear narrative and thinking. It believed in organizational hierarchy and chain of command. The digital world is nonlinear and has ditched the corporate pyramid for the flat organization. To use psychologist Karl Weick’s insightful metaphors, the world born during the Depression and World War II could be understood using a map. To make sense of\n\nTable 1-2 Era-Based Differences Analog\n\nDigital\n\nLinear Maps Mechanics COP (command, order, predict) Experience Conventional warfare Specialist\n\nNonlinear Compasses Living systems ACE (align, create, empower) Beginner’s mind Terrorism and cyberwarfare Deep generalist\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n12\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nthe Wild West of the digital world requires a compass. As Weick explains: “Maps, by definition, can help only in known worlds— worlds that have been charted before. Compasses are helpful when you are not sure where you are and can get only a general sense of direction.”4 Whether or not their parents owned TV sets, geeks are children of television. The widespread introduction of television in the early 1950s was a watershed in leadership as in so many other things, from family life to the arts. The people born and raised after that world-changing event are forever marked by their ease in processing a tsunami of visual information at breakneck speed. Today’s ordinary American is exposed to more novel visual images in a single day than the average Victorian experienced in a lifetime. You need only look at how differently the generations learned fundamentals. As children, geeks didn’t learn the alphabet in a measured singsong, as did virtually everybody over 50. They shouted it out, one letter chasing another, as they learned to do on Sesame Street. They never slogged through grammar lessons of heartbreaking tedium. Instead, “Conjunction Junction” and the other upbeat lessons of Schoolhouse Rock were set to jazz riffs, tunes still sung aloud on social occasions in Silicon Valley and other capitals of the New Economy. Even the controlling metaphors of the two eras differ. Older leaders were trained to think of the world in Newtonian, mechanical terms. Younger ones tend to look at the world in terms of living organisms and biological systems that are constantly changing and evolving. Men and women over 70 experienced—and understood—conventional warfare, as horrible as it is. Men and women under the age of 30 know only the random nightmare of terrorism and the ever-present threat of biological and cyberwarfare. Experience was valued by an earlier era—implicit in the idea of seniority is the notion that valuable lessons are learned only over time. Fifty years ago, the leader was expected to have survived a period of testing and was thought to be the better for it. Winston Churchill expressed this attitude when he said: “I rate the capacity of man by, first, courage and ability; and second, real experience\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 13 under fire.” Today’s society tends to value what Zen Buddhists call the “beginner’s mind.” It implies fresh insight unfettered by experience. In this more contemporary view, the compelling idea is the novel one at an angle to conventional wisdom, itself a phrase that implies a regressive reliance on the status quo. Perhaps no one articulated the nature of the beginner’s mind better than the composer Berlioz when he said of Saint-Saëns: “He knows everything. All he lacks is inexperience.” Yesterday’s leaders were specialists who sought and trusted answers. Today’s tend to be generalists who know they need to ask the right questions. What are the implications of era for the way our geeks and geezers think about the leader’s role? We found three key differences between geeks and geezers when we compared their hopes and aspirations at the same age (roughly 25–30). First, geeks have bigger and more ambitious goals than geezers did at the same age; they aspire to “change the world” and “make history,” whereas geezers were concerned with “making a living.” Second, geeks place far more emphasis on achieving balance in their work, family, and personal lives than did geezers at a comparable age. And third, geeks are far less likely than geezers to have heroes or to have had their image of a successful leader shaped by a hero. No issue or attitude divided the two groups more dramatically than that of the drive among geeks for work-life balance, which we will explore in much greater detail in chapter 3. Taken as a whole, these differences, we suggest, are directly linked to the eras in which each group matured as leaders. We also uncovered convergences in worldview among these older and younger leaders. For example, both groups are avid learners: They are captivated by learning new things and are constantly on the lookout for ways to enhance their ability to learn. These geeks and geezers are also alike in that they forever strain to transcend limits, whether those limits are individual, like strength or learning ability, or institutional, like racial and/or sexual discrimination. However, the most dramatic tie connecting the men and women we interviewed was their common experience of events that transformed their behavior and self-understanding. The discovery of\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n14\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nthis common tie propelled us from a simple, albeit very interesting, comparison of geeks and geezers to a much deeper investigation of how people become leaders.\n\nThe Power of the Crucible We found that every leader in our study, young or old, had undergone at least one intense, transformational experience. That transformational experience was at the very heart of becoming a leader. The descriptive term we found ourselves using is crucible. The American Heritage Dictionary defines crucible as “a place, time or situation characterized by the confluence of powerful intellectual, social, economic or political forces; a severe test of patience or belief; a vessel for melting material at high temperatures.” A crucible was the vessel in which medieval alchemists attempted to turn base metals into gold. That the alchemists inevitably failed in their audacious attempts doesn’t negate the power of the crucible as a metaphor for the circumstances that cause an individual to be utterly transformed. Because crucibles are so critical, we will devote all of chapter 4 to them. As the event or relationship that forged a leader, the crucible is at the center of our model (see figure 1-1). The crucibles that produced our leaders were as varied as being mentored, mastering a martial art, climbing a mountain, and losing an election. Sometimes the crucible was an upbeat, even joyous experience. Video game expert Geoff Keighley, 21, remembers his whole life changing in second grade, when he made a magician’s table out of a microwave box, put on a top hat, and performed a dazzling magic trick at a friend’s birthday party. “It set me apart,” said Keighley, remembering how the wonder and respect of his young audience filled him with a sense of power and uniqueness. Sometimes the crucible is a tragedy. Pioneering television journalist Mike Wallace was uncertain whether he should give up his prestigious, well-paying job with a local station and try for a network slot when, in 1962, his oldest son, Peter, a student at Yale, fell\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 15 off a mountain while on vacation in Greece. Two weeks after Peter disappeared, Wallace found the boy’s body. “That was really the turning point when I said, ‘To hell with it,’ ” Wallace recalled. “I’m going to quit everything and do what I want to do now.” One of the harshest crucibles in our study was that which shaped businessman Sidney Rittenberg, 79. In China in 1949 Rittenberg was jailed as a spy by former friends in Chairman Mao’s government. He spent sixteen years in prison, the first year in solitary confinement and total darkness except when he was being interrogated and the remaining fifteen years in permanent lighting without the benefit of darkness. He emerged certain that absolutely nothing in professional life could break him. The crucible need not be a horrendous ordeal. Motorola vice president Liz Altman, 34, didn’t go to prison. But she was utterly transformed by the year she spent in a Sony factory in Japan, finding her way in an alien corporate world whose broad cultural differences—particularly its emphasis on groups over individuals— were both a shock and a challenge to a young American woman. Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, was shaped by the Wall Street of the 1950s and ’60s, an arena so sexist that she couldn’t get a job as a stockbroker until she took her first name off her resume and substituted a genderless initial. Thrust into the alpha-male world of Wall Street, Siebert wasn’t broken or defeated. Instead, she emerged stronger, more focused, and determined to change the status quo that excluded her. World War II was a crucible for almost all our older male leaders, many of whom were transformed by the terrible responsibility of leading other men into battle. The war was also a crucible for many in that it allowed them to recognize for the first time that they had the ability and desire to lead. Common Cause founder John Gardner, 89, identified his arduous training as a Marine as the crucible in which his leadership abilities emerged. “Some qualities were there waiting for life to pull those things out of me,” he told us, with characteristic eloquence. The battlefield and basic training are recognized rites of passage after which people\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n16\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nare different; their values and the way they see the world are forever changed. The quality of that change is captured in the observation by many Vietnam veterans that the war was in Technicolor, but everything before and after was in black and white. Mentor-protégé relationships constitute another, very powerful, kind of crucible. The importance of mentoring has become almost a cliché of management literature, but, as we will show in chapter 4, mentoring shares with other crucibles a powerful process of learning, adaptation, and transformation that is intensely individual, whether it occurs in a family or an organization. Consider, for example, Michael Klein, a young man who made millions in Southern California real estate while still in his teens. As Klein told us, his mentor was his grandfather, Max S. Klein, who created the paint-by-numbers fad that swept the United States in the 1950s and ’60s.5 Klein recalled that he was only 4 or 5 years old when his grandfather approached him and offered to share his expertise in business. The grandfather noted that Michael’s father and aunt —Max’s only children—had no interest in business and told young Michael, “You’re never going to get any money from me . . . but I’ll tell you anything you want to know and teach you anything that you want to learn from me.” We learn from stories like Klein’s that teaching is never solely the function of the mentor. The protégé can also be a teacher, a guide to the mindset and skills of a younger generation that allows the mentor to continue learning and to cope more successfully with inexorable change. Whether the crucible experience is an apprenticeship, an ordeal, or some combination of both, we came to think of it much like the hero’s journey that lies at the heart of every myth, from The Odyssey to Erin Brockovich. It is both an opportunity and a test. It is a defining moment that unleashes abilities, forces crucial choices, and sharpens focus. It teaches a person who he or she is. People can be destroyed by such an experience. But those who are not emerge from it aware of their gifts and goals, ready to seize opportunities and make their future. Whether the crucible was harrowing or not, it is seen by the individual as the turning point that set him or her on the desired, even inevitable, course.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 17\n\nCreating Meaning Out of the Crucible Experience Leaders create meaning out of events and relationships that devastate nonleaders. Even when battered by experience, leaders do not see themselves as helpless or find themselves paralyzed. They look at the same events that unstring those less capable and fortunate and see something useful, and often a plan of action as well. A powerful example is that of Vernon E. Jordan, civil rights pioneer and presidential advisor. In his 2001 memoir Vernon Can Read!, Jordan describes the vicious baiting he received as a young man from his employer, Robert F. Maddox.6 Jordan served the racist former mayor of Atlanta at dinner, in a white jacket, with a napkin over his arm. He also functioned as Maddox’s chauffeur. Whenever Maddox could, he would derisively announce, “Vernon can read!” as if the literacy of a young African American were a source of wonderment. So abused, a lesser man might have allowed Maddox to destroy him. But Jordan wrote his own interpretation of Maddox’s sadistic heckling, a tale that empowered Jordan instead of embittering him. When he looked at Maddox through the rear-view mirror, Jordan did not see a powerful member of Georgia’s ruling class. He saw a desperate anachronism who lashed out because he knew his time was up. As Jordan writes: “I do not mean just his physical time on earth—but I believed that the ‘time’ that helped shape him was on its way out. His half-mocking, half-serious comments about my education were the death rattle of his culture. When he saw that I was in the process of crafting a life for myself that would make me a man in some of the same ways he thought of being a man, he was deeply unnerved.”7 The home in which Jordan was a servant was the crucible in which, consciously or not, Jordan imbued Maddox’s cruelty with redemptive meaning. And thus are leaders made. Nelson Mandela used his powerful character and imagination to thwart his jailers’ attempts to dehumanize him. “If I had not been in prison,” he told Oprah Winfrey in an interview in 2001, “I would not have been able to achieve the most difficult task in\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n18\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nlife, and that is changing yourself.” Notice how Mandela made lemonade from the most bitter of lemons. He saw himself not as a passive victim—someone who was imprisoned by others—but as an individual who had been “in prison.” Instead of allowing his jailers to define him, Mandela fashioned a heroic identity for himself—one that inspired millions in Africa and elsewhere and was instrumental in ending apartheid and creating a new, multicultural South Africa. For Mandela, the crucible was both an external reality and something he created in the process of imbuing it with meaning. Much of the leadership literature focuses on the traits or habits of leaders. In fact, every individual has a unique set of obstacles as well as assets that he or she brings to the table. Whether the bar is poverty, insecurity based on some physical attribute (Mike Wallace’s teenage acne), or ethnic or racial discrimination (architect Frank Gehry was so troubled by widespread anti-Semitism that he changed the family name from Goldberg shortly before his first child was born), everybody enters the lists with a burden, a perceived reason for not succeeding. Ford Motor Company executive (and geek) Elizabeth Kao expressed the concept well when she said: “Everybody has their own wall to climb.” One of the key differences between leaders and nonleaders, we found, is the ability of leaders to transmogrify even the negatives in their lives into something that serves them. For leaders, the uses of adversity are genuinely sweet.\n\nWhat Makes a Leader An important part of our leadership model is what lies on the other side of the crucible—the qualities that define lifetime leaders and learners, qualities that we will discuss at length in chapters 4 and 5. The one key asset all our leaders share, whether young or old, is their adaptive capacity. The ability to process new experiences, to find their meaning and to integrate them into one’s life, is the signature skill of leaders and, indeed, of anyone who finds ways\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 19 to live fully and well. Of all our subjects, none showed greater adaptive capacity than Sidney Rittenberg. Thrown into a Chinese jail, confined in a pitch-dark cell without any explanation, Rittenberg did not rail or panic. You wonder what you would do in such dreadful circumstances, if you would be able to come out whole. Within minutes, Rittenberg recalled matter-of-factly, a stanza of verse popped into his mind, four lines read to him as a little boy: They drew a circle that shut me out, Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took them in.8\n\nThat bit of verse (adapted from “Outwitted” by Edwin Markham) was the key to Rittenberg’s survival. “My God,” he thought to himself, “there’s my strategy. There’s my program.” Evidence of the power of Rittenberg’s ability to adapt and survive is Rittenberg Associates, the consulting firm that he founded and continues to run, which helps American companies do business with the Chinese. As his example so vividly reminds us, bitterness is maladaptive. Optimism is an element of what health psychologists term hardiness, a rubric for the cluster of qualities that equip people for serial success (see chapter 5 for a fuller discussion of these qualities). Tenacity and self-confidence are others. But leaders share less obvious assets as well. As Saul Bellow says of the character very like himself in his novel Ravelstein, they are all “firstclass noticers.” Being a first-class noticer allows you to recognize talent, identify opportunities, and avoid pitfalls. Leaders who succeed again and again are geniuses at grasping context. This is one of those characteristics, like taste, that is difficult to break down into its component parts. But the ability to weigh a welter of factors, some as subtle as how very different groups of people will interpret a gesture, is one of the hallmarks of a true leader. One of the best ways to define good leadership is to study bad leaders. Although we explore this approach at length in chapter 5, a single instance is instructive here: Shakespeare’s tragic Roman\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n20\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nTE\n\nAM FL Y\n\ngeneral Coriolanus. A great warrior, a man with a strong moral compass, Coriolanus has only one flaw—his utter inability to reach out to the people of Rome and engage them in his vision. Rereading the play in the context of leadership, we couldn’t help thinking of Coriolanus’s mother, Volumnia, as the ancient Roman equivalent of an executive coach saddled with a particularly thickheaded client. Talk to the people, she encourages her son again and again. But Coriolanus doesn’t get it. He fails to grasp the expectations of the people or how they will respond to his aloofness. He is convinced that reaching out to the populace would be a form of pandering, that it would require him to sacrifice his integrity. Finally, before we conclude this overview of our leadership model, we need to say something more about one of the most exciting ideas to emerge from our research. We discovered that every one of our geezers who continues to play a leadership role has one quality of overriding importance: neoteny. The dictionary defines neoteny, a zoological term, as “the retention of youthful qualities by adults.” Neoteny is more than retaining a youthful appearance, although that is often part of it. Neoteny is the retention of all those wonderful qualities that we associate with youth: curiosity, playfulness, eagerness, fearlessness, warmth, energy. Unlike those defeated by time and age, our geezers have remained much like our geeks—open, willing to take risks, hungry for knowledge and experience, courageous, eager to see what the new day brings. Time and loss steal the zest from the unlucky, and leave them looking longingly at the past. Neoteny is a metaphor for the quality—the gift —that keeps the fortunate of whatever age focused on all the marvelous undiscovered things to come. Frank Gehry designs buildings that make architects half his age gasp with envy. Neoteny is what makes him lace up his skates and whirl around the ice rink, while visionary buildings come to life and dance inside his head. Walt Disney, of all people, did a good job of describing his own neoteny. “People who have worked with me say I am ‘innocence in action,’ ” he wrote. “They say I have the innocence and\n\nTeam-Fly®\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nLeading and Learning for a Lifetime 21 unselfconsciousness of a child. Maybe I have. I still look at the world with uncontaminated wonder.” 9 The capacity for “uncontaminated wonder,” ultimately, is what distinguishes the successful from the ordinary, the happily engaged players of whatever era from the chronically disappointed and malcontent. Therein lies a lesson for geeks, geezers, and the sea of people who fall in between. In the next two chapters we’ll see how two profoundly different eras influenced the motivations, values, and aspirations of these men and women.\n\nBennis 001-022 c1 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:14 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 23\n\n\n\nGeezers The Era of Limits\n\nW\n\nhat difference does it make in the life and mind of a leader to have been born in 1925 versus 1975? How is it different being bright, ambitious, and 25 in 1950 versus the year 2000? We are not social historians, so we don’t intend to rerender history in a novel or comprehensive way. We seek instead to offer a series of snapshots that capture the zeitgeist, or spirit of the times, of the formative years of each group. Then we will show how the two groups actually lived and learned in this broader, yet defining, context. To accomplish this, we first look at each group’s coming-ofage years: 1945–1954 for the geezers, and 1991–2000 for the geeks. In this chapter, we explore the milieu in which geezers stretched their wings as young adults and as leaders. We refer to this time as the Era of Limits. Chapter 3 provides a parallel look at geeks during what we label the Era of Options.\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n24\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nThe Era of Limits: 1945–1954 Victory in World War II inspired careful optimism in Americans, but this momentary elation was tainted by the revelation of Nazi death camps and by the awful responsibility of owning the nuclear bomb. The nation grew tense as the “hot” war in Europe and the Pacific gave way to an ideological Cold War between democratic and communist states. In the summer of 1950, North Korean Communist armies, sponsored by China and the Soviet Union, marched into South Korea. President Harry S. Truman captured the tenor of the nation in this diary entry: “It looks like World War III is here—but we must meet whatever comes, and we will.”1 The U.S. rapidly cemented its role as a global superpower, not only through the “police action” to contain communism in Korea, but also through the rebuilding of Europe under the Marshall Plan and the extended occupation of Japan (1945–1952). Like a child who suddenly gets his wish, America struggled throughout the era to understand and define its role on the world stage. Postwar youth had to live with the psychic repercussions of World War II for the rest of their lives. In August 1946, John Hersey’s short novel Hiroshima filled an entire issue of the New Yorker magazine, and it later became a national best-seller. Describing the human cost of a nuclear blast through the eyes of a few ordinary people, the novel awakened many Americans to the real dangers of the dawning nuclear age. In 1948, Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead revisited the tragedy of war in all its gritty detail. While they would not soon forget the lessons of the war, young Americans were anxious to mend their psychic and bodily wounds. They remembered their parents’ struggles during the Depression years of their childhood, yet they found jobs in a booming economy, bought suburban houses, and filled newly built schools with their children. Former GIs and their families were poised to inherit the earth—but the earth was trembling beneath their feet. Even in a time that Life magazine calls “the most bountiful period in U.S.\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nGeezers\n\n25\n\nhistory,” suburbanites installed backyard bomb shelters.2 Indeed, fear of communism “in our own backyards” grew into a national obsession. In 1947 a group of Hollywood screenwriters were interrogated, jailed for a year, and blacklisted. A few years later, the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage riveted the attention of the nation and much of the world. Pope Pius XII advised clemency, and French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the execution “a legal lynching that cover[s] a whole nation in blood.”3 The freedom for which young Americans fought seemed threatened from all sides. During this time the GI Bill inundated universities with students who had suffered the horrors of war. Young people bought suburban homes and enjoyed a material comfort unknown to their Depression-era parents. The Kinsey Reports on human sexuality alternately scandalized and titillated the nation. A young writer named Jack Kerouac was literally on the road, taking notes on experiences that would galvanize the Beat movement a few years later; schoolchildren listened to Bert, an amiable animated turtle, who sang “Duck and Cover” to instruct them in the event of nuclear catastrophe. Consider it a time of stability with limitations: The promise of abundance and progress was shadowed by the fear of nuclear destruction or another stock market disaster.\n\nBig Business and the Organization Man Big business flourished in the decade following World War II, and the companies that anticipated the transition to a postwar economy did best of all. Legions of veterans and their young families moved west across the country in search of the good jobs in the burgeoning aerospace sector, or north to new jobs offered by industrial expansion. When one of us (Warren) first began teaching at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, every student was a married white male in his mid-thirties. The only “minority” students were Canadian, and almost no students were from small\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n26\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nentrepreneurial companies. Instead, seats in business schools like Sloan were filled by men from corporate behemoths. These behemoths—including automakers General Motors and Ford, consumer durables manufacturers like General Electric and Westinghouse, and the beneficiaries of the Cold War arms race, such as Lockheed and General Dynamics—grew at breakneck speed to capture dominant positions in their markets. Vertical integration was the principle strategy as these enormous firms sought to protect their core assets from potentially crippling disruptions in supply. Business leaders invested tremendous faith in science and technology. After all, advances in nuclear technology, radar, and sonar research contributed to victory in World War II. After the war, the sciences continued to blossom: Medical researchers developed synthetic antibiotics, chemists created plastics and pesticides, and nuclear physicists made progress toward harnessing nuclear energy. Through technology, an already prosperous America was catapulted to global economic dominance. With the postwar resurgence in labor unions in key sectors of the economy, big business meant good jobs with good benefits. Indeed, thanks to the UAW’s success in collective bargaining in this era, the very concept of employment benefits was born: In many industries, workers availed themselves of health insurance, pensions, and paid vacations for the first time. Union leaders were respected for gaining these significant advances in the quality of life for employees. One of the most important implications of the growth of the large-scale business enterprise was the emergence of the “Organization Man” about whom William H. Whyte wrote so incisively in 1956: They are not the workers, nor are they the white-collar people in the usual, clerk sense of the word. These people only work for The Organization. . . . They are the ones of our middle class who have left home, spiritually as well as physically, to take the vows of organization life, and it is they who are the mind and soul of our great self-perpetuating institutions.4\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nGeezers\n\n27\n\nCareers in the era of the Organization Man were imbued with the idea of reciprocal loyalty: of employee to organization and boss and of organization to employee. Hardly paternalistic, big business operated on the basis of engineering models of problem solving and rational calculation, while rewarding commitment and hard work. In many respects, the notion of career was inextricably intertwined with the military experience of chain-of-command and standard operating procedures: Follow the rules and obey authority, and things will work well. When things work well, everyone benefits. In this regime, experience was valued because it implied knowledge. Equally important, however, it demonstrated acceptance of the legitimacy of the rules of the game. There was at root a social contract that tied employer and employee together. The employee, to a certain extent, gave up his individuality for the “brotherhood” of the organization. In reciprocity, the organization guaranteed the employee the “good life” through salary and security.\n\nRacing to the Middle Demographically and economically, the United States was becoming a middle-class society in this era. Even as economic inequality persisted and racial discrimination in the north began to draw attention, the American Dream took on the flavor of its middle class. America was under the thrall of television; it shaped the way people used their leisure time, got their news, and made sense of the world. Even in its infancy, TV shaped white suburbia’s selfimage and spotlighted the ideal nuclear family. Whatever the social realities of the time, television consistently portrayed men as breadwinners and women as homemakers. The media acknowledged only heterosexual couples (despite the Kinsey Report’s revelations about homosexuality), and gender and race severely limited the future choices of little boys and girls. Of course, reality did not conform to the antiseptic surfaces of television: The roots of feminism and civil rights were spreading underground throughout the fifties. In 1950, a young man named Martin Luther King,\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n28\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nJr., was reading Ghandi, and in 1955 Eleanor Roosevelt published an article entitled “What Are the Motives for a Woman Working When She Does Not Have to for Income?” Her answer in the article—self-fulfillment —did not fit the typical female stereotype for women in the fifties.5 Regardless of these undercurrents of resistance, advertisements for cars, appliances, furniture, and cigarettes featured wellgroomed young couples frolicking with their children. Foreshadowing the era of the geeks, advertising began to rival the power of political ideology. How powerful was the entertainment/advertising conglomerate? When Lucille Ball admitted to a journalist in 1953 that she once joined the Communist Party to please her grandfather, her sponsor, Philip Morris, refused to withdraw support from the enormously popular I Love Lucy show. America was so enamored of Lucy’s ditsy housewife that she was quickly forgiven when Desi Arnaz quipped that the only thing red about Lucy was her hair—and even that was dyed.6 Organized religion dominated the moral landscape of postwar America. Though it’s impossible to say precisely that Americans of this era were more or less religious than in the era of the geeks, they were certainly more institutional in their worship.7 Churches sprouted with every new suburban development. The dominant ideology of Christianity encompassed moral life on a national level. The struggle against communism was a biblical battle between good and evil in the minds of most Americans, who were convinced that God was on the side of democracy. In 1950, a former communist “convert” wrote: Communism is not new. It is, in fact, man’s second oldest faith. Its promise was whispered in the first days of creation under the tree of Good and Evil: “Ye shall be as gods.” Other ages have had great visions. They have always been different versions of the same vision: the vision of God and man’s relationship to God. The communist vision is the vision of man without God.8\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nGeezers\n\n29\n\nAmericans trusted public institutions, perhaps because of the sacrifices they’d made to preserve them, but also because so many of them had benefited from public works programs as children in the 1930s. The United States, in a very short time, geared up to win a war. Shortly after accomplishing that mission, 2.25 million men and women took advantage of the GI Bill from 1945 to 1954. American leaders wisely created the Marshall Plan and did not dethrone the emperor of Japan. People complained about the government and taxes, but even the conservatives who rewrote New Deal legislation never expressed open contempt for the institutions of government. White, middle-class America favored the new buildings, bright classrooms, and large patches of open space for children to play at suburban public schools. The contrast between the suburbs and cities grew stark as the middle class moved to new developments and bought cars, abandoning public transportation and city schools. With Social Security, the Wagner Act, and the desegregation of the armed forces, the U.S. government set out to redress conditions for the weak and oppressed. There were real icons in this era, people whom the editors of Time magazine called “All purpose heroes . . . who are right and true all the time.”9 Sports heroes like Joe DiMaggio and Stan Musial represented the ideal of American manhood. A handful of movie and television actors, including Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne (both of whom had served in the military), and Lucille Ball, were universally beloved. Political and ideological icons like Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Douglas MacArthur were more than celebrities; they commanded respect from wide swaths of the population.\n\nA Bridge across Eras A core hypothesis of this book is that the era into which we are born has a profound impact on our lives, although we are rarely aware of it day to day. The films that speak to a particular generation\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n30\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nTE\n\nAM FL Y\n\nare especially telling—reminders of a shared past in which every detail, from clothing styles to common values, reflects a shared identity. What geezer is not moved by Fred Zinnemann’s cinematic adaptation of James Jones’s tale of America on the brink of war, From Here to Eternity? Why do such culturally hip contemporary films as High Fidelity, Stephen Frear’s portrait of the socially inept and musically obsessed, resonate so strongly with geeks? Each of these films is dense with cultural information fully understood only by people who have been there, done that. But such films also function as windows on eras other than our own, allowing us to bridge—if only for ninety minutes, with a box of popcorn in hand—what Phil Slater calls the “experiential chasms that so often keep generations apart.”10 One very big consideration shaped our thinking: Any comparison involving attitudes or experiences would have to be “apples and apples,” that is, between men and women at the same stages of their lives. To that end, we asked the same questions about each individual’s aspirations, worries, and relationships at similar points in their lives. For example, when we asked our subjects to identify “defining moments” in their leadership journey, people often proceeded chronologically, anchoring them in the time (and age) when a defining moment occurred. When geezers identified such a moment between the ages of 25 and 30, we probed with questions that served as the foundation for our comparison. This tactic enabled us to compare and contrast two groups of young people, thus bridging the formative eras for geeks and geezers. Although we will take up an explicit comparison of the effects of era on each group’s aspirations and motivations as leaders in the concluding section of chapter 3, it helps to peek at a few features of the demography of each era to heighten the contrast (see table 2-1).\n\nGeezers at Age 25–30 What were the men and women we interviewed over the age of 70 thinking about when they were 25–30 years old?

The game featured a road from high school to retirement, complete with shortcuts and detours, thoroughfares and dead ends. Advertising copy for the game advised players: “Land a great job, get married, and fill up your car with kids! Dodge bad luck and make a buck. End up with the biggest fortune, and you’ll retire in style as a winner!”\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n32\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 32\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nFigure 2-1 Key Themes in the Geezer Interviews GEEZERS Great Depression\n\nNeeds/Wants\n\nCharacter\n\n• Growing up worried • Parental fallibility\n\n• Stability/security • Control over my space (mine, not someone else’s) • Hard work will lead to just rewards\n\n• Making a living • Command-and-control leadership style • Entrepreneuring as a way to control one’s own space/destiny\n\nWWII • Dislocation from family and community • Greater awareness of U.S. diversity and hypocrisy • Experience of mortality, personal loss • Military service • “Free World” hangs in balance\n\nMaturation Process • Learning to organize • Regard for subordinates (though sometimes paternalistic) • Patriotism, love of country, defense of American values\n\nIn what we’ve identified as the Era of Limits, geezers were living the Game of Life. Like the game, life contained elements of chance. You couldn’t predict how far you might go in a career or how successful your marriage and family life might turn out to be. But the prospect of a conventional career and a conventional family was largely taken for granted. You could anticipate one career trajectory—in one field with one or perhaps two companies— much as there was only one path to success in the board game. The rules for success were pretty clear: work hard, produce results, and you’ll get promoted and receive a pension (presumably supplemented by Social Security) to underwrite your retirement. Provide for your family and set a good example for your kids, and you’ll complete the game happily. Sloan Wilson’s 1956 portrayal of the white-collar world in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 33\n\nGeezers\n\n33\n\nmirrored Alfred P. Sloan’s definition of the modern business executive: “Master and servant of the large-scale corporation.” The notion of “one life” (or one chance at the game) that dominated geezers’ thinking at age 25–30 was directly influenced by their own experiences as well as those of their parents in the wake of the Great Depression, and by their own search for stability following the upheaval of World War II.11 As children of the Depression, most of them grew up worried. They knew their parents were fallible because they had seen them broken by the loss of homes and jobs. As a result, they began adulthood seeking a certain financial security above all else. An apt case in point is Sidney Harman, now 82 and the chairman of the board of the multibillion-dollar audio equipment manufacturer Harman International. In his teens, Harman equated success in life with a steady paycheck: “If someone came along with a lifetime contract to pay me five thousand dollars a year, that would be success. When I was thirty, it was making money. Success then was running the . . . business and running it well and being recognized for the fact that I was doing it and getting paid. That was success.” Mike Wallace, 82, of CBS News and co-creator of the pathbreaking program 60 Minutes, defined success at age 21 as: Ten thousand bucks a year. And a certain security. Look, I came from immigrant parents. Both of them came from Russia—my Dad at sixteen, my mother when she was a year and a half, and who were devotees of Franklin Roosevelt. To them he was hope and promise and opportunity. And growing up in those Depression years was a very, very tough time. I worked, you know. I either washed dishes or waited on table at various fraternity houses around the campus. And didn’t get much money from home. Had a National Youth Administration job that paid thirty dollars a month or something like that.\n\nLike Wallace, geezers often use their family of origin as the backdrop against which to locate their aspirations and—without a trace of smugness—to compare their accomplishments. Dee\n\nBennis 023-050 c2 3rd\n\n34\n\n6/16/02\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nGeeks & Geezers\n\nHock, 71-year-old CEO emeritus of Visa International, recounted his upbringing: I am the sixth of six children. Born in a little tiny mountain community in Utah. My parents had an eighth-grade education. We lived in a two-room house. No plumbing, no running water. Maybe had six to seven hundred square feet in it. And it was kind of in the country, farming community at the base of the Wasatch Range of the Rockies. . . . My wife’s the eleventh of twelve children, raised in a little hardscrabble farm, same thing. Father died of cancer in high school. Straight-A student but couldn’t go to college until she was middle-aged.\n\nIn other words, these young people valued what their parents had provided them, but they were also determined to do better for their own children. Warren Bennis identified the day his father came home jobless as an inflection point in his life: When I was about five or six, my father lost his job. And he was totally helpless. He had no recourse. There was no Social Security. There was no pension. And for the next few years it was a real struggle. I mean, he did jobs like loading booze, illicit booze on trucks. He ran summonses for lawyers. He distributed flyers for the Republican Party to earn a buck, or earn a quarter I mean, not a buck. And when he came home and told my mother he’d lost his job, she broke into tears and I felt, ‘I’m never going to let that happen to me. I’m never going to be at the effect of other people who are going to be able to do that to me. I’m not going to be in a position where I will ever, ever, allow myself to be vulnerable to that helplessness.’\n\nMilitary Imprint Service in the military, particula"
