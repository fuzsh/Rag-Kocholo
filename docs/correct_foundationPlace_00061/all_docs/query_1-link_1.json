In 2014, I led developing a customized real-time bidder (i.e. RTB) for sophisticated media buyers such as mobile game companies and ad agencies. We developed a proprietary optimization algorithm for analyzing data to train models for optimal ad buying. As chief data scientist @Trulioo, my team worked in the area of fraud detection where we used machine learning algorithms and processed over 1.5 billion social profiles from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, & LinkedIn. Our predictive models computed authenticity score for people social profile to identify fraudulent accounts. While @SeekerSolutions, my team designed & implemented various NLP models for topic modeling and name entity recognition for free text in medical space.\n\nI'm a web developer with a passion for art, design, coding, and human psychology. I believe that great web design is more than just making something look pretty. It's about creating an experience that is both visually appealing and functionally effective.
