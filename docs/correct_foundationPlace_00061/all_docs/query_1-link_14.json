Mr. Proctor is an accomplished public speaker and was recognized for his expertise by being appointed to the original Telecommunications Infrastructure Protection working group used by Congress to understand critical infrastructure protection issues prior to the terrorist attack of Sept. 11. Previously, he worked for SAIC, Centrax, CyberSafe, Network Flight Recorder and Practical Security.\n\nAn enterprise IT infrastructure is a complex and a dynamic environment that is generally described as a black hole by its IT managers. The knowledge about an enterprise network's layout (topology), resources (availability and usage), elements residing on the network (devices, applications, their properties and the interdependencies among them) as well as the ability to maintain this knowledge up-to-date, are all of critical for managing and securing IT assets and resources.\n\nUnfortunately, the current available network discovery technologies (active network discovery and passive network discovery) suffer from numerous technological weaknesses which prevent them from providing with complete and accurate information about an enterprise IT infrastructure. Their ability to keep track of changes is unsatisfactory at best.\n\nThe inability to \"know\" the network directly results with the inability to manage and secure the network in an appropriate manner. This is since it is impossible to manage or to defend something, or against something, its existence is unknown or that only partial information about it exists.\n\nThe first part of the talk presents the current available network discovery technologies, active network discovery and passive network discovery, and explains their strengths and weaknesses. The talk highlights technological barriers, which cannot be overcome, with open source and commercial applications using these technologies.\n\nThe second part of the talk presents a new hybrid approach for infrastructure discovery, monitoring and control. This agent-less approach provides with real-time, complete, granular and accurate information about an enterprise infrastructure. The underlying technology of the solution enables maintaining the information in real-time, and ensures the availability of accurate, complete and granular network context for other network and security applications.\n\nDuring the talk new technological advancements in the fields of infrastructure discovery, monitoring and auditing will be presented.\n\nAt DefCon 11, a rogue access point setup utility named \"Airsnarf\" was presented by the Shmoo Group. Two years later, \"Evil Twin\" access points have made it to Slashdot and news.google.com. Who would have thought TSG could get away with the easy rogue AP attacks for so long? Note to Shmoo: Next time, put the word \"evil\" in the title of your presentation for mass appeal and acceptance. Oh, rock on--it WORKED!\n\nWireless n00b? No problem0. This talk starts off with the basics. Wireless insecurity basics. Rogue AP basics. How your wireless users are basically screwed. Etc. If you read about \"Evil Twin\" access points earlier this year, you will actually see how easy it is to build your own. However, this talk quickly moves on to more advanced attacks and trickery with rogue APs, including: gathering intel beyond usernames / passwords, getting around WEP and WPA-PSK protected networks, integrating RADIUS with your rogue AP, abusing vulnerable EAPs, rogue AP backend bridging, and real-time abuse of two-factor authentication a la Bruce Schneier's Springtime scary story. Even wireless warriors will learn an entertaining trick or two. You want demonstrations? Okey dokey. You'll have them.\n\nOnce everyone has the willies, the \"professional\" and \"responsible\" portion of this talk, albeit minimal, will cover rogue AP defense. Basic wireless security architectures and to-dos for home users, hotspot users, and enterprise wireless network admins are covered, as well as client-side defensive tools, WIDS considerations, and roll-your-own options.\n\nBut wait! There's more! For the closet Microsoft fanboy in all of us, wireless weapons for Windows are covered--both offense and defense. Why launch a rogue AP attack when you can launch three? Rogue AP attacks for the masses! The release of \"Rogue Squadron\"! It's a bizarre look at how to be a social engineering badboy with 802.11bpresented by Beetle of the Shmoo Group. If you want to know what the press will pick up on two years from now, you should probably check this out. Otherwise, move along. These are not the APs you are looking for.\n\nJoyce Brocaglia is president and chief executive officer of Alta Associates, the premier executive recruitment firm for the information security industry.

She continues to work with BITS, the technology group for The Financial Services Roundtable as a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe ability to check memory references against their associated array/buffer bounds helps programmers to detect programming errors involving address overruns early on and thus avoid many difficult bugs down the line. Because such programming errors have been the targets of remote attacks, i.e., buffer overflow attack, prevention of array bound violation is essential for the security and robustness of application programs that provide service on the Internet.\n\nThis talk proposes a novel approach called CASH to the array bound checking problem that exploits the segmentation feature in the virtual memory hardware of the X86 architecture.\n\nThe CASH approach allocates a separate segment to each static array or dynamically allocated buffer, and generates the instructions for array references in such a way that the segment limit check in X86's virtual memory protection mechanism performs the necessary array bound checking for free. In those cases that hardware bound checking is not possible, it falls back to software bound checking. As a result, CASH does not need to pay per-reference software checking overhead in most cases. However, the CASH approach incurs a fixed set-up overhead for each use of an array, which may involve multiple array references. The existence of this overhead requires compiler writers to judiciously apply the proposed technique to minimize the performance cost of array bound checking.\n\nThis talk will describe the detailed design and implementation of the CASH compiler, and a comprehensive evaluation of various performance tradeoffs associated with the proposed array bound checking technique. For the set of production-grade network applications we tested, including Apache, Sendmail, Bind, etc., the latency penalty of CASH's bound checking mechanism is between 2.5% to 9.8% when compared with the baseline case that does not perform any bound checking.\n\nBryan Cunningham has extensive experience as a cybersecurity and intelligence expert, both in senior U.S. Government posts and the private sector.

Are you tired of receiving e-mails from Citibank that resolve to Muscovite IP addresses? Would you like to hack the Kremlin? Or do you think that the Kremlin has probably owned you first? Maybe you just think that Anna Kournikova is hot. If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then you need an introduction to the Gulag Archipelago of the Internet, the Cyberia of interconnected networks, Russia.\n\nDo not let the persistent challenges of crossing international boundaries intimidate you any longer. In this briefing, we will follow several real-world scenarios back to Russia, and you will learn valuable strategies for taking your investigations and operations one big geographical step further. A brief introduction to Russia will be followed by 1,000 traceroutes over the frozen tundra described in detail, along with an explanation of the relationship between cyber and terrestrial geography. Information will be provided on Russian hacker groups and law enforcement personnel, as well as a personal interview with the top Russian cyber cop, conducted in Russian and translated for this briefing.\n\nQuick: name one significant advantage that Russian hackers have over you. They can read your language, but you cannot read theirs! Since most Westerners cannot read Russian, the secrets of Russian hacking are largely unknown to Westerners. You will receive a short primer on the Russian language, to include network security terminology, software translation tools, and cross-cultural social engineering faux-pas (this method will apply to cracking other foreign languages as well).\n\nHacking in a Foreign Language details a four-step plan for crossing international frontiers in cyberspace. First, you must learn something about the Tribe: in this case, the chess players and the cosmonauts. Second, you must study their cyber Terrain. We will examine the open source information and then try to create our own network map using traceroutes. Third, we will look at the Techniques that the adversary employs. And fourth, we will conquer Translation. The goal is to level the playing field for those who do not speak a foreign language. This briefing paves the way for amateur and professional hackers to move beyond their lonely linguistic and cultural orbit in order to do battle on far-away Internet terrain.\n\nFueled by business needs such as supply chain integration and outsourcing, modern enterprises must open up portions of their networks to potentially untrusted outsiders. Combined with the troubling aspects of malicious insiders, ever more sophisticated attacks, increasing network complexity, and strong pressure from regulatory bodies to rapidly identify breaches and assess damages, there is a rapidly growing concern over internal network security. IT departments must work harder than ever to prevent insiders and outsiders from gaining unauthorized access to critical assets deep in the network, and if such access ever occurs, identify and report on, the impact of such a security breach.\n\nIn order to gain real insight into the dynamic behavior of their networks, IT departments must monitor huge quantities of data, where individual elements of a sophisticated attack may be spread out over long periods of time, and vast numbers of logs. Many tools are available to identify individual phases of an attack, such as IDSs, network based anomaly detection tools, host based monitoring tools, and even firewalls. However, this data is presented to the security analyst as a series of unrelated suspicious events. Because of the complexity of modern networks there are always isolated and seemingly suspicious things occurring on the network. To find a sophisticated breach the individual pieces of an attack need to be tied together for successful analysis.\n\nOne approach to determining relationships between events is by defining rules, such as: if some set of events happens around the same time, they are probably related, and should be presented as a correlated event. Unfortunately this places the burden on the security analyst of predefining attack scenarios for their particular network. Unlike virus detection which can leverage the entire anti-virus community to identify and write appropriate signature files, internal network security has no such analogy. Every enterprise network has unique characteristics requiring company specific rules. While rules are good for identifying problems with well defined signatures, they aren’t capable of relating attack elements separated by large time intervals, and obscured by benign activity on the surrounding hosts. The missing piece is causal analysis, which can automatically link together suspicious events independent of the normal network activity that occurs between the various phases of a security breach. The benefit of the causal analysis approach is that chains of related and suspicious activity provide a strategic overview of network behavior allowing a security analyst to focus their efforts on attacks in progress. When they have a readable chain of anomalous behavior, the security team can trace the attack vector back to the entry point, and find the so-called “patient zero.”\n\nThis presentation demonstrates the value of causal analysis using a simple example that involves social networks rather than computer networks, how this example is really a metaphor for a very common form of computer network attack, and how causal analysis is equally appropriate in finding this sort of attack in enterprise networks. It then presents some of the factors that compound the difficulty of this analysis in real networks, and describes approaches that simplify this complexity. Using the techniques described, two real “stepping stone” attacks are outlined and diagrammed to illustrate the power of causal analysis. Finally, it demonstrates how this analysis can be combined with other forms of security analytic and mitigation techniques to provide a formidable barrier against network attacks.\n\nKevin Mahaffey is the Director of Development for Flexilis, a R&D firm based in Los Angeles, where he researches security issues in current and emerging technologies.

The Guide to Securing Web Applications and Services 2.0 is a major new release  written from the ground up, with many new sections covering common and emerging risks, including:\n\nHow to design more secure software\n\nHow to conduct a security review using the Guide\n\nHow to perform the most difficult web application processes correctly: processing credit cards, interacting with payment gateways (such as PayPayl), and anti-phishing controls\n\nReorganized and easily navigated chapters on web application controls including: web services, comprehensive authentication and authorization controls, session management, data validation, interpreter injection, and many new controls within existing chapters\n\nSecure configuration and deployment\n\nAnd software quality assurance.\n\nThe Guide has adopted and extended the popular OWASP Top 10 approach  security objectives, how to identify if you are at risk, with recommended remediations in three popular frameworks, and further reading. The Guide is platform neutral, and has examples in J2EE, ASP.NET and PHP. The Guide 2.0 is on the conference materials CD-ROM in its entirety. As it is free (as in beer as well as in freedom), you can redistribute or print it as often as you wish.\n\nTo demonstrate the incredible versatility of the Guide and its pragmatic approach, we will be conducting a live security review of software selected at random by the audience. To perform the review demonstration, we will be using just a few off-the-shelf web development tools with Firefox to demonstrate how easy it is to subvert the average application, and how simple it is to fix issues properly by using the Guide.\n\nWe expect this talk will be useful to all attendees, but those who set secure coding standards within their organization, manage risk from custom software, manage software development or are software architects or developers will benefit the most from attending this session."
