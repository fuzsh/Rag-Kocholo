Convert audio and video files with free MediaCoder

MediaCoderis the all-purpose media file converter. In my opinion it is surely one of the best open source programs out there. You can convert easily almost any type of audio or video file.

You can convert files to your video iPod, cell phone, PDA, PSP, or choose other formats to store on your computer. Read More â
