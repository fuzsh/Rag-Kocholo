I need to know how to convert them from the format used for Macs to a windows platform. What are the different file types used for Macs and what do I need to convert them to? What is the best technique to convert them?\n\nDepends on what your source video format actually is. Odds are your worst case scenario is having to install Quicktime or something like VLC on the Windows computers. Video codecs are fairly standardized now days so playback shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nIf you can figure out what format your videos are currently we could fill in more details.\n\nWell, to my knowledge there aren’t Mac or PC videos. You probably could open the file with Notepad, and using the text in there you might be able to figure out what format the file is. If it is quicktime, just install quicktime. It really depends on the file format and codecs used.\n\nFirst you need to determine what the current format is. You may find that it works just fine on a PC running a Windows OS.\n\nIf not, I would take a look at http://download.com, which is a service of C/NET for rattings on freeware applications that can convert from one video format to another.\n\nI use video-to-video on a pc.\n\nMost likely you have .Mov or .MP4 files. If they are MP4, you are all set. Windows 7 and up has the codec. If they are Mov, you can use any video conversion software on the market.\n\nMedia coder is another nice one.\n\nhttp://www.freewarefiles.com/Video-to-Video-Converter_program_79676.html\n\nI don’t know what you mean by Mac videos. There are two things that might affect playback on different computers. They are not specific to any OS. The first one is the container and the second one the video and audio codex. If you are trying to open a video with a program that does not support either the container (.mkv, mpg, etc) or the codex (h.264, etc) then you need to convert it.\n\nA solution to your problem would be to install VLC on both computers. This video program lets you open virtually any container and any codex without having to go through hoops.\n\nDo you need to open the videos with a specific program?\n\nYes, If you just want to play them, VLC is a GREAT option. Do make sure that CNet or whoever lets you download it doesn’t force a “download helper” or something like a friendly toolbar on your machine.\n\nWith VLC though, you can probably find out what type of file it is, which will be auto-detected by VLC most likely."
