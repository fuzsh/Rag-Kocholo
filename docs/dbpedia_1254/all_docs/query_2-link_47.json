I will try to mediacode the video, try different audio settings and see how it goes and report back.\n\nOr maybe, do you know what's the easiest transcoding for Lightworks to import? I'm thinking maybe taking away an audio track? But I'm no genius when it comes to softwares.\n\nThe videos are still in a heavily compressed state, as is the audio. What you may end up doing is transcoding to either lightly compressed or uncompressed video and uncompressed audio. I don't how to solve the problem but if you can't stand the big files, strip the audio from the files and import them separately as pcm WAV into Lightworks. EyeFrame Converter gives you a lot of options in this regard.\n\nI did that. Worked fine. Now I'm facing a new problem. It's the wrong forum but maybe you know the answer. I've trimmed 2 minutes video and 2 minutes audio and synced it perfectly. First I do the video, mark my in and out and import it (declicking audio tracks). The edit timeline shows to just over 2 minutes.\n\nWhen I do the same for audio, and declick the Videotrack it fills in the audio perfect, but somehow Lightworks adds up the time of the video and the audio and makes a 4 minute film (which is just a black screen without sound for the latter part).\n\nSomehow I just don't find Lightworks very easy to work with and somewhat dumb in it's logic. I thought I would be smart, just add the 4 minute clip into Lightworks and trim 2 minutes off it and export it but once again it can only import the video and just doesn't know there's 2 audio tracks on it. And this is from a newly Lightworks exported video with audio.\n\nIf you've done what I believe that you've done that result is entirely predictable. It sounds like you're overthinking this somewhat.\n\nI'll tell you how I would have done it. I would have parked at the sync point in the source video. At this stage I would not have bothered to create a new edit. Also I wouldn't be worrying too much about the audio at all. I would have then pressed the B key (replace into the target edit) with no edit open. This would have created a new edit containing the video from the point I was parked on the source to the end of the clip.\n\nOn that new edit I would have then disabled the video in the timeline. Since I would already have automatically been parked at the start of the edit, no further action would be necessary. So next I would open the source audio and park at the sync point on that and again press the B key.\n\nFinally, on the edit I would enable all tracks then just press the S key once, then I then S again, then X. In plain English that translates to \"jump forward to the next cut/event\" (S), \"mark in\" (I), \"jump forward to the next cut/event\", \"delete the marked section\" (X). What that would do is jump to the end of whichever track finishes first, then delete anything in the timeline after that.\n\nThere are additional steps that you can go through to allow you to handle your newly synced media as an original clip and not as an edit. However at this stage you owe it to yourself to go to the Lightworks Video Tutorials and check them the Lightworks tutorials out. You will also find very good user tutorials in the Hints & Tips forum.\n\nLightworks is like very few other NLEs. The basic rules are few and very simple. When handled the way that it was designed to be used it's one of the fastest out there. But if you try to blunder your way through you risk making it one of the slowest and most frustrating, especially if you're coming to it from another NLE.\n\nSomehow I just don't find Lightworks very easy to work with and somewhat dumb in it's logic. I thought I would be smart, just add the 4 minute clip into Lightworks and trim 2 minutes off it and export it but once again it can only import the video and just doesn't know there's 2 audio tracks on it. And this is from a newly Lightworks exported video with audio.\n\nI understand your frustration. Lightworks didn't used to import that type of material at all. Now they made it to import the compressed media but it still doesn't always work right sometimes. The technical side of video is very complex. If everything worked right, you could do exactly what you want. It works correctly most of the time and the development team is working on it to make it work more consistently on compressed media."
