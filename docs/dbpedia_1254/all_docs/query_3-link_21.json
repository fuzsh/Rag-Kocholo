        "text": "Hello I started using Mediacoder to convert all my videos into x265/HEVEC MKV container everything is going great I use Nvenec because I have GTX 1070 I get around x14-15 speed but my cpu is around 60-70% and my videocard is around 9-12% . Is there anyway to increase the GPU load so things go faster? I use Mediacoder 0.8.36 Buld 5750 . I am open to using other problems I just have a lot of videos around 6TB worth of them and so far the only program that has Nvenec use and doesn't crash if I add more than 200 files is mediacoder. I am using windows 10 by the way. I use ffmpeg in the video>source option as I've been told it's best for this kind of encoding. I know it's quite new maybe it's not optimised but if someone knows how to make my gpu load higher please help.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"GPU Load\"? How are you measuring it? The NVENC/VCE parts of nvidia/AMD gpus are seperate components on the die that don't show under \"GPU Load\" in a tool such as GPU-Z for example. It may be that you're already hitting the limits of the hardware encoder.\n\nAnother bottleneck may be disk - decoding a high bitrate video at ~15x realtime means a lot of data to stream off your HDD. And of course another bottleneck could be decoding. FFmpeg is most likely software decoding.\n\nYou may want to try A's video converter, it supports H.265 with NVENC, as well as hardware decoding and hardware filtering (resize, effects etc). As a bonus, it's also not borderline malware unlike Mediacoder\n\n/off topic\n\nMediacoder's developer annoys me in that he completely ignores AMD. AMD's had an SDK available to use the video encoding SIP in their GPUs for 5 years, but never any attempt to implement it in Mediacoder. As an example of its ease of implementation, a hobby developer got an OBS AMD VCE livestreaming plugin working in his free time in 2 days. I posted about this on the Mediacoder forum asking about AMD VCE support and my post was blocked :P\n\nI am using Afterburner to measure gpu load other than the load the card is jumping to 2000mhz core clock also the memory to 8000mhz which means it's stressed. Just to be clear you mean this software right? Yeah mediacoder are worst I am waiting 2 days for someone to approve my thread there I was wondering why there were so few posts and threads. So I've tried it I get 750 FPS on 720p video x264 , but i get 0 load on my card from afterburner which shouldn't be correct because my cpu isn't loaded at all. Is there a way to make it into MKV cause it puts them in mp4, also for audio there aren't quite a few options for the movies that I want, so for like DTS an so on I just untick \"convert audio\" right ? And I get to keep the original sound of the movie\n\nClock speed doesn't necessarily mean high load. For example, NVENC usage doesn't (or shouldn't) affect game FPS. I.e. NVENC isn't \"loading\" the GPU as the game can still render fine. At least this is the case for AMD with VCE. Another example; in regular gaming or running furmark the card will reach max clocks, but one is fine and the other can kill your card Afterburner is measuring your GPU load (i.e. 3D rendering), not NVENC load. Think of NVENC as another component that just lives on your GPU's PCB.\n\nVideo conversion uses a notable amount of PCIe/VRAM bandwidth, the card must clock up to manage all this but is otherwise idle. So stop looking at clocks speeds as an indicator of NVENC \"load\". It's probably already maxed out; the hardware encoding blocks have a set specific max throughput. I.e. a first generation GCN card like a 7970 will do 1080p H264 at 85fps, nothing will make it go faster."
