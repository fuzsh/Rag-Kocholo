        "text": "I have Nero 11 which has Nero Recode built into it.\n\nI tried converting a 1.9 GB MP4 video to WMV to make the size smaller at the same quality but upon choosing best or good quality in Nero Recode, the size jumped up to 3.9 GB and 3.5 GB\n\nI then tried converting it using DVDVideoSoft Free Studio v5.6.3.723 and while the size was a little smaller, the quality was not good if you looked closely in the video you would notice there are some squares.\n\nIs there an easy to use video converter that can change between various formats at the same quality as the source video?\n\nTry SUPER by ESoft.\n\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Encoders-Converter-DIVX-Related/SUPER.shtml\n\nVery good quality, lots of options, and it doesn't require .NET framework.\n\nBe careful during installation as it offers to change your default search provider and home page; actions which you can refuse.\n\n-And the size of a converted file versus the original will vary depending the format you choose to convert to and the quality level you desire.\n\nOne other free converter I like is by Daniusoft.\n\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Multim...-Related/Daniusoft-Video-Converter-Free.shtml\n\nVery simple to use, reasonably fast, does not require .NET, and has useful user options.\n\nthe only reason I want to convert this file from MP4 to WMV is when I click on a point in the seekbar, it takes like a second or two till it resumes playback, but with WMV files it resumes instantly from the new point\n\nMight be a problem with your codecs, maybe you should try FFDSHow/LAV codecs. However check the following for extensive list of video converters:\n\nhxxp://www.videohelp.com/tools/sections/video-encoders\n\nI myself use MEGUI and Hybrid for encoding, FormatFactory is good too, except the adware.\n\nThe only codecs I use are:\n\nmadVR + LAV + ffdshow + MPC-HC\n\nand it doesnt happen with other videos man. don't know why only with 2 of the ones I have\n\nJust a thought, you might enable the internal mp4 source filters and relevant codec transform filters (h264 in your case probably) if that solves the problem. You might also try to manually add ffdshow and lav in the external filters list and preferring one above another or vice versa. Also if you're not using intel quicksync/nvidia cuda, and your mobo supports either of them, you might try to enable it.\n\nI use that one too (AVC), namely to convert flash.\n\nI use FS v 4.1... it's much lighter than the newer versions, which now run on .NET Framework (coincidence, I think not). And the file sizes are MUCH smaller I've come to find with identical quality, pound for pound much better off. On 4.1 I can convert to high quality something that on later versions wouldn't even fit on 1 (4.7 GB) disc at the same quality. This became especially problematic because I was converting TV shows and compressing and trying to fit as many as possible onto 1 disc.\n\nI used DVD Shrink 3.2 for the compression btw...\n\nAnd ImgBurn 2.3.2.0 for images, especially bootable ones. Very handy for slipstreaming new SP's/updates into OS discs.\n\nBetween these softwares they cover all my needs.\n\nWhat is FS v 4.1 and where can it be downloaded ?\n\nThanks\n\nrrrh1 (arch1)\n\nFS = Free Studio. The site is DVDvideosoft if I recall. Let me see if I can find it, and the older versions for you here... yep, here you go:\n\nhttp://www.dvdvideosoft.com/earlier-versions-of-dvd-video-soft.htm\n\nI'd take the latest build of version 4.1 (4.1.3.60)... that's the one I've got. Pretty sure v 4.2 is when it started running on .NET Framework, and became bloated. Also the video to DVD converter file sizes got way bigger, with no increase in quality.\n\nThe Youtube converters will be completely dated though, but I don't use it for that. I use the Video to DVD converter, Audio CD Burner, Data Disc Burner, and DVD Video Burner. They're light & work fine. The DVD Decrypter has some value too, though there are better ones."
