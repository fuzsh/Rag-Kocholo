        "text": "If you are planning to make a short video or a film then several factors need to be considered and frame rate is one of them. Frame rate is a crucial factor that decides a pleasant and smooth viewing experience. The need for frame rate conversion may arise while creating a new film or while editing an existing video and to get this task done efficiently, good software is needed. Know more what is frame rate, its conversion, and related tools are discussed in the following parts.\n\nPart 1. What does frame rate mean?\n\nThe frame rate that is also known as FPS (frames per second) is the rate at which the consecutive images are displayed. While a video is played, it looks like a continuous recording but in reality, they are pictures of multiple images that are played at a speed back-to-back to make it look like a continuous and smooth motion. These multiple images are known as frames and the speed at which these frames are displayed is termed as the frame rate or fps.Â\n\nFrame rate plays an important role in deciding the style of the video as well as the viewing experience. Videos with different frame rates offer different viewing experiences. Thus, depending on what you are trying to create and portray, the frame of the video has to be set. Moreover, depending on the genre, display, and mode of entertainment, the frame rate of the video can be set.Â\n\nDifferent video-sharing sites have their recommendation for the frame rates for a seamless viewing experience. For instance, Vimeo recommends the video frame rate to be between 24 FPS to 30FPS while YouTube recommends between 24FPS to 60FPS. Further, the frame rate will vary as per the type of content, the type of camera equipment used, target audience, and other factors.Â\n\nPart 2.
