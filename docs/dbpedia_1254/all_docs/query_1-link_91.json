        "text": "This works\n\n1. Downlaod a free copy of Super by eRightSoft\n\n2. In box 1 select MP4\n\n3. In box 2 select H.264/AVC\n\n4. In box 3 select AAC\n\n5. In the video scale size option select 320:240\n\n6. In the aspect option select 16:9\n\n7. In the frame/sec option select 30\n\nDo not change anything else.\n\nNow get the video you want to convert and drag/copy it into the grey box at the bottom of the page.\n\nPress Encode\n\nOnce it's complete right click anywhere and select 'Output File Saving Management'\n\nChoose a destination on your computer e.g. My Videos and hit 'save changes'.\n\nYou can then go to your chosen destination e.g. My Videos, copy the file and save it into the video section of your Walkman.\n\nGood luck\n\n0\n\nI posted earlier that converting psp format to play on the Sony walkman is perfect but now i've found the sound to have a kind of distracting echo.\n\nHeres what I did to get the video quality and sound quality (in sync) perfect.\n\nConverted the video I wanted to ipod format using the following settings:\n\nvideo quality - 1500kbits/sec\n\naudio quality - 64kbits/sec\n\nscreen size - 320x240\n\nframe rate - 29.97\n\nsample rate - 44100Hz\n\nLike the dude above says copy and paste the converted video into the video folder of the walkman.\n\nGood luck, it took me two days of farting around to get mine sorted so hope I helped someone.\n\nyou have excessive bitrate for 320x240 video. waste of space mainly, you can get away with as low as 384. audio quality should be boosted to atleast 128kbps or you will have horrible quality sound.\n\ni can get mp4 mpeg4 files to work using xilisoft and handbrake. but getting an encode to work through h264 is so far unsucessful:( jodix free converter also works for video conversion to the mpeg4 format. but what i really want working is h264\n\n0\n\nHas anyone got the Sony NWZ-A829,if so are there the same probs with getting video onto it,I noted on the web you have to use Media manager pro (which you have to pay for nice one Sony) is this correct. My grand daughter is looking at this for her birthday,any help please.\n\nthe 72x and 82x series are the same in all ways except the 82x series has blue tooth.\n\ngetting video on it isn't a real problem. hand brake is free and useful for dvd encodes.256kbps or 384kbps mpeg 4 looks decent. decrypting dvds is always an issue for any software, i doubt sonys software does any decrypting, those kinds just tell you only to encode legal things blabbity blah and let you figure out how to decrypt yourself esp since sony keeps releasing new dvds with newer protection that break ripper programs every couple months or so. anydvd or dvdfab both work for that. dvdfab has a free version that just rips without encoding. or you can pay for a whole solution in one from dvdfab. their ripper works well. and they keep updating it to keep up with companies like sony;)\n\njodix free ipod converter also works for converting avis and stuff.\n\nmpeg4 generally works without hitches. its the h264 codec thats hard to get working.\n\n0\n\nfor handbrake the mkv format container works for h264 though what handbrake actually names them is m4v. i think mp4 is whats used with mpeg4. i've used mp4 container with h264 in media coder, fiddle around i guess, i don't use the mpeg4 much after i got h264 working. so its gotta be one of the two containers:P\n\nits gotta be baseline 1.3 0 b-predictor frames cabac off(in advanced) in media coder or paste level=13:bframes=0:cabac=0 in advanced tab of handbrake. just start off with ipod low res preset with handbrake and modify from there. no special settings for mpeg4 but its compression is slightly less efficient, though its cpu use is more efficient. 8-9 hours for h264 depending on bitrate, 9-10 hours on mpeg4 depending on bitrate. 300kbps average bitrate or less is sufficient for h264 film to be without artifacts, you can lower it but eventually you see artifacts during high motion. it depends how perfect you want it to be, you can get away with quite low bitrate. i use the quality based setting in mediacoder and left it at 50. second turbo pass in handbrake is fast so might as well do it. sound is always lc-aac, i use 128kbps or some quality based bitrate that is equivalent or more, no need to sacrifice sound quality on videos on this device esp when sound quality is what its good at.\n\n0\n\nConverted the video I wanted to ipod format using the following settings:\n\nvideo quality - 1500kbits/sec\n\naudio quality - 64kbits/sec\n\nscreen size - 320x240\n\nframe rate - 29.97\n\nsample rate - 44100Hz\n\nvideo bitrate way way way too high. even mpeg4 can work without artifacts at 384kbps.\n\neven less with h264.\n\neven less for both if you sacrifice a little quality.\n\nscreen size is correct.\n\naudiobitrate is way too low. 128kbps lc_aac minimum. no need to sacrifice audio quality on these devices. 64bit is web audio quality which is why you get echo.\n\nframerate depends on video, the software generally figures it out based on the source framerate, the walkman does 24-30fps just fine.\n\n0\n\nSpooky - I was just wondering why my NWZA wouldn't play an MP4 video that I downloaded earlier, and this thread suggested that it's the format causing the error. My fix was easy, but not a no-cost option unless you already have the s/w, but all I did was to open up Ulead VideoStudio and create an MP4 video in that using the PSP settings. Once the new file had been dragged into the Sony it played first time without any sound issues or other problems. One minor point is that the original MP4 was about 6meg, the converted one is nearer 13meg. Not a problem though.\n\n0\n\nI was given a Sony NWZ-A815 Video Walkman. 2\" screen with Drag and Drop.\n\nAs I have both a Sony NW-HD3 and Tosiba E800 with a decent size screen it has never been used.\n\nAnyone interested?\n\nThis is it\n\nhttp://www.play.com/Electronics/Electronics/4-/3476819/-/Product.html?searchstring=NWZA815B&searchsource=0\n\nI am looking towards half of this.\n\nMight also mention that there is Super C which is a good all formats video convertor.\n\n0"
