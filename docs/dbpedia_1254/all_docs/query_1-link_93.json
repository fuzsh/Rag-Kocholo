I tried it but it would convert each divx file into a 4.something GB vob(dvd) file, even though the original size was a fraction of that.... and moreover, it took 3 hours to do that!!\n\nwill try mediacoder once I am don with my exams (tomorrow ).\n\nWould Ulead DVD Movie Factory let me do what I want to dohttp://www.broadbandforum.co/index.php?act=findpost&pid=51741?"
