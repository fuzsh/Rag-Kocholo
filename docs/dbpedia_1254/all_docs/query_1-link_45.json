First of all, this is a SANDISK run forum you jerk!\n\nsecondly notice that my other posts NEVER got answered…one minute, one hour or 10 days later.\n\nI stand by what I said\n\nthirdly…hammer this you disrespectful fool…I’m tired of the “GURUS” I am looking to for help insulting me.\n\nIf ANYONE had answered these questions it would be different, but I stand by what I’ve been saying.\n\nNo one knows the answer and no one has bothered to give a direct answer to ANYONE…just insults.\n\nso pound sand…if you’ve got something to really say…\n\nas i keep saying…pitiful!\n\nAnyone expectng anything other than BS on this is in for a disappointment.\n\nAnd are you trying to say that Sansafix has yet to see ANY of my posts on this? He still hasn’t?\n\nI guess I ticked him of.\n\nPitiful.\n\nAnyone else care to insult me?\n\nAs Tapeworm confirmed, the SMC is just licenced by Sansa. They pay the other company money to put their name on the app and distribute the software.\n\nSimilarly, Disney licenced it’s characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy) to Square-Enix for use in the Kingdom Hearts series of games. If you had issues with the way that Donald’s attack performed, or Goofy’s AI was designed, you wouldn’t go screaming on Disney’s forum that they should have done better and should fix your problem. Disney had little to do with making the game, and can do nothing to fix the issues.\n\nIf I had to guess, someone at the executive level of Sandisk decided that it would be more cost-effective to licence the Media Converter software from the provider, rather than develop it in-house from scratch. The developers who hang out on the forum aren’t even the ones you should be complaining to about that decision.\n\nEdit: I should clarify something. I prefer to use MediaCoder as my transcoding app. If the Fuze’s video format wasn’t keyed, I’d be using it as my converter for video, rather than SMC.\n\nMessage Edited by ROMzombie on 11-10-2008 03:35 PM\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, my fuze is only good enough for short easily converted youtube videos.\n\nI realized a long time ago that this is all it is good for, video-wise.\n\nAt this point, I am anxiously awaiting preloaded movie content…that would solve all my issues.\n\nI love my Fuze for it’s music capabilities and guess I’ll have to be happy with that.\n\nMy issue at this point is I feel gypped. I have invested a LOT of money in this thing and it only does half what I PAID for. And all I get from the “GURUS” here is ignored, BS, half answers and insults.\n\nCheck no\n\nOK?\n\nIt probably is not being addressed.\n\nI have felt some frustration too, but I’ve just had to realize that it’s only a $100 mp3 player.\n\nAlready you get an FM radio, voice recorder, FM radio recorder, photo viewer and on top of all of that you get video capability with a quirky video converter. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just drag and drop mpeg 4, avi, or whatever directly? Yes. But it’s not a $500 device, and it’s not a laptop, and it’s not a real video player. You CAN get a protable DVD player with a LOT bigger screen that has USB and memory card capability that will play DivX movies as well, for under $100!\n\nSo despite all the capability, it is only what it is. And Sansa is probably not going to spend another $250,000 next year to upgrade the converter and make it perfect.\n\nI agree that it would be “nice” of them to state the exact status of things, but this world is not perfect.\n\nOkay folks, let’s keep it civil. Taunts and insults have absolutely no place here on the forum.\n\nThe primary purpose of this forum is for users to share findings and experiences in the interest of getting the most from your Sansa. The SanDisk staff visit regularly, but like the rest of us, we have other tasks to do, not just monitoring the forums 24 hours a day.\n\nIf you have an urgent concern, feel free to call 1-866-SANDISK during business hours. An ounce of civility goes further than a mountain of insults.\n\nBob\n\nImo Sandisk should have left off the video on the Fuze, and added more audio features instead. How about AM radio, a microphone jack, and ability to record in mp3 with a user selectable bitrate? Video on a player with such a small screen is imo silly. The short runtime also makes video on the Fuze impractical. There is the View for those who want video. Imo a feature should only be added to a player if it can be robust and high performance. I wouldn’t describe video on the Fuze as being that way. Voice recording on the Fuze is marginally useful, however I would have like to have it improved instead of having video(many students need to be able to record lectures for the back of a large room). Now that tape recorders are disappearing, there are no practical, small, inexpensive digital recorders with a mic jack that are capable of recording lectures from the rear of a large lecture hall.\n\nI’ve heard several people say that. I respectfully disagree. I have already flown once with my Fuze and was quite happy watching a movie. Of course this old fart needed my reading glasses, but the unit wedged nicely in the seatback and was quite watchable. I have several dozen old public domain movies on many cards that I watch at night when I don’t want to disturb the wifal unit. I can see the picture just fine. If I put the unit up to my face, the Fuze is a big screen TV LOL.The audio delay issue really chafes my butt, made worse by the lack of progress (never mind) acknowledgement on this issue.\n\nThere were 3 times as many movies that did not convert than did. And it took me three days to figure out how to get that far.\n\nMy bottom line is that I DID indeed buy this unit to wach videos and I really feel gypped. It didn’t say on the box “Primarily an MP3 player, your on your own on the video thing” I would have seen that, I’m sure.\n\njk98\n\n“Video on a player with such a small screen is imo silly”\n\nI thought so too! but I have been surprised. If you get good quality video material off You-tube for instance, the results are acutally quite spectacular…and entertaining, on your commute to work or waiting for a ride, etc.\n\nI agree that it would be great to have a mic jack. But it’s pretty cool that there’s voice recording at all.\n\nDon’t the small Olympus digital recorders that have replaced the older microcasette units have a subminiature mic input jack?\n\nOr Sitting at a biology lesson, with a full harry potter film makes biology nice.\n\nSo every day I’m waiting for biology:smileyvery-happy:\n\nThe Quality is absolutely exeeding expectations if you ask me, only my father finds it small, but if I’m holding it half an arm whem sitting on the couch it is (relatively) the same size than watching tv.\n\nSo people are (look) the same size, but we don’t have a giant flat screen but an old Television, maybe that’s why.\n\nI Enjoy looking to it, fully.\n\nRik"
