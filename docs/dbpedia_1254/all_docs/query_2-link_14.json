It has evidently been designed to please demanding users seeking for perfect media conversion with a high level of customization.\n\nIts multi-language interface features three modes with different complexity levels: simple, normal and expert. However, in my opinion, the simple mode, even with the help of the available wizard, may be still too difficult for some users with little experience. The difficulty arises because of the use of many technical words, most of which the standard user may not be acquainted with."
