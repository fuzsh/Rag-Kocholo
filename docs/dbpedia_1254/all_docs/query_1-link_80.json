        "text": "While that could be an option it's still doesn't answer the question. There MUST be somewhere to change this within Media Encoder to leave as the original. I have thousands of videos. I don't want to go through them 1 by 1 to change them back to the original date they were created. Who has time for that? Also, why download yet another program to do what Encoder should already do in the first place. It makes no sense. Can someone from Adobe Media Encoder answer this?\n\nYour original question: \"How do I keep the original date & time when exporting from MPG to say... HEVC ???\"\n\nThe answer: You can't.\n\nThis is not an Adobe issue. File creation date and time is not determined by Adobe, it is determined by your Operating System. Again, this NOT metadata. Adobe deals in metadata. Creation date and time are file attributes. They are not \"assigned,\" they simply \"are.\" When you export a file from AME, you are creating a new file, hence the current date and time. You are complaining on the wrong forum, you should be on Microsoft or Apple's support forums.\n\nThe program I linked can do files in batches, you don't have to go through one by one.\n\nI get what you're saying Jeff - but it's still inexcusable of Adobe. It should be simple as programming the software such as a clickable box to mark 'Keep Original Date' as creation date.\n\nFor those that want to do archiving, we don't want to lose the original creation date for videos or photos or you lose when that memory happened. Does the program you recommend allow you to import say 1000 images and videos, change the extension format, and then keep the original date for all of them? If not then it would be 1 by 1 because every image and every video has a different date and time. For photography, I want to remember the exact date in order to do future photos in the same area and I can reference to remember what it was like during that time. I didn't download the program because it's not in the apple store but I did download an app called 'File Date Modifier.' I love the app but again... you have to do each image 1 by 1 to get and adjust the file attribute to what you want. If that simple program can do it - then so can Media Coder if they simply put the parameters in the software. Adobe's lack of incorporating the programming has nothing to do with Microsoft or apple. It's in how Adobe programmed the software. Its beautiful software lacking a major simple yet important detail. Maybe they will see this post and realize they need to change it. I'd rather have just 1 program instead of 10\n\nVery frustrating. I use a program called A Better File Attributes, which will let you change timestamps in an automated way, even with videos in the newest version. I just realized I'm losing the GPS and camera info during the transcode. All the meta data should carry over. Looks like the options say it should too.\n\nFor my home videos I just import them into Lightroom Classic with all my photos. LR does not seem to take system creation date into account when importing, at least not reliably over my NAS. It likes the Date Time Original meta field, which can usually be set manually using Adobe Bridge.\n\nHello,\n\nI had the same problem while trying to convert a few thousand home videos to a smaller format. After 4 miserable hours, I put together a powershell script that looks at each file in the new directory, and writes the modified time stamp from the folder to it as the modified and created time.\n\nIf your encoded and original filenames are the same (except for the extension), then hopefully this would help. I'd be happy to upload the text from the script that I made as long as it doesn't violate the community guidelines. Attached are a few pictures showing how it works. Please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve the script!\n\nThanks, that's a much easier solution! I was trying to use the Attribute Changer program that Jeff mentioned, but couldn't get it to look for the date in another folder so I didn't try further.\n\nIt looks like I could have used BulkFileChanger to rename the files, then Attribute Changer to modify the created date based off of the name on all the videos in the folder, then BulkFileChanger again to remove the added date from the name.\n\nIf it's in the right format, you might be able to get the modified date changed using Attribute Changer. I think it also had a batch feature, so it should do them all at once\n\nHi I'm having a somewhat similar issue. So what happens is that i'm looking to get the \"Year\" field information the same but it always exports them to have the current year in the \"Year' field (So 2023 is showing up on every file).\n\nAll the other field information is the same as it was before but year seems to be the only part i can't figure out. I've tried using the export settings perservation rules but it still isnt work.\n\nIs there any way to do this? Can you help please? Or Maybe create an update for this issue?"
