It predates the digital video formats.\n\nIf you want to edit the video on the computer it will have to be digitized. I believe the best format for that is either direct into the computer using an A/D card or using a DV camcorder as a converter and transfer device. At any rate you want a video format on the computer that has discreet frames, not a DVD format. DVD format is a dialect of MPEG 2 and does not use discreet frames. It is a delivery and presentation format.\n\nDiscreet video formats might include AVI and MOV and DV. While DV is both a wrapper and a codec definition, AVI and MOV are simply wrappers and would also require a video codec. I suggest staying with DV.\n\nIf you can borrow a DV camcorder that has video inputs, that's probably the best method. It will have an IEEE-488 connection (firewire) and either allow conversion from the analog source on-the-fly or you might have to record the source video onto DV cassettes first, which might not be a bad idea.\n\nIt's also a good idea to first noise filter the analog video because DV has a fixed data rate and if you don't filter the noise, much of what you record will be noise. I suggest a high-end VCR that has video DNR or Faroudja video noise reduction to do the filtering.\n\nOnce you get the DV files on the computer it should be easy to find a suitable video editor, but it may not already be on your machine.\n\nLikewise there are many DVD burner software available that can handle DV video as the source.\n\nNext time, just use a DV camcorder and save yourself a lot of trouble when you want to edit on the computer.\n\nziggy53\n\nModerator of the Cameras and Accessories forums\n\n0\n\nVideo editing software for Windows? (7D vids)\n\nLately I've been taking more and more video with my 7D, and I need to find a software package to piece together my cinematographic masterpieces.\n\nI'm strictly an amateur, and would like something that is easy to use, but produces high quality videos. I don't much care for all these fancy special effects, and I have no desire to produce DVDs, but I do want the ability to do simple transitions, and fading titles and credits.\n\nI've downloaded trial copies of Vegas Movie Studio HD, Pinnacle Studio HD and Cyberlink's PowerDirector 8, and after a few initial tests my results are mixed.\n\nI've found that Pinnacle Studio HD is the easiest to use, but I have been unimpressed with the output quality when compared to the other two.\n\nCyberlink's PowerDirector was fairly simple to use, and it's output quality seemed slightly better than Pinnacle Studio HD's, but still not as good as that of Sony Vegas Studio. I also found that I was having a hard time modifying the behaviors of the transitions, but it might simply be that I don't know how to do it.\n\nSony Vegas Studio HD clearly produced the best quality output (see below), but I found its interface and dialogs very confusing and I am not sure I have the time to devote to learning it. With the other two apps I was able to add titles and transitions simply by trial and error, but with Vegas Studio I couldn't figure it out on my own.\n\nPinnacle and PowerDirector were very easy to use and are solidly in the consumer camp, while Vegas is a few steps ahead with regards to its capabilities, but is perhaps too complex for my needs.\n\nCan any recommend anything in between?\n\nA question about quality...\n\nI was quite surprised to see a differnece in output quality between Pinnacle/PowerDirector and Vegas Studio even though similar output paratmeters were chosen. For example, I output videos from each in WMV format at 720p 30fps (for streaming to my xBox) using the same video bit-rate. In addition, both PowerDirector and Vegas Studio both tell me they are unsing the Windows Media 9 encoder. The videos from Pinnacle and PowerDirector were dark, while the video from Vegas seemed to be of a higher quality with better contrast even though I applied no image/color corrections to it. Perhaps it's simply a lack of my understanding of the software and process, but if they are using the same or similar encoders how is this the case?\n\nPS - I am going to give Corel's VideoStudio Pro X3 a try next.\n\nBrad\n\nMy SmugMug\n\n0\n\nThanks Ziggy, there is some great info there, but I am still not sold on Vegas. It's powerful, but some of its dialogs and option boxes are IMHO not user friendly at all. In the short-term I think simple is better for me.\n\nI've been playing with these video editors and learning a lot. My first thoughts were that I wanted an editing package that would handle the native 7D files, but after doing a bit of research, I'm not so sure editing these compressed files is such a good idea.\n\nYes I know, I want it both ways... simple and high-quality.\n\nI found that Vegas Studio, Pinnacle Studio HD and PowerDirector 8 all handled the native 7D files with relative ease, but Corel's VideoStudio Pro X3 crashed frequently. This was disappointing because I felt that Corel's software was potentially what I was looking for; more powerful and polished than Pinnacle or PowerDirector, but more user-friendly than Vegas.\n\nI the installed MPEG Streamclip and converted the native 7D MOV files to MP4 (100% quality), which Corel was able to handle without issue and which produced some really fantastic high-quality results.\n\nThe conumdrum I face now is whether or not it is important for me to be able to edit the native files, or if I am willing to accept the added step of converting to a more edit-friendly format. Tradeoffs!\n\nSome links I found interesting and useful...\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/forums/topic:23548\n\nhttp://buildyourown.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/how-to-transcode-mov-files/\n\nhttp://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/education/technical/frame_rate_conversion.do\n\nBrad\n\nMy SmugMug\n\n0\n\nI just installed Corel's VideoStudio Pro X3 (VSP X3) yesterday and I'm just starting to play with it. I was resisting even looking at it because I thought I needed more functionality, but the more I look at it the more it would suit many video projects. (This was formerly a ULead product and I liked both it and the more advanced MediaStudio Pro in the past.)\n\nThis software is for Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP with latest service packs.\n\nVSP X3 has the ability to load 1 - primary video track and then up to 6 additional \"overlay\" tracks. The overlay tracks can be used for video PIP or similar but it looks like they can also be used in a multi-camera shoot as well.\n\nNormal video with audio can be split, putting the audio onto the Voice Track. This can be useful in correcting or adjusting the audio using filters. * (See note.)\n\nTransitions are easily created on a single track by sliding one video segment onto another, creating an automatic transition. Once created the transition may be adjusted or replaced at will.\n\nTrimming video and audio seems very simple and logical and there is a multi-trim tool that allows a single stream to be chopped into usable segments.\n\nThe inclusion of SmartSound technology (they call it \"Auto Music\") is extremely welcome allowing the rapid composition of custom length music for intros, exits, audio transitions and audio stingers. (This feature alone is probably worth the price of the package.)\n\nMost importantly, the Canon 5D MKII MOV files are supported implicitly. Import and export video are well supported with an uncommon abundance of file types, codecs/compression and wrappers.\n\nAltogether this is very impressive stuff for short format video and at a very reasonable price. ($60USD full version.) Long format video is probably better left for more advanced software, but I may try a bit of it if I purchase the software.\n\n* (Note: I found a bug in this audio splitting process. If you do much audio filtering you are much better off to split the audio from the video, delete the video track, saving the audio as a WAV file. Then create a new project and reintroduce the video/audio, split the video and audio again but this time delete the original audio track and load in the new WAV file with the filtered/corrected audio. If you try to just split the audio and video and work on the audio track with filters, the bug is that the audio track can pick up a new time-base, resulting in audio instability. Specifically, if the video is standard 29.97fps and you apply audio filters to the split audio track, the audio can become 30fps. At least that happened to me.\n\nTo be fair, I was using 2 different audio filters, from different manufacturers, so I was not totally surprised that there were problems. The work-a-round I applied was fast and worked properly.)\n\nziggy53\n\nModerator of the Cameras and Accessories forums\n\n0\n\n... BTW, I've been trolling the Corel forums, and it seems like any time someone hit issues with MOV files, the recommendation is to covert to another format.\n\nConverting the video is always an option. It does tend to lead to faster degradation of the video through re-compression.\n\nYou might want to get the utility freeware, \"GSpot\". Although it's an unusual (potentially unfortunate) name for a video utility, its purpose it to identify the codecs that a video file \"expects\" from the computer, and it helps to identify missing and broken codecs (both audio and video).\n\nBasically, you install GSpot onto your computer, run the software and drag a video file onto the GSpot window. The software reviews the video file and many times it will correctly tell you what codecs the video file needs to run and, more importantly, whether your machine has working codecs to support the video file.\n\nhttp://www.headbands.com/gspot/\n\nIf you should need to convert the file first, I used to recommend \"Super\" freeware for video conversion, but I have not gotten that to run on Windows 7 yet.\n\nI found another freeware title, \"WinFF\" which does run on Windows 7 for me and it has a simpler user interface as well. I haven't used it for anything critical yet, so I don't know how conversion quality compares at default settings but initial video impression is that the quality is pretty good at least. (It's just a front for FFMPEG so you should be able to get the same ultimate quality from it that FFMPEG can produce.)\n\nhttp://winff.org/html_new/\n\nziggy53\n\nModerator of the Cameras and Accessories forums\n\n0\n\nConverting the video is always an option. It does tend to lead to faster degradation of the video through re-compression.\n\nI thought it was the other way around... that the native video files from the 7D or 5DII should be converted to a format more suitable for editing. Have you checked out the link from Canon I posted above?\n\nI am familiar with GSpot (the software), and I've been using MPEG Streamclip on Win7 without any issues. I find it much easier to use than Super, which I've played with in the past.\n\nhttp://www.squared5.com/\n\nI had tried to convert the files (to uncompressed MOV) using MPEG Streamclip and the Avid DNxHD codec, but Corel VS crashed using those files as well. In the end I converted to MP4 and it worked fine.\n\nOn a related note, I was able to get Window Live Movie Maker to recognize the native 7D MOV files by installing the K-Lite Codec pack. This is great because there is nothing easier than WLMM for producing quick and simple videos to be streamed to the XBox.\n\nI'll experiment with the other codecs above and see if they help with Corel.\n\nBrad\n\nMy SmugMug\n\n0\n\nThe Canon linked article is mostly correct but a little misleading. Like the author of the article, Philip Bloom, I too am disappointed to see camera manufacturers using such compressive and relatively edit unfriendly codecs for video capture. Unfortunately, the last consumer codec that had discrete video frames (a video stream that did not use either inter-frame dependence and/or inter-frame compression) was the \"DV\" format which did use lossy compression per frame to achieve a constant (standard) bit rate, but it maintained discrete video frames. (Some modern digicams also use M-JPEG codecs, which are discrete frames, but they use such high compression rates that they are not considered usable for quality video.)\n\nUnfortunately MP4 is (generally using) another inter-frame compressor and will lead to transcoding/re-compression artifacts.\n\nThe article mentions the ProRes codec which is a more video edit friendly format, but not PC/Windows friendly. I am not aware of a Windows friendly, lossless codec for Windows at 1080 resolution, but for SD resolution you can use HuffYUV.\n\nAny modern video editor software that can handle the Canon MOV files has an internal decoder/encoder that writes temporary files to allow frame accurate editing and transitions. As long as the software correctly reads and translates the video file, you don't need another video format which will only degrade video quality through additional re-compression (although I agree that it may be necessary if nothing else works).\n\nziggy53\n\nModerator of the Cameras and Accessories forums\n\n0\n\nThanks so much for all this information.\n\nI am now having time to experiment with some videos I took with my 7D this year, and with my newer W7 Dell XPS, .MOV files were a pain, I couldnt figure out the codec problem, read soemthing about downloading Quicktime editing/source online software and it includes the codec. [havn't done it yet, but MovieMaker on W7 just doesn't work for the 7D movie files.]\n\nI appreciate your work on this, and you have totally answered the questions I came to type today! ;~)\n\nStarted videoing Raptor nests and although some are too light, I need to do some color editing, sizing and hopefully some improvement of byte size.\n\nI'm liking it enough to do more of it, but the added file conversions was not appealing.\n\nAnd thanks Ziggy for the codec links! Looking promising after all!\n\n0"
