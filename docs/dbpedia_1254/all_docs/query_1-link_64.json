        "text": "A video converter is an integral part of any computer software suite. Whether to convert your ripped DVD/Blu-Ray files to a universal format, compress the aforementioned DVD/Blu-Ray files or upload your vacations videos from DSLR to YouTube, you need a video converter. However, there is almost an abundance of choice of video converters on the internet. Which one do you choose? We’ve collected all the famous free video converters across the internet, ranging from the relic of the past to the bleeding edge technology havers. Though some of them aged like fine wine, some of them aged like milk.\n\nKey point: VideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate is an all-in-one converter and editor with an intuitive UI.\n\nVideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate offers functionalities such as no watermark video/ audio converter, merger, compressor, and editor on Windows and Mac. With this multi-functional editing tools, cutting, cropping and impressive special effects are all on hand to give your videos the look you want.

This easy-to-use program will help you make your video content stand out by enhancing the quality and reducing space, allowing you to save or share your videos easily.\n\nKey point: HandBrake is a consumer-level video converter and compressor for intermediate users and up.\n\nStarted as macOS-only software, HandBrake is now open source and available on all platforms. HandBrake’s unapologetically advanced settings can both be a blessing and a curse. Since there is barely anything assembled as a tutorial, the newcomers might get quickly lost if they want to explore beyond the presets. However, for the initiative, they can find HandBrake’s multitude of options refreshing. There is rarely a video converter that opens almost all of its settings for tinkering.\n\nHandBrake is an undeniably powerful tool which is a cross-platform video converter with buckets of features. If you are a straight-A student at coding course who familiar with the jargon, then congratulate you finding a powerful converter. However, if you are a newbie, maybe you can try a versatile/all-in-one with a clear and simple interface – VideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate. You will find this is the best free video converter for you if you value simplicity and seamlessness.\n\nKey point: Freemake Video Converter is a free drag and drop video converter with colorful UI and promises of unlimited conversions.\n\nFreemake Video Converter’s free version makes lots of promises, outputs up to 19 formats, has no time or file size constraints, no watermark, and can be used for batch conversions.

After that, it has been asking us to pay for it wherever we click.\n\nNotes: Some users can use Freemake Video Converter after converting one file, but instead, the watermark is added to the output file. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThere’s no getting away from the fact that as consumers, we hate feeling cheated. A recognized principle suggests that the limitations of a piece of software should be informed prior to use. Sadly, the watermark might be added to the output file with the opposite of what it claimed. But if you can live with that, you can squeeze a lot from Freemake.\n\nKey point: FFmpeg is a powerful and free video converter with command lines as its interface.\n\nAfter a complicated installing, I need to open Windows Powershell and use command lines to do actual converting. As a self-proclaimed Windows power user, it is very flexible once I get the hang of it. Whether it is corrupt frames, legacy codecs, or unreadable files, FFmpeg has them covered. However, batch conversions prevent me from utilizing it regularly. Although FFmpeg isn’t difficult to program, converting is usually more complex than VideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate.\n\nIf you are a developer and streamer who want an all-in-one video solution, FFmpeg will be highly recommended. However, due to its command line as thick as ants, it looks somewhat intimidating to many people. Compare with FFmpeg, VideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate couldn’t get much easier to finish the process of conversion with few clicks and also provides more in-built tools for your creative videos.\n\nKey point: With refreshed video/audio and picture/document functions, Format Factory is an old-school converter that shines in the new age.\n\nLike HandBrake, Format Factory is a staple of the free video converters segment. Besides the video/audio conversion, it still works as a screen recorder, video downloader, player, and even watermark remover. However, this might bug lots of privacy advocates. As if bundled bloatware isn’t enough, but if you want to use the platinum functions, you need to allow Format Factory to share your data with Bright Data. Despite its flaws, Format Factory is still a great tool to have in your media arsenal.\n\nKey point: Any Video Converter is a Swiss-knife-like video converter. It can almost do every video-related task.\n\nAny Video Converter is a one-stop-shop. You can rip your DVD, convert the files, then edit and play them, all in one interface.

However, its videos downloader only functions on particular websites.\n\nKey point: MediaCoder is another free and open-source video converter option with a wide array of settings.\n\nMediaCoder comes with all the codecs you’ll need to work on transcoding projects without any issues. Customizable audio and video encoders and filters, as well as an adjustable multiplexer, are among the many features available. Dropbox URL can even be directly added to the conversion pile. However, it has a wide range of settings but no preset formats. So, it might be difficult for new users to get into it. MediaCoder is only recommended for technophiles that know what they are doing.\n\nIn view of there no preset formats, MediaCoder is only recommended for technophiles that know what they are doing and users who want total control over their conversions. Otherwise, VideoSolo Video Converter Ultimate can be a wise alternative since it provides more than 200 preset options for popular devices such as smartphones, tablets, game consoles and online platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nKey point: Koyote Free Video Converter is a video converter with foolproof UI and batch conversion.\n\nKoyote Free Video Converter is a very old converter that is only recommended for light users. It hasn’t been updated since 2014, which means lots of new codecs aren’t supported.
