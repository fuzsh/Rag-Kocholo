        "text": "Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nAdded by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nLast updated with a comment by Michael Eskin 4 years ago.\n\nTotally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI have wanted to convert some music videos from Windows Media Video files to MPEG files, then trim them to ratio 4:3.\n\nI am feeling sortta hoodwinked by this (or maybe I’m just plain dumb when it comes to such technical matters) …\n\nI have downloaded two supposedly free converters (Prism and AVS4YOU) … but they both now say the trial has expired … WHAT FLIPPIN TRIAL? One I have used once, the other not at all … and now it seems I have to purchase the paid versions or have a watermark in the middle or such. Yikes! … I don’t want to pay … when programs like Audacity are totally totally free. Does anyone know of, and can direct me to a totally free video format converter … not one that is toted as, and pretends to be, but turns out not to be, free. Thanks.\n\n↳ Posted by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\n↳ Posted by PJ Mediterranean 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nPrograms like Audacity are ‘open source’.\n\nOpen source refers to a software movement that believes software development is best handled by the collective, that the ownership of software is a bogus concept, and that software should be free.\n\nIdeology aside, googling ‘open source video convert’ leads me to\n\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Encoders-Converter-DIVX-Related/MediaCoder.shtml\n\nWhich is exactly what you want. I’d encourage you, whenever you need a piece of software, to preface your search with ‘open source’, and you will have much better luck.\n\n↳ Posted by twitchard 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nHey twitchard, that is one of them above that I downloaded … but there’s a subscription fee: of $59 unlimited or $39 for one year … although its toted as free, when it isn’t.\n\n↳ Posted by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nThanks Pere. I’ll have to sit down to work it out, but it looks as though it might do the trick. I’ll have to see … it certainly says its totally free. We’ll see!\n\n↳ Posted by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nSorry Pere, that also leads, when you get into the blurb, to AVS4YOU and Prism … the two I’ve already downloaded. Prism says the function I want is not available on its free converter … would have to upgrade to the paid one … sigh! … and AVS4YOU is subscription unless you want a watermark in the middle of the clip … sigh! Its sounding like too much trouble and expense for something trivial … not worth the effort … maybe … unless its totally free.\n\n↳ Posted by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nHey Clear Drops, looks like Pere has you covered.\n\nJust thought I’d mention VLC media player;\n\nhttp://download.cnet.com/VLC-Media-Player/3000-13632_4-10267151.html\n\nIt has come up in past discussions.\n\nI believe it can cover quite a few conversions.\n\nI don’t have any 1st hand experience using VLC to do video conversions (so sorry) but thought you might like to know it is another possibility.\n\n↳ Posted by AB~Unbuild the Walls ~Listen to Gaza. 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI’m almost sure you are mistaken, Clear Drops. I don’t see any indication of any subscription fee anywhere. It’s hosted on sourceforge, which only hosts true, genuine, free, open source software.\n\nTry downloading it from here, maybe? Give it another try. http://mediacoder.sourceforge.net/index.htm\n\n↳ Posted by twitchard 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nWindows Movie Maker is free, and if you’re running XP or higher it is probably already installed on your computer. You can import different clip formats and splice them together. However, I have never really used the program and don’t know if it’s possible to change the aspect ratios like you want.\n\n↳ Posted 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nRandom_notes, you’re right that VLC can do conversions, but I’ve never had much success with it. However, it’s a great media player and can cope with HD, FLV and others.\n\n↳ Posted by Mark Harmer 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nHave you tried handbrake? (just google that)\n\n↳ Posted by samburnstone 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI’ve had great luck with Kate’s Video Converter http://download.cnet.com/Kate-s-Video-Converter-Free/3000-2194_4-10637928.html\n\n↳ Posted by RogueFiddler 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI’ve had a lot of good results with Any Video Converter:\n\nhttp://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for_video_free/\n\nThey’ve got a free version that works very well, and a professional version with even more features….\n\n↳ Posted by KeepFiddlin' 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI’ve been using the extremely versatile and free “Super ©” for a long time now with no problems. The current version is Super © v2009.build.35 which you can get from http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html\n\nThe interface is very straightforward, which presumably retains the speed which you could lose from a full GUI. To use Super ©most effectively may require a modicum of geekiness - but then thesession.org isn’t exactly lacking for geek gods and goddesses (ahem!).\n\n↳ Posted by fidicen 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI thought you didn’t have to download anything on my link. It’s an online converter.\n\n↳ Posted by PJ Mediterranean 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nPere, you are correct ~ it is an online converter.\n\nAt the same time AVS video converter plasters their ad (& download button) everywhere they possibly can.\n\nI clicked on the online media converter just now.\n\nIt is there just like you said.\n\n↳ Posted by AB~Unbuild the Walls ~Listen to Gaza. 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nSuper from erightsoft and Virtualdub for editing\n\n↳ Posted by mactavish 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nYes Virginia there is a software Santa Claus\n\nYou might want to check out this site that consistently done good reviews of free software. http://www.techsupportalert.com/\n\nFor Video converters see his page\n\nhttp://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-audio-video-format-conversion-program.htm\n\nbest\n\nLiam\n\n↳ Posted by billiamconkey 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nWinFF is free, and small. It does a handful of useful conversions of audio and video (including .flv if you have a grabber) but you’ll have to get something else if you want to edit the content.\n\n↳ Posted by gravelwalks 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nThank you everyone … now I just need time to fiddle with them and see what works best fer me … and my holiday is over … sigh!\n\n↳ Posted by Clear Drops 15 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\niWisoft Free Video Converter can fast convert videos between all popular formats like AVI, MPEG, WMV, DivX, XviD, MP4, H.264/AVC, AVCHD, FLV, MKV, RM, MOV, 3GP, and audio MP3, WMA, WAV, RA, M4A, AAC, AC3, OGG.

So, I used various video converter, I think any video converter and leawo video converter are the best ones, for any video converter is very easy to use, and leawo video converter has a good convert speed with high quality. I use them both.\n\n[url=http://www.leawo.com/leawo-video-converter/]http://www.leawo.com/leawo-video-converter/[/url]\n\n↳ Posted by kerryzeng 14 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nleawo video converter, http://www.leawo.com/leawo-video-converter/\n\n↳ Posted by kerryzeng 14 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nI have the same experience with you. It’s very hard to find a totally free software and it is good. Finally, I gave up. I bought one which I thought is OK. There is one thing free one will not have is that you can get technical support from the purchased one.\n\n↳ Posted by howardhaines98 13 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nCheck this site:\n\nhttp://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/top-5-free-video-converters.html Top 5 Completely Free Video Converters with lots of useful functions and they all free :D\n\n↳ Posted by summers 9 years ago.\n\nRe: Totally free video format converters … is there any such thing?\n\nHey, as for this, here I’d like to share another tool with you.
