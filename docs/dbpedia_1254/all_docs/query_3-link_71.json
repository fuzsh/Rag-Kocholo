        "text": "jdx256,\n\nThe easiest way to get videos into pretty much any high-end video editing suite is to load it into VirtualDub and then export it as RAW format (warning - huge files!)\n\nMany new editors are accepting MP4 h.264 encoded videos, but not all. A converter like MediaCoder FLV edition will batch-encode a folder (change the drop-down to MP4 and be certain to make the MP4 settings be baseline for Windows Media Player to see them).\n\nWindows Media Player certainly CAN play Microsoft Video 1 encoded files, but MSV1 sucks, so use anything else! Google Jawor's Xvid and use the 32 bit version of that for nicely compressed vids that you can then save as RAW for your editor as described above or convert to to WMV using something like Any Video Converter for use in Windows Movie Maker.\n\nWatch the videos I made in the playlist mentioned up top there (or the 2-hour webinar) to see what the best settings would be for many applications. Xvid is best for game recordings, but also excels at capturing webinars and tutorials.\n\nTerry\n\nIt's so frustrating that in 2011 it's still a nightmare to do something as common as take a video\n\nMy problem seems to be I don't have a decent (working) encoder codec. CAM refuses to record using \"DivX 6.9.2 Codec (4 Logical CPUs)\" and if I record using MSV1, then VirtualDub won't convert to that format (recording 400x400x32bit).\n\nI'll look up the Xvid one you mention. Also, are there any encoders which will spit out FLV files directly?"
