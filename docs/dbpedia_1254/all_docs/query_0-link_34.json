        "text": "Hi all,\n\nRecently, when attempting to convert an MPEG-2 file with SMC, a popup window stated that I needed to download QT from the following web page - - Blu Ray & DVD Player for Windows - WinDVD Pro 12 by Corel\n\nAfter this web page launches, it is redirected to Apple and QT 7.6 where I started downloading to my PC. Then I thought that maybe I should be downloading my e260, so I canceled the download and used a copy of a recent download, QuickTime Player 7.55.90.70 in its place.\n\nI know, 7.6 is fully of patches, fixes and other goodies, but, hey, I am 56K here, so we’re talking about a 75 minute download. Who could blame me, particularly given all the e260 challenges that I have dealt with thus far. So I thought why not try what I have and if it works, as it is supposed to, then I could consider tolerating the QT 7.6 and its 75 minute download.\n\nBack to my initial install . . . I am not 100% certain that it was done by the book - the Sansa book. No, not the manual - it says absolutely NOTHING in this regard. After completing the install, I used SMC to convert an mp4 file and the result was not good. The resultant .mov files had audio-video sync problems. This AV problem has not been resolved and is now on the back burner as I try to resolve an Info reported FREE memory problem. Regarding this memory problem, one valued member suggested that I reformat my e260. Of course, when I did, I lost all QT files and related directories. That was okay because I still had not resolved the audio-video sync problem.\n\nI just finished manually scrubbing my Registry of all traces of QT and am ready to give QT another install. However, before I do, and without disclosing the procedure that I initially used, to avoid biasing everyone, I thought that I should ask around and see if there is a link at this forum that specifically addresses the install correct install procedure.\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions and or recommendations.\n\nCurlySue\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-08-2009 07:30 AM\n\nThanks for clarifying that I did install this particular software in the correct manner, Tapeworm. Of course, this also means that I am going to have to dive deeper into the AV sync problem.\n\nThank you (as alwasys) for your suggestion, neutron_bob. I will find that software and give it a try.\n\nAccording to my Sansa e200 (e200 UG_rev3_july06_AM.doc) User Guide, supported IMPORT media types include:\n\nStill Image Files: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF\n\nVideo Files: AVI, MPEG-1 & MPEG-2 in MPEG, MPG, MPE or VOB (unprotected) formats. MPEG-4 in\n\nAVI format, DAT, ASF, QuickTime MOV, and WMV. Please Note: QuickTime 6.5 or higher and Windows\n\nMedia Player 9 or 10.0 are required for QuickTime MOV file. Error message will appear if not installed.\n\nI have many VOB files that are fully “unprotected” but SMC refuses to acknowledge them. For example, VTS_01_1.VOB is a fully unprotected VOB file, but SMC’s Add Media Files does NOT recognize VOB files.\n\nIt would be nice if SMC would do what SanDisk states it does - converting VOB files would save me a lot of time.\n\nI think its time to search for VOB threads, and if none exist (with respect to SMC) I will start a new one!\n\nThanks again, guys!\n\nCurlySue\n\nADDENDUM\n\nWhat happened to the ability to convert .VOB files?\n\nhttp://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/board/message?board.id=smc&message.id=1461&query.id=535374#M1461\n\nBuild 4.236 may be a solution. I am downloading it as I type, and shall report my SMC 4.236 results soon.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI am pleased to report that SMC 4.236 does recognize VOB files. However, at this time, I cannot confirm if it does so without errors, artifacts or audio-video sync problems. More to follow soon.\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-09-2009 04:57 AM\n\nHello again, neutron_bob!\n\nWell, I found one CCCP here - - http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Combined_Community_Codec_Pack.htm\n\nIt states that this Combined Community Codec Pack ( CCCP ) includes:\n\n- FFDShow 2008-09-17 r2133\n\n- FLV Splitter r796\n\n- Haali Media Splitter 2008-03-29\n\n- MPV (Mpeg2) Decoder r796 CCCP\n\n- VSFilter 2.39 r796\n\n- CoreWavPack 1.1.1\n\n- Media Player Classic Homecinema 1.1.796\n\n- ZoomPlayer 5.5 beta 1\n\nI have another Codec Pack, K-Lite 4.7.0, Full version, installed on my PC, and want to comment on this CCCP’s components (noted above) as follows:\n\n- FFDShow 2008-09-17 r2133 [appears antiquated, K-Lite 4.7.0 FFDShow, r2732]\n\n- FLV Splitter r796 [and here, K-Lite 4.7.0 may lag behind with its FLV Splitter (Gabest) - 1.0.0.5]\n\n- Haali Media Splitter 2008-03-29 [and if date matches version, K-Lite 4.7.0 Haali Media Splitter - 1.8.122.18]\n\n- MPV (Mpeg2) Decoder r796 CCCP [would THIS be the PRIMARY focus of your suggestion, neutron_bob?]\n\n- VSFilter 2.39 r796 [may be the same, K-Lite 4.7.0 includes DirectVobSub (a.k.a. VSFilter) - 2.39.5.1]\n\n- CoreWavPack 1.1.1 [same as K-Lite 4.7.0]\n\n- Media Player Classic Homecinema 1.1.796 [again, antiquated, K-Lite 4.7.0 Media Player Classic Home Cinema - 1.2.1005.0]\n\n- ZoomPlayer 5.5 beta 1 [and given the Sansa 260 v1 problems that I have endured, there will be no beta trial for me]\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCurlySue\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-08-2009 09:19 PM\n\nSMC 4.236 has difficulty converting multiple VOB files when 2 or more VOB files exceed 1GB, or 1,024,574 KB in size.\n\nTRIAL # 1\n\nUsing “Add Media” added four VOB files, 3 of which were 1,024,574 KB, and the last 570,846 KB.\n\nSMC 4.236 converted the first VOB to two (2) .mov files, VTS_01_1-CE78-01.mov at 229,647 KB and VTS_01_1-CE78-02.mov at 40,047 KB.\n\nThen, at about 40% thru the second VOB, SMC 4.236 failed and generated the following ERROR . . .\n\nEvent Type: Error\n\nEvent Source: Application Error\n\nEvent Category: None\n\nEvent ID: 1000\n\nDate: 3/9/2009\n\nTime: 7:22:08 AM\n\nUser: N/A\n\nComputer: CURLYSUE\n\nDescription: Faulting application sansa media converter.exe, version 0.0.0.0,\n\nfaulting module unknown, version 0.0.0.0, fault address 0x0a59c740.\n\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\n\nData:\n\n0000: 41 70 70 6c 69 63 61 74 Applicat\n\n0008: 69 6f 6e 20 46 61 69 6c ion Fail\n\n0010: 75 72 65 20 20 73 61 6e ure san\n\n0018: 73 61 20 6d 65 64 69 61 sa media\n\n0020: 20 63 6f 6e 76 65 72 74 convert\n\n0028: 65 72 2e 65 78 65 20 30 er.exe 0\n\n0030: 2e 30 2e 30 2e 30 20 69 .0.0.0 i\n\n0038: 6e 20 75 6e 6b 6e 6f 77 n unknow\n\n0040: 6e 20 30 2e 30 2e 30 2e n 0.0.0.\n\n0048: 30 20 61 74 20 6f 66 66 0 at off\n\n0050: 73 65 74 20 30 61 35 39 set 0a59\n\n0058: 63 37 34 30 0d 0a c740…\n\nTRIAL # 2\n\nClosed SMC, disconnected Sansa e260 v1, deleted the two recently converted .mov files, and rebooted my PC.\n\nUsing “Add Media” added the same four VOB files, 3 of which were 1,024,574 KB, and the last 570,846 KB.\n\nSMC 4.236 converted the first VOB to two (2) .mov files, VTS_01_1-CE78-01.mov at 229,647 KB and VTS_01_1-CE78-02.mov at 40,047 KB.\n\nThen, at about 41% thru the second VOB, SMC 4.236 failed and generated the following ERROR . . .\n\nEvent Type: Error\n\nEvent Source: Application Error\n\nEvent Category: None\n\nEvent ID: 1000\n\nDate: 3/9/2009\n\nTime: 7:31:02 AM\n\nUser: N/A\n\nComputer: CURLYSUE\n\nDescription: Faulting application sansa media converter.exe, version 0.0.0.0,\n\nfaulting module unknown, version 0.0.0.0, fault address 0x0a59c740.\n\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\n\nData:\n\n0000: 41 70 70 6c 69 63 61 74 Applicat\n\n0008: 69 6f 6e 20 46 61 69 6c ion Fail\n\n0010: 75 72 65 20 20 73 61 6e ure san\n\n0018: 73 61 20 6d 65 64 69 61 sa media\n\n0020: 20 63 6f 6e 76 65 72 74 convert\n\n0028: 65 72 2e 65 78 65 20 30 er.exe 0\n\n0030: 2e 30 2e 30 2e 30 20 69 .0.0.0 i\n\n0038: 6e 20 75 6e 6b 6e 6f 77 n unknow\n\n0040: 6e 20 30 2e 30 2e 30 2e n 0.0.0.\n\n0048: 30 20 61 74 20 6f 66 66 0 at off\n\n0050: 73 65 74 20 30 61 35 39 set 0a59\n\n0058: 63 37 34 30 0d 0a c740…\n\nINTERIM CONCLUSION\n\nAt this point, I really did not know what to think, but it did seem reasonable to conclude that this type or category of PROBLEM may be one of the many of the reasons SanDisk chose to exclude VOB conversion from SMC Build 4.256\n\nTRIAL # 3\n\nClosed SMC, disconnected Sansa e260 v1, did NOT delete the two recently converted .mov files, and rebooted my PC.\n\nUsing “Add Media” added the 2nd VOB file, 2 of 4, also 1,024,574 KB\n\nSMC 4.236 converted this VOB to two (2) .mov files, VTS_01_2-CE78-01.mov at 221,157 KB and VTS_01_2-CE78-02.mov at 66,500 KB\n\nNext, using “Add Media” added the 3rd VOB file, 3 of 4, also 1,024,574 KB\n\nSMC 4.236 converted this VOB to two (2) .mov files, VTS_01_3-CE78-01.mov at 232,743 KB and VTS_01_3-CE78-02.mov at 58,353 KB\n\nLast, using “Add Media” added the 4th VOB file, 4 of 4, at 570,846 KB\n\nSMC 4.236 converted this VOB to one (1) .mov file, VTS_01_4-CE78-01.mov at 155,217 KB\n\nPRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS\n\n- SMC 4.236 cannot handle multiple VOB conversions when 2 or more VOB files exceed 1GB, or 1,024,574 KB in size.\n\n- As a workaround, SMC 4.236 converts single VOB files at 1GB, or 1,024,574 KB in size. Unfortunately, when converting single VOB files that are part of the same group of VOB files (two or more), the converted .mov files do not play as one contiguous (movie) file.\n\n- This may only be a problem with my e260 v1 player, but each converted .mov has audio-video sync problems. In this example, the audio signal leads video by 2 seconds or more.\n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS\n\n- SMC 4.236 may convert VOB files to Sansa e260 v1, but does not convert more than one file at a time.\n\n- SMC 4.236 converts with audio and video signals that are out of sync with one another.\n\n- SMC 4.236 fails at converting VOB to Sansa e260 v1 and in this regard, SMC 4.236 is no better than SMC 4.256 as it failed to convert an MP4 file - also had audio-video sync problems.\n\nUNDISPUTED FACTS\n\nThe product literature clearly states: Supported IMPORT media types\n\nVideo Files: AVI, MPEG-1 & MPEG-2 in MPEG, MPG, MPE or VOB (unprotected) formats.\n\nSMC 4.256 does accept VOB files, and for my Sans e260 v1, SMC 4.236 does not handle multiple VOB files at 1GB each.\n\nSMC 4.256 converts a MP4 files, but for my Sans e260 v1, it does so with audio and video growing every more out of sync.\n\nSMC 4.236 converts single VOB files, but for my Sans e260 v1, does so with audio and video growing every more out of sync.\n\nDISGUSTED\n\nI cannot remember the last time that I had so many fricken problems with a single piece of electronics.\n\nWhat a JOKE has SanDisk pulled on consumers!\n\nCurlySue\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-09-2009 11:36 AM\n\nHi again, Brian!\n\nWell, it looks like a GREAT site and there sure are a lot of members.\n\nI was VERY HAPPY to read that Gibbo helped resolve your TVC settings and that it now works for you!\n\nUnfortunately, as I see it, according to the following…\n\nTotal Video Converter supports reading the following file formats:\n\nConvert from Real Video Rmvb (.rm,.rmvb)\n\nConvert from MPEG4 (.mp4)\n\nConvert from 3gp (.3gp, 3g2)\n\nConvert from Game Psp (.psp)\n\nConvert from MPEG1 (.mpg, mpeg)\n\nConvert from MPEG2 PS (.mpg, mpeg, vob)\n\nConvert from MPEG2 TS (DVB Transport Stream)\n\nConvert from DIVX (.divx)\n\nConvert from Ms ASF (.asf, .wmv)\n\nConvert from Ms ASF (.asf, .wmv)\n\nConvert from Ms AVI (.avi)\n\nConvert from Macromedia Flash video FLV (.flv)\n\nConvert from Apple Quicktime (.mov)\n\nConvert from FLIC format (.fli, .flc)\n\nConvert from Gif Animation (.gif)\n\nConvert from DV (.dv)\n\nConvert from Matroska (.mkv)\n\nConvert from ogm (.ogm)\n\nConvert from Video Formats Dx9 Directshow can open\n\n…TVC will not work for me - it does not appear to do VOB conversions.\n\nMy PRIMARY OBJECTIVE requires SINGLE conversion from VOB to whatever the Sansa e260 v1 will play without audio-video sync problems - and no other problems, of course. In addition, I paid $42 for my brand new e260 (not refurb) and TVC asks 40.96 USD. I will not pay $41 for software that does not convert VOB files. I already have Nero 7 Ultra and it converts VOB to Nero Digital MP4, and does so perfectly. Unfortuanately, as noted in one of my previous postings, SMC corrupts it up with audio-video sync problems.\n\nUnlike others, I am not interesting in MULTIPLE conversions to achieve my objective. I simply is not worth it. SanDisk has FRAUDULENTLY represented this player’s capability, in my opinion, and I am about to take those MFs to task.\n\nThanks again, Brian, but it looks like I am no better off today than I was yesterday.\n\nCurlySue\n\nCurlySue-\n\nSorry I have been away from this particular (SMC) forum in a few days, as there’s been quite a bit of traffic in the other forums lately.\n\nYes, I have had great results trying to resurrect troublesome VOB files, after decrypting, onto the Sansa. I use the AnyVideoConverter application, and found that the single chapter (VOB file) out of a complete DVD that otherwise plays the other files, works- when “massaged” to MPEG-2 via AVC, then I run this file through the SMC separately.\n\nUsing the SMC, I change the label of this chapter with an MPEG-2 note.\n\nI found that the AVC application looked like it was hanging up the first time around. I went to grab a fresh cup of coffee, and noticed that the application hadn’t hung up at all! The interface displayed the message “performing layer 2” or something similar. Next time she’s up, I’ll make a note.\n\nI found this method by trial and error, and the requisite codec is most likely from CCCP as you see. Unfortunately, I am transferring for the v2 and Fuze at the moment, as I don’t have a v1 on the bench. These devices have the AS3525 platform, not the PortalPlayer / NVIDIA device, so the final format is different.\n\nThe new devices support video better than the v1, allowing video on the µSD card, but you have the advantage of trying Rockbox and WinFF too.\n\nTo decrease the time lag over the file, I prefer to leave the individual (30-minute) files as the final version, as scanning through the smaller files is easier on the v2. With the Fuze, SanDisk improved things radically for video, giving us a new GUI, the volume bar pops up over the video, and a dual mode scan: single taps of the FF / REW zip +/- 30 seconds, or holding the button sweeps through the video.\n\nAlso new is a Video Bookmarks function.\n\nNow if only we could solve the lag issue ( I have typically less than 500ms delay with video), I’d be a happy camper. The quest continues.\n\nPlaying with video / Rockbox is why I’d like to get another v1.\n\nBob :smileyvery-happy:\n\nMessage Edited by neutron_bob on 03-15-2009 12:18 PM\n\n**\n\nHi ya, neutron_bob!\n\nGREAT to hear from you again!!

Unfortunately, my Sansa is DOA and therefore I have not had an opportunity to use SMC to convert the Handbrake or MediaCoder files to the e260.\n\nI ordered another and will send the DOA back under an RMA for a full refund. Hey, maybe I will get lucky and get an e260 v2 this time.\n\nOn a related note, one of my clients recently informed me that his firm purchased over a hundred e260 players and that he has SanDisk Customer Support doing back flips regarding the VOB issue. Apparently, they tried converting multiple VOB files with SMC and failed. As a result, the case has been escalated from Level 2 Support to Corporate Engineering. I bet him $100 that Corporate Engineering would not resolve the problem (due to incompetence, intentionally or otherwise) within 3 months. I am so confident, that I gave him 2:1 odds. Any other takers?\n\nAgain, it was very nice to hear from you, neutron_bob.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCurlySue\n\n**\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-15-2009 08:14 PM\n\nI have had excellent results copying directly from DVD – only non-encrypted, i.e., time-shifted movies from television, or older movies and TV shows from the Walmart “five dollar bin” (a LOT of commercial DVDs are NOT encrypted) – using an ANCIENT version of Itunes (ver. 4.7.1) – so old that it doesn’t have video support, since it pre-dates video Ipods (it has just enough QTstuff in it to provide “visualizations” of music, ugh), and, the OLD SMC (Arcsoft version).\n\nWhat’s more, I’m using it on Windows 2000, theoretically impossible to do, since the player cannot be recognized by the SMC on a pre-XP version of Windows. (I have to ignore the error messages, let it do its thing, and then manually drag/drop the files it’s made from its directory into my Sansa. It also crashes with an error message when I close it after I’m done with it, c’est la vie.)\n\nBut, it works! I have NO problem with multiple VOBs, NO problems with losing audio synch… all I can figure is that the secret to my success is the OLD version of Quicktime.\n\nI believe that you can still download the Arcsoft type SMC, and, I know that there are websites with “historical” archives of various freeware/shareware apps, pretty much every version ever made, where I think you’d be able to find the older Quicktime download. I don’t have any links handy but I’d imagine a web search would be able to find it for you.\n\nBTW I’ve seen people posting “optimized” config files for that version SMC, which allow you to use ALL the pixels on the LCD, but having tried them, I would advise against. It’s entirely subjective – I didn’t do any time comparisons or really scrutinize the display – but it seemed to me that the conversion took longer, and the display wasn’t as crisp.\n\nThe standard output from the SMC, which does NOT fill the screen flush to the borders (you lose a few pixels at the edge) is a ratio that is a good/easy fraction of the standard NTSC format (480 scan lines). When you fill out the last few pixels, you lose the ability to do a simple “clean” division of the 480 lines – the software has to reinterpolate the whole thing – it has to totally re-rasterize EVERY frame – sort of like going from PAL to NTSC – and it’s inevitable that there’ll be some loss of quality as well as a LOT more processing overhead. (It’s one thing to tell the program to “take every third line” (or even, \"create one new line by averaging the content of the three original lines) – but it’s an entirely different kettle of fish when NONE of the original lines can be used, and EVERY line has to be built from scratch by interpolating a VARYING number of proximate lines.)\n\nThat is GREAT to hear, PickMorel.\n\nUnfortunately, I am Windows XP SP2 and prefer not reverting to Windows 2000 (even in a virtual mode) to resolve this problem. However, I sincerely appreciate your optimism, resolve and success on the issue.\n\n“… “optimized” config files for that version SMC, which allow you to use ALL the pixels on the LCD,” sound QUITE INTERESTING and MUST reading. Have you saved any of the URLs associated with these postings? If so…\n\n“The standard output from the SMC…” WOW, PickMorel, your knowledge clearly exceeds mine by a few quantum leaps. I suppose that the “re-rasterize” process may also contribute to this AV sync problem that I have experienced (as well as my client’s firm and their 100+ e260 v1 players).\n\nI recognize that my perspective is likely flawed, but what about other programs like Handbrake and MediaCoder that can manipulate aspect ratio and screen resolution… if given a 220 x 176 (or similar) AVI file, SMC will still re-rasterize. True?\n\nThanks again for sharing your success with your Sansa, PickMorel.\n\nCurlySue\n\nMessage Edited by CurlySue on 03-16-2009 05:54 AM"
