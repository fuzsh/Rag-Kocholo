        "text": "Introduction\n\nLet's first present a few definitions, taken from various Wikipedia articles.\n\n“Video editing is the process of re-arranging or modifying segments of video to form another piece of video. The goals of video editing are the same as in film editing - the removal of unwanted footage, the isolation of desired footage, and the arrangement of footage in time to synthesize a new piece of footage.” (Video editing, retrieved 16:46, 2 April 2007 (MEST))\n\n“Video capture is the process of converting an analog video signal—such as that produced by a video camera or DVD player—to digital video. The resulting digital data are computer files referred to as a digital video stream, or more often, simply video stream. This is in contrast with screencasting, in which previously digitized video is captured while displayed on a digital monitor. TV tuner cards have a television tuner with the capabilities to capture broadcast television.” (Video capture, retrieved April 22 2012.)\n\n“Video converters are computer programs that can change the storage format of digital video in a process called transcoding.” Comparison of video converters, retrieved April 22, 2012).\n\n“A screencast is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration. The term screencast compares with the related term screenshot; whereas screenshot is a picture of a computer screen, a screencast is essentially a movie of the changes over time that a user sees on a computer screen, enhanced with audio narration.” (Wikipedia, retrieved April 2012)\n\nThis article so far just includes a few software links.

Also includes a \"wizard\". Most simple to use (compared to the others) Complex software Fairly easy to use. From the little testing I did, I liked this one best in terms of easy/power ratio. Very simple Problems Most everything is done with a filter who must be attached to an object. Understanding filters requires reading Icons, ribbons and text do not display well on a 4K screen with big fonts.
