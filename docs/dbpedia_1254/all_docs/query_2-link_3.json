        "text": "VirtualDub comes to mind. I use that one to turn video's 90 degrees.\n\nI think also SUPER can be used for this.\n\nEdit: As for your question concerning file size or quality loss. This totally depends on what codec you re-encode to and with which parameters. You can use gspot to see most of the parameters of the original file, and if you specify everything the same (except for the aspect ratio of course) the file size shouldn't be much different and there shouldn't be no quality loss. If the source file is e.g. an mpeg-1 file, then you can re-encode it to mpeg-4 and make the file much smaller while maintaining the same quality (all depends on parameters of the re-encoder of course).\n\nSome software players have the ability to do such scaling in the player itself. Of course, this also means that you have to fix it every time you play the video, and other people you give the file to don't see the video correctly.\n\nTo fix it correctly, the best way would be to modify the Display Aspect Ratio of the video itself if possible. Some containers/codecs should allow for this without having to re-encode. This discussion goes over modifying MP4 videos. You might be able to use mkvtoolnix to do the same thing with Matroska (.mkv) files."
