Having trouble keeping it on my user page\n\nEditing videos with avidemux:\n\nTo remove audio:\n\nOpen avidemux\n\nDrag and drop the file into avidemux\n\nIf the following shows up because the video is h.264 (h.264 is the best right now):\n\nPress either (no is better unless the program crashes).\n\nSelect Audio -> Main Track\n\nSelect Audio Source -> None\n\nMake sure that Video and Audio are on \"Copy\".\n\nIf you want to instead re-encode the file, then choose \"MPEG-4 AVC\" to pick h.264. Note that\n\nmm201 wrote:\n\nh.264 lags single-core machines like crazy and shouldn't be used.\n\nI do not agree with this, as we have a video toggle, and this isn't 2005. If you want to support ancient PCs, then use h.263 or Xvid.\n\nTo resize the image, click on \"filters\" and \"MPlayer resize\" then input how much you want to resize. Most of the time you should keep this at 800x600 or 853x480 (though I use 800x450 for widescreen).\n\nTo actually reduce the filesize of the video, there are a few options, all of which are in the \"configure\" menu:\n\nThe correct way is to use a constant rate factor (usually between 30-36) since single pass encodes are of higher quality. You can also use a 2 pass encode which will set the video size (I suggest ~7 MB) or Average bitrate (I suggest 400-800 kbps).\n\nAvidemux doesn't like saving h.264 flv files, but works fine with avi files. Since osu plays both just fine (and avi is slightly smaller than flv), save the file as an avi.\n\nPress ctrl+S to save the file somewhere, then copy it into your folder.\n\nIf avidemux does not open your file correctly, there are alternatives: Mediacoder is a bit more difficult to use, but might work, and can save h.264 flv files. SUPER isn't very good, hard to find, but is another program that might be worthwhile, if you can find the download on the website. Finally, VLC can be used, but that should be avoided at all costs.\n\nThe reason I like avidemux is because you can easily edit each frame, and it has a good interface, unlike mediacoder (which has greater compatibility). I've never been able to get virtualdub to work properly.\n\nI guess I need some help. I had a .mp4 with b-frames in it, and when I tried to use to use virtualdub to convert it into a .avi, I would get block artifacts. I am not sure if this is because it is just this .mp4 or it is a general problem (will check at another time), but I was wondering if anyone else encountered a similar problem. (To note: Got around this by first encoding the .mp4 into .avi using ffv1 codec (lossless, or close enough) in SUPER, and then plugging that into avidemux)\n\nAlso if anyone wants to improve the quality of their video, http://www.avidemux.org/admWiki/doku.ph ... rial:h.264 provides a fantastic guide if you are willing to read a lot of it."
