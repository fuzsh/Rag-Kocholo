        "text": "What is a video transcoder? A video transcoder is a desktop-based program developed to decode a compressed video into an intermedia uncompressed format and then re-encode it into another format.\n\nThe transcoding process might involve changes in the codec, GOP length, bitrate, resolution, sample rate, frame rate, and a few other properties. To put it simply, the goal of a video transcoder is to change a video from one encoding format to another for shrinking the file size or making the material easier to share, play, or edit.\n\nHowever, which video transcoder should you pick among a raft of free and open-source video transcoders in the market? Keep reading. We've compiled a list of the best free & open source video transcoders for Windows.\n\nBest Free Video Transcoder for Windows\n\n# VideoProc Converter AI\n\nVideoProc Converter AI is the best free video transcoders around.

Most of them take no charges, support prevalent formats, and let users customize the settings of the resolution, bitrate, audio channels, and a plethora of other parameters.\n\n# HandBrake\n\nHandBrake is one of the top-rated open source video transcoders for Windows, Mac, and Linux. With it, you can rip DVDs into digital media format as well as quickly transcode videos for sharing on Discord, YouTube, and other major platforms.\n\nOne of the biggest cons of HandBrake is it only lets you output video files in MP4, MKV, and WebM. As for the output video or audio codec, this free video transcoder doesn't leave you many choices.\n\nIt supports only H.265, H.264, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, Theora, VP8, and VP9. Thus, if you want to transcode video to CineForm, Apple ProRes, or other lossless formats for editing on Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, HandBrake isn't for you. You can use Handbrake alternatives for those purpose.\n\nHow to Transcode Video Using HandBrake\n\nStep 1. Go to the official site of HandBrake to download and install it on your Windows or Mac computer.\n\nStep 2. Drag and drop the source video file onto this open source video transcoder.\n\nStep 3. Go to the Format menu under the Summary tab and choose the specific container format.\n\nStep 3. Hit Dimensions and change the value of Width and Length to customize the resolution.\n\nStep 4. Hit Video or Audio to find the controls settings for the output video or audio codec.\n\nStep 5. Click on Save and choose the output folder.\n\nStep 6.

It's also a reliable free video transcoder that lets you change the encoding formats of your video files from the popular ones like H.264, MPEG4, VP8, MP4, MKV, or into another. It lets users configure the video encoding settings.\n\nHowever, we don't recommend you to make customize adjustments because VLC provides no preset options. For example, we can't choose 120FPS, 60FPS, or 30FPS as the target frame rate and 1920 x 1080P or 1920 x 1200 as the target resolution directly.\n\nHow to Transcode Video Using VLC\n\nStep 1. Launch up VLC, hit Media, and choose Convert/Save.\n\nStep 2. Click on +Add and choose the source video file that you want to transcode.\n\nStep 3.

If necessary, click on the gear icon to get the options for adjusting the container format, video codec, audio codec, frame rate, sample rate, and more properties.\n\nStep 5. Click on Browse and choose the output location.\n\nStep 6. Hit Start to start to transcode video via VLC.\n\n# FFmpeg\n\nFFMPEG is a free and open-source command tool that collects a set of libraries and toolkits for transcoding, recording and streaming multimedia content. It can handle virtually all video and audio formats, including Theora, Cinepak, and QuickTime Animation.\n\nMoreover, FFmpeg users have maximum freedom to decide the codec, size, and quality of the result file. Whether you want to transcode a variable frame rate video to a different format with a constant frame rate or you need to turn a lossy video into a lossless format, FFMPEG can get things done.\n\nSadly, the absence of the regular GUI makes FFmpeg too complex for beginners to start with.\n\nHow to Transcode Video Using FFmpeg\n\nStep 1. Download FFmpeg Windows's package, extract the ffmpeg.exe file and copy the unzipping files.\n\nStep 2. Create a new folder named FFmpeg under your system directory. Paste the unzipping files onto this new folder.\n\nStep 3. Press Windows and S on the keyboard, input system variable on the search bar, and click Edit the system environment variables in the search results.\n\nStep 4. Hit Environment variables on the bottom right. On the pop-up new panel, click on Path under the Users variables for the PC section.\n\nStep 5.

After that, use the given options to make adjustments as you need.\n\nStep 5.

Many users call it the \"HandBrake Plus\". Its UI is very similar to HandBrake and VidCoder but it boats more features and supports more video formats.\n\nYou're allowed to transcode video from almost all known formats to any of the 100+ formats supported by Xmedia Recode, including H.264, H.265, M4V, MKV, MMF, (S)VCD, SWF, and WMA.

Launch up the video transcoder, hit Open File, and then select the source video that you want to transcode to import to the program.\n\nStep 3. Go to the Format section, find the desired output format among the drop-down list of the Format menu, and select it.\n\nStep 4. Click on Video to navigate yourself to a new section. Herein, you can customize the video profile like the video codec, rate control mode, encoding profile, and frame rate.\n\nStep 5. Click on Audio to find the options to further customize the audio profile, such as audio codec, object type, channel, and sample rate.\n\nStep 6. Go to the upper part, choose Add to Queue, and then hit Encode. Xmedia Recode starts to transcode video on Windows.\n\n# WinFF\n\nIf you need a simple video transcoder that is very basic to use, then this might be a good option. WinFF is a GUI frontend for the FFmpeg project available for Windows XP/7/8/10 and Linux. It offers some presets that can help beginners quickly transcode video to WMV, MPEG4, and several other video formats.\n\nTech-savvy or experienced users?

Hit Add and select the original video file that you want to transcode onto this free and open source video transcoder.\n\nStep 2. Go to the Convert To menu, hit the drop-down icon, and then select the desired output formats or the video playback devices/platforms.\n\nStep 3. Hit Convert to enable this free video transcoder to start processing your video.\n\n# MediaCoder\n\nMediaCoder is less-known than other free and open source video transcoders listed in this post, but it's absolutely one of the most powerful ones in the market.\n\nIt lets you transcode between plenty of old and fresh video and audio formats, such as VP8, VP9, H.264, H.265, PCM, Huffyuv, Vorbis, and mp3Pro. It doesn't offer many ready-made profiles for popular devices like the majority of other video transcoders do. However, this is not a big deal for advanced users as it lets you take full control of the transcoding. You can change the bitrate, rate mode, bitrate rate mode, encoding level, and a plethora of other things.\n\nMoreover, it comes with the denoise, deshake, de-logo, crop, rotate, and many other useful video filters for helping you quickly improve the video file. The downsides? It may take a while to learn and get used to since its UI is cluttered with a raft of unexplained jargon. The free version of MediaCoder doesn't let you output video above 1080P.\n\nHow to Transcode Video Using MediaCoder\n\nStep 1. Go to the official site of MediaCoder. Download and install the latest version of it on Windows.\n\nStep 2. Fire up this free video transcoder, hit Add, and then select the source video file for adding to the program.\n\nStep 3.
