The only contents on the CD is one .lwx file. I was unable to open or convert the file for the investigator to view. I contacted a manger from the toy store whom indicated, the store uses Variant DVR for their recording with an integrated application. I attempted to locate the company site for Variant DVR to download a viewer but was unsuccessful.\n\nAny help on how to open or convert .lwx file to view content of the file is greatly appreciated.\n\nYou may have to install their proprietary codec found here\n\nhttp://www.verint.com/codec-download/\n\nAnd then convert it with something like VLC\n\nJim4232,\n\nYes, you are correct but in this case this did not occur. As, I work with the investigators frequently with different recording software and files from various different crimes and typically that is the case but in this, there was no player but I believe installing the codec will work, as I have had to do such in similar situations. I just believe whomever downloaded the file simply does not know what theyâ€™re doing.\n\nMediaCoder touches any format I have ever seen. It is a converter/encoder software. It is freeware too.\n\nIts also a long shot, but have you tried the old view extension and rename .lwx to .mp4, .avi, or .mov and see if it opens from there?"
