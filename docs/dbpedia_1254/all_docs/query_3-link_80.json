You can split, delete, join, cut, and trim videos with the ultimate ease. On the provided linear timeline, you get to;\n\nAdjust parameters like the video brightness, contrast, gamma, hue, saturation, temperature.\n\nAdd effects like blur, grayscale, deinterlace, noise, sharpen, etc.\n\nTransform the video by zooming, rotating, flipping, skewing, mirroring, shifting, etc.\n\nAnnotate the video with text, drawing lines, arrows, borders, shapes, or image overlays.\n\nApply filters to make the video dark, noir, mild, among others.\n\nIn regard to the audio, you are opened up to amplitude, delay, time/pitch, invert, and filter effects that can be applied conveniently at the click of a button. Better yet, AVS Video Converter offers a preview window where you can check whether the changes you make are reflecting as expected.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, AVS Video Converter is a reliable software that offers a healthy experience to convert video files on top of other extra nifty tools like video editing and DVD burning.
