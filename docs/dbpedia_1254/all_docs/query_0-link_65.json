Is MPEG the Same as MP4?\n\nDifference Between MP4 and MPEG4\n\nMPEG-4 is a video encoding algorithm. It is responsible for how images are converted and converted into data. On the other hand, MP4 is a container format, and hence it does not have a cheap method of coding the audio or video information. It uses codecs that dictate how video or audio will be coded.\n\nMPEG-4 is a compression format utilized in compression of audio and visual digital data on a computer. Comparatively, MP4 is a container format used to store video and audio files. It can also save subtitles for a video file. As a container, MP4 can store video files that have been compressed in different versions including MPEG-4. MP4 is not concerned about how the images are converted into data, but it is naturally concerned about how the video and audio within a file, as well as other relevant information like subtitles, chapters, etc., are stored within the file."
