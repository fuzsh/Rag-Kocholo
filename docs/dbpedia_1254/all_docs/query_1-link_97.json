It's nice, can't wait for automatic batch conversion so don't have to add stuff one by one.\n\nWhen you say mp3 audio, do you mean input or output?\n\nI usually use Yamb, TMPEGEnc, and even Nero Vision. I've also used 3GP2AVI. I've even used VLC a few times, it's a powerful transcoder if you can figure out what works best together.\n\nFor FFMpeg I like using WinFF, it's kinda like Yamb."
