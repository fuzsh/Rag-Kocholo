        "text": "Ok. That great that you tryed so many ways before you asked - that is really great because that mean that yo really try to resolve your issue. But tell us and show us some specs:\n\n- what OS\n\n- what AE version\n\n- screenschot of your final comp that your rendering\n\nand anything more that can show us the issue.\n\nWhat do you mean blank? There is no video or you have white/black screen or some test patterns or what. And how do you try to play those videos - on what player?\n\nWindows 10 is the OS, AE, Premier, and Media Encoder are all 2019 CC.\n\nThe screen is black (and sometimes green) on VLC Media Player. Windows Media Player won't play the video(s) at all.\n\nOk. Your AE and PPro are 2019 but in newest versions (december update) or earlier? If earlier - please update to newest versions.\n\nAfter Effects 16.0.1\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro 13.0.2\n\nand\n\nAdobe Media Encoder 13.0.2\n\nafter that - try to render your files.\n\nYou can also look there: Image quality changes after saving the project. Green/pink haze on video.\n\nAnd for rendering your mp4/h264 use preset \"Match Source - high bitrate.\n\nLet us know if that helped.\n\nI made sure everything was updated. I went back in to AE and saved the project to make sure any affect the updates might have had would be saved. I did the same with Premier, and then I used Media Encoder to finalize. Here are my settings in Encoder:\n\nI still got a messed up file. This time, it blacked out my whole computer screen after a few seconds, and then I couldn't even shut it down with CTRL+ALT+DEL! What in the world is going on? I can play other MP4 videos just fine, so its not VLC or Windows Media Player.\n\nIt blacked out your computer how? You opened that file in what payer? What did you had to shut down?\n\nDid you try to make any other composition/new project - even simplest animation of moving solids or text being writen and render it? If no - try to do that and let us know if that composition was rendered correctly. Or try to pou any video file into AE and export - render it as mp4.\n\nThat will help us to understand if there is something wrong with AE/AME or that exact composition.\n\nNothing wrong with anything Adobe. It turns out that using a Hewlitt Packard is the worst idea possible. Since my first few iterations in trying to render the file, I stopped trying to playback the video on both VLC and Windows Media Players. I started trying only VLC since that is what is set to automatically open media files. After double-checking Windows Update, Adobe Updates, driver updates, I rendered one more file and decided to try Windows Media Player.\n\nTHE FILE FREAKING WORKED!\n\nI tried opening it in VLC, and green screen! So I hopped on VLC's website...turns out, HP and VLC doesn't always get along.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you for all your help. You probably solved this issue a week ago. Because of all the crap I went through, and all the various settings I had to learn about, I actually reduced the time it is going to take for me to create videos! Have a Happy New Year!\n\nUsing Premier Pro 2019, I was able to remove the .AVI file, import the After Effects sequence, and then export to a final .AVI file. I succeeded, but the finished product was not of very good quality. I am now attempting to use the Premier sequence in Media Encoder, create a good .AVI file, and just use a 3rd-party application to convert to .MP4.\n\nI'll let you know how it turns out."
