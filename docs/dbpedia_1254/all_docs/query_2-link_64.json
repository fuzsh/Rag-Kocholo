If you're unsure which tool is right for you, here are some of the key factors to consider when looking for the best freeware video converter:\n\nEase-of-use: make sure that the app you use is easy to use for your own skills and technical abilities. If you're a beginner who hasn't used much conversion software in the past, for example, you may want to find an app that is particularly easy to use, without any confusing menus or complex designs.\n\nFeatures: make sure that the Windows 10 video converter tool you use has all of the necessary features you need. Some tools only offer conversions, but others will offer extra features and functions, like editing to help you enhance and alter your clips and movies. Read through the feature list for each app before deciding which one you want to use.\n\nSupported formats: the whole point of a video converter is to be able to convert videos into different formats, but some of them have quite strict lists in terms of which file formats they support. You need to check that the converter you're using offers full support for the file formats you want to work with, including common options like MP4 and AVI.\n\nSecurity: you also need to think about security features and settings of your chosen app. Make sure that any files you share with the app, especially online apps, will be kept safe and private so that other users won't be able to have access to your personal movies or clips. The best free video conversion software always has strong security standards.\n\nUser reviews: make sure to take a read through some user reviews and look at the average ratings for any free video conversion software you want to use, too. User reviews usually provide a balanced and unbiased look at tools and apps, letting you find out more about how easy they are to use and if they have any bugs or problems that could cause issues for you.\n\nSupport: check what sort of customer support is available from the maker of each app or tool. For example, some developers will offer live chat, online, and email support, as well as written or video guides and tutorials to help you get started with the free video converter for Windows. Others will be less helpful in terms of service and support."
