        "text": "i have posted this in the newbie video conversion section but didnt get any help other than to say it cant be done and to go get xvid4psp which doesnt do all my videos anyways and changes the audio/video quality in the process.\n\nwanting to get a video converter that can convert any video to mpg2/vob/h264 without a change in its quality. seemingly a simple request but trying handbrake, winff, mediacoder avanti and every other bloody video coder under the sun i cant get a program to complete this simple task.\n\nthis is what everyone wants after all- a video converter that copies the video and audio and only changes the container so it can be read by video editing software or read by a ps3 xbox or whatever. why isnt this a simple program download and simple function. so frustrating.\n\npleaseeeeee what can we do here. if only media coder did what it promised out of the box. !!!\n\nthere must be a way to do this, i dont believe it cant be done. if the size of the file doesnt matter surely this can be done somehow. if it cant as some have told me, WHY, what do i need to understand here. please help further as this is the one goal that everyone seems to share\n\nit ? im not an it.\n\ni can accept that different applications may be required for different containers. given that, im still unable to find a converter that can convert all videos to mpg2 or mp4 without loss of quality. such a simple request that none of the applications are able to do. why ? if im not able to do this as advisd in the post in the newbie conversion section, why not, what do i need to learn/understand ?\n\nits such a simple question that i cant believe i cant get a simple answer on this. if i cant do it, why.. doesnt seem logical that you are unable to convert to another container without loss of quality. rather then just tell me what you use like most people do tell me what i need to complete this simple task. please. .... ??\n\nend goal is frame by frame editing of the original video. but to edit the original video i need to convert it to a container the video editor will read. hence the question of all videos to a specific container.\n\nok so if i want to use a lossless intermediate, that will allow me to convert any video to a format that vegas will recognise? but the file size will be huge? thats fine if its huge.\n\nframe to frame editing is what i require essentially.\n\nif the filesize is huge i can edit that, and export again losslessly right?\n\nthanks for the reply man, seem to be getting somewhere..\n\nyou just don't understand digital video. mpeg-2 and mpeg-4 don't have individual frames(complete still pictures). they have i, p and b frames. i frames contain a complete picture, but b and p frames don't. long gop videos like these reference the i frame and then changes from it or other frames.\n\nthe only way to have all complete frames is with uncompressed video or lossless compression. the file size is huge..... and when you convert it to anything else there is the same loss of quality as if you went directly from the original source. as in mpeg-2 -> lossless -> mpeg-4 = mpeg-2-> mpeg-4. there is no difference. the in-between steps all require re-encoding.\n\nno i dont understand digital video, its all new to me. gotta start somewhere\n\nwhen i edit a dvd by importing a vob to an editing program, it edits frame to frame. do dvds use i frames ?\n\nall the transitions and effects can be done after importing whatever video into the editing program though, yeah?\n\nok but if you encode at the final destination, ie when burning to a bluray, the loss of quality will be as minimal as possible if its been kept lossless the entire way. thats basically where im coming from. if you follow me..\n\nessentially what im wanting to do is convert ALL video to X codec X container (lossless) then be able to edit those in X video editor then export that to a bluray and get the minimal loss at the end when authoring. given that, i need to look at what codec/container ???\n\nand given that codec/container combo what video editor should i look at, i guess most would import the same codecs/containers and video editor is just personal preference etc.. so doesnt really matter..\n\nso huffyuv codec is lossless should i get a converter that converts alll video to huffyuv then i can frame edit all my video in whatever video editor ?\n\nIt is a waste of time from what you have described so far. You would get the same results from (e.g. if you were using say a DVD MPEG2 source):\n\na) importing huffyuv intermediate & editing in NLE\n\nb) importing directly & editing in NLE\n\nAt which point the export format decision determines how much loss you will incur\n\nDon't convert to MPEG2 as an intermediate editing format, unless your final format goal is MPEG2. (you would incur an extra stage of generation loss, when you convert to the final format)\n\nImpossible. MPEG2 is lossy...\n\nJust edit it directly in a NLE.\n\nAlso if your source is SD (like a DVD) and you are planning a blu-ray, don't expect any improvement in quality. It will only look worse (unless you used the original streams to author).\n\nIf most your sources were DVD (MPEG2), you can make a SD MPEG2 blu-ray, and author it with multiavchd, but all SD content looks like crap on the HD screen. If you only had minor editing, you could use smart rendering and allow most sections to pass through and lose no quality in those sections\n\nsource formats are everything, from mkv to mp4 to flv wmv divx, dvd, m2ts everything you can possibly imagine.\n\natm, ive only really dabbled in vegas but far from used it on any extensive level as i really wanna get this codec/container issue sorted so i can start pooring through all the video i have.\n\nfancy stuff is the goal but initially i wanna get all the source material and cut up the frame to frame sequences i want of it all then get deeper into the editing from there. but the frame to frame cutting is what i wanna get really underway first..\n\nIf you already have Vegas, I would just import all the clips that I could natively, and for the ones that don't work, (either because of container or video codec or whaterver) use a lossless intermediate\n\nIf this was for a project (you mentioned blu-ray?), I wouldn't bother editing the individual clips to frame accuracy beforehand, because that can all be done in the editor when you put it all together (it would be a waste of time)"
