        "text": "**I found a lot of people testing it saying it has a virus in it (and/or spyware).**\n\nLaer,\n\nIt is truly unfortunate that a few warped individuals will modify someone else's freeware program and release it for download under the original name. This has not only happened with Super in the past, but with thousands of other programs, and in no way is a reflection on the integrity of either the software or the company. There seemed to be a problem with a much older version of Super that was addressed by eRight.\n\nThe solution is to download software only from reputable sites, meaning those that thoroughly test and certify the software to be virus- and spyware-free, and not listen to those who condemn the developers after they downloaded a corrupted file from a malicious individual.\n\nDo you think that CNET, ZDNET, Softpedia, Tucows, Digg, Brothersoft, Free-Codecs.com, and dozens of others would offer Super for download if it had a virus or spyware? The answer is that their liability would be huge if they did. In offering this software for download, it means the software (from its authors) has been tested numerous times and carry the site's guarantee of cleanliness.\n\nAlso, occasionally a spyware sweeper will report a false positive on an executable, especially ones that contain complex algorithms that may contain snippets that \"look like\" something in their definition database. A positive from one utility does not necessarily mean a program contains a virus. This has happened to me with other legitimate encoders (not Super).\n\nI agree, you probably shouldn't use Super, but please don't spread rumors or unsubstantiated accusations against its developers as a rationale for your decision.\n\nYeah, I just read some of those same comments. The ones that posted links to their download sites were all unrecognizable. That's probably the reason for the big disclaimer on eRight's website about tampered setup files.\n\n*The point is, you are going to read claims (sometimes true) about viruses, spyware, trojans in thousands of freeware programs, not just a few. That does not mean there is anything wrong with all freeware programs. The acid test is to go to reputable download sites like CNET and others, and see if they offer it for download. If they do, it has been tested. If not, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.\n\n*No matter what version of what software you use, there are some people that are going to have problems. That is a fact of life whether you're using Super, Vegas, or MS Windows. Again, you should use the software that works for you, and be gracious enough to allow that other software might work for others.\n\n*I used to get alerts from Spybot (a reputable spy-sweeper) about a program that I had on my computer since Windows 95 days. It turned out that the oldest Xing encoder had some code in it that looked like a win32 worm that was created years later.\n\nAll that being said, I appreciate and accept your explanation for your post; and still advocate caution and discretion when either considering downloading software from unknown sites, or when reading others' opinions or experiences without knowing all of the facts involved. I've certainly been swayed, both positively and negatively, by stuff I've read on the internet without checking all the data available.\n\nThank you for seeing my side. I was hoping this wouldn't turn into a flame war.\n\nYes, it really goes both ways.... one can be swayed by both false negative AND positive reviews... afterall, just because people are claiming it's fine, doesn't mean that it is totally clean/honest. Sadly, these days, viruses don't announce themselves (like they used to, when it was about boasting... whereas now it's about making money, so hiding and evasion of detection is the main focus). The old line 'I didn't ever get a virus' is no longer applicable... as you wouldn't know if you had one, as they now do everything they can to hide.\n\nI'm very cautious about what I take from what I read with reviews... Agreed, many are from (to put it bluntly) morons who either are clueless, determined to attack the product for some reason, or are experiencing trouble not because of the software, but from other software (or combination of hardware/software), or the sum of their computer neglect (security, etc). I mean, how many times have you heard someone say \"This software won't even run\", when thousands of others are running it fine. That's an obvious issue with the user's system.\n\nHowever, I have to say with this one in particular, I was getting waring signs. The ridiculous effort needed to just download it, rather than just having a download button on the first page. Others have pointed out the odd wording of the site, their repetition of how it's safe, etc... which I certainly consider, but don't take as concrete evidence, obviously.\n\nBut, ultimately, if I read a long stream of posts about people having issues... be it that the software (new version) isn't working, or that they found malware or viruses, or that they get annoying alert windows literally threatening them to upgrade or suffer possible computer damage(!), and others who have had their system crash (...supposedly from the software, but certainly not proven).... I tend to re-evaluate whether I want to install it.\n\nYes, it may all be lies or misunderstandings... but at what point do you say, \"Hey, a lot of people are having trouble with this... I won't get it.\"? What is the magic number where you take the reviews as 'real'?\n\nIt's a nasty thing overall, I agree... Working both ways... Good reviews, too, can be planted by people attached to the product (as is done sometimes with game/movie reviews). I've certainly seem my share of forum/chat areas that have had an obvious flood of bad reviews (legitimately), followed (in reaction) by a sudden flood of good reviews (to protect their product).\n\nSo, ultimately, the reviews, good or bad, are (in reality) kind of pointless... as you can't really tell what is truth now. And, most importantly, this is not just a matter of me installing software, trying it out, and making my own decision (...I wish it WAS!)... as the problem is that if it IS bad (virus, malware, damages the O/S, etc), the damage is done. So, unfortunately, in such cases, I reluctantly have to just pass on it. I can't afford to have that happen.\n\nThere a fine line between common sense and paranoia... ;)\n\nI can't seem to find it on any of the sites you mentioned.\n\nI could be an ass and claim that THAT doesn't look good either!.... Well, okay, I guess I just did, didn't I?\n\nI feel the same way about how you can easily 'prove your assumptions' one way or another on the internet. Problem is, that's basically all you have.... other than trying it out yourself (which, ultimately, is the best method anyway)... but as stated before, the whole problem is it's like verifying that something is not poison by drinking it. Works great if you didn't think it was poison, and were correct... but otherwise, it's a bit of a problem.\n\nSo, sadly, all we DO have is reviews and our security software. While I am fully aware and agree that false positives happen (that's fact), it begs the question, \"Why buy a burglar alarm if you just stay in bed and say 'It's probably just a squirrel or something' every time it goes off?\". If we had a means to verify the alert, then it would be a simple matter. But, at this point, all we have is 'Well, they're repuatible'... which these days is a naive concept. Some cops steal... Some priests commit sins... We can't just assume these days.\n\nIf I could find a copy of SUPER on one of these legit sites, I would be curious to try it (...although very nervous, keeping in mind the 'testing the poison' thing I mentioned). Granted, I'd scan it first... but, it a false positive is expected, then what's the point if I ignore any alerts for this software anyway? Has it been proven that the alerts people are supposedly getting are in fact false positives? (heheh... See, it works both ways too!)\n\nThis is such a drag, as I just want to convert some files... and it seems like such a hassle. I DID have a seemingly good freeware program (Prism... which, oddly enough, is advertised on the SUPER website... which seems odd, considering it's a competitor!). Seemed to work fine, but later I noticed that the sync is off (randomly too... Some clips are fine, others are off a bit at the start, but much more towards the end, like the audio was going at a different frame rate!)\n\nI'd gladly pay for a converter.... but there's no guarantee that it wouldn't do the same thing... as at this point, I don't have a clue WHY it's doing the sync slip. From a technical standpoint, it seems impossible (...especially considering the 'bad' clips play perfectly outside of Vegas, DVDA and AfterEffects! That's the part I REALLY don't get!\n\n[LATE ADDITION: I found SUPER on Free-Codecs. Version 2008 Build 33. As would be expected, one guy pointed out the trojan detected. Still makes me nervous... installing it, ignoring my security software's warnings. Really not sure what to do. It's not like a sign will suddenly pop up saying \"I've infected your computer! HAHAHA!\" (like in the good old days). Now, it would just be 'Ya, everything's cool... You just keep doing what you're doing... Don't mind me....\"]\n\n[ANOTHER LATE ADDITION: Are the files on Free-Codecs scanned and guaranteed clean? There's no mention that I see... Plus, you have this in their policy statement: \"Free-Codecs.com shall not be liable for any damages or injury resulting from your access to, or inability to access, this Web Site, or from any virus, bugs, tampering, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay, computer line failure, or any other technical malfunction related to this Web Site.\" . Yikes.. So much for the 'They wouldn't put themselves in that kind of liability' argument!]\n\nWell, it turns out there are two other software products named \"Super Video Converter\", one from WMATools, the other one from someone called wittcobber. It appears that they do not convert flv or come from the same place as the eRight Super.\n\nSo, it seems I have substantially proven all of my own points about jumping to conclusions. However,\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere it is on CNET (\"Tested Spyware Free\"):\n\nhttp://www.download.com/SUPER/3000-2139_4-170516.html?tag=mncol&cdlPid=547824\n\nHere it is on Softpedia (\"Softpedia guarantees that SUPER 2008 Build 33 is 100% FREE, which means it does not contain any form of malware, including spyware, viruses, trojans and backdoors.\"):\n\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Encoders-Converter-DIVX-Related/SUPER.shtml\n\nAnd finally, here is is on Free-Codecs.com as you mentioned (Out of nearly 100,000 downloads, one person claims the program contains a Trojan. They did not say what program detected the Trojan, or if it was real, or could be independently verified, or if they downloaded it from the home site, so either the poster knows something that CNET and Softpedia do not, or else it is an example of the kind of irresponsible posting that I referred to previously).\n\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/super.htm\n\nThere is encryption software from the same author (eRightSoft.com) on ZDNet and Tucows, but not Super.\n\nUPDATE: I downloaded SUPER from Softpedia (...they checked out as far as guaranteeing it was clean, and not hiding behind a 'we're not responsible if it's not' clause. It was nice to be able to just download it, rather than having to jump through hoops like on the original site.\n\nI scanned all the files, and everything came out clean. That was a relief. An alert (even if it was a false positive) would have made me really nervous.\n\nInstalled it (no issues), it tried to hook up to the internet, but I had the internet off... I'm sure it was just a standard update check or something....\n\nSoftware seemed pretty straightforward and intuitive... Took a minute or so to figure it out, but I was soon impressed by how it really seemed intelligent (not only pointing out if it thought a particular setting wouldn't work well, but also suggesting a proper setting... Very nice...).\n\nI tried a test clip (which would normally have sync issues when I ran it through my other converting software.... and it worked! Also nice! Loaded into DVDA, it showed proper sync (...as well as correcting an aspect issue that the previous one had that I hadn't really noticed.... or at least assumed that was just the way it was).\n\nSo, I'm now trying it all out in DVDA, setting up the DVD chapters, etc, and I'm going to render it out. By the looks of it, though, it worked very well.\n\nSo, unless my machine refuses to boot up tomorrow, or my bank account suddenly drains, I'm giving SUPER a thumbs up.\n\nI'll let you know if the final DVD is okay, but so far, it's looking very good.\n\nThanks to everyone for pointing it out to me (there were a few people), as well as 'musicvid' for pointing out the clean links."
