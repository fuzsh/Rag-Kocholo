There wasn’t anything else there that looked encouraging. >:)\n\nUnfortunately, the native Sony software (which I have to run on XP) wasn’t any help at all. Don’t get me started on that either! Other Windows vendors seem to want mega bucks to do what seems such a simple operation.\n\nI’m guessing my mp4 needs to have a resolution downgrade (to 320*240) in order to play?\n\nLooks like all mp4’s are not created equal afterall?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated…"
