        "text": "On windows, virtual dub will do some of the format you have listed. I have never seen a FLV converter. I guess you could screen cap it?\n\nScreen recorder GOLD can capture any format, assuming you have the CPU power to playback a video and capture it at the same time.\n\nhttp://www.softsea.com/screenshot/Screen-Recorder-Gold.html\n\nVirtual Dub only uses AVI. I want to convert both from and to FLV. Ideally I’d like to be able to convert to 3GP : Mobile phone format.\n\nIt can all be done through FFMPEG, but thats command-line powered. I don’t know how to get to the command-line on windows.\n\nLooks like some good programs, but I’m not so keen to pay for a GUI for an open-source software.\n\nYou can use VLC… It can transcode either via the command line or from the GUI…\n\n(media—>convert/save as) in the outputs check the “file” tickbox… there’s a pulldown list of presets or some tabs for you to set it up yourself…\n\nin a more limited (in terms of output) way try “handbrake”\n\nBoth of these are on windows and mac and linux\n\nvlc, yep…\n\nalso , mediacoder, http://mediacoder.sourceforge.net/ , is GUI based, but is not simple to handle well. Still very advanced and very useful. Helped me a lot to convert to mp4 with h264 codec and other combinations…\n\nBTW, I have not handy here the link, but there IS a binary snapshot build of FFMPEG every day or every X days… don’t expect as with any snapshot binary to be it super stable or complete in every build, but hey, you try several and usually find one supporting well what u want.\n\nAm not fan of that method, though. I usually prefer a comercial tool of the company, or , while making the file bigger, the free riva encoder: (this one only converts to flv, and has its trick for non standard sizes) http://rivavx.com/index.php?encoder\n\nI think you can overt <-> flv and other formats with mediacoder, tho. And is very handy for other purposes as well.\n\nGood luck.\n\nI use Super from erightsoft.com. It’s a front end for ffmpeg, mencoder, and a couple of others (included in the free package). VirtualDub can now open far more than avi’s. The later versions allow for input plugins and there are some out there for mpeg-2, flv, QuickTime, and even a DirectShow filter that opens a lot of formats. Still only writes avi’s, though. You could frameserve it to another converter if you wanted to make use of its effects plugins. And, of course, Blender can deal with lots of file types via the VSE, which relies on ffmpeg.\n\nAvidemux - I don’t know why it’s called Avidemux, it’s certainly not limited to AVI and it does a lot more than demuxing.\n\nOpens just about anything, transcodes to all the commonly used video / audio codecs, as well as supports all mainstream container formats.\n\nCan do all the standard processing dealing with color, size, framerate, filtering etc.\n\nAvailable for Windows, Mac, Linux\n\nCompletely self contained.\n\nFOSS.\n\nhttp://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/"
