        "text": "Scheemda (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈsxeːmdaː] ⓘ; abbreviation: Sda) is an unstaffed railway station in Scheemda in the Netherlands. It is located on the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway between Zuidbroek and Winschoten in the province of Groningen.\n\nThe station building was designed by Karel Hendrik van Brederode and completed in 1865. The train services started on 1 May 1868. Trains have been operated by Staatsspoorwegen (1868–1937), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (1938–2000), NoordNed (2000–2005), and Arriva (2005–present).\n\nThere are two tracks and an island platform at the station. Two local train services with trains in both directions call at Scheemda twice per hour. There are also connections to four regional bus services provided by Qbuzz.\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe railway station is located at the Stationsstraat in the village of Scheemda, part of the municipality of Oldambt, in the east of the province of Groningen in the northeast of the Netherlands.[1] It is situated on the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway, also called Staatslijn B, between the railway stations of Zuidbroek and Winschoten.[2] The Heiligerlee railway stop was situated between Scheemda and Winschoten from 1908 to 1934.[2] The distance from Scheemda westward to railway terminus Harlingen Haven is 110 km (68 mi), to Groningen 29 km (18 mi), and to Zuidbroek 7.6 km (4.7 mi), and eastward to Winschoten is 4.9 km (3.0 mi), and to Bad Nieuweschans 17 km (11 mi).[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station building was completed in 1865. The station was opened on 1 May 1868, when train services started on the segment of the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway between Groningen and Winschoten.[1] At the time, the station was named Scheemda-Eexta.[citation needed]\n\nTrains were operated by Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (1868–1937), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (1938–2000), NoordNed (2000–2005), and Arriva (2005–present).\n\nBuilding and layout\n\n[edit]\n\nStation layout\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe 19th-century station building is of the type SS 4th class,[1] which was probably[citation needed] designed by architect Karel Hendrik van Brederode.[a] Fifteen buildings of this type were built in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1890, of which seven remain today.[3] The building has been a national heritage site (Dutch: rijksmonument) since 2001.[4]\n\nThe railway through Scheemda is unelectrified and oriented northwest to southeast. At the station, the single-track railway splits into two tracks. There is an island with two platforms that can be accessed via a level crossing. Platform 1 alongside the northern track is serving trains to Groningen and platform 2 alongside the southern track is serving trains to Winschoten. The station building is north of both tracks. Beyond the station, the tracks merge back into a single track.[5]\n\nTrain services\n\n[edit]\n\nRoute Service type Operator Notes Groningen - Hoogezand-Sappemeer - Zuidbroek - Winschoten - Bad Nieuweschans - Leer (Germany) Local (\"Stoptrein\") Arriva 1x per hour Groningen - Hoogezand-Sappemeer - Zuidbroek - Winschoten (- Bad Nieuweschans) Local (\"Stoptrein\") Arriva 1x per hour - 1x per 2 hours on Sundays.
