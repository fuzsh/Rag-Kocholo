        "text": "A simple interactive shell chatbot that allows you to plan a journey with NS, the Dutch Railways. Written in Python 3.\n\nOur scripts do not depend on any packages outside of Python 3's base packages. You will, however, need to request an API key for the NS API.\n\nWe recommend to run clibot.py with its arguments through a simple shell script for easy access.\n\nThe NS API uses basic HTTP requests. Requests are done through simpele GET requests; responses are XML and are therefore easy to process. More information on the API can be found in its extensive documentation, which is available in both Dutch and English.\n\nAside from exchanging basic pleasantries, the bot is able to give the user a full journey advice, including transfers. This can either be done through interactive dialogue, or by processing a full sentence.\n\nBrief example\n\nA more extensive example\n\nThe NsBot has been constructed in such a way that it can be used as a base class for extensions, e.g. for it to function as a bot on an IRC or IM network. Due to time constraints, we have not made such an implementation as of yet.\n\nCurrently, the bot is unable to tell the price of a journey, as the NS API consistently returns an HTTP 403 error."
