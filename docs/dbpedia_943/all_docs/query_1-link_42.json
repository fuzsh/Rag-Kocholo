        "text": "Things to do in Prague\n\nAbout Prague\n\nThe medieval town of Prague looks like something out of a fairytale picture book—every street and square seem more magical than the last.\n\nCharles Bridge: One of the most notable places around the city, the bridge is lined with statues on either side. It’s one of the most popular tourist spots in Prague, known for its beauty, architecture and the way it seems to capture perfect pictures every time. Since the bridge can become quite crowded, try to get to there around sunrise so that you encounter fewer fellow tourists and to capture awesome pictures.\n\nPrague Castle: After getting your fill of the beauty of Charles Bridge, hike up the steep hill to Prague Castle. The view as you climb up towards the castle is exhausting but well worth it. The castle sits overlooking the city, so it’s an excellent place just to relax and enjoy the view. Since the Prague Castle can become very crowded, it’s recommended to get to the castle as early as you can. The ticket prices vary, depending on how much of the castle you’d like to see–do some simple research ahead of time because the ticket booth will always recommend the all-inclusive (and most expensive) ticket. After exploring the grounds of the castle, you will probably be starving. Although there are many restaurants located around the castle, try to venture further away to not be sucked into a tourist trap.\n\nJohn Lennon Wall: After reenergizing from your hike up to Prague Castle, stroll back down to see the infamous John Lennon Wall. Even though John Lennon never visited Prague, the wall bears his name because he was known for spreading messages of love and peace. During the communist rule of the Czech Republic, students flocked to this wall to spread messages of love and peace. Today the wall lives on, and anyone can add their messages. Since there are no signs that can lead you to the wall, search for it on Google Maps or simply follow the crowds.\n\nPlaces of Interest in Prague\n\nAfter exploring what lays beyond the bridge, cross back over to wander around Prague’s Old Square. Since the old, winding streets of Prague can be extremely confusing to maneuver, it’s a good idea to have at least one person in your group with a working cell phone. The star of the old town is the Astronomical Clock, which strikes every hour. The city has been doing some renovation to the clock, so it’s possible that a portion of the clock will be covered up during your visit. You can stroll lazily between the churches, cafes, and shops that surround the square on which the clock lies. During Christmas, the town's largest Christmas market is held in the square below the steeples of churches and the Astronomical Clock\n\nCulture and History of Prague\n\nDuring WWII, Hitler planned to appoint the synagogues and Jewish cemeteries of Prague as a \"Museum of an Extinct Race.\" Now many of these monuments serve as reminders of the past as well as to pay respect to those lost during the Holocaust. One can visit all the synagogues and the Old Jewish cemetery with one ticket. If you have the time, it will be well spent visiting all the possible monuments. It takes on about two hours to visit the Old New Synagogue, Maisel Synagogue, Pinkas Synagogue, Klausen Synagogue, Old Jewish Cemetery, Ceremonial Hall and Robert Guttmann Gallery.\n\nFood and drink in Prague\n\nThe Czech Republic consumes the most beer per capita, so you know they have to have good beer. You can easily find good beer and pair it with equally tasty food all around the city center. If you’re visiting Prague during the warmer months, try to visit one of the city's beer gardens.\n\nIf beer is not your thing or if you just have a sweet tooth, be sure to have at least one Trendelnik. They are traditional spiral pastries covered with cinnamon sugar and sometimes filled with either Nutella or ice cream. Traditional Czech food is known for being very heavy, which should be no problem since you are walking off all the carbs while exploring the city.\n\nBuses to Prague\n\nFind the most affordable buses to Prague\n\nWith FlixBus, it’s easy to travel to Prague, as 402 rides are available starting from only $1.99 depending on the departure city, date and time.
