B. Metcalf (at left in photograph wnh Pres,dent Silber), an alumnus and Trustee of Boston University. Candidates are nominated by students faculty or alumni, and finalists are selected by a screening committee of faculty and students. The committee’s recommend!’ non is then forwarded to the Executive Office and Board of Trustees for approval. “The purpose of the prize ” Dr . etcalf said, is to establish a systematic procedure for the review of the quality of teaching and the identification and advancement of those members of the faculty who excel as teachers, of which this cup is symbolic. ” Dennis D. Berkey COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS Since joining the faculty in 1974, Professor Dennis Berkey has made unusually significant contributions to the lives of Boston University students. Teaching mathematics and statistics at all levels, Professor Berkey has a gift for expressing extremely complicated ideas lucidly and coherently. He is equally meticulous in his own preparation and in his evaluation of his students’ work. His classroom presentations are done with skill, taste and imagination. He demands hard work and high standards, yet is sought out as a teacher not only by mathematics majors and graduate students, but also by students in engineering and premedical programs, as well as by colleagues seeking mathematical illumination of problems in their own fields. As an advisor, Professor Berkey extends himself beyond the usual curricular guidance to raise students’ aspirations and to help them shape their larger goals. He helped found and is now advisor to the Undergraduate Math Association. Colleagues wonder at his detailed knowledge of and insight into his students and advisees. But for Professor Berkey teaching is not a duty con­ fined to the classroom and-the office. It is a way of life. Under the faculty-inresidence program his home is in Claflin Dormitory. There his example of the intellectual life has exerted a profoundly civilizing influence. His tutoring in mathematics has rendered the subject not ahirt^rr! C’ ! e\"J°yable’,to many who had Previously found it arcane and forbidding. His patience a!d rare exhihh d “d\" ?akre h'm 'nVaiuablc ,0 alL As a ,eacher in elass and out, of students and faculty, Dennis Berkey has exhibited a depth of commitment that is its own reward, but that Boston University wishes to recognize through its most prestigious teaching award. ® ® vii The Metcalf Awards The Metcalf Awards FOR EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING FOR EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING The Metcalf Awards, endowed by a gift from Dr. A. G. B. Metcalf, are given annually to other finalists in the com­ petition for the Metcalf Cup and Prize. These Metcalf Awards are SI,000 each. “The Excellence in Teaching Awards are a concrete expression of our intent at Boston University to recognize and advance Teacher-Scholars,’’ President John R. Silber declared. “We are not interested in recruiting teachers who excuse themselves from the test of scholarship or writing; nor are we interested in scholars who disdain the company of students. Students at Boston Uni­ versity in future years will be the beneficiaries of this program to encourage outstanding teaching.’’ Alfred Prock COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS Alfred Prock faces a forbidding task: to teach difficult required subjects to pre­ professional students. Since the inception of Boston University’s highly respected six-year medical program, Professor Prock has been responsible for laying bare to premedical students the mysteries of physical chemistry. Fortunately he has the facility of the great teacher in illustrating sophisticated concepts with graphic examples drawn from everyday life. His extraordinary success as a teacher is widely recognized. Graduates recall with awe the lucidity with which he explains the layvs of thermodynamics. Students have often commented that even in large classes Professor Prock senses their individual needs. Little wonder that it is hard to find an empty seat in his lecture room, even at an early class with a snowstorm raging outside. Students do not hesitate to seek him out, knowing that they will be rewarded with a sympathetic hearing, with a penetrating appraisal of their problem, and with gentle guidance toward a solution. As a teacher of science, Professor Prock can receive no greater satisfaction than to know that it is through his keen understanding, his transparent exposition, and his generous availability that his students have learned to think scientifically and to relish scientific inquiry. Samuel Stern METROPOLITAN COLLEGE Professor Samuel Stern is known internationally for his contributions to the field of developmental biology. No less significant are his contributions to the teaching of science in an interdisciplinary context. Professor Stern combines scien­ tific discipline with wide knowledge and unifying vision. His standards are con­ sistently demanding, yet his courses are among the most popular in the College. Students find the energy and vivacity of his presentation irresistible. His reputa­ tion as a teacher is not limited to Boston University and its immediate vicinity. Colleagues from around the country admire his rare blend of force and amiability, of scholarship and wit, of rigor and humor, and many have expressed the wish that they could take his courses. The Metcalf Award acknowledges Professor Stern’s personal commitment to precise scholarship and broad understanding, and his ability to share this commitment with mature adults who seek to expand their knowledge and their horizons at Boston University. Freda Rebelsky COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS Freda Rebelsky has already received national recognition of her gifts as a teacher. In 1970 she was named a Distinguished Teacher of Psychology by the American Psychological Foundation, and in 1971 the Danforth Foundation con­ ferred upon her its E. Harris Harbison Award for Gifted Teaching. Professor Rebelsky’s scholarly field is developmental psychology. The breadth of her knowledge and the depth of her concern are prized by students of psychology and of the health professions. She inspires curiosity about and compassion for the human condition, and confers dignity on all its forms. Her commitment to teaching extends to the full development of her students. Professor Rebelsky does not assume that any aspect of their lives is outside the educational domain, and accordingly she offers students support and insight in their every problem and in every context. Her concern is not limited to those in her Department or in her classes. Each year she offers a seminar, “Job Hunting with a B.A.,” to which all undergraduates are invited. Her contributions and services outside the academy are many. A scholar, writer, and editor, a professional who generously serves the larger community, Professor Rebelsky is distinguished by her commitment to academic excellence, her effectiveness as a teacher, and her dedication to the welfare of students at Boston University. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ix viii Honorary Degree G. William Miller, doctor of laws * https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Your new post is frequently called the second most important in the federal government; your appoint­ ment to it, the most significant of this administration. President Carter has said that your role as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board is less influential only than his own “in shaping our economic strength in the future.” The breadth of your education and experience qualify you exceptionally. Marine engineer, lawyer, dis­ tinguished veteran of the Coast Guard, you guided Textron, Inc., and its subsidiaries through a period in which sales rose from $250 million to $2.8 billion. The respect of the national business community is demonstrated by your leadership of its most prestigious organizations. Business leaders throughout the country proclaim your ability to succeed in filling your post as you have defined it: “bringing business un­ derstanding to the workings of economic policy.” Your preparation for this task far surpasses extensive experience and a broad knowledge of economics. You have led an astonishing array of local and national organizations: the philanthropic life of Rhode Island is reflected in your record in that state; nationally, you have been a Governor of the United Nations Associa­ tion, Trustee of the National Urban League, Chairman of the National Alliance of Businessmen, and Chair­ man of the President’s Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity. To list even a representative selection of your achievements would exceed the reasonable bounds of lapidary prose. It suffices to say that your accession to the Chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Board has left an empty chair at one important board table after another, in business, government, and philanthropy. In the first months of what we know will be a historic term of office, Boston University is proud to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Laws, honoris causa. xi Honorary Degree Alice L. Beeman, doctor of humane letters Your service to education was recognized and augmented when in 1974 you were elected unanimously presWent o7the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. With inteffigence and .magma ton you have gu ded this national organization in providing approximately 1850 member colleges, u~ Ind independent schools with programs that, in your words, “education needs from us. Through the wide spectrurrf of CASE activities-conferences and institutes, a variety of publications, monitoring of an reporting on federal legislation and regulations affecting education, and much more-your sound J“dg™ent devotion and energies have strengthened the member institutions and lncr“’ed ' ™s^kesman capabilities of their 8000 representatives. You recognize, too the importance of CASE s role as spokesma for education You have guided the organization in a formulation of the strengths an t e nee s o e u , and to a more eloquent presentation of those strengths and needs to the federal government and the AWhhagnreaU,Rapport and efficiency you have worked with professional staff and volunteer leadership written and spoken, traveled tirelessly. It is representative of your selfless service that you have called your place ^YolrprXweSreport thiTspriJencouraged those who speak for education to inspire.public “^nce bv speaking “of education and its aspirations in the language of the poet and the philosopher as well as the accountant^and the lawyer.” The effectiveness of your administration and the eloquence of your langu g , practical and poetic have helped education find its voice and have contributed immeasurably to that insp.ra^onTpubl confidence on which the future of education depends. Your own good sense and clear vision have served American education well. . Boston University is proud to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris can . https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Honorary Degree Hermann F. Eilts, doctor of laws Your interest in the Middle East began with your childhood stamp collection. By the time you began ad­ vanced international study, classmates recall, you knew more about the region than your professors. Your professional interests have developed as a rare combination of exacting scholarship and active diplomacy. Through more than thirty years in the foreign service, your careful and intelligent preparation for eac assignment and your absolute command of the relevant facts have inspired the respect of your colleagues and the governments to which you have been accredited. Seven years before you were named ambassador in 1965-the youngest career ambassador then in our diplomatic service-you received the Arthur S. Flemming Award for outstanding government service. Your leadership has been exemplary : seven junior officers who worked for you have gone on to serve our country as ambassadors. Your hallmarks are inexhaustible energy, perfect prose in drafts and dispatches, sheer mastery of the particulars of your postings, and a capacity for outlasting Secretaries of StateYour scholarship is as remarkable as your statesmanship.

Your career as a college administrator began in your native Maine with astonishing precocity: at nin«“nyou became Bursar of a junior college. Within a year, you were Secretary to the President. You had also enrolled as a student. Two years later, the President had become weary of summoning his right hand from the classroom, and you of leaving it at his summons. He thereupon petitioned h.s faculty for remedy, which they were pleased to grant. They examined you and certified without further classwork what no one could ever have doubted: your mastery of what were known down south at Boston University as the practical arts Wt Westbrook junior College to serve as an officer in the U.S. Navy for two years, Newly demobilized, you came to Boston University to pursue your education—one of the happiest of the y happy outcomes of the G.I.

After five years, you returned to your natural place: the Office of the President o which you have been the mainstay and sheet anchor through three incumbencies and a quarter of a century. From your earliest days there you displayed the ability that led President Case to write to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees: “I regret this mixup; but as Julia has been away from the office for the past few days, some mistakes have been inevitable. , ,, r . Your work has been largely out of the sight of the public, faculty, and students. It has, all too often been done in work weeks of a hundred hours.
