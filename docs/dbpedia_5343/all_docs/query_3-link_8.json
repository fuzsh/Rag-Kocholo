        "text": "1857 1827\n\nFRANK LEBBY STANTON\n\nTHIS OLD WORLD WE’RE LIVIN’IN\n\nIS MIGHTY HARD TO BEAT,\n\nYOU GET A THORN WITH EVERY ROSE\n\nBUT AIN’T THE ROSES SWEET!\n\nThe monument marking the grave of Frank Lebby Stanton is a massive rough-cut or rock-face granite monolith. On the face of the stone is a bronze with a bas-relief of the poet. The Atlanta Constitution issue on Friday, November 29, 1935, Page 3, tells the story:\n\n“Memorial to Poet Dedicated at West View Cemetery Grave.\n\n“The bronze tablet in memorial to Frank L. Stanton, first poet laureate of Georgia and for 40 years conductor of his column, “Just From Georgia,” on the editorial page of The Constitution, was unveiled yesterday morning at the grave in West View cemetery.\n\nLittle Emily McNelly, granddaughter of Dr. and Mrs. W. F. Melton, unveiled the marker in the absence of little Marcelle Stanton Magahee, granddaughter of the noted poet, who had been forbidden to leave the house by her doctor.\n\nDr. Melton presided as president of the Atlanta Writer’s Club. Brief eulogies were spoken by Hugh Howell, chairman of the state democratic executive committee, and by by Dr. M. D. Collins, state superintendent of schools on behalf of the state.\n\nR. L. Ramsey spoke for the Burns Club, while Mrs. Melton, president of the Atlanta Woman’s Club, paid a brief tribute on behalf of that organization.\n\nTarleton Collier spoke for Hearst’s Atlanta Georgian and Sunday American and Ralph T. Jones on behalf of The Constitution. Other speakers included Thomas J. Flanagan, negro poet, who was a protégé of Mr. Stanton’s.\n\nThe bronze marker is the work of Dr. Joseph Klein, Atlanta Sculptor. It carries a remarkable fine bas-relief likeness of Stanton, a book of verse and the laurel wreath symbolizing the poet laureate, while at the bottom are the lines which perhaps of all his writings, best typify Stanton’s philosophy of life:\n\n“This old world we’re livin’ in\n\nIs mighty hard to beat;\n\nYou get a thorn with every rose,\n\nBut ain’t the roses sweet?”"
