        "text": "POETS LIFE SPAN INDEX: 19TH CENTURY\n\nThis index shows the lifespan of most of the poets on our website who lived during the 1800s. Poets who were alive after 1910 are carried over to the 20th century chart. Poets born in the 1890s are on the 20th century chart, too.\n\nYou can see that many 19th century poets lived very long lives, such as Longfellow, Victor Hugo and Tennyson; others, such as Anne Bronte, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Paul Laurence Dunbar, had a much shorter time on this earth. The chart can also give you an idea of what historic events may have affected the poets' lives. You can see who lived during the Napoleonic Wars or the American Civil War. Poet Laura E. Richards was 10 years old when the Civil War began. She died two years after the Second World War began, at the age of 92."
