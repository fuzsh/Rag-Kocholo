        "text": "'I—\n\nMoving Picture Album\n\nRV ROBERT E. SHERWOOD.\n\nIN the Septembor issue of McCall's\n\nMagazine is an article by F W.\n\nMurnau. entitled. Films of the\n\nFuture.\"\n\nMr, Murnau. of course, is the\n\nGerman director of The Last Latich.\"\n\nwho was brought to America by Wil\n\nliam Fox and who. since his transplan\n\ntation from Berlin to Hollywood, has\n\nproduced one great picture. \"Sunrise.\"\n\nand is now completing a second. Five\n\nDevils.\"\n\nIn view of his record as a progressive\n\nforce in the movies. Mr. Murnau has a\n\ndistinct right to discuss the future de\n\nvelopment of his art and in Mr, Mur\n\nhau's case ;he silent drama does con\n\nstitute a legitimate art and one should\n\npay close attention to everything he\n\nmay have to say.\n\nUnfortunately, he doesn't say much\n\nHe docs not believe that the talking\n\npictures will ever supplant thos\" pan\n\ntomimic Aims which tell a story in com\n\nplete silence He feels certain that\n\nthere will be greater use of the form i\n\nthat he originated in \"The Last Laugh ' I\n\n—-the form that dispenses with all\n\nwords, including those phrased gaudily\n\nIn subtitles\n\nIn this respect. I think Mr. Murnau\n\nIs overop;imistic The Last Laugh ” j\n\nwas a freak, as has been proven by sub\n\nsequent attempts to imitate it. Thrre\n\n>re almost no stories that can be told\n\nwithout words, and even if there were\n\na sufficient number of these stories,\n\nthere would still be almost no direc\n\ntors competent to cope with them.\n\nA photoplay that is interrupted\n\n«'fr> 10 feet by a subtitle is not panto\n\nmime. any more than a lecture illus\n\ntrated with lantern slides is pantomime\n\nIn talking pictures, actual speech is\n\nSubstituted for the quotations printed\n\nin the subtitles and actual sounds are\n\nsubstituted for the v-eird and frequently ;\n\nIrrelevant noises made by the theater\n\norganists. Thus, the new talkie is bound\n\nto be more honest, as well as more ef\n\nfectivc. than the old silent one\n\nNevertheless, if Mr. Murnau wants to\n\nS’ 1 ahead and make some more 100 per\n\ncert silent pictures like \"The Last\n\nLaugh.” I. for one. earnestly hope his\n\nemployers will give him the oppor\n\ntunity to do so\n\nAs a work of art. ‘The Last Laugh\"\n\nStands head and shoulders above any\n\nwordy picture or play that has been\n\nproduced in the last 10 years.\n\nSit tit Jit lit\n\nMr. Murnau also believes that color\n\nfilm? will come into general fa’or and\n\nhe hints that a stereopticon device is\n\nhow in process of perfection which will\n\ngive the screen a new dimension. In\n\nfact, stereopticon pictures will practi- j\n\ntally do away with the flat screen. They\n\nSECRECY SHROUDS STUDIOS |\n\nAS “TALKIES\" ARE DEVELOPED\n\nBT MOLLIE MERRICK.\n\nHOLLYWOOD. Cahf. August 11.—\n\nMuch pussyfooting about the studios\n\nnon- With producers sinking fortunes\n\nin talking pictures, nobody is letting\n\nthe right hand know what the left hand\n\nIs doing.\n\nIdeas are precious In these early\n\ndays of the new picture development.\n\nIf the entire “talkie'’ craze proves to\n\nbe a bubble, then the producers with\n\nthe maximum of originality will clean\n\nup\n\nWriters ere forbidden to discuss\n\natones they ar® a* work upon, and\n\nactors are significantly silent regarding\n\nthe technzoue employed. No inside in\n\nformation is supposed to leak out. and\n\nvisitors are being kept off the sets.\n\nVoice experts have descended en\n\nmasse upon Hollywood. Scarcely a\n\nmovnnie has not included voice\n\ntraining along with the wearying hours\n\nof fencing, riding, shimming and gen\n\neral athletic regime.\n\nTalking has complicated thing? con\n\ntinently since the beginning of time.\n\nLocal talking rr.achin® agencies re- !\n\npert an unprecedented demand for re\n\ncording duos since the beginning of\n\nthe “talkie\" campaign\n\nMovie actors who have not had the\n\nmoral courage to take a voice test, lest\n\nthey be found wanting, are trying out\n\ntheir tones on the recording discs at\n\nhome.\n\nIf a studio test is made and rumor\n\ngets eround that it is not good, players\n\n£r.d the breaks\" hard to land.\n\nDorothy Swan is among the cinema\n\ngirls who have gene legitimate as a\n\nmeans cf preparing for the new work\n\nShe was one of the cast when Henry\n\nDuffy opened his second Hollywood\n\nth®9i®r a night or so ago.\n\nMovie Broadcasting\n\n'p'HROUGH J?* nf« 5.000-watt super- 1\n\npower radio broadcast station, KNX\n\nfor the flirt time its history the Para\n\nmount organization '*lll have oral con\n\ntact with millions of picture go-rs\n\nThe new station make* its debut on\n\nthe air early in September\n\nIt will be Paramount's policy, through\n\nthe medium of radio, to maintain close\n\ntouch with the thousands of exhibitors\n\nshowing Paramount pictures and to\n\nmake this super-power station a direct\n\nand valuable aid to them In addition.\n\nKNX v. ill keep them, as veil as the pub\n\nlic informed of the latest developments\n\nlr.

They did not guess that\n\n(hat was exactly what I was trying to\n\ndo, I wished Janet Gaynor to play,\n\nnot Janet Gaynor. the screen beauty, j\n\nbut a poor stupid little peasant girl. It\n\nwas a difficult thing, trying to suppress\n\nthis little actress's loveliness. But to\n\nme. beauty is not going to be the chief\n\nrequisite of the stars of the future.\n\nThey must photograph well, naturally, j\n\n; but it Is their sympathy, their under\n\nstanding of the heart and their ability i\n\nto show that understanding that will be ;\n\nimportant.\"\n\n** * *\n\nThes\" remarks of Mr. Murnau's bear\n\nout certain observations marie in this 1\n\ncolumn recently on the decline of the\n\nstar system i even pointed to Janet\n\nGaynor as an instance of a talented\n\nyoung lady who is now being developed\n\nas an actress rather than as a star\n\nIn th\" past, a star became so impor\n\ntant that he could pick his own roles >\n\nwithout consulting directors or even the\n\n' supervising executives. A male star,\n\nnaturally enough, would select only\n\nthose roles which gave him a chance\n\nto appear as an unmitigated hero. A\n\nfemale st.ar would select those roles that ;\n\nenabled her to wear the most becoming\n\nclothes,\n\nI hope that what Mr. Murnau says is\n\ntrue—that from now on it will be a\n\nmatter of persons rather than personali\n\n, ties. The finest actor on the American j\n\nstage today is Alfred Lunt. who might j\n\nwell qualify as a matinee idol if he j\n\nweren't more interested in qualifying as j\n\nan actor. Last year in one play Mr. i\n\nLunt wore copious whiskers, and in the :\n\nnext play he appeared as a bootlegger j\n\nwith pockmarked skin and a prominent\n\ngold tooth.\n\nWhy shouldn't the movie stars be as\n\nbroad minded! 5 Presumably because I\n\nthey feel it their duty to their millions j\n\nof admirers to appear always in that j\n\nstate of pristine loveliness with which\n\nGod has blessed them.\n\nIt will be a fine thing for the art of j\n\nthe moving picture if the stars can b* j\n\npersuaded to stop posing as themselves.\n\nt Copyright. 193* v j\n\n) Mcvieland folk attend these openings\n\nas enthusiastically as they do a motion\n\npicture first n:ght v Malcolm St. Clair,\n\nwho is to direct a \"talkiewas there, j\n\nAnd James Hall, who is to appear in *\n\none shortly.
