CLAIR ADAMS\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis is a volume of inspirational poems. Its purpose is to bring men courage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence when they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE DONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one poet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any one writer can show.\n\nIt is made up chiefly of very recent poems—not such as were written for anthologies of poetical \"gems,\" but such as speak directly to the heart, always in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office or street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the fine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.\n\nBesides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their understanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short comments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the pianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a point of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows. Also the lives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our natural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of living poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.\n\nFinally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be kept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or gloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may talk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent, it is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to some single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we desire.\n\nTo many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous permission to use copyright material.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAbou Ben Adhem………………………..

Gates\n\nIT CAN BE DONE\n\nBE THE BEST OF WHATEVER YOU ARE\n\nWe all dream of great deeds and high positions, away from the pettiness and humdrum of ordinary life. Yet success is not occupying a lofty place or doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you. Rattling around in too big a job is much worse than filling a small one to overflowing. Dream, aspire by all means; but do not ruin the life you must lead by dreaming pipe-dreams of the one you would like to lead. Make the most of what you have and are. Perhaps your trivial, immediate task is your one sure way of proving your mettle. Do the thing near at hand, and great things will come to your hand to be done.\n\nIf you can't be a pine on the top of the hill\n\nBe a scrub in the valley—but be\n\nThe best little scrub by the side of the rill;\n\nBe a bush if you can't be a tree.\n\nIf you can't be a bush be a bit of the grass,\n\nAnd some highway some happier make;\n\nIf you can't be a muskie then just be a bass—\n\nBut the liveliest bass in the lake!\n\nWe can't all be captains, we've got to be crew,\n\nThere's something for all of us here.\n\nThere's big work to do and there's lesser to do,\n\nAnd the task we must do is the near.\n\nIf you can't be a highway then just be a trail,\n\nIf you can't be the sun be a star;\n\nIt isn't by size that you win or you fail—\n\nBe the best of whatever you are!\n\nDouglas Malloch.\n\nTHE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD\n\nThis poem has as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people. It is a paradox of life that by hoarding love and happiness we lose them, and that only by giving them away can we keep them for ourselves. The more we share, the more we possess. We of course find in other people weaknesses and sins, but our best means of curing these are through a wise and sympathetic understanding.\n\nLet me live in a house by the side of the road,\n\nWhere the race of men go by—\n\nThe men who are good and the men who are bad,\n\nAs good and as bad as I.\n\nI would not sit in the scorner's seat,\n\nOr hurl the cynic's ban;—\n\nLet me live in a house by the side of the road\n\nAnd be a friend to man.\n\nI see from my house by the side of the road,\n\nBy the side of the highway of life,\n\nThe men who press with the ardor of hope,\n\nThe men who are faint with the strife.\n\nBut I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears—\n\nBoth parts of an infinite plan;—\n\nLet me live in my house by the side of the road\n\nAnd be a friend to man.\n\nI know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead\n\nAnd mountains of wearisome height;\n\nAnd the road passes on through the long afternoon\n\nAnd stretches away to the night.\n\nBut still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,\n\nAnd weep with the strangers that moan,\n\nNor live in my house by the side of the road\n\nLike a man who dwells alone.\n\nLet me live in my house by the side of the road\n\nWhere the race of men go by—\n\nThey are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,\n\nWise, foolish—so am I.\n\nThen why should I sit in the scorner's seat\n\nOr hurl the cynic's ban?—\n\nLet me live in my house by the side of the road\n\nAnd be a friend to man.\n\nSam Walter Foss.\n\nFrom \"Dreams in Homespun.\"\n\nFOUR THINGS\n\nWhat are the qualities of ideal manhood? Various people have given various answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he thinks indispensable.\n\nFour things a man must learn to do\n\nIf he would make his record true:\n\nTo think without confusion clearly;\n\nTo love his fellow-men sincerely;\n\nTo act from honest motives purely;\n\nTo trust in God and Heaven securely.\n\nHenry Van Dyke.\n\nFrom \"Collected Poems.\"\n\nIF\n\nThe central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control and a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man must not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his best to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking either triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely—and push on. In all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own the world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the full stature of manhood.\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr being lied about, don't deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated don't give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n\nAnd treat those two imposters just the same;\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them; \"Hold on!\"\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!\n\nRudyard Kipling.\n\nFrom \"Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918.\"\n\nINVICTUS\n\nTriumph in spirit over adverse conditions is the keynote of this poem of courage undismayed. It rings with the power of the individual to guide his own destiny.\n\nOut of the night that covers me,\n\nBlack as the Pit from pole to pole,\n\nI thank whatever gods may be\n\nFor my unconquerable soul.\n\nIn the fell clutch of circumstance\n\nI have not winced nor cried aloud.\n\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance\n\nMy head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\nBeyond this place of wrath and tears\n\nLooms but the Horror of the shade,\n\nAnd yet the menace of the years\n\nFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.\n\nIt matters not how strait the gate,\n\nHow charged with punishments the scroll,\n\nI am the master of my fate:\n\nI am the captain of my soul.\n\nWilliam Ernest Henley.\n\nIT COULDN'T BE DONE\n\nAfter a thing has been done, everybody is ready to declare it easy. But before it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people fear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the difficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks, but they shrink from what is to follow. Yet \"a thing begun is half done.\" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and ingenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance seem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is to take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less high. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the upper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the Alps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that encompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if you heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever with you the assurance It Can Be Done.\n\nSomebody said that it couldn't be done,\n\nBut he with a chuckle replied\n\nThat \"maybe it couldn't,\" but he would be one\n\nWho wouldn't say so till he'd tried.\n\nSo he buckled right in with the trace of a grin\n\nOn his face. If he worried he hid it.\n\nHe started to sing as he tackled the thing\n\nThat couldn't be done, and he did it.\n\nSomebody scoffed: \"Oh, you'll never do that;\n\nAt least no one ever has done it\";\n\nBut he took off his coat and he took off his hat,\n\nAnd the first thing we knew he'd begun it.\n\nWith a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,\n\nWithout any doubting or quiddit,\n\nHe started to sing as he tackled the thing\n\nThat couldn't be done, and he did it.\n\nThere are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,\n\nThere are thousands to prophesy failure;\n\nThere are thousands to point out to you one by one,\n\nThe dangers that wait to assail you.\n\nBut just buckle in with a bit of a grin,\n\nJust take off your coat and go to it;\n\nJust start to sing as you tackle the thing\n\nThat \"cannot be done,\" and you'll do it.\n\nEdgar A. Guest.\n\nFrom \"The Path to Home.\"\n\nTHE WELCOME MAN\n\nThere's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray; he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white; they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night; men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods; but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard—the world isn't yearning for such; and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods; so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad—for the One Who Delivers the Goods!\n\nWalt Mason.\n\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\n\nTHE QUITTER\n\nIn the famous naval duel between the Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis, John Paul Jones was hailed by his adversary to know whether he struck his colors. \"I have not yet begun to fight,\" was his answer. When the surrender took place, it was not Jones's ship that became the prize of war. Everybody admires a hard fighter—the man who takes buffets standing up, and in a spirit of \"Never say die\" is always ready for more.\n\nWhen you're lost in the wild and you're scared as a child,\n\nAnd death looks you bang in the eye;\n\nAnd you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle\n\nTo cock your revolver and die.\n\nBut the code of a man says fight all you can,\n\nAnd self-dissolution is barred;\n\nIn hunger and woe, oh it's easy to blow—\n\nIt's the hell served for breakfast that's hard.\n\nYou're sick of the game? Well now, that's a shame!\n\nYou're young and you're brave and you're bright.\n\nYou've had a raw deal, I know, but don't squeal.\n\nBuck up, do your damnedest and fight!\n\nIt's the plugging away that will win you the day,\n\nSo don't be a piker, old pard;\n\nJust draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit—\n\nIt's the keeping your chin up that's hard.\n\nIt's easy to cry that you're beaten and die,\n\nIt's easy to crawfish and crawl,\n\nBut to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight,\n\nWhy, that's the best game of them all.\n\nAnd though you come out of each grueling bout,\n\nAll broken and beaten and scarred—\n\nJust have one more try. It's dead easy to die,\n\nIt's the keeping on living that's hard.\n\nRobert W. Service.\n\nFrom \"Rhymes of a Rolling Stone.\"\n\n[Illustration: ROBERT WILLIAM SERVICE]\n\nFRIENDS OF MINE\n\nWe like to be hospitable. To what should we be more hospitable than a glad spirit or a kind impulse?\n\nGood-morning, Brother Sunshine,\n\nGood-morning, Sister Song,\n\nI beg your humble pardon\n\nIf you've waited very long.\n\nI thought I heard you rapping,\n\nTo shut you out were sin,\n\nMy heart is standing open,\n\nWon't you\n\nwalk\n\nright\n\nin?\n\nGood-morning, Brother Gladness,\n\nGood-morning, Sister Smile,\n\nThey told me you were coming,\n\nSo I waited on a while.\n\nI'm lonesome here without you,\n\nA weary while it's been,\n\nMy heart is standing open,\n\nWon't you\n\nwalk\n\nright\n\nin?\n\nGood-morning, Brother Kindness,\n\nGood-morning, Sister Cheer,\n\nI heard you were out calling,\n\nSo I waited for you here.\n\nSome way, I keep forgetting\n\nI have to toil or spin\n\nWhen you are my companions,\n\nWon't you\n\nwalk\n\nright\n\nin?\n\nJames W. Foley.\n\nFrom \"The Voices of Song.\"\n\nTHE WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS\n\n\"Is this the little woman that made this great war?\" was Lincoln's greeting to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Often a woman is responsible for events by whose crash and splendor she herself is obscured. Often too she shapes the career of husband or brother or son. A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause, when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance, \"You can, you must, you will.\"\n\nSomewhere she waits to make you win, your soul in her firm, white hands— Somewhere the gods have made for you, the Woman Who Understands!\n\nAs the tide went out she found him\n\nLashed to a spar of Despair,\n\nThe wreck of his Ship around him—\n\nThe wreck of his Dreams in the air;\n\nFound him and loved him and gathered\n\nThe soul of him close to her heart—\n\nThe soul that had sailed an uncharted sea,\n\nThe soul that had sought to win and be free—\n\nThe soul of which she was part!\n\nAnd there in the dusk she cried to the man,\n\n\"Win your battle—you can, you can!\"\n\nBroken by Fate, unrelenting,\n\nScarred by the lashings of Chance;\n\nBitter his heart—unrepenting—\n\nHardened by Circumstance;\n\nShadowed by Failure ever,\n\nCursing, he would have died,\n\nBut the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,\n\nAnd her love of his soul, took full command,\n\nJust at the turn of the tide!\n\nStanding beside him, filled with trust,\n\n\"Win!\" she whispered, \"you must, you must!\"\n\nHelping and loving and guiding,\n\nUrging when that were best,\n\nHolding her fears in hiding\n\nDeep in her quiet breast;\n\nThis is the woman who kept him\n\nTrue to his standards lost,\n\nWhen, tossed in the storm and stress of strife,\n\nHe thought himself through with the game of life\n\nAnd ready to pay the cost.\n\nWatching and guarding, whispering still,\n\n\"Win you can—and you will, you will!\"\n\nThis is the story of ages,\n\nThis is the Woman's way;\n\nWiser than seers or sages,\n\nLifting us day by day;\n\nFacing all things with a courage\n\nNothing can daunt or dim,\n\nTreading Life's path, wherever it leads—\n\nLined with flowers or choked with weeds,\n\nBut ever with him—with him!\n\nGuidon—comrade—golden spur—\n\nThe men who win are helped by her!\n\nSomewhere she waits, strong in belief, your soul in her firm, white hands: Thank well the gods, when she comes to you—the Woman Who Understands!\n\nEverard Jack Appleton.\n\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\n\nWANTED—A MAN\n\nBusiness and the world are exacting in their demands upon us. They make no concessions to half-heartedness, incompetence, or plodding mediocrity. But for the man who has proved his worth and can do the exceptional things with originality and sound judgment, they are eagerly watchful and have rich rewards.\n\nYou say big corporations scheme\n\nTo keep a fellow down;\n\nThey drive him, shame him, starve him too\n\nIf he so much as frown.\n\nGod knows I hold no brief for them;\n\nStill, come with me to-day\n\nAnd watch those fat directors meet,\n\nFor this is what they say:\n\n\"In all our force not one to take\n\nThe new work that we plan!\n\nIn all the thousand men we've hired\n\nWhere shall we find a man?\"\n\nThe world is shabby in the way\n\nIt treats a fellow too;\n\nIt just endures him while he works,\n\nAnd kicks him when he's through.\n\nIt's ruthless, yes; let him make good,\n\nOr else it grabs its broom\n\nAnd grumbles: \"What a clutter's here!\n\nWe can't have this. Make room!\"\n\nAnd out he goes. It says, \"Can bread\n\nBe made from mouldy bran?\n\nThe men come swarming here in droves,\n\nBut where'll I find a man?\"\n\nYes, life is hard. But all the same\n\nIt seeks the man who's best.\n\nIts grudging makes the prizes big;\n\nThe obstacle's a test.\n\nDon't ask to find the pathway smooth,\n\nTo march to fife and drum;\n\nThe plum-tree will not come to you;\n\nJack Horner, hunt the plum.\n\nThe eyes of life are yearning, sad,\n\nAs humankind they scan.\n\nShe says, \"Oh, there are men enough,\n\nBut where'll I find a man?\"\n\nSt. Clair Adams.\n\nIF I SHOULD DIE\n\nA man whose word is as good as his bond is a man the world admires. It is related of Fox that a tradesman whom he long had owed money found him one day counting gold and asked for payment. Fox replied: \"No; I owe this money to Sheridan. It is a debt of honor. If an accident should happen to me, he has nothing to show.\" The tradesman tore his note to pieces: \"I change my debt into a debt of honor.\" Fox thanked him and handed over the money, saying that Sheridan's debt was not of so long standing and that Sheridan must wait. But most of us know men who are less scrupulous than Fox.\n\nIf I should die to-night\n\nAnd you should come to my cold corpse and say,\n\nWeeping and heartsick o'er my lifeless clay—\n\nIf I should die to-night,\n\nAnd you should come in deepest grief and woe—\n\nAnd say: \"Here's that ten dollars that I owe,\"\n\nI might arise in my large white cravat\n\nAnd say, \"What's that?\"\n\nIf I should die to-night\n\nAnd you should come to my cold corpse and kneel,\n\nClasping my bier to show the grief you feel,\n\nI say, if I should die to-night\n\nAnd you should come to me, and there and then\n\nJust even hint 'bout payin' me that ten,\n\nI might arise the while,\n\nBut I'd drop dead again.\n\nBen King.\n\nFrom \"Ben King's Verse.\"\n\nJUST BE GLAD\n\nMisfortunes overtake us, difficulties confront us; but these things must not induce us to give up. A Congressman who had promised Thomas B. Reed to be present at a political meeting telegraphed at the last moment: \"Cannot come; washout on the line.\" \"No need to stay away,\" said Reed's answering telegram; \"buy another shirt.\"\n\nO heart of mine, we shouldn't\n\nWorry so!\n\nWhat we've missed of calm we couldn't\n\nHave, you know!\n\nWhat we've met of stormy pain,\n\nAnd of sorrow's driving rain,\n\nWe can better meet again,\n\nIf it blow!\n\nWe have erred in that dark hour\n\nWe have known,\n\nWhen our tears fell with the shower,\n\nAll alone!—\n\nWere not shine and shower blent\n\nAs the gracious Master meant?—\n\nLet us temper our content\n\nWith His own.\n\nFor, we know, not every morrow\n\nCan be sad;\n\nSo, forgetting all the sorrow\n\nWe have had,\n\nLet us fold away our fears,\n\nAnd put by our foolish tears,\n\nAnd through all the coming years\n\nJust be glad.\n\nJames Whitcomb Riley.\n\nFrom the Biographical Edition Of the\n\nComplete Works of James Whitcomb Riley.\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\n\"I lack only one of having a hundred,\" said a student after an examination; \"I have the two naughts.\" And all he did lack was a one, rightly placed. The world is full of opportunities. Discernment to perceive, courage to undertake, patience to carry through, will change the whole aspect of the universe for us and bring positive achievement out of meaningless negation.\n\nWith doubt and dismay you are smitten\n\nYou think there's no chance for you, son?\n\nWhy, the best books haven't been written\n\nThe best race hasn't been run,\n\nThe best score hasn't been made yet,\n\nThe best song hasn't been sung,\n\nThe best tune hasn't been played yet,\n\nCheer up, for the world is young!\n\nNo chance? Why the world is just eager\n\nFor things that you ought to create\n\nIts store of true wealth is still meagre\n\nIts needs are incessant and great,\n\nIt yearns for more power and beauty\n\nMore laughter and love and romance,\n\nMore loyalty, labor and duty,\n\nNo chance—why there's nothing but chance!\n\nFor the best verse hasn't been rhymed yet,\n\nThe best house hasn't been planned,\n\nThe highest peak hasn't been climbed yet,\n\nThe mightiest rivers aren't spanned,\n\nDon't worry and fret, faint hearted,\n\nThe chances have just begun,\n\nFor the Best jobs haven't been started,\n\nThe Best work hasn't been done.\n\nBerton Braley.\n\nFrom \"A Banjo at Armageddon.\"\n\nSOLITUDE\n\nSaid an Irishman who had several times been kicked downstairs: \"I begin to think they don't want me around here.\" So it is with our sorrows, our struggles. Life decrees that they belong to us individually. If we try to make others share them, we are shunned. But struggling and weary humanity is glad enough to share our joys.\n\nLaugh, and the world laughs with you;\n\nWeep, and you weep alone;\n\nFor the sad old earth\n\nMust borrow its mirth,\n\nIt has trouble enough of its own.\n\nSing, and the hills will answer;\n\nSigh, it is lost on the air;\n\nThe echoes bound\n\nTo a joyful sound,\n\nBut shrink from voicing care.\n\nRejoice, and men will seek you;\n\nGrieve, and they turn and go;\n\nThey want full measure\n\nOf all your pleasure,\n\nBut they do not want your woe.\n\nBe glad, and your friends are many;\n\nBe sad, and you lose them all;\n\nThere are none to decline\n\nYour nectared wine,\n\nBut alone you must drink life's gall.\n\nFeast, and your halls are crowded;\n\nFast, and the world goes by;\n\nSucceed and give,\n\nAnd it helps you live,\n\nBut it cannot help you die.\n\nThere is room in the halls of pleasure\n\nFor a long and lordly train;\n\nBut one by one\n\nWe must all file on\n\nThrough the narrow aisles of pain.\n\nElla Wheeler Wilcox.\n\nFrom \"How Salvator Won.\"\n\nUNSUBDUED\n\n\"An artist's career,\" said Whistler, \"always begins to-morrow.\" So does the career of any man of courage and imagination. The Eden of such a man does not lie in yesterday. If he has done well, he forgets his achievements and dreams of the big deeds ahead. If he has been thwarted, he forgets his failures and looks forward to vast, sure successes. If fate itself opposes him, he defies it. Farragut's fleet was forcing an entrance into Mobile Bay. One of the vessels struck something, a terrific explosion followed, the vessel went down. \"Torpedoes, sir.\" They scanned the face of the commander-in-chief. But Farragut did not hesitate. \"Damn the torpedoes,\" said he. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nI have hoped, I have planned, I have striven,\n\nTo the will I have added the deed;\n\nThe best that was in me I've given,\n\nI have prayed, but the gods would not heed.\n\nI have dared and reached only disaster,\n\nI have battled and broken my lance;\n\nI am bruised by a pitiless master\n\nThat the weak and the timid call Chance.\n\nI am old, I am bent, I am cheated\n\nOf all that Youth urged me to win;\n\nBut name me not with the defeated,\n\nTo-morrow again, I begin.\n\nS.E. Kiser.\n\nFrom \"Poems That Have Helped Me.\"\n\nWORK\n\n\"A SONG OF TRIUMPH\"\n\nWhen Captain John Smith was made the leader of the colonists at Jamestown, Va., he discouraged the get-rich-quick seekers of gold by announcing flatly, \"He who will not work shall not eat.\" This rule made of Jamestown the first permanent English settlement in the New World. But work does more than lead to material success. It gives an outlet from sorrow, restrains wild desires, ripens and refines character, enables human beings to cooperate with God, and when well done, brings to life its consummate satisfaction. Every man is a Prince of Possibilities, but by work alone can he come into his Kingship.\n\nWork!\n\nThank God for the might of it,\n\nThe ardor, the urge, the delight of it—\n\nWork that springs from the heart's desire,\n\nSetting the brain and the soul on fire—\n\nOh, what is so good as the heat of it,\n\nAnd what is so glad as the beat of it,\n\nAnd what is so kind as the stern command,\n\nChallenging brain and heart and hand?\n\nWork!\n\nThank God for the pride of it,\n\nFor the beautiful, conquering tide of it.\n\nSweeping the life in its furious flood,\n\nThrilling the arteries, cleansing the blood,\n\nMastering stupor and dull despair,\n\nMoving the dreamer to do and dare.\n\nOh, what is so good as the urge of it,\n\nAnd what is so glad as the surge of it,\n\nAnd what is so strong as the summons deep,\n\nRousing the torpid soul from sleep?\n\nWork!\n\nThank God for the pace of it,\n\nFor the terrible, keen, swift race of it;\n\nFiery steeds in full control,\n\nNostrils a-quiver to greet the goal.\n\nWork, the Power that drives behind,\n\nGuiding the purposes, taming the mind,\n\nHolding the runaway wishes back,\n\nReining the will to one steady track,\n\nSpeeding the energies faster, faster,\n\nTriumphing over disaster.\n\nOh, what is so good as the pain of it,\n\nAnd what is so great as the gain of it?\n\nAnd what is so kind as the cruel goad,\n\nForcing us on through the rugged road?\n\nWork!\n\nThank God for the swing of it,\n\nFor the clamoring, hammering ring of it,\n\nPassion and labor daily hurled\n\nOn the mighty anvils of the world.\n\nOh, what is so fierce as the flame of it?\n\nAnd what is so huge as the aim of it?\n\nThundering on through dearth and doubt,\n\nCalling the plan of the Maker out.\n\nWork, the Titan; Work, the friend,\n\nShaping the earth to a glorious end,\n\nDraining the swamps and blasting the hills,\n\nDoing whatever the Spirit wills—\n\nRending a continent apart,\n\nTo answer the dream of the Master heart.\n\nThank God for a world where none may shirk—\n\nThank God for the splendor of work!\n\nAngela Morgan.\n\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\n\nHOW DID YOU DIE?\n\nGrant at Ft. Donelson demanded unconditional and immediate surrender. At Appomattox he offered as lenient terms as victor ever extended to vanquished. Why the difference? The one event was at the beginning of the war, when the enemy's morale must be shaken. The other was at the end of the conflict, when a brave and noble adversary had been rendered helpless. In his quiet way Grant showed himself one of nature's gentlemen. He also taught a great lesson. No honor can be too great for the man, be he even our foe, who has steadily and uncomplainingly done his very best—and has failed.\n\nDid you tackle that trouble that came your way\n\nWith a resolute heart and cheerful?\n\nOr hide your face from the light of day\n\nWith a craven soul and fearful?\n\nOh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,\n\nOr a trouble is what you make it,\n\nAnd it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,\n\nBut only how did you take it?\n\nYou are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that!\n\nCome up with a smiling face.\n\nIt's nothing against you to fall down flat,\n\nBut to lie there—that's disgrace.\n\nThe harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce\n\nBe proud of your blackened eye!\n\nIt isn't the fact that you're licked that counts;\n\nIt's how did you fight—and why?\n\nAnd though you be done to the death, what then?\n\nIf you battled the best you could,\n\nIf you played your part in the world of men,\n\nWhy, the Critic will call it good.\n\nDeath comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,\n\nAnd whether he's slow or spry,\n\nIt isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,\n\nBut only how did you die?\n\nEdmund Vance Cooke.\n\nFrom \"Impertinent Poems.\"\n\nA LESSON FROM HISTORY\n\nTo break the ice of an undertaking is difficult. To cross on broken ice, as Eliza did to freedom, or to row amid floating ice, as Washington did to victory, is harder still. This poem applies especially to those who are discouraged in a struggle to which they are already committed.\n\nEverything's easy after it's done;\n\nEvery battle's a \"cinch\" that's won;\n\nEvery problem is clear that's solved—\n\nThe earth was round when it revolved!\n\nBut Washington stood amid grave doubt\n\nWith enemy forces camped about;\n\nHe could not know how he would fare\n\nTill after he'd crossed the Delaware.\n\nThough the river was full of ice\n\nHe did not think about it twice,\n\nBut started across in the dead of night,\n\nThe enemy waiting to open the fight.\n\nLikely feeling pretty blue,\n\nBeing human, same as you,\n\nBut he was brave amid despair,\n\nAnd Washington crossed the Delaware!\n\nSo when you're with trouble beset,\n\nAnd your spirits are soaking wet,\n\nWhen all the sky with clouds is black,\n\nDon't lie down upon your back\n\nAnd look at them. Just do the thing;\n\nThough you are choked, still try to sing.\n\nIf times are dark, believe them fair,\n\nAnd you will cross the Delaware!\n\nJoseph Morris.\n\nRABBI BEN EZRA\n\n(SELECTED VERSES)\n\nTo some people success is everything, and the easier it is gained the better. To Browning success is nothing unless it is won by painful effort. What Browning values is struggle. Throes, rebuffs, even failure to achieve what we wish, are to be welcomed, for the effects of vigorous endeavor inweave themselves into our characters; moreover through struggle we lift ourselves from the degradation into which the indolent fall. In the intervals of strife we may look back dispassionately upon what we have gone through, see where we erred and where we did wisely, watch the workings of universal laws, and resolve to apply hereafter what we have hitherto learned.\n\nThen, welcome each rebuff\n\nThat turns earth's smoothness rough,\n\nEach sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!\n\nBe our joys three-parts pain!\n\nStrive, and hold cheap the strain;\n\nLearn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!\n\nFor thence,—a paradox\n\nWhich comforts while it mocks,—\n\nShall life succeed in that it seems to fail:\n\nWhat I aspired to be,\n\nAnd was not, comforts me:\n\nA brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.\n\nSo, still within this life,\n\nThough lifted o'er its strife,\n\nLet me discern, compare, pronounce at last,\n\n\"This rage was right i' the main,\n\nThat acquiescence vain:\n\nThe Future I may face now I have proved the Past.\"\n\nFor more is not reserved\n\nTo man, with soul just nerved\n\nTo act to-morrow what he learns to-day:\n\nHere, work enough to watch\n\nThe Master work, and catch\n\nHints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play.\n\nRobert Browning.\n\nTO MELANCHOLY\n\nThe last invitation anybody would accept is \"Come, let us weep together.\" If we keep melancholy at our house, we should be careful to have it under lock and key, so that no one will observe it.\n\nMelancholy,\n\nMelancholy,\n\nI've no use for you, by Golly!\n\nYet I'm going to keep you hidden\n\nIn some chamber dark, forbidden,\n\nJust as though you were a prize, sir,\n\nMade of gold, and I a miser—\n\nNot because I think you jolly,\n\nMelancholy!\n\nNot for that I mean to hoard you,\n\nKeep you close and lodge and board you\n\nAs I would my sisters, brothers,\n\nCousins, aunts, and old grandmothers,\n\nBut that you shan't bother others\n\nWith your sniffling, snuffling folly,\n\nHowling,\n\nYowling,\n\nMelancholy.\n\nJohn Kendrick Bangs.\n\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\n\nTHE LION PATH\n\nAdmiral Dupont was explaining to Farragut his reasons for not taking his ironclads into Charleston harbor. \"You haven't given me the main reason yet,\" said Farragut. \"What's that?\" \"You didn't think you could do it.\" So the man who thinks he can't pass a lion, can't. But the man who thinks he can, can. Indeed he oftentimes finds that the lion isn't really there at all.\n\nI dare not!—\n\nLook! the road is very dark—\n\nThe trees stir softly and the bushes shake,\n\nThe long grass rustles, and the darkness moves\n\nHere! there! beyond—!\n\nThere's something crept across the road just now!\n\nAnd you would have me go—?\n\nGo there, through that live darkness, hideous\n\nWith stir of crouching forms that wait to kill?\n\nAh, look! See there! and there! and there again!\n\nGreat yellow, glassy eyes, close to the ground!\n\nLook! Now the clouds are lighter I can see\n\nThe long slow lashing of the sinewy tails,\n\nAnd the set quiver of strong jaws that wait—!\n\nGo there? Not I! Who dares to go who sees\n\nSo perfectly the lions in the path?\n\nComes one who dares.\n\nAfraid at first, yet bound\n\nOn such high errand as no fear could stay.\n\nForth goes he, with lions in his path.\n\nAnd then—?\n\nHe dared a death of agony—\n\nOutnumbered battle with the king of beasts—\n\nLong struggles in the horror of the night—\n\nDared, and went forth to meet—O ye who fear!\n\nFinding an empty road, and nothing there—\n\nAnd fences, and the dusty roadside trees—\n\nSome spitting kittens, maybe, in the grass.\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman.\n\nFrom \"In This Our World.\"\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nBob Fitzsimmons lacked the physical bulk of the men he fought, was ungainly in build and movement, and not infrequently got himself floored in the early rounds of his contests. But many people consider him the best fighter for his weight who ever stepped into the prize ring. Not a favorite at first, he won the popular heart by making good. Of course he had great natural powers; from any position when the chance at last came he could dart forth a sudden, wicked blow that no human being could withstand. But more formidable still was the spirit which gave him cool and complete command of all his resources, and made him most dangerous when he was on the verge of being knocked out.\n\nWhen the battle breaks against you and the crowd forgets to cheer\n\nWhen the Anvil Chorus echoes with the essence of a jeer;\n\nWhen the knockers start their panning in the knocker's nimble way\n\nWith a rap for all your errors and a josh upon your play—\n\nThere is one quick answer ready that will nail them on the wing;\n\nThere is one reply forthcoming that will wipe away the sting;\n\nThere is one elastic come-back that will hold them, as it should—\n\nMake good.\n\nNo matter where you finish in the mix-up or the row,\n\nThere are those among the rabble who will pan you anyhow;\n\nBut the entry who is sticking and delivering the stuff\n\nCan listen to the yapping as he giggles up his cuff;\n\nThe loafer has no come-back and the quitter no reply\n\nWhen the Anvil Chorus echoes, as it will, against the sky;\n\nBut there's one quick answer ready that will wrap them in a hood—\n\nMake good.\n\nGrantland Rice.\n\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\n\nTHE WORLD IS AGAINST ME\n\nBabe Ruth doesn't complain that opposing pitchers try to strike him out; he swings at the ball till he swats it for four bases.

What other men can do any man can do if he works long enough with a brave enough heart.\n\n\"The world is against me,\" he said with a sigh.\n\n\"Somebody stops every scheme that I try.\n\nThe world has me down and it's keeping me there;\n\nI don't get a chance.

Guest.\n\nFrom \"Just Folks.\"\n\nSAY NOT THE STRUGGLE NOUGHT AVAILETH\n\nIn any large or prolonged enterprise we are likely to take too limited a view of the progress we are making. The obstacles do not yield at some given point; we therefore imagine we have made no headway. The poet here uses three comparisons to show the folly of accepting this hasty and partial evidence. A soldier may think, from the little part of the battle he can see, that the day is going against him; but by holding his ground stoutly he may help his comrades in another quarter to win the victory. Successive waves may seem to rise no higher on the land, but far back in swollen creek and inlet is proof that the tide is coming in. As we look toward the east, we are discouraged at the slowness of daybreak; but by looking westward we see the whole landscape illumined.\n\nSay not the struggle nought availeth,\n\nThe labor and the wounds are vain,\n\nThe enemy faints not, nor faileth,\n\nAnd as things have been they remain.\n\nIf hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;\n\nIt may be, in yon smoke conceal'd,\n\nYour comrades chase e'en now the fliers,\n\nAnd, but for you, possess the field.\n\nFor while the tired waves, vainly breaking,\n\nSeem here no painful inch to gain,\n\nFar back, through creeks and inlets making,\n\nComes silent, flooding in, the main.\n\nAnd not by eastern windows only,\n\nWhen daylight comes, comes in the light,\n\nIn front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,\n\nBut westward, look, the land is bright.\n\nArthur Hugh Clough.\n\nWORTH WHILE\n\nA little boy whom his mother had rebuked for not turning a deaf ear to temptation protested, with tears, that he had no deaf ear. But temptation, even when heard, must somehow be resisted. Yea, especially when heard! We deserve no credit for resisting it unless it comes to our ears like the voice of the siren.\n\nIt is easy enough to be pleasant,\n\nWhen life flows by like a song,\n\nBut the man worth while is one who will smile,\n\nWhen everything goes dead wrong.\n\nFor the test of the heart is trouble,\n\nAnd it always comes with the years,\n\nAnd the smile that is worth the praises of earth,\n\nIs the smile that shines through tears.\n\nIt is easy enough to be prudent,\n\nWhen nothing tempts you to stray,\n\nWhen without or within no voice of sin\n\nIs luring your soul away;\n\nBut it's only a negative virtue\n\nUntil it is tried by fire,\n\nAnd the life that is worth the honor on earth,\n\nIs the one that resists desire.\n\nBy the cynic, the sad, the fallen,\n\nWho had no strength for the strife,\n\nThe world's highway is cumbered to-day,\n\nThey make up the sum of life.\n\nBut the virtue that conquers passion,\n\nAnd the sorrow that hides in a smile,\n\nIt is these that are worth the homage on earth\n\nFor we find them but once in a while.\n\nElla Wheeler Wilcox.\n\nFrom \"Poems of Sentiment.\"\n\nHOPE\n\nGloom and despair are really ignorance in another form. They fail to reckon with the fact that what appears to be baneful often turns out to be good. Lincoln lost the senatorship to Douglas and thought he had ended his career; had he won the contest, he might have remained only a senator. Life often has surprise parties for us. Things come to us masked in gloom and black; but Time, the revealer, strips off the disguise, and lo, what we have is blessings.\n\nNever go gloomy, man with a mind,\n\nHope is a better companion than fear;\n\nProvidence, ever benignant and kind,\n\nGives with a smile what you take with a tear;\n\nAll will be right,\n\nLook to the light.\n\nMorning was ever the daughter of night;\n\nAll that was black will be all that is bright,\n\nCheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\n\nMany a foe is a friend in disguise,\n\nMany a trouble a blessing most true,\n\nHelping the heart to be happy and wise,\n\nWith love ever precious and joys ever new.\n\nStand in the van,\n\nStrike like a man!\n\nThis is the bravest and cleverest plan;\n\nTrusting in God while you do what you can.\n\nCheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\n\nAnonymous.\n\nI'M GLAD\n\nI'm glad the sky is painted blue;\n\nAnd the earth is painted green;\n\nAnd such a lot of nice fresh air\n\nAll sandwiched in between.\n\nAnonymous.\n\nTHE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS\n\nThe nautilus is a small mollusk that creeps upon the bottom of the sea, though it used to be supposed to swim, or even to spread a kind of sail so that the wind might drive it along the surface. What interests us in this poem is the way the nautilus grows. Just as a tree when sawed down has the record of its age in the number of its rings, so does the nautilus measure its age by the ever-widening compartments of its shell. These it has successively occupied. The poet, looking upon the now empty shell, thinks of human life as growing in the same way. We advance from one state of being to another, each nobler than the one which preceded it, until the spirit leaves its shell altogether and attains a glorious and perfect freedom.\n\nThis is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,\n\nSailed the unshadowed main,—\n\nThe venturous bark that flings\n\nOn the sweet summer wind its purpled wings\n\nIn gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,\n\nAnd coral reefs lie bare,\n\nWhere the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.\n\nIts webs of living gauze no more unfurl;\n\nWrecked is the ship of pearl!\n\nAnd every chambered cell,\n\nWhere its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,\n\nAs the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,\n\nBefore thee lies revealed,—\n\nIts irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!\n\nYear after year beheld the silent toil\n\nThat spread his lustrous coil;\n\nStill, as the spiral grew,\n\nHe left the past year's dwelling for the new,\n\nStole with soft step its shining archway through,\n\nBuilt up its idle door,\n\nStretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.\n\nThanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,\n\nChild of the wandering sea,\n\nCast from her lap, forlorn!\n\nFrom thy dead lips a clearer note is born\n\nThan ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!\n\nWhile on mine ear it rings,\n\nThrough the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—\n\nBuild thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\n\nAs the swift seasons roll!\n\nLeave thy low-vaulted past!\n\nLet each new temple, nobler than the last,\n\nShut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\n\nTill thou at length art free,\n\nLeaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nPIPPA'S SONG\n\nThis little song vibrates with an optimism that embraces the whole universe. A frequent error in quoting it is the substitution of the word well for right. Browning is no such shallow optimist as to believe that all is well with the world, but he does maintain that things are right with the world, for in spite of its present evils it is slowly working its way toward perfection, and in the great scheme of things it may make these evils themselves an instrument to move it toward its ultimate goal.\n\nThe year's at the spring\n\nAnd day's at the morn;\n\nMorning's at seven;\n\nThe hillside's dew-pearled;\n\nThe lark's on the wing;\n\nThe snail's on the thorn;\n\nGod's in his heaven—\n\nAll's right with the world.\n\nRobert Browning.\n\nOWNERSHIP\n\nThe true value of anything lies, not in the object itself or in its legal possession, but in our attitude to it. We may own a thing in fee simple, yet derive from it nothing but vexation. For those who have little, as indeed for those who have much, there are no surer means of happiness than enjoying that which they do not possess. Emerson shows us that two harvests may be gathered from every field—a material one by the man who raised the crop, and an esthetic or spiritual one by whosoever can see beauty or thrill with an inner satisfaction.\n\nThey ride in Packards, those swell guys,\n\nWhile I can't half afford a Ford;\n\nChoice fillets fill a void for them,\n\nWe've cheese and prunes the place I board;\n\nThey've smirking servants hanging round,\n\nYou'd guess by whom my shoes are shined.\n\nBut all the same I'm rich as they,\n\nFor ownership's a state of mind.\n\nThey own, you say? Pshaw, they possess!\n\nAnd what a fellow has, has him!\n\nThe rich can't stop and just enjoy\n\nTheir lawns and shrubs and house-fronts trim.\n\nThey're tied indoors and foot the bills;\n\nI stroll or stray, as I'm inclined—\n\nPossession was not meant for use,\n\nBut ownership's a state of mind.\n\nThe folks who have must try to keep\n\nAgainst the thieves who swarm and steal;\n\nThey dare not stride, they mince along—\n\nTheir pavement's a banana peel.\n\nWho owns, the jeweler or I,\n\nYon gems by window-bars confined?\n\nPossession lies in locks and keys;\n\nTrue ownership's a state of mind.\n\nI own my office (I've a boss,\n\nBut so have all men—so has he);\n\nThe business is not mine, but yet\n\nI own the whole blamed company;\n\nStockholders are less proud than I\n\nWhen competition's auld lang syned.\n\nWhat care I that the profit's theirs?\n\nI have what counts—an owner's mind.\n\nThe pretty girls I meet are mine\n\n(I do not choose to tell them so);\n\nI own the flowers, the trees, the birds;\n\nI own the sunshine and the snow;\n\nI own the block, I own the town—\n\nThe smiles, the songs of humankind.\n\nFor ownership is how you feel;\n\nIt's just a healthy state of mind.\n\nSt. Clair Adams.\n\nA SMILING PARADOX\n\nGood nature or ill is like the loaves and fishes. The more we give away, the more we have.\n\nI've squandered smiles to-day,\n\nAnd, strange to say,\n\nAltho' my frowns with care I've stowed away,\n\nTo-night I'm poorer far in frowns than at the start;\n\nWhile in my heart,\n\nWherein my treasures best I store,\n\nI find my smiles increased by several score.\n\nJohn Kendrick Bangs.\n\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\n\nTHE NEW DUCKLING\n\nThere are people who, without having anything exceptional in their natures or purposes or visions, yet try to be different for the sake of being different. They are not content to be what they are; they wish to be \"utterly other.\" Of course they are hollow, artificial, insincere; moreover they are nuisances. Their very foundations are wrong ones. Be yourself unless you're a fool; in that case, of course, try to be somebody else.\n\n\"I want to be new,\" said the duckling.\n\n\"O ho!\" said the wise old owl,\n\nWhile the guinea-hen cluttered off chuckling\n\nTo tell all the rest of the fowl.\n\n\"I should like a more elegant figure,\"\n\nThat child of a duck went on.\n\n\"I should like to grow bigger and bigger,\n\nUntil I could swallow a swan.\n\n\"I won't be the bond slave of habit,\n\nI won't have these webs on my toes.\n\nI want to run round like a rabbit,\n\nA rabbit as red as a rose.\n\n\"I don't want to waddle like mother,\n\nOr quack like my silly old dad.\n\nI want to be utterly other,\n\nAnd frightfully modern and mad.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the turkey, \"you're quacking!\n\nThere's a fox creeping up thro' the rye;\n\nAnd, if you're not utterly lacking,\n\nYou'll make for that duck-pond. Good-bye!\"\n\nBut the duckling was perky as perky.\n\n\"Take care of your stuffing!\" he called.\n\n(This was horribly rude to a turkey!)\n\n\"But you aren't a real turkey,\" he bawled.\n\n\"You're an Early-Victorian Sparrow!\n\nA fox is more fun than a sheep!\n\nI shall show that my mind is not narrow\n\nAnd give him my feathers—to keep.\"\n\nNow the curious end of this fable,\n\nSo far as the rest ascertained,\n\nThough they searched from the barn to the stable,\n\nWas that only his feathers remained.\n\nSo he wasn't the bond slave of habit,\n\nAnd he didn't have webs on his toes;\n\nAnd perhaps he runs round like a rabbit,\n\nA rabbit as red as a rose.\n\nAlfred Noyes.\n\nFrom \"Collected Poems.\"\n\nCAN YOU SING A SONG?\n\nNothing lifts the spirit more than a song, especially the inward song of a worker who can sound it alike at the beginning of his task, in the heat of midday, and in the weariness and cool of the evening.\n\nCan you sing a song to greet the sun,\n\nCan you cheerily tackle the work to be done,\n\nCan you vision it finished when only begun,\n\nCan you sing a song?\n\nCan you sing a song when the day's half through,\n\nWhen even the thought of the rest wearies you,\n\nWith so little done and so much to do,\n\nCan you sing a song?\n\nCan you sing a song at the close of the day,\n\nWhen weary and tired, the work's put away,\n\nWith the joy that it's done the best of the pay,\n\nCan you sing a song?\n\nJoseph Morris.\n\nKNOW THYSELF\n\nIt seems impossible that human beings could endure so much until we realize that they have endured it. The spirit of man performs miracles; it transcends the limitations of flesh and blood. It is like Uncle Remus's account of Brer Rabbit climbing a tree. \"A rabbit couldn't do that,\" the little boy protested. \"He did,\" Uncle Remus responded; \"he was jes' 'bleeged to.\"\n\nReined by an unseen tyrant's hand,\n\nSpurred by an unseen tyrant's will,\n\nAquiver at the fierce command\n\nThat goads you up the danger hill,\n\nYou cry: \"O Fate, O Life, be kind!\n\nGrant but an hour of respite—give\n\nOne moment to my suffering mind!\n\nI can not keep the pace and live.\"\n\nBut Fate drives on and will not heed\n\nThe lips that beg, the feet that bleed.\n\nDrives, while you faint upon the road,\n\nDrives, with a menace for a goad;\n\nWith fiery reins of circumstance\n\nUrging his terrible advance\n\nThe while you cry in your despair,\n\n\"The pain is more than I can bear!\"\n\nFear not the goad, fear not the pace,\n\nPlead not to fall from out the race—\n\nIt is your own Self driving you,\n\nYour Self that you have never known,\n\nSeeing your little self alone.\n\nYour Self, high-seated charioteer,\n\nMaster of cowardice and fear,\n\nYour Self that sees the shining length\n\nOf all the fearful road ahead,\n\nKnows that the terrors that you dread\n\nAre pigmies to your splendid strength;\n\nStrength you have never even guessed,\n\nStrength that has never needed rest.\n\nYour Self that holds the mastering rein,\n\nSeeing beyond the sweat and pain\n\nAnd anguish of your driven soul,\n\nThe patient beauty of the goal!\n\nFighting upon the terror field\n\nWhere man and Fate came breast to breast,\n\nPrest by a thousand foes to yield,\n\nTortured and wounded without rest,\n\nYou cried: \"Be merciful, O Life—\n\nThe strongest spirit soon must break\n\nBefore this all-unequal strife,\n\nThis endless fight for failure's sake!\"\n\nBut Fate, unheeding, lifted high\n\nHis sword, and thrust you through to die,\n\nAnd then there came one strong and great,\n\nWho towered high o'er Chance and Fate,\n\nWho bound your wound and eased your pain\n\nAnd bade you rise and fight again.\n\nAnd from some source you did not guess\n\nGushed a great tide of happiness—\n\nA courage mightier than the sun—\n\nYou rose and fought and, fighting, won!\n\nIt was your own Self saving you,\n\nYour Self no man has ever known,\n\nLooking on flesh and blood alone.\n\nThat Self that lives so close to God\n\nAs roots that feed upon the sod.\n\nThat one who stands behind the screen,\n\nLooks through the window of your eyes—\n\nA being out of Paradise.\n\nThe Self no human eye has seen,\n\nThe living one who never tires,\n\nFed by the deep eternal fires.\n\nYour flaming Self, with two-edged sword,\n\nMade in the likeness of the Lord,\n\nAngel and guardian at the gate,\n\nMaster of Death and King of Fate!\n\nAngela Morgan.\n\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\n\nJUST WHISTLE\n\nThere is a psychological benefit in the mere physical act of whistling. When the body makes music, the spirit falls into harmonies too and the discords that assail us cease to make themselves heard.\n\nWhen times are bad an' folks are sad\n\nAn' gloomy day by day,\n\nJest try your best at lookin' glad\n\nAn' whistle 'em away.\n\nDon't mind how troubles bristle,\n\nJest take a rose or thistle.\n\nHold your own\n\nAn' change your tone\n\nAn' whistle, whistle, whistle!\n\nA song is worth a world o' sighs.\n\nWhen red the lightnings play,\n\nLook for the rainbow in the skies\n\nAn' whistle 'em away.\n\nDon't mind how troubles bristle,\n\nThe rose comes with the thistle.\n\nHold your own\n\nAn' change your tone\n\nAn' whistle, whistle, whistle!\n\nEach day comes with a life that's new,\n\nA strange, continued story\n\nBut still beneath a bend o' blue\n\nThe world rolls on to glory.\n\nDon't mind how troubles bristle,\n\nJest take a rose or thistle.\n\nHold your own\n\nAn' change your tone\n\nAn' whistle, whistle, whistle!\n\nFrank L. Stanton.\n\n[Illustration: GRANTLAND RICE]\n\n\"MIGHT HAVE BEEN\"\n\n\"Yes, it's pretty hard,\" the optimistic old woman admitted. \"I have to get along with only two teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower—but thank God, they meet.\"\n\nHere's to \"The days that might have been\";\n\nHere's to \"The life I might have led\";\n\nThe fame I might have gathered in—\n\nThe glory ways I might have sped.\n\nGreat \"Might Have Been,\" I drink to you\n\nUpon a throne where thousands hail—\n\nAnd then—there looms another view—\n\nI also \"might have been\" in jail.\n\nO \"Land of Might Have Been,\" we turn\n\nWith aching hearts to where you wait;\n\nWhere crimson fires of glory burn,\n\nAnd laurel crowns the guarding gate;\n\nWe may not see across your fields\n\nThe sightless skulls that knew their woe—\n\nThe broken spears—the shattered shields—\n\nThat \"might have been\" as truly so.\n\n\"Of all sad words of tongue or pen\"—\n\nSo wails the poet in his pain—\n\nThe saddest are, \"It might have been,\"\n\nAnd world-wide runs the dull refrain.\n\nThe saddest?

Then come the years and the struggles, and we are buffeted and baffled, and our very ideal is eclipsed. But others have done better than we. Weary and harassed, they yet embody our visions. And we, if we are worth our salt, do not envy them when we see them. Nor should we grow dispirited. Rather should we rejoice in their triumph, rejoice that our dreams were not impossibilities, take courage to strive afresh for that which we know is best.\n\nI knew his face the moment that he passed\n\nTriumphant in the thoughtless, cruel throng,—\n\nTriumphant, though the quiet, tired eyes\n\nShowed that his soul had suffered overlong.\n\nAnd though across his brow faint lines of care\n\nWere etched, somewhat of Youth still lingered there.\n\nI gently touched his arm—he smiled at me—\n\nHe was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\n\nWhere I had failed, he'd won from life, Success;\n\nWhere I had stumbled, with sure feet he stood;\n\nAlike—yet unalike—we faced the world,\n\nAnd through the stress he found that life was good\n\nAnd I? The bitter wormwood in the glass,\n\nThe shadowed way along which failures pass!\n\nYet as I saw him thus, joy came to me—\n\nHe was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\n\nI knew him! And I knew he knew me for\n\nThe man HE might have been. Then did his soul\n\nThank silently the gods that gave him strength\n\nTo win, while I so sorely missed the goal?\n\nHe turned, and quickly in his own firm hand\n\nHe took my own—the gulf of Failure spanned, …\n\nAnd that was all—strong, self-reliant, free,\n\nHe was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\n\nWe did not speak. But in his sapient eyes\n\nI saw the spirit that had urged him on,\n\nThe courage that had held him through the fight\n\nHad once been mine, I thought, \"Can it be gone?\"\n\nHe felt that unasked question—felt it so\n\nHis pale lips formed the one-word answer, \"No!\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nToo late to win? No! Not too late for me—\n\nHe is the Man that Still I Mean to Be!\n\nEverard Jack Appleton.\n\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\n\nTHE JOY OF LIVING\n\nMen too often act as if life were nothing more than hardships to be endured and difficulties to be overcome. They look upon what is happy or inspiring with eyes that really fail to see. As Wordsworth says of Peter Bell,\n\n\"A primrose by the river's brim\n\nA yellow primrose was to him,\n\nAnd it was nothing more.\"\n\nBut to stop now and then and realize that the world is fresh and buoyant and happy, will do much to keep the spirit young. We should be glad that we are alive, should tell ourselves often in the words of Charles Lamb: \"I am in love with this green earth.\"\n\nThe south wind is driving\n\nHis splendid cloud-horses\n\nThrough vast fields of blue.\n\nThe bare woods are singing,\n\nThe brooks in their courses\n\nAre bubbling and springing\n\nAnd dancing and leaping,\n\nThe violets peeping.\n\nI'm glad to be living:\n\nAren't you?\n\nGamaliel Bradford.\n\nTHERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING TO DO\n\nAn old lady, famous for her ability to find in other people traits that she could commend, was challenged to say a good word for the devil. After a moment's hesitation she answered, \"You must at least give him credit for being industrious.\" Perhaps it is this superactivity of Satan that causes beings less wickedly inclined to have such scope for the exercise of their qualities. Certain it is that nobody need hang back from want of something to do, to promote, to assail, to protect, to endure, or to sympathize with.\n\nThere will always be something to do, my boy;\n\nThere will always be wrongs to right;\n\nThere will always be need for a manly breed\n\nAnd men unafraid to fight.\n\nThere will always be honor to guard, my boy;\n\nThere will always be hills to climb,\n\nAnd tasks to do, and battles new\n\nFrom now till the end of time.\n\nThere will always be dangers to face, my boy;\n\nThere will always be goals to take;\n\nMen shall be tried, when the roads divide,\n\nAnd proved by the choice they make.\n\nThere will always be burdens to bear, my boy;\n\nThere will always be need to pray;\n\nThere will always be tears through the future years,\n\nAs loved ones are borne away.\n\nThere will always be God to serve, my boy,\n\nAnd always the Flag above;\n\nThey shall call to you until life is through\n\nFor courage and strength and love.\n\nSo these are things that I dream, my boy,\n\nAnd have dreamed since your life began:\n\nThat whatever befalls, when the old world calls,\n\nIt shall find you a sturdy man.\n\nEdgar A. Guest.\n\nFrom \"The Path to Home.\"\n\nGOOD INTENTIONS\n\nThinking you would like a square meal will not in itself earn you one. Thinking you would like a strong body will not without effort on your part make you an athlete. Thinking you would like to be kind or successful will not bring you gentleness or achievement if you stop with mere thinking. The arrows of intention must have the bow of strong purpose to impel them.\n\nThe road to hell, they assure me,\n\nWith good intentions is paved;\n\nAnd I know my desires are noble,\n\nBut my deeds might brand me depraved.\n\nIt's the warped grain in our nature,\n\nAnd St. Paul has written it true:\n\n\"The good that I would I do not;\n\nBut the evil I would not I do.\"\n\nI've met few men who are monsters\n\nWhen I came to know them inside;\n\nYet their bearing and dealings external\n\nAre crusted with cruelty, pride,\n\nScorn, selfishness, envy, indifference,\n\nGreed—why the long list pursue?\n\nThe good that they would they do not;\n\nBut the evil they would not they do.\n\nIntentions may still leave us beast-like;\n\nWith unchangeable purpose we're men.\n\nWe must drive the nail home—and then clinch it\n\nOr storms shake it loose again.\n\nIn things of great import, in trifles,\n\nWe our recreant souls must subdue\n\nTill the evil we would not we do not\n\nAnd the good that we would we do.\n\nSt. Clair Adams.\n\nPHILOSOPHY FOR CROAKERS\n\nMany people seem to get pleasure in seeing all the bad there is, and in making everything about them gloomy. They are like the old woman who on being asked how her health was, replied: \"Thank the Lord, I'm poorly.\"\n\nSome folks git a heap o' pleasure\n\nOut o' lookin' glum;\n\nHoard their cares like it was treasure—\n\nFear they won't have some.\n\nWear black border on their spirit;\n\nHang their hopes with crape;\n\nFuture's gloomy and they fear it,\n\nSure there's no escape.\n\nNow there ain't no use of whining\n\nWeightin' joy with lead;\n\nThere is silver in the linin'\n\nSomewhere on ahead.\n\nCan't enjoy the sun to-day—\n\nIt may rain to-morrow;\n\nWhen a pain won't come their way,\n\nFuture pains they borrow.\n\nIf there's good news to be heard,\n\nEars are stuffed with cotton;\n\nEvils dire are oft inferred;\n\nGood is all forgotten.\n\nWhen upon a peel I stand,\n\nSlippin' like a goner,\n\nLuck, I trust, will shake my hand\n\nJust around the corner.\n\nKeep a scarecrow in the yard,\n\nFierce old bulldog near 'em;\n\nChase off joy that's tryin' hard\n\nTo come in an' cheer 'em.\n\nWear their blinders big and strong,\n\nDodge each happy sight;\n\nLike to keep their faces long;\n\nThink the day is night.\n\nNow I've had my share of trouble;\n\nBack been bent with ill;\n\nBig load makes the joy seem double\n\nWhen I mount the hill.\n\nGot the toothache in their soul;\n\nCorns upon their feelin's;\n\nGet their share but want the whole,\n\nSay it's crooked dealings.\n\nNatures steeped in indigo;\n\nGot their joy-wires crossed;\n\nSwear it's only weeds that grow;\n\nFlowers always lost.\n\nNow it's best to sing a song\n\n'Stead o' sit and mourn;\n\nRose you'll find grows right along\n\nBigger than the thorn.\n\nBeat the frogs the way they croak;\n\nSee with goggles blue—\n\nUniverse is cracked or broke,\n\n'Bout to split in two.\n\nThink the world is full of sin,\n\nSoon go up the spout;\n\nBadness always movin' in,\n\nGoodness movin' out.\n\nBut I've found folks good and kind,\n\n'Cause I thought they would be;\n\nMost men try, at least I find,\n\nTo be what they should be.\n\nJoseph Morris.\n\nTHE FIGHTING FAILURE\n\n\"I'm not a rabid, preachy, pollyanna optimist. Neither am I a gloomy grouch. I believe in a loving Divine Providence Who expects you to play the Game to the limit, Who wants you to hold tight to His hand, and Who compensates you for the material losses by giving you the ability to retain your sense of values, and keep your spiritual sand out of the bearings of your physical machine, if you'll trust and—'Keep Sweet, Keep Cheerful, or else—Keep Still'\"—Everard Jack Appleton.\n\nHe has come the way of the fighting men, and fought by the rules of the\n\nGame,\n\nAnd out of Life he has gathered—What? A living,—and little fame,\n\nEver and ever the Goal looms near,—seeming each time worth while;\n\nBut ever it proves a mirage fair—ever the grim gods smile.\n\nAnd so, with lips hard set and white, he buries the hope that is gone,—\n\nHis fight is lost—and he knows it is lost—and yet he is fighting on.\n\nOut of the smoke of the battle-line watching men win their way,\n\nAnd, cheering with those who cheer success, he enters again the fray,\n\nLicking the blood and the dust from his lips, wiping the sweat from his\n\neyes,\n\nHe does the work he is set to do—and \"therein honor lies.\"\n\nBrave they were, these men he cheered,—theirs is the winners' thrill;\n\nHis fight is lost—and he knows it is lost—and yet he is fighting still.\n\nAnd those who won have rest and peace; and those who died have more;\n\nBut, weary and spent, he can not stop seeking the ultimate score;\n\nCourage was theirs for a little time,—but what of the man who sees\n\nThat he must lose, yet will not beg mercy upon his knees?\n\nSide by side with grim Defeat, he struggles at dusk or dawn,—\n\nHis fight is lost—and he knows it is lost—and yet he is fighting on.\n\nPraise for the warriors who succeed, and tears for the vanquished dead;\n\nThe world will hold them close to her heart, wreathing each honored head,\n\nBut there in the ranks, soul-sick, time-tried, he battles against the odds,\n\nSans hope, but true to his colors torn, the plaything of the gods!\n\nUncover when he goes by, at last! Held to his task by will\n\nThe fight is lost—and he knows it is lost—and yet he is fighting still!\n\nEverard Jack Appleton.\n\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\n\nDUTY\n\nIn a single sentence Emerson crystallizes the faith that nothing is impossible to those whose guide is duty. His words, though spoken primarily of youth, apply to the whole of human life.\n\nSo nigh is grandeur to our dust,\n\nSo near is God to man,\n\nWhen duty whispers low, Thou must,\n\nThe youth replies, I can.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson.\n\nTHE CALL OF THE UNBEATEN\n\nP.T. Barnum had shrewdness, inventiveness, hair-trigger readiness in acting or deciding, an eye for hidden possibilities, an instinct for determining beforehand what would prove popular. All these qualities helped him in his original and extraordinary career. But the quality he valued most highly was the one he called \"stick-to-it-iveness.\" This completed the others. Without it the great showman could not have succeeded at all. Nor did he think that any man who lacks it will make much headway in life.\n\nWe know how rough the road will be,\n\nHow heavy here the load will be,\n\nWe know about the barricades that wait along the track;\n\nBut we have set our soul ahead\n\nUpon a certain goal ahead\n\nAnd nothing left from hell to sky shall ever turn us back.\n\nWe know how brief all fame must be,\n\nWe know how crude the game must be,\n\nWe know how soon the cheering turns to jeering down the block;\n\nBut there's a deeper feeling here\n\nThat Fate can't scatter reeling here,\n\nIn knowing we have battled with the final ounce in stock.\n\nWe sing of no wild glory now,\n\nEmblazoning some story now\n\nOf mighty charges down the field beyond some guarded pit;\n\nBut humbler tasks befalling us,\n\nSet duties that are calling us,\n\nWhere nothing left from hell to sky shall ever make us quit.\n\nGrantland Rice.\n\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\n\nPOLONIUS'S ADVICE TO LAERTES\n\nA father's advice to his son how to conduct himself in the world: Don't tell all you think, or put into action thoughts out of harmony or proportion with the occasion. Be friendly, but not common; don't dull your palm by effusively shaking hands with every chance newcomer. Avoid quarrels if you can, but if they are forced on you, give a good account of yourself. Hear every man's censure (opinion), but express your own ideas to few. Dress well, but not ostentatiously. Neither borrow nor lend. And guarantee yourself against being false to others by setting up the high moral principle of being true to yourself.\n\nGive thy thoughts no tongue,\n\nNor any unproportion'd thought his act.\n\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;\n\nThe friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\n\nGrapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\n\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\n\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\n\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\n\nBear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\n\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice;\n\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\n\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\n\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\n\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNeither a borrower, nor a lender be;\n\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\n\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\n\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\n\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\n\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare.\n\nHOW DO YOU TACKLE YOUR WORK?\n\nIt would be foolish to begin digging a tunnel through a mountain with a mere pick and spade. We must assemble for the task great mechanical contrivances. And so with our energies of will; a slight tool means a slight achievement; a huge, aggressive engine, driving on at full blast, means corresponding bigness of results.\n\nHow do you tackle your work each day?\n\nAre you scared of the job you find?\n\nDo you grapple the task that comes your way\n\nWith a confident, easy mind?\n\nDo you stand right up to the work ahead\n\nOr fearfully pause to view it?\n\nDo you start to toil with a sense of dread\n\nOr feel that you're going to do it?\n\nYou can do as much as you think you can,\n\nBut you'll never accomplish more;\n\nIf you're afraid of yourself, young man,\n\nThere's little for you in store.\n\nFor failure comes from the inside first,\n\nIt's there if we only knew it,\n\nAnd you can win, though you face the worst,\n\nIf you feel that you're going to do it.\n\nSuccess! It's found in the soul of you,\n\nAnd not in the realm of luck!\n\nThe world will furnish the work to do,\n\nBut you must provide the pluck.\n\nYou can do whatever you think you can,\n\nIt's all in the way you view it.\n\nIt's all in the start you make, young man:\n\nYou must feel that you're going to do it.\n\nHow do you tackle your work each day?\n\nWith confidence clear, or dread?\n\nWhat to yourself do you stop and say\n\nWhen a new task lies ahead?\n\nWhat is the thought that is in your mind?\n\nIs fear ever running through it?\n\nIf so, just tackle the next you find\n\nBy thinking you're going to do it.\n\nEdgar A. Guest.\n\nFrom \"A Heap o' Livin'.\"\n\nMAN OR MANIKIN\n\nThe world does not always distinguish between appearance and true merit. Pretence often gets the plaudits, but desert is above them—it has rewards of its own.\n\nNo matter whence you came, from a palace or a ditch,\n\nYou're a man, man, man, if you square yourself to life;\n\nAnd no matter what they say, hermit-poor or Midas-rich,\n\nYou are nothing but a husk if you sidestep strife.\n\nFor it's do, do, do, with a purpose all your own,\n\nThat makes a man a man, whether born a serf or king;\n\nAnd it's loaf, loaf, loaf, lolling on a bench or throne\n\nThat makes a being thewed to act a limp and useless thing!\n\nNo matter what you do, miracles or fruitless deeds,\n\nYou're a man, man, man, if you do them with a will;\n\nAnd no matter how you loaf, cursing wealth or mumbling creeds,\n\nYou are nothing but a noise, and its weight is nil.\n\nFor it's be, be, be, champion of your heart and soul,\n\nThat makes a man a man, whether reared in silk or rags;\n\nAnd it's talk, talk, talk, from a tattered shirt or stole,\n\nThat makes the image of a god a manikin that brags.\n\nRichard Butler Glaenzer.\n\nFrom \"Munsey's Magazine.\"\n\nHAVING DONE AND DOING\n\n(ADAPTED FROM \"TROILUS AND CRESSIDA\")\n\nA member of Parliament, having succeeded notably in his maiden effort at speech-making, remained silent through the rest of his career lest he should not duplicate his triumph. This course was stupid; in time the address which had brought him fame became a theme for disparagement and mockery. A man cannot rest upon his laurels, else he will soon lack the laurels to rest on. If he has true ability, he must from time to time show it, instead of asking us to recall what he did in the past. There is a natural instinct which makes the whole world kin. It is distrust of a mere reputation. It is a hankering to be shown. Unless the evidence to set us right is forthcoming, we will praise dust which is gilded over rather than gold which is dusty from disuse.\n\nTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\n\nWherein he puts alms for oblivion,\n\nA great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\n\nThose scraps are good deeds past; which are devoured\n\nAs fast as they are made, forgot as soon\n\nAs done: perseverance, dear my lord,\n\nKeeps honor bright: to have done, is to hang\n\nQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\n\nIn monumental mockery. Take the instant way;\n\nFor honor travels in a strait so narrow\n\nWhere one but goes abreast: keep, then, the path;\n\nFor emulation hath a thousand sons\n\nThat one by one pursue: if you give way,\n\nOr hedge aside from the direct forthright,\n\nLike to an entered tide they all rush by\n\nAnd leave you hindmost;\n\nOr, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank,\n\nLie there for pavement to the abject rear,\n\nO'errun and trampled on: then what they do in present,\n\nThough less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;\n\nFor time is like a fashionable host,\n\nThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,\n\nAnd with his arms outstretched, as he would fly,\n\nGrasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,\n\nAnd farewell goes out sighing. O! let not virtue seek\n\nRemuneration for the thing it was; for beauty, wit,\n\nHigh birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,\n\nLove, friendship, charity, are subjects all\n\nTo envious and calumniating time.\n\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\n\nThat all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\n\nThough they are made and moulded of things past,\n\nAnd give to dust that is a little gilt\n\nMore laud than gilt o'er-dusted.\n\nThe present eye praises the present object,\n\nSince things in motion sooner catch the eye\n\nThan what not stirs.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare.\n\nFAITH\n\nFaith is not a passive thing—mere believing or waiting. It is an active thing—a positive striving and achievement, even if conditions be untoward.\n\nFaith is not merely praying\n\nUpon your knees at night;\n\nFaith is not merely straying\n\nThrough darkness to the light.\n\nFaith is not merely waiting\n\nFor glory that may be,\n\nFaith is not merely hating\n\nThe sinful ecstasy.\n\nFaith is the brave endeavor\n\nThe splendid enterprise,\n\nThe strength to serve, whatever\n\nConditions may arise.\n\nS.E. Kiser.\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nWhat is opportunity? To the brilliant mind of Senator Ingalls it is a stupendous piece of luck. It comes once and once only to every human being, wise or foolish, good or wicked. If it be not perceived on the instant, it passes by forever. No longing for it, no effort, can bring it back. Notice that this view is fatalistic; it makes opportunity an external thing—one that enriches men or leaves their lives empty without much regard to what they deserve.\n\nMaster of human destinies am I!\n\nFame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait.\n\nCities and fields I walk; I penetrate\n\nDeserts and seas remote, and passing by\n\nHovel and mart and palace—soon or late\n\nI knock, unbidden, once at every gate!\n\nIf sleeping, wake—if feasting, rise before\n\nI turn away. It is the hour of fate,\n\nAnd they who follow me reach every state\n\nMortals desire, and conquer every foe\n\nSave death; but those who doubt or hesitate,\n\nCondemned to failure, penury, and woe,\n\nSeek me in vain and uselessly implore.\n\nI answer not, and I return no more!\n\nJohn James Ingalls.\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\n\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\n\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\n\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\n\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;\n\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\n\nOr lose our ventures.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare.\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nTo the thought of the preceding poem we have here a direct answer. No matter how a man may have failed in the past, the door of opportunity is always open to him. He should not give way to useless regrets; he should know that the future is within his control, that it will be what he chooses to make it.\n\nThey do me wrong who say I come no more\n\nWhen once I knock and fail to find you in;\n\nFor every day I stand outside your door,\n\nAnd bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.\n\nWail not for precious chances passed away,\n\nWeep not for golden ages on the wane!\n\nEach night I burn the records of the day,—\n\nAt sunrise every soul is born again!\n\nLaugh like a boy at splendors that have sped,\n\nTo vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb;\n\nMy judgments seal the dead past with its dead,\n\nBut never bind a moment yet to come.\n\nThough deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;\n\nI lend my arm to all who say \"I can!\"\n\nNo shame-faced outcast ever sank so deep,\n\nBut yet might rise and be again a man!\n\nDost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?\n\nDost reel from righteous Retribution's blow?\n\nThen turn from blotted archives of the past,\n\nAnd find the future's pages white as snow.\n\nArt thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell;\n\nArt thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven;\n\nEach morning gives thee wings to flee from hell,\n\nEach night a star to guide thy feet to heaven.\n\nWalter Malone.\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nIn this poem yet another view of opportunity is presented. The recreant or the dreamer complains that he has no real chance. He would succeed, he says, if he had but the implements of success—money, influence, social prestige, and the like. But success lies far less in implements than in the use we make of them. What one man throws away as useless, another man seizes as the best means of victory at hand. For every one of us the materials for achievement are sufficient. The spirit that prompts us is what ultimately counts.\n\nThis I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:—\n\nThere spread a cloud of dust along a plain;\n\nAnd underneath the cloud, or in it, raged\n\nA furious battle, and men yelled, and swords\n\nShocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner\n\nWavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.\n\nA craven hung along the battle's edge,\n\nAnd thought, \"Had I a sword of keener steel—\n\nThat blue blade that the king's son bears,—but this\n\nBlunt thing—!\" he snapt and flung it from his hand,\n\nAnd lowering crept away and left the field.\n\nThen came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,\n\nAnd weaponless, and saw the broken sword,\n\nHilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,\n\nAnd ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout\n\nLifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,\n\nAnd saved a great cause that heroic day.\n\nEdward Rowland Sill.\n\nFrom \"Poems.\"\n\n[Illustration: JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY]\n\nMY PHILOSOPHY\n\nThough dogs persist in barking at the moon, the moon's business is not to answer the dogs or to waste strength placating them, but simply to shine. The man who strives or succeeds is sure to be criticized. Is he therefore to abstain from all effort? We are responsible for our own lives and cannot regulate them according to other people's ideas. \"Whoso would be a man,\" says Emerson, \"must be a nonconformist.\"\n\nI allus argy that a man\n\nWho does about the best he can\n\nIs plenty good enugh to suit\n\nThis lower mundane institute—\n\nNo matter ef his daily walk\n\nIs subject fer his neghbor's talk,\n\nAnd critic-minds of ev'ry whim\n\nJest all git up and go fer him!\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt's natchurl enugh, I guess,\n\nWhen some gits more and some gits less,\n\nFer them-uns on the slimmest side\n\nTo claim it ain't a fare divide;\n\nAnd I've knowed some to lay and wait,\n\nAnd git up soon, and set up late,\n\nTo ketch some feller they could hate\n\nFor goin' at a faster gait.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMy doctern is to lay aside\n\nContensions, and be satisfied:\n\nJest do your best, and praise er blame\n\nThat follers that, counts jest the same.\n\nI've allus noticed grate success\n\nIs mixed with troubles, more er less,\n\nAnd it's the man who does the best\n\nThat gits more kicks than all the rest.\n\nJames Whitcomb Riley.\n\nFrom the Biographical Edition\n\nOf the Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley.\n\nULYSSES\n\nThis volume consists chiefly of contemporary or very recent verse. But it could not serve its full purpose without the presence, here and there, of older poems—of \"classics.\" These express a truth, a mood, or a spirit that is universal, and they express it in words of noble dignity and beauty. They are not always easy to understand; they are crops we must patiently cultivate, not crops that volunteer. But they wear well; they grow upon us; we come back to them again and again, and still they are fresh, living, significant—not empty, meaningless, and weather-worn, like a last year's crow's nest.\n\nSuch a poem is Ulysses. It is shot through and through with the spirit of strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor—a spirit manifest in a hero who has every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long years of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward voyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and shown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude native kingdom. He is reunited with his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus. He is rich and famous. Yet he is unsatisfied. The task and routine of governing a slow, materially minded people, though suited to his son's temperament, are unsuited to his. He wants to wear out rather than to rust out. He wants to discover what the world still holds. He wants to drink life to the lees. The morning has passed, the long day has waned, twilight and the darkness are at hand. But scant as are the years left to him, he will use them in a last, incomparable quest. He rallies his old comrades—tried men who always\n\n\"With a frolic welcome took\n\nThe thunder and the sunshine\"—\n\nand asks them to brave with him once more the hazards and the hardships of the life of vast; unsubdued enterprise.\n\nIt little profits that an idle king,\n\nBy this still hearth, among these barren crags,\n\nMatch'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole\n\nUnequal laws unto a savage race,\n\nThat hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.\n\nI cannot rest from travel; I will drink\n\nLife to the lees. All times I have enjoy'd\n\nGreatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those\n\nThat loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\n\nThro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\n\nVext the dim sea. I am become a name;\n\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart\n\nMuch have I seen and known,—cities of men\n\nAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,\n\nMyself not least, but honor'd of them all,—\n\nAnd drunk delight of battle with my peers,\n\nFar on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\n\nI am a part of all that I have met;\n\nYet all experience is an arch wherethro'\n\nGleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\n\nFor ever and for ever when I move.\n\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\n\nTo rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!\n\nAs tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life\n\nWere all too little, and of one to me\n\nLittle remains; but every hour is saved\n\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\n\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\n\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\n\nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire\n\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\n\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\n\nThis is my son, mine own Telemachus,\n\nTo whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,—\n\nWell-beloved of me, discerning to fulfil\n\nThis labor, by slow prudence to make mild\n\nA rugged people, and thro' soft degrees\n\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\n\nMost blameless is he, centred in the sphere\n\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\n\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\n\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\n\nWhen I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\n\nThere lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\n\nThere gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\n\nSouls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,—\n\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\n\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\n\nFree hearts, free foreheads,—you and I are old;\n\nOld age hath yet his honor and his toil.\n\nDeath closes all; but something ere the end,\n\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\n\nNot unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\n\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\n\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\n\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends.\n\n'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\n\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\n\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\n\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\n\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\n\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\n\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\n\nTho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'\n\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\n\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,—\n\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\n\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\n\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\nAlfred Tennyson.\n\nPREPAREDNESS\n\nFor all your days prepare,\n\nAnd meet them ever alike:\n\nWhen you are the anvil, bear—\n\nWhen you are the hammer, strike.\n\nEdwin Markham.\n\nFrom \"The Gates of Paradise, and Other Poems.\"\n\nTHE WISDOM OF FOLLY\n\n\"Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,\n\nAnd merrily hent the stile-a:\n\nA merry heart goes all the day,\n\nYour sad tires in a mile-a.\"\n\nShakespeare's lilting stanza conveys a great truth—the power of cheerfulness to give impetus and endurance. The a at the end of lines is merely an addition in singing; the word hent means take.\n\nThe cynics say that every rose\n\nIs guarded by a thorn which grows\n\nTo spoil our posies;\n\nBut I no pleasure therefore lack;\n\nI keep my hands behind my back\n\nWhen smelling roses.\n\nThough outwardly a gloomy shroud\n\nThe inner half of every cloud\n\nIs bright and shining:\n\nI therefore turn my clouds about,\n\nAnd always wear them inside out\n\nTo show the lining.\n\nMy modus operandi this—\n\nTo take no heed of what's amiss;\n\nAnd not a bad one;\n\nBecause, as Shakespeare used to say,\n\nA merry heart goes twice the way\n\nThat tires a sad one.\n\nEllen Thorneycroft Fowler. (The Honorable Mrs. Alfred Felkin.)\n\nFrom \"Verses Wise and Otherwise.\"\n\nSEE IT THROUGH\n\nAn American traveler in Italy stood watching a lumberman who, as the logs floated down a swift mountain stream, jabbed his hook in an occasional one and drew it carefully aside. \"Why do you pick out those few?\" the traveler asked. \"They all look alike.\" \"But they are not alike, seignior. The logs I let pass have grown on the side of a mountain, where they have been protected all their lives. Their grain is coarse; they are good only for lumber. But these logs, seignior, grew on the top of the mountain. From the time they were sprouts and saplings they were lashed and buffeted by the winds, and so they grew strong with fine grain. We save them for choice work; they are not 'lumber,' seignior.\"\n\nWhen you're up against a trouble,\n\nMeet it squarely, face to face;\n\nLift your chin and set your shoulders,\n\nPlant your feet and take a brace.\n\nWhen it's vain to try to dodge it,\n\nDo the best that you can do;\n\nYou may fail, but you may conquer,\n\nSee it through!\n\nBlack may be the clouds about you\n\nAnd your future may seem grim,\n\nBut don't let your nerve desert you;\n\nKeep yourself in fighting trim.\n\nIf the worse is bound to happen,\n\nSpite of all that you can do,\n\nRunning from it will not save you,\n\nSee it through!\n\nEven hope may seem but futile,\n\nWhen with troubles you're beset,\n\nBut remember you are facing\n\nJust what other men have met.\n\nYou may fail, but fall still fighting;\n\nDon't give up, whate'er you do;\n\nEyes front, head high to the finish.\n\nSee it through!\n\nEdgar A. Guest.\n\nFrom \"Just Folks.\"\n\nDECEMBER 31\n\nIf January 1 is an ideal time for renewed consecration, December 31 is an ideal time for thankful reminiscence. The year has not brought us everything we might have hoped, but neither has it involved us in everything we might have feared. Many are the perils, the failures, the miseries we have escaped, and life to us is still gracious and wholesome and filled to the brim with satisfaction.\n\nBest day of all the year, since I\n\nMay see thee pass and know\n\nThat if thou dost not leave me high\n\nThou hast not found me low,\n\nAnd since, as I behold thee die,\n\nThou leavest me the right to say\n\nThat I to-morrow still may vie\n\nWith them that keep the upward way.\n\nBest day of all the year to me,\n\nSince I may stand and gaze\n\nAcross the grayish past and see\n\nSo many crooked ways\n\nThat might have led to misery,\n\nOr might have ended at Disgrace—\n\nBest day since thou dost leave me free\n\nTo look the future in the face.\n\nBest day of all days of the year,\n\nThat was so kind, so good,\n\nSince thou dost leave me still the dear\n\nOld faith in brotherhood—\n\nBest day since I, still striving here,\n\nMay view the past with small regret,\n\nAnd, undisturbed by doubts or fear,\n\nSeeks paths that are untrod as yet.\n\nS.E.
