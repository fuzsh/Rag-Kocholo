Anna had her mothers’ complexion, pale gold hair and twinkling blue eyes, depicting her German ancestry. There was nothing small and dainty about Anna. She had a sturdiness and cleanness of line to body and face, brought about no doubt by the walks she took on lovely days and the bicycling through Tenth Street Park. Her hair was always swept up in soft curves in the fashion of the day that Mr. Gibson had made so popular. This morning, there was a garland of fresh flowers pinned to the back, for today was her wedding day.\n\nAnna’s sister Caroline had just finished buttoning her white brocade wedding gown with the high frilled collar, and went downstairs to get the corsage of flowers Anna would wear pinned to the bodice of the gown. Anna walked across the room to raise the fringed shade and let the beautiful warm spring air of April seep into the room. It was still quiet in the street below. There had been noise and confusion inside, with the final preparations for the wedding.\n\nAnna was thankful for these moments to be alone, her last time in her own lovely room in the big, warm, cheerful house on Tenth-Street. Memories flooded back, she had been born in this house in 1877. Her mother and father, Hannah and Fred Waking had made the voyage from Germany to join relatives and friends in this lovely and picturesque, up and coming, town of Richmond, Indiana. Her father had been a sailor, but gave up the sea for good and set up shop for plumbing, well drilling and later incorporated a line of sporting goods into his business on Main-Street. This enabled Anna to be the first girl in Richmond to have a bicycle.\n\nShe pulled back the lace curtains and drew a deep breath. How could she go through with this marriage? To put her life and future into the hands of another, even though she loved that person very much, it was giving her what everyone called the jitters. How much did she really know about Lorenzo Dow Boswell anyway? Her thoughts carried her back to the night she first met him at the skating rink.\n\nShe had skated and enjoyed her circle of friends and had caught the eyes of a stranger looking at her. He seemed much older than the group she was with that day. When an intermission came, the girls huddled in a corner to talk and gossip about the newcomer. Andrea provided them with the information she had acquired about the tall, dark, stranger. He’s not from around here, his family farms up around Whitewater. Isn’t he handsome though? She gave him a glance over her shoulder and continued, I met his sister Floretta, and she doesn’t dress like she came off a farm, her clothes look like they came from Paris designers to me. She is the most stylish girl I have ever seen here and the most stuck-up too, I might add. The girls happened to see the fellow approach at that moment, next to an auburn haired beauty dressed in black, which made her figure appear very slim and petite. They talked briefly, and she left as unobtrusively as she had appeared. \"Was that his sister? asked Anna. NO, replied Andrea, I’ve never seen that girl before, I wonder who she is, that’s mysterious.\"\n\nThe music started to play again, so the girls went for a new round of skating, when Anna noticed that her skate was loose. Anna had just sat down on a bench to adjust her skate, and then suddenly, the tal1, dark and handsome stranger was down on one knee at her feet to assist her. When he asked if he could be of help, Anna looked down at the upturned face and was captivated by the darkest eyes, with such a sparkle, she had ever seen. Everyone in her family and her friends were all blond with blue eyes. Anna was not shy, and the rest of the evening was spent in conversation with Lorenzo Dow Boswell. The name sounded so foreign to her and he had explained that he was named after a stump preacher that roamed the west, by the name of Lorenzo Dow. He was born on the prairie, in the west, around Des Moines, Iowa. The Boswells were Scotch-Irish descent and his father had been an army captain. Anna had in turn rattled off all her names, including her confirmation, I’m Anna Amelia Margaret Waking. I was born right here in Richmond on Tenth-Street, and I’ve never been farther from home than Cincinnati, Ohio. I went to school there with my friends for a brief time, but I don’t like being away from home for long.\n\nNo, she hadn’t liked being away from home for long, and now she would be leaving for good. Oh, there would be visits, but it would not be the same. The mornings she spent waking up in her front bedroom, with the massive walnut bed and carved furniture, the soft light coming in from the tall lace curtained window, the sounds of the birds in the maple trees, and a horse clopping by on Tenth Street. The thoughts of her mother in the kitchen, the smell of fresh baked bread, and her father reading aloud from the big German bible every morning at breakfast.\n\nAt Christmas, her sisters Mary and Caroline, and her older brothers, Fred and William, although everyone called him Billy, would gather around the massive grand piano in the parlor and sing her favorite song, 0h Tannenbaum. The Christmas tree of which they sang, stood in the front parlor window, fragrant with the very smell of Christmas, adorned with all the ornaments from Christmas past. In this parlor window, she had pressed her face against the frosted pane and had watched the snow fall silently.\n\nTimes were always changing; she was the youngest since her little brother Walter had died of lung fever when he was only three years old. That was the only sad memory of her youth. She had missed her sisters and brothers as they had married and left home, but they had not gone far and she saw them almost everyday.\n\nMary had married first and lived close by on South E. Street. Anna had gone to stay with Mary to help her when she had her first child. Anna was only thirteen at the time, but Mary said she had been a big help to her and wanted to give her something special. She chose a gold ring and had it engraved with an inscription on the inside of the band. Anna was so proud of it; she never took the ring from her finger. Bill had married and went into the business with her father. Fred married his long time sweetheart, Edith, and took a job with the railroad. Caroline was the closest to Anna, and had not been married long herself. She lived close to home on Eleventh-Street. She was there early this beautiful morning to help Anna on her special day.\n\nIt had taken a long time to fasten the long row of small covered buttons that ran down the back of Anna’s wedding gown. Caroline coming in the door, with the corsage of flowers pulled Anna back from her reminiscence of by-gone years to the present moment. She turned from the window and stepped to the marble topped dresser to pick up a pair of dainty gold and pearl earrings and placed them in her pierced ears. It’s going to be a perfect day, and as warm as June. Wait till you see how lovely the house looks all decorated for your reception. Mary is outside decorating the grape arbor, by the back door, because guests are going to overflow the house. Mama says it is almost time to leave for the church. Do you have your white gloves? Anna reached for the gloves, taking them from the tissue lined, flat, narrow box from Knollenberg’s Department Store. Caroline was chattering away in her excitement of the day, That’s your something new, and Mama gave you her lace fan for something old. You borrowed my lace handkerchief, but what do you have for something blue? Anna responded with a little laugh and a somewhat whispered confidence, My something blue is a ribbon that runs through the eyelet lace in my drawers!\n\nSomeone was calling up the stairs that the horse and buggy had been brought around from the livery stable, so with one last look in the mirror that reflected back a lovely bride, and a last look at the room, she closed the door and followed Caroline down the stairs to the waiting family full of hugs, kisses, and wishes for her happiness. Anna slipped out the back door and made her way to the garden, her favorite place. She selected an early bloom of her own to add to her bouquet. She had planted and tended the flower garden, for her it was a touch of heaven on earth. Her favorite hymn was In a Garden, and she often sang as she worked, I come to the garden alone, while the dew is still on the roses……. She had a strong faith in God, and she attended church at St. Paul’s Lutheran every Sunday, but she felt closer to God here in her garden.\n\nCaroline was calling her anxiously, Anna, we must be going now. I’m coming, and clutching her spring bloom carefully, Anna walked back to the house. Hannah took her bloom and added it to her bridal bouquet while Anna slipped on her elbow length white gloves.\n\nBefore the buggy bore the wedding party down the street the few blocks, to the church, Anna took a long last look at the large white two story house, with its side porch and dark green shuttered windows, especially to the window of her room. She would return to this house, but as a married woman, leaving her carefree days of her girl-hood behind. It was somewhat a mixture of leaving the past that made her feel sad, and yet starting a new path into the future with the happy feelings of anticipation and a curiosity as to what was around the next corner in her life. She loved Lorenzo and he had been her choice. Her mother and father had not been so pleased at first because he was twelve years older than she, but her happiness was all that mattered to them and they gave their blessing to the match.\n\nThe day passed so"
