It is the birthdaythe two hundredth birthday-of the state of Georgia and every man, woman, and child who says, \"I am a Georgian,\" is invited to the celebration.\n\nSince the school has become a nucleus of modern life, this Bicentennial Celebration is to have its beginnings in the schools of Georgia. An intensive and interesting study of the state-its beginnings, its growth, its strength and its weakness, its points of interest, its progress, and its need for further progress-is to be made in each classroom throughout the length and breadth of Georgia.\n\nThis is a handbook to be used by the teacher of elementary children in order that she may be better able to present the study of Georgia in an interesting, worthwhile fashion. It was prepared within a limited time, only four weeks having been allotted in which to gather and organize all information. Because of this limitation and because of the fact that each city and section of the state has its own particular interests and heroes, the handbook herein presented is by no means either exhaustive or complete. The teacher, in order to understand the spirit of the work, is expected to read the entire book first, and then to add that information which is of especial interest to her and to those whose interests she guides.\n\nMuch worthwhile knowledge can be had through experiences, either actual or vicarious. Therefore, it is hoped that the teacher in the elementary school will have her children participate in as many activities as possible. She will find that they \"learn to do by doing\" and that the knowledge and skills which come as the result of an activity are both lasting and real.\n\nTo the average child, wide experience is impossible, actuallY. He can, however, obtain it vicariously. For example, through the windows of literature and history, he can look upon the past, the present, and the probable future of our state. He can come in contact with great thinkers, with noble minds, and with high adventures. Then, the clear vision of the discerning few can become the clear vision of all.\n\nThis guide book is the result of the earnest, conscientious effort ot eighty-nine teachers, principals, supervisors and directors in the elementary schools of the city of Atlanta. It was written so that the many little children who have been invited to the two hundredth birthday party of their state can have a good time. If, at the mention of Georgia's name in the years to come, the eyes of Georgia's children grow a bit brighter, if hearts beat a bit faster, and if ambition soars a bit higher, this book will have accomplished its purpose.\n\nIII\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe committee desires to express its appreciation to those pUblishers,\n\n.=.C1..;\n\nand authors from whose publications excerpts have been used.

He urged them on. Behind them stillness returnej to the hills and valleys. Through the tall pines the wind blew silently. Unwritten remained a page in the record book of time. Two centuries passed. Another leader Clime to the land. James Edward Oglethorpe was his name. He saw that the soil was good and the rivers gentle. He knew that with them men would find a security more lasting than with gold. In the name of his king he called the land GEORGIA. Last of the English colonies, GEORGIA became a vast empire from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Today she is the largest state east of that river. Warmed by a friendly sun and gentle breezes, GEORGIA is a happy land. In her varied soil many seeds find nourishment. In her thriving cities thousands know the security that labor brings. From her coast towns ships sail forth to traverse the seven seas. Many are the steps leading upward from ignorance and pain that GEORGIA has erected. It was in GEORGIA that the young physician, Crawford Long, forever abated the agonies of surgery by successfullY administering the first anesthetic. In GEORGIA the first state university was founded. In GEORGIA the lamp of learning first was passed to the hands of women, for Wesleyan, founded in Macon in 1836, was the pioneer among chartered COlleges for girls. From Savannah sailed the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. In ColumbUS, a daughter of GEORGIA inaugurated the ceremony which gavetothe nation Memorial Day. And when, after the years of civil conflict, the cannons were stilled, the swords laid aside, and the painful work of reconstruction was begun, it was a son of GEORGIA,Henry Grady, whose silver tongue and noble spirit led in the task of reuniting the shattered Union. \"Wisdom, Justice, Moderation\" is GEORGIA'S motto. Well has she clung to these ideals. Visit this modern empire of the South. Like the soldiers of De Soto, yOU will find it the \"pleasant place.\" From GEORGIA'S smooth highways yOU will look out on fields of fragrant tobacco and fluffy cotton, vast orchards whose trees are laden with peaches, acres of tall green corn and yellow grain. You will breathe the air made pungent by forests of rigid pine. You will see great quar-\n\nries of ageless marble and granite. You will linger in modern cities.\n\nYou will see mountains and plains. You will find an eager people moving onward, their eyes alight with the vision of the New South. In awe ;VOU will stand before Stone Mountain, on whose face in heroic proportions there will be an everlasting tribute to the great Southern leaders of the Civil War. In old Savannah you will find memories of Colonial days. Here stands Christ Church, where John Wesley preached. Here in the glory of her youth, is Wormsloe, oldest plan-\n\nIX\n\n7 . C1.,;\n\ntation in the state. In Augusta you should see historic Green Street\n\nwithIlts stately and hospitable old mansions. In Atlanta is \"The\n\nSign of the Wren's Nest,\" where lived the beloved story-teller Joel\n\nOhandler Harris, creator of \"Uncle Remus.\" In Athens lives Moina\n\nMichael, originator of \"POppy Day,\" angel of mercy to millions of World\n\nWar veterans, honored with the Distinguished Service Medal of the\n\nAmerican Legion. In every crisis of the nation GEORGIA has pro-\n\nduced great soldiers, and to the arena of sports she has given Ty Oobb\n\nand Bobby Jones. Wise was Oglethorpe when he chose GEORGIA.\n\nWise were the early settlers who journeyed from the North to this rich\n\nland. General Motors salutes yOU, GEORGIA. Faithfully have YOU\n\nkept lighted the torch of the pioneer.-Bruce Barton.\n\nAs broadcast by General Motors\n\nto the Nation-December 14, 1931.\n\nx\n\nHEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN GEORGIA\n\n\"Health is. not everything. It is not to be considered in itself an exclusive end to living. It should not be the main goal of education. It is, however, an absolutely essential means to forms of human achievement of most worth. It is even more essential to the welfare of the future than of the present, if the race is to progress and not deteriorate. \"\n\n-Dr. Thomas Wood.\n\nI-Health as Affected by the Geography of Georgia:\n\nA. Climate. B. General Freedom from Natural Perils. C. Water Supplies. D. Healthful Food Products.\n\nU-Health as Related to the History of Georgia:\n\nA. Games and Dances as They Follow Georgia History. B. Action Stories Based on Georgia History. C. Great Georgians Who Have Contributed to the World's Health. D. Traits Developed Through Physical Education as Exemplified\n\nin the Lives of Great Georgians. E. Georgia Health Statistics.\n\nIU-Bibliography.\n\nI-Health as Affected by Geography of Georgia:\n\nA. Climate. 1. Make study of Georgia's many climatic belts with their great varieties of climates and the comparatively few extremes of temperature; develop the fact that this makes for health. 2. Study rainfall in Georgia and its distribution throughout the year. Why is abundant rainfall well-distributed throughout the year a factor for health? 3. StUdy briefly the various health resorts of Georgia. Notice variety of health resorts. (Mountain and seashore.) Note the many health-giving springs in Georgia. (The following places are suggested for study: Alto, Lithia Springs, Tybee, St. Simon's, Warm Springs, White Sulphur SpriIigs, Radium Springs, and Indian Springs.) Suggested Activities in Connection with Climate: a. Study maps, booklets, charts, etc., showing climatic belts, distribution of rainfall, location of resorts, etc. b. Make weather observations. c. Visit Weather Bureau. d. Write letters to Chambers of Commerce or to school children of resorts studied.\n\n1\n\nB. General Freedom from Natural Perils.\n\nNote: Georgia enjoys comparative freedom from tidal waves,\n\n7'::L\n\nearthquakes, storms, and complete freedom from volcanic\n\neruptions. (Here may be taught the general safety rules\n\nbased on the idea that, since Nature has done so much for\n\nthe safety of Georgians, surely every good Georgian should\n\ndo his part to prevent endangering of life and property\n\nthrough \"man-made\" dangers.)\n\nC. Water Supplies.\n\nNote to teachers: The following study of Atlanta's water sUpply is given as a type study for those places in Georgia which use surface water. 1. Brief history of development of Atlanta's water-works:\n\nArtesian well at \"Five Points\"-Ponce de Leon SpringsInstallation of 3,000,000 gallon Hyatt Filter Plant completed at old water-works at Lakewood in 1885--Construction of new water-works system built during years 1900 to 1904, and remodeled and enlarged in 1923-Plans now on foot for greatlY expanded system to supply all North Georgia. 2. Study of the Chattahoochee River (introduced bY Lanier's Song of Chattahoochee\"): Origin in cool, healthful springs of Blue Ridge-Its red color gained from red clays of GeorgiaIts use by Gainesville and Buford as an outlet for sewage, thereby necessitating careful chemical treatment. 3. Mechanical and chemical processes in purification: Alum for coagulation-Calcium-lime for further coagulationSedimentation-Filtration-Chlorination. (Note: A visit to the Hemphill Ave. Station will enable the pupils to see the above five steps in the purification process.) . Work of Health Department at State Capitol in the analysis of water: Search for germs of typhoid and dysenteryGreat decrease in cases of illness and death from these diseases because of this work. 5. Chemical treatment of sewage for protection of health. Suggested Activities in Connection with Water Supplies: a. Build miniature water-works system with filter. (See\n\none at Hemphill Station.) b. Build filter with sand, gravel, and rock layers, and force\n\nwater through to watch process of purification. c. Build modern farm home showing water pump which\n\nbrings filtered water from tap, and an outside toilet with correct sewage disposal. (See the one at State Capitol). d. Compare modern water and sewage systems with rural and small-town wells and pit-privies.\n\nD. Food Products of Georgia from Standpoint of Health.\n\n1. Mountain products.. 2. Plain products.\n\n2\n\n3. Lowland products. Suggested Activities in Connection with Food Products. a. Make menus of Georgia products for balanced meal. The following menus are inserted as an aid to teachers.\n\nBreakfast\n\nBaked apples, corn-meal mush with cream, bacon, eggomelet, butter, toast, milk.\n\nLunch\n\nBoiled ham, creamed corn, fruit salad, hot toast, butter\n\nmilk.\n\nDinner\n\nBeef roast, creamed Irish potatoes, plum jelly, snapbeans, cornsticks, butter, stuffed celery, peach icecream, cup cake. b. Count calories in Georgia foods on certain specified days. The following scale showing calories needed per day for different ages is given for the help of the teacher:\n\nAge\n\nBoys\n\nGirls\n\n5-6 6- 7 7- 8\n\n8-9 9-10 10-11 11-12 12-13 13-14\n\n1300-1600 1400-1700 1500-1800 1600-1900 1700-2000 1900-2200 2100-2400 2300-2700 2500-2900\n\n1220-1520 13OQ-1600 1380-1680 1460-1760 1550-1850 1650-1950 1750-2050 1850-2150 1950-2250\n\n(Scale given in Wellman's \"Food Planning and Preparation. \")\n\nThe following list is based on Wellman's' 'Food Planning and Preparation.\" Georgia foods suitable for hot and cold lunches are listed according to caloric content:-\n\nCold Lunches\n\nFood\n\nCalories\n\nOne large apple____ _______ _____ ___ ___ _______ 2!\n\nBread-Boston Brown-1 small slice\n\n10\n\nGraham-1 thick slice_ ____ _______ _______ 14\n\nWhite-2 medium slices_____________________ 15\n\nWhole Wheat-1 thick slice_ ____ _\n\n14\n\n1 scant tablespoon butter - - - -- - -- - - - - -- - - __ t\n\n1 serving chicken\n\n~__________________\n\n80\n\n2 graham crackers_ ________ _____________________ 9\n\n1 large bunch Conco~d grapes__________________ 5 1 small serving fresh ham_ ______________ _______ 61\n\n3\n\n1 small serving smoked ham____________________ 20\n\n1 tablespoon orange marmalade _____________\n\n1\n\n20peanuts\n\nc\n\n~___\n\n19\n\n1 slice apple pie________________________________ 3\n\n1 slice custard pie_ ____ ____ ________________ _____ 91\n\n1 tomato (medium)______________________________ 4\n\nHot Lunches 6 stalks asparagus__ ________ ___ _________________ 33 1 slice bacon_____ _________________ ___ ________ ___ 6\n\n! cup baked beans - - - - - _-- - - __ -- - - __ - -- -_ ___ 21l\n\n1 serving beef ribs__ ________ ______ __ ____ ______ __ 22\n\n2 hot biscuits__________________________________ 9\n\nBreads.

I wonder how many of you brushed your teeth. Raise your hands. (Children\n\nraise hands) That is fine! You certainly have improved. You know\n\nthis is the morning for our Georgia Health Program, and I shall now\n\nlet the group leaders take charge. (A boy places a chair for the teacher\n\nand she is seated.) Thank you. The First Group Leader: (Rising and coming to front) My group\n\nhas written a Georgia health play. It is called, \"The Happy Georgia\n\nFamily.\" We are ready to begin. The characters will please come for-\n\nward.\n\nCharacters in Play:\n\nKing Health-wearing crown.\n\nQueen Happiness-wearing crown. The Helpers:\n\n1.

Sleep\n\n-Child taking a few simple exercises. -Child looking sleepy.\n\n7. Toothbrush -Child holding a toothbrush.\n\nKing Health: I am King Health and this (turning to the Queen)\n\nis Queen Happiness. These (looking at helpers) are the helpers and each one is a great help. Our family is called the \"Happy Georgia Fam-\n\nily\" because we help to make many Georgia people happy. Each helper\n\nwill tell you something about his work.\n\nVegetables: I am fresh vegetables.\n\nSome children do not like me,\n\nBut why I do not know. For if they would only let me\n\nI'd make them grow and grow.\n\nKing Health: Tell us what healthful vegetables can be raised in\n\nGeorgia.\n\nVegetables: There are so many that I could never name them all;\n\nGeorgia's vegetables are the best that can be found.\n\n7\n\nFruit: Fresh Fruit is my name And I am glad to say Most children like me, And eat me every day. Of course, I'm better when I'm fresh, But listen now, please do, If yOU can't get me when I'm fresh, I'm canned or dried for you.\n\nKing Health: What Georgia fruits make people healthY? Fruit: Apples, peaches, melons, grapes, pears, plums; they all grow in\n\nGeorgia. Milk: Fruit and vegetables are good for you,\n\nAnd believe everything they Say. But if yOU want to grow big and strong, You must drink me every dayAt least a quart. Queen Happiness: Tell us about Georgia's milk. Milk: Georgia's milk is the best. Our cows feed on Georgia green corn and grass, velvet and soy beans, and cotton seed meal and hulls; therefore, their milk is pure and rich.

Water: No state has purer or better. Exercise: It takes exercise to make yOU grow,\n\nOutdoor exercise is best, But do not play too hard and long, Just stop awhile and rest. King Health: Can children play outdoors much in Georgia? Exercise: Of course theY can, Georgia's climate is never so very hot in summer, nor so very cold in winter; there are not many days when children of Georgia cannot get fresh air and exercise out-of-doors. Sleep: It is all right to eat and drink, And exercise dailY too, But if it were not for sleep, Just what would YOU do? It is then your bodies grow And rest for work or play. Sleep ten hours every night, And rest an hour each day. Be sure your windows are open. King Health: Yes, leave your windows open, children, and get plenty of Georgia's healthful air. Toothbrush: I am just a little toothbrush,\n\nBut if YOU will use me, I'll make your teeth clean and white, Just try me and see.\n\n8\n\nI\n\nI\n\nYou know some day you'll be oldNow listen to me awhile Take care of your health while yoU are young, And when yOU are old, you can smile. Queen Happiness: What Georgia foods are good for teeth? Toothbrush: Leafy vegetables, milk and fruits.\n\n(First group is seated.) Second Group Leader: My group has learned a toothbrush song. We will now sing it for you. The group will please come forward. Toothbrush Song: (Tune: Jingle Bells).\n\nWe brush our teeth, we brush our teeth We brush them every day.

Teacher: (Rising) Children, I have enjoyed your program very much. Let me remind yoU that every Gilorgian wants to have nice, white, clean teeth; so be sure to remember what the Toothbrush Song says. Now suppose we stand and sing our \"Good Health Song.\"\n\nGood Health Song (Tune \"Ramblin' Wreck\")\n\nWe're a Georgia team that would never dream Of breaking our good health rules. We try each day in every Way To prove just what they mean. We are such jolly good fellows and I'll tell yoU the reason whyThe food is great, raised in our state And we keep our good health rmes. Teacher: You have had such a good program that, if yoU like, we shall go out and play some games. Those who would like to go, please stand.\n\n(All the children stand.) Note: This program is original classroom work.\n\nII-Health as Related to the History of Georgia:\n\nA. Games and Dances as They Follow Georgia History. 1. Games of Gilorgia. a. Indian Games. \"Ball Play (In this game each player had a three or four foot stick with a round hoop on one end, large enough to catch a ball of about the size of a tennis ball. A network of roots or deerskin was formed across the hoop. The object was to throw or carry the ball across the opposing team's goal.\n\n9\n\nI I I I I I\n\nI I I I I I\n\nI I I I I I\n\nI I I I\n\nf\n\nC2,;\n\nb.

Georgia History in Pageant.\n\nThe following pageant is a dance drama which will give a resume of the developments in Georgia that have taken place in the past two hundred years in the field of physical education and recreation and at the same time serve as a means to maintain bodily growth and development and further social adjustment. This program, or dance drama, presupposes a contest, which, if carefully carried on, can serve as an aim or goal in stressing many points of physical perfection.\n\nTWO HUNDRED YEARS OF FUN\n\nPrologue: In the lovely month of June, Georgia holds high carnival in a woodland dell. Miss Cherokee Rose, the loveliest maiden of the realm, has been chosen to be judge of the type of recreation she thinks most fun. This is the day of the contest.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies presents to Miss Cherokee Rose one recreation after another that has taken place in their native state for the past two hundred years. Miss Cherokee Rose longs to join in them all, but when the strains of her own \"Cherokee Rose Waltz\" are heard she listens with JOY and the Master of Ceremonies asks for the dance. They give vent to their joy of the day bY dancing a frolic-some waltz to the strains of the \"Cherokee Rose of Georgia.\" The others like it so well they soon join in singing the chorus.\n\nCharacters in order of their appearanceAttendants followed by Miss Cherokee Rose.

Keep a box for suggestions. Have students find out for them-\n\nselves what good posture is, and what physical perfection should in-\n\nclude. From suggestions taken from this box decide what points are\n\nto be used in judging the contest for selecting Miss Cherokee Rose and\n\nMaster of Ceremonies.\n\n2. Use silhouette to show types of physical perfection. (Silhouettes\n\nmay be made by using an unbleached domestic curtain with strong light\n\n...\n\nbehind it and the figure standing in front of it.) 3. Study some pictures of the famous small bronzes, such as Harriet\n\nFrishmuth's Play Days, JOY of the Waters, The Vine, Glint of the Sea,\n\nDesha, The Discus Thrower, Wrestlers, DYing Adonis, Speed, and the\n\nSlavic Dancer.\n\nSome gifted children could plan a statue dance combining these\n\npositions in a pleasing way.\n\n4. Discuss good proportions and correct measurements for different\n\nages. Let children measure themselves and compare with the ideal.\n\n(Use height and weight charts.)\n\nThe girl and the boy selected as the most representative specimens of\n\nphysical perfection shall win the honor of being Miss Cherokee Rose,\n\nand the Master of Ceremonies in the dance drama.\n\nSuggestions for costumes:\n\nCostumes should be historicallY correct as the project lends itself\n\nso well to a historical stUdy of Georgia and the dances are so much more\n\nattractive in the costumes of their time.\n\n15\n\nI I I I I\n\nI I I I I\n\nI I I I I\n\nI I I I I\n\nI I I I I\n\nI I I\n\nMiss Oherokee Rose wears a full -white tarleton ballet skirt, ankle\n\nlength, with white sateen tight-fitting basque and white baimt shoes.\n\n.'~-\"3'.\n\nThe headdress is a saucy white Oherokee Rose with a yellow center\n\nmade of cardboard covered with crepe paper. A tarleton ribborlIuns\n\nthrough the cardboard and ties under the chin, holding the hat, in\n\nplace. In most cases this hat is more becoming tilted over one eye.\n\nThe Master of Oeremonies should wear a white waist and white trousers\n\nwith a yellow stripe down each leg and a white cape lined with yellow.\n\n-In POny Ballet, jockey costumes are-attractive, colorful, and easier\n\nto ge(than riding habits.\n\nB.. Action Stories (Story Plays) Based on Georgia History.\n\nNote: Story plays are primarily for first and second grades. They\n\ntake the place of formal commands and setting up exercises, giving the\n\nchildren the same value hygienically, but in a more interesting, more in-\n\nstructive, and more imaginative Way. The play may be correlated with\n\nother subjects or with any particular historical event. In this year of\n\nthe celebration of Georgia's two hundredth birthday many interesting\n\nstory plays may be worked out.\n\nThe following two stOry plays given in full as examples and other suggestions are listed:\n\n1. STORY PLAY BASED ON THE FOUNDING OF GEORGIA.\n\nStory\n\nGymnastic Activity\n\nOnce upon a time there were\n\nsome people living in England who\n\ncould not pay their debts, so they Walk to see King.\n\nwere put in jail. They did not like Bow to King (bending forward\n\nthis, so one day a man named from hips.)\n\nJames Edward Oglethorpe went to Stand at attention.\n\nthe king and asked him if he could Bow again.\n\nbring these people across the sea to WaU(home.\n\nthis country to live.\n\nThey wanted to grow silk worms\n\n..\n\nhere, so they could sell the silk and\n\nmake money. The King said,\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nStooping, raising arms, lifting;\n\nThey packed all their clothes and etc.\n\nbelongings; then one day they Pack clothes in bundles (bend-\n\nslung their bundles on their backs ing).\n\nand went to the ship.\n\nReach for high articles (stretch-\n\ning).\n\nSling bundles on back.\n\nWalk to ship.\n\nThe ship sailed away. Sometimes the salling was smooth. Sometimes the ship rocked in the Rock as ship in waves (bending waves. The people watched for sideways).\n\n16\n\nStory\n\nland. It seemed a long time before they saw any, and when they did they were happy. The anchor was let down and they got off the ship into rOw boats and rowed to land. Only Indians were living there. Later the white men named this place Savannah, Georgia.\n\nGymnastic Activity\n\nWatch for land, (head turning). .Jump up and down. Lift anchor. Let anchor down. Climb into row boats and row, (rowing movements).\n\nCut down trees (arm and trunk\n\nThe first thing the people had to movement).\n\ndo on landing was to build homes Saw trees into logs, (swaying\n\nin which to live. So they began to bodY back and forth).\n\ncut down trees and split them into Lift logs, reach up, and place\n\nlogs. They put mud in the cracks logs on top of each other, (stooping\n\nand corners of the log houses to and reaching.)\n\nkeep out the rain and cold.\n\nGet mUd. fill cracks (deep knee\n\nbending.)\n\nThey soon found out that mulberry trees would not grow in this new land. So they cleared the fields and the Indians showed .them how to plant corn and tobacco.\n\nClear land. (Use ax.) Plant tobacco plants. Dig holes for corn and plant it.\n\nThe white men and Indians were good friends and sometimes they would sit around in a circle and smoke a peace pipe, which meant they would not fight.\n\nSquat in a circle. Take deep puffs on peace pipe. (Deep breathing.)\n\nThis was two hundred years ago and we are all thankful for .James Edward Oglethorpe, who founded our wonderful state of Georgia.\n\n2. STORY PLAY BASED ON THE LEGEND OF THE CHEROKEE ROSE (Georgia Flower)\n\nSuggested Story\n\nTwo hundred years ago only Indians lived in Georgia. There was one tribe of them called the Cherokee tribe. Another tribe lived further South in a state now called Florida and were known as the Seminole tribe.

They were going to burn him alive but he got very sick, and they decided to wait until he got well before burning him. While he was ill a beautiful Indian maiden of the Oherokee tribe nursed him. They fell in love with each other, so they decided to get married and slip away some night to his home, the land of the Seminoles.\n\nNow, the Indian maiden knew that if she helped the prisoner to escape, and if she went with him to his people, she could never come back to her own people.\n\nThis made her very sad.

This does not mean that the death rate was the lowest ever recorded, but it is remarkable that in spite of the most severe economic depression of a generation, together with a drought which lasted throughout the typhoid fever peak months, and in face of an influenza epidemic during the first four months of the year, the death rate exceeded the minimum by only 1.1 per 1,000 population. However, if the present unfavorable economic conditions continue there will be an appreciable increase in the death rate. Of the thirteen causes of death included in the epidemic and parasitic class (typhoid fever to tuberculosis) over one-half show decreases in their death rates. Whooping-cough, malaria, dysentery, and measles show the greatest decreases in the number of deaths. Influenza shows an increase of 337 deaths with an increase in the death rate of 33.8 per cent. The death rate from pellagra increased from 14.9 in 1920 to 30.0 in 1929, but the rate for the last two years shows marked decreases over the peak rate, 30.0.\n\nOancer, diseases of the heart, and nephritis have shown steadilY increasing death rates since 1920. The death rate from cancer has increased from 38.8 in 1920 to 53.8 in 1931. An increase of 15.0 or 39 per cent. The death rate from diseases of the heart increased from 65.3 in 1920 to 134.4 in 1931, an increase of over 100 per cent; and the death rate from nephritis increased from 76.0 in 1920 to 109.8 in 1931, an increase of about 30 per cent. However, the death rates in 1931 for both nephritis and diseases of the heart are lower than the rates for 1930.\n\nIn 1920 the death rate from automobile accidents was 4.8 and in 1931 it was 20.8, an increase of 333 per cent. This steady increase, from year to year, has occurred in spite of the efforts of the National Safety Oouncil, newspapers, and other organizations to arouse a spirit of courtesy and caution in drivers of automobiles.\n\nThe greatest assets of this state are its strong, healthy people, and if the state fails to protect their health and life against preventable diseases it will lose more than a deflation in taxable values. Life, health, faith, and morale are more important to the progress and development of the state than the price of cotton, amount of wages or any other material thing. Much is being done to rid the state of typhoid fever, malaria, hookworm, and other preventable diseases but much more must be done before our people will be relieved of the physical pain, mental anguish, aIid stupendous financial loss through sickness and death from preventable diseases.\n\nIU-Bibliography:\n\nAmerican Journal of Public Health-Ameircan Public Health Association.\n\nAmerican Water Works Association Journal, Southeastern Section, 1932 (includes numerous references.) .\n\nOharacter Building-BUffalo, N.

If ev'ry singing bird were muteNo melody sweetened air Of violin, or harp, or flute! Wouldlife be quite as fair?\n\nAnd what would the world be like, my friends, If neVer a soul could hear? If harmOnies of richest blends Touched only the dullard's ear? What waste of symphony sublime, If nobodY understood, Nor felt aglow with tune or time! Would life be quite as good? And what would the world be like, at last, If voices had all grown dumb? No Music heard-save from the pastSince living hands all were numb! Nay! far more sweet the music playedTho' faltering oft, at bestBy an eager lad or a beaming maid, To make life rich and blest!-\n\nW. O. MIESSNER, Music Supervisors Journal, 19~O.\n\nI-Ea.rly Georgia. Music a.nd Musicians:\n\nA. Lowell Mason. Due to the fact that Georgia has produced few outstanding com-\n\nPOSers or performers, and that Georgia has no publishers to record the work of its artists, little is known of Georgia musicians.\n\nThis is indeed unfortunate for the music of one of Georgia's adopted sons, Lowell Mason, has echoed in the hearts of men all round the globe. Though not born in Georgia, he spent about twenty. Years in Savannah and hence may be truly claimed as one of Georgia's adopted sons.\n\nWhile working there as a bank clerk, he composed the hymns which have lifted the hearts of many from material things up to the plane of spiritual worship and praise.\n\nIt was dUring these years that he compiled his first book of music of which Dr. G. K. Jackson, the severest critic in Boston said, \"Much the best I have ever seen published and I do not hesitate to give it my most deCided approbation.\"\n\nThe title of this book, \"The Handel and Haydn Society Collection of Church Music, Harmonized for Organ and Pianoforte\",\n\n24\n\nbecame a faIniliar volume upon the shelves of the better class of American musicians. Its sale netted the composer over four thousand dollars, and caused him to abandon the commercial world for the musical profession, to the great advantage of religious music.\n\nHe moved to Boston and there pUblished OVer fifty manuals and was honored by being elected to the presidency of the Haydn Society. This gave him an opportunity to organize what is now called The Boston Academy of Music. . Thus Boston became the center of American musical culture, and Lowell Mason's influence spread into all fields of classical music. His religious work in the field of sacred hymns, however, remained the rock on which his fame rested. Few Georgians realize that the songs, \"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\", or \"Nearer My God to Thee\" or \"Watchman Tell Us of the Night\", were composed by an adopted son of Georgia.\n\nB. WesleY. No doubt Lowell Mason received much of his inspiration from\n\nthe songs of John and Oharles Wesley, who started the fire of Methodism upon the soil of Georgia with their hymns of evangelism. While Mason was influenced by these hymns, he must have been equally thrilled by George Whitfield's preaching and singing. The Wesleys and Whitfield wrote over sixty-five hundred hymns and chants, and Georgia may claim them as their adopted sons.\n\nO. Wilcox\n\n.\n\nIn 1827 Savannah produced another musician of great repute,\n\nJohn Henry Wilcox, the organist.\n\nD. Dr. McIntosh. Dr. McIntosh came from Vanderbilt where he was \"Principal of\n\nMusic Department\", to Emory at OXford, Georgia, in 1877 as \"Professor of Music\". He trained the first choir of Trinity Methodist Ohurch in Atlanta. He was for thirty years music editor of the Southern Methodist Ohurch. In his most popular book of songs, \"PraYer and Praise\" , the music to sixty-one of the hymns was written by him. Mrs. McIntosh wrote the music to \"He Leadeth Me\". \"Dr. McIntosh created his songs without the aid of any instrumentjust composed them in his soul, then hummed them and wrote them down.\"\n\nE. Blind Tom. One of the most outstanding negro musicians was a freakish\n\nprodigy called Blind Tom. He was noted for his ability to repeat upon the piano any rendition, no matter how intricate or difficult, which he had heard played. By some strange gift he could listen to any performer, then sit down to the piano and reproduce, note for note, expression for expression, to the minutest detail, the entire selection. Great audiences attended his exhibitions.\n\nF. Negro Music. Georgia receives much notice, musically, through thenegro and\n\nhis spirituals. This type of music is unique--a strange blending of primitive chants, and religious sentiment.x.In Macon Oounty, six\n\n25\n\n:,' : .-;:.;,; .~<.,,~~ ':.\\~~:: :.~:~ '~-(:'~.\",\n\n;C\"\":'.'.:. ;\"-,'; \"', .'.':\"\"' ; ,',. , ... \",,_ ~_ .__ _\n\n~\n\nC2,;\n\nmiles from any town and almost hidden Oy a great grove of mossy\n\noaks, stands a small building known to the colored folk as the\n\nOhurch of Glorious Hope. Here, may be found negro music in all its purity and earnestness.\n\nOn a sabbath afternoon, the sOlemn chants sound marvelously\n\nlike the liturgical dronings of a village of monks. Through the\n\ntrees drift-\"O my Lord; yes my Lord.....I'd lay down my life for my\n\nLord.....I'd give all I got for my Lord.\"\n\nG. Indian Music.\n\nThe musical history of Georgia would not be complete without\n\nreference to the ancient music of the Indians. Although the In-\n\ndians of Georgia were not great musicians, Yet their chants and\n\nfestival songs formed an important part of their lives. Two great\n\ntribes dwelt in Georgia, the Creeks and the Oherokees. Of these\n\nthe Oherokees were the most cUltivated and intelligent. Two of\n\ntheir tunes may be found in Grammar School Songs, by Farns-\n\nworth, published by Oharles Scribner's Sons.\n\nREFERENOES\n\nH. W. Odum~Folk Song and Folk Poetry as Found in the Secular Songs of Southern Negroes.\n\nA. E. Perkins-Negro Spirituals from the Far South.\n\nII-Modern Music and Musicians of Georgia:\n\nA. Interest in Music and Opportunities for Development.\n\n1. While at first glance Georgia does not appear to have pro duced a great number of well-known composers or performers, still the state cannot be called unmusical. It supported a regUlar appearance of the Metropolitan Opera Company for years, which attracted not only people from all parts of Georgia, but from neighboring states as well. Each year many noted artists and symphony orchestras are sponsored by the Music Olub, Oivic Ooncert Series, the Woman's ClUb, and other civic organizations.\n\n2. Affiliated with the Georgia Federation of Music Olubs are one hundred Junior and Senior Music Clubs scattered throughout the state. Boys and girls are eligible for membership in the Junior Club until the age of eighteen, when they join the Senior Club. These clubs have done much to stimUlate an interest in good music, not only by providing concerts by outside artists, but by encouraging local talent. Local musicians are regularly presented on the monthly programs of all the clubs. Through local, state, and national contests each year for members of the Junior Clubs and for the younger members of the Senior ClUbs, many young artists are discovered, stimulated to greater effort, and provided with opportUnities for appearances before the public. The contests include voice, piano, solo instruments of the orchestra, composition and In some instances, choruses. Perhaps more than anything else the contests have served to raise the standards of music teaching in the state.\n\n26\n\nGeorgia, through its music clubs, maintains a cottage at the MacDowell Colony at Peterboro, N. H. Each year, under the direction of Miss Evelyn .Jackson, a MacDowell Festival is held to raise money for this projact.\n\n3. Music in some form is found in all the colleges and universities of Georgia. In many cases, the place it is given is yet a small one. In some, as at Emory, it consists of Glee Club and Orchestra, and one or two courses in the summer school; others have flourishing music departments where excellent training may be had in voice and piano, as at Wesleyan, Agnes Scott, and Shorter; and in some instances degrees in music may be earned, as at Brenau.\n\n4. The importance of a musical education is' emphasized in the public schools in many parts of the state, where children are being given musical training through sight reading, music theory, chorus singing, composing original songs, study of piano, violin and other orchestral instruments, and through listening and learning to understand much of the best in music literature that is beyond their power of performance.\n\n15. The Parent-Teacher Associations of Georgia, with their slogans of \"More and Better Music in our Schools and Homes\", and \"Music for Every Child and Every Child for Music\", have in many cases not only helped to provide more and better music, but have provided music where none existed before. Sometimes the P. T. A. has paid one half and sometimes all of the salary of a music teacher in the schools when the Board of Education was not convinced of its value, or could not finance it. They have furnished instruments for orchestras, pianos, vietrolas, and other equipment needed by the Music Department. Music is included on all P. T. A. programs. Recently, Mothers' and Daddies' choruses have been formed in many associations.\n\n6. Choruses and Orchestras are springing up throughout the state. Macon has organized a symphony orchestra.. The All-State High School Chorus has met in Macon for the past two years, rehearsing intensively for two days and presenting a program for the Georgia Education Association on its closing night. The Atlanta Philharmonic Society, directed by L. G. Nilson, has given periodic concerts of the highest order, presenting such numbers as the second act of Aida, accompanied by the orchestra, and Verdi's Requiem.\n\nThe Atlanta All High School Choir, organized by L. G. Nilson, and consisting of about thirty-five boys and girls selected from the jUnior and senior high schools of Atlanta, has served the important function of raising and setting standards of tone quality, intonation, and types of music. The group has also served to bring the work of the schools into closer contact with the general pUblic by appearing at regular church services, and before various civic organizations. From time to time it' has relieved a church choir and llupplied the music, singing such numbers as Maunder's Cantata, Olivet to Calvary as well as many regular anthems and chorals. As\n\n27\n\nthe members of this group graduate from high school, they will\n\n2.:\n\nenter college glee clubs, or, if they remain in Atlanta, they may find\n\na place in the Philharmonic Ohorus.\n\n.\n\nAmong organizations of Georgia that have received nation-wide\n\nrecognition is the Emory Glee Club of Emory University. While\n\nEmory has no organized music department, this finely trained men's\n\nchorus, under the direction of Dr. M. H. Dewey, has toured many\n\ncities in the United States and in England with great credit to ita\n\nstate. The Emory Orchestra under Dr. Dewey also gives several\n\nconcerts during the year.\n\n7. Music in the churches is likewise receiving much attention\n\nand support. Many of the churches have excellent quartets as well\n\nas choruses which, in addition to the regular music for church\n\n!ervices, present from time to time the more extended forms of re-\n\nligious music in the way of cantatas and oratorios.\n\nB. Teachers and Oomposers.\n\nThere has never been a history of Georgia musicians published.\n\nHowever, by referring to old newspaper articles, and by interview-\n\ning people, the following information has been gleaned.\n\nSidney Lanier was not only the most noted of Georgia poets,\n\nbut a musician of marked ability. He obtained a position as a\n\nteacher in the North, and also a place as flute player in the Baltimore\n\nSymphony Orchestra. Perhaps the fact that he was a musician\n\nexplains the real musical quality of his poetry. His poem, \"The\n\nTrees and the Master\", has received several different settings.\n\nThere are in Georgia many musicians who are gifted, not only\n\nin interpreting the compositions of others, but in adding to Geor-\n\ngia's music bY their original compositions.\n\nAlfredo Barili, while not a native Georgian, has almost become\n\none by reason of his long residence here. He is a teacher and pianist\n\nof high rank, and numbers among his compositions many that are\n\nfavorites of all music lovers. Some of the best known pieces are\n\n\"Oradle Song\", \"The Butterfly\",-\"There Little Girl, Don't Ory.\"\n\nHugh Hodgson, a native Georgian, is known over the country\n\nas a concert pianist. He studied music at home and in Germany,\n\nand has done notable work in music courses in two of Georgia's\n\nuniversities. He is also a gifted composer, his \"Georgia Land\"\n\nhaving been adopted by the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs.\n\nThe words to this song were written by Miss Genie Terrill of Lump-\n\nkin, Ga. His book of \"Mother Goose Songs\" has also received wide\n\nrecognition.\n\nMrs. Bonita Orowe of Atlanta has many lovely compositions to\n\nher credit. \"The Garden Song\" won her a prize and national\n\nrecognition. \"Only Wait\" has been adopted for voice, piano, harp,\n\nviolin and cello.\n\nJane Mattingly, also of Atlanta, has given her attention mostlY\n\nto piano compositions suitable for children. One, \"The Oello\", is\n\narranged for piano and violin. Her pieces are listed in the Oon-\n\ngressional Library at Washington.\n\n28\n\not G. Negri has been arather prolific writer, mUch ot it being \"tor\n\nthe tun it\" he saYs, and much still being in manuscript. An overture to his opera, \"Cleopatra\", was performed by the Philharmonic Orchestra at one of its spring concerts last season.\n\nO. F. Linder, director of the Atlanta Oonservatory and new director ot the Philharmonic Orchestra, has written for the violin, solo voice, and for the church.\n\nMargaret Bartholomew, not only as a musician but as an editor oia music magazine, merits attention.\n\nDr. Oharles Sheldon, Elizabeth Hopson, Enrico Leide, Ben J. Potter, Harry Pomar, Billy Arnaud, O. W. Diekman, Arthur Talmadge ot Rome, Pfefferkorn at Gainesville, Mrs. Teasdale at Savannah, and a new-comer, Zachara of Gainesville, are all, in their various fields of music, helping to strengthen Georgia's musical il'owth by their compositions and work.\n\nLittle Strickland, about whom there is some controversy a! to whether she is Georgian or Virginian, both states wishing to claim her, has as one ot her best known compositions the oratorio, \"St. John, the Beloved.\" Grace Moore, in her recent concert in Atlanta, used \"Ma Linda Lou,\" by Strickland, as an encore.\n\nMrs. Florence Golson Bateman was born in Alabama but now resides in Georgia. She has composed a number of beautiful songs, perhaps the best known being, \"Spring Symphony,\" which has been presented many times with much credit to its composer.\n\nNan Bagby Stephens has written many pieces and has spent several summers at the MacDowell Oolony working on an opera. Her arrangement of Stanton's \"When the Little Boy Ran Away,\" is probably her best known work.\n\nNellie Womack Hines of Milledgeville, whose Georgia Land has been adopted by the Georgia P. T. A. as its official song, has written several compositions.\n\nMiss Kate Lee Harralson, ot Atlanta, whose Oherokee Rose ot Georgia is to be featured at the Bicentennial Oelebration in Savannah, has done much in enlightening the public concerning good music and its appreciation. O. Georgia's Oontributions to the Ooncert Stage.\n\nNor must we forget Georgia's contributIon to the concert stage. We point with pride to the work of Mrs. Oharles Dowman as concert pianist, and to Ruby Ohalmers and Ethel Beyer, both pianists and professional accompanists.\n\nByron Warner, tenor, will be remembered for his work as soloist with the Emory Glee Club and later for his singing on the opera stage in Europe.\n\nEdward Kane, tenor, winner ot Atwater Kent radio audition, has continued his musical career in New York.\n\nJanice Oalaway, (Grovanna Oollovia) ot LaGrange, and Patrick Killikellyof Savannah, have been accepted for Grand Opera.\n\nBoth Mrs. Eleanor Whittemore King and Mrs. Maurice Siegler, wete at One time well-known concert violinists.\n\n29\n\nRoland Hayes and Robinson, two Negroes of Georgia, are acquir ing fame in Anierica and Europe by their outstanding concerts.\n\nAmong the most noted present day religious singers is Oharles D. Tillman, whose songs are f111ed with spiritual truths and tolk lore which reach the hearts of his listeners.\n\nD. Negro Spirituals. Mention should be made of the negro-spirituals. These haTe\n\nbeen transcribed to note, mostly by the white man, and are fast gaining world-wide popularity. They are included on the programs of mltny glee clubs, though none, perhaps, sing them with the real understanding and fervor that negro glee clubs do. They seem to have grown from a two-fold origin-first, from the negroes heariIli their masters sing, and then from their slavery experiences. E. Lyrics of Georgia Poets Set to Music.\n\nWe could not leave the music of today without paying our respects to Georgia's poets and authors whose works have been set to music. Robert Loveman, wrote \"Georgia.\" It was set to music by Mrs. Lollie Belle Wylie, and adopted as the \"Official Song of Georgia\" bY the General Assembly in 1922.\n\nFrank L. Stanton, whose \"Mighty Lak a Rose,\" \"Just a WearYing for You,\" and \"Sweet Miss Mary,\" are universal favorites, wllliong be remembered for his tender poems. His \"Georgia Land\" to the tune of \"Maryland, My Maryland,\" is loved by all who know it.\n\nJoel Ohandler Harris' \"Songs and SaYings,\" are known all over the world. He has recorded many negro folk tunes, one of the best known being \"A Plantation Serenade.\"\n\nIII-Future of Music in Georgia:\n\nThe musical activities in Georgia are increasing year by year, and the art of music has begun to reach the mass of the people. In March the Southern Oonference for Music Education meets in Atlanta. The Oonference comprises thirteen southern states, and is one of the biggest things musically that has ever come to Georgia. It wlll bring some two hundred and fifty high school boys and girls to the All-Southern Ohorus and as many more for the All Southern Orchestra. These students will rehearse intensively for three days under nationally known conductors and wlll give a concert during the closing night of the Oonference. Nationall7 known educators and musicians will be present. Demonstrations wlll be given in all phases of music, instrumental and vocal. The stimulus that this conference wlll bring to music in the South and to Georgia in particular cannot be estimated.\n\nWe find everywhere an awakening interest in music in our schools and in:musical and civic organizations. The music chairman has become an important part of almost every organization, and the quality of music used is steadily improving.\n\nThe Atlanta Philharmonic Society is looking toward the time when Atlanta can produce her own Grand Opera, and is now preparing to g!.ve the whole of Faust in concert form. A series ot\n\n80\n\nSummer Operas is given at the University of Georgia at Athens, -using local talent for chorus and orchestra.\n\nThe public schools of Atlanta are looking forward to having, Within a few years, an All-nigh-School Symphony Orchestra, which will, in turn, make possible orchestras of a higher order in colleges and. universities, and later real symphony orchestras in the cities of our state.\n\nIn Atlanta a Festival Chorus of 1500 voices gives a concert at the City AUditorium every spring. In another year, it is planned to make this a three day Music Festival with a concert one night by elementary schools, one night by high schools, and one night by negro schools.\n\nMany original poems and songs are being written by Atlanta children. As they become more musically minded, more and more of them will use the art as a natural means of self-expression.\n\nConclusion\n\nJudging the future of music in Georgia by present trends, we cannot but feel that the empire State, in time, may take its place among the musical leaders of the nation.\n\nIV-Suggestions for Assembly Programs:\n\nOriginal poems and songs written by the children. \"Georgia\" by Robert Loveman-Lollie Bell Wylie.\n\n(Officially adopted as State Song bY General AssemblY, 1922). \"Cherokee Rose of Georgia\"-Kate Lee Harralson. \"Mighty Lak' a Rose\"-Stanton-Nevin. \"Sweet Miss Mary\"-Stanton-Niedllnger. \"In Maytime\"-Stanton-Oley Speaks. \"Morning\"-Stanton-Oley Speaks. \"Keep on Hopin' \"-Stanton-Heron-Macwell. \"When the Little Boy Ran Away\"-Stanton-Nan Bagby Stephens. \"Georgia Land\":\"\"'Stanton-Folk Tune (:My Maryland). \"Plantation Serenade\"-from Uncle Remus. \"Georgia's Colors\"-tune \"0 Mother Dear, Jerusalem.\" \"GoodShip Anne\"-tune \"A Capital Ship.\" \"Darkey's Lullaby\"-tune \"Humoresque\"-Dvorak.

All of these suggested activities have been successfully carried out in the Atlanta Public Schools, and have been correlated with the other subjects of the curriculum.\n\nThe earlY Indians of Georgia had little art, and very few symbols are to be found on excavated objects. When the colonists first made their settlements, it was a struggle to wrest a living from the soil, and there was no leisure time for cultural pursuits. During the War between the States, many of the growing cities of Georgia were demolished, and it was some time before they had recovered from the Reconstruction Period; so that art in Georgia has had little chance to develop. However, during the past few years there has been a rapid growth in art, music, and literature. The public schools are fostering this progressive spirit, and are laying the foundation for an artistic sense and a general knowledge of what constitutes the beautiful through an appreciation of form, color, and harmonious design.\n\nII-The Study of Georgia Cotton in Creative Art:\n\nThe studY of cotton lends itself easilY to the work of the school in industrial art activities and in other creative work in correlation with the studY of the farm, of textiles and in many other ways which are suggested below.\n\nA.

Primary Handwork-Dobbs. Stories of Industry-Chase. U. S. Government Bulletins,\n\nIII-Costumes in Georgia..\n\nThrough the ages, clothes have proven an interesting study. From the earliest days to the present time, clothes, their quality and quantity, have occupied much time and thought.\n\nCostumes of any people in any period contain certain elements. These elements identifY the period. The elaborateness of the costume depends upon the financial status of the section of the country in which it is found.\n\nB9\n\nAt a time when Georgia costumes were similar to those of Virginia, for ~conomic reasons, they were much simpler. The study of clothes >~>-:z..: in Georgia, from its founding on February 12, 1733, to the preseht. day, is an interesting one.\n\nWhen James Edward Oglethorpe, a man of nobility, came to Georgia, he wore elegant clothes. The costumes of the nobility of this period were made of very rich fabrics, satins, silks, and brocades. Embroidery, laces, and fine linens were used. Ruffled shirts with stocks of lace were worn. Tightfitting breeches made of color harmonizing with coat and waist-coat were worn. Light colored or white stockings were in vogue.\n\nThe women of this period wore very wide skirts. The bodices were very tight. Hoops were used to make the skirt stand out. Narrow ruffles were used a great deal on the skirt, at the neck-lines, down the front of the bodice, down the edges of the overskirt, and across the bottom of the petticoat. Deep ruffles of lace were worn on the edge of the sleeves, which usually stopped above the elbow.\n\nColors used at this time were light shades, often striped or brocaded with a flower design.\n\nThe hair was elaborately dressed. Wigs were used. Ribbons, garlands, and plumes were worn, not only on the coiffeur, but on the hats.\n\nThe constant elements for women were pointed bodices, full skirts, quilted petticoats, capes, fichUS, patches on face, and powdered wigs.\n\nThe constant elements for men were short breeches (knee), fancy waistcoats, stocks, and jabots, tri-cornered hats, lace in sleeves, buckles at knees and on shoes, powdered wigs tied back with ribbons.\n\nSince the majority of the early settlers in Georgia were of the poorer classes, their clothes were simpler and of coarser material than the typical costumes described above. The farmer and his wife gradually began to modify their clothes to suit their needs. Hoop skirts were discarded. Broad brimmed sunbonnets became the fashion. Men lengthened their trousers and began to wear broad-brimmed hats.\n\nDuring the Civil War period and until about 1890, the bustle was used to make the dress stand out just below the waist in the back. The skirts graduated from the floor length in the front to a train in the back. The bodice was tight, with long sleeves, and was gradually raised from the hip length to the normal waist line. Lines were smaller.\n\nDuring Civil War days and until 1890 the constant elements for women were full skirts with bustles, broad shoulders, small waists, poke bonnets, capes and shawls.\n\nThe constant elements for men were long trousers, and higher waisted coats, some with swallow tails, short vests, capes or shawls.\n\nThe constant elements for young girls were full skirts, short waists, dresses trimmed with lace and ribbon bows, and pantalettes with white lace or embroidery.\n\nThe negro men's costumes were similar to that of their masters, but made of coarser materials.\n\nThe constant elements for the negro mammies were full skirts, loose full waists of bright colored materials, white surplices and aprons, and bandanna handkerchiefs twisted around the heads.\n\n40\n\nFrom 1890 to 1905 we find the sleeves larger at the top, and the skirts '. a regulation length, still fUll enough to give ease in walking, since they \"2.; reached the floor or ground. Hats were much larger and were elabo-\n\nrately trimmed. It was at this time that the pompadour grew to a tremendous size, so large that it was necessary for milady to use false hair to make it stand as high as the style required. Hats that sat on top of this coiffeur required several hat pins to keep them from falling off.\n\nBy 1914 styles were changing to more severe lines. The dresses were shorter and more simple, and in many cases, the hair was cut or bobbed.\n\nAll during these years there were very few changes in men's clothes, except for sports. Short trousers called knickers were often used for sport wear.\n\nThe following books, illustrated, have in them costumes of the dates given:\n\nOolonial Days: Lads and Lassies of Other Days-Price-Silver Burdette 00.

Oora Harris' long cabin home in Rydal, Georgia, was built by an Indian, Ohief Pine Log, prior to 1830. Its only chimney is of handmade brick. While Mrs. Harris has added eleven rooms to the original building, they are in perfect harmony with the rest of the house.\n\nThe Spanish Missions established on a.u Georgia's coastal islands were next in line. These were built of coquina, sometimes ca.ued tabby, a mixture of crushed oyster shells and a cement made of burnt shells. The only authentic ruin is located six miles from St. Marys. This was the mission of Santa Maria of Guadeloupe and is still known as Mariana. The homes of Georgia.'s early settlers were crude buildings of logs and native timber.\n\n42\n\nThe outstanding ante-bellum homes were. of two distinct tn>es. Those of the ooastal islands were of the same material as the Spaniards used int1:lelr missions; that is, coquina. An interesting ruin of thisl tn>e-is-found at Cannons Point, the old Couper house on St. Simons ISland. Enough of the house stands to show the original. A short distance from the house where the kitchen stood, an old Dutch oven fire-place fifteen feet long with arched ovens of hand-made brick remains in an unusually good state of preservation.\n\nPossibly the two best examples of the ante-bellum home are Mimosa Hall in Roswell, Georgia, and the Ralph Small home in Macon. The interior of Mimosa Hall is pure Georgian. The walls are of solid brick plastered and checked like stone. The Ralph Small home has Greek Doric oolumns topped by a frieze of laurel wreaths. We can find examples of this style of architecture in almost every vicinity. Some other outstanding places in Georgia of this period are Bullock Hall and Barrington Hall at Roswell. A few other very interesting Georgia houses are:\n\nBradsh"
