The poet reflects on a family vacation to a Floridian island 30 years ago, contrasting it with the present by noting significant changes in both the environment and his own life as he revisits the location.\n\nRichard Blanco's poems, including 'Looking for the Gulf Motel,' rose to popularity amongst Americans by virtue of their originality and specificity as they regard Blanco's experience as a Cuban-American. Blanco, being one of the poets to read his poem at a Presidential election, also elevated his poems in American circles. 'Looking for the Gulf Motel' in particular, is still widely received and analyzed today at American schools and universities.\n\nI am thirty-eight, driving up Collier Boulevard,\n\nlooking for The Gulf Motel, for everything\n\nthat should still be, but isn’t...\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMatins [What is my heart to you]\n\nby Louise Glück\n\n‘Matins [What is my heart to you]’ by Louise Glück implores god to pacify the speaker’s anguish and the solitude that has exacerbated it.\n\nGlück has been compared to several seminal American poets including Emily Dickinson. She often explored deeply personal topics in her verses but used terse language that was not without moments of beautifully enlightening imagery or figurative language. Scenes rooted in nature and mythology, as well as religion, appear often in works like this one.\n\nWhat is my heart to you\n\nthat you must break it over and over\n\nlike a plantsman testing\n\nhis new species? Practice\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMaud Muller\n\nby John Greenleaf Whittier\n\n‘Maud Muller’ by John Greenleaf Whittier is a classic narrative ballad that recounts how the poor peasant, Maud, and an urban judge fantasize about getting married and living together. However, neither of them ever takes action, which fills their lives with regret.\n\nThe form and structure of this poem are rather typical of Romantic-era ballads, but this verse is unique in that it is an American pastoral Ballad. While the poets overseas in England were writing stories a lot like Maud's in their poetry, Whittier often put an American spin on his poems, rooting his scenes and images in the common experiences of American commoners.\n\nGod pity them both! and pity us all,\n\nWho vainly the dreams of youth recall.\n\nFor of all sad words of tongue or pen,\n\nThe saddest are these: “It might have been!”\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMedusa\n\nby Louise Bogan\n\n‘Medusa’ by Louise Bogan describes an encounter the speaker has with the eyes of Medusa and the eternal results of that meeting.\n\nWhen the bare eyes were before me\n\nAnd the hissing hair,\n\nHeld up at a window, seen through a door.\n\nThe stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead\n\nFormed in the air.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMorning Swim\n\nby Maxine Kumin\n\n‘Morning Swim’ by Maxine Kumin is a thoughtful lyric poem that’s written in couplets.

She was an extremely religious woman who supported better treatment of Indigenous people living in U.S. territories and states. Her poetry often concerned itself with ruminations on religion and nature.\n\nI do not know if, climbing some steep hill,\n\nThrough fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse I bought,\n\nOr whether in some mid-day I was caught\n\nTo upper air, where visions of God’s will\n\nPDF Guide\n\nOur Martyred Soldiers\n\nby Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\n‘Our Martyred Soldiers’ by Paul Laurence Dunbar is a moving poem that searches for consolation in the wake of the deaths of noble men.\n\nDunbar was an American poet and is remembered for his moving verse and powerful illustrations of life as a person of color in post-Civil War society. Not all his poems or novels deal with the effects of racism, yet poems like this one are clearly reflective of the effects such conflicts had.\n\nIn homes all green, but cold in death,\n\nRobbed of the blessed boon of breath —\n\nResting in peace from field and fray,\n\nOur martyred soldiers sleeping lay.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nOutward Bound\n\nby Helen Hunt Jackson\n\n‘Outward Bound’ by Helen Hunt Jackson is a rousing sonnet that dispels one’s fears of traveling into the unknown with a reminder that we make the same bold excursions every day of our lives without ever acknowledging it.\n\nJackson was born in Amherst, MA in 1830 and died 54 years later in San Francisco, CA. As both a writer and poet she documented a wide range of American subjects that, for better or worse, she helped mythologize. This is a good, although not particularly famous example of American poetry.\n\nThe hour has come. Strong hands the anchor raise;\n\nFriends stand and weep along the fading shore,\n\nIn sudden fear lest we return no more,\n\nIn sudden fancy thaThe safer stays\n\nPDF Guide\n\nPrayers of Steel\n\nby Carl Sandburg\n\n‘Prayers of Steel’ by Carl Sandburg is an original poem.

He was known as a lyricist for Broadway musicals and even made appearances on both comedy and radio shows.
