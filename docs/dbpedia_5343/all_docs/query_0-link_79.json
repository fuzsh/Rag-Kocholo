AL RINGLING GHLY HONORED BY BARABOO AND s, LEGISLATURE Made Subject of Great Popular Demonstration By ‘‘The Old Folks at Home”’ in Baraboo While State Legislature Passes Unique Resolutions On June 24 the citizens of Baraboo made holiday in honor of Al Ringling, the greatest equestrian director of all time. All business was suspended and in the court house’ yard speech after speech of eulogy and appreciation was made to great and vociferous applause and a™probation. At Madison,.Wis., the day previous (June 23) the State Legislature paused in its proceedings to pay tribute to this great, kind-hearted, lovable man. Under suspension of the rules the following resolutions were read and adopted by unanimous vote: Whereas, Albert Ringling, eldest of the celebrated family of showmen, is now suffering from prolonged illness at his home in Baraboo; and, Whereas, No citizen of Wisconsin or of any other State has afforded, in company with his associated brothers, pleasure to so many children of the country, and perhaps adults as well; and, Whereas, He easily has become the foremost circusman of the world and contributed more than any other to elevate arenic exhibitions to the high and honorable plane which they now occupy; and, Whereas, The great Ringling circus has conferred po little distinction upon this state by having its origin and retaining its “home” here; and, Whereas, Tomorrow the city of Baraboo is to give a public demonstra- | tion of appreciation of the liberality and public spirit of Mr. Ringling; therefore be it Resolved, That the assembly, the senate concurring, on behalf of all the people of the commonwealth, hereby records its admiration for Mr. Ring- ling as a man and for the genius dis- played in the organization and op- eration of his great circus: and, furthermore, it desires earnestly to express the hope of his early restora- tion to health. Resolved further, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be trans- mitted forthwith to Mr. Ringling. Al Ringling could not participate in the great demonstration in his honor, but from his bedroom window he could see the crowds, hear the ap- plause and sense the hearty and genuine appreciation. His home is scarcely a block from the court house and it was here that this most unique function centered. (Continued on page 4.) AL RINGLING “Eldest of Messrs. Ringling Brothers. world famous as a showman and acknowledged to be the greatest arenic director-general of all time.” HILLIARD CAST FOR PART OF A REAL BREWER IN N.Y. JUNE 25 | Let’s Hope That the Wise Men of the East Have Not Spoiled a Cracking Good Actor In Order To Make a Bum Brewery President Robert Hilliard, the actor, husband of the daughter of the late James Ev- erard, was named president of the James Everard Breweries at a meet- ing of the directors held June 24. Changes in policy and management were announced as well as the resig- nation of David M. Neuberger, vice- president, which took effect on last Friday. Behind these announcements is a story of dissension in the management of the late brewer's property and of a new independent brewing company, which is to be launched by Mr. Neu- berger. This company practically re- quires only the legal steps to be or- ganized completely now, and Mr. Neu- berger promised at the meeting that in a few days he would publish the names of the men to be associated with what he termed the largest in- dependent brewery in the United States, Mr. Neuberger declined to tell what had been the differences which had (Continued on page 94.) PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR RATE TILT This Corporation, Which Is Largely Foreign Owned, Given Credit for Having Pro- posed Scheme Originally |And for Standing Pat When Others Would Reconsider Al G. Field returned to his home from the East last week, where he had been in conference with other leading spirits of UMPA in regard to ways and means for fighting the outrage- ous raise in theatrical rates. Mr. Field states that there will positively be no show sent out with- out the unanimous consent of all man- agers in the United Managers’ Pro- tective Association. He also states that many roads are feeling the pinch caused by loss of theatrical traffic since the shows were pulled off the road, Lignon Johnson says that practi- cally all roads see that the raise is a| blunder and are ready and willing to rescind their action, but that the Penn- sylvania Railroad insists “Apon stand- ing pat. If this foreign-owned railroad de- feats the wishes of the American roads to ameliorate conditions for showmen it is proposed that the lat- ter center their wrath and reprisals upon it alone. The tilt was a colossal blunder. The only interests that can pos- sibly benefit by it are those of moving picture people. These latter can send a whole show by express in a box 12x12x12 at an average cost of about eighty cents. The railroads have to split even this negligible sum with the express com- panies. They get perhaps forty cents out of it. By raising the rates they practically make it impossible for managers to patronize the roads and are delivering all business over to the movie folks to their own loss and undoing. “As if the business of eating on a dining car were not sufficiently pain- ful and engrossing, the Pennsylvania Railroad has devoted the back of its menu cards to an argument for the repeal of the ‘full crew’ laws of New Jersey and Pennsylvania,”’ says Har- per’'s Weekl) This is the ‘gist of it: Twenty-one railroads in Pennsyl- vania and New Jersey last year paid in employment of superfluous brake- men $1,702,407. That would have bought 170 steel coaches. It would have bought 70 locomotives. It would have paid for 57,000 tons of rails. It would have returned five per cent on $34,000,000. It would have block (Continued on page 94.) JOHN R. FREULER Mr. Freuier, widely known in the mo- tion picture field, has succeeded Harry E. Aitken as president of the Mutual Film Corporation. HAGENBECK AND WALLACE SHOWS HUB DEEP INMUD AT OWATONNA A Soft Lot Held Them Fast and Caused Loss Of a Stand, But Quick Think- ing and Generalship More Than Retrieved All the Loss Sustained We no longer have four seasons in this country. The climate is chang- ing. This year, at any rate, we are having experience with what in other climes is known as the “rainy” and “dry” seasons. That is to say, showmen have ex- perienced the rainy season and are devoutly hoping that it will be fol- lowed by a dry season. It rained on the Hagenbeck-Wal- lace Shows at Owatonna, Minn. Whew! How it did rain. And they were on a soft lot! Despite the fact that they made the gamest kind of an effort to tear down and load quickly it simply could not be done. Everybody worked like a Trojan. The elephants were pressed into serv- ice and helped push heavy dens and tableaux wagons through the ooze, but the latter seemed bottomless and al- most as treacherous as quicksand. At nine o'clock the next morning they were still mostly on the lot.

Home, aptly described as a “play charac- ter and atmosphere,” with the repu- tation of Irving Cobb to back it, a charming picture of the South, its people, politics and manners, with a splendid cast and a fresh and unusual story, had its premier at the Cort Theater last night. The play is an adaptation of the fa- mous “Judge Priest” stories of Irving S. Cobb, the stage version being the result of an ideal collaboration of Bayard Veiller and Mr. Cobb, the former being responsible for the dra- matic spirit and splendidly developed climaxes, and the latter furnishing the witty and quaintly Southern lines and charming characterizations. The announcement of the premier some weeks ago created some intrest; the presence of Mr. Cobb on the board- walk, for he had come to witness the first night, strengthened it, and the house was crowded—and delighted. Thomas A. Wise, playing the part of Judge Priest, has quaint humor and a lovable nature. He appears in the role better than in any part he has taken before in his long career. He has the ability and opportunity to make this characterization a stage classic. Willis P. Sweatnam, playing Jeff, the “jedge’s colored servant,” shares the triumph with Thomas A. Wise. His work, although unimpor- tant in the progress of the play, is a feature and adds to its success. Phoebe Foster made Sally a very charming Southern girl, and Eugene O’Brien, as Carter, did his work with vigor and finish. Cassius Nash, the ambitious prosecutor, was effectively done by Richard Hale. The very name of the character calls for an actor able to put meanness, spite and unethical ambition into human rep- resentation, and Mr. Hale made this difficult and “hateful” business a masterpiece.—FOSTER, The House of Glass TH: HOUSE OF GLASS—A play in four acts by Max Marcin.

There seemed to be slowness of action at times, as if the cast was dubious of the intelligence of the audience to follow them. But it will be an easy matter to increase the “tempo” of action. Miss Ryan's interpretation of her many-sided part was remarkable and almost perfect. She will require only a few more appearances to accustom herself to the new role, and then her suecess is assured. Frederick Burt, as her husband, Harvey Lake, was exceptionally good in his strong char- acter creation, and Harry Brown, as McClellan, the attorney, gave as fine and strong a portrait of the aitruistic man-of-briefs as has been seen on this stage of many celebrities. Thomas Finlay, as Carroll, the detective, played well the role of the important part, maintaining a restraint that made him quite unlike the usual blus- tering, boisterous headquarters man. —FOSTER. E. A. WEIL Mr. Weil is publicity promoter for H. H. Frazee. evening of a life of interest and great popularity, received a rather serious jolt last night at the Apollo Theater when Mary Ryan, with a capable sup- porting company, won immediate fa- vor in Cohan & Harris’ newest offer- ing, The House of Glass. The premier was well attended—it was a typical boardwalk audience, a cosmopolitan one—and the drama of New York life appealed to it. The play was fresh, well constructed, and acted with unusual smoothness and finish. The success of the first night indicates that Miss Ryan will have pop- ularity in her new piece by Max Mar- cin, and it is perhaps safe to say that this popularity will be even greater than that she enjoyed in Jane Cowl’s creation of Mary Turner in Within the Law. Unlike so many dramas of the type, The House of Glass is not overbur- dened with melodramatic flights; in- deed, there is a calmness and sincer- ity throughout that in no way detracts from a_e well-planned construction, aiming for intensity and the retention of interest on the part of the audience.

Theater the Follies Enthusiastic New York ception Gets Re- New York, June 24.—The first night decision of New Yarkers attendant at the new Ziegfeld Follies at the New Amsterdam Theater is that it is a worthy book, tunes that are tune- ful and lyrics that are lyrical united with a notable cast and wonderful scenery. In short that it is the best of its kind that Ziegfeld has offered. In other words the best New York has had up to date. Ina Claire is wonderful, an immedi- ate hit, especially im her song on Marie-Odile. ie * Granville, Ed Wynn, Miss Mae urray and Miss Anna Pennington are@outstanding hits. Not least is BertfWilliams as the bait for the lion in the motion pic- ture hunt. as Miss Justine Johnstone wears a glowing costume in the national col- ors. None should wear it more grace- fully, for Miss Johnstone is ready to admit with the foremost of her ad- mirers that she is the prettiest fe- male in America. Newspaper comment gallops with the public approval. Follows some comments: The World: “The 1915 edition of the Follies is far and away superior to the eight big summer shows that have borne the same family name.” The Times: “Particularly gor- geous.” The Tribune: “Surpassed its prede- cessors.” The Sun: “More splendid to the eve than ever.” The Evening Telegram: first nighters fairly gasp.” The Evening World: lacking.” The Evening Post: “The scenes follow each other so swiftly that al- “Made the “Nothing most before you know they are on they are off.” Taken all in all a unanimous ver- dict of praise.

ROBERT GRAU Intimate and Important Revelations Appertain- ing to the Larger and Finer Phases of the Business A review of the vaudeville season of 1914-'15 reveals the importance of the so-called “headliner” as never before, moreover the supply of genuine drawing cards on whom a management can rely to attract the public to the box-office irrespective of the general program was never so inadequate, yet as evidence that such feature acts are an absolute necessity one has only to observe the results at the Palace Theater, where the receipts have varied to such an extent that the old theory that it is not possible to determine the drawing capacity of individuals no longer holds good. ‘ During a period of four weeks practically every Keith house in Greater New York played to capacity, due to an exchange of star acts. Calve, Nazimova, Tanguay and Evelyn Nesbitt were the stars to attract alike, and but for the new factors of temperament and illness, with which the management had to cope with, necessitating the withdrawal of heavily advertised attractions to an extent never before recorded in vaudeville annals, the final results would have been immeasurably better. It so happened that the season's biggest box-office attractions were the most troublous. Calve, the biggest card vaudeville has ever had, played just six and a half weeks. It is a fair question whether the profits on these were sufficient to atone for the persistent upheaval created both when the diva sang and when she disappointed. Undoubtedly had Calve been in condition to stand a prolonged tour of the country she could have earned $100,000 this season, and she would have been cheap for the managers even at $3,000 a week. ; But Calve disappointed through sheer inability to sing twice daily. She is still a great artist unwilling to appear before the people when not at her best. The writer warned the diva not to undertake to appear in consecutive weeks. Of all the grand opera stars Calve was ever the least reliable. Never- theless with her it was not temperamental, she was always the greatest sufferer herself. For ten years at the Metropolitan Opera House Calve depended on two roles, Carmen and Santuzza. Eva Tanguay revealed herself this season as a box-office magnet wher- ever she appeared. Eva disappointed so often that one wonders whether she does not regard such procedure as “good business.\"\" Once she left the Palace program in the middle of the week. Then she was truly ill. Two weeks later Eva refused to open because Walter Kingsley’s “copy” relegated her to second place. This was indeed a new wrinkle in the line of capriciousness. Three times the Tanguay was announced at the Colonial Theater before she actually ; opened. In Baltimore she quit after opening strong. The business staff of the Palace Theater were converted into veritable impresarios the greater portion of the season. One week the headliners were changed almost daily; the spectacle of the Palace officials seeking substitutes at the eleventh hour, so common at Fortieth and Broadway, has been on view so often at Forty-seventh street that a new dignity has been attained by modern vaudeville, namely—‘“The disappointment sign.” At least three times such a sign confronted incoming audiences at the Palace. Even the amazing novelty of people getting their money back be- cause of a change in “headliners” is now nothing unusual. But with all that has happened there in the last few months the Palace is one great institution and always the final selection for its program is the best attainable. Those who “pick” for this model two-a-day house are masters of booking craft. This is proved in the selection of opera stars as well as in the distinetly vaudeville attractions. All of the former making debuts at the Palace have “made good.” Carl Jorn, Orville Harrold, Caroline White and David Bispham had their engagements extended, while Calve is still as great an asset as ever. : Unquestionably the greatest success of the past season in vaudeville was achieved by Alla Nazimova in War Brides, an attraction which held the boards at the Palace for three consecutive weeks with scarcely an empty seat at any performance. Few, however, of the new playlets presented at the Palace during 1914-'15 were of that quality to procure extended bookings, though in some of these stars of the first magnitude were cast for the leading roles. Helen Ware and Charlotte Walker had excellent vehicles, Blanche Walsh, always popular in the two-a-day, scored anew. It was with its dancing acts that the Palace sustained the majority of the season's “layout.” Of these Bessie Clayton was perhaps the most successful, greatly due to good showmanship. It is significant, too, that the vogue of modern dancing has not eliminated the time-tried favorites of the toe dan- cing era. Like Miss Clayton, Adelaide and Hughes—never so popular as now—have had nothing to fear from the crop of modern dancers. Also they have outclassed the newcomers through sheer versatility. The most successful of the entertainers among women are still the same as in other seasons. Irene Franklin, Gertrude Hoffman, Trixie Friganza, Emma Carus, Belle Blanche and Belle Baker are names with which to conjure, and look where they will the men who control modern vaudeville’s destiny see no indication of a succession to their artistry. An acquisition to the ranks of such established favorites is indeed an event, as was instanced in the way vaudeville welcomed Nan Halperin, about the only addition to the standard women singles. A lesser activity among vaudeville producers may be explained through the diffleulty in procuring consecutive bookings. The vaudeville manager must be “shown,” and this means in modern times an outlay of thousands of dollars staked against the verdict not of one man with authority to speak for all, but even the theaters under one management have different experts to pass on the fitness of such acts. This is a phase of the situation to greatly restrict pro- ductivity. There are fewer capable producers of spectacular numbers today than a decade ago. Two of these, Messrs. Lasky and Rolfe, are now strong (Continued on page 16.) Shakespeare’s Corner By Henry Bayard THE CHARM OF CLEOPATRA In what does consist the alluring power of Cleopatra? Whence comes her cleverness in enslaving ‘“‘the man of men,” Antony, and of leading him and of hurling him whither she wishes it—to thraldom, to ruin and to death? Of course, at the outset, we may say that her charm arises essen- tially from the fact that she ever is a womanly woman acting in a womanly fashion with woman's wits and wom- an’s wiles. “But that’s not it,” as she says herself. We have to go deeper to find the reason why this unhand- some Egyptian becomes the Venus Victrix of the world. Unhandsome, the word has slipped from my pen, and I keep it, for it comes from no less an authority than one of her contemporaries, Plutarch; and, moreover, no matter how mor- bidly attractive may appear the daughters of Old Nile, we all know that there is not, there can not be beauty in them; they have neither the noble sevevity of Greece nor the ma- jesty of Re e; they are only the way- ward wome. of the wild world. We have, ‘therefore, to go elsewhere to find the whole secret of Cleopatra's absolute dominion. Perhaps we may find it in this passage of hers: “See where he is—who’s with him— what he does— (I did not send you.) If you find him sad, Say I am dancing; if in mirth, re- port That I am _ sudden sick! Quick! and return. Charmian. Madam, methinks if you did love him dearly You do not hold the method to enforce The like of him. Cleopatra. What should I do, I do not? Charmian. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing. Cleopatra. Thou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him. Charmian. Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear. In time we hate that which we often fear.” The artful Cleopatra knows that the best way to inflame the passion she has excited is to run counter to it. It is the great secret of coquettes when sure of their power. If Antony wishes for amusement and asks, “What sport tonight?” she advises him to hear what the ambassadors from Rome have to say, but as soon as he shows some inclination to go where the voice of duty and honor call him, she at once intoxicates his miné with the thought of pleasure. Listen to her speaking to him, and in his poor words of answer see how easily “the triple pillar of the world is transformed into a strumpet's fool”: “I know, by that same eye, there’s some good news. What says the married woman?— You may go; Would she had never given you leave to come! Let her not say ‘t is I that \"keep you here; I have no power upon you, hers you are. Antony.

THE CASTLES OFFERED THREE THOUSAND PER WEEK Palace Theater Management Negotiating With Noted Dancers To Appear All Summer at Beautiful Vaudeville House—Object To Playing on Sunday New York, June 26.—The manage- ment of the Palace Theater is reported to be negotiating with Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Castle for the dancers to play an all-summer engagement at the Palace Theater at a weekly salary of $3,000. Up to the present writing the nego- tiations have not been consummated, owing to the fact that the Castles balk at playing on Sundays. Unless they accede on this point there is lit- tle likelihood of the engagement be- ing made. The Castles played the Palace this weeh and incidentally smashed all previous house records, sell-outs being recorded for every performance dur- ing the entire week. Following the phenomenal business, it was generally thought that they would be held over for the coming week, but previous ar- rangements made for Eva Tanguay to play off her postponed engagement eliminated this. possibility, as it is stated that the cyclonic comedienne’s J.,L. & S. Lease American, Chi. Chicago, June 26.—Jones, Linick & Schaefer have leased the beautiful American Theater located on the West Side to the Finn-Heiman Circuit, which adds another to their large list. Sam Kahl is the booking manager. If rumors are true that both Cohan & Harris and Al Woods are trying to get the Colonial Theater for musical comedy, and rumors that McVicker’s will be booked from the Majestic building make it seem that the Jones, Linick & Schaefer interests will be de- voted almost exclusively to motion pictures. At one time during the past yvear this combination controlled seven family theaters in the city limits, but these have either been disposed of or the policy changed until now only three remain. New Act for Ruth Roye New York, June 25.—Ruth Roye has had a new act, consisting of six exclusive songs and patter, written for her by Charles McCarron, author of Poor Pauline, She Used To Be the Slowest Girl in Town, and She Lives Down in Our Alley, the latter number used successfully all of last season by Miss Roye. McCarron is also writing new num- bers for Grace DeMar for the coming season. Former Actress Suicides New York, June 25.—Kitty Joyce, a former popular actress during the days of Koster & Bial, died yesterday from injuries received when run over by a train at Eleventh avenue and Forty-ninth street. It is the belief of the police that the injuries were sustained in an attempt at suicide. During the past several years the woman's propensities for attempting to end her life have gained her the name of “Suicide Kitty.” contract specifies that she is to have the exclusive headline honors on all bills on which she appears.

New York, June ova Tanguay’s reputed ability to attract capacity to whatever theater she may be playing, regardless of conditions, suffered a severe setback when a less than sixty per cent capacity audience greeted the cyclonic comedienne at the first performance of this week’s engagement. A series of disappointments on the part of Miss Tanguay has evidently soured many vaudeville patrons on whom she formerly held all house records, and until Miss Tanguay makes good on the promise of the managers that she will henceforth consider the public first, last and all the time, it is evident that the unique position she once held will be in jeopardy. At this afternoon’s performance the lower floor was comfortably filled, but the balconies contained a mere handful. That Miss Tanguay realized the facts in the matter is un- doubted, as she never before worked harder to gain the plaudits of an audience. To give credit where credit is due, it must be said that she suc- ceeded admirablY and easily scored the hit of a bill that contained practically all hits No. 1—Current News Pictorial, running fifteen minutes.

Sixteen minutes, in one; four bows. No. &8—William Courtleigh, assisted by De Witt C. Jennings, furnished some superfine acting in a two-character sketch by William C. De Mille, entitled The Man Higher Up. Courtleigh portrays the part of a physician whose sweetheart, twenty years before, had suffered ignominiously at the hands of a politician, “The Man Higher Up,” and whom the physician has hounded through all the years by means of letters, finally bringing him to a state of mental collapse and seeking the services of the physician. Once in his hands the physician so plays upon the man’s mind that the psychological effect causes his death from heart disease. While the theme is not new, the sketch is well written.

The bill is varied and ran smoothly. An ecighteen-minute reel of pictures showing the Vanderbilt cup race through the Exposition grounds at Frisco was intensely interesting and very timely inasmuch as all Chicago is talking of the wonderful race which was cun at the new Chicago last Saturday. The photography is the cameramen must be given credit for being «nm ths job every minute as three thrilling lerts are and from such favorable points of vantage that one would almost believe the pills had been rehearsed.

CHANGING WHITE RATS’ NAME Brooklyn, N. Y., Editor The Billboard: A New York morning paper has a headline, June 26, 1915. “Who Knows a Better Name Than White Rats?” | The article tells its own story. The name White Rats is no longer popular with the of- ficial staff, and a new catch phrase, as the article states, is now wanted. Why a new catch phrase and why a hew name? As you well know I have been saying for some time that the White Rats is a thing of the past, but I did not think that they would haul down their flag except as a last resort, Shades of George Fuller Golden and the mem- orable eight who created the White Rats of America! In the short space of three years from a position of power and strength to one where they are compelled to try and dodge the issues by a change in name. It is true that thousands of members’ dollars were spent to make the name ‘‘White Rats’’ a symbol of actors’ organized strength, but the story of the last three years needs no repetition for the an- swer is here; lack of real business tactics and laying down to conditions imposed by the oppo- sition have made of the name White Rats a by- word of impotency. What's in a name if the principles behind them are the same. If I re- member rightly there is a ‘‘catch phrase’’ im- portant in all introductory White Rat proceed- ings, ‘‘be brave and love each other.'’ Why de- sert the good ship ‘‘Ratland’’ a new and untried ship? You are going at it wrong. Stick to the ship, boys, but change your crew, your ship is all right. It is the master and crew who need replacing. To call a weakling Napoleon, George Washington or Theodore Roosevelt does not make the weakling strong. The fault in the White Rats is more than its name. When they change the name let them change their principles and become again an Organization to be respected by the vaudeville actors of this country. Out of a mountain comes a mole hill. In the reports of progress made during the past year by the White Rats appears this lonely piece of news: ‘‘We have reduced our debt on the clubhouse $21,000.\"\" Three short years ago this organization claimed a membership of 11,000 men and women and a bank balance of $250,000--with no debts. Today they report, after three years, they have reduced a debt $21,000. Is this $21,000 the bill for the fur- niture and fixtures that compelled a ways and means committee of that organization to make a personal appeal to the members to donate a few dollars apiece last October? If so, the building xs still as heavily mortgaged as form- erly. What real benefit has been accomplished during the last three years which will show that the White Rats, as a body, has made the What manager or agent has been induced to issue a respectable contract. What sowerguy manager has been compelled to respect the real per- former and stop his canning habit, and what agent has been compelled to live up to the so- ealled White Rat law and cease extracting over five per cent as his commission charge? What has been done with the so-called charity fund to relieve the distress of many actors during this season? Nothing absolutely nothing but—reduce $21,000 the debt of the club that is being used by actors and nonprofessionals as general mem- bers. No, good White Rats, don’t change your name, but change your act; get new material; get a new manager; get a new agent—i. e. keep your name but change your crew—that’s the answer. Respectfully yours, HARRY DE VEAUX. Note—We dissent from Mr. De Veaux’s opinion. The ‘‘White Rats’’ was, is and ever will be a most unfortunate selection for the name of an organization. It is especially ill- chosen for a union organization. A rat is a repulsive, detestable, loathsome creature, which suggests nothing but disgust and feelings of ex- treme averston. The adjective ‘‘white” redeems the word rat not at all. In fact a white rat is only a freak rat—a little mere revolting and noxious then the common vermin. A change of name—any change—is a thing devoutly to be desired—The Editors, NOMADS Suggested as the New Name of the White Rats With characteristic and becoming modesty Pob Nome suggests ‘‘Nomads’’ as a fitting new name for the White Rats. Do you get it?

Laurence & San- dusky, of Vancouver J. M. McLean, writing under date of June 19 from Vancouver, B. €., says: ‘‘There is a matter before the courts here in reference to the copyright law that should be of interest to producers and playwrights of the United States. “George M. Cohan is suing Messrs. Laurence and Sandusky for royalty on Officer 666, which they produced here about a year ago. The mat- ter has been dragging for nearly a year and an order was made in Chambers yesterday that if the case was not set for trial within five days} it would stand dismissed. “The excuse for the delay is that Stationer’s Hall, London, is closed and proof of copyright could not be obtained. There is no copyright law in Canada as far as theatrical productions are concerned, but whether the fact that a play has been entered at Stationer’s Hall will alter matters will be the effect of the decision in this case. Should Cohan win it will establish a precedent as far as B,. C. is concerned, but will not be binding on the other provinces of Can- ada. However, should a similar case arise in any of the other provinces it is most likely that the judge hearing it will follow the B. C. de- cision. “I shall advise you of the result of this trial and if a written indement_is civen 1 will for: THEATER OWNERS PROTEST New York, June 28.—About a dozen theater managers, their attorneys or representatives of the U.
