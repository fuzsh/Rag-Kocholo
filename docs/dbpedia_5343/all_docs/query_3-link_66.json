        "text": "PDF Guide\n\nI had been hungry, all the Years\n\nby Emily Dickinson\n\n‘I had been hungry, all the Years’ by Emily Dickinson comes to the ironic realization that a fulfilled desire can be disappointing and anticlimactic rather than satisfying.\n\nDickinson and Walt Whitman are often mentioned in the same breath as the two most influential American poets of the 19th century. Yet their lives and the circumstances of their recognition couldn't have been more different. After a relatively normal and sociable adolescence, Dickinson became an increasing recluse as she got older, though she kept regular correspondence. The realities of her solitude often appear in her poetry though few are as implicit as this one.\n\nI had been hungry, all the Years—\n\nMy Noon had Come—to dine—\n\nI trembling drew the Table near—\n\nAnd touched the Curious Wine—\n\nPDF Guide\n\nI saw a man pursuing the horizon\n\nby Stephen Crane\n\n‘I saw a man pursuing the horizon’ by Stephen Crane is a short but incredibly moving poem about chasing impossibilities with multiple interpretations.\n\nAlthough he only wrote a single poetry collection, which was published in 1895 as \"The Black Riders, and Other Lines,\" Stephen Crane's lines of verse touch on a variety of timelessly American and human experiences. Poems such as this one reveal his compellingly nuanced understanding of people's contradictory natures, displaying both a capacity for ironic observation and hopeful earnestness.\n\nI saw a man pursuing the horizon;\n\nRound and round they sped.\n\nI was disturbed at this;\n\nI accosted the man.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nI, Maximus of Gloucester, to You\n\nby Charles Olson\n\n‘I, Maximus of Gloucester, to You’ by Charles Olson explores human existence and its several intricacies – love, uncertainty, identity, and the foibles of modern society.\n\nCharles Olson is a prominent figure in American poetry, well recognized for his contributions to the \"Black Mountain Poets\" literary movement. Despite being raised and teaching in America, the poet's impact extended beyond national lines due to his vast style and attention to the link between language and the real world. His poem 'I, Maximus of Gloucester, to You' exemplifies his deep engagement with place and history.\n\nOff-shore, by islands hidden in the blood\n\njewels & miracles, I, Maximus\n\na metal hot from boiling water, tell you\n\nwhat is a lance, who obeys the figures of\n\nPDF Guide\n\nLike A Flower In The Rain\n\nby Charles Bukowski\n\nBukowski’s ‘Like A Flower In The Rain’ is a clear-cut poem describing the odd lovemaking of a couple. Bukowski does not shy away from noting their raw conversation in the text.\n\nCharles Bukowski, a German-American poet, brought a unique perspective to his writing, including in 'Like A Flower In The Rain.' His American experiences, especially in Los Angeles, influenced his straightforward style and focus on real-life interactions. Bukowski’s background helped shape his approach, blending his cultural insights with a raw depiction of human relationships.\n\nI cut the middle fingernail of the middle\n\nfinger\n\nright hand\n\nreal short\n\nPDF Guide\n\nLooking for Judas\n\nby Adrian C. Louis\n\nAdrian C. Louis’ ‘Looking for Judas’ is about how the Christian religion played a pivotal role in order to conquer the Native American people. This piece revolves around the central image of “blood.”\n\nAdrian C. Louis, an American poet with Native American heritage, often writes about the experiences of indigenous peoples. In 'Looking for Judas,' he reflects on how white settlers used religion to impose their will on Native Americans. Louis’s work sheds light on these historical and ongoing issues, providing a critical view of their impact.\n\nWeathered gray, the wooden walls\n\nof the old barn soak in the bright\n\nsparkling blood of the five-point mule\n\ndeer I hang there in the moonlight.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nLooking for the Gulf Motel\n\nby Richard Blanco\n\n‘Looking for the Gulf Motel’ by Richard Blanco explores memories and loss through an autobiographical lens. The poet reflects on a family vacation to a Floridian island 30 years ago, contrasting it with the present by noting significant changes in both the environment and his own life as he revisits the location.\n\nRichard Blanco's poems, including 'Looking for the Gulf Motel,' rose to popularity amongst Americans by virtue of their originality and specificity as they regard Blanco's experience as a Cuban-American. Blanco, being one of the poets to read his poem at a Presidential election, also elevated his poems in American circles. 'Looking for the Gulf Motel' in particular, is still widely received and analyzed today at American schools and universities.\n\nI am thirty-eight, driving up Collier Boulevard,\n\nlooking for The Gulf Motel, for everything\n\nthat should still be, but isn’t...\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMatins (Unreachable Father, when we were first…)\n\nby Louise Glück\n\n‘Matins (Unreachable Father)’ focuses on the experiences and realizations of a people learning and unlearning to worship their God.\n\nWhen it comes to American Literature, Louise Glück will always be known as a major contributor. This masterpiece of hers handling religion as a topic is a good addition to American Literature.\n\nWe never thought of you\n\nwhom we were learning to worship.\n\nWe merely knew it wasn’t human nature to love\n\nonly what returns love.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMatins [What is my heart to you]\n\nby Louise Glück\n\n‘Matins [What is my heart to you]’ by Louise Glück implores god to pacify the speaker’s anguish and the solitude that has exacerbated it.\n\nGlück has been compared to several seminal American poets including Emily Dickinson. She often explored deeply personal topics in her verses but used terse language that was not without moments of beautifully enlightening imagery or figurative language. Scenes rooted in nature and mythology, as well as religion, appear often in works like this one.\n\nWhat is my heart to you\n\nthat you must break it over and over\n\nlike a plantsman testing\n\nhis new species? Practice\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMaud Muller\n\nby John Greenleaf Whittier\n\n‘Maud Muller’ by John Greenleaf Whittier is a classic narrative ballad that recounts how the poor peasant, Maud, and an urban judge fantasize about getting married and living together. However, neither of them ever takes action, which fills their lives with regret.\n\nThe form and structure of this poem are rather typical of Romantic-era ballads, but this verse is unique in that it is an American pastoral Ballad. While the poets overseas in England were writing stories a lot like Maud's in their poetry, Whittier often put an American spin on his poems, rooting his scenes and images in the common experiences of American commoners.\n\nGod pity them both! and pity us all,\n\nWho vainly the dreams of youth recall.\n\nFor of all sad words of tongue or pen,\n\nThe saddest are these: “It might have been!”\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMedusa\n\nby Louise Bogan\n\n‘Medusa’ by Louise Bogan describes an encounter the speaker has with the eyes of Medusa and the eternal results of that meeting.\n\nWhen the bare eyes were before me\n\nAnd the hissing hair,\n\nHeld up at a window, seen through a door.\n\nThe stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead\n\nFormed in the air.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nMorning Swim\n\nby Maxine Kumin\n\n‘Morning Swim’ by Maxine Kumin is a thoughtful lyric poem that’s written in couplets. The poem engages with themes of God and Nature.\n\nMaxine Kumin is an American poet, known for her clear portrayal of nature and human relationships. Her work deeply explores themes relevant to her American context, capturing a unique blend of personal and communal experiences. This poem is a fine example of her style, integrating elements of the American landscape and personal reflection.\n\nInto my empty head there come\n\na cotton beach, a dock wherefrom\n\nI set out, oily and nude\n\nthrough mist, in chilly solitude.\n\nPDF Guide\n\nOpportunity\n\nby Helen Hunt Jackson\n\n‘Opportunity’ by Helen Hunt Jackson depicts one person’s encounter with a rapturous and divinely-given vision.\n\nJackson was born in 1830 and died five decades later in 1884. She was an extremely religious woman who supported better treatment of Indigenous people living in U.S. territories and states. Her poetry often concerned itself with ruminations on religion and nature.\n\nI do not know if, climbing some steep hill,\n\nThrough fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse I bought,\n\nOr whether in some mid-day I was caught\n\nTo upper air, where visions of God’s will\n\nPDF Guide\n\nOur Martyred Soldiers\n\nby Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\n‘Our Martyred Soldiers’ by Paul Laurence Dunbar is a moving poem that searches for consolation in the wake of the deaths of noble men.\n\nDunbar was an American poet and is remembered for his moving verse and powerful illustrations of life as a person of color in post-Civil War society. Not all his poems or novels deal with the effects of racism, yet poems like this one are clearly reflective of the effects such conflicts had.\n\nIn homes all green, but cold in death,\n\nRobbed of the blessed boon of breath —\n\nResting in peace from field and fray,\n\nOur martyred soldiers sleeping lay."
