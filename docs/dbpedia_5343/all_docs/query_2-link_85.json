And it is FREE to all users! Poems are analyzed for subject content and for similarity and possible connection to other poems in the collection. As a result, PoetryExplorer provides several unique and important uses:\n\nYou have Subject Access to more than 10,000 distinct subject headings that can be searched. (See the Search box directly below.) In the tab Subject Discovery, specific subjects are arranged in general categories so as to facilitate “drill down” searches. For example, enter People on the top level of the search, which opens a list of secondary groups, including Military Figures, which provides poems for over 260 military personages.\n\nRhyme Finder is a rhyming dictionary which locates rhymed lines within poems with full text of the poems provided. This is a useful tool for locating poems with particular rhyming sequences, for discovering unique rhyme usage, and for aiding the construction of new poems.\n\nThere is no doubt that the many people are firmly convinced that they do not care for poetry. They have no use for it, they tell you. Either it bores them, as a fantastic, high-flown method of saying something that, to their way of thinking, could be better said in plain prose, or they look upon it as the sentimental nonsense of the moonstruck, lovesick young; a kind of intellectual “candy.”\n\nRead more…"
