Sweetest l’il feller,

Everybody knows;

Dunno what to call him,

But he mighty lak’ a rose!

Lookin’ at his Mammy

Wid eyes so shiny blue,

Mek’ you think that heav’n

Is comin’ clost-ter you!

W’en he’s a dar a-sleepin’,

In his li’l place,

Think I see de angels

Lookin’ thro’ de lace.

When de dark is fallin’,

When de shadders creep,

Den dey comes on tiptoe

Ter kiss ‘im in his sleep.

Sweetest l’il feller,

Everybody knows;

Dunno what to call him,

But he mighty lak’ a rose!

Lookin’ at his Mammy

Wid eyes so shiny blue,

Mek’ you think that heav’n

Is comin’ clost-ter you!
