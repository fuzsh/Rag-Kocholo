It was a blinding, choking, loyal love, ﬁlled with devotion and dedication. Obvious to all, it was understood only by a few.’ 1 The object of Ricardo Pancho Gonzales’ affection was his tennis racquet. He even took it to bed with him. A Mexican– American from a humble background, he was to have a troubled, passionate relationship with the game. The scar on his cheek gave his Latin looks a dangerous edge; he was no stereotype of the languid, white-clad player. Nor was he alone in falling in love with a game. The placid Dan Maskell, who also came from a working-class family, but was a far different character from the ﬁery Mexican, started as a ball boy, and ‘thus began a love affair with lawn tennis that has never faded’.2 The British pre-war star, Fred Perry, felt the same. Indeed, in no other sport than tennis has the relationship of players and spectators, the game and its followers, been so often discussed in terms of romantic love. Even hard-bitten journalists fell for tennis. A. L. Laney, a sports writer between the wars, entitled his autobiography Covering the Court: A Fifty Year Love Affair with the Game of Tennis, and confessed: ‘I had fallen in love with tennis and this book is the account of that love affair’. He loved the players too. The ﬁrst time he saw the early American star, Little Bill Johnston, he immediately fell in love with him, Y THE TIME I WAS THIRTEEN\n\n2\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\n‘completely and without reservation’. He had previously ‘worshipped from afar’ the Californian, Maurice McLoughlin, a ferocious serve-volleyer who won the United States National tournament in 1912 and 1913, when he also reached the challenge round at Wimbledon. But Laney’s passion for Little Bill was different from his hero worship of McLoughlin. It was love, and ‘once I had fallen, little else seemed to matter so much as seeing him again and seeing him win. Many had this same experience and the younger they were the more they were smitten.’3 And in the twenty-ﬁrst century, it was not uncommon for a manly voice to shout from the stands, ‘I love you Roger,’ when Federer was playing. ‘Love’, the word, is at the centre of tennis. It is embedded in the unique and eccentric tennis scoring system. Love meaning nothing – zero. Playing for love. That it was, uniquely, a sport in which women and men played together made it a ‘love game’ in a social and romantic sense. Yet the feminine element in tennis was always controversial. As was that troublesome ‘love’. It was not a manly word. When a friend introduced the seventies American star, Chrissie Evert, to her future husband, the handsome British player, John ‘Legs’ Lloyd, she was immediately attracted. As he left, he said, ‘Lovely to meet you.’ Chrissie turned in dismay to her friend: ‘Oh no! He’s gay!’4 Such was the association of love with effeminacy, at least in the American mind. The love of which Laney wrote and Gonzales spoke was akin to what the ancient Greeks termed agape: an intense admiration and more: something spiritual and almost religious. Yet the rhythm of tennis was also erotic. The cleanly struck shots that streamed off the racquet, the ball exploding off the court and the body’s leap from gravity and time – these were inspirational. The player pressed with stroke after stroke and built to the ﬁnal unanswerable shot and this was repeated in game after game, climax and anti-climax building ever higher, all leading to the point of no return. For player and spectator alike the game provided no guaranteed orgasmic moment, no certainty of a win. The game\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n3\n\nenacted an unpredictable dialectics of desire – and the spectator’s desire is focused on the player. The tennis star is subjected to intense scrutiny. Tennis matches can last for hours and during them the spectators’ gaze is relentlessly trained on the player’s body, movements and moods, as happens in no other sport, certainly not to the same extent. (The attention paid to footballer David Beckham is the exception rather than the rule.) This is even more the case in the age of the close-up, the replay and the slow-mo. These place the tennis player alongside the ﬁlm star as an icon of glamour and beauty. The erotic body of the player is deployed in a sport discussed in terms of artistry; the performer whose body is her instrument is considered a creative genius. Sports writer Frank Deford questioned whether a sportsperson could be an artist in the full sense of the word. A sporting performance, he thought, might be beautiful, but a great athlete was more like some natural wonder – a ﬂower, a waterfall or a snow-capped mountain. This is clearly wrong. To suggest that an athlete is some kind of natural phenomenon is to ignore the hard work and intense dedication that goes into the development of any outstanding performer. There is nothing ‘natural’ about becoming the best tennis player (or the best dancer) in the world. To an inborn gift of eye-hand coordination the player must bring the capacity to devote herself to endless repetitive practice of the same movement. To that must be added the ‘feel’ outstanding players have for their game. This, it has been suggested, is ‘an afﬁnity for translating thought into action’. Players ‘see’ the visual ﬁeld in a manner differently from those less gifted and this enables them to discern subtle patterns unrecognised by others. Chess masters, artists and athletes have this special awareness. They can break down their ﬁeld of operation into clusters of patterns and, often without conscious thought, translate them into movement. This is a form of creative expression in which the athlete’s body is the instrument. Her split-second movements are those of an artist and may indeed display originality amounting to genius.5\n\n4\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nThere is the further uncertainty whether the performance arts require creative genius in the way that, say, composing music is said to do: whether the cellist Rostropovich – the performer who brings music to life – is a genius on the same level as Beethoven or Shostakovich, who created that music. It is problematic to rate a bodily performance by comparison with a ‘work’ created out of random words or sounds. The performance of a dancer is as ephemeral as that of an athlete. The difference is that dance is, by long tradition, acknowledged as art, supported by music, narrative and mise en scène. The athlete lacks such supports, but, like the dancer, creates through movement. You could even argue that tennis is more creative than dance, since the dancer usually follows choreography designed in advance, whereas the tennis player must always improvise. Tennis appears to be closer to dance than to any other performance form (with the possible exception of ﬁgure skating). The great 1920s champion Bill Tilden excelled at dancing and skating and on court his movement was astonishingly graceful. His ﬂeetfootedness was legendary: the Spanish player Manuel Alonso thought it was like seeing Nijinsky dance across the stage. He perfected the art of taking a little half-step just before he turned, enabling him to make a perfect stroke with perfect spin. Tilden himself certainly believed he was an artist. He quoted his friend, the opera singer Mary Garden, as providing him with the concept of athlete as artist. ‘You’re a tennis artist and artists always know better than anyone else when they’re right. If you believe in a certain way to play, you play that way no matter what anyone else tells you. Once you lose faith in your own artistic judgement, you’re lost. Win or lose, right or wrong, be true to your art.’ 6 Helen Wills Moody, eight times Wimbledon champion, agreed that tennis was ‘in its way an art. Tennis encourages the player to express himself and his personality,’ she wrote. ‘Into his game he puts something of his personality so that his play becomes a unique expression.’ 7\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n5\n\nGianni Clerici, the Italian historian of tennis, endorsed this view: ‘I had always thought of tennis, from the very moment of my childhood when I chose it as my game, as something different. I sensed that there was another way of looking at the sport: as a work of art.’ 8 Tennis, art or not, is unquestionably a sport, if sport is deﬁned as a competitive game involving physical exertion. It is the tension between art and sport that makes it so special, but, unique as it is, tennis has always existed and evolved within the wider culture of sport. Sport has played a central and increasing role in international culture from the mid-nineteenth century onward, until in today’s globalised world it dominates. It offers the panaceas religion was once thought to provide. It combines spectacle and warfare, nationalism and obsession, passion without consequences. Tennis, while seeming to summon just such allegiances and devotions, has never quite ﬁtted into this picture. The Victorian game was invented by sportsmen who were also sports writers, but it was played at garden parties. Its social elaboration does not sit easily with the common idea of sport. In particular, it challenges the sporting ethos. The tennis match may seem at one level like a duel or a ﬁght, but it is also a dance, with its own elaborate courtesies, and its rhythm of pauses, etiquette and protocol; and it takes place within the wider ritual of the tournament, an expansive social environment distinct from the football stadium or boxing ring. In this, it is closer to an opera or music festival than a sport – going to Wimbledon is more like a day at the opera at Glyndebourne than an afternoon of football at the Emirates stadium. Those in charge of tennis have, however, especially since the Second World War, endeavoured to ﬁt it ever more closely into the pattern of other sports. Tennis was, and is, less dangerous than some sports: boxing, say, motor racing, cycling and skiing. Nor is it a contact sport. But the sport’s promoters have increasingly emphasised physical exertion and the pugilistic aspects of the game, rather than elegance and beauty.\n\n6\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nThis has been within a world in which the sporting ethos is so dominant and so little challenged that the attempt to locate tennis at least partly outside it may seem eccentric or downright perverse, but this is necessary if the eccentricity and richness of the game itself is to be fully understood. The contemporary conventional sporting perspective is itself a kind of tunnel vision; a more expansive, cultural viewpoint may provide a better appreciation of the ‘game of love’. To approach tennis with ‘love’ may be dangerous if, as Oscar Wilde wrote, ‘each man kills the thing he loves’ – whether because that love is too obsessive or too critical. Many critics, as we shall see, believed that ‘love’ in tennis was dangerous – that the very fact of this word being used in the scoring system rendered it unmanly. But love is also a hopeful word, a word of celebration; and in the end, the point of writing about tennis is to celebrate the beauty, the glamour and the joy of this unique game.\n\n2 Healthy excitement and scientiﬁc play\n\nI\n\nCourt Journal reported news of a new game, likely to replace the croquet of which everyone had tired. ‘Sphairistike or lawn tennis’ was just the thing for those in search of ‘novelty’, and, continued the report, ‘it has been tested at several country houses, and has been found full of healthy excitement, besides being capable of much scientiﬁc play’. The game was for sale as a box set, ‘not much larger than a double gun case’ and ‘contained bats and balls and a portable court’. Thus was the birth of lawn tennis announced to a public ready to fall for the charms of a game that, from its birth combined thrills, social cachet and commercial possibilities. A conﬁdent upper class and an expanding bourgeoisie with money and leisure to spare were refashioning social, cultural and educational life in the 1870s. Britain had just passed the apex of its industrial if not imperial power, but was still the wealthiest country in the world. The stiﬂing grip of the evangelical Victorian Sunday was weakening. Aspiring urban artisans and white-collar workers were beginning to have a little leisure and a little money to spend. Various publics from different social groups and classes demanded new forms of entertainment to replace the old rural folk traditions – or in some cases to reconstruct them along N MARCH 1874 THE LONDON\n\n10\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nmodern lines. Sport, whether played or watched, was one among a number of pleasurable entertainments offered to the growing town-dwelling public. Venues new and old, such as the Lyceum and the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, not to mention the music halls and eventually the cinemas, brought all sorts of novel shows and spectacles to this public, ranging from spiritualist séances to the conjuring tricks of Maskelyne and Devant. Lawn tennis seemed designed, as was hinted by the words ‘country houses’, for an elegant and exclusive section of society. It quickly became fashionable and it provided an alluring social occasion. It was the new version of an ancient game, a game so old that no one knew how it got its name of ‘tennis’. Popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it had lost favour by the eighteenth century, but with the growth and reorganisation of sports in the Victorian period was revived in a form distinct enough to be classed as new. It was at ﬁrst viewed as a pastime or craze rather than a sport, displacing other games played on social occasions rather than as competitive events. Croquet, for example, provided an opportunity for upperand upper-middle-class society to get a little open-air exercise in an environment in which men and women mingled. But, as Lieutenant Colonel Osborn, an early devotee of tennis, wrote in 1881, croquet had become ‘a tyranny’, because it vested all power in the captain of each team, his ‘subordinates’ having ‘no volition of their own … compelled to [play] exclusively to suit [his] convenience’. By the 1870s an open-air version of badminton, originally introduced from India, was replacing croquet, but the shuttlecock proved uncontrollable in even the slightest breeze. Another craze was ‘rinking’ – roller skating on indoor asphalt courts to the accompaniment of band music. This, Colonel Osborn said, was boring and monotonous and often led to falls and injuries. Yet for a while people were ‘quite demented’ with it. Histories of sport have usually classiﬁed lawn tennis retrospectively as yet another new sport of the later Victorian period. To link it, as Osborn did, with these other ‘crazes’ places it more\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n11\n\naccurately as a hybrid that bridged the sporting culture then developing and the burgeoning world of entertainment in the rapidly expanding cities. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially in France, theatrical performances had often been held on tennis courts, and there is a connection between tennis and theatre too often unrecognised.1 Osborn felt that lawn tennis, unlike croquet and rinking, was likely to endure. It was more versatile and more exciting. Above all, it provided an idyllic social occasion: The scene should be laid on a well kept garden lawn. There should be a bright warm sun overhead … Near at hand, under the cool shadow of a tree, there should be strawberries and cream, iced claret mug, and a few spectators, who do not want to play but are lovers of the game …2\n\nLawn tennis was never to equal the popularity of cricket and football. Yet it represents more accurately than any other spectacle the hugely signiﬁcant changes in society at the moment of its birth. Tennis was perfectly ﬁtted to captivate the increasingly secular world of the late nineteenth century. Not least, lawn tennis differed from the other sports so rapidly developing in that period because, uniquely, men and women shared the pitch, playing in partnerships usually of two on each side of the net. It arose as the suffrage movement, underway since the 1850s, was widening its demands to include education as well as the vote and property rights, and generally a greater public role and a widening of opportunities for women. The playing of sport was to the fore as girls’ schools and university colleges were founded. Advances in medical science were leading to a changed view of the importance of exercise for bodily (and indeed spiritual) health for women as well as men; dress reform societies waged war against restrictive female fashions. There was a corresponding relaxation in the irksome taboos restricting social intercourse between men and women. Chaperones and corsets were still the order of the day, but the very\n\n12\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\ngrowth of a consumer society dedicated to commercial entertainment acted to dissolve ancient prejudices that were often embedded in religious dogma. Tennis was destined to ﬂourish in the novel space of the suburban garden lawn, which was a ‘tamed’ version of the countryside just as the new sporting culture was a tamed version of previously rough and unregulated activities. In the 1860s Major T. H. Gem and Mr J. B. Perera had marked out an Edgbaston lawn as a tennis court and in 1872 the ﬁrst lawn tennis club was founded at nearby Leamington Manor House Hotel. These developments anticipated ‘sphairistike’ (the classical Greek name was soon abandoned) and its patenter, Major Copton Wingﬁeld. Descended from an ancient landed family that had fallen into decline and relative poverty, Wingﬁeld hoped the boxed lawn tennis set would revive his fortunes and used his aristocratic connections to publicise it in society magazines such as the Court Journal and Vanity Fair. The Field, bible of the English gentleman at home and abroad, became interested and within a few months lawn tennis was launched as the latest fashionable craze. Wingﬁeld’s claim to be the inventor of lawn tennis, calling his boxed set ‘The Major’s Game of Tennis’, likewise his tale of its invention at a country house party in Wales in December 1873, lending it social cachet, were more than a little shaky. Nor did he ever beneﬁt ﬁnancially from his initiative as he seems to have hoped. Assailed with family problems – the early deaths of his three sons and the chronic mental illness of his wife – he did not renew his patent. Nevertheless, it is signiﬁcant that it was a commercial venture, and so anticipated the marketing of tennis, as of all sports. In 1868 the All England Croquet Club had been founded at the ofﬁces of The Field magazine. J. H. Walsh, editor of The Field and Henry Jones, a regular contributor, were journalists as well as sportsmen ( Jones was also a doctor), and sports journalism from the beginning shaped the public perception of lawn tennis – and indeed, ampliﬁed the importance and popularity of all sports.\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n13\n\nHarry Gem, one of the founders of the modern game, made this sketch of the ﬁrst game played in Leamington Spa\n\nWalsh and Jones found a site for their club the following year at Wimbledon. By that time croquet was rapidly losing its popularity and in a letter that appeared in the same issue of The Field that ﬁrst publicised Major Wingﬁeld’s new game, J. Hinde Hale, a committee member of the club, suggested that lawn tennis might be the thing to replace croquet on its ‘now deserted grounds’.3 So rapid was the advance of lawn tennis that in 1877 the All England Club staged its ﬁrst tournament there. By this time a new set of rules had been established. The MCC (the Marylebone Cricket Club), as the most important ofﬁcial body overseeing any sport, had been asked to reconcile the differences in the rules between the game played by Gem and Perera and that of Wingﬁeld. A sub-committee opted for the rectangular court, rather than the hourglass-shaped one of Wingﬁeld’s game, and, even more signiﬁcantly – and against the recommendations of the MCC – adopted the traditional tennis system of scoring rather than the cumulative method used in the game of rackets (and most other sports). So, within a decade, ﬁrst the MCC and then, decisively, the All England Croquet Club, had taken control of the game.\n\n14\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nIn its early years military men and more unexpectedly the clergy were among the keenest promoters and players of the game. Perhaps this only shows how central these professions then were within the upper-middle classes, as compared to their marginal or niche status in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Colonel Osborn concluded his eulogy on tennis with the statement that, ‘if all these conditions are present, an afternoon spent at lawn tennis is a highly Christian and beneﬁcent pastime’. It ‘produces a feeling of benevolence towards the human race generally. It causes its votaries to regard the world and all that it contains with that charity that hides a multitude of sins’ (surely a rather ambiguous remark). He speculated that this was why it was ‘so extensively patronised by the clergy’. Perhaps it was partly because their vicarage lawns were ideally suited to the game, but also because ‘lawn tennis on a Sunday afternoon is very superior to sermons’. Tennis was by no means conﬁned to the vicarage, however. It was associated with secular aesthetes when the new ‘aesthetic’ suburb of Bedford Park in West London was completed in the late 1870s, attracting afﬂuent residents of artistic bent, patrons of the Aesthetic Movement. This movement was organised round the Grosvenor Galleries in central London. Its adherents promoted the idea of beauty in all things. Many had radical social leanings, but their effete posing was subjected to merciless caricature. That Oscar Wilde was a fervent adherent was later fatally to stigmatise their philosophy. A tennis club was quickly established in Bedford Park and, shockingly, its members played tennis on Sundays, behaviour that aroused immense local disapproval. There were petitions and irate letters to the Acton, Chiswick and Turnham Green Gazette, whose editorial on 28 May 1880 stated: ‘If lawn tennis on Sundays is right at the Bedford Park Club, may it not be claimed that billiards, bagatelle, bowls and even skittles would be proper at the surrounding public houses … That is the legitimate outcome of such reasoning and surely every Englishman would deprecate such an inﬂux of Sunday amusements.’ In other words, the sight\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n15\n\nof their social betters larking about on a tennis court on the Sabbath was sure to incite the lower orders to rowdy, dissolute and ungodly behaviour.4 Certainly the presence of alcohol, women vigorously disporting themselves and cautious ﬂirtation ﬂouted traditional Victorian moral ideals. Yet tennis-loving vicars played a most progressive role in promoting tennis for women. The ﬁrst woman Wimbledon champion, Maud Watson, remembered that her father, a broadminded vicar, had allowed her and her sisters to play in a match at Hurlingham club: ‘People thought it was scandalous that he should let us play in public! We enjoyed it though!’5 The father of the seven-times Wimbledon ladies champion, Dorothea Lambert Chambers, was another vicar who encouraged his daughter to excel at the game. ‘Wimbledon’ soon became a well-attended social ﬁxture, attracting large crowds to watch the ﬁrst real stars of the game, the Renshaw brothers. This was a tournament reserved for amateur (male) players, entering as individuals, not in a team, nor, as in so many other sports, as representatives of a school, county, community or nation. As singles play gained over doubles, individualism was further cemented into the sport. At the same time the championships announced themselves as a social event in the London ‘season’, thus maintaining the society associations that set the game apart. Just as each player represented only himself, so the spectators were taking part in a different kind of spectacle, quite unlike cricket or football matches, where group loyalties were to the fore. The fashionable Wimbledon crowd came to see individual players, just as they would attend the theatre to see an opera or music-hall singer, a star who attracted allegiance entirely by virtue of their style of play and expertise and, increasingly, by their force of personality. It was true that the most famous sportsman of the late Victorian period, Dr W. G. Grace, the cricketer, appealed to his fans by virtue of his personality and his play, but cricket – as, for that matter, football – was far more closely connected to local\n\n16\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nand national loyalties than was the case with tennis. In the meantime, tennis was rapidly developing a distinctive style of play. In the early years of the Wimbledon championships most entrants were essentially players of the ancient game of real tennis, bringing to the lawns their slow ground strokes, played with massive ‘cut’ or slice. The ﬁrst champion, Spencer W. Gore, believed that the new game lacked variety and was too monotonous to last. He overcame this and outwitted his opponents by inventing the volley, but the next year he in turn was defeated by Frank Hadow, who discovered that the lob could defeat the volleyer. It was Hadow, too, who abandoned the underspun strokes of the real tennis players in favour of the ﬂat, fast and hard stroke. The return of the safety-ﬁrst, monotonous ground-stroke game played by Hadow lasted only until the arrival of William and Ernest Renshaw. They took the sport seriously, analysing their own game and that of other players in continual efforts to improve. They even set out courts in the South of France where they could practise all year round. Their development of the over-arm serve and the smash startled and enraptured spectators and enraged opponents. William Renshaw, the better player of the two, dominated the sport for most of the1880s and set it on its path to international popularity. Lawn tennis clubs proliferated, but by the early 1890s the rapid rise of the game had tailed off. Now the latest craze was the bicycle, which offered more adventurous ways for girls to meet boys. In 1895 the Wimbledon championships made a loss of £33, then a serious sum of money. The departure of the Renshaw brothers had left a void and it was not until the arrival of a new set of brothers, Reggie and Laurie Doherty, that the game regained its popularity, demonstrating how particularly important individual personalities were to this sport.6 With the waning of its popularity in fashionable circles, lawn tennis was saved by two developments. It became popular in the new suburbs and it spread like wildﬁre internationally. Women\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n17\n\nwere increasingly interested in the game and beginning to play it seriously. This met with opposition from those who (unlike Maud Watson’s father) felt that while it might be permissible for women and girls to play in the privacy of the country house park or the suburban vicarage garden, it was indecent for them to play in public. The Irish nevertheless introduced a women’s event in Dublin in 1879 and in 1884 Wimbledon followed suit. There, at the age of nineteen, Maud Watson defeated her sister to win the inaugural championship. Tennis did not remain for long exclusive to Britain. The circumstances favouring its success were also present in France, and indeed across Europe and in the United States and Australia. France was in the grip of Anglomania at the end of the nineteenth century and the new game was soon being played all over the country, but especially on the Riviera. The wealth of French landed estates was dwindling by the beginning of the twentieth century; industrialists, businessmen and members of the professions beneﬁted from a new spirit of enterprise and the belle époque saw republicanism ﬁnally ﬁrmly established, together with an economic upturn and a cultural ﬂowering. Tennis was associated with exclusive clubs and precisely expressed the aspirations of the bourgeoisie. Leon de Janzé reported that only 300 of the 800 members of the Société Sportive de l’Ile de Puteau, one of the chicest Paris clubs at the turn of the century, actually played tennis. Many attended purely for the social life, for tea, dinner and dancing.7 Tennis player Coco Gentien described women playing in huge hats. Their skirts swept the ground, only occasionally allowing a glimpse of a foot shod in a white leather shoe with a heel.8 Everyone was becoming more athletic. ‘The members of polite society,’ wrote one French journalist, ‘are all turning into athletes, those, that is, who play lawn tennis. It is just being recognised that the latter is a sport. Until now it was held to be an innocent pastime for anaemic men and pale young ladies … as\n\n18\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\neasy-going as lotto or whist.’ Not any longer. ‘Rigour, skill and stamina’ were now essential. The game was brought to the United States when a Miss Mary Outerbridge saw it played in Bermuda and brought a boxed set home with her. The ﬁrst game of tennis in America was probably played on a court that her brother, A. Emilius Outerbridge, helped her lay out on the lawns of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club. Harry Stevens, whose mother, Mrs Paran Stevens, was a dedicated social climber and who was himself courting the writer, Edith Wharton, at the time, also brought tennis equipment from England, where he’d been studying. He had a court laid out in Newport on the lawn of his mother’s mansion on Bellevue Avenue. The game spread rapidly. In Boston James Dwight and his cousin Frederick Sears Jr set up the ﬁrst court in the Boston area at the resort of Nahant. J Arthur Beebe, son-in-law of a prominent Nahant ‘resorter’, William Appleton, had brought back a Wingﬁeld set from London and the court was laid out on the Appletons’ lawn. 1876 saw the ﬁrst tournament played there, but at this point the squash and rackets scoring system was used. Tennis started in Philadelphia in a similar way, that is, among private families. At this time, as in England, there were wide differences in equipment and rules. After one tournament in which this became clearly problematic, Dwight, Sears and Clarence Clark, who had pioneered the game in Philadelphia, agreed that some sort of regulation was needed. In 1881 a convention in New York saw the founding of the US National Lawn Tennis Association and the meeting also agreed that the ﬁrst ofﬁcial championships (men’s) would be held in August at the newly built Newport Casino. Newport thus became the ﬁrst fashionable centre of the game.9 As in England, the game was at ﬁrst restricted to the Social Register and the WASPs of the eastern seaboard, but gradually tennis spread across the continent and California pioneered more\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n19\n\ndemocratic participation. Maurice McCloughlin learned his tennis on the public courts at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and was the ﬁrst tennis player from ‘the other side of the tracks’ to become national US champion. Lawn tennis became popular in the Antipodes, and there too it was ﬁrst played by the colonial aristocracy. Such was the success of their new players that in 1907 the Australian Norman Brookes won the singles, the mixed doubles and, with Anthony Wilding from New Zealand, the men’s doubles at Wimbledon. In 1908 the pair defeated the United States in the recently inaugurated Davis Cup. The Davis Cup was the brainchild of the American, Dwight Davis. Anthony Wilding believed that this event, played by teams of players from different nations in both singles and doubles, had ‘done more to advance lawn tennis as a popular pastime and to raise it to its present high standard than any other agency’. The Australasian win (played in Australia) had, he believed, put paid to the idea that ‘lawn tennis was a mild pastime requiring a little skill but none of the athletic qualities essential in cricket’. The beaten American pair, Beals Wright and R. B. Alexander, played in a number of Australian tournaments and ‘the bare fact that men of such attractive personality were connected with lawn tennis did much to advance the game in popular favour’.10 The Davis Cup was intended to develop tennis as a team game and enhance its appeal by invoking nationalism, but even here it was the individual personalities that attracted spectators to the game. Yet while it popularised the game, its social exclusivity remained, and into the twenty-ﬁrst century membership of a tennis club was often more than a matter of the fee, but also involved being recommended and knowing the ‘right people’.\n\n3 Real tennis and the scoring system\n\nT\n\nlawn tennis was adapted had been played at least since the early Middle Ages. Its roots lay in spectacle. The origins of ball games are ‘shrouded in mystery’ according to the German historian, Heiner Gillmeister, who believes they emerged out of the ceremonies that took place at weddings, when a show was put on that would be memorable to all those present. At aristocratic nuptials these would be courtly tournaments and jousts. The tournament was a stylised version of armed combat, a festive version of or preamble to it, at which knights displayed their skills before an audience that included the ladies of the court. Echoes of this still linger at the modern Spanish bullﬁght. Gillmeister speculates that these tournaments originally took place in front of the castle portcullis, a grid that became in tennis a grille at one end of the court. This would also explain the tennis term ‘dedans’ or ‘within’, the passage of arms being between those outside and those within the fortiﬁcation.1 At a more humble level tennis may have developed out of the manic and often violent football of the common people, the difference being that the ball was hit with the hand, not the foot, hence its early name, jeu de paume, game of the palm. It appears to have originated in France or the Netherlands, but a similar HE ANCIENT GAME FROM WHICH\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n21\n\ngame was recorded around the same period in many parts of Europe and even in the Mayan civilisation in Latin America. As it developed in Europe, the ball came to be hit with a gloved rather than a bare hand and ﬁnally, by the sixteenth century, the gloved hand had been replaced by a racquet. The terms ‘real tennis’ and ‘royal tennis’ (in the USA ‘court tennis’) were only adopted in the 1870s to distinguish the traditional game from the newfangled ‘lawn’ version. ‘Real’ was conﬂated or confused with ‘royal’ and this term seems to have been based on the fallacy that originally only kings and princes played the game. Henry VIII certainly did play tennis and was indeed fanatically devoted to the game. It was widely played in the courts of Europe and the famous ‘tennis court oath’ that kickstarted the French Revolution in 1789 took place in the tennis court at Versailles. Such evidence as exists suggests that the game was more widely played by plebeian citizens than later generations realised. An early version of the jeu de paume probably evolved from other team games and was played in the street. It was also popular with monks. They were forbidden to participate in the rough football of the times, but a ball game where the ball was hit with the hand was more suited to the conﬁnes of the cloister. It is therefore plausible to suggest that the real tennis court developed from the medieval monastic cloister with its gothic arches and slanting roof and gallery onto which the ball must ﬁrst be served, a design maintained to this day in real tennis, but one of the many complications abandoned by the Victorian military men who developed the modern game. Gillmeister cites a court case in the city of Exeter in the southwest of England that relates to a dispute about the game. In 1447 the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral attempted to close the cathedral cloisters and adjacent open area on account of the noise and damage caused by young people of the town playing tennis there, especially during religious services. Gillmeister also mentions examples of it being played in the street and by larger\n\n22\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nteams. Gambling was closely associated with tennis, as with all sports. An alternative theory has it developing in the streets of northern Italian towns at the same period. Medieval shop fronts often had a sloping roof to protect the goods laid out below and the style developed of hitting the ball up onto the roof, known as a ‘pentys’ (later, penthouse) to begin the point.2 Whatever its origins, tennis became something of a craze during the Renaissance, when the ﬁrst professional players – women as well as men – appeared. In France their incorporation into the Communauté des Maitres Paumiers-Racuertiers elevated the status of tennis ‘from a mere game to an art, like horsemanship or fencing’, argues one of today’s real tennis players.3 The ancient game featured regularly in the literature and art of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Tennis seems to have been more frequently illustrated and written about than the other games, such as cricket and football, that were played in these early times, partly, perhaps, because of its special association with court life and the aristocracy. The many images of tennis from the thirteenth century onwards assisted Gillmeister in tracing the development of the game, for example, when the racquet began to be regularly used, the height and arrangement of the net and even styles of play. He shows its particular hold on the artistic imagination and how it had a special relationship to courtly literature and to a conception of the ideal human being. It appeared as a recommended part of a young man’s education, contributing to a ‘civilising process’, teaching good manners and appropriate behaviour, as well as providing a suitable form of bodily exercise, so long as it was not taken to excess – although Charles V dismissed it as one of the games that did ‘nothing to teach the manly art of bearing arms’. Its appearance in the medieval romance literature added to its glamour and eroticism, for it was associated, long before the Victorian garden party, with dalliance as well as sporting vigour and courage in combat. It was also considered an intellectual\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n23\n\ngame and known as ‘chess in motion’, so it is easy ‘to see why such a game should so have fascinated the intellectuals of the Middle Ages – who were the monks’.4 Indeed, one writer thought ‘the art of the racquet the most appropriate sport for the man of letters’.5 The most unusual aspect of the sport was its peculiar scoring system. This, as we saw earlier, was retained for lawn tennis against the advice of the MCC and like much else about the jeu de paume its origins are mysterious. In the ﬁrst place, tennis was and is unlike most sports in that a game has no ﬁxed duration. There is no such thing as a ‘draw’; the game has to continue until one player (or pair) is victorious. As Clerici wrote: ‘Its method of scoring had no limits and, theoretically at least, could last for days on end and not even come to an end then.’ (In 2010 a match at Wimbledon between the Frenchman Nicolas Mahut and American John Isner did continue over three days and more than eleven hours, ending when Isner prevailed 70-68 in the ﬁnal set.) The scoring of most sports is cumulative – the side or individual with most points wins. In some sports one additional point or goal is sufﬁcient; in others, table tennis, for example, the winner must gain a margin of at least two. None of this applies to tennis. It bears some resemblance to snooker in that the match is divided into smaller sections, in snooker known as ‘frames’, and in tennis as ‘sets’. A set like a match is equally of indeterminate duration. The ﬁrst player to reach six games wins the set, but must win by a margin of two games. A score of 6–5 is therefore not a winning margin; the set will then have to go to at least 7–5. There are further subdivisions within each game. A game is scored not by simple addition, but by an elaborate system using arcane language. Both players start at zero, which is called ‘love’. The game then progresses to ﬁfteen – thirty – forty. If both players reach forty, this then becomes ‘deuce’ (à deux in French, although today the usual French term is égalité). Once deuce is reached a\n\n24\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nplayer must win two more consecutive points to win the game. Critics have argued that this system is ‘unfair’ because it is possible for a player to win a match having won fewer points than his opponent. (One such critic was Charles Lenglen, father of Suzanne Lenglen, the 1920s tennis star.) It has also been criticised for being too bafﬂingly elaborate. It was at ﬁrst considered beyond the intelligence of a woman to grasp it. Why the sub-committee of the MCC chose the ‘real tennis’ system against the wishes of the committee is not recorded. The serendipitous result, however, was that, together with the indeterminate length of a match, it creates a game and a spectacle that is more dramatic and that contains more possibility of changes of fortune than almost any other sport. The system permits mini-crises at crucial points in the course of a match and the enhanced possibility of dramatic reversals. Of course, a sudden change in fortune is possible in most sports, but there is no other that sees ebbs and ﬂows on the same scale. For example, with three minutes left to play, it is unlikely that a football team leading by a margin of three goals will lose the match. The outcome is clear before the end of play. Even if the losing team scores, say, two more goals, that does not nullify the lead. In tennis, by contrast, a lead can be nulliﬁed: when a one-set lead becomes set all, for example; or within a single game when break points (15–40) disappear and the score moves back to deuce. The Indian player, Vijay Amritraj, argued that the beauty of the system was that in tennis you can craft a victory from almost certain defeat. Describing a match in which he was match point down against one of the greatest of all players, Rod Laver (the score was 6–7, 5–6, 0–40), he wrote: ‘In tennis you can take it by stages. Every game won is a staging post back from the desert: one more step back towards the oasis where you can look your opponent in the eye again on something like level terms. I saved the three match points and just kept playing point by point – the old cliché that is the best one in the book. Point by point and\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n25\n\nsomehow I won seven straight games for victory.’ 6 This was also what happened in one of the most famous matches at the beginning of the open era, in 1969. The match was between the ageing Gonzales and the Puerto Rican Charlie Pasarell, who played for the US. Gonzales had turned pro too young to achieve what he might have done as an amateur and was now forty-one years old, but still a formidable and, some felt, terrifying player. Pasarell had been brieﬂy America’s number one ranked player, but had never gone beyond the quarter ﬁnals at any major tournament. On the other hand, for the previous two years at Wimbledon he had brought drama to the Centre Court in incredible ﬁve-set matches. This third year surpassed even those. The ﬁrst set alone went to 11–9 in Pasarell’s favour. The light was fading and rain began to fall, but the referee, Captain Mike Gibson, refused to halt the match before the end of the second set, which Gonzales lost 1–6. When play resumed the next day he was thus already in an apparently losing position, needing to win the three remaining sets. He ground out the third set, winning it by 16–14 when Pasarell double faulted twice in one game; and then won the fourth set more easily, 6–3. But in the ﬁfth set the moment came when he was at 4–5 and 0–40 down. That meant three match points for Pasarell. After seven deuces Gonzales won that game to reach 5–all. The situation was repeated at 5–6. Pasarell reached match point, for the third time, now on his own serve, at 8–7, but he lobbed, the ball landed out and that was the end of Pasarell, who lost the next eleven points. Gonzales won the match 11–9 in the ﬁnal set.7 The nail-biting tension and hysterical excitement of such a match can never be recaptured in print, but it illustrates the superior dramatic potential of tennis. The indeterminate length of the game heightens the tension and allows for several changes in momentum over the course of a match. The scoring system requires an additional skill from the player, because in tennis not all points are equal. The best players will vary the intensity of\n\n26\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nplay according to the importance of the moment, will know how to up the tempo when needed, will judge when to play safe and when to go for broke. As in opera, the building of momentum results in crescendo – lull – crescendo – climax, an experience for both player and spectator that is not quite like the experience of watching other sports. There have been many suggestions as to the origins of ‘tennis’, ‘love’ and the system based on multiples of three. In the 1920s A. E. Crawley suggested that love, ﬁfteen, thirty, forty, deuce, advantage related to the clock, divided into four quarters (with 45 reduced to 40), by which the monks kept the score. This, though, is speculative and no one really knows. Gillmeister dismissed virtually all these theories. The word ‘tennis’ itself may have come from the French ‘tenez’, spoken as the server prepared to play. The term ‘love’ is also mysterious, although possibly it had something to do with the universal practice in earlier times of betting on matches (‘for love or money’). That one word has caused more controversy than any other aspect of the game, but these linguistic mysteries only add to the romance of tennis. In spite of recurring grumbles about the scoring system, the only serious change to have taken place was the introduction of the tie-break, ﬁrst used at the US Open in 1970. This was a modiﬁcation of the rule whereby a set could only be won when one player went two games ahead. Although the ﬁnal set 70–68 score in the 2010 Wimbledon match between Mahut and Isner was unique, before the introduction of the tie-break, sets did fairly often go beyond the 6–all point at which the tie-break is now introduced. While lengthy matches might be exciting, they could also be monotonous, as well as exhausting for the players. The tie-break broke the stalemate that could occur. The ﬁrst player to reach seven points wins the set, but still has to win by a margin of two points. The tie-break was invented by Jimmy Van Alen, who presided over the Newport Casino and Tennis Club, Rhode Island, where\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n27\n\nthe very ﬁrst tournaments in America were played and where he also founded the Tennis Hall of Fame, opened in 1954. Van Alen was one of the upper-class amateurs who directed the sport in the amateur era. Amritraj described him as ‘a New England aristocrat who still dressed like his ancestors must have done at garden parties at the turn of the century’. But in introducing the tie-break he was an unlikely innovator. He had wanted to go further and abolish the two-point-lead rule and have a single ninepoint tie-breaker, but the more conservative form prevailed and soon became universal. The only tournaments to retain a no-tiebreak ﬁnal set were the three major tournaments, Wimbledon, Australia and France (the US Open does have a tie-break ﬁnal set). The Pasarell–Gonzales match illustrated the lengths to which a match could go. Even in an era in which rallies were much shorter, it lasted over three hours. Then and recently, when matches have become longer, the tie-break was popular and produced its own additional twist of excitement. The poetic tennis scoring system was more than a nostalgic gesture to its medieval origins; it did perhaps symbolise its courtly and monastic past. More importantly it recreated in the modern game its aesthetic possibilities and creativity. It was – and is – also intensely contemporary – indeed postmodern – in its eclectic elaboration and a reminder of the wonderful eccentricity of the game and indeed of so many of its players, at least in its early years. It remained a powerful exception to the tendencies towards uniformity that were increasingly to encroach on the game in the late twentieth century.\n\n4 The growth of a sporting culture\n\nI\n\nlandowners and the gentry had happily played cricket, organised ﬁghts and gone hare-coursing in company with agricultural workers and artisans. There was no social threat from their subordinates. Britain was relatively stable politically and was becoming more democratic. Sports, even if unruly, suggest Norbert Elias and Eric Dunning,1 represented a ‘civilised’ advance in that their contests symbolised the resolution of conﬂict by means of rules and conventions that all respected, rather than by violence. As Britain became an urban industrial society, there was a dramatic increase in playing and watching or following sport. Certain traditional sports, especially the more bloodthirsty ones, such as cock ﬁghting and bear baiting, went into decline, in some cases actively suppressed, while others, such as bowls and hockey, developed a higher proﬁle. The ancient sports of cricket and football continued, but in less anarchic, more regulated forms. Meanwhile new sports entered the arena. Many reasons have been suggested for the explosion in organised sports.2 There were economic reasons, from gambling (though this was much disapproved of and many attempts were made to suppress it) to the production and marketing of N EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY RURAL ENGLAND,\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n29\n\nequipment and accessories and the organisation of commercial matches and other events. For some sportsmen it was the entry into better paid employment, although few sportsmen became wealthy. The growth of sports also fed into the growing newspaper industry, where popular journalism and its reporting of sports events in turn ampliﬁed their popularity. An important factor was economic and industrial advance in itself. This led to the development of new technologies that were swiftly applied to sports, some of which changed beyond recognition. The mere availability of this new technology, however, does not explain why it was applied so eagerly to so many sports. Nor does it explain why sports and related activities were so popular, nor why they acquired virtues not previously attributed to them. Some have suggested that sports were a form of social control, an opium of the people, distracting them from political struggle, but others claim that sports provided needed respite from lives of toil. Physical exercise was healthy, and health was increasingly a preoccupation with advances in medical knowledge and fears about the noxious environment of industrial cities. Many looked to sports to create workers ﬁt for the factories and ﬁelds or, if necessary, for war. Aside from these functional explanations were others that emphasised the psychological and even spiritual beneﬁts of sport. On an individual level they might provide a kind of catharsis, that is, a form of excitement ending in emotional resolution. They were held to promote community solidarity. Organised team sports in particular fostered local, community and national pride, the latter of growing importance as other nations, especially Germany and the United States, began to challenge Britain’s economic and imperial pre-eminence. More mundanely, the slowly diminishing working day resulted in more leisure time and workers craved pleasure and excitement to ﬁll it. This, the simplest explanation, that sports provided pure pleasure and excitement, again at a premium in the lives of working men, may be the most convincing of all. Taking\n\n30\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\npart in sports was enjoyable; so was being part of the crowd at a match, a race or a tournament. It was fun. Before the seventeenth century ordinary women had taken part in sports, including hunting, alongside men, as well as having sports of their own, such as skipping and racing; there were even women pugilists. They also joined the crowds that gathered at contests as onlookers. The Puritans, disliking all forms of playful activity, were particularly down on female participation. As Dennis Brailsford points out, play lost its openness and innocence and, like sex, ‘moved uncertainly into a hinterland between the claims of purity and the frequent actuality of prurience in its male promoters and spectators’; 3 in other words, the puritanical wish to remove women from display had the opposite effect from that intended. By the nineteenth century women had largely withdrawn as the doctrine of women’s place being in the home took hold. Upper-class women rode to hounds and practised archery, but vigorous exercise for leisured women, even walking, developed seriously only in the second half of the nineteenth century. As education for women including healthy exercise developed, middle-class women became more active and at the end of the century took to the bicycle (an expensive piece of equipment) with alacrity, but poorer women remained excluded and in spite of girls playing hockey, tennis and golf, which caused mockery in the pages of Punch and other periodicals, sport remained a predominantly masculine activity. As such it developed a new and uplifting ideology, a form of justiﬁcation that removed it from the sphere of play. For the word ‘sport’ had in earlier times been used to refer to erotic dalliance. In the seventeenth century it had even been considered devilish, not because ‘of a general disapproval of pleasure, but more speciﬁcally because sport suggested idle, proﬁtless and fundamentally unserious action’.4 Pleasure remained an awkward concept for the high-minded Victorians. From the start of the nineteenth century an increasingly\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n31\n\ninﬂuential Evangelical movement had sought to reform manners and morals. For example, the Society for the Suppression of Vice was waging a war against pornography as early as 1802. To the most committed Evangelicals, almost all pleasurable activities and spectacles were sinful: cards, blood sports, novel reading, dancing, drink and, perhaps above all, the theatre. Even tea and coffee were viewed with suspicion. The bosom of the family was the only safe place to be; and through their emphasis on a particular form of family life they were at least partly responsible for the belief in ‘the natural differences and complementary roles of men and women’ taking hold throughout middle-class society. 5 Evangelical Christianity was not universally accepted and ran counter to other trends in British society, but for several decades the movement was able to wage successful war against pleasure. Sunday observance cast a pall. There were even attempts to close the London parks on the Sabbath. The All England Club did not have Sunday play until 1889 – and to this day a relic of Sunday observance results in no play on the ‘middle Sunday’ of Wimbledon (and indeed play on the ﬁnal Sunday was only introduced in 1982). Yet sport was able to develop and expand, even in this stiﬂing moral climate, because virtues were claimed for it. Key to the promotion of sport were the public (that is private) schools that educated the sons of various elite groups. The conﬁdent and rising middle class did not, as in France, evict a decadent aristocracy. Instead, the aristocracy was assimilated and an important agent in this was the public school. In Georgian England there already existed a porous ‘genteel’ class including the lesser landed gentry, merchants, clerics, business and professional men; the term ‘gentleman’ developed as an inclusive one to cover subtle variations in status. The nineteenthcentury boys’ boarding school strengthened and institutionalised the ideal of the ‘gentleman’ and, signiﬁcantly, cemented it with the elevation of sporting activity to a moral principle. Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to\n\n32\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\n1841, was a key ﬁgure in the development of the public school ethos. He was a passionate Christian and dedicated to imprinting Christian spiritual and moral ideals on his pupils. One of these, Thomas Hughes, was deeply inﬂuenced by Arnold and idealised his beliefs in the bestselling novel, Tom Brown’s Schooldays. Arnold himself had never shown the slightest interest in sport, but Hughes made the educational, spiritual and moral value of sport central to his book. His friend, the Christian socialist, Charles Kingsley, developed similar ideas in his novels Westward Ho! and Alton Locke. A journalist coined the term ‘muscular Christianity’ to describe the new importance these writers ascribed to sport and the moral and religious connotations it had suddenly acquired; muscular Christianity became effectively the label for an ideology or a new vision of the virtuous life: an exclusively masculine one. The ideal expressed the view that a healthy mind and soul should be housed in a healthy body. Sports, especially rugby and cricket, were invaluable. They fostered comradely spirit as well as physical ﬁtness and courage, and they preserved the ‘boyishness’ of the youth in the man. This was the essential ideal for the builders of the Empire, which the British liked to believe was a moral and civilising crusade. Games and sport rather than ‘education and bookishness’ were now considered the appropriate means of developing manly men ﬁt both to protect the weak and to promote the patriotic ideals of Empire. Sport was a healthy alternative to the hellish secular temples of debauchery and degeneracy, the theatre and the public house. Even more importantly, organised sports taught certain moral values: fair play, courage in the face of physical pain, the acceptance of loss and disappointment when losing, strict adherence to rules – the ‘stiff upper lip’, in other words. This form of evangelicalism was in part a response to the Catholic-leaning, ‘High Church’ Oxford Movement.6 In the 1830s this had sought to revive the ritualism and devotional traditions of the pre-reformation Church, but to many evangelicals, the clerics in the Oxford Movement appeared tainted with ‘effeminacy’,\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n33\n\ntheir love of robes and ceremonial redolent of ‘unmanliness’. Kingsley felt that its adherents betrayed ‘an element of foppery – even in dress and manner; a fastidious, maundering, die-away effeminacy, which is mistaken for purity and reﬁnement’. In 1865 the magazine Punch, ever the voice of the red-blooded Victorian bourgeois family man, published ‘Parsons in Petticoats’, whose author derided High Church parsons who ‘are very fond of dressing like ladies. They are much addicted to wearing vestments in smart and gay colours, and variously trimmed and embroidered.’ The Movement may well have attracted some adherents who, consciously or unconsciously, were drawn to their own sex. Sexual attraction between men had always been classiﬁed as a sin and had resulted in draconian sentences and persecution (in England sodomy was punishable by death until 1861), but it may have caused a particular kind of moral panic in Victorian England. This was due to a changed understanding of homosexual desire. No longer was it simply a sin to which anyone might succumb; now homosexuality became a medical and psychological category and the homosexual came to be seen as a different kind of person in thrall to a form of degeneracy that ought to be eradicated. Sport, then, was an antidote to effeminacy and involved a special kind of manliness. It was no longer frivolous, but earnest; even a kind of moral work rather than time-wasting play. Lawn tennis challenged this. It was revolutionary in having women and men participate together, actually playing on the same arena and hitting the ball at one another. Even golf and croquet did not pit men against women in the same way. Inevitably how women dressed for tennis became an immediate focus. It is a common assumption that ‘sport’ and ‘fashion’ are polar opposites. In fact, costume historian James Laver believed that all fashionable wear, especially men’s wear, had, at least since the eighteenth century, originated in sportswear. Beau Brummell had inaugurated a revolution in men’s dress soon after 1800. He had banished colour, embroidery, lace,\n\n34\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nhigh heels, powdered hair, jewellery and even make-up for men, replacing them with sober blacks and neutrals, white linen and leather boots, costumes based on the riding clothes worn in the countryside. (A century later Chanel’s minimalist style for women was inspired partly by the British woman’s riding habit.) The renunciation of ﬂashy display was consistent with the muscular Christianity expressed in the nineteenth-century sporting ideal. It was no longer considered manly to follow fashion – although this was a case of massive disavowal since, in practice, men cared greatly about their appearance and were the authors of most of the many rules about what constituted correct dress in any and every social situation. Fashion nonetheless became more deﬁnitely a feminine domain (and by the early and mid-twentieth century was also associated with designers whose sexuality was uncertain or dissonant and usually concealed). That tennis was at ﬁrst primarily a social occasion is indicated by the fact that women who participated in the early years of the game wore fashionable day dress. In the late 1870s and 1880s, this had reached a summit of elaboration, with bustles – heavy drapes of material caught up at the back over a wire cage concealed beneath layers of petticoats – tight bodices and constricting sleeves. Underneath this mountain of material lay hidden the corsets without which many women would have felt indecent. Teddy Tinling claimed that his friend Elizabeth Ryan – who did not remove the whalebone from her own corsets until the 1920s – said the corsets lying over the dressing-room fender after a match were not a pretty sight, ‘because some of them were bloodstained’. The stiff material and boning must have cut into or scratched the players’ bodies. Women were subject to a classic double bind: mocked for wearing such ridiculously fashionable clothes, but condemned as unfeminine when they wore clothes more suitable for play. Yet at this period fashionable dress was itself under attack. Middleclass women were becoming more active, demanding attractive garments suitable for walking and for public life in the cities. In\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n35\n\nBritain, the Rational Dress Society, formed in 1881, stated in its founding documents that it ‘protests against the introduction of any fashion in dress that either deforms the ﬁgure, impedes the movement of the body or in any way tends to injure health’. It aimed to promote styles of dress ‘based on considerations of health, comfort and beauty’. As the feminist and bicyclist, Lady Harberton, pointed out, the question of restrictive dress for women came to the fore at this time partly because women had already won a number of battles in the ﬁght for emancipation: ‘Now that women are being gradually allowed to take their place in Society as rational beings and are no longer looked upon as mere toys and slaves; and now that their livelihood is becoming more and more to be considered their own affair, the question of dress assumes proportions which it did not use to have.’ Lottie Dod, who ﬁrst won Wimbledon at the age of ﬁfteen in 1887 (and on four subsequent occasions) and was never beaten, always spoke up in favour of the right of women players to dress in a manner that did not impede their tennis. She took to wearing a cap after the kerchief that at ﬁrst had kept her hair in order ﬂew off during a match, owing to her violent volleying. She was admired for her on-court outﬁts; on one occasion she was described as wearing a dark blue skirt and rust-coloured blouse with embroidered collar and cuffs. White at this early period was by no means universal. As in so many other spheres of life, tradition was the sediment of actions and choices that had seemed initially merely pragmatic. When lawn tennis began there were no rules concerning dress. White gained popularity because it was more practical. It showed sweat stains less than colours did, and absorbed less heat, and so was cooler to wear when playing in hot sunlight. Contrary to what some commentators have maintained, there seems no evidence that white was chosen for reasons of snobbery – it easily got dirty and only those could wear it who could afford continual washing and cleaning. This is more likely to have been part of the myth of the ‘sissy’, ‘snobby’ game.\n\n36\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nThe presence of women, whatever they wore, remained controversial and it may have been partly for this reason that it was not, or rarely, played at the public schools. Writing in 1924, George Hillyard, an important ﬁgure in tennis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pleaded for it to be included. But it never was in any consistent way. Hillyard had no real explanation for this, other than that it was not a team game, but then as he pointed out, neither were rackets or squash, which were played at public schools.7 In 1902 there appeared a player who perfectly embodied the manly sporting ideal. The New Zealander, Anthony Wilding, whose parents had emigrated from Herefordshire four years before his birth in 1883, arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, to study law. He was an outstanding tennis player, but was struck by the fact that no one at Cambridge took it seriously. The undergraduates referred to it as ‘pat ball’ or, in the Oxbridge slang of the time, as ‘patters’ – and this view was widespread.8 Tennis was not seen as a manly sport, and the Daily Telegraph, for example, had been known to refer to it as a ‘harmless and amusing vagary’, akin to a ‘gypsy van holiday’ or a ‘slumming crusade’ – its social positioning somehow associated with its moral ambiguity. This did not deter Wilding who felt that ‘pat ball’ no longer adequately described the game. There had been a complete change from the tennis played thirty years previously and the style of ‘gently lobbing the ball over the net into the middle of the court’ was now ‘as extinct as the moa’, two of the most marked alterations being increased pace and volleying. He also thought that ‘the modern tendency in lawn tennis is to make the game faster; it may not be such an accurate style as that adopted by the giants of yesterday, but strenuous it is’. Wilding was a paradoxical ﬁgure as a tennis player. His Australian doubles partner, Norman Brookes, noted that Wilding took ‘inﬁnite pains’ to develop the technical side of his game and to train scientiﬁcally. In this way he reproduced the specialism and the ideals of scientiﬁc efﬁciency and continual improvement that\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n37\n\nwere at the heart of industrial society – and were to shape tennis, as all sports. His biographers claim that after him ‘athletes rather than aesthetes dominated the game’ and he himself likened tennis to boxing in terms of the physical effort involved (a comparison that was to return a century later). That Wilding was killed in the trenches at Neuve-Chapelle in 1915 further established him as a heroic ﬁgure. After his death, A. Wallis Myers wrote a eulogy to his friend, trying to account for his extraordinary popularity: ‘He was not a scholar. He cared nothing for politics; he hated war. Of books, music and the ﬁne arts he had but cursory knowledge.’ Myers could only explain Wilding’s appeal as due to ‘personal magnetism’ and to the fact that while ‘physically and mentally he became a man; spiritually he was a boy to the end’. So as Wallis Myers described him, he perfectly embodied the Tom Brown’s Schooldays ideal.9 Yet Wilding loved the deeply glamorous side of tennis, light years removed from the public school ethos. He frankly admitted that he preferred the tournaments in the south of France to those in rainy England. The weather was much better and the tournaments themselves were more fun and less drearily businesslike. There were also the better restaurants and the casinos and other entertainments. Play continued on Sundays; and ﬁnally, matches were better organised, with a proper ‘order of play’, whereas in England players had to hang about – sheltering under the trees if, as often happened, it was raining – not knowing when they would be called. The Monte Carlo tournament in particular was run on a lavish scale, there was ‘free admission to the grounds and the whole business, like the motor boat races and pigeon shooting [was] an auxiliary to the casino’. Wilding was an Adonis of the court and this brought him a devoted fan following. After Norman Brookes defeated him in the Wimbledon ﬁnal of 1914 – he’d won the title the four previous years – Mrs Brookes, seated in the audience, recalled that ‘the emotion of the ladies round me on Tony Wilding’s defeat was embarrassing, in fact some actually wept; and when an excited\n\n38\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nautograph hunter rushed on the court and Tony bent his back for Norman to rest the book upon it, a sigh of anguish went up’.10 Wilding was a pivotal ﬁgure just at the outbreak of the First World War. After it had ended, the Riviera he had loved would become the setting for tennis at its most glamorous and worldly.\n\n5 On the Riviera\n\nO\n\nNCE THE RIVIERA HAD BEEN a jagged line of beaches, with nothing between the turquoise sea and the Basses Alpes but umbrella pines, olive groves and ﬁshing villages. The local peasants did not notice that it was a sleeping paradise waiting to be transformed until an English milord, Lord Brougham (a former British Lord Chancellor), was detained in the village of Cannes in 1834 and fell in love with the climate and scenery, so different from what he referred to as the ‘land of fog’ he had left behind. He built a villa and made Cannes his permanent home, where friends visited him, returning to Britain with tales of the warm south, with the result that it soon became fashionable for the English leisured classes to winter there. They were shortly followed by their European counterparts. The Englishness of Nice was underlined by the erection of Protestant churches and the colonisers brought their strict Victorian manners and morality with them. The visitors spent winters in the South for their health and to recuperate. The South of the northern imagination was, says Mary Blume, a land of the recovery of innocence and simplicity.1 Yet these were travellers of a new type. Their wealth came typically from investment; many were rentiers, gentlemen (and ladies) of leisure. As art historian Kenneth Clark was to comment of his own parents, ‘they were known as the idle rich … some may have been richer, but none were idler’.2\n\n40\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nLeisure was itself a new concept. It represented ‘spare time’ – empty time that needed to be ﬁlled. Travel was no longer religious – a pilgrimage; nor was it part of the grand tour – an educational enterprise aimed at widening the minds of the young aristocrat. It was the pursuit of health, yes, but also of pleasure and excitement. The development of tourism expressed a thirst for experience and novelty for their own sake. The vision persisted of the Mediterranean coast as an innocent and idyllic retreat, an ideal spot for the simple life to be lived. Yet when the French poet, Stéphen Liégeard, named it the Côte d’Azur in the 1880s he had already tinged it with sophistication. 3 The innocence and isolation of the villages and olive groves were gradually displaced as villas and hotels appeared on the cliffs and promontories and, as gardens encroached on former farmland, its ambience began to change. Lines of exotic plants – cypresses, mimosa, eucalyptus and above all the palm tree – created a different, more stylised, slightly unreal landscape. Tourism was creating a new location: the Riviera. The lower corniche road was built and in 1864, the railway arrived in Nice, which became the earliest tourist economy city. By the 1870s its foreign inhabitants numbered 25,000. The development of the Mediterranean coast was in full swing. In 1866 François Blanc undertook the construction of the Monte Carlo casino. He had been found guilty of stock market fraud in France in 1837, but was a brilliant ﬁnancier according to Lord Brougham, and this was borne out by his success in the principality of Monaco. He had already run the casino at the German spa town of Bad Homburg and now created a complete gambling city with lavish hotels built on the lines of the heavily ornate establishments found in inland spas. Gambling was forbidden in France, so the principality had a monopoly. In 1875 the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Monte Carlo set the seal of social glamour upon it and the whole Côte d’Azur. The belief that a sojourn beside the Mediterranean was good for the health promoted the development of physical recreations.\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n41\n\nTwo of the earliest British tennis stars, the Renshaw brothers, had several courts laid down at a Cannes hotel with a surface known as terre battue, made of crushed bricks and shards of pottery from a nearby atelier. Soon other hotels followed suit and tennis tournaments sprang up along the littoral. Cannes became the Mecca of continental tennis. Norman Brookes’ teenage wife Mabel described this life with wide-eyed wonder on her ﬁrst visit from Australia shortly before the First World War. The English still predominated then, ‘adding a solid background of more famous names and much money’ to the exotic social whirl. The Casino was the focal point of night life; the restaurant, band, dance ﬂoor and even the gigolos were superb. ‘Soft lights, tangos, hot house ﬂowers, the wide glassed windows facing the Med., Greek syndicate gamblers, kings, Russian grand dukes, demi-mondaines, rich merchants, some smart French types from Paris, crowded a bejewelled scene.’ There was also the beautiful scenery: ‘Tumbling gardens of spring ﬂowers down on to the coast, aeroplanes circling in a vivid sky and Nice half-hidden below … the white wisteria cloying the air’ and not least the intoxicating presence of cohorts of titled British beauties, the celebrities of their day, familiar from their photographs in glossy magazines.4 Charles Lenglen was one of those who took his family to spend the winter on the Riviera at the turn of the twentieth century. A small rentier, who had inherited a horse-drawn bus company from his father, he quickly noticed the unusual athletic ability of his only child, Suzanne, born in 1898. By the age of ten she was skilled at diabolo, a game played with a top suspended and thrown up with a string. Playing the game on the front at Nice, she soon drew crowds of tourists with her astonishing dexterity. The Lenglen family, however, was no troupe of wandering performers. Lenglen père was soon inscribed at the fashionable Nice Tennis Club and it was not long before Suzanne had been admitted as a member of this club, which normally debarred children.\n\n42\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nCharles trained his daughter himself, developing her game in two crucial ways. He placed squares and eventually small coins on the court and had her practise her ground strokes until she could unfailingly direct the ball to any point on the court. Secondly, ﬁnding the normal women’s game too slow and stately, he studied the men’s game and taught Suzanne to play like a man, with power, drive, placement and speed. Such was her talent that the adult male club members were happy to hit with her. Charles no doubt also noticed that even before the First World War tennis players enjoyed a privileged place in Riviera society. Dressed in ﬂawless white, they mingled with the grand dukes, the courtesans, the ﬁnanciers and the English aristocracy, like angels ﬂoating above the sumptuous worldly procession, as in a Renaissance painting. The craze for tennis that had already gripped France was beginning to establish the tennis player as a kind of celebrity – and in any case many of the players were already rich or titled or both. In the Mediterranean sunshine the decorous fun of the Edwardian lawn tennis tea party took on a more sophisticated élan. Suzanne had already won a major tournament in Paris before the outbreak of war in 1914 and had suffered her last singles defeat – to Marguerite Broquedis. This was also the year in which she met and started to play with the American, Elizabeth Ryan, creating a doubles partnership that would never be beaten. Formal tennis tournaments were in abeyance during the First World War, but Lenglen continued to develop her game. Ballet or Greek dance lessons – or both – further enhanced her wonderful movement. Then, once the United States entered the war in 1917, the Riviera began to see wounded American soldiers who arrived to convalesce. As they recuperated tennis fever was renewed. This was perhaps the moment the Americans discovered the Riviera – several years before the arrival of Dick and Nicole Diver, the protagonists of Scott Fitzgerald’s Riviera novel, Tender is the Night – but their presence was only one aspect of the change that overtook the Côte d’Azur after 1918. It was not unrelated to the\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n43\n\ncultural changes that made the emergence of ‘Suzanne Lenglen’, the international celebrity, possible. In the period of fast-developing capitalism in the 1920s, tennis represented all the characteristics of that burgeoning consumer society. It was an age of sensations and what A. L. Laney termed ‘ballyhoo’. It was individualism and competition – capitalism – in the purest form. Team sports were also competitive, yet ‘the team’ had originally represented the collective effort of the British as they built the Empire. The tennis star emerging after 1918 was more akin to a ﬁlm star. Film brought the beauty and personality of the acting stars incredibly close; they were as if accessible. The tennis player too was a similar ﬁgure, with the addition of heroism in that she or he was pitted against a single adversary. Rivalry, the clash of personality and the intricacies of each individual were under the microscope. In the 1920s tennis was also the most international of all sports. The Davis Cup had helped to create this situation, but more important was its status as an elite game and the favourite of international café society. As such it projected a glamour absent from other mass spectator sports then developing. At the same time it was part of the enhanced sporting culture that had emerged in part out of the war. Suzanne’s close friend, Antoine ‘Coco’ Gentien (‘a delightful socialite playboy’ according to Teddy Tinling), quoted the prophecy of a friend: ‘A sea of blood is about to engulf Europe and everything we have loved will drown in it. As soon as men have stopped killing each other they will persist in their love of combat and sport will replace more reﬁned pleasures.’ 5 This was exactly what happened. The nationalism intensiﬁed by war could be channelled in this new direction. The war, moreover, had brought physical prowess and endurance to the fore. Medical and scientiﬁc advances led to a new understanding of the importance of bodily health and strength; and sport, which already had a place in the construction of the physically and morally healthy body, mind and soul\n\n44\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\n– and body politic – before 1914, became still more important. ‘Healthy recreation’ was the new watchword. For the expanding middle classes tennis became an alluring leisure activity, for both players and spectators. But more than that, the belief that sport promoted character and morality, while now less openly religious (or rather, Christian) became if anything more pervasive. At the same time pleasure was not dead, for a new emphasis on entertainment, pleasure and self-development offset the mood of post-war disillusionment and spectator sports were central to this. Alongside the development of sport came sports journalism – part of the wider development of the popular and tabloid press, whose agenda was sensationalism and excitement. After the privations, dangers and anxieties of war – and also its singular purposelessness: the loss of millions of lives in return for the unsatisfactory and unsustainable Treaty of Versailles – citizens sought forgetfulness in hedonism and the spectacle of sport seemed to promise a fair contest, excitement and partisanship without the reality of death. As Fred Perry observed in the 1930s, ‘Then as now ordinary people were more interested in Amelia Earhart’s ﬂying from Honolulu to California in 18½ hrs and in Donald Campbell’s landspeed record of 301 mph than in Hitler or Baldwin.’ The Riviera was the most glittering theatre for the new sporting culture, but, suggests Mary Blume, the North/South dichotomy took on a new and more ambiguous meaning. From signifying the recovery of innocence, the South (particularly the south of France) now suggested licence, excess and decadence. The writer Somerset Maugham, who lived there, referred to it as a ‘sunny place for shady people’.6 Even in the 1870s some of the most famous courtesans of the day – Liane de Pougy, la Belle Otero and Cora Pearl (aka Emma Crunch from south London) – had made it their playground, or hunting ground, and the idea of escape to an enchanted land could easily modulate into the lure of forbidden adventure and abandonment of conventions. The gambling that was at the heart of the Riviera’s success\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n45\n\nwas a pointer to its moral uncertainty. The ideal of erotic and personal freedom also suggested by the Riviera could equally shade into self-destructive futility. The recognition of beauty and grace, the search for new experiences at all costs was the goal: ‘not the fruit of experience but experience itself, is the end’, as the nineteenth-century high priest of the Aesthetic Movement, Walter Pater, had expressed it. But this lust for experience and the exquisite aesthetic discrimination that supposedly accompanied it could lead, as in the case of Dick and Nicole Diver, to the collapse of moral discrimination. Too much freedom, too much ‘spare time’, too much leisure, led to a downward spiral of ﬂirtations, love affairs, drugs and even insanity. Tennis and tennis tournaments were central to the social round. Competitive matches were scheduled early enough in the day for players and spectators to seek relief afterwards from the midday heat in the cool of the hotel bars or dining rooms. Then, after the siesta, there might be another tennis match, and later thés dansants and gambling at the casinos. It was usually the men who gambled while their wives and mistresses danced with the danseurs mondains. These were not gigolos, but genuine dancing partners. The Riviera was as much a magnet for artists as for tennis and golf players. From 1883 the Calais–Nice–Rome express, with its lavish sleeping cars, had plied the route from north to south. In 1922 this became the Train Bleu and such was its fame and aura that it gave the title not only to Agatha Christie’s Mystery of the Blue Train (‘At the tennis one meets everyone,’ says Hercule Poirot in the course of solving this particular puzzle), but of Diaghilev’s ballet, Le Train Bleu, created for the youthful dancer, Anton Dolin. Jean Cocteau had seen Dolin performing complicated acrobatics in a theatre corridor and this had given him the idea of a ballet revolving round the athletic hero of a seaside resort. What Diaghilev couldn’t understand was why Dolin chose to spend his spare time in Monte Carlo playing tennis or having picnics, rather than improving his mind by listening to the conversation of Picasso and Stravinsky. 7\n\n46\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nLe Train Bleu had been anticipated by an earlier ballet, Jeux, originally commissioned by Diaghilev in 1912 to a score by Debussy as a vehicle for his star, Nijinsky. It revolved round a game of tennis played by two men and a girl – although Diaghilev had wanted all three protagonists to be men. It wasn’t well received and was not revived. (A century later a new version, or recreation, was given its world premiere at the Royal Opera House in London. Based on a fragment of choreography by the late Kenneth Macmillan, it explored the themes of ﬂirtation, games and rivalries and successfully represented the movements of tennis in balletic form, emphasising the similarities between the two.) Le Train Bleu, with sets by Picasso, was created in 1924 by Bronislava Nijinska (Nijinsky’s sister) to celebrate the sporting and beach culture of the Riviera and also the Olympic Games, played in Paris that year. The ballet captures with utter vivacity the total physical and sporting élan and exuberance of the Côte d’Azur. In essence a traditional one-act ballet with pas de deux, solos and ensembles, it is nevertheless an example of ‘lifestyle modernism’ according to dance historian Lynn Garafola.8 It concerns the game of love as a muscle man, a swimmer, a golfer and a tennis player ﬂirt on the beach, costumed for the most part in the ultra-simple one-piece costumes of vests and abbreviated shorts of the 1920s, apart from the golfer in plus fours and check sweater and the tennis player clad in the style of Helen Wills, complete with white eye shade. The choreography mimics the golfer’s drive; the tennis player’s solos show how close to dance tennis can be. This ballet was costumed by Chanel, herself a devotee of the Côte d’Azur lifestyle, to which her minimalist fashions were perfectly adapted. Her style, claimed Cecil Beaton, had created a completely new type of woman and of female beauty. Its archetype was a Spanish duchess: who appeared wearing a short white tunic with a deep scooped neckline and a skirt that stretched barely to the\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n47\n\nknees … sunburn stockings with white satin shoes whose Spanish spike heels were fully six inches high. Her hair, brilliantined to a satin brilliance, was drawn back as tightly as a bullﬁghter’s … [Her] complexion matched her stockings, for she was burned by the sun to a deep shade of iodine. Two enormous rows of pearl teeth were bared in a white, vital grin, complementing the half a dozen rows of pearls … that hung about her neck.9\n\nThe new Riviera lifestyle started from the revolutionary assumption that the Riviera was the perfect resort, not for the winter, as it once had been, but in the heat of the summer. At ﬁrst the gesture of arriving at the littoral just as the season was ending, of staying in deserted hotels – your wealth having prevailed on the proprietor to keep it open instead of, as usual, closing it – of lounging on empty beaches or of pursuing your art uninterrupted by the bustle of Paris or New York, was the most radical gesture, denoting a new way of life, a new aesthetic, a new freedom of the body. The photographer and painter Jacques Henri Lartigue felt that the guests at the hotel where he was staying were ‘dreary and miserable’ in their stuffy urban outﬁts. Worse still, they were old, ‘even the young ones’. By contrast he had glimpsed a young woman in a white dress, ‘bareheaded and laughing beneath the sun’, accompanied by a young man in a sweater and espadrilles, ‘which go better with the landscape and the sunlight than the creaking leather boots of the gentlemen who are afraid of the sun’.10 In other words the Côte d’Azur now did more than provide a respite from the formal way of life; it challenged it. This was a better way to be. It was also intoxicating: swimming in the transparent sea, Lartigue felt overwhelmed by the light and completely transported out of himself. On her ﬁrst visit in 1926 Helen Wills, Lenglen’s young rival and later to become eight times Wimbledon singles champion, felt that the Riviera was already past its best. To her it seemed ‘not\n\n48\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nquite real, it was like a dream in which things were happening with the extravagance of grand opera and the effect of a musical comedy. It had just about reached the point where it had had its day … but its winter following had not yet entirely deserted it.’ What most startled her was this glimpse of ‘a world new to me where the main object was pleasure’. There seemed nothing to do but to seek ways of passing the time pleasurably. ‘This came as a surprise to me, as such a thing had not occurred to me before.’ Her life hitherto had consisted almost entirely of serious study and serious tennis in the exclusive but sedate surroundings of Berkeley, California. Now, however, ‘it began to dawn on me that people were interesting and sometimes amusing’. She described the glitzy Les Ambassadeurs where the bands played tangos and fox trots, you could see the yachts in the harbour from the long windows and the interior glittered with light. Best of all were the exotic human beings who peopled this strange environment, for example, a ‘dramatic looking lady with tired eyes, and a series of halo hats in different colours, who used to arrive in a large yellow Hispano-Suiza with chauffeur and footman. She could dance only with gigolos, except on weekends, when her protector, a manufacturer, would come from Paris.’ Helen Wills added with provincial innocence, ‘I had vaguely imagined such people existed only on the screen. Certainly there were none in Berkeley, California.’ 11 The post-war Riviera was louder and faster and some felt more vulgar than in its Edwardian heyday, but it had not lost its glamour. And tennis played there continued to have great prestige. The English inﬂuence was waning, but still dominated the sport. One travel writer of the period described the La Festa club at Monte Carlo, ‘in the capable hands of Mr William G. Henley, the secretary of the Federation Monégasque de Lawn-Tennis, who used to be the British Consul for these parts. Write to him at La Festa … If you are respectable, no difﬁculty will be made about your becoming a member. Subscriptions cost very little; a member can introduce guests.’\n\nLOVE GAME\n\n49\n\nIn 1927 a new centre, La Festa Country Club at St Roman, was built. There it seemed the players were magniﬁcently provided for. Dressing rooms were the last word in luxury. There were showers, a good bar and access to the beach and the sea. There was even a telephone in every cabin. The Riviera tournaments marked the beginning of the international tennis season, their standing outshone only by Wimbledon, the French tournament at Roland Garros and the US National championships. Many aristocrats, including King Gustav of Sweden, still graced the courts and there was always a sprinkling of titles among the contestants: Baron de Morpurgo, Baron Kehrling and Baron Salm. The administration remained under the control of the British: A. E. Madge, who ofﬁciated as referee and manager at the ﬁrst Monte Carlo tournament in 1903 was still in charge more than twenty-ﬁve years later. (The administration of golf was also almost entirely British.) 12 Other less salubrious inﬂuences were at play, for the Riviera tennis world in the 1920s exempliﬁed what many felt were morally dubious aspects of the game, now in terms of money rather than sexual misconduct. After 1924 tennis had been disbarred from the Olympic Games on the grounds that it was not a genuinely amateur sport. It was clear that, unassisted, Charles Lenglen could not have supported his daughter’s lifestyle. A great friend of Suzanne was the society hostess, Lady Wavertree, whose ‘constant companion’ was F. M. B. Fisher, an executive of the Dunlop company that produced racquets and balls and constituted an important presence on the Riviera. Also powerful and important were the three Burke brothers who ran the Carlton tennis club at Cannes and who were among Suzanne’s closest friends. In 1926 a historic match between Lenglen and Helen Wills attracted hordes of press correspondents. The cloud of journalists, desperate for stories as they hung about waiting for the match, began to probe the rather suspect ﬁnancial basis of the\n\n50\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nscene. Searching questions were asked of players who appeared to have no visible means of support, yet who were staying in the best hotels. This included Helen Wills and her mother, although, to be fair, on their arrival they had booked into a simple pension, only to be whisked to the Carlton Hotel, where they were offered free hospitality for their whole stay. This they accepted, perhaps a little naively, having been told that it was the usual thing. Wills also accepted several outﬁts from Jean Patou, Lenglen’s couturier. There were protracted arguments between journalists and the Burke brothers about the price demanded for the rights to report the Wills–Lenglen encounter; and equally acrimonious ones between the Burkes and the newsreel companies. The whole ugly issue of proﬁt was exposed to view, and the question, not fully answered, was raised: who proﬁted from the huge sums generated by this extraordinary show? So, says Teddy Tinling, ‘the whole question of under-thecounter payments to “amateur” stars and the then dirty word “shamateurism”, were ﬁrst publicly aired in the discussions surrounding the Lenglen-Wills match.’ 13 Tennis no less than other sports was vulnerable to corruption. Its sheen of glamour began to develop cracks, exposing a less than beautiful reality beneath the hedonistic surface. Jean Vigo’s bitterly satirical ﬁlm, A Propos de Nice, made in 1931, ﬁlmed the tourists promenading along the crowded front, still dressed for town in homburg hats, high heels, cloche hats and furs, and juxtaposed the poverty of a service class catering to the rich and idle: the laundries, the weary waiters, the slums behind the façade.\n\n6 What’s wrong with women?\n\nI\n\nT WAS IRONIC THAT SUZANNE LENGLEN, a woman, should have become the ﬁrst international tennis celebrity, given the controversy surrounding women’s very presence on the court. Long before she stepped into the spotlight the men in charge of the game had thoroughly objected to a new generation of young women who had rebelled against the lives of passivity led by their mothers and were bent on a different existence. Lottie Dod wrote forcefully of the difﬁculties that faced women in the early years. She pointed to the curious inconsistency whereby tennis was regarded at one and the same time as ‘only a lady’s game’, a ‘pat ball’ pastime unworthy of sporting men, yet equally ‘quite beyond their powers’ either to play it or to understand the scoring system. There was ‘at one time a real danger’, said Lottie Dod, ‘lest men’s and women’s lawn tennis should be entirely separated, with different grounds, balls, and laws.’ 1 True, a women’s tournament was organised in Dublin in 1879, but it was not played on the usual courts in Fitzwilliam Square, as this was considered too public a venue. Nor were ladies admitted as members to the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club. When women’s tournaments were initiated at Wimbledon in 1884, the doubles were played away from the main grounds. It is difﬁcult to understand these objections until one becomes fully aware of just how restricted the lives and movements of\n\n52\n\nELIZABETH WILSON\n\nmiddle-class women were in the 1870s and 1880s. Many people, and not just men, felt it was not respectable for women to be seen playing actively in public at all. Women violated their own femininity in making violent movements, and seeming to perspire or be out of breath was unthinkable and even indecent, so strongly was femininity equated with passivity. This was one of the most inhibiting factors for female players: the convention that prevented young women from any vigorous display of movement. Lord Curzon, one-time viceroy of India and a government minister at this period, is notoriously said to have said of sexual intercourse that ‘ladies don’t move’ and this prohibition on lively activity extended much more generally. Anything else was damaging to their femininity. There was also the question of fashionable dress, for, asked Lottie Dod in exasperation, how could women ‘ever hope to play a sound game when their dresses impede the free movement of every limb? In many cases their very breathing is rendered difﬁcult.’ She herself wore a white ﬂannel cap on her dark, cropped hair, a skirt that stopped short of the ankles and showed black woollen stockings and black shoes. Her shirt was high collared, its sleeves long. This was for the period a radical outﬁt, especially the short hair, but she was able to get away with it because, being under sixteen, she was still regarded as a child. Women’s daywear became simpliﬁed in the 1890s with the introduction of the tailored coat and skirt outﬁt suitable for working women in the fast growing cities. The middle-class craze for the bicycle led to further attempts to promote practical women’s clothing. Tennis wear followed suit.
