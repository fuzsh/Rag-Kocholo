        "text": "David Nalbandian, who retired four years ago, says he had a decent chance to get into the final at the 2004Â French Open,Â butÂ was injured inÂ the semifinals.\n\nThe Argentine had reached the final inÂ Rome just before the French Open, and during the tournament he beatÂ two No. 1sâGustavo Kuerten and Marat Safin.Â But during the semis againstÂ fellow ArgentineÂ Gaston Gaudio,Â Nalbandianâs body broke down and he lost, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-0.\n\n\"I played withÂ a torn abdomen,â Nalbandian told Radio Uno.Â âBut I think that Gaston was playing very well, and especiallyÂ on the clay, a surface whichÂ always affectsÂ me more.â\n\nNalbandian was out for two months after that.\n\nIn addition, he recalled injury affecting him during another Grand Slam semifinalâat the 2003 U.S. Open, where heÂ competedÂ against American Andy Roddick. They playedÂ a classic five-setter, butÂ Nalbandian said he couldnât move at the end.\n\nâI played withÂ aÂ torn abdominal against Roddick,â Nalbandian said. âAlso, in that same match, I broke a bone on my hand.â\n\nThe former No. 3 won 11 titlesâincludingÂ the 2005Â ATP Masters Cup and two Masters titlesâand reached the final of Wimbledon in 2002. In 2013, the 35-year-old retired, saying that his body was too sore and his shoulderÂ was done.\n\nâThe shoulder injury in 2013 was the key that I could not play anymore,â Nalbandian said. âI knew I did not have much left, but I still had desire. I tried to recover, but my shoulder was not in condition to compete.\"\n\nThough his commitment was sometimes questioned, NalbandianÂ spokeÂ aboutÂ the importance ofÂ theÂ game.\n\nâThe passionÂ in tennis andÂ in sport is spectacular,â he said. âThe adrenaline that you find on court you do not find anywhere else. IfÂ [I] were born again,Â I would be a tennis player again.\"\n\nThese days, heÂ is involved with rally-carÂ racing andÂ is the father ofÂ two children.\n\n\"The truth is, I do not miss tennis,â he said. âLife isÂ in stages and I feel it is a stageÂ already closed. Today,Â it is another stage ... I enjoy all the things tennis stopsâmy family, watching my children grow.\"\n\nÂ· Get Tennis Channel Plus for Roland Garros to watch 200 live matches from up to five courts, starting with the Qualifying Rounds.\n\nÂ· Watch the Best of Roland Garros 2016 on-demand at any time\n\nÂ· Get Tennis Channel Plus for all of Roland Garros, as well as 650+ live events all year long\n\nÂ· Tennis Channel Plus is available on any streaming device, on mobile, always on the GO (desktop, iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire)\n\nÂ· Subscribe today at BuyTCPlus.com\n\nPLUS: Watch theÂ Racquet Bracket Show on Tennis Channel this Friday at 9 PM ETâthen play the Racquet Bracket game for the men's and women's draws."
