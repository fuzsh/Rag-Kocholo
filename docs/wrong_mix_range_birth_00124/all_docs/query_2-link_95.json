        "text": "PARIS, France -- U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick was confirmed as end-of-year world number one in men's tennis in the final ATP Champions Race rankings of the season, despite his semifinal defeat at the Masters Cup in Los Angeles.\n\nThe American 21-year-old was beaten by Switzerland's Roger Federer at the elite event. The Wimbledon winner claimed second in the rankings by beating Andre Agassi in the final. (Full Story)\n\nFrench Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain finished third, ahead of 32-year-old Agassi, who won the first Grand Slam of the year in Australia.\n\nRoddick, who becomes the second-youngest player to win the end-of-season honor, succeeds Lleyton Hewitt who had held the title for the past two years.\n\n\"I'm incredibly honored to finish the year as number one but I'm probably more proud to be the sixth American,\" Roddick said last week after Agassi's win over Ferrero guaranteed his top ranking.\n\nAustralian Hewitt, whose best Grand Slam performance of the year was a quarterfinal defeat by Ferrero at the U.S. Open, crashed to 17th on the new list in a season disrupted by injuries.\n\nGuillermo Coria of Argentina finished in fifth place, after winning five titles including the Hamburg Masters Series event.\n\nGermany's Rainer Schuettler, a finalist at the Australian Open, was sixth, ahead of Carlos Moya of Spain, Argentina's David Nalbandian and Australian Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
