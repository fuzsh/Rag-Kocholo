        "text": "The Paris Masters is one of the 9 ATP Masters 1000 tournaments and is the last Masters tournament of the year. It is the only Masters tournament which is held indoors and is the last important tournament before the season ending ATP Tour finals.\n\nLet us look at the history of the tournament, how the top seeds have fared over the years and how the draw looks like this year. I will like I always do, look at how the top 4 seeds have fared earlier, and what is the draw for them. Since Novak is 6th seed, I will look at his past performance and his draw as well.\n\nWorld Number 1 Carlos Alcaraz is the top seed here. He has had a tremendous year and has even become a teen Grand Slam winner by lifting the US Open 2022. In the 2021 Paris Masters, he was unseeded and had defeated a seeded Sinner before losing to the young Frenchman Gaston in the 4th round. Amazing that from an unseeded player just a year back he is both a Grand Slam champion and the world number 1 just 12 months later.\n\nWhat does the draw look like for Carlos. He will start against Karatsev or Nishioka. Berrettini is a likely 3rd round opponent while in tghe QF he may meet Hurkacz or Rublev. If both progess, it will be a Alcaraz-Medvedev final, and it will be much looked forward to.\n\nAlcaraz has won two Masters titles so far. He would be keen to make it three. He would also like to make amends for his SF loss to Felix at Basel and win at Paris.\n\nRafa Nadal is seeded second. His comeback is sensational news. He had lost to Tiafoe at the US Open before playing a solitary doubles with Roger Federer at the Laver Cup, which was the last match in Federer’s amazing career. Coach Moya confirmed that Nadal will be playing not just the Paris Masters but at Turin too. Interestingly they are two of the only three important tournaments that Rafa has not won in his career, with the 3rd being the Miami Open. At Miami he has reached the finals as many as 5 times and the finals twice at the ATP year ending tournament. At the Paris Masters, he has reached the finals only once, which was in 2007, which ended in a straight set loss to David Nalbandian. He has also reached the SF twice. In 2019 he gave a walkover to David Shapovalov after sustaining an abdominal injury during preparation after winning his quarter-finals. In 2020 he lost in the semi-finals to Sascha Zverev.\n\nWhat does the draw look like for Nadal. He is in the same half as Novak. He will face either Agut or Tommy Paul in his 1st match. Seeded players he is likely to face are Busta and then Tsitsipas in the Quarter Final. Fans will be hoping for a Novak-Rafa SF, which will be their 60th match.\n\nCasper Ruud is the 3rd seed. Just 23, he has won 9 titles already, 8 of which are on clay. He has reached the Finals of both the French Open and the US Open in 2022. Last year he was seeded 6th and lost to the 4th seeded Sascha Zverev in the QF. In both 2019 and 2020 he had lost in the 1st round which shows (like Alcaraz) how much he has progressed in a short time.\n\nWhat does the draw look like for Ruud. His 1st match will be versus the winner of Molcan and Gasquet and then if he wins he meets the winner between Musetti and Basilashvii. Thereafter a blockbuster QF with Djokovic awaits us.\n\n4th seeded Medvedev has done well here in this tournament earlier. He won here in 2020 and lost to Novak in last year’s final. This year he has probably the toughest draw amongst all the contenders. He meets the winner of Alex de Minaur and Sebastian Korda in the second round, US Open semi-finalist Tiafoe in the 3rd, and an in-form Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarters.\n\nIt feels surprising that Novak is not in the top 4 seeds, but thats the way it is. The 38 Masters winner is seeded number 6 for the Paris Masters 2022. He will be looking forward for a third indoor title in a row after winning at Tel Aviv and at Astana. The six time winner at this event said that he is feeling good and the Astana and Tel Aviv titles have raised his confidence as well as his motivation. Lat year he had defeated Medvedev in the final. He is the only player to have defended his title here (2013-2015). His 6 wins in the finals were over Monfils, Ferrer, Raonic, Murray, Shapovalov, and Medvedev. He has lost one final here which was to Karen Khachanov in 2018. Though he is the 6th seed, he will be one of the favorites along with world number 1 Alcaraz, with other contenders, Medvedev and Nadal.\n\nWhat does the draw look like for Novak. He is likely to meet serve and volley specialist Maxime Cressy or Diego Schwartzmann for his 1st match, and then he is likely to meet Khachanov and Sinner (or Cilic) before taking on Ruud in the quarter-finals.\n\nOnly 4 players have won both the French Open and the Paris Masters and they are Nastase, Agassi, Federer, and Novak. Nastase had won in the same year, 1973. Agassi too won both in 1999 and Novak too did so in 2021. Can Rafa become the 5th? and only the 4th to win both in the same year. If anyone can, it is the 22 time Grand Slam champion, notwithstanding his not having won here before.\n\nThis tournament is also very important because even now there are two spots available for Turin and Rublev, Felix AA, Hurkacz, and Taylor Fritz are in the reckoning. Rublev and Hurkacz are in one quarter, and so are Felix and Fritz. They are likely to meet and the result could decide the Turin line up as well.\n\nLooking forward to a great tournament and may the best player win. As for me, I am hoping for a Rafa-Novak final and Novak winning it and going on to win the tournament with a win over the world number 1 in the finals.\n\nAs promised, I am back with Part 2 of the American President series. Part 1 was about 9 Presidents who became President by chance, since they were Vice-President, and the President either passed away or was assassinated or resigned, necessitating the Vice-President having to take over as the POTUS.\n\nThe link for the same post is here:\n\nIn Part 2, I will discuss some interesting and little know information about the Presidents amongst the founding-fathers. As we all know, there were seven inspiring leaders who are called the founding fathers. They are George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe 3 founding fathers who did not become POTUS were Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nBenjamin Franklin who is on the 100$ note, was a multifaceted personality. He was a writer, diplomat, inventor, scientist, statesman, and publisher. He was the 1st Postmaster General of the USA. John Jay was the 1st Chief Justice of the USA. Alexander Hamilton was the 1st Treasury Secretary of George Washington and his place in history is assured for being the youngest Member of the Cabinet, even as of today. He is a fascinating personality and I have written a specific blog about him; The link is below;\n\nNow let us discuss some interesting information about the four founding fathers who became POTUS.\n\nGeorge Washington; Several books can be written and have been written about this great man. Let me choose just 4-5 facts which characterize his personality. He chose the title, Mr. President, instead of more lofty and ceremonial titles such as “His Excellency”, and “His Highness the President”. He proclaimed Nov.26 as day of Thanksgiving to encourage National Unity. He declined a third term in office, and this set the precedent of a two term tenure, which was broken by FDR but then it was made a law by the 22nd Amendment.\n\nInterestingly, I have also written a blog on the how and when of “two tenures of the American President”. The link of the blog is below;\n\nPresident Washington’s farewell Address is considered to be one of the most influential speeches by leaders in history. Washington had lot of land and slaves but less income and so to supplement his income, he had a distillery for whiskey production. Later he also made individual plots and lots of land and sold them to middle-income investors. He is considered as one of the greatest Presidents of the USA.\n\nJohn Adams was the 1st Vice President of the USA under George Washington. He was the second President of the USA. He is called the father of the American Navy. He wanted to have a second term but did not have enough support for the same. He is the only founding father not to have two tenure as President. His most famous quote is, “To be good and to do good, is all we have to do”. There is an interesting conspiracy theory about him that he wanted his son to marry one of the daughters’ of King George III and establish a dynasty to unite USA and Britain. There is no historical basis to this though. His son John Quincy Adams was also the President of the USA, and of the 1st 12 Presidents, they are the only two not to own slaves. George Washington had decided the title Mr. President, and it was finalized, but John Adams had wanted the title His Elective Majesty or His Mightiness, and His Highness, the President of the USA and the Protestor of their liberties.\n\nThomas Jefferson defeated John Adams to become the 3rd President of the USA. He was the 1st USA Secretary of State under George Washington. He owned 600 slaves, the most of any USA President. He was ambidextrous and could write with both hands. His most famous quote was, ‘we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal”. He was the primary writer of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson was a philologist and knew several languages. After retiring from a two term Presidential tenure, he founded the University of Virginia. He is famous for his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance and is ranked among the top Presidents of the USA. He and John Adams were sometimes rivals, sometimes colleagues, and sometimes friends throughout life, and ironically they died on the same day, 4th of July, 1826, within hours of each other. He was 83, and Adams was 90. The last words of Adams were, “Thomas Jefferson still survives”, but Jefferson had passed away a few hours earlier.\n\nJames Madison was the 4th President of the USA. He is called the father of the Constitution as he played the most important role in the drafting of the Constitution. In this he was majorly helped by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. He also drafted the 1st ten amendments. He was the Secretary of State for 8 years when Jefferson was President. As Secretary of State he played a major role in “the Louisiana purchase”, where USA bought Louisiana from France at a coast of 15 Million dollars. This greatly enhanced the territory of USA and also gave it control of the important port of New Orleans. Madison was a champion of religious liberty, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. He faced a huge challenge in the war of 1812 in which Britain and USA were again at war. He had to flee Washington DC as the British burnt it. The occupation of Washington was for only 26 hours ,and even the White House (then called the Presidential mansion) was burnt. This is the only time that a foreign power occupied the capital. At that time , a coincidental storm/hurricane came and put out the fires. The Britishers had to retreat to their ships. The burning of Washington has been condemned as needless vandalism. President Madison and his military officers returned to Washington and took control again. His popularity increased. Former President Adams stated that Madison acquired more glory, and established more union than his three predecessors put together.\n\nIn the Presidential election of 1816, Madison’s Secretary of State, James Monroe easily won with the support of both Madison and Jefferson. He was the last President of the USA who had served as a leadership role in the American freedom struggle, and hence some call him a founding father as well. The 7th President, Andrew Jackson had also served in the American revolution and in fact was a prisoner of war, making him the only American President to have been a prisoner of war. He however did not have a leadership role.\n\nI enjoyed writing this blog and learnt a lot. Hope you learnt some new and interesting historical facts as well.\n\nThe American President series will continue…….. Part 3 coming up soon, or should it be part 4, if u consider the blog about how the two-tenure for American President came about is Part 1, instead of the Presidents who became President without contesting election ( Both links above, and also the link on Hamilton).\n\nCurrently we are in the middle of the much-awaited Diwali holidays. Soon 31st Dec and 1st January will come. You may have your birthday and your anniversary also in this period or subsequently.\n\nAll these are happy occasions. However, is it that instead of spending your time with your loved ones, you are constantly on your cell phone and for several hours, sending messages to hundreds of “virtual” friends, and reciprocating as well to messages received.\n\nCurrently, the T20 World Cup is going on. New Zealand has just defeated Australia. 2-time Champions West Indies are knocked out of the tournament without qualifying. Virat Kohli has played one of the best T20 International innings of all time and India defeated Pakistan with a last ball win.\n\nThe English football season is looking quite interesting at the moment with Arsenal at the top of the Table, with Manchester City at the second and Tottenham at 3rd, with Chelsea rounding up the top 4.\n\nHowever, is it that your cell phone has prevented you from enjoying all of the above or enjoying your specific interests? If so, you may like to watch the movie, Mr. Harrigan’s phone.\n\nLet us know more about the movie, the plot, the director and the main actors.\n\nThe plot; The genre is categorized as teen-horror, movies where a young main character is engaged in a terrifying battle with a supernatural character.\n\nThe story line is about a young boy named Craig who becomes friends with a rich and reclusive gentleman Mr. Harrigan, who pays him 5 dollars an hour to read to him as his eye-sight is failing. They enjoy all the classics together such as “A tale of two cities” and much more, and in the process enjoy each other’s company while gaining in knowledge as well. The young boy always wants a cell-phone, and the elderly gentleman is against the new gadget (the movie is set in 2003, and Craig gets his 1st phone in 2007)\n\nHowever ultimately the boy is given a cell phone by his father ( an Apple I-Phone, what else), and he wins a lottery from a ticket given to him by his elderly friend, and he gives him an I-Phone cell-phone as well- as a kind of return gift. Their life changes, and instead of reading they start spending more and more time on the cell phone, learning about the different “joys” it can give, such as surfing the net, and getting most things and information for “free”.\n\nMr. Harrigan does ask though, that is it that we are given freebies now, which will make us addicted, and then when the freebies are taken away, will we have cravings? Craig says, that in that one sentence Mr. Harrigan has shown us our future. Mr. Harrigan also says almost wistfully as if with regret, that he almost wishes that he had not given Craig the lottery ticket which led to his being given a return gift of a cell-phone. Earlier their contact was in the reading sessions, but now due to both having cell phones, they are regularly in touch with each other. Even increasingly failing eyesight cannot prevent Mr. Harrigan from checking regular stock updates on his cell-phone, for as Craig tells him, newspaper gives him one day old news while the cell phone gives him live updates.\n\nThere is also a clever scene where Craig is seen as exchanging his cell phone – for an upgrade- a newer I-phone. Haven’t many of us done that regularly in the last 15 years?\n\nAge plays its role, and Mr. Harrigan passes away, leaving behind a considerable fortune to secure Craig’s future. The young boy attends the funeral of his elderly friend, and in an impulsive moment, puts his cell-phone inside Mr. Harrigan’s shirt pocket, when he is laid to rest.\n\nNow a cell phone cannot send calls or messages when it is not charged, right?\n\nHow is it then that Mr. Harrigan can communicate from the grave with Craig? If Craig wants him to do something, that is done as well. The unsaid meaning however is that we are so addicted to cell-phones that we continue to use them even if we are no more. Can Craig get over this addiction? See the movie to know more. It is slow-paced but builds up the narrative well.\n\nThe Director is American movie-maker John Lee Hancock who gave up a law career to make movies. He has a wide repertoire of movies ranging from sports to musicals to historical drama and crime thrillers as well. His sports movie “The rookie” was critically acclaimed and commercially successful apart from being award-winning. His most successful movie was the biographical sports drama “The blind side” starring Sandra Bullock and Quentin Aaron who plays the role of Michael Oher. This movie made with a budget of 29 million dollars, crossed 300 million, and won several awards including an academy award for Sandra Bullock. Lee Hancock made Mr Harrigan’s phone based on the short story by American author Stephen King, who is called by many as the king of horror, supernatural and the unknown.\n\nThe actors; A-List actor Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Harrigan while young teen star Jaeden Martell plays Craig. While Sutherland who is 87, has over 60 years of acting experience, Jaden is just 19, but has already had some impressive releases in his resume, and seems all set for an extended career in Hollywood. Both complement each other beautifully. Joe Tippett plays the role of Craig’s dad, while there are two impressive cameos. One is by British actress (actor) Kirby Howell-Baptiste who plays Ms. Hart, a teacher who likes young Craig and helps him out. The other is by American actor Cyrus Arnold who plays Kenny Yankovich, a bully in Craig’s school, who always wants to beat up Craig and make his life miserable.\n\nIf you want jump scares, blood and gore, and monsters screaming at you, then this is not the movie for you. But if you like supernatural and psychological thrillers where the story and narrative builds up well then I will strongly recommend this movie. It will also give you an idea how easily addicted we can be to our cell phone. Overall it is an excellent movie available on Netflix. Recommended watch from my side.\n\nHon’ble Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud who has been part of several Constitution benches and landmark verdicts over the years has been appointed as the 50th Hon’ble Chief Justice of India (referred to as CJI from now on in this blog). He will take oath on November 9 and will remain as the CJI for 2 years.\n\nJustice Chandrachud will take over from Justice Uday Lalit, who along with Justice Sarv Mittra Sikri, is in an extremely short-list of only six Supreme Court Justices to be elevated directly from practice as senior advocate, with only these two going on to become the CJI.\n\nThe CJI is 6th in the Table of precedence, jointly with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Dignitaries ahead of them are the Hon’ble President, the Vice-President, the PM, Governors of States within their jurisdiction and the former Presidents of India. At 5A is the Deputy Prime Minister, followed by the CJI and the Speaker at number 6. In official functions, seniority protocol is determined by the person sworn in first.\n\nLet us dwell on some interesting information/trivia regarding the august office.\n\nLongest and shortest tenures– Justice Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud was the 17th CJI. He had the longest tenure of over seven years from February 1978 to July 1985. He had sent Sanjay Gandhi to jail in the Kissa Kursi Ka case. The shortest tenure was for only 17 days by the 22nd CJI, Kamal Narain SIngh in 1991. He passed away lust a month back at the grand old age of 94.\n\nCJI from Odisha- There are three, CJI Ranganath Misra, CJI GB Patnaik, and CJI Dipak Misra.\n\nNow let us know some interesting facts about some of our CJI’s.\n\nThe 1st CJI, Justice Hiralal Jesikundas Kenia was from Surat. He was sworn in on 26 January 1950 and remained in office till 6 November 1951. Justice Kenia was from Bombay High Court which has given us the maximum number of CJI’s (9). He was an LLB and LLM from the Government Law College, Mumbai. His nephew Justice Madhukar Hiralal Kenia was the 23rd CJI. As CJI Justice Hiralal Kenia passed away while in office due to suffering a massive heart attack. The 20th CJI, Sabyasachi Mukherji too passed away while in office due to a heart attack.\n\nJustice Mehr Chand Mahajan, the 3rd CJI, was the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir during the reign of Maharaja Hari Singh at the time of integration to India. He was the representative of the Congress party for the Radcliffe Commission.\n\nJustice Bijan Kumar Mukerjea was the 4th CJI. He had been asked by Pandit Nehru to become the 3rd CJI, but he declined saying that he would prefer to resign rather than supercede his senior, Justice Mehr Chand Mahajan.\n\nJustice Sudhi Rajan Das was the 5th CJI. He was one of the 1st four students of Rabindranath Tagore and all his children were named by Guruji. His son-in-law Ashoke Sen later became Union Law Minister.\n\nJustice Kota Subba Rao was the 9th CJI. He is famous for the Golak Nath case ruling that Fundamental rights cannot be amended. He was a consensus Presidential candidate of opposition parties. He lost in the elections to the official candidate, Zakir Hussain.\n\nJustice Mohammed Hidayatullah was the 11th CJI and the 1st Muslim CJI. He later became the Hon’ble Vice-President of India and was also the acting President three times. He is the only person to serve in all the three august offices, the CJI, Vice-President, and the President.\n\nJustice Jayatilal Chhotalal Shah was the 12th CJI. Several years after retirement he headed the Shah Commission which concluded that the decision to impose Emergency was a unilateral one taken by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nJustice AN Ray was the 14th CJI. He was the 1st CJI to supercede three Justices, Justice Shelat, Justice Grover, and Justice Hegde. This was severely criticised and former CJI, Justice Hidayatullah remarked that this could lead to “Judges looking forward to the plumes of Chief Justice”.\n\nAnother CJI who became CJI without being senior most was Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg.\n\nJustice PN Bhagwati was the 17th CJI. He pioneered the concepts of PIL and absolute liability and is therefore regarded as a pioneer of judicial activism. His tenure of Justice and CJI together at over 13 years in the Hon’ble Supreme Court is the longest.\n\nJustice RS Pathak, the 18th CJI was the son of GS Pathak, a former Vice-President of India.\n\nJustice ES Venkataramiah the 19th CJI was the 1st CJI from Karnataka. His daughter, Justice BV Nagaratha, who is from Jesus and Mary College, DU, and CLC, DU, is currently a Justice in the Supreme Court, and due to be the 1st lady CJI of India in 2027.\n\nJustice Ranganath Misra, the 21st CJI, was the 1st CJI from Odisha. He was the 1st CJI to become Rajya Sabha member after retirement as CJI. In this he was the 2nd Supreme Court Justice to do so, the 1st being Justice Baharul Islam. He was also the 1st Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission. His nephew Justice Dipak Misra also became CJI. Another nephew, Shri Pinaki Misra is a several term MP of the BJD. Currently, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, the 46th CJI is also a serving Rajya Sabha Member. These are the only three instances of Supreme Court Justices becoming Rajya Sabha Member. Justice Gogoi’s father was Chief Minister of Assam. He is the 1st CJI from the North-east and the only CJI whose father was a Chief Minister.\n\nJustice Lalit Mohan Sharma was the 24th CJI. His father Shri LN Sinha was the Attorney General of India when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister. His son, Justice Parthasarathy Sharma is currently a Justice in the Patna High Court.\n\nJustice Bhupinder Nath Kirpal was the 31st CJI. He studied in Modern school and St Stephens and represented both his school and college in cricket.\n\nJustice GB Pattanaik, the 33rd CJI is also from Odisha and the 3rd CJI from Odisha. He was a product of Ravenshaw college and MS Law college. After a successful career as an advocate, he had a long and distinguished career of almost 20 years as a Justice of Orissa High Court, Chief Justice of Patna High Court, and then as Supreme Court Justice and the highest post of CJI. As CJI, he started the practice of in-house procedure to deal with allegations against members of the higher judiciary.\n\nJustice VN Khare, the 34th CJI, is the only CJI who has played 1st class cricket. He played Ranji Trophy for Uttar Pradesh.\n\nJustice Sarosh Homi Kapadia, the 35th CJI, was the 1st CJI to be born in Independent India. His father was brought up in an orphanage of Surat. He himself started his career as a class IV employee with Behramjee Jeejeebhoy where his main job was to deliver briefs to lawyers. One such lawyer Ratnakar Sulakhe noted his ability and encouraged him to study and take up law as a career. As they say, the rest is history.\n\nJustice Palanisamy Sathasivam was the 40th CJI. He is the 1st CJI to become the Governor of a state, having succeeded Shiela Dixit as Governor of Kerala.\n\nJustice Dipak Misra the 45th CJI is also from Odisha. He was the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, when a terrorist bomb blast took several lives, and he started the functioning of the High Court within hours, saying that we cannot be seen as bowing down to terrorists. He upheld capital punishment for a member of the 1993 Mumbai blasts. He laid down the National Anthem judgement ordering the playing of the National anthem before the screening of films.\n\nIn just a few days, Justice Chandrachud will become India’s 50th CJI. He will have one of the longest tenures in recent times and will remain in office till 10th November 2024. As many as six Justices will retire in this period and he will be succeeded by Justice Sanjiv Khanna.\n\nHope this article gave you some new and interesting information about the extremely few persons who in the last 72 years have occupied the country’s highest temple of Justice.\n\nAcknowledgements; Wikipedia\n\nPic credit; Hindustan Times.\n\nI present a guest article by my very close family friend, Panchami Manoo Ukil, an educationist, wild-life photographer, multi-faceted talent, who is like a sister to me. The entire article has been reproduced word by word from her FB post, for which her permission has been taken. It presents an amazing incident of empathy, concern and love by the lovable personality, Shri Naveen Patnaik, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha.\n\nRead on. It is amazing. Simply amazing.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY CM SIR\n\n(Please read until the end)\n\nIt is said that a story is never born before its time. Once it’s time has come, nothing can hold it back. For the last four or five years, in the beginning of October, my husband and I have had a conversation on writing this story. However, the conversation never progressed to actually writing it down maybe because its time had not yet come. This year, we have not spoken about it, but the story has decided that it is ready to be told.\n\nDecember 1997, almost twenty five years ago, I was in my eighth month of pregnancy and I was to go to Bhubaneswar for delivery. My father had come to Delhi on work and I was to travel back with him. Though I was all packed and ready to go, I had a sleepless night, completely distraught and depressed. There was a reason. A beagle puppy.\n\nOne Sunday morning in September, we heard the whining of a dog close by. From the direction of the sound, I understood that it came from the house just across ours. I opened our front door and looked out to see a puppy chained to the handrail of the external staircase that led into the flat. It was a tiny male puppy, scared, maybe hungry and utterly traumatised. It looked like a Labrador to me. Beside it was a halved shell of coconut containing water and another with some food that seemed like curd rice. I climbed up the staircase, removed the collar from the pup and picked it up. It was shivering with fright and simply snuggled into my neck. I took it home and fed it with some warm milk. The puppy lapped up the milk and then curled into my lap and fell asleep in a minute. In the meanwhile my husband had gone up to the flat and rung the doorbell. After almost five minutes, an elderly gentleman opened the door, looking somewhat grumpy. Perhaps the bell had woken him up from sleep. My husband told him that their puppy had been crying since a long time. The gentleman was unperturbed and peered out of the door trying to look at the puppy. My husband explained to him that since the puppy had been crying for a very long time, we had unchained him and taken him home. He had been fed and was sleeping. In the meantime, the lady of the house had come out. Hearing that the puppy was at our home, she seemed a bit disturbed, but my husband calmed her saying that we would be bringing the puppy back to them as soon as he woke up. She invited my husband to step in for a cup of tea. Over tea, my husband learnt that the elderly couple had been gifted the puppy by their son and daughter-in-law. The puppy had travelled by air all the way from Chennai and had been picked up from the airport by the couple. These were obviously first time pet parents, so they appeared quite baffled. The puppy had been indoors at night and had soiled the floor. The lady had felt so harassed that she had put him out early in the morning and was deeply regretting the entry of the puppy into their lives, but they did not wish to hurt the sentiments of their children by asking for it to be sent back.\n\nMy husband returned home and updated me with these details. After a while, much against my wishes, we took the puppy back to its home. The lady was quite aghast to see that I was letting the puppy lick my face. The puppy was clinging to me and refusing to let go. With great difficulty I put it down and tied the collar and leash back around its neck. The lady told me to chain it outside again. I requested her to allow it to remain indoors but she vehemently denied, saying that there was no one to clean up the soiled floors. Gently, I gave her a lesson on toilet training the puppy but she said she had neither the energy nor the patience. Before I knew it, I had blurted out saying that if it was okay with them, then my husband and I would walk the puppy three to four times a day and enable it to be toilet-trained. The couple was thrilled to hear this. I said to them that the only condition was that the puppy would remain inside the house. They agreed.\n\nThat very evening onwards, my husband and I took turns to walk the puppy. We would feed it with Cerelac, chicken and milk after the walks, his owners quite relieved over the fact that we were taking care of its feeding as well. Over a few days the puppy was almost toilet-trained. It began to whine to indicate that it needed to go out. The driver or the part time house help of the owners would then take it for a walk. We had explained to the owners exactly what diet was to be given to the pup and had also introduced them to a vet. At night, however, my husband would take it for a walk everyday and bring him to our home for a few minutes before taking him back home. The pup was named Toffee, and, as it turned out, it was a mixed breed of Labrador and Beagle. With my advancing pregnancy, I would notice the puppy’s affinity towards snuggling into my belly. Sometimes it would put its ear to my stomach and then cock its head from side to side. It was strangely emotional for us, as if Toffee had already found a way to communicate with our child.\n\nHowever, after a few days, we noticed that the puppy was again tied outside on the stairs during the day. The elderly lady could not trust leaving the puppy inside when she would go out, fearing that he might chew up the furniture or spill water. I was completely distraught, the state of hormones of impending motherhood already playing havoc with my emotions. We went and told the lady that we were willing to keep the pup with us when she went out. She was happy to hear this but said that the moment she returned she would take it back home. This became a regular routine with Toffee now spending more time with us than in his own home. His owners were also more relaxed with this arrangement of an informal joint ownership.\n\nSo, the night before I was to leave for Bhubaneswar, I suddenly felt panicky at the thought of leaving Toffee behind. I had seen the clear disinterest in his owners who were simply tolerating his presence in their lives keeping the sentiments of their children in mind, and, also because we had chipped in to a large extent in taking care of the dog. My husband and I had discussed the idea of me taking Toffee away to Bhubaneswar though we knew that his owners might never agree to this if we asked them. I was crying all through the night which got my husband extremely worried. In the morning, we found Toffee tied outside on the stairs once again which proved to be the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back. I decided that I would be taking the dog home with me. I had no idea how I would do that but I had to do it. We called up the vet who guided us on how I could carry the pup in the airplane cabin. With my own weight and bulk of pregnancy, I wondered for a moment how I’d carry a seven kilo puppy. But I was determined. We went out and bought a zipped bag on which we made holes. When we returned home, the pup was still tied outside. We rang the bell but there was no response. I simply untied the pup and brought it with me. We fed it and then put it inside the bag to see if it fitted inside comfortably. It was perfect. We gave the pup its first dose of sedation that had been prescribed by the vet and left for the airport.\n\nGetting off at the airport, I picked up the bag and strode inside with supreme confidence. My husband was in a state of anxiety as he saw me off. I walked upto the check-in counter and said that I needed to buy a ticket for my pet puppy. The manager at the counter did not bat an eyelid. The bag with the dog was weighed and I was given a bill of Rupees Nine Hundred. The ticket was done. At the security check, I was asked to open the bag and show the pup. The pup was fast asleep and I was allowed to pass. I’m sure most of the people around must have been aghast at the sight of a heavily pregnant woman carrying a large bag, huffing and puffing, looking absolutely hassled. Anyway, after a while I saw my father walking into the boarding area with a few other colleagues. I went upto him and told him about the pup in the bag. The smile on his face vanished. I have perhaps never seen him more livid than what he was at that moment. After giving me a mouthful on even daring to do something like that, he said to me that I was on my own on this and that I should not be expecting any help from him at all. I decided that having come this far, I would not relent to any pressure. Toffee the puppy had woken up by now and was moving inside the bag. I opened the bag and ruffled his ears. He looked at me sleepily and went back to sleep.\n\nWhen boarding was announced, I went ahead in the queue, showing both the tickets. I got off the bus, carrying the bag, the pup was absolutely still. I showed both the tickets and climbed the stairs into the airplane. At the entrance to the aircraft, the airhostess asked me what was inside the bag. I told her it was my puppy and that I had a ticket for him. She told me that the bulky bag did not seem to be carrying a puppy. I opened it and showed it to her, saying that it was a Labrador pup. She said it was big enough to qualify as a dog and that it was the captains’s prerogative to allow its presence inside the cabin. She called the captain out. The captain was in no mood to allow the pup to remain inside the cabin. He was sceptical about him remaining calm in case of turbulence and said that I should get off the aircraft. I told him that I had no choice now but to travel with the pup in my present state as my husband had already left the airport after I had gone through security check. I expressed deep helplessness, literally begging him to allow me to travel, assuring him that the pup had been sedated well and would not cause any problem whatsoever. Most importantly, the bag was zipped up so there was no way he could jump out. Finally the captain agreed on letting me in as we were causing a jam at the entrance to the cabin. He told the air hostess to allow me to place the bag at my feet.\n\nAs I walked into the aisle, I saw Shri Naveen Patnaik, Member of Parliament, in the first seat on the first row. I walked past, a tad embarrassed that so many people were witness to the discomforting state that I was in. I settled into my seat in the third row, not daring to look at my father who was in the second row with his colleagues. I was imagining his fury and embarrassment at the chaos I had created. I was however relieved that finally we were on our way. A minute later, the air hostess came to tell me that the first seat in the first row had been vacated by Shri Naveen Patnaik to accommodate me so that I could sit comfortably with adequate leg space for the bag. He had voluntarily moved to the last row. I was stunned and overwhelmed. Busy in settling into my seat, I had not seen the tall man walk by to the last row. I told the air hostess that I would like to go and thank the Hon’ble MP for his extreme kindness but she said that there was no way they would allow me to leave the puppy bag alone. She said I could thank him after we had landed. As I walked to the first row, I whispered to my father about what had just transpired. My father being my father told me – look at the inconvenience you have created!\n\nAfter all the drama of the day, the journey was uneventful as Toffee the puppy slept throughout the flight. My mind however was focused on the empathy of the leader who had understood my state of distress. Living in Delhi, we hardly had any connect with Odisha politics and I barely new anything beyond the fact that Naveen Patnaik had taken over the mantle from his father. As soon as we landed, I was desperate to rush to the Hon’ble MP and thank him. Those days passengers would exit from the front as well as from the rear. I asked the airhostess if Mr. Patnaik was still seated. She said that he had already exited through the rear door of the aircraft. I was the last one to get off the bus with my dog in the bag. Stepping into the bus I looked around but Mr. Naveen Patnaik was obviously not there. He would have boarded an earlier bus. Getting off, I found my sister waiting for me. I handed over the puppy to her and asked her if she had seen Naveen Patnaik. She said that she had seen him going out. I told her the entire story. My father said that I could write a letter of thanks or meet him sometime later to thank him. Over the years, neither the letter nor the meeting happened. Over the years, as a family, we have reminisced about this incident time and again. Toffee lived for fourteen years in Bhubaneswar, adored and cared for in my parents home. In the meantime, Shri Naveen Patnaik had become Chief Minister of Odisha.\n\nTwo decades later, when I did get the opportunity to meet the Hon’ble Chief Minister on several occasions, it was no longer possible to engage in a personal conversation with him. Each time I have wanted to remind him about his huge act of kindness but somehow I have held back. It is said that great men never hang on to their acts of generosity which is why I was apprehensive that he would obviously have no memory of something that had transpired ages ago. He has expressed childish enthusiasm when I explained to him about the Peregrine Falcon being the fastest creature on earth when it swoops to pick up a prey, he chipped in with the scientific name of Palash when I presented him with a Palash sapling, requesting him to launch “Mission Palash”, he narrated the story of a famous photograph taken on Children’s Day in which he was seen seated on Pandit Nehru’s lap, he has indulged the children of our school with the best chocolates and affection, and, of course, very kindly inaugurated our new school campus.\n\nAbout three years ago, I was seated behind the Hon’ble Chief Minister in the aircraft. All through the journey, I saw him watching video clips of his pets, two playful beagles whose antics brought gentle smiles onto the face of the CM as he watched. In the last twenty-three years of his Chief Ministership, reams and reams of commentaries and opinions have been written about Shri Naveen Patnaik’s personality and governance. As someone who has been personally impacted by his one act of kindness twenty-five years ago, I firmly believe that nothing about Naveen Patnaik is fake. His charm, his enigma, his stature and his governance are his own, honest and original, and hence so deeply appealing to the masses. Most of all, his empathy is real. Small wonder then that he is the longest serving Chief Minister as well as the No. 1 Chief Minister in the largest democracy of the world.\n\nThank you Hon’ble Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik Sir for being a pillar of empathy and making it the cornerstone of all your programmes for your family of four and a half crore Odias. You are loved and cherished beyond words.\n\nHappy Happy Birthday to you our dearest CM Sir!\n\n#NaveenPatnaik\n\n#CMOOdisha\n\n#empathymatters\n\n#leadership\n\nThe 1st President of the Congress party in 1885 was WC Bannerjee. Many stalwarts such as Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Annie Besant, Abul Kalam Azad, Vallabhbhai Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose, and Rajendra Prasad have been Congress President. Mahatma Gandhi too has been Congress President for one year- in 1924.\n\nFrom the Nehru family, Motilal Nehru, Vijaylakshmi Pandit, and Jawalarlal Nehru have been Congress Presidents. Subsequently Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, and Rahul Gandhi have been Congress Presidents as well. In the entire history of the Congress party, Smt. Sonia Gandhi is the President for the longest tenure. She has been President for as much as 20 years.\n\nWe will now have a non Nehru-Gandhi family member after 23 years with either Mallikarjuna Kharge or Shashi Tharoor becoming the President of the Congress Party, and becoming only the 13th non-family President after Independence.\n\nIn this article I take a look at the other 12. I have consciously chosen after Independence period since for the majority period from 1985 to 1933, the tenure of the President was only one year.\n\nBhogarajju Pattabhi Sitarammaya was the 1st Congress President after Independence. He was a Doctor who gave up his practice for public service, Before independence he has contested for Congress Presidency but he lost to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the 1939 Tripuri session and Mahatma Gandhi had said it was his defeat. Leading CWC Members including Sardar Patel resigned, which forced Netaji to resign and later quit the Congress. Pattabhi Sitarammaya was the first Governor of Andhra Pradesh and he was also the founder of Andhra Bank (recently merged with Union Bank and Corporation Bank).In 1948 the candidate of Pandit Nehru was Acharya JB Kripalini and he lost to Pattabhi Sitaramayya.\n\nThe next President of the Congress was Purushottam Das Tandon who was a lawyer who gave up his law practice to become a Professor of Hindi and join public service. He was given the title of Rajarishi by Mahatma Gandhi. He had the support of Sardar Patel and he defeated Jawaharlal Nehru’s candidate, Acharya JB Kripalini to become party President. However subsequently Sardar Patel passed away and Shri Tandon resigned from the party President post due to differences with Pandit Nehru. He was replaced as Party President by Pandit Nehru himself.\n\nUN Dhebar was the next Non Nehru-Gandhi President. He too gave up legal practice for public service. He was Chief Minister of Saurashtra State for 6 years before becoming Congress President for 5 years. He had led the Rajkot Satyagraha. He had various other prestigious assignments such as Lok Sabha member, Chairman of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission , and Chairman of Khadi and Village Industries Commission.\n\nNeelam Sanjeeva Reddy too was President of Congress. In his illustrious career, he has been CM of Andhra Pradesh, two-time Speaker of Lok Sabha, Union Minister, and finally became the Hon’ble President of India.\n\nK Kamaraj was popularly known as Kamarajar. He was a 3 term Chief Minister of Madras province and he resigned and asked other powerful Chief Ministers to resign as well to devote their time and energy to strengthening the Congress Party. Following his call, 6 CM’s and 6 Union Ministers resigned to work in the party organisation. Kamaraj as Congress President could have staked a claim to Prime Ministership but instead proposed the name of Lal Bahadur Shastri. He also played a role in Indira Gandhi becoming Prime Minister and hence he earned the name of Kingmaker.\n\nS Nijalingappa was a two-term Chief Minister of Karnataka. In fact he was the 1st CM of Karnataka as well and was unanimously selected due to his efforts for the unification of Karnataka State. For this he is called the “Maker of modern Karnataka”. He was the last President of the undivided Congress. Thereafter the party split and was divided into Congress(0) comprising of older leaders like Morarji Desai, Nijalingappa himself, Kamaraj, and Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, and the Congress (R) led by Indira Gandhi. After the split, he retired from politics.\n\nJagajivan Ram was popularly known as Babuji. He was the youngest minister in Pandit Nehru’s interim Government in 1946, and he was the 1st Labour Minister of India. He has a record of more than 30 years as a Union Minister. He was also Deputy Prime Minister of India in the Morarji Desai ministry. Important contributions by him are that he was Defence Minister at the time of the 1971 triumph, and he was also Agriculture Minister at the time of the Green revolution.\n\nShankar Dayal Sharma had an illustrious career culminating in the highest post of Hon’ble President of India. Before assuming this august office, he was the Hon’ble Vice-President, He was Chief Minister of Bhopal State fo4 4 years. He was also Union Minister for around 14 years. He also served as Governor of Punjab, AP and Maharashtra. He was originally a lawyer by profession and was educated at both Cambridge and Harvard. Reportedly he was the 1st choice to be Prime Minister in 1991 but refused due to advaced age and ill-health. However the next year he became the Hon’ble President of India.\n\nDevkanta Barooah was the 1st and only Assamese to be Congress President. He was the Congress President at the time of the Emergency and is infamous for his sycophantic statement, “India is Indira, Indira is India”.\n\nKasu Brahmananda Reddy was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh for seven years and will always be remembered for his efforts in encouraging industry and his contribution to making Hyderabad a mega city. As Congress President, he expelled Indira Gandhi from the party. He had the support of YB Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, and Swaran Singh. However Indira Gandhi made a triumphant return and also won the elections in 1980 to return as Prime Minister. During this time the Congress (I) was formed.\n\nPV Narasimha Rao, who will always be remembered as the father of economic reforms is one of the greatest sons of India. As Prime Minister, he led India successfully in troubled times. Later, Prime Minister Vajpayee conducted the nuclear tests, and as outgoing PM, PV Narasimha Rao had briefed him on India’s readiness for this history-changing event.\n\nSitaram Kesri who was the treasurer of the Congress party for more than a decade was the last Congress President before Sonia Gandhi became President for 20 of the next 23 years, with Rahul Gandhi being the President for the other 3 years. Sitaram Kesri was also Union Minister in the Governments of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and PV Narasimha Rao. Kesri was the Congress President who withdrew support to the HD Deve Gowda government and he then gave support to the Inder Gujral Government. He defeated Sharad Pawar and Rajesh Pilot in the election.\n\nWho will the next Congress President be?. The last time the elctions were held, which was in 2000, Sonia Gandhi had bagged 7400 votes while Jitendra Prasad had received just 74 votes. Will the current elections be similarly one-sided or will there be an even contest. We will know soon.\n\nMax Verstappen is just 25, and a double world champion already. In Formula-1 racing, we have seen inspirational legends. Some names which readily come to mind are Juan Michael Fangio, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Nigell Mansell, Sebastian Vettell, Michael Schumacher, and Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen is the latest to join this august list.\n\nAt the Italian Grand Prix, 2023, the young racer won , and created history by winning his tenth race in a row, thereby creating history. This has never been done in F1 history and Max broke the record of Vettel who had won nine races in a row. He has now won all races this season since the Miami Grand Prix in May, 2023. The 2-time World Champion is all set for a third world championship. It is 2 and counting now, and it will become 3 and counting.\n\nLet us have a look at some of the spectacular achievements of his young career so far and what makes him special.\n\nThe nationality of Max is Belgian-Dutch, and he is a racer with Red Bull. His father Jos Verstappen was a Formula 1 driver as well while his mother Sophie Kumpen was an accomplished Kart champion. Max, at 17 years, 166 days competed at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, thereby becoming the youngest racer in the Formula-1 circuit. In 2025 at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he became the youngest driver to win points, once again before 18. In fact he was a formula 1 racer before getting a road driving license when he turned 18. He competes under the Dutch flag, since, as he said he grew up more in Netherlands than in Belgium.\n\nAt 18, on debut for Red Bull racing, he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest ever Formula-1 race winner. In the same race he set two other formula 1 records, namely youngest to have a podium finish, and the youngest driver to lead a lap. The very next year, at 19, he became the youngest driver to set fastest lap, which was at the Brazilian Grand Prix. He quickly emerged as a very consistent racer and finished 4th, 3rd and 3rd in the 2018, 2019, and 2020. In 2021, he defeated 7-time Champion Lewis Hamilton to become World Champion. It was a winner take all situation with Max winning his 1st World Championship and preventing Hamilton from winning his 8th. He had 18 podium finishes in 2021 which is also an F1 record. An ecstatic Red Bull announced (in March 2022) that he has agreed to be with them (at least) till the end of the 2028 season.\n\nMax immediately reciprocated the confidence shown in him. In 2022, in a season of almost complete domination, he became World Champion with as many as 4 races to go. The 2022 World Championship is in fact even more creditable than the 2021 one since all drivers started equally due to the radical rules introduced, and with a cap on investment/spending on the car, mainly the engines and the tyres. Further there was an emphasis to encourage “closer racing” which essentially means more possible overtakes, and hence skill of the driver is even more relevant now.\n\nIf last hear he became world champion with four races to go, this year he may do so with six races remaining.\n\nLets list some of the world champion’s unreal achievements;\n\nHe is two times world champion.\n\nHe is just the 17th racer in history to win more than one world championship. There are just 6 racers with 4 or more world championships. Schumacher and Hamilton are joint 1st with 7 each. Next is Fangio with 5, while Prost, Vettel and Mansell round off the top 5 with 4 championships each. In all probability, Verstappen will join this elite list of 6.\n\nVettel and Schumacher had the record of 13 wins in a season. Max celebrated his 2nd World Championship win by winning the US Grand Prix which gave him his 13th win of the season, and he emphatically announced, “I have three races to go to win just one and have my own record”. He indeed ended with 15 wins in the 2022 season and owns his own record. Incredibly so, it is possible he may break it this year itself since he has won 12 out of 14 races, and needs 4 more wins from the next 9, with 2023 having 23 races.\n\nThe Mexico Grand Prix is accepted as one of the most technical and difficult races. He has won 4 out of the 6 so far, with Hamilton winning the other 2. The 2022 win was from pole position, and only Hamilton had won from pole in 2017.\n\nWhat about maximum races won? Hamilton is at the top with 103 wins. He is the only racer to have more than 100 wins. Next is Schumacher with 91, and he is followed by Vettel with 53, Prost with 51, and Max with 47. This season he has overtaken Senna who has won 41 races. It seems just a matter of time before he overtakes Prost and Vettel as well.\n\nWhat next? Maximum times world Champion is of course a long way to go, with Schumacher and Hamilton winning 7 times each. Yet, Max is just 25, and can certainly make a run for it. Ralf Schumacher sounds a cautionary note that while Max certainly has the ability, in Formula 1 there are lots of factors beyond the drivers influence and hence one should wait and watch. However many including former World Champion Jenson Button have called him the fastest driver of all time. Niki Lauda described him as the talent of the century. Top Formula 1 journalists say he drives from intuition, which comes from years of training and preparation, and this driving on intuition makes it impossible for others to compete with him. Continuation of an already glorious career seems certain.\n\nCongrats once again Max Verstappen and looking forward to follow your spectacular career with keen interest.\n\nEvery tennis player has two dreams, to be the number 1 player in the world, and to be a Grand Slam Champion. Once these dreams are achieved, other dreams follow- such as, to win at least one Grand Slam each at all the four Grand Slam tournaments, winning as many ATP Masters tournaments as possible, to maximize one’s stay at the top, and so on.\n\nThe 1st player to be the ATP Number 1 ranked player was Ilie Nastase and the current Number 1 is Carlos Alcaraz. The young Spaniard became just the 28th player to be ranked World Number 1 in the last 48 years.\n\nAlcaraz got both the dreams in the same tournament. He became a Grand Slam Champion and he also became the world number 1 by defeating Casper Ruud to win the 2022 US Open. Interestingly, it was a winner takes all situation and for Ruud it would have been his 1st Grand Slam as well and he would have become world number 1 as well. However, it was the young Spaniard who emerged the creditable winner. He became the youngest winner of the US Open since the great Pete Sampras in 1990. He also became the youngest player to win any Grand Slam title since Rafa Nadal won the French Open in 2005.\n\nCarlos replaced Medvedev as the world number 1. Since February 1, 2004, only members of the big 4, namely Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak, and Andy Murray had been world Number 1. For almost 17 years this situation continued. Medvedev had becomes the 1st since Andy Roddick to be a non-Big-4 player to be ranked number 1. Roddick was World Number 1 for 13 weeks, and since then Novak, Federer, Nadal, and Murray have been World Number 1 for 361, 310, 209, and 41 respectively.\n\nMedvedev joined an illustrious list and now Carlos Alcaraz follows him.\n\nNow that Carlos has reached the summit of the world rankings, he would like to stay for a long time. Both Medvedev and Novak will be keen to get it back, and Nadal, who now leads the Number of Grand Slams race, will be also looking at becoming world number 1 again.\n\nCarlos after becoming world number 1 lost his 1st match after that, which was to the talented David Goffin. He had entered the Astana ATP 500 tournament and so have Novak, Medvedev, and Tsitsipas. Carlos losing to Goffin means we cannot see him take on Medvedev or Novak here. That apart, we are surely going to see some interesting tennis at Astana and later in the year as well, with two more ATP 500 tournaments in Vienna and Basel comin up with the Rolex Paris Masters to follow before the year end clash of the top 8 at Turin. Novak is making a late bid to make it to Turin as well and it will be interesting to see who will be year-end world number 1, an achievement which tennis players deeply cherish.\n\nLet us have a look at certain statistical aspects associated with the World Number 1 ranking.\n\nMaximum Number of weeks; Novak Djokovic is at the top, with as many as 373 weeks at the top. This is astounding, especially since due to COVID-19, rankings were frozen for as many as 22 weeks. The only other player to be ranked Number 1 for more than 300 weeks is Roger Federer, who has been Number 1 for 310 weeks. Four players have crossed 200 weeks, and they are Pete Sampras (286), Ivan Lendl (270), Jimmy Connors (260), and Rafael Nadal (209).\n\nMinimum Number of Weeks; At the other end of the spectrum is Pat Rafter, who has been Number 1 for just one week.\n\nYear-end Number 1. Novak Djokovic heads the list. he has been year-end number one for as many as seven times. He is followed by Pete Sampras who has achieved the feat 6 times. Connors, Federer, and Nadal duo have been year-end number 1 as many as 5 times each.\n\nConsecutive year-end Number 1; Sampras heads the list. He was year-end Number 1 for six consecutive years.\n\nConsecutive weeks at Number 1. Roger Federer heads the list. He was number 1 for an astonishing consecutive 237 weeks.\n\nOldest and Youngest Number 1; The oldest is Federer. He was world number 1 when he was 36 years and 10 months. The youngest world Number 1 was Leyton Hewitt who was just 20 years and 8 months when he became Number 1. This record is now broken, with Carlos Alcaraz becoming the youngest Number 1 at 19 years and 4 months.\n\nOldest and Youngest Year-End Number 1. Novak is the oldest year-end Number 1, at 34 years 7 months. Leyton Hewitt was the youngest, at 20 years and 9 months. Carlos will be chasing this record this year.\n\nNumber one without having won a Grand Slam– There are two players on the list, Ivan Lendl and Marcelo Rios. Lendl who is referred to as “Father of the modern game” and also as “father of the inside-out forehand” went on to win 8 Grand Slam titles. Rios remains the only player to be world number 1, without winning a Grand Slam title.\n\nLongest span between 1st time Number 1, and last time Number 1; Federer has this record. He first became Number 1 on 2nd February 2004, and he was Number 1 also on June 18, 2018.\n\nLongest span between 1st-time year-end Number 1, and last-time year-end Number 1; Nadal was year-end Number 1 in 2008, and also in 2019. Novak was year-end Number 1 for the 1st time in 2011, and he will equal Nadal’s record if he is year-end number 1 in 2022.\n\nMaximum times Number 1; John Mcenroe has this unique record. He has been world number 1 for 14 times. He and Borg swapped the number 1 ranking thrice each, and thereafter Mcenroe, Connors, and Lendl kept on swapping the number 1 ranking. Ultimately Mcenroe held it 14 times, while Connors and Lendl held it for 9 and 8 times respectively. Nadal too has held it 8 times, while Sampras is next to Mcenroe, having been Number 1 for 11 times. The other players who were Number 1 in during the Sampras era were Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Thomas Muster, Marcelo Rios, Carlos Moya, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, and Pat Rafter\n\nWeeks by decade; Nadal is the only player to be world number 1 in three decades, from 2000-2009, 2010-2019, and 2020 onwards. This record may stand the test of time.\n\nWorld Number 1 with maximum ATP Points; At one stage, Novak was world number 1 with as many as 16950 ATP points. That shows how clinically he was winning everything at that point of time- over an extended period.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz is the new number 1, and a worthy one at that. He becomes just the 4th Spaniard to become world number 1, after Carlos Moya, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Rafael Nadal.\n\nWhat a meteoric rise it has been. Just 6 months back, he entered the top 10 in the world for the 1st time, and on the exact date that Nadal had done so in 2005. He was just the 20th teen to crack the top10, and 12 had gone on to become world number 1. Carlos became the 13th. In his young career so far he has already chalked many milestones. He became the youngest ever Miami winner, replacing none other than Novak Djokovic. He is the youngest ever player to win a match at the Madrid Open, replacing none other than Rafa Nadal. He is the fastest to win 50 matches on the tour, and none of the 27 world number 1’s before him reached this milestone faster. He won his 50th match in just his 70th match, while Djokovic, Nadal, and Federer had reached the milestone in 79, 81, and 97 matches respectively.\n\nAfter he won Miami, he said, “I’d like to be world number 1, a Grand Slam champion, win Olympic medals. I dream big”\n\nWell 2 of that he has already achieved, less than 6 months after voicing the same. Amazing.\n\nCongrats Carlos once again. Looking forward to many more Grand Slam wins from you."
