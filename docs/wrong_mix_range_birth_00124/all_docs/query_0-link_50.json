        "meta_description": "This essay examines the manifestation of Realism within the Constantinople Armenian intellectual milieu of the 1880s by delving into the hitherto untested waters of Ottoman visual art production and art criticism. An image and kindred text are closely read and held to mirror major, yet interrelated, concerns of the Constantinople Armenian Realist Generation (Պոլսահայ Իրապաշտ Սերունդ) – the precarious socio-economic and political situation in Ottoman Armenia and the phenomenon of bantkhdoutioun (պանդխտութիւն), the large scale movement of provincial migrant workers from Ottoman Armenia to the imperial capital – and, to reflect upon the manner and avenues of articulation of these concerns under conditions of autocratic rule and increasingly tightening censorship. The essay proposes that an artist’s brush was often able to evade the censor’s scalpel more effectively than the pen, to convey meaning and project allegorical content under the guise of an ethnographic cloak. By extensively drawing upon a wealth of hitherto unutilized Ottoman Armenian sources, the re-introduction and inclusion of diverse silenced voices to complicate the art historiography of the Ottoman Empire is advocated. Through the introduction of some of these voices, this essay hopes to contribute to efforts towards more empirically and methodologically sound, nuanced and inclusive, Ottoman art histories.",

        "text": "2Since its publication by Macler, the sole reference to the painting has been art historian Shahen Khachatryan’s following passing remarks:\n\n13 Sh. Khachatryan, 1991, p. 27.\n\nThe thematic canvas Armenian Wedding in Moush is one of Nichanian’s noteworthy works, which has been reprinted in F[rederic] Macler’s 1917 book France and Armenia Through Art and History. This picture, that adheres to classical fine art principles and has a simple structure, represents an Armenian hearth, with participants of wedding celebrations. On the canvas ancient folk traditions have received a live embodiment. Alongside the depicted persons’ natural movements, the viewer’s attention is captured by their national costume and daily (կենցաղի) objects. The author lives their beauty and has strived to accentuate them. […] The expression (բացահայտում) of national characteristics and refined, pure human emotions are the enticing values of Nichanian’s canvasses.\n\n(Re)Introducing the Artist: Garabed Nichanian in Constantinople\n\n8Our knowledge of Nichanian, a once important but now forgotten artist, is at best fragmentary. Yet, his renown in 1890 Constantinople becomes instantly apparent in the opening paragraph of Pashalian’s A Provincial Wedding:\n\n35 Ottoman honorific.\n\n36 Costikian Frères, Commissionaires, were based at “Bazar Oriental Han, 29, S”. R. Cervati, 1891, p. (...)\n\n37 Taparig, Arevelk, no. 1960, 28 July 1890.\n\nIn recent days we had the opportunity to view a painting that presents an Armenian provincial wedding, the work of the well-known painter Garabed Efendi Nichanian, [which is on display] in one of the rooms at the Gosdigian (Կոստիկեան) [B]rothers in the Oriental Bazaar in Bolis . I saw that painting with admiration [wonderment], with an enjoyment equally of the eye and the heart, and I consider it my duty to render others partakers in the boundless satisfaction and a kind of national [ազգային] pride that Nichanian Efendi’s beautiful talent inspires in us.\n\n67 Hraztan, Arevelk, no. 873, 29 Nov. 1886.\n\nWhat can a passionate (խանդ ունեցող) man not accomplish if every day he is alongside (առընթեր է) a teacher such as Domenico Morelli, whom a French artist has called “the second [C]reator of nature”. On the one hand, the young Armenian drew and studied anatomy (անդամազննութիւն) and on the other, sciences, fed his mind (պարարէր իւր միտքը) and heart with the study of the masterpieces of the new and old schools. In Rome and in Napoli the youth cohabits (կենակցի) with the masterpieces of Michelangelo, Rafael, Tiziano. He immerses [himself] into Gerome’s, Meissonier’s and Cabanel’s masterpieces. Every thing inspires him, the memorials (յիշատակարանները), the sky, nature, Italian beauty. But his religion – the only adherence with which it is possible to be something in this world – is the need to stay away from being a copyist, but always to study the person and nature and create. To be a creator and not a copier.\n\n90 Arevelk, no. 873, 29 Nov. 1886.\n\n[W]e [Nichanian and I] rendezvous for the day when he will exhibit in public a wedding with Armenian types, Armenian customs[,] towards the realization of which he contemplates, thinks, toils and dreams.\n\n17The above text provides a key to Nichanian’s initial intentions, thoughts and conceptualisation for the Wedding. As importantly it confirms Nichanian’s proximity to the vanguards of Ottoman Armenian Realism, evoking a sense of intellectual affinity between them. After all, his return to Constantinople had coincided with the Realist turn of Constantinople Armenian literary, social and intellectual thought, the historical moment when Realism established its dominance over the city’s Armenian cultural milieu for the next decade.\n\nReading Levon Pashalian’s A Provincial Wedding\n\n98 Pashalian appears to have miscounted. Unless there is another figure, visible in the actual paintin (...)\n\n99 Translated from the Turkish nağara çekmek. I am grateful to Ani Baladian for the explanation.\n\n100 Taparig, Arevelk, no. 1960, 28 July 1890.\n\nThis is a monumental painting, [of] two metres width and one and a half metres height, [presenting a scene from] a provincial wedding where the priest, bride and groom, the best man, the village headman, relatives and friends, in total [a party of] eighteen souls , are returning from church. On the first plane of the painting appears the conductor of the wedding, then the groom wearing a chasuble and bible in hand. Behind him the godfather [best man], holding a spear with an apple impaled at its point, and together the brother, the bride and the two sisters of the bride, the bride’s face covered with an Armenian veil, while one sister’s face is uncovered, as she is of more advanced years. The peasant priest in a white beard advances, worry beads in hand and behind him [stand] two strong young lads playing the drum, and two other [men] who are dancing, one crying out an exclamation of joy [նաղարա քաշել]. The bride’s father is also present, as is a neighbour with her baby in her arms. The picture presents a spacious hall, with straw mats covering the floor. Two strings of onions are hanging from the ceiling, [there is] a jug and two cups on a shelf. In the distance the dome of the church is visible surrounded by a blue expanse [of sky], while in the distance appears the city with its castle.\n\n29Aside from an easy recourse to such ethnographic material, Nichanian, in his quest for models for the Wedding would turn to the Hayasdantsi bantoukhds, the men and women who represented the face of Ottoman Armenia on the streets of the imperial capital. Pashalian explains:\n\n141 Taparig, Arevelk, no. 1960, 28 July 1890.\n\nIn order to accurately execute the true to type character of those provincial faces, to reproduce with perfect truthfulness the expressiveness of all the items of clothing, of all the costumes, of all the wedding items and furniture, with their local colour, Nichanian Efendi has ungrudgingly taken upon himself [to suffer] all the troubles [expected of] an artist of conscience, searching every corner of our capital to seek out all the types that could best suit his purpose, defeating these provincials’ naturally inborn untrustworthiness and instinctual unwillingness by all means, by convincing and beseeching the provincial women to come and sit opposite him [to pose] for hours to serve as models. And yet, the result has amply rewarded all his labours. For the artist, the excessive fatigue and the endured anxieties, the trials of inspiration and execution [have all paid off, for] the work, his creation, is there before him, gay and joyful, and already all [the artist’s] toil has been forgotten.\n\n30Beyond providing much information of the urban artist’s working methods this text is also a particularly revealing document of the dissonant and often contradictory attitudes towards rural provincials among urban intellectuals of the Constantinople Realist generation. Nichanian’s selection of candidates for the purpose of sketching would have reaffirmed his own preconceived notions of what or who constituted a suitable Hayasdantsi type. Pashalian’s, and Nichanian’s, essentialisation of those from the periphery, involving the simultaneous idealisation and romanticisation of perceived virtues on the one hand and the deploring of “innate” or “instinctual” defects on the other, all within the confines of a single article, or paragraph even, provides a fascinating picture of the orientalisation and othering of their provincial fellow-Armenian from the Ottoman East. Consider, for example, the shift in Pashalian’s tone when he proceeds to enumerate the Hayasdantsis’ virtues:\n\n142 Ibid.\n\nI observe the bride and her sisters first. A respectable, modest, blush has spread upon the bride’s face, her eyes glancing downwards. Upon her broad face is spread an innocent sinless purity. Beside her, an older woman’s face is visible in its entirety, the lines upon her face looser and with the sweetness of a delicious fruit, in her dull glaucous eyes modesty and strength intertwined. […] And each face possesses its own unique character and characteristic. The youth are vigorous, lively and joyful, the older folk upright and erect like the hollow oak tree that still rises tall with its head high. There is however a pensive quality upon everyone’s face, and it is into the rendering of the expressiveness of these gazes that the artist has directed his greatest skill [my italics throughout].\n\n32Many of these views coalesce within Pashalian’s review of Nichanian’s painting, exposing the Realist reviewer’s internalisation of opposing traits of attitudes towards the provincials and the bantoukhd. Beyond the descriptive, Pashalian’s reflections betray the building up of a multi-layered allegorical reading, which despite being projected onto the canvas, could not be written about. Paragraph upon paragraph, an emotional aura is woven around the painting, alluding to but not naming its perceived allegorical content and disguised meanings. In the process, Pashalian’s text exposes the powerful romantic undercurrent that survives in the Constantinople Armenian manifestation of Realism of the 1880s and 1890s. The melancholic sentimentality of his response captures a mood at once at odds with what ought to be a joyful spirit for a painting of what is after all a festive occasion, a wedding celebration. By the end of his article, Pashalian has run out of things to say:\n\n145 Taparig, Arevelk, no. 1960, 28 July 1890.\n\nAnd so, contemplate for a while longer, and you become emotional, touched by intense feelings stirred up from the depth of your heart. The artist has attained his goal, [for] he has awakened that tiny emotive nerve thread that jolts your entire body, and your hand, guided by instinct, searches for the hand of the artist, to express with a firm burning squeeze that which the lips are unable to convey.\n\nRepresentation and Censorship in 1880s Constantinople\n\n160 The first painting discussed was that of two Jewish scrap sellers, “fine specimen of the Hebrew typ (...)\n\n161 In Roberts’ text the word has been inadequately translated to “wanderings”, as a result of which th (...)\n\n162 AZKASER Painting Exhibition (Նկարահանդէս), Masis, no. 3197, 28 May 1882.

The expression of this painting is extremely tender and heart rending (յոյժ սրտառուչ). The sensitive brush of the author has succeeded in personifying the bantkhdoutioun and plundering (հարստահարութիւն) of our provincial brethren. I saw foreigners who were saddened before this sight (երեւոյթ), and perhaps, wasn’t it natural that I should weep, I who is not a connoisseur of the arts (արուեստագէտ), but simply AZKASER.\n\n182 G. Libaridian 2004, p. 52.\n\nIn the context of the Ottoman Armenian people, the difference between azgasirutiune [sic] (love of nation) and hayrenasirutiune [sic] reflected not only a chronological progression in political thought, but also divergent, if not conflicting, class concerns.\n\n40Srabian’s Armenian Beggar from Van and Hagopian’s Beggar Woman from Van, painted in 1882 and 1889 respectively, are both direct and immediate, where nothing detracts from the desperation and abject poverty of the subjects. The bare feet of the old woman and the dirty fingernails of her outstretched hand, and the pathetic, imploring fatalism present in the posture and gaze of the man highlight their subjects’ plight. Hagopian has used the gender and age of his beggar woman as signs projecting further layers of meaning, of desperation and loneliness onto the figure of an old helpless woman on the streets, defenceless in a patriarchal society. His realist visual vocabulary, somewhat grittier than Srabian’s, and more Realist, perhaps mirrors or reflects the subtle developments among the artists’ literary counterparts, a quiet departure from the more explicit Romantic overtones of the earliest days of Ottoman Armenian Realism towards a more naturalist maturity. The background of Hagopian’s beggar especially recalls the practice of late nineteenth century photographic studios of photographing subjects outdoors, with the blank canvas of the wall with its cracks serving to reinforce an aura of poverty and heighten the sense of destitution. From their shared vantage point of urban Constantinople, both artists associated with the liberal milieu of the city, name “Van” as the place of origin for their subjects, drawing attention at once to the socio-economic plight of Ottoman Armenia and the hardships of bantoukhds in the city.\n\nReading Nichanian’s Wedding: Art as Barometer of Historical Moment\n\n42Nichanian’s Armenian Wedding in Moush is a work by a respected artist-intellectual, painted at the height of his fame, whose western art education and thorough grounding in academic painting come through clearly in its conceptualization, composition and execution. We know that Nichanian laboured on the work for years, and unusually for a commercial native artist produced it outside traditional channels of patronage. The length of time spent and the work’s monumental scale indicate its evident importance to the artist, who according to Arpiarian and Pashalian, spared no effort in researching, contemplating and striving towards the accomplishment of a truthful image of a traditional Armenian wedding set in Ottoman Armenia.\n\n43Whatever Nichanian’s initial conceptions, during the process of the work’s production, the shifting socio-political environment had necessarily crept into the content of the work, and the way it was received. This section seeks to excavate Nichanians’ intentions as they developed across time, including his attempts to bypass constraints of increasingly tight censorship. It proposes that the artist’s resort to allegory as a means of commenting upon the situation in Ottoman Armenia under a cloak of ethnological naturalism and realism constituted an attempt in evoking through paint what his contemporaries were unable to express in print without risking serious repercussions: in late 1880s Constantinople the painting’s Ottoman Armenian subject matter made the subtle use of allegory a less fraught means of engaging with issues that obviously concerned the artist deeply. As such the Wedding provides an insightful barometer of its specific historical moment. Viewed within this context, the absence of even a single reference to “Moush” or “Armenia” anywhere in Pashalian’s 1890 review is a direct reflection of his zeitgeist. Yet, Nichanian’s selection of Moush as imagined site for his Wedding far from being accidental, was at the heart of his message.\n\n198 Ն. (N.), Arevelk, no. 70, 26 March 1884.\n\nIt was in this plain that [in the past] were situated a great many of the pagan Armenians’, and [as are] today Christian Armenians’ holiest and most sacred sites […] These include the most glorious monastery, the feudal fief of the Illuminator, St Garabed by name and the third holiest among religious sites [after Echmiadzin and St Hagop in Jerusalem] […] despite troubles, massacres and pillaging, the Plain of Moush is still home to no fewer than one hundred thousand inhabitants, of whom eighty thousand are Armenians and the remainder Turkish and Kurdish Muslims. Of its one hundred and twenty villages, ninety are Armenian inhabited and thirty inhabited by others.\n\n47Bantkhdoutioun, and Moush, as imagined by an urban artist-intellectual in late 1880s Constantinople, are central to any reading Nichanian’s Wedding. For the artist had deliberately selected Moush to act as synecdoche for Ottoman Armenia, whilst the Mshetsi represented a metonymic signifier for the imagined timeless traditions of an ancient land through the meticulous rendering of ethnographic detail, and the embodiment of the modern ill of bantkhdoutioun. Nichanian, Srabian and Hagopian had all drawn on and represented the Hayasdantsi bantoukhd. Yet, while the latter two had chosen to situate them as impoverished migrants and pathetic beggars in the city, Nichanian had in contrast restored them to the dignity of their homeland, as he envisioned it. The question that emerges is what had informed and determined his selection of theme, a scene from a traditional wedding celebration in Ottoman Armenia, and its monumental scale, when most other Constantinople artists tended to resort to subtle, intimate, allegorical portraits or modest ethnographic studies representing mainly destitute migrant men and women in the city. [It is tempting to see an analogy here between artists’ small-scale works and the preponderance of short stories among Constantinople Realists on the one hand, and Nichanian’s project and the limited production of novels on the other.] As already hinted by Arpiarian in 1886, everything points towards an aim of achieving something new, different and ambitious.\n\n48To determine the various attributes of the work, both in a formal sense and in terms of content, it is instructive to dig deeper. With the aim of excavating meaning the essay considers the Wedding alongside three seemingly unrelated works: an eighteenth century painting by the Flemish artist Jean Baptiste Vanmour (1671-1737) of an Armenian wedding procession in Constantinople; a painting of a biblical funeral by Nichanian’s Neapolitan master, Morelli; and a 1913 painting by the Ottoman Armenian artist Yervant Kazazian representing an Armenian wedding ceremony.\n\n51There are of course a number of important differences between the works: for example, while the Bosphorus setting of Vanmour’s painting can be readily identified, and his rendering of the procession and its movement are clearly the outcome of direct observation of actual weddings, Nichanian’s evokes theatricality, giving the impression of actors deliberately arranged onto a stage. In the absence of evidence, any familiarity that Nichanian may have had with Vanmour’s paintings of wedding processions (Greek, Muslim and Armenian), or copies thereof, or perhaps the artist’s series of engravings in Italy or Constantinople cannot be proven, and a suggestion that he may have considered Vanmour’s engravings as part of his research would be pure conjecture. Yet even if the similarities and affinity are purely fortuitous, and Nichanian had never set his eyes on these works, considering the two images together still provide fascinating visual documents of Ottoman Armenian wedding traditions and confirmation that while lost to the community of late nineteenth century Constantinople, such traditions very much persisted in rural Ottoman Armenia. This points to the migrant origins of the city’s Armenians thereby revealing the link between the traditions of eighteenth century Ottoman Constantinople Armenians with those of late nineteenth century Ottoman Armenia.\n\n52Many of the similarities and differences between these two narrative paintings, separated by just under two centuries, are best understood with recourse to Western European academic, pictorial and artistic traditions and conventions. However other factors that also make their presence felt in the content of Vanmour’s and Nichanian’s Weddings require an investigation that needs to be expanded beyond the picture plane. Crucially for this essay, the question of why Vanmour’s painting presents an unquestionably, and naturally, joyous affair while Nichanian’s wedding is sombre and tinged with sadness, needs to be asked. Contrast here, for example, the lightness and exuberance of the flamboyant Constantinople dancing boys leading the procession against the apparent melancholy even in the stature of the Mshetsis dancing to the tune of the zurna, their figures frozen in stasis.\n\n53To consider this absence of celebratory spirit we return to Pashalian’s A Provincial Wedding. Here, the final paragraph betrays a half-disguised disappointment or dismay at the lack of appreciation for this painting by wealthy Constantinople Armenian elites, with whom after all Nichanian was extremely well connected. Pashalian ends his review with the following words:\n\n219 Taparig, Arevelk, no. 1960, 28 July 1890.\n\nYou will ask now, where will that picture [be housed]? Who has purchased it? Which Armenian grandee’s salon will it grace? The painting has already been bought and will be going to America to be sold there. Any further explanation is all but unnecessary [...]. A wealthy American will pay a hefty sum to purchase the Provincial Wedding, and his guests will study that painting with disimpassioned astonishment and awe, while here, among us, apart from capturing our admiration, [it] would have troubled our heart.\n\n54Perhaps that it was sold abroad might suggest that, at such a politically charged moment, the Wedding may have been considered too risky an acquisition by members of the city’s elites for whom a painting of such stature would have been intended, cautious of falling foul of the Abdülhamid II regime. While it is unlikely that Nichanian would ever have doubted that a buyer would have been found for this work, the strong sense of unconcealed regret that one gets when reading Pashalian’s text, that the work was about to be sent abroad, to the United States is particularly interesting especially since the artist’s works had often been sold to foreign buyers or had been sent abroad for sale before. How much of this disappointment is Pashalian’s, or reflects Nichanian, may never be known, but perhaps the painting’s “exile” provides an appropriate metaphor to the imminent exile of the reviewer and later departure from Constantinople of the artist.\n\n56Whether Nichanian fashioned his Wedding on Morelli’s allegorical meditation of faith and resurrection is again a matter of conjecture, but that he would have seen and known this famous work in Naples is not in doubt. It is in the Wedding, more than any of Nichanian’s known works, where Morelli’s spirit is felt most vividly: visually, intellectually and philosophically. That Nichanian, like Morelli, had drawn on a western tradition of narrative painting, both secular and sacred, and nineteenth century academic realism to produce a deeply allegorical work can be clearly made out in his altar like construction of the space and arrangement of the figures. In terms of compositional devices, the large minimally furnished spaces created by the artists where the drama is allowed to play out bear striking resemblance to one another, albeit viewed from different angles. There would be little affinity between these impressive spaces that Nichanian and Morelli have imagined and the realities of the humble dwellings of Ottoman Armenia or a local notable’s abode in biblical Galilee.\n\n61Despite the common theme, the contrast between Nichanian’s and Kazazian’s wedding paintings cannot be understated. The freedom of Kazazian’s modernist brush provides a powerful counterpoint to Nichanian’s conservative, meticulously controlled academic precision. While Nichanian by his own admission, had reserved his admiration for the masters of the past and the more conservative academic painters of his day rather than the avant-garde, experimental artists of the 1870s and 1880s, Kazazian’s brave painting, thoroughly modern in execution and composition, is looking towards fauvism and expressionism. Furthermore, the quarter of a century that separates the two works, more than suggesting a merely stylistic or temporal gulf between the two, presents two fundamentally different visions of Ottoman Armenia.\n\n63Nothing signifies the difference between the environments in which the works were produced and consumed than the circumstances of the naming and display of the two works: Arevelk’s Provincial Wedding seen by Pashalian the art critic at the premises of a firm of commissionaires before embarking on its own emigration; meanwhile, Navasart’s Armenian Wedding commands pride of place, apparently within an Ottoman section of an international exhibition, with its proudly Ottoman Armenian subject matter. From a vantage point of 1913, the repressive years of Abdülhamid II seem long over. No image celebrates these newly found constitutional freedoms, and expresses confidence for the future like Kazazian’s Armenian Wedding, from which any preoccupation for bantkhdoutioun is absent.\n\nThe Afterlife of Garabed Nichanian’s Provincial Wedding in Moush\n\n66From the moment that the paint had dried on Nichanian’s monumental canvas, its image was captured and reproduced in mediated form: as photographic print, engraving and newsprint. These reproductions, made during the artist’s lifetime, never questioned the Wedding’s painterliness, despite the differences of accompanying captions whose content was determined by place, time and environment. Yet, with each and every mediated reproduction, and as the image travelled to a new audience, its ecology was transformed, and its context altered. Hence a reference to the Wedding became a reference to a number of different material objects: painting, photograph, etching, print. Our very own necessary reliance on an 1890 albumen photographic print as inroad into the meaning and determinacy of a late nineteenth century painting, has had to be balanced throughout this essay by the fortunate incidence of contemporary responses to what was after all a very different object: an oil on canvas painting representing an imagined place, Ottoman Armenia, that does no longer exist. Our relationship with the image, already challenged by temporal distance, is further complicated given the heavily politicized vantage point of our post-Armenian Genocide age.\n\n71Meanwhile, the image’s recent online presence is further accelerating and perpetuating constantly shifting contexts and ecologies. Varying use, or misuse, has spilled from the textbook page onto the worldwide web. On the website of the Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute Nichanian’s image has been subsumed into an online photographic exhibition of Ottoman Armenian weddings [see figure 18]. The final paragraph of the introductory text Armenian Wedding in the Ottoman Empire frames the setting:\n\n254 “Armenian Wedding in the Ottoman Empire”, http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/online_exhibition_14.ph (...)\n\nIn the XIX century the art of photography became widely popular in the Ottoman Empire also thanks to the efforts of Armenian photographers. In their collections one can encounter photos of wedding ceremonies and newly married couples reflecting popular traditions of Western Armenia and other Armenian-inhabited regions of the Ottoman Empire preserved. This kind of photographs provides [sic] rich information on the Western Armenian wedding rites.\n\n*\n\n73This essay constituted, foremost, an exercise in the taking of a single image (and a kindred text), and via the careful assembling of clues and empirical fragments, engaging with the complex historical environment that informed and determined its production, reception, mediation and consumption. Ensuing alterations in meaning in Nichanian’s image, caused by its detachment from the time and place it was made, its transmittance via mechanical reproduction and mediation across time and space, its transformation into an object travelling to its viewers via the processes of publishing (and recently the web), its participation in ever-shifting networks of exchange, and finally its reception at different times and places, and from multiple vantage points, were considered using multiple interpretive avenues, methodological tools and approaches. This was informed by the perusal and close reading of the Ottoman Armenian printed page, which alongside visual material, opened up a revealing space where that which was occasionally missed by the censor, or its gaps and silences, often rang louder than the newsprint.\n\n74Arguing for historical specificity and nuance, the essay discussed texts of art criticism produced at different points of a single decade, the 1880s, and several paintings of similar themes, produced at different historical moments. Via this exercise affinities in tone and timbre, or visual vocabulary and language, were exposed as often masking or camouflaging the very different contents of these images and texts, often obfuscating the circumstances that informed, and the environments that determined, their production. Hence, the essay cautioned against the easy temptation of uncritically reading uniform meanings into texts published at different moments, and ascribing identical resonances to images without considering specificity and nuance.\n\n257 Ibid.\n\nIn this Oriental exhibition the most eye-catching [objects] for American women are a silk Persian rug, woven on both sides with various colours and pictures, and an oil painting of Mr G. Nichanian nine feet in length and five feet in width, showing a wedding ceremony. The colours were so harmonious and the picture was executed with such skill that to be honest brings honour to the Armenian artist.\n\n76Attempts to locate the painting have so far not yielded much. I suspect it very much remains “hidden” in a private collection, probably in the United States, to which art historians have no access. Yet, the very absence of the physical painting and the presence that its image’s various mediated incarnations have maintained across time and space, are very much part of the story and living history of Garabed Nichanian’s Armenian Wedding in Moush. Like many other visual representations of Ottoman Armenians and Ottoman Armenia, Nichanian’s image refuses to fade away."
