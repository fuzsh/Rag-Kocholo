This is always (unless I'm mistaken) the same as the name of the Soviet republic that it was in at the time Born in Peekskill, New York, in 1956. His paternal grandmother was an opera singer, born in New South Wales, who moved first to Europe and then to New York, where she married businessman John Hutton Gibson. The family moved to Sydney when he was 12, after his father was awarded a six–figure sum as compensation for a work–related injury. He began acting there, and his first American film was The River (1984)\n\nMel Gibson\n\nBorn in 1940 in San Francisco, of Chinese parents, although his mother was half Caucasian. His father was a Cantonese opera singer and a film actor. The family returned to Hong Kong when he was 3 months old. He learnt martial arts there and became involved in a series of fights; when he was 18 his parents decided to send him back to San Francisco, where his elder sister was already staying with family friends. He moved to Seattle, married, fathered two children (Brandon and Shannon), and began teaching martial arts in 1959. He began appearing in various television roles, and eventually returned to Hong Kong to make feature films. His first three Hong Kong films were The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972) and Way of the Dragon (1972). Enter the Dragon (1973) was produced in Hong Kong with the co–operation of Warner Bros, and he died in controversial circumstances six days before its release in July 1973. The recorded cause of death was an allergic reaction to a tranquilliser contained in an analgesic drug which he had taken for a headache. He had been successfully treated for cerebral oedema ten weeks previously\n\nBruce Lee"
