        "meta_description": "Background Merozoites of Plasmodium falciparum invade through several pathways using different RBC receptors. Field isolates appear to use a greater variability of these receptors than laboratory isolates. Brazilian field isolates were shown to mostly utilize glycophorin A-independent invasion pathways via glycophorin B (GPB) and/or other receptors. The Brazilian population exhibits extensive polymorphism in blood group antigens, however, no studies have been done to relate the prevalence of the antigens that function as receptors for P. falciparum and the ability of the parasite to invade. Our study aimed to establish whether variation in the GYPB*S/s alleles influences susceptibility to infection with P. falciparum in the admixed population of Brazil.   Methods Two groups of Brazilian Amazonians from Porto Velho were studied: P. falciparum infected individuals (cases); and uninfected individuals who were born and/or have lived in the same endemic region for over ten years, were exposed to infection but have not had malaria over the study period (controls). The GPB Ss phenotype and GYPB*S/s alleles were determined by standard methods. Sixty two Ancestry Informative Markers were genotyped on each individual to estimate admixture and control its potential effect on the association between frequency of GYPB*S and malaria infection.   Results GYPB*S is associated with host susceptibility to infection with P. falciparum; GYPB*S/GYPB*S and GYPB*S/GYPB*s were significantly more prevalent in the in the P. falciparum infected individuals than in the controls (69.87% vs. 49.75%; P<0.02). Moreover, population genetics tests applied on the GYPB exon sequencing data suggest that natural selection shaped the observed pattern of nucleotide diversity.   Conclusion Epidemiological and evolutionary approaches suggest an important role for the GPB receptor in RBC invasion by P. falciparum in Brazilian Amazons. Moreover, an increased susceptibility to infection by this parasite is associated with the GPB S+ variant in this population.",

        "text": "Study population\n\nTwo groups of individuals have been recruited for this study over the period of 2006–2007 in Porto Velho, Rondônia: 1) P. falciparum infected individuals; and 2) uninfected individuals who were born and/or have lived in the same endemic region for over ten years, were exposed to infection but have not had malaria in the past or over the 2–3 year study period. All consenting individuals have been interviewed and information regarding their gender, age, date of birth, place of birth, mother's name and maiden surname, ethnic origin of their parent and their grandparents, length of residence in their present locality, history of exposure and/or number of malaria episodes in the last 10 years, and past treatment for malaria were recorded.\n\nRecruitment of P. falciparum infected individuals (N = 83) was done in the local healthcare clinic, Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical (CEPEM), Porto Velho – Rondônia. The consented individuals were of ranging age (18–62) and a female/male ratio of 27/56 (Table 1). The blood samples of the consented infected individuals were analyzed for P. falciparum parasitemia using Giemsa stained thick blood smears. The density of parasitemia in the infected individuals was recorded and expressed as the number of asexual P. falciparum per microliter of blood assuming a leukocyte count of 8000/µl. All patients with any symptoms of malaria and/or microscopically confirmed infections were given standard and appropriate treatment. The P. falciparum treatments involved artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem®) or quinine-doxycycline therapy, the first-line anti-malarial therapies recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which are superior to other available and affordable treatments. DNA prepared from whole blood samples was later analyzed by PCR for parasite species specific genotyping using established protocols [51] to confirm their infection status with the malaria parasites. It appeared that only 32.3% of all the P. falciparum infected individuals had mono-infection with P. falciparum; the majority of the individuals had mixed infection with P. vivax (66.3%) or had a triple infection with P. vivax and P. malariae (1.4%).\n\nActive recruitment of the uninfected individuals who were born and/or have lived in the same endemic region for over ten years and have reported that they never had an episode of malaria although their family members or neighbors had it (markers for exposure) was done in the villages around Porto Velho (Ouro Preto do Oeste, Guajará-Mirim, Ji-Paraná and Candeias do Jamari). Those who met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate were tested on site with the OptiMal® (DiaMed AG, Switzerland), a rapid malaria diagnosis test, to validate their non-infection status. Only those that were negative by the OptiMal® kit were bled. To further verify the non-infection status of the individuals in this study group, the DNA extracted from their whole blood sample was later analyzed by PCR for parasite species specific genotyping to identify those that might have asymptomatic malaria infections or to confirm their malaria infection free status using established protocols [51]. It appeared that 30 of the individuals were PCR positive for malaria DNA; 27 of them had P. vivax specific DNA and 7 had a mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum DNA. These individuals were therefore excluded from the uninfected control group but also were not included in the infected group. The final control uninfected group constituted of 199 individuals; 18–56 years of age and a female/male ratio of 97/102. A follow up of these individuals 2 years after the start of the study confirmed that they still had no episodes of malaria in the past or over the study period.\n\nStatistical and population genetics analyses\n\nWe used the Fisher exact test to assess the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To measure association between S/s genotypes and malaria infection we used the haplotype score test by Schaid et al. [58] and Lake et al. [59] implemented in the software Haplostats v.1.4, assuming dominance for the S allele and when necessary, including age, gender, and African, European or Native American ancestry (see below) as covariates. Although Haplostats has been developed keeping in mind haplotype analyses, the association test (analogous to Fisher exact tests) is also suitable for single SNPs.\n\nIndividual European, African and Native American ancestry were estimated using the Bayesian clustering algorithms developed by Pritchard and implemented in the program STRUCTURE v2.3.2 [60], [61]. We assumed that three parental populations (K = 3 clusters) contributed to the genome of the admixed individuals. STRUCTURE estimates individual admixture conditioning on Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium on each of the K = 3 clusters, that represent the parental populations. We run the program using a length of burn-in Period of 100 000 and 10 0000 repetitions of MCMC after burning. We used prior population information for individuals from the parental populations to assist clustering (USEPOPINFO = 1) and assumed the admixture model for individuals from the admixed populations, inferring the alpha parameter for each population. We also used the parameters GENSBACK = 2 and MIGRPRIOR = 0.05. Moreover, we assumed that allele frequencies were correlated (i.e. similar across parental populations) and that the parental populations show different levels of differentiation (FST, with prior mean of 0.01 and standard deviation of 0.05). The admixture in each group (cases and controls) is calculated by Structure as the average of the admixture for each individual within the group. We performed these analyses with the two sets of data we produced for this study: (1) the 48 INDELS previously used by Santos et al. [57], using the ancestral populations reported in that publication, and (2) using 62 AIMs (those in Santos et al. [57] and the 14 SNPs reported by da Silva et al. [56], using the parental populations from the latter publication. Both measurements of ancestry were highly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficients: 0.82, 0.89 and 0.92 for African, European and Native American admixture, respectively, with P always<0.01).\n\nWe inferred haplotypes considering SNPs with a Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) ≥0.05, using the method by Stephens and Scheet [62]. The recombination parameter ρ was also calculated for each population by using the method of Li and Stephens [63]. These inferences were performed by the software Phase v.2.1.1., using 10.000 iterations, thinning intervals of 100 and burn in of 1000. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated by r2 for SNPs with MAF≥0.05 in at least one population [64] and its significance assessed by LOD scores, using software Haploview v.3.2 [65].\n\nFor the analyses of the sequencing data, we assessed intra-population variability using the following estimators of the θ parameter based on the infinite-site-model of mutations: π, the per-site mean number of pair-wise differences between sequences [66], and by θw, based on the number of segregating sites [67]. To investigate if the observed patterns of variability in the studied Brazilian population is consistent with the neutral model of evolution, we used the statistical tests of Tajima's D [68], Fu and Li's D* and Fu and Li 's F* [69] on the re-sequencing data, testing these statistics against the standard null hypothesis of neutrality (no natural selection) under constant population size.\n\nGYPB*S/s frequencies in the control and P. falciparum infected populations\n\nTwo groups of individuals were studied; the uninfected group (N = 199) and the P. falciparum infected group (N = 83). Host DNA from these individuals was used for GYPB*S/s genotyping by AS-PCR, PCR-RFLP and/or DNA array analysis. Specific PCR amplification of GYPB*S/GYPB*s is difficult because of the high homology between GYPA, GYPB and GYPE. To have accurate results we have chosen two different methods for GYPB*S/GYPB*s genotyping: the allele-specific AS-PCR, an “in house” method, and the HEA (i.e. Human Erythrocyte Antigen) BeadChip, a microarray method commercially available. All samples were analyzed by both methods. When the genotype results in an individual were inconsistent using both methods, we excluded these individuals from further analyses, even thought the HEA BeadChip is known to be more accurate than the AS-PCR [52], [53]. Only 3 individuals had mismatching genotypes and were not included in the association studies. Genomic DNA samples from individuals phenotyped S−s+ but genotyped as GYPB*S/s were analyzed using a combination AS/PCR-RFLP assay [29], [70] in order to determine if the S allele was silenced (GYPB*S silent gene).\n\nWhen the genotype distributions of GYPB*S/s alleles in the two study groups were compared, the differences in the frequencies of the GYPB*S/GYPB*S and GYPB*S/GYPB*s vs. GYPB*s/GYPB*s genotypes between the P. falciparum infected individuals (cases) and the uninfected individuals (control) were significant (69.87% vs. 49.75% of GYPB*S/GYPB*S and GYPB*S/GYPB*s and 30.1% vs. 50.25% of GYPB*s/GYPB*s, respectively; P<0.02, Odds Ratio = 1.55 with 95%CI = [1.02, 2.38]) (Table 1). In these analyses, we assumed that the presence of the GYPB*S allele is a dominant risk factor for susceptibility to infection (i.e., regardless if it is a homozygote or heterozygote), as it results in the phenotypic expression of GPB S+ on the surface of the RBCs. Intriguingly, only the infected individuals do not fit the Hardy-Weinberg expectation; with an excess of the heterozygous GYPB*S/GYPB*s genotype (66.27%, Table 1) as compared to what was expected (46.66%).\n\nWe observed a discordance of 5% between Ss phenotyping (performed in the field) and genotyping, which is compatible with previous studies [70]. Noteworthy, the results of phenotypes match those of genotypes, both for the excess of S+s+ or GYPB*S/GYPB*s heterozygous individuals among cases and for the association of the presence of the GPB S+ or GYPB*S putatively dominant allele with their infection status. Although GYPB, GYPA and GYPE genotyping is associated with technical difficulties due to their extensive sequence homology, the high concordance of our phenotype and genotype results and the significance of the association even when phenotypes are analyzed, suggest that our genotyping results are robust.\n\nInterestingly, we have found a higher frequency of heterozygous GYPB*S/s genotypes among the P. falciparum infected individuals (66.27% in cases versus 42.21% in controls). Considering that heterozygous are more frequent that the homozygous S+s−, it seems that the amount of GPB S receptor molecules doesn't influence the susceptibility to P. falciparum infection. If we make an analogy to the Duffy blood group (FY), the receptor for P. vivax, and susceptibility of P. vivax malaria, different studies [20], [71], [72], including one in the Amazonian region of Brazil [73], have demonstrated that individuals with the FYA/FYB genotype have higher susceptibility to malaria infection. The Fy gene has two antigens (Fya and Fyb) that are encoded by the co-dominant alleles FYA and FYB, located on chromosome 1. The corresponding anti-Fya and anti-Fyb antibodies define four different phenotypes; Fy(a+b+), Fy(a+b−), Fy(a−b+) and Fy(a−b−). The FYA and FYB alleles differ by one nucleotide change in exon 2 encoding glycine in Fya or aspartic acid in Fyb at residue 42 [73]. In the Brazilian study [73], the authors reported a larger number of malaria episodes among patients with the heterozygote (FY*A/FY*B) genotype than the homozygote (FY*A/FY*A or FY*B/FY*B) genotypes. Individuals homozygous for FYA or FYB alleles expressed a lower quantity of the Duffy antigen, which is required for the P. vivax invasion, than those who were heterozygotes. Apart from the different levels of the expression, the specific conformation of the Fya and Fyb antigens may also determine differences in the susceptibility to infection. Nevertheless, it was concluded that one of the possible consequences of differential susceptibility to P. vivax malaria could be modifications in allelic frequencies of FY*A and FY*B in populations exposed to P. vivax, the most prevalent malaria species in the Brazilian Amazon region.\n\nOur study has verified for the first time that molecular variation in the GYPB gene, particularly in the GYPB*S/s alleles, influenced host susceptibility to infection with P. falciparum in Porto Velho, Rondônia. In this study we took into consideration the possible confounding factor of ethnicity by performing association analyses adjusted for admixture, as well as for age and gender (Table 1). An association between other human receptor polymorphisms and variations in the parasite ligands of P. falciparum that modulate susceptibility to malaria, was also demonstrated [25], [74]–[76].\n\nGYPB*S/s allele frequencies vary across human populations; the GYPB*S allele (supposedly associated with infection) is less common in East Asians (∼10%) than in Sub-Saharan Africans (>25%) and Europeans (∼30–40%). Therefore, if the cases have more European ancestry than controls; a false positive result may emerge due to the association of any variant more common in Europeans, and thus the association results we got might not be at all related with susceptibility to infection conferred by the GPB Ss blood group antigens. To avoid a false positive result, we also measured the association among GPB Ss variants and infection by controlling the effect of admixture. Because we ascertained that African, European and Native American admixture do not differ among cases and controls (Figure 1 and Table 1), we exclude the possibility that our result is a spurious association. Controlling for admixture is essential in genetic epidemiology studies performed in Latin American populations, where large inter-individual differences in admixture are the rule [27].\n\nIndividual European, African and Native American ancestry were inferred from 60 ancestry informative markers in cases (magenta) and controls (yellow). Admixture was inferred by comparison with individuals from the putative parental populations: Europeans (red), African/African American (green) and Native Americans (blue). Admixture was estimated using the software Structure and average admixture over cases and controls is shown in Table 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016123.g001\n\nWe hypothesize that this Met29Thr polymorphism might be associated with changes in the structure of the GPB molecule that is used by P. falciparum to enter the RBCs. By having a Thr residue (GPB s+) on the RBCs instead of a Met residue (GPB S+), GPB s+ gains potentially a new site for O-glycosylation, which can likely alter its conformation and thus influence the efficiency of invasion by the parasites and ultimately, susceptibility to infection. Alternatively, this polymorphism may also affect dimerization of GPB molecules with other GPB or with GPA molecules [77].\n\nPopulation genetics of GYPB and inferences about natural selection\n\nIn principle, the GYPB*S/s alleles might not be the only functional GPB variants that modify P. falciparum invasion efficiencies in the Brazilian population studied. To understand the relationships between the observed association and the haplotype structure of GYPB in this population, we sequenced exons 2, 4, 5 and 6 of GYPB and their flanking regions, for a total of 1492 bp in sub-samples of cases and controls, matching the proportion of SS, Ss and ss genotypes observed in the total number of cases and controls studied. These sequences are publicly available under the GenBank accession numbers HQ639948–HQ640229. This sub-sample includes 41 cases (2 SS, 26 Ss, 13 ss) and 100 controls (8 SS, 42 Ss and 50 ss). We also used HapMap data available in June 2009 to explore the pattern of linkage disequilibrium across GYPB and selected the tag-SNP rs4835511 to be genotyped in the GYPB sequenced individuals using TaqMan (Applied Biosystem) assay.\n\nTable 3 shows the common GYPB haplotypes (i.e. a combination of alleles on the same chromosome) based on eight common SNPs across the sequenced region and the tag-SNP rs4835511. Haplotypes are sorted on the basis of their S/s (rs7683365) allele, and Figure 2 shows that the S/s SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with some common silent polymorphisms in exon 4 and its adjacent introns, but not with all the common SNPs reported in the GYPB sequenced regions. In particular, there is no linkage disequilibrium between the S/s alleles (rs7683365) and the non-synonymous common SNP rs1132783 (Ser/Thr) in exon 5. Since this polymorphism is predicted by PolyPhen [78] as benign, we assumed that its role in determining susceptibility to malaria infection is minor in respect to the S/s allele; SNP rs1132783 is located in the transmembrane domain of the protein, thus unlikely to have an effect on the host-parasite interaction. The site-specific PolyPhen algorithm (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/), which uses protein structure and/or sequence conservation information from each gene to predict whether a nonsynonymous mutation is “benign,” “possibly damaging,” or “probably damaging”, was shown to be the best predictor of the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations in a study analyzing a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes [79].\n\nLinkage disequilibrium among common SNPs in GYPB was estimated in both study groups: the controls (a) and in the cases, malaria infected individuals from Brazilian Amazon (b). Underlined SNPs are non-synonymous substitutions: rs7683365 is the SNP determining S/s antigens; rs1132783 is a Ser/Thr polymorphism (see Table 3).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016123.g002\n\nThe pattern of nucleotide diversity of GYPB revealed by the sequencing data is also informative about the role of the S/s alleles in susceptibility to malaria infection, because it allows inferences about the action of natural selection driven by malaria during the human evolutionary history [80]. Inferences about the action of natural selection have two implications. First, variants on genes inferred to be under selection have contributed to determine phenotype variability and perhaps, differential susceptibility to diseases such as malaria. Second, by definition of natural selection, these variants have been associated with relatively different reproductive efficiencies (i.e. fitness) of their carriers, and therefore, they have biomedical relevance. In particular for malaria, Ayodo et al. [81] have evidenced that combining information from association studies and evolutionary inferences about natural selection increases the probability of identifying susceptibility genes of malaria infection.\n\nAnalysis of GYPB nucleotide diversity in the Brazilian population studied (Table 4) reveals that: (a) GYPB shows a level of diversity that is similar to the most variable loci (ABO, SERPINA5) observed in African populations [82]; the most diverse continental human population. This is due in part to the genomic structure of the glycophorins' region, that encodes the GYPA, GYPB and GYPE highly homologous genes, and which might be affected by high rates of gene conversion among these loci. The observed high diversity may also be due the admixed nature of the Brazilian population, whose diversity reflects the combining effect of the parental population's diversity. (b) When the diversity of GYPB is measured separately for haplotypes carrying S or s alleles, diversity is consistently lower across cases and controls for the s haplotypes (associated with resistance to infection) than for the S haplotypes (associated with infection), notwithstanding the higher frequency of the s allele, that being the most common in humans, is expected to be the ancestral one, a condition typically associated with higher nucleotide diversity.\n\nThe pattern of genetic diversity on a specific genomic region depends both on the demographic history of populations, as well as on locus specific evolutionary factors such as mutation, recombination and natural selection. Almost 60 years ago, Haldane [83] proposed the so-called “Malaria Hypothesis” - that malaria might act as a selective force on human populations. Since then, several studies have tested and verified this hypothesis in the human host [81] and the malaria parasites [84], [85]. To infer if malaria-driven natural selection has shaped the diversity of GYPB, we used statistical tests of the null hypothesis of neutrality: that the GYPB pattern of diversity may be explained considering only the demographic history of the studied population and mutation and recombination patterns of GYPB, without the need to invoke the action of other factors such as natural selection. These statistical tests [68], [69] (Tajima's D and Fu-Li's D* and F*) are based on the proportion of rare and common polymorphisms expected in a population under neutrality, and this proportion is informative about natural selection. Table 4 shows that Tajima's and Fu-Li's statistical tests are negative and significantly different from 0, which is indicative of an excess of rare alleles in respect to neutral expectations. This result is consistent with the following scenario involving the action of natural selection (i.e. a selective sweep): a beneficial substitution (putatively the s allele) rapidly increases in frequency (i.e. incomplete sweep) carrying its associated haplotype through a hitchhiking effect. This process, driven by natural selection, is too rapid for recombination to shuffle the surrounding haplotype. As a consequence, it is expected that the nucleotide diversity (π) of the haplotypes carrying the beneficial allele (s in this case) is lower than the alternative allele (S), as observed in our data (Table 4). During a selective sweep, rare substitutions become common both because: the rise in frequency of the s haplotype; other substitutions associated with S become rare; and new (and therefore rare) substitutions appear in the expanding positively selected haplotype. The negative values observed for the neutrality tests for GYPB is consistent with this scenario (Table 4).\n\nIn the case of the Brazilian admixed population, the observed excess of rare alleles in GYPB can not be a consequence of admixture, which generally results in a reduced proportion of rare alleles in respect to neutral expectations (and therefore, to positive values of statistical tests such as D, D* and F*) [69]. Instead, we are likely observing the signature of a selective sweep that occurred during the last thousands of years of the human evolution in malaria affected regions mainly in Southern Europe and more likely Africa [86], where the ancestors of our studied Brazilian population settled (see Table 1 for the predominant European admixture proportion). Although our interpretation may be true and consistent with the results of the present association study, an unambiguous inference about the action of natural selection would require a comparison of GYPB diversity with a set of other loci not affected by natural selection, that would allow to obtain a more realistic null neutral distribution of neutrality statistics (D, D*, F*) that incorporate the specific demographic history of the studied population. On the other hand, the lack of evidence of the action of natural selection on African or European populations on genomic screenings of signatures of natural selection [87]–[89] may be due to the difficulties in genotyping/sequencing of the glycophorins' genomic regions.\n\nAltogether, our results suggest that the S domain on GPB is important for its binding to the specific ligand of the P. falciparum parasite, EBL-1, which was recently identified and characterized [44]. RBCs carrying glycophorin B but not RBCs lacking glycophorin B (S−s−U−) were shown to adsorb the native EBL-1 from P. falciparum culture supernatants. Future studies are needed to demonstrate whether EBL-1 binds differentially to GPB S−s+ vs. S+s+ RBCs, and thus indirectly substantiate at a molecular level our observation of association studies at the population level and our population genetics inferences about the action of natural selection. Performing similar studies in other regions of the Amazons and other endemic regions of the world is also needed to further substantiate our observations; including both association studies with larger sample sizes and with a population genetics approach that include sequencing and genotyping at a higher resolution. Because P. falciparum shows also high population structure, in particular in the Amazon Region [90], it is also important to understand the extent of variability in host-parasite interaction and their co-evolution. The statistical association between the presence of the S allele and infection supports also the hypothesis that P. falciparum parasites in the Brazilian Amazon regions utilize GPB as a key receptor for invasion, and consequently individuals who carry distinct GYPB gene variants, which might facilitate erythrocyte invasion, will be more susceptible to P. falciparum infection. Thus, our results reinforce the need of studies focusing on in vitro invasion assays using erythrocytes with diverse GYPB genotypes and P. falciparum strains from different origin to establish the role of the GPB receptor for P. falciparum parasites of this region."
