        "text": "Results\n\nIn the ZBC-Consortium, we performed individual participant data meta-analysis from 1548 women with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infections during pregnancy, of whom 900 were from the southeast, 404 from the north, 157 from the northeast, and 87 from the central-west regions of Brazil ( and ). The study participant's median age was 28 (23–33, IQR) years and they were primarily multigravidae and carrying singleton pregnancies (99.2%). Among the pregnant women, 189/1200 (15.8%) had University/post-graduation education, 5.2% smoked during pregnancy and less than 3% used recreational drugs. The timing of ZIKV infections (i.e., determined by rash onset and/or positive RT-PCR test) was more frequent in the second (36.9%) and third trimesters (44.0%).\n\nTable 2\n\nCharacteristicZIKV+ Pregnant Women (N = 1548)Maternal age, years – median (IQR)28 (23–33)Highest educational attainment Primary education437 (36.4%) Secondary education574 (47.8%) University or postgraduate189 (15.8%) Missing education348Skin color Branca (White)364 (47.0%) Parda (Mixed)315 (40.7%) Preta (Black)85 (11.0%) Other10 (1.3%) Missing skin color774Timing of rash by trimester – n (%) First277 (19.1%) Second534 (36.9%) Third637 (44.0%) Missing100Number of prior pregnancies – n (%) None97 (7.3%) One452 (34.1%) Two390 (29.5%) Three or more386 (29.1%) Missing223Number of fetuses (current pregnancy) – n (%) Single1528 (99.2%) Twins13a (1.0%) Missing7Offspring sex – n (%) Male785 (52.4%) Female714 (47.6%) Missing58bNumber of stillbirths in prior pregnancies – n (%) None458 (91.0%) One35 (7.0%) Two or more10 (2.0%) Missing725Maternal comorbidities – n/N (%) Diabetes Mellitus70/927 (7.6%) Hypertension114/928 (12.3%) Anemia127/786 (16.2%)Familial history of congenital malformation – n/N (%)9/186 (4.8%)Lifestyle practices during this pregnancy – n/N (%) Smoking46/887 (5.2%) Alcohol use80/645 (12.4%) Illicit drug use23/814 (2.8%)\n\nAmong the 1548 ZIKV-exposed pregnancies, the risk of miscarriage was 0.9%, while the risk of stillbirth was 0.3% ( ). Among the pregnancies with liveborn children, the risk of prematurity was 10.5%, the risk of low birth weight was 7.7%, and the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) was 16.2%. The absolute risk of microcephaly at birth or at the first evaluation was 2.6% (95%-CI, 1.1–4.5), with more cases of moderate (1.4%) than severe (0.3%) while the risk of microcephaly at any time during the follow-up was 4.0% (95%-CI, 2.0–6.6). Notably, among the 37 cases of microcephaly at birth, 16 were disproportionate. Cases of disproportionate microcephaly were more frequently among children with severe microcephaly (11/13, 84.6%) than those with moderate microcephaly (5/24, 20.8%).\n\nThe risk of brain imaging abnormalities was 7.9% for any abnormality, 5.3% (95%-CI, 1.3–10.9) for calcifications, 2.3% (95%-CI, 0.3–5.4) for ventriculomegaly, and 1.7% (95%-CI, 0.2–4.4) for diffuse cortical atrophy. For any of the other abnormalities the risk was below 1% ( ).\n\nThe risk of any neurological abnormality at birth or in the first evaluation (median age 11.7 months, P25–P75: 6.2–15.4) was 18.7% (95%-CI, 2.6–41.5), with 5.6% (95%-CI, 0.1–15.3) for abnormal tonus/trophism, 2.5% (95%-CI, 0.0–7.2) for altered consciousness level/behavior, and 3.4% (95%-CI, 0.3–8.4) for seizures ( ). The risk of dysphagia at first evaluation (median age 14.9 months, P25–P75:8.4–19.6) was 1.5% (95%-CI, 0.0–4.5).\n\nThe risk of ophthalmic disorders at birth or in the first evaluation (median age 11.2 months, P25–P75:4.2–19.5) was 4.0% (95%-CI, 0.2–10.7). Regarding the results of hearing screening tests at birth or in the first evaluation (median age 6.5 months, P25–P75: 0.9–13.8), the risk of concomitant failure for both exams (ABR and OAE) was 6.4% ( ).\n\nThe overall risk of having microcephaly, neuroimaging, neurological, or ophthalmic abnormalities at first evaluation was 24.7% (95%-CI, 0.10–63.6). The risk of having concurrent abnormalities was low, only 4 out of 107 children had both neuroimaging and neurological abnormalities and only 2 out of 107 had both neurological and ophthalmic abnormalities (Supplementary Table S1). Relative to infections in the third trimester, ZIKV infections during the first trimester were associated with approximately 7-times higher odds of microcephaly and 17-times higher odds of neuroimaging abnormalities ( ). There was no evidence of an association between microcephaly and the mother's educational level, race/ethnicity, or geographic region ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nMicrocephaly at birth or first evaluationn/N (%)OR (95% CI)bp-valueTiming of infection in pregnancya First trimester18/169 (10.6%)7.52 (2.75–20.6)<0.001 Second trimester7/364 (1.9%)1.23 (0.42–3.57)0.706 Third trimester7/441 (1.5%)1.0 Missing trimester5/85––Highest educational attainment Primary education12/362 (3.3%)0.80 (0.27–2.30)0.673 Secondary education16/382 (4.2%)1.01 (0.36–2.83)0.978 University or postgraduate5/121 (4.1%)1.0– Missing education4/193––Skin color Branca (White)16/348 (4.6%)1.0– Parda (Mixed)8/270 (3.0%)0.56 (0.22–1.42)0.219 Preta (Black)4/79 (5.1%)1.11 (0.29–4.21)0.876 Other0/8 (0%)–– Missing skin color6/354––Region Northeast6/115 (5.2%)1.0– North8/128 (6.2%)1.21 (0.41–3.60)0.730 Central-West3/83 (3.6%)0.68 (0.17–2.81)0.595 Southeast20/732 (2.7%)0.51 (0.20–1.29)0.158\n\nBrain imaging abnormalities after birthn/N (%)OR (95% CI)bp-valueTiming of infection in pregnancya First25/138 (18.1%)17.1 (3.82–76.6)<0.001 Second12/254 (4.7%)3.66 (0.79–17.0)0.098 Third2/154 (1.3%)1.0\n\nIn subsidiary analyses to explore heterogeneity across subgroups, in the two-stage meta-analysis, there was no evidence of heterogeneity (p for heterogeneity chiˆ2 > 0.05) for the outcomes of microcephaly at birth/first evaluation, microcephaly at any time, neuroimaging abnormalities, ophthalmic abnormalities at birth or first evaluation, and dysphagia. There was heterogeneity between studies (p for heterogeneity chiˆ2 < 0.001) for neurological abnormalities (Supplementary Table S2). For most of the variables, the I2 was <60%. The sensitivity analysis using different methods to estimate the proportions resulted in broadly consistent findings; while there were some differences in point estimates, the confidence intervals overlapped for the evaluated outcomes (Supplementary Table S2).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis is the first individual participant data meta-analysis of cohorts of pregnant women with confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy ever published. This study focuses on Brazil, the epicentre of the microcephaly epidemic, and pools data from 13 cohort studies representing all Brazilian regions in which the 2015–2017 ZIKV epidemic occurred.\n\nThe absolute risk of microcephaly was 2.6% at birth or at the first evaluation and increased to 4.0% when we considered any time during follow-up. The risk of severe microcephaly was lower than that of moderate microcephaly. The overall result is consistent with other individual cohort and registry studies that demonstrated a frequency of ZIKV-associated microcephaly of less than 7%.21,22,24 Microcephaly can be detected at birth or develop postnatally in the first year of life,39 as previously documented.40,41 Our results indicate that, among the children who present with microcephaly, the fraction that is diagnosed postnatally is not negligible. The risk of post-natal ZIKV-associated microcephaly has not been documented before. This demonstrates the relevance of monitoring head growth closely in all infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure, even those born with normal head circumference.\n\nBoth proportionate and disproportionate microcephaly have been reported in infants with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). In this population, the risk of disproportionate microcephaly was slightly lower than proportionate microcephaly, and it was more frequent in children with severe microcephaly. Although the observed frequencies of preterm and low birthweight births were in line with expectations for the general population, we observed a somewhat elevated risk of SGA of 16.2%, possibly a result of intra-uterine growth restriction, likely due to placental insufficiency, as suggested by Brasil et al.23\n\nIn our analysis, the risk of brain imaging abnormalities was 7.9%, which is higher than the 3.3% and 4% found in other cohorts,19,22 but similar in terms of specific findings. Intracranial calcification and ventriculomegaly were the most common findings (risks of 5.3 and 2.3%, respectively). We found severe brain imaging abnormalities (calcifications, ventriculomegaly, cortical atrophy, cortical malformations) in infants with and without microcephaly at birth. Notably, previous research has documented that children who develop postnatal microcephaly are commonly born with severe brain damage.40,41 The relatively low frequency of detection of brain imaging abnormalities alone suggests that for children who are under routine medical surveillance, further imaging tests (e.g., computerized tomography - CT or magnetic resonance imaging - MRI) beyond screening ultrasounds should not be systematically performed on all prenatally ZIKV-exposed children without a clinical indication. In addition, although there is evidence in this investigation and previous research that adverse events triggered by ZIKV can occur during any gestational period,23 our findings are consistent with several previous studies that have shown maternal infection during earlier stages of pregnancy is generally associated with more severe structural brain damage.40,42, 43, 44\n\nWe observed, at birth or at the first evaluation (median 11.7 months), a frequency of 18.7% of at least one functional neurological abnormality detected in clinical evaluations of children with and without microcephaly. The pathophysiological abnormalities observed, such as seizures, reduction of consciousness, visual and hearing impairment, as well as motor deficits, can be partially explained by structural damages in the fetal central nervous system caused by exposure to a neurotropic virus during brain development. Although the main neurotropic effect of ZIKV infection is on neuronal progenitor cells, the virus also affects cells in other stages of maturity.45 However, the discordance between the frequency of convulsive seizures (3.4%) and epilepsy (0.0%) observed in our study suggests that the early seizure disorder is probably due to a transient functional alteration rather than a permanent structural alteration. Longer follow-up of the cohorts may clarify this hypothesis.\n\nLesions in the retina and in the optic nerve, which are frequently associated with CZS abnormalities,42,46 were identified in 4.6% and 2.0% of the infants, respectively. Overall, we identified a risk of ophthalmic abnormalities in 4.0% of infants, less than the risk of 11.8% observed in a cohort study from Colombia47 but higher than the 2% frequency reported in another pregnancy cohort from the US48 and than the report of no eye abnormality in the cohort in the French territories in the Americas.22 The higher risk for eye abnormalities observed in our combined cohort and in the Colombia cohort are likely due to the performance of detailed fundoscopic eye evaluations by ophthalmologists during infants’ follow-up, in contrast to screening evaluations done at the time of birth.22 In the US study participants were followed through active surveillance methods and less than 15% of the children born to women with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy had an ophthalmologic assessment.48 Hearing loss, described as one of the abnormalities associated with CZS, presenting as a sensorineural impairment was identified in 3.0% of included infants, using the ABR as a screening test, and in 6.4% using both ABR and OAE evaluations.49 Risk of auditory impairment was also identified in Colombia using ABR.47 Nevertheless, the risk of hearing deficits may be overestimated because it was based mainly on screening tests.\n\nConsistent with a prior study,26 we found that infant adverse outcomes were identified more frequently in isolation rather than in association with each other. Considering the four categories of microcephaly, neurological, ophthalmic, or neuroimaging abnormalities, the risk of a prenatally ZIKV-exposed liveborn child experiencing at least one of these types of abnormalities at any time during follow-up was 31.5%.\n\nBy combining individual participant data from almost all of the Brazilian pregnancy cohorts with RT-PCR confirmation of ZIKV, this study has unprecedented power for obtaining more precise estimates of the risks, including of rare events, associated with prenatal ZIKV infection. This study is also unique in that, as early as the beginning of 2016, Brazilian researchers began to meet at the study design stage to harmonize protocols and investigate a common set of key adverse outcomes. The main limitations for the interpretation of this IPD-MA are the degree of heterogeneity between individual studies and the variation in the number of children evaluated for each outcome. Heterogeneity may be explained mainly by the variation in assessment techniques and instruments and, for neurological outcomes in particular, the specific expertise of the examiner, the comprehensiveness of the neurological examination, the different construction of composite variables summarizing the neurological findings, and random error associated with small sample sizes. Despite these differences in study design, we observed that risks for the key outcome of microcephaly did not vary significantly by maternal educational level, race/ethnicity, or geographic region across the diverse Brazilian population. Similarly, the I2 statistic generally remained below 60% in the two-stage meta-analyses, suggesting only mild to moderate statistical heterogeneity in the frequency of other clinical outcomes. The variation in the number of children assessed for each outcome is not likely to have introduced selection bias in risk estimates as these evaluations were not guided by the presence of abnormalities in the individual studies. As pregnant women recruited to these studies were either those notified to the surveillance system or those attending antenatal care in public institutions, it is, however, possible that women with higher socioeconomic positions who had access to private healthcare are underrepresented in our sample. Nevertheless, any selection bias related to income is unlikely to have affected the generalizability of our results because there is no evidence that the frequency of adverse outcomes in children born to women who were infected during pregnancy is related to socioeconomic status. Furthermore, ZIKV transmission is related to socioeconomic conditions and infection occurred mainly in more deprived populations.50,51 Other sources of selection bias (e.g., refusal to participate and losses to follow-up of the pregnancies) are also unlikely to have substantially distorted our results as they occurred before the end of pregnancy (i.e., before many of the congenital manifestations could be evaluated).51 In relation to information bias, there may have been some degree of inaccuracy in the measurement of the head circumference leading to the misclassification of microcephaly, especially in moderate microcephaly. However, the consistency of the results of microcephaly at birth across studies suggests that this misclassification was not important. We did not compare the risks to those born to uninfected women as most of these cohorts did not follow pregnant women who tested negative for ZIKV infection during pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, this IPD-MA advances our understanding of the risks associated with ZIKV infections during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that approximately one-third of the children born to ZIKV-positive pregnant women present with at least one abnormality compatible with congenital infection; however, congenital abnormalities are more likely to present in isolation than in combination. Although abnormalities detected at birth appear to be largely permanent, our findings suggest that manifestations may evolve and present later in infant life, as the immature nervous system at birth becomes myelinated. We suggest further studies, with longer follow-up, to expand the understanding of the manifestations of the CZS: i) for children with microcephaly, in addition to the estimation of the risks of hospitalization and death at different ages, a deeper investigation by specialists using more advanced diagnostic tools may identify other complications that may either appear or become more evident later in life; ii) for children without microcephaly, the study of the risk of manifestations related to neuropsychomotor and behavioural development that may only be diagnosed as children become older, using specific tools. Notably, birth evaluations may underestimate the risk of ZIKV-related microcephaly, as approximately 1.5% of children may develop microcephaly postnatally. Finally, the risks of adverse outcomes associated with ZIKV infections during pregnancy do not appear to be modified across geographic, educational (i.e., a proxy of socioeconomic position), or racial/ethnic groups. By harmonizing and jointly analyzing individual-level data from 13 cohorts of pregnant women with ZIKV infections in Brazil, this study generates the most robust evidence to date on the risks of congenital ZIKV infections over the early life course."
