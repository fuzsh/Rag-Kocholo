        "text": "Lucas Moura is a 2012 Olympic silver medalist who represented Brazil at the Games in London, where he played in three matches as a substitute, including the gold medal match against Mexico. After his junior career with Brazil, Lucas made his senior international début in 2011 in a friendly match against Scotland, and later in the year, he scored his first international goal against Argentina. Lucas was named to the squad for the 2011 Copa America in Argentina, appearing in the group stage matches against Paraguay and Ecuador as a second-half substitute on both occasions. Lucas did not feature in Brazil’s penalty shoot-out defeat to Paraguay in the quarter-finals, which eliminated Brazil from the competition.\n\nProfessionally, Lucas made his début with the São Paulo first-team in 2010, scoring four goals and had four assists in 25 appearances. In 2011, he scored nine goals and had four assists in 28 appearances in the Campeonato Brasileiro, and 13 goals and eight assists in all competitions. In August 2012, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) made the club’s most expensive signing for Lucas and he joined the team as a right-winger in 2013, making his début in January of that year against AC Ajaccio.\n\nBorn in São Paolo, Brazil, Lucas began his youth career with Juventus-SP in 1999 at age seven."
