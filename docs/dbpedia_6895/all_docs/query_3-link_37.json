        "text": "Eduardo Souto de Moura (born July 25, 1952, Porto, Portugal) is a Portuguese architect known for integrating the clean lines of minimalism with such non-minimal elements as colour and the use of local materials. In 2011 he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, whose jury cited the “intelligence and seriousness” of his work and noted that his architecture “appears effortless, serene, and simple.”\n\nSouto de Moura attended the Porto Higher Institute of Fine Arts (Escola Superior de Belas Artes do Porto [ESBAP]; now part of the University of Porto), where he initially studied sculpture. By his own account, he changed his focus to architecture after meeting the American minimalist artist Donald Judd, who appreciated the communal nature of architecture as opposed to what he considered the solitary work of sculpting. Souto de Moura worked briefly with architect Noé Dinis and then for five years (1975–79) with the firm of Álvaro Siza, a leading influence (as was Ludwig Mies van der Rohe) and himself a Pritzker Prize winner. Although Souto de Moura established his own company in 1980, he and Siza enjoyed their collaboration and continued to work together on several projects. These included the wooden canopy for the 2005 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion, London, as well as the renovation of the Municipal Museum Abade Pedrosa and an addition to house the International Contemporary Sculpture Museum (2016), both in Santo Tirso, Portugal. Beginning in 1980, Souto de Moura also taught architecture at his alma mater.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nArchitecture: The Built World\n\nSouto de Moura’s first major commission was the Municipal Market in Braga, Portugal (1984; remodeled as a cultural centre by the architect in 2001). He then won a competition to design the cultural centre Casa das Artes in Porto (1991). The building uses such diverse materials as copper, stone, concrete, and wood, to pleasing effect. In the following years Souto de Moura steadily engaged in building single-family houses, mostly in northern Portugal, and these notably included House Number Two (1994) in Braga. Constructed of concrete terraces on a hillside, the home offers space for gardens and a pool. He also converted an abandoned Cistercian monastery into an elegant inn, the Pousada de Santa Maria do Bouro in Amares (1997)."
