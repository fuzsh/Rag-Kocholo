        "text": "Your story in 10 lines\n\nMy name is Renata Moura, I was born in 1990 in the city of Salvador, state of Bahia, Brazil ‚Äì one of Brazil‚Äôs most beautiful and culturally peculiar cities. In 2006, I did an exchange program in the Central Coast, a suburb area of Sydney, Australia, for one year. In 2009, tired of living in the wonderful but provincial Salvador, I moved to S√£o Paulo, where, in 2012, I graduated in Journalism at the C√°sper L√≠bero University. Although I loved the course, since the first year of school I‚Äôve been working with cultural production. Starting with projects that combined art and education, than at the Museum of Modern Art in S√£o Paulo, working with sponsorships, and then, tired of the whole business environment, in 2011, I jumped back to production and started working with exhibitions. Since 2013 I‚Äôve been a freelancer in this area, working with museums, cultural institutions and artists inside and outside Brazil.\n\nYou‚Äôve recently undertaken a long trip all around Europe ‚Äì and maybe you‚Äôd loved to go even further and beyond ‚Äì to search for your place in this world. What did you achieve on your way and what are your feelings once back?\n\nSince I was very little, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by travelling the world and living in different places. I have this intuition that at some point of my life I will move again to somewhere outside Brazil. The reason I haven‚Äôt moved again yet is because I‚Äôve never felt that ‚Äúclick‚Äù of when would be the right time to go and what would I be doing there ‚Äì if I wanted to work with what I already do, with something completely different or doing a master (in this case, in what?).\n\nI‚Äôve just been back from this trip around Europe and now that I‚Äôm in S√£o Paulo again I realised how much I love this city, the people and everything I‚Äôve built here. During my trip I realised that I do love what I work with and decided to keep working with art production, at least for this period (or until the end of this next exhibition I‚Äôm working on!). In fact, I think this was one of the most important things I‚Äôve achieved in this trip: to have patience and trust in the course of life. Before going to Europe I was very anxious about what was I doing about my life, professionally and ‚Äúpersonally‚Äù. But travelling for three months without plans and only knowing where to go for the very next destination was really good for me. Living each city, each country, each village, getting to know all sorts of people with different ways of living without thinking about ‚Äúthe future‚Äù or what would I do with this. Being in the famous ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù. This fulfilled my soul and opened my eyes about how amazing is enjoying the very present.\n\nWhich encounters do you normally have in your daily work routine?\n\nI really cannot complain about my daily routine. The office I‚Äôm working for right now is in a great area in S√£o Paulo called Vila Madalena (Madalena Village) where lots of art galleries, independent fashion shops, little restaurants, music studios are based, so it‚Äôs nice to walk around and meet people we know all the time. I also love all the girls I work with and by being a freelancer, if I take care of my responsibilities, I can be free to work from wherever I feel like.\n\nHow hard is it to start ‚Äì if you‚Äôll go for this option in your country ‚Äì to an entrepreneurial activity as cultural producer?\n\nI don‚Äôt know if I plan to do this for ‚Äúthe rest of my life‚Äù. Also the big production companies we have in S√£o Paulo, which would be like less than eight, usually hire freelancers for each project because all the exhibitions are temporary (some for longer than others), so it‚Äôs easier to have people working according to the demand.\n\nWhat is your city giving to you and viceversa?\n\nI‚Äôve loved S√£o Paulo since I moved here six years ago. Considering the fair proportions, S√£o Paulo could be like South America‚Äôs New York. We have a diversity of people coming, going, staying. S√£o Paulo hosts the largest Japanese and Italian colonies outside the respective countries and one of the three largest Syrian-Lebanese colonies as well. Apart from that we have Jewish, Korean, Chinese, Haitians, Nigerians, Peruvians, Bolivians, people from other parts of Brazil ‚Äì mostly from the North-eastern side, like me ‚Äì etc. So this means the circulation and exchange of ideas is really intense and this also makes the city more plural, less provincial, with more opportunities and culturally richer.\n\nSince two years ago, a fair part of S√£o Paulo‚Äôs population has been engaged in a movement of ‚Äúspreading love‚Äù to the city, making it nicer for its own inhabitants. The City Hall and the new Mayor are also part of this. So doing things like occupying areas of the city that were not really used before and making them nice places to stay instead of just passing by, making new squares and parks, promoting more free cultural events, making partnerships with artists to propose urban interventions, trying to make people walk more, cycle more and use more public transportation instead of driving, etc. Being a part of this moment of change is really exciting.\n\nDescribe a wonderful happening you have had recently\n\nIn the beginning of my trip around Europe, I spent three weeks in Denmark doing a program called WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms ‚Äì see www.wwoof.net). I stayed in a farm near Ribe (old historical capital of Denmark ‚Äì editors‚Äô note), working in the garden, with flowers, cooking, painting stuff in exchange of a place to sleep and all the meals.\n\nIn that place there was this nice smiling guy that didn‚Äôt talk much and whom I would see every now and then cutting the grass on one of those ‚Äúlittle cars‚Äù. He would cut the grass chanting a mantra like a Tibetan monk. One day I decided to chat with him and I found out he was quite an authority in a famous Danish Buddhist Centre, but who had retired of his job because he would get too stressed of travelling for doing the speeches. I also discovered he is from the same Buddhist School of Milarepa, an ancient Tibetan Buddhist teacher from the XII Century and whom I‚Äôve followed the teachings since a long time ago. When he found out I was a ‚Äúdevotee‚Äù of Milarepa, he got really excited, invited me for tea in his house after lunch. He taught me a lot more about Milarepa, lent me some sacred scriptures for me to study while I was there. They were so beautiful. I‚Äôm really grateful to all the amazing people I‚Äôve met in this trip.\n\nCan you share your favourite cooking passion?\n\nI love making things that take a long time to cook, traditional and old recipes and with a lot of spices. I‚Äôm passionate about the whole ritual of cooking, especially with more women in the kitchen, talking about the secrets of the spices. These things make the food have soul.\n\nMy favourite type of food of all times is the food from Bahia (my region in Brazil). For me, the ‚Äúdend√™‚Äù oil ‚Äì one of our main ingredients, which is a palm oil ‚Äì is something that the great god almighty himself made from a drop of paradise! ‚ÄúDend√™‚Äù is the best thing in life and if I stay without it for a long time I become sick. Cooking with it is just like making a potion with the sun itself. Oh well, now after declaring all my love for the ‚Äúdend√™‚Äù, I can say I also love cooking all the Mediterranean food (Italian, Lebanese, Greek, Moroccan, Spanish, Portuguese‚Ä¶), Indian and Thai. All of them that have that aspect of rituality, of getting the seasoning perfectly right and slow, slow cooking.\n\nWhich is your favourite wine or drink?\n\nWine, always wine. Any wine, red wine, white wine, dessert wine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a devotee of Dionysus.\n\nWhich is your music or the book(s) with you now?\n\nI listen to a lot of Brazilian music, especially from the ‚ÄúTropicalia Movement‚Äù, a cultural movement that emerged during our dictatorship period between the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs: Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Z√©, Gal Costa, Maria Beth√¢nia‚Ä¶ and traditional music from the North Eastern part of Brazil.\n\nAs for books, I‚Äôm in a period of reading authors from Portuguese speaking African countries, mostly from Angola and Mozambique. My favourite ones are Jos√© Eduardo Agualusa, Mya Couto, Ondjaki and Valter Hugo M√£e.\n\nIn which way do you try to live ‚Äúslow‚Äù, if you like to do so, in a city as yours?\n\nI say to everyone that I have found Jesus in yoga üôÇ It‚Äôs funny but yoga actually cured my insomnia and the anxiety crises I used to have. So yes, yoga, meditation and spiritual practices from a few Brazilian religions.\n\nWhich is a talent you have and the one you miss?\n\nI think I‚Äôm good at talking, helping and taking care of other people and I‚Äôm also fast on solving problems but I have to admit I miss some discipline and I‚Äôm quite disorganized. Oh, but surprisingly I‚Äôm quite organized when I cook.\n\nWhat have you learnt from life until now?\n\nOh wow, so much! One of the most important things I‚Äôve learnt this year is about reflections: everything is the same inside and outside and the way I see the world and other people is a reflection of how I see myself. This really works, and is amazing."
