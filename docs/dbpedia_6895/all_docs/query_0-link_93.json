        "text": "Anthropometric methods for obesity screening in schoolchildren: the Ouro Preto Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCÃ¡ndido, A P C; Alosta, J P S; Oliveira, C T; Freitas, R N; Freitas, S N; Machado-Coelho, G L L\n\n2012-01-01\n\nChildhood obesity is increasing dramatically in last decades. To evaluate the usefulness of body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness (ST), waist circumference (WC), and foot-to-foot bioelectrical impedance (BIA-FF) for screening for obesity in mixed-race population, using the tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance (BIA-T) technique as reference method. A cross-sectional-based population study was performed in the city of Ouro Preto, Brazil, in 2006. Schoolchildren aged 6-15 years (n = 788) was randomly selected according to age and sex stratified by the proportion of students in each schools of the city. Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define the sensitivity and specificity for each method studied using the tetrapolar method as reference. The BMI and the BIA-FF were the most suitable for adiposity screening in pre-pubertal and pubertal stages because they present a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, and smaller misclassification. For post-pubertal boys, the BF-ST-D was the best body fat assessment method. The results suggest that BIA-FF and BMI are choice methods for obesity screening in mixed population and that the method choice for body fat screening must be done according to sexual maturity of boys and girls. The present study demonstrates the need to perform studies in wider mixed-race population to determine anthropometric parameters and to examine the predictive ability of methods and cut-offs here elucidated in the development of obesity.\n\nArsenic in the groundwater of Ouro Preto (Brazil): its temporal behavior as influenced by the hydric regime and hydrogeology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonÃ§alves, JosÃ© Augusto Costa; de Lena, Jorge Carvalho; Paiva, JosÃ© Fernando; Nalini, HermÃ­nio Arias; Pereira, Janice Cardoso\n\n2007-12-01\n\nIn the city of Ouro Preto (MG), water catchment for public supply originates from superficial drainage, springs, old abandoned mines and some driven wells. In the rocks of the region, As is originally found in gold-enriched sulphide-bearing mineral deposits. The weathering process introduces As into the hydrological system by dissolution of this element into the leachate. Measurement of the As content in the groundwater of some catchments was carried out during 1 year and these measurements demonstrated high As contentâup to 224 Î¼g L-1 of As(V)âduring the rainy season (the maximum concentration limit according to World Health Organization is 10 Î¼g L-1). Lower values were observed during the dry season and in some sampling stations, As was not even detected. The As concentration variability during 1 year shows a strict and direct relationship to seasonal and hydrological conditions. For city authorities, responsible for public water supply, it is necessary to perform a complete inventory of the water sources used and constantly monitor the As content in the water.\n\nDiversity of bees and their floral resources at altitudinal areas in the Southern EspinhaÃ§o Range, Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nAraÃºjo, VinÃ­cius A; Antonini, Yasmine; AraÃºjo, Ana P A\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Southern EspinhaÃ§o Range consists of large areas covered by quartzitic or metaliferous tropical altitudinal fields. The EspinhaÃ§o Range ecosystems are endangered by anthropic high impacts, particularly due to mining and urbanization. We conducted a one-year inventory of the bee flora and fauna at the quartzitic Ouro Branco Mountains and a two-year survey of the metaliferous Ouro Preto fields. The samples were collected twice a month, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The bees (677) belonged to 91 species, five families. The family Apidae was the richest and most abundant, followed by the Halictidae and Megachilidae. The bees visited 46 flowering plant species; the most visited plants were the Asteraceae (n = 220), the Malpighiaceae (n = 95), the Melastomataceae (n = 94), the Fabaceae (n = 78), and the Solanaceae (n = 63). Diversity was higher in Ouro Branco (H = 1.47) than in Ouro Preto (H = 1.17). The low richness and abundance of bees in our research site when compared to other Brazilian \"Cerrado\" areas can be due to the high altitude, low temperature, and low availability of flowers we found. \"Canga\" and rupestrian areas house fauna and flora species that are rare and threatened by extinction. The southern EspinhaÃ§o areas can, therefore, be given the status of permanent biodiversity preservation area.\n\nHighlights of the 8th International Veterinary Immunology Symposium\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nVeterinary immunologists have expanded understanding of the immune systems for our companion animals and developed new vaccines and therapeutics.

The state of Rondonia, located in the western Amazon Basin, best exemplifies the problems related to land-use changes because it has the highest rates of deforestation in the Amazon Basin. In order to identify the main land-use practices in Rondonia, interviews with local farmers were carried out in the central part of Rondonia, in the PIC (Integrated Colonization Project) Ouro Preto do Oeste. This is the oldest colonization project in the state. The governmental colonization programs attracted migrants to the area through the construction of roadsmoreÂ Â» and infrastructure necessary for the colonists to occupy the land for agricultural practices. The interviews were done on lots of the PIC Ouro Preto and in PAD Urupa to define the background of the colonists, their land-use practices, their economic situation, and their relationships with governmental institutions.Â«Â less\n\nEvaluation of microsatellite loci from libraries derived from the wild diploid 'Calcutta 4' and 'Ouro' banana cultivars.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilva, P R O; Jesus, O N J; Creste, S; Figueira, A; Amorim, E P; Ferreira, C F\n\n2015-09-25\n\nMicrosatellite markers have been widely used in the quantification of genetic variability and for genetic breeding in Musa spp. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the discriminatory power of microsatellite markers derived from 'Calcutta 4' and 'Ouro' genomic libraries, and to analyze the genetic variability among 30 banana accessions. Thirty-eight markers were used: 15 from the 'Ouro' library and 23 from the 'Calcutta 4' library. Genetic diversity was evaluated by considering SSR markers as both dominant markers because of the presence of triploid accessions, and co-dominant markers. For the dominant analysis, polymorphism information content (PIC) values for 44 polymorphic markers ranged from 0.063 to 0.533, with a mean value of 0.24. A dendrogram analysis separated the BGB-Banana accessions into 4 groups: the 'Ouro' and 'MuÃ­sa Tia' accessions were the most dissimilar (93% dissimilarity), while the most similar accessions were 'Pacovan' and 'Walha'. The mean genetic distance between samples was 0.74. For the analysis considering SSR markers as co-dominants, using only diploid accessions, two groups were separated based on their genome contents (A and B). The PIC values for the markers from the 'Calcutta 4' library varied from 0.4836 to 0.7886, whereas those from the 'Ouro' library ranged from 0.3800 to 0.7521. Given the high PIC values, the markers from both the libraries showed high discriminatory power, and can therefore be widely applied for analysis of genetic diversity, population structures, and linkage mapping in Musa spp.\n\nMolecular analysis of the rRNA genes of Babesia spp and Ehrlichia canis detected in dogs from RibeirÃo Preto, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOliveira, L.P.; Cardozo, G.P.; Santos, E.V.; Mansur, M.A.B.; Donini, I.A.N.; Zissou, V.G.; Roberto, P.G.; Marins, M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe partial DNA sequences of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia canis and the 16S rRNA gene of Ehrlichia canis detected in dogs from RibeirÃ£o Preto, Brazil, were compared to sequences from other strains deposited in GenBank. The E. canis strain circulating in RibeirÃ£o Preto is identical to other strains previously detected in the region, whereas the subspecies Babesia canis vogeli is the main Babesia strain circulating in dogs from RibeirÃ£o Preto.

To achieve this, we identified the difficulties faced by the Sistema de Garantia de Direitos Humanos da CrianÃ§a e do Adolescente (SGDHCA) implemented by the municipality which take care of this population. We also identified protective and promotion factors accomplished to empower them.Â The methodology used combines Deleuze and Guattari Cartography, Institutional Analysis and the Cross Training. This latter methodology was developed by a group of researchers of Douglas Institute, in Montreal, which we met through scientific co-operation with our laboratory. On account of the practical-theoric and co-participative activities with the professional network of Ouro Preto, we produced a detailed diagnosis of the SGDHCA and a document proposing short, medium and long-term strategies. As final result, we intend to help the local collective-the Forum Intersetorial da InfÃ¢ncia e Juventude-to develop a work plan from the proposed actions. In this paper we will concentrate the potential of the methodology used by presenting outcome from two important moments of the research: the discussions of successful and unsuccessful cases that elucidate the network operation and the potential and difficulties arising from the Rotation Positional, important technical of the Cross Training.\n\n[Accidents reported at the Workers' Reference Center in RibeirÃ£o Preto, southeastern Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nChiodi, MÃ´nica Bonagamba; Marziale, Maria Helena Palucci; Mondadori, RosÃ¢ngela Murari; Robazzi, Maria LÃºcia do Carmo Cruz\n\n2010-06-01\n\nThis is a quantitative, descriptive study that aims to investigate work-related injuries involving exposure to biomaterial among health workers in health care units in the city of RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Data was obtained from Work-Related Injury Report forms filled at the Worker's Health Reference Center in RibeirÃ£o Preto in 2005. A total of 1,665 work-related injuries (91.7%) were reported and 151 (8.3%) were diagnosed as occupational diseases. Of the 1,665 injuries reported, 480 (28.82%) affected workers working at health care units and 153 (31.87%) were associated to biological material exposure. The situational diagnosis of occupational accidents is relevant for the development of preventive strategies by worker's health services. The results of the present study provide major indicators that allow the organization of actions following the National Network for Workers' Comprehensive Health Care (RENAST) guidelines and effectively contribute for workers health promotion.\n\nHigh-resolution mapping reveals linkage between genes in common bean cultivar Ouro Negro conferring resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot diseases\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nRust, Anthracnose, and angular leaf spot are major diseases of common bean in the world and most particularly in the Americas and Africa, which are the largest common bean production regions of the world.

Rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot are major diseases of common bean in the Americas and Africa. The cultivar Ouro Negro has the Ur-14 gene that confers broad spectrum resistance to rust and the gene cluster Co-3 4 /Phg-3 containing two tightly linked genes conferring resistance to anthracnose and angular leaf spot, respectively. We used co-segregation analysis and high-throughput genotyping of 179 F 2:3 families from the RudÃ¡ (susceptible)Â ÃÂ Ouro Negro (resistant) cross-phenotyped separately with races of the rust and anthracnose pathogens. The results confirmed that Ur-14 and Co-3 4 /Phg-3 cluster in Ouro Negro conferred resistance to rust and anthracnose, respectively, and that Ur-14 and the Co-3 4 /Phg-3 cluster were closely linked. Genotyping the F 2:3 families, first with 5398 SNPs on the Illumina BeadChip BARCBEAN6K_3 and with 15 SSR, and eight KASP markers, specifically designed for the candidate region containing Ur-14 and Co-3 4 /Phg-3, permitted the creation of a high-resolution genetic linkage map which revealed that Ur-14 was positioned at 2.2Â cM from Co-3 4 /Phg-3 on the short arm of chromosome Pv04 of the common bean genome. Five flanking SSR markers were tightly linked at 0.1 and 0.2Â cM from Ur-14, and two flanking KASP markers were tightly linked at 0.1 and 0.3Â cM from Co-3 4 /Phg-3. Many other SSR, SNP, and KASP markers were also linked to these genes. These markers will be useful for the development of common bean cultivars combining the important Ur-14 and Co-3 4 /Phg-3 genes conferring resistance to three of the most destructive diseases of common bean.\n\n[Use of macroalgae for the evaluation of organic pollution in the Preto river, northwest of SÃ£o Paulo State].\n\nPubMed\n\nNecchi JÃºnior, O; Branco, H Z; Dip, M R\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe Preto River, located in the northwest of SÃ£o Paulo State, receives a total wastewater load of 15.150 kg DBO day-1, from which 13.685 kg DBO day-1 (90.5%) corresponds to domestic sewage, and the city of SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto contributes with 12.400 kg DBO day-1 (90% of domestic sewage). During the period from August 1990 through January 1991, monthly sampling was carried out to evaluate the use of macroalgae as bioindicator of organic pollution. Five sampling sites were established along the main river and the following variables were analised: temperature, conductance, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, BOD, COD, total and fecal coliforms, and composition and abundance of macroalgal communities. Data were submitted to analysis of variance, correlation coefficient, cluster analysis (four different approaches) and converted to biological indices (species deficit, relative pollution, saprobity, diversity and uniformity indices). A wide range in water quality was found (particularly for conductance, oxygen, BOD and COD) among the sampling sites, which were classified into three groups (polluted, moderately polluted and unpolluted/weakly polluted). As regards the occurrence and abundance of macroalgae the Rhodophyta were found only in unpolluted or weakly polluted sites, whereas Cyanophyta occurred mostly under high pollution load; the Chlorophyta species were observed under a wide range of conditions. Among the biological indices, saprobity was the most sensitive and correlated to all water variables and the other indices. Cluster analyses showed that the composition of macroalgal communities was consistent with the levels of organic pollution in the Preto River.\n\n[Health care reform and changes in nursing practice in philanthropic hospitals in RibeirÃ£o Preto (SP), Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nCorrÃªa, A K; Ferraz, C A; GalvÃ£o, C M; Zanetti, M L; Dantas, R A\n\n2000-09-01\n\nThis paper describes part of a multicenter study sponsored by the Pan American Health Organization to assess health care reforms and their implications for nursing in several countries. The objective of this research was to learn the views of nurses working in philanthropic hospitals in RibeirÃ£o Preto, in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, regarding the changes in nursing practice coming from Brazil's health care reform and implementation of the Unified Health System (UHS). Data were obtained through structured interviews with seven nurses who met the selection criteria, from the three philanthropic hospitals in RibeirÃ£o Preto. The nurses reported a decline in the quality of care and in the number of beds for UHS patients. The nurses reported that UHS implementation initially led to infrastructure improvements in the philanthropic hospitals. However, the reforms eventually shifted toward improving the care of private and privately insured patients. In addition, the nurses emphasized their heavy work loads and low pay. The nurses' reports indicated that Brazil's UHS is going through a crisis. In general, the nurses linked this crisis to problems in funding and allocation of resources.\n\nEvaluation of areas prepared for planting using LANDSAT data. M.S. Thesis; [Ribeirao Preto, Brazil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParada, N. D. J. (Principal Investigator); Deassuncao, G. V.; Duarte, V.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThree different algorithms (SINGLE-CELL, MAXVER and MEDIA K) were used to automatically interpret data from LANDSAT observations of an area of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. Photographic transparencies were obtained, projected and visually interpreted. The results show that: (1) the MAXVER algorithm presented a better classification performance; (2) verification of the changes in cultivated areas using data from the three different acquisition dates was possible; (3) the water bodies, degraded lands, urban areas, and fallow fields were frequently mistaken by cultivated soils; and (4) the use of projected photographic transparencies furnished satisfactory results, besides reducing the time spent on the image-100 system.\n\nThe visual ecology of a deep-sea fish, the escolar Lepidocybium flavobrunneum (Smith, 1843)â\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLandgren, Eva; Fritsches, Kerstin; Brill, Richard; Warrant, Eric\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEscolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, family Gempylidae) are large and darkly coloured deep-sea predatory fish found in the cold depths (more than 200 m) during the day and in warm surface waters at night. They have large eyes and an overall low density of retinal ganglion cells that endow them with a very high optical sensitivity. Escolar have banked retinae comprising six to eight layers of rods to increase the optical path length for maximal absorption of the incoming light. Their retinae possess two main areae of higher ganglion cell density, one in the ventral retina viewing the dorsal world above (with a moderate acuity of 4.6 cycles degâ1), and the second in the temporal retina viewing the frontal world ahead. Electrophysiological recordings of the flicker fusion frequency (FFF) in isolated retinas indicate that escolar have slow vision, with maximal FFF at the highest light levels and temperatures (around 9 Hz at 23Â°C) which fall to 1â2 Hz in dim light or cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that escolar are slowly moving sit-and-wait predators. In dim, warm surface waters at night, their slow vision, moderate dorsal resolution and highly sensitive eyes may allow them to surprise prey from below that are silhouetted in the downwelling light. PMID:24395966\n\nA current perspective on availability of tools, resources and networks for veterinary immunology.\n\nPubMed\n\nEntrican, Gary; Lunney, Joan K; Rutten, Victor P; Baldwin, Cynthia L\n\n2009-03-15\n\nThere are many diseases of fish, livestock and companion animals that impact negatively on animal health, welfare and productivity and for which there are no effective vaccines. The development of new vaccines is reliant on the availability of well-characterised immunological tools and reagents to understand host-pathogen interactions and identify protective immune responses. Veterinary immunology has always lagged behind mouse and human immunology in terms of development and availability of tools and reagents. However, several initiatives are underway to address this. The Veterinary Immunology Committee (VIC) Toolkit was initiated 6 years ago at the sixth International Veterinary Immunology Symposium (IVIS) in Uppsala and in the intervening period there have been several notable developments that have advanced reagent development and information exchange. This review will discuss advances in veterinary reagent development, networks, databases and commercial availability with particular reference to the second VIC Toolkit workshop held at the eighth IVIS in Ouro Preto, Brazil on the 15th of August 2007.\n\nPerinatal outcomes and changes in the oral cavity: Brazilian cohorts of RibeirÃ£o Preto and SÃ£o LuÃ­s.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomaz, Ãrika BÃ¡rbara Abreu Fonseca; Alves, ClÃ¡udia Maria CoÃªlho; Ribeiro, CecÃ­lia ClÃ¡udia Costa; Batista, RosÃ¢ngela Fernandes Lucena; SimÃµes, Vanda Maria Ferreira; Cavalli, Ricardo; Saraiva, Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o; Cardoso, Viviane Cunha; Bettiol, Heloisa; Barbieri, Marco Antonio; da Silva, AntÃ´nio Augusto Moura\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStudies have shown a possible association of oral diseases during pregnancy with preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW). These perinatal outcomes appear to be associated with enamel defects in the primary dentition, which, in turn, seem to predispose to future development of caries in children. Therefore it is relevant to include oral health variables of the mother/child dyad in cohort studies to understand how these factors are associated. The objectives of this study are: 1) check if there is an association between diseases of the oral cavity of pregnant women and PTB, 2) test the hypothesis of association between perinatal outcomes and enamel defects/dental caries in children, 3) examine whether there are associations between perinatal outcomes and disorders of tooth eruption in children; 4) build theoretical models to study social inequities as a common factor between oral conditions and perinatal outcomes. We used an integrated, collaborative approach between two Brazilian cities with contrasting socioeconomic conditions: Sao Luis , MA, and RibeirÃ£o Preto, SP - British Birth Cohort Studies study (BRISA RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o LuÃ­s). Two cohorts were evaluated: one initiated at birth, representative of the population of live births, and another, initiated prenatally. Participants were reassessed from the beginning of the second year of life. It is expected that these cohorts will contribute to foster the development and consolidation of population-based follow-up studies in Brazil.\n\nDevelopment of the Inventario de Comportamiento Escolar (IDCE) for Puerto Rican Children.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBauermeister, Jose J.; And Others\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe \"Inventario de Comportamiento Escolar\" is a teacher rating inventory for the assessment of Puerto Rican children, particularly those with a behavior pattern indicative of attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, or academic underachievement.

AstrofÃ­sica Escolar: Brincando com Dados Observacionais\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNavone, Hugo D.; Scancich, Miriam; VÃ¡zquez, RubÃ©n A.\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe use of observational records in the design of teaching sequences in Astrophysics in High Schools is quite uncommon. It is also uncommon the thematic approach within the context provided by Nature of Science. Besides these shortcomings, we should also consider the lack of proposals to use the computer as a laboratory from which nature is studied. These aspects expose the existence of a disconnection between school science and scientist's science, establishing the need for simple educational projects that promote interdisciplinary dialogue between the two fields of knowledge. Based on these assumptions, this paper presents the school reformulation of the redshift-distance problem as addressed by Hubble in his diagram, and explores the main educational dimensions emerging from it. The proposal is directed not only for senior students of high school and/or early 1st year students at University level, but also for students and teachers from teacher training colleges. Practical evidence shows that this proposal is viable, mobilizes interests about issues of Astrophysics and promotes a ludic and cooperative character among students. La utilizaciÃ³n de registros observacionales en el diseÃ±o de secuencias didÃ¡cticas en AstrofÃ­sica Escolar no es algo usual en el Ã¡mbito de la escuela media. Tampoco lo es el abordaje de temÃ¡ticas desde el contexto que provee Naturaleza de la Ciencia. A estas carencias se le suma la falta de propuestas que hagan intervenir a la computadora como un laboratorio desde el cual se interpela a la naturaleza. Los aspectos mencionados exponen la existencia de un desajuste entre ciencia escolar y ciencia experta estableciendo la necesidad de elaborar proyectos educativos sencillos que promuevan el diÃ¡logo interdisciplinar entre ambos campos del conocimiento.

Multispectral scanner data for Brasilia was corrected for atmospheric interference using the LOWTRAN-3 computer program and the analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation. This improved the contrast between two natural targets and the corrected images of two different dates were more similar than the original ones. Corrected images of MSS data for Ribeirao Preto gave a classification accuracy for sugar cane about 10% higher as compared to the original images.\n\nFactors associated with failure of clinical screening among blood donors who have altered serological results in the Centro Regional de Hemoterapia de RibeirÃ£o Preto\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFerreira, Oranice; Passos, Afonso Dinis Costa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective This study aimed to investigate the frequency of positive results for hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis in blood donations at the Centro Regional de Hemoterapia de RibeirÃ£o Preto, to describe donors with positive results according to some demographic and socioeconomic variables, to identify risk factors associated to these donors and the reasons that they were not detected during clinical screening. Methods A descriptive study was performed between July 1st 2005 and July 31st 2006 by interviewing 106 donorsafter medical consultations where they were informed of positive results for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or syphilis. Results There was a predominance of first-time donors, males, under 50-year olds, married individuals, from RibeirÃ£o Preto, with elementary education, low economic status and of people who donated at the request of friends or relatives. Hepatitis C was the most frequently detected infection (56.6%), followed by hepatitis B (20.7%), HIV (12.3%) and syphilis(10.4%). About 40% of donors had omitted risk factors for different reasons: because they trusted the results of serological tests, did not feel comfortable about talking of risk factors or did not consider them relevant. Other justifications were the duration of the interview, the interviewer was unskilled, embarrassment and doubts about confidentiality. Conclusion The results indicate the need for changes in the approach to clinical screening and a review of methods to attract and guide potential donors.

We selected the dengue autochthonous cases that occurred between September 2005 and August 2007 in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto to calculate incidence rates by month, year and census tracts. The monthly incidence rates of the city were compared to the monthly Breteau indices (BI) of the SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Region. Between December 2006 and February 2007, an entomological survey was conducted to collect immature forms of Aedes aegypti in JaguarÃ©, a SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto neighborhood, and to obtain entomological indices. These indices were represented using statistical interpolation. To represent the occurrence of dengue in the JaguarÃ© neighborhood in 2006 and 2007, we used the Kernel ratio and to evaluate the relationship between dengue and the entomological indices, we used a generalized additive model in a spatial case-control design. Between September 2005 and August 2007, the occurrence of dengue in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto was almost entirely caused by DENV3, and the monthly incidence rates presented high correlation coefficients with the monthly BI. In JaguarÃ© neighborhood, the entomological indices calculated by hectare were better predictors of the spatial distribution of dengue than the indices calculated by properties, but the pupae quantification did not show better prediction qualities than the indices based on the container positivity, in relation to the risk of dengue occurrence. The fact that the municipality's population had a high susceptibility to the serotype DENV3 before the development of this research, along with the almost total predominance of the occurrence of this serotype between 2005 and 2007, facilitated the analysis of the epidemiological situation of the disease and allowed us to connect it to the entomological indicators.

However, these correlation equations have been based in rock masses with different characteristics when compared to Brazilian rock masses. This paper aims to study the applicability of the geomechanical classifications to obtain strength parameters of three Brazilian rock masses. Four classification systems have been used; the Rock Mass Rating (RMR), the Rock Mass Quality (Q), the Geological Strength Index (GSI) and the Rock Mass Index (RMi). A strong rock mass and two soft rock masses with different degrees of weathering located in the cities of Ouro Preto and Mariana, Brazil; were selected for the study. Correlation equations were used to estimate the strength properties of these rock masses. However, such correlations do not always provide compatible results with the rock mass behavior. For the calibration of the strength values obtained through the use of classification systems, ââstability analyses of failures in these rock masses have been done. After calibration of these parameters, the applicability of the various correlation equations found in the literature have been discussed. According to the results presented in this paper, some of these equations are not suitable for the studied rock masses.\n\nEstudio participativo para el desarrolllo de un instrumento de observaciÃ³n de violencia escolar\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMedina Santiago, Nilda G.; Rivera, Tania Cruz; RodrÃ­guez, Maryanes Trenche; BÃ¡ez Ãvila, Loggina S.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLa violencia en las escuelas es reconocida como un problema de salud pÃºblica a nivel mundial que impacta negativamente el proceso de enseÃ±anza-aprendizaje.

Special attention is paid to the process by which the Spanish group, with the support of the new Superior National Research Council, made contact with the German morphology being developed by Hugo Spatz (1888-1979) at the Max Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Hirnforschung. Our study reveals the numerous influences that finally led to the anatomy and embryology of Escolar. In Spain, we found a direct influence of the Gegenbaurian morphology of Gumersindo SÃ¡nchez Guisande (1894-1976) and the neuroanatomy of Juan JosÃ© Barcia Goyanes (1901-2003), full of references to studies by Braus. International contacts of the \"Escolarian group\", first with North America and then with Germany, created a homogeneous group with a single anatomy (functional and ontophylogenetic) but with so many research interests that subspecialisations had to be developed. An important embryological work resulted from an intense relationship with the German anatomical community during the 1950s. Escolar worked in this field on the development of the amygdala and allocortex, Fernando Reinoso studied the embryology of the diencephalon and Smith Victor Agreda, along with the German scientist Rudolf Diepen, made some important discoveries on the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary system.\n\nPREFACE: VII Brazilian Congress on Metrology (Metrologia 2013)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCosta-FÃ©lix, Rodrigo; Bernardes, Americo; Valente de Oliveira, JosÃ© Carlos; Mauro Granjeiro, JosÃ©; Epsztejn, Ruth; Ihlenfeld, Waldemar; SmarÃ§aro da Cunha, Valnei\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSEVENTH BRAZILIAN CONGRESS ON METROLOGY (METROLOGIA 2013) Metrology and Quality for a Sustainable Development From November 24th to 27th 2013 was issued the Seventh Brazilian Congress on Metrology (Metrologia 2013), which is a biannual conference organized and sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Metrology (SBM) and the Brazilian National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (Inmetro). This edition was held in the charming and historical city of Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil, and aimed to join people and institutions devoted to the dissemination of the metrology and conformity assessment. The Metrologia 2013 Conference consisted of Keynote Speeches (7) and regular papers (204). Among the regular papers, the 47 most outstanding ones, comprising a high quality content on Metrology and Conformity Assessment, were selected to be published in this issue of the Journal of Physics: Conference Series. The topics of the conference covered all important areas of Metrology, which were agglutinated in the following sessions in the present issue: .

The population was a representative sample aged 60 and older, from three different socio-economic classes. Cluster sampling was applied. Instruments used to select CFI (a syndromic category that does not exclude dementia): 'Mini Mental State Examination' (MMSE), 'Fuld Object Memory Evaluation' (FOME), 'Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly' (IQCODE), 'Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale' (B-ADL) and clinical interviews. The data obtained were submitted to bivariate and logistic regression analysis. A sample of 1.145 elderly persons was evaluated, with a mean age of 70.9 years (60-100; DP: 7.7); 63.4% were female, and 52.8% had up to 4 years of schooling. CFI prevalence was 18.9% (n = 217). Following logistic regression analysis, higher age, low education, stroke, epilepsy and depression were associated with CFI. Female sex, widowhood, low social class and head trauma were associated with CFI only on bivariate analysis. CFI prevalence results were similar to those found by studies in Brazil, Puerto Rico and Malaysia. Cognitive and functional impairment is a rather heterogeneous condition which may be associated with various clinical conditions found in the elderly population. Due to its high prevalence and association with higher mortality and disability rates, this clinical syndrome should receive more attention on public health intervention planning.\n\nHirsch's index: a case study conducted atthe Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras de RibeirÃ£o Preto, Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorro-Alves, N; Herculano, R D; TerÃ§ariol, C A S; Kinouchi Filho, O; Graeff, C F O\n\n2007-11-01\n\nAn analysis of scientific bibliographic productivity using the Hirsch h-index, information from the Institute of Scientific Information database and the Curriculum Lattes (CNPq, Brazil) was performed at the Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras de RibeirÃ£o Preto, Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) that has four departments in natural, biological and social sciences. Bibliometric evaluations of undergraduate programs showed a better performance of the departments of Chemistry (P < 0.001) and Biology (P < 0.001) when compared to the departments of Physics and Mathematics and Psychology and Education. We also analyzed the scientific output of the six graduate programs of FFCLRP: Psychology, Psychobiology, Chemistry, Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology, Comparative Biology, and Entomology. The graduate program in Psychology presented a lower h-index (P < 0.001) and had fewer papers indexed by the ISI web of science (P < 0.001) when compared to the other graduate programs. The poorer performance of the Psychology program may be associated with the limited coverage by the Thompson Institute of Scientific Information database.\n\nCost reduction with successful implementation of an antibiotic prophylaxis program in a private hospital in RibeirÃ£o Preto, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nFonseca, S N; Melon Kunzle, S R; Barbosa Silva, S A; Schmidt, J G; Mele, R R\n\n1999-01-01\n\nTo describe the implementation and results of a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) program. A protocol for correct use of PAP was implemented in December 1994. For selected months we measured the PAP protocol compliance of a random sample of clean and clean-contaminated procedures and calculated the cost of incorrect use of PAP. SELLING: A 180-bed general hospital in RibeirÃ£o Preto, Brazil. The cost of unnecessary PAP in the obstetric and gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and orthopedic services dropped from $4,224.54 ($23.47/procedure) in November 1994 to $1,147.24 ($6.17/procedure, January 1995), $544.42 ($3.58/procedure, May 1995), $99.06 ($0.50/procedure, August 1995), and $30 ($0.12/procedure, March 1996). In November 1994, only 13.6% of all surgical procedures were done with correct use of PAP, compared to 59% in January 1995, 73% in August 1995, 78% in March 1996, 92% in November 1996, and 98% in May 1997. Incorrect PAP use wastes resources, which is a particular problem in developing countries. Our program is simple and can be implemented without the use of computers and now is being adopted in other hospitals in our region. We credit the success of our program to the commitment of all participants and to the strong support of the hospital directors.\n\n[Knowledge and opinions concerning legal and ethical issues with abortion among physicians working in emergency wards in RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nLoureiro, David CÃ¢mara; Vieira, Elisabeth Meloni\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis study focused on the knowledge and opinions of physicians regarding legal and ethical aspects of abortion. A self-administered questionnaire was filled out by 57 physicians working in the emergency rooms of two hospitals in RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil in 2001. The questionnaire had 38 questions on general knowledge, legislation, and attitudes towards abortion. Interviewees' mean age was 28.3, most were females, 52.6% were single, 42.1% were married, 54.4% were Catholic, and 21% were Spiritists. Although most of the physicians had a good level of overall knowledge on abortion (70%), one in five was not aware that abortion is the main cause of maternal mortality in Brazil. Most accepted the prevailing legal conditions for performing an abortion in Brazil but would also include fetal malformation incompatible with life, while opposing decriminalization of abortion on other grounds. Limited knowledge is revealed by misconceptions concerning enforcement of the prevailing legislation in practice. The study strongly suggests that many physicians lack knowledge or face difficulties in conforming to the Brazilian legislation on abortion.\n\nPhenotypic and genetic features of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from diarrheal children in the RibeirÃ£o Preto metropolitan area, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPitondo-Silva, AndrÃ©; Nakazato, Gerson; FalcÃ£o, Juliana P; Irino, Kinue; Martinez, Roberto; Darini, Ana LÃºcia C; Hernandes, Rodrigo Tavanelli\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThis study was designed to characterize a collection of 60 enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) isolates from diarrheic feces of patients in the RibeirÃ£o Preto metropolitan area regarding different phenotypic and molecular features. We examined antibiotic resistance profiles, occurrence of virulence factors-encoding genes, intimin subtypes and the correlation of serotypes among typical (tEPEC) and atypical (aEPEC) EPEC isolates. The results demonstrated that atypical EPEC was more heterogeneous than typical EPEC concerning the characteristics investigated and 45.2% do not belong to classical EPEC serogroups. Intimin subtype Î² was the most frequent among the EPEC isolates (46.7%), being detected in both tEPEC and aEPEC. The majority of aEPEC isolates presented localized adherence-like (LAL) pattern to HEp-2 cells, although aEPEC isolates displaying diffuse adherence (DA) or non-adherent were also detected. High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was found for ampicillin, cephalothin, sulfonamide and tetracycline. In general, tEPEC isolates were more resistant to the antimicrobials tested than aEPEC isolates. Â© 2014 APMIS.

We also aimedÂ to identify sociodemographic and social support risk factors.Â TheÂ data collection wasÂ done using medical records, the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ-6), Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20)Â and home visits. Of the 272 families studied, 211 contained individuals with mental disorders, and 61 included individuals who had substance-related disorders, or both. The mental disorders recorded in these families were most frequently mood disorders, followed by neurotic disorders, stress-related disorders and somatoform disorders. Women received twice as many psychotropic prescriptions associated with non-psychiatric medication. A significant relationship was established between education and mental distress as measured using the SRQ-20 (pâ=â0.024). The SSQ-6 revealed a family presence of social support in all of the conditions established by the six questions.\n\nDengue Virus Type 3 Adaptive Changes during Epidemics in SÃ£o Jose de Rio Preto, Brazil, 2006â2007\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBosch, Irene; Schimitt, Diane; Calzavara-Silva, Carlos E.; de A Zanotto, Paolo M.; Nogueira, MaurÃ­cio L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGlobal dengue virus spread in tropical and sub-tropical regions has become a major international public health concern. It is evident that DENV genetic diversity plays a significant role in the immunopathology of the disease and that the identification of polymorphisms associated with adaptive responses is important for vaccine development. The investigation of naturally occurring genomic variants may play an important role in the comprehension of different adaptive strategies used by these mutants to evade the human immune system. In order to elucidate this role we sequenced the complete polyprotein-coding region of thirty-three DENV-3 isolates to characterize variants circulating under high endemicity in the city of SÃ£o JosÃ© de Rio Preto, Brazil, during the onset of the 2006-07 epidemic. By inferring the evolutionary history on a local-scale and estimating rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonimous (dN) substitutions, we have documented at least two different introductions of DENV-3 into the city and detected 10 polymorphic codon sites under significant positive selection (dN/dS > 1) and 8 under significant purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). We found several polymorphic amino acid coding sites in the envelope (15), NS1 (17), NS2A (11), and NS5 (24) genes, which suggests that these genes may be experiencing relatively recent adaptive changes. Furthermore, some polymorphisms correlated with changes in the immunogenicity of several epitopes. Our study highlights the existence of significant and informative DENV variability at the spatio-temporal scale of an urban outbreak.

This descriptive study was performed from February to October 2016 on 54 quantitative real-time PCR ZIKV-positive pregnant women identified by the public health authority of SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The women were followed and had clinical and epidemiologic data collected before and after birth. Adverse outcomes in newborns were analysed and reported. Urine or blood samples from newborns were collected to identify ZIKV infection by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 216 acute Zika-suspected pregnant women were identified, and 54 had the diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR. None of the 54 women miscarried. Among the 54 newborns, 15 exhibited adverse outcomes at birth. The highest number of ZIKV infections occurred during the second and third trimesters. No cases of microcephaly were reported, though a broad clinical spectrum of outcomes, including lenticulostriate vasculopathy, subependymal cysts, and auditory and ophthalmologic disorders, were identified. ZIKV RNA was detected in 18 of 51 newborns tested and in eight of 15 newborns with adverse outcomes. Although other studies have associated many newborn outcomes to ZIKV infection during pregnancy, these same adverse outcomes were rare or nonexistent in this study. The clinical presentation the newborns we studied was mild compared to other reports, suggesting that there is significant heterogeneity in congenital Zika infection.

The objective of this study was to identify the perception of relatives and acquaintances of drug users living in RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, about the country's laws and policies on drugs. Data collection was performed using a structured questionnaire. The sample consisted of 100 drug users' relatives or acquaintances, selected at a public health service. Respondents' relationships with the drug user were as follows: 31% friend, 23% sibling, 15% child and 7% spouse. Most users (78%) were men, with an average age of 26 years. Results confirm that national laws and policies have a direct effect on individuals' attitude and behaviors. There is a lack of trust in the police and a general perception that, despite recent chances that favor user rehabilitation, the laws on drugs do not respect users' human rights.\n\nImpacts of the Urbanization Process on Water Quality of Brazilian Savanna Rivers: The Case of Preto River in Formosa, GoiÃ¡s State, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPires, Nayara Luiz; Muniz, Daphne Heloisa de Freitas; Kisaka, Tiago Borges; Simplicio, Nathan de Castro Soares; Bortoluzzi, Lilian; Lima, Jorge Enoch Furquim Werneck; Oliveira-Filho, Eduardo Cyrino\n\n2015-08-31\n\nThe release of domestic sewage in water resources is a practical feature of the urbanization process, and this action causes changes that may impair the environmental balance and the water quality for several uses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of urbanization on the surface water quality of the Preto River throughout the town of Formosa, GoiÃ¡s, Brazil. Samples were collected at five points along the river, spatially distributed from one side to the other of the town of Formosa, from May to October of 2012. Data were subjected to descriptive statistics, as well as variance and cluster analysis. Point P2, the first point after the city, showed the worst water quality indicators, mainly with respect to the total and fecal coliform parameters, as well as nitrate concentrations. These results may be related to the fact that this point is located on the outskirts of the town, an area under urbanization and with problems of sanitation, including absence of sewage collection and treatment. The data observed in this monitoring present a public health concern because the water body is used for bathing, mainly in parts of Feia Lagoon. The excess of nutrients is a strong indicator of water eutrophication and should alert decision-makers to the need for preservation policies.\n\nBiodegradable seeds of holmium don't change neurological function after implant in brain of rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiniz, Mirla Fiuza; Ferreira, Diogo Milioli; de Lima, Wanderson Geraldo; Pedrosa, Maria Lucia; Silva, Marcelo EustÃ¡quio; de Almeida Araujo, Stanley; Sampaio, Kinulpe Honorato; de Campos, Tarcisio Passos Ribeiro; Siqueira, Savio Lana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the surgical procedure and parenchymal abnormalities related to implantation of ceramic seeds with holmium-165 in rats' brain. An effective method of cancer treatment is brachytherapy in which radioactive seeds are implanted in the tumor, generating a high local dose of ionizing radiation that can eliminate tumor cells while protecting the surrounding healthy tissue. Biodegradable Ho 166 -ceramic-seeds have been addressed recently. The experiments in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use at the Federal University of Ouro Preto, protocol number 2012/034. Twenty-one adult Fischer rats were divided into Naive Group, Sham Group and Group for seed implants (ISH). Surgical procedures for implantation of biodegradable seeds were done and 30 days after the implant radiographic examination and biopsy of the brain were performed. Neurological assays were also accomplished to exclude any injury resulting from either surgery or implantation of the seeds. Radiographic examination confirmed the location of the seeds in the brain. Neurological assays showed animals with regular spontaneous activity. The histological analysis showed an increase of inflammatory cells in the brain of the ISH group. Electron microscopy evidenced cytoplasmic organelles to be unchanged. Biochemical analyzes indicate there was neither oxidative stress nor oxidative damage in the ISH brain. CAT activity showed no difference between the groups as well as lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS. The analysis of the data pointed out that the performed procedure is safe as no animal showed alterations of the neurological parameters and the seeds did not promote histological architectural changes in the brain tissue.\n\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in different populations: A clinical and epidemiological study - sample of SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndrade, Gabriel Costa de; Fujise, Luciana Harumi; Santana, Jaime Euclides de; Oliveira, Fabiane; Silva, Rita de CÃ¡ssia Martins Alves da\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNAFLD is an heterogeneous condition that includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, reaching 30% of the population. The most common risk factors are: age, gender, ethnicity, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, predisposition, metabolic syndrome (MS), insulin resistance (IR), drugs, and polycystic ovary syndrome. To describe the profile of patients with NAFLD seen at Hospital de Base of Rio Preto, in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. Patients with NAFLD were assessed, with medical and epidemiological data collected after informed consent. Of the 62 patients evaluated, 76% were women, 73% Caucasians, and 71% were aged between 50 and 69 years and had no symptoms. Ultrasonography results showed steatosis in 84%. NASH was diagnosed in 61% of the sample. 21 patients underwent liver biopsy, of which 36% had cirrhosis, 1 had liver cancer, and 1 pure steatosis (5% each). Risk factors were found in 70% of patients with metabolic syndrome, 87% with increased waist circumference, 63% with dyslipidemia, 61% (n=38) with high blood pressure (HBP), 28% with DM, 52% physically inactive, and 44% with insulin resistance (IR) (HOMA> 3.5). There was an association between IR and NASH (p=0.013), IR and obesity (p=0.027), IR and MS (p=0.006), and MS and steatosis on medical ultrasound (USG) (p=0.014). The most frequent risk factors were MS and its variables: increased waist circumference, dyslipidemia and HBP. This underscores the importance of metabolic control in NAFLD and confirms its role as the hepatic component of metabolic syndrome.\n\n[Effects of the PROALCOOL program on migratory behavior in the state of Sao Paulo: the case of Ribeirao Preto].\n\nPubMed\n\n1983-01-01\n\nSao Paulo, particularly in the region of Ribeiros Preto.\n\nReemergence of yellow fever: detection of transmission in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, 2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoreno, Eduardo Stramandinoli; Rocco, Iray Maria; Bergo, Eduardo Sterlino; Brasil, Roosecelis Araujo; Siciliano, Melissa Mascheratti; Suzuki, Akemi; Silveira, Vivian Regina; Bisordi, Ivani; Souza, Renato Pereira de\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFollowing yellow fever virus (YFV) isolation in monkeys from the SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto region and two fatal human autochthonous cases from the RibeirÃ£o Preto region, State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, two expeditions for entomological research and eco-epidemiological evaluation were conducted. A total of 577 samples from humans, 108 from monkeys and 3,049 mosquitoes were analyzed by one or more methods: virus isolation, ELISA-IgM, RT-PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemical. Of the 577 human samples, 531 were tested by ELISA-IgM, with 3 positives, and 235 were inoculated into mice and 199 in cell culture, resulting in one virus isolation. One sample was positive by histopathology and immunohistochemical. Using RT-PCR, 25 samples were processed with 4 positive reactions. A total of 108 specimens of monkeys were examined, 108 were inoculated into mice and 45 in cell culture. Four virus strains were isolated from Alouatta caraya. A total of 931 mosquitoes were captured in Sao Jose do Rio Preto and 2,118 in RibeirÃ£o Preto and separated into batches. A single isolation of YFV was derived from a batch of 9 mosquitoes Psorophora ferox, collected in UrupÃªs, RibeirÃ£o Preto region. A serological survey was conducted with 128 samples from the municipalities of SÃ£o Carlos, RincÃ£o and RibeirÃ£o Preto and 10 samples from contacts of patients from RibeirÃ£o Preto. All samples were negative by ELISA-IgM for YFV. The results confirm the circulation of yellow fever, even though sporadic, in the Sao Paulo State and reinforce the importance of vaccination against yellow fever in areas considered at risk.\n\nInclusion of Visually Impaired in the School Programme Scheduled Visit of the Museu de Astronomia e CiÃªncias Afins (MAST).

The study was carried out in 2007 and surveyed tuberculosis patients treated in the primary care services in the cities of RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, ItaboraÃ­ (these three in Southeastern Brazil), Campina Grande and Feira de Santana (these two in Northeastern Brazil). The instrument 'Primary Care Assessment Tool' was used, adapted to assess tuberculosis care in Brazil. Tuberculosis diagnosis in the health services was assessed by means of multiple correspondence factor analysis. The accessibility to the diagnosis was represented by the dimensions 'locomotion to the health service' and 'assistance service' in the factorial plan. The patients from RibeirÃ£o Preto and ItaboraÃ­ were associated with more favorable conditions to the dimension 'locomotion to the health service' and the patients from Campina Grande and Feira de Santana were associated with less favorable conditions. RibeirÃ£o Preto presented more favorable conditions to the dimension 'assistance service', followed by ItaboraÃ­, Feira de Santana and Campina Grande. SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto presented less favorable conditions to both dimensions, 'locomotion to the health service' and 'assistance service', compared to the other cities. The factor analysis enabled the visualization of the organizational characteristics of the services that provide tuberculosis care. The decentralization of the actions to the family health program and reference centers seems not to present a satisfactory performance regarding accessibility to the tuberculosis diagnosis, as the form of services organization was not a determinant factor to guarantee the accessibility to the early diagnosis of the illness.\n\nValidity of pre and post-term birth rates based on the date of last menstrual period compared to early obstetric ultrasonography.\n\nPubMed\n\nMedeiros, Maria Nilza Lima; Cavalcante, NÃ¡dia Carenina Nunes; Mesquita, FabrÃ­cio JosÃ© Alencar; Batista, RosÃ¢ngela Lucena Fernandes; SimÃµes, Vanda Maria Ferreira; Cavalli, Ricardo de Carvalho; Cardoso, Viviane Cunha; Bettiol, Heloisa; Barbieri, Marco Antonio; Silva, AntÃ´nio Augusto Moura da\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the validity of the last menstrual period (LMP) estimate in determining pre and post-term birth rates, in a prenatal cohort from two Brazilian cities, SÃ£o LuÃ­s and RibeirÃ£o Preto. Pregnant women with a single fetus and less than 20 weeks' gestation by obstetric ultrasonography who received prenatal care in 2010 and 2011 were included. The LMP was obtained on two occasions (at 22-25 weeks gestation and after birth). The sensitivity of LMP obtained prenatally to estimate the preterm birth rate was 65.6% in SÃ£o LuÃ­s and 78.7% in RibeirÃ£o Preto and the positive predictive value was 57.3% in SÃ£o LuÃ­s and 73.3% in RibeirÃ£o Preto. LMP errors in identifying preterm birth were lower in the more developed city, RibeirÃ£o Preto. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of LMP for the estimate of the post-term birth rate was very low and tended to overestimate it. LMP can be used with some errors to identify the preterm birth rate when obstetric ultrasonography is not available, but is not suitable for predicting post-term birth.\n\nDiallelic analysis to obtain cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) populations tolerant to water deficit.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, E V; Damasceno-Silva, K J; Rocha, M M; Bastos, E A\n\n2016-05-13\n\nThe purpose of this study was to identify parents and obtain segregating populations of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) with the potential for tolerance to water deficit. A full diallel was performed with six cowpea genotypes, and two experiments were conducted in Teresina, PI, Brazil in 2011 to evaluate 30 F2 populations and their parents, one under water deficit and the other under full irrigation. A triple-lattice experimental design was used, with six 2-m-long rows in each plot. Sixteen plants were sampled per plot. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and general and specific combining ability estimates were obtained based on the means. Additive effects were more important than non-additive effects, and maternal inheritance had occurred. The genotypes BRS Xiquexique, Pingo de Ouro-1-2, and MNC99-510F-16-1 were the most promising for use in selection programs aimed at water deficit tolerance. The hybrid combinations Pingo de Ouro-1-2 x BRS Xiquexique, BRS Xiquexique x Santo InÃ¡cio, CNCx 698-128G x MNC99-510F-16-1, Santo InÃ¡cio x CNCx 698-128G, MNC99-510F-16-1 x BRS ParaguaÃ§u, MNC99- 510F-16-1 x Pingo de Ouro-1-2, and MNC99-510F-16-1 x BRS Xiquexique have the potential to increase grain production and tolerate water deficit.\n\nMechanism of Action of the Transobturator Sling for Post-Radical Prostatectomy Incontinence: A Multi-institutional Prospective Study Using Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nKahokehr, Arman A; Selph, John P; Belsante, Michael J; Bashir, Mustafa; Sofue, Keitaro; Tausch, Timothy J; Brand, Timothy C; Lloyd, Jessica C; Goldsmith, Zachariah G; Walter, Jack R; Peterson, Andrew C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo compare the length of the membranous (functional) urethra in male patients who underwent the male transobturator sling (TOS) for postradical prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI). The TOS is in established use for treatment of PPI; however, the precise mechanism of action is unknown. This is a prospective case-controlled study on men undergoing male TOS surgery from 2008 to 2014. The comparison arm included patients without incontinence after radical prostatectomy. All participants underwent dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and this was repeated after TOS placement for those who underwent the procedure. Three standardized points were measured using MRI and compared in both groups in addition to clinical measures. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and 31 patients completed the protocols. The controls (Nâ=â14) had a longer vesicourethral anastomosis to urethra measured at the penile bulb (functional urethral length) distance compared to the pre-TOS group at rest (1.92âcm controls vs 1.27âcm pre-TOS, Pâ=â.0018) and at Valsalva (2.13âcm controls vs 1.72âcm pre-TOS, Pâ=â.0371). Placement of the sling (Nâ=â17) increased the functional urethral length distance at rest (1.92âcm control vs 1.53âcm post-TOS, Pâ=â.09) and at Valsalva (1.94âcm post-TOS vs 2.13âcm control, Pâ=â.61), so that the difference was no longer statistically significant. We identified that one possible mechanism in improvement in stress urinary incontinence post-TOS placement is the lengthening of the vesicourethral anastomosis to bulbar-urethra distance. This is the first such study utilizing dynamics MRI in post prostatectomy controls, incontinent pre-TOS, and post-TOS to assess and show these findings. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A surface enamel acid-etch microbiopsy was performed in vivo on a single upper deciduous incisor for each sample. LeadmoreÂ Â» was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) while phosphorus was measured colorimetrically to establish biopsy depth. Samples from both populations were classified into categories of similar biopsy depths based on biopsy depth quartiles. Median lead contents were statistically different between the Ribeirao Preto population (206 {mu}g/g, range: 5-1399 {mu}g/g) and the Bauru population (786 {mu}g/g, range: 320-4711 {mu}g/g) (p<0.001); however, biopsy depth did not differ between the Ribeirao Preto (3.9 {mu}m, Standard Deviation, SD=0.9) and Bauru (3.8 {mu}m, SD=0.9) populations (p=0.7940). Pearson's correlation coefficient for biopsy depths versus log{sub 10} lead values was -0.29 for Ribeirao Preto and -0.18 for Bauru. Lead contents were statistically different between the two populations for all quartiles of biopsy depth. These findings suggest that lead accumulated in the surface enamel of deciduous teeth is linked to the environment in which people reside, indicating that this tissue should be further explored as an accessible biomarker of lead exposure.Â«Â less\n\nFive new species of Ytu Reichardt (Coleoptera: Myxophaga: Torridincolidae) and new records from Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSampaio, Brunno Henrique Lanzellotti; Ferreira, Nelson\n\n2018-03-29\n\nThe genus Ytu Reichardt is the most diverse within Torridincolidae, currently with 19 species.

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence and perinatal and early life factors associated with symptoms of depression in children aged 7 to 11âyears from two Brazilian birth cohorts. Methods The study was conducted on 1444 children whose data were collected at birth and at school age, in 1994 and 2004/2005 in Ribeirao Preto, where they were aged 10â11âyears and in 1997/98 and 2005/06 in SÃ£o LuÃ­s, where children were aged 7â9âyears. Depressive symptoms were investigated with the Child Depression Inventory(CDI), categorized as yes (score â¥ 20) and no (score < 20). Adjusted and non-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated by Poisson regression with robust estimation of the standard errors. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 3.9% (95%CI = 2.5-5.4) in RibeirÃ£o Preto and 13.7% (95%CI = 11.0-16.4) in SÃ£o LuÃ­s. In the adjusted analysis, in RibeirÃ£o Preto, low birth weight (PR = 3.98; 95%CI = 1.72-9.23), skilled and semi-skilled manual occupation (PR = 5.30; 95%CI = 1.14-24.76) and unskilled manual occupation and unemployment (PR = 6.65; 95%CI = 1.16-38.03) of the household head were risk factors for depressive symptoms. In SÃ£o LuÃ­s, maternal schooling of 0â4âyears (PR = 2.39; 95%CI = 1.31-4.34) and of 5 to 8âyears (PR = 1.80; 95%CI = 1.08-3.01), and paternal age <20âyears (PR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.02-3.61), were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Conclusions The prevalence of depressive symptoms was much higher in the less developed city, SÃ£o LuÃ­s, than in the more developed city, RibeirÃ£o Preto, and than those reported in several international studies. Low socioeconomic level was associated with depressive symptoms in both cohorts. Low paternal age was a risk factor for depressive symptoms in the less developed city, SÃ£o LuÃ­s, whereas low birth weight was\n\nLutzomyia umbratilis from an area south of the Negro River is refractory to in vitro interaction with Leishmania guyanensis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoares, Rodrigo Pedro; Nogueira, Paula Monalisa; Secundino, NÃ¡gila Francinete; Marialva, Eric FabrÃ­cio; RÃ­os-VelÃ¡squez, ClÃ¡udia Maria; Pessoa, Felipe Arley Costa\n\n2018-03-01\n\nLutzomyia umbratilis, the vector for Leishmania guyanensis in northern South America, has been found naturally infected with L. guyanensis only in areas north of the Negro and Amazon rivers. While populations of this sand fly species are also found in areas south of these rivers, these populations have never been reported to be infected and/or transmitting L. guyanensis. However, no studies on the corresponding host-parasite interactions are available. This study evaluated the interaction between Lu. guyanensis promastigotes and field-collected Lu. umbratilis sand flies from Rio Preto da Eva and Manacapuru, which are located to the north and south, respectively, of the Negro River. Procyclic and metacyclic attachment was quantified using an in vitro system. Low attachment of parasites to the midguts of insects collected from Manacapuru was detected. Conversely, greater binding of metacyclic parasites was observed in the midguts of insects collected from Rio Preto da Eva, and this attachment was more pronounced than that observed for procyclics (p < 0.03). The Lu. umbratilis population from an area south of the Negro River has lower in vitro interaction with L. guyanensis. The higher attachment of L. guyanensis to midguts of insects from Rio Preto da Eva may suggest better vector competence. These findings are in accordance with previously reported epidemiological information of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) transmission in the Amazon.\n\nChildhood socioeconomic position, adult socioeconomic position and social mobility in relation to markers of adiposity in early adulthood: evidence of differential effects by gender in the 1978/79 Ribeirao Preto cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAitsi-Selmi, A; Batty, G D; Barbieri, M A; Silva, A A M; Cardoso, V C; Goldani, M Z; Marmot, M G; Bettiol, H\n\n2013-03-01\n\nLongitudinal studies drawn from high-income countries demonstrate long-term associations of early childhood socioeconomic deprivation with increased adiposity in adulthood. However, there are very few data from resource-poor countries where there are reasons to anticipate different gradients. Accordingly, we sought to characterise the nature of the socioeconomic status (SES)-adiposity association in Brazil. We use data from the Ribeirao Preto Cohort Study in Brazil in which 9067 newborns were recruited via their mothers in 1978/79 and one-in-three followed up in 2002/04 (23-25years). SES, based on family income (salaries, interest on savings, pensions and so on), was assessed at birth and early adulthood, and three different adiposity measures (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) ascertained at follow-up. The association between childhood SES, adult SES and social mobility (defined as four permutations of SES in childhood and adulthood: low-low, low-high, high-low, high-high), and the adiposity measures was examined using linear regression. There was evidence that the association between SES and the three markers of adiposity was modified by gender in both adulthood (P<0.02 for all outcomes) and childhood SES (P<0.02 for WC and WHR). Thus, in an unadjusted model, linear regression analyses showed that higher childhood SES was associated with lower adiposity in women (coefficient (95% confidence intervals) BMI: -1.49 (-2.29,-0.69); WC: -3.85 (-5.73,-1.97); WHR: -0.03 (-0.04,-0.02)). However, in men, higher childhood SES was related to higher adiposity (BMI: 1.03 (0.28,-1.78); WC: 3.15 (1.20, 5.09); WHR: 0.009 (-0.001, 0.019)) although statistical significance was not seen in all analyses. There was a suggestion that adult SES (but not adult health behaviours or birthweight) accounted for these relationships in women only. Upward mobility was associated with protection against greater adiposity in women but not men. In the\n\nProceeding of the 1999 Particle Accelerator Conference.

However, the etiology of the immunological deficiency in these individuals is not completely understood. This study investigated the frequency of interleukin 6 polymorphisms (rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797) in individuals with DS and individuals without the syndrome. The study included 282 individuals, 94 with DS attended at the General Genetics Outpatient Service of Hospital de Base, SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, and 188 individuals without DS attended at the Pediatric Service of Hospital de Base de SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil. Genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems). There was no difference in the genotype frequency between individuals with and without DS for the evaluated polymorphisms (P > 0.05). The frequency of interleukin 6 polymorphisms did not differ significantly between individuals with and without DS in the casuistic analyzed.\n\n[REBEn in the context of the history of Brazilian nursing: the significance of remembering Dr. Glete de AlcÃ¢ntara].\n\nPubMed\n\nMendes, Isabel AmÃ©lia Costa; Leite, JosÃ©te Luzia; Leite, JuÃ§ara Luzia; Trevizan, Maria Auxiliadora\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis is a Social History study which aims at recuperating the professional trajectory of Glete de AlcÃ¢ntara in the Revista Brasileira de Enfermagem/REBEn (Brazilian Journal of Nursing), initially called Anais de Enfermagem.

Data obtained in this association were mainly collected from its record books the journals.\n\nViral immunogenicity determines epidemiological fitness in a cohort of DENV-1 infection in Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinheiro, Tauyne Menegaldo; Mota, MÃ¢nlio Tasso de Oliveira; Watanabe, AripuanÃ£ Sakurada Aranha; Biselli-PÃ©rico, Joice Matos; Drumond, BetÃ¢nia Paiva; Ribeiro, Milene Rocha; Vedovello, Danila; AraÃºjo, JoÃ£o Pessoa; Pimenta, Paulo Filemon Paolucci; Chaves, BÃ¡rbara Aparecida; Silva, Mayara Marques Carneiro da; Batista, Izabella Cristina Andrade; Papa, Michelle Premazzi; Meuren, Lana Monteiro; Lucas, Carolina GonÃ§alves de Oliveira; Matassoli, Flavio Lemos; Gil, Laura Helena Vega Gonzales; Bozzi, Adriana; Calzavara-Silva, Carlos Eduardo; Arruda, Luciana Barros de; Souza, Danielle da GlÃ³ria de; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Vasilakis, Nikos; Nogueira, MaurÃ­cio Lacerda\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) circulation depends on serotype, genotype and lineage replacement and turnover. In SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, Brazil, we observed that the L6 lineage of DENV-1 (genotype V) remained the dominant circulating lineage even after the introduction of the L1 lineage. We investigated viral fitness and immunogenicity of the L1 and L6 lineages and which factors interfered with the dynamics of DENV epidemics. The results showed a more efficient replicative fitness of L1 over L6 in mosquitoes and in human and non-human primate cell lines. Infections by the L6 lineage were associated with reduced antigenicity, weak B and T cell stimulation and weak host immune system interactions, which were associated with higher viremia. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that reduced viral immunogenicity and consequent greater viremia determined the increased epidemiological fitness of DENV-1 L6 lineage in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto.\n\nViral immunogenicity determines epidemiological fitness in a cohort of DENV-1 infection in Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPinheiro, Tauyne Menegaldo; Mota, MÃ¢nlio Tasso de Oliveira; Biselli-PÃ©rico, Joice Matos; Ribeiro, Milene Rocha; AraÃºjo, JoÃ£o Pessoa; Pimenta, Paulo Filemon Paolucci; da Silva, Mayara Marques Carneiro; Batista, Izabella Cristina Andrade; Meuren, Lana Monteiro; Lucas, Carolina GonÃ§alves de Oliveira; Matassoli, Flavio Lemos; Gil, Laura Helena Vega Gonzales; Bozzi, Adriana; Calzavara-Silva, Carlos Eduardo; de Souza, Danielle da GlÃ³ria; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Vasilakis, Nikos\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) circulation depends on serotype, genotype and lineage replacement and turnover.

Whereas dolomite formation is largely related to late diagenesis and/or hydrothermal activity, Preto et al. (2015) suggested a primary origin of dolomite beds and nodules intercalated in clay rich deposits of the Carnian Travenanzes Formation (Fm.; Dolomites, Venetian Alps) based on a transmission electron microscopy study. Thus, dolomites of the Travenanzes Fm. are supposed to have formed during or soon after deposition and its petrographic features may still be indicative of the geochemical conditions prevalent in the depositional setting. The Travenanzes Fm. records both carbonate and siliciclastic input, reflecting a transitional continental to shallow marine environment (Breda and Preto, 2011) with alternations of alluvial plains, sabkhas and/or ephemeral lakes. The goal of this study is to determine the microfacies of the dolomites of the Travenanzes Fm. and to discuss possible depositional environments and scenarios of penecontemporaneous dolomite formation. The samples were taken from the Dibona section described by Breda and Preto (2011). Optical microscopy documented three different types of dolomite: (1) Microcrystalline nodular dolomite shows abundant clay interlayers and fenestral pores filled with coelestine and barite. The homogenous microcrystalline dolomite was further investigated by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping, revealing an anhedral to subhedral microstructure of grains ranging from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter. Some dolomite grew as spherules within the clay matrix. (2) Dolomite pebbles show semi-rounded edges in a dolosparitic matrix. (3) Dolomite with mm- to cm-scale lamination shows regularly spaced undulation with the cuspate side directed upwards. The laminae are also commonly affected by brittle or plastic deformation. Based on the petrographic observations, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) While the\n\nOlder adults abuse in three Brazilian cities.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida Partezani; Monteiro, Edilene AraÃºjo; Santos, Ana Maria Ribeiro Dos; Pontes, Maria de Lourdes de Farias; Fhon, Jack Roberto Silva; Bolina, Alisson Fernandes; Seredynskyj, Fernanda Laporti; Almeida, Vanessa Costa; Giacomini, Suelen Borelli Lima; Defina, Giovanna Partezani Cardoso; Silva, Luipa Michele\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo analyze the police reports filed by older adults who suffered abuse in order to identify the socio-demographic characteristics of victims and aggressors, type of violence, location, as well as to compare rates in three Brazilian cities in the period from 2009 to 2013. Ecological study, in which 2,612 police reports registered in Police Stations were analyzed. An instrument was used to obtain data from the victim, the aggressor and the type of violence. Psychological abuse predominated and most cases occurred in the older adults own home. In the cities of RibeirÃ£o Preto and JoÃ£o Pessoa, the older adults presented similar rates for both gender. Regarding the standardized rates, in JoÃ£o Pessoa, there was a rise of this type of abuse in the two first years, and later there was a certain stability. In the city of Teresina, there was an increase, also observed in the city of RibeirÃ£o Preto in the three first years, followed by a decrease. Older adults abuse is a cultural phenomenon difficult to be reported by them, since it occurs in the family context.
