This study describes the growth velocity and nutritional status based on the World Organization (WHO) standards of children exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy and followed up in a tertiary unit, a reference for tropical and infectious diseases in the Amazon. Seventy-one children born between March 2016 and June 2018 were monitored for anthropometric indices: z-score for body mass index (BMI/A); weight (W/A); height (H/A) and head circumference (HC/A); and growth velocity. The mean age at the last assessment was 21.1 months (SD ± 8.93). Four children had congenital microcephaly and severe neurological impairment. The other 67 were non-microcephalic children (60 normocephalic and 7 macrocephalic); of these; 24.2% (16 children) had neurological alterations, and 28.8% (19 children) had altered neuropsychomotor development. Seventeen (24.2%) children had inadequate GV (low growth velocity). The frequencies of low growth among microcephalic and non-microcephalic patients are 25% (1 of 4 children) and 23.9% (16 of 67 children); respectively. Most children had normal BMI/A values during follow-up. Microcephalic patients showed low H/A and HC/A throughout the follow-up, with a significant reduction in the HC/A z-score. Non-microcephalic individuals are within the regular ranges for H/A; HC/A; and W/A, except for the H/A score for boys. This study showed low growth velocity in children with and without microcephaly, highlighting the need for continuous evaluation of all children born to mothers exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy.

Serological diagnosis of ZIKV infection is still an unmet challenge due to the co-circulation of the dengue virus, which shares extensive sequence conservation of structural proteins leading to the generation of cross-reactive antibodies. In this study, we aimed to obtain tools for the development of improved serological tests for the detection of ZIKV infection. Polyclonal sera (pAb) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 2F2) against a recombinant form of the ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) allowed the identification of linear peptide epitopes of the NS1 protein. Based on these findings, six chemically synthesized peptides were tested both in dot blot and ELISA assays using convalescent sera collected from ZIKV-infected patients. Two of these peptides specifically detected the presence of ZIKV antibodies and proved to be candidates for the detection of ZIKV-infected subjects. The availability of these tools opens perspectives for the development of NS1-based serological tests with enhanced sensitivity regarding other flaviviruses.

In this study, we evaluated the clinical-laboratory aspects and testicular histopathological patterns of pubertal squirrel monkeys (Saimiri collinsi) infected with ZIKV, analyzing the effects at different stages of infection. The susceptibility of S. collinsi to ZIKV infection was confirmed by laboratory tests, which detected viremia (mean 1.63 × 106 RNA copies/µL) and IgM antibody induction. Reduced fecal testosterone levels, severe testicular atrophy and prolonged orchitis were observed throughout the experiment by ultrasound. At 21 dpi, testicular damage associated with ZIKV was confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Tubular retraction, the degeneration and necrosis of somatic and germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, the proliferation of interstitial cells and an inflammatory infiltrate were observed. ZIKV antigen was identified in the same cells where tissue injuries were observed. In conclusion, squirrel monkeys were found to be susceptible to the Asian variant of ZIKV, and this model enabled the identification of multifocal lesions in the seminiferous tubules of the infected group evaluated. These findings may suggest an impact of ZIKV infection on male fertility.

However, in 2015, severe cases of congenital infection were reported during the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. More subtle infections in children born to mothers with ZIKV still remain uncertain and the spectrum of this new congenital syndrome is still under construction. This study describes outcomes regarding neurodevelopment and neurological examination in the first years of life, of a cohort of 77 children born to pregnant women with ZIKV infection in Manaus, Brazil, from 2017 to 2020. In the group of normocephalic children (92.2%), most showed satisfactory performance in neuropsychomotor development, with a delay in 29.6% and changes in neurological examination in 27.1%, with two children showing muscle-strength deficits. All microcephalic children (5.2%) evolved with severe neuropsychomotor-development delay, spastic tetraparesis, and alterations in the imaging exam. In this cohort, 10.5% of the children had macrocephaly at birth, but only 2.6% remained in this classification. Although microcephaly has been considered as the main marker of congenital-Zika-virus syndrome in previous studies, its absence does not exclude the possibility of the syndrome. This highlights the importance of clinical follow-up, regardless of the classification of head circumference at birth.

Children with congenital zika syndrome (CZS) may present a spectrum of neurological impairments with changes in tonus, posture, and movement similar to children with CP. However, the relationship between CZS and hip dysplasia has not been characterized. In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to describe the occurrence of hip dysplasia in patients with CZS. Sixty-four children with CZS from 6 to 48 months of age were included and followed at a tertiary referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with periodic radiologic and clinical hip assessments. Twenty-six (41%) patients were diagnosed with hip dysplasia during follow-up; mean age at diagnosis was 23 months. According to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), 58 (91%) patients had severe impairment (GMFCS IV and V) at the first evaluation. All patients with progression to hip dysplasia had microcephaly and were classified as GMFCS IV or V. Pain and functional limitation were reported by 22 (84%) caregivers of children with hip dysplasia. All patients were referred to specialized orthopedic care; eight (31%) underwent surgical treatment during follow-up. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing a hip surveillance program and improving access to orthopedic treatment for children with CZS in order to decrease the chances of dysplasia-related complications and improve quality of life.

We describe disabilities present in children with CZS followed in a reference hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, based on the biopsychosocial model of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). This was a cohort study of children >3 years of age with CZS. Disability was characterized through outcomes related to ICF components assessed via clinical and motor development evaluations. Among 50 children, with a median age of 40 months, 47 (94%) presented with severe impairment and 46 (92%) had microcephaly. Damage to the head and neck was found in most children, with abnormal central nervous system imaging universally present. Most children had cognitive impairment (92%), muscle tone problems (90%), and speech deficits (94%). We found movement limitations in all categories but more pervasively (80–94%), in postural transfers and displacements. The main environmental factors identified in the ICF model were the use of products or substances for personal consumption and access to health services. Children with CZS have extremely high rates of disability beyond aged 3 years, particularly regarding motor activity. ICF-based models can contribute to the assessment of health domains.

Currently, ZIKV is endemic in all tropical areas of the world, and the chance for future Zika epidemics remains very real and accurate diagnosis is crucial. The aim of this work was to select specific ssDNA aptamers that bind to the entire Zika virus and can be used to compose specific diagnostics, without cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Zika virus was cultivated in Vero cells and used as a target for aptamer selection. Aptamers specific for the ZIKV were selected using whole-virus SELEX, with counterselection for other flavivirus. Secondary and tertiary structures were evaluated and the molecular anchoring between the aptamers and target were simulated by the HDOCK server. Aptamer interaction was evaluated by ELISA/ELASA and the dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by thermophoresis. Four ZIKV-specific aptamers were selected. The best two were further characterized and proved to be specific for ZIKV. Aptamers are capable of binding specifically to the ZIKV and differentiate from Dengue virus. The aptamers selected in this work can be used as capture agents in the composition of diagnostic tests to specifically detect ZIKV infection.

In 2015, Brazil and other Latin American countries experienced an outbreak of ZIKV infections associated with severe neurological disorders such as Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS), encephalopathy, and encephalitis. Here, a complete mechanical and structural analysis of the ZIKV has been performed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM analysis corroborated the virus mean size (~50 nm) and icosahedral geometry and revealed high mechanical resistance of both: the viral surface particle (~200 kPa) and its internal content (~800 kPa). The analysis demonstrated the detailed organization of the nucleocapsid structure (such as RNA strips). An interesting finding was the discovery that ZIKV has no surface self-assembling property. These results can contribute to the development of future treatment candidates and circumscribe the magnitude of viral transmission.

The objective of the present study was to describe the evolution of gross motor function in children with CZS in a Rio de Janeiro hospital. In children with CZS without arthrogryposis or other congenital osteoarticular malformations who were followed in a prospective cohort study, motor performance was evaluated at two timepoints using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Gross Motor Function Measurement test (GMFM-88). Among 74 children, at the baseline evaluation, the median age was 13 (8–24) months, and on follow-up, 28 (24–48) months. According to GMFCS at the second timepoint, 6 children were classified as mild, 11 as moderate, and 57 as severe. In the GMFM-88 assessment, children in the severe group had a median score of 10.05 in the baseline evaluation and a follow-up score of 12.40, the moderate group had median scores of 25.60 and 29.60, and the mild group had median scores of 82.60 and 91.00, respectively. Although a small developmental improvement was observed, the motor impairment of children was mainly consistent with severe cerebral palsy. Baseline motor function assessments were predictive of prognosis.

Thirty-four (39%) newborns with CZS and seven (6%) NCZS were small for gestational age (p < 0.001).

Length mean z-scores varied from −0.3 ± 0.1 at 1 month to 0.17 ± 0.2 SD between 31 and 36 months in the NCZS group, versus −2.3 ± 0.3 to −2.0 ± 0.17 SD in the CZS group (p < 0.001). Weight/height (W/H) and BMI z-scores reached -1.45 ± 0.2 SD in CZS patients between 31 and 36 months, versus 0.23 ± 0.2 SD in the NCZS group (p < 0.01). Between 25 and 36 months of age, more than 50% of the 70 evaluated CZS children were below weight and height limits; 36 (37.1%) were below the W/H cut-off. Gastrostomy was performed in 23 (26%) children with CZS. During the first three years of life, CZS patients had severe and early growth deficits, while growth of NCZS children was normal by WHO standards.
