        "text": "🎓 Celebrating Milestones: An Inspiring Interview with Dr Philipp K. Wagner from WAGNER Arbitration🎙️ As the bustling university corridors quiet down over the August weeks, a sense of accomplishment fills the air with the submission of final exams by the #IDR #LLM Class of 2023. 📚✨ Now, as we embrace this moment of transition, there is no better way to fuel the enthusiasm than by diving into a captivating mini-interview with Dr Philipp K. Wagner 💙 A true pillar and lecturer of the LL.M. program since its inception, Dr Wagner's insights and experiences are invaluable. 📍 Do you remember your first encounter with the LL.M.? It was sometime in 2010 when Patrick Angénieux first introduced his idea of establishing the LL.M. at a Berlin university. I remember we considered both FU and HU for this purpose, given that there was no arbitration faculty member at either university at the time. 📍 What are the key strengths of the LL.M. from your perspective as an international practitioner? Berlin. Diverse. Affordable. 📍 How have the program and the students changed over the years? It changes every year because of the different individuals and cultural backgrounds involved. The spirit of each group seems to be the same since the beginning of the program. What matters every year is the group itself. That is a great cultural achievement. 📍 How do you manage to combine your intensive international career with teaching? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle 😉. Seriously: I have been teaching at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin since 2009. I always wanted to teach next to my practice. 📍 What is your highlight of working with the LL.M. over the years? ✅ Encounters during the introductory week, ✅ Visiting Professionals at our firm, ✅ Having the class of 2023 over at my house for a BBQ party. 📍 From today's perspective, what would be your advice to your younger self, entering the dispute resolution market? I would do it all as I did back then. Networking is essential. Try to find mentors. Enjoy personal relationships. Define your USPs early on. 📍 What do you like to do in or around Berlin when not counselling, arbitrating or teaching? Swimming in any of the lakes. I even swim during wintertime. With an axe, if need be, to break the ice. I only recently discovered a new place which I highly recommend for all future LL.M. generations: the “Fischerpinte” on Plötzensee (see photo). *** Thank you for this wonderful interview, with a very summery twist at the end 🏊🏽🛶🐟"
