        "text": "The theater critique can maximize the encounter between the viewer and the creative work: clues, keys, holes, connections. Therefore, MITsp offers a number of activities that seek to improve the perception of the audience, through a critical and provocative perspective.\n\nCurators: Fernando Mencarelli e Silvia Fernandes\n\nOrganization, research and texts: Julia Guimarães\n\nCrossing Dialogues\n\nShortly after each show’s first performance, artists and thinkers, from different fields of knowledge present their reviews. The idea is to allow perspectives to go beyond borders and expand possible interpretations of the works, thus renewing the critique activity itself.\n\nAlejandro Ahmed – Hamlet, by Oskaras Koršunovas\n\nFelipe Hirsch – “We Are Like Those Toads…” + “Ali”, of MPTA\n\nFrei Betto – “Escuela (School)”, of Guillermo Calderón\n\nIsmail Xavier – “Cineastas (Filmmakers)”, of Mariano Pensotti\n\nLaymert Garcia dos Santos – “On the Concept of the Face, Regarding the Son of God”, of Romeo Castellucci\n\nLisette Lagnado -“Anti-Prometheus, of Sahika Tekand\n\nPedro Cesarino -“Suddenly Everywhere is Black With People (De repente fica tudo preto de gente)”, of Marcelo Evelin Company\n\nPeter Pal Pélbart -“Gólgota Picnic”, of Rodrigo García\n\nSuely Rolnik -“Yo No Soy Bonita (I Am Not Pretty)”, of Angelica Liddel\n\nTales Ab’Sáber -“Bien Venido a Casa (Welcome Home)”, of Roberto Suárez\n\nVladimir Safatle -“Ubu and the Truth Commission”, of William Kentridge and Handspring Puppet\n\nMediator: Beth Néspoli\n\n*Crossing Dialogues activities are open to the general public, and not only to who attended the shows, as long as there are sits available.\n\nPathways in Perspective\n\nResearchers of Brazilian Universities introduce us to the creative trajectories of the MITsp guest artists, exploring ways to interpret the shows presented at the Festival. Other videos of the shows are available at the Itaú Cultural Library during the Festival period.

Their texts are compiled in the MITsp book-program.\n\nOngoing Thought\n\nThe Festival guest artists are invited to talk about their creative process, exposing the internal textures and structures of their artwork. Cecília Almeida Salles, expert in creative processes, will conduct the talks.\n\nConfirmed Artists:\n\nAngelica Liddell and Gumersindo Puche (Atra Bílis Theater/ “I Am Not Pretty”)\n\n“Romeo Castelucci (video conference) and Gianni Plazi and Sergio Scarlatella (Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio/ “On the Concept of the Face, Regarding the Son of God”)\n\nGuillermo Calderón (video conference) and Camila González, Carlos Ugarte, Francisca Lewin, Luis Cerda, Maria Paz Gonzales and Trinidad González (“Escuela”)\n\nJanny Young and Adrian Kohler (Handspring Puppet Company/ “Ubu and the Truth Comission”)\n\nMarcelo Evelin (Demolition Inc./ “Suddenly Everything is Black With People”)\n\nMariano Pensotti (Marea/ “Filmmakers”)\n\nMathurin Bolze and Hédi Thabet (MPTA/ “We Are Like Those Toads” + “Ali”)\n\nOskaras Koršunovas, Darius Meskauskas, Dainius Gavenonis and Rasa Samuolyte (OKT/ “Hamlet”)\n\nRoberto Suárez (Pequeño Teatro de Morondanga/ “Bienvenido a Casa”)\n\nRodrigo García and John Romao (Carnicería Teatro/ “Gólgota Picnic”)\n\nSimon McBurney (Complicite)\n\n*The Ongoing Thought activities take place at the Itaú Cultural and the entrance tickets will be handed to the public 30 minutes before the start.\n\nPractice of Reviewing\n\nThe Collective of Critics is a temporary gathering of theater critics, with an active presence on the internet. It is composed by the blog Satisfeita, Yolanda? (PE), the websites Horizonte da Cena (MG) and Teatrojornal (SP), and the electronic journal Questão de Crítica (RJ); throughout the festival period, they will write and deliver reviews on the shows, for electronic and printed press, which will be distributed in the venues one day after the premiere.\n\nAntro Positivo (São Paulo/SP)\n\nRuy Filho\n\nAna Carolina Marinho\n\nhttp://www.antropositivo.com.br\n\nHorizonte da Cena (Belo Horizonte/MG)\n\nSoraya Belusi\n\nLuciana Romagnolli\n\nhttp://horizontedacena.blogspot.com.br\n\nQuestão de Crítica (Rio de Janeiro/RJ)\n\nDaniele Avila Small\n\nhttp://www.questaodecritica.com.br\n\nSatisfeita, Yolanda? (Recife/PE)\n\nPollyanna Diniz\n\nIvana Moura\n\nhttp://www.satisfeitayolanda.com.br\n\nTeatrojornal (São Paulo/SP)\n\nValmir Santos\n\nMaria Eugênia de Menezes\n\nhttp://teatrojornal.com.br\n\nMeta-critique\n\nIn addition to writing reviews, the Collective of Critics works on a way to question their own place and internally and publicly destabilize issues such as authorship, truth and point of view. For this, they developed two fold: a meta-critique exercise and, from it, the creation of collective texts. Those texts will be the starting point. Other critics will later comment and from the observations brought by them, each one can reevaluate their ideas and conclusions, thus creating a web of arguments and thoughts.\n\nPosted on social networks, these reviews seek to influence and be influenced by someone else’s writing, and together at the end, they create a network of critic thinking, a polyphonic writing, without hierarchy and, therefore, multifocal. A shared creation in process, which is unable, by nature, to establish itself as a univocal speech. At the end of this exercise on the Internet, the critics who wrote the first texts shall rewrite them, considering all the raised questions.\n\nCritique on the Criticism\n\nScholars and critics talk about the challenges of producing theater critics today.\n\nA roundtable composed by Kil Abreu, Luiz Fernando Ramos, Edelcio Mostaço + Collective of Critics, with mediation of Fernando Mencarelli.\n\nCritical thinking on the contemporary scene has developed in the last decades, but has been restricted to specialized circuits. However, the criticism directed at the viewer seems to constantly reinvent itself, driven by the lack of interest and space devoted to it in the traditional media. Where does this contradiction come from? Does the theater participate less and less on the great national debates for having less power of impact, and so becoming the object of experts? Do recent changes in the medias make it impossible for critical thinking to consolidate, leveling down the art and favoring its massive forms? Will newspaper theater reviews end? Are the Internet and its possibility to reach viewers directly the future of theater critique? Do collective, polyphonic, collaborative forms contribute to reestablish the dialogue with artists and their works to offer the viewer a critique repertoire in times of shared workmanship?\n\nMarch 15th, from 10h to 13h\n\nLocation: Itaú Cultural*\n\n* Entrance tickets will be handed to the public 30 minutes before the start.\n\nShort Biographies\n\nCrossing Dialogues\n\nAlejandro Ahmed: He is choreographer, artistic director and dancer of Grupo Cena 11 Dance Company.
