        "text": "AntÃ´nio Moura Brazil\n\nAntônio Moura is considered to be among the most important of Brazilian poets writing today. He has published two previous books of original poetry in Brazil as well as a translation into Portuguese of the Madagascan poet Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo.\n\nAntônio Moura's poems have also appeared in many Brazilian journals and newspapers, as well as in a number of contemporary anthologies in Brazil and abroad, including Nothing the Sun Could Not Explain: 20 Contemporary Brazilian Poets (2nd edition; 2003). He is currently being translated into Spanish, Catalan, German and English. Earlier versions of some translations in this collection have appeared in the UK journals Shearsman and Modern Poetry in Translation, as well as in Travessia (Crossing), a pamphlet from the São Paulo small press Arqueria Editorial.\n\nAntônio Moura was born in 1963 in Belém, capital of the state of Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon. After periods living in São Paulo and Lisbon, he has now returned to in Belém.\n\n(2012)"
