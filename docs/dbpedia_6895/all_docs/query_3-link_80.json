        "text": "\"Lucas Moura was born on 13th August 1992 in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Lucas initially came through the ranks at Brazilian side Sao Paulo, where he went on to score 22 goals in 86 appearances, as well as winning the Copa Sudamericana in 2012.\n\nHe moved to Paris Saint-Germain in January, 2013 and played 229 times for the Parisians, scoring 46 goals. While at the Parc des Princes, Lucas won four Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, four French League Cups and five French Super Cups.\n\nThe attacking midfielder joined Tottenham Hotspur on 31st January 2018, signing a contract until 2023. He made his debut as a late substitute in a memorable 2-2 draw away to Juventus in the UEFA Champions League in February, 2018 and scored on his full debut in a 2-2 FA Cup fifth round draw at Rochdale five days later.\n\nLucas began the next season in excellent form, scoring his first Premier League goal in the season opener and getting a brace in a 3-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. He was named the Premier League's EA SPORTS 'Player of the Month' for August, 2018.\n\nIn October, 2018 Moura was recalled to the Brazil national team for the first time in over two years. He has represented his country on over 30 occasions to date and lifted the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013.\n\nHe wrote his name into Tottenham Hotspur folklore at the end of his first full season at Tottenham Hotspur. Scoring a second-half hat-trick away to Ajax in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final, he helped send the team through to the final against Liverpool in Madrid. Moura's third goal was scored in the sixth minute of added time. That was his second hat-trick in the space of less than a month.\""
