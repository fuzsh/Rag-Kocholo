        "text": "Iga Swiatek became only the eighth woman to win at least three French Open championships on Saturday when she beat Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.\n\nNone of the women’s French Open legends, a group that includes Serena Williams, Justine Henin, and Steffi Graf, are still active. Poland’s Swiatek, still just 22 years old, has a chance to creep up the list of career titles and add herself to the inner circle of Roland Garros greats.\n\nWho won the 2022 Women’s French Open Final?\n\nThe 2022 Women’s French Open Final was won by Iga Swiatek, who beat Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-3.\n\nWhen is the 2023 Women’s French Open Final?\n\nThe 2023 Women’s French Open final took place on Saturday, June 10. World No. 1 Iga Swiatek defeated unranked Karolina Muchova.\n\nWhat time is the Women’s French Open Final?\n\nThe 2023 Women’s French Open final was played at 9 a.m. ET (3 p.m. in France).\n\nFrench Open Women’s Final History\n\nThe first French Open took place in 1891 and was played at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France. The tournament is notably the only Grand Slam to be played on clay courts.\n\nThe tournament was known as the “French Championships” until 1968. Winners of the French Open receive 2.3 million euros ($2.47 million), with the runners-up receiving 1.15 million euros ($1.23 million). The tournament is widely popular, as tennis fans flock from around the globe to view the event.\n\nWho has won the most French Open Women’s titles?\n\nAmerican Chris Evert has the most French Open women’s titles with seven. German Steffi Graf has six, while Australian Margaret Smith Court has five. All three of these women are well represented in the list below.\n\nRanking the Top 10 Greatest French Open Women’s Finals of all time\n\n1988: Steffi Graf vs. Natasha Zvereva\n\nFinal Score: 6-0, 6-0\n\nIn the Open era of women’s tennis, this is the only “double-bagel” (6-0, 6-0) of any Grand Slam final. This should indicate just how dominant Steffi Graf was on clay.\n\nThe Belarus-born Natasha Zvereva (ranked No. 13 in the world) was no slouch, but she was simply overmatched on this day. Including a brief period when the match was stopped for rain, the match ran only 34 minutes -- the shortest Grand Slam final in history, men’s or women’s.\n\n1999: Steffi Graf vs. Martina Hingis\n\nFinal Score: 4-6, 7-5, 6-2\n\nThis was the final Grand Slam victory for legendary German former world No. 1 Steffi Graf, who beat active world No. 1 Martina Hingis. Graf’s victory denied Hingis a career Grand Slam and enabled Graf to pass Margaret Court and move into second place behind Chris Evert for the most women’s French Open titles of all time.\n\nAfter dropping the first set, an experienced Graf battled back to win in three sets. She is undeniably one of the greatest players in French Open history.\n\n2013: Serena Williams vs. Maria Sharapova\n\nFinal Score: 6-4, 6-4\n\nThe 2013 French Open Final scores ranking-points for its pageantry, as world No. 2 and reigning champion Maria Sharapova squared off against world No. 1 Serena Williams.\n\nWilliams was in dominant form in 2013, winning 31 straight matches at one point and dropping only one set in the entire tournament. In fact, she won a staggering 72 out of 93 games entering the final and continued her dominance by rolling over a competitive Sharapova in straight sets.\n\n2002: Serena Williams vs. Venus Williams\n\nFinal Score: 7-5, 6-3\n\nThe 2002 French Open final marked the second time that the Williams sisters faced each other in a Grand Slam final, and Serena came out on top. It was just Serena’s second Grand Slam final at the time, and she had previously lost to Venus in their only other Grand Slam match at the 2001 U.S. Open.\n\nWorld No. 1 and reigning Roland Garros winner Jennifer Capriati had lost to Serena in the semifinals in a year when three members of the tournament’s final four were Americans.\n\n1989: Arantxa Sanchez Vicario vs. Steffi Graf\n\nFinal Score: 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 7-5\n\nIn one of the biggest upsets in Women’s French Open finals history, world No. 7-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated two-time reigning champion Steffi Graf in three sets. Graf was leading 5-3 in the third set and was serving for the match before being broken and eventually dropping four straight points.\n\nNot only had Graf won consecutive French Open titles, but she had won five straight Grand Slam championships before losing this match. On top of that, Sanchez Vicario was only 17 years old, the same age as men’s 1989 French Open winner Michael Chang.\n\n1996: Steffi Graf vs. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario\n\nFinal Score: 6-3, 6-7, (4-7), 10-8\n\nIn yet another duel between Graf and Sanchez Vicario, the 1996 French Open final went the distance, as tiebreakers in the first two sets followed sudden-death in the third, where Graf ultimately prevailed.\n\nFrench Open finals rivalries were not new to Graf – who had been through a rivalry with Monica Seles. However, this third meeting with Sanchez Vicario takes the cake.\n\n1973: Margaret Court vs. Chris Evert\n\nFinal Score: 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (8-6), 6-4\n\nIn a cross-generational matchup, 31-year-old Margaret Smith Court (who has the most Grand Slam wins in women’s tennis history) battled 19-year-old Chris Evert (who has the fifth-most).\n\nEvert was making her first-ever appearance at the French Open as the No. 2 overall seed behind Court. The experienced Court was victorious in a thrilling three-set match that featured multiple tiebreaks.\n\n1992: Monica Seles vs. Steffi Graf\n\nFinal Score: 6-2, 3-6, 10-8\n\nWith a dramatic 10-8 third-set triumph, Monica Seles became the first woman to win three consecutive French Open championships. In one of just a handful of Roland Garros finals that have extended past 6-6 in the third set, the Yugoslavian-born Seles broke Graf’s serve to capture the lead.\n\nBetween the two of them, Seles and Graf would finish their respective careers with a combined 31 Grand Slam titles.\n\n2001: Jennifer Capriati vs. Kim Clijsters\n\nFinal Score: 1-6, 6-4, 12-10\n\nOn the road to the longest women’s French Open final in history, the American ranked No. 4 in the world, Jennifer Capriati, defeated compatriot Serena Williams in the quarterfinals and world No. 1 Martina Hingis in the semifinals. That set up a final date with Kim Clijsters, who became the first Belgian woman to reach a Grand Slam final.\n\nCapriati had multiple match points on Clijsters’ serve (at 7-6 and 10-9) in the third set, but couldn’t hold off the Belgian. The marathon match finally ended with Capriati winning the final set 12-10 -- the most games played in any set in women’s Roland Garros French Open history.\n\nIn terms of the quality of the matches themselves (apart from the pageantry), 2001 must go down as one of the best French Open women’s finals.\n\n1986: Chris Evert vs. Martina Navratilova\n\nFinal Score: 2-6, 6-3, 6-3\n\nBoth Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were past women’s French Open champions, having beaten each other in the previous two finals. Navratilova had won in 1984 and Evert in 1985, so 1986 was Round 3 of their French Open championship rivalry.\n\nRanked Nos. 1 and 2 in the world entering Roland Garros, both French Open players were keen to gain an edge in the rivalry. Evert’s three-set triumph would be her record-setting seventh and final French Open title. Monica Seles would set a different record by becoming the first woman to win three straight French Open titles in the 1990s, but those were the only three she won, leaving her far short of Evert’s mark.\n\nParameters of Rankings\n\nRankings were based on four factors: the level of notoriety of the finalists, the quality of each match, the length of each match, and the historic significance of each match.\n\nBet on French Open Odds at Betway"
