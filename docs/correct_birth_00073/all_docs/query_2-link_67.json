        "text": "Pam Shriver, born on Independence Day, first picked up a tennis racquet at the age of 3. The middle daughter of Sam and Margot Shriver showed early promise in a sport she grew up watching her parents and grandparents enjoy. As her tennis game blossomed, she showed her prowess as center on the girls’ varsity basketball team at McDonogh School where she graduated in 1979.\n\nBursting onto the national tennis stage in 1978, Shriver was billed the \"Legend of Lutherville\" when she reached the finals of the U.S. Open as an amateur at the age of 16 (losing to Chris Evert). During this run, Shriver made famous the revolutionary Prince oversized racquet invented by the late Howard Head. Throughout the 1980s, she was ranked among the top 10 women's singles players in the world, peaking at number three and winning 21 singles titles. Meanwhile, her doubles career also flourished, winning 112 titles, including 22 Grand Slam titles, 21 in women's doubles (20 paired with Martina Navratilova and 1 with Natasha Zvereva), seven Australian Open titles, four French Open titles, five Wimbledon titles, and five U.S. Open titles, plus one mixed doubles with Emilio Sanchez at the 1987 French Open. While teaming with Navratilova, the two set the record of 109 consecutive match wins from April 1983 thru July 1985. This winning stretch included winning The Grand Slam in 1984. (Winning all four majors in the same calendar year) While partnering with Zina Garrison, she captured the 1988 Olympic Gold Medal in doubles in Seoul.\n\nA top player on the women's tennis tour for more than 15 years and a 2002 inductee into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Shriver also has become a valued and respected member of the sports media community. She has been a member of ESPN's tennis broadcast team starting in 1990 where she worked even as she continued to play on the professional tour until 1997 when she retired. Her work for ESPN at Wimbledon and the US Open has been viewed by millions as she calls matches from either the play by play or analyst positions in the booth or sit’s court side sharing her mid match observations. In 2021, Shriver expanded her tennis broadcasting skills to the Tennis Channel.\n\nWell known for her interviews with fans and celebrities, Shriver's approach is both straightforward and entertaining. Whether talking strategy with a coach in the player's box - discussing the lure of tennis with the likes of Tony Bennett, Alec Baldwin, Michael Phelps, Henry \"Hank\" Aaron and Anna Wintour - or mixing it up with the British fans on Wimbledon's Henman Hill (aka Murray Mound), Shriver's charm and professionalism enhance the action on the court for millions of viewers. Shriver is a go-to-interview for all major media outlets across the globe when any major tennis story breaks. Shriver’s coverage of Roger Federer’s final match at the 2022 Laver Cup was a prime example of her acumen for covering the sport.\n\nIn 2022, Shriver came forward with her story about an inappropriate relationship with her tennis coach, which began when she was 17 and ended five years later. Safeguarding current and future athletes from this type of traumatic experience as well as personal healing were reasons for speaking her truth."
