        "meta_description": "Born in Germany in 1969, Steffi Graf would go on to become one of the greatest player the game has ever seen. After picking up the racket at age four and under the guidance of her father, she would go on to swiftly become the European Champion of the 12's and 18s levels. Going pro in 1982, Graf initially lost in a match to Tracy Austin, however in 1983, at the tender age of 13, Graf soon became a world-ranked player quickly gaining international attention.",

        "text": "1987\n\nKnown as her “breakthrough year“1, 1987 saw Steffi Graf enter the French open following six tournament victories. In a devastating match-up, Graf Beat Martina Navratilova, then the world’s number one ranked female, in the final match 6-4, 4-6, 8-6. However, Graf would go on to lose to Navratilova in the Wimbledon Final later that year, but still ending the year with a match record of 74-2.\n\nThe Golden Slam\n\nIn 1988 Steffi Graf started the year with a bang, beating Chris Evert, 6-1, 7-6, in the Australian Open final. After two losses to Sabatini in smaller tournaments, Graf went on to defend her title at the French Open, easily beating Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0. Soon after, at Wimbledon, Graf was trailing Navratilova in the final 7-5, 2-0 before winning the match 5-6, 6-2, 6-12. Her crowning moment came in the fall at the US Open, where Graf defeated Sabatini, becoming only the 3rd woman to do so in history.\n\nYet, it was her Gold Medal championship match win at the Olympic Games in Seoul, that not only brought worldwide fame and attention to Graf and Tennis, but also coined- the phrase the “Golden Slam“.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nThe nineties proved much tougher for the tennis star. With her new status as the star of Tennis, Graf developed a welcomed rivalry with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. It was an exciting rivalry, with Graf wining most of their match-ups and emerging as the stronger player. In 1997, Graf became sidetracked with knee surgery3 and soon the title of world number one was lost to Martina Hingis. 1997 would also become the first time in ten years that Graf would not win a Grand Slam Title. In August 1999, Graf announced her retirement from the women’s tour. She was ranked World No. 3 at that time. Graf said, “I have done everything I wanted to do in tennis”4.\n\nAfter Retirement\n\nIn her personal life, Graf went on to marry fellow Tennis Champion Andre Aggassi on October 22, 20015. It was a small, private ceremony held in Las Vegas, NV. The couple went on to have two children, Jaden Gil and Jaz Elle.\n\nShe is involved in activities with the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education; however, with the possible exception to being a wife and mother, her greatest accomplishment since retirement from tennis in 1999 is that of founder and chairperson of the Steffi Graf “Children for Tomorrow” Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation serves to help children who have endured a range of violent experiences as a result of war, persecution, fleeing, and exile. Projects include, but are not limited to: Kosovo – a child psychiatric treatment and counseling center with training for local mental health professionals; and Eritrea – a facility providing kindergarten facilities for approximately 1,000 children, and installing psychotherapeutic support and education for health professionals.\n\nAndre and Steffi certainly made their mark as elite tennis players, but their most profound and lasting mark may very well be as advocates for education and medical service to children around the world who otherwise would not have the educational opportunities or medical attention.\n\nRead more news from our After sport’s career section."
