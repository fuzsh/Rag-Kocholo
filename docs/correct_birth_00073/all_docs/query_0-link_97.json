        "text": "Byron Black World ranking: No52\n\nThe 30-year-old 5ft 10in right- hander from Harare, Zimbabwe, has hovered on the edges of the sport without really making the crucial breakthrough. A quarter- finalist in the 1995 US Open, where he lost in straight sets to Sampras, he has never previously progressed beyond the last 32 at Wimbledon. He was encouraged to learn the grass-court game by his father Don, who reached the third round at Wimbledon in 1953 and 1956 and built grass courts at the family avocado farm for his children to learn on. He is a Davis Cup regular playing with his brother Wayne, and sister Cara plays on the WTA Tour.\n\nWimbledon 2000: bt Andrew Ilie (Aus) 6-3 5-7 7-6 6-0; bt Dominik Hrbaty (Slovak) 6-3 7-5 6-2; bt Albert Portas (Sp) 6-2 6-0 6-4.\n\nJan-Michael Gambill World ranking: No56\n\nBorn in Spokane, Washington, the 23-year-old right-hander was initially hailed as the great new hope of US tennis in the post-Sampras, Agassi, Chang, Courier era. But the man nicknamed 'Hollywood' and named after Airwolf star Jan-Michael Vincent has so far failed to live up to his nation's expectations. This is the first time the 6ft 3in Gambill has reached the last 16 of a grand slam in 12 attempts. His form on the ATP tour has been equally inauspicious: he has won one event, at Scottsdale in 1999. He collects Jaguar cars and claims to be fascinated by big cats.\n\nWimbledon 2000: bt Lleyton Hewitt (Aus) 6-3 6-2 7-5; Fabrice Santoro (Fr) 4-6 6-4 6-2 6-2; Paul Goldstein (US) 7-6, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nAlexander Popp World ranking: No114\n\nThe 6ft 7in right-hander from Heidelberg, Germany, holds dual nationality thanks to his English mother Jennifer. He said recently that he would consider playing Davis Cup tennis for Britain but he has yet to commit himself. The 23-year-old's childhood hero was Boris Becker, and with Switzerland's Marc Rosset, whom he meets today, he is the tallest player on the ATP Tour. He has yet to win a career title but is ranked higher than any British player apart from Henman and Rusedski. His main asset is his huge serve.\n\nWimbledon 2000: bt Ronald Agenor (Hai) 0-6 7-5 7-6 6-2; bt Michael Chang (US) 7-6 4-6 6-7 6-3 8-6; bt Gustavo Kuerten (Braz) 7-6 6-2 6-1.\n\nGianluca Pozzi World ranking: No64\n\nThe Italian from Bari turned pro in 1984 and, at 35, qualified for the seniors event just before this Wimbledon. He has never previously progressed beyond the second round here, having made his debut in the tournament in 1991. His best grand slam performance came in reaching the fourth round of the US Open in 1994, and he has won one ATP event, Brisbane in 1991. In these days of huge servers the 5ft 10in Pozzi stands out for one reason: born in 1965, he plays sixties-style tennis, hitting the ball with all the force and sound of a settling snowflake.\n\nWimbledon 2000: bt Jiri Novak (Cz) 6-3 6-4 3-6 6-1; bt Alex O'Brien (US) 7-6 6-3 6-4; bt Olivier Rochus (Bel) 6-3 3-6 7-6 6-2.\n\nDavid Prinosil World ranking: No84\n\nThis 27-year-old right-hander from Olomouc in the Czech Republic moved to Germany aged 14. At 23 he won a bronze medal in the Atlanta Olympics with Marc-Kevin Goellner but his career then stuttered through injury. The 6ft 1in Prinosil underwent the same foot operation as Greg Rusedski this year and, prior to his recent victory in the Halle tournament, had lost his last nine matches. A qualifier for Wimbledon, he won his final match in five sets and his current winning run on grass stands at 11. He has won three career titles: Halle this year, Ostrava in 1996 and Newport in 1995.\n\nWimbledon 2000: bt Sargis Sargsian (Arm) 2-6 6-1 6-2 6-4; bt Stéphane Huet (Fr) 6-4 2-6 6-1 6-2; bt Martin Damm (Cz) 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-4.\n\nVladimir Voltchkov World ranking: No237\n\nThe 22-year-old right-hander from Minsk, Belarus, turned professional in 1995 and reached the third round of Wimbledon as a 19-year-old. He qualified this year by beating the top seed Anthony Du Puis of France and seems to have developed something of a feel for grass (and arguably for French players), putting out the former Wimbledon finalist Cédric Pioline in the second round. He has yet to win an ATP tournament but appears as relaxed on grass as his compatriot Natasha Zvereva, who reached the semi-finals here in 1998."
