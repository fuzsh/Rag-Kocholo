        "text": "The shortest tennis match was just completed in 20 minutes.\n\nIn the world of tennis, where matches often stretch for hours and feature grueling five-set battles, there are rare instances when encounters conclude in a matter of minutes. These surprisingly shortest tennis matches matches, usually a result of injury, withdrawal, or a significant mismatch in skill level, leave spectators astonished and become noteworthy moments in tennis history.\n\nSuch short-lived clashes can occur at any tennis event, from grand slams to smaller tournaments. While fans typically anticipate intense competitions between top players, the unpredictable nature of the sport sometimes leads to matches being decided before they fully develop.\n\nThese exceptionally brief encounters serve as a reminder that even in a sport known for its endurance and mental fortitude, unexpected circumstances can result in matches ending abruptly.\n\nThis article explores the five shortest matches in tennis history, shedding light on the unique situations that led to their swift conclusions\n\nShortest tennis matches in the Open Era\n\n#5 Iga Swiatek defeated Anastasia Potapova in 40 minutes\n\nWorld No. #1 Iga Swiatek showcased her dominance at the French Open, cruising into the quarterfinals with a 6-0, 6-0 demolition of Russia’s Anastasia Potapova in just 40 minutes. Swiatek became the sixth woman to win a match at Roland Garros without facing a single game point since the fourth round, a feat last achieved by Ana Ivanovic in 2008.\n\nPotapova, appearing in the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time, was outclassed from the start, as Swiatek’s near-perfect shots left her with no answers. The top seed wrapped up the first set in 19 minutes and maintained her relentless assault, handling the swirling wind with ease.\n\n#4 Steffi Graf defeated Natasha Zvereva in 34 minutes\n\nOne of the greatest players to have graced the tennis courts, German legend Steffi Graff holds nearly all records in the sport’s history. Her list of achievements also includes one of the quickest wins in women’s singles history. In the 1988 French Open final, the defending Champion faced Natasha Zvereva. The German legend steamrolled past her opponent with a 6-0, 6-0 victory in just 34 minutes.\n\nAlthough the clock said 34 minutes, if not for the rain break then the game would have been completed in 32 minutes. By the win, Graf not only successfully defended her title from the Roland Garros. It was also the start of the greatest year in Tennis history, as she became the first Tennis player to win the Golden Slam (Winning all four Grand Slams and Gold in the Olympics).\n\n#3 Jarkko Nieminen defeated Bernard Tomic in 28 minutes\n\nWhile one might argue that shorter matches are more likely to occur in the early rounds with qualifiers, still a player has to be at the top of their fitness to play such a game of Tennis. Jarkko Nieminen playing in the penultimate year of his professional career showed how fitness can improve performance by registering a win in 28 minutes.\n\nThe Finnish player opened his 2014 Miami Masters journey against Bernard Tomic, who was coming off a stunning win against the then-World No.6 Juan Martin Del Potro. But more than Tomic’s form, the fitness of Nieminen turned out to be superior as he finished off the game in 28 minutes, recording the shortest game in Masters Tour history.\n\nTrending Indian Sports articles\n\nIndonesia Open 2024: Updated schedule, fixtures, results, live streaming details\n\nIndian Sports Calendar June 2024: Major events to look forward to this month\n\nTop 10 most followed sports in India in 2024\n\nWhat are the qualification marks of all Track & Field events for Paris Olympics 2024?\n\nList of Indian athletes to have secured qualification for Paris Olympics 2024\n\n#2 Francisco Clavet defeated Jiang Shan in 25 minutes\n\nThe Spaniards have always been giant slayers in Tennis and during the 1980s and 1990s when a tall southpaw in Francisco Clavet was a forerunner in it. He has a habit of securing wins against World No. 1 players and his win list includes John McEnroe, Mats Wilander, Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, and Roger Federer in their only meeting.\n\nHis list of accolades includes the record for winning the quickest game in the history of Men’s Singles. The southpaw took on Jiang Shan, husband of Li Na in the first round of the 2001 Shanghai Open. It was a clean sweep as he rolled past him with a scoreline of 6-0, 6-0 win, finishing the game in 25 minutes.\n\n#1 Susan Tutt defeated Marion Boundy in 20 Minutes\n\nThe Surrey Championships considered a warm-up event for Wimbledon, proved its significance in terms of results during the 1969 edition. That same year, Wimbledon, the oldest tennis tournament, witnessed the second-shortest match in tennis history and the shortest in any Grand Slam event. In the first round, Leicester-born player Susan M. Tutt faced Marion Boundy.\n\nTutt dominated her opponent, winning 6-2, 6-0 in just 20 minutes to secure her first victory in the tournament. This match remained her best performance at Wimbledon, as she never advanced past the second round. The following year, Susan found herself on the receiving end of a similar result when she lost 6-0, 6-0 to Judy."
