        "text": "Aussies call their island nation Oz, and we all know that\n\nteenage girls arrive in Oz by tornado. In the case of Australian\n\nOpen champion Martina Hingis, the twister conveying her touched\n\ndown and kept on twisting.\n\nFor two weeks Hingis capered around Melbourne, and nothing could\n\nsubdue her--not heat, brushfire or the pestilence of first-week\n\nupsets that felled six of the top seven women's seeds. The\n\n16-year-old fourth seed from Switzerland went in-line skating\n\nalong the banks of the Yarra River and in the parking lot behind\n\nthe National Tennis Centre. She dropped some of her new wealth\n\nin the city's boutiques. She went riding and fell unharmed from\n\nher horse, a mare named (of course) Magic Girl.\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. last Thursday, Hingis was still on court with\n\nNatasha Zvereva, finishing off Gigi Fernandez and Arantxa\n\nSanchez Vicario, the world's No. 1 doubles team, in the\n\nsemifinals. Over the next 70 minutes Hingis took a shower, got a\n\nmassage and grabbed a bite at her hotel. As she and Melanie\n\nMolitor--her mother, coach and roommate--sprinted the block to\n\nthe Regent Theatre to catch the 8 p.m. curtain of Sunset\n\nBoulevard, a photographer in pursuit tripped, fell and wound up\n\nwith a mouthful of Melbourne macadam.\n\nIf all this makes it seem that tennis was incidental to Hingis,\n\nit was. She didn't so much win her first Grand Slam singles\n\ntitle as toss it off. She never dropped a set in the fortnight,\n\nand she needed only 59 minutes to be done with Mary Pierce in\n\nthe final last Saturday, 6-2, 6-2, to become the youngest female\n\nwinner at a major since 1887, when 15-year-old Charlotte\n\n(Lottie) Dod won Wimbledon.\n\nLottie Dod, lah-dee-dah. \"It's just another record for me,\"\n\nHingis said after being asked if the achievement meant anything\n\nto her. \"I mean, I have so many records already.\"\n\nWhen Hingis and her mother arrived in Australia for the Sydney\n\nInternational right after New Year's, Molitor didn't believe\n\nHingis was in condition to win a Grand Slam tournament. They had\n\nspent Christmas with Molitor's mother in Roznov, in the Czech\n\nRepublic, where temperatures were in the single digits and\n\nHingis had little chance to train. \"I'm ready,\" Hingis insisted\n\nafter she won in Sydney.\n\n\"Then show me,\" Molitor reportedly said.\n\nMatter-of-fact exchanges like that are commonplace between this\n\nmother and daughter. At the Lipton Championships in Key\n\nBiscayne, Fla., last March, after Hingis lost her second-round\n\nmatch to a player with a triple-digit ranking, Nana Miyagi of\n\nJapan, Molitor told Hingis she wasn't working hard enough.\n\nHingis responded by saying she found practice boring.\n\n\"It's either tennis or school,\" her mother told her. \"Choose now.\"\n\nThe difference between Molitor and the proverbial Tennis Parent\n\nfrom Hell is that she gives her daughter choices. Hingis and her\n\nmother are determined to avoid the troubles of two other players\n\nwith omnipresent parents, Pierce and Jennifer Capriati. Pierce's\n\ncareer was sidetracked by an abusive relationship with her coach\n\nand father, and Capriati's by a lack of motivation and a drug\n\narrest. \"We're not going to make the same mistakes,\" Hingis\n\nsays. \"In every family there are sometimes problems. Especially\n\nbecause she's my coach and my mother, sometimes I'm against what\n\nshe wants me to do. But right now we have a great relationship.\"\n\nThey're both sensitive to suggestions that Molitor might be\n\nstealing her daughter's childhood. \"Traveling is an even better\n\neducation than sitting eight hours a day in class,\" Hingis says.\n\n\"I'm learning all the cultures, all the different nationalities\n\nand mentalities. When I first came here, I didn't know that\n\nCanberra is the capital city.\"\n\nUnlike some prodigies who came before her, Hingis has never been\n\nincarcerated in a sun-baked Florida tennis gulag. At her home in\n\nTrubbach, in German-speaking eastern Switzerland, she has a\n\ncourt made of the same Rebound Ace composition surface on which\n\nthe Australian Open is played, but she says she never practices\n\nmore than two hours a day and doesn't lift weights. She fills\n\nmuch of her time with mountain biking, soccer, skiing, aerobics,\n\nin-line skating, riding (she has two horses, Montana and\n\nSorrenta) and walks through the woods with her German shepherd,\n\nZorro. The only hint of the lash is that Molitor coaches Hingis\n\nin their native Czech tongue because, Molitor says, \"I can't\n\nswear as quickly in German.\"\n\nIf comparisons with other phenoms are inevitable, Molitor\n\nprefers to invoke Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger, the former\n\nteen stars who had successful if injury-truncated careers.\n\n\"Austin and Jaeger are happy people today, and someone should\n\npoint that out,\" Molitor says. \"Tennis is just a short stage of\n\nyour life, and it can be good preparation for the rest of it. I\n\nwant it to help Martina become independent and self-analytical\n\nuntil someday she finds a partner. And I don't mean a doubles\n\npartner.\"\n\nWhen Hingis made her pro debut at 14, she had the look of a\n\nChris Evert-style baseliner. Now, with more sting in her serve\n\nand a knack for knowing when to go to the net, she's beginning\n\nto hint at the all-court skills of the woman she was named\n\nafter, Martina Navratilova.\n\nHingis's smile is part of the package, and it's not easily\n\nsuppressed. Against Pierce she put away a short ball with a\n\ntopspin forehand and grinned. After match point she embraced her\n\nmother, still grinning. \"If we could play so well, we'd all be\n\nsmiling, too,\" Molitor said afterward.\n\nHingis even smiles when no other player would dare to--after a\n\nnet-cord winner, when the player striking the shot often raises\n\na hand in ritual apology, the most insincere gesture in tennis.\n\nHingis was the beneficiary of just such a net cord to go up 3-0\n\non Pierce in the first set, and though she raised her hand\n\nobligatorily, she grinned. That's because there's no\n\ndisingenuousness to her yet, and at times a little would serve\n\nher well. Her title vaulted her to No. 2 in the world, and--this\n\nwill not go unnoticed by current No. 1 Steffi Graf--Hingis says\n\nonly injury can keep her from taking the top ranking this year.\n\n\"Next time I have to play mixed doubles,\" she said in her\n\nvictory speech, after referring to the women's doubles title she\n\nand Zvereva ended up winning, \"but I have to give someone else a\n\nchance to win an event.\"\n\nShe will become more politic, more mature. For now a wheezy\n\ngiggle encroaches on the back half of every second or third\n\nsentence she utters. She has likened one opponent, Amanda\n\nCoetzer, to Speedy Gonzales. And while most players on the tour\n\nprefer clingy aerobic wear, Hingis's taste runs toward classic\n\npleated skirts.\n\n\"I showed you,\" Hingis told her mother in the locker room right\n\nafter the final.\n\n\"Yes,\" Molitor replied, \"and I can't say I'm unhappy about it.\"\n\nAs well-positioned as Hingis seems to be to survive adolescence,\n\non the eve of the final The Independent of London published a\n\ndisquieting interview with her father, Karol Hingis. He\n\ndescribed himself as an unemployed tennis coach who earns $166 a\n\nmonth as a maintenance man at a club in the Slovak city of\n\nKosice, where Martina was born. He said that since he and\n\nMolitor split, when Martina was six--mother and daughter moved\n\nto Switzerland a year later--he has only occasionally seen his\n\ndaughter and hasn't shared in her riches. \"It is a dream of mine\n\nto be able to train Martina one day,\" Karol told The\n\nIndependent. \"I know that Melanie doesn't want that. She thinks\n\nthat I have a bad influence on Martinka.\"\n\nWhile women's tennis seems unable to produce a teen champion\n\nwithout some attendant melodrama, Pete Sampras, who defeated\n\nCarlos Moya of Spain 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in the men's final on Sunday,\n\nhas calmly plowed to nine major titles since winning the 1990\n\nU.S. Open at age 19. Sampras's toughest match in Melbourne came\n\nagainst Dominik Hrbaty, a Slovak-born 19-year-old who made the\n\n25-year-old No. 1 seem like a geezer twice over: First, Hrbaty\n\nrevealed that three years ago he had asked Sampras for an\n\nautograph; then he pushed Sampras to an exhausting fifth set in\n\ntheir fourth-round match. \"I could have easily been watching the\n\nSuper Bowl back in the States,\" Sampras would say.\n\nThat he wasn't can be credited to Sampras's professionalism.\n\nUnlike a number of other pros, he didn't bitch endlessly about\n\nthe heat or dwell on his opinion that the balls were\n\nsuspiciously soft, even though soft balls would handicap his\n\nbooming game. When Australia's Mark Woodforde finally held serve\n\nafter dropping 13 straight games during his third-round match\n\nwith Sampras, Woodforde bowed self-mockingly to the home crowd,\n\nbut Sampras was the anti-Hingis, not permitting himself even a\n\nsmile. Facing Hrbaty on the hottest day of the tournament, he\n\nshortened the rallies, husbanding his energy by going for aces\n\nand winners. \"Pete has a lot of gears he can go to,\" says his\n\ncoach, Paul Annacone. \"And he has an innate ability to know\n\nwhich one to use.\"\n\nSampras unfurled the shot of the tournament in his straight-set\n\nsemifinal defeat of Thomas Muster: an ankle-high backhand winner\n\nfrom out of court, around the post and past the ball boy, which\n\nevoked an I-am-not-worthy salaam from an opponent usually known\n\nfor his Schwarzeneggerian swagger. Only Sampras could have made\n\nthe Musterminator look as if he had stepped out of Wayne's\n\nWorld, and only Sampras, who subsists on a regimen of cable,\n\nmovies and room service during Grand Slams, could ask impishly,\n\n\"Did it make 'Play of the Day'?\"\n\nWith his triumph in Melbourne he has won more than $26 million\n\nin tournament prize money. Hingis has won only about $2.1\n\nmillion, but she made her first million sooner than any player\n\nof either gender. It's odd to hear a Swiss citizen marvel at how\n\na bank account works, but after Hingis announced on Jan. 14 that\n\nshe had signed an incentive-sweetened deal with sportswear\n\nmanufacturer Sergio Tacchini that could be worth as much as $10\n\nmillion, she rhapsodized about the concept of liquid assets.\n\n\"You can get this money out!\" she said, revealing that she had\n\nbought her mother a ring. Hingis particularly likes to spend\n\nmoney, she added, \"on big cities.\"\n\nShe probably meant in big cities, even if she was about to put a\n\ndown payment on Melbourne. But during this still-young year she\n\nhas done right by the prepositions that mattered: Down and\n\nUnder, and up and atop.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: RON ANGLE Hingis's fortnight was a whirl of skating, horseback riding and winning singles and doubles titles.
