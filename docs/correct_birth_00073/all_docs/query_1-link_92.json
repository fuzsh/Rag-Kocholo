With Zvereva, Gigi amassed an impressive 14 Grand Slam titles.

They hold the second-longest Grand Slam doubles title streak in Open Era history, winning six in a row from the French Open in 1992 through Wimbledon in 1993 (second to Martina Navratilova / Pam Shriver's record of eight). The pair also completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam that ran from the 1992 French Open to the 1993 Australian Open. Fernandez and Zvereva were named the WTA Doubles Team of the Year on four occasions: 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997.. She reached a career high singles ranking of 17 in 1991.
