        "text": "Larisa Neiland, winner of six Grand Slam titles in doubles, has been stripped of $15,000 in prize money after testing positive for caffeine at the 1999 Australian Open.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation said Tuesday that Neiland, a 33-year-old from Latvia, had committed a doping offence.\n\nUnder anti-doping rules of the International Olympic Committee and the ITF, caffeine is listed as a stimulant. A test is deemed positive when the levels of caffeine exceed 12 micrograms per millilitre.\n\nNeiland received a warning and will forfeit the money she won at the 1999 Australian Open, where she and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario lost in the quarter-finals to Venus and Serena Williams.\n\nA second offence for caffeine or a similar substance would result in a three-month suspension.\n\nAlthough the positive test took place a year-and-a-half, the ITF withheld its announcement until the appeals process had been completed.\n\nNeiland, who was born in Ukraine, has won four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles and two doubles championships.\n\nShe became the first Soviet player to win a Wimbledon title when she teamed with Natasha Zvereva to capture the doubles in 1991. Latvia was still a Soviet republic at the time.\n\nWhile Neiland has scaled back her playing career, she played doubles at the just-completed Wimbledon, losing with partner Lina Krasnoroutskaya in the first round to eventual finalists Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama."
