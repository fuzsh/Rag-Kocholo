        "text": "Bio Victoria Fyodarauna Azarenka was born on July 31, 1989 in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union to Alla and Fyodor Azarenka in a middle-class Catholic family. She is a former world No. 1 in singles and was the year-end No. 1 in 2012. Azarenka has won 21 WTA singles titles, nine WTA doubles titles, and three mixed-doubles titles. She has won two Australian Open singles titles (2012 and 2013), becoming the only Belarusian player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title. Azarenka is also a three-time major finalist at the US Open, finishing runner-up to Serena Williams in both 2012 and 2013 and to Naomi Osaka in 2020.\n\nHer other major achievements include winning six Premier Mandatory tournaments including the Sunshine Double in 2016, the singles bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, two mixed doubles Grand Slam titles—the 2007 US Open with Max Mirnyi and the 2008 French Open with Bob Bryan—and the gold medal in the mixed doubles at the 2012 Summer Olympics with Max Mirnyi.\n\nHer tennis idol is German former player Steffi Graf. In an interview, Azarenka stated: \"Graf's Calendar Golden Slam in 1988 is my biggest motivation.\"\n\nAt age 15, Azarenka moved full-time to Scot,tsdale, Arizona, United States, from Minsk, Belarus, to train and live. In this she was aided by National Hockey League goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and his wife, who is a friend of Azarenka's mother.\n\nAzarenka debuted on the ITF junior tour in November 2003 in Israel, winning one doubles title with countrywoman Olga Govortsova. At Wimbledon, Azarenka reached the semifinals of the girls' competition, only to be defeated by eventual runner-up Ana Ivanovic, despite having two match points in the marathon third set. She continued to participate in ITF tournaments in 2004, and at the end of the season she had a rank of 508 on WTA singles tour.\n\nAzarenka had a successful year in 2005, winning two junior Grand Slams: the Australian (she would eventually win the seniors' competition in 2012 and 2013) and US championships. She ended the season as the junior world No. 1 and was named the 2005 World Champion by the ITF, becoming the first Belarusian to do so. In addition, she reached her first semifinal on the main tour in Guangzhou, China. She went from the qualifying draw of the tournament to the main draw, where she defeated Martina Suchá and Peng Shuai, before losing to the eventual champion Yan Zi.\n\nIn February 2006 in Memphis, Azarenka defeated her first top-20 player, Nicole Vaidišová, and defeated her second top-30 player in Jelena Janković at Miami that same year. On clay, Azarenka pushed 2004 French Open champion Anastasia Myskina to a third set in Rome, and took clay-court specialist Anabel Medina Garrigues to 9–7 in the third set in the first round at Roland Garros. At the 2006 Wimbledon Championships Azarenka lost in first round to 2005 Junior Wimbledon and 2006 Junior French Open Champion and Wildcard Agnieszka Radwańska.\n\nAt the 2006 US Open, she had her first win over Myskina in the first round, and lost to Anna Chakvetadze in the third round, her best result in a Grand Slam event to that date.

At the same tournament, Azarenka and her doubles partner Tatiana Poutchek, also of Belarus, lost in the final to the world No. 3 team of Liezel Huber and Cara Black, in three sets. Azarenka's results at the Kremlin Cup elevated her rankings to career highs of world No. 27 in singles and world No. 29 in doubles.\n\nAzarenka began the 2008 year at the Australian Women's Hardcourts tournament in Gold Coast. Unseeded, she reached the semifinals, where she beat fifth-seeded Shahar Pe'er of Israel, Azarenka's sixth top-20 victory. In her third career WTA Tour final, she lost to Li Na, but the points she earned in this tournament were enough to improve her ranking to a career-best world No. 25.\n\nAzarenka was seeded 26th at the Australian Open. This was her first appearance as a seeded player in a Grand Slam singles tournament. She showed no ill effects from a leg injury while winning her first two matches, but lost in the third round to seventh-seeded, defending champion and future rival Serena Williams.

In her second match, however, Azarenka was defeated by Caroline Wozniacki. Azarenka failed to convert a match point in the final set in which she led by a break on four occasions. Azarenka also conceded her serve at 5–5, to leave Wozniacki serving for the match after receiving a point penalty for racket abuse. Due to her loss to Wozniacki, Azarenka had to defeat second alternate Agnieszka Radwańska to qualify for the semifinals. She led with a double break, before going on to lose nine of the next ten games, eventually conceding the match and retiring while trailing in the third set, citing severe cramping.\n\nAzarenka ended the year ranked world No. 7, with a 45–15 win–loss record, having won three titles and qualified for the year-end championships for the first time in her career.\n\nAzarenka began the 2010 season at the Hong Kong Tennis Classic exhibition.

Azarenka defeated Maria Sharapova in the final, after defeating top seed Samantha Stosur in the semifinals, to win her first title since April 2009. The win propelled Azarenka to world No. 12. Despite being the favourite to win the Mercury Insurance Open, Azarenka withdrew to recover from a right shoulder injury.\n\nSeeded ninth at the Western & Southern Open, Azarenka was stunned in the first round by world No. 62, Ana Ivanovic, despite serving for the match twice in the second set, and being within two points of victory on Ivanovic's serve; it was Azarenka's second defeat by Ivanovic in 2010. However, she won the doubles title, partnering with Maria Kirilenko, defeating Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. September 1, 2010, daytime, at the US Open, losing 0–4 during her second round against Gisela Dulko, Azarenka collapsed on the court. There were concerns that the cause of the fall was heat-related.

She said later it was because her personal life was \"extremely stressful\". Former world No. 5 Daniela Hantuchova said:\n\n\"The most disrespectful thing about this is how she walked off the court without really giving a reason (for retiring). I think the WTA will really have to look into this. This one for me is really bizarre and really disrespectful to the crowd, to the umpire and most importantly to Linda (Fruhvirtova). I think Vika (Azarenka) just knows if she kept going this way she would be off the court anyway very shortly.\"\n\nSix months later, former world No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska said: \"She has done theatre more than once before, she has faked injuries etc... I think: 'God, girl ... You're 33, you've got everything on the court, you're a mom. And you do something like that!' It is completely incomprehensible to me.\"\n\nDuring the clay-court season, she reached the round of 16 while playing at the Madrid Open and at the Italian Open.

The points earned in the tournament moved her to ranking #16 in the world.\n\nAzarenka is an aggressive baseliner, who is known for hitting the ball hard, flat, and early on the rise. Due to her playing style, she typically hits large numbers of winners in any match; despite this, she hits fewer unforced errors than similarly aggressive players, as her game is built around controlled aggression. Despite hitting her groundstrokes with relentless depth and power, Azarenka aims to move her opponents around the court, counterpunching until she can create the opportunity to hit a low-risk winner.\n\nAzarenka's strongest groundstroke is her two-handed backhand, which she uses to dominate opponents on the court; she is widely considered to have one of the greatest backhands of all time. Her signature shot is her backhand down-the-line. Azarenka also possesses a strong forehand, with which she can rally effectively and hit winners, although her forehand is more vulnerable than her backhand; as such, players who are acquainted with her game target her forehand. Azarenka possesses a powerful first serve, which has been recorded as high as 111 mph (179 km/h), allowing her to serve aces. Despite her strong first serve, her second serve is known for its volatility; when nervous, Azarenka typically commits a significant number of double faults. Her inconsistencies on serve are balanced by her return game, with her being described as one of the greatest return players in the history of the WTA Tour. She is known for her ability to neutralise powerful first serves, and punish short second serves.\n\nAzarenka is known for her movement, speed, court coverage, footwork, and balance, allowing her to blend offence and defence effectively, and to execute her aggressive, yet controlled playing style effectively. Despite typically playing from the baseline, Azarenka is a capable net player due to her doubles experience, and she is adept at attacking the net when the opportunity arises. Azarenka is known for her mental strength and competitive spirit, and was described by Sloane Stephens as a \"tough competitor\". Azarenka prefers to play on hard courts, where the regular bounce and moderate pace suit her aggressive, yet measured, playing style. Azarenka is commonly regarded as a hard court specialist, due to the fact that all but one of her 21 singles titles have been won on hard courts. Due to her strong two-handed backhand, exceptional return game, mental strength, and preference for hard courts, she has been compared to Novak Djokovic.\n\nAzarenka has had several coaches through the years. Between 2005 and 2009, she was coached by António van Grichen, and she was coached by Sam Sumyk from 2010 to 2015, with whom she won her two Grand Slam titles, and reached No. 1 in the world; their partnership finished after an injury plagued 2014 season. She was coached by Wim Fissette between 2015 and 2016, until she became pregnant, and, upon her return from pregnancy in 2017, she was coached by Michael Joyce. In November 2018, Azarenka reunited with Fissette until December 2019, when he became Naomi Osaka's coach. In February 2020, Azarenka announced Dorian Descloix as her new coach, and has experienced renewed success with Descloix, returning to the upper echelon of women's tennis. Azarenka split from Descloix in October 2021, instead choosing to work with Maxime Tchoutakian.\n\nThroughout her career, Victoria Azarenka has established rivalries with other players on the WTA Tour. Her rivalries with Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova are among the most significant on the WTA Tour, as all three players have met each other at least fifteen times."
