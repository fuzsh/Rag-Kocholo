        "text": "Unimolecular decomposition reactions at low-pressure: A comparison of competitive methods\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdams, G. F.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe lack of a simple rate coefficient expression to describe the pressure and temperature dependence hampers chemical modeling of flame systems. Recently developed simplified models to describe unimolecular processes include the calculation of rate constants for thermal unimolecular reactions and recombinations at the low pressure limit, at the high pressure limit and in the intermediate fall-off region. Comparison between two different applications of Troe's simplified model and a comparison between the simplified model and the classic RRKM theory are described.\n\nAn approximate classical unimolecular reaction rate theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Meishan; Rice, Stuart A.\n\n1992-05-01\n\nWe describe a classical theory of unimolecular reaction rate which is derived from the analysis of Davis and Gray by use of simplifying approximations. These approximations concern the calculation of the locations of, and the fluxes of phase points across, the bottlenecks to fragmentation and to intramolecular energy transfer. The bottleneck to fragment separation is represented as a vibration-rotation state dependent separatrix, which approximation is similar to but extends and improves the approximations for the separatrix introduced by Gray, Rice, and Davis and by Zhao and Rice. The novel feature in our analysis is the representation of the bottlenecks to intramolecular energy transfer as dividing surfaces in phase space; the locations of these dividing surfaces are determined by the same conditions as locate the remnants of robust tori with frequency ratios related to the golden mean (in a two degree of freedom system these are the cantori). The flux of phase points across each dividing surface is calculated with an analytic representation instead of a stroboscopic mapping. The rate of unimolecular reaction is identified with the net rate at which phase points escape from the region of quasiperiodic bounded motion to the region of free fragment motion by consecutively crossing the dividing surfaces for intramolecular energy exchange and the separatrix. This new theory generates predictions of the rates of predissociation of the van der Waals molecules HeI2, NeI2 and ArI2 which are in very good agreement with available experimental data.\n\nUnimolecular reaction of acetone oxide and its reaction with water in the atmosphere.\n\nPubMed\n\nLong, Bo; Bao, Junwei Lucas; Truhlar, Donald G\n\n2018-05-29\n\nCriegee intermediates (i.e., carbonyl oxides with two radical sites) are known to be important atmospheric reagents; however, our knowledge of their reaction kinetics is still limited. Although experimental methods have been developed to directly measure the reaction rate constants of stabilized Criegee intermediates, the experimental results cover limited temperature ranges and do not completely agree well with one another. Here we investigate the unimolecular reaction of acetone oxide [(CH 3 ) 2 COO] and its bimolecular reaction with H 2 O to obtain rate constants with quantitative accuracy comparable to experimental accuracy. We do this by using CCSDT(Q)/CBS//CCSD(T)-F12a/DZ-F12 benchmark results to select and validate exchange-correlation functionals, which are then used for direct dynamics calculations by variational transition state theory with small-curvature tunneling and torsional and high-frequency anharmonicity. We find that tunneling is very significant in the unimolecular reaction of (CH 3 ) 2 COO and its bimolecular reaction with H 2 O. We show that the atmospheric lifetimes of (CH 3 ) 2 COO depend on temperature and that the unimolecular reaction of (CH 3 ) 2 COO is the dominant decay mode above 240 K, while the (CH 3 ) 2 COO + SO 2 reaction can compete with the corresponding unimolecular reaction below 240 K when the SO 2 concentration is 9 Ã 10 10 molecules per cubic centimeter. We also find that experimental results may not be sufficiently accurate for the unimolecular reaction of (CH 3 ) 2 COO above 310 K. Not only does the present investigation provide insights into the decay of (CH 3 ) 2 COO in the atmosphere, but it also provides an illustration of how to use theoretical methods to predict quantitative rate constants of medium-sized Criegee intermediates.\n\nUnimolecular rectifiers and proposed unimolecular amplifier.\n\nPubMed\n\nMetzger, Robert M\n\n2003-12-01\n\nThe rectification by three molecules that form Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers between gold electrodes is reviewed, along with a proposal for the means to obtain gain in a unimolecular amplifier, the molecular analog of a bipolar junction transistor.\n\nTheoretical studies on the unimolecular decomposition of ethylene glycol.\n\nPubMed\n\nYe, Lili; Zhao, Long; Zhang, Lidong; Qi, Fei\n\n2012-01-12\n\nThe unimolecular decomposition processes of ethylene glycol have been investigated with the QCISD(T) method with geometries optimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Among the decomposition channels identified, the H(2)O-elimination channels have the lowest barriers, and the C-C bond dissociation is the lowest-energy dissociation channel among the barrierless reactions (the direct bond cleavage reactions). The temperature and pressure dependent rate constant calculations show that the H(2)O-elimination reactions are predominant at low temperature, whereas at high temperature, the direct C-C bond dissociation reaction is dominant. At 1 atm, in the temperature range 500-2000 K, the calculated rate constant is expressed to be 7.63 Ã 10(47)T(-10.38) exp(-42262/T) for the channel CH(2)OHCH(2)OH â CH(2)CHOH + H(2)O, and 2.48 Ã 10(51)T(-11.58) exp(-43593/T) for the channel CH(2)OHCH(2)OH â CH(3)CHO + H(2)O, whereas for the direct bond dissociation reaction CH(2)OHCH(2)OH â CH(2)OH + CH(2)OH the rate constant expression is 1.04 Ã 10(71)T(-16.16) exp(-52414/T).\n\nDirect picosecond time resolution of unimolecular reactions initiated by local mode excitation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nScherer, N. F.; Doany, F. E.; Zewail, A. H.; Perry, J. W.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAttention is given to the first results of direct, picosec measurements of the Delta-nu(OH) 5 local mode transition of H2O2. These time-resolved studies yield a direct measure of the unimolecular dissociation rate, and furnish a lower limit for the rate of energy redistribution from the OH stretch to the O-O reaction coordinate. The data thus determined may be used to ascertain the domain of validity for statistical unimolecular reaction rate theories.\n\nAbsolute rate constants of alkoxyl radical reactions in aqueous solution. [Tert-butyl hydroperoxide\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nErben-Russ, M.; Michel, C.; Bors, W.\n\n1987-04-23\n\nThe pulse radiolysis technique was used to generate the alkoxyl radical derived from tert-butyl hydroperoxide (/sup t/BuOOH) in aqueous solution. The reactions of this radical with 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-6-benzothiazolinesulfonate) (ABTS) and promethazine were monitored by kinetic spectroscopy. The unimolecular decay rate constant of the tert-butoxyl radical (/sup t/BuO) was determined to be 1.4 x 10/sup 6/ s/sup -1/. On the basis of this value, the rate constants for /sup t/BuO attack on quercetin, crocin, crocetin, ascorbate, isoascorbate, trolox c, glutathione, thymidine, adenosine, guanosine, and unsaturated fatty acids were determined. In addition, the reaction of /sup t/BuO with the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)moreÂ Â» was observed by directly monitoring the formation of the fatty acid pentadienyl radicals. Interestingly, the attack of /sup t/BuO on PUFA was found to be faster by about one order of magnitude as compared to the same reaction in a nonpolar solvent.Â«Â less\n\nUse of Direct Dynamics Simulations to Determine Unimolecular Reaction Paths and Arrhenius Parameters for Large Molecules.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Li; Sun, Rui; Hase, William L\n\n2011-11-08\n\nIn a previous study (J. Chem. Phys.2008, 129, 094701) it was shown that for a large molecule, with a total energy much greater than its barrier for decomposition and whose vibrational modes are harmonic oscillators, the expressions for the classical Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) (i.e., RRK) and classical transition-state theory (TST) rate constants become equivalent. Using this relationship, a molecule's unimolecular rate constants versus temperature may be determined from chemical dynamics simulations of microcanonical ensembles for the molecule at different total energies. The simulation identifies the molecule's unimolecular pathways and their Arrhenius parameters. In the work presented here, this approach is used to study the thermal decomposition of CH3-NH-CHâCH-CH3, an important constituent in the polymer of cross-linked epoxy resins. Direct dynamics simulations, at the MP2/6-31+G* level of theory, were used to investigate the decomposition of microcanonical ensembles for this molecule. The Arrhenius A and Ea parameters determined from the direct dynamics simulation are in very good agreement with the TST Arrhenius parameters for the MP2/6-31+G* potential energy surface. The simulation method applied here may be particularly useful for large molecules with a multitude of decomposition pathways and whose transition states may be difficult to determine and have structures that are not readily obvious.\n\nA simple method relating specific rate constants k(E,J) and Thermally averaged rate constants k(infinity)(T) of unimolecular bond fission and the reverse barrierless association reactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nTroe, J; Ushakov, V G\n\n2006-06-01\n\nThis work describes a simple method linking specific rate constants k(E,J) of bond fission reactions AB --> A + B with thermally averaged capture rate constants k(cap)(T) of the reverse barrierless combination reactions A + B --> AB (or the corresponding high-pressure dissociation or recombination rate constants k(infinity)(T)). Practical applications are given for ionic and neutral reaction systems. The method, in the first stage, requires a phase-space theoretical treatment with the most realistic minimum energy path potential available, either from reduced dimensionality ab initio or from model calculations of the potential, providing the centrifugal barriers E(0)(J). The effects of the anisotropy of the potential afterward are expressed in terms of specific and thermal rigidity factors f(rigid)(E,J) and f(rigid)(T), respectively. Simple relationships provide a link between f(rigid)(E,J) and f(rigid)(T) where J is an average value of J related to J(max)(E), i.e., the maximum J value compatible with E > or = E0(J), and f(rigid)(E,J) applies to the transitional modes. Methods for constructing f(rigid)(E,J) from f(rigid)(E,J) are also described. The derived relationships are adaptable and can be used on that level of information which is available either from more detailed theoretical calculations or from limited experimental information on specific or thermally averaged rate constants. The examples used for illustration are the systems C6H6+ <==> C6H5+ + H, C8H10+ --> C7H7+ + CH3, n-C9H12+ <==> C7H7+ + C2H5, n-C10H14+ <==> C7H7+ + C3H7, HO2 <==> H + O2, HO2 <==> HO + O, and H2O2 <==> 2HO.\n\nZero-Point Energy Constraint for Unimolecular Dissociation Reactions. Giving Trajectories Multiple Chances To Dissociate Correctly.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaul, Amit K; Hase, William L\n\n2016-01-28\n\nA zero-point energy (ZPE) constraint model is proposed for classical trajectory simulations of unimolecular decomposition and applied to CH4* â H + CH3 decomposition. With this model trajectories are not allowed to dissociate unless they have ZPE in the CH3 product. If not, they are returned to the CH4* region of phase space and, if necessary, given additional opportunities to dissociate with ZPE. The lifetime for dissociation of an individual trajectory is the time it takes to dissociate with ZPE in CH3, including multiple possible returns to CH4*. With this ZPE constraint the dissociation of CH4* is exponential in time as expected for intrinsic RRKM dynamics and the resulting rate constant is in good agreement with the harmonic quantum value of RRKM theory. In contrast, a model that discards trajectories without ZPE in the reaction products gives a CH4* â H + CH3 rate constant that agrees with the classical and not quantum RRKM value. The rate constant for the purely classical simulation indicates that anharmonicity may be important and the rate constant from the ZPE constrained classical trajectory simulation may not represent the complete anharmonicity of the RRKM quantum dynamics. The ZPE constraint model proposed here is compared with previous models for restricting ZPE flow in intramolecular dynamics, and connecting product and reactant/product quantum energy levels in chemical dynamics simulations.\n\nVariational RRKM theory calculation of thermal rate constant for carbonâhydrogen bond fission reaction of nitro benzene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManesh, Afshin Taghva; Heidarnezhad, Zabi alah; Masnabadi, Nasrin\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThe present work provides quantitative results for the rate of unimolecular carbon-hydrogen bond fission reaction of benzene and nitro benzene at elevated temperatures up to 2000 K. The potential energy surface for each C-H (in the ortho, meta, and para sites) bond fission reaction of nitro benzene was investigated by ab initio calculations. The geometry and vibrational frequencies of the species involved in this process were optimized at the MP2 level of theory, using the cc-pvdz basis set. Since C-H bond fission channel is barrier less reaction, we have used variational RRKM theory to predict rate constants. By means of calculated rate constant at the different temperatures, the activation energy and exponential factor were determined. The Arrhenius expression for C-H bond fission reaction of nitro benzene on the ortho, meta and para sites are k( T) = 2.1 Ã 1017exp(-56575.98/ T), k( T) = 2.1 Ã 1017exp(-57587.45/ T), and k( T) = 3.3 Ã 1016exp(-57594.79/ T) respectively. The Arrhenius expression for C-H bond fission reaction of benzene is k( T) = 2 Ã 1018exp(-59343.48.18/ T). The effect of NO2 group, location of hydrogen atoms on the substituted benzene ring, reaction degeneracy, benzene ring resonance and tunneling effect on the rate expression have been discussed.\n\nA Chemical Activation Study of the Unimolecular Reactions of CD3CD2CHCl2 and CHCl2CHCl2 with Analysis of the 1,1-HCl Elimination Pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nLarkin, Allie C; Nestler, Matthew J; Smith, Caleb A; Heard, George L; Setser, Donald W; Holmes, Bert E\n\n2016-10-03\n\nChemically activated C2D5CHCl2 molecules were generated with 88 kcal mol-1 of vibrational energy by the recombination of C2D5 and CHCl2 radicals in a room temperature bath gas. The competing 2,1-DCl and 1,1-HCl unimolecular reactions were identified by the observation of the CD3CD=CHCl and CD3CD=CDCl products. The initial CD3CD2C-Cl carbene product from 1,1-HCl elimination rearranges to CD3CD=CDCl under the conditions of the experiments. The experimental rate constants were 2.7 x107 and 0.47 x107 s-1 for 2,1-DCl and 1,1-HCl elimination reactions, respectively, which corresponds to branching fractions of 0.84 and 0.16. The experimental rate constants were compared to calculated statistical rate constants to assign threshold energies of 54 and â 66 kcal mol-1 for the 1,2-DCl and 1,1-HCl reactions, respectively. The statistical rate constants were obtained from models developed from electronic-structure calculations for the molecule and its transition states. The rate constant (5.3 x 107 s-1) for the unimolecular decomposition of CHCl2CHCl2 molecules formed with 82 kcal mol-1 of vibrational energy by the recombination of CHCl2 radicals also is reported. Based upon the magnitude of the calculated rate constant, 1,1-HCl elimination must contribute less than 15% to the reaction; 1,2-HCl elimination is the major reaction and the threshold energy is 59 kcal mol-1. Calculations also were done to analyze previously published rate constants for chemically activated CD2Cl-CHCl2 molecules with 86 kcal mol-1 of energy in order to obtain a better overall description of the nature of the 1,1-HCl pathway for 1,1-dichloroalkanes. The interplay of the threshold energies for the 2,1-HCl and 1,1-HCl reactions and the available energy determines the product branching fractions for individual molecules. The unusual nature of the transition state for 1,1-HCl elimination is discussed.\n\nHigh-temperature unimolecular decomposition of ethyl propionate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiri, Binod Raj; AlAbbad, Mohammed; Farooq, Aamir\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThis work reports rate coefficients of the thermal unimolecular decomposition reaction of ethyl propionate (EP) behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range of 976-1300 K and pressures of 825-1875 Torr. The reaction progress was monitored by detecting C2H4 near 10.532 Î¼m using CO2 gas laser absorption. In addition, G3//MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and master equation calculations were performed to assess the pressure- and temperature-dependence of the reaction. Our calculations revealed that C2H4 elimination occurs via a six-centered retro-ene transition state. Our measured rate data are close to the high-pressure limit and showed no discernable temperature fall off.\n\nDemonstrating Energy Migration in Coupled Oscillators: A Central Concept in the Theory of Unimolecular Reactions\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMarcotte, Ronald E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis physical chemistry lecture demonstration is designed to aid the understanding of intramolecular energy transfer processes as part of the presentation of the theory of unimolecular reaction rates.

The reaction energies and barriers have been predicted for two isomerization and four dissociation reactions. Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying focal point analyses. Anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies, diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections, relativistic effects, and core correlation corrections are also taken into account. On the singlet PES, the (1)HNO â (1)NOH endothermicity including all corrections is predicted to be 42.23 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1). For the barrierless decomposition of (1)HNO to H + NO, the dissociation energy is estimated to be 47.48 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1). For (1)NOH â H + NO, the reaction endothermicity and barrier are 5.25 Â± 0.2 and 7.88 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1). On the triplet PES the reaction energy and barrier including all corrections are predicted to be 7.73 Â± 0.2 and 39.31 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1) for the isomerization reaction (3)HNO â (3)NOH. For the triplet dissociation reaction (to H + NO) the corresponding results are 29.03 Â± 0.2 and 32.41 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1). Analogous results are 21.30 Â± 0.2 and 33.67 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1) for the dissociation reaction of (3)NOH (to H + NO). Unimolecular rate constants for the isomerization and dissociation reactions were obtained utilizing kinetic modeling methods. The tunneling and kinetic isotope effects are also investigated for these reactions. The adiabatic singlet-triplet energy splittings are predicted to be 18.45 Â± 0.2 and 16.05 Â± 0.2 kcal mol(-1) for HNO and NOH, respectively. Kinetic analyses based on solution of simultaneous first-order ordinary-differential rate equations demonstrate that the singlet NOH molecule will be difficult to prepare at room temperature, while the triplet NOH molecule is viable with respect to isomerization and dissociation reactions up to\n\nDirect observation of unimolecular decay of CH 3 CH 2 CHOO Criegee intermediates to OH radical products\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFang, Yi; Liu, Fang; Klippenstein, Stephen J.\n\n2016-07-28\n\nThe unimolecular decay of carbonyl oxide intermediates, known as Criegee intermediates, produced in alkene ozonolysis is a significant source of OH radicals in the troposphere. Here, the rate of appearance of OH radical products is examined directly in the time-domain for a prototypical alkyl-substituted Criegee intermediate, CH3CH2CHOO, following vibrational activation under collision-free conditions. Complementary statistical Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus calculations of the microcanonical unimolecular decay rate for CH3CH2CHOO are also carried out at energies in the vicinity of the barrier for 1,4 hydrogen atom transfer that leads to OH products. Tunneling through the barrier, derived from high level electronic structure calculations, contributes significantlymoreÂ Â» to the decay rate. Infrared transitions of CH3CH2CHOO are identified in the CH stretch overtone region, which are detected by ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence of the resultant OH products. The features observed are attributed to CH vibrational excitations and conformational forms utilizing insights from theory. Both experiment and theory yield unimolecular decay rates for CH3CH2CHOO of ca. 10(7) s(-1), which are slower than those obtained for syn-CH3CHOO or (CH3)(2)COO reported previously [Fang et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 061102 (2016)] at similar energies. Master equation modeling is also utilized to predict the thermal decay rate of CH3CH2CHOO under atmospheric conditions, giving a rate of 279 s(-1) at 298 K.Â«Â less\n\nElongational flow of polymer melts at constant strain rate, constant stress and constant force\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWagner, Manfred H.; RolÃ³n-Garrido, VÃ­ctor H.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nCharacterization of polymer melts in elongational flow is typically performed at constant elongational rate or rarely at constant tensile stress conditions. One of the disadvantages of these deformation modes is that they are hampered by the onset of \"necking\" instabilities according to the ConsidÃ¨re criterion. Experiments at constant tensile force have been performed even more rarely, in spite of the fact that this deformation mode is free from necking instabilities and is of considerable industrial relevance as it is the correct analogue of steady fiber spinning. It is the objective of the present contribution to present for the first time a full experimental characterization of a long-chain branched polyethylene melt in elongational flow. Experiments were performed at constant elongation rate, constant tensile stress and constant tensile force by use of a Sentmanat Extensional Rheometer (SER) in combination with an Anton Paar MCR301 rotational rheometer. The accessible experimental window and experimental limitations are discussed. The experimental data are modelled by using the Wagner I model. Predictions of the steady-start elongational viscosity in constant strain rate and creep experiments are found to be identical, albeit only by extrapolation of the experimental data to Hencky strains of the order of 6. For constant stress experiments, a minimum in the strain rate and a corresponding maximum in the elongational viscosity is found at a Hencky strain of the order of 3, which, although larger than the steady-state value, follows roughly the general trend of the steady-state elongational viscosity. The constitutive analysis also reveals that constant tensile force experiments indicate a larger strain hardening potential than seen in constant elongation rate or constant tensile stress experiments. This may be indicative of the effect of necking under constant elongation rate or constant tensile stress conditions according to the ConsidÃ¨re criterion.\n\nQuantum chemical and kinetic study of formation of 2-chlorophenoxy radical from 2-chlorophenol: unimolecular decomposition and bimolecular reactions with H, OH, Cl, and O2.\n\nPubMed\n\nAltarawneh, Mohammednoor; Dlugogorski, Bogdan Z; Kennedy, Eric M; Mackie, John C\n\n2008-04-24\n\nThis study investigates the kinetic parameters of the formation of the chlorophenoxy radical from the 2-chlorophenol molecule, a key precursor to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCCD/F), in unimolecular and bimolecular reactions in the gas phase. The study develops the reaction potential energy surface for the unimolecular decomposition of 2-chlorophenol. The migration of the phenolic hydrogen to the ortho-C bearing the hydrogen atom produces 2-chlorocyclohexa-2,4-dienone through an activation barrier of 73.6 kcal/mol (0 K). This route holds more importance than the direct fission of Cl or the phenolic H. Reaction rate constants for the bimolecular reactions, 2-chlorophenol + X --> X-H + 2-chlorophenoxy (X = H, OH, Cl, O2) are calculated and compared with the available experimental kinetics for the analogous reactions of X with phenol. OH reaction with 2-chlorophenol produces 2-chlorophenoxy by direct abstraction rather than through addition and subsequent water elimination. The results of the present study will find applications in the construction of detailed kinetic models describing the formation of PCDD/F in the gas phase.\n\nTubular Unimolecular Transmembrane Channels: Construction Strategy and Transport Activities.\n\nPubMed\n\nSi, Wen; Xin, Pengyang; Li, Zhan-Ting; Hou, Jun-Li\n\n2015-06-16\n\nLipid bilayer membranes separate living cells from their environment. Membrane proteins are responsible for the processing of ion and molecular inputs and exports, sensing stimuli and signals across the bilayers, which may operate in a channel or carrier mechanism. Inspired by these wide-ranging functions of membrane proteins, chemists have made great efforts in constructing synthetic mimics in order to understand the transport mechanisms, create materials for separation, and develop therapeutic agents. Since the report of an alkylated cyclodextrin for transporting Cu(2+) and Co(2+) by Tabushi and co-workers in 1982, chemists have constructed a variety of artificial transmembrane channels by making use of either the multimolecular self-assembly or unimolecular strategy. In the context of the design of unimolecular channels, important advances have been made, including, among others, the tethering of natural gramicidin A or alamethicin and the modification of various macrocycles such as crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils. Many of these unimolecular channels exhibit high transport ability for metal ions, particularly K(+) and Na(+). Concerning the development of artificial channels based on macrocyclic frameworks, one straightforward and efficient approach is to introduce discrete chains to reinforce their capability to insert into bilayers. Currently, this approach has found the widest applications in the systems of crown ethers and calixarenes. We envisioned that for macrocycle-based unimolecular channels, control of the arrangement of the appended chains in the upward and/or downward direction would favor the insertion of the molecular systems into bilayers, while the introduction of additional interactions among the chains would further stabilize a tubular conformation. Both factors should be helpful for the formation of new efficient channels. In this Account, we discuss our efforts in designing new unimolecular artificial channels from\n\nDeep tunneling in the unimolecular decay of CH 3CHOO Criegee intermediates to OH radical products\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFang, Yi; Liu, Fang; Barber, Victoria P.\n\nUnimolecular decay of Criegee intermediates produced in alkene ozonolysis is known to be a significant source of OH radicals in the troposphere. In this work, unimolecular decay of the methyl-substituted Criegee intermediate, syn-CH 3CHOO, to OH products is shown to occur at energies significantly below the transition state barrier for a 1,4 hydrogen transfer that leads to these products [Y. Fang et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 061102 (2016)]. The rate of appearance of OH products arising from tunneling through the barrier is obtained through direct time-domain measurements following the vibrational activation of syn-CH 3CHOO. IR excitation of syn-CH 3CHOOmoreÂ Â» at energies nearly 2000 cm -1 below the barrier is achieved through combination bands involving CH stretch and another lower frequency mode, and the resultant OH products are detected by UV laser-induced fluorescence. The observed syn-CH 3CHOO combination bands in the 4100â4350 cm -1 region are identified by comparison with the computed IR absorption spectrum. The experimental decay rates are found to be ca. 106 s -1 in this deep tunneling regime, which is approximately 100-times slower than that in the vicinity of the barrier.The experimental results are consistent with statistical Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) calculations of the microcanonical decay rates with tunneling through the barrier, and notable deviations may originate from the sparsity in the density of states for syn-CH 3CHOO at lower energies. Thermal unimolecular decay of syn-CH 3CHOO is predicted to have significant contribution from microcanonical rates at energies that are much below the barrier.Â«Â less\n\nQuo vadis, unimolecular electronics?\n\nPubMed\n\nMetzger, Robert Melville\n\n2018-06-07\n\nThis paper reviews the present status of unimolecular electronics (UME).

Here, the rate of appearance of OH radical products is examined directly in the time-domain for a prototypical alkyl-substituted Criegee intermediate, CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CHOO, following vibrational activation under collision-free conditions. Complementary statistical RiceâRamspergerâKasselâMarcus calculations of the microcanonical unimolecular decay rate for CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CHOO are also carried out at energies in the vicinity of the barrier for 1,4 hydrogen atom transfer that leads to OH products. Tunneling through the barrier, derived from high level electronicmoreÂ Â» structure calculations, contributes significantly to the decay rate. Infrared transitions of CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CHOO are identified in the CH stretch overtone region, which are detected by ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence of the resultant OH products. The features observed are attributed to CH vibrational excitations and conformational forms utilizing insights from theory. Both experiment and theory yield unimolecular decay rates for CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CHOO of ca. 10{sup 7} s{sup â1}, which are slower than those obtained for syn-CH{sub 3}CHOO or (CH{sub 3}){sub 2}COO reported previously [Fang et al., J.

The decomposition channels for 1,2-difluoroethane are, in order of importance, four-center HF elimination, C-C bond rupture, and hydrogen-atom dissociation. This order is found to be independent of the particular vibrational mode excited. Neither fluorine-atom nor F2 elimination reactions are ever observed even though these dissociation channels are energetically open. For four-center HF elimination, the average fraction of the total energy partitioned into internal HF motion varies between 0.115-0.181 depending upon the particular vibrational mode initially excited. The internal energy of the fluoroethylene product lies in the range 0.716-0.776. Comparison of the present results with those previously obtained for a random distribution of the initial 1,2-difluoroethane internal energy [J. Phys. Chem. 92, 5111 (1988)], shows that numerous mode-specific effects are present in these reactions in spite of the fact that intramolecular energy transfer rates for this system are 5.88-25.5 times faster than any of the unimolecular reaction rates. Mode-specific excitation always leads to a total decomposition rate significantly larger than that obtained for a random distribution of the internal energy. Excitation of different 1,2-difluoroethane vibrational modes is found to produce as much as a 51% change in the total decomposition rate. Mode-specific effects are also seen in the product energy partitioning. The rate coefficients for decomposition into the various channels are very sensitive to the particular mode excited. A comparison of the calculated mode-specific effects with the previously determined mode-to-mode energy transfer rate coefficients [J. Chem. Phys. 89, 5680 (1988)] shows that, to some extent, the presence of mode\n\nTumor-targeted pH/redox dual-sensitive unimolecular nanoparticles for efficient siRNA delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Guojun; Wang, Yuyuan; Xie, Ruosen; Gong, Shaoqin\n\n2017-08-10\n\nA unique pH/redox dual-sensitive cationic unimolecular nanoparticle (NP) enabling excellent endosomal/lysosomal escape and efficient siRNA decomplexation inside the target cells was developed for tumor-targeted delivery of siRNA. siRNA was complexed into the cationic core of the unimolecular NP through electrostatic interactions. The cationic core used for complexing siRNA contained reducible disulfide bonds that underwent intracellular reduction owing to the presence of high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) inside the cells, thereby facilitating the decomplexation of siRNA from the unimolecular NPs. The cationic polymers were conjugated onto the hyperbranched core (H40) via a pH-sensitive bond, which further facilitated the decomplexation of siRNA from the NPs. In vitro studies on the siRNA release behaviors showed that dual stimuli (pH=5.3, 10mM GSH) induced the quickest release of siRNA from the NPs. In addition, the imidazole groups attached to the cationic polymer segments enhanced the endosomal/lysosomal escape of NPs via the proton sponge effect. Intracellular tracking studies revealed that siRNA delivered by unimolecular NPs was efficiently released to the cytosol. Moreover, the GE11 peptide, an anti-EGFR peptide, enhanced the cellular uptake of NPs in MDA-MB-468, an EFGR-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. The GE11-conjugated, GFP-siRNA-complexed NPs exhibited excellent GFP gene silencing efficiency in GFP-MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells without any significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, these studies suggest that this smart unimolecular NP could be a promising nanoplatform for targeted siRNA delivery to EFGR-overexpressing cancer cells. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of unimolecular micelles, microstructures and the distributions of GNPs and DOX were investigated through the combination of experiments and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. Î²-CD-(PLA-PDMAEMA-PEtOxMA) 21 formed spherical unimolecular micelles in aqueous solution within a certain range of polymer concentrations. GNPs preferentially distributed in the PDMAEMA area. The maximum wavelength (Î» max ) and the size of GNPs increased with increasing concentration of HAuCl 4 . DOX preferentially distributed in the PDMAEMA mesosphere, but penetrated the inner PLA core with increasing DOX concentration. DOX-loaded micelles with 41-61% entrapment efficiency showed fast release (88% after 102h) under acidic tumor conditions.

Sun et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137, 044305 (2012)]. In the work reported here, these dynamics are studied in more detail using the same direct dynamics method. Vibrational modes of DO were divided into 4 groups, based on their characteristic motions, and each group excited with the same energy. To compare with the dynamics of these groups, an additional group of trajectories comprising a microcanonical ensemble was also simulated. The results of these simulations are consistent with the previous study. The dissociation probability, N(t)/N(0), for these excitation groups were all different. Groups A, B, and C, without initial excitation in the O-O stretch reaction coordinate, had a time lag to of 0.25-1.0 ps for the first dissociation to occur. Somewhat surprisingly, the C-H stretch Group A and out-of-plane motion Group C excitations had exponential dissociation probabilities after to, with a rate constant Ë2 times smaller than the anharmonic RRKM value. Groups B and D, with excitation of the H-C-H bend and wag, and ring bend and stretch modes, respectively, had bi-exponential dissociation probabilities. For Group D, with excitation localized in the reaction coordinate, the initial rate constant is Ë7 times larger than the anharmonic RRKM value, substantial apparent non-RRKM dynamics.

Additionally, the authors investigate the accuracy of the literature's many different spectra for bare, i.e., unencapsulated (125)I and (103)Pd sources. Spectra generated by 14 (125)I and 6 (103)Pd seeds were calculated in vacuo at 10 cm from the source in a 2.7 Ã 2.7 Ã 0.05 cm(3) voxel using the EGSnrc BrachyDose Monte Carlo code. Calculated spectra used the initial photon spectra recommended by AAPM's TG-43U1 and NCRP (National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements) Report 58 for the (125)I seeds, or TG-43U1 and NNDC(2000) (National Nuclear Data Center, 2000) for (103)Pd seeds. The emitted spectra were treated as coming from a line or dual-point source in a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the dose rate constant. The TG-43U1 definition of the dose rate constant was used. These calculations were performed using the full spectrum including scattered photons or using only the main peaks in the spectrum as done experimentally. Statistical uncertainties on the air kerma/history and the dose rate/history were â¤0.2%. The dose rate constants were also calculated using Monte Carlo simulations of the full seed model. The ratio of the intensity of the 31 keV line relative to that of the main peak in (125)I spectra is, on average, 6.8% higher when calculated with the NCRP Report 58 initial spectrum vs that calculated with TG-43U1 initial spectrum. The (103)Pd spectra exhibit an average 6.2% decrease in the 22.9 keV line relative to the main peak when calculated with the TG-43U1 rather than the NNDC(2000) initial spectrum.

The Flow-IEG system performs three reactions and an in-line purification in a total residence time of under 10 min, effectively doubling the molecular weight of an oligomeric species in an uninterrupted reaction sequence. Further iterations using the Flow-IEG system enable an exponential increase in molecular weight. Incorporating a variety of monomer structures and branching units provides control over polymer sequence and architecture. The synthesis of a uniform macromolecule with a molecular weight of 4,023 g/mol is demonstrated. The user-friendly nature, scalability, and modularity of Flow-IEG provide a general strategy for the automated synthesis of sequence-defined, unimolecular macromolecules.

Here we report a robust and pH-responsive anticancer drug delivery system based on unimolecular micelles of star-like amphiphilic copolymers. The polymers (denoted as CPOFs) were facilely synthesized via one-step atom transfer radical polymerization of functionalizable benzoaldehyde and hydrophilic poly[(oligo ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] as comonomers from the core of heptakis [2,3,6-tri-o-(2-bromo-2-methyl propionyl]-Î²-cyclodextrin as the initiator. Doxorubicin (DOX) as an anticancer drug was covalently linked to the benzoaldehyde groups of CPOFs through pH-sensitive Schiff-base bonds. The DOX-conjugated polymers, denoted as CPOF-DOX, formed robust unimolecular micelles with an average diameter of 18 nm in aqueous media. More importantly, these unimolecular micelles showed higher drug loading capacity and more controllable drug release characteristics, compared to our previous unimolecular micelles of Î²-cyclodextrin-poly(lactic acid)-b-poly[(oligo ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates] that physically encapsulated DOX via hydrophobic interaction. Moreover, the CPOF-DOX unimolecular micelles could be internalized by human cervical cancer HeLa cells in a stepwise way and showed less cytotoxicity compared to carrier-free DOX. We foresee that CPOF-DOX would provide a promising robust and controllable anticancer drug delivery system for future animal study and clinical trials for cancer treatment.\n\nOctreotide-functionalized and resveratrol-loaded unimolecular micelles for targeted neuroendocrine cancer therapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Wenjin; Burke, Jocelyn F.; Pilla, Srikanth; Chen, Herbert; Jaskula-Sztul, Renata; Gong, Shaoqin\n\n2013-09-01\n\nMedullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that is often resistant to standard therapies.

The hyperbranched amphiphilic block copolymer consisted of a dendritic BoltornÂ® H40 core, a hydrophobic poly(l-lactide) (PLA) inner shell, and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) outer shell. Octreotide (OCT), a peptide that shows strong binding affinity to somatostatin receptors, which are overexpressed on NET cells, was used as the targeting ligand. Resveratrol was physically encapsulated by the micelle with a drug loading content of 12.1%. The unimolecular micelles exhibited a uniform size distribution and spherical morphology, which were determined by both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Cellular uptake, cellular proliferation, and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the resveratrol-loaded OCT-targeted micelles suppressed growth more effectively than non-targeted micelles. Moreover, resveratrol-loaded NET-targeted micelles affected MTC cells similarly to free resveratrol in vitro, with equal growth suppression and reduction in NET marker production. These results suggest that the H40-based unimolecular micelle may offer a promising approach for targeted NET therapy.\n\nComparison of TID Effects in Space-Like Variable Dose Rates and Constant Dose Rates\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHarris, Richard D.; McClure, Steven S.; Rax, Bernard G.; Evans, Robin W.; Jun, Insoo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe degradation of the LM193 dual voltage comparator has been studied at different TID dose rate profiles, including several different constant dose rates and a variable dose rate that simulates the behavior of a solar flare. A comparison of results following constant dose rate vs. variable dose rates is made to explore how well the constant dose rates used for typical part testing predict the performance during a simulated space-like mission. Testing at a constant dose rate equal to the lowest dose rate seen during the simulated flare provides an extremely conservative estimate of the overall amount of degradation. A constant dose rate equal to the average dose rate is also more conservative than the variable rate. It appears that, for this part, weighting the dose rates by the amount of total dose received at each rate (rather than the amount of time at each dose rate) results in an average rate that produces an amount of degradation that is a reasonable approximation to that received by the variable rate.\n\nNon-equilibrium reaction rates in chemical kinetic equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGorbachev, Yuriy\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWithin the recently proposed asymptotic method for solving the Boltzmann equation for chemically reacting gas mixture, the chemical kinetic equations has been derived. Corresponding one-temperature non-equilibrium reaction rates are expressed in terms of specific heat capacities of the species participate in the chemical reactions, bracket integrals connected with the internal energy transfer in inelastic non-reactive collisions and energy transfer coefficients. Reactions of dissociation/recombination of homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules are considered. It is shown that all reaction rates are the complex functions of the species densities, similarly to the unimolecular reaction rates. For determining the rate coefficients it is recommended to tabulate corresponding bracket integrals, additionally to the equilibrium rate constants. Correlation of the obtained results with the irreversible thermodynamics is established.\n\nStructuring of Fluid Adlayers upon Ongoing Unimolecular Adsorption\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaefer, C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFluids with spatial density variations of single or mixed molecules play a key role in biophysics, soft matter, and materials science. The fluid structures usually form via spinodal decomposition or nucleation following an instantaneous destabilization of the initially disordered fluid. However, in practice, an instantaneous quench is often not viable, and the rate of destabilization may be gradual rather than instantaneous. In this work we show that the commonly used phenomenological descriptions of fluid structuring are inadequate under these conditions. We come to that conclusion in the context of surface catalysis, where we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to describe the unimolecular adsorption of gaseous molecules onto a metal surface. The adsorbates diffuse at the surface and, as a consequence of lateral interactions and due to an ongoing increase of the surface coverage, phase separate into coexisting low- and high-density regions. The typical size of these regions turns out to depend much more strongly on the rate of adsorption than predicted from recently reported phenomenological models. We discuss how this finding contributes to the fundamental understanding of the crossover from liquid-liquid to liquid-solid demixing of solution-cast polymer blends.\n\nOn determining dose rate constants spectroscopically\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRodriguez, M.; Rogers, D. W. O.\n\n2013-01-15\n\nPurpose: To investigate several aspects of the Chen and Nath spectroscopic method of determining the dose rate constants of {sup 125}I and {sup 103}Pd seeds [Z. Chen and R. Nath, Phys. Med. Biol. 55, 6089-6104 (2010)] including the accuracy of using a line or dual-point source approximation as done in their method, and the accuracy of ignoring the effects of the scattered photons in the spectra. Additionally, the authors investigate the accuracy of the literature's many different spectra for bare, i.e., unencapsulated {sup 125}I and {sup 103}Pd sources. Methods: Spectra generated by 14 {sup 125}I and 6 {sup 103}Pd seedsmoreÂ Â» were calculated in vacuo at 10 cm from the source in a 2.7 Multiplication-Sign 2.7 Multiplication-Sign 0.05 cm{sup 3} voxel using the EGSnrc BrachyDose Monte Carlo code. Calculated spectra used the initial photon spectra recommended by AAPM's TG-43U1 and NCRP (National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements) Report 58 for the {sup 125}I seeds, or TG-43U1 and NNDC(2000) (National Nuclear Data Center, 2000) for {sup 103}Pd seeds. The emitted spectra were treated as coming from a line or dual-point source in a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the dose rate constant. The TG-43U1 definition of the dose rate constant was used. These calculations were performed using the full spectrum including scattered photons or using only the main peaks in the spectrum as done experimentally. Statistical uncertainties on the air kerma/history and the dose rate/history were Less-Than-Or-Slanted-Equal-To 0.2%. The dose rate constants were also calculated using Monte Carlo simulations of the full seed model. Results: The ratio of the intensity of the 31 keV line relative to that of the main peak in {sup 125}I spectra is, on average, 6.8% higher when calculated with the NCRP Report 58 initial spectrum vs that calculated with TG-43U1 initial spectrum. The {sup 103}Pd spectra exhibit an average 6.2% decrease in the 22.9 keV line relative to the main peak\n\nTheoretical Kinetic Study of the Unimolecular Keto-Enol Tautomerism Propen-2-ol â Acetone. Pressure Effects and Implications in the Pyrolysis of tert- and 2-Butanol.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrajales-GonzÃ¡lez, E; Monge-Palacios, M; Sarathy, S Mani\n\n2018-04-12\n\nThe need for renewable and cleaner sources of energy has made biofuels an interesting alternative to fossil fuels, especially in the case of butanol isomers, with its favorable blend properties and low hygroscopicity. Although C 4 alcohols are prospective fuels, some key reactions governing their pyrolysis and combustion have not been adequately studied, leading to incomplete kinetic models. Enols are important intermediates in the combustion of C 4 alcohols, as well as in atmospheric processes. Butanol reactions kinetics is poorly understood. Specifically, the unimolecular tautomerism of propen-2-ol â acetone, which is included in butanol combustion kinetic models, is assigned rate parameters based on the tautomerism vinyl alcohol â acetaldehyde as an analogy. In an attempt to update current kinetic models for tert- and 2-butanol, a theoretical kinetic study of the titled reaction was carried out by means of CCSD(T,FULL)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD(T)/6-31+G(d,p) ab initio calculations, with multistructural torsional anharmonicity and variational transition state theory considerations in a wide temperature and pressure range (200-3000 K; 0.1-10 8 kPa). Results differ from vinyl alcohol â acetaldehyde analogue reaction, which shows lower rate constant values. It was observed that decreasing pressure leads to a decrease in rate constants, describing the expected falloff behavior. Tunneling turned out to be important, especially at low temperatures. Accordingly, pyrolysis simulations in a batch reactor for tert- and 2-butanol with computed rate constants showed important differences in comparison with previous results, such as larger acetone yield and quicker propen-2-ol consumption.\n\nAmphiphilic multiarm star block copolymer-based multifunctional unimolecular micelles for cancer targeted drug delivery and MR imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xiaojie; Qian, Yinfeng; Liu, Tao; Hu, Xianglong; Zhang, Guoying; You, Yezi; Liu, Shiyong\n\n2011-09-01\n\nWe report on the fabrication of multifunctional polymeric unimolecular micelles as an integrated platform for cancer targeted drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Starting from a fractionated fourth-generation hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H40), the ring-opening polymerization of É-caprolactone (CL) from the periphery of H40 and subsequent terminal group esterification with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide afforded star copolymer-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) macroinitiator, H40-PCL-Br. Well-defined multiarm star block copolymers, H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-co-AzPMA), were then synthesized by the ATRP of oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) and 3-azidopropyl methacrylate (AzPMA). This was followed by the click reaction of H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-co-AzPMA) with alkynyl-functionalized cancer cell-targeting moieties, alkynyl-folate, and T(1)-type MRI contrast agents, alkynyl-DOTA-Gd (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakisacetic acid), affording H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-Gd-FA). In aqueous solution, the amphiphilic multiarm star block copolymer exists as structurally stable unimolecular micelles possessing a hyperbranched polyester core, a hydrophobic PCL inner layer, and a hydrophilic P(OEGMA-Gd-FA) outer corona. H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-Gd-FA) unimolecular micelles are capable of encapsulating paclitaxel, a well-known hydrophobic anticancer drug, with a loading content of 6.67 w/w% and exhibiting controlled release of up to 80% loaded drug over a time period of â¼120 h. In vitro MRI experiments demonstrated considerably enhanced T(1) relaxivity (18.14 s(-1) mM(-1)) for unimolecular micelles compared to 3.12 s(-1) mM(-1) for that of the small molecule counterpart, alkynyl-DOTA-Gd. Further experiments of in vivo MR imaging in rats revealed good accumulation of unimolecular micelles within rat liver and kidney, prominent positive contrast enhancement, and relatively\n\nMixed quantum-classical studies of energy partitioning in unimolecular chemical reactions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBladow, Landon Lowell\n\nA mixed quantum-classical reaction path Hamiltonian method is utilized to study the dynamics of unimolecular reactions. The method treats motion along the reaction path classically and treats the transverse vibrations quantum mechanically. The theory leads to equations that predict the disposai of the exit-channel potential energy to product translation and vibration. In addition, vibrational state distributions are obtained for the product normal modes. Vibrational excitation results from the curvature of the minimum energy reaction path. The method is applied to six unimolecular reactions: HF elimination from fluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethene, and trifluoromethane; and HCl elimination from chloroethane and acetyl chloride. The minimum energy paths were calculated at either the MP2 or B3LYP level of theory. In all cases, the majority of the vibrational excitation of the products occurs in the HX fragment. The results are compared to experimental data and other theoretical results, where available. The best agreement between the experimental and calculated HX vibrational distributions is found for the halogenated ethanes, and the experimental deduction that the majority of the HX vibrational excitation arises from the potential energy release is supported. It is believed that the excess energy provided in experiments contributes to the poorer agreement between experiment and theory observed for HF elimination from 1,1-difluoroethene and trifluoromethane. An attempt is described to incorporate a treatment of the excess energy into the present method. However, the sign of the curvature coupling elements is then found to affect the dynamics. Overall, the method appears to be an efficient dynamical tool for modeling the disposal of the exit-channel potential energy in unimolecular reactions.\n\nThe Rate Constant for Fluorescence Quenching\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLegenza, Michael W.; Marzzacco, Charles J.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nDescribes an experiment that utilizes fluorescence intensity measurements from a Spectronic 20 to determine the rate constant for the fluorescence quenching of various aromatic hydrocarbons by carbon tetrachloride in an ethanol solvent.

Hydrolysis represents a major environmental degradation pathway; unfortunately, only a small fraction of hydrolysis rates for about 85,000 chemicals on the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) inventory are in public domain, making it critical to develop in silico approaches to estimate hydrolysis rate constants. In this presentation, we compare three complementary approaches to estimate hydrolysis rates for carbamates, an important chemical class widely used in agriculture as pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. Fragment-based Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) using Hammett-Taft sigma constants are widely published and implemented for relatively simple functional groups such as carboxylic acid esters, phthalate esters, and organophosphate esters, and we extend these to carbamates. We also develop a pKa based model and a quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) model, and evaluate them against measured rate constants using R square and root mean square (RMS) error. Our work shows that for our relatively small sample size of carbamates, a Hammett-Taft based fragment model performs best, followed by a pKa and a QSPR model. This presentation compares three comp\n\nInstanton rate constant calculations close to and above the crossover temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcConnell, Sean; KÃ¤stner, Johannes\n\n2017-11-15\n\nCanonical instanton theory is known to overestimate the rate constant close to a system-dependent crossover temperature and is inapplicable above that temperature. We compare the accuracy of the reaction rate constants calculated using recent semi-classical rate expressions to those from canonical instanton theory. We show that rate constants calculated purely from solving the stability matrix for the action in degrees of freedom orthogonal to the instanton path is not applicable at arbitrarily low temperatures and use two methods to overcome this. Furthermore, as a by-product of the developed methods, we derive a simple correction to canonical instanton theory that can alleviate this known overestimation of rate constants close to the crossover temperature. The combined methods accurately reproduce the rate constants of the canonical theory along the whole temperature range without the spurious overestimation near the crossover temperature. We calculate and compare rate constants on three different reactions: H in the MÃ¼ller-Brown potential, methylhydroxycarbene â acetaldehyde and H 2 â+âOH â Hâ+âH 2 O.

The potential energy surface was used to simulate the experimentally measured transition-state spectrum by calculating the photodetachment spectrum of the COT anion with time-dependent wave packet formalism. The calculated spectrum reproduces the experimental result well. We also analyzed wavefunction properties at spectral peak positions to understand the COT unimolecular reaction dynamics.\n\nRate constant for reaction of atomic hydrogen with germane\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNava, David F.; Payne, Walter A.; Marston, George; Stief, Louis J.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nDue to the interest in the chemistry of germane in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, and because previously reported kinetic reaction rate studies at 298 K gave results differing by a factor of 200, laboratory measurements were performed to determine the reaction rate constant for H + GeH4. Results of the study at 298 K, obtained via the direct technique of flash photolysis-resonance fluorescence, yield the reaction rate constant, k = (4.08 + or - 0.22) x 10(exp -12) cu cm/s.\n\nQuantum transition state dynamics of the cyclooctatetraene unimolecular reaction on ab initio potential energy surfaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTokizaki, Chihiro; Yoshida, Takahiko; Takayanagi, Toshiyuki\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe cyclooctatetraene (COT) anion has a stable D4h structure that is similar to the transition state configurations of the neutral C-C bond-alternation (D4h â D8h â D4h) and ring-inversion (D2d â D4h â D2d) unimolecular reactions. The previously measured photodetachment spectrum of COT- revealed the reaction dynamics in the vicinity of the two transition states on the neutral potential energy surface. In this work, the photodetachment spectrum is calculated quantum mechanically on ab initio-level potential energy surfaces within a three degree-of-freedom reduced-dimensionality model. Very good agreement has been obtained between theory and experiment, providing reliable interpretations for the experimental spectrum. A detailed picture of the reactive molecular dynamics of the COT unimolecular reaction in the transition state region is also discussed.\n\nThe vibrational dependence of dissociative recombination: Rate constants for N{sub 2}{sup +}\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGuberman, Steven L., E-mail: slg@sci.org\n\nDissociative recombination rate constants are reported with electron temperature dependent uncertainties for the lowest 5 vibrational levels of the N{sub 2}{sup +} ground state. The rate constants are determined from ab initio calculations of potential curves, electronic widths, quantum defects, and cross sections. At 100 K electron temperature, the rate constants overlap with the exception of the third vibrational level. At and above 300 K, the rate constants for excited vibrational levels are significantly smaller than that for the ground level. It is shown that any experimentally determined total rate constant at 300 K electron temperature that is smaller thanmoreÂ Â» 2.0 Ã 10{sup â7} cm{sup 3}/s is likely to be for ions that have a substantially excited vibrational population. Using the vibrational level specific rate constants, the total rate constant is in very good agreement with that for an excited vibrational distribution found in a storage ring experiment. It is also shown that a prior analysis of a laser induced fluorescence experiment is quantitatively flawed due to the need to account for reactions with unknown rate constants. Two prior calculations of the dissociative recombination rate constant are shown to be inconsistent with the cross sections upon which they are based. The rate constants calculated here contribute to the resolution of a 30 year old disagreement between modeled and observed N{sub 2}{sup +} ionospheric densities.Â«Â less\n\nAnharmonic Effect in CH3CH2C(=O)OCH2CH3 Decomposition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDing, Yang; Song, Liguo; Yao, Li; Xia, Wenwen\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this paper, using the B3LYP functional and CCSD(T) method with 6-311++G** basis set, the harmonic and anharmonic rate constants in the unimolecular dissociation of ethyl propanoate have been calculated using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The anharmonic rate constants of the title reaction have also been examined, the comparison shows that, the anharmonic effect especially in the case of high total energies and temperature for channels 3 to 6 is significant, so that the anharmonic effect cannot be neglected for unimolecular dissociation reaction of CH3CH2C(=O)OCH2CH3 both in microcanonical and canonical systems.\n\nPrecisely and Accurately Inferring Single-Molecule Rate Constants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKinz-Thompson, Colin D.; Bailey, Nevette A.; Gonzalez, Ruben L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe kinetics of biomolecular systems can be quantified by calculating the stochastic rate constants that govern the biomolecular state versus time trajectories (i.e., state trajectories) of individual biomolecules. To do so, the experimental signal versus time trajectories (i.e., signal trajectories) obtained from observing individual biomolecules are often idealized to generate state trajectories by methods such as thresholding or hidden Markov modeling. Here, we discuss approaches for idealizing signal trajectories and calculating stochastic rate constants from the resulting state trajectories. Importantly, we provide an analysis of how the finite length of signal trajectories restrict the precision of these approaches, and demonstrate how Bayesian inference-based versions of these approaches allow rigorous determination of this precision. Similarly, we provide an analysis of how the finite lengths and limited time resolutions of signal trajectories restrict the accuracy of these approaches, and describe methods that, by accounting for the effects of the finite length and limited time resolution of signal trajectories, substantially improve this accuracy. Collectively, therefore, the methods we consider here enable a rigorous assessment of the precision, and a significant enhancement of the accuracy, with which stochastic rate constants can be calculated from single-molecule signal trajectories.

Besides surgery, there are no curative treatments for NE cancers and their metastases, emphasizing the need for the development of other forms of therapy. In this study, multifunctional unimolecular micelles were developed for targeted NE cancer therapy. The unimolecular micelles were formed by multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer poly(amidoamine)-poly(valerolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with KE108 peptide and Cy5 dye (abbreviated as PAMAM-PVL-PEG-KE108/Cy5). The unimolecular micelles with a spherical core-shell structure exhibited a uniform size distribution and excellent stability. The hydrophobic drug thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a recently discovered HDAC inhibitor, was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the micelles. KE108 peptide, a somatostatin analog possessing high affinity for all five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR 1-5), commonly overexpressed in NE cancer cells, was used for the first time as an NE cancer targeting ligand. KE108 exhibited superior targeting abilities compared to other common somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, in NE cancer cell lines. The inÂ vitro assays demonstrated that the TDP-A-loaded, KE108-targeted micelles exhibited the best capabilities in suppressing NE cancer cell growth. Moreover, the inÂ vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging on NE-tumor-bearing nude mice showed that KE108-conjugated micelles exhibited the greatest tumor accumulation due to their passive targeting and active targeting capabilities. Finally, TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated micelles possessed the best anticancer efficacy without detectable systemic toxicity. Thus, these novel TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles offer a promising approach for targeted NE cancer therapy. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A.; Nemeth, N. N.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nHigh-temperature slow-crack-growth behaviour of hot-pressed silicon carbide was determined using both constant-stress-rate (\"dynamic fatigue\") and constant-stress (\"static fatigue\") testing in flexure at 1300 C in air. Slow crack growth was found to be a governing mechanism associated with failure of the material. Four estimation methods such as the individual data, the Weibull median, the arithmetic mean and the median deviation methods were used to determine the slow crack growth parameters. The four estimation methods were in good agreement for the constant-stress-rate testing with a small variation in the slow-crack-growth parameter, n, ranging from 28 to 36. By contrast, the variation in n between the four estimation methods was significant in the constant-stress testing with a somewhat wide range of n= 16 to 32.\n\nTunneling and reflection in unimolecular reaction kinetic energy release distributions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHansen, K.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe kinetic energy release distributions in unimolecular reactions is calculated with detailed balance theory, taking into account the tunneling and the reflection coefficient in three different types of transition states; (i) a saddle point corresponding to a standard RRKM-type theory, (ii) an attachment Langevin cross section, and (iii) an absorbing sphere potential at short range, without long range interactions. Corrections are significant in the one dimensional saddle point states.

Within the framework of the discrete model of random walks, definitions are given of the probability and rate constant of a reaction A + B â P (products) proceeding in a condensed medium. A method is suggested for calculating the rate constant of a quantum-diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction. By this method, an expression is obtained for the rate constant in the stationary spherically symmetrical case. An equation for the density matrix is also proposed which describes the motion and chemical interaction of a pair of species when the quantum and classical diffusion are competitive.\n\nInfluences of brain tissue poroelastic constants on intracranial pressure (ICP) during constant-rate infusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xiaogai; von Holst, Hans; Kleiven, Svein\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA 3D finite element (FE) model has been developed to study the mean intracranial pressure (ICP) response during constant-rate infusion using linear poroelasticity. Due to the uncertainties in the poroelastic constants for brain tissue, the influence of each of the main parameters on the transient ICP infusion curve was studied. As a prerequisite for transient analysis, steady-state simulations were performed first. The simulated steady-state pressure distribution in the brain tissue for a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation system showed good correlation with experiments from the literature. Furthermore, steady-state ICP closely followed the infusion experiments at different infusion rates. The verified steady-state models then served as a baseline for the subsequent transient models. For transient analysis, the simulated ICP shows a similar tendency to that found in the experiments, however, different values of the poroelastic constants have a significant effect on the infusion curve. The influence of the main poroelastic parameters including the Biot coefficient Î±, Skempton coefficient B, drained Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio Î½, permeability Îº, CSF absorption conductance C(b) and external venous pressure p(b) was studied to investigate the influence on the pressure response. It was found that the value of the specific storage term S(Îµ) is the dominant factor that influences the infusion curve, and the drained Young's modulus E was identified as the dominant parameter second to S(Îµ). Based on the simulated infusion curves from the FE model, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to find an optimised parameter set that best fit the experimental curve. The infusion curves from both the FE simulation and using ANN confirmed the limitation of linear poroelasticity in modelling the transient constant-rate infusion.\n\n18 CFR 806.12 - Constant-rate aquifer testing.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-04-01\n\n... withdraw or increase a withdrawal of groundwater shall perform a constant-rate aquifer test in accordance... groundwater availability analysis to determine the availability of water during a 1-in-10-year recurrence...\n\n18 CFR 806.12 - Constant-rate aquifer testing.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-04-01\n\n... withdraw or increase a withdrawal of groundwater shall perform a constant-rate aquifer test in accordance... groundwater availability analysis to determine the availability of water during a 1-in-10-year recurrence...\n\n18 CFR 806.12 - Constant-rate aquifer testing.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... withdraw or increase a withdrawal of groundwater shall perform a constant-rate aquifer test in accordance... groundwater availability analysis to determine the availability of water during a 1-in-10-year recurrence...\n\n18 CFR 806.12 - Constant-rate aquifer testing.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-04-01\n\n... withdraw or increase a withdrawal of groundwater shall perform a constant-rate aquifer test in accordance... groundwater availability analysis to determine the availability of water during a 1-in-10-year recurrence...\n\nRate constant for the reaction of atomic chlorine with methane\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLin, C.

The objectives were to determine an accurate value for the rate constant for use in stratospheric modeling, and to clarify discrepancies in results previously obtained by different techniques. The results deduced from the competitive chlorination study are in good agreement with the absolute values measured by the mass spectrometric method, and at temperatures above 300 K are in good agreement with measurements by other techniques based on resonance fluorescence detection of atomic chlorine. However, in the 220-300 K region, the competitive experiments indicate lower rate constants than those obtained by resonance fluorescence methods, and do not reproduce the curved Arrhenius plots seen in some of those studies.\n\nBiodegradation testing of chemicals with high Henry's constants - Separating mass and effective concentration reveals higher rate constants.\n\nPubMed\n\nBirch, Heidi; Andersen, Henrik R; Comber, Mike; Mayer, Philipp\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDuring simulation-type biodegradation tests, volatile chemicals will continuously partition between water phase and headspace.

After incubation for 2Â h to 4 weeks, automated Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) was applied directly on the test systems to measure substrate depletion by biodegradation relatively to abiotic controls. HS-SPME was also applied to determine air to water partitioning ratios. Biodegradation rate constants relating to the chemical in the water phase, k water , were generally a factor 1 to 11 times higher than biodegradation rate constants relating to the total mass of chemical in the test system, k system , with one exceptional factor of 72 times for a long chain alkane. True water phase degradation rate constants were found (i) more appropriate for risk assessment than test system rate constants, (ii) to facilitate extrapolation to other air-water systems and (iii) to be better defined input parameters for aquatic exposure and fate models.

The case of CH4 + OH studied through isotope-substituted analogs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLamberts, T.; Fedoseev, G.; KÃ¤stner, J.; Ioppolo, S.; Linnartz, H.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe present a combined experimental and theoretical study focussing on the quantum tunneling of atoms in the reaction between CH4 and OH. The importance of this reaction pathway is derived by investigating isotope substituted analogs. Quantitative reaction rates needed for astrochemical models at low temperature are currently unavailable both in the solid state and in the gas phase. Here, we study tunneling effects upon hydrogen abstraction in CH4 + OH by focusing on two reactions: CH4 + OD â CH3 + HDO and CD4 + OH â CD3 + HDO. The experimental study shows that the solid-state reaction rate RCH4 + OD is higher than RCD4 + OH at 15 K. Experimental results are accompanied by calculations of the corresponding unimolecular and bimolecular reaction rate constants using instanton theory taking into account surface effects. For the work presented here, the unimolecular reactions are particularly interesting as these provide insight into reactions following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood process. The resulting ratio of the rate constants shows that the H abstraction (kCH4 + OD) is approximately ten times faster than D-abstraction (kCD4 + OH) at 65 K. We conclude that tunnelin"
