Bruce’s sharp wit and broadcasting experience make this book a ‘must have’ for anyone who gives a damn about Canadian English.” Russ Germaine, “The World at Six,” CBC Radio National News “This book is professional, comprehensive, fun, and tremendously helpful for anyone with a fear of presenting themselves in public. Designed for the media professional, You Can Say That Again is just as helpful for any business executive who has to make speeches, reports, presentations, or simply approach the boss for a raise…. Surveys show business executives fear presentations and speeches with a passion. Bruce replaces the fear with a good dose of confidence.” Barrie Doyle, President, Gateway Communications, Instructor, Humber College “You Can Say That Again is the new guide for my students, for the profession, for those with an interest in the world’s languages, and (with the trivia quiz in each chapter) for those who love word games.” Jon Keeble, Chairman, Radio and Television Arts, Ryerson Polytechnical University “I prefer to associate with those who believe pronouncing words correctly is not only satisfying … but fun!

While the presentation was very informal, it had to adhere to the strict broadcast standards drilled into us during our early CBC years. The language had to be clear and precise and totally free of solecisms. There was, of course, no tolerance for wrong information and we were expected to pay attention to the protocol of an earlier broadcasting age. We were regarded as invited guests in listeners’ homes and had to behave accordingly. Our little project was judged a success, and while we had great fun doing it, we learned something important. Both of us came away from the exercise with the clear understanding that you could pay attention to language and good presentation and still be an effective communicator. Bruce went on to become a highly succesful host and broadcast journalist in both public and private sectors. When we met over the years we often deplored the slippage in the standards we continued to honour. We understood that the climate had changed and presentations had to be more relaxed but felt there was no excuse for some of the sloppiness and lack of respect for language that has become all too prevalent on our nation’s airwaves. Too often, a glaring mispronunciation or an outrageous mistake in grammar can mar a great effort. With this book Bruce steps foward to fill a need. It’s an entertaining approach that is also a serious attempt to arrest the drift away from any kind of moderately acceptable standard for the spoken word. This book is not pedantic and doesn’t preach a cure. You Can Say That Again is timely\n\nand amusing and useful for anyone ... broadcaster or after-dinner speaker ... who wants to make a good impression. Lloyd Robertson CTV News ★★★ After three and a half decades as a broadcast journalist — perhaps a third of that time at an anchor desk of one sort or another — I’m all too familiar with the mortifying agony of mispronunciation as well as the exhilarating, self-satisfied high triggered by the successful negotiation of a word minefield. I still occasionally find myself fighting the wave of panic that can be generated by unexpected confrontation with a potentially disastrous assembly of vowels, consonants, and syllables. It’s easy to laugh today about the simply sloppy pronunciations. As a matter of fact, in my early, highly unprofessional days in private radio, I have to admit I occasionally laughed at myself, while still on the air. The example I remember best: “... the huge crowd that ‘messed’ in a Buenos Aires square”! In ten years working for the American television network NBC I agonized over the pronunciation of been (they say BIN), semi (they split between SEM-ee and SEM-eye), not to mention our notorious out and about. But you have to be a broadcaster to squirm after being tripped up by the pronunciation of a local or foreign landmark. Balliol Avenue (in Toronto) got me when I first arrived in Toronto from Calgary (Torontonians say BELL-OIL as opposed to the British BELL-ee-ALL). And I still blush at the memory of the time I asked a London cabbie to take me to Beauchamp Place. Anyone familiar with the Knightsbridge district just knows the British pronounce the street name as though it were spelled Beecham!! When it comes to correct pronunciation, I fall somewhere between the painfully — sometimes pompously — fastidious and those who associate proper usage with snobs and poseurs. In the end, I think I prefer to associate with those who believe that pronouncing words correctly is not only satisfying — but fun. So, I believe, does Bruce Rogers, an individual who has long set the standard for Canadians who enjoy using the English language properly for work and pleasure. Peter Kent Global Television News\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nA labour of love like this book is a time-consuming preoccupation. My wife, Diana, was understanding and tolerant of the concentration it took to research and write it. Others were encouraging too, including wordmeister, broadcaster, and writer Jeremy Brown. Some colleagues took a real interest and encouraged me to press on: “Remind readers there’s no such word as irregardless.” “Tell them it’s pronounced Or-jee!” “How about a note on kilometre?” My most influential mentor was always consulting the dictionary, interested in Latin roots. My father’s interest in words, language, and good speech was contagious. Harry “H. H.” Rogers worked at building his vocabulary through his entire eighty-seven years and his love of words rubbed off on me. More important than that, he read me Uncle Wiggly, Pinocchio, and Black Beauty when I was small. Another prime and wordy influence was the late E. U. “Ted” Schrader, newspaperman and chairman of the Journalism School at Ryerson in the early sixties. While serious about correct and simple English, he encouraged fun with words. Also on the Ryerson faculty then, and determined to instill a love of language and good speech, was Jim Peters. His invaluable phonetic guide is listed in the bibliography. At CBC, the guardian of language, the late W. H. Brodie, emphasized clarity and understanding. He insisted on correct pronunciation but simple and natural expression. No pedantry allowed. Other important influences during my years at CBC included Angus McLellan and Bert Cowan of National Radio News. Conscientious colleagues at CFRB News influenced me too, in the late fifties and again in the nineties. Other influential colleagues who set a high standard included Harry Mannis, Lamont Tilden, Ken Haslam, Frank Herbert, John Envers, John\n\nO’Leary, Harry Brown, Bill Paul, Bruce Marsh, Jim Chorley, John Rae, Alan McFee, Lloyd Robertson, and Bernard “Bunny” Cowan. Unfortunately I can’t list all of the professional and influential confreres who worked in that collegial environment during what we all agree were “the best days” at old “Mother Corp.” At TVO, punster, linguist, and my “old china plate” Dr. Rob Buckman has encouraged me with his tips on Cockney slang and his wild sense of humour. He knows his words and has shared his delight with me. Others helpful in getting this tome into print were Tony Hawke and Liedewy Hawke of Dundurn Press. Thanks to all of the above. Whether it was a word to check, their influence over the years, or other contributions — I’m grateful. But any errors of fact or opinion are entirely mine.\n\nStart your day by brushing your teeth and sharpening your tongue! — Oscar Levant\n\nIntroduction Words Are Power\n\nMend your speech a little lest it may mar your fortune. — Shakespeare You say “tomato” (tuh-MAY-toe). I say “tum-AH-toe.” Ditto for potato. So, as the song proposes, should we “call the whole thing off ”? Hardly. Some pronunciation differences just make things interesting. Pronunciation errors, however, can also erode our credibility. Or, to put it positively, credible speech is power. Correct pronunciation confers authority and builds confidence. If we make our point clearly and naturally, our verbal assurance grows. Feel free to sound out the words and move your lips as you read this book. You may chuckle or crack a smile as you play with words and check how to say them. At the very least, you’ll have some word trivia fun. One use for this book is as a handy, preliminary reference; something to check before going to the dictionary or specialized pronunciation guides. It also tries to settle an argument within myself. On the one hand I’m often disappointed, sometimes annoyed, when I hear broadcasters kick the language around with poor speech, poor grammar, and incorrect pronunciation. On the other hand, I almost always side with those who argue for flexibility while reminding us that English is constantly changing. Meanings change. Pronunciation evolves. The argument simmers through this book, ending in an uneasy truce, the dispute unresolved. The book tries to foster greater affection for language and its proper use. And it may lead to greater vocal comfort and help avoid embarrassment. For instance, it helps to know that a cohort is not an associate but a group of Roman soldiers. It helps to know engine is pronounced “EN-jin,” not “IN-jun.” It may even be handy to know when to use the word ferkin and how it differs from merkin. These are not the names of a vaudeville act like Frick and Frack. Check Chapter 5 for their meanings. Journalists who entertain and inform should be rated on those two criteria. They should not be harshly judged for occasional lapses in the use of who versus whom or for occasional split infinitives or dangling participles. But frequent abuse of the language is another matter,\n\nYou Can Say That Again! especially if it’s in the broadcast media. And the offence is even greater if it’s heard on CBC. There are those who appear to pride themselves on making up their own rules like Humpty Dumpty in Alice in Wonderland. Their carelessness or ignorance can be amusing, as was this headline written by some inattentive editor: NEW STUDY OF OBESITY LOOKS FOR LARGER TEST GROUP But often we lose all respect for the person who has displayed either ignorance or a cavalier attitude. Standards Matter Standards of speech and grammar have plummeted in recent years. Television, advertising, radio, and films are major contributors to the decline. It’s not just a matter of the constant, healthy evolution of language. And it isn’t simply an infusion of non-standard varieties of English in a multicultural society. Educators may be partly responsible for the deterioration. But they struggle against a tide of linguistic barbarism. The environment in which they teach is fouled by the communications priorities of commerce and by the popular trivialization of media content. Post-secondary educators complain that many of their students, both undergraduate and graduate, are unable to write grammatical sentences or a well-reasoned argument. In the groves of academe few students pick the fruit from the highest branches. Most are content to take a shortcut through the orchard on the way to an entry-level job. And colleges as well as universities seem to be ready to assist those students who wish to avoid scholarship. Curriculum 101 provides a bare introduction to history, English literature, political science, or whatever. Students are able to choose one subject from column A and one from column B — a Chinese-menu course of studies. As a result, when they graduate, many of them are ill-equipped. Their language skills are inferior. It is true that language is not static. The way we express ourselves is influenced by technology, the economy, immigration, politics, fashion, demographics, and many other factors. ‘Twas ever thus. And with each stage of language development there has been resistance to change and heavy criticism of new modes of expression. After consistent spelling became widespread, deviation was seen as the start of a slide down a slippery slope. Spelling and pronunciation changes were even seen as issues of morality. At the very least, language nonconformists were seen\n\n18\n\nIntroduction as less than respectable. Schoolchildren who used non-standard English were stereotyped and marked for academic failure. If they spoke Caribbean, Asian, or African English they were stigmatized. Fortunately there is wider recognition today that one’s language variety, accent, dialect, and even vocabulary are closely linked to one’s identity and selfrespect. This is not a plea for acceptance of Ebonics or street slang. It is still an advantage to use the language that prevails in higher education and in international communication even while we are more tolerant of other varieties of English. To return to the core problem, we enjoy huge leaps in communications technology but our ability to connect with one another declines. The language of the popular media is a vernacular of limited scope. It has potent emotional range but is intellectually stunted. Privileged people find the information they need whatever the source, from narrow-interest technical journals to Web sites. But the mass audience is served predigested, oversimplified pap in language designed to eliminate thought. It’s a new illiteracy. And it undermines the assumption that a democratic society should be based on a widely shared understanding of what’s going on. Advertisers target children and adolescents of limited language development. Not a problem perhaps, even when they use low-brow language. Except, the special language becomes the norm. For example, children don’t learn the useful distinction between an adverb and an adjective. So we hear expressions like, “Drive safe!” and, “Lose weight quick!” No big deal? Maybe it’s just language in evolution again. But the problem is greater than this minor example of usage change. Peer pressure confirms incorrect but popular usage. We know that young children only gradually come to understand and use the tools of grammar. Matters of agreement, or of plural and singular, come into use only as a result of maturation and education. Until then, the words she and her may be interchangeable. “He coming,” is likely. So are double, even triple negatives. The same goes for vocabulary development and pronunciation. Television and radio cater to that level of language development in order to keep their audience and so that advertisers will buy time. This turns into a general problem when the young audience becomes the prime target and when those standards begin to dominate the popular media, including news and public affairs. But when the targets of filmmakers and the tabloids also possess limited language skills, these poor habits of speech become the common denominator and the standard. Then it’s an uphill struggle for teachers, parents, conscientious broadcasters, and writers. In fact, those who encourage more sophisticated language use are sometimes called elitist and undemocratic.\n\n19\n\nYou Can Say That Again! Thank heavens for some of the newspapers. The middle-class broadsheets still have editors and still acknowledge their responsibility to contribute to literate discourse. While more of their content is gossip these days, they still try to avoid oversimplification. They demand of their reporters, columnists, and news writers some degree of literacy. They serve a readership that enjoys a rich range of expression and expects conformity to established standards of usage. The tabloids, on the other hand, are designed for the marginally literate, those who like lots of pictures, simple words, and big print; those whose lips move when they read. The tabloids keep it simple. They don’t confuse the reader with the complexity of facts and the ambiguity of the human condition. They keep the issues black or white, right or wrong, win or lose. That doesn’t require much of a vocabulary or any subtlety of expression. And that approach applies to most television, popular radio, and most advertising. So this book is partly a reaction to a contemporary dumbing-down and carelessness that threatens the quality of public discourse. It is for the individual who wants to communicate well without drawing attention to his or her manner of speech. The decline of recent years undermines our ability to communicate effectively or with subtlety about the complexities and nuances of social issues. We share less and less. And many individuals, accomplished in other ways, find their lives and careers circumscribed by the limitations of their language. Take pronunciation for example. Broadcasters who should know better say schism as SKIZ-um instead of the correct SIZ-um. (Now there’s dispute about this. SIZ-um is no longer preferred in some quarters. See Chapter 5, Words.) Others say kil-AWM-it-ir instead of KIL-o-meet-ir. Flaccid is correctly FLAK-sid, not FLAS-id. Accede is AK-seed, not a-SEED! Mistakes as common as these are heard all too often from TV anchors, radio hosts, and after-dinner speakers. Some years ago a CBC TV news anchor called the Jewish holiday chan-OOka (Chanukah). More recently a 680 News anchor referred to the Irish Republican Army’s political wing Sinn Fein (SHIN FAIN) as SIN FINE (to rhyme with shine instead of rain). This book encourages a slightly higher standard, but chances are we’ll win some and lose some. This is not just another case of one generation resisting the vocal expression of a younger one. Nor is it geezerhood versus the nonconformity of youth. But it is a somewhat curmudgeonly attempt to maintain the richness and elegance of our communication efforts. This book is written out of respect for the greatest of human achievements — our language. If it helps some individuals to a higher standard of usage in the media and on the public platform, so much the better. If those who read it also enjoy themselves, that’s a great reward. At least, it may foment some healthy, language-focused debate.\n\n20\n\nIntroduction Word Power Knowing more words makes us smarter. A broad vocabulary combined with an understanding of the rules of good usage helps us read more quickly, understand more readily, and retain more of what we read. And better use of words impresses others and confers power. That puts us in a position to take advantage of opportunities. With words, as in so many other ways, nothing succeeds like success. While the rewards of self improvement, greater social confidence, and a career boost are laudable goals, the book’s primary purpose is to be an everyday aid to better English usage. There is, however, no language expert to serve as arbiter in all disputes about usage, spelling, grammar, and pronunciation. And this book won’t fill that void. A love of words probably begins in infancy. Parents who love words instill that love in their children. Those children enjoy a significant advantage. Children who are read bedtime stories soon develop an interest in reading for themselves. They start school with a bigger vocabulary and an advanced ability to learn. Some teachers have a knack for encouraging children. A love of words and language is soon conveyed to students. The communication tool kit of the early school years becomes the foundation for scholarship and personal growth. Affectation and pedantry aren’t necessary. In fact, they can kill curiosity. All that’s necessary is a shared love of words. There is little patience in these pages for “reactionary nostalgia” as the Guide to Canadian English Usage by Margery Fee and Janice McAlpine (1997) puts it. Some people like to confront each departure from the “rules.” This book will disappoint those hobbyists. The use of language as a moral yardstick goes back to the eighteenth century, when English was being standardized in dictionaries. There were references then to the “vulgar” language of the “common people.” But language isn’t a simple matter of right and wrong. It is simply that you are more likely to be persuasive when you follow convention than when you flout it. “Like, uh, yuh know, me and him ain’t got no tickets, eh? So, uh, like, we can’t go wid youse,” may be commonly heard but it doesn’t leave a good impression or connect effectively. You are more likely to be found credible and more likely to be understood if you stick with standard educated usage in spelling, grammar, and pronunciation. Keeping up with constant change is difficult. What’s acceptable today may be unacceptable tomorrow. Sometimes there is a Canadian pronunciation. In these pages that is usually preferred. Emphasis on the prefix in repeat is American, ruh-PEET is Canadian. But in Canada, depending on location and occasion, you may have a choice among the favoured Canadian, American, and British pronunciations. Lots of\n\n21\n\nYou Can Say That Again! Canadians say coyote “KY-yoot,” but many have seen a lot of film and TV westerns, so they say “ky-OH-tee.” The NHL team gets the American pronunciation (ky-OH-tee) from most sportscasters. Is it another word undergoing Americanization? Good Speech: Cultivated Formal Standard English is a convenient abstraction like the average man. — G. L. Brook The section on English phonetic values assumes North American, largely Canadian, sometimes called “mid-Atlantic” values, clearly influenced by the best speech of educated Londoners and having a lot in common with the good speech of Toronto or New York. The word research is variously pronounced depending on where you are and how your parents spoke. Americans tend to emphasize prefixes, so research is pronounced REEsurch. The Oxford dictionary prefers the emphasis on the second syllable (ruh-SURCH), and that’s the preferred pronunciation in Canada as well as in Britain. “Cultivated formal” is the standard in this book, but a common, everyday vernacular is also acknowledged. In these pages the nitpicking reader may find provocative usage and pronunciation, intentional in some instances but undetected by author or editor in others. Preference for one way rather than another may be simply a matter of opinion. What one has always heard may be comfortable but not necessarily correct (ASH-fawlt for asphalt). On the other hand, what was recorded in a past dictionary or what is preferred in some ivory tower may be unfamiliar in popular speech. This book is full of judgement calls but it won’t settle all arguments. Like salted peanuts, words and language are addictive. This book touches on phonetics, word origins, spoonerisms, and jargon. But it is not a pronouncing dictionary. It simply pulls together word-wisdom from a variety of sources. Good speech is essential equipment, a matter of good manners. It is necessary for easy, polite authority and leadership. While this is not a “greater influence through word power” kind of book, it argues that good speech commands attention (at the office, socially, and on the podium). Words are power. Your knowledge of words may be your most important skill. It is valuable to be computer competent and to have at least rudimentary mathematical ability, even though calculators and computers do much of the “donkey work” today. But an ability to communicate effectively is indispensable. A spell check might help, but when it comes to using the appropriate word and saying it so others will understand, you are on your own. An example of misunderstanding\n\n22\n\nIntroduction from the time of the forced exodus from Newfoundland’s outports is the answer an elderly woman gave when a doctor examined her. “Have you ever been bedridden?” he asked. “Yus,” she answered proudly, “and once in a dory!” It’s Shoe Time! A malapropism can provide a laugh. Examples abound in sports and politics. You’ll find some in this book. But there can be a real cost attached. For instance, Nike’s TV spot in which Samburu tribesmen in Kenya say the Nike slogan in Maa, their native tongue. The trouble is, a watchful American anthropologist knows the language and reveals that a tribesman is really saying, “I don’t want these. Give me big shoes.” Nike also recalled thirty-eight thousand pairs of shoes with a logo that offended Muslims. The logo resembled the Arabic word Allah, the Muslim name for God. Since shoes get dirty, it was thought to be disrespectful. After the apology and withdrawal, Muslim authorities agreed not to ask for a boycott of Nike shoes. Then there was Reebok’s goof when it named a shoe after a Greek mythological character, Incubus. Trouble is, the ancient demon was notorious for raping women while they slept. Good for the image? Hardly! How about Coca-Cola’s pitch in China? It said when translated, “Bite the wax tadpole!” Or the new Ford introduced in Latin America, the Fiera, which means “ugly, old woman” in Spanish. By the way, the cola slogan, “It’s the real thing!” was the term used by Blackfoot people for the meat of the plains bison or buffalo. They called it nitapiksisako. Pronunciation Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men. — Confucius This guide offers an easy introduction to phonetics with a simple, layman’s system. Along with language trivia, word origins, and a guide to how to say many commonly mispronounced words in English, the book includes hints on major foreign languages (see Appendix B). It deals with presentation issues, including speech skills, valuable for social and career success. What is a petard? What are ehryn? How do you say asphalt and schism? What about larynx?1 The answers are in this book. It is crucial to know what words mean and how to use them in a logical, persuasive manner. We all want to express our thoughts clearly and say the words correctly.\n\n23\n\nYou Can Say That Again! First impressions are critical. Along with our grooming, dress, and manners, our speech leaves an immediate, indelible impression. Others assess us on the basis of what they learn in those first few moments. That evaluation can influence further dealings either favourably or unfavourably. On that first social transaction we judge another person’s social skills, their intellectual capacity, and their leadership qualities. Poor speech leads to conclusions, whether that is fair or not. That’s why good speech, including pronunciation, matters. Good writing and good speech leave a positive impression. They establish credibility and enhance authority. In business and social situations, how you say it is often as important as what you say. The articulate, confident individual gets ahead. Those who speak well succeed. We all want to build self esteem and gain respect. But the task involves more than just building vocabulary, even though that’s a rewarding self-improvement project. A basic vocabulary (of six thousand words) used well may serve as effectively as a huge one, if it is used with precision and creativity. (Better to say tireless than indefatigable.) So, while this book might add a few words to one’s vocabulary, its aim is to help the reader improve speech — to sound better. If a waitress or waiter sets your teeth on edge with “What would youse like?” you understand how everyday speech leaves an impression, often a poor one. In fact, the form youse as a plural, a collective of you, is simply an archaic form, no longer in favour. Today it is regarded as poor usage.2 Words for Success When we hear a name being mispronounced, we wince. If we hear a common term being mangled, we feel embarrassed for the speaker. Of course we can’t know every specialized technical term in every vocation. So, when a term stumps us we ask or look it up. And that’s a good habit. But too often we assume we know the correct meaning and pronunciation for words frequently seen in print. So we don’t look them up. And, from time to time, we’re caught with our smarts down. We want to avoid becoming pedantic, but we don’t want to be thought ignorant either. That’s why we make an effort to avoid errors in everyday speech. We’re all vulnerable. While a verbal miscue is often just an embarrassing moment — perhaps a temporary loss of credibility — sometimes the faux pas (FO-paw) can be career-threatening. A language goof is enough to destroy the hard-won credibility of a politician or journalist. We don’t have to become multilingual sophisticates, but we can have some fun and enlarge our comfort zone by learning certain basics about\n\n24\n\nIntroduction English and other major languages. We can have some fun and enjoy immediate rewards by adding a few new words to our everyday speech and using them correctly. Say it with confidence and gain authority. Words Are Thought Words are absolutely necessary for thinking, and with a minimum of words there is a minimum of thought. — Aubrey A. Douglas Words enable us to think. The greater our vocabulary, the more complex and subtle our thoughts. Concepts require words and an ease with the logic of language. It’s a fact, people who are at ease with more words are smarter. And, like blondes, logophiles have more fun. English and Phonetics We all like to sound as though we know what we are talking about. Therefore, this book focuses on how to use and say those English words that are so often misused or mispronounced. English is not a phonetic language like Spanish, French, or Italian. English breaks the rules. It’s full of oddities. Some of the tricks take us back to the Jutes, the Angles, and Saxons. Others take us back to William the Conqueror. Some even whisk us back to the time of Hadrian or Caesar. In any case, the spelling doesn’t always help.\n\n• Hearth is pronounced HARTH, not HEERTH (as heard on a Toronto radio station). • Posthumously is pronounced PAWS-tyuh-mus-lee, not post-HYOO-mus-lee. • Decorative is DEK-’ruh-tiv, not duh-KOR-uh-tiv (as heard on TV). These examples demonstrate both the issue of correct sounds, in instances when spelling might mislead us, and the problem of emphasis on the right syllable. This book begins with a look at pronunciation systems and tips on dividing words into syllables for easy emphasis. Word Origins An etymological list is an amusing way to consider language history. The ancient story of the Tower of Babel foretells the development of many languages from a single source. Does it also ask the more modern question whether we are programmed to develop language?\n\n25\n\nYou Can Say That Again! English traces its roots to eastern Europe, to sometime between 3000 and 500 B.C. It evolved with heavy influences from Teutons, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and the Norman French. Then came the printing press and the long, slow trend to spelling conformity. Later still, exploration, colonialism, and modern communication technology had their impact. Radio, television, and the computer have all been major influences on vocabulary and the way we speak. The evolution of English is the best argument against artificial rigidity. English has picked up words from all over the world and has influenced languages everywhere. In Japan, people are fighting to preserve their language in the face of an attack of English or something akin to it. The Japanese health ministry has a problem with raifu sapooto adobaizaa (life support advisory). Neo-English turns up in words like akauntabiriti (accountability). Even TV ads use “Japanglish” like creap for coffee cream. While Japanese use a French word for bread, pan, the big foreign influence is American. Golf is gorufu. On the other hand, this book explores the many words we assume are English but which actually came to us from other languages. Which English? Then there’s the special English of the Cockney Londoner, a speech now quickly disappearing, and vanishing along with it is the street skill of rhyming slang. There are contending stories about the origin of the word Cockney: one is that the term comes from France, where visiting Londoners were identified at one time by the plumes or cockades on their hats. More on Cockney English later. Yet another English is the controversial “Black English” of California and some other parts of the United States and Canada. Ebonics has entered the vocabulary along with some new syntax. There’s also the English of the Caribbean. And the English of Newfoundland. There are many dialects and accents. For instance the “Strine” of Australia. Sometimes two English speakers from different parts of the globe, or even from two different urban neighbourhoods, have difficulty understanding one another. In these pages, slang, jargon, and euphemisms get the slighting attention they deserve; they are not ignored, just belittled (an American colonial word used by Jefferson and ridiculed by the gentry back in King George III’s England). There is also a small collection of words and terms from the world of politics. For example, the word origins suggest it is appropriate for an alderman (or -woman) to talk about what happens on his or her watch. The reader will find a section on swearing, not intended to encourage it, but simply to understand how one person’s four-letter curse is another\n\n26\n\nIntroduction person’s healthy, emotional outlet. Bastard and bitch were thought too shocking to put in the newspaper until recently. Not now. A few years ago a Wizard of Id comic-strip character called the king a bugger. No problem in the United States, but in Canada the word had to be changed to the less vulgar beggar. Today, even on radio and television, you’ll hear words you didn’t hear a decade ago. It’s true that censorship is anathema — we recall the ludicrous depredations of the notorious Dr. Bowdler and his censorious daughter. The escalation of foul language in Hollywood’s films makes one wonder how they will make a dramatic, street-talk point in the future when we are no longer shocked by the expectoration of four-letter words. Just as special-effect chases, crashes, and explosions have replaced classic dramatic form (conflict, climax, denouement, and so on), gutter language is a no-brainer approach to writing what passes for dialogue. Check Shakespeare. What were his expletives? Forsooth and zounds! Is it just that we grew accustomed to them and now think them simply archaic and cute? Spoonerisms (metatheses) and Oxford’s remarkable Doctor Spooner get some attention in these pages, too, along with puns, limericks, and word puzzles. Foreign Words For some major languages, this guide offers tips on the pronunciation of consonants, vowels, and combinations. And it gives guidance on where the emphasis usually falls. Languages covered in some detail include Chinese, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish, and Spanish. Learn the rules and you will seldom be stumped by a new foreign word or name. (See Appendix B.)\n\n• • •\n\nGenoa is said JEN-o-ah, not jin-O-uh (as heard on a Toronto TV newscast). Toronto is said tuh-RAWN-toe, not TRAWNA. Bordelaise is said bor-d’LEZ.\n\nFor some other major language groups, or countries such as Turkey, India, the islands of the Pacific, a few hints and tips are offered. Many foreign place names can be found in gazetteers or in the Geographical Section of the Webster Collegiate Dictionary. Many names and words are transliterated using the sound values of European languages such as English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, or Portuguese. In some cases the transliteration depends on which of the old imperial powers was once in authority. Even Chinese and Japanese names are spelled out in English phonetics.\n\n27\n\nYou Can Say That Again! Words, Words, Words For words, like nature, half reveal, And half conceal the soul within.... — Lord Tennyson An alphabetical list of commonly misused words attempts to help the reader avoid most embarrassing errors in everyday speech. It is a list to build on while one checks the dictionary regularly. It’s a list to consult when in doubt about conflicting meanings of words such as career and careen, or poutine and poteen. It is a fun trivia list to check for usage questions like that of bacterium versus bacteria. And it’s a list to explore for pronunciation of words like access, flaccid, and succinct. Another list offers guidance on pronunciation of personal and geographical names. Yet another alphabetical list deals with some Latin, Greek, and other foreign terms and phrases. And there’s a list of musical terms and names, too. Check for Purcell and Puccini. While these are helpful lists, it is not the intention of this book to be a comprehensive pronouncing dictionary. This volume is an aid to avoiding common traps of mispronunciation or misuse. Viva Voce: Voice and Presentation A chapter on presentation deals with organization of material. It offers an armature on which to build content systematically. It discusses the “proem,” the “Three Tell System,” and the “Rule of Three” for telling humorous stories. It also touches on semantics, phrasing, breathing, and other presentation considerations. In addition, this section discusses the human voice and how to use it. It examines briefly the chore of recording narration. Some tongue twisters round out the chapter, inviting you to trip the light fantastic, linguistically speaking. Included is a short chapter on broadcast journalism, offering some standard preparation and style tips. “Father Murphy’s Ass” takes an irreverent look at how perspective and brevity can distort a headline; how literal fact can be twisted into bias. This chapter considers the need for an informed public and the role of the media in a democracy. Public attitudes are also considered, along with the issue of news as entertainment. In addition to the issue of the trivialization of news, the media section touches on editing and on the demand for brevity and drama in “sound bites.” But broadcasting is a business with a prime interest in the profit line, so it comes as no surprise that compromises are made in businessnews reporting and even in language use in order to please sponsors. This chapter also argues that public broadcasters have a special responsibility, not just to inform, but to demonstrate a love of good speech.\n\n28\n\nIntroduction Nyms, Phobes, and Philes Is it a “phalanx of prostitutes” or “a pride of loins”? Included is a section on -nyms of various kinds, such as antonyms, eponyms, homonyms, synonyms, and acronyms. This section also deals with -phobes and -philes (hates and loves). There are lists of prefixes and suffixes, useful in figuring out meanings or whether words are legitimate though unfamiliar. This chapter also tackles common singular-versusplural difficulties and the amusing problem of collectives. When “ladies of the night” congregate, it isn’t always in a seraglio or bordello3. Effective communication requires clarity. Distractions of accent, speech peculiarities, or any affectation get in the way. We hope to be immediately understood. But sometimes we are tempted to use words for show, to appear erudite. If we use a term incorrectly, however, we convince the listener of our ignorance. It’s better to aim for simple, direct connection and understanding. To paraphrase Churchill, the old and simple words are best. The appropriate adages are “Less is more,” and the KISS formula, “Keep It Simple, Stupid.” The Elements of Style by Strunk and White makes the point effectively. It is as valuable a guide to clear writing as any text ever written, as valuable as any good dictionary. Time changes all things, including spellings and pronunciations. One of the beauties of English is that it is flexible and adaptable. It welcomes new words. It accepts new meanings for old words. Popular usage imposes new ways of saying things. Gay once meant light-hearted, filled with fun. Its sexual-orientation meaning makes some of the song lyrics of just a few decades ago seem quite silly. And there are fads in words and usage. Jazz trumpet players once talked about their embouchures as their “chops.” Now players of stringed instruments, too, and even dancers talk about their chops when they refer to their skills. The language is always in a state of flux. And not just English. Flamenco comes from an Andalusian word (meaning “Flemish”) applied to the Jews returning from banishment in Flanders. They had fled there after the defeat of the Muslims in southern Spain, when the monarch imposed Catholicism on everyone. The term came to be applied to a lifestyle, to music, and to a freewheeling dance on the margins of respectability. Standards While language is always changing, there are norms. Without standards, English would not have become the lingua franca of our time. So, while we avoid rigidity, it helps if we acknowledge standards of educated usage which find common ground and preserve meaning. Carelessness can lead to misunderstanding and unintended humour:\n\n29\n\nYou Can Say That Again! ENRAGED COW INJURES FARMER WITH AXE PLANE TOO CLOSE TO GROUND, CRASH PROBE INDICATES STUDY FINDS SEX, PREGNANCY LINK TWO SISTERS REUNITED AFTER 18 YEARS IN CHECKOUT LINE COLD WAVE LINKED TO TEMPERATURES. It is bothersome enough that the language is always changing and that, during change, meanings can be ambiguous. Naturally this hampers understanding. It is well worth the effort, therefore, to stick with the common, current, educated pronunciation and meaning. Some argue that caring about correct pronunciation and use is elitist, even a form of snobbery. They argue that common, everyday speech is democratic, the language of “everyman.” This is the argument of the careless populist versus the elitist, pedantic snob. But people who care about communicating effectively and gracefully will defend the language against careless abuse. Anyone who mounts a podium has a duty to use the language with care. Theirs is a leadership role. Those in the media have a special responsibility. Too many broadcasters seem to feel they know it all without checking a dictionary or thesaurus. Or perhaps they really feel the popular speech of the street serves well enough. Each of us favours the pronunciation and speech habits we learned as we grew up. These habits were formed within a family culture, in our ethnic environment, and in the cultural stratum in which we moved. Our prejudice is that, if our habits aren’t the universal standard, they are at least “normal” and anything else is “putting on airs.” One excuse the electronic media may have is that educators don’t set a high-enough standard. Latin is no longer obligatory, not even one year of it, so the foundation is weaker. New styles of language are popularized in film, television comedy, and the advertising industry. So a special effort is required from teachers and from the media in order to maintain a standard of speech superior to that of the careless vernacular of the street. It is fair to argue that English is malleable and that this is one of its great advantages. We might even accept the argument that the short form Inc., once read as incorporated, is often pronounced “INK” these days. Perhaps the advertising writers and pop-speak advocates have won that one, just as corp. (said KORP) threatens to replace corporation. And add\n\n30\n\nIntroduction KO for company to the list. But irregardless is still wrong. It is not a word. Regardless will do. And notorious still has a negative connotation, as does infamous, in spite of common misuse. Neither word is simply a synonym for famous or well-known. Sounds Like A common error is to treat English as a phonetic language and to pronounce every syllable as valuable. So we hear vegetable said “VEJ-etAB-ul” instead of “VEJ-ta-bul.” Or listener is sometimes pronounced LISten-ir instead of LIS-nir. Some people even introduce vowel sounds that don’t exist, turning athlete into ATH-ul-eet or jewelry into JOO-el-ir-ee instead of JOOL-ree and saying FIL-um instead of FILM. The truth is, we’re often correct when we drop syllables: Wednesday is said WENZ-day. As to words and names from other languages, Paris is PAR-is and not puh-REE. The latter is clearly an affectation in English context. Sportscasters are fond of saying MO-ray-al kan-aj-YENZ, affecting a French pronunciation for the “Habs” but often mispronouncing the names of French Canadian players. In Canada, in English, Trois-Rivières is officially traw-riv-YAIR but Montreal is mun-tree-AWL and not mowray-AWL. The Pas in Manitoba is thuh PAW, Sault Ste. Marie is SOO sint mar-EE. And the main intersection in downtown Winnipeg is Portage (POR-tij) and Main. Canadian place names (as is true in the United States for names originally French or Spanish) present a problem. Some get full French value. Others have been anglicized to some degree. They are many words of French origin in English and others little changed from their Latin origins. Most of them have been anglicized and can be considered English words. Returning to a French pronunciation for valet or homage or sorbet is just an affectation, but it has acquired some cachet (ka-SHAY). It is a matter of vogue. It is not incorrect for an English speaker to say VAL-et or SOR-bit in an English context. The motion picture industry in Hollywood likes to say o-MAWZH (homage). They seem to think it’s sophisticated. The English word is said HAW-mij or AW-mij. In the same category is penchant. It is an English word in an English context and said PEN-ch’nt. It may not be wrong to say pawnSHAWN, but it is putting on airs. The problem is, some words from French have been thoroughly and correctly anglicized while others are still said with an approximation of the French. We still pronounce fait accompli as “fet a-kawm-PLEE.” For noblesse oblige we say “no-BLES oBLEEZH.” With the term for treason or taking liberties, lèse majesté, we even retain the grave accent on the e in the first word and the acute accent over the final e in most English renderings of the term pronounced “lez mazh-es-TAY.” Contretemps is another instance of adoption of a foreign word with the original pronunciation retained.\n\n31\n\nYou Can Say That Again! We should stick with popular anglicized usage unless the word is commonly pronounced in the manner of indigenous usage as in Worcester, WOO-stir, or Leicester, said LES-tir. A street in downtown Toronto, Breadalbane, is often mispronounced BRED-il-BANE, when it should be bruh-DAWL-bin. Balliol, another Toronto street, is locally pronounced buh-LOIL and seldom BAL-ee-ul as at the college in England. Some names have two correct pronunciations. In the United States, Arkansas is pronounced AR-kin-SAW when it’s the state but ar-KANzis when it’s the river. Back to Toronto, where the street is Spadina, said spuh-DY-nah, while the mansion near Casa Loma is called spu-DEENuh. Dalhousie University in Halifax is pronounced dal-HOWZ-ee. The port in Ontario near Niagara is pronounced duh-LOOZ-ee. For foreign names, check the index to determine the country and the language and then check Appendix B for phonetic guidance. Clearly, we shouldn’t make snap assumptions based on the spelling. It pays to check. Not just names, but even English words we think we know. Under the heading of troublesome English words, this guide takes sides on some issues but not on others. So the word harass is HAR-us and not huh-RASS. The jury is still out on that one, especially in the United States. And it is hard to tell which side is winning on the kilometre issue. KIL-o-ME-tur is clearly correct if you stick with the meaning: a thousand metres. There is no reason it should rhyme with thermometer, but kilAWM-i-tir threatens to become common. Often is said AWF-in. Expertise is said ex-pur-TEEZ, not ex-pur-TEES. In Canada, foyer is pronounced FOY-ay. With some words there is no tolerance for even popular mispronunciation. For instance, you “plumb the depths of something.” The word plumb means “the lead weight on the end of a line” (Fr. plomb). Samuel Clemens took his nom de plume (pen name) from the practice of plumbing the depths of the Mississippi to avoid running the paddlewheel boats aground. “Mark twain!” (two) was the shout to the captain to let him know how deep or shallow the river was. Plummet, on the other hand, means “to fall” — nothing to do with lead or plumb. Succinct is said suk-SINKT (not sus-INK). And, while “to err is human, to forgive divine,” it is not said AIR but IR, to rhyme with fur or sir. The goal is speech that doesn’t draw attention to itself by either error or affectation. Clean out the common dross from everyday speech and sound as though you know what you are talking about. Above all, remember that as Confucius put it, “the whole end of speech is to be understood.”\n\n32\n\nIntroduction Notes 1. Larynx (important to voice production, see Presentation) is pronounced LAR-inks, not LAR-niks. 2. In English there is no formal you pronoun as there is in other European languages (tu and vous in French). English once had the singular form (thou, thee, and thine) and the plural (ye and you). During the Middle Ages, the forms were used like tu and vous. Gradually the polite plural, you, was more widely used and the distinction was devalued. You was used to address everyone, regardless of status and number. Soon thou was less common, surviving only in prayers. 3. Seraglio is derived partly from the Turkish saray (palace). Sarayli means “woman of the palace.” The Latin serrare (to lock) also contributed, yielding seraglio (sir-AL-yo): “women’s quarters.” Bordello comes from Italian and, originally, from the Old French word bordel (small farm). Harem is from Arabic haram for “a prohibited place” or “sanctuary.”\n\nQuiz 1 ? 1) What does fiera mean in Spanish? 2) Mark the syllable which gets the heaviest emphasis in decorative. 3) Mark the syllable in Genoa that gets the heaviest accent 4) The word flamenco came to Spain from 5) Write the following phonetically: schism, Paris, listener, err, and deter.\n\nFor answers, see Appendix A.\n\n33\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter One Pronunciation\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter One Pronunciation\n\nSpeech is civilization itself. — Thomas Mann One good reason for improving the way we speak is to communicate more effectively. Another is to make a good impression. Even if we use an informal, non-standard vernacular for everyday purposes, a better, “Sunday best” suit of clothes is helpful on special occasions. Some make the effort for career enhancement. Others simply want to set a good example for their children. We are fortunate if our parents speak well. And we’re blessed if we have an influential teacher or two. The spoken word is a valuable social tool. Its prehistoric invention required some agreement on the meanings of sounds or combinations of sounds. Our ancestors had to agree on how to say consistently a certain sound or set of sounds. Then, presumably, they agreed on how they would arbitrarily apply their invented words to particular things or events. We still make those tacit agreements. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able to communicate. With writing we try to represent the sounds of words. But the evolution of writing and our ever-changing spoken language make it necessary to devise another system, one that will accurately represent the sounds we make when we speak. That sound system is phonetics. Syllable by syllable we break words into sound elements and represent them in order. Phonetic becomes fo-NET-ik. Language becomes LANGwij. Invention becomes in-VEN-tshun. These examples use a simple form of phonetics. There are others capable of far greater accuracy and subtlety, but in these pages we work with common English sound values with the stressed syllable in upper case. This chapter explores several systems used to represent the sounds of speech. Some attention is also given to copy preparation, syllabification, and accenting or emphasis. Phrasing and breathing are important too, because ideas are conveyed by combinations of words or sounds. Break a sentence in the wrong place and you change its meaning or even render it meaningless. We have to hear word groupings, phrases, and clauses in order to understand what is being said. We hear inflection variety as well. We hear ideas, pictures, and feelings.\n\nYou Can Say That Again! So it matters a lot where you breathe. The song lyric “What is this thing called love?” shows how the same words mean very different things, depending on the rhythm, the inflection, the phrasing, and the emphasis. “What is this thing called, love?” “What is this thing called love?” “What is this thing called love?” “What is this thing called, love?” And, “What is this thing called love?” Formal, Informal A cultivated speaker uses a different standard in a public speech than he employs in everyday conversation around the water cooler. In rapid and informal discussion the words has, him, and his, unless specially stressed, lose their h’s. The t disappears from combinations like must go, sit down, next day, and so on. They become phonetically mus’go, siddown, nex’day. Many words have two levels of pronunciation, stressed and unstressed. Stress can change a pronunciation or even influence the dropping of a sound. “Did you talk to him?” could be “Did you TALK to ‘im?” And that’s still acceptable speech. For another meaning, it could be “Did you talk to HIM?” In this case, the word him gets full value because we want to know if a particular person was consulted. These distinctions convey meaning. Elisions and contractions are okay. On the other hand, not so acceptable is the question “Dijatawktum?” The appropriate degree of formality in speech varies from setting to setting, whether it be the public platform, popular broadcasting, the boardroom, a seminar, or a casual dinner. If we acknowledge that we make these distinctions all the time, perhaps we won’t feel selfconscious when we choose to “speak up” when asked to make postprandial remarks from the head table or make the team’s presentation in the corporate boardroom. “Cultivated formal” is the speech standard used for special, formal occasions, a eulogy for instance. “Cultivated informal” is the speech we hear most of the time on radio and television — except, of course, in some sitcoms. To illustrate our willingness to alter our speech — including our grammar and even voice production — to suit the occasion, consider the politician who inserts a little of the vernacular, sometimes even mild expletives, in order to sound more down-to-earth and ingratiate himself with a particular segment of the electorate. Appropriateness is an important consideration. But there are risks in cutting your vocal cloth to suit the situation. The politician might be considered a phony if the performance is unconvincing. A white politician is a fool to try to speak Ebonic English. And then there are dialects. A dialect is not just a provincial deviation, but a combination of characteristics peculiar to a place or social group. Each of us has a unique dialect reflecting influences that began when we were in the cradle.\n\n38\n\nPronunciation “Standard” and “non-standard” are terms used to describe speech considered “socially acceptable.” “Standard” is usually applied to the speech of educated people in the community. In England the term “received pronunciation” is used rather than “standard.” It is the speech heard in upper-crust London, and it has been encouraged in prestigious schools and universities. This is not to condone the lisp, the w for r, or the stuttering affectations of some Britons who wish to be mistaken for landed gentry. In North America there are local and regional variations and some of them are preferred. But no barrier to communication exists, except perhaps in the case of so-called Black English, which is understood only within its own narrow social confines. Perhaps it can be compared with the French joual in Quebec.1 Another way to make the speech distinction is to contrast “cultivated” with “folk” speech. Many regional differences are disappearing, as a kind of universal English takes over with the help of television and film.2 There is still a distinctly Canadian speech. There’s no question, the British influence was pervasive for a long time. More recently Canadians have been greatly exposed to American speech and usage. The Americanization of Canadian speech is like a flood. But, while Canadian English may have a lot in common with American and British speech, there are still some distinctions we can make. The similarities of American and Canadian English are not surprising because the British Isles are the common source. After the American Civil War, the influx of United Empire Loyalists into Canada maintained the similarities. Later, British and American immigration reinforced the habits of speech brought to Canada previously. And standards preserved in Ontario schools moved west when Ontarians headed to the Prairies and the West Coast. Americans say they can tell a Canadian from an American by the pronunciation of house or out and about. What they hear is what’s called “Canadian Raising,” a term used to describe the non-lowering of some diphthongs usually lowered in other dialects. The tongue is raised higher for the diphthong in knife and house than in knives and houses. “Canadian Raising” is quite common in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Victoria. But the trend is away from raising toward more American values, so cot and caught often sound the same, as do don and dawn, caller and collar. We increasingly hear the same vowel sound in all of the words in these examples. That’s the way Americans say these words, except in places near the Canadian border. “T-flapping” and “T-deletion” are two tendencies common to many Canadians and Americans. A lot of Canadians say t as d between vowels and after r. That is, waiting and wading sound alike, as do latter and ladder, and hearty and hardy. The phrase “put the pedal to the metal” usually sounds more like “put the pedal to the medal.” Ottawa is often\n\n39\n\nYou Can Say That Again! said “Oddawa” (AWD-i-waw). Too often Toronto is said “Torrona” or “Trawna.” There are instances of distinctive Canadian word usage, such as the use of tap in some places rather than faucet. Porch and verandah, and pail versus bucket further illustrate these vocabulary distinctions. The variants aren’t exclusively American or Canadian — some words are just more likely to be heard in Canada than in the States. Similarly, more Canadians are likely to say lever, schedule, aunt, route, hostile, mobile, and missile differently than most of their American cousins. Canadians say LEE-ver (lever). Canadians more often say BEEN rather than BIN, while anti-, semi-, and multi- rhyme with me in Canada, while mobile and missile rhyme with Nile, rather than the American ill. Canadians also enjoy an indigenous vocabulary. From aboriginal roots come words like toboggan, mukluk, mackinaw, anorak, parka, malamute, and husky. From French come mush (marcher) and toque (TOOK or TYOOK). And, while most words of French origin have been anglicized over the centuries, Canadians unconsciously adopt French values in the pronunciation of many words. For instance, we say garage (gar-AWZH) differently from both Americans (guh-RAJ) and the British (GAR-ij). How long distinctively Canadian English will survive is anyone’s guess. The tendency to Americanization is powerful. Phonetics How do you say Groton? For that matter, how do you say Connecticut? The city and state are pronounced GRAW-tun, kuh-NET-i-KUT (the first c in Connecticut is silent). As illustrated here, it is helpful, when dealing with unfamiliar words, to have a standard, convenient way to write the sounds. We need to know if an a is pronounced as in hat or as in hate. Is the symbol e pronounced as in net, or the letter u as in nut or as in mute? And, as with vowels, we need to know how the consonant sounds are indicated. Is a c said like s or like k? To complicate matters, the sound values of some combinations of letters change. English is not consistent. Other languages have their own unique sounds for their alphabets. If French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish are phonetically consistent, English is not.3 Fortunately we have the International Phonetic Alphabet to help us record the sounds of the broad range of living languages and the variety of sometimes subtle differences not always immediately apparent to the unfocused ear. The phonetic system is a great aid for those who need to represent and reproduce vocal sounds with precision. But, for everyday use of non-linguists, we need a simpler system. Dictionaries such as the Webster Collegiate or the Canadian Oxford provide their own phonetic systems.\n\n40\n\nPronunciation Place names offer more examples of the value of phonetic guides:\n\n• • • • • •\n\nEtobicoke, the western suburb of Toronto, is pronounced ih-TOE-bih-KO (not -KOKE). Lake Nipissing is pronounced NIH-pis-ing, not ni-PISS-ing Pictou County in Nova Scotia is said PIK-toe (not -too). Newfoundland is pronounced nyoo-f ’nd-LAND. Brisbane, Australia, is said BRIZ-bin. In Indiana, reflecting the influence of Canadian voyageurs from the St. Lawrence River valley, it’s Terre Haute — tair-ah HOTE.\n\nTo avoid pronunciation errors we can make a habit of using the dictionary. We can learn the rules of our language and hope they will keep us on the rails, knowing all along that in English there are lots of exceptions. With place names, correct pronunciation is even more difficult than with other vocabulary. Move to a new part of the country or elsewhere in the world and there’s a new list of place names to learn. Locals always enjoy teaching newcomers how to say local place names. In North America there are lots of place names not said as they are spelled. Looks Like, Sounds Like Fortunately there are guides simpler than the International Phonetic Alphabet. They work with a more limited range of sounds. The systems devised by the broadcast news wire services explain pronunciation by comparison with common English words and sounds. So we are told, for instance, that the French word fait (from the verb faire, “to make”) rhymes with the English word met when followed by a word starting with a vowel. Thus we get the phonetic guide: fait accompli — FET uh-kawmPLEE. (The t in fait is sounded because of the liaison with the word accompli.) Here, the emphasis or accented syllable is in upper case.4 The finely tuned dictionary phonetic systems use a (‘) symbol to show which syllable gets the emphasis and they often show both primary and secondary accent. In this book the syllable that gets the strongest emphasis is in BOLD UPPER CASE. Phonemes and Morphemes Aristotle was wrong to say the word is the smallest meaningful unit of speech, just as the atom was thought to be the smallest particle of matter. The “phoneme” is the smallest, sometimes meaningful, unit of speech. The p of pat is a phoneme. It is a sound but not necessarily a syllable. The\n\n41\n\nYou Can Say That Again! minimal parts which convey meaning are “morphemes,” like map or mat, linguistic units which contain no smaller meaningful components. Sounds Signifying Something The range of sounds in use varies from language to language. English has forty-five phoneme elements, including twenty-one consonants, nine vowels, three semi-vowels (y, w, r), four stresses, four pitches, one juncture (pause between words) and three terminal contours (inflections with which we end sentences). We are all familiar with the interrogatory upward inflection which enables us to turn a statement into a question. We also hear this inflection when the speaker appears to be asking for the listener’s permission or agreement; it is not a very authoritative approach when it becomes a speech pattern — it undermines the speaker’s credibility. Languages include consonant sounds called “fricatives,” “labials,” “plosives” and so on. Some dialects of Arabic have twenty-eight consonants but only six vowels. Most African languages are like Mandarin and Burmese (Myanmar), using pitch and stress variation more than English does. A “labial” is a sound made with the lips, like f or p. A “fricative” is a consonant made by the passage of air through a narrow aperture. Examples are s, z, ah, zh, h, v, f, th. “Plosive” sounds are characterized by the sudden forceful but brief passage of air. “Put the pen on the table, Tom,” is an example of a plosive-laden sentence, likely to cause some “popping” on a microphone. The tongue twister “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” is another case of p-popping plosives. As young children discover, the loss of a front tooth can suddenly create a whistle or a lisp. A “sibilant” sound, except for the limited version necessary for saying s or sh, is to be avoided. It can be a problem for microphones and can annoy the listener. If nothing else, it’s a distraction. Sometimes a hiss or a whistle is just a matter of carelessness or a bad habit. It can also be caused by the conformation of the teeth or even illfitting dentures. Or it may be an affectation, just as some people affect a w-sound for an r. Schwa One problem occurring in pronunciation, and in representing spoken sounds with phonetic symbols, is the weak or obscured vowel as in the first syllable of the word above (uh-BUV). Sometimes the diminished vowel is situated at the end of a word; sometimes in the middle. In phonetics the a in above and the e in often are represented by the inverted e symbol called “schwa” which is found in dictionaries and in the\n\n42\n\nPronunciation International Phonetic Alphabet. It is not used in this guide. Instead, the sound of the a in about is shown as uh (uh-BOWT). There are many instances of such indeterminate vowel sounds in our speech. Sometimes the appropriate representation changes, using other vowels with h to approximate the sound. In other cases you may find a vowel so diminished it is represented by an apostrophe to show there is something there but nothing that deserves much emphasis. Vegetable might be shown as VEJ-tuh-b’l. The point is that the vowel doesn’t get full vocal value. It is almost lost and unheard, not critical to understanding. Whole syllables may disappear in correct speech, as in the name Worcester pronounced WOO-stir. If a vowel occurs in an unstressed syllable, it is pronounced as an obscure vowel, like a in above, the o in consent, or the e in silent. Keep in mind that it is not good speech to articulate and give full voice to every letter. It is good speech in many instances to lose some letters and occasionally whole syllables. The same is true for sentences said aloud rather than read. Whole words get little voice with emphasis being focused on the important ideas. The International Phonetic Alphabet This guide sets out to make it easier to come close to the sound values in a word or name. It isn’t necessary to fine-tune the study to the point of using all the sounds represented by the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet. The simpler system, already in common use in media newsrooms, enables anchors to sound as though they know what they are talking about when dealing with foreign leaders and geography. When the simpler phonetics are in the script or on the teleprompter, the correct pronunciation is automatic with no interruption of flow, no embarrassing hesitation, nothing distracting the listener from the sense of the message. We will deal with that phonetic system — the one used in this book — after a closer look at the valuable International Phonetic Alphabet. For anyone serious about the nuances of accurate pronunciation, it is worth some study.

The trouble is, no two newsroom systems are alike. An anchor may not be able to understand another writer’s symbols. An editor’s attempt to help an anchor or reporter could lead to misunderstanding and a fumble on the air. And mispronunciation sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb. It distracts. Worse, it undermines understanding and credibility. That’s why Broadcast News (CP) has developed a consistent system. The broadcaster is concerned with sounds. Who cares if there’s a spelling error as long as the intended word is heard? It’s more important that the listener or viewer knows by sound what was said. Can the reader break up the word into syllables and give each one its due? Can the aid be written in above the line or in parenthesis and upper case after the troublesome name? If the letters come from a language other than our own, can we approximate the sounds they convey? Are there any rules to help us come close to a correct accent and sound? In most cases it is wise to check a dictionary or some other authority. The phonetic guidance system used is a matter of personal preference. Use the International Phonetic Alphabet if you wish to reproduce the full range of subtle sound differences in a number of tongues. Or, if you prefer, use the system in your dictionary or one you devise for yourself. If you want to come close but aren’t concerned with the nuances, you can use this guide: Vowels: a ay ah aw e ee i y\n\na as in hat, marry. a as in late, plate. a as in father. a as in law. e as in ebb, set, merry, next. e as in feet, feat. i as in hit, big. i as in wine. y as in by.\n\n45\n\nYou Can Say That Again! o oo aw ow u yu, yoo\n\no as in oats. o as in poor. o as in not, ox. o as in loud. u as in up. u as in news, beauty.\n\nConsonants: b c ch d f g h j k l m n p r s sh t th v w y z zh\n\nb as in bat. c as in bacillus. ch as in church, cha-cha. d as in do, rudder. f as in fit, differ. g as in get, beg, trigger, give. h as in hit, hear, behave. g or j as in just or fudge, gesture. k or c as in kiss, Quebec, cocoon. l as in low, all. m as in my, him. n as in now. p as in pot. r as in read. s as in see. s as in shoe. t as in ten. th as in thin. v as in vice. w as in west. y as in yes, lawyer. N.B.: y may also represent the long i as in by, wine (see vowels above). z as in zeal or zenith, or those. s as in vision, derision.\n\nAs mentioned, good speech sounds natural and unaffected. Some letters aren’t even sounded. Sometimes whole syllables go missing when a word is said aloud. And elisions which run the end of one word into the start of another are natural and acceptable. And, while we’re at it, contractions are encouraged. Cannot should be can’t. Will not is preferably won’t. On the other hand, we should pronounce -ing endings and not permit sloppiness to creep into our speech. But we should recognize that it’s natural to make some compromises when we translate from writing to speech.\n\n46\n\nPronunciation Accenting — Stress Emphasis is also part of what we hear. Where the stress falls in a word helps us recognize and understand. So, when we are writing a phonetic aid for ourselves, we need to come close to the appropriate emphasis, especially when pronouncing a foreign name or word. First we break the word into syllables or parts that sound like syllables to us. Some languages usually put the accent on the final syllable. This is the case in French. The verb revenir is said “ruh-v’-NEER.” In other languages — like Japanese — the syllables seem to the Western ear to have almost equal emphasis, and intonation is used to vary meaning of similar sounds and sound combinations. Of course, with Japanese, we have used English sound values for the transliteration. Our attempts to represent Japanese values phonetically are crude approximations, as in sukiyaki — soo-kee-YA-kee, or Nagano — NAG-an-o. Sometimes the Western ear hears an accented syllable where there is none. Once a word is divided into parts, the next move is to find out what sound is indicated by each letter or combination of letters. For instance: Gianni Schicchi succinct fromage wunderbar\n\ngi/ann/i schi/cchi suc/cinct fro/mage wun/der/bar\n\nJAWN-ee SKEE-kee suk-SINKT fro-MAWZH VOON-der-bar\n\nIn French and other Romance languages, once you know the value of individual letters, you can put vowels together to come up with sounds which may be difficult at first for those whose mother tongue is English. Unlike English, la belle langue is actually phonetic. For instance, the usually mispronounced name of the great NHL star Mario Lemieux is not le-MYOO as most commentators have said it. The last syllable is a combination of i (ih), e (eh), u (oo) (a three-vowel diphthong, if that weren’t a contradiction in terms) run together to give us -MYUH. This is a crucial demonstration. Once you know the sound values, whatever the language, you can figure out how to say the word. Sport stars accept popular mispronunciations of their names. The Russians, Swedes, Czechs, Italians, and French Canadians playing in the National Hockey League accept the often clumsy, sometimes cavalier, treatment of their names. Some sportscasters pride themselves on getting the pronunciation right. Others seem to take a perverse (if not xenophobic) pride in mangling names. Until sometime in 1998 Don Cherry was unable to manage goalie Patrick Roy’s name on “Hockey Night In Canada,” and usually said it to rhyme with boy.7\n\n47\n\nYou Can Say That Again! This isn’t good enough in most situations. For the majority of us, our name is an important part of who we are. When it is mispronounced, we are offended. When listeners hear a speaker mispronounce a name, they lose confidence in the source. And they are distracted. When broadcasters — especially news anchors — get names wrong they lose credibility. For some that’s not important. Many commentators get paid by the rant, not for being correct. (Some get paid for rant and for being right, but that’s an ideological arrangement.) Preparation As the smooth old pros know, it pays to read copy in advance. This isn’t always possible, so some politicians, after-dinner speakers, and broadcasters pride themselves on their ability to “lift it off the paper” when reading it “cold.” Some business executives do themselves a disservice and inflict pain on their staff by regularly presenting unfamiliar material at meetings. Even the most skilled readers are wise to do themselves and their audience the favour of quietly and privately reading the copy aloud before a presentation. A lot of politicians consider themselves orators when they are not. Politicians often depart from scripts prepared for them and wander into culs-de-sac of their own creation. A malapropism or mispronunciation here and there is of little consequence — they think. But voters may turf the rascals out eventually, just because they find them embarrassing. The “rip and read” school of broadcasting is risky — mistakes are inevitable. Typographical errors are common and they can lead a reader out onto a meaningless limb where recovery is almost impossible. There is enough “seat of the pants” flying in broadcast news without adding to its unpredictability. Even with one’s own copy it is wise to prepare. Now that many broadcast teams no longer prepare complete hard copy for readers but depend on computerized prompters on air, it is especially wise to read everything over in advance. And, when a politician, company spokesperson, or afterdinner speaker is going to be reading someone else’s copy, it’s doubly important that the speech is read over in advance and aloud — into a tape recorder if possible. Attention to copy preparation soon becomes a habit and the pronunciation rules for major languages quickly become second nature. Examine the copy for thoughts, the phrasing, and the words. Read the material aloud. Print the phonetics above the line if possible. Do it syllable by syllable so there will be no dread, no surprise, no doubt, and no interruption of the flow when the text is read aloud.\n\n48\n\nPronunciation (zyoo-GAN-awv) The arrival of Syuganov, / the Communist candidate for the Russian Presidency / attracted a large crowd,/ shouted down by.... Not only is the proper name phonetically indicated, but the key thoughts are underlined. The articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are little more than spacers in oral/aural communications. There is a difference between the grammar of print and the grammar of vocal presentation. Grammar and punctuation can be pedantic in speech. As a rule, neglect articles, conjunctions, and prepositions. Sometimes even a verb is little more than a link between ideas as is the case of the first two uses of is in this sentence. Don’t emphasize such a verb. Give it little voice. Some broadcasters say the to sound like thee when it is unnecessary. The is said thuh (schwa) in most contexts unless the following noun begins with a vowel or when the article requires special emphasis to make a distinction. The same goes for and as well as other conjunctions and prepositions, unless special emphasis is needed. For instance, you may need to distinguish to versus from, or in from out. But normally they get only secondary or tertiary emphasis. In vocal presentation many words fall through the cracks — and so they should. It is not good speech to pronounce every syllable or give them equal weight. It is not good speech to give words equal voicing. The placement of emphasis is essential to the understanding of a text. Inappropriate emphasis is a common sin among poorly trained broadcasters today. They may argue that this is their style, but they are simply misguided. Read the following sentence aloud, giving heavier emphasis to the bolded words: If you can, take a ride on the train and drink in the inspiring beauty of the Rocky Mountains. This is an example of inappropriate emphasis on words which convey little meaning. It is an unnatural way to read the sentence. The following emphasizes the words that are essential to meaning: If you can,\n\n/ take a ride on the train / and drink in the inspiring beauty / of the Rocky Mountains. If you were to read only the bolded words to a listener, the meaning would be clear. Of course, inflection distinctions help too. Unfortunately too many broadcasters develop a speech pattern. It may become their signature sound. But it has the effect of undermining the sense of what\n\n49\n\nYou Can Say That Again! they are reading. A singsong delivery — whether rhythm, or phrasing, or repeated inflection — can subvert the message. Inappropriate emphasis distorts. It can make it difficult for listeners to parse a sentence and extract the meaning as they listen. Remember, the spoken word is instant and ephemeral. Unlike the printed word, there is no second look. Phrasing — Marking Copy Phrasing is the practice of grouping words together according to thought, fact, or idea. In the logic of oral presentation, articles and conjunctions have less importance. It is helpful to mark phrase groupings as we have done above. Natural breath control helps. And we mark for emphasis, too. This is the grammar of the way we speak. Develop a marking scheme that works for you. It isn’t necessary to adopt some arbitrary universal scheme. There really isn’t one, except for the one used in music. First and secondary emphasis can be distinguished by single and double underlining. Phrasing breaks can be marked with diagonals ( / ) as in the Syuganov example above. And sense groupings can be shown with curved musical-phrase brackets above the line of type. Some readers, narrators, actors, and commercial announcers use symbols for breath stops or pauses, differing according to the duration of the pause: /, //, ///, or / — /. Use ellipses ( ... ) freely. Volume can be marked as in music with f, ff, fff or p, pp, ppp for forte, fortissimo, or piano or pianissimo. Sometimes a bold underline will do. And a line above the copy can show gradually increasing or decreasing volume. Or it might be used to indicate more or less voice (projection and resonance). Symbols can be used to show a change of pace, acceleration, deceleration or even to remind the reader of a diminution in projection all the way down to a whisper. Some readers and news anchors use the brackets and other symbols from the standard keyboard as cues. Coloured highlighters can also be used. And font variation can be helpful too, especially to distinguish silent instructions from copy that is to be read aloud:\n\nNEW LEAD — BRIGHTENER A funny thing happened on the way to City Hall today where the mayor was to... If you prepare copy with all the possible symbols mentioned here you probably won’t be able to read it. The copy will be buried in an overburden of written-in cues. So be judicious. But, because of the time taken and the purposeful focus on the sense of the piece, you will have\n\n50\n\nPronunciation analyzed and parsed it enough to have almost memorized it. You will certainly understand it. And chances are your audience will understand it as you deliver your message. The late John Drainie, one of Canada’s greatest actors, always used his symbol system. Drainie was admired especially for the CBC Radio “Stage” series and for “The Investigator,” in which he impersonated U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of anti-Communist, witch-hunt infamy. In early rehearsals and read-throughs Drainie’s performance was wooden. Even in woodshed and dress rehearsal Drainie worked on his analysis. By air time his script was covered with what looked like fly specks. They were markings others couldn’t read. But they made it possible for him to bring the script and character to life. When the red ON AIR light went on, Drainie was ready, in character, intense and convincing. He hardly needed the script for reference.8 Breathing There are two considerations in phrasing. The first is our need to breathe. The other is the importance of grouping words and sounds to convey units of sense. Marking those stops in advance helps us to read ahead. “I sometimes think/ that/ never blows/ so red, The rose/ as where/ some buried Caesar/ bled.” We automatically adjust our breathing and phrasing for sense. We should try to read about a line ahead of what we are saying. Whatever we do in preparation, however, should be done only to help us read naturally. We want what we read to sound like conversation. Good speech, as we have already established, is not just a matter of giving precise vocal value to every letter in every syllable of every word. Elocution teachers once worked so passionately to correct sloppy speech that many people, including a lot of English teachers, concluded that the goal was to sound each syllable precisely. But what we really want in good speech is a natural combination of projection, appropriate inflection, resonance, intelligent phrasing, and correct but non-pedantic pronunciation. More about this in Chapter 9 on presentation. The “elocutionists” weren’t the only ones to take a puritanical and obsessively phonetic approach to speech. Early broadcasters wanted to set a standard. And they had to contend with the inadequacies of early transmission and receiving technology. Reception was often poor. The radios produced a poor approximation of the qualities of the human voice. And early microphones were, to put it charitably, primitive. So early broadcasters enunciated clearly. They spoke precisely and loudly. Early broadcast technology would not forgive sloppiness.\n\n51\n\nYou Can Say That Again! Broadcasters were careful to help the listener with very deliberate phrasing and correct pronunciation. And they projected, using their own, built-in amplification system to the fullest. That, and the staccato influence of the telegraph, gave early newscasters a punchy delivery. Among them was H. V. Kaltenborn, hammering out the news in New York in the early days of radio, converting the conventions of the newspaper of the day to a vocal equivalent. The newscasters barked out the news: “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and all the ships at sea....” In London, the BBC set high standards right from the start but their care for the language and correct pronunciation did not mean an overly formal approach. And at the CBC, Canadian guardians of the language (like W. H. “Steve” Brodie) adopted the BBC approach — a not too formal one. They tried to keep their delivery conversational and natural, even on formal occasions like the broadcast description of a royal visit. All of this took place in an era before frequency modulation (FM), or digital, and much higher fidelity. Amplitude modulation, with extremely powerful transmitters like that of KDKA in Pittsburg, might produce sounds on farm fences but didn’t promise a widespread, high-quality signal for the listener trying to pick it up with a cat’s whisker crystal set. As we have noted, English spelling is chaotic and unreliable. In French, some sounds can be represented by half a dozen spellings. Spanish is much more phonetically reliable. Italian is orthographically best, but the alphabet is inadequate for the full range of sounds. All these languages use an alphabet created by the Phoenicians and altered a bit by the Greeks. The Greeks learned to write sometime between 1000 and 700 B.C.9 They converted a few superfluous signs for peculiarly Semitic consonants and invented others to express the vowel sounds which the Semites had ignored in their system. These vowel symbols are indispensable for the unambiguous expression of Indo-European language. It was apparently from Greek colonists in Italy that the Etruscans and Romans learned to read and write, but the Romans neglected to enhance the system enough to accommodate their own limited range of sounds. For western Europe, the Roman alphabet would have to do, even though it was to prove inadequate for the chore at hand. The International Phonetic Alphabet, created by British phonetician Henry Sweet (1845—1912), may be the best. Anyone who is really serious about the study of pronunciation may want to learn it. Wire service transcriptions are much less reliable, but for practical purposes a similar, simple system is used in this book. Another phonetic system is worth mentioning in passing. It’s the one used by pilots and others communicating by radio in conditions where it is crucial that they be understood when interference or different languages might create doubt. People play fast and loose when spelling words over the phone, using any word that comes to mind. But there is a\n\n52\n\nPronunciation standard international system: Alpha, Bravo, Charley, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliette, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu (sometimes Zebra). A Canadian aircraft might identify itself as “Charley Hotel Oscar Quebec” (C–H–O–Q). Toronto International Airport is “Yankee Yankee Zulu” (Y–Y–Z). To sum up to this point, we can say that after we’ve given full attention to the appropriate sounds for the language from which any given word is derived, after we’ve determined where the accent should fall, and after we’ve decided how to write the words phonetically, our goal is to sound natural. We want to be correct but we don’t want to sound formal or contrived. Easy conversation is the sound we want. The stentorian and ominous delivery of the narrators of Movietone News, the “voices of doom,” prompts a giggle today. The best reader is the one who is almost invisible. Even among narrators and news anchors the goal is natural authority and credibility. The listener should not be conscious of style or method. The listener should simply be informed. With that as our objective, it helps us to know our language origins and history. Knowledge of roots helps us use words correctly. It helps to know where we’ve come from linguistically. Some Important Terms and Symbols Among the symbols that help us with pronunciation are those familiar from French: the acute accent ( ´ ), the grave accent ( ` ), and the circumflex accent ( ^ ). Then there’s the cedilla ( ç ) which turns a c from a k- into an s-sound. The dieresis or umlaut is found over the second of two vowels to indicate that the marked vowel gets separate pronunciation, as in Noël or Citroën. There’s the ~ which we find over the first n in the Spanish word mañana. It tells us that the letter is pronounced like the ny combination in canyon. Sometimes the word nasal is used to convey a sound value and not just as a derogatory comment on voice production. The nasal sound is heard in the French maman. A diphthong is two vowels together in one syllable for a continuous sound as in boy or sail. The unvoiced consonants are c, f, h, k, p, s, sh, and t. The voiced consonants are those to which we give sound from the throat (resonance): b, d, g, j, l, m, n, r ,v, w, y, z.\n\n53\n\nYou Can Say That Again! Elision (pronounced el-IZH-un) is the dropping of a vowel to aid the flow of speech as in I’m or j’ai (ZHAY). Liaison is the joining of a normally silent final consonant to a word starting with a vowel, as in the French mes amis (mayz-a-MEE). Stress is not just the nervousness experienced by the after-dinner speaker. It is also used to distinguish the relative force given to syllables in a word or phrase. The placement of the emphasis can determine the meaning of a sentence. Change the emphasis and you have changed the meaning, as we saw earlier with the song title “What is this thing called love?” The love song can become a joke through misplaced emphasis or stress. In a multisyllabic word the stressed sound is the one given the greatest emphasis (EM-fas-is). In many dictionaries the syllable getting the heaviest stress is preceded by ‘. A hyphen is generally used to separate syllables (syll-ab-if-ic-a-tion). We also deal with breath groups, words grouped to make sense. Because they are linked on a single breath, they convey meaning, or concept, or relationship. Notes 1. zhoo-AWL, a dialectal way of saying cheval (horse). Joual borrows heavily from English; it has been somewhat legitimized by playwright Michel Tremblay and other Quebec writers. 2. McLuhan’s “global village”? 3. Even the important “e before i” (and “i before e”) rule is not invariably dependable, especially not in proper names. That is, -ein might be pronounced -EEN. Consider conductor Leonard Bernstein. 4. Do not confuse fait with fête. They may sound the same, but one means a “party” while the other is derived from the verb to make. 5. A diphthong is a speech sound in one syllable in which the sound starts as one vowel and changes to another (say loud). In phonetics the combined sequence of sounds is usually expressed with two or more symbols. 6. Castile: a region of central Spain, the source of standard and literary Spanish. 7.
