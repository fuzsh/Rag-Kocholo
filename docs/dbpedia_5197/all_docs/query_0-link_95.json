It is our goal to help complete families by assisting them with finding their new furry family member. We believe that every animal is a unique individual and that finding the right animal for you is all about personality compatibility, not a strict set of rules. With that in mind, we try to make the search as easy for you as possible by starting with a short questionnaire to assess what you are looking for in a pet. From there it is all about talking with your adoption counselor and meeting different animals until you find The One. Once you fall in love, it is just a matter of a bit of paperwork and a small fee to help us cover part of our medical costs.\n\n*One small note: SACC reserves the right to deny any adoption, if we feel that the home is unsafe for the animal in question.\n\n​Adoption Fees:\n\nCanines:\n\n2-5 months old: $200\n\n6 months-6 years: $100\n\n7 years & older: $50\n\nFelines:\n\n2-5 months old: $100 BOGO\n\n6 months-6 years: $50\n\n7 years & older: Free\n\nBarn Cats: Free\n\n*Senior citizens 65+ can adopt a senior pet (7+ years) for Free.\n\n*30% discount for all first responders, law-enforcement, and military families.\n\n*When coming to adopt a cat, please bring at carrier. Cardboard carriers are available for $5.\n\n​\n\nIncluded with adoption:\n\nSpay/Neuter\n\nMicrochip\n\nCanine Heartworm Testing\n\nBasic Vaccines\n\nRabies Vaccines (6mos& older)\n\nPhysical exam by vet\n\nParasite treatment\n\nFeline FIV/FeLV Testing is available for $15\n\nWe would love for you to bring the whole family to meet our adoptable pets. When adopting a dog, we encourage you to bring your current dog(s) so everyone can meet before the new furkid goes home. Still worried about a finding a good match for your family? Well, did you know that we offer a trial adoption option?! See below!\n\nAdopting a pet is a big decision. Like many of life’s finer upgrades, no matter how much research and preparation you do, there’s an element of risk and uncertainty involved.\n\nIn addition to the things you can plan for—the time commitments, the veterinary costs, the higher fence—there are plenty of other variables. Will the new dog get along with the queen-of-the-house cat? How will he handle a rainy day indoors? Will your new cat fit in with your kids after a small adjustment period?\n\nWith this in mind, we are offering the option of a trial adoption for 1-2 weeks to qualified adopters. Our innovative program lets families spend time with one of our animals in their home to ensure a good fit for both the family and the pet before a final decision is made by the new potential owner. Pets are fully vetted and fixed before they are eligible to go home with you.\n\nWhat happens if it is not a good fit? No sweat! We will ask you to bring the pet back to our adoption room and fill out a personality profile on the pet. This way we can learn more about him or her so we can make a better match the next time. You then have the option to try again. We are committed to matching you with the right pet for you and your household.\n\nCommonly asked questions:\n\nHow do I qualify to adopt an animal?\n\nWe ask that you fill out a short adoption questionnaire before meeting with an adoptable pet. Our team will use your answers to assist you in finding a good match for you and your family.\n\nAre we allowed to adopt if we have children?\n\nAbsolutely! We do not have any blanket restrictions on families with kids adopting. We that being said, their will sometimes be specific cats or dogs that we know would be best in a home without children. This is based on a behavior assessment of the animal and their previous history. In these rare cases, it will be indicated on the pet’s adoption card on their kennel.\n\nCan I try out an animal in my home before I make a final decision?\n\nYES! We offer the option of a trial adoption for 1-2 weeks to qualified adopters. Our innovative program lets families spend time with one of our animals in their home to ensure a good fit for both the family and the pet before a final decision is made by the new potential owner. Pets are fully vetted and fixed before they are eligible to go home with you.\n\nCan you tell us if one of your dogs does well with cats?\n\nIf we have a known history on the dog, we will definitely answer this question to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, we are unable to do a cat to dog test in the shelter for both safety reasons and to be fair to our shelter cats. However, please see above where we talk about trial adoptions.\n\nCan you tell us if one of your dogs does well with other dogs?\n\nYes, we can but we also recommend that you bring your personal dog in to meet the dog you are interested in adopting. We have found that every dog is an individual and sometime two dogs do not match well even if neither has any behavior challenges.\n\nAre you going to deny me for adoption based on the way I look or talk?\n\nABSOLUTELY NOT! We are not here to judge you in any way. We are here to match animals that need love to humans that also need love and companionship. End of story. Your appearance, race, (human) partner preference, or family background makes no difference to the animal that you have come to adopt."
