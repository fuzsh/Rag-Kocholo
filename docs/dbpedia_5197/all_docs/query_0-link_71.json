        "text": "We begrudgingly left Daniel’s Bay to head back to Taihoe Bay. It was a quick hour motor back to the main anchorage where we secured a spot near the west end of the bay close to the small resort. We had a “changing of the guards” so to speak where Wayne would be leaving us in a few days and Shawn and Sharon were coming on board in Nuku Hiva. Both Shawn and Sharon are big runners so we planned several hikes during their visit.\n\nAfter the Melnar’s arrived, we headed back to the boat to begin celebrating their arrival. It was a fabulous evening of good friends, cold drinks, and tasty food. It’s been awhile since all 5 of us were together and it felt glorious!\n\nBon Voyage Wayne!\n\nThe next day we dropped Wayne off at the taxi and said our sad goodbyes. Since, we were already on shore we decided to do the hike to Collette’s Bay. We were able to walk Shawn and Sharon through town, the artisan market, and fresh produce market along the way.\n\nWe also swung by the beautiful Nuku Hiva Catholic church which has some amazing wood and stone carvings.\n\nHIKE TO COLETTE’S BAY\n\nOur “late start” of 1130 meant it was hot, hot, hot during our walk. The first 1.5 miles of the “hike” is a walk down the road. Then the road disappears and it becomes a dirt path. The trail is well marked and easy to follow. The last 1-1.5 miles is up hill until you reach the beach shores.\n\nWe enjoyed a few hours in the water before heading back. A little piece of paradise hidden in Nuku Hiva.\n\nOf course, Matt had to be part of the photo shoot\n\nHike total distance 5.8 miles, 14,243 steps, and 22 floors climbed.\n\nCONTROLLER’S BAY\n\nA short, but uncomfortable motor from Taihoe Bay to Hakahaa Bay (Controller’s Bay) was into the wind and waves. We decided to leave early while it was a little calmer, but still encountered 2-meter seas. Luckily Shawn and Sharon weathered through it and we arrived without incidence.\n\nController’s Bay has three “lobes” or bays where you can anchor. Most people anchor in the middle one because it is bigger, has good holding, and is where the village is located. The village consists of three small magasins, a medical center, post office, artisan center, and a church. This is the main community area, artisan market, and performance area during festivals.\n\nWe had heard that there is a pretty waterfall hike in Controller’s Bay. Of course, we did not have directions and the location was not clearly explained in the compendium (cruiser information sharing document we use). It was not on maps.me or any of our other map apps. Well, how hard can it be to find a waterfall?\n\nThe Elusive Waterfall\n\nWe started down the one road and headed toward the mountains. Surprisingly, it was a nice paved road through “town” and toward what we thought was the path to the waterfall. The hike was supposed to be 2-hours, but we did not know if it was 2-hours each way or round trip.\n\nAfter walking down the road for about 90 minutes, we spotted a waterfall. We all hoped it was not the waterfall we were supposed to be heading to as it was really far away (top photo below).\n\nMatt and Sharon decided to head back shortly after spotting the waterfall. Shawn and I decided to continue on to the “waterfall overlook.” Probably not the smartest decision. Shawn is recovering (nicely) from knee surgery late last year and I was in flip flops.\n\nAnother 2 miles later and about ¾ of a mile from our waypoint, a small vehicle came up the road. I stuck my thumb out hoping for a ride. They stopped and wouldn’t you know it they recognized my Sugar Shack hat. We climbed in the back of their little truck and they took us to where maps.me indicated a lookout was located. Nice view, but not lookout and no waterfall. We had gone from 600’ elevation to 1200’ elevation and had already hiked 4.5 miles. Top photo is the original waterfall and bottom photo is the “lookout” view of no waterfall (bottom photo below).\n\nWorn Out\n\nWe were both tired and ill prepared, but continued on back towards town. By the time we got to town, we had no money, out of water, and had a few blisters to show for our 9-mile hike. Again, probably not the best decision, but an interesting adventure. We did come across a heard of baby piglets which were cute.\n\nHike total distance was 8.9 miles, 20,546 steps, and 61 floors climbed (1/4 mile assisted by a truck).\n\nA Reprieve for us all\n\nOnce back on the boat, we headed for a little sandy islet where we hung out in the water and rested our weary bones. Shawn found the energy to paddle over, but Matt drove Sharon and I in the dinghy – thank goodness.\n\nDid you read our last post about Daniel’s Bay and our hikes there?\n\nComing up next:\n\nWe explore Anaho bay together. Located on the north coast of Nuku Hiva."
