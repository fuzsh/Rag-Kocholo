Wander the black sand beaches, marvel at the giant tiki at Piki Vehini, or get adventurous on an all-terrain vehicle excursion around the craggy island. Explore the Taipival valley, one of the richest archeological sites in the Marquesas Islands, made famous by the American writer and former sailor, Herman Melville, who deserted his ship and hid in this valley."
