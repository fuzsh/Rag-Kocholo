        "text": "May 8-15, 2015 – by Anne – NUKU HIVA HO! – THE MARQUISES ARCHIPELAGO, FRENCH POLYNESIA\n\nTo ocean sailors, sighting land can be one of the most exciting, welcomed, comforting experiences of all. Land ho!, we yell when we first set sight of land, even if it isn’t our intended destination. And when we spotted our intended port of call after 40 days at sea, we yelled, “Nuku Hiva ho!” We saw it under tropical cumulus clouds, so typical of the aerial formation above high volcanic islands in the oceans of the world.\n\nThis exotic volcanic tropical island of Nuku Hiva is the home of some of the friendliest people we’ve ever met in the world! Immediately after anchoring Joyful in Taiohae Bay, formed from an ancient volcano, before we did anything else, we said a prayer to the Lord for giving us His hedge of protection all these 40 days days at sea from Panama, allowing us to arrive unharmed at Nuku Hiva. We marveled at the sight of land after sailing on the open South Pacific Ocean for over a month! We kept on saying, “Look over there at that tree! Look at those houses! Look! There are people” The myriad shades of greens from the mountains, the ever changing colors of blue from the sea around Joyful at anchor, and the amazing hues of pinks, oranges, and purples from the sky cast upon the island at sunset, to us, were mesmerizing.\n\nThat night, and every night since, while at anchor, I have slept in Joyful’s cockpit in order to enjoy the cool sea breeze, gaze upon the starry sky, hear the music, drum beats, and singing from the land, and to breathe in the fragrances from the tropical flowers, trees, and mountains! At day break I awoke by the sound of roosters‘ crowing, followed by the extraordinary sunrise over the land. I wish each of you could experience this way of being so close to nature. So if your schedule won’t permit you to go camping or to the beach, I recommend you try sleeping outside in your garden, balcony, or patio to experience similar delights!\n\nThe next day, we took Joyful’s dinghy (inflatable tender with a 6 hp engine) ashore. The first person we encountered was truly an angel from above in the form of a strong, friendly local Polynesian man, who reached out to hold the dinghy’s line and to offer me a hand to help me up the slick, rock steps leading to the land. People speak Marquisan and French here, and I was able to resurrect the amount of French I learned in school, you know, back in the Pleistocene Era.\n\nDuring the next day, at the same location, another very kind local Polynesian man was on the dock near our dinghy, and offered assistance, while I spoke with his friendly wife. She didn’t speak much French, but primarily the Nuku Hivan dialect of Marquisan, and told me to meet her there the next morning so she could give us grapefruit from her trees! So I did, and she gave us about 17 perfect pamplemousse, the delicious Polynesian variety of grapefruit. I gave her a Swiss handkerchief with a hand embroidered heart of flowers on one corner, and some cards with verses from the Bible relating to loving your neighbor as yourself, as Jesus commanded, and a card with John 3:16 on one side.\n\nAlmost every day there in Nuku Hiva we spent some time with a wonderful man and new friend named Emmanuel, and another wonderful new friend, his sister, Conchita. When I saw a doctor to examine my big toe, which was recovering from surgery since the day before we entered the Panama Canal, he took me to the hospital to help translate. The kind hearts of these two Nuku Hivans we will always remember with fondness. Every once in a while I meet someone who influences my life in such a positive way, that I wish to incorporate certain aspects of their character into my own. Emmanuel is one of those people! Thank you, Emmanuel! Thank you, Conchita, for your kindheartedness in giving us delicious bananas, limes, and pamplemousse from your garden, and for your farewell present of gorgeous leis you made from flowers from your garden. We shall always remember you with fondness, too!\n\nEDUCATIONAL PROGRAM:\n\nEmmanuel graciously organized two Skype sessions between two local schools and one of Joyful’s schools, the Round Hill Elementary School of Round Hill, Virginia. So, one fine morning, students from the C.E.D. St. Joseph school of agriculture, and the St. Joseph Primary and Elementary school, a private Catholic school, both in the village, met us for a Skype session. Students, the principal, and teachers from those schools connected over the internet via Skype, to students from Mr. Muldowney’s 5th grade science class at Round Hill Elementary School, as well as with Mr. Andrew Davis, the principal, and Mr. Muldowney. All these participants of the Skype sessions communicated in a combination of English, French, and Marquisan languages. The students discussed issues concerning the status and care of the oceans, recycling, ecology, culture, and other topics. Everyone had a worthwhile, memorable experience with these Skype sessions. This was the first time students from the St. Joseph Elementary School had experienced Skype sessions, and both of the schools from Nuku Hiva, and the Round Hill School, look forward to further communications, either by the mail or via Skype.\n\nSCIENCE:\n\nSecchi Disk –\n\nUnfortunately, there was again too much rapid movement of water in the volcanic anchorage at Nuku Hiva for phytoplankton data gathering via the Secchi disk to take place.\n\nBird Sightings –\n\nWe took photos of a few birds while at Nuku Hiva for Cornell University’s Department of Ornithology’s study of the migrations of birds from all over the world. Most of the birds flew off before we could photograph them!\n\nDosimeter –\n\nWe continued our daily dosimeter readings while in Nuku Hiva. The readings were all between 8 and 15 counts per minute (CPM).\n\nMISSION JOYFUL:\n\nJeff and I met with the Bishop of the church in the village where we gave a donation toward the translation and printing of the Holy Bible in the Marquisan language. Our cousins, Chip and Lois, also kindly made a donation toward this endeavor. I was able to share ideas on Art ministry with another artist and other people who were also cruising around the world on their boats. There are so many possibilities to share the Word everywhere one goes, and I thank the Lord for presenting opportunities to us!\n\nArtistic Inspirations from the Lord About this Landfall –\n\nBy far, to me, the most remarkable aspect of this gorgeous landfall of Nuku Hiva was the genuine friendliness, good hearted nature, and compassionate attitude of the people. Throughout the days Joyful was in Nuku Hiva, the islanders demonstrated their obedience to Jesus’ most important commandment, as expressed in Matthew 22:37-40 “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”\n\nDEPARTURE FROM NUKU HIVA:\n\nEven though we did not want to leave the enchanted island of Nuku Hiva, or Emmanuel, Conchita, and the other friendly and gracious locals, Jeff, Bill, and I also wanted to catch up with the rest of the Blue Planet Odyssey fleet in Bora Bora in order to continue the circumnavigation together. So after clearing out of Nuku Hiva, we weighed Joyful’s anchor and sailed away bound for Bora Bora, stocked with presents from Emmanuel, Conchita, and other fine locals, the most important being their friendship."
