        "text": "Cruising around the islands of the South Pacific is a once-in-a-lifetime trip for many travelers. While some of the island nations, like Fiji, are well known to Americans, others, like Niue, are less familiar. A South Pacific cruise promises cultural experiences, beautiful landscapes and plenty of water-based activities.\n\nYou can find South Pacific itineraries on luxury, expedition and even big-ship cruise lines. Some ships sail from Hawaii to Australia with island visits throughout the South Pacific, or offer weeklong cruises from Australia to a handful of the nearest South Pacific islands like Vanuatu. Cruisers looking to dive deep into the rich history and culture of the South Pacific might want to consider some of the smaller luxury lines that depart from the islands themselves; Papeete, Tahiti, in French Polynesia is a common port of embarkation.\n\nSouth Pacific cruises are often the domain of retirees and honeymooners, but South Pacific cruises can be a fulfilling trip with kids or as a multigenerational vacation.\n\nHere are the nine best South Pacific cruises for your next vacation.\n\nSilversea Cruises' 11- to 13-night Tahiti cruises\n\nSilversea Cruises offers a variety of South Pacific cruises that span nine to 19 nights, but the most popular options are the 11- to 13-night round-trip sailings from Papeete, Tahiti. In 2025, Silver Shadow will call on ports like Nuku Hiva and Atuona in the Marquesas Islands, Bora Bora and Moorea. Cruisers can enjoy hikes and marvel at waterfalls at Nuku Hiva, while Moorea is known for its ocean activities like snorkeling or sunbathing at picturesque beaches.\n\nThe cruise line offers two types of inclusive fares. The port-to-port fares include all food and drinks onboard, butler service, gratuities and shore excursions. This package does not include flights or airport transfers. The door-to-door fare package includes roundtrip flights, airport transfers, a precruise hotel, all food and drinks onboard, shore excursions, butler service and gratuities. Additionally, postcruise hotel and airport transfers are included.\n\nWho should go: Silversea is known for luxury ships that cater to retirees. Silver Shadow features gourmet dining at several specialty restaurants, including the French La Dame and Italian La Terrazza. By day, gaze at the ocean from a light-filled lounge while enjoying a complimentary cocktail; by night, find your luck at the ship's small casino.\n\nIntuitive service is a Silversea hallmark. The ship has a nearly one-to-one ratio of crew to guests, and a butler attends every suite.\n\nFares: From $8,900 per person, based on double occupancy\n\nRelated: 5 fabulous destinations for luxury cruise fans\n\nWindstar Cruises' 14-night Tahitian Treasures and Magnificent Marquesas cruise\n\nWindstar Cruises is an industry leader in cruises around Tahiti. The brand has been sailing the islands for more than 35 years and now offers year-round sailings on Star Breeze. (The line will soon have two ships based in the region.)\n\nWhile its staple itinerary is the seven-night Dreams of Tahiti sailing, the all-suite 312-passenger ship is starting a new 14-night route this year that takes cruisers to multiple islands in the Marquesas, Bora Bora (two-day stop), Moorea, Motu Mahaea (a private island off Tahaa), Rangiroa and Fakarava, with multiple days at sea sprinkled in. The 14-night sailing is limited, with just two departures in 2024 and three in 2025.\n\nWith an overnight in Bora Bora, you can try everything from an exhilarating tank dive or scuba excursion to a relaxing lagoon tour. Those looking for a bit of romance can book a night at one of the island's many over-water bungalow resorts.\n\nWho should go: This itinerary would be ideal for adventurous couples looking to celebrate a major life event like a birthday or anniversary. Star Breeze recently underwent a massive renovation to add two new restaurants featuring Spanish cuisine and barbecue, an upgraded spa with steam and sauna rooms, an infinity pool and a larger fitness area. Each suite has all-new bathrooms, and the ship's smallest suites are quite large by cruise standards at 277 square feet.\n\nFares: From $6,899 per person based on double occupancy\n\nRelated: The 5 best destinations you can visit on a Windstar Cruises ship\n\nAzamara's 15-night South Pacific Jewels cruise\n\nAzamara's 15-night South Pacific Jewels cruise is taking place only once in 2025, with embarkation on Jan. 24. On this sailing, Azamara Onward will take guests to islands across French Polynesia, American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, with a final destination of New Zealand.\n\nIn Apia, Samoa, you can venture into the vibrant jungle to find hidden swimming holes, while Tonga will lure you into the ocean with incredible snorkeling around coral reefs. In Bay of Islands, New Zealand, join an excursion that takes you right into the heart of a cave system to see glowworms.\n\nWho should go: Travelers looking for adventure off the ship, extended port times and a relaxed onboard ambience will love this cruise. While small, the 684-passenger ship features seven restaurants and cafes, a pool and a spa. All gratuities, both nonalcoholic and specific alcoholic beverages and self-service laundry are included in Azamara's base fares. A hallmark of the line is complimentary cultural evening events that take place once a cruise, either on the ship or in port.\n\nFares: From $4,500 per person based on double occupancy\n\nNational Geographic Expeditions' 9-night Pearls of the Pacific voyage\n\nTravelers looking for a deep dive into the history and culture of the South Pacific should look no further than the 9-night Pearls of the Pacific Voyage to the Society and Tuamotu Islands from National Geographic Expeditions. The 102-passenger National Geographic Orion has exceptional maneuverability, so it can sail through shallow water, bays and small rivers. The two 2025 sailings depart on Jan. 29 and Feb. 28.\n\nThe cruise starts and ends in Papeete, Tahiti. Guests will first sail to the Tuamotu Archipelago where you can snorkel with reef sharks. In Fakarava, you can learn about pearl farming, while in Taha'a, you can explore a vanilla bean farm.\n\nActive travelers will enjoy diving into Bora Bora's crystal clear waters or hiking through a pineapple plantation in Moorea. Raiatea is where you'll visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Marae Taputapuatea, where Polynesian seafarers would begin their journeys. A photography instructor, undersea specialist and National Geographic expert well-versed in the region and its culture will accompany the group on this voyage.\n\nWho should go: National Geographic Expeditions is less about the onboard experience and more about exploring and understanding the destination you're visiting. The ships have all of the basics, like a restaurant and communal lounge, but lack the specialty restaurants and butler service of the luxury cruise lines.\n\nNational Geographic Orion was built for function rather than style. On board, you'll find a mud room with lockers for expedition gear and a fleet of rigid inflatable Zodiac boats that transfer guests from ship to shore. Everything from meals and excursions to alcohol and gratuities is included in the price.\n\nFares: From $10,910 per person based on double occupancy\n\nRelated: Expedition cruises: The ultimate guide to cruising to remote, hard-to-reach places\n\nRegent Seven Seas Cruises' 16-night Vibrant Fiji & Polynesian Magic cruise\n\nThose who are looking to live in the lap of luxury and can plan a cruise a year and a half in advance will want to consider Regent Seven Seas Cruises' 16-night Vibrant Fiji & Polynesian Magic sailing aboard Seven Seas Navigator.

The outdoor pool and sports deck are great spots to take in the view of the ocean.\n\nOceania Cruises is known for its food, and the ship has an abundance of dining options for a smaller vessel. While the main dining room is your default for dinner, the specialty restaurants are really the star here. Toscana highlights regional Italian cuisine, while Polo Grill dishes out dry-aged steaks and tableside Caesar salads.\n\nFares: From $2,999 per person, based on double occupancy\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line's 14-night South Pacific cruise\n\nHead to the South Pacific from Hawaii on Norwegian Cruise Line's 14-night South Pacific cruise that starts in Honolulu and ends in the capital of French Polynesia — Papeete, Tahiti.
