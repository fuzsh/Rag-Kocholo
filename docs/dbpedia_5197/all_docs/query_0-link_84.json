        "text": "February 17, 2019\n\nNUKU HIVA ISLAND, French Polynesia – I enjoyed a challenging two-hour snorkel swim this afternoon during our second day here in the remote Marquesas Islands. After a gorgeous sail-away and sunset, Mom and I experienced fine French dining at Oceania Marina’s Jacques specialty restaurant as we began the long voyage to the Tuamotu Islands.\n\nGot up at 12:54 p.m. Ate lunch at the buffet and then got ready to go to the beach. Yesterday I had the best day so far on our cruise around French Polynesia with an outstanding hike to a viewpoint overlooking a gorgeous bay. Today I wanted to get in the water.\n\nDisembarked Oceania Marina at 2:38 and walked about 20 minutes to a beach southeast of the island’s main town, Taiohae. Taiohae is located at the edge of an ancient volcanic crater that collapsed into the sea, forming Taiohae Bay.\n\nOnce again we had a beautiful day here with brilliant sunshine and blue sky. The beach isn’t anything to write home about – just a thin strip of sand next to a dirt road. But I wasn’t there for the sand; I came for the water.\n\nWaded in a bit after 3 p.m. and went on a 2-hour-long arduous snorkel and swim along the coast, viewing fish but having to battle a strong current.\n\nNuku Hiva, 127 square miles (a bit less than twice the size of the District of Columbia) is the second largest landmass in French Polynesia after Tahiti. It has a population of 3,150.\n\n“Among the first islands to be settled by the Polynesians during the great South Pacific migrations, the Marquesas served as a dispersal point for the whole Polynesian triangle from Hawaii to Easter Island and New Zealand,” according to Lonely Planet. “Upon contact with Western influences, the foundations of Marquesan society collapsed. Whaling crews brought alcohol, firearms, and syphilis. The population plummeted from around 18,000 in 1842 to 2,096 in 1926.”\n\nWalked back to the pier after my long snorkel swim, where I was the only passenger on the last tender back to Oceania Marina at 5:30.\n\nJoined Mom on our balcony to watch sail away and a wonderful sunset while sorting and posting today’s photos.\n\nWe’ll be at see all day tomorrow as we voyage 618 miles to Fakarava Atoll in the Tuamotu Islands.\n\nFrench Polynesia is the largest grouping of islands in the world when measured by total sea area, according to Oceana Cruises’ Currents newsletter. The islands spread out over 2.12 million square miles (5.5 million square km), equivalent to the land area of Europe!\n\nShowered, organized my laundry, and worked on blog photos. Mom and I then headed to the Jacques French specialty restaurant for a late dinner at 9 p.m.\n\nThe menu was incredibly extensive with choices of nine courses plus sauces and side dishes. Oh my goodness!\n\nI enjoyed a shrimp-and-rice appetizer followed by a main course of bouillabaisse (Mediterranean fish and lobster stew with saffron broth and rouille sauce).\n\nNext I had a selection of cheeses and crackers from the trolley.\n\nThen came a dessert of sorbets.\n\nBack to our cabin to work on various tasks. We had a 30-minute backward time change from 1:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. to return to French Polynesia Time (GMT-10) from Marquesas Islands Time (GMT-9:30). Fell asleep about 2:20 a.m. FPT.\n\nPhoto Gallery"
