        "text": "At 2200Z (1600 Local – Mountain Time) on April 27, 2016 I was standing watch and noticed a large object off of my port bow, approximately 100 yards in the distance. I notified Melissa (co-Captain), that I saw what appears to be a raft and I was changing course to investigate. I had all three sails up (Main, Stay and Jib) and turned to port to get a closer look. As we approached, I asked Melissa to get the Man Overboard pole to grab anything so we could get a closer look. As we approached at around 1 – 2 knots, we tried to grab a large rope that was attached to a round dome shaped “EPIRB” looking device. This device was approximately 18” – 20” round with a dome type Plexiglas cover that encapsulated a mini (5” x 5”) solar panel on the interior (still dry but unknown if working). The word, “Emily” (or partially Emily”) and the numbers (I think) “1510” were hand painted in greenish blue paint on the Plexiglas, along the bottom curve. There was another word, written at the top of the Plexiglas but I do not recall what that word was. The Plexiglas was dingy and showed signs of extreme weathering.\n\nThe Dome (I will call it from now on) was attached to the raft (in-depth description later) via a thick 1” rope that was approximately 15’ from the raft. As we tried to grapple the rope attached to the Dome, the weight (of the raft) and the lack of slack to the Dome was too much to bear and we could not hold on to the MOB pole. It slipped from our grasp and went overboard.\n\nAt this time I knew for a fact that this was a home-made “survival” type raft made from miscellaneous debris and other items.\n\nDue to the nature of the object, I knew we had to go back for a closer look. I pulled in the Jib to reduce sail and my mainsail was already double-reefed due to the weather (another squall was approaching – about 1 mile from us at this time).\n\nWe looped back around and I asked my wife to get pictures for documentation. As we approached the 2nd time, I noticed that my fishing line was out, so I started to reel it in. I got the line in about ½ way and “Tug – Snap!” something big bit right through my 150 lb test leader. A shark perhaps, since it happened so fast and it was a clean cut right through the leader.\n\nOn the 2nd approach we pulled slowly up to the raft and got a much better look. My MOB pole was bobbing right next to the Dome and I lay down on my starboard deck and reached over and grabbed it and placed it back on my deck. I then, reached down and grabbed the rope that was holding the Dome to the raft and tried to pull the Dome up on deck. The weight of the Dome and the raft were too much, once again, for me to hold on to and I had to let it go. There were numerous barnacles attached to the rope and the underside of the Dome.\n\nDue to the weight, size and sheer density of the raft, we could not safely approach the raft for a third time, as the squall was now 100 yards away and approaching fast. We did not want to endanger our lives or vessel any more than necessary.\n\nWe noted the time, now 2240Z (1640 Mountain Time) and the coordinates Latitude 07 degrees 45.930 Minutes North, Longitude 123 degrees 46.773 Minutes West\n\nWe looked for anything that would signify that the survivor was still around or any signs of recent activity and found none. There was a very large population of fish, large and small, all around the raft, which may signify that it had been afloat for a long time. As we approached the 1st time, there was a bird sitting on the raft. There appeared to be no personal affects or persons near the raft and no other debris in the vicinity. The raft seemed to have been in the water for a very long time, as the wood looked weathered and sinking (listing) slowly.\n\nLooking down on the raft from my vessel, it appeared that I was looking at the “bottom” of the raft, due to the construction of the raft. The raft may have flipped upside down shortly after being underway, as there was not a lot of growth on the area I could see (the bottom of the raft). I believe it was the bottom of the raft because it was constructed with six (6) pieces of Styrofoam flotsam lashed down in an even formation (4 pieces in the middle and 1 on each end). There were five (5) 6” x 4’ round horizontal crossbeams lashed down to what appeared (couldn’t see underwater) five (5) other pieces (8’ to 10’ lengthwise) of the same type of wood. At first, I thought all the wood were pieces of bamboo, however, on closer inspection of the pictures, they appear that they may be from a wood mast and/or boom. The appearance is straight smooth and one of the crossbeams looked like it “cracked” or was broken, while all the other ends were sawed smooth via a saw or similar cutting device. All lashings were what appeared to be ¼” black cordage, 1/2” blue line, 1” thick black braided line and miscellaneous other line. The vessel was well made and still intact but possibly upside down.\n\nDue to the extensive barnacle growth on the Dome and Dome line, I’m assuming the underwater portion of the raft (the deck) would be covered with the same amount of barnacle growth.\n\nWe will submit the pictures we have taken, once we make landfall in Hiva Oa, Marquesas, approximately May, 10, 2016.\n\nI am a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard and have logged approximately 15,000 ocean miles aboard USCGC Jarvis, in 1986-87. While onboard, I was trained to keep a constant vigil while on watch and due to my training I had to investigate this scene and note all I could, as someone’s life may have depended on it. In my personal opinion, I am hopeful that the victim who built the raft was rescued months ago and the rescuers left the raft afloat, as it was too large to destroy or bring aboard. If the victim was not rescued months ago, I regret to say that he (or she) may have perished at sea some time ago. Due to the location (approximately 1,000 nautical miles from the nearest land mass – Clipperton Island) I would have to assume the raft had been at sea for quite a while.\n\nI want more than anything to find the survivor and say that I found his raft still afloat, however, if that is not the case, hopefully we can bring some closure to his (or her) family.\n\nPlease keep us in the loop if you find anything on the survivor/raft builder as we would like closure too.\n\nMichael & Melissa Harlow\n\nS/V Harlow Hut\n\nIsland Packet 37\n\nFOLLOW UP FROM US COAST GUARD AND LATITUDE 38 MAGAZINE (paraphrased): There are no craft with the name Emily or partially named Emily reported missing or overdue near that location. It appears you may have found a FAD or Fish Attraction Device. Many long-range fishing vessels (most notably Chilean fishermen) make these types of rafts and leave them out at sea to attract fish. They use the EPRIB type beacon you described to locate the raft. Fish congregate around the device and this enhances the odds of the fishermen catching more fish."
