        "text": "Today’s artisans in Atuona excel in creating intricate works from wood and bone, continuing a rich tradition of craftsmanship. This charming village is also notable for being the place where two world-famous artists, Jacques Brel and Paul Gauguin, left their indelible marks.\n\nWhat makes it so special\n\nWhy visit Hiva Oa?\n\nThe island that inspired Brel and Gauguin\n\nLocated northeast of Tahiti, Hiva Oa is one of the largest islands in the Marquesas archipelago. The village of Atuona, with its black sand bay, is the final resting place of two world-famous artists: painter Paul Gauguin and singer Jacques Brel.\n\nVisitors can pay their respects at their graves, situated on the high ground above the village. Atuona also features a cultural center dedicated to Paul Gauguin and the Espace Jacques Brel museum, where you can see the small plane that once belonged to Brel.\n\nIn the Footsteps of Gauguin and Brel in Hiva Oa\n\nA rich and vibrant culture\n\nBrel and Gauguin’s names are forever associated with the island, but the true spirit of Hiva Oa lies in the valleys of Taaoa and Puamau. Opposite the village of Atuona, a mountain road winds to the valley of Puamau, home to the impressive archaeological site of Lipona.\n\nThis site is famed for its tiki, with the tallest standing at 2.57 meters. To the west of Atuona, the expansive archaeological site of Upeke is located in the valley of Taaoa, offering further insights into the island’s rich history and culture.\n\nThe Tiki of Taaoa and the Upeke Archeological Site\n\n« I am beginning to think simply, to feel only very little hatred for my neighbour— or rather, to love him. All the joys—animal and human—of a free life are mine. I have escaped that which is artificial, I am entering into the truth, into nature. »\n\nPaul Gauguin, from ‘Noa Noa; Voyage to Tahiti\n\nDiving in the Marquesas Islands\n\nExperience a cultural encounter\n\nDiscover\n\nNot-to-be-missed\n\nWhat to do in Hiva Oa?\n\nHiva Oa’s mountainous terrain offers several hiking trails that lead to magnificient scenic viewpoints. It’s best to explore the island with a guide, who can share the fascinating myths and legends associated with various sites. For a more relaxed day, head to Tahuata Island, just a few minutes by boat southeast of Hiva Oa. Unlike the motus of Bora Bora or Moorea, Tahuata boasts magnificent, deserted white sandy beaches that are equally stunning.\n\nSuggested itinerary\n\nFour days in Hiva Oa\n\nKnown as the Garden of the Marquesas Islands due to its lush vegetation, Hiva Oa features rugged mountains, steep cliffs, and a mix of black and white sand beaches. It’s a pilgrimage destination for admirers of the artist Paul Gauguin and the singer Jacques Brel, both of whom are buried in the local cemetery. The island also vaunts significant archaeological interest, with several tiki, paepae, and other remnants of its ancient civilisation. Discover these wonders on our suggested four-day itinerary for exploring Hiva Oa.\n\nDiscover\n\nBe inspired\n\nExperiences\n\nDiscover why artist Paul Gauguin fell in love with The Islands of Tahiti and explore the inspiration behind Jacques Brel’s song “Gémir n’est pas de mise aux Marquises” (“The Marquesas Islands is no place for whining”).
