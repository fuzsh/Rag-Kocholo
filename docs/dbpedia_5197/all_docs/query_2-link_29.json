        "text": "As you might already know by now, we are smitten by French Polynesia, it truly is our favorite destination in the world and with 118 islands to explore, we cant help ourselves going back year after year. This time we visited the mystical island of Nuku Hiva, located in the Marquesas in French Polynesia.\n\nThe Marquesas Islands are a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia and are known for their rugged, mountainous landscapes, rich history, and cultural significance. The Marquesas are somewhat remote compared to other tourist-frequented Polynesian islands such as Tahiti or Bora Bora, offering a unique and relatively untouched glimpse into Polynesian culture and natural beauty. They also have their own unique culture and language which is so fascinating!\n\nAbout Le Nuku Hiva and getting here :\n\nLe Nuku Hiva by Pearl Resorts is undoubtedly the best place to stay in all of Nuku Hiva. It is a Relais and Chateaux property as well. The resort is located cliffside facing the stunning Taiohae bay and at a convenient location perfect for exploring the island. The Lodge experience aims to be authentic, laid-back, in harmony with the Marquesan life philosophy.\n\nPearl Resorts are our favorite Polynesian based luxury hospitality brand and we have stayed at every resort of theirs so far – le Tahiti, le Bora Bora, Le Tikehau, Le Taha’a and now Le Nuku Hiva. We especially love them as they have a unique blend of traditional Polynesian hospitality and modern luxury, providing a high-end yet authentic experience for visitors.\n\nAir Moana and Air Tahiti both have a direct 3 hour flight from Papeete to the Marquesas and flies to both Hiva Ova and Nuku Hiva. When you arrive in Nuku Hiva, your arranged hotel transfer will pick you up for a scenic one hour drive to the resort.\n\nStay :\n\nThe hotel has 20 Polynesian bungalows that are all set within a lush tropical landscape, perched cliff side with sweeping views of the mountains and Taiohae Bay. These bungalows are built in traditional Marquesan style, featuring local wood and decorative elements, which create a rustic yet comfortable atmosphere.\n\nEach attentively decorated bungalow combines modern comfort and local materials, sculpted or embellished by Marquesan artists. We had a one bedroom bay view bungalow , which had a spacious bedroom, clean bathroom and stunning deck area with mesmerizing views of the mountains and the bay.\n\nIn and around our Bungalow\n\nMost epic views from our deck\n\nAround the property :\n\nSet on the hillside, in a lush tropical garden, Le Nuku Hiva by Pearl Resorts offers an unobstructed view of Taiohae Bay. Since its cliffside the bungalows and main buildings are all on different terraces.\n\nThe property grounds are so lush and the views will never cease to take your breath away at every little corner.\n\nLush property grounds\n\nThere is an infinity pool area right near the restaurant area which was my favorite spot to catch the sunrise!\n\nThey also have direct access to the beach below. We absolutely loved strolling along Taiohae Bay everyday.\n\nDining :\n\nIf you stay at Le Nuku Hiva, I highly recommend doing one of their package options, which takes care of your stay, half board meals and activities too. There really aren’t too many places to eat on the island unlike other popular islands, so having breakfast and dinner taken care of is perfect. Nuku Hiva is a place where you will most likely be out and about during the day, so you can plan for lunch out on the tour or a packed lunch from the hotel.\n\nThe main restaurant at Le Nuku Hiva has a beautiful indoor outdoor space with views all around. Like all our other Pearl resort experiences, food was so good! We loved the fruit and local specialities like Poisson Cru for our daily breakfasts. Dinners were excellent too, we especially enjoyed the Marquesan island night, where we tried many different local delicacies, all while enjoying Marquesan music and dance.\n\nActivities :\n\nAs mentioned, we did one of their package options, which takes care of your stay, half board meals and activities too. Nuku Hiva isn’t an island we were comfortable driving on our own since the roads are super mountainous. As part of the package, for tours you get a guide/driver and 4×4 vehicle too which is so convenient.\n\nYou can also choose to do the excursions separately without the package and they have tons of half and full day options. Excursions range from hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding to cultural visits, island tours and more.\n\nFrom our 3 day stay in Nuku Hiva, here is a quick list of the must do things in Nuku Hiva :\n\nTaiohae\n\nTaiohae is a pretty, small seaside town. It is the administrative, economic and educational center of the Marquesas Islands, with French and Polynesian administrations, police, post office, hospital, city hall, Air Tahiti agency, bank, schools and a few shops. Must see sites include the Notre Dame Cathedral, Tohua Temehea and Tohua Koueva.\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral at Taiohae\n\nThe Marquesan culture is prominently preserved and celebrated in Nuku Hiva. The island is famous for its archaeological sites, particularly the ancient stone tikis, petroglyphs, and tohua (ceremonial platforms), which are scattered throughout the island. These sites provide insight into the rich history and complex social structures of the ancient Marquesans.\n\nTohua Temehea (above) and Tohua Koueva (below)\n\nRoadtrip around the island\n\nGo on a roadtrip around the island and take it all the beautiful views – Aakapa bay is my favorite viewpoint! If you do a full day island tour with the resort they will take you to all the best scenic spots.\n\nBreathtaking views roadtripping around the island\n\nHatiheu Bay\n\nMost of the islanders live in the three main villages : Taiohae, Taipivai and Hatiheu. The most iconic beach of Nuku Hiva is undoubtedly Hatiheu Bay a dark sand beach framed with the towering knife edge ridges of the mountains behind. It is truly so mystical and magical in every way, one can absolutely feel the mana in this ethereal place.\n\nThe valley of Hatiheu is in the north-west of the island. It is a mystical place, with a troubled past, rich in archeological remains. It is one of the most important archeological sites in the Marquesas Islands, with paepae (stone platforms), tiki, me’ae (religious sites) and numerous petroglyphs etched into the rocks.\n\nIn and around Hatiheu\n\nGo Hiking or Horseback riding\n\nMany bays are only accessible by hiking, on a horseback ride or by boat ! Nuku Hiva has tons of hikes to explore its rugged raw terrain. Do not miss out on the Anaho bay hike or a horseback ride to Ha’atuatua bay.\n\nHike to Anaho Bay\n\nEat a traditional Marquesan meal\n\nYvonnes at Hatiheu is incredible!\n\nWatch a traditional Marquesan cultural show\n\nLe Nuku Hiva has a monthly show and this was one of my favorite evenings !\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the Marquesas offer a profoundly different experience from the more commercially developed islands of French Polynesia. They appeal to those seeking adventure, solitude, and a deep connection with nature and ancient Polynesian cultures. Nuku Hiva just gave us a flavor and I can’t wait to come back to explore more. Nuku Hiva is a destination that offers a compelling blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and historical depth, making it a unique and rewarding place to visit.\n\nLe Nuku Hiva was truly incredible and felt more than just a place to stay; it’s a destination that offers a profound connection to the spirit of the Marquesas, making it a memorable part of any visit to French Polynesia. We absolutely loved our stay here and can’t recommend it enough.\n\nThank you for stopping by!\n\nJyo\n\nThis stay was in collaboration with Le Nuku Hiva by pearl resorts but all thoughts and opinions are my own."
