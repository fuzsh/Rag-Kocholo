        "text": "Entering Hatiheu Bay, you will quickly make out the statue of the Virgin, which, standing more than 300 metres high, overlooks this beautiful little village. Located on the north of Nuku Hiva Island, this locality is dominated by impressive basalt pitons. In the past, the fear of tsunamis and attacks from other clans led the tribes to settle in the interior of the valleys. As a consequence, many archaeological sites remain preserved and make for interesting excursions. You will find many of the ceremonial plazas, called tohua, notably those of Kamuihei and Hikokua where you will be able to observe several reconstructed traditional houses."
