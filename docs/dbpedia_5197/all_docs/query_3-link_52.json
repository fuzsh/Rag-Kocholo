In later periods its caloric contribution was eclipsed by breadfruit, but irrigated taro played an important risk-reduction role.\n\nProject MUSE Mission\n\nProject MUSE promotes the creation and dissemination of essential humanities and social science resources through collaboration with libraries, publishers, and scholars worldwide. Forged from a partnership between a university press and a library, Project MUSE is a trusted part of the academic and scholarly community it serves."
