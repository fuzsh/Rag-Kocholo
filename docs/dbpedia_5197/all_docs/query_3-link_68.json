        "text": "The spectacle of culture and nature\n\nFramed by immense cliffs, the coasts alternate black sand beaches and quiet bays. Among the lush wooded landscapes, where there are thousands of pre-European structures, you can meet wild horses, goats and wild boars. Nature is raw and its charm very powerful. From the Taipivai Valley to Hatiheu Bay, the traveler can discover unique cultural and natural wonders, including the 350-meter Vaio Waterfall, the tallest waterfall in the Pacific. The Marquesans are considered the best craftsmen of Tahiti and its islands. Their art is expressed through magnificent sculptures, authentic tattoos and amazing jewelry.\n\nIn the footsteps of Melville in the Taipivai valley\n\nThis is the story of a sailor who tried to flee a boat where he was being persecuted. Secretly, he landed on an island known to be impenetrable. He wandered alone until he was welcomed by the Taipi clan, whom he took for cannibals. Not only did they treat him, but they introduced him to their unknown community. He is the first European of all time to have lived with a Marquesan tribe. It was 1842. Nowadays, you can follow in the footsteps of young Herman Melville, the author of Moby Dick, in this valley. Time seems to have stood still with its hundreds of tiki, petroglyphs and ancient sites creating the special atmosphere that the author would still recognize today.\n\nIncredible dives\n\nThe geographic isolation of the island has made it possible to develop phenomenal marine biodiversity. In the open ocean, you will find an abundance of manta rays, eagle rays, sharks of all species and of different sizes, trevallies, tuna, dolphins and swordfish. A group of electric dolphins live near the coast where it is common to meet them.\n\nIn the footsteps of Gauguin and Brel\n\nIn 1901 Paul Gauguin arrived at Hiva Oa and Jacques Brel 1975, both in search of personal inner peace. No one knows if they ever found it, but every morning, as the sun rises, the breathtaking and pure light inspires peace and rest. You will feel like you are forever, a feeling that every traveler has to experience. You will be able to follow in the footsteps of the two artists to visit their graves which are located opposite Taaoa Bay, in the Calvary cemetery, perfumed with the sweet scent of frangipani trees. You can then visit the small museum and the house where the painter lived and which is dedicated to him, you find the replica of “La maison du Jouir”. While living in the Marquesas Islands, Gauguin painted some of his most famous works of art, finding inspiration not only in the daily lives of islanders, but also in the oldest religious legends and traditions.\n\nTiki Island\n\nHiva Oa is worth a visit for its various archaeological sites such as Me’ae in Puama’u, home to the largest tiki in Tahiti And Its Islands. Called “Takaii” and measuring over two meters in height, this smiling statue is unique, partly hidden by lush vegetation. Many petroglyphs and ancient sites can be found in the surrounding area, such as a travel mirror of a female chief in polished stone. In Taaoa, a large area of ​​lithic structures and tiki statues blends into the pristine, pristine forest of giant banana trees, breadfruit trees, coconut palms and papaya trees.\n\nMany horse riding and hiking\n\nDuring a hike, a horse back ride or a 4 × 4 ride, explore the pristine and breathtaking landscapes of Hiva Oa with its waterfalls, peaks, bridges and rivers … These 319 km² of land are the delight of nature lovers.\n\nNUKU HIVA\n\nIf we were to symbolize the house of God across the Marquesas Islands, Nuku Hiva which is the largest island, would represent the upper part. Its dizzying peaks and astonishing slopes blend with the blue of the Pacific Ocean. A special universe opens its doors to you. The starting point of your adventure is Taioha’e, the regional capital of the archipelago, located at the end of a large bay of the same name. Remarkable landscapes, an incredible archaeological history, superb stories and a rich culture are all to be discovered alongside a particularly friendly population.\n\nHIVA OA\n\nAccording to legend, Hiva Oa symbolizes the “big house” of the Creator. In modern times, it has become the “garden of the Marquesas Islands” thanks to its fertile and lush land. The island is relentlessly ruled by nature, green, invasive and bright to the point that roads and houses are erased, mixed with the environment. The rugged landscapes of the island mix sharp peaks, peaks and scattered valleys with archaeological sites and ruins. Hiva Oa has the largest tiki statues in Tahiti and the Islands. With its black sand beaches shaded by mighty cliffs that plunge into the Pacific Ocean, Atuona, the island’s main village, is nestled at the end of Taaoa Bay. It is overlooked by Mount Temetiu at 1,276 meters and Mount Fe’ani at 1,016 meters. It is also the island where two famous artists have chosen to live their lives: the painter Paul Gauguin and the poet, singer and actor Jacques Brel.\n\nUA POU\n\nUa Pou is the symbol of the pillars of the entrance to the “house of the Creator”. Monumental basalt columns Poutetaunui and Poumaka, two legendary warriors flirt with the sky. In 1888, they inspired the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who compared them to two “volcanic spiers similar to a church spire”. They proudly overlook the village of Hakahau Bay, the main village on the island.\n\nUA HUKA\n\nSymbol of the “basket filled” with the Creator’s house, Ua Huka is renowned for its dry soil and its landscapes. Wild horses gallop on this desert-colored land and wild goats climb along the plains of this mystical and peaceful island. Ua Huka invites the traveler to discover an isolated and preserved universe where the ancestors are integrated into the daily life of the inhabitants.\n\nTAHUATA\n\n“Sunrise” or “the illuminating hearth”, Tahuata holds a very special and poetic place in the construction of the Creator’s house. Accessible by sea, the island is a haven of discovery for the privileged traveler who visits him. Fertile valleys rub shoulders with crystal clear bays, this place of history and creativity is an exquisite and soothing paradise. Most of the locals live by simply remarkable crafts, such as pieces carved from bones or pink wood called miro (Thespesia populnea). Mono’i, a famous oil made from coconut, a blend of know-how and traditional perfume delivering hypnotizing and captivating scents similar to an elixir of powerful and voluptuous love.\n\nFATU HIVA\n\nThe one that forms the roof of the Creator’s house, Fatu Hiva is a small and beautiful Marquesan island. As soon as you arrive from the sea, its magic operates with its sheer landscapes where luxuriant vegetation merges with the sky. In 1937, Thor Heyerdahl and his wife, in search of nature and authenticity, landed on the island and gave up their modern life. Today, arriving on the island means experiencing the same sensations. Residents live near the village of Omoa, where they make traditional and renowned tapas made from the bark of trees. Hanavave is home to the beautiful Baie des Vierges, one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. At dusk, the light sets the peaks on fire."
