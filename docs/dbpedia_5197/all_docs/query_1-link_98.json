        "text": "Nuku Hiva cruise port guide: tender port\n\nThe small island of Nuku Hiva does not have a pier available large enough for cruise ships to dock. Therefore this, as many other cruise ports in French Polynesia, is a tender port. Your ship will drop anchor in or near the bay of Taiohae and ferry you to shore with their tender boats.\n\nTender pier\n\nNuku Hiva’s tender dock is right in the center of Taiohae. You will find a small parking lot with a souvenir shop and cafe on the dock. Additionally you will find a local cafe, market, crafts market and tourist information about 50 yards from the tender dock.\n\nTaiohae\n\nTaiohae is the name of the town and bay that cruise ships visit when making Nuku Hiva their port of call. Taiohae is also the main town on the island although it only has about 1700 inhabitants. The town is build on a former volcanic crater which now collapsed creating a bay.\n\nTourist information\n\nFind a small tourist information close to the dock. Ask the friendly locals here anything you like about how to get around on the island, what to see and do and about their life style here in the island.\n\nTaxis\n\nThere are only a handful of taxis on the island of Nuku Hiva and therefore it is very rare you will be offered a local tour or taxi tour when you get to the tender pier.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nNuku Hiva doesn’t offer any form of public transportation to the places of interest. Transportation is very limited don the island.\n\nShore excursions vs Private tour\n\nTransportation on the island is very limited. There are no tourist busses available and even the ships tours utilise the local jeeps to get people around. We highly recommend you to book a shore excursion through the ship or book a private tour when going to Nuku Hiva. The Taiohae town itself is nice, but the island is spectacular. You want to make sure to experience the rugged terrain, exciting hairpin bends and spectacular views. To ensure yourself you will have a spot on one of the limited numbers of vehicles we highly recommend you to book something ahead of time. When booking a private tour, keep in mind that this is tender port. Allow yourself enough time get off the ship and meet your guide/driver on the dock.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe local currency of Nuku Hiva is the CFP Franc (XPF). These large bills are generally used all over French Polynesia. If you are on a cruise visiting more than 2 islands here we do recommend you to change into the local currency because it simply makes things easier on shore side. US dollars are generally accepted by the local vendors and shops, but still it might be worth your while to change.\n\nSouvenirs\n\nYou will find plenty of opportunities to shop for great souvenirs right around the port area.\n\nLocal souvenirs would be:\n\n– Tikis\n\n– Wood Carvings\n\n– Flowers\n\n– Pearl jewellery\n\nTaiohae is not the type of town where you will find a booming shopping mall or pedestrian shopping street. Actually, there are almost no souvenir shops in town. Luckily all vendors set up right at the dock whenever a cruise ship is in town.\n\nWifi\n\nIt is very rare for you to find free wi-fi on Nuku Hiva. This is not the port of call where you want to bring your device and catch up on your emails. We recommend you to wait for another port of call to get on wi-fi if you can."
