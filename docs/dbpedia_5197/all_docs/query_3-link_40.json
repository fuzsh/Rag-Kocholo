        "meta_description": "Knowledge of biodiversity in the past, and the timing, nature, and drivers of human-induced ecological change, is important for gaining deep time perspectives and for modern conservation efforts. The Marquesas Islands (Polynesia) are one of the world’s most remote archipelagos and illustrate the vulnerability of indigenous bioscapes to anthropogenic activities. Characterised by high levels of endemism across many biotic groups, the full spectrum of the group’s flora and fauna is nonetheless incompletely known. Several centuries of Polynesian settlement reshaped biotic communities in ways that are not yet fully understood, and historically-introduced mammalian herbivores have devastated the indigenous lowland flora. We report here on archaeological recovery of a diverse assemblage of plant and arthropod subfossils from a waterlogged deposit on the largest Marquesan island: Nuku Hiva. These materials offer new perspectives on the composition of lowland plant and arthropod communities pene-contemporaneous with human arrival. Bayesian analysis of multiple 14C results from short-lived materials date the assemblages to the mid-12th century AD (1129–1212 cal. AD, 95.4% HPD). Evidence for human activities in the catchment coincident with deposit formation includes Polynesian associated arthropods, microcharcoal, and an adzed timber. Plant macrofossils (seeds, fruits, vegetative structures) and microfossils (pollen, phytoliths) reveal coastal and lowland wet-moist forest communities unlike those observed today. Several apparently extinct taxa are identified, along with extant taxa currently constrained to high altitude and/or interior areas. A diverse inventory of subfossil arthropods—the first pre-18th century records for the islands—includes more than 100 distinct taxa, with several new archipelago records and one previously unreported for eastern Polynesia. The assemblages provide new insights into lowland Marquesan forest communities coincident with human arrival, and portend the considerable anthropogenic transformations that followed. These records also have implications for human colonisation of the Marquesas Islands and East Polynesia at large.",

        "text": "Results\n\nStratigraphic sequence\n\nFour stratigraphic layers were observed in excavation, largely differentiated on colour as all were of sandy textures (Fig 3, Table 1). No evidence of in situ cultural activities was observed within Trench 1, contrasting with findings from three other trenches to the north, situated on slightly higher ground [63]. Layer II of Trench 1 may represent a palaeotsunami deposit based on evidence from other nearby trenches. The Layer III/IV boundary in Trench 1 was marked by the top of the water table. Layer IV was rich in organic matter, including both micro- and macro-botanical remains, well preserved arthropods, and variable concentrations of microcharcoal. Excavations extended to 250 cm below the current ground surface but did not reach bedrock, again contrasting with findings from other trenches to the north where coralline bedrock was encountered at 160 and 200 cm below surface [63].\n\nGrain size analysis of the sediment fines (≤2 mm) from Layer IV was conducted using a laser granulometer. The results indicate the fines were “very poorly sorted” silty sand, following Folk [85]. The prevalence of very fine to fine sand, with considerable silt and some clay, indicates generally low energy, shallow water conditions, dominated by riverine influences but possibly with some occasional low energy marine deposition. This reflects the ecotonal location of the trench, just under 70 m from the bank of what is now a small, slow-moving, channelised river and ca. 50 m from the contemporary shoreline of a deep, generally protected, embayment (Fig 2). Outside of the varied organic remains, larger clastics were generally lacking, suggesting that the former accumulated in situ. Microcharcoal particles in the Layer IV samples point to burning at some distance from the study site, most likely upstream, and possibly in conjunction with anthropogenic forest clearance; macrocharcoal remains were lacking. The overlying sediments of Layer III mark a turning point in the local depositional regime. Subsequent inundation of the area by a palaeotsunami or storm surge (Layer II) probably contributed to subsequent shoreline aggradation, the evolving beach ridge, and shifts in the river course and outflow.\n\nRadiocarbon dating\n\nEleven radiocarbon analyses (Table 2, Fig 4) provide chronological context for human activities in this catchment and for the botanical and arthropod records presented below. The series of 14C samples was analysed incrementally, in an effort to answer specific questions about the Layer IV deposit and inter-lab variability in dating results.\n\nTwo range finder samples analysed in 2011 by Beta Analytic returned mid-13th to late 14th century age estimates (Beta-303441 and Beta-303442). In an effort to establish the onset and cessation of deposition within Layer IV, another two samples were submitted to Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Lab (WRDL) in 2019, one from the top (Wk-49523) and a second from the base of Layer IV (Wk-49524). These samples both returned mid-11th to early 13th century age ranges (95.4% prob.), overlapping with one another but at odds with the prior Beta Analytic results.\n\nSubsequently, additional samples were submitted for 14C analysis. A sample from the overlying Layer III (Wk-50155) was intended as a constraint on the Layer IV results. This produced an age range that overlapped with, but was slightly later than, that from the top of Layer IV (Wk-49523). In an effort to understand the differing results from the two laboratories, a second sample (Wk-50151) was taken from the same adzed timber that provided Beta-303441. The result was consistent with the other WRDL analyses but offset from the two Beta Analytic results.\n\nAs a cross-check for contaminants, Sample Wk-49524 was re-run by WRDL; it returned a CRA (879 ± 24) that was quite similar to the original WRDL result (909 ± 24) reported in Table 2. To further evaluate Wk-49524, another sample was submitted from the base of Layer IV (Wk-50153); again, the results were internally consistent, but offset from the Beta Analytic results. Finally, splits of two samples initially analysed by WRDL were processed by John Southon of the University of California, Irvine W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Facility (UCIAMS-230702 and -230703). The UCIAMS results were internally consistent and nearly identical to those provided by the WRDL.\n\nIn sum, results from nine samples, taken from the top, middle, and bottom of Layer IV, and in two cases on splits of the same specimens, are statistically indistinguishable at two sigma; these were analysed by WRDL and the University of California, Irvine AMS facility. These results contrast with the two Beta Analytic results and the lab offset is of some consequence. Potential causes are differences in modern or background standards or differences in pretreatments (A. Hogg, pers. comm, 2020). As inter-laboratory variation is increasingly under scrutiny, WRDL recently participated in a global comparison of radiocarbon laboratory performance and no consequential offsets were detected in that comparative exercise [86, A. Hogg, pers. com., 2020].\n\nThe approach taken here is consistent with advice on archaeological 14C “best practice” [70, 71]. Multiple AMS samples were run and these derived from three different kinds of short-lived materials (Pandanus keys, immature Cocos fruits, and mature Cocos endocarp) with the aim of excluding the possibility of in-built age. Sample Wk-50151, although from a timber, was derived from the exterior surface and the result overlaps with those on short-lived materials. The series as a whole provides a robust age estimate for the deposition of Layer IV, the larger assemblage of subfossil floral and faunal materials, and the subfossil arthropods.\n\nTo further assess the 14C results (other than the two Beta outliers discussed above), we used the Bayesian sequence analysis of OxCal ver. 4.4.4 and the Outlier Model with the Outlier command applied to the Sideroxylon timber sample Wk-50151 (Fig 5; Bayesian model code in S1 Text). Results from specimen splits (Wk-50153 and UCIAMS-230702, Pandanus key; Wk 50154 and UCIAMS-230703, Cocos nucifera immature fruit) were combined. The model indicates that the most likely time interval (95.4% highest posterior density or HPD) for deposition of Layer IV lies in the mid-12th century AD. Results show a Layer IV start estimate between 1129–1185 cal. AD (95.4%) and an end boundary of 1157–1212 cal. AD. At 95.4% HPD, the modelled Bayesian age for Layer IV lies between 1129 and 1212 cal. AD. The Bayesian results also suggest that Layer IV accumulated quite rapidly. The single sample from Layer III indicates this stratum most likely accumulated between 1159–1269 cal. AD (95.4%).\n\nPollen and phytolith records\n\nThe microfossil sample from Layer IV provided a modest but informative record, although no starch microfossils were recovered [87]. The pollen sample was dominated by Pandanus (>65%), but Cocos (ca. 15%) was also moderately well represented (Fig 6, top). Native forest trees included Pterophylla (syn. Weinmannia, Cunoniaceae), Metrosideros (Myrtaceae), and Terminalia (Combretaceae). Several pollen grains were assigned to Moraceae/Urticaceae, a broad category that encompasses taxa of varied biogeographic origins. Marquesan members of the Moraceae family include the Ficus prolixa var. prolixa, Streblus antropophagorum, Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit), and Broussonetia papyrifera (paper mulberry)—the latter two being Polynesian introductions. Among the native Marquesan Urticaceae are two small trees/shrubs, Pipturus (three species) and Boehmeria virgata, as well as Procris pedunculata, a succulent herb that is common in wet valley forests and often epiphytic. Unfortunately, a definitive identification was not possible.\n\nOther microfossils (phytoliths and sponge spicules) inform on the subcanopy vegetation, with both fern spores and grass pollen represented (Fig 6, bottom). Histiopteris, most likely H. incisa, is a fast-growing, sun-loving taxon that is a good indicator of natural or anthropogenically disturbed areas (e.g., landslides, treefall gap, fire, etc.). The phytolith assemblage, however, was dominated by Arecaceae (palm family), and only a small number of grass phytoliths were observed, suggesting that a closed canopy dominated the area. The sponge spicules were not further identified but may warrant future study as approximately one-third of the Marquesan sponges are endemics [88].\n\nPlant macrofossil assemblages\n\nThe plant macrofossil assemblage contains a diversity of seeds, fruits, thorns, anthers, fern sporangia and scales, and bryophyte leaves (some entire, but many fragmented). A total of 1768 plant macrofossil remains were identified; of these, 1716 are higher plants from 31 named taxa and 52 are bryophyte specimens. The assemblage is dominated by indigenous taxa (Tables 3 and 4) and various life forms are represented: trees, shrubs, herbs, gramminoids and ferns (Figs 7–9). Indications are that at least two vegetation communities are represented. Possible extinct taxa include Mussaenda, Macaranga, and Acalypha, none of which were previously known from the archipelago. In one case, Mussaenda, the subfossil specimens are morphometrically distinct from other species in the region (see below). While there is one modern endemic Nuku Hivan species of Claoxylon, its seeds are dissimilar from the subfossil [78]. As such, an extinct Claoxylon species may be present in the assemblage. The Trema seeds could derive from T. orientalis, which has only recently been recognised as indigenous [47].\n\nLeft: immature Cocos nucifera fruit (five views); centre: Pandanus key (two views); right: Cocos nucifera endocarp (plan view and cross-section).

Scale bars: B, E, 2 mm; A, H, 1 mm; C, G, 0.5 mm; D, F, 0.25 mm. (Photos by N. Porch).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265224.g009\n\nEndemic forest elements include trees and shrubs such as Cyrtandra cf. thibaultii, Pterophylla cf. marquesana and Geniostoma cf. hallei. There are four endemic species of Cyrtandra on Nuku Hiva. Based on the similarity of size, sculpture and the line drawing of the seed of Cyrtandra thibaultii in Gillet (as C. jonesii) [figure 91 in 80], the subfossil was determined as Cyrtandra cf. thibaultii. There are two endemic species of Geniostoma on Nuku Hiva. The size of the subfossil suggests it is most likely Geniostoma cf. hallei, as its seeds are the larger of the two species [46]. Two relatively large ferns, Ptisana salicina and Angiopteris marchionica, are also present. These taxa are found today in mesic, moist, and wet montane forests [46, 47, 84] and are largely restricted to mountain ridges and slopes (700–1150 m) (Table 3). Their presence in the Ho‘oumi deposit may indicate that these forests elements once extended to lower elevations. Pioneer taxa such as Pipturus cf. argenteus and Ficus cf. prolixa are abundant, and less commonly Morinda citrifolia and Trema cf. orientalis, suggesting the possibility of disturbances within the associated forest communities. Although Morinda citrifolia has been considered a Polynesian introduction in the past, Porch and Prebble’s work elsewhere in the central East Polynesian region suggests it may pre-date human arrival.\n\nElements of lowland coastal forests are also present. Guettarda speciosa, Premna serratifolia, Cocos nucifera, Pandanus tectorius and Calophyllum inophyllum are among the recovered fruits and seeds (Fig 7), though the first two can also be found at altitude. Remains of Pandanus (fruit keys, trunk fragments, and leaves) and Cocos (immature fruits, fragments of mature endocarp, and wood) were particularly common, suggesting these taxa grew in the immediate area. Seeds of Cucurbitaceae (Fig 8) and Cyperaceae may derive from native taxa or could be Polynesian introductions; unfortunately they could not be identified to lower taxonomic levels with our current reference collections (see further discussion below). Pritchardia-type palm seeds (Fig 8), probably deriving from the lowland coastal forest, were present in two samples as fragments, but no complete specimens were recovered.\n\nPreliminary bryophyte identifications indicate two Lejeuneaceae taxa (leafy liverworts), and two Fissidens species, three Calymperes species, one Syrrhopodon species, and two possible Neckeraceae taxa (mosses) (Table 4, Fig 9). Fissidens cf. raiatensis, Fissidens cf. tahitensis and Calymperes cf. moorei represent new records for the Marquesas Islands [82, 83], though more recent studies on the Marquesan bryophytes are lacking.\n\nThese seed and fruit assemblages are complemented by a modest collection of woody materials, previously reported in [63] and identified by Jennifer Huebert. Indigenous species, following Wagner and Lorence [81], that are represented only by wood include cf. Barringtonia asiatica, Erythrina variegata, Talipariti tiliaceum (syn. Hibiscus tiliaceus; or possibly H. rosa-sinensis), Sideroxylon sp., and Thespesia populnea, as well as rhizome/trunk fragments that are suggestive of Cyatheaceae. Notably, Talipariti/Hibiscus is not well represented in the Layer IV wood charcoal assemblage. This is consistent with patterns elsewhere on Nuku Hiva, where the taxon is best represented in mid- to late prehistoric charcoal assemblages [23], suggesting its distribution expanded in concert with the growth of anthropogenic environments.\n\nThe most notable subfossil wood specimen is the adzed Sideroxylon (syn. Nesoluma) timber (Fig 10). Roughly 15 cm in diameter, one end of the specimen angles to a point, at a roughly 45 degree angle. The tapered end is marked by two to three narrow, obliquely angled steps. The modifications are consistent with those that result when a traditional Polynesian stone adze is used in an oblique chopping action on a standing small diameter tree and contrast with the jagged and asymmetrical breaks that arise from natural tree falls. The modifications are also consistent with stone adze marks found on more formal Polynesian artefacts. More speculatively, the tapering in the round of this small diameter timber might suggest secondary shaping for a particular use.\n\nLeft: archaeological specimen of Sideroxylon sp. from Layer IV, Trench 1; note cuts at lower end.

The specimen illustrated here is most likely a remnant of forest clearing activities, but it could also have been felled for fuel or modified for use as a fence post. This genus of the Sapotaceae family, now extinct in the Marquesas, is known solely from archaeological materials.\n\nPrior to our Marquesan studies, three Sideroxylon species were known for East Polynesia [90]. S. polynesicum, a shrub to medium tree, is the most widely distributed, being present in the southern Cook (Mangaia), Austral (Rapa and Raivavae), and Hawaiian Islands. Two endemic species are recognised: S. nadeaudii persists in the Society Islands in mesic forests between 400 and 800 m on Tahiti, while S. St.-Johnianum is a small endemic tree found on karstic and isolated Henderson Island [90]. The Marquesan species could not be determined from the wood charcoal [89]. The extension of this genus to the Marquesas is perhaps not surprising, as it fills a regional distribution gap.\n\nArthropod assemblages\n\nA total of 2124 identifiable arthropod remains were recovered from the five bulk sediment samples, dominated by 777 mites (not further sorted to morphospecies), 704 ants, 391 beetles and a smaller number of other insects and arachnids (Figs 11–13; Table 5). The most diverse group of insects are the beetles with at least 61 species representing at least 19 families, with a small number of taxa unassigned to a family. The ants include representatives of 11 species, two of which are singletons. The arachnids include at least one common pseudoscorpion represented by chelicerae, and several families of spiders represented by their distinctive carapaces. Other taxa that occur in small numbers include earwigs (Dermaptera), termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), wasps (Hymenoptera), larval, adult, and pupal flies (Diptera) and true bugs and scale insects (Hemiptera).\n\nA.

This is consistent with the radiocarbon results that, as noted above, suggest very rapid accumulation of this stratigraphic unit. Additionally, the arthropod remains are consistent with environmental conditions suggested by the associated plant materials.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt is well known that human colonists of East Polynesia transformed island landscapes in a myriad of ways, but the timing, particulars, and long-term ecodynamics are incompletely resolved. Transdisciplinary research and multi-proxy approaches like those undertaken here hold significant promise for improved understanding of complex socio-ecological relationships. The Ho‘oumi Beach findings inform on the timing of human arrival and offer a window onto early human activities and initiation of what became long-term impacts in one of region’s most remote archipelagos.\n\nHuman arrival in the Marquesas Islands\n\nThree independent proxies inform on the timing and nature of early human activity at Ho‘oumi Beach. Anthropophilic arthropods, taxa that are strongly associated with Polynesian activities elsewhere in the region, were found throughout Layer IV. Both contemporary biogeographic distributions, and occasionally their recovery from sediment cores with substantial prehuman records, have helped to establish the association of these taxa with Polynesian arrivals [19, 92]. Most likely these non-native arthropods were transported along with traditional Polynesian root crops, such as taro and yam. Microcharcoal particles are a second proxy of human activity, as natural fires are rare in the Marquesas Islands [59, p. 19). Microcharcoal occurs throughout Layer IV but is most abundant in the lower part of the deposit. Elsewhere on Nuku Hiva, dense charcoal deposits have been observed at the base of stratified cultural sequences, suggesting burning frequently accompanied initial use of coastal areas [93, 94]. In the Ho‘oumi case, the very small particle size suggests firing elsewhere in the valley, most likely upstream from Trench 1, and long-distance transport. A more direct indicator of human activity is the adzed timber of a locally extinct Sapotaceae species (Fig 10). This is probably an artefact of forest clearance but may have been purposefully shaped, as for example for use as a fence stake. In combination these three proxies provide a solid basis for inferring human activities coincident with the formation of Layer IV. The three proxies are also consistent with practices and outcomes relating to the establishment of gardens, including forest clearance (cutting and burning), erosion and sediment transport, and the establishment of Polynesian arthropods, some of which are commonly associated with cultivation.\n\nEleven 14C analyses allow for a robust age estimate of these anthropogenic markers and the other plant and arthropod subfossils. A sample from the base of the overlying, non-cultural, sedimentary unit (Layer III) provides a constraint for the Layer IV 14C results. Analyses by three laboratories identified two outliers and an inter-laboratory offset. The remaining eight analyses, with one exception, were run on three different kinds of short-lived materials to avoid inbuilt age [69, 70, 95]. A sample from the exterior of the small diameter timber (Wk-50151) returned a 14C result that is consistent with the short-lived material dates. These results place initial human activity in Ho‘oumi Valley between mid-11th to early 13th centuries AD. The Bayesian age model narrows the Layer IV age estimate to the mid-12th century AD (1129–1212 cal. AD, 95.4% HPD).\n\nThese findings are usefully compared with other early 14C analyses, both at Ho‘oumi Beach and elsewhere on Nuku Hiva Island. Domestic activities in Anaho Valley to the north (Fig 1) are slightly later, dating between the mid-12th to mid-13th centuries AD at the Moetai site [96]. At Ho‘oumi Beach itself, nearby excavations on higher ground to the north identified a stratigraphically superior cultural occupation that Bayesian analysis places between the 13th and 14th centuries AD [63]. Thirteenth to 14th century occupations are also found in other northern valleys (Hakaea and Hatiheu), and continue at Anaho [93, 94]. Although Ha‘atuatua Valley (see Fig 1) on the eastern coast of Nuku Hiva has long been considered an early Marquesan settlement area, only one 14C result from the lowest occupation (Layer D) comes close to meeting current 14C standards and this was on unidentified wood charcoal (970 ± 70) [97; reviewed in 96, p.7]. The age estimate of that sample is slightly earlier than the results reported here.\n\nElsewhere in the archipelago, 12th to 13th century dates come from occupation sites on the islands of Ua Huka (Hane and Hokatu sites) [98–100], Eiao [101, p. 78], and Tahuata (Hanamiai site) [33]. Many of these 14C results are on unidentified wood charcoal raising some uncertainty about the accuracy of the age estimates [96]. With eleven 14C analyses, Hane is the best dated and most thoroughly studied of these [98, 99, 101–104]. Here, however, the individual conventional radiocarbon dates (CRAs) from the basal cultural layer range from 810 ± 40 to 1088 ± 25 [99, Table 1]. Results on a twig, a definitively short-lived material (Beta-260938, CRA 810 ± 40), calibrates to AD 1226–1280 (68.2%, SHCal20), which is slightly later than the Bayesian model estimate reported here for Ho‘oumi (1129–1212 cal. AD, 95.4% HPD). A second Hane sample on unidentified broadleaf charcoal (Wk-27331, 928 ± 30) overlaps with the Ho‘oumi results.\n\nOverall, the Ho‘oumi chronometric results are robust with respect to the materials dated (short-lived), the number of samples analysed, and the implementation of interlaboratory comparisons. The internally consistent series modestly extends the Nuku Hiva cultural sequence and is not at odds with results from elsewhere in the archipelago.\n\nThe Ho‘oumi evidence is regionally significant as well, demonstrating that human colonisation of the Marquesas Islands was pene-contemporaneous with Polynesian arrival in the Society Islands to the east. The Fa‘ahia site on Huahine Island, is dated by eight 14C results on short-lived materials [105, Table 2]. Recalibration of those CRAs using the newly available SHCal20 curve [73] places initial occupation at AD 1044–1265 (maximal age range of the 68% probabilities). There is some uncertainty around the early end of the Fa‘ahia distribution; relative areas under the 68% probability distributions only reach 0.513 or less, and in half the cases a mid- to late 12th century age is indicated as more likely. This uncertainty leaves open the possibility that human settlement in the Marquesas Islands was contemporaneous with, or soon after, that in the Societies.\n\nResults from both the Societies and the Marquesas, however, post-date initial human activities in the southern Cook Islands, where Sear and colleagues [106] proposed that exploratory expeditions preceded full-scale settlement. Lake core sediments on Atiu Island produced mammalian faecal sterols dating to ca. the 10th century AD, followed by more significant environmental disturbances roughly a century later. Consistent with the Atiu Island model, Kirch and colleagues date the basal cultural occupation of the Tangatatau Rockshelter, on nearby Mangaia Island, from the 11th century AD [107].\n\nThe Ho‘oumi results, along with the forgoing archaeological chronologies from the northern Marquesas Islands, point to a longer occupation sequence relative to that recently proposed by Ioannidis and colleagues [108]. Drawing on genome-wide data and novel computational analyses, they suggest divergence (and by extension settlement) dates for the northern Marquesas of around AD 1330–1360. Notably, these divergent dates are suggested to be terminus ante quem for a given settlement locality. As suggested by the foregoing review, chronometric assessments for the northern Marquesas, and Nuku Hiva in particular, are more in line with their proposed divergence estimates for the southern Marquesas (Fatu Hiva), Tuamotu, and Austral Islands. Along with indicating a deeper human history for the northern Marquesas, our results raise questions about the processes that have affected the genetic model outcomes [108] relating to the northern group, such as the potential of post-settlement trade contact [63, 96, 108 p. 524–25].\n\nStratigraphic integrity of the Ho‘oumi deposit\n\nThe 14C evidence also informs on the stratigraphic integrity of the Ho‘oumi deposit. AMS results from throughout the unit failed to identify any stratigraphic inversions. For the arthropods, the recovered remains were typically compressed, consistent with having been preserved under pressure within a sedimentary sequence. Additionally, there is very limited (if any) evidence of contamination suggested by the biotic materials themselves. In the case of the seeds, fruits, wood, and microfossils, no definitive post-western contact taxa were identified. Although there is the possibility that one or more of the specimens identified to genus could include historic introductions, this is considered unlikely (see below). Among the arthropods, the only potential example of a modern contaminant is a single specimen of Paratrechina longicornis—a species that is most likely a post-contact introduction to Polynesia [61]. These factors suggest extremely low levels of disturbance or contamination by more recent materials.\n\nBotanical assemblages\n\nThis is the first consequential record of the pre-European herbaceous (non-woody) vegetation for the Marquesan Islands. A previously analysed sedimentary core from the Nuku Hiva interior (To‘ovi‘i Plateau at 810 m) identified a small number of arborescent taxa, herbs, and ferns dating from ca. 1350–1400 AD—but the core was generally pollen-poor [109]. In contrast, a diverse range of taxa have been identified from the Ho‘oumi site, with two communities potentially represented: low to mid-elevation moist-wet forest (following Florence and Lorence [44]) and coastal forest. Elements of the former include both canopy and understory taxa. Among the potential canopy dominants are Pandanus tectorius, Pterophylla (syn.Weinmannia) cf. marquesana, Cyrtandra cf. thibaultii, and Angiopteris marchionica, with an herbaceous fern understory also suggested. Florence and Lorence [44] place this forest community today between 300 to 800 m elevation. While the Ho‘oumi examples conceivably could have been fluvially transported from the valley interior, the possibility that some of these taxa extended to lower elevations is equally plausible. Similarly, the Metrosideros pollen intimates that this taxon, now restricted to higher elevations [44, p. 234], once grew at lower altitudes. Supportive evidence comes from Anaho Valley to the north where Metrosideros wood was recovered from an early fire feature [23].\n\nComparisons with archaeobotanical assemblages from nearby but chronologically later strata that are associated with residential features and domestic activities [63] are instructive and give insights into the vegetation transformations that accompanied Polynesian settlement over time. In these later contexts, Calophyllum, Thespesia, Cordia subcordata, Gymnosporia crenata, Phyllanthus marchionicus, Alstonia costata, and Sapindus saponaria were identified. Several Polynesian introductions are also represented, such as Aleurites moluccanus (candlenut), Casuarina equisetifolia (ironwood), cf. Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit), and cf. Spondias dulcis (Otaheite apple), taxa that are suggestive of house gardens or nearby cultivations.\n\nArthropod records\n\nThe arthropod assemblage is the first pre-western record of its kind for the Marquesas Islands. It too was diverse, with more than 100 distinct taxa representing at least nine major groups and more than 39 families. Biogeographic assignments are in some cases tentative given the possibility of extinct taxa, the limited knowledge of some native Marquesan biotic groups, and the possibility of previously unrecognised Polynesian introductions. Taxa of aquatic environments include relatively infrequent simuliid, chironomid, and ceratopogonid flies. Among the more unusual finds is a single elytron of a dytiscid water beetle that belongs to a genus that has not previously been recorded for eastern Polynesia (cf. Liodessus). The tribe (Bidessini) is known only from living material collected on Raiatea and from abundant fossils of Allodessus and another unidentified genus (not Liodessus) from other island subfossil records [19, 110].\n\nThe simuliids indicate flowing water but may derive from upstream rather than the immediate locality if the local environment of the site today was similar in the past. The relative infrequency of taxa indicating aquatic environments suggests the presence of a marsh at the time of deposition, rather than open water. This is supported by the abundance and diversity of terrestrial taxa, which comprise the bulk of the assemblage in terms of both numbers of individuals and diversity of taxa. The absence of acidocerine hydrophilids (Enochrus/Chasmogenus) is notable given their ubiquity in other eastern Polynesian subfossil assemblages, where they can be abundant in terrestrial-dominated insect assemblages that accumulated in marsh settings. However, Ramage [55] does not list Enochrus as occurring in the Marquesas, nor Chasmogenus as occurring is French Polynesia. These contrasts probably reflect a combination of large scale changes that have occurred in the nature of aquatic habitats, and therefore assemblages, over the past 800–1000 years, and the relative lack of extensive targeted surveys for many groups of non-marine invertebrates, including aquatic beetles.\n\nThe terrestrial arthropod species are dominated by indigenous taxa of forest habitats, with a large variety of saproxylic species that are associated with dead and decaying plant matter. Many of these groups are widespread across eastern Polynesia. Of the 391 beetles, the majority belong to saproxylic taxa. These include an abundant and diverse range of cossonine weevils that are commonly encountered in fern and palm stems or the sapwood of dead trees. Because the modern cossonine fauna of eastern Polynesia is poorly known, it is difficult to be more specific about both the taxonomic composition of the fauna and the detailed ecology of the species. Other weevils are also present, including Ampagia, Miocalles, and the belid Proterhinus, and likely Rhyncogonus, which is represented only by distinctive large tarsal segments. Species of these taxa are frequently collected from living plants but may not necessarily be obligate to specific plant taxa. All of the above genera have been previously recorded from the Marquesas, with a small number of endemic species in the first three and many endemic species in Rhyncogonus [55].\n\nBark beetles, which generally prefer living trees, are represented by two species of Xyleborini and by at least two species of the genus Hypothenemus. Further saproxylic beetles include the bostrichid, elaterids, zopherids, laemophloeids, ptinids and other taxa listed as saproxylic in Table 5. The presence of at least two species of laemophloeid is notable given that this family is not currently known to contain indigenous/endemic taxa in the Marquesas [55]. It is unlikely these taxa are Polynesian introductions as they fit well with the overall domination of the insect assemblage by saproxylic taxa.\n\nIn addition to these saproxylic taxa are a range of less common but diverse predators, detrivores, fungivores, and hygrophiles. The spore-feeding latridiid genus Mumfordia is known from single endemic species found on Hivaoa and Ua Huka [111]. The record here is likely a first for Nuku Hiva and almost certainly a new species. Species that occur around standing waterbodies include the carabid Tachys sexguttatus and the staphylinid Carpelimus, which is represented by several species but very poorly known in the region. The detrivorous hydrophild Omicrus has not been recorded from the Marquesas but is almost certainly overlooked in the modern fauna because of its very small size. The consistent presence of Platyscapa fig wasps, pollinators of Ficus, corresponds well with the abundance of fig seeds in the plant assemblage.\n\nAs a whole the arthropod assemblage is consistent with the presence of a relatively intact indigenous lowland forest. Also of note, the Ho‘oumi assemblage includes beetle taxa like Adamanthea (Staphylinidae), Ampagia (Curculionidae), Bitoma, and Pycnomerus (Zopheridae) that, to our knowledge, have not previously been collected on Nuku Hiva and therefore may represent new records (i.e., Adamanthea) and new species (i.e., Ampagia, Mumfordia, and the zopherids). Detailed survey is needed to determine whether these, and indeed many of the other saproxylic taxa, persist on Nuku Hiva, most likely at higher elevations. It should be noted that many such taxa, including Pycnomerus and other zopherids, and Ampagia, are present in prehuman insect assemblages of the eastern Pacific islands but rapidly disappear soon after the arrival of Polynesians and the attendant transformations of lowland forests [19, 32]. In light of these regional findings, the Ho‘oumi record most likely signals some of the earliest early human activities in this valley.\n\nPolynesian translocations\n\nLacking more comprehensive reference collections, definitive taxonomic determinations of the seed and fruit macrofossils have been challenging and it is uncertain if Polynesian translocations are represented. Nonetheless, a small number of specimens warrant discussion. The two cucurbit seeds (Cucurbitaceae) are intriguing. Morphologically they are broadly inconsistent with the South American-derived Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd). Whistler [20], however, notes another gourd, Benincasa hispida (wax gourd, hoe puo), that was collected in the Marquesas as early as 1838 and Brown [35] considered the species a possible Polynesian introduction. Informal experiments by Lewis on modern marginate seeds of B. hispida show that spongy surface tissue often degrades to a state consistent with the irregular surface of the Marquesan subfossils. Zehneria mucronata is another potential candidate; this taxon is considered indigenous to the Society Islands and the Marquesas, today being found in montane cloud forest [47]. Modern seeds of Zehneria mucronata were not available for comparison but based on published materials the seeds of this species appear smaller than the subfossils. Unfortunately, the two Ho‘oumi specimens are poorly preserved and neither could not be convincingly attributed to a specific genera.\n\nThe Solanum specimens are also of interest. The subfossil seeds do not match S. americanum or S. opacum, which are in the same taxonomic complex. Rather, the morphology of the Ho‘oumi seeds is closer to that of S. repandum. The origin of this Solanum is uncertain but it is often found in association with human activities and is distributed to several central Polynesian archipelagos, including Fiji, Sāmoa, Niue, the Cook Islands, and Tahiti [20, pp. 192–93]. In the Marquesas, Wagner and Lorence [81] consider S. repandum to be indigenous, though they note it is found around villages, from 0–100 m elevation. The fruits were eaten across Polynesia and in Tahiti the leaves are used to make a red dye; medicinal use has also been recorded [20, pp. 192–93].\n\nMorinda citrifolia is often considered a Polynesian dispersal. In East Polynesia, the medicinal properties of the fruits are valued and the roots and bark produce colourful dyes [20, p. 149]. In a recent wood charcoal study involving a large number of samples from three northern Nuku Hiva valleys, Morinda was rare and restricted to late contexts. On these grounds, Huebert and Allen [36] proposed it may have been a secondary introduction to the Marquesas, post-dating colonisation by several hundred years. The macrofossil remains from Ho‘oumi now extend the temporal depth of this taxon into the early settlement period, a finding that fits with previous observations of Morinda citrifolia on Rimatara (Austral Islands) in contexts that pre-date human arrival. Our results raise the possibility that it also reached the Marquesas Islands in pre-human times.\n\nThe Ho‘oumi arthropod record is likewise dominated by indigenous taxa. However, a small number of species were most likely introduced, inadvertently, by Polynesians. These include the beetle Cryptamorpha desjardinsii, the earwig Euborellia annulipes, and at least three ants, Hypoponera cf. punctatissima, Tetramorium bicarinatum, and Nylanderia sp. Both C. desjardinsii and E. annulipes can be common in Polynesian-aged sediments elsewhere in Polynesia [19]. The ant genera Hypoponera and Nylanderia are among the most abundant insect taxa in the Ho‘oumi deposit, a pattern that frequently characterises invasive taxa. These taxa are common in Polynesian-aged sediments elsewhere in the region, and have not been recovered from pre-human contexts [17, 19]. Both genera are considered introduced to French Polynesia by Ramage [61]. Two other ant taxa that are introductions are infrequent. Tetramorium bicarinatum occurs elsewhere in eastern Polynesia in Polynesian-aged sediments, suggesting it is potentially also a Polynesian introduction to the Marquesas, although it is considered a historical introduction by Ramage [61]. The single specimen of Paratrechina longicornis may be a contaminant introduced during sampling as it is not known from prehistoric sediments anywhere in Polynesia and Ramage [61] considers it a post-contact (historic) introduction.\n\nExtinctions and extirpations\n\nBoth the plant and arthropod assemblages suggest major transformations of Marquesan lowland environments over time, with changes in both species compositions and relative abundances. The clearest example is provided by Sideroxylon, only recently recognised as a now extinct and apparently once widespread and abundant component of lowland Marquesan forests [23]. The distribution of Sideroxylon now extends to Ho‘oumi Valley, but it is restricted to Layer IV, where other extinctions are suggested by the material reported here.\n\nOther possible extinct taxa (or extirpated, in the case of Trema) include Mussaenda, Macaranga, Trema, and Acalypha, none of which have been previously recorded for Nuku Hiva or for the archipelago, with the exception of Trema, which has recently been identified on Ua Pou. Two Mussaenda species are currently known for Marquesas but both are cultivars and neither produce seed [81, 112, 113]. Indigenous Mussaenda are found elsewhere in Melanesia, Western and Eastern Polynesia, as for example M. raiateensis, which occurs on Raiatea (Society Islands) where it is extremely rare, and limited to montane cloud forest [114, also J.-Y. Meyer, pers. com., 2021], and thus a Marquesan representative is not unexpected.\n\nCharacters of the subfossil Mussaenda seeds are intermediate between those of the two extant Pacific species, M. cylindrocarpa and M. raiateensis, both in seed length and in number of pits per cell (Table 6). However, modern seeds have not been examined to assess whether the subfossils fall at the extreme end of the range of the variability for either species. Both modern species occur in forest edges from sea level to 1000 metres [115]. M. cylindrocarpa occurs mostly in Papua New Guinea and across the Pacific to Vanuatu on Erromanga Island [115]. M. raiateensis occurs in Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Sāmoa, Wallis and Futuna, Cook and the Society Islands, the latter being the current eastern-most range. Thus the new Ho‘oumi subfossil record extends the eastern terminus of the genus Mussaenda in the Pacific.\n\nSimilarly, although there are no known indigenous Marquesan Macaranga, there are multiple species elsewhere in the region, some endemic. The Austral Island sedimentary cores again suggest one or more native species that were widespread prior to human arrival, highlighting the genus’ vulnerability to anthropogenic activities [19]. The extant French Polynesian Macaranga species are found in coastal, ridge, mesic, wet or montane cloud forests [79]. They are island or archipelago endemics [79], as island radiations are common within the genus [116]. The Ho‘oumi record extends the taxon’s range in the Pacific, from the Society Islands to the Marquesan archipelago.\n\nAcalypha has also not been previously recorded in the Marquesas. Of the three French Polynesian taxa, two have larger seeds than the subfossils, and one has very similar dimensions to the subfossil, Acalypha rapensis, a Rapan endemic [79]. Notably the Marquesas Islands have floristic affinities with Rapa, sharing some 27 species [44]. The Ho‘oumi subfossil thus might represent the extirpation of A. rapensis, or alternatively could be an extinct Marquesan endemic.\n\nThe Marquesan endemic Claoxylon ooumuense was considered for the determination of the likely Claoxlyon subfossil. While of similar dimensions to the Ho‘oumi example, and with irregularly rugose-tuberculate sculpture on the dorsal face, C. ooumuense is excluded on the basis that its seed is smooth on the ventral surface and its shape is obovoid [figure 7.8 in 79], unlike the subfossil (Fig 9). The subfossil compares well to the line drawing and description of Claoxylon collenettei, an endemic of Rapa [79, pp. 56–8, figure 6.8] and again may represent an extirpation of C. collenettei or an extinct Marquesan taxon.\n\nTrema is yet another possibly indigenous and now extirpated Nuku Hivan taxon; its seeds were found throughout the Ho‘oumi deposit. Florence [79] considered T. discolor a French Polynesian endemic and it was well represented in a recent lake core study on Mo‘orea (Society Islands) [117]. In the Marquesas, in contrast, there is only a single recorded occurrence of Trema, collected on Ua Pou in 2003, initially leading Wagner and Lorence [81] to propose it was a naturalised example of T. orientalis, but they now consider it indigenous [47].\n\nThe Pritchardia (palm) seed fragments are of particular interest. In their review of East Polynesian Pritchardia, Butaud and Hodel [91] note early historic accounts of the genus on Nuku Hiva, and specifically in Ho‘oumi but no wild specimens have been recently observed on the island. Two species were introduced to the Marquesas in historic times: P. pacifica probably arrived in the late 19th or early 20th century and P. thurstonii in the second half of the 20th century [91, p. 151]. Our archaeologically recovered materials are the first pre-18th century examples of the genus on Nuku Hiva; they confirm this taxon was native to the island, with the recently described P. tahuatana from Tahuata Island [91] being a possible species. However, an extinct Pritchardia could also be represented. The Ho‘oumi subfossils, fragments of seeds, are slightly larger than those of P. pacifica. The leaves and other parts of this palm were highly valued by Marquesans—for fine weaving, thatch on elite houses, and use in rituals, but the fruits may also have been favoured by the introduced Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). Today Marquesan Pritchardia are extinct in the wild but Butaud and Hodel [91] suggest the genus was once an element of mesic to wet lowland forests.\n\nIt is difficult to assess the likelihood of insect extinctions here given that there has been little modern collecting specifically focussed on groups that might be missing from the modern biota. Elsewhere in eastern Polynesia the composition of the subfossil record has driven the collecting focus (e.g., for the genus Pycnomerus in the Austral islands) [32, 118], providing a better idea of what is likely extinct and what may be extant. Notable occurrences in the Ho‘oumi record, specifically groups not recorded in Ramage [55] or other literature, include the beetle genera Mumfordia, Ampagia, Miocalles, Monanus, the two unidentified laemophloeid taxa, and likely many of the unidentified cossonine weevils. The previously unrecorded species of water-beetle (Liodessus-type) is certainly a new genus record for the archipelago and for French Polynesia, although the single elytron does not allow much to be said of possible relationships. The presence of an ant species (Tetramorium sp. 3 ‘new?’) that cannot currently be identified demonstrates that the loss of taxa may extend to groups other than beetles. The history of discovery of one group of trogossitid beetles in French Polynesia, first in the lowland subfossil record of the Austral and Society Islands [17, 119], and their subsequent recognition in several collections from high elevation sites on Tahiti, suggests caution needs to be the rule when relatively good quality, high-elevation habitats remain, as on Nuku Hiva. Although it should be noted that even in this latter circumstance it is still likely that the majority of species that were endemic to low elevation islands, or restricted to low elevations of high islands, are now extinct.\n\nThese losses and transformations are still poorly understood but contemporary studies highlight the dynamic and recursive feedback relationships between vegetation communities, predators, pollinators, and nutrient recyclers. Some plant species, for example, played more pivotal roles, with Adamson [59, pp. 40–41] observing that Metrosideros collina and Pterophylla marquesana, which were both common Marquesan tree species, supported particularly large insect faunas relative to other arborescent taxa. In this regard he also drew attention to Cyrtandra. Exploration of these relationships over time will require more detailed identifications and additional assemblages, but those at hand clearly demonstrate that Marquesan biodiversity once exceeded that which is currently recognised."
