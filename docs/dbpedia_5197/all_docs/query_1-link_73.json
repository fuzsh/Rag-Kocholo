        "text": "This sign greeted us as we came ashore in another of the Marquesas islands.\n\nThe outriggers had come out to meet our ship.\n\nSome scenes along the shore.\n\nOne of our first stops was the craft market. We couldn't resist picking up some souvenirs.\n\nThis fellow was working on a paddle. I expect that it will never touch water.\n\nWe passed by an elementary school.\n\nWhen the kids noticed us they came to the fence and I went over to talk with them.\n\nOur only common language was making faces at each other.\n\nWe were told not to miss this church when we visited Nuku Hiva.\n\nIt had wonderful wood and stone carvings throughout.\n\nAnd that is not a trick of perspective the steeples do lean toward each other.\n\nThe foot of the pulpit had figures you might find in many churches with the addition of occasional tikis.\n\nThis huge candle holder also had interesting figures around its base.\n\nWe visited a ceremonial arena where warriors would gather to celebrate after successful battles.\n\nThe ruler would sit on this stone lounge chair flanked by others of high rank.\n\nThe festivities would sometimes include the roasting and consumption of one of their enemies.\n\nReports of this taking place date from as late as the mid 1800's.\n\nBreadfruit served as a staple part of their diet and also was used in ceremonial functions.\n\nJust some of the natural beauty all around.\n\nIt seems that at times the clouds seem to be trying to take the form of the rock.\n\nOr is it the other way around?\n\nHere are links to places we visited on this tour. Tahiti, Pitcairn, Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa, Fakarava, and Moorea.\n\nAnd links photos of the eclipse, eclipse photography, tikis, the ship, young dancers, food, fish, and flowers and trees we saw on the trip.\n\nSee other places we have visited here.\n\nGo to our Personal home page\n\nGo to our Community page\n\nGo to our Science Fun page"
