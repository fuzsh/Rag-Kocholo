        "text": "The sport is constituted as a social phenomenon that depends directly on the figure of the athlete, the protagonist of the sporting spectacle. Athletes are responsible for the promotion and perpetuation of Olympism. Therefore important in understanding the reasons and motives that lead these people to engage in this activity that involves abstinence from social life and above average dedication to a regimented life and intended for incessant repetition of technical gestures. The public face of the athlete is to be envied, but little understood what this is necessarily your obsessive side to reach the goals related to the search result and the win. The understanding of this process is as crucial as the technologies development related with biological aspects that evolved greatly over the past century.
