        "text": "The club's parent athletic club, Esporte Clube Pinheiros, was founded in 1899, under the name Sport Club Germânia (S.C. Germânia). The club's name was changed to Esporte Clube Pinheiros (E.C.P), in 1941. In the 2005–06 season, E.C. Pinheiros participated for the first time in the professional first division of Brazilian basketball, but then failed to qualify for the single league that resulted from the merging of the conferences. In the 2008–09 season, Pinheiros joined the new top-tier level Brazilian league, the Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB), under the sponsored name, Pinheiros/Sky. The club finished 2nd in the FIBA South American League in 2011, and also finished 2nd in the InterLeagues Tournament in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2013, the team won its first international tournament, the most important tournament of Latin America, the FIBA Americas League, with two victories against the host team, Capitanes de Arecibo, of the Puerto Rican League, and the Argentine League club CA Lanús. In the second round, Pinheiros also needed a Capitanes victory over the Brazilian League club, UniCEUB/BRB, the team that had eliminated Pinheiros in the two previous editions of the NBB. And it happened - the team from Puerto Rico, beat the defending three time Brazilian League champions, helping Pinheiros to win its first international title.\n\nPinheiros thus qualified to play at the 2013 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup, against the defending back-to-back EuroLeague champions, Olympiacos. Pinheiros lost the series two games to none, losing the first game by a score of 81–70, and the second game by a score of 86–69."
