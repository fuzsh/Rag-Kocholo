        "text": "I'm brazilian and never understood that. As my country, Mexico have:\n\n- Up to one hundred million of soccer fanatics;\n\nDont let the population fool you. Soccer in Mexico is still very much centralized. There are still many areas of Mexico untapped. Not enough coverage.\n\nWhen soccer started to come about, Soccer was for the elite. Many clubs in Mexico did not allow Mexicans (either of Euro descent or native) to participate. Some of the better teams in Mexico were clubs like Germania, Espa√±a, British Cricket Club, etc. it was during the revolution when there was a movement to Mexicanize the leagues. Clubs like America, Necaxa, Atlante, Guadalajara moved to have more Mexican players.\n\nIf you think about it, during the 20s and 30s when Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil were doing well, Mexico didnt even have a professional league. When Brazil hosted the 1950 World Cup, Mexico had only been profesionalized 6 years. They didnt have the infrastructure much less ready to host a WC. CHile already hosted one and had the resources to do so.\n\n- Most of children playing soccer as their main entertainment;\n\nSoccer will always be Mexico's past time, but since the 1950s there was an invasion of American sports such as Baseball (which in many areas is considered a religion), you have other areas where boxing is religion (Mexico is 2nd to the US in terms of WORLD CHAMPIONS produced), basketball is getting very popular. And lets not forget American football. Some of those rivalries in Mexico i would put up against the rivalries they have in soccer. For a while they didnt even let some of those teams play each other because of the rivalries.\n\nSoccer in Mexico really started in 1970. Investors saw the potential of earning a buck and it revolutionized soccer in Mexico. By that time, Brazil had already won 3.\n\n- Great clubs and rivalries in every major city;\n\nWe do have great clubs and the major cities are starting to get invloved.\n\n- Problems with local championship's organization;\n\nthere is always room for improvement, but thats one area we have done well recently. THe Mexican League today is probabaly the most competitive in the continent. Dont confuse that with having the best team. we send clubs that are 9th, 10th in the standings to the Copa Libertaodres and look how they have done. They have more money than any other league. The salaries they pay are amongst the best in all of football\n\n- Good media news and coverage of soccer competitions;\n\nwe do\n\nIn the last 30s years, we have surpassed Bolivia Colombia, Chile, Ecaudor, Paraguay, Peru, Uruaguay, & Venezuela. Our results against them at the national and club level are in our favor.\n\nThe only thing I know that separates Brazil from Mexico is the confederation.\n\nthat is very much true. Copa America is the oldest Cup. Not every team in our federation can host a confederation cup.\n\nWhile Brazil learned how to play competitive soccer with Argentinen and Uruguayan rivalries at 20's and 30's, Mexico always was the main force among weak nations like Haiti, Honduras, Cuba, Canada, Guatemala,...\n\nthats something we really have no control over. And for wanting to improve, we are crippled by our own confederation. Im not against the other feds in the region immproving, but we just cant sit back and wait for all of them.\n\nBut now Mexico are a virtual member of CONMEBOL. Mexico takes part in every Libertadores and Copa America, with good results.\n\nyeah.. in Copa America\n\n93 - runner up\n\n95 - 1st round\n\n97 - 3rd\n\n99 - 3rd\n\n01 - runner up\n\nOur league and nat team have improved alot because of the better competition.\n\nIn the past 10 years, since getting 2nd place, many South Americans were hesitant to say we were a good squad. they thought it was a fluke. Now, the press in south america favors us most of the time. they think highly of our league and our national team. the fans on the other hand still dont want to believe but thats okay.\n\nTough, Mexico continues with its historic bad results in world tournaments like World Cup and Youth Championships... Why!?\n\nwell, we do need to improve, but the last 3 world cups.. we have advanced with teams like Holland, Italy, Belgium, Norway... all mostly with players from our own league.\n\nFor me, it's yet unexplicable the fact that Mexico aren't an world power like Brazil and Argentina...\n\nif you did a little bit more reasearch you would know why. we are atleast 30 years behind.. and yet.. our league is on par and at time better.. and our national team is starting to turn heads.\n\nthe next thing we need to do... is have more players play in Europe. That would mean having to reduce the price tags... which i dont see too many owners doing. the economic problems in south america are also hurting us to in that department because they can get a 2 for 1 deal in South America and Central America\n\nWhen soccer started to come about, Soccer was for the elite. Many clubs in Mexico did not allow Mexicans (either of Euro descent or native) to participate. Some of the better teams in Mexico were clubs like Germania, Espa√±a, British Cricket Club, etc. it was during the revolution when there was a movement to Mexicanize the leagues. Clubs like America, Necaxa, Atlante, Guadalajara moved to have more Mexican players.\n\nThat ocurred in Brazil too. The main clubs in 10's and 20's were Paulistano of Sao Paulo (it's dissidents founded Sao Paulo FC in 1930) and Fluminense of Rio, which didn't admit most of Brazilians to participate. Other clubs like AA Palmeiras (not the actual Palmeiras), Germania (actual Pinheiros, a power of volleyball and athletics today), Flamengo, Botafogo, Am√©rica of Rio did it too.\n\nThe Palestras Italias of Sao Paulo (Palmeiras) and Belo Horizonte (Cruzeiro) only permitted that italian and their ascendents to play on their squads. Gremio didn't want non-germans (the Internacional was founded by two brothers who didn't admitted at Gremio squad).\n\nThe first team that admit negros and mestizos to play was Vasco da Gama, a portuguese colony team in 1924. They were so weak before and Vasco was in Rio's third division. After that, they win the third, the second and the first division in three consecutive years. The other teams scared of Vasco power, then, started to admit native players to their squads.\n\nOnly by late 30's, every native got space in brazilian main clubs. Mostly because of Leonidas da Silva, the first great idol of our soccer, that was coloured.\n\nSoccer will always be Mexico's past time, but since the 1950s there was an invasion of American sports such as Baseball (which in many areas is considered a religion), you have other areas where boxing is religion (Mexico is 2nd to the US in terms of WORLD CHAMPIONS produced), basketball is getting very popular. And lets not forget American football. Some of those rivalries in Mexico i would put up against the rivalries they have in soccer. For a while they didnt even let some of those teams play each other because of the rivalries.\n\nMany brazilian children prefers volleyball and basketball than soccer (Brazil was world champions at 1959 and 1963 in basketball and at 2002 in volleyball). Tough, american sports are hated here. Almost nobody likes american football and ice hockey, because these sports are so violent. And the rules of baseball are so complicated (only members of japanese colony \"plays ball\" here).\n\nAlthough, I have to admit that soccer is a religion here in every place of Brazil. From villages in Amazon, to the Sao Paulo metropolis, almost everybody thinks, breathes and eats soccer. But since 1994, the scenary is changing. World Cup didn't cause the same effect as of 1970s in brazilians. Victories of Guga Kuerten in Tennis and Daiane dos Santos in Artistic Gimnastics are contributing to diminute soccer reignance.\n\nwell, we do need to improve, but the last 3 world cups.. we have advanced with teams like Holland, Italy, Belgium, Norway... all mostly with players from our own league.\n\nAre mexicans not habittued with eliminatory games? Mexico always is the first of its group, but always is eliminated on round of 16. At 1986, everybody expected a great semi-final Brazil - Mexico, but the penalties put France and West Germany on semifinals.\n\nI would like to see Mexico win a World Cup in future. Maybe 2014 or 2018... But, if Mexico didn't plays well neither in youth championships, how to expect that? Ok, Portugal and Saudi Arabia won U-17 and U-20 tourneys in 1990s and they are far from Brazil or Argentina, but it's a start...\n\nI don't agree. I'm not sure I completely disagree, either.\n\nMexico has accomplished a lot. It won the Confed Cup at home, it has won a several Gold Cups, it's success at the Copa America, it's continued advancement from the first round at the World Cup, it's seeming lock in the top 10 in FIFA's rankings.\n\nI think part of Mexico's \"problem\" is more perception than qualitative. Because Mexicans don't play in Europe, they tend to be denigrated. It's the same with the USA. And the relative cheapness with which Brazil and Argentina pump players into Europe, it will continue to be more difficult for Mexicans (and Americans) to move to Europe in numbers.\n\nI'm not convinced that \"playing in Europe\" will necessarily improve the Mexican national team. What it will do - is shine a better light on Mexican soccer and raise its perception in the minds of the Euro-centric world soccer press. I mean Tim Howard is single handedly raising the perception of US soccer around the world, yet his only real national team experience involves a loss to Argentina, a tie against Mexico, and a first round exit at this summer's Confed Cup.\n\nPersonally? I think Mexican soccer is doing quite well. The fact that the rest of the world doesn't recognize that is just something that I, as an American, am quite familiar with.\n\nI admire Mexican soccer for its skill and quickness, but it is pretty clear to me that Mexico's problems begin and end with the athleticism of their players. They are simply not as strong or fast as the USA or big Euro, or Brazilians. Soccer is a sport where strength and speed are not everything, but they are also not nothing.[/\n\nI disagree with that. Athleticism is not what they lack. Part of being a possesion oriented team is being able to hold on to the ball, and holding to the ball means hold your man and push the man off the ball. I dont know about 20 years ago, but the last 10 years, I dont recall a team overpowering them and pushing them off like rag dolls.\n\nWhat seperates a team like Germany from Mexico is the the last pass. Mexico sometimes tends to go forward without an idea. When Germany, Brazil, Italy attack, they attack with some sort of an idea, not just for the sake of passing the ball forward into the opponant backyard. THey dont do it all of the time, but have a tendency of doing it and thats why they can be vulnerable to counter attacks\n\nI compare the Mexican team to a beautiful sports car with a small engine. Looks good, but not enough power to win the big races.\n\nbad anolgy\n\nIf I were the head of the Mexican Fed I would start to address this issu at the youth level and start to identify Mexican players with exceptional speed and power.\n\nTHe problem is that there are too many chiefs and not enough indians in the Fed. You dont have 1 guy that overlooks the whole project. The Head Coach doesnt even have a say with the sub 15-17 teams.\n\nMexican's generally have good skill and awareness, but the \"athleticism\" issue does them in at the highest levels.\n\nTHe past Copa Americas and World Cups where they have played the Brazils, Argentinas, Uruguays, Hollands, Italys, Germanys, they were not over matched from an athletic stndpoint. It had to do with knwoing what to do with that final pass.\n\nThere needs to be one guy in charge and let his style dictate the other youth teams. YOu have one group that plays a certain style and then you have another group that plays another style and when they reach the U23 and the nat team, its chaos. Also, they need to give the Mexican player is litle bit more liberty to create. Too many times a coach will get mad if a player over dribbles. They like to play it safe. Aside from being techincally sound, Brazil is Brazil because of thier ability to lose thier man in a one-on-one basis which then clears up more passing lanes. Mexican coaches need to give thier players more liberty to do that. THey have the ability and the speed to lose their marker, but dont because afraid what the coach will do or say if they do lose the ball\n\nThere is such a thing as too much emphasis on possession - Mexico is the perfect case for this. One thing I notice in Mexican league matches is lots of possession play... and lots of backwards passing where players would rather keep possession than risk losing it to generate a scoring chance. Not a whole lot of counterattacking either - many times players hold the ball back until teammates get forward. There's a whole lot of possession play for the sake of possession play, often without any idea of going to goal.\n\nThis carries over to the national team. Mexico can hold on to the ball forever, against any opposition, which makes them hard to score on. (You can't score if you don't have the ball, after all.) However, they don't really threaten to score either until the opponent makes a mistake. Where ************ says Mexico doesn't know what to do with the final ball, I'd like to submit a subtly different theory: no one's willing to take any risks to deliver that final ball.\n\nI think the problem is fairly pervasive in Mexican soccer culture. When Mexicans denigrate US soccer for being ugly (not saying all Mexicans do, but there's a good number) they usually indicate that they want to see more possession-oriented play. Certainly this was the case after the World Cup match, when so many Mexicans claimed to have been the better team on the basis of possession.\n\nWhile it may be bad form to bring up that match again and again, I think it's fair to say that Mexico needs to rethink that overwhelming emphasis on holding the ball, and especially their insistence on imposing that style of play when it is entirely inappropriate. The US doesn't bunker against Mexico out of an inability to possess the ball; the US bunkers against Mexico because it works very well against such a cautious opponent. In order to be a world power, you have to be able to break a bunker when you face one; in order to break a bunker, you have to be willing to risk losing the ball on a half-chance. I think that's really what Mexico's problems come out to.\n\nGreat thread. I have often wondered about the enigma that is Mexico. Their players certainly have excellent ball skills and technique. They certainly have tremendous poise with the ball. WHEN PLAYING WELL, I think Mexico is one of the best teams in the world BETWEEN THE PENALTY BOXES. Case in point, just look at how they gave the Italians fits during WC02. Italy could not get the ball. It was amazing.\n\nI tend to agree that their \"undoing\" so to speak has to do with that last pass. They tend get to the penalty box pass it around and hope that something good happens. This of course is a bit of a generalization. I definitly agree with the earlier post saying that they should not be afraid to try to dribble past a defender. They have the skills to do so; there seems to be some sort of mental block.\n\nAlso the lack of height has hurt them in the past. Another big problem is their complete inablity to take PKs. In 86 and 94 they outplayed IMHO their opponents only to loses on PK. (if Holland and Mex ever went to PKs, would anybody ever score???) In 98 they outplayed Germany IMHO only to lose (lack of height). Of course that is what most good teams do against Germany.\n\nHaving said all of that, their tournament results are pretty damn good. They are great in Copa America and a consistent second round team in the WC. Most countries would kill for that. AND they are on track to be a seeded team in WC06. Perhaps they need to bring in a foreign coach to take them to the next level. They already have great ball skills so I would suggest a coach from Brazil or Argentina. Perhaps they should try to get Pekerman to take over their program.\n\nWell said, and I agree whole-heartedly. They are a good team, sometimes a very good team. The real question is, what keeps them from being a world-power with the big 4?\n\nthis is a good discussion and they are all good points.However I still think that athleticism is the issue, overall.I am not saying that the Mexican team is not athletic, but rather that there is a small gap that makes a difference in big games.When the USA plays Mexico, one never fears( if one is a USA fan), that some player will hit a rocket from 30 yards and score.But against Italy or Germany, you had better be afraid of that.In modern soccer, size matters, strength matters, speed matters.The Mexican team is a little smaller, and a little slower and a little less powerful.\n\nI suspect that these issues we are discussing are closely related. For example, if you have a small gap in athleticism, the wway to play is skillful, quick ball, with short passes- using you agility. But for a team like the USA, which is very athletic, but has only moderate skill, the way to play is to stay organized, win the ball and then make it a 50 yard sprint to the other goal. It is like the movie \"Groundhog Day \" watching the USA and Mexico play.I admire Mexican soccer, but most games end up with a Yank sprinting 50 yards to goal.\n\nOne last thought : I feel strongly that the USA can't reach the top without a big push in CONCACAF, and it is Mexico that will provide that push. I would love to see many more collaborations between Mexico and the USA. More loans, more club matches."
