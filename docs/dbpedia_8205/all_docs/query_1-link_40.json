Its histopathology shows keratin-filled crypts, and its etiology is linked with HPV, especially 11 and 16 subtypes.

We report a case of a woman with Cuniculatum carcinoma treated with surgery with perioperative frozen section procedure, graft, and good evolution.\n\nKeywords: Carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Foot\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer, behind only basal cell carcinoma.1 Carcinoma cuniculatum (CC) is a verrucous carcinoma (VC), a rare and indolent form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), well differentiated. Slow growth, local aggressiveness, and low capacity to cause metastasis characterize it. It penetrates the deep tissues, forming crypts filled with keratin.2,3\n\nIt was first described in 1954 by Aird et al.1, 5 It is more common in men than in women (5:1). Its pathogenesis has not been completely elucidated, but the association with human papillomavirus (HPV), especially subtypes 11 and 16, has been described.5,6\n\nThe treatment of choice is surgical excision with margin control, and the patient must be regularly monitored for the risk of recurrences, even when the surgical margins are free.6\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 64-year-old woman, working as a sales clerk, sought medical care due to a lesion in the left plantar region two years ago, with a foul odor and associated local pain. The physical examination observed an exophytic lesion with a verrucous surface, 5 cm in diameter, with an infiltrated and ulcerated border (Figures 1 and 2). The image examination, X-ray of the left foot, showed a nodular image with a radiotransparent halo in soft tissues in the plantar region, without bone involvement (Figure 3).\n\nA biopsy was performed based on the suggested hypotheses of VC, keratoacanthoma, common wart, and amelanotic melanoma. The result favored the diagnosis of VC. Excisional surgery was then scheduled with histopathological evaluation by perioperative frozen section. The report indicated a well-differentiated SCC, focally invasive, reaching the middle dermis, with no perineural infiltration or angiolymphatic invasion, and free surgical margins (Figures 4 and 5).\n\nAfter the lesion’s complete excision, skin grafting was obtained from the abdominopelvic fold (Figura 6), and a fragment was sent for HPV research, with a positive result for type 16.\n\nThe patient evolved with good graft healing and subsequent return to daily activities. After 1.5 years of follow-up, we observed no lesion recurrence.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCC is a VC, a rare and indolent form of SCC. It usually has characteristics of a benign, verrucous tumor, with slow growth, more expansive than invasive evolutionary pattern, good cell differentiation, and low tendency to metastasis.2,7\n\nAlthough its most common site is in the plantar region, it can occur in several other areas, such as the flank, legs, face, oral cavity, genital, and palmar region.4 It is called CC when it is located in the plantar area; Buschke-Lowenstein tumor, in the anogenital region; and Ackerman’s tumor, when in the oral region.3,8\n\nIt was first described in 1954 by Aird et al.1, 5 It is more common in men than in women (5:1)5 – what makes the report of this case even rarer because it is a female patient. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but the association with human papillomavirus (HPV), especially subtypes 11 and 16, has been described,6 as identified in the case above.\n\nDiagnosis is based on dermatological and histopathological examination.5,6 This carcinoma should be suspected when the patient has a recurrent lesion on usual therapy. The differential diagnosis is made with common wart and keratoacanthoma.6,9\n\nWe observed scaly proliferation with papillomatosis and dyskeratosis in histopathology, a high degree of cell differentiation, without atypia. Keratin pseudocysts can be formed, sometimes with pus, generating a foul odor.3\n\nThe treatment of choice is surgical excision with margin control, and the patient must be regularly monitored for the risk of recurrences, even when free margins are obtained.6,7 In the case reported, we opted for surgery with a perioperative frozen section to control the margins and perform a graft on the patient’s abdomen, with Brown dressing. The patient has been in follow-up for more than two years without recurrence so far.\n\nAUTHORS 'CONTRIBUTION:\n\nAndré Ricardo Adriano | 0000-0002-2986-959X Approval of the final version of the manuscript; study design and planning; preparation and writing of the manuscript; data collection, analysis, and interpretation; active participation in research orientation; intellectual participation in propaedeutic and/or therapeutic conduct of studied cases; critical literature review; critical revision of the manuscript.\n\nJordano Luiz da Costa | 0000-0003-1635-6944 Preparation and writing of the manuscript.\n\nJuliano Borges | 0000-0001-8291-0806 Critical literature review; critical revision of the manuscript.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
