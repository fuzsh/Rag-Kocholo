Handball, as we know it today, found fertile ground in Brazil to grow and develop the best Brazilian handball players of all time, thanks to the pioneering efforts of enthusiasts passionate about the sport. Although its arrival in Brazil dates back to the 1930s, initially restricted to São Paulo, it was Professor Augusto Listello who played a crucial role in spreading this exciting sport throughout the country.

However, an important milestone occurred in 1954, when the Paulista Handball Federation organized the first open tournament in the city of São Paulo. This event not only consolidated handball’s popularity in one of the country’s largest cities, but also served as a catalyst for creating the best Brazilian handball players of all time.

Imagine the scenario at the time: a much less connected Brazil, with huge logistical challenges, but with a gigantic desire to integrate different regions through sport. Listello, with his vision and dedication, took advantage of the growing popularity of handball to travel from north to south, promoting the sport, training teachers and organizing competitions.

The result? A seed planted in Brazilian soil that germinated and grew, making handball one of the most beloved sports in the country and building the best Brazilian handball players of all time.
