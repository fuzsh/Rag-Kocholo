        "text": "In the early 2000s, one of the biggest reality shows that everyone talked about was easily, America’s Next Top Model, also known as ANTM. The controversial show was created and hosted by supermodel Tyra Banks, and it was all about finding America’s next biggest model. The show consisted of numerous models who had to do weekly challenges, photoshoots, and more to impress the A-list judges.\n\nThe show first aired in May 2003, and had 24 seasons until it was unexpectedly wrapped in late 2018. During that time, 24 models were crowned “America’s Next Top Model.” While quite a few winners went on to model for some time after that, and continue to model to this day, most actually went down different avenues.\n\nSome became actors, while others focused on their family life. Some winners even disappeared entirely from the public eye, while others focused on their love of the arts like writing, painting, and more.\n\nChances are, if you watched the show, and think about it today, you may be asking yourself: “What are the winners doing today?”\n\nWell, we did some digging and found out what the beloved winners are doing in 2024.\n\nBelow, check out what the winners of ANTM are doing today."
