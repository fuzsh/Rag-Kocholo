After the season ended, Curry and fellow house guest Knight began dating, and later moved in together. On September 11, 2005, VH1 began airing My Fair Brady, a show that documented their life together[3] and paid her an estimated US$450,000. The show led her to being featured in Maxim's Hot 100, a list of the \"hottest\" women on earth[4] and ranked #100 on the Maxim Hot 100 Women of 2005.[5]\n\nCurry was a co-host on the television game show Ballbreakers.

She has also starred in the films Fallen Angels, Light Years Away and \"Jack Rio.\"[3]\n\nSeason 3 of My Fair Brady began airing on January 21, 2008 and focused on Curry's breast enhancement surgery and Knight's competing (and contrary) desire to start a family.[3] In June 2008, Curry and her family and friends appeared on NBC's Celebrity Family Feud. Between November and December 2010, Curry worked as the \"Resident Celebrity Gamer\" panelist judge on the second series of The Tester, a reality program on the PlayStation Network.
