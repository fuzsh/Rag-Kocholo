        "text": "America's Next Top Model alum Adrianne Curry has sparked discussion on social media after asking questions about the purported scarcity of clips from Donald Trump's reality show The Apprentice.\n\nThe former model now goes by Curry-Rhode since marrying voice actor Matthew Rhode in 2018.\n\nThe NBC reality contest transformed Trump into a major celebrity following its debut in 2004. Trump, who was the show's host for 14 seasons before entering the political arena, would whittle through a list of contestants who vied to land roles under his corporate umbrella.\n\n\"You're fired,\" which was Trump's booming boardroom announcement at the conclusion of each elimination round, became a catchphrase of the time, and was emulated in reworded fashion by a number of other reality shows that also hoped to shape the zeitgeist.\n\nHowever, former model Curry, who won the first cycle of ANTM in 2003, suggested that a conspiracy was afoot as she questioned why clips from Trump's long-running show do not dominate social media and aren't as readily available as those of others.\n\nSharing a throwback video clip on X on June 9, formerly Twitter, of Trump speaking to Oprah Winfrey back in the 1980s about one day running for president, Curry wrote: \"Why are all of Trump's reality shows and clips scrubbed from apps. Etc?\n\n\"Apprentice was a powerhouse. Why can't people watch it like they watch MY old stuff? Trump is/was a mega star. It's like they want to pretend he isn't/wasn't.\"\n\n\"They don't want to admit that they all loved him prior to 2016,\" one X user responded, referring to the year that Trump won his first term as president.\n\n\"I mean, why is MY stuff everywhere and HIS isn't?\" Curry wrote back. \"I am barely a blip on the celeb radar in comparison.\"\n\nHowever, other social media users pointed out that fans of the show can watch it on Tubi. Seasons of the TV franchise, including the celebrity incarnation, have been available on the free streaming service since 2019.\n\n\"I've never even heard of Tubi!\" Curry said when informed of the platform, adding: \"I have to tell my reality TV junkie cousin. He's a huge Apprentice fan.\"\n\nClips from the show are also seen on various platforms across social media. On July 8, Barstool host Jeff D. Lowe commented on a video clip from the series that showed Trump questioning a contestant about his sexuality.\n\n\"I might have to go back and rewatch the first few seasons of THE APPRENTICE,\" Lowe wrote. \"Great reality competition television. The contestants were usually nastier to each other than Trump was. Like most game shows or reality shows, it hurt when they went to celebrity format.\"\n\nLowe added a clip of the show's opening credits, which included the classic track \"For the Love of Money\" by The O'Jays and featured Trump.\n\n\"Elite 2000's reality show intro, too,\" Lowe commented. \"The no attention span generations have ruined most TV show intros/themes.\"\n\nYouTube hosts a plethora of highlights from The Apprentice, that have millions of views between them. Among them are clips bearing such titles as \"Donald Trump's Meanest The Apprentice Moments,\" \"The Apprentice—The Entire 2nd Season In 10 Minutes,\" \"The Apprentice's Strangest Boardroom Discussion,\" and \"Donald Trump—Biggest Firing Ever!\"\n\nA host of stars have competed on The Celebrity Apprentice over the years, with winners including Joan Rivers, Arsenio Hall, Bret Michaels, Piers Morgan, Trace Adkins, John Rich, and Leeza Gibbons.\n\nThe show reentered the public conversation last month on the release of Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass, a book written by Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh that delves into behind-the-scenes details of the reality contest.\n\nOne of the more unexpected elements of the book, which was released on June 18, reveals how Trump spoke about Will & Grace star Debra Messing on several occasions when being interviewed for the book, asking questions about her and revealing that he found her attractive.\n\nIt was also stated that Trump would speak of Messing's \"beautiful red hair\" and describe her as \"quite attractive\" on \"multiple occasions.\" He also depicted her as traitorous. Trump said that Messing once praised him and his show, which was created by Mark Burnett. Messing is now known to be a vocal critic of the former president.\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, has since denounced the book and its author.\n\n\"After recognizing the importance of The Apprentice and its significant cultural impact on a global scale, this 'writer' has now chosen to allow Trump Derangement Syndrome to rot his brain like so many other losers whose entire existence revolves around President Trump,\" Cheung said in a statement."
