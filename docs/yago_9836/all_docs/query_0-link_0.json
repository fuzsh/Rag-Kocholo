        "text": "They say opposites attract. And in the case of Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight, it couldn't be more accurate. Curry was a rags to riches story who with the help of an unlikely reality television experiment found fame and fortune. Knight was a child star looking for a big comeback when they first locked eyes. Curry's fame came when she was crowned the season 1 winner of America's Next Top Model. Tyra Banks knew she could turn Curry into a supermodel the moment she saw her. Knight is known most for his role on the beloved family sitcom The Brady Bunch as Peter Brady. Though the relationship appeared odd, to them, it made sense.\n\nIt was a whirlwind, and the world brought into the fairytale ending. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't stand the test of time. However, it's one of Hollywood's greatest love stories and one that was heavily documented in the beginning of the reality television phenomenon.\n\nDespite the quick romance, Curry later claimed it wasn't all roses. She alleged Knight made fun of her appearance, joking that one of her breasts were bigger than the other, per Daily Mail. She also claims that despite Knight filing for divorce, he tried to reconcile just months later by sending a text that detailed how much he missed her. She ignored it. Here's what fans should remember about the Knight and Curry era.\n\nThey didn't remain friends for long after the split\n\nSince Curry, Knight has married three more times. In a recent interview with InTouch, Curry noted she's not on amicable terms with her ex. In Touch. \"I wish him well in his life,\" she said. \"I remember before I walked away, I was just like, you know, 'You should stop marrying people. You're not good at it.' And he's like, 'I totally agree. I'm not a good husband.' And boy, did he just jump right back into that. Have a fantastic life far away from me.\""
