See About archive blog posts.\n\n‘My Fair Brady’ stars Christopher Knight and Adrianne Curry have split, calling it quits on their fifth wedding anniversary.\n\n‘After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated,’ the couple’s manager Phil Viardo said in a statement. ‘The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union.’\n\nThe separation, announced Sunday, came as no shocker to Curry’s Twitter followers who saw her tweet earlier in the week, ‘I am Mrs knight the III, and most likely not the last.’ She posted again Monday, saying, ‘So yeah, guess you heard about my ...-up life......its ok...we arent fighting...no matter what happens, we will know we put our best in.’\n\nThe split was also no big surprise to anyone who watched the VH1 show ‘My Fair Brady,’ the reality show about the rocky relationship between 53-year-old Knight, who played Peter Brady on ‘The Brady Bunch,’ and 28-year-old Curry, the first ‘America’s Next Top Model’ winner.\n\nThe couple met on ‘The Surreal Life’ in 2005, and the resulting romance blossomed in front of millions of reality-TV viewers.\n\n‘Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship,’ Viardo said in the statement, released to Hollyscoop. ‘They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future.’\n\nHer reality-TV marriage may not have worked out, but at least Curry can find solace in a fantasy world. She told RPG pals that she’d be back in the game soon.\n\n‘To all my wonderful guildies,’ she tweeted Monday, ‘now ya know why i havent been on warcraft. i shall return to you soon!’\n\nRELATED:\n\nGinnifer Goodwin, Joey Kern have broken off engagement\n\nSingle ‘Spider-Man’: Andrew Garfield and Shannon Woodward split\n\nEmily Maynard makes ‘Bachelor’ Brad Womack a bachelor once again"
