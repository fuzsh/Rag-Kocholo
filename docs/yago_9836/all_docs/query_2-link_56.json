        "text": "America's Next Top Model aired for an incredible 24 seasons, introducing wannabe supermodels to the rollercoaster world of fashion. In recent weeks, the show has been subjected to increased attention, with fans looking at historic episodes and questioning if host and head judge Tyra Banks went too far in the name of entertainment. In fact, she has acknowledged the controversy herself in something on an apology post.But wherever you sit in that camp, Tyra is not the only person who could be said to have exploited the young participants for entertainment. Last month Adrianne Curry, the original America's Next Top Model champion, addressed the trappings of entering the showbiz world.\n\nAdrianne rode the wave of fame after her win in 2003, booking campaigns and editorial shoots all over the world. Now, however, she lives in Montana with her husband, sells Avon products and runs a blog. It is a fascinating glimpse into the life of a former top model, and in her most recent post she explains how becoming a subject of ridicule on an unnamed blog - 'It was a play off of a famous celebrity Heiress', she writes - which, she writes, affected her greatly.\n\n'I think I would be lying if I said this kind of negative pressure in my life didn’t have a huge impact on me', she explains. 'I became more and more bitter and angry….hating LA and everyone in it. I drank, smoked weed and generally stewed in anger and rejection. People would say “Like, oh my god! You are like, so bitter and junk! What is like, wrong with you?” Let's see YOU endure years of shit like this on a grand scale as I did. Then come to me and let me know how utterly amazing your life is.'\n\nAfter years of pain, Adrianne - whose striking looks and rockstar attitude won her legions of fans, as well as the title - has found a place of inner calm and can look at her former fame with the benefit of hindsight.\n\n'Fame is a worthless comodity', she writes. 'It fills no voids, heals no wounds and is only a moment of feeling good. My life now has so much less stress, it is as if I live entireles stress free. I think the pressure and scrutiny I used to endure prepped me for this life I have chosen now to be an actual form of heaven on earth. For that, I am grateful. I walked amongst the wolves and escaped with a few survivable injuries. Not many can say that.'\n\nEvidently there is more to life than being on top."
