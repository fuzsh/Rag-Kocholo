        "text": "2018 seems to be the year of secret celebrity weddings, and model and TV personality Adrianne Curry is the latest star to pull off an under-the-radar celebration.\n\nThe America’s Next Top Model winner, 36, wed new husband Matthew Rhode earlier this month in an intimate Game of Thrones-inspired wedding. The pair eloped to Glacier National Park in Montana to tie the knot on September 15. With only their wedding photographer in attendance, the new couple celebrated their marriage with a small, ultra-private ceremony. The newlyweds announced their engagement back in August 2017.\n\nThe low-key nuptials come as no surprise given Curry’s retreat from the spotlight in recent months. The first ever America’s Next Top Model winner has kept a low profile since leaving Hollywood for her new home in Montana earlier this year, documenting her post-Hollywood life with new husband Rhode on her lifestyle blog. So who is Matthew Rhode? Read on for details about the former model’s low-profile new husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. You might recognize his voice\n\nRhode is a voice actor who has been featured in many movie trailers, TV commercials, and network promotions. He has also done voice work for various films and TV shows. You can hear his voice at the end of this trailer for the summer's box office hit Crazy Rich Asians.\n\n2. He’s a Kentucky native\n\nRhode grew up in Louisville and later moved to New York to pursue an acting career. He graduated from the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater.\n\n3. He’s a gamer\n\nRhode was a premium partner of Twitch.tv, a live streaming service for gamers. He also provided voice work for 2013’s Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. You might know him by the name “Ducksauce”\n\nThe quirky moniker is the name he uses for his Twitch.tv broadcasts.\n\n5. His new wife credits him with changing her life ... and her last name\n\n“Everything I thought my life was…everything I used to think was important…wasn’t. I quit smoking weed after 20 years of smoking all day every day (doing anything THAT much is called ABUSING it), I stopped marketing myself with cleavage, short shorts and titillating men with my body. Why? I finally had a man who respected me and respected HIMSELF,” Curry wrote of her new husband in a lengthy blog post about their wedding. Curry also plans to take her new husband's last name, which she announced in an Instagram post back in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Not everyone was supportive of his recent marriage\n\nIn the same blog post, Curry explained that the couple chose to have an ultra-private ceremony “for a few reasons,” including “not many people being excited for our wedding.” While Curry did not elaborate, she noted that people opposed the couple’s career and lifestyle changes.\n\n7. He’s 36, the same age as Curry\n\nThe couple’s shared age is in marked contrast to the 25-year age difference between Curry and ex-husband Christopher Knight. The pair wed in 2006, when Curry was 23 and Knight was 48. They divorced in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKayla Kibbe is a writer wrapping up her final semester at Connecticut College where she is an English major with a concentration in creative writing.
