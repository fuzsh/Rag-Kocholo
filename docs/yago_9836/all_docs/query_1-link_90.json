        "text": "Another Hollywood couple has called it quits. Brady Bunch star Christopher Knight, 53, and Adrianne Curry, 28, have decided to go their separate ways.\n\nThe couple’s long time friend and manager Phil Viardo announced the news exclusively to Hollyscoop. Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the couple chose to announce their decision to split on the fifth anniversary of their May 29, 2006 wedding.\n\nViardo released the following statement on behalf of the couple: “Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort than a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future.”\n\nAdrianne, an accomplished model, won the first season of America’s Next Top Model. Together they appeared on the VH1 show The Surreal Life and later landed their own reality show My Fair Brady.\n\nPhoto Credit: Fayes Vision / WENN"
