She was named one of Maxim's Hot 100, Playboy's 25 Sexiest Celebrities and was even anointed \"Queen of the Nerds\" by none other than Stan Lee himself.\n\nDespite finding immense success in her career, she grew jaded with the business over time. Adrianne wanted to do something more fulfilling and completely different than the path she had been on in entertainment for over a decade. Now, she's ready to start a new adventure out of the spotlight.\n\nLiving in that world was the hardest thing I've ever done. I am proud I chose love and life over the temporary void filler that is fame. Realizing that she doesn't need to live in Hollywood to accomplish this, she-along with husband Matthew Rhode-decided to eschew the big city for the great outdoors and are loving every minute of it.\n\nShortly after, during some post-surgery downtime, Adrianne watched Edward Scissorhands and signed up to sell Avon while a little loopy on pain killers. When her Avon kit arrived, she began trying out products on Facebook live-streams to pass her recovery time. She instantly fell in love with what she was doing. She realized that she's much happier helping people find frugal fashion and makeup that looks amazing than she was in the entertainment industry. Since then, she has turned down every Hollywood offer that has come her way, focusing on growing her business and living a less stressful life.\n\nLife After Hollywood- Adrianne's official website - follows Adrianne Curry as she leaves the fast-paced world of Hollywood for the serenity of Montana."
