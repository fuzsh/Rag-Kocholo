        "text": "The couple eloped in a Game of Thrones-esque wedding at the picturesque Glacier National Park in Montana. It was only their photographer, Brooke Stevens-Patrick who was with them and who officiated. Adrianne wore a gold and beige Grecian style gown that made her look like a khaleesi. Matthew wore a cowboy hat, a suit vest and trousers.\n\nThe model opened up on her website and explained why she chose to have a small wedding instead of a big shindig. “The stress and agony of wedding planning is just not for me. We wanted an intimate and meaningful wedding. People opposed our career changes, our life changes, etc. It made sense to just do the thing in a personal way and save for our future.”\n\nAdrianne posted this photo of her and her hubby and revealed that she will be adding his last name and attach it to her maiden name. She wrote, \"I am going to legally take his last name. I have always been againt losing my idenity...and the hassle of paperwork and legalities to achieve a name change....but I think this picture convinced me it's worth it. #couplesgoals #couples #weddingbells#marriageisforever #marriagematerial.\""
