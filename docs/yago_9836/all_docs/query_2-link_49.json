        "text": "01 of 24\n\nAdrianne Curry (Cycle 1)\n\nIllinois-born Adrianne Curry became the country's first-ever next top model when the show aired its Cycle 1 finale on July 15, 2003. The laid-back brunette, then 20, modeled Baby Phat in the final challenge and beat out fellow finalists Shannon Stewart and Elyse Sewell to take home the crown.\n\nWhile Curry did pursue a modeling career after the show, she is perhaps best known for her TV work. The star, who covered Playboy and booked a few ad campaigns in the mid-2000s, signed on for the fourth season of The Surreal Life, where she met and started dating Brady Bunch alum Christopher Knight. The two would go on to star on their own VH1 reality spin-off, My Fair Brady (2005–08), which followed the couple's engagement, wedding, and first year of marriage. They finalized their divorce in 2012.\n\nCurry continued her reality turn, appearing on PlayStation Network's The Tester in 2010 and 2012 and making cameos on Hello Ross!, Dr. Drew on Call, and L.A. Hair throughout 2014. However, Curry has stepped out of the spotlight, married voice actor Matthew Rhode, and frequently posts life updates on her Instagram.\n\n02 of 24\n\nYoanna House (Cycle 2)\n\nYoanna House was the next top model after Curry, winning the second cycle of ANTM in 2004. Known for her classic beauty and serious drive, the then-23-year-old Floridian beat out Mercedes Scelba-Shorte and Shandi Sullivan in the final days of the competition to win a modeling contract.\n\nHouse is still actively modeling. The reality alum walked in Michael Costello's Fall/Winter 2015 fashion show at New York Fashion Week and appeared on HSN as a brand ambassador in 2015. She also hosted the N's reality series Queen Bees in 2008 and reunited with her former ANTM judge on The Tyra Banks Show multiple times throughout the 2000s. In 2020, she did a tell-all interview with Oliver Twixt about her experience on ANTM.\n\n03 of 24\n\nEva Marcille (Cycle 3)\n\nOne of the more memorable ANTM contestants, Eva Marcille won the third cycle in 2004. At 5 feet 6 inches tall, the then-20-year-old L.A. native was particularly short for a winner, but still managed to edge out Yaya DaCosta and Amanda Swafford at the finale in Japan.\n\nEva Marcille Pigford, who later dropped her last name, was a busy model throughout the 2000s, appearing in magazines, ad campaigns, and runway shows. Marcille kept up with her reality TV roots, placing fifth on the VH1 horror competition show Scared Famous, and becoming a main cast member on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for two seasons.\n\nHowever, she eventually turned her main attention to acting, nabbing starring roles as Tyra Hamilton on The Young and the Restless and Marilyn \"Madam\" DeVille on BET+'s All the Queen's Men, as well as big-screen roles with 2013's 24 Hour Love and 2015's Sister Code. She returned to reality TV on the Peacock reality series The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.\n\n04 of 24\n\nNaima Mora (Cycle 4)\n\nBorn in Detroit, Naima Mora won ANTM's fourth cycle in 2005 when she was 21 years old. A leader throughout the competition, Mora impressed on a water-covered final runway and beat out Kahlen Rondot and Keenyah Hill.\n\nMora now describes herself as a \"musician, vocalist, author, model, teacher, and public speaker.\" The star penned Model Behavior, a motivational guide that was released as an e-book in 2012 and in paperback one year later, released several music videos on her YouTube channel, and launched several online workshops for aspiring models. Mora still regularly walks in fashion shows and shoots ad campaigns.\n\n05 of 24\n\nNicole Linkletter (Cycle 5)\n\nA famously polarizing contestant, Nicole Linkletter won the show's fifth cycle at the age of 20. Taking home the title in 2005, the North Dakota-born model beat Nik Pace and frenemy Bre Scullark.\n\nShying away from ANTM after her win, Linkletter made no further appearances on the show, but grew a successful modeling career. She had ad campaigns for Forever 21, various runway gigs, editorial spreads, and a contract with L.A. Models to her name.\n\n06 of 24\n\nDanielle \"Dani\" Evans (Cycle 6)\n\nAn Arkansas-born model with the accent to match, Danielle Evans won the sixth cycle of ANTM in 2006. Then 21 years old, Evans made a name for herself with her strong photos and fun personality. She beat out Joanie Dodds and Jade Cole to win the finale in Thailand.\n\nNow under Elite Model Management, Evans has continued to model, booking ad campaigns for New York & Company and Talbots, and walking runways for Nicholas K and Pyer Moss. She expanded her career by publishing 2013's The Skinny on Getting In: An Inside Peek Into the Fashion World for the Aspiring Model and launching her unisex hat-wear brand, Monrowe, in 2018.\n\nIn 2020, controversial clips of Tyra Banks instructing Evans to fix her teeth gap resurfaced, for which Banks later issued an apology.\n\n07 of 24\n\nCariDee English (Cycle 7)\n\nThe title of Top Model went to CariDee English in 2006's seventh cycle. Born in Fargo, N.D., the 5-foot-11-inch beauty performed well throughout the competition, however, found herself in hot water after making a questionable joke to judge Nigel Barker. She still managed to come out on top, beating Melrose Bickerstaff and Eugena Washington to win it in the end.\n\nEnglish continues to model and has appeared in ads for NightLift lingerie and Ray-Ban. She has also expanded her television résumé, with a 2009 gig as the host of Lifetime's Pretty Wicked, and cameos on One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, and Betrayed.\n\n08 of 24\n\nJaslene Gonzalez (Cycle 8)\n\nJaslene Gonzalez was 21 years old when she won the eighth cycle of America's Next Top Model in 2007. The Puerto Rico-born beauty found success after trying out for the previous cycle. She beat Natasha Galkina — now better known as Natalie Gal — and Renee Alway to book the prize of a Seventeen spread and a modeling contract.\n\nAn active runway and print model years later, Gonzalez spends time mentoring the next generation of models through her \"empowerment course,\" On Set With Jaslene, while also running her jewelry line, Starlite by J. She's also made TV appearances on The Tyra Banks Show, Oxygen's Running Russell Simmons, and Chicago Fire.\n\n09 of 24\n\nSaleisha Stowers (Cycle 9)\n\nANTM found its ninth winner in Saleisha Stowers in 2007. The then-21-year-old star won out against Chantal Jones and Jenah Doucette, taking home the title at the finale in China.\n\nStowers parlayed her Top Model win into a successful acting career. Though she spent the years immediately following the show modeling for magazines and walking occasional runways, she booked a 2012 gig on TV Land's The Exes, expanding her résumé from there with cameos on New Girl, Switched at Birth, The Fosters, a starring role as Cassandra Foster on All My Children, and a regular series role as Lani on Days of Our Lives.\n\n10 of 24\n\nWhitney Thompson (Cycle 10)\n\nWhitney Thompson became the first plus-size winner of ANTM when she took home the Cycle 10 title. The Floridian, who was 20 at the time, beat out Anya Kop and Fatima Siad in the final challenges before winning in May 2008.\n\nLike many of her fellow contestants, Thompson modeled for ad campaigns immediately after ANTM but slowed her schedule over the years. The former reality star's focus is now on Craft 850, her highly-rated, \"casual fine-dining\" restaurant in Panama City, Fla.\n\n11 of 24\n\nMcKey Sullivan (Cycle 11)\n\nIllinois-born McKey Sullivan was just 19 years old when she won the reality show's 11th cycle. She beat out Samantha Potter and Lio Tipton, the latter of whom is one of the most famous stars to come out of the show.\n\nSullivan has yet to achieve the same level of fame that second runner-up Tipton is seeing. She had a busy few years in the late-2000s, walking in runway shows during New York Fashion Week and booking sporadic ad campaigns. She is now the wife of MMA fighter Sam Alvey, with whom she has five children.\n\n12 of 24\n\nTeyona Anderson (Cycle 12)\n\nIn 2009, 20-year-old Teyona Anderson barely edged out fellow finalists Allison Harvard and Aminat Ayinde to win the 12th cycle. The New Jersey native was on top throughout much of the competition, finally taking the crown at the finale in Brazil.\n\nNow known professionally as Teyona Asia Anderson or Asia Anderson, the model saw success in Cape Town, walking runways at the city's Fashion Week and gaining representation in South Africa.\n\n13 of 24\n\nNicole Fox (Cycle 13)\n\nCompeting in the special cycle for models of shorter stature, 5-foot-7-inch Nicole Fox won the title of Top Model in 2009's 13th iteration. Just 18 years old at the time, the Coloradan edged out Laura Kirkpatrick and Erin Wagner to take the title.\n\nFox continued to model after the show, landing ad campaigns with Forever 21 and Steve Madden, among others, and picking up representation from Paragon Model Management. The redheaded beauty also pursued an acting career, lining up credits that include a 2011 turn on The Bold and the Beautiful, a starring role in 2013's Ashley, and bit parts in 2015's Tag and 2017's Circus Kane.\n\n14 of 24\n\nKrista White (Cycle 14)\n\nKrista White, 24, took home the title of Top Model in 2010's 14th cycle. Beating out Raina Hein, Alexandra Underwood, and Angelea Preston, the Arkansas-born model found her footing toward the end of the competition, winning the final few challenges.\n\nWhile she has been less active as of late, White booked modeling gigs after the show, walking in BET's Rip the Runway in 2011 and appearing in presentations as part of Fall/Winter 2011 New York Fashion Week. Her other work includes appearances for DLXVRSN magazine, where she served as fashion director.\n\n15 of 24\n\nAnn Ward (Cycle 15)\n\nIn 2010, 19-year-old Ann Ward was named the winner of America's Next Top Model's 15th cycle. The Texan beat out Chelsey Hersley and Jane Randall at the finale in Italy.\n\nWard now works as an artist, filling her Instagram and Twitter accounts with her sketches and illustrations. She's withdrawn from modeling to solely focus on her passion for graphic design, creating concepts for animes, comic books, mobile apps, and more.\n\n16 of 24\n\nBrittani Kline (Cycle 16)\n\nBrittani Kline, who was 19 at the time, won big in 2011, taking home the title of Top Model during the show's 16th cycle. Born in Pennsylvania, she topped runners-up Molly O'Connell and Hannah Jones.\n\nIn 2013, Kline modeled under Roman Management and Premiere Models. She regularly appeared in ad campaigns and magazines while pursuing her bachelor's degree at Lock Haven University. Since graduating in 2015 and becoming a mother in 2017, Kline no longer models.\n\n17 of 24\n\nLisa D'Amato (Cycle 17)\n\nThe outspoken Lisa D'Amato beat out other major alums to win the 17th cycle, also known as America's Next Top Model: All Stars. The then-30-year-old star, who first appeared in Cycle 5, was picked over fellow finalists Allison Harvard and Angelea Preston.\n\nD'Amato models from time to time and she's also pursued a singing career with the release of multiple albums and one-off singles. However, D'Amato primarily focuses on her social media and being a mother to her two sons.\n\nD'Amato also appeared on Shark Tank in 2019 for her reusable bib company, Dare-U-Go!, which landed her a business deal with Barbara Corcoran. She's also politically active online with her pole-itics page, in which she merges pole dancing with partisan rants about society and the government.\n\n18 of 24\n\nSophie Sumner (Cycle 18)\n\nThe 18th cycle of ANTM brought in America's Next Top Model: British Invasion and with it came Oxford, England-born winner Sophie Sumner. The then-21-year-old beauty took home the title in 2012, edging out American Laura LaFrate and fellow Brit Annaliese Dayes.\n\nSumner, who appeared on the show after competing on Britain's Next Top Model, tried her hand at music in 2012 with the release of a single as she continued to model. The star went on to work as a contributing editor to The Daily Front Row and style host for Amazon Live.\n\n19 of 24\n\nLaura James (Cycle 19)\n\nIn 2012, Laura James was named the winner of America's Next Top Model: College Edition, the reality show's 19th cycle. Then a student at Paul Smith's College, the New Yorker beat Kiara Belen and Leila Goldkuhl.\n\nThe reality star has transitioned to acting as well, booking roles in Axcellerator (2020) and A California Christmas: City Lights (2021), appearing on The Young and the Restless and NCIS: Hawai'i, and starring as Molly Hicks on S.W.A.T.\n\n20 of 24\n\nJourdan Miller (Cycle 20)\n\nCycle 20 of ANTM, also known as America's Next Top Model: Guys & Girls crowned 19-year-old Jourdan Miller as its winner.

Competing in America's Next Top Model: Guys & Girls, the 26-year-old Connecticut native won an all-male top three, beating out Will Jardel and Adam Smith.\n\nCarlos, who had a brief stint in the NFL before the reality show, continues to model and act. \"I've built a legit team, been doing a lot of hosting, going to red carpet events, interviewing to build my brand, preparing to relocate to Los Angeles, and got a movie role in the upcoming film, Another Hollywood Tragedy,\" he told View the Vibe in April 2015.\n\nIn addition to doing modeling work for Adidas, Men's Wearhouse, and more, he starred in a Cardi B music video in 2018, appeared on The Bold and the Beautiful and The Young and the Restless, and became a brand ambassador for FashionNova's NovaMEN.\n\n22 of 24\n\nNyle DiMarco (Cycle 22)\n\nBefore competing for ANTM's' new prize of a $100,000 contract with Zappos, Nyle DiMarco played a recurring role on Freeform's Switched at Birth. Being the first deaf contestant on America's Next Top Model, the then-25-year-old also became the show's second man to win, beating 2015 Miss Maryland USA winner Mamé Adjei.\n\nDiMarco signed with Wilhemina Models directly after his win. He then went on to compete on Dancing With the Stars with assigned dance partner Peta Murgatroyd and won the 22nd championship title, becoming the first deaf winner of the global franchise. DiMarco uses his model influencer platform to spread awareness about deaf culture, launching the Nyle DiMarco Foundation — his nonprofit organization for deaf children and families — in 2016, and being the keynote speaker at the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2020.\n\nThe model/activist also regularly lands onscreen gigs, appearing on Difficult People, This Close, Station 19, and Queer as Folk, while also serving as executive producer for the reality series Deaf U and the Oscar-nominated documentary short Audible (2021). DiMarco published a book, Deaf Utopia: A Memoir ― and a Love Letter to a Way of Life, in 2022.\n\n23 of 24\n\nIndia Gants (Cycle 23)\n\nThe then-21-year-old Seattleite came first in ANTM's 23rd cycle, beating fellow opponent Tatiana Price — now the founder of skincare brand Skin Buttr — without ever making an appearance in the bottom two. Gants, also Gigi Hadid's doppelgänger, walked away with a $100,000 contract with Rimmel London cosmetics and earned a fashion spread in Paper magazine.\n\nShortly after her win, Gants appeared in the season 3 premiere of Odd Mom Out. The model revealed her passion for music to Billboard magazine before she began working as a DJ. Gants proceeded to model for Select Management and SMG Models.\n\n24 of 24\n\nKyla Coleman (Cycle 24)\n\nANTM's first/only Gen-Z winner was only 20 years old when she took the crown in its 24th cycle, being the youngest of the series' most diverse group of contestants to date. Coleman edged out Jeana Turner, winning the $100,000 cash prize from Pantene, a contract from Next Model Management, and a fashion spread in Paper magazine. On the show, the young model was lauded as a political activist, who got into a heated feminist debate with fellow contestant Liberty Netuschil.\n\nSigned to Heffner Seattle and Photogenics LA, Coleman continues to model, working for Valentino, Alexander Wang, Vogue Italia, Skims, Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya, Calvin Klein, and more.
