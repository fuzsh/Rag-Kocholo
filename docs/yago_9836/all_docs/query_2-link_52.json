        "text": "Adrianne Curry on \"Top Model\": They \"F***ed\" Me\n\nPosted Feb 6th 2007 2:29PM by TMZ Staff\n\nFiled under: TV, Celebrity Feuds\n\nAdrianne Curry, who was the Season One winner of \"America's Next Top Model,\" has lambasted the show and Revlon, claiming that she \"has yet to see a dime from Revlon\" for her work.\n\n\"We were told the winner would be an instant millionaire, that our faces would be plastered everywhere in Revlon ads. None of which turned out to be true ... I still haven't got paid for the work I did for them!\" steamed Curry.\n\nMiss Curry is super mad at the supermodel show, blasting them on her MySpace blog, saying \"... they had no money ... no clue what they were doing ... all they had was mind f***ing us for good tv [sic].\" Adrianne also claims that the girls hardly slept during filming, were kept hungry for long periods and were crammed into small quarters to guarantee drama. The Revlon campaign \"turned out to be only a day's work at a convention.\" Not so fabulash!\n\nAdrianne, who married \"Brady Bunch\" babe Christopher Knight last May, added that \"Top Model felt like I was on a fierce 'Survivor!'\"\n\nA rep for \"Top Model\" had no comment.\n\nhttp://www.tmz.com/2007/02/06/adrienne-curry-on-top-model-they-f-cked-me/\n\nWell, I`m not surprised. It`s a known fact that all Casting Shows are embarrasing Entertainment only and nobody makes a career out of them.\n\nOur german Topmodel didn`t even get her 15 minutes of fame after she won...(oh surprise, the world wasn`t in desperate need of a mediocre Heidi Klum clone...)\n\nHeroin_Chic said:\n\nWell, I`m not surprised. It`s a known fact that all Casting Shows are embarrasing Entertainment only and nobody makes a career out of them.\n\nI know, the whole Top Model thing is a complete joke...From the beginning it's just laughable watching all these girls who think that being skinny and tall immediately means they can be a runway model. I mean, what are the previous 'winners' doing now? Maybe they get the opportunity to prance around in a thong bikini in the background of a hip-hop video and that's it.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if designers/modeling agencies immediately veto anyone associated with Top Model without even looking at the pictures\n\nVainJane said:\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if designers/modeling agencies immediately veto anyone associated with Top Model without even looking at the pictures\n\nI totally agree!\n\nModels must be \"plain, versatile persons\" who can be associated with all kinds of images - that`s why it`s better when they`re personal aspects remain unknown.\n\nWhat was Adrienne thinking? That Chanel would hire her \"Ghetto Trailer Trash who doesn`t even have proper pronounciation\" (did you see the episode with the contact lense commercial where Adrienne couldn`t speak it properly?) ? Not very glamorous...\n\nBut there will always be naive (& desperate!) girls like her believing everything...but still, a big Show on national TV may not breech contract! I mean, we all saw the \"you`ll be the face of Rimmel\" promise on TV every week!\n\nFirstly....Adrienne isn't capable of getting as mad as this article makes out. She's probably the most chill person I've ever seen in my life. Even when she is angry she adds in a pinch of sarcasm and curry brand dark humour.\n\nThis is really ...old news isn't it? I mean, we all knew how she got pissed off at ANTM repeatedly, but then she did a U-Turn with her life, posed for playboy, made some money and found love.\n\nShe's the face of NVidea and probably gets more deals than she would have done was it not for ANTM as I personally don't find her very attractive.\n\nHeroin_Chic said:\n\nI totally agree!\n\nModels must be \"plain, versatile persons\" who can be associated with all kinds of images - that`s why it`s better when they`re personal aspects remain unknown.\n\nWhat was Adrienne thinking? That Chanel would hire her \"Ghetto Trailer Trash who doesn`t even have proper pronounciation\" (did you see the episode with the contact lense commercial where Adrienne couldn`t speak it properly?) ? Not very glamorous...\n\nBut there will always be naive (& desperate!) girls like her believing everything...but still, a big Show on national TV may not breech contract! I mean, we all saw the \"you`ll be the face of Rimmel\" promise on TV every week!\n\nPrecisely! Whether or not she deserved to win, she was judged the winner. Whether or not she did her part to work her way into the industry, that's besides the point. The point is that if the show made false representations / breached the contract (did they sign a contract in the first place), then she has every right to b*tch about it or even sue them.\n\nThe second runner up Elyse is doing pretty well in Hong Kong I think and I believe the show did help give a little boost in her career there. Her look really appeals to the Aisan market. Members from HK, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nDiorling said:\n\nshe's just trying to get some attention.\n\nno doubt about it..\n\nMaybe she hasn't get that succes what she thought that she would get.. but there a lot of the girls in the show that the have work now.. maybe not as a topmodel but they have work.\n\nSanne who won Hollands next top model. won ford model contest but and she is having now some work but will she get more after the next sesion of hollands next top model?\n\nWell she looks nice and is doing great. so i hope. but i doubt it too..\n\nthe girl who was second of hollands next top model.. is now singing because she can't really get a good model job"
