        "text": "Christopher Knight and Adrianne Curry were one of the most unexpected couples to come out of \"The Surreal Life.\" Much like \"The Real World,\" the reality series threw a bunch of celebrities into a house for two weeks and had them perform tasks or participate in group activities. Knight and Curry starred in Season 4, along with Marcus Schenkenberg, Da Brat, Chyna, Verne Troyer, and Jane Wiedlin.\n\nWhile it seemed that Curry and Schenkenberg would connect over their modeling careers, the \"America's Next Top Model\" winner had her eyes on Knight. Curry pursued the \"Brady Bunch\" star and the two eventually started dating despite their 25-year age gap. Curry and Knight went on to star in \"My Fair Brady,\" which documented the ups and downs of their relationship. The model made it known that she wanted to get married, and Knight finally proposed during the Season 1 finale. The couple starred in two more seasons of \"My Fair Brady,\" with Season 3 teasing at the possibility of children in the future. Unfortunately, things didn't pan out quite so well for Knight and Curry, and their reality television romance went down the tubes.\n\nAdrianne Curry wanted a fairytale marriage with Christopher Knight and she got it â€” for five years. The two reality stars got married on May 29, 2006, in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois. On August 19, 2011, Knight filed for divorce from Curry, citing irreconcilable differences in the legal documents. The couple's manager told E! News at the time that their split was a mutual decision and that Curry knew Knight was going to serve her the divorce papers. Their manager went on to say that the pair was \"still friends\" and that the \"process thus far is very amiable.\"\n\nHowever, things don't seem very amicable anymore between Knight and Curry. In 2022, the former model told In Touch, \"I wish him well in his life. I remember before I walked away, I was just like, you know, 'You should stop marrying people. You're not good at it.' And he's like, 'I totally agree. I'm not a good husband.' And boy, did he just jump right back into that. Have a fantastic life far away from me.\" Since their divorce, Curry and Knight have both moved on, and seem to be doing much better in their subsequent relationships.\n\nAdrianne Curry might not have liked Christopher Knight moving on so quickly after their divorce, but perhaps the fourth time's the charm for the \"Brady Bunch\" actor. Knight started dating Cara Kokenes in 2012 and got married in November 2016 on Lake Michigan in front of their close friends and family. The two still seem to be going strong, and on November 7, 2022, Kokenes shared a carousel of pictures on Instagram of her and Knight. \"Happy Birthday to my amazing husband and my Best Friend, I love you,\" she wrote. Knight, for his part, gave his wife a Valentine's Day shoutout, while also paying tribute to his TV mom, Florence Henderson, who passed away in 2016. \"Happy Birthday to a lovely lady. Happy Valentine's Day to the lady I love,\" he shared.\n\nCurry is now happily married to her second husband, Matthew Rhode, whom she met online in 2015 while playing a video game. Unlike her whirlwind romance with Knight, she took things much slower with Rhode and told the Daily Mail that they didn't kiss until after their seventh date. Curry also revealed that months after she started dating Rhode, Knight sent her a note stating that he missed her. \"Matthew and I just read the note, laughed and crinkled it up, and threw it away. My feeling now [for Knight] is that I wish you well, just way the f**k over there!\" she declared."
