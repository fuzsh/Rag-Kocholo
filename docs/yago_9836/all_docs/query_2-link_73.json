        "text": "Then: Adrianne Curry was working as a waitress in her hometown, Joliet, Ill., when she saw a TV commercial for the “America’s Next Top Model” show. She won the first season, but who can forget the harsh words she had about the experience afterward? Burn.\n\nNow: After “ANTM,” Ms. Curry made Maxim’s Hot 100 list in 2005 and Playboy’s Top 25 Sexiest Women in 2008, but she continued her career in reality television with “The Surreal Life,” where she met Christopher Knight, a.k.a. Peter Brady on “The Brady Bunch,” whom she was married to. The couple went on to have their own show, “My Fair Brady,” but ultimately announced their separation in 2011. More recently, she became active in the gaming world. She attends Comic-Con conventions and has a Twitch profile to see her play online. Might she be looking to get back into modeling, though? She recently posted to Twitter, “Today, I submitted myself to @LAModelsAgency and @FordModels for their old lady divisions…because, I miss modeling.”\n\nThen: At 23, Yoanna House was working as a nanny in Jacksonville, Fla., (and lost 50 pounds) before applying to become the second winner of “America’s Next Top Model.”\n\nNow: Ms. House doesn’t want to be remembered merely as the girl who won “ANTM” and recently told Vulture: “After the first two or three years, I wanted people to forget the show. My friends would get so livid because we’d be out and people would say, ‘That’s the girl from the show.’ They would yell, ‘She’s doing other things now!’” She’s signed with IMG as an entertainment correspondent and works as a broadcast host. She was the host of a show on the Style Network called “The Look for Less,” taking over from Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and is currently hosting a web series called “Fashion Gone Local,” which profiles aspiring designers and restaurateurs around Jacksonville.\n\nThen: The Los Angeles native attended Clark Atlanta University and was working at Dillard’s department store selling men’s suits in Georgia when she applied for “America’s Next Top Model,” according to her IMDB profle. She had received early admission into Vanderbilt Law School when she was chosen.\n\nNow: In 2006, she changed her last name to Marcille and has racked up a number of acting credits, including TV roles on “The Young and the Restless,” “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne” and “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and movie appearances in “I Think I Love My Wife,” alongside Chris Rock and Kerry Washington, and “Crossover,” with Anthony Mackie. She also received an N.A.A.C.P. Image Award Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series nomination for her role in “The Young and the Restless.”\n\nThen: Naima Mora had moved to New York from her hometown, Detroit, and was dancing for the Dance Theater of Harlem for contemporary ballet when she decided to participate in “America’s Next Top Model.”\n\nNow: In 2013, she released a book called “Model Behavior” that gives tips on eating, skin care and how to become a model. She gave a TED Talk about the difficulties of growing up in crime-ridden Detroit and how her Buddhist upbringing by “avant-garde hippie parents” helped her in modeling. And in March, she released an upbeat electro-pop single called “Hourglass.”\n\nThen: Before auditioning for “America’s Next Top Model,” Nicole Linkletter, a North Dakota native, worked at Victoria’s Secret and Target, according to IMDB.\n\nNow: Since the show, she has been a judge at a Miss USA pageant, has walked in runway shows, including Alice and Olivia for fall 2006; and appeared in Nylon Mexico and in Marie Claire. From the looks of her Instagram account, she also enjoys baking pies and spending time with her dog.\n\nThen: Who could forget Dani Evans from Little Rock, Ark., whose thick Southern accent received a critique alongside her modeling from the show’s panel of judges? Nevertheless, her strong runway walk helped her win the sixth season.\n\nNow: After winning “ANTM,” Ms. Evans went on to walk the runway for a number of designers at fashion week, including Nicholas K and Zana Bayne. In 2013, she published a book, “The Skinny on Getting In” about how to break into the modeling industry. She continues to model, and in June was featured in an Essence Magazine bathing suit spread. And in April, she took to Instagram to rebut rumors that she has an eating disorder and bleaches her skin: “To answer both, I have impeccable genetics and a superlative dermatologist.” She also has an Instagram account @lebunnypig for her French bulldog, Kain.\n\nThen: The second contestant to come from North Dakota (Ms. Linkletter was the first), CariDee English was an aspiring photographer.\n\nNow: Since her win, she has been outspoken about her battle with psoriasis, is spokeswoman for the National Psoriasis Foundation and has appeared in commercials for Stelara. She’s been in a Ray-Ban “Never Hide” ad. She also hosted a reality show on Oxygen called “Pretty Wicked” that has women compete based on “inner beauty.”\n\nThen: Jaslene Gonzalez, an online college admissions adviser, was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Chicago. She had tried out for the seventh season of the show but made it only to the semifinals.\n\nNow: Ms. Gonzalez went on to walk in Sass and Bide, Armani Exchange and Rachel Antonoff. According to her personal site, in 2009 she “embarked on an international tour of Malaysia, Thailand, Honduras and India,” where she walked in Islamic Fashion Week for the king and queen of Malaysia. She was on the cover of Latina Magazine and in Vogue India. She has also since opened up and wrote a personal essay in The Chicago Sun Times about her struggle with an abusive relationship before “ANTM.”\n\nThen: Originally from Pasadena, Calif., Saleisha Stowers had attended Camp T-Zone, Tyra Banks’s camp for girls, worked as a receptionist in Los Angeles and appeared in a Wendy’s ad before trying out for the show, according to her IMDB profile.\n\nNow: Since the show, Ms. Stowers has gotten into television acting. She landed a role on “All My Children” in 2013 as Cassandra Foster and has been on “Days of Our Lives” since September as Lani Price.\n\nThen: Brittany Sullivan, a.k.a. McKey Sullivan, decided to go into modeling after she had knee surgery. She won the regional Elite Model Look competition but not the national one. ”Eventually, I decided to give it just one last kick,” she told TV Guide of her Top Model tryout “so that when I’m a granny, I won’t regret anything.”\n\nNow: Still an avid sports fan, she is married to Sam Alvey, a mixed martial arts fighter.\n\nThen: Nicole Fox, known as the “the quirky, awkward artist from Louisville, Colo.,” was the winner of the show’s first “petite” competition at 5-foot-7. Before the competition, she was a student at the University of Colorado majoring in studio arts.\n\nNow: After “ANTM,” she had a brief stint on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” She has modeled for Forever 21, Steve Madden and Wild Fox. Last year she starred in “Redlands.”\n\nThen: Krista White from Pine Bluff, Ark, was working in retail and apparently tried out 12 times before she made it on to the show. Talk about determination.\n\nNow: After the show, she told CW Austin, “I come off the show and I have to be a regular model like everyone else.” She said she still has to build her portfolio and go to castings. “That’s the part that people don’t recognize about it,” she said. Ms. White walked for Nicole Miller at New Zealand Fashion Week in 2010 and for BET’s Rip the Runway in 2011. She is now Fashion director at DLXVRSN Magazine.\n\nThen: The Los Angeles native was working as an assistant wardrobe stylist before her (double) stint on “ANTM.” Déjà vu? If you are a fan of the show, you probably remember her on Cycle 5 for her outspoken personality. That was most likely why they invited her back for the All-Star Cycle 17.\n\nNow: Ms. D’Amato is back in Los Angeles working on her music career and has released two albums with songs like, “Trainwreck,” “Comfortably Dumb” — and who could forget “My Name Is Lisa,” which she performed at the Viper Room in a bikini.\n\nThen: Before “ATNM,” Sophie Sumner attended the Cherwell School and Headington School, a private boarding school in Oxford, where she became friends with Emma Watson. According to The Oxford Mail, Ms. Sumner worked at a nightclub and restaurant in Oxford and turned down an admission to Exeter University to study drama to join Top Model. Top Model Britain, that is. She didn’t win, but she was chosen as a British All-Star to compete in the American show’s Cycle 18.\n\nNow: According to British Vogue, Ms. Sumner is following Alexa Chung as a British-model-turned-TV host. She has hosted “Hello Style” on the CW network and Marie Claire’s “Love Match.” She also released a single, “Aiming for You.”"
