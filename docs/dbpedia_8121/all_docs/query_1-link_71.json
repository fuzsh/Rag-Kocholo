Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPythagoras was known as the first pure mathematician because of his contribution to the field of mathematics. He was also a philosopher who influenced Plato and Aristotle. His life remained a mystery. After his death, the accounts of his life were slowly unearthed, while some remain controversial.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Pythagoras, or you can download our 30-page Pythagoras worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nPYTHAGORAS AND HIS EARLY LIFE\n\nPythagoras, also known as Pythagoras of Samos, is often described as the first pure mathematician because he served as a very significant figure in the development of mathematics.\n\nDespite this, his life remained a mystery because there was a very limited account. Most of these life accounts came from his students, while some came out years after his death.\n\nAccording to some of the accounts collected about him, Pythagoras was born in Samos, Greece, around 570 BCE. His father was Mnesarchus, a merchant from Tyre, while his mother was Pythias, a native of Samos. It was believed that Mnesarchus brought corn to Samos during the time of famine, and this granted him the citizenship of Samos as a form of gratitude.\n\nThere is very little information about his childhood, including his physical descriptions. However, it is believed that he had a striking birthmark on his thigh.\n\nSome accounts also say he had two or three brothers.\n\nBecause his father was a merchant, Pythagoras studied, was able to read and play the lyre, was able to learn poetry, and was able to recite Homer.\n\nIt was also believed that Pythagoras had great tutors like philosopher Thales and his student Anaximander, who used to give lectures in Miletus. Anaximander took a great interest in geometry, which may have influenced Pythagoras.\n\nYears later, when the tyrant Polycrates took control of Samos, Pythagoras went to Egypt. He visited many temples and was accepted into the priesthood in Diospolis after completing the rites required for admission.\n\nTen years later, when the relationship between Samos and Egypt fell apart, Pythagoras was taken as a prisoner to Babylon.\n\nHowever, Pythagoras was not treated as a prisoner, which allowed him to continue his education in mathematics and music.\n\nPythagoras eventually went back to Samos, where he founded a school called the Semicircle in the third century.\n\nSCHOOLS FOUNDED BY PYTHAGORAS\n\nIn this school, the Samians would hold political meetings to discuss questions about goodness, justice, and expediency.\n\nHowever, the Samians did not seem keen on Pythagoras’ method, which he learned from Egypt, and rudely responded to him.\n\nThen he went to Crete to study their legal system and founded another school in Croton.\n\nPythagoras was also dragged into different diplomatic missions by his fellow citizens and forced to participate in public affairs. Because of this, he decided to escape.\n\nPythagoras founded a philosophical and religious school in Croton (now known as Crotone in Southern Italy), where he became the head of the society of the inner circle known as mathematikoi. These followers lived with the society. They had no personal possessions and were vegetarians.\n\nPythagoras taught these people, and they obeyed strict rules.\n\nSome of the beliefs that Pythagoras taught were the following:\n\nAt its deepest level, the reality is mathematics in nature.\n\nPhilosophy can be used for spiritual purification.\n\nThe soul can rise to unite with the divine.\n\nCertain symbols have a mystical significance.\n\nAll brothers of the order should observe strict loyalty and secrecy.\n\nPythagoras contributed many concepts in mathematics, which made him known as the first pure mathematician.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF PYTHAGORAS\n\nPythagoras spearheaded the idea of a numerical system which was the beginning of mathematics. For Pythagoras, numbers were vital, and they made up the world.\n\nPythagoras also studied the properties of numbers, such as even and odd numbers.\n\nIn the field of geometry, Pythagoras became famous with a mathematical formula that is even named after him, the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nThe formula shows how the square of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nPythagoras also taught the principle of “All is number” or “God is number”. This shows how sacred numbers are, and they represent significant things. For instance, seven was for the number of plants at that time; three represented harmony, and four for seasons and elements.\n\nMetempsychosis was also one of the teachings of Pythagoras, which is a belief that all spirits are godlike and a soul moves from one body to another after death. He believed that he was reincarnated four times. First, he was Aethalides, the son of Hermes; second was Euphorbus, a minor hero of the Trojan war; next was Hermotimus, a scholar; and lastly, Pyrrhus, a fisherman from Delos.\n\nPythagoras was also the first to discover that the planet Earth is a sphere. Pythagoreans also believe that planets move around in a circle, and when they get close to each other, they produce a melody. They believe that the Earth, stars, and planets all move in a circle around a central flame.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF PYTHAGORAS\n\nPythagoras was given credit for discovering the five solids: cube, triangle, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. Plato elaborated on these and published them in books.\n\nPythagoras and his followers also proposed a generalization that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is equal to (2n-4) right angles, and the sum of its exterior angles is equal to four right angles.\n\nPythagoreans also forwarded the idea of Tetractys. It is a triangular structure known as an equilateral triangle consisting of 10 dots arranged in four rows.\n\nFurthermore, Pythagoras also inspired irrational and perfect numbers. Hippasus, one of Pythagoras’ students, discovered and proposed irrational numbers which contradicted the Pythagoreans’ theory. Because of this, Hippasus was sentenced to death. On the other hand, the Pythagoreans also discovered that perfect numbers are equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Euclid further developed the explanation.\n\nPythagoreans were also given credit for the discovery of amicable numbers. These are two numbers where each is equal to the proper divisors of the other.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF PYTHAGORAS\n\nPythagoras was the first who believed that music had an effect similar to what medicine has on the body. Therefore, he was also the first one who recommended it. Pythagoreans believed music was the best source of purifying and saving one’s soul. Pythagoras also linked music to self-improvement and peace of mind.\n\nIt was also believed that Pythagoras inspired Plato and Aristotle’s reasonings. Plato may have obtained his morality from Pythagoras. Plato and Pythagoras both had a way of dealing with the spirit and its place in the material world. These were both impacted by Orphism, a set of religious beliefs and practices originating in the ancient Greek world.\n\nPYTHAGOREAN THEOREM\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental geometric theorems.\n\nIt is one of Pythagoras’ contributions to mathematics.\n\nPythagorean theorem claims that the sum of the squares on the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse, hence the algebraic notation, a2+b2=c2.\n\nIn the algebraic notation, a is the altitude, b is the base, and c is the hypotenuse which is the longest side of the right-angled triangle.\n\nThis formula can be applied to any triangle with one 90-degree angle. This triangle produces Pythagoras’ theorem.\n\nAnother way of understanding this is by using the square of the length of the longest side of the triangle. This is equal to the sum of the area of the squares formed by the other two sides of the right-angled triangle.\n\nThis theorem can be proven by using algebraic methods and using similar triangles methods.\n\nPYTHAGORAS’ DEATH\n\nThe cause of Pythagoras’ death remains a mystery, but some concluded that he died in 495 BCE.\n\nAccording to some accounts, he died at the age of 75.\n\nOne of the cited assumptions stated that the house of Milo in Croton was ransacked and burned. There were 50 to 60 Pythagoreans who were killed, and the others who survived took refuge in Thebes and other places.\n\nAnother theory was Pythagoras died at the hands of an angry mob who targeted him.\n\nOthers say that Syracusans may have killed him because he was part of the war between the Argentum.\n\nAnother story stated that he died in Metapontum, starving himself for 40 days because he was grieving the persecution of the Pythagoreans.\n\nEven though Pythagoras’ life was unclear and remained a mystery, his impact on philosophy and mathematics was indeed remarkable.\n\nPythagoras Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Pythagoras across 30 in-depth pages.

He is most famous for the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This theorem is a fundamental result in mathematics used in various fields, including trigonometry, geometry, and engineering.\n\nWhat was the Pythagorean school of thought?\n\nThe Pythagorean school was a religious and philosophical society founded by Pythagoras. Its members, called Pythagoreans, believed that mathematical concepts were the basis of all things in the universe and that numbers held a special significance. They also believed in the transmigration of souls and practiced vegetarianism.\n\nWhat was Pythagoras’ view on mathematics?\n\nPythagoras believed that mathematics was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that numbers held a special significance. He thought that mathematical relationships were the key to understanding the world and that mathematical concepts such as proportion, ratio, and harmony could be applied to both the natural world and human behavior.\n\nHow did Pythagoras’ ideas influence later philosophers and mathematicians?\n\nPythagoras’ ideas profoundly impacted the development of philosophy and mathematics. Plato was heavily influenced by Pythagorean thought and used mathematical concepts in his philosophical writings. Pythagoras’ theorem was used by the ancient Greeks to calculate the distance between points and was later rediscovered and proved by Euclid.\n\nWhat is the legacy of Pythagoras today?\n\nPythagoras’ legacy continues today, with the Pythagorean theorem still being an actual result in mathematics and widely used in various fields. His ideas about the relationship between mathematics and the universe influenced later philosophers and scientists, including Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Additionally, the Pythagorean school of thought and its emphasis on the importance of mathematics has had a lasting impact on Western philosophy and science development.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Pythagoras Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, February 10, 2023\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
