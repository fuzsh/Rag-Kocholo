        "text": "What was the first cause of our existence? What is real? What is the purpose of our lives? Questions like these have become the basis of the study known as philosophy. While these questions were addressed in ancient times through religion, the process of logically and methodically thinking through life's big questions did not begin until about the 7th century BCE.\n\nAs different groups of philosophers worked together, they developed \"schools\" or approaches to philosophy. These schools described the origins and purpose of existence in very different ways. Individual philosophers within each school had their own particular ideas.\n\nThe Pre-Socratic philosophers are the earliest of the philosophers. Their concern was not so much with the topics of ethics and knowledge that modern people associate with philosophy, but concepts we might associate with physics. Empedocles and Anaxagoras are counted as Pluralists, who believed there is more than one basic element from which everything is composed. Leucippus and Democritus are Atomists.\n\nMore or less following the Pre-Socratics came the trio of Socrates-Plato-Aristotle, the schools of the Cynics, Skeptics, Stoics, and Epicureans.\n\nThe Milesian School: 7th-6th Centuries BCE\n\nMiletus was an ancient Greek Ionian city-state on the western coast of Asia Minor in todayâ€™s Turkey. The Milesian School consisted of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes (all from Miletus). The three are sometimes described as \"materialists,\" because they believed that all things derived from a single material.\n\nThales (636-546 BCE): Thales was certainly a real historical individual, but very little evidence remains of his work or writing. He believed that the \"first cause of all things\" was water, and may have written two treatises entitled On the Solstice and On the Equinox, focusing on his astronomical observation. He may also have developed several significant mathematical theorems. It is likely that his work strongly influenced Aristotle and Plato.\n\nAnaximander (c.611-c.547 BCE): Unlike Thales, his mentor, Anaximander actually wrote materials can be credited to his name. Like Thales, he believed that just one material was the source of all things--but Anaximander called that one thing \"the boundless\" or infinite. His ideas may well have strongly influenced Plato.\n\nAnaximenes (d. c. 502 BCE): Anaximenes may well have been a student of Anaximander. Like the other two Milesians, Anaximenes believed that a single substance was the source of all things. His choice for that substance was the air. According to Anaximenes, when the air becomes finer, it becomes fire, when it is condensed, it becomes first wind, then cloud, then water, then earth, then stone.\n\nThe Eleatic School: 6th and 5th centuries BCE\n\nXenophanes, Parmenides, and Zeno of Elea were members of the Eleatic School (named for its location in Elea, a Greek colony in southern Italy). They rejected the idea of many gods and questioned the idea that there is one reality.\n\nXenophanes of Colophon (c. 570-480 BCE): Xenophanes rejected the anthropomorphic deities and considered there to be one incorporeal god. Xenophanes may have asserted that men may have beliefs, but they don't have certain knowledge.\n\nParmenides of Elea (c. 515-c. 445 BCE): Parmenides believed that nothing comes into being because everything must derive from something that already exists.\n\nZeno of Elea, (c. 490-c. 430 BCE): Zeno of Elea (in southern Italy) was known for his intriguing puzzles and paradoxes.\n\nPre-Socratic and Socratic Philosophers of the 6th and 5th Centuries BCE\n\nAnaxagoras of Clazomenae\n\n(c. 499-c. 428)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nProtagoras\n\n(480-411)\n\nGreek philosopher & Sophist\n\nSocrates\n\n(c. 469-399)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nPlato\n\n(c. 427-347)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nDiogenes of Sinope\n\n(412-323)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nPhilosophers of the 4th Century BCE\n\nAristotle\n\n(384-322)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nEpicurus\n\n(341-271)\n\nGreek philosopher\n\nEuclid\n\n(c. 325-265)\n\nGreek mathematician\n\nAristarchos\n\n(c. 310-250)\n\nGreek astronomer\n\nPhilosophers of the 3rd Century BCE\n\nChrysippus\n\n(c. 280-207)\n\nHellenistic philosopher\n\nEratosthenes\n\n(276-194)\n\nHellenistic astronomer\n\nPhilosophers of the 2nd Century BCE\n\nPanaetius\n\n(c. 185-110)\n\nStoic and Neo-Platonic Philosopher\n\nLucretius\n\n(c. 98-55)\n\nRoman poet and Epicurean philosopher\n\nPhilosophers of the 1st Century CE\n\nEpictetus\n\n(50 - 138)\n\nRoman philosopher\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n\n(121-180)\n\nRoman emperor and philosopher\n\nPhilosophers of the 3rd Century CE\n\nPlotinus\n\n(c. 204-270)Greco-roman philosopher\n\nPhilosophers of the 4th Century CE\n\nHypatia of Alexandria\n\n(c. 370-415)\n\nAlexandrian philosopher\n\nPhilosophers of the 4th Century CE\n\nBoethius\n\n(480-525)\n\nPhilosopher and Christian martyr who was called the last of the Romans.\n\nFormat\n\nmla apa chicago\n\nYour Citation\n\nGill, N.S. \"Timeline of Greek and Roman Philosophers.\" ThoughtCo, Feb. 16, 2021, thoughtco.com/timeline-of-greek-and-roman-philosophers-118808.
