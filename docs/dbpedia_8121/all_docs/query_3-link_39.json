        "text": "Evo, I know very little about Anaximander but I did hear something amusing.\n\nApparently he knew the Earth was spherical, so then the question everybody asks is \"what holds it up?\"\n\nThis is hearsay, I should check it, but anyway other people thought up explanations like it was held up by a Giant, or by Turtles, or floated on the surface of an infinite ocean.\n\nBut apparently Anaximander thought a little more deeply and said: Yes the round Earth is situated in the midst of empty space but it does not fall...because there is no preferred direction for it to fall in!\n\nThat is, he used a symmetry argument to show that there is no need for the Earth to be suspended from anything or supported on any base.\n\nMuch of contemporary physics is saying that things are the way they are because of symmetries of various sorts. So in that way the reasoning of the physicists is anaximandral.\n\nHe didn't have the idea of an (algebraic) equation---but much of physics as we know it involves balance, equilibrium, opposing forces, resolution achieved by the equals sign. He didn't have that, but instead the equation he used the idea of Justice. Different opposing principles resolved by Justice. Just like a Greek.\n\nAnd so he made up Laws, instead of Turtles and Giants.\n\nCute old guy. One could get to like Anaximander, I guess.\n\nI have started to wish that I could go to Miletus, that city on the coast of Turkey that was once a city of the Ionians. I imagine looking out from Miletus, onto the Aegean, and I imaging there are islands visible out to sea. I actually don't know whether there really are islands in sight from Miletus.\n\nmarcus said:\n\nThat is, he used a symmetry argument to show that there is no need for the Earth to be suspended from anything or supported on any base.\n\nAnaximander most likely proposed that the Earth was drum shaped, a squat cylinder, rather than a sphere. The other side being of course the Antipodes. And following the view of his time, the surface of the drum was perhaps a little concave so that the Mediterranean formed a puddle at its centre.\n\nYet it is true that Anaximander used the principle of indifference to explain why the Earth could just hang at the centre of its world. He also believed many others worlds would exist, generated from the unbounded apeiron.\n\nBut it would be a shame for Anaximander to be remembered for just a simple bit of cosmology and his real significance overlooked. He had a theory of causality as a complex process of development - of symmetry-breaking, indeed - that was far more important.\n\nI wonder if Rovelli will have cottoned on to this? Probably not as it sounds as though he wants to assimilate Anaximander to the \"modern scientific tradition\" - the rival view of causality drawn up by the Greek atomists.\n\napeiron said:\n\nAnaximander most likely proposed that the Earth was drum shaped, a squat cylinder, rather than a sphere.

My understanding (from time spent in Greece) was that Anaximander described the Earth as cylindrical (as you've described) but an unbounded Apeiron as having sperical properties? All I could find was this (2 Articles):\n\nhttp://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl...US404US404&tbs=isch:1&ei=hhGSTY2FIYW_gQekzowa\n\nI look forward to the book - good find marcus!\n\nWhoWee said:\n\nI remember the Greeks speaking of \"Apeiron\" meaning all surrounding and round or all around(?) - again, I lost a lot in the translations (and over 20 years ago).\n\n(that should have been spherical - not sperical)\n\nThis is a little closer to the stories I recall from the Plaka: my bold\n\nhttp://www.enotes.com/topic/Apeiron_(cosmology)\n\n\"The apeiron has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.[21] Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass — this Earth of ours — cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the Earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.[22] The first animals were generated in the water.[23] When they came to Earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.[24] The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold Earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.\"\n\nmarcus said:\n\n...\n\nI have started to wish that I could go to Miletus, that city on the coast of Turkey that was once a city of the Ionians. I imagine looking out from Miletus, onto the Aegean, and I imaging there are islands visible out to sea. I actually don't know whether there really are islands in sight from Miletus.\n\nHi fuzzyfelt, apeiron, whowee...\n\nNice pictures!\n\nIt turns out that because of silting (or some reason) the shoreline has changed and Miletus is now INLAND. It is no longer on the coast. Maybe I was the only one who didn't know that.\n\nThere still are some Ionian greek ruins there.\n\nThe book \"The First Scientist\" is scheduled to go on sale 25 May, a little over a week now!\n\nÉditions Dunod published the French version in 2009. It won a French prize for non-fiction: the Prix du Livre Haute Maurienne de l’Astronomie.\n\nHere is the publisher's page for the 2009 French edition:\n\nhttp://www.dunod.com/sciences-techn...ciences-de-la-matiere-et-/anaximandre-de-mile\n\nHere is the book's Amazon.fr page:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/2100529390/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nThe publisher of the English version (Westholme) doesn't seem to be giving much advanced publicity. Here are the Amazon listings for Usa, Canada, UK:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nSome promotional material (provided by Westholme) reflects critical acclaim received by the 2009 French edition of the book:\n\n==quote http://www.westholmepublishing.com/thefirstscientist.html ==\n\nCarlo Rovelli, a leading theoretical physicist, uses the figure of Anaximander as the starting point for an examination of scientific thinking itself: its limits, its strengths, its benefits to humankind, and its controversial relationship with religion. Anaximander, the sixth-century BC Greek philosopher, is often called the first scientist because he was the first to suggest that order in the world was due to natural forces, not supernatural ones. He is the first person known to understand that the Earth floats in space; to believe that the sun, the moon, and the stars rotate around it—seven centuries before Ptolemy; to argue that all animals came from the sea and evolved; and to posit that universal laws control all change in the world. Anaximander taught Pythagoras, who would build on Anaximander’s scientific theories by applying mathematical laws to natural phenomena.\n\nIn the award-winning The First Scientist: Anaximander and His Legacy, translated here for the first time in English, Rovelli restores Anaximander to his place in the history of science by carefully reconstructing his theories from what is known to us and examining them in their historical and philosophical contexts. Rovelli demonstrates that Anaximander’s discoveries and theories were decisive influences, putting Western culture on its path toward a scientific revolution. Developing this connection, Rovelli redefines science as a continuous redrawing of our conceptual image of the world. He concludes that scientific thinking—the legacy of Anaximander—is only reliable when it constantly tests the limits of our current knowledge. Praise for the French edition (Éditions Dunod, 2009)...\n\n==endquote==\n\nThe publisher also has a kind of sound-bite from Lee Smolin:\n\n\"At this point in time, when the prestige of science is at a low and even simple issues like climate change are mired in controversy, Carlo Rovelli gives us a necessary reflection on what science is, and where it comes from. Rovelli is a deeply original thinker, so it is not surprising that he has novel views on the important questions of the nature and origin of science.”—Lee Smolin, founding member and researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and author of The Trouble with Physics\n\nApeiron, Whowee, you are both most welcome!\n\nHere is an online intro to Anaximander from Dirk Couprie a guy in the Netherlands who I think does history of science/philosophy and is something of an expert in this area\n\nhttp://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximan/\n\napeiron said:\n\nHe will be celebrating Anaximander for his intellectual method...but ignoring the metaphysical results.\n\n...\n\nApeiron I think you are right---likely more emphasis on innovation of method and the remarkable scientific insights arising therefrom.\n\nBut don't you think that raising interest in Ionian Sixth Century BCE will make it more likely that we will see more written about A. including his metaphysics? Also the scientific concepts are they not aspects of the metaphysics? Do they not play a role?\n\nFor example in Chapter 5, the French edition discusses the idea of a natural substance which we do not see. A substance X. Which we infer by reason to exist and use to explain phenomena that we do see. Somewhat like quarks, which we believe exist but cannot isolate.\n\nIt seems that Thales, the teacher of Anaximander, proposed that the world was made of Water, or that it arose from the principal of Water. Anaximander took the original step of criticising his teacher's doctrine (which was not the custom in those days) and reasoning that Water was unsatisfactory and a fundamental principal/substance. He instead proposed a Substance X. An unknown indefinite something.\n\nI think the Ionian Sixth is an amazing period, like the Italian Renaissance. The more written about it the better, and the more I read about it the more remarkable I find it.\n\nIt seems to reveal the beginnings of both critical philosophy on the one hand\n\nand naturalistic science on the other.\n\nYou evidently know considerably more about A's thought than I. I like it that he managed to figure out that the sun's heat drives the water cycle, i.e. where rain comes from, and proposed a natural cause for thunder. He argued that all land animals (including humans) developed from sea life, and that the earth floats in emptiness so that the stars can pass beneath it. It does not rest on turtles or elephants, in other words.\n\n=================\n\nSince he was born ca. 610 BCE, Anax could have met Sappho ( b. circa 620 BCE ) she was only a few years older. and the young Pythagoras (b. ca. 570 BCE) could well have come to Miletus to visit with him. These remarkable people lived on nearby islands---close to Anax in space and time.\n\nI really like this post. There is a lot of truth to it. The Undefinedness of the Apeiron \"primal principle\" is remarkably close in spirit to the Background Independence first realized in a universe model by Einstein in 1915 General Rel. General Relativity has no prior geometry that it is built on.\n\nIn GR, the geometry comes into existence in dynamic interaction with matter in motion.\n\nThe geometry, represented by a distance relation or \"metric\" defined at each point of an otherwise formless set of points, is a solution to the equation, not a fixed premise. There is no \"background\" metric fixed ahead of time.\n\nSo there is a formlessness that indeed is reminding us of the apeiron of Anax'er. A geometric backgroundlessness.\n\nThis is an intriguing post. I was reluctant to cover it up with my own post, so I just did not say anything for a few days.\n\napeiron said:\n\nWhat would be great is if Rovelli twigs that Anaximander had the original background independent model of the universe.\n\nThe apeiron was not really a substance but a pre-substance state. Other philosophers talked about air, water, etc, but Anaximander was doing his best to get away from anything concrete or essential at all. So this \"stuff\" was not a substance but instead just an unbounded potential, a vagueness.\n\nSo just as we are trying to do today with LQG for instance, Anaximander was trying to imagine a cosmos boot-strapping out of simple possibility.\n\nYes, everyone talks as though Anaximander just had a different kind of substance in mind. But he in fact went beyond the creation of substantial being.\n\nI too wonder what Rovelli would say if he saw this. (Since he writes about both background independent quantum gravity and about Anax'er.)\n\nFor anyone coming new to the thread here are some links to information.\n\nUS publisher Westholme's page for forthcoming English edition\n\nhttp://www.westholmepublishing.com/thefirstscientist.html\n\nAmazon pages\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nFrench publisher's page for the 2009 edition\n\nhttp://www.dunod.com/sciences-techn...ciences-de-la-matiere-et-/anaximandre-de-mile\n\nAmazon.fr page\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/2100529390/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nSince the French version has already come out, we can tell a fair amount about the book by translating the French TOC:\n\nROUGH INTERPRETIVE TRANSLATION\n\nSommaire Introduction.\n\n1.

It would be natural for changes, revisions, additions to occur, that could appear first in the English edition.\n\nI see the English edition publisher says the book is 256 pages. For a rough guess about material being added one can compare with the French edition, which is listed as 192 pages. Some of the difference could be due to other factors such as typesize.\n\nSome of my own thoughts about Anaximander and his legacy\n\nApeiron has already indicated some of what he thinks is important to know about Anax'der.\n\nI will tell some of my own reflections on him. For me Anax'der's realization that the the Earth floats in space---that space and stars are in all directions and that there is no special \"UP\" direction---is something I feel close to when I see the half moon in the sky.\n\nThe half moon allowed someone who came after Anax to deduce by geometric reasoning that the sun is 18 or 20 times farther than the moon.\n\nBecause Anax made a geometric model of the Earth Moon Sun system which embodied a certain ad hoc wrong ratio = 3/2. The Sun was farther than the Moon by a factor of 3/2. So that was wrong but it opened up the question. Could you get a better handle on that ratio?\n\nOnly 300 years after Anaximander, someone did.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos\n\nThe article suggests that the figure of 18-20 may have been a lower bound. It's not entirely clear. The main thing is he got a handle on the problem, and improved on Anaximander's value for the ratio of distances, and he used geometry to do it.\n\nHere's another article, with diagrams:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_On_the_Sizes_and_Distances\n\nSo when I see the half moon in the sky I think of those guys. Anaximander born 610 BCE Miletus and Aristarchus born 310 BCE on Samos, a nearby island.\n\nThis is part of the Heritage, the Legacy. I want to share this with whoever could get a kick out of it.\n\nImagine you can measure the angle between the moon and sun fairly accurately at a time when there is a half moon in the sky.\n\nSay you are looking south and the half moon is near the mid-sky line and the sun is near setting.\n\nThen there is a big triangle with a right angle at the moon (because you see it as a half moon.)\n\nSay you measure the angle between them as 80 degrees. He did it more accurately---this will be very quick and dirty. You can draw a right triangle with the two angles 80 degrees and 10 degrees. 10 degrees is about 1/6 ratidan, so you can estimate that the distance to the sun is some 6 times bigger than the distance to moon.\n\nNot to pretend to be too accurate, if you can determine that the angle seen at Earth is AT LEAST 85 degrees then you can decide that the angle seen at sun is LESS or equal 5 degrees which is less or equal 1/12 radian. So distance to sun is AT LEAST 12 TIMES the moon distance.\n\nSo that is already better than Anaximander! He had the ratio something like 3/2!\n\nThe thing is Anax opened the question and led the way with a geometric model. So you were going to apply geometry. And he made it fashionable to improve on your teacher because he did that with his teacher Thales. Critical (if respectful) attitude to authority.\n\nAnd he even put out some low-hanging ready to pick fruit----this 3/2 number. Once there is a number, people like Aristarchus are going to feel challenged to improve on it.\n\nDon't worry about sines and cosines right now. When you get down to angles smaller than 10 degrees the ratio of sides is roughly the same as the ratio of angles.\n\nAnd Aristarchus did better than 80 degrees, he thought the spread between moon and sun was OVER 85 DEGREES. Actually, we are told, 87 degrees (hard to imagine him measuring so fine as that though.)\n\nNext time I see the half moon I might think of it as \"Anaximander moon\". Even though the first person to use the half moon to get a handle on the proportions of the universe was someone who came 300 years after.\n\nAnaximander started the ball rolling as regards both geometric models of the universe (with no up, down, or elephants) and applying critical reason to assess and improve on one's antecedents. Once the ball was rolling you could say that one day Aristarchus would have to come along and invent the heliocentric universe and the rest is history. :-D Well that's one way to look at it.\n\nEDITED VERSION OF PREVIOUS POST.\n\n(Needed editing but I ran out of time)\n\nThis is part of the Heritage, the Legacy. I want to share this with whoever could get a kick out of it.\n\nImagine you can measure the angle between the moon and sun fairly accurately at a time when there is a half moon in the sky. Say you are facing south and you see the half moon is high to the south and the sun near setting. Then there is a big triangle EMS with a right angle at the moon (because you see it as a half moon.)\n\nThen say you measure the angle between them as 80 degrees. He did it more accurately---this will be quick and dirty. You can draw a right triangle with the right angle at the moon, 80 degrees at earth, 10 degrees at sun. 10 degrees is about 1/6 radian, so you can estimate EM/ES = 1/6\n\nDistance to the sun is some 6 times bigger than the distance to moon.\n\nNot to pretend to be too accurate, if you can determine that the angle seen at Earth is AT LEAST 85 degrees then you can decide that the angle seen at sun is LESS or equal 5 degrees which is less or equal 1/12 radian. So distance to sun is AT LEAST 12 TIMES the moon distance.\n\nSo that is already better than Anaximander! He had the ratio be only something like 3/2!\n\nThe thing is Anax opened the question and led the way with a geometric model. So you were mentally prepared to apply geometry to the heavens. And he made it fashionable to improve on your teacher because he did that with his teacher Thales. Critical (if respectful) attitude to authority.\n\nAnd he even put out some low-hanging ready-to-pick fruit----this 3/2 number. Once there is a number, people like Aristarchus are going to feel challenged to improve on it.\n\nGetting down to a little bit more detail (only if you want to), Aristarchus thought that in that triangle the angle seen at the sun was \"one thirtieth of a quadrant\". He did not use degrees, he measured by fractions of a quadrant (another name for right angle). A thirtieth of a quadrant is one twentieth of a \"sextant\". A sextant (i.e. 60 degrees) is quite close to the angle that today we call a radian. Using what you know about the sine of small angles, 1/20 = EM/MS and MS is so close to ES that one can put 1/20 = EM/ES. So the sun is 20 times the distance to the moon. In reality it is considerably farther, but this is all just approximate anyway. It's got to be pretty good for 3rd Century BCE!\n\nNext time I see the half moon I might think of it as \"Anaximander moon\". Even though the first person to use the half moon to get a handle on the proportions of the universe was someone who came 300 years later.\n\nAnaximander started the ball rolling as regards both geometric models of the universe (with no up, down, or elephants) and applying critical reason to assess and improve on one's antecedents. Once the ball was rolling you could say that one day Aristarchus would have to come along and invent the heliocentric universe and the rest is history. :-D Well that's one way to look at it.\n\nReality is what we keep learning about.\n\nWhat keeps surprising us no matter how accurately we have modeled it.\n\nUS publisher's page still gives September 2011 as their estimated date the book will appear\n\nhttp://www.westholmepublishing.com/thefirstscientist.html\n\nThe Amazon.com page has the earlier estimates August 2011 (I'm inclined to think the later date more realistic.)\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nThe book is already on sale in the UK!\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nI'll carry along some other links and information for any interested newcomers:\n\nCanadian Amazon page:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1594161313/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nFrench publisher's page for the 2009 edition:\n\nhttp://www.dunod.com/sciences-techn...ciences-de-la-matiere-et-/anaximandre-de-mile\n\nAmazon.fr page:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/2100529390/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nFrench edition TOC with sporadic rough interpretive translation:\n\nSommaire Introduction.\n\n1.

For a rough guess about material being added one can compare with the French edition, which is listed as 192 pages. Some of the difference could be due to other factors such as typesize.\n\nHowever it would be natural for changes, revisions, additions to have occurred in the intervening 3 years and to appear in the English edition.\n\napeiron said:\n\nGiven that this is turning into the longest teaser campaign for a book ever, you can read my own page summarising Anaximander's worldview at...\n\nhttp://www.dichotomistic.com/logic_dichotomies_history_one.html\n\nOr a good academic source is Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology by Charles Kahn.\n\nApeiron, great to hear from you! I got out Charles Kahn's book from the library a couple of months back and dipped into it. There is also a young Dutch historian of science who has been studying Anax and thinking about his importance---he has a website, I put his name (Dirk Couprie) and a link to his website in the preceding post.\n\nI like very much how you start your page. Ionia was the birthplace of rational thinking for many reasons. It is worth quoting bold blue:Greek philosophy began some two centuries before Athens in the scattered city states and colonies of Ionia, now the coast of Turkey. Ionia was the birthplace of rational thinking for many reasons.\n\nThe great civilisations of Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus had been agriculture-based, inward-looking, feudal and bureaucratic. The Ionian cities survived on fishing and trading. They were ruled by laws rather than kings. They had a wealthy merchant class who traveled widely. And by this time – around the 7th century BC – there was writing to record people’s ideas.\n\nThese first thinkers also had the advantage that they could come at the problem of existence with an utterly fresh eye. To use a memorable phrase, they saw: \"the world lit by a kind of six-o'clock-in-the-morning light and the dew imperishably on the grass.\"\n\nThere were many famous Ionians - Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles and Democritus are just some of them. Thales is conventionally considered the very first philosopher. But I would rather accord that honour to Anaximander of Miletus.\n\nfrom Apeiron's http://www.dichotomistic.com/logic_dichotomies_history_one.html\n\nI was mistaken about Dirk Couprie's age, when I posted earlier. For some reason I had gotten the idea that he was an under-40 scholar. He was born in 1940!\n\nmarcus said:\n\nA young Dutch expert on Anaximander I just now was thinking of is Dirk Couprie.\n\nI will hunt up his website. He has a book out too, but a website is quick and free.\n\nhttp://www.dirkcouprie.nl/home.html\n\nDirk says:\n\n\"My main professional interest is in Presocratic philosophy and cosmology, and especially those of Anaximander, who lived at Miletus, 610-547 B.C.\"\n\nand he gives some links:\n\n\"For more information on my latest book Heaven and Earth in Ancient Greek Cosmology: From Thales to Heraclides Ponticus click here.\n\nHere is a special link to my article on Anaximander in The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\"\n\nWhen I posted earlier I did not have a working link to his article on Anaximander in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I will hunt up one.\n\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:MAklZI346aYJ:www.iep.utm.edu/anaximan/+Couprie+Anaximander+Internet+Encyclopedia&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari&source=www.google.com\n\nThe regular IEP site is temporarily not responding.\n\nI think Couprie's IEP article on Anaximander is quite helpful. He has also written a book, with two other historians of science, called \"Anaximander in Context\".\n\nHe also has a bibliography on Anaximander. Lengthy interesting list of writings.\n\nhttp://www.dirkcouprie.nl/Anaximander-bibliography.htm\n\nFrom the looks of it, the field of Anaximander Studies is expanding"
