        "text": "Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher born in 570 BC on the island of Samos who greatly influenced Western thought. He believed that reality is best understood through mathematics and that the soul can achieve divine union. He made important contributions to astronomy by teaching that the Earth was spherical and located at the center of the universe, that the moon's orbit was inclined, and that Venus and the morning star were the same planet. Pythagoras also proposed the harmony of the spheres, where planetary motions produce sounds described by mathematics."
