        "text": "Pythagoras (560-480 BC)\n\nEsoteric teachings of Golden Citizens of Ancient Greece\n\nPythagoras Endless wisdom One of the greatest Greek philosophers, a teacher, and a sage\n\nPythagoras lived at the same time as Buddha and Lao Tzu and he taught his disciples that a soul goes through an endless wheel of reincarnations until we purify and return to the divine.\n\nPythagoras formed The Pythagorean Brotherhood, one of the first un-priestly scientific societies teaching philosophy and science. Both men and women were allowed to become members of the order.\n\nPythagoras of Samosa was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher. His teachings influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and the Western consciousness research.\n\nPythagoras teaching holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body, he is credited with the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identification of the planet Venus. Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his Timaeus, are our closest records of Pythagorean teachings. Pythagoras philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism.\n\nNo authentic writings of Pythagoras have ever survived.\n\nLike many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in Egypt. Aparently, Pythagoras learned to speak Egyptian from the Pharaoh Amasis II himself, and he studied with the Egyptian priests at Diospolis (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship. Plutarch (46 – 120 AC) writes in his treatise On Isis and Osiris that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of Heliopolis. According to the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria ( 150 – 215 AC), \"Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as Plato of Sechnuphis of Heliopolis.\" Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited Crete, where he went to the Cave of Ida with Epimenides.\n\nThe Phoenicians are reputed to have taught Pythagoras arithmetic and the Chaldeans to have taught him astronomy.\n\nThe Neoplatonists \"sacred discourse\" claim that Pythagoras had written the sacred text in the Doric Greek dialect, spoken by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus.Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism. Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.\n\nPythagoras ancient Greece numbers Monad Triad\n\nPythagoras primery numbers symbolical meaning of three four five six ten\n\nIn Croton\n\nWhile he was on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the \"semicircle\". The school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach. Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.\n\nAround 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos. He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today's Crotone, in Calabria) in what was then Magna Graecia. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speeches in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce. According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married Theano, a lady of Crete and had a number of kids.\n\nMetempsychosis or Reincarnation\n\nOne of Pythagoras's main doctrines was metempsychosis, the belief in reincarination, that all souls are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body. According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven Muses were actually the seven planets singing together.\n\nWhen Pythagoras was asked why humans exist, he said, \"to observe the heavens\". He practiced divination and prophecy. he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.\n\n“The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things.” Aristotle, Metaphysics 350 BC\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons.\n\nThey believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one (the monad) represented the origin of all things and the number two (the dyad) represented matter. The number three, a triangle was the symbol of the god Apollo. The number four signified the four seasons and the four elements. They believed that odd numbers were masculine and that even numbers were feminine,\n\nTen was regarded as the \"perfect number\"\n\nPythagoreans Celebrate the Sunrise (1869) by Fyodor Bronnikov\n\nPythagoreans Celebrate the Sunrise (1869) by Fyodor Bronnikov\n\nPainting showing a group of people dressed in white standing at the edge overlooking the sea watching as the sun rises. Both of his arms are raised into the air. The three men closest to him, are kneeling praying. Behind them, an older man plays a harp and two women play lyres. A man in the foreground kneels prayerfully towards the sunrise.\n\nPythagoras were the first to teach that the Earth was spherical, the first to divide the globe into five climactic zones\n\nPythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, Phlius, and Thebes during the early fourth century BC.\n\nAristotle tells us that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans. Plato's Republic is based on the \"tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers\" established by Pythagoras at Croton.\n\nThe earliest Greek natural philosophies believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type (εἶδος), which was mathematically calculated.\n\nPorta Maggiore Basilica in Rome 100 AC\n\nThe oldest known Pythagorean Temple is the Porta Maggiore Basilica, a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans. The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.\n\nIt has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.\n\nThe building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology, with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people. Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul merging with One, the unity of Apollo.\n\nUnderground basilica of Porta Maggiore Rome Pythagoreans 100 BC Fresco\n\nThe emperor Hadrian's Pantheon in Rome was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.\n\nHadrian's Pantheon in Rome, depicted in this eighteenth-century painting by Giovanni Paolo Panini, was built according to Pythagorean teachings\n\nJohannes Kepler considered himself to be a Pythagorean. Kepler titled his book on the subject Harmonices Mundi (Harmonics of the World), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.\n\nIsaac Newton firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.\n\nOn vegetarianism\n\nPythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism 1630 by Peter Paul Rubens, Italy\n\nPythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism (1618–1630) by Peter Paul Rubens was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's Metamorphoses.\n\nThe Sentences of SeXtus\n\nThe Sentences of Sextus is a Hellenistic Pythagorean text. The earliest mention of the Sentences is in the mid 3rd century. the work had become attributed to Pope Sixtus.\n\nSextus was a Pythagorean.\n\nThe soul is illuminated by the recollection of deity\n\nBear that which is necessary, as it is necessary\n\nBe not anxious to please the multitude\n\nEsteem nothing so precious, which a bad man may take from you\n\nUse lying like poison or Guard yourself from lying.

For it is better to live abstinently without this part than ruinously with it. (quoted by Origen)\n\nThe Rules are by Quintus Sextius, who lived in the 1st century BC.\n\nIn the 1st century BC, Neopythagoreanism was an attempt to re-introduce a mystical religious element into Hellenistic philosophy.\n\nThe Porta Maggiore Basilica where Neopythagoreans held their meetings in the 1st century, in Rome (discovered 1915)\n\nNeopythagoreanism held that union with the divine was possible through ascetic living and contemplation of the cosmic order.
