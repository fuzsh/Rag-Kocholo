        "text": "For instance, what we have left of Aristotle are his 'lecture notes', when he is said to have produced so many superb, finished dialogues that Cicero called them 'a river of gold'. Also there is very little left of Epicurus, surviving only in scraps when he is reputed to have written more than 300 books. When I look at the 'Pali canon' and the 'Old Testament', I do wonder why more couldn't have been saved of Epicurus and the Presocratics.\n\nThanks for the various comments you left just now, I have tried to answer the ones where I felt I had something useful to say! Regarding this one if I were doing ancient Greek philosophy now, I would have been a bit more detailed and done an episode on Homer and Hesiod for sure, if not one on each; and I would have done one on the Greek historians. My approach has become more completist as I have gone along. So, I agree with that criticism.\n\nYes, Peter, I agree there is a sort of definite/indefinite dualism in many subsequent philosophies, but, as far as I know, Anaximander was the only one to make the Indefinite, ‘To Apeiron’, his fundamental substance, with definite elements subordinate to it. Everyone else made a value judgement equating finite-ness with perfection: Parmenides’ ‘One’ is a perfect sphere, Heraclitus has the Logos as the one definite principle of order controlling all processes of continual change. But Anaximander seems to have already made an astonishing leap of inspiration by refusing to define his fundamental substance as anything recognisable in our temporal experience; ‘to apeiron’ is literally undefinable! Another comment here compares this to the Tao of Chinese philosophy, and I think they have a point; but I find the same reasoning, that at the base layer there is an inner reality utterly different from the familiar substances and forces which it supports, in Quantum Physics. There’s the all-pervading quantum vacuum, not empty at all but seething with undifferentiated energy out of which opposite matter/antimatter particles are created, collide and are reabsorbed. There’s Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which presents quanta as neither definite particles nor waves, but sort of both. But I think Anaximander would have been most excited by the quantum theory of mass, the property which gives us and all ‘things’ the ability to change through time: most mass emanates not from the matter particles we consist of, but from an amorphous ‘Sea’ of virtual quarks and gluons, a sort of microcosm of the vacuum ensconced within the nucleus of every atom. What do you think?"
