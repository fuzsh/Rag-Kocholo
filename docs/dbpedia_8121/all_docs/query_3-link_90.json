        "text": "Imagining the Universe 1\n\nDirk L. Couprie and Heleen J. Pott\n\nAnyone who has visited Greece will remember how the ancient temples were flooded with sunlight. Many will also have admired the play of light and shadow caused by the rows of columns, or have noticed the subtle movements of the sunlight on the flutes of a single column. These phenomena have inspired the German author Hans Kauffmann to argue that the fluted columns of Greek temples function as a kind of sundial. His photographs of columns, in different seasons and at different hours of the day, are fascinating. It reminds him of Anaximander, who is said to have introduced the gnomon and to have erected one in Sparta. We can readily imagine Anaximander and the architects discussing columns and gnomons, or Anaximander teaching them how to construct their columns as useful sundials. As Kauffmann puts it, speaking about Anaximander and Pythagoras: 'Könnten sie Baukünstlern zur Seite gestanden haben, womöglich Wegbereiter gewesen sein, gerade auch dafür, Zeitliches in Maj3 und Zahl am Bau einzufangen?' 2 In a sense, Kauffmann is Robert Hahn's predecessor in connecting Anaximander and the architects of the tempIes. However, as we will see, Hahn looks elsewhere for relations between Anaximander and the architects.\n\nAs Hahn himself remarks in the first sentence, Anaximander and the Architects is unquestionably a most unusual book. Pretending to be a philosophical monograph, roughly half of the text is concemed with ancient architecture and the problems of temple building, such as erect­ing columns by piling up column-drums. The book contains almost nothing about what most literature on Anaximander usually recognizes as the two principal items, viz. the apeiron and the one existing fragment. Were it not for his enthusiastic way of writing, Hahn would be at great pains to keep the philosophical reader on a path that seems to lead so far from his usual concern7s. However, the reader' s efforts will not be in vain, for Hahn's original approach to the dawn of presocratic philosophy offers much to think about and to argue with.\n\nThe emergence of philosophy, Hahn maintains, has been inspired by applied geometry as used by the architects who built the temples in the neighborhood of Miletus. By 'applied geometry' Hahn means such things as drawing circles in order to determine the center of a column­drum, the use of simple ratios for the dimensions of a temple, and making scale models. Consequently, Hahn focuses on Anaximander's achievements in astronomy and geography, being the fields where he .allegedly applied geometrical techniques. As an example of Anaximan­der's 'applied geometry', Hahn treats his use of the seasonal sundial which should have allowed him to construct terrestrial cartography. Hahn reproduces a sundial, discovered by Hunt, which is databIe to the second century BC. It is a device with a horizontal gnomon, on a wall bearing indications of the tropics and the equinox. Apart from the fact that Anaximander's gnomon presumably has been a vertical rod, this exemplar is rather instructive. Anaximander, Hahn argues, must have used his sundial in order to mark out the frame of his earthly map. That is, his sundial allowed Anaximander to mark out the limits of the earth (p.206).\n\nWhat can be.meant by these words 'frame' and 'limits'? The earth, according to Anaximander, is circular, its limits being fixed by the encircling Ocean (see Hahn's reconstruction of it on top of a column­drum on p. 210). Obviously, a sundial is of little help in defining this shape and these limits. In a footnote (p.285), however, Hahn assures that Anaximander is credited,not with a map ofthe earth (ge), but with a map of the inhabited part of the earth (oikoumene). Hahn's quotation of Aristotle' s construction in Meteorologica 363b1-1l points to a possible understanding of what can be meant. If we imagine an observer in Delphi, the center of the circular earth, we can draw an equinoctial east-west line (i.e., a line from equinoctial sunrise to equinoctial sunset) through Delphi to the limits of the earth in the Ocean. This line, which divides the circular surface of the earth into two equal halves; approxi­mately crosses Miletus in the east and the Pillars of Hercules, where the Mediterranean flows into the Ocean, in the west. North of the equinoctial line, and parallel to it, we can also draw a line from the point of sunrise to the point of sunset at summer solstice (supposing these points to lie on the circumference of the earth). This second line runs, roughly, through the Danube (the Ister) and just north of the Euxine. And south of the equinoctial line, we can likewise draw the line of the winter solstice, which runs, roughly, through the northern part of the Sahara and Aswan. The area between the two solstitial lines, the shape of which is oblong, coincides with what the Greeks used to call the oikoumene. This is the habitable region of the earth, where the civilized people live. North of this region it is too cold, and south of it people burn black by the heat of the sun. So, when Hahn says that Anaximander marked out the frame of his earthly map, he must mean the frame of the oikoumene, which is the habitable part of the earth, and not the frame of the map of the circular earth (ge) as a whole. The resulting confusion can be solved by stating that Anaximander drew a map of the earth (ge), and marked on it the frame of its inhabited part (oikoumene). How Anaximander is thought to have used his sundial in marking out this frame on a map, Hahn does not teIl, but can be deduced from the picture on p.207. All you have to do is to put a model of the circular earth (e.g., a column-drum) on a horizontal floor, erect a gnomon on its center, and mark where the shadow-llne from the northernmost point of sunrise in summer cuts the circumfer­ence of your model. Do the same (m.m.) for the other points of sunrise and sunset at the solstices, and the oblong frame of the oikoumene results.\n\nPivotal in Hahn' s book is the notion that Anaximander not only made the first geographical map of the earth, but also a map or model of the cosmos. Hahn takes this to mean a plan or aerial view of the cosmos, such as drawn by Diels. As regards a three-dimensional model, Hahn is more reticent. He avoids to say that Anaximander made or drew such a model, but states only that he imagined it (p.211). A short commentary on the available doxographical evidence would not have been out of place here. No testimony exists that Anaximander made a map or plan view of the universe. The only evidence is Diogenes Laërtius, who credits Anaximander with the construction of a sphaira. This word is usually translated by 'celestial globe'. Diogenes Laërtius, being confused about the shape of Anaximander's earth, savs that it is sphairoeides. Therefore, onr might wonder if by sphaira he did not simply mean a terrestrial globe. Terrestrial globes (spherical maps of the earth), however, are of a much later date. The earliest globes of the earth date from the time of Colum­bus' discovery of America.3 So Diogenes must have meant a celestial globe. But now the question rises whether he did mean a globe on which the celestial constellations were depicted, or a model in the sense of a so-called armillary sphere. A globe depicting the celestial constellations would not fulfill Hahn' s requirements. On the other hand, the attribution of a spherical model to Anaximander is an anachronism, as Hahn rightly remarks (p.216).\n\nNotwithstanding these meager results of the doxographical evidence, sufficient circumstantial evidence allows us to suppose that Anaximan­der drew a map or aerial view of his universe. One obvious way of reading the numbers he attributed to the celestial bodies is to consider them as instructions for drawing such a map. The instruction, then, reads somehow like this: take a compass and draw a little circle; this is the earth. Call its diameter 1 unit. Now leave one of the legs of the compass in the center, put the other leg at a distance of nine units and draw a circle; this is the inner rim of the star wheel. Now put the same leg of the compass at 10 units and draw a circle; this is the outer rim of the star wheel, etc., etc. This is also the way Hahn seems to look at it, for he says, speaking about Anaximander' s numbers:' Anaximander wrote the cos­mie syngraphe and then by means of a compass made an informal drawing' (p.187). The resulting plan view is also, as Hahn rightly notes (p.200), the visualization of Anaximander's argument for the earth's sta­bility: the earth stays in the center of the universe because of its equal distance from everything, as Hippolytus reports, or because it is equally related to the extremes, as Aristotle puts it.\n\nOn the other hand, no such circumstantial evidence exists whieh would indicate that Anaximander made a three-dimensional model of the cosmos as weIl. Hahn rightly argues that Anaximander' s universe is not spherical, but cylindrical, and he agrees that this can be best visual­ized by a kind of oblique aerial perspective, that is, seen slightly from above, as in the picture on pp. 217 and 218. It has to be in oblique aerial perspective ('an axonometric projection, a kind of oblique drawing', 216) in order to be clear, because an elevation view of those cylinders would only show a set of rectangles. If one imagines oneself looking from above into this set of virtual cylinders, the plan view of Anaximander's uni­verse results. One glance thrown at this picture demonstrates that it is very doubtful whether Anaximander either made a drawing in perspec­tive or construed a model with rings that exhibit two different move­ments, one turning around an axis and another sliding up and down that axis. Nevertheless, the picture is a correct representation of the move­ments of the celestial bodies as seen by someone who thinks, like Al1aximander, that the earth is flat and that the celestial bodies are like chariot wheels. We might say that this is the way Anaximander must have imagined the cosmos, without implying that he actually made such a model or drawing. Perhaps it is permitted to point out two misprints in the drawings: 1) where it says 'virtual earth', one has to read 'earth', and 2) the arrowed line with the figure 57° next to it has to be somewhat longer so as to match the height of the virtual cylinder of the up and down movements of the moon wheel.\n\n(Here is the picture from Hahn s book)\n\nEvidently, the starting-point of Hahn's considerations has been the doxographical report that Anaximander imagined the shape of the earth to be cylindrical, like a column-drum. Here, too, the doxographical evidence might have deserved more attention than the footnotes on pp. 278-279. Diogenes Laërtius' report that the shape of Anaximander's earth is spherical is commonly regarded as mistaken. In fact, the image of a column-drum is the interpretative result, subscribed by most authors, of a combination of three, rather corrupted, texts. In two of them, the shape of the earth is said to be like a column of stone, and in the third it is said to be cylindrical, its depth being one third of its width (or, according to some: its width being one third of its depth).4 Some scholars have wondered why Anaximander chose this strange shape. The strangeness disappears, however, when we realize that Anaximan­der thought that the earth was flat and circular, as suggested by the horizon. For one who thinks, as Anaximander did, that the earth floats unsupported in the center of the universe, the cylinder-shape lies at hand. Hahn has to be credited for being the first who takes this image of the column-drum worthy of a special study. He had to cope, however, with two handicaps. The first is that in the literature on Greek temples very little can be found on the height of column-drums, in contradistinc­tion to the length and diameter of the columns. The second handicap is that so little is left of the temples of Anaximander's time that many things, such as the length of the columns, have to be guessed or recon­structed. Hahn' s question is whether the image of a column-drum has a more than casual meaning. He argues that the use of this image is not incidental. Anaximander, just like his fellow-citizens, must have been impressed by the accomplishments of the architects who built the first big Greek temples in his backyard. Hahn shows that both philosophers like Thales and Anaximander, and architects like Theodorus, Rhoikos, Chersiphron, and Metagenes are credited with the same kind of achieve­ments in applied geometry and with writing a book in prose. Architects and philosophers were, we could say, fellow intellectuaIs. Hahn also shows convincingly that the upper side of a column-drum, which has been elaborated with the techniques of anathyrosis and empolion (both meant to ensure that one drum is exactly on top of the other), reveals a striking resemblance with the plan view of Anaximander' s universe. The portion of the drum inside the smoothly carved circumference ring (the result of anathyrosis) is chiseled out, making the interior surface concave. This observation entails an elegant confirmation of DieIs' reading guron ('curved', i.e., concave) instead of hugron ('moist') in Hippolytus' testi­mony on the form of the earth(p.196-7).5 However, the difficulty remains how to combine the concepts of a concave earth and an encircling Ocean.\n\nAs the doxography has handed down the measures that Anaximan­der assigned to the column-drum-like earth, its diameter being three times its height, Hahn wonders what the meaning of these dimensions could be. It is no coincidence, he argues, that Anaximander chose the 3 : 1 column-drum, for the column-drums at the archaic Heraion, Artemision, and Didymaion were roughly 3: l' (p.188). According to Hahn, drums less than 3: 1 (...) seemed to pose a problem, as their rarity shows' (p.147). Something seems to be wrong here. Most of the columns of still existing temples show ratios ranging, roughly, from1 : 1 to 3 : I, with an average of approximately 2 : 1.6 Still upright standing columns of the Didymaion (±300 BC), the height of which is 9 to 10 times the diiameter of the lower drums, count 18 column-drums, which results in an average ratio between diameter and height of the drums of 2 : 1. Reuther gives the exact measures of the eleven column-drums of the one remaining upright column of the Heraion IV (4th century BC).7 They result in ratios from 1.6 : 1 (the lowermost drum) to 2.5 : 1 (the second drum from top). As the upper half of the column is missing, one may suppose that the ratio went up to 3.5 : 1. It is hard to believe that in the archaic temples these dimensions were very different.8 Hahn himself shows how much painstaking work, such as the chiseling of the anathy­rosis, has to be done in order to make a column-drum fit precisely. The smaller the height of the drums, the more drums were needed for a column, so that assembling higher drums must have meant a timesaving procedure. It is also understandable that the upper drums were the smaller ones, because they had to be lifted to a height of 15 meters and more. The drums with ratios 3.4 : 1 and 3.9 : I, which Hahn shows (pp.156 and 158), must have been from the upper part of a column. Our conclu­sion is that no connection exists between the dimensions of Anaximan­:ier' s earth and those of the average column-drum.\n\nHahn joins the authors who champion the view that Anaximander chose the number 3 as a starting-point for the series 9, 18, 27, which denote the distances of the celestial bodies, measured in multiples of earth-diameters. Just like the architects, who modeled their temples according to a definite unit, Anaximander made the diameter of the column-drum-shaped earth the central module of his universe (see, e.g., pp. 148 and 187). The celestial wheels are each 1 module wide and at 9 (lx3x3), 18 (2x3x3) and 27 (3x3x3) modules distance from the earth. Hahn suggests that 9, the first number of this series, has also an architectural basis, and was related to the dimensions of the archaic Ionian column. As there is no complete column left, he has to appeal to reconstructions. These, however, are far from unanimous. As quoted by Hahn himself (p.145-6), the estimations of the relation of the archaic columnheight to the lower diameter range from 6.4 : 1 (Hogarth), via 8 : 1 (Wesenberg), 8.2 : 1 (Gruben),9 : 1 (Vtruvius), and 10 : 1 (Reuther), to 12.7 : 1 (Gruben and Kirschen), and even 13.3 : 1 (Gruben). Some authors admit that no conclusions can be drawn as to the length of the columns of archaic temples.9 To appeal, then, to a proportion of roughly 9 : 1 looks like pressing the data within the frame of a preconceived idea.\n\nColumn-drums, Hahn' s argument continues, make up a column, and the columns of a temple had a cosmic significance, as they divide the earth from the heaven. 'Anaximander imagined the cosmos to be a kind of temple, the cosmic house, along the analogy of the cosmic meaning of the column' (p.188). Just like the architects, Anaximander took a simple kind of ratio (1 : 2 : 3) in order to measure the distances of the celestial bodies. In this way, Hahn pretends to have found a solution for the problem of Anaximander' s numbers, which is not only elegant, but also allows for a new interpretation of his cosmology as the syngraphe of the cosmic temple. Anaximander applied, says Hahn, the architect's rule of proportion to cosmic architecture. He was a kind of architectural histo­rian of the built cosmos (p.9). However, both the mistake regarding the ratios of the column-drums and the inaccuracy about the proportion of the column height are like thorns in the flesh of this interpretation.\n\nAnaximander makes use, Hahn says, of the same kind of simple ratios that characterize the overall structure of the archaic temple' (p.187-­8). The ratios used by Anaximander may be simple (3 : 1 for the diameter and the height of the earth, and 1 : 2 : 3 for the distances of the celestial bodies), but they are different from the simple ratio 1 : 2 : 4 used by the architects (for the height, the width, and the length of a temple, see pictures on p. 78). Presumably, Hahn would defend himself by saying that Anaximander did not copy the architects slavishly, but let himself be inspired by their work (cf. pp. 10, 148). This does, however, not look like a convincing way to justify a theory. But there is more. Hahn suggests that Anaximander chose the column-drum as the shape of the earth, because the column of a temple symbolically separates, or con­nects, heaven and earth, just like the cosmic axis (p.87-8, 188). Against this suggestion speaks the fact that the cosmic axis is inclined to the surface of the column-drum-shaped earth, as can be seen on the pictures on pp. 217-18. This inclination, which is a topic of discussion in presocratic philosophy, amounts to 380(according to the latitude of Miletus) on Anaximander' s flat earth. So the column-drum of the earth would not fit into the alleged column of the cosmic axis, whereas column-drums of a temple are precisely fashioned, by the techniques of anathyrosis and empolion, in order to fit perfectly, as Hahn himself shows at length.\n\nLet us also look somewhat closer at the image itself of the cosmos as a temple. The temples of the architects were rectangular, with a triangular roof. The would-be cosmic temple, on the contrary, is cylindrical and made up of wheels. The contrast could. not be bigger. Moreover, there is a metaphysical argument against this interpretation. The temple is certainly meant as a kind of house for the god or gods. It is true that we are filled with awe by its bigness. But the very intention of a temple is also to transfer or guarantee a feeling of safety. Just as the human house offers a haven of safety within a hostile world, so the house of the god yields a safe place to mankind. Transposed to the image of the universe in a metaphysical sense, the world of Homer, with the celestial dome covering the flat earth (see p. 171) can be seen as a cosmic refuge, in which people can feel safe against the surround­ing Chaos. But it has been precisely Anaximander who broke with this idea of the universe as a safe and dosed space. He blew up the celestial dome and imagined the celestial bodies as being behind each other, and he assumed that the earth was hanging free in space, which immediatelv must have evoked the fear of falling in the minds of his audience, as his attempt to prove that there was no need for such a fear demonstrates.\n\nHahn certainly has a point in emphasizing the influence of the architects on Anaximander's astronomy. However, he seems to have been taken away by his enthusiasm when he asks us to look upon Anaximander's cosmos as a kind of temple, and at his astronomy as a kind of celestial architecture. He reads too much into the image of the column-drum. In a similar way, one who is impressed by Anaxi­mander's image of the celestial bodies as chariot-wheels could be tempted to imagine his universe as a celestial chariot (like that by which Apollo transports the sun), or perhaps as a celestial machinery. Or someone who thinks that the expression presteros aulos should be translated by 'the nozzle of a bellows', could be eager to look upon Anaximander's universe as a celestial blacksmith's shop, like Hephais­tus' forge in the Hades, or as a blowing and breathing organism. Anaximander, who wrote a rather poetical prose, as Simplicius tells us, seems to have been fond of all kinds of images and from different fields: architecture (column-drum), war-equipment (chariot wheels), flora (the bark of a tree), weather phenomena (the light of the celestial bodies compared with lightning fire), and jurisdiction (in fragment B1). We may wonder whether a better understanding of Anaximander is fostered by absolutizing one of these images.\n\nIf, then, Anaximander did not have the intention to look upon the cosmos as a kind of temple, the question remains what the meaning of the numbers he assigned lo the distances of the celestial bodies could be. By maintaining that Anaximander' s way of thinking was a kind of applied geometry Hahn follows, generally speaking, authors like Char­les Kahn, who have likewise emphasized that Anaximander provided a vision of the universe whose organization is revealed by geometry. The device of this vision is: 'he universe has an order, mortals can come to know it' (p.163). Anaximander's achievement is thought to have been the geometrization of the cosmos (p.32). The difficulty of this kind of interpretation is that Anaximander obviously did not get his num­bers by any kind of observation or measurement. That the celestial bodies are behind each other is not something we can see, let alone that these distances could have been measured in Anaximander's time. The question is not, as Kahn, quoted by Hahn, thinks, that 'the celestial dimensions given by Anaximander cannot have been based upon any kind of accurate observation' (p.273, our emphasis). Anaximander's num­bers are not based on observation at all. They are of a completely different order.\n\nIf we want to understand the real meaning of Anaximander' s numbers, we have to look elsewhere. As Hahn kindly quotes (p.173-4, 181 and note 73 to that chapter), another, and simple, explanation of the numbers is possible. In the Greek counting system, 9 (= 3 x 3) connoted great age, time, or multitude. So Anaximander's numbers, denoting the distances to the wheels of the celestial bodies, are readily interpreted as meaning that the stars are far away (at a distance of 9 = 1 x 3 x 3 earth diameters), that the moon is even farther away (18 = 2 x 3 x 3), and that the sun is farthest away (27 = 3 x 3 x 3). This interpretation of Anaximander's numbers has the advantage that it reveals the heart of his astronomical insights. Whereas the observa­tional astronomy of the Babylonians was enacted, so to speak, on the two-dimensional screen of the firmament, where the movements of sun, moon, and planets among the celestial constellations were ob­served, Anaximander put forward the conception of a three-dimen­sional universe, a universe with depth, in which the celestial bodies lie behind each other. The numbers 9, 18, 27, meaning 'far, farther, farthest', were his way of expressing his 'discovery of space' in a way which his fellow citizens were able to understand. Anaximander's new conception of the cosmos is not an observational achievement, let alone an achievement of applied geometry. Anaximander made use of mathematical notions (numbers) and equipment (compass) in order to explain and visualize this new conception. But this does not mean that the numbers are meant as a kind of pseudo-mathematical expression of measured distances.\n\nOne main intention of Hahn's book is to serve as a reminder that philosophical activity does not originate ex nihilo, but is embedded in a social and political framework. He sharpens this thesis by charac­terizing Anaximander asa transitional thinker: Our grasp of originality, not ex nihilo, required that we see innovation in the context of transition (p.19). By this he seems to mean that Anaximander was not yet able of making adequate observations and experiments, nor capable of using adequate (astronomical) instruments and theories. As Hahn puts itt: Anaximander was reaching out toward a structural explanation of the cosmos in an age that had only the vaguest conception of it (p.2). Anaximander' s cosmology is said to mark a transitional stage to succeeding centuries, in which observation and experiment come to play a more pivotal role in astronomical theories'(p.2). This kind of interpretation is in danger of missing completely the point of Anaxi­mander's achievement. Long before Anaximander, observation formed the very heart of astronomy The Babylonians, and to a lesser extent, the Egyptians, were excellent observers.10 Ptolemy, in the second century AD, used systematic Babylonian records of the movements of sun, moon, and planets, going back to the time of Nabonassar (747 BC), just because of their accuracy. The striking fact about Anaximan­der's astronomy, on the contrary, is that it is not observational astron­omy, although it does not contradict the observed facts. To call Anaximander a transitional figure amounts to measuripg his achieve­ments by our own standards, as if he did the same kind of things as we do, but in a more primitive or rudimentary way (see, e.g., p. 164). Of course we must realize that Anaximander's innovations did not develop ex nihilo, and Hahn certainly adds a new component to the picture of his cultural setting, but by characterizing a thinker who stands at the very beginning of Western science and philosophy as a transitional figure, is giving him too few credits. We can express Anaximander's originality more adequately by saying that he con­ceived a new paradigm of thinking. Conceiving a new paradigm is not a matter of observing, or measuring, or using primitive applied ge­ometry, but a matter of using the imagination.11 Sometimes, Hahn seems to hint at such an interpretation, e.g., when he says that Anaximander's 'magination drew upon architectural techniques (p.10, our emphasis), or that Anaximander imagined the cosmos from more than one viewpoint (p.215, our emphasis). We may gain more insight in the real meaning of Anaximander's achievements by acknowledging that we would not be able to conceive the universe the way we do, if he had not introduced this new paradigm. Anaximander no longer considered the heaven as a celestial dome like in a planetarium. He introduced the conception of a universe with depth, in which the celestial bodies make full cirdes, the earth floats unsupported in space, and the celestial bodies are behind each other. This completely new set of ideas is unique and unlike any vision of the cosmos in any other culture. With it, Anaxi­mander introduced a new paradigm, the paradigm of the western world-picture. Anaximander's achievement is much more important than one has realized up to now. He has been one of those mental giants who made it possible to look further, because he allows us to stand upon his shoulders.\n\nAs regards the appreciation of the reader, three types of books may be discerned. Some books repeat, in a more or less inventive way, already known theories; these are useful but boring books. Other books put forward theories the reader readily agrees with; these are agreeable but basically also boring. And there are books that open new perspec­tives and advocate new theories; these are the intriguing books that are worth disagreeing with. Hahn' s Anaximander and the Architects is such a book.\n\nOne final correction: Hahn quotes several times Before Plato: Studies in Ancient Greek Philosophy VI. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. This has to be: A. Preus (ed.), Essays in Ancient Greek Philoso­phy VI: Before Plato, Albany: StateUniversity. of New York Press, 200l. The publication of this volume has been delayed, which Hahn could not know at the time he finished his manuscript.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 Review of Robert Hahn, Anaximander and the Architects: The Contribution of Egyptian and Greek Architectural Technologies to the Origins of Greek Philosophy.

According to Kauff­mann, this is especially the case with columns that count 24 flutes. This is a weak point in his hypothesis, as 24-fluted columns are rare. Moreover, as the play of shadows on the flutes differs from season to season, this does not seem to be an adequate way to tell the time.\n\n3 The German geographer Martin Behaim constructed one of the fust terrestrial globes in 1492\n\n4 See DK 12All (Hippolytus), 12A25 (Aëtius), and 12A10 (Pseudo-Plutarch). Roller, another predecessor of Hahn's, tends to hold that Anaximander meant the entire column, and not a single drum (D.W. Roller, 'Columns in Stone: Ànaximander's Conception of the World, LAntiquité Classique 58 [1989] 185-9).\n\n5 Sometimes, Hahn's elucidation of architectural features is not sufficiently clear. He explains the additional concentric rings which sometimes appear on drum faces by saying that they were meant as guidelines in order to be certain of the exact center of the drum (pp.153-4, 196, 198). How this construction is supposed to work, he does not clarify. Geometrically speaking, it is the other way round: when we define the center. we are able to draw concentric circles.\n\n6 According to the construction plan of the naval arsenal in Peireus by Philon of Eleusis (340 BC), the lower width of the columns has to be 2 feet and 3 spans, and each column has to contain one 5 feet high drum and six 4 feet high drums, which results in a ratio of, roughly, 1 : 2 (!) (See R. Martin & H. Stierlin, Griechenland [Reihe: Architektur der Welt], Berlin, no date, 42). Hahn quotes part of this prescription on p. 110, but not the part on the columns and column-drums. In the archaic temple at Assos, the height of the drum is also greater than its diameter.\n\n7 O. Reuther, Der Heratempel von Samos (Berlin 1957), 2.13\n\n8 The one remaining drum of the temple in Pherai measures, roughly, 2 : 1. See E. 0stby, Der dorische Temple von Pherai (no date, no place), Abb. 16. And two pieces of drums from the archaic Didymaion have ratios of 3.4 : 1 and 2 : 1. See P. Schneider, 'Neue Funde vom archaischen Apollontempel in Didyma', in Säule und GebalK: Diskussionen zur archäologischen Bauforschung, Band 6 (Mainz am Rhein 1996) 76-83.\n\n9 E.g., W. Schaber, Die archaischen Tempel der Artemis von Ephesos (Waldsassen-Bayern 1982), 76, and G. Gruben, 'Das archaische Didymaion', Jahrbuch des Deutschen archäologischen Instituts 78 (1963), 78-177, at p. 153. One of the conclusions of a recent study is that looking for 'round' relations between diameter and length of a column does not correspond to the practice of the architectural design. These relations have never been the starting-point of the design. (J.J. de Jong, De wiskundige grondslagen van de Griekse en Romeinse tempelarchitectuur in theorie en practijk tussen de 4e en 1e eeeuw vChr (The Mathematical Foundations ofGreek and Roman Temple Architecture between the 4th and lst Century BC), dissertation [Leiden 1994], thesis 6). We have to thank Jan de Jong for his kind information on some issues regarding the measures of columns and column-drums. which confirmed our own conclusions.\n\n10 Whereas there is an abundancy of Mesopotarnian astronomical observations pre­served in cuneiform texts, the doxography on Anaximander mentions only one observational accomplishment, viz. the date the Pleiades set in the morning (DK 12A20). This testimony, by the way, shows that he was a better observer than Thales and Hesiodus. Nevertheless, the real meaning of his astronomical insights lies elsewhere."
