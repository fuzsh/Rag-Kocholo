Yet, for the Pythagoreans, this story does not describe the passive revolution of a circle, but a pathway for an active exploration of the All and return to the divine. This endeavor is strenuous as it occurs amidst a suspension within the double bind of nativity and fatality, again and again to be born and to die, and to be reborn as still another being.[1] The thread of the narrative, of reminiscence, is always severed with each demise amid the labyrinth of mortal existence. Yet, as the narrative is a rope of many threads, the persistent re-articulation of the narrative instigates a mnemopoiesis of remembrance that transcends the individual mortal life amid the broader travels of the soul.\n\nThe Pythagoreans, along with others, cultivated an ethos of an immortal soul, one thought to be capable of communion with the divine. For Homer, such a desire would have been hubris, even if it was not in the end articulated outside of his mythological ontology. Pythagoras, against the background of Homer’s portrayal of the thirsting soul, maintained the requirement of a body, of a ‘substance’, for its life and its expansion (but only during life, as the soul had its own integrity beyond body). Pythagoras articulated a philosophy of return of the soul to its divine source through yet another – though forbidden – possibility in the Homeric constellation. He turned the necessity of body into a virtuous topos of return of finitude to the infinite. Indeed, despite this ‘mingling of essences,’ Pythagoras remained true to the Homeric valorization of the life of the body, of this self that is remembered by the passive soul. Yet, as the shade can return to another body, and as the divine is the cosmos, the body becomes the site from which the pursuit of the All commences, finds its way, and it is the variety of bodies which are the successive abodes of the soul amid its transmigration through each of the circuits of the All.\n\nThe Pythagorean transgression of Homeric limits casts into relief a different relation of the soul to body, which is, in the narrative of transmigration, only one body amid a succession of others. The body, here, is not an end in itself, but ‘plays its part’ amidst a narrative that asserts a different destiny for the soul. Nor, is the soul always with body as is the case with the metaschematism of Leibniz.[2] Death is not the envelopment of body, but is the release of the soul into a transitionary topos in-between embodiments. Even for Homer, the soul or shade dwells in Hades, and thus, survives the death of the body. Pythagoras is simply changing the path and the destination of the soul – it now has a capacity to move along through differing bodies, each being a microcosm of the All. Once the soul has seen the All, has been the All, as the story goes, it will be the All.\n\nTransmigration distributes souls through the stirrings and strivings of beings; this soul migrates across body to body, flows through a labyrinth of instants, to chance upon the thread that keeps the fire of wisdom still burning. Each has been, and remains, to use Reiner Schürmann’s phrase, a traveler throughout and toward the All, but an amnesiac traveler, a wanderer who desires to fathom and abide the multi-dimensional depths of oneself and the world. In this sense, truth, as the wisdom of the path, is the same as being, as traveling upon the path, of remembering the truth of being from out of a fog of oblivion, the intoxication of the waters of Lethe. Remembrance is drinking from the river of Mnemosyne. And yet, it is strangely the fog of forgetfulness, which clears a space for novel disclosures, embodiments, for an expansion of wisdom arising amid an attempt to become the All. Since we can conceive of an existence which is cultivated in an oral tradition, in which truth is the same as being, we will need to critically engage caricatures of Pythagoras which set his mathematics over against his esoteric narratives of existence and the soul, or of an account which severs his theoretical from his practical philosophy.\n\nTransmigration is a poetic topos which opens the space for a complex indication[3] of existence amid a mnemotechnic[4] shelter for a philosophical truth that seeks to be attuned to the All. This topos abides a ‘mythopoetic symbol’ of the event and life of the All.[5] It is as an artwork, in the sense of Heidegger’s essay, ‘The Origin of the Work of Art’[6], that discloses truth as a poetics of being. The narrative houses and communicates a single teaching of that which is and how one is to live. Within its ‘symbolic nexus,’ in this way, transmigration abides the fundamental meaning and specific regions of Pythagorean thought. It is a cathexis which articulates the myriad facets of inquiry, both esoteric, philosophy and poly-theology, and exoteric, mathematics, cosmology, cosmogony and musical theory. An attentive re-telling of the tale of transmigration, from this perspective, would reveal all that which is tacitly assumed by such a “primitive narrative”: conceptions of body, perspective, praxis, and of soul, souls, kinship, number, geometry and music. These many strands come together in the Pythagorean philosophical movement, articulated in its narrative, the unity of which abides an ethos of the bios, or way of life, which encompasses not only the various facets and aspects, but also the destiny of lived existence. The bios is rooted in the cycles of recurrence which is an even more primary ‘unity’. For the Pythagoreans, existence and eschatology are separated only by forgetfulness.[7]\n\nEach of us belongs to the All, moves with the All; still each is distinct, one from another, as, for instance, with proximity and distance across the earth. Within the horizons of the narrative, such wisdom may be discoverable within one’s own self and world. Life, then, is a learning, a remembering, but simultaneously, an unlearning of that which is learned. This unlearning, forgetfulness, is not only a dis-integration produced via the world of actions, slowly gnawing away at the immediacy of Memory, but is an active forgetting of older patterns of thought amid the birth of novel possibilities. With each life, we plunge into the rhythmic flux of the world only in the end to forget this world as it seemed to be when we had originally set out upon our pathway toward the All. A forgetful soul wanders into another body and finds itself in-between other bodies, lives. Forgetfulness, as it allows for an awakening into a new opening, serves in the eschatological attunement of the All, as the silence between two musical notes. This temporary forgetfulness sets free the soul to a different wandering; to become a bird, as Orpheus had wished for himself. Between each incarnation we must drink from the waters of Lethe.\n\nYet, such forgetfulness is not, for Pythagoras, absolute as he is said to have remembered and recounted his previous lives. It must be granted that forgetfulness does have its uses and status as the criteria for differentiation of one incarnation from another. But, as transmigration is oriented to an immanent understanding of the All, there must the possibility of a remembrance of each previous transmigration. Indeed, it is this very possibility which grounds the philosophic a priori in Pythagorean (and Platonist) philosophy. It must be, in this way, much more than Dacier’s mere ‘cure by lies’.\n\nFor the Pythagoreans, it is only through the exploration of the All, and of becoming attuned with the All, that one may attain return to the divine. As each incarnation discloses a facet of the All, and as the goal of the exploration is enlightenment, these myriad instantiations are not to be regarded as undertaken for the sake of punishment, as with many strains of Platonism and Hinduism, but perhaps, as with the Buddhists and Taoists, as pathways of or along a way of learning, and of building a shelter for wisdom in the mythical narrative, in this case, that of transmigration.\n\nMethod and Scope\n\nNot only must we be aware that Pythagoras wrote nothing,[8] but we must also remember that the Pythagoreans were suppressed, exterminated, and the thought of writing down their teaching came only amidst the threatening horizons of this obliteration. Much is lost amidst such urgency, and consequently, we must keep close to that which is left behind by the Pythagoreans themselves, such as the monochord, the doctrine of transmigration, etc. and also to gather testimony from related sources so as to set forth an interpretation with the sufficient depth to do ‘justice’ to the Pythagorean teaching.[9]\n\nAt the same time, however, we will be forced to rely on testimony, much of which has been deemed unreliable in a tidal wave of attempts to define this void of evidence. This question becomes complex in that we are not only seeking an account of a 6th century B.C. philosopher, but are at once obliged to consider the historical archive of interpretations and treatments of this subject. We have for instance the Lives of Iamblichus and Porphyry, but also various ‘modern’ interpretations, such as Cornford, Guthrie, Dillon, and Wertheim. Yet, although this procedure remains necessary, the procedure of evidential authority remains essentially arbitrary in this case. What is ‘evidence’ in this case, and how does our perspective on the development of Presocratic philosophy influence our interpretation of ‘evidence’? To whom shall we listen? Only those who are primarily scholars of Ancient Greece? What of those who are mathematicians, or musicians? What of philosophers who are inspired by Pythagorean teachings? What of a Nietzschean, post-structuralist, or feminist reading of Pythagoras? Where do we, and, where can we draw the line? Are we in a circle? Or, should we, in a Kierkegaardian leap, seek instead to remember the myriad lives of our own soul, as Pythagoras counsels his disciples?\n\nIt is clear that since Pythagoras wrote nothing, we must rely to some extent on extant records. We must consider these in order to familiarize ourselves with the various perspectives of the doctrine of transmigration and of Pythagoreanism as such. But, we must also be certain to create a topos of inclusivity with respect to sources of knowing, to include references and hermeneutic practises or perspectives not treated or permitted in a Modern interpretation which operates amid the framework of a sharp distinction between science and religion.[10]\n\nIn light of this hermeneutical entanglement, I will open up the topos for the possible contributors to this project, according to a criteria of whether or not the various sources cast light upon the doctrine of transmigration. Of course, it remains our primary goal to unpack, as it were, the doctrine of transmigration in order to disclose the unity of Pythagorean philosophy – and this implies certain preliminary orienting decisions, such as the questioning of the received and echoed positivist reading. Opening up the field to differing voices will lend us some perspective and, in some cases, important ‘evidence’. We will, to some extent, with Robert Frost, be ‘playing tennis with the net down,’ or, with Wittgenstein, attempting to understand the grammar of use and the practices of existence which are disclosed through the narrative of transmigration. Yet, we will still be playing tennis. In this way, I have included the contributions from the extant fragments of the ‘Pythagoreans,’ such as Ocellus, Sextus Empiricus, Polus, Theages, and Theon of Smyrna, despite questions as to their authenticity and dating. I have also incorporated the insights of Marsilio Ficino, who, after all, was the first translator and interpreter of Plato and Plotinus in the West, after a millennium of eclipse, and has much to contribute, especially with respect to the reconstruction of the Pythagorean theoria and bios, as suggested in his own practical ethos.[11]\n\nSuch an interpretation which seeks to retrieve the unity of Pythagorean thought goes against the grain of a long standing tradition which dismisses the notion of transmigration as a ‘mere figure,’ or, as a ‘cure by lies,’ (Xenophanes, Hierocles, Dacier, Cornford, and in his own way, Riedweg)[12], thus, separating this doctrine from the status of ‘true wisdom,’ or, of ‘science’. Following dutifully in these footsteps, Cornford asserts that the very presence of the doctrine of transmigration in the Pythagorean corpus is a ‘symptom’ of a philosophy caught up in an inexorable web of contradictions, one which seeks to contain within itself utterly incompatible axioms, such as Monism and Dualism, ‘mysticism’ and ‘science’. In this way, Pythagoras became just another victim of the eliminative strategy of the logical positivists, who had pointed out, as they had done to almost every philosopher from Plato to Heidegger, a ‘confusion’ in his thought which was at odds with the ‘Scientific Worldview.’ In the following pages, I will argue against this interpretation of Pythagoras which projects upon him the segregation of ‘mysticism’ and ‘science.’ Instead, I will lay out an alternative interpretation of Pythagorean philosophy as magical in the sense that it exhibits a holistic harmonization of theoria and praxis amidst a sacred pagan ethos.[13] This harmony is most prominent in its interpretation of the body as a microcosm of the All, as the conduit for the life of the All, and a place in which one may seek to cultivate a bios of ‘attunement’ amid and as the All. In this way, a philosophical magic,[14] occurring amidst the horizons of an extended kinship of the All, would be a cultivation of harmony via the memory of the event of the All and of the bios of return.\n\nFollowing the lead of W.K.C. Guthrie, Dillon, Burkert, and Wertheim, I will interpret the notion of the transmigration of souls as a complex symbola, requiring for its possibility a notion of extended kinship, ‘extended’ as a transmigration of the limiting horizons of Homeric blood-kinship. The symbola implies a transgression of the mortal-immortal divide, as a kinship of the All, and thus, of the mingling of essences betwixt mortal and immortal. For Homer, again, such an aspiration for mortals was hubris. Poseidon tells Odysseus that without gods, man is nothing. With demise, for Homer, the mortal soul descends toward Hades, a cave of deficient similarity, craving blood, breath and body, fated to passively reflect upon a life that had been ‘completed’ in death. Any claim of a return to a divine source is undercut by Homer as mankind is a creation of Prometheus, a Titan, who was censured by Zeus. For Pythagoras, on the contrary, such a return is not a transgression, but a fulfillment of the soul amid an ethos of sacred praxis (bios) and thought (theoria).\n\nSuch an aspiration of return is ceaselessly disrupted by the death of the body, of bodies. But, as it is only from the body that such an aspiration of return can find its point of departure, with each death of the body and rebirth of the soul into a novel situation, there lies the possibility that this destination and purpose may be forgotten, ceaselessly postponed. It takes a work of cultivation to remember one’s own greater soul, that synoptic memory of all of one’s incarnations, or, in other words, of one’s pathway from and to the divine. In this context, the wanderer of Rimbaud, finding himself in ‘dark and scary places,’ makes up rhymes, plucking his worn out shoelaces as he would a lyre. He does not remember his aspiration, thrown into a world, happy to merely comfort his fear and mortal singularity with jests and mimicry. He is engulfed in the darkness of night and can only distract himself, lie to himself about his predicament. He has fallen away into a dream within a dream, into an oblivion darker than the Homeric soul in Hades.\n\nThe doctrine of transmigration tells the story of a differing chance, it sets forth a novel possibility, one which suggests that even in this mimicry and distraction, as poetic rhymes, lie seeds of remembrance, perhaps of a playing of the lyre ‘one foot beneath my heart.’ The silent aspiration of a return to the divine remains harbored in the heart which sets above the static din of forgetfulness. This aspiration can be recaptured through a path of remembrance achieved through a movement away from the forgetfulness of the divine. For Pythagoras, this path of remembrance is philosophy, a step back away from the overwhelming involvements of the din, and to see that which is and what must be. It is in this context that it is a preparation for death, an event the significance of which is limited within the horizons of an overriding task of a return. Death discloses the fragility of the mortal self, one who may recall it source in the divine and seek to cultivate an attunement with the All through a way of life of ever deeper remembrance.\n\nI will begin, in Chapter One, Sources of the Doctrine of Transmigration with a discussion of the array of source materials that will come into play in the present study. We will find that there are many sources, ancient and modern, which will be assessed in terms of their capacity to contribute to a plausible interpretation of early Pythagorean philosophy and its mythopoetic symbol, the doctrine of transmigration. I will place great emphasis upon the formative work of W.K.C. Gurthrie, which, in juxtaposition to the division of mysticism and science asserted by Cornford, sets forth an interpretation which is guided by a notion of philosophical magic and an extended kinship of the All, unified in the complex symbola of the doctrine of transmigration. I will argue that such a perspective will facilitate a unified interpretation of Pythagorean philosophy and a proper appraisal of the role and significance of the doctrine of transmigration. In Chapter Two: Beyond Mysticism and Science, Symbolism and Philosophical Magic, expanding on our prior consideration of Guthrie, I will argue that this symbol, if read in light of the Pythagorean oral tradition, serves as a mythopoetic shelter for the Pythagorean philosophy as a whole: a doctrine of the soul, of body, music, number, and of a bios of praxis and attunement. In Chapter Three: The Emergence of Mystic Cults and the Immortal Soul, I will explore the mytho-historical context of the emergence of Pythagoreanism and give a description and assessment of what Cornford and Burkert regard as the ‘revolutionary’ character of Pythagorean philosophy. I will tentatively follow this interpretation in terms of its displacement of Homeric blood kinship with extended kinship as friendship, yet, I will trace the significant continuity between Pythagoras and Homer with respect to the body. It will be in this context that we will most distinctly comprehend the radical difference between the magical and mystical interpretations of early Pythagorean movement. Indeed, the primary role that is played by the body in the narrative of transmigration gives much weight to Guthrie’s magical interpretation over against one that would have little use for the body and which regards it as merely a prison house or punishment. In Chapter Four: Philolaus and the Character of Pythagorean Harmony, taking up the insights of the previous chapter, I will explore the character of harmony in early Pythagorean philosophy through a juxtaposition of our Pythagoras with the 5th century ‘Pythagorean’ Philolaus who, contrary to the indigenous harmony of contraries (such as the musical opposition), advocated by the 6th century Pythagoreans, set forth a position which required an external mediation of ‘warring opposites’. Such a difference in perspective is significant in light of the fact that Plato is said to have borrowed a book about the Pythagoreans from Philolaus, and in this light, it will be argued that Philolaus, prior to Socrates, is perhaps the first ‘theoretical man’. In Chapter Five: The Alleged Critique of Pythagoras by Parmenides, I will return to Cornford in his contention that the subject of criticism of the Hexameter Poem of Parmenides was the Pythagorean containment within one ‘system’ of the principles of monism and dualism. Again, as in the case of Philolaus, I will argue that the character of Pythagorean thought consists in a harmony of opposites, of contraries, and not a contradiction, and would not have, in that way, been subject to the alleged critique of Parmenides. Moreover, taking the criticism of Cornford further, I will comment on his Parmenides, in contrast to the one of the Hexameter Poem who hears the goddess tell him that he should also learn the ways of mortal knowing. In Chapter Six: Between the Earth and the Sky, On The Pythagorean Divine, I will set forth a rough sketch of the Pythagorean divine through a consideration of the mythopoetic symbol of Apollo. I will argue that this symbol must be understood in its narrative context which was that of pagan polytheism. I will focus upon the ambiguity of Apollo, including questions of his gender, so as to set forth a richer conception of his divinity and of the meaning of divinity as such. In Chapter Seven: The Pythagorean Bios and the Doctrine of Transmigration, I will make good on my earlier claim that the doctrine of transmigration is a mythopoetic shelter for early Pythagoreanism by outlining the two pathways, or aspects, of the philosophy which are contained in the narrative. On the one hand, in The Path of the Event, I will provide a glimpse into what Cornford calls the theoria of the Pythagorean philosophy which includes the cosmology, cosmogony, number theory, the theory of body, musical theory, and the theory of the soul. On the other hand, in The Path of Remembrance or Return, I will give a sketch of the bios in which the Pythagoreans, living communally, attempted to orchestrate an ethos or way of life that was attuned to the divine All. Again, the primary significance of this practical form of life underscores the significance of the body and of the magical interpretation of Pythagorean philosophy. In Chapter Eight: The Platonic Rupture: Writing and Difference, I will outline the Platonic interpretation of the doctrine of transmigration in order to more distinctly specify the uniqueness of the Pythagorean teaching. Using the critical insights of Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy and Beyond Good and Evil, and of our own consideration of the merely intellectual significance of Philolaus, I will examine the doctrine of transmigration in a variety of Plato’s dialogues, emphasizing the persistent devaluation of the body, the attitude that transmigration was a means of punishment, and the debasement of the sensual world as one of suffering. In Chapter Nine: Plotinus: The Ascent of the Soul toward the One, as a further specification of the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration and its relationship to the bios, I will explore the doctrine in Plotinus, who unlike Plato, was committed to a practical ethos of the body as a pathway of ascent to divine. In Chapter Ten: Plotinus as Neoplatonic Mystic: Letter to Flaccus, in a continuing exploration of Plotinus, I will set forth a critical reading of his doctrine of ascent against the backdrop of his Letter to Flaccus, a Roman Senator, in which he laments the prison house of the body. It will be in this context that the doctrine of transmigration would be set forth as a philosophy of attunement with the divine all, and not a doctrine of ascent, as this would imply a diminishment of the body. I will close with an Epilogue: The Pythagorean Doctrine of Transmigration with a final juxtaposition of the magical and mystical interpretations of Pythagorean philosophy. It should be remembered that, in the age of the logical positivists, Cornford’s charge of mysticism would have been tantamount to a radical exclusion of Pythagoreanism from knowledge, if not from philosophy as such (and it is clear that the Vienna Circle had little time to attempt to take seriously the nuances with respect to the mystical aspect of philosophy, articulated in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus). It will be in this light that I will juxtapose what we have learned of the Pythagorean teaching with that of an authentic mystic, A.E. Waite, who, contemporary with the logical positivists, could be said to serve as an example of the mystic in this era. I will close with a reiteration of the primary desire of the Pythagoreans for an attunement of the life of the body with the All, which is a magical and not a mystical desire. In this light, there would need to be a revaluation of the doctrine of transmigration as its significance has been radically transformed in light of the interpretation of the early Pythagorean as advocates of a philosophical magic of extended kinship and attunement with the All.\n\nChapter One: Sources of the Doctrine of Transmigration\n\nEver since the Diaspora of the Pythagoreans, there has been testimony and interpretations of Pythagoras and his teachings. It does not begin with the dry chalkboard of the Pythagorean Theorem, or with the ridicule and caricatures of the religious Sage. These are later developments, and are furthermore circumscribed by the post-Christian distinction between science and religion, or reason and faith. There are very early texts however which not only mention the Pythagoreans, but assume a casual knowledge of their philosophy. Indeed, for ancient writers, Pythagoreanism meant a belief in the immortality of the soul in that they held mortality to be ultimately an illusion, just as a snake does not die when it sheds it skin. Pythagoreanism indicates a body of doctrine which indicates a pathway of return to the divine (via successive transmigrations). It would be very safe to say that the Pythagoreans were a minority, who held their own beliefs amid and against the received narratives of a Homeric underworld, of Paradise, or of Nothing. Yet, despite the wide agreement of early modern and ancient commentators, Pythagoras’ religious and “mystical” preferences – his doctrine of immortality – are not taken seriously by Late Modern scholarship, and are never considered as intrinsically related, even in a symbolic sense, to his mathematical or scientific significance.\n\nResisting this prejudice, I will lay out a sketch of the narrative of transmigration as the shelter[15] of the primary doctrines of the Pythagorean teaching. Transmigration is a topos which opens an inclusive place for the myriad perspectives of souls amid an eschatology of return. Pythagoras is resisting the mortal-immortal divide of Homer and is suggesting a pathway of transcendence. This pathway entails a radical transformation of our thinking in light of our own post-Christian topos. We cannot assume that we can simply understand ancient sources immediately as if by analogy to our own network of meanings. We are in a labyrinth of hear-say, of gossip, reportage, sympathizers, re-creators, philologists, hoaxers, theologists and philosophers. Let us only hope that in our wandering in the labyrinth, we will find Ariadne’s thread.\n\nDiogenes Laertius reports a testimony of Xenophanes about Pythagoras and his espousal of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls:\n\nOnce they say that he was passing by when a puppy was being whipped, and he took pity and said: ‘Stop, do not beat it; for it is the soul of a friend that I recognized when I heard it giving tongue.[16]\n\nThis jest (if it is one), one of many against Pythagoras, is possibly the only testimony by one of his contemporaries which connects him directly to the doctrine of transmigration. Yet, if we are to accept Cornford on this issue, there may also be the poem of Parmenides which is said to focus its attack on the Pythagorean advocacy of the doctrine of transmigration and its ‘religious’ containment of the contradictory principles of monism and dualism.[17] It is possible that this poem does attack Pythagoras since it is known that Parmenides was a student, while not a follower, of Xenophanes, and that Parmenides was a younger contemporary of Pythagoras. We will return to this issue below. Besides these sparse contemporaneous sources, however, there are only posthumous materials which refer to the doctrine of transmigration. Kirk describes our predicament as follows:\n\nPythagoras wrote nothing. Hence a void was created which was to become filled by a huge body of literature, much of it worthless as historical evidence of Pythagoras’ own teachings. It included accounts of Pythagorean physics, ethics and political theory as well as metaphysics; biographies of Pythagoras; and several dozen treatises (many still extant) whose authorship was ascribed to early Pythagoreans – although all of them (excepting some fragments of Philolaus and Archytas) are nowadays judged to be pseudonymous fictions of later origin.[18]\n\nKirk acknowledges that the several Lives of Pythagoras, written by Iamblichus, Photius, Porphyry and Diogenes Laertius contain valuable information, but describes these works as mere ‘scissors-and-paste compilations of the Christian era.’[19] Excepting that preserved by Photius, dating from the 9th century C.E., these Lives were composed in the 3rd century C.E., Porphyry and Iamblichus as writers in the Neoplatonic tradition, and Diogenes as a compiler of ancient philosophy. Each of these biographical works mentions the doctrine of transmigration.\n\nIn his work, The Life of Pythagoras, or On the Pythagorean Life, Iamblichus writes that death is a migration, one having a direction depending on the particular life that had been lived, and that there is a training of ascent which may overcome the descent to lower levels of being.[20] He also mentions the pre-existences of Pythagoras, and how the latter made use of this remembrance of his past incarnations to induce others to discover their former existences as well. Iamblichus writes,\n\nFor by the clearest and surest indications he would remind many of his intimates of the former life lived by their soul before it was bound to their body. He would demonstrate by indubitable arguments that he had once been Euphorbus, son of Panthus, conqueror of Patroclus.\n\nWhat Pythagoras, however, wished to indicate by all these particulars was that he knew the former lives he had lived, which enabled him to originate his providential attention to others, in which he reminded them of their former existences.[21]\n\nPythagoras, in this account, is distinctly connected to the doctrine of transmigration and this latter doctrine seems to provide a background for a pedagogical practice of regression or recollection. Pythagoras was said to have had a ‘divine sign.’\n\nPorphyry, in his work, The Life of Pythagoras, writes:\n\nMany of his associates he reminded of the lives lived by their souls before they were bound to their present body, and by irrefutable arguments demonstrated that he had been Euphorbus, the son of Panothus.[22]\n\nThis account, surely the source for Iamblichus, also contains the following reference to the doctrine of transmigration:\n\nHe taught that the soul is immortal, and that after death it transmigrates into other animated bodies. After certain specified periods, he said, the same events occur again, for nothing is entirely new; all animated beings are kin, he taught, and should be considered as belonging to one great family.[23]\n\nThese references provide specific information concerning the doctrine of transmigration as a practice of recollection, as a conception of the migration of the soul, and as a notion of the kinship of all life, ‘one great family,’ this having practical, ethical implications, such as vegetarian abstinence, etc.\n\nA short anonymous biography of Pythagoras, ‘preserved’ by Photius also refers to the doctrine of transmigration. In this account, it is written:\n\nThe Pythagoreans abstained from eating animals on account of their foolish belief in transmigration, and also because flesh-food engages digestion too much, and is too fattening. Beans they also avoided, because they produce flatulency, over-satiety, and for other reasons.\n\nAnd, in the next numbered statement:\n\nThey affirm that man may improve in three ways: first by conversation with the Gods, for to them none can approach unless he abstain from all evil, imitating the divinity, even unto assimilation; second, by well-doing, which is a characteristic of the divinity; third by dying, for if the slight soul-separation from the body resulting from discipline improves the soul so that she begins to divine in dreams – and if the deliria of illness produces visions – then the soul must surely improve far more when entirely separated from the body by death.[24]\n\nIn this account, there is a statement of the viability of a total separation of the soul from the body, one prefigured in dreams, and a connection between the doctrine of transmigration and vegetarian abstinence. There is also reference to a discipline, a training of ascent which aspires to higher levels of being, away from evil.\n\nDiogenes Laertius, in his The Life of Pythagoras, in addition to his account of Xenophanes’ jest, portrays the incarnations of Pythagoras. He writes:\n\nHeracleides of Pontus says that he was accustomed to speak of himself in this manner: that he had formerly been Aethalides, and had been accounted to be the son of Hermes, and that Hermes had desired him to select any gift he pleased except immortality. Accordingly, he had requested that, whether living or dead, he might preserve the memory of what had happened to him. While, therefore, he was alive, he recalled everything, and when he was dead he retained the same memory. At a subsequent period he passed into Euphorbus, and was wounded by Menelaus. While he was Euphorbus, he used to say that he had formerly been Aethalides; and that he had received as a gift from Hermes the perpetual transmigration of his soul, so that it was constantly transmigrating and passing into whatever plants or animals it pleased, and he had also received the gift of knowing and recollecting all that his soul had suffered in Hades, and what sufferings too are endured by the rest of the souls. (my emphasis)\n\nBut after Euphorbus died, he said that his soul had passed into Hermotimus, and when he wished to convince people of this, he went into the territory of the Branchidae, and going into the temple of Apollo, he showed his shield which Menelaus had dedicated there as an offering. For he said that he, when he sailed from Troy, had offered up his shield which was already getting worn out, to Apollo, and that nothing remained but the ivory face which was on it. He said that when Hermotimus died he had become Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, and that he still recollected everything, how he had formerly been Aethalides, then Euphorbus, then Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. When Pyrrhus died, he became Pythagoras, and still recollected all the circumstances I have been mentioning.[25]\n\nIn this account we have the explicit connection of the doctrine of transmigration and memory, this latter being the key to the hope of immortality, a thread out of the labyrinth of incarnations, of forgetfulness. There is also reference to a bloodless sacrifice at the altar of Apollo, who is conceived as the giver of life. The bloodless sacrifice is important for the soul ‘revolving around the circle of necessity, is transformed and confined at different times in different bodies.’[26] The soul is not simply immortal, but must inhabit the circle of necessity as the condition for its return to the divine. The habitation of the circle of necessity effectuates the existence and kinship of all life.\n\nThe accounts given in the various Lives of Pythagoras must be approached with some caution to the extent that they do not seem to rely on evidence which is contemporary to Pythagoras, except perhaps the jest of Xenophanes. These works also come long after Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus, and betray their own concerns and historical attitudes as we can see, for instance, in the Neoplatonism of Porphyry and Iamblichus. This issue will come into focus in our consideration of Plato and his displacement of a kinship of the body of the All via a kinship of only the soul and the divine.\n\nYet, even with the transmutations of later philosophies, the works must not surely be disregarded in our search for source material. But, to the extent that our question is that of the status of the doctrine of transmigration in the Pythagorean philosophy, there are only hints and anecdotes and not an explicit interpretation of the doctrine, although the various references to memory, abstinence, kinship of life, and the immortality of the soul are significant and will be helpful in our interpretation.\n\nThe evidence for Philolaus and Archytas, two sources among other later Pythagoreans and neo-Pythagoreans, Kirk deems to be reliable, but is fragmentary and of a doxographical character. The fragments of Philolaus do not refer to transmigration explicitly, although it may be implied as a possible meaning of many of his various inscriptions concerning the nature of the soul and of its immortality. Philolaus presents the soul in analogy to the motes in the air due to their constant state of motion. The soul is an attunement, a harmony of opposites, as with Heraclitus and Empedocles. It is described as a substance self-moved in eternal motion, having the character of similarity with the divine. And, through this movement, like will seek out like. Philolaus also reports Alcmaeon as saying that ‘men die for this reason, that they cannot join the beginning to the end.[27] Yet, the soul must join together this beginning and end, for\n\nthe soul cherishes its body, because without it the soul cannot feel; but when death has separated the soul therefrom, the soul lives an incorporeal existence in the cosmos.[28]\n\nEven though each of these tenets are compatible with the doctrine of transmigration, this does not necessitate that we attribute this tenet to Philolaus. Yet, this does still represent an eschatology of the soul, a soul which is, for most of the fragments of Philolaus, in kinship with All, and is similar to All. And, thus, it could seek to return to the All. We will return to Philolaus below in Chapter Four.\n\nArchytas comes in the 4th century B.C.E. and was a close friend of Plato. As with Philolaus, his contribution consists of a series of fragments which are concerned with a hierarchy of knowledge and the means by which one would attain to true knowledge. It is recorded, with a striking resemblance to Plato:\n\nThat is why thought must rise from things that are sensible, to the conjecturable, and from these to the knowledge, and on to the intelligible; and he who wishes to know the truth about these objects, must in a harmonious grouping combine all the means and objects of knowledge.[29]\n\nWhile this may be a Pythagorean goal, it is also a Platonic one, and this aspiration is expressed in a Platonic manner. And, despite Plato’s treatment of the doctrine of transmigration in the Phaedrus and the eschatology of the soul in the Phaedo, there must again be caution exercised, if we are to interpret the status of the doctrine, specifically, for early Pythagorean philosophy. Such an interpretation will require that fine lines be drawn between positions which with deeper examination will be seen to be incompatible. We will return to this matter later.\n\nThere is no evidence in the fragments of Archytas which would lead us to assume that he accepted or taught the doctrine of transmigration. Yet, this does not mean that it is not contained in lost treatises, but this merely underscores the uncertainty of the evidence of these fragments. Yet, if it is true that the microcosm is one with the macrocosm, then, each fragment must contain the signature trace of the philosophy as such. The significance placed upon harmony by Archytas indicates his compatibility with many of the theoretical implications of the doctrine of transmigration. Yet, we may find that what he deems as harmony is not consistent with that of the Pythagoreans of the oral tradition. As we will see in the case of Philolaus, a thematic to be explored in greater detail below is that of the notion of harmony and its relationship with the world. Archytas writes:\n\nGod is the artist, the mover; the substance is the matter, the moved; the essence is what you might call the art, and that to which the substance is brought by the mover. But since the mover contains forces which are self-contrary, those of simple bodies, and as the contraries are in need of a principle harmonizing and unifying them, it must necessarily receive it efficacious virtues and proportions from numbers, and all that is manifested in numbers and geometric forms, virtues and proportions capable of binding and uniting into form the contraries that exist in the substance of things. For, by itself, substance is formless; only after having been moved towards form does it become formed and receive the rational relations of order. Likewise, if movement exists, besides the thing moved, there must exist a prime mover; there must therefore be three principles: the substance of things, the form, and the principle that moves itself, and which by its power is the first; not only must this principle be an intelligence, it must be above intelligence, and we call it God.[30]\n\nThe proximity of Archytas (who sounds here much like Aristotle) to certain fragments of Philolaus and to the text of Plato immediately places a question mark over his severance of form from ‘formless substance’, as if the body of the cosmos did not have its own indigenous harmony in the unity of limit and the unlimited. This proximity will become clear in our consideration of Plato’s treatment of the body in the context of the doctrine of transmigration. Anticipating Christianity, the body becomes the ‘other,’ of matter, evil, it does not belong with a Platonic Divine which is no longer of the All (the body of the cosmos), but is recognized by its flight from the All. We will see that it is the pre-understanding and valorization of the body which coordinates these respective interpretations of transmigration. To foreshadow this problem, Archytas writes:\n\nFor an exact discernment of these goods, we should outline its proper part for the divine element, and for nature; yet some do not observe this relation of dignity from the better to the worse. But we do so when we say that if the body is the organ of the soul, then reason is the guide of the entire soul, the mistress of the body, this tent of the soul, and that all the other physical advantages should serve only as instruments to the intellectual activity, if you wish it to be perfect in power, duration and wealth.[31]\n\nThis vision of Archytas complements Plato’s own perspective of the respective status of the soul and the body, of eternity and time, a perspective which is organized by an overriding commitment to an interpretation of philosophy as a merely intellectual activity, as the lifeworld of the theoretical man. The importance of this point will become increasingly clear throughout the following pages. Suffice it to write that the doctrine of transmigration, as it relates in an essential way to the body, will be configured according to the status of the body and the world. In addition, as I will detail below, the conception of philosophy as an intellectual activity stands at a distance from the Pythagorean insistence upon a bios, as a magic, a sacred praxis of the body.\n\nHowever, since we have virtually no evidence, we will also consider the work of Plato, and we will find that it is helpful, if only to provide a contrast to the Pythagorean perspective and praxis. Kirk writes of our dilemma of interpretation:\n\nIt is notorious that Plato’s metaphysics is deeply imbued with ideas we recognize (even if he did not avow) to be Pythagorean. The Phaedo, for example, eloquently recreates an authentically Pythagorean blend of eschatological teaching about the fate of the soul with ethical and religious prescription, and sets it in the Pythagorean context of a philosophical discussion between friends. (Burnet felicitously suggested that ‘the Phaedo is dedicated, as it were, to the Pythagorean community at Phleious’, EGP, 83 n.1) But just because Plato is reworking Pythagorean materials, the historian of Presocratic philosophy has to be cautious in using the Phaedo as evidence even of early fourth-century Pythagoreanism, let alone Pythagoras’ own philosophy. At the same time, it would be wrong and in any case impossible not to let the Phaedo and other dialogues influence our picture of early Pythagoreanism.[32]\n\nBut, we must always keep in mind the distance of Plato from the 6th century Pythagoreans, and attempt to consider the possibility that even if genuine Pythagorean notions and manners of expression are preserved in the Platonic text, these phrases and ideas have been absorbed into a differing philosophical organization. This point speaks not only to the distance of Plato from the Pythagoreans, a distance occupied by the suppression of the Pythagoreans, written Pythagoreanism ala Philolaus, and the Peloponnesian War, to name only a few indices. What I am also bringing to focus is the distance of the Platonic text from Plato himself, a point that concerns the problem of any ‘modern’ interpretation of the Ancient Greeks, a problem which brings philosophy and history into dialogue. Jacques Soustelle writes, in his The Four Suns:\n\nPlato’s work… is separated from modern philosophy not only by a specific number of sidereal revolutions, which are nonhuman phenomena, but also, on the strictly human level, by the fact that we can trace the development of classical ideas and their successors up to our own ideas through the meditation of the thinkers and the schools of the ancient world, of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.[33]\n\nIt is with these genealogies in mind that the ancient sources will be considered, as indicating a problem of interpretation which is irreducibly ‘modern,’ or, perhaps, ‘post-modern.’ As we consider the ancient sources that we do have and begin to move closer to the early Pythagoreans, we will have to draw some fine lines between the various ancient sources, and also lines between the various ‘modern’ interpretations.\n\nThis approach to sources implies however that other treatises and compilations, such as the Golden Verses and the Pythagorean sentences of Sextus Empiricus must stand on an equal footing, among others, including the post-Aristotelian text of Ocellus Lucanus, On the Nature of the Universe. Even those writings of pseudonymous or dubious authorship have some usefulness in that these provide an inducement to think through the contours of the doctrine of transmigration.\n\nAnd, in the light of a deficit of direct evidence, we must be able to draw upon our own resources to think through the implications of this plethora of indications. In this way, the question of the status of the doctrine of transmigration will remain of primary importance. We have paid heed to the various modern interpretations of the doctrine of transmigration. For although these will provide little new information concerning the doctrine, these interpretations not only enframe our own epochal perspective of Pythagorean philosophy and the doctrine of transmigration, but also, if read together with the ancient sources, allow for a fresh perspective on this matter to emerge.\n\nThe authority of modern ‘theories’ of the doctrine of transmigration is due, to a great extent, not only to the paucity of indigenous evidence, but also to the lack of an explicit interpretation of the status of the doctrine of transmigration in posthumous ancient sources. Modern sources, however wrong they may be, provide such an interpretation of this doctrine. In this way, they serve to ‘break the ice,’ if you will, they start the discussion in the near proximity of our peers. Yet, caution will be exercised to the extent that what is sought in this present work, as much as it is possible, is an interpretation of the doctrine transmigration vis-à-vis its status for the Pythagorean community, and not one which remains entangled in the modern distinction between ‘religion’ and ‘science.’ In the following, there will be contributions to our discussion of the doctrine of transmigration by Marsilio Ficino, M. Dacier, F.W. Cornford, Walter Burkert, W.K.C. Guthrie. On the basis of this discussion, I will set forth a tentative interpretation of the status of the doctrineof transmigration in Chapter Two, Beyond Mysticism and Science: Symbolism and Philosophical Magic.\n\nMarsilio Ficino\n\nMarsilio Ficino, said to be the greatest philosopher of the Renaissance, teacher of Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Pico, must hold pride of place in this list of ‘modern’ (after the recovery of ancient manuscripts) commentators. Under the auspices of patronage from the Medici family, Ficino, born in 1430, translated, by the time he died in 1499, almost everything that we know as Plato, Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, not to mention his fruitful connections with the thinkers of the Islamic world. On this basis alone, we can consider Ficino to be quite important as a formidable commentator and translator. His translations and commentaries have opened up worlds previously hidden, and much of what we know of the Pythagoreans emerges with his work.\n\nHowever, Ficino was also an important philosopher, doctor, and ‘dissident’ Roman Catholic priest in his own right. He advocated a bios amid the mythopoetic horizons of cosmic magic, and composed symbolic treatises in which a way of life was to be lived, a way which promised health and longevity. The mythopoetic orientation of the way of life was of a work of attunement circumscribed within a theurgical excession of the world via emanations from a fruitful divinity, one so vast that All, the eternal cosmos in its plethora of cycles and each traveling star and planet, become its symbols.\n\nIn his Book of Life, composed of three books, On Caring For The Health Of Students, How To Prolong Your Life, On Making Your Life Agree With The Heavens, Ficino sets out a symbolic terrain, which describes an astrological, magical, and mythopoetic matrix of signs coordinated by a singular affirmation of the presence of the divine in all things, that the world is the body of the divine. To this extent, he recommends a manifold of magics, medicines, potions, and tonics in order to bring the body into a condition of temperance.\n\nThe first book gives a description of the problems that can beset students, such as the black bile of melancholy, and recommended various courses of action to not only heal but to strengthen the student. The second book focuses on the problems and concerns of the aged, and provides a detailed list of suggestions, such as massage, sunshine, certain colors and sights, odors, a conversation, and once again various potions and tonics, regimens of working and reading, not to mention various metallic and talismanic images and amulets to bring vitality back to the life of an older person. As an example, Ficino writes concerning the tonic effect of music upon the soul:\n\nMercurius, Pythagoras, and Plato claim that a dissonant soul, or a sad one, is helped by strumming a lyre and by constant singing and melodious playing. David, the holy poet, freed Saul from unhealthiness with his psaltery and psalms. I, too (if it is permitted the lowest to appose the highest things), have often found out at home how much the sweetness of the lyre and song avail against the bitterness of black bile.[34]\n\nThese books provide us with a vivid description of the interplay betwixt the body and the thoughts and actions of the self amidst a way of life devoted to making oneself ‘agree with the heavens.’ The self interacts within a cathexis of symbols and pathways, wandering through the labyrinth, guided by its intimate relation and kinship with the world and cosmos. This one with ‘rage in the heart,’ the one who seeks to open the ‘poetic doors’ must become aware of her way of being, in all of her intimacy, and seek to construct a bios appropriate to the ends desired, for the ends and the means must be one and the same. Like is only drawn only to, and through like.\n\nThe third book is more comprehensive than the first two and sets out a broader horizon of the cosmos, invoking the project of making oneself attuned with the universal harmony of All. Once again it gives detailed recommendations concerning the powers of the stars and of the various rules for making talismanic images and amulets, rules regarding time, place, positions, aspects of various celestial entities, the seven planets, the fixed stars.\n\nThere is a strong astrological semiotic at work throughout the discourse which contributes to a symbolic architecture coordinating various meanings of signification with respect to the attunement of the self with the All. Astrology harbors within itself a means of temporal designation amidst a mythopoetic horizon which is tangible and intelligible. It is thus one symbol system along with others which allows us to gain orientation amidst world, life and death, in our pursuit of a return to the divine. Another symbol that we see in his work is music which acts as the conduit and symbol of the harmony of the ‘opposites’ of the world. These various symbols and symbolic sites are not to be ends in themselves, nor are these just disposable and ephemeral ‘images.’ They have intrinsic reference to a way of life which is seeking to cultivate a harmony with the divine.\n\nFicino writes concerning this work of attunement:\n\nDo this work so that you are turning in perpetual motion with these powers, avoiding fatigue, so that you will set the right motion against the external motions that are secretly harmful, and so that you will imitate the heavenly movement for the sake of its powers. But if you are able to go through very large spaces with these movements, you will be imitating the heavens even more and you will attain the many powers that the heavens have scattered here and there.[35]\n\nIn this context, we could think of the ‘music of the spheres,’ yet, a music that we could also see, taste, smell and touch, one which made the body and the self ‘dance’ along amidst a similar rhythm. Ficino makes many references to Pythagoras throughout the Book of Life, in which the Magus is referred to as an undisputed authority. In a similar way, he makes such references to Plato, Peter Abano, and to the Islamic philosophers, among others. He holds also, as is unavoidable in this era, that Mecurius preceded Pythagoras.\n\nIn the Book of Life, Ficino does not mention transmigration, yet, as with most of the fragments of Philolaus, there need not be a conflict of his positions with the doctrine. Indeed, in his focus upon the care of the soul and body, and of his vision of the sameness of the microcosm and the macrocosm, in his affirmation of the All, we will see, is fully in accord with what we know to be Pythagorean tenets and practises. However, we must keep in mind his status as a priest of the Roman Church, and of his experience of the ceaseless harassments by the Orthodoxy. Despite this possible self-censorship, Ficino opens our eyes to not only the symbolic interpretation of actuality, but also to the intimate care of the self which is the accomplice of the desire for return.\n\nIt is in this sense that Ficino will mainly contribute to this discussion, in the chapter, ‘The Path of Remembrance, or Return,’ in which is described the elements of a way of life seeking attunement of the self amidst the All, and thus, to return to the divine via the pathway of transmigration. He gives us an intricate and proactive way of being which, in its ancient philosophical orientation, can serve as an example of a ‘synchroncity’ of theoria and bios. This example, just as can those described by Iamblichus and Porphyry, provides us with a cautious, provisional model of the way of life bound up with the doctrine of transmigration. Perhaps, it will be Ficino’s symbolic orientation and exquisite practical sense and imagination that will provide us with the plethora of clues to a deeper insight into the early Pythagoreans.\n\nAndre Dacier\n\nThe lack of direct evidence concerning the relationship between Pythagoras and the doctrine of transmigration had lead Dacier, writing in 1707 in his Life of Pythagoras, containing the Commentary on the Golden Verses by Hierocles, to repudiate any essential association of Pythagoras with the doctrine of transmigration. He contends that there is no mention of the doctrine in any of the extant texts, including the Golden Verses, a claim that is debatable. He further maintains that Pythagoras, even if he is portrayed as its advocate by Xenophanes, was not the author of the doctrine.[36] Following Herodotus, he claims that the doctrine is Egyptian and that some Greeks had taken it over dishonestly, claiming it to be their own.\n\nFurthermore, Dacier reconciles his insistence that Pythagoras did not nor could not believe in the doctrine of transmigration by citing Hierocles in his position that transmigration is a fiction. The human soul is singular in its eternal essence, returning to the divine with the death of the body, once. It is incompatible with other bodies due to this singularity and pre-eminence of form.[37] In this light, Dacier characterizes the doctrine as simply a figure to communicate the truth that a good man will, at death, be set free to a being of eternal felicity in the Christian Heaven. To further buttress his position, he cites Timaeus of Locri, in a document that has itself been dated to the period of Middle Platonism,[38] where it is stated that one must ‘cure by lies’ if one does not acquiesce to the truth by reason.[39] In this account, therefore, the doctrine of transmigration is simply a figure taken over from the Egyptians and is just a ‘lie,’ deployed as a technique; it, in other words, has only a negative, or constraining, significance. In this way, it is not an essential aspect of the Pythagorean teaching.\n\nDacier’s impetus for writing, he admits, is a situation in which some of his contemporaries, who as ‘poets and thoughtless philosophers’ teach the doctrine of transmigration as if it were a literal truth, as did some of the Orphics, who sought to cross over into the body of a bird, or, as something else besides. Since they have embarked upon this irresponsible and unproductive path, Dacier charges that these preachers do not understand the significance of this figure, and thus, have no understanding of the ‘true’ teaching of Pythagoras. Dacier writes that the truth is that transmigration is not relevant; it is a simply a hangover from the ‘past.’\n\nFor Dacier, the doctrine of transmigration must be understood by means of the distinction between fable and science. It may be a useful figure in the education of the irrational or young, but since the goal of this education is truth, eventually this figure must be seen as such a fiction, and as inessential, be cast aside.[40] In many ways, this position set forth by Dacier can be seen as a guarded response to the jest of Xenophanes. Dacier would admit that this doctrine is laughable, if one merely regards it as a literal truth, or, ultimately, even as a symbol.\n\nBut, in fact, the doctrine cannot be literally true vis-à-vis Hierocles, for this contradicts the eternal essence of the soul. And thus, for Dacier, the laughter is not ultimately merited, for like the tale of Hades, transmigration is a potent medicine for the disease and division of the soul. In this way, although just one figure among many, the doctrine of transmigration is of the utmost seriousness. Yet, despite this correction to Xenophanes, Dacier in fact agrees with the latter in that the doctrine of transmigration is in essence false, despite its brief pedagogical usefulness.\n\nF.M. Cornford\n\nIn many respects, Cornford, in two of his essays, Mysticism and Science in Pythagorean Philosophy and Divisions of the Soul, simply repeats this time-honored distinction between Fable and Science. In the former essay, he sets out two distinct systems in the Pythagorean tradition, a ‘mystical system’ of the 6th century and a ‘scientific system’ of the 5th century, which he also calls number-atomism. That which separates the two ‘systems’ is the critique of Pythagoreanism allegedly set forth by Parmenides in his hexameter poem. By means of this demarcation, the doctrine of transmigration is quarantined from the ‘scientific’ regions of inquiry. In this view, the doctrine, if it is still expressed at all, is simply a fable surrounding outdated ethical practices.\n\nFor Cornford, Parmenides, in his delineation of the two paths, is criticizing Pythagoreanism for its containment of the axioms of monism and dualism, expressed most forcefully in the doctrine of transmigration. Cornford writes:\n\nBoth the axiom of Monism and the axiom of Dualism are implicit in the doctrine of transmigration, which was certainly taught by Pythagoras. All souls come from one divine source and circulate in a continuous series of all the forms of life. Each soul involved in the conflict of good and evil, seeks escape from the purgatorial round of lives and deaths into a better world of unity and rest. Any philosophy that arises from a religion of this type is threatened with internal inconsistency. On the one hand, it will set the highest value on the idea of unity and, at this stage and long afterwards, the notions of value and reality coincide. Unity is good; reality must be one. On the other hand, Nature will be construed in terms of the inward conflict of good and evil, appearing in the external world of light and darkness. Light is the medium of truth and knowledge; it reveals the knowledge aspect of nature – the forms, surfaces, limits of objects that are confounded in the unlimited darkness of night. But it is hard to deny reality to the antagonistic power of darkness and evil. Hence, the tendency to dualism – to recognize not the One only, but two opposite principles.[41]\n\nCornford lays out the contradiction: one the one hand, the doctrine wishes to say that All is Unity, One, Monism, in its statement of a universal kinship of all, and of the communion of the soul with the divine. On the other hand, it also wishes to assert Dualism, that the soul has come to be in the world and that there is the necessity of a change, of a movement of ascent to return to the divine, a position in seeming conflict with the first proposition. For Cornford, accepting the programme of the logical positivists, contradiction cannot be interpreted in any other way than as that which must be eliminated. But, what of other possibilities, of the dialectics of Hegel (a student of Parmenides and Heraclitus) or the eternal recurrence of the Same of Nietzsche (a student of Heraclitus and Empedocles)? Is it necessary, after Wittgenstein and Heidegger, to bow down to the laws of formal logic? Ignoring other possibilities, however, Cornford sets forth his reading of Parmenides and of his supposed segregation of the realms, as the only criteria available to decipher the early Pythagoreans. This is his Archimedean point. Cornford, with this reading, must make a strict separation of rest and motion, eternity and world; he must separate the ways. The Byzantine, Egyptian, Greek or indigenous fashion of mingling the spheres does not meet the modern criteria of truth. Cornford holds that this conflict of realms is typical of religious philosophies or of philosophies which have a religious dimension as their basis.\n\nThe ‘mystical system’ contains within itself a mingling of religious elements and those inquiries, such as number theory, which will, in the 5th century, be separated from the former in the formation of a ‘scientific system.’ It is with this transformation that the two systems are segregated, and it is with this that the doctrine of transmigration becomes merely of religious, or, in this portrayal, ‘mystical,’ significance and will begin to acquire its prejudicial connotations. In his essay, Divisions of the Soul, Cornford details his ‘religious,’ pseudo-Platonic interpretation of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. The religious dimension emerges with his unexplored mention of a possible diffusion from the Buddha to Pythagoras of their shared belief in transmigration. He allows this to remain unanswered, but writes that this belief ‘in more or less crude forms, exists among barbarous peoples.’[42] In other words, questionably, he contends that this belief diffuses from ‘barbarous,’ unevolved peoples. With regard to this belief in Greece, Cornford writes:\n\nIn Greece, at any rate, we have here an instance of a belief adopted from a lower strata of culture by a certain section of a highly civilized people. In such a case, the belief is cut loose from its original roots. Only the part of its primitive content is taken over, which responds to some unsatisfied need already felt by the people who adopt it; its previous history and associations are left behind.[43]\n\nThe unsatisfied need that compels the absorption of ‘primitive’ belief, Cornford claims to have found expressed in the poetry of ‘Orphic religion.’ Without providing any textual references or detailing the connection between Pythagoras and the Orphics, he writes that the need for this belief in transmigration emerges from an experience of a ‘divided self.’ This experience comes with the awakening of the soul amidst the dimension of phenomenal life.\n\nHe contrasts this conception of the soul as transmigrating, and thus, as immortal, with the Homeric soul-shadow of eidolon. In this context, transmigration is the pathway from the mortal realm to that of the immortal. The soul comes from the divine and returns to the divine; it is not a shadow of passive recollection. In effect, he situates the experience of a ‘divided self’ in the context of the realization that there is a soul which ‘possesses powers of its own, superior to the bodily function.’[44] The soul finds itself amidst the phenomenal world, but it is divine ‘by origin and nature.’[45] The soul is the divine amidst nature, and it is more enduring and of greater value than the ephemeral world. Cornford describes this alterior conception of the soul:\n\nIt is a daimon, a spirit, endowed with supernormal powers of cognition in vision and ecstasy and with a moral nature intrinsically good.[46]\n\nYet, despite its divine source and nature, the soul has been detected as being with body in the experience of the divided self. In this way, its divinity must in some way be compromised. Cornford writes in phrases reminiscent of Plato’s Myth of Er:\n\nOn the other hand, during its round of incarnations, it is called ‘impure,’ tainted with prenatal guilt, to be expiated by the sufferings of terrestrial life and of purgatory. Of the origin of this evil taint only a mythical account can be given, in the story of some primal sin.[47]\n\nIn an amplification of his religious interpretation, he writes that he does not wish to imply a distinction between body and soul, but, one of spirit and flesh. This distinction parallels his discussion in Mysticism and Science in that the terrain of the division in the self becomes one of desire and asceticism. He writes:\n\nHere, in the concept of a divine but impure spirit, we have, not the old contrast of soul and body, but an opposition of higher and baser desires within the soul itself. The lower desires are rooted in the Flesh with its senses, its feelings of physical pleasure and pain, its hopes and fears, loves and hatreds. This cluster of functions we may call the animal soul, whose central aim is the preservation of the mortal life in a material world. So man conceives himself as a divine spirit imprisoned in the Flesh – for we may adopt a religious name for the body with its animal soul.[48]\n\nOne can hear the Platonic and Christian overtones of this passage, which are inescapably wedded, as Nietzsche suggests, to an hierarchy of value. Such a perspective asserts an exclusive hierarchy between world and divine, grounded upon the distance between matter and the divine (form), and upon a devaluation of the sensuous phenomena and life. The animal soul is not the ‘real’ soul, and, thus, is cast into Tartarus. The world is not the truth; thus, it does not matter. As I will detail in the following chapters, it is certainly not clear if such an interpretation can facilitate an understanding the perspective of the early Pythagoreans. Not only is there an implication of nihilism in Cornford’s portrayal of the higher soul, but there is also another positing of hierarchy between science and religion, the most important aspect of this hierarchy being the segregation itself.\n\nIn his deployment of ‘Orphic texts’ for his speculative interpretation of Pythagorean philosophy, Cornford assumes that all religious experience is in an essence the same, and thus, the doctrine of transmigration, in that it has been deemed to be of religious character, must also be a participant in this sameness. In this architectonic, since transmigration cannot ever be proper science, it must be religion. Cornford writes:\n\nThe religious antithesis of the Spirit and the Flesh is perpetuated in the earlier of our two philosophic divisions of the soul – the twofold (as opposed to the three-fold). We observe that the believers in transmigration are so deeply penetrated by the consciousness of this division that they carry the idea of separation to its furthest point. The Spirit and the Flesh may be called parts of our nature in the fullest sense. They are actually separated at death, when the Spirit passes into another form, while the animal soul is extinguished; and even during life they remain not only distinct but antagonistic. The Flesh is no more than an ‘alien garment,’ a ‘prison’ or a ‘tomb.’[49]\n\nThe need for, or, the therapy of a disposable belief such as the doctrine of transmigration comes about, for Cornford, through the experience of the ‘divided self,’ and of an intense consciousness of this division. The ‘self in conflict’ is the designation of an experience of the divine flickering amid the terrestrial, mortal abyss, a situation in which the Spirit and Flesh do battle for the duration of this life. Under this schizophrenic pretext, as Deleuze might join in, it is the duty of the self to differentiate, to divide itself between higher and baser potentialities, betwixt selves. Cornford writes:\n\nWhen man thus divides his nature into a divine and an animal part, disowning the lower part as alien and hostile, it means that he identifies himself with the higher and considers this to be his ‘true self.’[50]\n\nCornford designates this prioritization of the ‘true’ self as indicative of a pessimistic philosophy, which is ‘in love with death.’ This pessimism denotes the realm of sense as incompatible with the aspiration of immortality. For, in the release of the divine spirit from its captivity, death is an event which, if the soul has undergone adequate preparation, qua asceticism, will allow the soul to transcend these punishing rounds of incessant incarnations. In his view, the realization of the divided self is an invitation for the soul to choose that aspect of itself for a cultivation which will lead to its eventual, and peculiar, return to the divine. Cornford does not even mention, however, the bios of the Pythagoreans, the primordial status of the body as a symbol of the All,[51] nor, the possibility that Pythagoreanism was a pantheism. Moreover, Cornford writes in his Plato and Parmenides:\n\nAs a religious philosophy, Pythagoreanism unquestionably attached central importance to the idea of unity, in particular the unity of all life, divine, human, and animal, implied in the scheme of transmigration.[52]\n\nIt is here where we can detect some initial problems with his interpretation of Pythagoreanism as a ‘religious’ philosophy, a problem of an intrinsic ambiguity in the text, one which we will also witness in our consideration of Philolaus. In Divisions of the Soul, Cornford constructs a psychological notion of the ‘religious as such,’ stylized as an irreconcilable conflict between the disparate realms of spirit and flesh. Yet, his recognition of the central importance of an already prevailing ‘unity,’ encompassing the All, seems to be at odds with his notion of division. Cornford also writes in Plato and Parmenides:\n\nThe world itself is a living creature. The element that makes it ‘divine’ will be the principle of beauty and goodness which is manifest in the perfection of its completed order (κoσμoς).[53]\n\nFor, as will be discussed below in a discussion of harmony, there seems to be a contradiction between the attribution of the body as a ‘prison’ or ‘tomb’ of the soul, when, in this philosophy, there is such a vivid affirmation of ‘nature,’ expressed not only in a contemplative interest in its workings, but also in the importance of considerations of the body with respect to health and practical living, these being the necessary conditions of a bios and theoria which aspires and works for a return to the divine.\n\nWalter Burkert provides a description of the Pythagorean movement which, although sharing certain assumptions with respect to the distinction between logical and a-logical modes of thought, not only points to the unity at the basis of the teaching, but also contradicts the division made by Cornford between the 6th and 5th century Pythagoreans:\n\nEcstatic experiences of a Bacchic, Shamanistic, or Yoga type may stand in the background. Furthermore, what appears in the fifth century is not a complete and consistent doctrine of metempsychosis, but rather experimental speculations with contradictory principles of ritual and morality, and a groping for natural laws: the soul comes from the gods and after repeated trials returns to them, or else it runs forever in a circle through all spheres of the cosmos; sheer chance decides on the reincarnation, or else a judgment of the dead; it is morally blameless conduct that guarantees the better lot or else the bare fact of ritual initiation that frees from guilt. The idea finally that the soul is some light, heavenly substance and that man’s soul will therefore eventually ascend to heaven set the stage for a momentous synthesis of cosmology and salvation religion. Since these contradictory motifs are assimilated at a pre-philosophical level; at the level of free mythoi and not as dogmas, the contradiction with the existing traditions were not found disquieting.[54]\n\nIn this interpretation, the doctrine of transmigration exists at an experimental stage, but yet, in the lifeworld of Paganism, the diversity of perspective upon the narrative and its meaning was analogous to the treatment of other narratives, such as Homer, Hesiod, and Orpheus. The exclusivity or hierarchy of truth which emerges with Christianity has as its condition the nexus of beliefs which achieved completion with the philosophy of Plato.[55]\n\nWhat is problematic is Burkert’s reference to a ‘momentous synthesis of cosmology and salvation religion’ in the Pythagorean teaching. This interpretation begins with the prior separation of these terms, consistent with the modern severance of science and religion. This throws doubt upon Burkert’s picture and upon his reliance upon Philolaus who also severed form from matter, limit and the unlimited. There is instead the necessity to trace the common rooting of the various aspects of Pythagoreanism to its lifeworld, which though temporal, was a community, and in this sense, a unity. The notion of a ‘pre-philosophical’ existential unity, in the sense of an extended kinship amidst harmony, must guide us in our navigation of the myriad sources of interpretation. For it seems that this is the most unproblematic attribute of the Pythagorean philosophy. In the notions of kinship and friendship, there is little to be detected of the agonistic divisions which are sought by Cornford. Any attentive interpretation must be sensitive to this holistic sense of community which grounds and understands distinctions as aspects of the All.\n\nW.K.C Guthrie\n\nW.K.C. Guthrie, in his A History of Greek Philosophy, also mentions this ‘religious-philosophical synthesis,’ but contrary to other modern interpreters, he seeks to display a ‘unifying’ core, not dependent upon the methodology which radically segregates these realms of ‘religion’ and ‘science.’ He undertakes what he calls a cautious inquiry of the sources for early Pythagoreans, concluding from his investigation:\n\nThe religious doctrines of immortality and transmigration are assigned to Pythagoras on incontrovertible evidence.[56]\n\nAnd he writes:\n\nWe have seen that Pythagoras himself taught transmigration, and may also be safely credited with the complex of ideas with which transmigration is bound up: the doctrine that the human soul is immortal, that it owes its immortality to its essential kinship with the divine, universal soul, and that it may hope to return to its divine source when purified.[57]\n\nGuthrie agrees with both Cornford and Dacier that Pythagoras is not the author of the doctrine of transmigration. With the former, he traces the origination of this doctrine, or at least its source for Pythagoras, to a ‘non-civilized’ culture. He holds that there is no evidence that the source for the belief is Ancient Egypt and thus disagrees with both Dacier and Herodotus.[58] Guthrie does, however, agree with Cornford’s thesis that transmigration implies a scenario of the purification of the soul from the body, despite his consistent emphasis upon the body and upon magic. But, his interpretation with its emphasis on the notion of an ‘extended kinship,’ is quite different to the extent that he does not make the claim that the doctrine of transmigration must be ‘cut off at the root.’ He seeks to learn from these, who are labeled as being ‘non-civilized’ since they remember and cultivate the beliefs and practices of sympathetic magic in its relation to the doctrine of transmigration. Guthrie distills his perspective:\n\nThe general belief in the possibility of transference, which underlies all the taboos of sympathetic magic, rests in turn on an extended notion of kinship or relationship which is foreign to civilized thought. It appears again in the beliefs associated with a totemic organization of society where the tribe is conscious of a kinship, even an identity between itself and a non-human species of animal.[59]\n\nHe continues:\n\n… the kinship of nature provides the general world view within which alone the transmigration of souls is a tenable belief. Only the fact that the souls of men and of animals are of the same family could make it possible for the same soul to enter now a man’s body and now that of a beast or a bird.[60]\n\nA universal notion of kinship thus underlies the possibility of transference, which in turn underlies sympathetic magic. Moreover, this selfsame kinship underlies the doctrine of transmigration. Is Guthrie seeking to make a connection betwixt sympathetic magic and the doctrine of transmigration? We find that this is indeed the case. Guthrie writes concerning the Pythagorean teaching:\n\nThe essentially magical conception of universal kinship or sympathy, in a more or less refined and rationalized form, permeates its central doctrines of the nature of the universe and the relationship of its parts. To be aware of this will assist an understanding of its mathematical conception of the natural world, as well as of its religious beliefs concerning the fate of the human soul.[61]\n\nGuthrie would therefore disagree with the strict separation between the religious and the scientific asserted by Cornford.[62] Guthrie instead offers an interpretation which, while nominally recognizing different arenas of inquiry, instead seeks to disclose the kinship of these pursuits, as these latter are contained within the horizon of a magical conception of the universe. In this way, far from being an expedient fiction or a well-intentioned lie, the doctrine of transmigration acquires essential significance for the teaching as a whole. Guthrie writes:\n\nThe Greek ideal of philosophia and theoria was at a fairly early date annexed by the Pythagoreans for their master and linked with the doctrine of transmigration.[63]\n\nAnd, echoing his earlier cautious approach to Pythagorean sources, especially those pertaining to the doctrine of transmigration, he writes:\n\nThe importance of even these scanty items of information becomes evident when we remember that for Plato the problem of the possibility of knowledge was central, and that he solved it by the supposition that since the world of experience is strictly unknowable, such awareness of truth as we acquire in this life must consist of the recollection of what we discovered before birth, i.e., it depends on the doctrine of reincarnation.[64]\n\nThe acquisition of knowledge as such is grounded in the doctrine of transmigration. This interpretation stands in direct conflict with that of Cornford. For the latter, there are distinct principles which underlie the contradictory domains of mysticism, or religion in his interpretation, and science.\n\nFor Guthrie, on the contrary, it is magic, expressed in the doctrine of transmigration, which underlies each of these regions of knowledge. This suggests, therefore, a distinction not between mysticism and science, but one between mysticism and magic.\n\nThere is, of course, some similarity between these in that both seek to effectuate an explicit return to the divine; which divine we do not know. Yet, what distinguishes these is their respective comportments amidst the phenomenal world, a world which Parmenides allegedly rejects as inherently false. The doctrine of mysticism shares with Parmenides a suspension of belief with regard to the visible world, while magic, as suggested by Guthrie, unites in its perspective the domains of the visible and the unseen on the way to a harmonious self. In other words, there is thus a thread which links the ‘shades of opinion’ with the ‘light of truth,’ a link which is conceived as a pathway from the former to the latter.\n\nIn this way, we can ascertain from this interpretation the vital importance of the doctrine of transmigration, together with the conceptions of sympathetic magic and the kinship of nature upon which it rests. To be sure, Guthrie is not seeking to identify the Pythagorean bios with the totemic and tribal collocations of human existence. He writes that the magical conception of the universe has undergone an ‘Apollonization’ through its association with the Greek philosophic ideal and with the worship of Apollo. Yet, the magical essence remains intact as indicated through the prominence of the idea of kinship and doctrine of transmigration.\n\nBut, not only is Guthrie’s position distinct from interpreters such as Dacier and Cornford, but is also distinct from those which interpret the doctrine of transmigration as literal truth. In this camp I include, perhaps unjustly, those writers, such as Iamblichus and Proclus who, as true believers, do not attempt to ‘investigate’ the significance of the doctrine for accounting for the philosophic a priori and as being a shelter for the philosophy in its various regions. Instead, and this indicates the tutelage of to a tradition of writing, these writers ‘couch’ their articulation in the anecdotes of the successive incarnations of Pythagoras without any further elaboration. In this way, these accounts, if we get caught up in Cornford’s scenario, are merely the other side of the coin’ of those which set forth transmigration as a fiction. In either case, the doctrine of transmigration, whether fiction or fundamentalist truth, is a lie; it is ‘religious’ and is thus differentiated from the so-called ‘scientific’ Pythagoreanism. In the wake of the antithesis between these oppositional camps, the interpretation that the doctrine of transmigration accounts for the possibility of knowledge as such is left unexamined. Contrary to Cornford, and in distinction from the religious interpretation of the doctrine of transmigration (as literal truth or as a fiction for the regulation of behavior), the doctrine of transmigration can be conceived as a complex symbola, a founding myth for the Pythagorean teaching, which incorporates theoria and bios in a mythopoetic community.\n\nChapter Two: Beyond Mysticism and Science: Symbolism and Philosophical Magic\n\nGuthrie provides us, in a way that is disallowed by the scientistic interpretations of Pythagoras, with a clue to an interpretation of the doctrine of transmigration which seeks to understand the Pythagorean teaching from out of its own ‘historicity.’ For it cannot be overemphasized that even the so-called ‘materialist’ philosophers of this era referred to what would be deemed in modern analysis as ‘religious’, mythical, or as the sacred. And, it is clear from the evidence of this period that there was a consensual, albeit discordant, array of ‘religious’ and spiritual affiliations which encompassed not only the various cult societies and poets, such as Sappho, but also the polis and its political occupants. In this way, if we are to attempt to grasp the doctrine of transmigration outside of this modern antithesis, we must seek to understand how the Pythagorean teaching presented a unified account of body, world, soul, and the divine.\n\nIn this context, the notion of magic will allow us to grasp a symbolic interpretation of the Pythagorean teaching as a philosophy of an unbroken harmony, one that maintains a continuity with so-called ‘primitive’ cultures, and with Homer, with regards to the terrestrial horizon and the specificity of the event of life. As the Golden Verses begin, one must honor the self, for in and amidst the self, from this perspective, a world coalesces, pointing toward the divine. Magic, as a sacred praxis, enters into this realm of the self; it is the self in its harmony and in its thoughtful action or praxis. This actual circumstance of the self, its environment, is its condition, and through the action of the self, the world becomes a symbol of aspiration for and distance from/to harmony. Frankfort writes in his important, though virtually forgotten, work Before Philosophy,\n\nWe understand phenomena, not by what makes them peculiar, but by what makes them manifestations of general laws. But, a general law cannot do justice to the individual character of each event. And, the individual character of the event is precisely what early man experiences most strongly.[65]\n\nWe, who live in the ‘age of science’ usually understand phenomena through recourse to the conceptual logic of schematic explanation. Yet, in the present inquiry, we will have to embrace the unusual, for the usual will not suffice. The attempted application of a conceptual totalization to the event will not transcend the horizon into the ‘essence’ since what is occurring is singular, and cannot be conceptualized. The ‘event’ cannot be totalized into a conceptual-logical system since being, existence, as Kant and Heidegger have pointed out, is not a real predicate. The event may be expressed, but only as indigenous self-expression. As Gödel once warned, a completed system is impossible. We must begin to fathom a different way or ethos of knowing in order to do ‘justice’ to the event.\n\nThe ‘system’, whether it is calculus or technical philosophy, no matter how much it claims to achieve its own systematic perfection, will always remain only at the surface of the event. It always waits for the flight of Minerva at dusk. It cannot transgress the horizon of limit, it cannot be this event – it will not attuned with the event. Deaf to this music, its very investigation impossible in principle, and thus it acts through violence, it displaces, replaces, contains this event. In this way, the fabric of reality is portrayed as ruptured in the artifices of the pure scientist, a portrait of rupture that is also shared by the mystic, who after all is the other in this hegemonic artifice. Through the violence of this rupture, the event is erased into the oblivion of forgetfulness.\n\nAn indication of the alternative approach which seeks to trace the memory of a harmony of All, as symbolized in the doctrine of transmigration, comes from Eliphas Levi, who writes in his History of Magic:\n\nMagic combines in a single science that which is most certain in philosophy with that which is eternal and infallible in religion. It reconciles perfectly and incontestably those two terms so opposed on the first view – faith and reason, science and belief, authority and liberty. It furnishes the human mind with an instrument of philosophical and religious certainty, as exact as mathematics, and even accounting for the infallibility of mathematics themselves.[66]\n\nIt is important that this reference to a philosophical magic will lead to reflection upon the precise roles of theoria and bios in the dissemination of the Pythagorean teaching. These latter terms, however, are only distinguished after the event, and refer to differing aspects of the project of attunement, as a remembrance of the All, as configurations and workings of these memories in practical life, as knowledge, and as an act which opens a sacred space with a desired destination.\n\nFor this is philosophy with a goal and a thoughtful praxis designed to obtain this goal. The Apollonian focus upon a future that is prophesied and attained via praxis is a sublimation of the random field of chance, an ethos for a bios which attunes amidst harmony. Guthrie writes in his The Greek Philosophers,[67]\n\nMagic is a primitive form of applied science. Whether or not spirits or gods are thought to enter at some stage into the process, their actions are compelled by the man in possession of the proper magical technique no less than if they were inanimate objects. The sorcerer sets in train a certain sequence of events, and cause and effect then follow with the same certainty as if on took good aim with a rifle and pulled the trigger.[68]\n\nIf we substitute the metaphor of the bow and arrow for that of the rifle, then we can ascertain that magic is a bios of a terrestrial life which aspires to a harmony of All. Such an eschatology of the soul is intimated by the god Apollo, the inventor of archery, shooting from afar. With the arrow, we have the pathway to transmigrate towards the perspective of the sky. We will see that this magical interpretation of the early Pythagoreans may cast into relief the raison d’etre of the bios, the importance of numbers, geometry, and music, not to mention the visible analogue of the divine in the sky, as Heidegger muses, or, and most intimately, the analogue which is this body, as the place of this aspiration is the whole self.[69] In this way, I will focus on the unifying and grounding character of magic with respect to the doctrine of transmigration. This notion of sympathetic magic will be considered as a Apollonized terrestrial, symbolical bios, as opposed to ritual or ceremonial magic, and also distinct from that magic which is prayer, celestial magic. It is a ‘constructivist’ magic, which, on its way to its return to the divine source, builds a world in which such a harmony is intimated as possible.\n\n‘Primitivism’, Magic and the Philosophical A priori\n\nIn order to answer the question of the status of the doctrine of transmigration, we must examine its function of accounting for the a priori as such and of articulating a magical conception of the universe. As will become clear, the function of the a priori, expressed in the doctrine of transmigration, must be grasped within the context of a philosophical notion of magical kinship. It would be inaccurate to conceive this sublimation as a transition from magic to philosophy in that the Pythagoreans maintained a ‘magic core.’ At the heart of their articulation of the ‘Greek ideal’ of philosophia, lay their commitment to remembrance and magical praxis. Neither, in this way, is the transmigration of souls to be considered a primitive or infantile doctrine, or, in its use, as one that could be distinguished from some alleged ‘primitive’ cultural narrative, as Bertholet (1909) has made his premise.[70]\n\nGuthrie, as quoted above, writes that the ‘possibility of transference, which underlies all the taboos of sympathetic magic, rests in turn on an extended notion of kinship…’[71] As we can gather from Guthrie’s text, the ‘primitive’ notion of sympathetic magic is the activity of effectuating some intention within a field of resemblance. Soustelle in his seminal work, The Four Suns, describes an Otomi and Mazahua magical practise focused upon an instrument called the Chicauaztli, or, the ‘ringing stick,’ which is ‘both a farming implement and a magical device.’[72] The stick which has tiny bells tied to one end is used in a performance of music and dance, in which the stick is for a long duration struck against the ground, making holes, with the bells ringing. It is observed by Soustelle that the ringing bells resemble the sound of rain. He writes:\n\nIt is easy to understand what the basic gesture here means: striking the floor with the digging stick imitates the sowing of maize, while the little bells are calling to the rain. At all times, the farming peoples of Mexico have relied upon the magic of sound to obtain water from the sky.[73]\n\nThe dance is performed at the commencement of the planting of the crops before the onset of the rainy season. The striking of the stick by the women of the tribe is a symbol of the fertility of the goddess in this mythopoetic narrative of two major deities, a pair of gods, Tsitanhmou, the ‘venerable great Lord,’ of fire and the sun, and Tsinana, the ‘moon mother and earth mother.’ The performance parallels the actual planting of the seeds, in which the woman makes a hole with her ringing stick and places a seed into the hole. The ringing of bells is meant to attract the attention of the rain god, Tlaloc; as like of like, resemblance.\n\nIn this example, we are shown a practical and magical activity which is a temporal symbol amidst a field of resemblance. This is a symbol within a teaching, which like the early Pythagoreans, is disseminated and preserved through an oral tradition of stories, song, dance, and praxis, abiding an ancient lattice of memory, one that has been preserved despite the extermination of 23 of the 24 million indigenous inhabitants by the Spanish.\n\nFrazier, whose work is questionable for other reason,[74] but who had an influence on early twentieth century interpretations of Pythagoras, mentions two such ‘superstitions’ of the Pythagorean teaching, symbola amidst an oral tradition:\n\nIn ancient Greece superstitions of the same sort seemed to have been current, for it was thought that if a horse stepped on the track of a wolf he was seized with numbness; and a maxim ascribed to Pythagoras forbade people to pierce a man’s footprints with a nail or a knife.[75]\n\nAnd he writes:\n\nWe can understand why it was a maxim with the Pythagoreans that in rising from bed you should smooth away the impression left by your body on the bed-clothes. The rule was simply an old precaution against magic, forming part of a whole code of superstitious maxims which antiquity fathered on Pythagoras, though doubtless they were familiar to the barbarous forefathers of the Greeks long before the time of the Philosopher.[76]\n\nThe notion of transference set forth by Guthrie suggests that these maxims, or symbola, are more significant than the derogative label ‘superstition’ allows them. As with the rites of spring performed by the indigenous tribes of Mexico, it may be suggested that these symbola have a practical and magical, or, at least an expressive[77], significance in the life of the Pythagorean community, a subject which will be considered in greater depth in Chapter 7, section two, ‘The Path of Remembrance, or Return.’\n\nYet, while these references suggest a continuity between the ‘indigenous’ notion of kinship and sympathetic magic and that of the Pythagoreans, we can also detect significant differences which arise from the transformation of the former to the latter. And, in this way, we are distinguishing the former notion and practise of sympathetic magic from the philosophical magic of the Pythagoreans. Through this distinction, we can specify the meaning of this magic, one which would become the basis for all subsequent knowledge.\n\nThe basic notions bound up with the indigenous practises of magic, if we can schematize them so formally, would be firstly, that all is kindred; secondly, that within this web of kinship, resemblance implies connection; and thirdly, that there is action at a distance between similars. However, for the doctrine of transmigration to contain not only this magical conception of the cosmos, but also to provide an account of the philosophical a priori, what must be disclosed is a repetition which moves beyond this immanent novelty of kinship and resemblance, a character that is beyond the immediate interplay amidst the physis of terrestrial life. A repetition would serve to ground a prophetic orientation.\n\nThe characteristics of the transformation effected by the Pythagoreans can be discerned through a consideration of their primary philosophical doctrines. Guthrie writes:\n\nWhat he said to his disciples no man can tell for certain, since they preserved such an exceptional silence. However, the following facts in particular became universally known: first, that he held the soul to be immortal, next that it migrates into other kinds of animals, further that past events repeat themselves in a cyclic process and nothing is new in an absolute sense, and finally that one must regard all living things as kindred. These are the beliefs which Pythagoras is said to have been the first to introduce into Greece.[7"
