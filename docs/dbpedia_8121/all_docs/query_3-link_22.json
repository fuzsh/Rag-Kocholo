        "text": "Philosopher, Mathematician, Physicist, Astronomer, Physician, Scientist, Musician, Avatar (c570 BC – c495 BC)\n\nPythagoras is one of the greatest philosophical minds of humanity, an immortal spiritual guide who, together with Socrates and Plato, is recognized worldwide as the eternal Teacher of mankind. His influence on human thought is unique because of his remarkable wisdom in the purest sense, his profound knowledge, which he had compiled from all knowledge that existed in the world at the time during his travels and the introduction of a new philosophical system called Pythagoreanism which achieved the spiritual perfection of the human soul through the method of memorization, discipline, examination, catharsis, salvation, lytrosis and theosis for more than 2500 years and of which today’s youth is in need more than ever before.\n\nPythagoras was born in Samos and from a young age he dedicated himself to knowledge by studying next to famous philosophers such as Thales of Miletus, Bias and Anaximander. He travelled to Phoenicia, where he learned Phoenician, to Egypt, where he was initiated into the religious societies, to Arabia, where he learned how to communicate with animals, to Babylon, where he studied astrology. In Tibet Pythagoras met and spoke with the Dalai Lama, in China he studied the philosophical teachings of the Buddha and met with his contemporary, Confucius while in India he studied the ancient teachings of the Brahmans. Pythagoras would eventually return and travel throughout Greece continuing his spiritual journey and founding his philosophical school.\n\nPythagoras’ teachings were strictly held under secrecy by oath and were taught only to those initiated into his school. His philosophy was influenced by Orphism. The Pythagorean School had many divisions, including 4 in Southern Italy. It became flooded with Greek philosophers and became known as Great Greece. It was the first university in the world. It consisted of 4 schools: Theological, Medical, Mathematics and Science school and school of Political sciences. In Science school geometry, theory of numbers, astronomy, engineering and music were taught. Pythagoras allowed women to study in his school, something that the modern world considered inconceivable until recently.\n\nPythagoras’ monumental work reveals well-documented studies which cover nearly every scientific field to date: philosophy, geometry, stereometry, mathematics, astronomy, cosmogony, physics, politics, ethics, physiology, astrophysics, geography, theology and pyramidology. Among many of Pythagoras’ abilities were telepathy, levitation, the ability to interpret dreams, the ability to read closed letters, the ability to communicate with animals and with the dead and the ability to predict the future. For years scientists of all specialties have struggled to decipher Pythagoras’ works. Few have managed to do so.\n\nHe was one of the most important innovators of Greek meditation (Dialogismos), with which Pythagoreanism is strongly affiliated. His works, particularly the “Golden Epics” are a guide to the Greek meditation. According to Pythagoreanism, two principles are prerequisites. The first is memory (Mnemosene) where the initiates practised their memory using a series of simple steps. They memorised verses and excerpts from works, which acted beneficially to their subconscious mind. The Pythagoreans used epodes as well as excerpts from Homer and Hesiod to cure diseases and as therapy for the soul. After completing this task, the initiate proceeded το the second principle, always according to Pythagoras, which is the self-examination (exetasis) based on the memorization of one’s actions. Its purpose was the cleansing of the soul. According to Plato, self examination is the greatest way for cleansing of the soul (catharsis). However, catharsis will not bestow its seeds to the initiate without justice. This is Pythagoras’ meaning of “Know thyself” (γνῶθι σ’αὐτόν). For Pythagoras, catharsis is a prerequisite for Greek meditation (dialogismos) which can only be achieved by meticulous inner examination of one’s self by means of the Pythagorean method. The ultimate purpose of his is widening the human intellect and bringing the mortal man directly in contact with the Divine.\n\nPythagoras’ discovery of the Universal Law broadened the horizons of Greek Meditation. He discovered that numbers bridge the aesthetic field with the noetic (nous = mind) field. Numbers are not God but an expression of the Divine. This means that Pythagoras managed through deep meditation to find the link between the two levels of this world, which function in reversely proportional manner. Pythagoras resonated with the noetic field and was given the information which he handed down to the aesthetic field, our mortal world. Pythagoras’ monochord allowed the meditator to participate in both fields; through the number of the pulses, the meditator participated in the aesthetic field by observing the pulses with his vision. The pulses produced sound which the meditator could subconsciously listen to and participate in the noetic field. In this way the body in the aesthetic field and the soul in the noetic field co-operate and resonate with each other. The purpose of this is Virtue.\n\nAs a scientist, Pythagoras was an innovative mathematician way ahead of his time. Pythagorean Arithmosophy, the philosophy based on the fact that numbers are the essence of the world, is Pythagoras’ creation. This is what Pythagoras meant by “Ὁ Θεὸς ἀεὶ γεωμετρεῖ” (God always geometrisizes). He wrote treaties on the methods of construction of geometrical shapes, provided solution for the Fermat Theorem, proved the Pythagorean Theorem and made significant contributions in pyramidology by deciphering the hidden messages of the Egyptian pyramids, the ziggurats and the Sphinx of Egypt. He proved the correlation between music and the letters of the Greek alphabet and founded the Pythagorean Symbolic Logic.\n\nPythagorean physics and metaphysics were also equally important and were marked with many significant contributions. His teachings included parallel worlds with higher beings, black holes, theory of relativity, lost energy, uranous mechanics and quantum mechanics. He taught reincarnation, metempsychosis, karma, life and death, centers of consciousness (chakras) and the immortality of the soul. Moreover he wrote about the spiritual world: What is soul, how are they created, where do they come from and where do they go after they leave this world. Pythagorean cosmology was involved with: the creation of the world, synthesis and aposynthesis of the universe, cosmic levels, cosmic laws and cosmic memory. He taught politics, ethics, virtues, about man and his relationship with God and lexarithmic theory.\n\nPythagoras’ most invaluable thing from his teachings was the Universal Harmony of the spheres, the Tetractys and the Laws of Creation of the Universe. The Universal Harmony of the Spheres is based on the observation that every moving object produces sound. This phenomenon is observed during the movement of stars and planets. Astric Pythagorean Theology studied the musical relations of the planets based on this metaphysical side of music while Pythagorean Astronomy introduced the Laws of the distance of the orbit of planets. The Pythagoreans used the Tetractys as their most sacred symbol and was believed to be the key to the universe and an instrument for the measurement of its size and its diastole. It is a cosmic model for the creation of planets; the cosmic D.N.A. Scientists today believe that if they found the complete Corpus Pythagorium and deciphered the Universal Harmony of the Spheres and the Tetractys, then all the laws of the universe and the theories for all the astrophysical and theosophical problems will be unraveled before us.\n\nPythagoras’ contribution in mankind renders him an immortal teacher and healer of humanity. He perfected the Greek Meditation and surpassed its limits, reaching a state known as “Myesis” (Μύησις) in which he came into contact with the divine and discovered the Universal Law. This achievement has been accomplished only by a minimal number of men in history. According to tradition Pythagoras pre existed in the sky before coming down to Earth as a human. Shortly after his death, Pythagoras was deified and numerous statues of him were erected in Greece and Rome in his honour. The greatest philosophers who ever walked the Earth such as Socrates and Plato were Pythagoreans and continued Pythagoras’ work to make man healthy both in mortal and immortal level and to harmonize his soul with the laws of Nature.\n\nBibliography"
