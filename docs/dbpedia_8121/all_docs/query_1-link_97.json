This esoteric reasoning is depicted in Rosicrucian Chemical Wedding and its symbolic imagery, in Emmanuel Swedenborg 's conception of matter, comprised of the divine essence, or Franz Mesmer 's animal magnetism. This link between observable phenomena and esoteric sensibility was crucial for speculative natural\n\nIs Anaximander's Argument Of The Apeiron?\n\n878 Words | 4 Pages\n\nAnaximander's beliefs deeply oppose those of his predecessor, Thales.

Within his first principle he states, “Nothing can ever be created by divine power out of nothing”. He suggests that all matter exists in the form of atoms, and although these atoms are not visible to the naked eye, they are still present.

As a result, Lucretius’ writings were likely not well received by the audience.\n\nEssay On Anselm's Argument\n\n1628 Words | 7 Pages\n\nDoes the Ontological Argument successfully show that God exists?

Therefore, he concluded that a great telos of humans is the ability to reason. He bases his definition of reason on the conclusion that humans are more superior to all other species.
