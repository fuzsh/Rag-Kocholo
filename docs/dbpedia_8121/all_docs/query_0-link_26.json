        "text": "Anaximander, the infamous Pre-Socratic Greek Philosopher that who lived in Miletus, city of Ionia. Popular of his title being father of Cosmology, founder of astronomy and known for building the first mechanical model of the world. But that’s not just it, he contributed mostly in Philosophy to where he believed that Apeiron (everything that is infinite is formless) is his Arche, this allowed for the concept that celestial bodies could pass under and around it (Earth). He was a student of Thales, the idea of having an arche came from him to where Anaximander created his own unique arche (Apeiron) suggesting ideas that support this theory not until time passed by, Anaximander became the teacher of two legendary philosophers Anaximenes and Pythagoras. He was an early proponent of science and was considered to be the first true scientist because of his many conducted earliest recorded scientific experiments.\n\nLife\n\nAnaximander was born in the Greek city of Miletus (on the Ionian coast of modern-day Turkey) in about 610 B.C., the son of Praxiades, but little else is known of his life. According to Diogenes Laërtius (a biographer of the Greek philosophers, who lived in the 2nd or 3rd Century A.D.), he was a pupil of Thales (founder of the Milesian School of philosophy, and possibly also Anaximander’s uncle), and succeeded him as master of the school, where his work influenced Anaximenes and Pythagoras.\n\nWork\n\nAlthough he was among the earliest philosophers in the Western world to have actually written down his studies, only one fragment of his work remains and, by the time of Plato, his philosophy was apparently almost forgotten.\n\nAt a time when the Pre-Socratics were pursuing various forms of Monism and searching for the one element that constitutes all things (each had a different solution to the identity of this element: water for Thales, air for Anaximenes, fire for Heraclitus), Anaximander argued that neither water nor any of the other candidates can embrace all of the opposites found in nature (e.g. water can only be wet, never dry) and therefore cannot be the one primary substance or first principle of the universe.\n\nHe judged that, although not directly perceptible to us, the only substance which could explain all the opposites he saw around him, is what he called “apeiron” (variously translated as “the infinite”, “the boundless”, etc), an endless, unlimited primordial mass, subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived. The Universe originates in the separation of opposites in this primordial matter, and dying things are merely returning to the boundless element from which they came. He saw the universe as a kind of organism, supported by “pneuma” (cosmic breath).\n\nAnaximander is sometimes called the “Father of Cosmology” and the founder of astronomy for his bold use of non-mythological explanations of physical processes. He was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world, in which the Earth floats very still in the center of the infinite, not supported by anything. He envisioned the Earth as a cylinder with a height one-third of its diameter, the flat top forming the inhabited world, surrounded by a circular oceanic mass. This theory allowed for the concept that celestial bodies could pass under or around it, and provided a better explanation than Thales’ claim of a world floating on water (what would contain this ocean?).\n\nAnaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass (and therefore to realize how far from Earth it might be), and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. He built a celestial sphere, and his work on astronomy shows that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. Anaximander also speculated on the plurality of worlds, which places him close to the Atomists and the Epicureans who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared.\n\nSome consider Anaximander the earliest proponent of evolution (even though he had no theory of natural selection). Noting the existence of fossils, he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago, and he put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth’s climate, until they had time to adapt to the emergence of dry land.\n\nHis other interests were in mathematics (he explained some basic notions of geometry and introduced the sundial gnomon to Greece), meteorology (he attributed some phenomena, such as thunder and lightning, to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes, and he explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun) and geography (he was probably the first to publish a map of the world, i.e. the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks, rather than the local maps which had been produced in ancient times).\n\nAnaximander’s Creations\n\nVery little is known about Anaximander’s life. Additionally, it is hard to ascertain if details about the philosopher’s life are true in the first place. In Diogenes’ work, Anaximander might have been the inventor of the gnomon, “the raised piece of a sundial whose shadow indicates the sun’s position”, as well as several other useful gadgets,\n\nThe gnomon is the triangular blade in this sundial.\n\n“He also was the first discoverer of the gnomon; and he placed some in Lacedaemon on the sun-dials there, as Favorinus says in his Universal History, and they showed the solstices and the equinoxes; he also made clocks. He was the first person, too, who drew a map of the earth and sea, and he also made a globe;”\n\nPossibly what the lost first map of the world by Anaximander looked like.\n\nAnother trivia mentioned by Diogenes is that when Anaximander sang, the children would laugh. Thus, when the philosopher heard about it, he is reputed to have said,\n\n“We must then sing better for the sake of the children.”\n\nAnaximander’s Philosophical Views\n\nFortunately, we have a better idea of the Anaximander’s philosophical views. Like Thales, Anaximander practiced material monism (a belief in which the physical world is explained by the idea that all objects in the world are composed of a single element), and was interested in seeking the archê (‘origin’ or principle’) of all things.\n\nAccording to Thales, this is water. Anaximander, however, disagreed with his teacher. One of the arguments against water, or any of the other elements as the archê is that none of the elements can include all the opposites found in nature. For example, water can only be wet, and never dry.\n\nDetail of Raphael’s painting The School of Athens, 1510–1511. This could be a representation of Anaximander leaning towards Pythagoras on his left.\n\nDetail of Raphael’s painting The School of Athens, 1510–1511. This could be a representation of Anaximander leaning towards Pythagoras on his left.\n\nTherefore, Anaximander proposed that the archê is a substance known as apeiron, which may be translated either as “limitless, boundless, indefinite”, or “unable to be got through, what cannot be traversed from end to end”. It is unclear exactly as to which of these two meanings of the apeiron Anaximander sought to convey. Thus, whilst some have argued that the apeiron is a substance that is inexhaustible and undefined, other favors the idea that the apeiron refers to a spatial or temporal quality.\n\nReconsidering History: Ancient Greeks Discovered America Thousands of Years Ago\n\nIncredible Construction: Greek Acropolis Built by Ancient Engineers to Resist Earthquakes\n\nArmillary Spheres: Following Celestial Objects in the Ancient World\n\nAnother difference between Thales’ and Anaximander’s philosophical views can be seen in the way the perceived the cosmos. Thales suggested that the earth rests on water. Anaximander, however, disagrees. One of the reasons being that if the earth rests on water, what does the water rest on? If one thing needs to be supported by another, then there will be no end to it. Instead, Anaximander proposed that the earth is a cylinder with a flat surface. Around this cylinder are rings of fire surrounded by mist. As a result of the mist, the fire is invisible. There are, however, holes in these rings, allowing the fire to shine through.\n\nIllustration of Anaximander’s models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter.\n\nThis, according to Anaximander, allows us to see the stars, the Moon, and the Sun. More remarkable, perhaps, is the statement that the earth stays in equilibrium at the Centre of the cosmos. The reason for this being that there is no sufficient reason for it to be moving in one direction rather than the other. This view and reasoning are said to have been accepted by most of Anaximander’s successors until the birth of modern astronomy under Copernicus in the 16th century AD.\n\nYour Blogger,"
