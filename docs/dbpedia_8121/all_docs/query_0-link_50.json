        "text": "Hint: First of all, we are going to look at the history of Pythagoras that who Pythagoras was and what were its works in Mathematics and then after that, we will see how he contributed to the nation and the love he had for mathematics, we will also look at the details of the teacher of Pythagoras and then point out the correct option.\n\nComplete step-by-step solution\n\nThe birthplace of Pythagoras was the island of Samos around 569 BC. He died in Metaponto around 475 BC. He was a Greek mathematician who revolutionized areas such as geometry, architecture, and Philosophy as well. In ancient times also, Pythagoras was well known for his mathematical achievement of the Pythagorean Theorem. The most known discovery that Pythagoras had been credited, which was that in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nAmong his teachers, there were three philosophers who had influenced Pythagoras while he was a young man. They were Pherekydes, Thales, and his pupil Anaximander.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the only option that matches this Thales, and hence, option (a) is correct.\n\nNote: From this question we should try to learn how he has devoted his life to mathematics and it was also fun for him in solving mathematics questions, with using his knowledge he has made a huge impact in the lives of many people."
