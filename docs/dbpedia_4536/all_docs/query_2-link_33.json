        "text": "ISBN: 9780394585123\n\nNew York, NY, USA: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993. First Edition. Hardcover. Will Rogers (1879–1935) was a genuine American icon. From 1920 to his tragic death in a plane crash in 1935 Rogers was the most famous man in the United States. Radio entertainer, lecturer, movie star, and columnist (whose columns were read by 40 million people daily), Rogers was a searing star in the nascent media landscapes of the early 20th century. Born in Oklahoma, Rogers was born into wealth and extravagance. At an early age he ran away from school to explore and work the broiling Texas plains as a cowboy, journeyed to Argentina, and finding himself in South Africa, where he became a trick rider. Some time later he came back to America and immersed himself in vaudeville where he became a star. In his later years he launched himself into politics, film, and generally the cultural miasma of the 20’s & 30’s, until his tragic death in 35’. Ben Yagoda (b. 1954) offers here the authoritative biography on Rogers. American writer and educator, Yagoda is the first biographer with complete access to Roger’s letters and unpublished writings enables us at last to understand the man, and his connection to the American people against the backdrop of the post-civil war era and into the Great Depression. Yagoda does a masterful job of stripping bare the life of an American cultural monolith and giveing readers the most intimate view of it that has ever been presented. Dripping with pathos, clear, concise, and vividly told, Will Rogers is an amazing biography that demands to be read, then re-read.
