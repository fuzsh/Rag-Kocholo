        "text": "You may know Texas Tech University from the success of their talented cheerleaders and dancers. But did you know that this university has some of the most unique traditions that can’t be seen anywhere else? From a one-of-a-kind kickoff tradition to a live animal representing the Spirit Program as one of the mascots, Texas Tech is filled with history that you probably never knew about!\n\nHere’s 10 facts that you need to know about the Red Raiders.\n\n1. The Campus Is Humongous\n\nTTU’s campus is both beautiful and large! Covering 1,839 acres of land, it is one of the largest land mass campuses in the United States.\n\n2. There’s A Tortilla Toss\n\nAt every home football game, Red Raider fans don’t just spend kickoff cheering on their team . . . they also throw tortillas onto the field! Yes, tortillas fly everywhere in Jones AT&T Stadium!\n\nThis unofficial tradition, known as the Tortilla Toss, began in the 1990s after a sports broadcaster made a comment that the only thing in Lubbock was a tortilla factory and Texas Tech football. Today, students throw flour tortillas on the opening kickoff at each game.\n\n3. 2017 Was A Year Of Victories!\n\nThe Tech Spirit Program proudly left NCA & NDA College Nationals with not one but two national championship titles! The coed cheer and pom teams both reached this high honor of a first win together!\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span id=”selection-marker-1″ class=”redactor-selection-marker” data-verified=”redactor”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;​&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span id=”selection-marker-1″ class=”redactor-selection-marker” data-verified=”redactor”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;​&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n4. Fearless Champion Leads The Football Team Onto The Field\n\nIn 1936, as a student dare, a Texas Tech student named George Tate began a tradition first known as “ghost riders” which would later become the university’s official mascot in 1954, the Masked Rider. Joe Kirk Fulton is named as first in the long series of horse-riding emblems.\n\nEach year, Tech students try out for the Masked Rider position. The student is selected by the University’s Masked Rider Advisory Committee. They serve the university for one year, making over 300 public appearances on behalf of Tech.\n\nFearless Champion is the university’s 14th horse to serve as the school’s mascot.\n\n5. Victory Bells Ringing Through West Texas Air\n\nHoused in the east tower of the administration building, the two bells are rung after every Texas Tech athletic victory, and at graduations for 30 minutes. They are rung by two spirit student organizations: Saddle Tramps, the male spirit student organization supporting male athletics teams, and High Riders, the female spirit student organization supporting female athletic teams.\n\n6. They’ve Got An Awesome Original Nickname: The Matadors\n\nIn 1925, the first football coach’s wife suggested the name because of the culture and architecture theme of campus. In 1936, the students voted to change to “Red Raiders” after an article in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal referred to the football team’s recent game.\n\n7. TTU Has An All Girl STUNT Team\n\nIn 2017, Texas Tech had their first ever all girl stunt team. They were so successful that they qualified for nationals and had a third-place finish!\n\n8. The Spirit Program Has Athletes From 15 States!\n\nWhile Tech is a fan favorite school across the state of Texas, students come from across the country! The 2017-2018 Spirit Program has 84 student leaders from 15 states and two countries.\n\n9. There’s A Statue Called “Will Rogers And Soapsuds”\n\nDedicated in 1950, a horse and rider statue standing 9-foot-11 and weighing 3,200 pounds greets each visitor to campus.\n\nAccording to legend, Will Rogers was faced west so he could ride into the sunset. With this placement, the view as you turn onto campus — the back end of the horse — was not well received. To solve this problem, the statue was rotated 23 degrees so the back end of the horse could face long-time rival Texas A&M.\n\nBefore each home football game, the Saddle Tramps, known as the “Midnight Raiders,” wrap Will Rogers in red crepe paper. To honor and mourn national and campus tragedies, Will Rogers is wrapped in black crepe paper.\n\n10. Spirit Members Receive Student-Leader Spirit Scholarships\n\nEach member making the Texas Tech Spirit Program receives a $1,000 leadership scholarship. This scholarship waives out-of-state tuition fees."
