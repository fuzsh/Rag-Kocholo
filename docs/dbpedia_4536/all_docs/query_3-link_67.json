After years of riding horses and touring the world as a circus performer called The Cherokee Kid, Rogers began presenting his own radio show and wrote several books that became bestsellers.\n\nHis vaudeville rope act even led to success on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nRogers was also known for his phrases, including “I never met a man I didn’t like” and “A man that don’t love a horse, there is something the matter with him.”\n\nThe 37 best actors who have never won an Oscar\n\nShow all 37\n\nThe multitalented star, the son of a Cherokee senator, even had a tenure as politician after mounting a mock campaign for presidency in 1928.\n\nHe did so in an attempt to prove that all campaigning was worthless and on election day, he resigned.\n\nRogers’ legacy lives on through several buildings set up in his name, including the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Oklahoma and the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, California.\n\nHis childhood home, based near Oologah, Oklahoma, is also open to the public.\n\nRogers died in 1935 aviator Wiley Post after a plane crash in northern Alaska.\n\nHis son, Will Rogers Jr, played him in both 1949 film Look for the Silver Lining and The Story of Will Rogers in 1952.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
