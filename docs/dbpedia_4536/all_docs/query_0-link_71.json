        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH — Even the youngest cheerleaders who participated Sunday at the Ocean Center in the Pop Warner conference competition kicked, cart-wheeled and somersaulted as they belted out support for their local teams.\n\n\"Stand up and cheer it, we're going to the top,\" cheered the Flagler Falcons.\n\nThe Falcons are one of 13 associations within the conference that includes Flagler County to the north and all the way south to Palm Bay in Brevard County. They had their own fans to cheer them on as they vaulted into formation.\n\nJescinda Alexander of Palm Coast held signs high as her daughters — Kirsten, 13, and Samantha, 12 — took the floor.\n\n\"It's nice for the girls that they can cheer together,\" Alexander said. \"This is the first year they've cheered. We just moved here in March, and this was a great way for them to be involved, meet people and support Palm Coast. It's not about winning or losing. It's about doing the best you can.\"\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 cheerleaders between the ages of 5 and 15 gave their all Sunday, vying for a spot in regional competition that will be held Thanksgiving weekend at the Silver Sands Arena in Kissimmee.\n\nEach team got two and a half minutes on the mat to make an impression on the judges.\n\n\"The younger ages, the 5- to 8-year-olds perform only,\" said Gidget Zook, the league cheer and dance coordinator. \"The 9- to 15-year-olds are judged, and they are hoping to go onto the regionals and then the nationals at the Disney Wide World of Sports.\"\n\nThe tables were turned for the day as many Pop Warner football coaches and their football players cheered the performance of those who regularly sing out their praise.\n\n\"Gitchi-gitchi-goo. We love you,\" cried about 20 Pee-Wee Port Orange Hawks cheerleaders. \"Let's go Hawks.\"\n\nMarc Campbell, the Port Orange Junior Pee-Wee football coach and vice president of the organization, said it's all about sportsmanship.\n\n\"It's about fun and camaraderie,\" he said. \"It also gives a creative outlet for the girls.\"\n\nTeams took one side of the bleachers; spectators took the other. Once called to the ready position, the girls moved down the bleachers and walked through the underbelly of the building to await their turn to perform.\n\nThe Deltona Panthers team of 35 girls from the fourth, fifth and sixth grades chatted as they lined up backstage. A few nervous tears were shed, but teammates said the performance would be just like practice.\n\n\"The girls work hard all season long,\" said Lakeisha Williams, head coach. \"They are just as much athletes as the football players, and they deserve just as much recognition.\"\n\nTonya Henderson watched as her husband, Todd, shot video of their daughter, Kara Conner, 9.\n\n\"They have been practicing for this six nights a week for two hours a night,\" Tonya Henderson said. \"They are dedicated and caring about their teammates. They have total respect for each other.\"\n\nNew this year to the conference is the Challengers, 11 girls with disabilities who are part of the Ormond Beach Sandcrabs team.\n\n\"We decided in August to do this,\" said Coach Amy Pantages-Ricks. \"We treat the ability, not the disability. We are the only team in the East Coast (Conference) that has a special-needs team.\"\n\nCara Rogers — mother of 7-year-old Mikenna who is autistic — is thankful there is a team for her daughter.\n\n\"This has been a great thing for her,\" she said.\n\nThe team was started after 8-year-old Alyssa Hagstrom, who uses a wheelchair, told Pantages-Ricks she wanted to cheer.\n\n\"I had to tell her we didn't have a team for her,\" Pantages-Ricks said. \"We decided we'd make a team for her.\"\n\nCheering doesn't make Alyssa nervous.\n\n\"It's fun. I like cheering,\" she said."
