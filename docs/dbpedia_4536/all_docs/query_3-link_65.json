        "text": "Will Rogers? Apocryphal?\n\nDear Quote Investigator: The popular American humorist Will Rogers once made a memorable remark about liberty. Unfortunately, the precise phrasing was not memorable enough. Here are several versions:\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as in speech.\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as it does in speech.\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as it does in speeches.\n\nLiberty doesn’t work as well in practice as it does in speeches.\n\nLiberty don’t work near as good in practice as it does in speeches.\n\nWould you please help me to determine whether Will Rogers really delivered one of these lines?\n\nQuote Investigator: In 1927 a collection of pieces by Will Rogers was published under the title “There’s Not a Bathing Suit in Russia & Other Bare Facts”. Rogers composed the following adage. Emphasis added to excerpts by QI:\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as it does in Speech.\n\nBelow are additional selected citations in chronological order.\n\nThe statement from Rogers was prompted by his visit to the Soviet Union, and the previous page included this observation:\n\nIf Socialists worked as much as they talked, they would be the most prosperous style of Government in the World.\n\nThe paragraph before the adage discussed the general incompetence of governments. The phrase “hitting on all six” referred to the six cylinders of a typical car engine. When an engine is not hitting on all six it is malfunctioning. The misspellings were in the original text:\n\nYou know, I dident have to go to Russia to find comedy or chaos in Governments. If I was looking for governments that wasent just exactly hitting on all six, why, I left one and went through a dozen more going to Russia, so anybody better not start heaving too many rocks at Russia’s government—I don’t care which country you come from—till you have looked your own over.\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as it does in Speech.\n\nIn 1949 the adage appeared in the posthumous “Autobiography of Will Rogers” edited by Donald Day. The statement about prosperity was also included although “Socialists” was changed to “Communists”:\n\nIf the Communists worked just as hard as they talked, they’d have the most prosperous style of government in the world.\n\nLiberty, [he warned] don’t work as good in practice as in Speech. You got to figure that bunch of fellows are playing with the biggest toy in the world (and the most dangerous).\n\nIn 1960 “The Greenville News” of South Carolina published an editorial piece titled “Will Rogers, Politics and Russia” that reprinted Rogers’s statement:\n\nLiberty don’t work as good in practice as in speech.\n\nIn 1961 a newspaper in Fayetteville, Arkansas reviewed “The Will Rogers Book” by Paula McSpadden Love and shared some bon mots about government. The saying was slightly altered to use “speeches” instead of “speech”:\n\nThe Government – “The Government has never been accused of being a business man” or “Always remember this, that as bad as we sometimes think our government is run, it’s the best run I ever saw” or “Liberty don’t work as good in practice as it does in speeches.”\n\nIn 1969 the compilation “Will Rogers: Wise and Witty Sayings” included a version with the word “near”:\n\nLiberty don’t work near as good in practice as it does in speeches.\n\nIn 1974 the “Instant Quotation Dictionary” printed a version with “doesn’t” instead of “don’t”:\n\nLiberty doesn’t work as well in practice as it does in speeches.\n\nWill Rogers\n\nIn conclusion, Will Rogers should receive credit for the statement he wrote in the 1927 collection “There’s Not a Bathing Suit in Russia & Other Bare Facts”. The variant forms were derived from the initial remark.\n\n(Great thanks to Donna Halper whose inquiry led QI to formulate this question and perform this exploration. Halper mentioned some of the different versions she had encountered.)"
