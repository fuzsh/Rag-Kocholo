        "text": "Named “Best Old West Fiction Publisher” by True West magazine and earning a Lariat Award from the Western Writers of America, as well as honors for multiple titles from the Will Rogers Medallion organization, Five Star, an imprint of Gale, part of Cengage Learning, is leading the western literature genre. Recognizing excellence in Western literature and media, the Will Rogers Medallion Award Committee recently honored four titles from Five Star, including gold and silver awards, and True West magazine acknowledged a Five Star author and title in its latest “Best of the West” issue.\n\n“Five Star is thrilled to be recognized for our work in the western genre,” said Paul Gazzolo, senior vice president and general manager, Gale. “Western literature is deeply rooted in history and American tradition, and our authors have perfectly combined the adventure of the frontier with period detail to create exceptional pieces of frontier fiction for readers.”\n\nThe Will Rogers Medallion Awards, founded by Will Rogers – a respected writer and cowboy entertainer who wrote about the traditions and values of the American cowboy, are one of the most prestigious western literature honors, and four titles from Five Star have been honored, including:\n\nGold Medallion Award for Jury Of Six, by Dave P. Fisher, a steadily moving western set against the backdrop of 1880 Nebraska that chronicles the disappearance of local ranchers,\n\nSilver Medallion Award for Dark Prairie by John D. Nesbitt, a mystery set in 1890’s Wyoming that depicts the consequences when a stranger comes to town and digs into affairs of a local developer, and\n\nHonorable Mention recognition for Mundy’s Law by Monty McCord and The Pursuit of Murieta by Thomas D. Clagett.\n\nIn addition to honoring Five Star as the “Best Old West Fiction Publisher,” True West magazine named Five Star title The Poacher’s Daughter: A Western Story by Michael Zimmer to its “Top 10 Fiction Favorites list,” and recognized Five Star author J.D. March as “Best New Western Author” for the title Dance with the Devil."
