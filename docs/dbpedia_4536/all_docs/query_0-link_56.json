        "text": "Imagine Dragons' Dan Reynolds has been making this dark year a little lighter with his Grade-A social media content, and now the rest of the band is getting in on the action. On Thursday (December 10), Imagine Dragons uploaded a cover of \"White Christmas,\" and paired it with a hilarious video.\n\nIn the clip, Reynolds sings the iconic holiday tune while showing off his best dance moves dressed in a Santa suit. Bassist Ben McKee holds his dog, who’s dressed in a candy cane striped outfit, and keeps a serious face (reminiscent of Saturday Night Live’s classic “I Wish It Was Christmas Today” performance). Wayne Sermon plays guitar in a red and green striped onesie and hooded elf robe, and drummer Daniel Platzman plays a pink plastic keyboard, donning a Santa hat and goofy outfit.\n\n\"we dug up this classic cover for your enjoyment,\" the band wrote in the YouTube description. Watch the video above.\n\nReynolds recently teased that the band is working on its fifth studio album. He also joined forces with Tom Morello, Shea Diamond, and the Bloody Beetroots for a rousing protest song called \"Stand Up\" earlier this year.\n\nIf you're looking for some new holiday originals of the alt-rock persuasion, Twenty One Pilots just released \"Christmas Saves The Year\" and FINNEAS dropped \"Another Year\" last week.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
