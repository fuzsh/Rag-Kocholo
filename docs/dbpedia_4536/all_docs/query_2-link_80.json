        "text": "\"Rogers emodied old-time values, yet he 'opportunistically' embraced the new mass-culture media. Apostle of decency, he headlined in the 'all-but pornographic' Ziegfeld Follies. Yagoda...has written the fullest biography of thie AMerican icon, a resonant portrait imbued with Roger's irreverent spirit, yet attuned to both the strengths and limitations of his commonsense, crackerbarrel world view.\" —Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Someone has finally written a good biography od Will Rogers....It's a delight to be reminded that political humor without meanness of spirit is not only possible, but indeed is a great American tradition. Politicians and all who labor with them will relish Ben Yagoda's Will Rogers, but so will those who enjoy show biz tidbits and vaudeville history.\"—New York Times Book Review"
