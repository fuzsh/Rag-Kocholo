        "text": "In honor of Native American Indian Heritage Month, today’s animated Doodle celebrates the plainspoken American Indian actor, humorist, author, filmmaker, and public personality Will Rogers, who famously remarked, “I never met a man I didn’t like.” Born on this day in 1879 at Rogers Ranch in Oologah, Cherokee Territory, the entertainer became known as “America's Cowboy Philosopher.”\n\nThe son of a Cherokee senator who raised Texas longhorns on his ranch, Rogers grew up roping and riding. “A man that don’t love a horse,” he once said, ”there is something the matter with him.” He became so good at fancy rope tricks that he toured the world as “The Cherokee Kid,” a circus performer who ended up on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nRogers produced and starred in a 1922 film called The Ropin’ Fool, moving onto speaking roles in motion pictures like A Connecticut Yankee and State Fair. By 1934, he was considered one of the most popular actors in Hollywood. He also hosted a highly rated radio show and authored bestselling books and newspaper columns. When the Great Depression hit America, Rogers emerged as a notable commentator expressing popular opinion on many issues of the time.\n\nNo matter how successful he became, Rogers always remained proud of his Cherokee heritage. While never hesitating to offer his humorous homespun wisdom about current events and politics, though apart from a brief stint as honorary mayor of Beverly Hills, Rogers resisted efforts to be drafted into public service.\n\nRogers’ childhood home near Oologah, Oklahoma is now a museum open to the public. His life and times also inspired a musical called The Will Rogers Follies. His legacy lives on through the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Oklahoma and the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, California. To learn more, visit willrogers.com.\n\nLook back at the impact of Will Rogers' life on Google Arts & Culture, made in collaboration with Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., leader of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rogers estate and the Will Rogers Memorial for their partnership on this project. Below are some historic photographs of Will Rogers displaying his skill at riding and rope tricks.\n\nOn behalf of our family, I was thrilled to learn that my great grandfather, Will Rogers, had been chosen for a Doodle that will appear on his 140th birthday. Will Rogers was an unofficial ambassador for the United States and had a presence that can still be felt to this day.\n\nThere are numerous awards, parks, schools, airports, organizations, foundations, state and federal buildings around the world that bear his name. Known as Oklahoma’s favorite son, his larger than life statue represents the state inside the United States Capitol, in the house connecting the corridor just outside Statuary Hall.\n\nIt's a privilege to represent the family and travel throughout the United States to promote his legacy. It makes me proud to hear stories that are passed down to those of my generation. Will spoke to the common man and gave ease and relief to those suffering from everything including natural disasters and the Great Depression.\n\nA memorable story is that of a gentleman who once said, “The only time I ever saw my father cry was the day Will Rogers died”. Will Rogers had a natural way of communicating to the rich and the poor. He was a ray of hope when America felt lost and alone. Most of his sayings and writings are still relevant and are used almost daily in today's media.\n\nThe Rogers family is proud of those who continue to promote Will's memory. Including the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades CA, Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation, and the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Oklahoma.\n\nIt is with great excitement that we add today’s Doodle to this list!\n\nJennifer Rogers-Etcheverry\n\nGreat Granddaughter of Will Rogers\n\nAll photographs courtesy of The Rogers estate and the Will Rogers Memorial.\n\nDoodler Q&A with Kevin Laughlin\n\nToday's Doodle was created by San Francisco-based artist Kevin Laughlin.\n\nBelow, Kevin shares some thoughts on the making of the Doodle:\n\nQ: What part of Will Rogers’ story do you find most inspiring personally?\n\nA: I deeply admire people who are able to maintain a positive view of others around them in a time of adversity. To be able to see an inherent good in everyone, enough at least to have uttered the phrase \"I never met a man I didn't like,” Will left behind a philosophy worth aspiring to indeed.\n\nQ: Is there a specific Will Rogers film or story that resonates with you?\n\nA: I find the idea of a cowboy, who is also a newspaper columnist, deeply satisfying.\n\nQ: What was your creative approach for the Doodle in celebrating Will Rogers’ 140th Birthday? How did you choose that approach?\n\nA: My approach to this Doodle was unique in that I spent a considerable amount of time reading through Will's quotes, as opposed to studying imagery.\n\nQ: What do you hope people will take away from this Doodle?\n\nA: Do yourself a favor and learn more about Will Rogers! He was an incredible figure. The only thing better than being familiar with his work is being able to experience it for the first time.\n\nEarly draft and sketches of the Doodle"
