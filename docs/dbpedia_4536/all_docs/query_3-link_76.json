Bruce wrote the novel because of his lifelong love and advocacy for dogs, and his charitable efforts on behalf of animals began even before the book was published. He and his wife Cathryn Michon put together a charity pre-sale program for A Dog’s Purpose that connected 33 Independent Booksellers with 33 grassroots dog charities. For every pre-order, 20% of the cover price of the book went to the charity. The book debuted on the New York Times bestseller list (where it sat for 63 weeks) and thousands of dollars were raised for the charities all over the country.\n\n2022 — Birmingham, Alabama — No Award Presented\n\n2021 — Virtual Conference — Ted Streuli\n\n2020 – Conference Canceled due to Pandemic\n\n2019 — Buffalo, NY — Chaplain Norris Burkes\n\n2018 — Cincinnati, Ohio — Ginnie Netherton Graham\n\n2017 — Manchester, NH — Suzette Martinez Standring\n\nSuzette Martinez Standing, a Massachusetts columnist, blogger, author, writing instructor, speaker, and TV show host, was recognized for her record of community service in the Boston suburb of Milton, Mass.

As head of a special Finance Committee she led an effort to engage the club members and convince them to use the money to make an immediate and significant impact on the community. As a result of Standring’s leadership, the club designated $350,000 for a scholarship endowment and gave $150,000 in financial assistance to 20 organizations in the Milton community to carry out various humanitarian activities.

Waters was also the first winner of the Will Rogers writing contest in 2006 and was honored at the Will Rogers Writers’ Workshop in Oklahoma City in 2007.\n\nTen years ago Waters joined a church which, as one of its good works, travels to Mexico twice a year to help build houses. About returning to the states, he wrote, “The border agent asked if I had anything to declare. I didn’t say it, because I’m sure he’s heard everything, but what I thought was: ‘Be the neighbor you’d want to have.’”\n\nWaters has been that kind of neighbor in his community. For several years he has taken part in Big Sunday, a Southern California charitable event which pairs volunteers with needy local schools and organizations. George has painted school hallways, planted vegetable gardens and cleaned classrooms.

Age 31 in mid-2015, Kwiatkowski was the youngest recipient since the Rogers award began in 2000 and already had received more than 30 journalism awards. Kwiatowski has been quoted as having said: “What grips me is the pressure to share those people’s stories in the most accurate, comprehensive way possible. And to do so with sensitivity and respect. There are easier jobs, that’s for sure. But I wanted this one because I believe that people — particularly those who can’t speak for themselves — deserve a voice.”\n\n2014 — Washington, D.C. — Michael Paul Williams\n\nThe Virginia journalist has been called “the oppressed people’s correspondent.” Michael Paul Williams is metro columnist and a reporter for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

He also believes “humanitarianism, by definition, should be a journalist’s highest calling.” Williams is a graduate of Virginia Union and Northwestern universities. In 2012, he was selected as a humanitarian honoree by the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities, about which he said, “When you’ve been accused of being a racist hatemonger for decades, it’s hard to process being called a humanitarian.” Williams promotes worthy charities in his column as well trying to right wrongs. “I love that newspapers have the power to influence events in that way,” he said.\n\n2013 — Hartford, Conn. — Mike Morin\n\nNew Hampshire columnist and ex-radio broadcaster Mike Morin, who has used his public forum to raise millions of dollars to help others was the 2013 winner of the Will Rogers Humanitarian Award.
