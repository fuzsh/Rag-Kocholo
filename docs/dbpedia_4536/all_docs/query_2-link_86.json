        "text": "I’ve always enjoyed hearing stories about how couples met.\n\nBut for this one I suppose I should start by telling you who Will Rogers was. Born in 1879, He was an Oklahoma cowboy, actor (both on the stage and in the movies), comedian, radio personality and newspaper columnist. Our grandparents and great-grandparents and even great-great-grandparents probably read his Daily Telegrams in the newspaper each day before they read anything else.\n\nOne writer said this about why people in the 1920s and 1930s liked Will’s articles so much in the newspapers: “It was the sound of a letter from a good, wise, and funny friend.” It makes me think of the two columnists in The Gaston Gazette I enjoy reading first each week — Pam Stone and Bill Poteat.\n\nBut the way that Will met his wife was that in the fall of 1900, Betty Blake who was 20 years old came to visit her sister in Oologah, Oklahoma, which was then Indian Territory. Oklahoma didn’t become a state until 1907. Will lived on a ranch a few miles outside of Oologah.\n\nBetty’s sister’s husband was the train station manager at Oologah.\n\nOologah was a very small town and really not much more than a train stop. Betty’s sister and her husband lived in the three little rooms in the depot.\n\nOne day Betty was sitting in the bay window at the station when a train came in from Kanas City. Before her brother-in-law could get the packages and baggage unloaded that came in on the train, a young man, also 20 years old, came into the station to pick his package up.\n\nBetty went to the window to help him but before she could say anything, he saw her and immediately turned around and walked out of the building without so much as saying a word.\n\nA moment or so later, her brother-in-law came in with the express packages. One was a banjo addressed to Will Rogers. She said she knew right then that he had come to get it but had been too shy to ask her.\n\nA few nights later Betty and Will were invited to supper by Mrs. Ellis who ran the hotel in Oologah. Mrs. Ellis had two daughters, Kate and Lil who were also about the same age as Will and Betty.\n\nBetty said Will was also very quiet during the meal, but after supper he shared some songs with the group he had brought with him on a roll of music he’d gotten in Kansas City. Betty said he lost every trace of shyness then.\n\nShe said we country youngsters were impressed with these new songs from the city that Will was singing to us in just the same way he had heard them sung there. One of them was “Hello, My Baby, Hello, My Honey, Hello, My Ragtime Gal.”\n\nWhen Betty left to go home to her sister’s that night, Will gave his roll of new songs to her and asked her if she would try to learn to play them on her sister’s piano. A night or two later Will visited Betty at her sister’s, and Betty had learned how to play them.\n\nBetty was very accomplished musically and played them on both the piano and banjo as Will sang. Reflecting on this happy night many years later in the book she wrote about Will, Betty admitted that she had shown off her musical talents quite a bit that night and was quite sure she had outdone herself in “fancy plinking and plunking.”\n\nWill who was known for his great roping skills would marry Betty eight years later. He always said, “The day I roped Betty was the star performance of my life.” But it all began with some “fancy plinking and plunking.”\n\nRick Dominy is a Gaston County resident who gives humorous talks to civic groups and can be reached at 704-675-4862 or humorick007@gmail.com."
