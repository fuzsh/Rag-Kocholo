        "text": "Will Rogers was a popular cowboy-turned-entertainer in the early 1900s. He was one of the most well-known celebrities during the 1920s and 1930s. He was born in 1879 on a ranch that was part of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. During his life he traveled the world three times. He later went to work on a ranch in Texas, where he became well known for his lassoing abilities. In 1902, he joined a Wild West show, where he rode broncos and threw lassos, including his trick of throwing three lassos at one time to lasso the neck of the horse, the legs of the horse, and the rider all at the same time. Because of his talents many people came out to see the show.\n\nRogers began to add one-liners to his act, and he eventually became more popular for this than his lassoing. He started a vaudeville act in 1904. He spent the next ten years performing his act around the country. He performed for then president Woodrow Wilson in 1916; later that year, he joined a folly show as an emcee and a comedian. Rogers made a movie in 1918, and in 1919, he moved with his family to California to make movies under a contract with Goldwyn Studios. In 1929, he began making movies with sound under a contract with Fox studios, and he did radio broadcasts as well. By 1933, Rogers was the highest paid actor in Hollywood. Tragically, in 1935, Rogers was killed in an airplane crash."
