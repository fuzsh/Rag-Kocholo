        "text": "I never gave much thought to subtitles until a dozen or so years ago, when my first book, a biography of Will Rogers, was being readied for publication. The consensus was that the title would be, simply, \"Will Rogers.\" The publishing house suggested \"An American Life\" for a subtitle. This had a certain ring to it, yet it was a ring I couldn't help feeling I had heard before and would hear again. So I resisted, successfully. The subtitle ended up being two words that went beyond simple cliché into profound vanilla: \"A Biography.\"\n\nBut I was glad I had stood my ground, especially when, over the years, I noted numerous reiterations of \"An American Life.\" And it turned out, after I had looked into some libraries and databases, that this was repeated even more than I had imagined. I found that the first use was apparently in Mark Schorer's 1961 \"Sinclair Lewis: An American Life.\" Since then \"An American Life\" has followed the colon in biographies of Daniel Boone, Ralph Bunche, Lucius D. Clay, Benjamin Franklin, D.W. Griffith, Ben Hogan, William Dean Howells, Burt Lancaster, Archibald MacLeish, John P. Marquand, Jesse Owens, Joe Papp, Oral Roberts and Dr. Spock (but, oddly, so far as I could tell, no women).\n\nMy next book was called \"About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made.\" I thought up the subtitle and was pleased with it. I was a little less pleased, a year later, to encounter a book subtitled \"The Black Death and the World It Made\" and less pleased than that with last year's \"Explorers House: National Geographic and the World It Made.\"\n\nBut I'm not all that upset. Nobody really notices subtitles. They are a sort of lottery ticket in the economics of nonfiction book marketing. Publishers throw all kinds of elements in them -- vogue words and phrases, features of the book the title didn't get around to mentioning, talismanic locutions like \"An American Life\" -- in the (almost always) vain hope that something will pay off.\n\nWhat's changed recently is that the subtitle has been asked to bear ever more weight. So many books are published nowadays that each one needs to proclaim its own merits; and with advertising budgets shaved away to nothing, the task falls to subtitles. As a result, they have become ubiquitous, hyperbolic and long.\n\nThis is oddly reminiscent of past practices. From the earliest printed books through the 18th century, a subtitle was expected to describe, justify and promote a volume, in as much detail as its title page had room for. The subtitle to one 1790's letter-writing manual begins \"or, Young Secretary's Instructor in Polite Modern Letter-Writing. Containing Near Four Hundred Original, Plain, Easy, Instructive, and Entertaining Letters on the Most Useful and Important Subjects,\" and goes on for an astonishing 120 additional words. Only slightly less windy was Defoe's \"Life and Most Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of AMERICA, near the Mouth of the Great River of OROONOQUE; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. WITH an Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by PYRATES.\" The cultural historian Gerard Genette has noted that such \"narrative\" subtitles disappeared as a convention in the early 1800's -- perhaps because books could be promoted or explained by other means, like advertisements and reviews -- but have since been used \"as an ironical or compassionate pastiche,\" by the likes of Dickens, García Márquez and Erica Jong.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
