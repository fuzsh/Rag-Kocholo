        "text": "Rogers Arena is the biggest sporting venue in Vancouver. Not technically—its next-door neighbour, BC Place stadium, is more than twice its size—but spiritually. BC Place hosts soccer and football, but Rogers Arena hosts basically everything else: lacrosse games, esports events, UFC matches, WWE spectacles, and tennis tournaments.\n\nMost importantly, Rogers Arena is home to the city’s beloved Vancouver Canucks hockey team.\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks joined the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1970, originally playing at a small arena in east Vancouver, Pacific Coliseum. Their first win was a 5-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. While the Canucks have not yet won the Stanley Cup, they have made the Stanley Cup Finals three times: 1982, 1994, and 2011.\n\nI’ve been a big fan of the Canucks ever since I moved here in 2010, and this season I even started working at Rogers Arena as a Host. It’s given me an insider’s look at the arena, and I’m here to help everyone who comes watch a game have an amazing time.\n\nCanucks History at Rogers Arena\n\nDuring the 1982 Stanley Cup Conference Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks, Canuck’s coach Roger Neilson became frustrated with calls by the game officials. After the assistant coach yelled out, “We give up! We surrender, we give up!” Neilson made a gesture of mock surrender: he placed a white towel on the end of a hockey stick and held it up. A few players on the bench did the same with their sticks. Neilson was ejected from the game and fined, and the Canucks lost the game.\n\nBut the gesture connected with the fans, who started waving white towels during the next home games (then at Pacific Coliseum), and spurred the team into action. They won the series and made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time.\n\nIt became a tradition known as “Towel Power.” The Canucks now hand out towels for all playoff games, and there is a statue of Roger Neilson outside Rogers Arena in the North Plaza.\n\nThe team made it to the Finals again in during the 1993/1994 season, this time against the New York Rangers. The Finals went all the way to Game 7; Vancouver lost 3-2. While the game was played at Madison Square Garden in New York, there was a riot back here in Vancouver.\n\nAfter one more season at Pacific Coliseum, the Canucks began playing at their new home, General Motors Arena. The Sedin twins, Henrik and Daniel, were drafted by the Canucks in 1999 and remained with the team for the next next 18 years. Goalie Roberto Luongo joined in 2005.\n\nLuongo helped Team Canada win the men’s hockey gold medal at the newly renamed Rogers Arena at the Winter Olympics in 2010. The With Glowing Hearts display at Section 318 in the arena shares Olympics hockey memories, including a video of the “Golden Goal” and the men’s gold medal ceremony, to arena visitors.\n\nA Ring of Honour was created in 2010 for the team’s 40th anniversary. Eight former players have their name and image displayed in a ring around the arena’s ceiling as a celebration of their achievements and impact on the franchise. These players include Orland Kurtenbach (the team’s first captain), Pat Quinn (defenceman, head coach, general manager, and president), and, as of 2023, Luongo.\n\nSix players, including the Sedin twins, also have banners with their retired numbers hanging from the ceiling. These players also have an interactive museum space at Rogers Arena called the Legends Locker Room at Section 316.\n\nAfter being in the stands when the Canadian women’s hockey team won Olympic gold at Rogers Arena (a few days before the men’s team repeated the feat), I moved to Vancouver in 2010 and quickly became a Canucks fan. It happened to be perfect timing; that team is considered to be one of the best in the team’s history.\n\nHenrik Sedin was team captain, and his brother Daniel led the team in goals and league in points. There was Ryan Kesler, Manny Malhotra, and Alex Burrows. Luongo was one of the top goalies in the league, and fans cheered him on with loud “Luuuuuu”s whenever he made a great save.\n\nWithout a TV at home, I listened to games on the radio. But I did manage to make it to a few home games to cheer them on in person, and I also volunteered as a 50/50 lotto ticket seller at Rogers Arena for a game in April that season.\n\nThe Canucks made it to the Stanley Cup Finals that season, too. There was more Towel Power. There were watch parties at large screens downtown. There were the Green Men—an energetic duo in green spandex suits who made their first appearance during the 2009/2010 season. They got seats next to the away team’s penalty box and razzed the players as they waited out their two minutes. (The Green Men remained an iconic part of the Canucks experience until 2015.)\n\nUnfortunately, the Canucks lost to the Boston Bruins in Game 7 of the Finals—and again there was a riot. I was nearby, watching the game at a friend’s apartment, but we left downtown when things started looking bad for the team and the neighbourhood.\n\nI returned the next morning, though, to help clean up. Countless other volunteers had already done so much, so the work was quick. I wrote messages on the wooden boards that covered broken store windows and ate the pancake breakfast. The experience made me feel like a true local; I was hooked on the team and the city for life.\n\nGame-Time Experience at Rogers Arena\n\nDoors open an hour before the game, and it’s worth coming early because there is a lot to see and do before the game starts.\n\nfood and drink\n\nFirst, food and beverage stands open right away, so you can grab a bite before the lines build. There are lots of food options at Rogers Arena. Korean chicken bites from Crisp (Section 111) is a staff favourite, and nachos, particularly the deluxe option, are a fan favourite. Triple O’s is a classic Vancouver choice. Carve and Catch stands have some delicious meat and seafood selections. For special drinks, there’s a wine bar at Section 122 and tequila bar at 322.\n\nBeer and popcorn hawkers sell in the stands for those who don’t want to miss any of the action. There’s also the SportsBar entrance at Section 301 for those looking for a full-service restaurant.\n\nFYI: Food and drink stands are open until the 12-minute mark of the third period.\n\nPre-Game Warm-up\n\nEveryone can go to the ice level for the pre-game warm-up, with starts about 30 minutes before the game. Go to the 100-level and walk down to the ice. The sooner you get there, the more likely you are go get a spot at the glass. Bring a clever sign! The warm-up is 15 minutes, after which you can go to your seats for the game.\n\nTIP: Look at the orca logo at centre ice; the whale is looking at the side of the ice where the Canucks skate, so you know where to stand and watch the warm-up.\n\nFinding Your Seat\n\nWhen you get to your section, show the Host your tickets. We love helping you find your seat! (It also helps us confirm everyone is sitting in the correct seats so we don’t need to move people around during the game.)\n\nBasically, there are 25 rows of seats in lower bowl, the 100 sections, and 12-15 rows in upper bowl, the 300s. Row 1 is down closer to the ice. Seat numbers in the 100s (101, 102, etc.) are to the left of the entrance, and seats 1, 2, 3, etc. are to right.\n\nPre-Game Show\n\nThe pre-game show starts 15 minutes before the game. This includes cool videos of the players, a traditional welcome from Vancouver’s three host First Nations, and the national anthem.\n\nDuring the Game\n\nFans can’t enter the stands during the anthem or while the game is in play and must wait for the referees to whistle and stop the action. Why? Because getting to your seat blocks the view of the fans around you, and hockey is such a quick sport that fans don’t want to miss any of the action. This means that Hosts like me will hold you in the tunnel entrance and you’ll have to wait for the next stoppage, which could be a few seconds or several minutes.\n\nWhile the game is on, stay seated—but of course, you can stand up to cheer after a goal or a particularly exciting play. In the upper bowl, don’t lean on safety railing because it blocks the view of those above you.\n\nAlways watch for flying pucks! There’s a net to protect fans in the areas most likely to see a wayward puck, like behind the nets, but it’s always a good idea to pay attention, just in case.\n\nIf—excuse me, when the Canucks score, the goal song is “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds. (It kinda makes me want to punch the air like Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club.) Helpfully, the “La la la laaa”s are on the screen like in karaoke so that fans can sing along. After, the announcer shares who scored and assisted the goal and yells an iconic ”Wooo!” at the end of the announcement. Fans repeat the “Wooo!” because it’s fun.\n\nIf you’re lucky, you might get to see a player get a hat trick—score three goals in a single game. When that happens, many fans throw their caps onto the ice. At Rogers Arena, the caps are collected and kept so you can get your hat back after the game. In that case, go to the security office at Gate 9.\n\nTIP: Write your name in your hat. The Canucks have had five hat tricks already this season, so that’s a lot of hats…\n\nBesides the action on the ice, there’s lots for fans in the stands, too. Music will play in the stadium during short play stoppages and longer commercial breaks. DJ Tom Fleming does an awesome job with the music and keeping it feeling like a party. The longer breaks allow for the stadium entertainment crew to do some fun activities, like T-shirt tosses, fan interviews and contests, and big-screen video entertainment like fan dance competitions.\n\nFYI: You’ll know it’s a commercial break when the clean-up crew skates onto the ice to quickly shovel ice shavings off the ice. These “TV time-outs” happen at approximately at the 6, 10, and 14-minute marks of a period, but of course it really depends on the action of the game.\n\nKeep an eye out for Fin, the team’s awesome mascot. He makes his way around the stands and interacts with the fans. As an orca (aka “killer whale”), has also likes to take a bite out of the competition and may be seen chomping down on a mini mascot of the opposing team. Keep an ear out, too, for Crazy P. He can often been heard banging a traditional Indigenous drum and leading fans in cheers during the game.\n\nThe intermissions between periods are 18 minutes long. For those who stay behind in the seats, there is a variety of entertainment. The first intermission always has a short “Mini Minor” hockey game, where a minor hockey team (kids about six years old) play for the crowd. There’s also dance or song performances, contests, interviews, and more.\n\nIn the Concourse\n\nFor fans that are feeling overwhelmed by the noise, Guest Services (at Sections 114 and 311, or 104 for Club Seats) have ear plugs for adults and headphones for kids. Guest Services has other things, too, like booster seats, wheelchair/stroller storage, and lost-and-found items during the game (after, go instead to Gate 9). Since Rogers Arena is cashless, you can get gift cards there so you’re able to buy food or drinks. For new fans, Guest Services also has “My First Game” pins to help you celebrate the big day.\n\nThe Canucks also have BC’s biggest 50/50 draw—a lottery in which 50% of the jackpot goes to charity, in this case the Canucks for Kids Fund, and 50% to the winner. The Canucks for Kids Fund is a collection of three different charities: the Canucks Autism Network, co-founded by the Canucks co-owners; BC Children’s Hospital; and Canucks Place hospice. The fund also works with other community charities. Fans 19 years of age or older can purchase tickets online (must be in British Columbia) or in the arena up to the end of the second intermission. Look for volunteers in the green aprons.\n\nUntil the last period, there’s a 360-degree camera at Section 103, which will take a circular slow-motion video of you and your friends. During and after the game, fans can buy Canucks merchandise at the main store (Section 113) or at several kiosks located around the building.\n\nCheck out the orca whale carving at Gate 8 upstairs (Section 329). The wooden statue, which is a stylized version of the Canuck’s whale logo, stands three metres tall. It was carved by Haida artist James Hart, who also carved the reconciliation pole at UBC.\n\nUpstairs, Rogers Arena has a few museum-like displays that highlight great moments of Canucks and Rogers Arena history. The Legends Locker Room (Section 316) has memorabilia from some of the team’s greatest players; lift the wooden benches for more. The nearby With Glowing Hearts display (Section 318) has videos and stories from the 2010 Winter Olympics, which took place at Rogers Arena.\n\nSome of my favourite parts about being a Host are chatting with fans at the door or while we wait for a whistle, taking photos of guests, and helping everyone have a great time. As a Host and a fan, I know that watching a hockey game at Rogers Arena is an experience not to be missed. Go Canucks go!\n\nWhat’s your favourite Canucks memory?
