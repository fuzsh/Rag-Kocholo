        "text": "The Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon has a No Refund / No Deferral policy. All entries are considered final upon payment. Transfers to another person are not allowed. Any athlete who allows someone else to participate in their place will face disqualification from the event and not be allowed to participate in future events. There are no exceptions to this rule as it is a requirement of our insurance provider. All proceeds benefit the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum and its year-round operation. If you purchased refund protect, you can submit your claim below.\n\nSubmit a refund protect claim: Request form and Refund Protect Terms and Conditions.\n\nNo. You must present your bib number and ID to pick up your packet at the Expo. We also ask that you review the information sent in your bib confirmation email for accuracy. This is the perfect time to let us know if your address has changed or will change, and if your gender, age and wheelchair status are correct. This will ensure proper division placement for the official race results. If for any reason you do not receive or misplace your final confirmation, please visit the bib look-up computers inside the Expo.\n\nYou will be notified of your assigned bib number when you receive your final confirmation the Thursday before Race Weekend. Bib number assignments are not available via email and will only be released with final confirmations. If for any reason you do not receive or misplace your final confirmation, please visit the bib look-up computers inside the Expo.\n\nWe use the Chronotrack timing system to ensure that everyone receives an accurate time. Per USATF Rule 245.1, Open Men’s and Women’s and Master Men’s and Women’s top three awards in the Marathon and the Half Marathon will be based on gun time (the order in which the athletes cross the finish line). Age group and Relay awards will be based on timing system time (the actual time elapsed between an athlete reaching the Start Line and Finish Line). Digital clocks will be located at each mile and at the 5K splits to indicate the unofficial running time. The digital clocks at the Finish Line display your unofficial time. Official time is determined by the Chronotrack timing system. In order to receive an accurate time, please confirm your bib is:\n\nClearly visible on the FRONT of the torso.\n\nUnaltered or modified. Do not fold or wrinkle or you risk breaking the timing chip.\n\nPinned in all four corners so the timing chip stays flat.\n\nNot covered with jackets, water bottles, etc. so as not to block the reading of the timing chip.\n\nThere’s lots going on before the race kicks off. Join us at 5:30am at the Survivor Tree for an inspiring pre-race sunrise service. Announcements start at 6 am and include the 168 seconds of silence (one for each of those killed in the Oklahoma City bombing), which runners tell us creates the most moving race start anywhere. Cheer on the wheelchair athletes as their race begins at 6:25am before you take off at 6:30am.\n\nRunners in the Marathon will have 6.5 hours of course support starting from when the last corral is released from the Start Line. If Marathon runners are not to the course split at Mile 7.5 by 8:45am, they will be directed to the Half Marathon course. To complete the Marathon or Relay without being disqualified, you need be at mile 20 by noon, or you will be shuttled to Scissortail Park to enjoy the Finish Line Festival.\n\nRunners in the Half Marathon will have 4.5 hours of course support starting from when the last corral is released from the Start Line. If you are not at Mile 9 by 10:00am, you will be shuttled back to Scissortail Park to enjoy the Finish Line Festival.\n\nRunners in the 5K will have 1.5 hours of course support starting from when the last corral is released from the Start Line.\n\nVolunteer groups, are located every mile along the course. In addition to entertainment and enthusiastic cheering, each Water Stop provides water and Powerade to participants. Some Water Stops also provide oranges, pretzels and other snacks. Many neighborhoods and other groups set up their own water stops and provide a variety of drink and snack options. GU is available at Water Stop 13. Medical Stations are located every other mile beginning at mile 5, and every mile from mile 19 to the finish. Port-o-Potties are located every mile starting at mile 2.\n\nWhat is not allowed on course: Backpacks, hydration vests, CamelBaks, rucksacks, air tanks and other over-the-shoulder equipment inflatable costumes, bicycles, scooters, strollers (with the exception of the 5K and Kids Marathon where we ask that all strollers be at the back of corral), roller blades, roller skates, any wheeled item other than wheelchairs. No animals with the exception of ADA approved service dogs. All individuals running with a service dog will need to fill out a waiver and get prior approval.\n\nRunning belts, hand-held water bottles and clip-on water bottles less than one liter are allowed. In accordance with USATF guidelines, wheelchair athletes must wear helmets. Thank you for helping us keep the Marathon safe for everyone.\n\nNo persons are authorized to be on the course unless they are registered participants or authorized Marathon staff. Therefore, no person shall be allowed to accompany a participant if they are not registered, nor shall any participant be allowed, without the permission of management, to receive assistance or refreshment from anyone during the progress of any race. Any person not properly displaying an official bib number will be directed to leave the course.\n\nVolunteer groups, are located every mile along the course. In addition to entertainment and enthusiastic cheering, each Hydration Station provides water and Powerade to participants. Some Hydration Stations also provide oranges, pretzels, pickle juice and other snacks. Many neighborhoods and other groups set up their own Hydration Stations and provide a variety of drink and snack options. GU is available at Hydration Stations 8, 10, 14 and 17. There are 16 Medical Stations and 22 Hydration Stations located along the course. For exact locations, check out the interactive map. Port-o-Potties are located every mile starting at mile 1."
