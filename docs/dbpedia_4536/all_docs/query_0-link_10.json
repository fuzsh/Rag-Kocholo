There's one phase in this amusement campaign which I think you ought to understand. The zones in... [overcome by her good looks, he stops] You're beautiful.\n\nMary Adams:\n\nAh, of course I'm not.\n\nLawrence Cromwell:\n\nWhat's that?\n\nMary Adams:\n\nI said I'm not beautiful.\n\nLawrence Cromwell:\n\nYoung woman, you're talking to Lawrence Cromwell... Lawrence Cromwell, the world's recognized authority on feminine beauty and charm. Do you mean to stand there and question my judgment on the subject of beauty? Do you? Do you?\n\nMary Adams:\n\nOh, no, no, I wasn't...\n\nLawrence Cromwell:\n\nOh, but you DID question it. Now, you listen to me: when Lawrence Cromwell says a girl's beautiful, she's BEAUTIFUL, do you understand? Ha, the very idea! I demand an apology. Your personality definitely puts you in Class 10-A, Department B, with a double-X rating in my card index system. And, my system is the pre-eminent beauty catalogue of today. [sizing her up at a glance] Height, 5 foot 4... weight, 116... bust, 34... waist, 26... hips, 36... calf, 12 and 1/2... ankle, 7. Questioning my judgement! Ha, ha, that is good.\n\nMary Adams:\n\nI'm really awfully sorry, Mr. Cromwell."
