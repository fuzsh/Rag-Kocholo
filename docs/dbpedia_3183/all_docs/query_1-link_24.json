For more details on the early history of the area, see Haidian District. Zhongguancun has long existed since 1950's and only became a household name in the early 1980s. The first person who envisioned the future for Zhongguancun was Chen Chunxian, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), who came up with the idea for a Silicon Valley in China after he visited the U.S. as part of a government-sponsored trip. The location of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within Zhongguancun reinforced, and perhaps was in part responsible for the technological growth in this area.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and still today, Zhongguancun was known as \"electronics avenue,\" because of its connections to information technology and the preponderance of stores along a central, crowded street.\nZhongguancun was officially recognized by the central government of China in 1988. It was given the wordy name \"Beijing High-Technology Industry Development Experimental Zone.\"\nThe current designation Zhongguancun refers commonly to the original site. However, officially (as of 1999) Zhongguancun has become the \"Zhongguancun Science & Technology Zone.\" It is a zone with seven parks, including Haidian Park, Fengtai Park, Changping Park, Electronics City (in Chaoyang), Yizhuang Park, Desheng Park, and Jianxiang Park.
