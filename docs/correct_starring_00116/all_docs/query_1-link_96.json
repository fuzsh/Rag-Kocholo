        "text": "By summer’s end, Independence Day will almost certainly have eclipsed Jurassic Park as the most successful film ever. Though both films are sci-fi-oriented and rely on phenomenal special effects, they emanate from very different stables. But there is a common link: Jeff Goldblum.\n\nTen years ago, Goldblum was a respected character actor in offbeat movies that reflected his own unconventional sense of humour. Now he is offbeat in conventional blockbusters - and may be more of a key to Independence Day’s ever-escalating grosses than he would give himself credit for.\n\nRoland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, respectively director, producer and co-writers of Independence Day, wrote the part of underachieving cable guy David specifically for Goldblum. With only a slight sense of irony, Devlin tells me, ‘I don’t know if you know this but in Hollywood, there’s a law that says when you do a sci-fi movie you have to have Jeff Goldblum. But, in all seriousness, Jeff Goldblum is to this kind of movie what Arnold Schwarzenegger is to action movies. There are so few actors who can take relatively technical gobbledy-gook expository dialogue and make it engaging. He has this unique gift.’ Goldblum goes rather quiet when I tell what Devlin said. ‘He said that? That’s great.’\n\nSitting in a historic New York hotel on the eve of Independence Day’s US release, Goldblum is exactly what one expects. Tall and lanky (he’s 6ft 4in), he is also casual, friendly and, well, different. Above all, he is utterly genuine.\n\nA couple of months before this interview, I spotted him Sunday-brunching with girlfriend Laura Dern (they met while making Jurassic Park) at a fashionable West Hollywood restaurant and asked if he minded being photographed with my companion - an excited 14-year-old on holiday from England. This is the most uncool request any LA resident can make, but I knew Goldblum would be only too happy to oblige. (Coincidentally, Goldblum’s ex-wife Geena Davis began a relationship with Dern’s ex-husband, Rene Harlin, around the same time, and they are now married.)\n\nOn the eve of Independence Day’s US opening, Goldblum is clearly psyched. ‘It’s a blast to watch, isn’t it? There are a hundred ways a movie of this size can not come together but I thought it came together beautifully. The audience I saw it with went crazy. It was like they were at a sporting event or a rock concert. To see major cities destroyed in such a realistic way . . . and then seeing people from all over the world putting aside their differences to do something effective was exciting. I loved that. If only it could happen more in life.’\n\nGoldblum has just hinted at one of his personal tenets that each of us in our own small way should be doing more for the world. He is idealistic, a great believer ‘in the ingenuity of our species’.\n\nHe appears consistently moved and inspired by the films he makes. In last year’s Powder (yet to be released in the UK), a moderately successful parable for our times, Goldblum was a teacher (of science, of course) who bonded with the title character, a hairless albino with superhuman intelligence but nonetheless an outcast. It was a metaphor for racism and human intolerance of the body less beautiful.\n\n‘I certainly became more tolerant as a result of that movie. I try to cultivate that in myself, and there’s no finish line in that endeavour. I’m always trying to grow and deepen my sense of appreciation for life. I am quite spiritual and more and more clear about what my conscience tells me to do. I’m very interested in integrity and character.\n\n‘Hollywood culture may believe that looks are everything, but you don’t have to accept that. You can say, ‘Look, I’m the author of my own life and that is not going to be my credo.’\n\nGoldblum is certainly more prolific than he needs to be for the money. He is also something of a rarity among thespians in being able cogently to explain his passion for acting.\n\n‘Acting is about the serious business of play. It asks you to be all of yourself even though you are a contrivance. It asks you to be your most passionate, real, free kind of self your playful self. There’s something about imagination and fantasy and living truthfully and authentically in fantasy that is just delicious.’ Even his use of adjectives is quirky.\n\nIs Goldblum a stickler for what defines his characters - must his character wear a precise brand of dorky spectacles, for example? He ponders the question, gazing deep into space.\n\n‘Whatever’s on me must be perfect. I am kind of fussy about clothes because you learn so much about the character from what they’re wearing. I’m a very touchy kind of guy so the way things feel is very important. I can feel like a different person depending on the shoes on my sensitive feet and the clothes on my smooth pink frame.’ It seems only teaching the craft comes close to the joy of practising it. When in Los Angeles, and whether he’s making a film in the city or not, Goldblum teaches at least one acting class a week - and has done since 1985. About that time, a group of actor friends who had trained together in New York but relocated to Los Angeles began meeting on a weekly basis. From these meetings grew Playhouse West, a now highly regarded acting school.\n\nIn 1994, Goldblum put together, acquired the financing for and directed a short film, Little Surprises. It starred students from his class plus Rod Steiger, and won an Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short.\n\n‘He devoted so much time to that film, over a year,’ explains Robert Carnegie, director of Playhouse West. ‘He is extraordinarily dedicated and does all this out of the goodness of his heart. The students adore him.’\n\nObserving one of Goldblum’s acting classes myself last week only confirmed Carnegie’s words. For three hours on a sweltering Friday afternoon, while his A-list peers were probably keeping cool in their designer pools, he watched, encouraged and gesticulated wildly as his students performed. He never once paused for breath or consulted his watch.\n\n‘Part of it is about giving back,’ he says. ‘I feel I can contribute something. It’s something I’m very passionate about.’ Evidently.\n\nOne of his students, Kerri Groen - whom Goldblum thinks is a real prospect - has been taking his classes for six months. ‘I really didn’t expect him to be so down to earth.’\n\nGroen is moving to London shortly. Goldblum will be in town before her for the UK opening of Independence Day. ‘He said he’s going to look at acting schools for me. That is really above and beyond the call of duty.’\n\nQuietly, Goldblum has become the thinking woman’s sex symbol. Perhaps it was his liaison with the glamorous Geena Davis that caused legions of women to view him in a new light. When I said I was due to interview Goldblum, two female friends swooned loudly and, like giggly schoolgirls, begged for signed photos. And during the acting class, I can’t help noticing what a great body he has.\n\nGoldblum was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - ‘I was one of four kids’ - to a stern disciplinarian father, a doctor, and his wife. He has mentioned being beaten as a child and seeking solace in all things theatrical. He remembers being ‘very turned on’ by a production of Hansel and Gretel. ‘I would wait in the lobby, fake tap dancing and wait for the show to start.’\n\nHaving taught himself to play the piano, and armed with enormous chutzpah for a 15-year-old, he found himself his first job as a restaurant’s cocktail pianist. Fortunately, pursuit of the arts wasn’t a crime punishable by the belt and, with his family’s blessing, he moved to New York to study acting when he was 17.\n\nHe was in his element until the death of his 23-year-old brother, Rick, from a virus. Imbued with a heightened sense of life’s fragility and even more determined to make something of himself, Goldblum moved to Los Angeles and not long afterwards won his first screen role proper in Robert Altman’s 1974 film, California Split. It was his subsequent role as the mysterious nomadic biker in 1975’s Nashville that established the blueprint for Goldblum’s subsequent quirky roles. He was a government dweeb in The Right Stuff, a weird magazine reporter in The Big Chill (both in 1983) and, three years later, played a guy for whom ‘quirky’ was an insufficient description - the techno-boffin trying to metamorphose into The Fly. The film’s huge success, plus the beginning of his romance with co-star Davis, gave him a huge leg up on Hollywood’s slippery ladder.\n\nGoldblum continues to indulge his passion for jazz piano. He still works as a restaurant pianist, though these days it’s for pleasure. He also paints, though he is quick to point out, not as well as his sister Pam. Her art adorns his Spanish-style hacienda in the Hollywood Hills which he is perennially redecorating, and which - until recently - he shared with Laura Dern. The couple have not split up, though. ‘We love spending time together, I’m no expert but I’m trying because a relationship is a very worthwhile thing. It’s like a garden, I guess. It needs constant cultivating, tending and attention.’\n\nWith Independence Day now nudging the $200 million Stateside, Goldblum is finally experiencing fame of a degree even Jurassic Park didn’t accord him.\n\n‘The other day, I was driving and the driver of the car next to me wound the window to ask for directions. Before he could even speak, he went (opens his mouth as wide as it will go). His wife screamed.’\n\nHe pauses, as if unable to comprehend what is happening to him.\n\n‘I’m enjoying it.’\n\nIndependence Day is released on August 9."
