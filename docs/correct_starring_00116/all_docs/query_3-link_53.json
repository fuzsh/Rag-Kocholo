        "text": "Masculinely romantic, The Right Stuff holds up the men who pioneered the United States space program as ultimate American archetypes. Portrayed as cowboys from the past who led the country into the future, one of them is literally depicted on horseback and the others are often shot in silhouette. Then there is the iconic image of the Mercury Seven astronauts in uniform, walking in unison down NASA’s halls. Surely there’s a cologne out there named after this movie.\n\nThat’s not to say that writer-director Philip Kaufman, adapting Tom Wolfe’s 1979 book, doesn’t occasionally puncture such mythologizing. Much attention is paid to the way the government’s publicity campaign surrounding the program both exploited the men and unfairly inflated their reputations. And, as we see in the sequence detailing Gus Grissom’s troubled landing, the astronauts themselves are far from perfect. The Right Stuff also makes some room for the women in their lives, perhaps most cleverly during an elaborate press conference. As a tracking shot moves along the faces of the men being introduced, a mirroring shot does the same with their wives, who are lined up in the audience."
