        "text": "July 29, 2019\n\nâ€” The stars of National Geographic's upcoming \"The Right Stuff\" have now experienced some of the real stuff.\n\nCast members from the new television series had the chance recently to climb in and around supersonic jets at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida as they prepared to portray the space agency's original Mercury 7 astronauts. \"The Right Stuff\" is based on Tom Wolfe's 1979 book by the same title, which chronicled the United States' first human spaceflight program and was the basis for the 1983 film directed by Philip Kaufman.\n\nNational Geographic's first trailer for the series shows the actors at the Cape on July 16, the 50th anniversary of the launch of the first moon landing.\n\n\"What we did today was try to give our actors exposure to the real world of experimental flight test. It's impressive when a production knows how important it is to get this type of hands-on exposure,\" said Dave Kennedy, a retired Navy test pilot who previously served as a technical advisor for ABC's \"The Astronaut Wives Club,\" among other television projects and movies.\n\nCo-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian Way and Warner Horizon Scripted Television, \"The Right Stuff\" features actors Patrick Adams (\"Suits\") and Jake McDorman (\"What We Do in the Shadows\") as John Glenn and Alan Shepard, respectively. The series' other Mercury astronauts include Colin O'Donoghue (\"Once Upon a Time\") as Gordon Cooper, Michael Trotter (\"Underground\") as Gus Grissom, James Lafferty (\"Castle Rock\") as Scott Carpenter, Aaron Staton (\"Narcos: Mexico\") as Wally Schirra and Micah Stock (\"Escape at Dannemora\") as Deke Slayton.\n\n\"The Right Stuff\" trailer.
