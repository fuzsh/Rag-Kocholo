If it was rotten luck for Farrah Fawcett to meet her maker while the paramedics were jumping on Michael Jackson, then pity poor Jeff Goldblum, whose first death notices, that same day, were also slipping by unnoticed. Mercifully, to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of his demise had been greatly exaggerated. The New Zealand climbing accident that had reportedly claimed him proved nothing but an online hoax. “My Mom, for instance, called up going, ‘You’re there!’” he recalls, affecting a relieved moan.\n\n“It was disturbing and trippy. Some other friends called and said, ‘I just wanted to hear your voice.’ It was crazy. Is there any actor as convivial as Goldblum? The tallest working man in showbiz"
