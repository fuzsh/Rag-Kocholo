        "text": "Jurassic World: Dominion, the latest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise, is set to tear up movie screens in June 2022.\n\nActor Jeff Goldblum has been a fixture in every one of the films in the franchise, which began with the first movie in 1993. But in 1990, that was all in the actor's future.\n\nGoldblum turned up at CBC that year to promote the British romantic comedy The Tall Guy. Host Valerie Pringle talked with him about his start in acting, his career to that point and what he found truly rewarding.\n\n\"Why do you teach acting?\" asked Pringle. \"You're busy enough acting. It's interesting that you bother doing that.\"\n\n'Fun and rewarding and satisfying'\n\n\"Oh, it's no bother,\" said Goldblum. \"It's like one of the most fun things I do.\"\n\nAccording to a 1997 profile in the New York Times, Goldblum taught at Playhouse West, a drama school he had co-founded and taught at twice a week.\n\n\"Fun and rewarding and satisfying,\" he elaborated. \"I mean, acting, you're always on the spot ... there's something about teaching that automatically bypasses that.\n\n\"Once you start teaching ... you get clearer about what you're doing. I think I learn from that.\"\n\nEarlier in the conversation, Goldblum recalled a previous trip to Toronto to film 1986's The Fly and said he'd \"love\" to work with Canadian director David Cronenberg again.\n\n\"It was freezing when we were up here,\" said Goldblum. \"I'd have to get five hours of makeup on in the morning ... spend all day in that thing and then go home. It was kind of weird.\"\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times noted another Canadian connection for Goldblum: he is married to Emilie Livingston, a former Olympic rhythmic gymnast who competed for Canada in 2000.\n\nJurassic World: Dominion is scheduled for release in June 2022."
