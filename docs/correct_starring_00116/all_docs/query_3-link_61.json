        "text": "I’ll read anything Tom Wolfe writes. If I could get my hands on his grocery list, it’s probably more entertaining than 80 percent of the books published today. But my favorite Wolfe book is easy to choose: The Right Stuff.\n\nIt’s the story of the beginnings of the American space program, from test pilots like Chuck Yeager through the Mercury Seven astronauts. He told the story of their bravery, of what motivated them to be willing to test the limits of flight and to be strapped to a rocket and risk their lives for the thrill. It’s brilliantly written (of course), contrasting the bureaucrats of NASA with the machismo of the pilots."
