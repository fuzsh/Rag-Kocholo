However, a quick perusal of his biography reveals a remarkably long and respectable career in stage, television, and motion pictures, and a list of film credits reminiscent of the old-time movie stars of Hollywood's golden age.\n\nJeffrey Lynn Goldblum is a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Goldblum confirms in Entertainment Weekly that both his parents \"toyed with show business.\" He was smitten with acting fever in the 1960s when as a starry-eyed young boy, he spent many hours at the neighborhood picture show. These were the days when movie houses were motion picture palaces with balconies were filled with the noise of unescorted kids; the time of Cinema-Scope epics Godzilla and endof-the-world disaster tales very much like the ones in which Goldblum would eventually earn featured roles. The experience affected him profoundly, he confessed: \"All I know is that early on, it was this wild, feverish kind of call for me, I was like, 'I've got to do this.\"'\n\nHe received training in acting, studying with the legendary Sanford Meisner at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse. He honed his skills in live theatre appearing with the New York Shakespeare Festival, the Phoenix Theatre Company, and others. In 1974, he made his first film appearance as a crazed rapist in the New York vigilante tale Death Wish. This role presents quite a contrast for a man who in real life is seen by many and described by Svetky in Entertainment Weekly as a charming, \"smart, likeable oddball.\" Indeed, Goldblum has earned a reputation as being an outsider of sorts, a eccentric who prefers to wear black and is known for his scattered speech—quirks that show up in one way or another in many of his film characters, rendering even decidedly small roles more memorable.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Goldblum made creditable appearances in such films as Robert Altman's well-received Nashville (1975), Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977), Thank Good It's Friday (1978), and the remake of the 1950s horror classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978).\n\nIn 1980, Goldblum co-starred in the short-lived television drama, Tenspeed and Brown Shoe. The detective drama, as described by Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, featured entertainer Ben Vereen as Lionel \"E. L. Turner\" (Tenspeed), a \"charming hustler of disguise\" and Goldblum as \"Lionel Whitney\" (Brown Shoe) as Turner's tonied and \"somewhat naive foil.\" The two men ran a detective agency in the swank Sunset Boulevard section of Los Angeles. The program garnered praise but not enough ratings points and was cancelled after only a few episodes. Among other film productions of that decade, Goldblum appeared in the made-for-television movie, Rehearsal for Murder (1982), The Right Stuff (1983) The Big Chill (1983), and the 1984 cult classic, The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension. He earned the leading role as pioneer television comic Ernie Kovacs in the television movie, Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter (1984).\n\nGoldblum attracted public attention with his portrayal of the \"slightly crazed scientist\" in the 1986 remake of the 1950s horror film, The Fly. He endured five-hour make-up sessions to coordinate his metamorphosis into an insect. ..\".Goldblum has created one of the most sympathetic man-monsters ever seen on screen,\" wrote Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times, \"and the best work under this much latex since John Hurt's Oscar-nominated performance in The Elephant Man.\"\n\nGoldblum played another scientist to much acclaim in 1996 when he was cast as Dr. Ian Malcolm in the Steven Spielberg directed blockbuster hit of the year, Jurassic Park. Though Goldblum had portrayed scientists many times, he suffused this role with personal touches. Instead of wearing a white lab coat and khaki trousers, Goldblum donned gold chains, biker boots, wrap-around shades, and a black, leather jacket. Goldblum oozed suavity and coolness as the consummate \"anti-hero,\" noted Francesca Rievere in Smoke. The role catapulted him into true stardom.\n\nGoldblum followed this success with another blockbuster hit in 1997. Goldblum, alongside popular actor and rap singer Will Smith, battles aliens who seek control of the Earth in Independence Day. The film is replete with a magnificent display of computer-generated special effects but manages to tell an interesting and compelling story. Like Jurassic Park, Independence Day surpassed box office records to become one of the highest earning films of all time. Therefore, in the annals of American film history, notes Svetsky, Jeff Goldblum holds the distinction of having starred in two of top-grossing motion pictures of the twentieth century.\n\nAs the pages of the calendar open to the second century in the history of filmmaking, one can only surmise what the legacy will be for Goldblum who is young and presumably has many decades of filmmaking ahead. His recent projects include production of a film about the Hollywood Ten, the true story of McCarthy-era blacklisted director, Herbert Biberman. And, there are hints of a third sequel to Jurassic Park, a fitting undertaking for a well-established and popular actor seen as perhaps as one of Hollywood's more unique personalities.\n\n—Pamala S.
