In 1947, when the future began somewhere in the middle of the California desert, a pilot flies faster than the speed of sound... Flying higher, faster and harder than anyone before ... always pushing the boundaries, always living on the edge ... the American Air Force test pilots are the bravest, the best, and the most daring--the men with The Right Stuff. Suddenly, these men become the first to ride a rocket as the United States races to put the first man on the moon in this true story of the Mercury astronauts.",

        "text": "The Right Stuff gives off a pleasurable hum: it’s the writer-director Philip Kaufman’s enjoyment of the subject, the actors, and moviemaking itself.\n\nSeptember 13, 2023\n\nThis timely delve into the past - warts and all - to uncover the roots of a future we are now participating in has a basic ingredient that so many films lately have lacked. And that is integrity\n\nAugust 1, 2022\n\nWhere 2001: A Space Odyssey depicted astronauts (and mankind) as being at the mercy of some higher, alien intelligence, The Right Stuff finds its characters imposing their will on the unknown.\n\nMarch 27, 2020\n\nThe Right Stuff is so clumsily shot and has such a simple structure that boredom can threaten to drown the viewer's patience. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\nPhilip Kaufman's 1983 film is an efficient and absorbing recapitulation of the main events of Tom Wolfe's book that still never succeeds in capturing the inner drives and ethics of the test pilots and astronauts - the \"right stuff\" never materializes.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nRarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal... It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.\n\nJanuary 29, 2019\n\nThe Right Stuff is a spectacular celebration of those heroes of the skies -- those fly jocks who fought the demons of space to launch a new era in American air technology.\n\nOctober 22, 2018"
