Once serving as the capital of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara, Bekasi is one of Indonesia’s oldest cities. It now lies within Jakarta’s urban sprawl and is home to a large number of expats due to the presence of multinational companies. In addition to its shopping malls and family-friendly attractions, Bekasi is renowned for its photogenic cascade.

Things to do in Bekasi

Experience winter in the heart of tropical Indonesia at Trans Snow World Bekasi, an alpine-themed indoor attraction that is the first of its kind in the country. Test your skills while skiing or tube riding down the park’s artificial slopes or admire the snowy landscapes from the ski lift. You can refuel throughout the day at the on-site restaurant, which serves burgers, pasta and barista-made coffee.

In the far south of Bekasi is Curug Parigi, a stunning waterfall that can be accessed along a short trail. While it’s only around two metres in height, it’s the width of the cascade that is so impressive, earning it the nickname “Mini Niagara”. Flat rocks surround the shallow waters at the base of the waterfall where you can splash around.

Combine your visit to Curug Parigi with a stop at the small but picturesque lake of Situ Rawa Gede Kota Bekasi. Several food stalls line the shores and dish up authentic Indonesian cuisine or there are gazebos if you want to bring your own picnic. Paddle boats and canoes are available for rent if you want to explore the lake at your leisure.

Getting around Bekasi

Bekasi is around 45 minutes’ drive from the centre of Jakarta and just over an hour from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, which has flights to destinations across the globe. Intercity and commuter trains stop at Bekarta Station while local buses travel throughout the city.
