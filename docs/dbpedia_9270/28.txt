Purnawarman or Purnavarman was the 5th-century king of Tarumanagara, a Hindu Indianized kingdom, located in modern-day West Java, Jakarta and Banten provinces, Indonesia.[1] Purnawarman reigned during the 5th century, and during his reign he created several stone inscriptions.

According to these inscriptions he embarked on a hydraulic project[2]: 53â€“54 and also identified himself to Vishnu, which indicates him and his kingdom were adhering to the Vishnuite faith. King Purnawarman established a new capital city for the kingdom, located somewhere near present-day Tugu (North Jakarta) or Bekasi.
