        "text": "The concept Nusantara is derived from two Sanskrit words: nusa meaning ‘island’ and antara meaning ‘in between’ or ‘including’. It made its way into old Javanese texts, where nūsāntara can be translated as ‘other islands’.This word nusantara appears in copperplate inscriptions dated 1305 and in Javanese manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.2 The best-known written document is the Pararaton, a Javanese text on the Javanese kingdoms of Singhasari and Majapahit and their mythical ancestor Ken Angrok.3 . This text reports that Gadjah Mada, the chief minister of the Majapahit Empire, swore an oath (sumpah palapa) in 1334 that he would refrain from using spices with his food until a number of kingdoms in the Nusantara on the fringes of the Majapahit Empire were subdued. My take on the transaltion is different and quite simple which I shall explain later. The term Nusantara has captured the imagination of writers, novelists, poets, and politicians in both Indonesia and British Malaya and later in Malaysia, where in 1973 the Organisasi Sasterawan Nusantara was formed, which organized its seventh congress in Singapore in 1991,14 and its thirteenth congress in Brunei Darussalam on 18 May 2015. The membership of this organization appears to be drawn from Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Indonesia. A competing organization has held several meetings in Padang, West Sumatra."
