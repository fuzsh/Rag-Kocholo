        "text": "Preface\n\nIn the Chinese Book of Sung (å®æ¸) it was described that âA certain country, written in Chinese as âåµç¾ å®åâ had ruled Java, the country had sent envoys to China three times in 430s AD, that the king of the country was usurped from his position for a while....â Ever since the record received attention in the late nineteenth century, the identity of the country had been a matter of debate among historians. Some of them assumed the country would have existed somewhere in the Malay Peninsula, but others thought it must have been in the Island of Java. In 1980, an Indonesian scholar published an idea that the name of the country which was first transliterated and read in alphabet as âHo-lo-tanâ would have corresponded to Aruteun of Ci-aruteun River in West Java. The same idea independently occurred to the present author some years later as detailed in his book, âJava Essayâ, published in 2013 and 2015 in Japanese and English.\n\nMeanwhile in West Java, several stone monuments, locally called âprasastiâ, were found piece after another in and after the mid-nineteenth century and, from the fragmental epigraphs, it was established that a kingdom named Tarmanagara had existed around the fifth century, that the kingdom was ruled by King Purnawarman at least for a certain period and that the kingâs family had worshipped Hinduism, although the whole figure of the kingdom remained obscure.\n\nWhilst no historical documents which must have been written in ancient times existed, a group of documents, which is said to have been compiled in the court of Cirebon in the late 17th century and called Naskah Wangsakerta (Wangsakerta Manuscripts), was collected in the 1970s by a member of the State Museum of West Java Province, Bandung. Although the authenticity of the documents was questioned by senior archaeologists, one of them, Pustaka Pararatwan i Bhumi Jawadwipa Parwa 1, Sargah 1 (The Book of the Stories of Kings on the Soil of Java Volume 1, Issue 1), hereinafter PPBJ 1-1, described the events in West Java from the primeval times to the period of Tarumanagara quite in detail.\n\nDuring the last decade the present author has tried to identify the Ho-lo-tan Country, translating the relevant part of the Book of Sung into Japanese and English and studying the Indonesian text of PPBJ 1-1, and has become convinced that Ho-lo-tan Country was another name of Tarumanagara, the capital of which was located on the bank of Ci-aruteun (Aruteun River) that ran, and still runs, through the present-day Desa Ciaruteun Ilir, Kecamatan Cibungbulang, Kabupaten Bogor (where the stone monuments, viz. Prasasti Ciaruteun and Prasasti Kebon Kopi, were found).\n\nManuscripts written about the results have been submitted to several history journals but rejected, if not ignored, saying that the author should consult with an expert of ancient Chinese language, the Wangsakerta Manuscripts were not approved as historical documents, etc. The academia of history and culture might be more or less exclusive and conservative, compared to that of science and technology with which the author was familiar. A professor whom he visited seemed not much interested in the work of an outsider.\n\nAlthough his own website was a possible medium, the author has thought that, if published as a book, this work may have more chances to draw the attention of those who are concerned with the subject.\n\nThree appendices, 1: The Pronunciation of Key Chinese characters ï¼å, ç¾ , å®, æ´¥, å©ï¼, 2: Hindu Calendar/Saka Calendar, and 3: Test-translation of PPBJ 1-1, Part II, have been added.\n\nAny criticism and comments are welcome.\n\nMasatoshi Iguchi\n\nTokyo, Japan.\n\nE-mail: maiguch@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: http://www.maiguch.sakura.ne.jp/\n\nMarch 2021\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe interpretation of the text in the Book of Sung was helped by Prof. Naohiro Matsunami, Department of Philosophy, Gakushuin University, Tokyo. The English translation from the Indonesian text of Pustaka Pararatwan i Bhumi Jawadwipa Parwa 1, Sargah 1 was kindly checked by Prof. Iratius Radiman, Bandung Institute of Technology.

In fact, even copies of such chronicles or books of historical interest, such as Pararaton[1], Nagarakertagama[2] and Kidung Sunda [3], written in the Majapahit Period, which are available today, were those discovered after the late nineteenth century in Bali or Lombok, where Javanese nobles had evacuated with their belongings. Such epics as the Javanese-version Ramayana, Bharatayuddha, Krsnayana, Bhomakawya (Bhomantaka) etc. composed between the ninth and twelfth century did not remain either in Java. [4] The copy of Bujangga Manik, a story of pilgrimage of a prince and monk of Pajajaran Kingdom that gives useful knowledge about the topography and the customs and manners of the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries Java was somehow taken to England and stored in a library at Oxford since 1627 or 1629 [5].\n\nIn West Java, several stone monuments, namely Prasasti Ciaruteun, Prasasti Kebon Kopi, Prasasti Jambu, Prasasti Tugu and Prasasti Cidanghiang, which bore Sanskrit phrases written in Pallava scripts, were intensively studied ever since the mid-nineteenth century, and it was established that a certain kingdom named Tarumanagara had existed around the fifth century, that the kingdom was ruled by King Purnawarman at least for a certain period and that the kingâs family had worshipped the Hinduism. From the style of scripts, the founder of the kingdom was assumed to have come from Pallava, India, and, from the distribution of these monuments, the power of the kingdom was considered to have ranged over a significantly wide area of West Java. The details will be reviewed in Chapter 2.\n\nIn China, the chronicle of every dynasty, specifically from the Former Han Dynasty (206 BC-8 AD) to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD), included the history of the countries which had contemporarily existed in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the world. In The Book of Sung (the Southern Sung Dynasty, 420-479 AD), it was recorded that a certain country, written in Chinese as âåµç¾ å®åâ, ruled the province of Java (éå©), the country sent envoys to China in 430 AD, â¦.â In the late nineteenth century this record had received the attention of G. Schlegel [6], who assumed, or âidentifiedâ in his own term, that the country which he transliterated into alphabet as Holotan or Kalatan, must have corresponded to KÄlantan or KÄ­lantan on the Malay Peninsula. The location of the country was debated thereafter by a number of scholars, somehow adopting the above transliteration, âHolotanâ or âHo-lo-tanâ, as it was. Whilst L. L. Moens [7] was of the same view as Schlegel, Paul Pelliot[8], K. A. Nilakanta Sastri[9], O.W. Wolters[10], et al. considered that Holotan would have been located in the island of Java. R. C. Majumdar[11] in particular believed that it was in West Java where Tarumanagara Kingdom prospered.\n\nA peculiar idea that Holotan Country (åµç¾ å®å) was the phonetic transcription of Sailendra was once presented by K. Iwamoto, [12] but this theory is considered of little value, firstly because no linguistic explanation was given, and secondly because the rise of the Sailendra was around the mid-eighth century (in the Central Java), whereas the records in The Book of Sung was issued in the early fifth century. Rather recently S. Suzuki [13] voiced a theory that Holotan was not in Java Island but Kelantan on Malay Peninsula, without referring to Schlegelâs and Moensâs papers, and that the Malayan country had ruled a part of Java, asserting that Java at that time had not been civilised enough to be able to send missions to China, whether an audience would lend his/her ear or not.\n\nTo what extent these authors looked into the relevant Chinese text in The Book of Sung is unknown, except for Schlegel [14] who gave a short abridged translation (ca. 90 characters from ca. 945 characters).\n\nIn any case, the origin of the country does not seem to have been determined so far.\n\nIn an essay published in 2013/2015 [15], the present author has assumed that the three Chinese characters for the countryâs name (åµç¾ å®), originally transliterated as Ho-lo-tan, could alternatively be read as âA-ro-tanâ and that the A-ro-tan Country was the representation of Tarumanagara by the name of its capital which would have existed at least for a period around the present-day Ciaruteun Ilir Village (Ilir = downstream), where Prasasti Ciaruteun and Prasasti Kebon Kopi were found. In the same essay, he also reported for the first time on two other stone relics, i.e., a game arena situated on the ground and a score of foundation stones for pillars of a large building, possibly a palace or a pavilion, allegedly of the Tarumanagara age.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that a theory to regard Holotan as Aruteun had been published earlier by Slamet Muljana in 1980 [16] a few years before the same idea occurred to the present author. The existence of the rather rare book came to notice to the present author in a later year in a local bookstore in Bogor. It was the time when Internet search was yet to be available. The details of the theory will be discussed in Chapter 3.\n\nAlthough no contemporary documents other than those on stone inscriptions remained, the history of ancient times from prehistoric times down to the New Mataram Era was recorded in the so-called Naskah Wangsakerta (Wangsakerta Manuscripts), which are said to have been compiled in the 17th century in Cirebon by Pangeran Wangsakerta (Prince Wangsakerta) and his committee members, assembling old fragmental records and oral traditions.\n\nThe manuscripts were elaborately collected by Drs. Atja in the 1970s and intensively studied by Dr. Edi S. Ekadjati,[17] Dr. Ayatrohaedi[18] et al. Sejarah Bogor (A History of Bogor), authored 1983 by Drs. Saleh Danasasmita[19], was one of the earliest publications in which knowledge from the stone inscriptions were complemented and the genealogic relationships between kings and lords analysed.\n\nMeanwhile, the authenticity of the Wangsakerta Manuscript, whether the contents were not fake, was argued after the 1980s by senior archaeologists, viz. Dr. Boechari[20], Prof. R. Soekmono[21], Prof. R. P. Soejono [22], et al., who suspected they were not written by Prince Wangsakerta and his team in the 17th century but were fabricated by someone in the early 1960s after the publication of Prasasti Indonesia II by Prof. J. G. de Casparis in1956[23]. Even the existence of Prince Wangsakerta was questioned. The fact that the manuscripts gathered were not the originals but copies was also reason for dissatisfaction.\n\nThese criticisms were countered by Drs. Atja[24], Dr. Ayatrohaedi[25], Prof. Edi S. Ekadjati[26], Prof. Nina, H. Lubis[27], et al., verifying that the Prince Wangsakerta was a real character and that his purpose was basically to âreproduceâ the history, as such deeds were undertaken in the East and Central Java and elsewhere in the world. It was also claimed that the availability of old documents only in the form of the copy of copy was common elsewhere. Assuming that Wangsakerta Manuscripts were created by some other person, a question would remain on why the writer had a reason not to publish the works of more than 50 volumes, each consisting of 150 to 280 pages, by his/her own name.\n\nMost relevant articles have been compiled in Polemik Naskah Pangeran Wangsakerta[28]. As a whole, the present author had an impression that negative opinions were more or less conservative and fundamentalistic. The descriptions about Tarumanagara Kingdom in Pustaka Pararatwan i Bhumi Jawadwipa Parwa 1, Sargah 1 (lit. The Book of the Stories of Kings on the Soil of Java Volume 1, Issue 1)[29], hereinafter PPBJ 1-1, at least, seems to be informative, as will be discussed in Chapter 4.\n\nIn this book, after reviewing the contents of stone monuments of the Tarumanagara Era and carefully examining and translating the text in The Book of Sung (å®æ¸), the abovementioned assumption that the Holotan Country (åµç¾ å®å) would have been a synonym of Tarumanagara will be discussed in comparison with relevant descriptions in the Wangsakerta Manuscripts, namely PPBJ 1-1.\n\nChapter 2\n\nInscriptions on the prasasti of Tarumanagara era and notes on stone relics in Aruteun village\n\nSeven stone monuments are known today. Although the results of transliteration and translation of the epigraphs as well as their origin and features of the monuments have been given in various publications [30], let us briefly review them herewith, adding some comments, for the sake of facilitating later discussion.\n\nFigure 1 shows the location of stone inscriptions, as well as temples, riverwork sites and capitals, in Tarumanagara Era.\n\n(1) Prasasti Ciaruteun\n\nThis stone monument was found in a riverbed of Ciaruteun (Aruteun River) in Desa Ciaruteun Ilir, Kecamatan Cibungbulang, Kabupaten Bogor in the 1860s. It was a round natural rock of about 2.2 metres wide and 1.4 metres high, on the surface of which were carved a pair of human footprints and some symbolic letters (Figure 2). The symbols inscribed were similar to those used in the Pallava Empire which prospered in India in the fourth-fifth centuries and used Sanskrit as their language. The large symbols on the right-hand side of the footprints were decoded in the early days as âThe King Purnawarman of Tarumanagaraâ, and the strings of small symbols on the left-hand side were deciphered in the 1920s. In English, it said:\n\nThis suggested that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara was regarded and respected as the incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu, or an existence with a similar divinity.\n\nFigure 2 Prasasti Ciaruteun and the epigraphs on it. Photographed by M. Iguchi, September 2006.\n\n(2) Prasasti Kebon Kopi\n\nThis stone monument found in a coffee plantation, not far from Prasasti Ciaruteun, and reported also in the 1860s (Figure 3) is alternatively called âPrasasti Telapak Gajahâ because a pair of elephantâs footprints are carved on it. The Sanskrit text inscribed between the two elephantâs footprints said:\n\nSince Airawata was the white elephant that was the vehicle of Indra, the God of War,[33] the king and his family is supposed to have believed in the Hinduism. Since endemic Javan elephants (Elephas hysudrindicus) had become extinct before the historical time[34], the elephants are supposed to have been brought from Sumatra or the Asian continent by the king and his followers.\n\nFigure 3 Prasasti Kebon Kopi and the epigraphs on it. Photographed by M. Iguchi, September 2006.\n\n(3) Prasasti Jambu\n\nThis rock inscription, also called âPrasasti Pasir Koleangkakâ which existed on a hillock named Pasir Koleangkak, in Kebun Jambu [35], Desa Parakanmuncang, Kecamatan Nanggung, about 30 km to the west of Bogor, was known since the 1850s. A two-line Sanskrit verse was read as:\n\nThis stone monument is considered to have been erected after Purnawarmanâs death as a eulogy to record that Purnawarman was an excellent warrior.\n\n(4) Prasasti Tugu\n\nThis stone monument (Figure 4) had formerly exposed only 10 cm of its head on the ground, near the coast to the east of Tanjung Priok, in Desa Tugu, Kecamatan Koja, North Jakarta. Local people offered flowers and burnt incense in its side. When dug out in 1879, it was revealed that it was a round-triangular or egg-shaped stone of about one metre height and that on the surface of it was an epigraph of a five-line, 100-word poem recording the riverworks conducted during the time of King Purnawarman. It was translated as follows:\n\nFigure 4 Prasasti Tugu (Replica), Jakarta History Museum (photographed with permission by. M. Iguchi, September 2006) and a part of epigraphs on it (duplicated from Bosch, F. D. K.: Selected Studies in Indonesian Archaeology, The Hague Martinus Nijhoff, 1961).\n\nThis description is ambiguous in some parts. Firstly, although Candrabhaga and Gomati were probably named after the rivers that had existed in India, it was not sure to which rivers in West Java they actually corresponded. Assuming that the stone inscription was placed at the site of the riverworks, Candrabhaga was regarded as the present-day Bekasi River, and the river name was interpreted to have derived as:\n\ncandrabhaga â sesibhaga â bhagasasi â bagasi â bekasi,\n\nby R. M. Ng. Poerbatjaraka [38], whereas the fact that the location of the stone inscription was closer to the Cikajang River was pointed out.[39] Secondly, it was doubted whether it was possible to dig a river or a canal of such a length as 6,122 dhanus, which is assumed to be 7 miles (11.3 km) or 12 miles (22.9 km) within a matter of twenty-one days [40]. The year of the work was not written. Thirdly, the relationship of Purnawarman to âthe king of kingsâ or the Grand-father and the Royal Sage was obscure. [41] Notwithstanding, the records suggested that the rulers such as Purnawarman had made efforts to manage rivers in West Java which often flood even today, and that Tarumanagara ruled the area as a solid settlement.\n\n(5) Prasasti Cidanghiang\n\nThis stone monument, often called âPrasasti Lebakâ or âPrasasti Munjulâ, was found in 1947 on the edge of Cidanghiang River, in Desa Lebak, Kecamatan Munjul, Kabupaten Pandeglang, Banten. The two-line inscription on it was deciphered and translated in the 1960s as:\n\nor\n\nThe content was another homage to King Purnawarman but the fact that this stone inscription was located far away from others manifested that the power of Tarumanagara had ranged over a wide area of West Java. In respect to this inscription an interesting comment is found in an article [44] that can be paraphrased as âBefore our ancestors got the guidance of the Islamic Almighty God, they needed a person, king, community chief or whosoever, who gave guidance for their lifeâ. To the authorâs understanding, this is still true today particularly among average people in the island of Java.\n\n(6) Prasasti Muara Cianten\n\nThis rock inscription (shown in Figure 5) was found in the 1860s in the riverbed of Cisadane River near the junction point of the tributary Cianten River, as âmuaraâ meant river end, in Kecamatan Cibungbulang, Bogor, not far from Desa Ciaruteun Ilir where Prasasti Ciaruteun and Prasasti Kebon Kopi were found. Besides some botanical ornaments which look like runners protruding out of tubers, some curly symbols are sculptured, but what they mean has not been clarified. [45]\n\nFigure 5 Prasasti Muara Cianten. Photographed by. M. Iguchi, February 2015.\n\n(7) Prasasti Pasir Awi\n\nThis inscription was found in the 1860s in the Cipamingkis forest on the southern slope of the Pasir Awi Hill in Desa Sukamakmur, Kecamatan Sukamakmur, Bogor. On the surface were carved a pair of footprints and some curly patterns. The latter could be some letters but not be deciphered. [46]\n\nIn summary, it was proved from these seven inscriptions that:\n\n(i) A certain kingdom named Tarumanagara had existed around the fifth century in West Java.\n\n(ii) The kingdom was ruled by King Purnawarman (at least for a period).\n\n(iii) The kingâs family had worshipped the Hindu gods, viz. Vishnu and Indra.\n\n(iv) The founder of the kingdom is supposed to have come from Pallava, India, from the style of the script.\n\n(v) The rulers made efforts to manage rivers in their territory.\n\n(vi) The power of Tarumanagara ranged over a significantly wide area of West Java.\n\nNevertheless, the following points remained questionable.\n\n(i) The relationship of Purnawarman to âthe king of kingsâ or the Grand-father and the Royal Sage are obscure.\n\n(ii) The identity of the Candrabhaga and Gomati rivers is not certain.\n\nBesides the abovementioned seven stone monuments, one more monument, called âPrasasti Pasir Muaraâ, was found in Ciaruteun Ilir Village in the nineteenth century and said to have been somehow lost in the 1940s. The text written with Kawi script in Old Malay was deciphered by F. D. K. Bosch [47] as,\n\nAlthough in the normal manner the three figures of the year should be read from the right to the left as 458 Saka, Bosch put them the other way round as 854 Saka (932 AD), because the year, 458 Saka, was too early for the use of the Malay language. Thus, this inscription was not included in the monuments of Tarumanagara Era.\n\n(8) Congklak arena and large foundation stones in the Aruteun Village\n\nAs briefly mentioned above, when the present author visited Aruteun village, the caretaker of the archaeological site guided him to a spot, not far from the places of Prasasti Ciaruteun and Prasasti Kebon Kopi, where five pieces of stone of some half a metre diameter remained. Two of them embedded in the ground had semi-spherical holes of 6â7 cm diameter on the flat surface, about twenty together (Figure 6). As his friend admired, it must be an arena of a game called âcongklakâ in Sundanese, alternatively called âdakonâ in Javanese or âmancalaâ in Europe, which is still popular today among children in Indonesia as a table-top intellectual game. Although different theories say that the origin of the game was not in India but somewhere in Arab or Africa, it is certain that the game was introduced into this site by the immigrants from India who founded Tarumanagara. It was amusing to imagine that ancient people were playing the game around these stones.\n\nThe caretaker also showed us several pieces of granite blocks of about 50-cm cubic shape, with a hollow of about 40 cm square and 5 cm depth on one of their surfaces, having been collected and laid under the eaves of his house (Figure 7). Several more pieces were found scattered in a near-by banana field. The stone blocks must have been the foundation stones of a building and, judging from the size of pillars to fit the square hollow, the building is considered to have been a big palace or pavilion of King Purnawarman which had stood at that site.\n\nFigure 6 Play arena of congklak in the Aruteun Village.

Prepared on the Google Map.\n\nBefore ending this chapter, let us focus on a small area, shown in Figure 8, where Ciaruteun and Cianten Rivers merge to Cisadane River, in which five Tarumanagara relics, i.e., Prasasti Ciaruteun, Prasasti Kebon Kopi, Prasasti Muara Cianten, congklak arena and foundation stone blocks, remain. This area is supposed to have been the centre of Tarumanagara Kingdom for a certain period, as will be discussed in the next chapter.\n\nChapter 3\n\nFull translation of the records on the âHolotan Countryâ in The Book of Sung\n\nIn common with other old books, The Book of Sung (Sun Shu, Vol.97, Biography Series 57, Barbarians å®æ¸å·97, åå³ç¬¬57, å¤·è ») [49] was written with no punctuations and brackets. The source text [50] comprised 776 characters to which 169 punctuations and brackets were added by the editor. For convenience, the text was divided into 8 paragraphs as below.\n\nParagraph 1 described the governance of the country.\n\n(1)\n\nåµç¾ å®åæ²»éå©æ´²ã\n\nAruteun Country rules the province of Java.\n\nThe reason to read the countyâs name, åµç¾ å®, as âA-ro-tanâ and regard it as the transliteration of âAruteunâ, was hinted by a Chinese descent in Jakarta, an acquaintance of the present author, who was not a linguist but talented in language. When questioned, she answered that the original sound for the name would have been âa-lo-tanâ, or possibly âa-ro-tanâ. The ambiguity is ascribed to the fact that, although the middle character, ç¾ , is usually pronounced as âloâ or âluÃ³â, it is also applied to the sound of âroâ in the words of foreign origin, e.g., ç¾ é¦¬ (Rome), æ­ç¾ å·´ (Eu rope) etc. Then, an idea that the three Chinese characters must be the transcription of âAruteunâ of Ci-Aruteun (Aruteun River), where the Prasasti Ciaruteun and the Prasasti of Kebon Kopi were found, flashed into the present authorâs mind.\n\nPerhaps the sound of the first character, åµ, is controversial. Although âhoâ seems to be common for idioms in the Wage-Giles system as actually adopted for transcribing the countryâs name as âHolotanâ, the basic sound was âaâ or âÄâ and used for such words of foreign origin as âa cha chiaâ for åµåè¿¦ (Skt. hÄá¹­aka), âa lo loâ for åµç¾ ç¾ (Skt. Atata, the third of the eight cold hells), etc. The third (last) character, å®, has no other choices but âtangâ in Wage-Giles and âdanâ in Mandarin. [51]\n\nLet us also examine the province name, éå©, which was traditionally transcribed in alphabet as âShe-poâ. Although the first character is usually pronounced as âsheâ or âtuâ, it is also of use for âjaâ for Sanskrit words, such as yojana (è¸°éé£, length unit, ca. 7 km), JÄtaka (ééè¿¦, stories of previous life), etc. The common sound of the second character, å©, is âpoâ but the character is also used for âvaâ as in the Sanskrit words, âShiva (æ¿å©)â, âDeva (æ å©)â, etc. More examples are shown in Appendix 1.\n\nThe theory of Muljana[52], mentioned above, was obtained in a different way, as he emphasised, from âtoponymâ or the study of the name of places derived from topographical features.\n\n(1) In West Java, there are many places named Ciliwung, Cisadane, Citarum etc. which bear prefix, âCi-â, meaning water.\n\n(2) A kingdom located close to the sea at the mouth of a river was often called by the name of the port.\n\n(3) Fifteen centuries ago, when the alluvial sediment of Cisadane was far less than today, the river is supposed to have had a long estuary and a port existed at the upper end, near the present-day Ciaruteun Ilir, where Ciaruteun River joins Cisadane River.\n\nAs to the backword transliteration of âHolotanâ to Aruteun, the author just mentioned that âHolotan and Aruteun show a very similar soundâ. [53]\n\nWith regard to Cisadane River, although whether the estuary had ranged up to the present-day Ciaruteun Ilir is uncertain, it must have been the sole waterway for transportation from this point to the Java Sea, as still is. Figure 9 is a raft seen in a recent year near the river junction.\n\nFigure 9 A raft in Cisadane River near the junction point of Cianten River seen from the top of Muara Cianten rock. Photographed by M. Iguchi, January 2015.\n\nFigure 10 shows the alluvial sedimentation around the Jakarta Plain, a work by H. Th. Verstappen.[54] According to the Google Earth, the height of the riverbed of the Ciaruteunâs downstream is ca. +95 metres above sea level. It must have been lower than that in the Tarumanagara Era.\n\nFigure 10 Alluvial sedimentation around the Jakarta Plain toword Jakarta Bay. Original map by H. Th.

Redrawn on CorelDRAW and the location of Ciaruteun Ilir has been added, Cisadane, Ciaruteun and Cianten Rivers shown in blue by the Author.\n\nMuljana further claimed that âAruteun Kingdom was the first ever kingdom existed in Java Island before Tarumanagaraâ and that âthe kingdom was conquered or subordinated by Purnawarman of Tarumanagaraâ. These claims are not appropriate, if referred to the Wangsakerta Manuscript which described that Salakanagara was the first kingdom founded in West Java and that the kingdom was passed down to Jayasinghawarman who married to the daughter of the last king of Salakanagara, Dewawarman VIII, and established Tarumanagara. Purnawarman was a son of Jayasinghawarman (See, Chapter 4).\n\nBack to The Book of Sung, Paragraph 2 described the sending of a mission to China in 430 AD and the list of tributes.\n\nAmong the listed tributes, the gold ring might have been a native product from Java but the red parrots were allegedly the species captured somewhere in Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Islands beyond Bali, in the eastern side of the Wallace Line) or their offspring. This suggests that the country had interaction with such remote areas. The cotton fabrics from Tianzhu and Kasyapa imply that the country had trade relations with India.\n\nParagraph 3 recorded a letter from the king of Aruteun submitted probably by a messenger in the 10th year of Yuanjia (å å), 433AD. The letter was a long one in which as many as 234 characters were spent for the homage to the Chinese emperor, who is identified as Emperor Wen (æå¸, reigned 424-453 AD) of Liu Sung (åå®).\n\n(3-2) æä¾æ­£è¦º, éºå½¢èå©, é è«¸å¡å, èå´åå, å¦é å½å±±, æéèè½, æ¬¡ç¬¬ç¾ å, åé­é¤¨å®, å¦å¿å©å¤©å®®, å®®æ®¿é«å»£, æ¨é£èå´, åå µå ·è¶³, è½ä¼æ¨æµ, ååè±æ¨, ç¡è«¸æ£é£ã With the bones of truly enlightened Arhat, towers are built and statues are sculptured so that the land of the country is glorious.

The fact that great many phrases were cited from Buddhist sutras suggests that the king of Java and probably his guru were well versed in Buddhist philosophy despite the fact that their religion was Hinduism, even if the fact that the Buddhism had hierarchically derived from the Hinduism is taken into account. For writing Chinese, they would have received assistance from the ambassador from China stationed at their capital.\n\nParagraph 4 wrote about an incident, a coup to usurp the throne.\n\nParagraph 5 recorded another long letter of 390 characters from King Wisnuwarman sent to China in the 13th year of Yuanjia (å å), 436 AD. After a long homage, the king wrote that he had lost his position by the coup dâÃ©tat but had a strong will to revenge and that he wished the Emperor would help his retainer, dispatched to Liu Sung, with purchasing necessary things and returning home safe.\n\nThis coup dâÃ©tat might correspond to an incident described in the Wangsakerta Document, as will be mentioned in Chapter 4.\n\nParagraph 6 wrote the arrival of another envoy.\n\nThis implies that the king had recovered his position, as actually had, as written in PPBJ 1-1.\n\nParagraph 7 recorded a decree of the Emperor Wen issued in 449 AD.\n\nIn this paragraph, in the names of three countries, the first Chinese character of the first country, Holotan, è¨¶, was different from that appeared in Paragraph 1, åµ of åµç¾ å®. John Guy [56] assumed that the set of three countries, è¨¶ç¾ å®, åª»ç and åª»é, read as Kelantan, Pahang and Perak, respectively, were the countries that had coexisted in the Malay Peninsula. An Internet article by Koji Sato [57] speculated that the three countries were located in the present-day Viet Nam.\n\nThus, the present author would assume that the above paragraph had nothing to do with the âHolotanâ country in Java, having been erroneously incorporated from some source material during the compilation of The Book of Sung.\n\nThe last Paragraph 8 recorded another visit of the envoy.\n\nIt is not sure either whether this content was concerned with Tarumanagara.\n\nFor reference, the summary of the record on the âHolotan Countryâ is included in Nanshi (åå², The History of South Dynasty), compiled by Li Yanshou æå»¶å£½ and published in 659 AD in the Tang Dynasty Era, specifically in Vol. 78, Biography Series 68, Surrounding Barbarian 1/2, Maritime Countries [58].\n\n(1)\n\nåµç¾ å®åé½éå©æ´²ã\n\n(2)\n\nå åä¸å¹´ï¼é£ä½¿ç»éåæç°ãèµ¤é¸éµ¡é³¥ãå¤©ç«ºåç½çãå¤è²ãèæ³¢åå¤è²ç­ç©ã\n\n(3-1)\n\nåå¹´ï¼åµç¾ å®åçæ¯æ²è·æ©å¥è¡¨æ°ï¼\n\nå¸¸åå¤©å­éä¸ï¼è«¸ä½ä¸å°ï¼å¸¸æ¨å®é±ï¼ä¸éå ­éï¼ç²ä¸éå°ï¼æ¯åå¦ä¾ï¼\n\n(3-2)\n\nã»ã»ã»æ¯æ è³èª äºé«æ¬ç¦®ã\n\n(4)\n\nå ¶å¾ç²å­æç¯¡å¥ªã\n\n(5-1)\n\nåä¸å¹´ï¼åä¸è¡¨ã\n\n(5-2)\n\nã»ã»ã»\n\n(6)\n\nã»ã»ã»\n\n(7-1)\n\näºåå ­å¹´ï¼æå¸è©æ°ï¼ãåµç¾ å®ãå©çãå©éä¸åï¼é »è¶éæµ·ï¼æ¬µåç´è²¢ï¼é èª å®çï¼å¯ä¸¦å é¤æããä¹é£ä½¿ç­å½ä¹ã\n\n(7-2)\n\nã»ã»ã»\n\n(8)\n\näºåä¹å¹´ï¼åé£é·å²å©åæ²å½ç»æ¹ç©ã\n\nIn this summary, the fifth character (æ²», rule, govern) in the Paragraph 1 of the Book of Sung was replaced with a different character (é½, capital city), so as âAruteun Country is the capital of the province of Javaâ, instead of âAruteun Country rules the province of Javaâ, although the meanings of the two sentences were virtually the same.\n\nThe Paragraph 3-2 was shortened and Paragraphs 5-2, 6 and 7-2 were omitted, whether the compiler had carefully examined and judged the contents extraneous.\n\nAs a record of contemporary Java, a passage in A Record of the Buddhist Countries (ä½åè¨) or The life of Faxian (æ³é¡¯å³) is well known. In 414 AD, a Buddhist priest, Fa Xian (or Fa Hsien, æ³é¡¯), from the Eastern Chin (Jin) Dynasty (æ±æ), arrived, after a hard voyage of ninety days, in Javadvipa (lit. Java Island) on his way back to China from Ceylon and stayed there for five months. He wrote:\n\nAlthough the name of the kingdom was not explicitly given, the country has been widely accepted as Tarumanagara. âPaganism (å¤é)â in this passage must have meant the ancestor worshipping of the native Sundanese inhabitants. [60] The word âBrahmanismâ was commonly used in China as a synonym of what is broadly called âHinduismâ. Then, this description agrees with the aforementioned assumption derived from the stone inscriptions that the immigrants were âHinduâ worshippers.\n\nChapter 4\n\nRelating descriptions in the Pustaka Pararatwan i Bhumi Jawadwipa\n\n(1) A brief note on the document\n\nThe PPBJ 1 covered the chronicles of many countries or kingdoms which rose and fell in Java Island from ancient times to the establishment of New Mataram in the late 16th century. Amongst, PPBJ 1-1 wrote about the rulers and their genealogy as well as the events and achievements in the period from the beginning of Salakanagara to the era of the fourth king of Tarumanagara, Wisnuwarman, preceded by the introduction and the prehistory of primeval times. Leaving aside the argument about the authenticity mentioned in the Introduction (Chapter 1), the data included in the manuscript is considered useful for supplement the knowledge from the stone inscriptions and The Book of Sung, as partly done by Danasasmita [61] for the former.\n\nThe book referred to[62] in this work consisted of three chapters:\n\nChapter I: Introduction,\n\nChapter II: The text summary,\n\nChapter III: Transliteration and Translation of the original text.\n\nThe second chapter was easy to follow, as the contents of the original text, which were inconsistent in some parts and contained redundant expressions, have been digested and orderly rewritten by the translators, but the unabridged, word-for-word text in the third chapter was also referred to. The test-translation of Chapter II from Indonesian to English is given in Appendix 2.\n\n(2) The founding and the genealogy of Salakanagara and Tarumanagara\n\nThe main part of PPBJ 1-1 commenced with the founding of Salakanagara, the first country that had existed on the soil of Java Island before Tarumanagara.\n\nIt was additionally said that a son of Dewawarman VIII became the crown prince and, after his fatherâs death, became the king of Salakanagara, but his territory was under the command of Tarumanagara, a new kingdom established in 270 Saka (348 AD) by Jayasinghawarman who came from Salankayana and married the daughter of Dewawarman VIII, named Dewi Minawati.\n\nIt ought to be noted that a contemporary record in The Book of Later Han (å¾æ¼¢æ¸) has been argued ever since the early twentieth century. In the Biography Series 76: South Barbarian - Southwest Province, it was written,\n\nIn this line, Ye-bian (èèª¿) and Bian (ä¾¿) were interpreted by G. Ferrand [64] as Jawadwipa (Skt. Yava-dvipa) and Warman (Skt. Varman, =Dewawarman), respectively. According to Tomonobu Kurihara [65], the first character (èª¿) of Diao-bian (èª¿ä¾¿) could be regarded as a sort of âextraneous characterâ, so that the emperor gave the items to âthe messengerâ. In any case, if Ye-bian was the transliteration of Jawadwipa, then it is highly possible that the country was Salakanagara, because no established kingdom had existed in the early second century Java.\n\n(3) The kings in the early Tarumanagara Period\n\nAs mentioned above, Tarumanagara was founded in 270 Saka (348 AD) by Jayasinghawarman who arrived from Salankayana and married the daughter of Dewawarman VIII of Salakanagara. His kingdom was initially a small village but grew to a significant size. The capital named Jayasinghapura is allegedly the origin of the present-day Jasinga, located about 45 km to the west of Bogor. [66] He was famous as âThe Sage of the House of Ghomati (Sang Lumah ri Ghomati)â. He reigned until 304 Saka (382 AD).\n\nPurnawarman, whose name appeared in the stone inscriptions, was a great king who subjugated or conquered regional kings around West Java and expanded the territory of Tarumanagara to such an extent as judged from the locations of the discovered stone inscriptions (Figure 1). The Empress of Purnawarman was a princess of Swarnabhumi (Thailand), whereas other consorts were from Bakulapura (East Kalimantan) and Central Java. From the empress was born the crown prince named Wisnuwarman. The younger sister of Purnawarman, named Harinawarmandewi, became the wife of a rich man of Bharatanagari (India). He had a younger brother, Mandala-Minister Cakrawarman, who became the warlord and, after the throne was succeeded from Purnawarman to Wisnuwarman, attempted a coup dâÃ©tat to become the King of Tarumanagara. This coup dâÃ©tat must correspond to the record in The Book of Sung.\n\nDuring his reign, Purnawarman made efforts to establish friendly relations with foreign countries, performed a number of riverworks, built two temples and edited many books, as will be mentioned below. His reign ended in 356 Saka (434 AD) and his throne was succeeded by his son, Wisnuwarman. He was called the Lord in âThe Abode of Taruma River (Yang Bersemayam di Sungai Taruma)â.\n\nWisnuwarman, the fourth king of Tarumanagara, was the person who sent envoys at least twice to China. His seat was once seized by his uncle, Cakrawarman, but the treason was settled after a while. He married Princess Dewi Suklawati of the king of Indraprahasta (a subkingdom) who captured the rebel, as his first empress had already passed away. The incident will be mentioned below. He was succeeded by his son, Indrawarman, in 377 Saka (455 AD).\n\nFigure 11 shows the genealogy of kings and their family members in Salakanagara and Tarumanagara covered by PPBJ I-1. The list of all kingdoms that had existed in West Java was given with reference also to other sources by Danasasmita.[67]\n\nFigure 11 The genealogy of kings and their family members in Salakanagara and Tarumanagara covered by PPBJ I-1.\n\nNow let us pick up some topics from the PPBJ 1-1 and discuss.\n\n(4) Purnawarmanâs personality and his capital\n\nAs a warlord, Purnawarman was portrayed in the PPBJ 1-1 as follows.\n\nWith regard to the location of the capital, an interesting passage is found.\n\nAlthough âoutsideâ in the first clause is implicit, the subsequent clause strongly suggests that the capital was âAruteunâ on the bank of Ciaruteun where the Prasasti Ciaruteun would have originally existed, though it was actually discovered in the riverbed and moved above the bluff in 1980s [68].\n\nThe above passage was followed by a line,\n\nThis suggests that the large foundation stones that remained near the Prasasti Ciaruteun, mentioned above, were of use for the palace built by Purnawarman. The previous capital which Purnawarman moved from, is supposed to have been Jayasinghapura where his grandfather, Jayasinghawarman, had founded Tarumanagara.\n\nIn a later paragraph, the text said that\n\nFigure 12 shows the image of flags with the symbol of Airawata in the modern kingdoms of Siam and Laos.\n\nFigure 12 Royal standards of modern kingdoms with the symbol of Airawata. Left: Siam 1855-1891 (Rama IV), Right: Laos 1952-75. Both from: Wikimedia Commons.\n\nThe above paragraph suggests that Purnawarman moved the capital again. The phrase, âthe capital city of Sundapura on the bank of Ghomati Riverâ is worth paying attention to. If the Prasasti Tugu in which the name of Gomati (Ghomati) River appeared was placed not far from the site of the riverwork, then the location of Sundapura would have been around the present-day Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta. The centre of Sundapura is supposed to have shifted due to the change of the coastline [70] and developed into Sunda Kelapa, the main port town of the Pajajaran Kingdom which was occupied and renamed as Jayakarta by Moslems in 1526-7 AD and subsequently became the nucleolus of the Dutch Batavia (Jakarta) constructed in 1621.\n\nIt is considered that Purnawarman had decided to build the new capital Sundapura at the coast of the bay for the sake of convenience of sea trading, as his kingdom had become solid and safe, whilst the previous capitals at Jayasinghapura and Aruteun, both located at the confluence of rivers in mountainous areas, were advantageous from the defensive point of view. For the environment of Aruteun, see Figure 8.\n\n(5) The Religion\n\nA passage in the PPBJ 1-1 said that Dharmayawarman tried hard to teach their religion (Hinduism) to the native inhabitants but many of those who adhered to believe in their ancestors were not easily taught and consequently the natives were divided into four caste groups, i.e., Bhrahmana, Kastryah, Waisya and Sudra, in which the lowest one was the majority. In another passage it was written that\n\nThese descriptions about the religious situation coincide with the aforementioned comment in A Record of the Buddhist Countries (ä½åè¨) that âIn this country, the paganism and Hinduism flourish but Buddhist dharma is trifling.â\n\nThe fact that Purnawarman worshiped Wisnu was proved in the epigraphs of Prasasti Ciaruteun which said that âthe pair of footprints like unto Vishnuâs are Purnawarmanâsâ. In the PPBJ 1-1 it is also written that all participants in the banquet organised on the occasion of the ceremony of honour praised Purnawarman and his queen, as if they were God Wisnu, (the supreme lord in the Vaishnavism) and Goddess Laksmi (the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity), respectively.\n\n(6) Riverworks and monuments\n\nEver since ancient times the control of river water and the irrigation of the field have been big issues, namely in West Java, one of the most pluvial areas in Java Island or in the world.\n\nWith regard to the riverworks at Candrabhaga and Ghomati Rivers, it was described in the PPBJ 1-1 as follows.\n\nIt is quite stunning that the dates of both starting and finishing of the work, as well as the number of immolated cows, exactly coincide with those written on the Prasasti Tugu. Then, the year of the work which was not inscribed on the Prasasti Tugu is considered to have been 339 Saka (417 AD). Now it is almost certain that âthe king of kingsâ and âthe Grand-fatherâ in the Prasasti Tugu would have denoted Jayasinghawarman. âThe Royal Sageâ is still uncertain but the person would have been Dharmayawarman who was a devout religious teacher. The above description was preceded by a description that\n\nThis corresponds to the first verse of the Tugu Inscription. Although the work period, 21 days seems to be very short to dig such a long canal of over 11 km, the work could have been done because the work at Candrabhaga River was just for repairing and also because the whole work was incessantly conducted day and night by concentrating such a great number of labourers, as much as several thousands. If one assumes that 5,000 labourers had engaged for the work of 11 km, the section of the bank per person was only 2.2 m in average.\n\nLet us see the description of the riverwork at Sarasah River [71].\n\nThe statue is said of Wisnuâs in this case but supposed to have been the image of Purnawarman. The farmland created by riverworks is considered to have been provided with a drainage and irrigation system for agriculture. With respect to the Prasasti Tugu, it was concluded [72] that âthe canals described were excavated in order to control the flooding of the river in the port area, rather than for the purpose of irrigation, as had been suggested by George Coedes [73] and othersâ but this was not the case at least at the Sarasah River.\n\nIn addition to the abovementioned river sites, Purnawarman conducted riverworks at three more sites. The name of the rivers and the year of the work were as follows.\n\nGhangga River in Indraprahasta [74] 332 Saka (410 AD),\n\nCupu River in Cupunagara [75] 334 Saka (412 AD).\n\nCitarum [76] 341 Saka (419 AD).\n\nFor the riverwork at these remote places in subkingdoms, Purnawarman sent a large number of labourers from the central kingdom. After the completion of the works, a thanks-giving ritual and a banquet were held as usual and monuments were erected.\n\nThe description that Purnawarman erected a statue of himself, as well as stone inscriptions, in multiple places (at the sites of Candrabhaga/ Ghomati Rivers, Sarasah River and other villages) is noteworthy. Although the two statues found in the Cibuaya Site were named as Arca Wisnu Cibuaya I and II, their photographs (Figure 13 (1) and (2)) give an impression that they were modelled after an armoured warlord, presumably Sang Purnawarman himself, who as aforementioned always wore iron armour. The age of the making of the two statues, assumed as the fifth or sixth century from the archaeologically aspect [77], is not much different from the time of Purnawarmanâs reign, 317-356 Saka (395-434 AD). The Wisnu statues from Cibuaya, Figure 13 (1) and (2), are quite in contrast with the hallowed image of other rulers, e.g., the statue of King Airlangga of Kediri (3), who was also believed as the incarnation of Wisnu and that of King Kertarajasa (Raden Wijaya) of Majapahit (4), who was simulated to Harihara, a deity of half Shiva and half Vishnu.\n\nFigure 13 (1) and (2) Arca Wisnu Cibuaya I and II (photographed with permission at Museum Nasional Indonesia by. M. Iguchi, June 2019), (3) Statue of King Airlangga of Kediri (duplicated from https://alchetron.com/Airlangga), (4) Statue of King Kertarajasa (Raden Wijaya) of Majapahit found at Candi Sumberjati, Blitar (Duplicated from http://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/...)\n\n(7) Temples\n\nWhile Rajarsi (Dharmayawarman), the father of Purnawarman, retired and lived two years in hermitage before he died, Purnawarman made an inscription on a stone column, built a temple for Rajarsi on the bank of Candrabhaga River and another temple for Rajadhirajaghuru (Jayasinghawarman), the grandfather, on the bank of Ghomati River.\n\nIt was quite new at least to the present author that Purnawarman had constructed temples. From the above description, it is obvious that the temples on the bank of Candrabhaga and Ghomati Rivers had given the honourable names, âThe Sage of the House of Candrabhagaâ and âThe Sage of the House of Ghomatiâ, for his father and grandfather, respectively. The year of the construction of the temples was not written but the year for the first one at Candrabhaga, at least, is assumed to have been between 317-319 Saka (395-397 AD).\n\nThese temples, however, are considered to be different from those discovered at the sites of Batujaya and Cibuaya located to the north of the present-day Karawan.\n\nBesides the two temples at the banks of Candrabhaga and Ghomati Rivers, a passage which was grammatically inconsistent, but could be interpreted as follows, was found.\n\nDewawarman VIII of Salakanagara (reigned 270-285 Saka or 348-363 AD) built a temple (or temples) and installed the statues of Siwa and Wisnu,\n\nThis suggests that some temples had been built and statues, installed already in the third century during the Salakanagara Era.\n\n(8) Diplomatic relations with China and other countries\n\nIn PPBJ 1-1, it was written that\n\nPurnawarman fostered equal, friendly relationship with China, Cambay in Bharatawarsa [India], Yawana [East India], Bakulapura [east Borneo], Syangka [Thailand], Palestine, Sibti [?], Arab Abbasid [78], Barusa [Kashmir], Cambay [west India], kingdoms in Central Java and East Java, and so on. Tarumanagara sent ambassadors to these friendly countries and vice versa.\n\nand that\n\nIn 357 Saka (435 AD), Wisnuwarman sent his envoys to various countries, viz. China, Bharatanagari [India], Campanagari [Champa], Bakulapura [east Borneo], Dharmanagari [south Thailand], etc. Their mission was to inform to the kings of friendly countries that the king of Tarumanagara was changed to Wisnuwarman and that the friendship that had been nurtured would continue.\n\nAccording to The Book of Sung, the Aruteun Country sent envoys to Liu Sung China three times, for sure, in 430, 433, and 436 AD. Although no name was given for the first instance, the sender is considered to have been Purnawarman on account of the period of his reign, 395-434 AD, and the chief envoy, his uncle, Nagawarman.\n\nThe sender of envoys in 433 and 436 AD was apparently Wisnuwarman. In the former instance (430 AD), since Wisnuwarman was still the crown prince, it is probable that he wrote the letter with his signature on behalf of King Purnawarman. The year 436 AD in The Book of Sung is considered to correspond to the year 435 AD in the PPBJ 1-1, although one year difference lies between them.\n\nThe incident recorded in The Book of Sung that Wisnuwarman had once lost his position by a coup dâÃ©tat may agree with the case written in PPBJ 1-1. As to the reason why the year is not found in the Chinese book, it could be probable that the relevant passage was a record from another letter received in 437 AD or in a later year.\n\n(9) Coup dâÃ©tat of Cakrawarman\n\nLet us summarise the rather long description in the PPBJ 1-1 in short.\n\nThree years after the start of Wisnuwarmanâs administration (359 Saka, 437 AD), an earthquake and a lunar eclipse occurred. They were bad omens. He was also plagued by nightmares and became troubled. One night when Wisnuwarman and his queen were in bed in the palace, someone stole into the room to assassinate the king but in vain, as he was found and captured by the guards. At first the intruder refused to say who had masterminded the assassination but later confessed that the task was given by Cakrawarman, an uncle of Wisnuwarman, or younger brother of Purnawarman.\n\nAlthough Cakrawarman had failed to assassinate Wisnuwarman, he is considered to have taken control of the country for a while as written in The Book of Sung.\n\nSeveral months later, four of the rebels were arrested but Cakrawarman and his high-ranked followers fled eastward into the forest at the edge of the Taruma River. When they arrived at the Cupu subkingdom, King Satyaguna immediately expelled Cakrawarman and his followers because the king remained loyal to the Purnawarman-Wisnuwarman line. Then, Cakrawarman and his followers hid in the forest in the southern part of Indraprahasta. Although Cakrawarman the Warlord had several high-commanders and a significant number of soldiers assembled from the territories under his influence, his armies were eventually defeated by the Indraprahastaâs troops after a heavy battle. After that, Wisnuwarman married the princes Dewi Suklawati of Indraprahasta, as his first empress had already died before.\n\nThe scene of the battle was vividly written to tell us how the battle at that age was like. They had not only war-horses but also war-elephants. A lot of blood was shed in the battlefield and all houses around there were burnt. Cakrawarman and his commanders were killed during the battle.\n\n(10) Books edited by Purnawarman\n\nAs an achievement of Purnawarman, it was mentioned that he composed various books, such as below, and many others.\n\nâ¢\n\nNitipustaka RÄjya Tarumanagara (Policybook of the King of Tarumanagara),\n\nâ¢\n\nNitipustaka ning Aksohini (Policybook of Battle Formation),\n\nâ¢\n\nNitipustaka Yuddhawarnana (Policybook of Warfare Description),\n\nâ¢\n\nNitipustaka Desantara i Bhumi Jawa Kulwan (Policybook Foreign Countries on the Soil of Java â One)\n\nâ¢\n\nPustaka Warmanwamsatilaka (Policybook of Warrior Society Tilaka*)\n\nâ¢\n\nPustaka GhosanÄjÃ±ÄrÄjya (The book of Gosha-Anja-King?)\n\n*) Marks placed on the forehead among Vaisya class people to show their sect.\n\nIt is remarkable that many books were composed around the end of the fourth century to the early fifth century. As far as the present author knows, this fact has not been written in any publication other than PPBJ 1-1.\n\nAmong the list of materials used for the preparation of PPBJ 1-1 [79] are found books, Pustaka Tarumarajyaparwawarnana (The Book of .Descriptions about Old Taruma Kings) and Pustaka mengenai Warmanwamsatilaka i Bhumi Dwipantara (The Book about Warrior Society Tilaka on the Soil of Dwipantara) , the title of which look similar to those ofNitipustaka RÄjya Tarumanagara and Pustaka Warmanwamsatilaka in the list of Purnawarmanâs books. This suggests that the copies of Purnawarmanâs books might have been available in the library of the Court of Cirebon in the beginning of the seventeenth century when the Wangsakerta Manuscripts were composed.\n\n(11) The history of Bakulapura\n\nAs mentioned above, the Wangsakerta Manuscripts told of Bakulapura in Tanjungnagara [Kalimantan] which was established by Aswawarman, the second son of King Dewawarman of Salakanagara, who had moved there and married to the daughter of local chief, Kudungga. Since the names of Aswawarman and Kudungga appeared in the stone inscriptions called âPrasasti Mulawarmanâ (or Prasasti Kutai) [80] discovered in the lower basin of Mahakam River, Bakulapura was considered as the real name of Kutai Kingdom or Kutai Martapura Kingdom that was conventionally given after the Sultanate of Kutai Karta Negara in Martapura founded in the beginning of the fourteenth century. Figure 14 shows pictures of Prasasti Mulawarman.\n\nFigure 14 Two of the four Prasasti Mulawarman (photographed with permission at Museum Nasional Indonesia by. M. Iguchi, January 2019)\n\nAlthough the history of Bakulapura has no bearing on the subject of this book, let us en passanat discuss relevant passages in PPBJ 1-1 to verify the image of âKutai Kingdomâ obtained from the stone inscription.\n\nWith regard to the origin of the family, it was written that their ancestor arrived in Tanjungnagara [Kalimantan] from the Sungga dynasty in Magadha (in Bihar), India, when the dynasty was defeated by the Kusana [81] and fled scattered around the Archipelago. The village where their ancestor had settled was named Kuta (or Kutai). Kudungga was the son of Attwangga, and Attwangga, the son of Mitrongga Lughubhumi who was a contemporary of Dewawarman VI of Salakanagara (reigned 211-230 Saka/ 289-308 AD). The family in Kalimantan is said to have begun with Pusyamitra but the relationship between he and Mitrongga, whether the former was the father or grandfather of the latter, was not clear, as unfortunately the descriptions about Bakulapura did not give the year of the kingsâ coronation and abdication, unlike those about Salakanagara and Tarumanagara. The kinship between Aswawarman and Kudungga was not clear from the Prasasti Mulawarman, but it is now evident that the former was not the real son but son-in-law of the latter, originally the second son of King Dewawarman of Salakanagara of West Java who married the daughter of the latter.\n\nDuring the reign of Aswawarman Bakulapura became a great country, where people lived prosperously and peacefully. Thereby Aswawarman was regarded as the founder of the Bakulapura kingdom. After the throne was succeeded by Mulawarman, Bakulapura grew further into a bigger and more powerful country, so that kings in neighbouring countries were subjected to Bakulapuraâs authority. With Tarumanagara, Bakulapura had maintained a good relationship. About the decline of the kingdom, no description is found in the Wangsakerta Manuscripts.\n\nIt should be remarked that a past view that âKudungga is not a Sanskrit word, and seems to point to the Indonesian origin of the familyâ [82] seems to be inappropriate now with reference to the information from the Wangsakerta Manuscripts. The fact that the Bakulapura family worshiped Hinduism was already evident from the Mulawarman Inscriptions.\n\nChapter 5\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\n(1)\n\nThe previous assumption by the present author that the unidentified country, åµç¾ å®, recorded in The Book of Sung was the transliteration of Aruteun and that Aruteun Country was the alternative name of Tarumanagara represented by the name of the capital has been ascertained with detailed investigation of the Chinese text and reference to the Wangsakerta Manuscripts, viz. PPBJ 1-1. In particular, the dispatching of envoys to China by King Wisnuwarman (æ¯æ²è·æ©) has been confirmed by the corresponding descriptions in PPBJ 1-1. It has also been learnt that friendly relationships were established earlier during the reign of King Purnawarman and ambassadors were exchanged not only with China but also many other countries.\n\n(2)\n\nThe origin of the family of Tarumanagara and Bakulapura (Kutai), which was formerly assumed as India from the Sanskrit script of stone inscriptions, is now clear and the kinship between the families of Salakanagara, Tarumanagara and Bakulapura has been learnt from PPBJ.\n\n(3)\n\nDescriptions corresponding to those in the epigraphs on the stone inscriptions of Tarumanagara Era were also found in PPBJ 1-1. It is especially remarkable that the year of riverworks at Candrabhaga and Ghomati Rivers which was not written in Prasasti Tugu was specified in PPBJ 1-1 and that âThe king of kingsâ and âthe Grand-fatherâ in the same stone inscription were identified as Jayasinghawarman, the founder of Tarumanagara. According to PPBJ 1-1, Purnawarman conducted riverworks not only at the above two rivers but also at many other rivers in the territory of Tarumanagara and founded many cities including Sundapura, the nucleus of the later-time Sunda Kelapa, Jayakarta, Batavia and Jakarta.\n\n(4) The fact that Purnawarman had composed many books and that they would have remained in the court of Cirebon when the Wangsakerta Manuscripts were written is new to us, not found in other references. (5) The Arca Cibuaya I and II discovered at the Cibuaya Site and possibly similar ones erected at other places are considered to have been modelled after the armoured Sang Purnawarman, although this is no more than an imagination.\n\nNevertheless, with respect to the location of Candrabhaga and Ghomati Rivers, whichever of the followings is right, remains still unclear.\n\n(a)\n\nAround the present-day North Jakarta, where the Prasasti Tugu was unearthed,\n\n(b)\n\nThe present-day Ciaruteun Ilir Village, where stone monuments, Prasasti Ciaruteun and Prasasti Kebon Kopi, were found,\n\n(c)\n\nElsewhere.\n\nReferences and Notes\n\n(â*â denotes Japanese and Chinese references)"
