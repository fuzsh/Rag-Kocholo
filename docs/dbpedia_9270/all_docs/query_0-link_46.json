        "text": "In order to finalize the Fast Track Internship and Thesis Program for students, the team from President University (Presuniv) visited the Tanjung Lesung Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Banten, managed by PT Banten West Java Tourism Development Corporation (BWJ), on Wednesday Thursday, August 7-8, 2024. The Presuniv team included Handa S. Abidin, SH, LL.M., Ph.D., the Rector; Dr. Adhi Setyo Santoso, ST, MBA, Vice-Rector for Academic Affairs, Research, and Innovation; Dr. Iman Permana, BS(PE), MM, Dean of the Faculty of Business; along with several lecturers and department heads. The Presuniv team was welcomed by Kunto Wijoyo, BWJ’s Operations Director; Puspita Prisukma, BWJ’s Human Resources Manager; Hendro Wahyono, General Manager of Tanjung Lesung Beach Hotel; and their team. “We hope that the collaboration between Presuniv and BWJ can continue to grow,” said Handa during the visit.\n\nThe Fast Track Internship and Thesis Program is set to begin in September 2024. Through this program, students will be directly involved in managing the hospitality and tourism business at the Tanjung Lesung SEZ for nine months. This hands-on experience will not only provide students with real-world work experience in the industry but also help them gather data that will enable them to complete their theses more quickly.\n\nUnder this scheme, students participating in the Fast Track Internship and Thesis Program can graduate faster than through the normal route. In the regular path, students must complete an internship and their thesis over three semesters or one year. According to Adhi Setyo, “This Fast-Track Internship and Thesis Program is designed to allow students to complete their internships and theses more quickly.”\n\nDuring the internship at Tanjung Lesung, students will be involved in various business processes and operations at BWJ. They will not be limited to just one position but will be rotated through different departments to gain experience in different units. In addition to the internship, students will also have the opportunity to innovate and develop new business ideas for BWJ and execute them as projects.\n\nThese projects will enrich the students’ portfolios in their resumes or CVs. Additionally, these projects can be used by students as material for writing their theses or final assignments. While at Tanjung Lesung, students will receive intensive guidance from lecturers, allowing them to work on their theses or final assignments simultaneously with their internships.\n\nTo avoid burnout, students can also enjoy various tourism facilities available in the area, including Lalassa Beach Club, Tanjung Lesung Beach Hotel, and Ladda Beach, along with the beautiful beaches.

The team includes Jedda Muncar RR, Andre Andriano, Putri Amalia, Yemima Winnie Allson, Ellyna Setyaningrum, Riyani Juwita S, Titania Eirel Razara, Suri Agatha Zastalie Lumban Tobing, Fetrik Cola PV Sitepu, and Magnus Absalom H. They were guided by Mila Austria Reyes, CPA, MBA, the Head of the Accounting Study Program at the Faculty of Business. POCaRI won first place in the Aesthetic category at the Economic Survival 3 Social Project exhibition held on July 30-31, 2024, at the President University Convention Center, Jl. H. Usmar Ismail, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang.\n\nThe POCaRI project aims to prevent ethnocentrism, which is the tendency to view other cultures through one’s own cultural values and standards. Additionally PoCaRI seeks to promote tolerance among communities, especially in those that are relatively less open. This is achieved by strengthening the values of Religion, Pancasila, and Citizenship among the target communities.\n\nPOCaRI implemented its project in Parakanceuri Village, Pusakamulya, Kiarapedes District, Purwakarta Regency, West Java. The POCaRI team began their activities with a visit to Parakanceuri Village on Monday, June 24, 2024. During the visit, the students discovered that the literacy level of the villagers was relatively low, and the villagers expressed a desire to improve their literacy.\n\nIn response, POCaRI began collecting donations of books. Jedda Muncar RR, the Project Manager of POCaRI, said, “When we opened the book donation drive, the lecturers were very supportive. We received various books from them.” After collecting the books, on Wednesday, July 10, 2024, the POCaRI team returned to Parakanceuri Village to carry out their social project. They donated hundreds of books as the initial stock for the village’s literacy garden. Additionally, the POCaRI team organized several activities designed to help the villagers better understand the values of Religion, Pancasila, and Citizenship. These activities included a coloring competition for children, poster-making for teenagers, and storytelling training for housewives.\n\nPOCaRI is grateful for the support their social project received from the local Village Consultative Body. During the activities, the community was very enthusiastic. “When we held the reading training for the housewives, many of them said they hadn’t read a book in a long time. So, this activity was very helpful for them,” said Jedda. (Graciella V, PR team.

To provide literacy on anti-online gambling and investment scams, Commander of Squadron 2 Halim Perdanakusuma Air Base, Lieutenant Colonel Pnb. Fitrianto Ali Ngimron, ST, M.Han., invited lecturers from the Accounting Study Program, Faculty of Business, President University (Presuniv), to provide literacy to all attending soldiers on Friday, July 26, 2024. The Presuniv team that attended consisted of Mila Austria Reyes, CPA, MBA, Head of the Accounting Study Program, and lecturers Dr. Supeni Anggraeni Mapuasari, SE, M.Sc., CRP., Dr. Muhamad Safiq, SE, M.Si., Ak., CA., Andrianantenaina Hajanirina, BA, B.Sc., MM, Vita Elisa Fitriana, SE, M.Sc., and Chita Oktapriana, M.Ak., CSRS, CMA.\n\nMayor Tek Adi Susilo, ST, MM, representing Lieutenant Colonel Fitrianto, said in his speech, “We highly appreciate the presence of the Presuniv Accounting Study Program team. We want to learn and become smarter in managing finances and not easily tempted by online gambling and investment scams.” Meanwhile, Mila Reyes stated, “We hope that inter-agency cooperation like this can continue in the future. We at Presuniv are always ready to help.”\n\nThe Dangers of Online Gambling and Investment Scams\n\nOnline gambling cannot be underestimated, as it caused Indonesia a loss of more than IDR 200 trillion in 2023. This is no small amount. Moreover, the victims of online gambling are often from the lower-middle economic class. Online gambling also causes addiction. This addiction can even affect those close to the user.\n\nSupeni stated, “Online gambling threatens our demographics. If uncontrolled, it can lower the quality of our human resources.” Many online gambling participants are in their productive years and often support their families. With the large amount of money lost due to online gambling, funds that should be used for their children’s education may be depleted, resulting in wasted money.\n\nIn addition to online gambling, many people are tempted by offers of various investment scams that promise high returns. While the desire to invest is good, the public must also be smart in choosing investments. They must ensure that the investments they choose are not scams. “The simplest way to recognize an investment scam is by looking at the rate of return. If such an offer exists, be cautious. Especially if there is no risk, it is highly likely that this offer is an investment scam,” said Andrianantenaina. (Graciella V, PR team. Report and Photo: Supeni Mapuasari)\n\nOn Thursday, July 25, 2024, President University (Presuniv), in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemendag) and the Export School, held a seminar aimed at encouraging young people to become exporters in the future. The seminar, titled Future Export, Future Hero: Preparing the Next Generation to Become Exporters in the Future with Sekolah Ekspor Indonesia at President University “Be the Next Hero,” also marked the launch of the Export Booklet compiled by students from the International Relations (IR) Study Program, Faculty of Humanities, Presuniv.\n\nDr. Jeanne Francoise, Head of the IR Study Program, said, “The launch of this booklet is a form of social responsibility from IR students. They gathered information not only to complete their final social project but also to create a booklet containing guidelines for becoming an exporter.” The first booklet discussing exports is expected to correct various misconceptions students have about exporting.\n\nThe seminar also featured Dr. Handito Hadi Joewono, Head of the Export School and CEO of Arrbey Consulting, and Sugih Rahmansyah, SE, MM, Head of the Human Resources Training Center for Export and Trade Services, Kemendag, as well as Dr. Ir. Hally Hanafiah, ST, MM, CSCA, CSCM, CPLM, a senior lecturer at Presuniv who moderated the seminar.\n\nAccording to Handito, based on a survey of students, the majority only want to become employees. Therefore, Handito said, the government needs to initiate an “export revolution” for students to boost national exports. “This is very important. If we look at the market now, there are many imported products coming in illegally at very low prices. This disrupts the price balance in the market,” said Handito. This condition must be countered by an export revolution to prevent Indonesia from becoming an importer nation.\n\nMeanwhile, Sugih emphasized that there is no age limit for someone to become an entrepreneur. “And, there are currently many facilities that support this,” he said. However, Sugih stressed one important thing that must be maintained by anyone who wants to build their own business. He said, “Never forget to build customer trust. Because once they trust us, they will not easily switch to other companies.” (Graciella V, PR team.

Abidin, SH, LL.M., Ph.D., students are encouraged to learn more about working in an embassy. To realize this, on Monday, July 22, 2024, the students visited the Japanese Embassy on Jl. MH Thamrin, Jakarta. During the visit, the students were accompanied by the former Indonesian Ambassador to Vietnam, Ibnu Hadi, SE, M.Ec., a lecturer in the International Relations Program at Presuniv.\n\nDuring the visit, the Presuniv delegation was received by Tanaka Motoyasu, Director of Politics at the Japanese Embassy. Tanaka expressed his surprise at the enthusiasm and curiosity of the Presuniv students. “This is very good, and at the same time, it is my first experience welcoming students directly after more than 20 years of working at the embassy. It’s very enjoyable,” he said.\n\nAccording to Tanaka, students are very fortunate to study at Presuniv. “By studying at Presuniv, students have a golden opportunity because they are taught and can learn directly from experts. For example, students can learn from Mr. Ibnu Hadi, who was once the Indonesian Ambassador to Vietnam,” he said. Ibnu Hadi served as the Indonesian Ambassador to Vietnam from 2016 to 2020.\n\nDuring the visit, Presuniv students were briefed on Japan-Indonesia cooperation programs, including gaining a deeper understanding of Japan-Indonesia relations over the past 60 years. Tanaka explained various Japan-Indonesia cooperation projects, such as the construction of the mass rapid transport (MRT), the development of Patimban Port in Subang, West Java, and maritime and defense cooperation. Tanaka then invited the students to tour the Japanese Embassy library and the visa processing center.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Ibnu Hadi hoped that the Ambassador Experience could help balance theory and practice. “In social sciences, we cannot just sit behind a desk and read books. We must be willing to go out and experience what is happening in the field, so students get a more comprehensive picture of the world,” said Ibnu Hadi. (Faisal Rabbani, PR team.

Architecture enthusiasts, including the Archies highly anticipate such visits, as they provide deep insights into the design & construction process. Through this visit, students will gain knowledge on how the construction process works ranging from the pre-construction development phase to completion.\n\nAtelier Bertiga, based in Bintaro, South Tangerang, is an architecture and interior consultancy founded in 2016 by Didot Bima and Andrea Daniswara as principal architects. Both Didot and Andrea have diverse work portfolios, including as developers, consultants, and contractors. Several junior architects have also joined Atelier Bertiga.\n\nIn Rawalumbu, specifically at Jl. Kemang Anggrek No. 3, the architecture students observed a two-floor house renovation designed by Atelier Bertiga. The house has been renovated, with walls covered in glossy clay and foliage. Standing on plot of 150 square meters, the house is in the finishing stages of interior work.\n\nThe entrance of the house is a ramp built around an old tree, leading students to the first floor, which has been elevated by one meter. On the first floor, there is a multifunctional room equipped with stairs to the second floor. Under the stairs, there is compact storage to maximize the use of otherwise non-functional space.\n\nThe first floor also has a single-wall kitchen positioned next to a mini lawn, which greatly supports air circulation. Additionally, the first floor includes a laundry area, one bathroom, and one bedroom for a household assistant.\n\nThe stairs to the second floor are L-shaped. This floor is mainly used for private rooms, such as the master bedroom, bathroom, children’s bedrooms, and a hobby room for the owner. The furniture on the second floor is custom-made from plywood covered with high-pressure laminating (HPL). Meanwhile, the flooring uses stone polymer composite (SPC) with a wood pattern, adding a Japanese touch as specified by the homeowner.\n\nGlass roof tiles have been installed to allow sunlight to illuminate the interior each room is also equipped with wide windows, allowing ample light to enter and making the house’s atmosphere warmer and more comfortable.

The workshop was held at the President Executive Club, Capitol Business District, Jl. Niaga Raya, Cikarang, Bekasi, was attended by the Founder of Presuniv and President Director of PT Jababeka Tbk., SD Darmono, Chairman of the President University Education Foundation Prof. Dr. Ir. Budi Susilo Soepandji, DEA, Presuniv Rector Handa S. Abidin, SH, LL.M., Ph.D., along with the rectorate staff and managers from the Jababeka Group.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Darmono emphasized the importance for all Jababeka managers and employees to understand the company’s financial statements. “This is crucial so that employees can work efficiently,” Darmono stressed. If employees can work efficiently, he continued, the company’s profits are expected to increase, thereby improving employee welfare.\n\nDarmono also highlighted the importance of cooperation among business units or subsidiaries to achieve work efficiency. “If one unit has problems, other competent units need to support it,” he explained. One of the roles of the PDC, as Presuniv’s center of excellence, is to help Jababeka business units that are facing issues by providing training and business consulting services.\n\nThe Need to Understand Finance\n\nThis workshop featured speakers Dr. Stephanus Remond Waworuntu, MBA, Head of the Management Study Program, and Dr. Drs. Chandra Setiawan, MM, Ph.D., a Management lecturer who also served as a Commissioner of the Business Competition Supervisory Commission. The workshop was moderated by the Dean of the Faculty of Business, Dr. Iman Permana, BS(PE), MM.\n\nWhile moderating the workshop, Iman explained the importance of financial understanding for all participants. “Even if we are not from the finance department, understanding finance is very important. Not only as employees but also as individuals,” Iman said.\n\nMeanwhile, in his presentation, Chandra Setiawan emphasized the importance of financial understanding for all participants. “Those who understand finance are highly valued by the company,” he said. In Indonesia, Chandra continued, the salary of a finance manager can reach tens of millions of rupiah, and abroad it could be more than a hundred million rupiahs. “Imagine, many companies highly value those who understand finance,” he remarked.\n\nFor managers working in non-financial fields, understanding finance is also very important. “Because business decisions often need to be made considering the company’s financial condition,” he emphasized.\n\nIn the next session, Stephanus Remond shared his experiences. “For ordinary staff, it might not be an issue if they don’t want to learn about finance. But if they want their career to progress, such thinking needs to be changed.” If employees want to become directors, Stephanus continued, they must understand finance. “If not, it will be difficult to get promoted,” he emphasized.\n\nAs a director, according to Stephanus, many things need to be managed and almost all are related to finance. For example, dealing with creditors. “How can we talk to creditors if we don’t understand finance?” he asked. Data in financial statements, Stephanus added, contains very significant information. “If we understand how to read financial statements, we can predict the company’s targets over a certain period,” he concluded. (Graciella V, PR team. Photo: Graciella V).\n\nCurrently, technology plays a very strategic role in the business world. Almost all companies have implemented technology, both hardware and software, in their business processes. To anticipate this development, President University (Presuniv) collaborates with technology companies to prepare its students so that after graduation they have skills that match industry needs. One such collaboration is with PT Epicor Software Indonesia. Through this collaboration, Epicor provided assistance worth US$170,000 in the form of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software licenses and training programs for Presuniv students.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, 2024, the Territory Manager of Epicor Indonesia, Andi Mulyawan, initiated the ERP training program for students from the Information System (IS) Study Program, Faculty of Computer Science, Presuniv. Dozens of students participated in the training held at the Charles Himawan Auditorium, Building A, 5th Floor, Presuniv Campus, Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Jababeka Education Park, Jababeka City, Cikarang, Bekasi.\n\nAccording to Genta Sahuri M.Sc., an IS Study Program lecturer and ERP Project course instructor, “The ERP course and training are indeed aimed at making Presuniv stay one step ahead of other universities. Moreover, Presuniv is located in the Jababeka industrial area with thousands of companies within it. So, we can directly see real-world cases and the application of technology at these companies.”\n\nERP Widely Used\n\nERP is the most widely used application by companies worldwide. Through this application, companies can manage and integrate all their business processes. One key factor in implementing ERP is that all data and business processes within the company must be integrated into one platform and transformed into information. This information must be accessible by various departments or business units within the company. With complete and real-time information, companies can quickly make important business decisions.\n\nThe training in the use of ERP applications is provided to Presuniv students. According to Andi Mulyawan, ERP applications are widely used by companies in the manufacturing industry. “And, in the Jababeka industrial area, there are around 2,000 companies, most of which are in the manufacturing sector. So, if Presuniv graduates are proficient in using ERP applications, they will be quickly absorbed by these companies,” explained Andi.\n\nTo all participants, Andi advised them to truly utilize this training to develop their skills and knowledge in using the ERP applications. “Through this training, Presuniv has opened the door as wide as possible for all students to have skills and knowledge that meet industry needs. So, take advantage of this opportunity by learning and practicing earnestly,” said Andi. (Faisal Rabbani, PR team.

This seminar featured Rajendra Aryal, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) Representative in Indonesia, and Timor Leste, who discussed the topic “Towards Sustainable Agrifood Systems.” The seminar took place in the Charles Himawan Auditorium, 5th floor of Building A, Presuniv Campus, Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang, and was attended by various faculty members and students from several study programs.\n\nDr. M. Syafi’i Anwar, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities, highlighted in his opening remarks the significant impact of climate change. He explained that climate change not only degrades soil but also triggers various natural disasters. “No country is immune to the impacts of natural disasters,” said Syafi’i. He further emphasized, “The UN urges us to change our mindset and behavior to act in a more environmentally friendly way. We do this not just for ourselves but for future generations.”\n\nPresident University Rector Handa S. Abidin, SH, LL.M., Ph.D., began his speech by asking, “Who among the students here wants to become a farmer?” Only a few hands were raised. Handa remarked that despite the crucial role farmers play in sustaining human life, very few show any interest in becoming one. “If only a few of us aspire to be farmers, Indonesia will face a shortage of farmers in the future,” he warned. To increase student interest in agriculture, Handa challenged students to compete in building agriculture-based technology startups.\n\nIn his presentation, Rajendra noted, “The current generation prefers to seek opportunities in cities rather than staying in rural areas. In cities, they can become anything, unlike in the villages.” He presented data indicating that about 80% of farmers are currently aged 40 years or older. “So, if no young people want to become farmers, in 40 years, there will be no farmers left,” Rajendra cautioned. Responding to Handa’s idea of encouraging students to build agricultural startups, Rajendra praised it as an excellent initiative. (Graciella V, PR team.

Budi Gunadi Sadikin, S.Si., CHFC, CLU, when he opened the Mental Health Seminar: Heal The Heart, Growing The Mental Health, on Tuesday, July 16, 2024. Minister Budi Gunadi delivered his remarks in the form of a video recording. The seminar was held at the Charles Himawan Auditorium, Building A, 5th Floor, President University’s main campus on Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang, Bekasi, the seminar was a social project organized by students taking the Statepersonship course, which combines Religion, Pancasila, Citizenship, and Indonesian Language courses.\n\n“Love yourself first,” quoted from the words of the South Korean boyband BTS, carries an important message for today’s youth, according to Minister Budi Gunadi. He said, “Children need to love, accept, and appreciate themselves before seeking recognition from others.” The message “love yourself first,” according to Minister Budi Gunadi, is crucial for reflection. “Because overall health is not only physical but also mental,” he said.\n\n15.5 Million Adolescents Experience Mental Health Issues\n\nMinister Budi Gunadi then presented data showing that one in three adolescents in Indonesia, equivalent to 15.5 million people, experiences mental health issues such as mental disorders, depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. “These mental disorders are the second leading cause of disability in Indonesia,” he revealed. He added, “Coupled with the stigma and discrimination faced by people with mental disorders in Indonesia, which causes some of them not to receive proper treatment, such as being restrained or neglected.”\n\nGiven this situation, Minister Budi Gunadi greatly appreciates President University for organizing a seminar on mental health. He also hopes this seminar can be part of an effort to increase understanding and concern among young people, as well as reduce the stigma around mental health issues. “Let us realize mental health for everyone in the spirit of transforming Indonesia’s health system. Heal the heart, love yourself first,” Minister Budi Gunadi concluded his remarks.\n\nRecovery Can Take a Long Time\n\nThis mental health seminar also featured speaker Dr. Gabriella Tantular, SPKJ, M.Biomed, a psychiatrist from RSUD Karawang, RS Bayukarta Karawang, and RS EMC Cikarang. The seminar was attended by dozens of high school students as well as teachers, lecturers, and university students. In the seminar, Gabriella described the behavior of generations from Baby Boomers to Gen Z. She said, “Each generation has different behaviors and approaches. So, we cannot treat each generation the same way because the world they face is also very different.”\n\nMental health issues, according to Gabriella, are very important. “Because mental health issues are sometimes not visible, unlike physical wounds. Only if we pay close attention can the problems sometimes become apparent,” she explained. For example, one of the symptoms is strange behavior. “So if there is a friend who behaves strangely, do not avoid them. Talk to them and embrace them,” she said.\n\nSuch an approach, Gabriella continued, is very meaningful for someone with mental health issues. “Long-term effects need a long journey. So if the disorder has been present for a long time, recovery will also take a long time,” Gabriella said. (Faisal Rabbani, PR team.

One of these skills is playing golf. To further enlighten students about the importance of golf for their future careers, Presuniv held a seminar titled “Why do President University Students Need to Learn Golf?” on Thursday, July 9, 2024.\n\nThe seminar, was held at the Charles Himawan Auditorium, Building A, 5th floor, Presuniv Campus on Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang, featured speakers from various backgrounds. Among them were Alfin Sulaiman, a lawyer and also the Deputy Chairman of Championships and Achievements of the Indonesian Golf Association, Angga Puradiredja, a musician from the band Maliq & D’essentials who is also a golf influencer, Rinaldi Macellak, a judge and Head of the Competition Division of the Indonesian Golf Association. The event was moderated by Dr. Dra. Fennieka Kristianto, SH, MH, MA, M.Kn, Head of the Master’s Program in Law at Presuniv, and Rendi Saefulloh Yusuf, a student from the International Relations Program class of 2023, who is also a member of Golferation, one of the clubs and communities at Presuniv.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Presuniv Rector Handa S. Abidin, SH, LL.M, Ph.D., expressed his regret that he did not learn golf earlier. “Many people have invited me to play golf. Because I couldn’t, I ended up not participating. This caused me to miss many golden opportunities to connect with important people through golf.”\n\nAlfin shared a similar sentiment. According to him, Presuniv is doing an extraordinary thing by teaching golf to its students. “Presuniv is the first university to equip its students with knowledge outside the subjects they are taking,” he said, impressed. Moreover, he believes that playing golf is also good for the mental health of students. “Golf requires focus, patience, and strategic thinking. So, playing golf can improve our mental well-being,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Angga asked if Presuniv students are specifically taught to give speeches. He said, “I am impressed with how students, including the rector, speak. Very inspiring and to the point.” According to Angga, communication skills like this are very important, especially for social sports like golf. “A game can last up to four and a half hours. During that time, we need to continuously interact with our playing partners. This is where communication skills are essential. And it’s not easy,” he said.\n\nRinaldy agreed. According to him, when playing golf, a person needs to be aware of their surroundings. “For example, if there are five people playing at one hole, and there are two people behind us, let them go first. Playing golf with five people takes much longer than with two people,” he said. Additionally, there is one very important value for golf players to uphold. What is it? “Honesty. This value is crucial to maintaining the integrity of our game,” he emphasized.\n\nAdrian Maulana, a Financial Planner, Public Figure, and Golf Enthusiast who could not attend due to health issues, shared his experience through a video. According to him, good physical ability, skills, and mental strength are essential for playing golf. “Playing golf is not easy. And because it’s not easy, I feel challenged and love golf even more,” he said. Moreover, Adrian finds satisfaction in hitting the ball well and achieving a better score than before.

This way, we won’t be blind and will know what we need to do to advance our nation,” stated Tatang Budie Utama Razak enthusiastically. Tatang, the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Indonesia to Colombia, conveyed this during the President University Ambassador Lecture held on Thursday, July 11, 2024, in Theatre Room 3, Fabrication Laboratory, President University Convention Center, Jl. H. Usmar Ismail, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang.\n\nIn his guest lecture, Tatang compared the economic performance of Indonesia with Colombia and several other countries. He mentioned that Indonesia, which will celebrate its 79th independence this year, is still a developing country. “However, don’t be discouraged. Colombia, which has been independent for 214 years, is also still classified as a developing country,” he said. He then compared several data points between Indonesia and Colombia.\n\nIndonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) currently stands at US$1.37 trillion, while Colombia’s GDP is US$363.54 billion. According to Tatang, if the economic crisis of 1998 had not occurred, Indonesia would now be the third-largest economy in the world, after the United States and China. Another data point he mentioned was Indonesia’s state budget, which is currently US$186.9 billion, compared to Colombia’s US$98.3 billion.\n\nCiting World Bank data, Tatang revealed that by 2025, Indonesia will be the fourth or fifth-largest economy in the world. “This will become a reality if we all work hard and continue to innovate so that Indonesian products can compete in the global market,” he emphasized. He then referred to South Korea, which became a developed country through its innovative capabilities. In the 1980s, South Korea was still a developing country, just like Indonesia.\n\nTatang advised all students that Indonesia has great potential to become a developed country and escape the middle-income trap. “Indonesia’s success in becoming a developed country depends on the capacity of its leaders. And leaders need citizens who understand the country’s potential and are willing to act for their nation,” concluded Tatang. (Faisal Rabbani, PR team.

Despite the early hour, a group of students from the Industrial Engineering Program, Faculty of Engineering, President University (Presuniv), who were part of Group 2, were already on site. That morning, they were set to carry out a campaign on anti-discrimination and religious tolerance to the public who were exercising and passing by along the road. This campaign was part of the final assignment for general courses, which included Religion, Indonesian Language, Civics, and Pancasila.\n\nRepresenting the entire group, the Project Manager of Group 2, Raden Asep Ahmad Fadillah, explained that they chose this topic due to a series of incidents indicating an increase in discrimination and a decline in religious tolerance in Karawang. Among these incidents were a group of residents in Tegalwaru Village rejecting the construction of a church, and the vandalism of places of worship by unknown individuals. “These incidents tarnish the name of Karawang, which historically has been one of the symbols of pluralism in Indonesia,” Raden emphasized. Therefore, as an effort to restore that symbol, Group 2 designed a campaign for anti-discrimination and religious tolerance.\n\nOn that bright morning, Raden and his colleagues engaged with the public They invited people to play games and quizzes while reminding them of the importance of anti-discrimination and religious tolerance. Although brief, Raden stated, “The campaign at least managed to remind the community of the importance of respecting pluralism.”\n\nThe sun began to feel warmer. As the clock approached 10:00 AM, all members of Group 2 agreed to conclude the campaign. They dismantled tables, decorations, packed up all campaign equipment, and then cleaned the campaign area of trash. (JB Susetiyo, PR Team.

This annual competition for high school students was held partly offline this year, after being conducted online for the past two years.\n\nIn his speech, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Dr.-Ing. Erwin Sitompul, ST, M.Sc., highlighted one important environmental issue, namely carbon emissions. He stated, “There are regulations to reduce greenhouse gases. Given this situation, the ability to count carbon emissions is crucial.” Erwin explained that the industry’s ability to reduce carbon emissions holds economic value. “These carbon emission reductions can be traded with other companies that have not yet been able to reduce their emissions.”\n\nWith more regulations encouraging the industry to move towards zero emissions, Erwin emphasized that the ability to count carbon emissions is highly necessary now and in the future. “Therefore, training in Counting Carbon Emissions is very important. Hopefully, all participants can learn this well,” said Erwin.\n\nMeanwhile, Head of the Environmental Engineering Study Program, Yosef Barita Sar Manik, ST, M.Sc., Ph.D., emphasized, “We must protect the environment. We should not let the world we live in be damaged by the rapid development of technology. Today’s young generation must be at the forefront of preserving the environment, even as industrialization progresses rapidly.”\n\nCounting Carbon Emissions\n\nThis year’s EBI, themed Sustainable Development Goals, consisted of two competition categories: Quiz and Scientific Paper. Besides holding competitions, EBI also organized a blood donation drive in collaboration with the Blood Transfusion Unit of the Indonesian Red Cross (UTD PMI) Bekasi Regency and a workshop on Counting Carbon Emissions.\n\nIn the Scientific Paper competition, several scientific papers were submitted. These papers were then reviewed by the jury. As a result, three best papers were selected. The authors of these papers were then invited to Fabrication Lab (Fablab), President University Convention Center (PUCC), Jl. H. Usmar Ismail, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang, to participate in the final round held on Friday, July 5, 2024.\n\nIn the final round, the three top-scoring authors presented their Scientific Papers and prototypes to the jury. After the presentations, while waiting for the jury’s verdict, participants and their companions toured the campus.\n\nAfter the tour, the event continued with a workshop on Counting Carbon Emissions conducted by two speakers from Jababeka Infrastructure, namely Cinthya Hendrayani and Regi Risman Sandi. Cinthya explained that Jababeka, as the manager of the industrial area, needs to prepare various facilities required by companies from various industries. “We need to ensure that the industries in Jababeka remain relevant to developments. Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for future risks, including environmental risks such as carbon emissions,” she explained.\n\nCarbon emissions, resulting from various human activities, accelerate global warming. If this issue is not taken seriously, it can worsen the Earth’s condition. Regi added, “Nowadays, it is easier to count carbon emissions, especially with various applications designed to help count carbon emissions.”\n\nThe Winners\n\nAfter participating in the workshop and Quiz, here are the winners of the EBI 2024 organized by the Environmental Engineering Study Program and PUMA:\n\nScientific Paper:\n\n1st Place: Sunflower Team from SMK Negeri 2 Kraksaan, Probolinggo, East Java.\n\n2nd Place: Ainur Pinandita from SMA Negeri 1 Ungaran, Semarang, Central Java.\n\n3rd Place: Brilliant Research Club from MAN 4 Bantul, Yogyakarta.\n\nQuiz:\n\n1st Place: Chitra Sevanya from SMA Santo Thomas 2 Medan, North Sumatera.\n\n2nd Place: Isaura Nailah from SMA Negeri 1 Cicurug, Sukabumi, West Java.\n\n3rd Place: Najwa Laili from SMA Negeri 1 Yogyakarta.\n\n(Graciella V, PR team. Photo: Damar Satriawan)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing very rapidly today. There are now more and more applications that are produced by AI. This is what drives the widespread and diverse use of AI. AI has now become an important part of people’s lives.\n\nThis phenomenon is also felt at President University (Presuniv). That is why the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science, Rila Mandala, Ph.D., initiated training on artificial intelligence. To realize his idea, Rila then contacted Dr. Nusirwan, S.Ag., M.Si., Head of the Center for Research and Development, Resources, Devices, and Implementation of Post and Informatics (Puslitbang SDPPPI), Ministry of Communication and Information (Kominfo). “It so happens that there is an alumnus of the Information Technology Study Program, Riza Azmi, who works at Kominfo,” said Rila.\n\nKominfo was willing to provide training. Finally, on Thursday, July 4, 2024 in the Charles Himawan Auditorium, A Building 5th Floor, Presuniv Campus on Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Jababeka City, Cikarang, Presuniv, and Kominfo held the Google Generative AI Workshop training event. Google and Digitalent also collaborated in this training event.\n\nFinding Talent\n\nRila Mandala, Ph.D. said to all participants, “This training is very useful. So, study seriously. All the material given in this training will be widely used by you in the future.” Rila also did not forget to thank Kominfo, Google, and Digitalent for their support in the AI training.\n\nIn line with Rila, Nusirwan also explained the importance of mastering knowledge about AI for the future. In addition, said Nusirwan, the government is currently also looking for talented people to develop AI-based innovations. “This is because Kominfo does not want our nation to only become AI users. We want our nation to be creators.,” he said, firmly.\n\nThat is why Nusirwan conveyed a message to all participants to learn carefully how AI contributes to various fields, including the economy. “In the future, AI will become increasingly important,” he stressed.\n\nBeware of AI\n\nGoogle Cloud Customer Solutions Consultant Ardhan Yoga revealed that many people are still unaware of the dangers of editing photos with AI-based applications. “This is because people’s understanding of various AI-based websites is still low. Even though these websites may use the data they provide,” said Ardhan.\n\nFor example, continued Ardhan, AI will use the data that has been given by users as a content database for various other AI applications. “So it is possible that the photos we send, and then the photos we edited with AI-based applications, will be used as a database for other AI content. Then, when people requested for photos with our characteristics with the application, the results can be very similar to the photos that we sent before,” explained Ardhan. This is dangerous, emphasized Ardhan, again.\n\nAI technology has indeed developed very rapidly, especially since 2017. In that year, AI technology could only process data in text form. However, along with the development of technology, now the data that can be processed by AI is increasingly diverse. There are text, images, audio, and even videos.\n\nAccording to Cliff Tangel, Customer Solutions Consultant Google Cloud, many people are not ready to face these changes. He explained, “Actually there are many things we can do if we can use AI well. If we understand how to create our own AI, or use AI well, we can create AI according to our wishes.” Cliff explained further, for example, we want to research an interesting topic, AI can even help us find relevant journals.” (Graciella V, PR team.

Some participants attended offline at Widya Graha, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) Campus, Jl. Gatot Subroto, Jakarta, while others joined via Zoom. Endi is a lecturer in the International Relations Study Program, at the Faculty of Humanities, President University (Presuniv), and also the Director of the Center for Development, Empowerment, &Policy (CEDEP). The seminar, a collaboration between BRIN, Presuniv, and the Indonesian Researchers Association, was attended by representatives from local governments across Indonesia.\n\n“This seminar is a result of the cooperation agreement between BRIN and the Faculty of Humanities, Presuniv,” said Dr. M. Syafi’i Anwar, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities, who was also present at the event. Meanwhile, in his opening remarks, President University Rector Handa S. Abidin, SH, L.LM, Ph.D., highlighted the numerous requests for regional expansion from various areas. He said, “In fact, to date, several newly formed regions have not succeeded in improving the welfare of their communities. Hopefully, today’s seminar will provide us with solutions so that regional expansion can benefit the people.”\n\nIn the seminar, Endi presented a paper titled Regional Structuring in Indonesia: Between Political, Economic, and Public Service Interests. According to Endi, successful local governments will solve half of Indonesia’s problems. “If the performance of local governments is good, even if the performance of the central government is poor, the people will still benefit from state policies and the good performance of provincial or district/city governments,” he stated.\n\nEndi then elaborated on the objectives versus the reality of regional autonomy. He explained, “Regional autonomy aims to improve services. However, it also spreads corruption, collusion, and nepotism (KKN) to the regions. Autonomy aims to strengthen democracy, but it also strengthens nepotism, political dynasties, and inter-regional conflicts.” One of the goals of autonomy, Endi continued, is equitable development and regional empowerment. “Yet, in terms of finance, regions are still dependent on the center. Autonomy is also expected to improve people’s welfare, but what often happens is excessive exploitation of natural resources, increased regional taxes and levies, and environmental degradation,” he elaborated.\n\nGiven these conditions, Endi concluded that the goals of regional autonomy have not been achieved. “Amid such conditions, what now emerges is the desire for regional expansion or the creation of new autonomous regions, which is heavily politically motivated,” he remarked. Despite the disappointing achievements of regional autonomy, Endi believes the situation can still be salvaged.\n\nSome recommendations proposed by Endi include the optimization of e-government, integrated evaluation, and selective regional expansion, increasing local revenue (PAD) through the revitalization of Regional-Owned Enterprises (BUMD), and boosting PAD through new schemes such as carbon trade or debt for environment swaps.

Marbles? Dakon? Stilts? Benteng-bentengan?\n\nZhana is not even sure which traditional games she will encounter during her visit to Solo, Central Java. However, this uncertainty only fuels her excitement. A student of the Communication Study Program, Faculty of Humanities, President University (Presuniv), Zhana can’t remember the last time she engaged in traditional games, known in Javanese as dolanan.\n\n“I am so excited. Even though this is a field study, and there are group and individual assignments to complete, I am very enthusiastic,” she said.\n\nNot only Zhana, but other fieldwork participants also share her enthusiasm. Moreover, the activities scheduled for July 4-7, 2024, involve students from other study programs who are taking eight different courses.\n\nThese courses include Literacy in Education and School Culture from the Elementary School Teacher Education (ESTE, Pendidikan Guru Sekolah Dasar or PGSD) Study Program, and Investigative Reporting, Creative Writing, Television Feature, Documentary, Film Theory, and Political Communication from the Communication Study Program.\n\nAccording to Ani Pudjiastuti, Head of the ESTE Program, “ESTE students will observe inclusive curricula and examine school cultures that can enhance literacy for all students.” Two ESTE lecturers will accompany them: Grace Amialia A. Neolaka and Ryan Besa Estillomo from the Philippines.\n\nIn Solo, they will visit several dolanan studios and interview elementary school teachers who incorporate children’s traditional games as local content in their curriculum.\n\nFinding Figures\n\nDuring their stay in Solo, the students will conduct fieldwork in various areas and through different methods. For instance, students enrolled in the Political Communication course will interview representatives from the General Election Commission and the Election Supervisory Body in Surakarta, as well as political parties and analysts.\n\nAs a note, Solo and Surakarta are essentially the same. Surakarta is the official or administrative name, while Solo is used for branding the city.\n\nIn recent years, Solo has become central in Indonesian politics. This is because the current President, Joko Widodo, and the elected Vice President for the 2024-2029 period come from the same family from Solo.\n\nSolo also played a key role in the 2024 Presidential Election, particularly between candidates number 2 and 3, Prabowo-Gibran and Ganjar-Mahfud.\n\nMeanwhile, students taking the Creative Writing course will observe various places in Solo, studying the local culture and daily lives of its people. “We are tasked with using Solo as the geographical and cultural setting for the short stories we will create. Our main task is to find people who will become characters in our stories and to observe so that the setting and culture depicted are accurate,” said Sena, a Creative Writing student.\n\nMost of the other courses fall under the realm of journalism. Students will produce reports and documentaries related to children’s traditional games in Solo. Their planned coverage includes examining these games from a gender perspective, as a medium for transmitting family and community values, their marginalization in the face of gadgets and the internet, and their monetization potential.\n\n“At President University, we combine theory and practice. Fieldwork like this allows students to deepen their understanding of the theories they have learned by seeing the facts directly in the field,” said M. Raudy Gathmyr, Head of the Communication Study Program.\n\nRaudy acknowledged that this activity could be conducted anywhere. “We chose Solo because it is politically central and its cultural heritage, including traditional games, is relatively well-preserved. So, one city is suitable for exploring the eight courses mentioned,” he continued. (Achmad Supardi, Communication Studies lecturer. Photos: Communication Studies and PR Doc.).\n\nHere’s the case. John, who lives in a rural area in East Kalimantan, is facing a land dispute. However, from a legal perspective, he is unsure about the exact nature of his problem.\n\nThere’s another case. Let’s call it PT Angin Ribut, a multinational company headquartered in Jakarta. This company has many employees on its legal team and is currently dealing with several legal issues. Despite having a large legal team, Angin Ribut still needs to hire external lawyers.\n\nAnother example is the law firm XYZ, which handles a variety of cases. Its clients range from individuals to corporations, and XYZ has around 80 lawyers. Does XYZ really need so many lawyers?\n\nThese were the topics discussed by Richard Sianturi, Founder & CEO of PT Solusi Hukum Merata, also known as Korner, during a guest lecture on Monday, June 24, 2024. The guest lecture, titled How Legal Technology Transforms Business and Legal Sectors, was organized by the Law Study Study Program, Faculty of Humanities, President University (Presuniv), and took place at the Fabrication Laboratory, President University Convention Center, Jl. H. Usmar Ismail, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang. Dr. Ir. Robert P. Radjagoekgoek, S.Sos, SH, MH, Head of the Legal Study Program was present at the guest lecture and gave opening remarks.\n\nRising Legal Costs\n\nThose were some illustrations of legal cases. So, what kinds of legal cases actually occur in society, and how do people resolve their legal issues?\n\nCiting a 2019 survey by the Indonesia Judicial Research Society (IJRS) involving 2,040 respondents, Richard explained the types of legal cases that occur in our society. Criminal cases ranked highest at 43%, followed by family or child-related disputes at 32%, land and environmental disputes at 30%, housing disputes at 30%, health-related disputes at 21%, and security or other social issues at 17%. It’s worth noting that respondents could choose more than one option in this survey, which is why the total percentage exceeds 100%.\n\nAccording to the same IJRS survey, 36% of respondents chose to use legal assistance to resolve their issues, while the remaining 64% did not. Why did they choose not to use legal assistance? The reasons were twofold: 60% of respondents feared the complicated legal process, and 39% were concerned that the results would not be satisfactory.\n\nThat’s what’s happening in society, at least according to the IJRS survey. What about legal issues in corporations?\n\nAn article published on http://www.legaldive.com in June 2023 revealed that corporate legal costs increased by 29%, from $2.4 million to $3.1 million. If this amount is converted at an exchange rate of Rp16,500 per US dollar, it means that average legal spending rose from Rp39.6 billion to Rp51.15 billion. The most significant increase in legal spending occurred in large companies with revenues above $20 billion (Rp330 trillion), where average legal costs rose by 57%, from $50.8 million to $80 million.\n\nAnother note from the survey is that 53% of all legal costs are spent on internal legal matters, while the remaining 47% are used to pay for external legal services.\n\nThe Role of Technology\n\nCan technology help reduce legal costs? In the legal world, technology is used in several ways. First, to manage various documents by converting them from print to digital formats. There are various applications for this, such as DocuSign, Contractbook, Doxflow, iManage, and others. Managing documents this way offers many benefits, including easier searchability, increased security, and cost savings. Companies at least do not need to spend on paper and require less space for document storage.\n\nSecond, technology can also be used to provide legal services. For example, AI-based chatbot applications can facilitate legal question-and-answer services for users. Such services are very helpful as they can be accessed quickly, anytime, and from anywhere.\n\nThird, there are also legal research and analysis applications, such as lynn legal, InView, casetext, and even ChatGPT. These applications are certainly needed by companies or law firms.\n\nThere are several other applications related to legal services globally, including those for compliance and privacy, e-Discovery, legal front door platforms, e-billing, legal design, and workflow automation. According to Richard Susskind, “Automation is what most professionals have in mind when they think of the relevance of technology for their disciplines.” Susskind, a British author, public speaker, and advisor to international institutions and governments, emphasizes the importance of technology in professional fields.\n\nThe Future of Law Firms\n\nSome of these applications are offered by Korner. According to its website, Korner is an open-access platform providing AI-based legal services. Their services include legal education and connecting clients with legal service providers.\n\nFounded in 2020, Korner now serves users in 26 provinces in Indonesia, as well as clients from Malaysia and the United States. On his LinkedIn profile, Richard writes, “Korner’s vision is to become a company that encompasses the full legal ecosystem, from education to legal services, with technological innovation.” He adds, “In 2024, we aim to make legal services easier, more affordable, and more accessible.”\n\nKorner currently offers two main services: Korner Academy and Korner Licensing. Korner Academy focuses on legal training through various classes and topics, with diverse speakers, some of which are conducted online.\n\nMeanwhile, through Korner Licensing, users can find legal service providers related to licensing, such as for establishing PTs, CVs, and foundations, handling licensing documents, drafting and reviewing legal documents, and translation services.\n\nWill Korner’s services and other similar services represent the future of law firms? Possibly! (JB Susetiyo, PR team.

Rezal, along with the discussion moderator, Muhammad Sigit Andhi Rahman Ph.D., stood among the students.\n\nSigit is a lecturer in the International Relations Study Program, Faculty of Humanities, at President University. The study program organized the guest lecture titled “Pursuing Career and Entrepreneurial Opportunities in the Restoration Economy” on Thursday, June 20, 2024.\n\nFrom all of the students present that morning in the Charles Himawan Auditorium on the 5th floor of the Presuniv campus at Jababeka Education Park, only a few raised their hands. While all the students might be familiar with the concept of a forest, only a few had actually ventured into one.\n\nRezal then asked another question, “Who among you has ever seen a kantong semar or pitcher plant?” Again, only a small number of students raised their hands, while others exchanged puzzled looks. Some students may not know what a kantong semar is or may have heard about it for the first time. Others might have only seen it in nature documentaries, never experiencing it firsthand in the wild.\n\nRezal explained that the kantong semar is a carnivorous plant that feeds on insects or other small animals that enter its pitcher-shaped trap. These plants are commonly found in tropical rainforests, especially in lowland areas, peat forests, and even savannas. “The kantong semar is part of the complex forest ecosystem,” he noted.\n\nThe Disappearance of Insects\n\nRMU, founded in 2007 by Dharsono Hartono, who is now the CEO, and Rezal Kusumaatmadja as COO, is headquartered in Bogor, West Java. The company focuses on restoring ecosystems, including forest ecosystems. “In the past, some companies were granted concessions to log forests. Trees were cut down, and the wood was sold to be processed into various furniture products. We, at RMU, do the opposite. We are granted concessions not to log forests,” explained Rezal.\n\nAccording to the company website, in 2013, RMU was initially granted a restoration concession area of 108.225 hectares (now RMU is managing 157,9 thousand hectares areas of peatland forest, or twice the size of Singapore, which is only 73 thousand hectares) in two districts in Central Kalimantan, East Kotawaringin and Katingan.\n\nIn Katingan, RMU developed the Katingan Mentaya Project (KMP), a REDD+ project (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The core concept of REDD+ is that industrialized countries should contribute to reducing carbon emissions through various schemes, one of which is funding developing countries to prevent deforestation and degradation.\n\nDeforestation occurs due to forest logging. Large-scale deforestation or opening of peatlands leads to carbon emissions, which contribute to greenhouse gases and global warming—a phenomenon we are currently experiencing. Preventing forest degradation is essential to preserving biodiversity. If deforestation continues, the number and diversity of flora and fauna will decrease, which is dangerous. “We have already witnessed the near extinction of some animal species,” said Rezal.\n\nFireflies used to be abundant, but now they are rarely seen, especially in urban areas. Many other insect species are also disappearing. Some young people from Generation Z might never have heard of cicadas, which used to signal the onset of the dry season. The disappearance of insects can potentially lead to disasters for humanity, as insects like cicadas play a crucial role in human life ecosystems.\n\nAccording to the journal Biological Conservation published in February 2020 and quoted by Kompas, one million animal and plant species on Earth are threatened with extinction, half of which are insects.\n\nReducing Carbon\n\nIn addition to supporting efforts to prevent deforestation and degradation through funding, developed countries’ support for REDD+ can also include technology. Recently, the + in REDD+ has been associated with carbon emissions from forests.\n\nRMU through its pilot project The KMP in Central Kalimantan aims to prevent deforestation and forest degradation, prevent species loss due to habitat destruction, and empower local communities living around the forests.\n\nFor example, according to the website, through ecosystem restoration efforts, including reforestation and protecting forests from fires and illegal logging, RMU prevents 7.45 million tons of carbon emissions annually. RMU claims that through KMP, they have prevented greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to over 31.94 million tons of CO2.\n\nEfforts to empower local communities aim to shift their livelihoods from logging or slash-and-burn agriculture to new sources of income. RMU’s website shares stories of individuals like Ardani from Satiruk Village in East Kotawaringin, who transitioned from logging to raising chickens. And, Wahid from Babirah Village, who now crafts coconut shells. Indri and several women and girls from Hantipan Village now produce virgin coconut oil, while Yusan has become a rattan craftsman.\n\nAs a business entity, RMU also establishes business units. Rezal noticed that in some KMP areas in Hanaut Island and Teluk Sampit, Central Kalimantan, some farmers had coconut plantations. “Unfortunately, the selling price of coconuts is still low,” said Rezal. Since 2018, RMU has partnered with local NGOs to develop training centers for processing coconuts into coconut sugar, a project they call Mentaya Sweet. RMU also connects farmers to national supply chains and introduces them to micro-financing products.\n\nRestorative and Ecosystem, Not Egosystem\n\nRezal elaborated on the concept of the restorative economy practiced by RMU. He provided an illustration of a project by PT Alam Siak Lestari (ASL) in Siak Regency, Riau, which collaborates with local communities and was a finalist in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Solve Challenge 2021 under the theme Resilient Ecosystems.\n\nIn Siak, peatland fires often cause haze, disrupting aviation services and spreading to neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore. Despite government policies to protect peatlands, locals still seek income from these areas by logging and slash-and-burn practices, causing widespread haze.\n\nASL devised a business model to help the community earn a living while preserving the environment. Since 2020, ASL has taught Siak residents to cultivate snakehead fish on peatlands. The fish are sold to ASL, which processes them into three products: snakehead fish albumin extract, fish meat flour, and organic fertilizer from the heads and tails.\n\nThis method encourages Siak residents to keep peatlands wet and irrigated, as dry peatlands cannot sustain snakehead fish cultivation. If demand for albumin rises, the need for snakehead fish will also increase, leading to more peatland restoration for fish farming. The broader the area used for snakehead fish cultivation, the more peatland is restored, reducing the risk of peatland fires. This is the concept of a restorative economy.\n\nThis is the concept that RMU continues to develop in Katingan and Kotawaringin Timur. “We want to nurture the ecosystem, not the egosystem,” emphasized Rezal. By “egosystem,” Rezal refers to human actions that exploit natural resources excessively and irresponsibly. Through these restorative efforts, RMU aims to build a sustainable business and leave a comfortable Earth for future generations. (JB Susetiyo, PR team.

Reza Alkahfi, Head of Information and Communication Technology at the Directorate General of Immigration, Ministry of Law and Human Rights, delivered a guest lecture at room A429, Building A, President University campus, located on Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Jababeka Education Park, Cikarang. The lecture, organized by the Law Study Program of the Faculty of Humanities at President University (Presuniv), focused on the Modernization of Indonesia’s Immigration System. Attendees included the Rector of Presuniv, Handa S. Abidin, SH, L.LM, Ph.D., the Head of the Law Study Program, Dr. Ir. Robert P. Radjagoekgoek, S.Sos, SH, MH, along with several lecturers, staff, and students.\n\nIn his presentation, Reza explained the four functions of immigration in Indonesia: the service functions including passport issuance, security or state protection, law enforcement, and acting as a facilitator of economic development, particularly through investment. “For service functions, such as the issuance of regular or expedited passports, each applicant must first register through the m-passport application. If the applicant is ill or faces urgent circumstances, passports can be issued through a walk-in system,” he explained.\n\nWith the walk-in system, applicants do not need to register in advance through the m-passport application but can go directly to the immigration office. However, the number of passports issued through the walk-in system is limited. “That’s why those who wish to apply for a passport through the walk-in system need to arrive early at the local immigration office,” Reza added. Additionally, there is a priority walk-in system for individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, children under five, and the elderly.\n\nFor serving foreign citizens, Reza revealed that the Directorate General of Immigration has also developed the Molina application. This app allows foreign nationals to apply for a Visa on Arrival (e-VoA) and extend their visit permits for e-VoA holders.\n\nOne of the latest applications developed by the Directorate General of Immigration is the Face Recognition Identification system, this is particularly for foreign citizens who enter Indonesia. “Since it is intended for foreign citizens, the Face Recognition application is currently only implemented at airports that handle international flights,” Reza stated.\n\nDuring the lecture, Reza also discussed various other developments by the Directorate General of Immigration, including the Border Control Management application and the establishment of national immigration security offices.

Warmadewa University organized this event. It was an individual event and served as a platform for students who have startup businesses or are already entrepreneurs.\n\nFito mentioned that he got the information about this competition from SetSail. Initially, he wasn’t interested in registering due to his busy schedule, but two days before the registration closed, he decided to join because he was intrigued by the international scale of the competition. His primary intention in joining the competition was to improve his English communication skills. After registering, he submitted a proposal about his startup business, PT. Tococo Indonesia Berkah.\n\nThe total number of participants was unknown since only the top 10 finalists were announced. The finalists included participants from Indonesia and Vietnam in Asia, and the judges were an international panel. Fito shared that participating in this event allowed him to showcase his business, which is a zero-waste company specializing in coconut products. His products include coconut chips, coconut cooking oil, coconut chocolate, coconut coffee, coconut soy sauce, coconut sugar, and more. Each participant was given about 5 minutes to present their product concisely and clearly. The feedback from the judges significantly impacted his business, providing insights on improving for the future. The international judges emphasized the importance of creating businesses that benefit the environment and society.\n\nFito expressed his surprise at winning 2nd place. He did not expect to achieve this ranking as the other participants, and their businesses were highly innovative and impressive. When the results were announced, starting from the 6th place, he had little hope of winning. However, when his company’s name was called for 2nd place, he was overwhelmed with mixed emotions of joy and disbelief that his company was recognized and had a promising future.\n\nThe criteria for participating in the event required the business to be operational, have traction, receive customer feedback, be innovative, and ensure the products were marketable and zero-waste. Additionally, the business needed to have a positive environmental and social impact.\n\nFito’s message to the readers is, “Always believe in whatever business you are running and consistently develop it for the future.” – Alfito Yuro Yudistiro\n\nOn Wednesday, May 29, 2024, the Management Study Program (MGT) of the Faculty of Business at President University (Presuniv) received a visit from Binus University at Wouw Cafe & Resto Country Club, Jababeka Golf & Country Club, Cikarang, Bekasi.

The event was led by Prof. Luiz Moutinho, BA, MA, Ph.D., MAE, FCIM. The seminar, was attended by Vice Rector for Academic, Research, and Innovation Dr. Adhi Setyo Santoso, ST, MBA, Dean of the Faculty of Business Dr. Iman Permana, BS(PE), MM, various heads of study programs, faculty members, staff, and students of Presuniv, was held at the Fabrication Laboratory, President University Convention Center (PUCC), Jl. H. Usmar Ismail, Kota Jababeka, Cikarang.\n\nAccording to Adhi Setyo Santoso, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education in Indonesia is still relatively new. Adhi continued, “The application of AI, which was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, continues to present both pros and cons.” How should academics position themselves amidst the dynamic movement of AI? “Perhaps we can learn from Prof. Moutinho, who has extensive experience with AI through his teaching at various prominent universities abroad,” Adhi stated.\n\nThe Future Campus\n\nIn his presentation during the seminar, Prof. Moutinho asserted that AI will be a defining technology in the 21st-century education sector. “Much like the invention of the microprocessor in the 20th century,” he said. AI, according to Prof. Moutinho, it has already become the driving force behind various technologies, such as Big Data, Robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and continues to innovate future technologies.\n\nHow will universities of the future look with the advent of AI? “Campuses will increasingly use AI-based technologies, such as Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality, robotics, 3D printing, AI chatbots, virtual environments, and much more. All these technologies make campuses smarter, known as smart campuses,” explained Prof. Moutinho.\n\nOne interesting application of AI is in the field of research. According to Prof. Moutinho, AI and machine learning algorithms can process and analyze large datasets much faster than humans. “These software tools can even uncover new information, patterns, and correlations,” he revealed. This makes research processes quicker, more precise, and more accurate.\n\nDigital Divide\n\nProf. Moutinho is optimistic that integrating AI into higher education not only advances technology but will also enhance human intelligence, creativity, and ultimately, their well-being. However, he cautioned that the implementation of AI also presents challenges and consequences. Besides ethical issues, the application of AI could widen the gap between advanced and lagging universities.\n\nOn the following day, Friday, May 17, 2024, Prof. Moutinho conducted a workshop on how to use various AI-based platforms for academic research. He demonstrated several AI applications that can serve as assistants, help in writing research results, analyze various articles, and review literature.\n\n***\n\nOn Sunday, May 12, 2024, three students from the Accounting Study Program, Faculty of Business, President University (Presuniv), achieved first place in the EcoPreneur Challenge, held offline at Jakarta International Expo Kemayoran, North Jakarta. The three Accounting students from the 2021 cohort are Amanda Adelia Putri, Shafira Putri Ramadhanty, and Sri Cahayani. The EcoPreneur Challenge is a competition focused on creating business plans.\n\nWinning this competition is not their first achievement. Previously, they also won first place in the Sination Business Plan Competition held on July 16, 2023.\n\nAmanda, Shafira, and Sri shared their insights on creating the business plan that led them to victory. “The product concept for our business plan was a collaborative idea,” said Shafira. She added that their concept always focused on sustainability issues.\n\nSeeking Funding\n\n“Will you continue participating in various competitions?” They responded in unison, “Yes!” “Why?” They explained that the prize money would be saved as capital to start their business together. This drive motivated them to enter the EcoPreneur Challenge.\n\nThis competition was not easy. “We were overwhelmed, especially with the tight deadline,” said Amanda. They worked late into the night to complete their business plan proposal. “After classes, we started working on the proposal from 5 PM until 1 AM,” she shared. The different class schedules of Amanda, Shafira, and Sri also made it challenging to meet after classes.\n\n“How did you solve this?” “We decided to divide the tasks. This way, each team member had a clear responsibility,” Amanda explained. Otherwise, they would have to stay up until 3 AM every day.\n\nInstant Noodles from Corn Cobs\n\nThey once participated in a business plan competition with a product idea of herbal fever medicine but lost. However, they learned valuable lessons and were inspired by the team that won first place. “They made a business plan for food and beverages,” recalled Sri. “That’s why we shifted our focus from medicinal products to food and beverages.”\n\nFor the Sination 2023 competition, they created a business plan for instant noodles made from corn cobs. Why corn cobs? Amanda explained, “When we buy fresh corn, it is weighed with the cobs, which makes it heavier. When we use the corn, the cobs are discarded.” This inspired them to utilize the waste corn cobs. “Why not create instant noodles from corn cobs?” Amanda challenged herself and her team.\n\nThey developed this idea into a business plan and submitted it to the Sination 2023 Business Plan Competition on July 16, 2023. Amanda shared, “At that time, we had only prepared the outline of the business plan, not the details. The idea was there, but the product wasn’t.” They continued developing their product and presented their business plan with a rough product prototype at the competition. They won first place in the Sination 2023 Business Plan Competition. This success motivated them to further develop the idea of instant noodles from corn cobs.\n\nFeeling Insecure\n\nThis experience taught them how to create a good business plan. “When we first entered a competition, we didn’t know what to prepare. Now we do, but we still get nervous,” Shafira said with a smile. Sri added, “At first, we were so tense that we forgot what to explain. But with frequent participation in competitions, we became more prepared and confident.”\n\nShafira added enthusiastically, “In the EcoPreneur Challenge, we saw strong competitors and felt insecure. But we encouraged each other to let it flow. We were surprised to be announced as the winners, first place again,” Shafira recalled, met with laughter from Sri and Amanda.\n\nThey expressed their gratitude to the supportive lecturers, especially Ma’am Supeni, as they called Supeni Mapuasari, an Accounting lecturer. On her LinkedIn, Mapuasari wrote: “Turning waste into potential blessings. From corn cobs to low-calorie instant noodles. Delicious too! They have GRIT (growth mindset, resilience, integrity, & tenacity). Congratulations on winning first place at the EcoPreneur Challenge, Indonesia Franchise & License Expo. As the research advisor, this is a touching reward. We only provided a little knowledge and motivation. They delivered the achievement.”\n\nAccording to Sri, participating in competitions is important. “By joining many competitions, we learn from our experiences and gain inspiration.” Shafira added, “It also helps us overcome insecurity. We can feel insecure but shouldn’t let it stop us from progressing.”\n\nAt the end of the interview, Amanda advised, “Don’t always think about following others. If we have a unique idea, develop it. That’s what sets us apart.” Congratulations, Amanda, Shafira, and Sri. (Graciella V, PR team.

They traveled to Tlogopakis Village, Petungkriyono District, Pekalongan Regency, Central Java. The trip was themed An Environmental Awareness Journey: Sustainable Education Tour in Petungkriyono. The trip provided students with a holistic learning experience covering tropical forest ecosystems, forests, rural area development, and exploring local culture and traditions.\n\nThis journey was part of the course requirement to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and (SDG) 15 & Forest Politics in particular. During the trip, the students were guided by M. Sigit Andhi Rahman, Ph.D., a lecturer in the IR Study Program. Sigit stated, “Field studies like this play a crucial role in shaping future leaders who will be committed to preserving the Earth’s resources.”\n\nDuring the field trip, the students delved into the intricacies of tropical forest ecosystems. Led by experts, each session offered insights into the balance of flora and fauna, the importance of biodiversity, and the challenges faced in preserving these ecosystems amidst the pressures of modern development.\n\nAdditionally, the students actively participated in activities which focused on forest and rural development. They engaged with the local community to better understand sustainable practices in land use, natural resource management, and rural community empowerment. “This hands-on approach allowed the students the opportunity to understand the complexities associated with balancing economic development and environmental conservation,” Sigit remarked.\n\nDuring the field trip, the students also proposed innovations or ideas related to the use of local resources. For example, they suggested using coffee waste as plant fertilizer, facial exfoliating material, and as an alternative animal feed. They presented all these ideas and concepts to the local community.\n\nA Transformative Journey\n\nWhile in Petungkriyono, the students learned to play traditional gamelan music and the captivating Kuda Lumping dance. They also enjoyed the rich cultural heritage of Petungkriyono and explored the Lingga Yoni Nogopertolo archaeological site.\n\nThey explored the natural beauty of the area, including the stunning Curug Bajing waterfall and Welo Asri Ecotourism centre. They also observed beehives in the forest and discovered native flora and fauna such as the Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch) and the Surili monkey, and rare birds found only in this location. These activities provided the students with a rich experience and deepened their connection to the environment.\n\nArief Setiawan from the Relung Indonesia Foundation, an organization heavily involved in conservation efforts in Petungkriyono area, expressed his hopes. He said, “I hope activities like this are not just one-time events but can be done regularly every year and for longer periods. This way, the students can contribute knowledge and understanding to the community.”\n\nDuring the four days, the students not only gained knowledge but also developed a sense of responsibility and concern for the environment. Through interactive learning, dialogues with experts, and hands-on experiences, the students enriched their academic insights and gained a new commitment to advocating for sustainable practices in the future, including promoting conservation efforts that also benefit the local community.\n\nSigit remarked, “This field trip is a tangible form of Presuniv’s holistic education approach. Students are not only equipped with academic knowledge but also imbued with values of environmental awareness and social responsibility.” He hopes that when these students become future leaders and step into the real world, they will carry the lessons from Petungkriyono, recognising the transformative power of experiential education in creating a sustainable future for everyone. (JB Susetiyo, PR team. Report and photos: Shella and Tomy)\n\nLecturers from the Accounting Study Program, Faculty of Business, President University (Presuniv), in collaboration with the Office of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (KUKM) of Bekasi Regency, launched the 2024 UMKM Upgrading Program for the Province of West Java on Monday, May 6, 2024. This initiative aims to assist UMKM (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) entrepreneurs in establishing a well-structured and healthy financial management system. This collaboration was made possible because one of Presuniv’s lecturers, Filda Rahmiati, BBA, MBA, Ph.D., has been appointed as the Coordinator for the UMKM Upgrading Program in Bekasi Regency by the Dinas KUKM.\n\nUpon receiving this trust, Filda formed a team consisting of Dr. Supeni Anggraeni Mapuasari, SE, M.Sc., who also leads the project, along with two other lecturers, Chita Oktapriana, M.Ak., CSRS, CMA, and Vita Elisa Fitriana, SE, M.Sc. Coincidentally, each team member also runs their own UMKM business, giving them a firsthand understanding of the challenges of maintaining a healthy financial system without adequate financial management knowledge.\n\nSupeni explained, “We want to teach UMKM entrepreneurs how to maintain their financial health. They work hard to support their families. What happens if, due to a lack of financial management knowledge, all that hard work leads to losses instead of profits?” She emphasized that managing finances is crucial not only for ensuring UMKM businesses are profitable but also sustainable. “Sustainability is very important, especially since many UMKM entrepreneurs rely on their businesses to support their families,” Supeni stressed.\n\nSales Price and Break-Even Point\n\nSupeni’s colleagues, Vita and Chita, share the same enthusiasm. They have identified different problems. “Many of the UMKM entrepreneurs I’ve met struggle to determine the selling price of their products. Many set prices based on similar businesses, even though the raw materials used may not be the same,” Vita revealed. She added that many UMKM entrepreneurs do not account for the cost of their own labour.\n\nChita added that many UMKM entrepreneurs want their businesses to grow rapidly but are not well-prepared. “Due to social media virality, they attract many customers, leading to a shortage of tables and chairs. They then rush to find another location to expand, which is risky without proper preparation. Renting a shop can increase costs significantly, straining their finances,” Chita explained.\n\nThese various issues motivate them to help UMKM entrepreneurs upgrade their businesses by improving their financial literacy. The UMKM Upgrading Program conducted by the Accounting Study Program lecturers was attended by more than 40 UMKM entrepreneurs in Bekasi Regency. The activities included training from lecturers and business practitioners. Through this training, UMKM entrepreneurs received both theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\nOne of the practitioners present was Yusup Junaedi, S.Si., Chairman of Boss UMKM Cooperative in North Cikarang, who was also appointed by Dinas KUKM as an UMKM Mentor. Yusup stated, “It is important for UMKM entrepreneurs to analyze their break-even point (BEP) to calculate the minimum turnover needed to break even.” Yusup then taught all participants how to calculate the BEP.

This event was organized by PT Astra International Tbk. in collaboration with The Entrepreneurs Society, serving as a platform for starting businesses for SMEs across Indonesia.\n\nThe event was attended by around 800 SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). After a selection process, only 120 SMEs were chosen to proceed to the coaching stage. This selection was based on predetermined criteria, including SMEs that already had an established business and developed products. The program was open to all SMEs from all off Indonesia.\n\nFito shared his experience during the coaching sessions, where he received weekly training materials delivered by mentors. The materials covered management, financial management, marketing, operations, and branding. “Every weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, there were one-on-one meetings between participants and mentors to discuss the challenges they faced in their respective businesses,” Fito explained. Additionally, participants were given specific tasks, such as completing links and quizzes to test their understanding of the materials presented.\n\nFito expressed his joy at participating in this event. He said, “It’s hard to believe that my business was recognized as one of the leading SMEs. Especially since the other participants in this event were already well-established SMEs with impressive products.” Furthermore, Fito added, that the program included participants from all over Indonesia. He said, “When my product was tested and promoted by the founder of The Entrepreneurs Society and received very positive feedback from them, I felt happy and proud. The founder of The Entrepreneurs Society even mentioned that my product had a charming and captivating taste. That gave me a sense of satisfaction.”\n\nThere are various criteria for becoming a winner in the UMKM BISA event. These include evaluating the SME, the founder’s personality, and how they interact with their mentors. Other criteria include good behaviour, high enthusiasm, active participation in discussions, and achieving the highest scores in each task and quiz. Additionally, participants were expected to actively engage in the mentoring process by communicating the difficulties and challenges they faced in running their businesses. Another criterion was how they planned for the future.\n\nReflecting on his experience participating in the event, Fito shared, “We must believe in our product. Even when starting a business, we need to be confident that our product can go global and be trusted by buyers. We must believe and be confident that our product has a market.” (Damar Satriawan, PR team.

The program successfully obtained an Excellent accreditation from the Independent Accreditation Agency for Engineering (LAMTek), marking the highest level of achievement.\n\nThis accomplishment holds significant importance for the Mechanical Engineering Program, as well as for the Faculty of Engineering and Presuniv as a whole. According to Dr.Eng Lydia Anggraini, ST, M.Eng., Head of the Mechanical Engineering Study Program, there are several key points regarding the attainment of the Excellent accreditation. Firstly, “By obtaining the Excellent accreditation, it is a recognition that the quality of education in the Mechanical Engineering Study Program meets the standards set by LAMTek and national standards.”\n\nSecondly, with the Excellent accreditation, the sustainability of the program is further guaranteed. Lydia explains, “A program might face closure if the quality of its educational delivery is subpar. Achieving Excellent accreditation proves that the quality of education in the Mechanical Engineering Study Program is excellent. Therefore, the likelihood of closure is minimal, ensuring its sustainability.”\n\nThirdly, Lydia emphasizes that students feel more confident studying in the Mechanical Engineering Study Program at Presuniv. “This is because the quality of education is guaranteed and aligns with LAMTek standards. Therefore, the course delivery in the Mechanical Engineering Study Program is as excellent as that of any other university, including state universities. Students no longer need to search for alternative places to study Mechanical Engineering,” she elaborates.\n\nPreference in Career Opportunities\n\nThere are additional advantages for students who enroll in a program that has achieved an Excellent accreditation, especially concerning their careers in the professional world. Lydia explains, “If students aspire to work as Civil Servants (Pegawai Negeri Sipil or PNS), those who graduate from programs with Excellent accreditation will be prioritized over those accredited as Very Good or Good. This is advantageous for graduates seeking PNS positions.” Excellent accreditation, Lydia continues, also benefits students who wish to pursue higher education.\n\nThis situation differs for graduates aiming for careers in private companies. In the private sector, Lydia notes, whether graduates are accepted or not depends largely on the results of tests conducted by the company.\n\nThe journey of the Mechanical Engineering Study Program to achieve Excellent accreditation was quite extensive. Lydia recounts that all accreditation documents were submitted to LAMTek in May 2023. Subsequently, assessors conducted a visitation two months later, on July 4-5, 2023. “Two assessors came. Although the schedule was initially three days, the evaluation and assessment process practically took place over two days,” Lydia reveals.\n\nAfter the visitation, obtaining Excellent accreditation was not immediate. Lydia explains, “Following the visitation, the assessors provided feedback in August 2023, including requesting additional supporting documents. Therefore, we had to respond to the assessors’ feedback and supplement it with various other documents.”\n\nFinally, after undergoing this process, on December 21, 2023, the results of the evaluation and assessment were released, confirming that the Mechanical Engineering Study Program at Presuniv had successfully achieved Excellent accreditation. This achievement, Lydia expresses, aligns with the hard work put in by the Mechanical Engineering Study Program team and the full support from the Faculty of Engineering and Presuniv.
