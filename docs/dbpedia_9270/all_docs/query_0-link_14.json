        "text": "6 Dr Thomaz (personal communication, 11 Nov. 2009) suggests Manila in the Philippines as an example. However, it was a small Muslim trading port rather than a state or a capital city; see http://www.philippines.hvu.nl/Luzon4.htm and http://www.aenet.org/philip/manila.htm (both last accessed 13 April 2010).\n\n11 Groeneveldt, Willem P., ‘Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca, compiled from Chinese sources’, in Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China and the Indian Archipelago, 2nd series, vol. 1 (London: Trübner and Co., 1887 [1880]), pp. 135, 139, 141, 142 and 173 [Trübner Oriental Series]Google Scholar; Kern, Hendrik, ‘Over den Invloed der Indische, Arabische en Europese Beschaving op de Volken van den Indischen Archipel’, in Verspreide Geschriften, vol. 6, ed. Kern, H. (‘s-Gravenhage: Martinus Nijhoff, 1917), pp. 17–18Google Scholar. Dr Thomaz does not see this as excluding the possibility that it might have given rise to a toponym, however (personal communication, 11 Nov. 2009).\n\n13 For instance, Kern, ‘Over den Invloed’, p. 16; J.L. Moens, ‘Was Pūrnavarman van Tārumā Saura?’, een, Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 80 (1940): 78–109Google Scholar. Elsewhere, however, Kern, Hendrik, ‘De Invloed der Indische Beschaving op Java en Omliggende Eilanden’, in Verspreide Geschriften, vol. 15, ed. Kern, H. (‘s-Gravenhage: Martinus Nijhoff, 1928), p. 187Google Scholar, writes that there was no proof whatsoever of an Indian conquest, pointing instead to a lively trade. Jan Wisseman Christie further notes that it is probable that the population and its leaders were local people, perhaps under the tutelage of imported Brahmins. See Christie, Jan Wisseman, ‘State formation in early maritime Southeast Asia: A consideration of the theories and the data’, Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 151(1995): 258Google Scholar. This would, as Miksic, John N., ‘The classical cultures of Indonesia’, in Southeast Asia from prehistory to history, ed. Glover, Ian and Bellwood, Peter (London: Routledge Curzon, 2004), p. 237Google Scholar, observes, make the adoption of cultural elements from South Asia a ‘conscious intellectual exercise’ by Indonesian elites.\n\n15 Wheatley, Paul, Nāgara and commandery: Origins of Southeast Asian urban traditions (Chicago: University of Chicago, Department of Geography, 1983), p. 250, note 13Google Scholar. Nothing more is said about the Cape Comorin location and the two places might be identical, as Schnitger, Frederic M., ‘Tārumanāgara’, Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 74 (1934): 187Google Scholar, writes that the village Tarumapura is located about 10 miles north of Cape Comorin. This place, however, dates to the eleventh century CE (Stutterheim, Willem Frederik, ‘Note on the cultural relations between South-India and Java’, Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 79 (1939): 82Google Scholar; Dr Yellava Subbarayalu, personal communication, 11 Nov. 2009). Given this date and the rarity of the occurrence of the name, Dr Subbarayalu is not convinced that the name Tarumanagara was chosen using Tarumapuram as a model.\n\n21 Stutterheim, ‘Note’, p. 74 considers the script used in these inscriptions ‘so closely related to that of the Pallava charters of the fourth and fifth centuries, that one could assume a direct connection’, although, as Sarkar, Himansu B., ‘South-India in Old-Javanese and Sanskrit inscriptions’, Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 125, 2 (1969): 193CrossRefGoogle Scholar, notes, the script was not necessarily introduced by the Pallavas. Indeed, it has not been shown that the Pallava empire extended into West Java; see Stutterheim, ‘Note’, p. 82.\n\n30 The footprints symbolise ‘the three conquering and victorious footprints of Vishnu’; see Hall, Kenneth R., Maritime trade and state development in early Southeast Asia (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1985), p. 104Google Scholar. Vishnu, a minor deity in Vedic times, was said to stride through the universe in three steps; see Dowson, John, A classical dictionary of Hindu mythology and religion, geography, history, and literature (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972), p. 360Google Scholar; and Stutley, Margaret and Stutley, James, Harper's dictionary of Hinduism: Its mythology, folklore, philosophy, literature, and history (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1984), p. 336Google Scholar.\n\n34 Vogel, ‘The earliest’, p. 22; de Casparis, J.G. and Mabbett, Ian W., ‘Religion and popular beliefs of Southeast Asia before c. 1500’, in The Cambridge history of Southeast Asia, vol. 1, part 1: From early times to c. 1500, ed. Tarling, Nicholas (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 306Google Scholar note that the worship of footprints, especially Vishnu's, is found in India and Sri Lanka but that human and animal footprints are not worshipped there. The latter does exist in Indonesia, they continue, making it therefore likely that the emphasis on footprints in Pūrnavarman's inscriptions is the continuation of a traditional Austronesian practice. It is not clear, however, what the basis is for their statement that the footprints mentioned in the inscriptions were worshipped in Tarumanagara.\n\n44 Eleven kilometers (Tim Penyunting, Tarumanagara, p. 2). This claim is part of a larger Indonesian tradition in which rulers and holy-men cause canals and waterworks to miraculously come into existence (Bosch, Frederik D.K., ‘Guru, trident and spring’, in Selected Studies in Indonesian Archaeology, ed. Bosch, F.D.K. (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1961), pp. 153–70CrossRefGoogle Scholar [Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, Translation Series 5]. Actually digging 11 kilometers of canal in only 21 days would be an incredible feat of engineering, and some have speculated whether this was actually done (see Noorduyn and Verstappen, ‘Pūrnavarman's river-works’, p. 299). It is possible that the ruler ceremonially traced out the course of the canal, which was then to be completed at a later time.\n\n59 Vogel further wonders why immigrants from South India would use the names of North Indian rivers, but since these same names are also found in South India and Sri Langka, this ceases to be a problem.\n\n60 Similarly, Stutterheim, ‘Note’, p. 79, 81 discusses the symbolic use of the name Gangā in Java in an effort to create ‘a replica of the Holy Land of India’, which did not need to be 100 per cent correct geographically but did establish a supernatural connection.\n\n69 Continuing well into the seventeenth century (Guillot, Banten, pp. 54, 221, 224; see Andaya, Leonard Y., ‘Interactions with the outside world and adaptation in Southeast Asian society, 1500–1800’, in The Cambridge history of Southeast Asia, vol. 1, part 2: From c. 1500 to c. 1800, ed. Tarling, Nicholas (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 8Google Scholar.\n\n72 Javadvipa (see Wessing, ‘The Kraton-city and the realm’, p. 210). Prakrt or prakrit means vernacular non-Sanskrit Indic language; http://www.yourdictionary.com/prakrit (last accessed 7 Oct. 2009). Kern was referring here to usage among common folk such as sailors and traders rather than among those learned in Sanskrit who used the name Yavadvipa in e.g. the Ramayana, as Dr Thomaz points out (personal communication, 11 Nov. 2009).\n\n75 See Guillot, Banten, pp. 124, 221, 242–3. These connections were not restricted to West Java. In the eleventh century CE, Tamils seem to have either settled in Sumatra or to have worked with the local people, while a thirteenth-century CE Tamil inscription from Burma documents the presence of a Vaisnava temple there (Sastri Nilakanta, K.A., ‘A Tamil merchant-guild in Sumatra’, Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 72 (1932): 314, 325Google Scholar; compare Oudheidkundige Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indië, Oudheidkundig Verslag 1912 ('s-Gravenhage, Martinus Nijhoff, 1912), p. 46 [Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen]; Suhadi, Machi, ‘Silsilah Adityawarman’, Kalpataru Majalah Arkeologi, 9 (1990): 227–8)Google Scholar.\n\n78 The Tamil is த௫மம் which is pronounced tarumam. Lifco, , The Lifco dictionary: Tamil-Tamil and English (Madras: Nagaraj and Co., 1966), p. 335Google Scholar glosses tarumam with law, sacred law, usage, practice and justice, which is also the meaning of the Sanskrit dharma: ‘that which is established or firm, law, usage, customary observance, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, religion, good works’ etc (Zoetmulder, Old Javanese-English dictionary, p. 367). I must here note Dr Subbarayalu's reservation that the word tarumam as a gloss for the Sanskrit dharma ‘is met with only rarely either in Tamil literature or inscriptions at such an early date as the 4th or 5th century CE’ (personal communication, 11 Nov. 2009).\n\n97 Much like today's Old Javanese texts in wayang (puppet presentation) are (Becker, Anton L., ‘Text-building, epistemology, and aesthetics in Javanese shadow theatre’, in The imagination of reality: Essays in Southeast Asian coherence systems, ed. Becker, Anton L. and Yengoyan, Aram A. (Norwood: Ablex Publishing Co., 1979), pp. 230–1)Google Scholar."
