It serves as a significant commuter city within the Jakarta Metropolitan Area, also known as Jabodetabek, which is the largest metropolitan area in Indonesia. According to the 2020 Census by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Bekasi had a population of 2,543,676. By mid-2023, the population was estimated to have increased to 2,627,207, with a near-even split between males (1,320,682) and females (1,306,525).\n\nBekasi has a rich historical background, being one of the oldest cities in Indonesia. It was once the capital city of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara, known as Dayeuh Sundasembawa or Jayagiri. Historical evidence, such as the Tugu inscription dating back to the fifth century, highlights the city’s ancient roots. The name Bekasi evolved from the Sanskrit word “Candrabhaga,” which, over time and through various linguistic transformations, became “Bhagasasi” and eventually “Bekasi” during Dutch colonial rule.\n\nGeographically, Bekasi is strategically positioned. It is bordered by Bekasi Regency to the north and east, Bogor Regency and Depok City to the south, and East Jakarta to the west. This prime location has made Bekasi an integral part of the Jakarta Metropolitan Area, providing essential residential and commercial support to the capital city.\n\nCulturally, Bekasi is a melting pot, reflecting the diverse ethnic backgrounds of its residents. Traditional Sundanese influences are prominent, especially in local cuisine, music, and dance. The city celebrates various cultural festivals that showcase its rich heritage and community spirit.\n\nEconomically, Bekasi has transformed from an agricultural base to a significant industrial and commercial hub. The city hosts numerous industrial zones and multinational companies, contributing significantly to the regional economy. It is a vital center for manufacturing, with a focus on automotive, electronics, and consumer goods industries. The rapid urbanization has also spurred the growth of residential developments, shopping centers, and business districts, making Bekasi a thriving urban center.\n\nThe city’s infrastructure has seen considerable improvements to support its growing population and economic activities. The expansion of road networks, public transportation systems, and residential areas has facilitated smoother commuting and enhanced the quality of life for its residents. Bekasi’s connectivity to Jakarta and other surrounding regions makes it an attractive location for businesses and residents alike.\n\nBekasi’s human resources are characterized by a young and dynamic workforce, driven by the presence of educational institutions and vocational training centers. These institutions provide a steady stream of skilled professionals who support the city’s various industries. The city also benefits from a strong entrepreneurial spirit, with many small and medium-sized enterprises contributing to its economic landscape.\n\nIn summary, Bekasi is a rapidly growing city that blends historical significance with modern development. Its strategic location, diverse culture, robust economy, and well-developed infrastructure make it a vital part of the Jakarta Metropolitan Area. As Bekasi continues to evolve, it remains a key player in Indonesia’s urban and economic landscape."
