        "text": "The Architectural Undergraduate Study Program at Tarumanagara University presents an exhibition featuring 12 of the best works from the 32nd Final Project of Architectural Design Studio (STUPA). The implementation of STUPA 8 is based on a design studio and is carried out online for a full semester during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe main theme of TGA 8.32 this time is “Rethinking Typology”. Where Type is an abstract essence that can represent a group on the basis of the similarity of the original image. Because it is an essence, the application of type into a formal structure can also be shaped by local socio-cultural and economic factors, so that it appears as a model. Knowing the typologies of the building is very important because it will be a starting point for designing. 'type' as a continuous sequence of form and space, allows working quickly to define the parts of a unique design. Through the study of typologies, it will provide tactics and strategies in building continuity in the city. (Agustinus Sutanto)\n\nPublic Expose 8.32 is a Final Project exhibition for the Bachelor of Architecture Study Program, Department of Architecture and Planning, Faculty of Engineering, Tarumanagara University, Jakarta, Indonesia in Odd Semester 2021/2022. Each work in this exhibition tries to creatively find the type of design choice and apply it in the form of architectural designs. Each work tells how architecture plays a role in recognizing the role and development of type, so that it has the artistic ability to form a new typology.\n\nPublic Expose 8.32 virtual exhibition at Public Expose 8.32 website and open judging will be open to the public on February 11st, 2022 via Zoom\n\nJuries:\n\n- Prof. Yandi Andri Yatmo, S.T., M. Arch., Ph.D. (Professor of architecture at Universitas Indonesia)\n\n- Vincent Heryanto, S.Ars., M.Sc. (Architectural Executive at DP Architects)\n\nFor further information, contact us\n\nEmail: pe.ars.untar832@gmail.com\n\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/pe.ars.untar/\n\nYoutube : Public Expose Universitas Tarumanagara\n\nTitle: Public Expose 8.32\n\nType: Exhibition\n\nWebsite: www.publicexpose832.com\n\nOrganization: Tarumanagara University\n\nFrom: February 7, 2022 01:00 PM\n\nUntil: February 18, 2022 11.30\n\nLocation: Jakarta/ Virtual exhibition at Public Expose 8.32 website\n\nAddress: Tarumanagara University, Jl.
