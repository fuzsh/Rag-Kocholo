        "text": "We’d like to take the opportunity to introduce you to one of our Honorable mention winners for our \"The Home of Shadows\" competition – Frans Michael, Juan Nathanie Wilianto, Madeline Louis Lewinski and Daniel from Indonesia!\n\nHonorable mention winners from Indonesia\n\nWe are 3rd year architecture students from Tarumanagara University which is located in West Jakarta, Indonesia. As we are approaching our final year, we have actively participated in architecture competitions and design projects involving problem-solving, contextual analysis, and spatial planning. Throughout the initial two years, we have developed strong communication skills as well as technical skills that has been honed due to long hours of practice and dedication in this field.\n\nBrief information about the projects that you/your company have been involved with. For instance, what scale have you focused on/preferred, any significant projects where the company/ individuals have been involved?\n\nAs architecture students at Tarumanagara University, we have collectively studied for nearly four years and completed six architectural studios together. These studios encompassed a wide range of projects, spanning from small-scale human-centric concept installations to high-rise building designs. Now, in our final semester, we have decided to enter this competition as a team, combining our diverse perspectives and unique design approaches. Each team member has individually explored different realms of architectural design, including co-living buildings, micro housing, religious building, and co-working spaces. These varied experiences have equipped us with the ability to tackle design challenges from multiple angles, ensuring a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to problem-solving.\n\nWhat does architecture mean to you and what is the role of an architect in your society?\n\nArchitecture, to us, is a combination of art, creativity and deep knowledge that eventually becomes a part of our lifestyle which we truly love. It influences our day to day life more than we realize, and it concretely shapes the way our surroundings and society works. With the presence of an architect our surrounding society has the ability to constantly move forward into a more innovative, sustainable and creative direction.\n\nWhy do you participate in architecture competitions?\n\nWe have actively participated in architectural competitions to enhance our overall knowledge of architecture. Additionally, we strive to engage in larger-scale competitions to test our skills and gauge the extent of our current knowledge.\n\nWhat advice would you give to individuals who struggle to decide whether it would be beneficial for them to participate in architecture competitions?\n\nFor individuals unsure about participating in architecture competitions, our advice is to first understand their goals and motivations, considering whether they seek professional recognition, skill development, or creative expression. They should then evaluate the competition's relevance, benefits, time commitment, associated costs, and seek guidance from mentors or professionals in the field to make an informed decision."
