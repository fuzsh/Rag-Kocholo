This Indonesian city is home to some 11.5 million people and has been in continual existence since the 4th century.\n\nIt was an important trading port right from the 4th century, under the Tarumanagara Kingdom, followed by the Kingdom of Sunda, leading up to the Dutch Colonial era and it’s present role as Capital of Indonesia and centre of the ASEAN secretariat.\n\nJakarta History Museum in Old Batavia of Colonial Jakarta"
