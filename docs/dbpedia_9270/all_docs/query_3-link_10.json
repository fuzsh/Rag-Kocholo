        "text": "Tarumanagara or Taruma is a once powerful kingdom in the western part of Java island in the 4th century until the 7th century AD, which is one of the oldest kingdoms in the archipelago known. In a note, the kingdom is the kingdom Tarumanagara wing Hindu Vishnu.\n\nHistory\n\nTarumanegara established by Rajadirajaguru Jayasingawarman in the year 358, which was later replaced by his son, Dharmayawarman (382-395). Jayasingawarman dipusarakan Gomati on the bank, while his son at the edge of times Candrabaga.\n\nMaharaja Purnawarman is Tarumanagara third king (395-434 AD). He built a new imperial capital in 397 located closer to the beach. The city named Sundapura-the first time the name \"Sunda\" is used. In 417 he ordered the excavation of river Gomati and Candrabaga throughout 6112 spear (about 11 km). Excavation completed, the prabu hold salvation with menyedekahkan 1,000 cows to Brahmins.\n\nSand Estuary inscription that mentions the event returns to the reign of the King of Sunda was created in 536 AD In that year the ruler Tarumanagara is Suryavarman (535-561 AD) King Tarumanagara 7th. Reader Jawadwipa, parwa I, sarga 1 (pages 80 and 81) testified that during the reign of Candrawarman (515-535 AD), father Suryavarman, many local authorities are receiving back the power of government over the territory as a reward for loyalty to Tarumanagara. In terms of this, then Suryavarman do the same as his father's political continuation.\n\nInterpreters Rakeyan Pengambat inscription is written in the sand Muara maybe once a high official Tarumanagara which previously was vice king as head of government in the area. What is unclear is why the inscription on the return of government to the King of Sunda was found there? Whether the area is the center of the Kingdom of Sunda or just an important place which included the Kingdom of Sunda region?\n\nBoth sources inscriptions as well as the sources of Cirebon testified that Purnawarman managed to subdue his enemies. rise in Pandeglang inscriptions show that its territory extends to the coast of the Sunda Strait. Reader archipelago, parwa II sarga 3 (pages 159-162) mentions that under the authority of the king Purnawarman there are 48 areas stretching from Salakanagara or Rajatapura (in the Gulf area Lada Pandeglang) to Purwalingga (now Purbolinggo) in Central Java. Traditionally Cipamali (Kali Bradford) was considered to limit the power of the kings of West Javanese rulers in the past.\n\nInscription Purnawarman presence in Sand estuary, which proclaim the King of Sunda in the year 536 AD, a symptom that Sundapura Capital has changed its status to a regional empire. This means, the administrative center Tarumanagara has shifted to another place. Similar examples can be seen from kedudukaan Rajatapura or Salakanagara (Silver City), called Argyre by Ptolemy in the year 150 AD The city was until the year 362 became the center of government Kings Dewawarman (from Dewawarman I - VIII).\n\nWhen the central government to switch from Rajatapura Tarumangara, then changed its status kingdom Salakanagara area. Jayasingawarman founder Tarumanagara was the son of King Dewawarman VIII. He was himself a Maharesi of Salankayana in India who fled to the archipelago because the area was attacked and conquered the kingdom of Maharaja Samudragupta of Magada.\n\nSuryavarman not only continued his father's policy that gives more credence to the king the area to take care of self-government, but also turned his attention to the east. In the year 526 AD, for example, Manikmaya, Suryavarman-law, establish a new kingdom in Kendan, Nagreg area between Bandung and Limbangan, Garut. Manikmaya son's character lives with his grandfather in the capital Tarumangara and later became Commander of the Armed Forces Tarumanagara. The development of the eastern region becomes more developed when great-grandchildren Galuh Kingdom Manikmaya founded in the year 612 AD\n\nTarumanagara itself only experienced the reign of 12 kings. In the year 669, Linggawarman, Tarumanagara last king, was replaced in-law, Tarusbawa. Linggawarman itself has two daughters, the eldest named Manasih be Tarusbawa of Sunda wife and the second wife named Sobakancana be Dapuntahyang Sri Jayanasa founder of the Kingdom of Srivijaya. Automatically, the throne of power Tarumanagara fell to the law of his eldest daughter, the Tarusbawa.\n\nTarumanagara rule ended with the shift of the throne to Tarusbawa, because more personal Tarusbawa want to go back to his own kingdom, the Sunda which had previously been in power Tarumanagara. On the transfer of power to Sunda, only Galuh who do not agree and decided to split from the Sundanese who inherited Tarumanagara region.\n\nKings Tarumanagara\n\n1. Jayasingawarman 358-382\n\n2.
