Now including the District Cibungbulang.\n\nKampung Muara where inscriptions Ciaruteun and Telapak Gajah found, first is a “river port city” located on the edge of the bookie Cisadane meeting with Cianten. Until the 19th century the river channels are still used to transport the coffee plantation. Now bamboo is still used by traders to transport goods to areas downstream.\n\nInscription at this time using the ancient Sundanese script, which was originally developed from the script type Pallawa Next, referring to the Cambodian script model with some characteristics that are still attached.
