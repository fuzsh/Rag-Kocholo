        "text": "On the road out to the temples, there were a couple of police roadblocks. Apparently Jakarta taxis were not allowed to come out this far, so the driver had to give a small bribe to the police-officer to continue on his way. When we reached the second roadblock, the driver got out of paying a bribe by letting the officer know that he had already paid one just a few minutes earlier. Rather than causing any sort of embarrassment, this was received as a very good reason to not have to pay again: there is a strange kind of etiquette around the bribing of officialdom in Indonesia which can be difficult for foreigners penetrate. Just as there is huge ‘black’ economy beneath the formal one in Indonesia, there is also a code of conduct for the giving of bribes and the greasing of administrative wheels which exists in the background of the formal law-book.\n\nWith this bribe paid, we proceeded out of town into the lush rice paddies of the Citarum River basin. While the flat landscape was far from scenic, it was different enough from other parts of the island to be of some interest. The main difference was in the comparative paucity of villages, which gave the sense of being in an inland sea of green rice-shoots. In Central and Eastern Java there are rice-paddies everywhere too, but the massive population pressure on Java means that there are always human settlements crowding on all sides. There must have been people about- there were five million of them, apparently- but their villages were not built all along the main road. This meant that mostly we saw shaggy-haired rice-paddies of a deep green, with innumerable canals and drainage ditches running through them, controlling the flows of the prodigious volumes of water.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the archaeological site, it too was surrounded by rice paddies. Like everywhere else we had passed on the way from Karawang, the site was low-lying, consisting of the rich alluvium deposited by the Citarum River. Cameron asked me how far away the coast would have been, and I said I wasn’t sure but thought it couldn’t have been too far: Java wasn’t all that wide at its furthest extent and we had been travelling consistently north all the way from the main road. In fact, I later read that this sight had once been very near the ocean, located near the confluence of the river and the sea. But the constant sedimentation at the river mouth over the centuries had left it now more than five kilometres inland from the Java Sea.\n\nAs we had expected, the site did not offer much in the way of things to see. Unlike the better known temple sites of Java, there was no statuary, no bas reliefs and nothing especially eye-grabbing in the way of architecture either. What was on offer was the base of a former temple set down a path in the middle of a rice paddy; as we walked about looking at the ruin, a rice-farmer was tending his crop not one-hundred metres away. This was the main temple at the site, Candi Jiwa: the one I had seen in the newspaper article. It had a large square base with each side being nineteen metres in length, which must have been largely below ground before it was excavated, as a shallow trench now surrounded it on all sides. This square, brick base was just under five metres high but most of the top of it seemed to be missing, giving it a rather squat, block-like appearance. Unlike the stone temples of Central and East Java, this structure had been made of mud-bricks, giving it a rather drab appearance. On top of the ‘block’, the structure appeared to undulate inwards, but most of this part had crumbled away. This undulation, combined with the fact that there was no staircase leading upwards, suggested to me that this was once a Buddhist stupa, and it would once have had a rounded hemisphere on top. I was to learn later that clay amulets- perhaps Buddhist votive tablets- had been found in the area. This was something of a surprise, as most accounts of Tarumanagara emphasize that it was Java’s earliest Hindu kingdom. Apart from the puzzle of its original function, there was another unusual feature of this temple which I mentioned to Cameron. It appeared that bricks of this temple included a unique material: rice husks. Candi Jiwa was different from all other temples we had seen in that it was built partly from rice! It seemed that rice cultivation had been part of the culture in the Citarum River basin since the days of the earliest kingdoms.\n\nAll in all, the stupa was not a beautiful structure, especially compared to temples further to the east, but it was here that the ‘kingdom’ approach to early South-East Asian temples came into its own. The site was far more interesting if you could forget about the country called Indonesia, or even the island of Java with the world-famous Borobudur near its centre, and realize that Candi Jiwa was the product of a distinct state which had led its own historical development, until finally collapsing some thirteen centuries before. Candi Jiwa may have been built as early as the fifth or sixth century, when the Roman Empire had just fallen to the barbarians and when the Islamic religion was still two hundred years from being born. To do it justice, you had to forget about what came later in Java and realize that this was a separate and much earlier episode of history, dating from the period when Indian religion and political systems were only just started to penetrate the region. Rather than comparing it the glorious monuments of Central Java’s Classical Age, it was better to see it as a first bold step in the integration of ancient Indonesia into world religion and global commerce.\n\nDonald requested that we take his photo for his Facebook page, which we did obligingly. In a typical move for an Indonesian youth, he stuck up two fingers in a V gesture whose meaning remained obscure to us. From there we followed a narrow path through the rice fields to a second temple, which was currently undergoing restoration. This temple, Cando Blandongan, temple was shorter than the first one, though it had a newly restored staircase leading up to an upper terrace, which somewhat expanded our notion of the variety of forms which Tarumanagara temples had taken. It was possible to imagine a statue of Vishnu being enshrined here and the residents of Tarumanagara coming to make puja to the sacred image. This structure also offered a little more in the way or ornamentation than Candi Jiwa as the brickwork along the base had been laid in a simple decorative manner. A large protective shed with a corrugated-iron roof had been constructed over this structure and restorations were ongoing at the time of our visit, with a few local workers standing about with wheelbarrows and shovels.\n\nFrom here we proceeded to another large protective shed on the far edge of the site. When we got there we saw that this had been built to protect a large excavation pit. We couldn’t go inside but we saw from the edge of the pit that it contained another large temple base and some other mounds- known locally as unsur- which were being professionally excavated. Here were more brick temples, presumably held together with rice husks too. There was a guard on duty and Donald spoke to him briefly, looking for information about the site. The most interesting thing he offered was that there were more temple bases at Cibuaya (literally Crocodile River), about twenty minutes’ drive away. I mentioned to Cameron that I had read that both Batujaya and Cibuaya had been the subject of intensive archaeological research since the 1990s, with more than a dozen digs being done. Judging from the ongoing work in that pit, it appeared that the work was still ongoing, and the area promised more interesting finds in the years ahead.\n\nAfter we had explored these two ruins, we wandered back towards the car-park and the small site museum which was located there. Donald had tasked the taxi-driver with finding someone who held the key while we looked around at the temples. It was only a single-room museum, contained in what looked like a small version of an ordinary villa. It may have been small, but it offered us some fascinating new insights into what we had just seen. It offered displays on the Buni Culture, a prehistoric trading and culture zone along the North Coast of Java and Bali, which had shared both a similar style of plain pottery wares and the practise of ceremonial burial with metal artefacts. We learned that Batujaya had been an early settlement site for the Buni culture and that at a later point, Indian pottery fragments had started to turn up on the architectural record too.\n\nIn other words, this settlement had started out as a trading port which had engaged in maritime commerce with other settlements on the North Coast of Java, but at some point, Indian traders had discovered this indigenous economic zone and started offering new wares into the local market. At this point the Buni settlements had received an international economic stimulus from India. By the following century the local rulers had adopted Hinduism and the making of statues of Vishnu and the building of Hindu and Buddhist temples had commenced. The local rulers had started adding the –varman suffix onto their names, showing that they had evolved from local chieftains into Hindu kings invested with an aura of supernatural prowess. The most famous of these was called Purnavarman. Ruling in the fifth century he had left a series of prasasti, inscribed standing stones, in the area from Karawang to current Jakarta, and his keraton may have been the most important in Java at the time. Modest as they were then, the ruins we had seen were testaments to a major new phase in Indonesian history, and Batujaya was an important part of the evolution of larger kingdoms in Java. We felt that the trip was worth it for finally explaining why West Java might have had a different history to the rest of the island, and yet questions remained. Most crucially we wanted to know what had happened to Tarumanagara. Why had it disappeared so completely from the memory of Java, leaving no apparent successor in its place?\n\nIt was not till much later that we came upon possible answers in our reading. While it is still something of an open matter, we do know that in 669 the Chinese court refused to receive any more envoys from Tarumanagara. This rebuke may have been due to the fact that by the late seventh century powerful new maritimes empires were arising in the Indonesian archipelago, centred on Sumatra. With Srivijaya already renowned in China as a centre of Buddhist learning and an entrepot for jungle products, the Citarum River based civilization may have been fast fading in economic importance. In his wonderful book on early South-East Asia, Pierre Manguin goes even further and suggests that Srivijaya may have finished off Tarumanagara in a military expedition around the year 686. The Kota Kapur inscription from the island of Bangka off the coast of Sumatra records that the Srivijayan king Jayanasa send a naval expedition of 20,000 men to Java at this time and defeated his enemies there. While the name of the kingdom is not mentioned, Manguin suggests that it was probably Tarumanagara and the reason for the expedition was that Srivijaya wanted to secure control of the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra, thereby sealing off the alternative route between India and China which allowed some trade to bypass the Melaka Strait. It may be that the story of the rise of Indonesia’s greatest early kingdom, Srivijaya, was intricately tied up with the eclipse of all its main rivals."
