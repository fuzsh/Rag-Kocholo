Captain Jimmy Adams was among several first-teamers put through their paces by Quins' backs’ coach Mark Mapletoft at The Ageas Bowl.

Hampshire director of cricket Giles White, who studied sports science and management at Loughborough University with Mapletoft, is hoping the link will be of mutual benefit.

“We always like to try and do something different in the winter and this is part of a reciprocal arrangement,” said White, who also studied with Quins’ academy manager and defence coach Tony Diprose.

“Harlequins have a similar philosophy in terms of winning while at the same time bringing academy players through. There’s also a crossover in our coaching techniques so we’re going to do a fielding session with the Quins’ backs!”

Will Smith, Joe Gatting, Danny Briggs and new dad Sean Ervine, on his first day back after the birth of his son Ellis Michael, were among the other players involved in the rugby session.

White added: “We’re very grateful to Mark for popping down and I think all the lads really enjoyed it.

“Touch rugby is a popular choice as the warm-up during the season so we could even see some improvement after the session!”

Meanwhile, James Vince captains unbeaten England Lions in the final match of their tour of South Africa in Benoni tomorrow, while Michael Carberry is enjoying a week off after returning from Australia as a Big Bash winner.

Liam Dawson and Adam Wheater are still playing club cricket in Australia and Tom Alsop, Matt Coles and Lewis McManus are doing the same in Durban.

Hampshire have another pre-season trip to Barbados next month. They start the season at home to Sussex on April 12.
