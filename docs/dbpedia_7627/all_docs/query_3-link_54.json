        "text": "2.1. Procedure and Participants\n\nDeveloped during the period March 2020 to April 2021, during a pandemic scenario, #GenerationsWithAVoice saw all its methodology adapted to the online format.\n\nInitiated with an awareness raising event, #GenerationsWithAVoice began by inviting 15 participants (young people, health and education professionals linked to youth work) for an interview focused on the themes under study and the role of intergenerational justice, in order to develop a storytelling video for use in dissemination of the project in academia, and for raising awareness in the community. The 15 interviews had an average duration of 32 min, resulting in the production of 5 videos: environment; family and housing; employment; economy; and digital generation.\n\nThe 15 participants were recruited through direct invitation via email, based on their experience and expertise, and the interviews were conducted in the period from May to October 2020.\n\nNine months later, having accepted that the face-to-face methodology would be impossible, contacts were reactivated with five schools (one for each territorial unit in mainland Portugal) contacted at the start of the project to facilitate a focus group with young people born in 2002 (voters) and another focus group with young people born in 2004 (non-voters), and focus groups were started online. The rationale for these age groups was understood to be the fact that becoming a “voter” would increase young people’s awareness regarding society, societal issues, and community engagement.\n\nThe participating schools were suggested by the Directorate-General for Education, and the participating classes were selected by the director of the educational institution, based on the availability of a class teacher to support the groups, and the age of the students (born in 2022—12th grade and in 2004—10th grade). The focus groups were conducted from November 2020 to January 2021.\n\nA total of 20 focus groups were conducted (two groups per region × two times, before and after the intergenerational dialogue), comprising a minimum number of 4 and a maximum number of 22 participants, bringing together young people aged 16–17 years old (groups corresponding to the youngest group), and 18–19 years old (older). The groups had an average duration of 58 min.\n\nThe groups were run at two different times for each of the groups in each school (16–17-year-olds and 18–19-year-olds), with an interval of two weeks. During this period, the challenge was to encourage intergenerational dialogue through interviews with parents, uncles, grandparents, teachers, or other people from the “adult” and “older” generations of their community, in order to recount their memories and experiences related to the themes under study.\n\nThis dialogue was intended to stimulate debate in the second focus group and to facilitate the identification of solutions to the problems and needs identified in the first focus group.\n\nTo support how intergenerational justice was understood by the participants, a questionnaire was developed to assess the importance, knowledge, concern, and action that the young participants attributed to each of the topics studied, along with their perception of future generations, their parents’ generation, and their grandparents’ generation. Although this questionnaire was aimed at a pre- (focus group 1) and post-test (focus group 2) study, due to the constraints within the COVID-19 pandemic, it was only possible to collect 32 reports from a single point in time (17.2 years; SD = 0.998).\n\n3.3. Qualitative Study\n\nIn the global qualitative study, based on the material collected in all the focus groups carried out in each of the five regions of mainland Portugal, the identification of numerous problems related to family and housing, education, environment, and work is observed. On the other hand, family and housing are also mentioned as important resources, especially in family relationships. A greater number of solutions were pointed out for the environment; young people seemed to more easily think of solutions for this topic. The topics of government and politics, as well as community and society, have fewer problems but also fewer resources and strategies gathered; they appear to be the themes that young people are more distant about.\n\nA comparative study was also carried out with the goal of investigating the different perspectives of the 2002 and 2004 generations (voter and non-voter youth). Some of the problems, resources, and strategies identified were similar among young people from both groups.\n\nIn the topic of influencing public policies, young people were asked what they could do to influence public policies. Both groups (voters and non-voters) identified the school as a critical context for promoting youth political participation, specifically through the development of activities and political education. Both also mentioned the need for proactivity and participation of young people in contexts such as demonstrations, as well as the representation of young people in Parliament. Communication through social media was also mentioned by both groups as a possible means of expressing the needs of the younger generations.\n\nYoung voters referred to the exercise of the right to vote, the implementation by the government of means to listen to their generation (e.g., programs, platforms, or surveys), and the promotion of activities, not only at school but also in the community.\n\nRegarding the identification of solutions for promoting intergenerational cooperation and communication, the young people of both groups pointed out open communication with adults (family members and in school context), and the creation of projects in schools.\n\nYoung voters also added the creation of activities and projects in the community, the use of technology and social media to bring the generations together, breaking prejudices, sharing knowledge, valuing others, education, a focus on common points between the generations, and the creation of a platform that promotes this communication.\n\nAs for non-voting youth, they mentioned the creation of opportunities for their generation to express their needs and a greater appreciation of their voice by adults.\n\nAt the closing of each session, and because the pandemic was and continues to be a reality with a strong impact on the lives of young people, they were asked about the impacts of COVID-19 on subsequent generations.\n\nWith similar comments on most of the identified consequences, both groups reported: (a) an increased sedentary lifestyle; (b) the impact on relationships (social and with family members); (c) an increased use of technologies; (d) the possible maintenance of teleworking; (e) the economic impact and economic crisis; (f) the maintenance of health care and sanitation; (g) the impact on health (both physical and mental); (h) the increasingly difficult access to the labor market.\n\nYoung voters also mentioned some additional, both positive and negative, consequences: the impact on education and the fact that the focus on the pandemic has left other important issues (such as the environment and climate change) in the background, on the one hand; and the possibility of closer family relationships, the positive impact on the environment, and a greater focus on collective well-being, on the other hand.\n\nNon-voters pointed to additional negative outcomes, such as increased and unnecessary consumerism, the negative impact on culture, the emergence of new diseases and future pandemics, and a decreased sense of freedom; but also, the immunity of future generations to the virus, on the other hand.\n\nA comparative analysis of the problems of the two focus groups (first and second moment), before and after young people were asked to dialogue with people from other generations in their life contexts, was conducted. The following points were observed: a better preparation for the identification of strategies in the second moment; and greater awareness of the problems and resources of the previous generations in the second moment.\n\nIn the first moment, several times they attributed the “blame” of current problems to past generations, especially environment-related issues; young people’s interviews with people from other generations contributed to a rethinking of this perspective with contributions from the other generations’ perspectives. With this intergenerational dialogue with parents, grandparents, and other older people of reference, young people contextualized some issues differently (e.g., at the time there was no environmental awareness and also fewer resources).\n\nYoung people seemed to understand that attitudes that protected the planet were still adopted back then (e.g., the use of cloth bags to buy bread, glass bottles of milk, or the lesser use of own vehicles, which not all families could afford, for example).\n\nThe family issue was also addressed—they understood that today they have parents with a more open mindset and that it is possible to talk to them and express their opinions; on the other hand, nowadays their parents spend less time at home and have less time for their children. They also discussed gender roles, arguing that if a few years ago, the man was the provider for the family, nowadays both parents have to work to meet the family expenses.\n\nAccess to housing was also discussed, making them reflect that at the time of their parents and grandparents it was more affordable. Regarding the work market, they compared the lifelong jobs of the past with today’s reality. They also considered themselves a more differentiated generation in terms of qualifications, and reflected on the fact that access to education is now easier and more generalized.\n\nThe topic of gender inequality was also discussed, but according to young people, past generations are not aware of this issue.\n\nRegarding health, they are unanimous in their comments and the general idea that health care today is better and more accessible.\n\nFrom the intergenerational interviews and debate of ideas, more sustained and organized strategies emerged at the second moment (second focus group). Young people are certain that they are better prepared and sensitive to deal with environmental issues than previous generations, and they believe that awareness should start at an early age. Even if they feel little support from adults regarding their concerns about the environment, they will continue spreading information and awareness to previous generations.\n\nIn the family, as strategies to prevent the sharp decline in birth rates over the years, they point to the need to provide more support to families, as well as the creation of more jobs.\n\nThey reiterate the importance of support from the government regarding the difficulty of accessing housing and the delay in achieving financial autonomy, attributed to the fact that they start to work later, and that employability is decreasing. Pressured by excessive evaluation and the choice of a professional area at an early age, they think that the educational system must be updated and reformulated since it has been maintained since the time of their grandparents. They believe that in addition to valuing learning, the school should promote life skills as well.\n\nIn health, they advocate for a restructuring and organization of primary health services and consider that mental health should be an investment target and free of charge. From the intergenerational debate, they believe that their parents and grandparents are not aware of the importance of this issue.\n\nAware of their grandparents’ reality in terms of access to retirement and pensions, they think that this will be a major problem for the following generations. They are concerned that they may become the first generation without access to retirement, partly because they will enter the world of work later, prolonging the need to work longer. They argue that access to retirement should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWith the feeling that they are little or not at all heard by the bodies of political power, they support the integration of disciplines or activities of a political nature into the school curriculum, a strategy that they believe can increase the political participation of the current and subsequent generations.\n\nFinally, regarding culture, and certain that this is one of the great national heritages, they support its modernization and access to it, since the prices charged are not always accessible to the entire population, and the role of schools in raising awareness of its importance. They also believe that culture can be an important vehicle in promoting intergenerational debate and that this is the way to ensure that national traditions do not become extinct."
