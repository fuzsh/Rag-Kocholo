        "text": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nBluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus transmitted between its ruminant hosts by biting midges (Culicoides spp.), causing severe hemorrhagic disease in sheep and deer (1). BTV contains 10 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome segments that encode seven structural proteins (VP1 to VP7) and five nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS4 and S10-ORF2) (2,–7). Twenty-seven BTV serotypes have been recognized to date (8, 9).\n\nBTV is widespread around the world (between 40°S and 50°N). Phylogenetic analysis showed that BTV strains evolved separately, with regional variants, named topotypes, for each genome segment. In South America, serological surveys indicated that BTV circulation is widespread (10). BTV-4 has been isolated in northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil (11,–14), and BTV-12 was isolated and associated with BT outbreaks in southern Brazil (15, 16). In French Guiana, eight serotypes (BTV-1, -2, -6, -10, -12, -13, -17, and -24) were isolated from ruminants with mild clinical signs or even that were asymptomatic (17). Multiple additional BTV serotypes (BTV-3, -14, -18, -19, and -22) were isolated in Brazil associated with deaths of Brocket deer (Mazama nana) in 2015 and 2016 (18). Although there are multiple BTV isolates from South America, complete genome sequences are not available for these isolates, and few phylogenetic analyses have been published (11).\n\nIn 2014, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease, with a mortality rate of 28.89%, affected a flock with 45 Texel sheep in Cachoeira do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (30°02′20″S, 52°53′38″W). BTV was isolated from the blood of one sheep after being passaged three times in the KC cell line and then once in BHK-21 cells. The isolate was identified as BTV-17 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (8) and designated 17/BRA/2014/73.\n\nGenomic dsRNA of the isolate was extracted from infected BHK-21 cells as the template for the synthesis of full-length cDNAs by RT-PCR, and then sequenced on a 3730 ABI capillary sequencer using segment-specific primers (19). Seg-1 to Seg-10 of 17/BRA/2014/73 were 3,944, 2,874, 2,768, 1,981, 1,769, 1,638, 1,156, 1,125, 1,049, and 822 bp, encoding VP1 (1,302 amino acids [aa]), VP2 (955 aa), VP3 (901 aa), VP4 (644 aa), NS1 (552 aa), VP5 (526 aa), VP7 (349 aa), NS2 (354 aa), VP6/NS4 (329/77 aa), and NS3/NS3a/S10-ORF2 (229/216/59 aa), respectively."
