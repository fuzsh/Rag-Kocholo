        "meta_description": "This book examines lived experiences and perceptions of climate change, changing consumption practices, and intra- and intergenerational justice with urban residents in China, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. The book draws on an interdisciplinary research programme called INTERSECTION, which was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council from 2014 to 2017. INTERSECTION was an innovative, cross-national programme that employed participatory arts and social research methods with urban residents in three cities: Jinja in Uganda, Nanjing in China, and Sheffield in the United Kingdom. Drawing together a unique dataset from these three cities -- which are very differently positioned in relation to global networks of production and consumption, (de)industrialisation and vulnerability to climate change -- the research demonstrates how people engage selectively with the ‘global storm’ and the ‘intergenerational storm’ of climate change. The research reveals a ‘human sense of climate’ that clouds its framing as an issue of either international and intergenerational justice. Its chapters focus on the global and intergenerational dimensions of climate change, local narratives of climate change, moral geographies of climate change, intergenerational perspectives on sustainable consumption, and imaging alternative futures through community based and creative research practices.",
