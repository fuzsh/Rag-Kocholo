This article draws on its insights and methodology, exploring the stories told and untold in legal discourse, with specific reference to the case of Louth v Diprose. The author links both the outcome of the case and the doctrinal development which it signalled, to the narratives deployed by the majority judges. It is contended that these narratives, as well as those of the judges in dissent, reflect and reinforce domi- nant ideas about gender and social class. The article concludes with a consideration of the strategies which might be employed by those who seek to include previously silenced voices in legal discourse.]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[I]n some respect this is but one more case in the annals of human relationships in which an infatuated but unrequited suitor has lavished gifts upon the subject of his infatuation, well knowing what he was doing and intending to do it, but in a sense allowing his heart to rule his head.

Diprose v Louth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450, 451-2. 2 Kim Lane Scheppele, 'Foreword: Telling Stories' (1989) 87 Michigan Law Review 2073, 2075. 3 Much of the literature has been published in law reviews. See, eg, Symposium, 'Legal Storytelling' (1989) 87 Michigan Law Review 2073 (11 articles stretching over 400 pages); Susan Estrich, 'Rape' (1986) 95 Yale Law Journal 1087; Martha Mahoney, 'Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of Separation' (1991) 90 Michigan Law Review 1; Mari Matsuda, 'Looking to the Bottom: Critical Legal Studies and Reparations' (1987) 22 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review 323 ('Looking to the Bottom'); Mar Matsuda, 'Voices of America: Accent, Antidiscrimination Law, and a Jurisprudence for the Last Reconstruction' (1991) 100 Yale Law Journal 1329 ('Voices of America'); Robin West, 'The Difference in Women's Hedonic Lives: A Phenomenological Critique of Feminist Legal Theory' (1987) 3 Wisconsin Women's Law Journal 81; Anthony Alfieri, 'Reconstructive Poverty Law Practice: Learning Lessons of Client Narrative' (1991) 100 Yale Law Journal 2107; Jerome Culp Jr, 'Autobiography and Legal Scholarship and Teaching: Finding the Me in the Legal Academy' (1991) 77 Virginia Law Review 539; Richard Delgado, 'When a Story Is Just a Story: Does Voice Really Matter?'

It is the claim that legal narratives are structured in ways which exclude, silence and oppress 'outsiders' - those not part of the dominant culture, particularly people of colour, women and the poor 8 - that gives legal storytelling its explicitly political flavour. A related claim is that 'voice', that is, the identity of the storyteller, makes a difference to the type of story told. The telling of stories by outsiders, the telling of counter-stories, 9 is seen as a means of challenging dominant legal stories and thereby transforming the legal system so that it is more inclusive, and respon- sive to the needs of, outsider groups.' 0 It has been recognised that the ability of outsiders' stories to contribute to progressive legal change is, in the short term, partly dependent upon the willingness of legal decision makers to listen to these stories and on their ability to empathise with them.&quot; This has led some proponents of legal storytelling to advocate the need to tell the stories of outsider clients in the courtroom, in ways which create empathy on the part of decision makers with the outsider group. 12\n\nOthers have become increasingly pessimistic about the ability and the willing- ness of those with power (judges and other decision makers) to participate in and contribute to progressive change.' 3 In this article I want to use the notion of legal storytelling to explore the offi- cial court stories in Louth v Diprose, that is, the particular narratives deployed by the various judges who decided the case. I hope to show that these stories are in fact stock stories about women, men and social class, and that they deter- mined not only the specific outcome of the case but also the development of the doctrine of unconscionable dealing on which it was ostensibly based. I hope also to use Louth v Diprose as a basis from which to evaluate the strategy of telling outsiders' stories as a means of achieving progressive legal change.\n\n9 Other outsider groups mentioned in the literature include lesbians and gay men and those with\n\n'other' accents. See, eg, Fajer, above n 3 (referring to lesbians and gay men); Matsuda, 'Voices of America', above n 3 (referring to the 'differently' accented). 9 The term is Richard Delgado's: see Richard Delgado, 'Storytelling for Oppositionists and Others: A Plea for Narrative' (1989) 87 Michigan Law Review 2411. 10 It is also seen as a means of 'community building' within outsider groups, as well as contributing to social change through influencing insiders: see ibid. 1 In the long term counter-storytelling may contribute to change in less direct ways, for example, through empowering outsider groups and through influencing public opinion generally. 12 See, eg, Fajer, above n 3 and Lynne Henderson, 'Legality and Empathy' (1987) 85 Michigan Law Review 1574, arguing that the telling of stories of the lives of gay men and lesbians during the hearing of Bowers v Hardwick 478 US 92 L Ed 2d 140 (1986) (Bowers) may have produced a different outcome in that case. In Bowers, the United States Supreme Court found that the constitutional right to privacy did not prevent a state from criminalising 'sodomy'. 13 See, eg, Delgado, 'Zero-Based Politics', above n 3; Delgado and Stefancic, 'Norms and Narratives', above n 3; Toni Massaro, 'Empathy, Legal Storytelling, and the Rule of Law: New Words, Old Wounds?' (1989) 87 Michigan Law Review 2099; Milner Ball, 'Stories of Origin and Constitutional Possibilities' (1989) 87 Michigan Law Review 2280.

She motions for silence.)\n\nVicki Pedagogous: The topic this week is the doctrine of unconscionable dealing. Could someone tell me, what are the elements of that doctrine?\n\nAndrew Chieve: It's when one party to a transaction is under a special disability in dealing with the other party, and that disability is sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or 'unconscientious' that they procure or accept the weaker party's assent. The onus is then cast on the stronger party to show that the transaction is fair, just, and reasonable.' '[The doctrine] looks to the conduct of the stronger party in attempting to enforce, or retain the benefit of, a dealing with a person under a special disability in circumstances where it is not consistent with equity or good conscience that he [sic] should do so.'\n\nVicki Pedagogous:\n\nGood. The latest High Court case on this topic is Louth v Diprose. What are the facts of that case, and what was the result?\n\nAndrew Chieve:\n\nThe basic issue in Louth v Diprose was whether Mary Louth was fully entitled to a house property which Louis Diprose had purchased and put in her name. In the Supreme Court of South Australia King CJ ordered that Louth transfer the house to Diprose on the basis that it was unconscionable for her to retain it. 7 His Honour held that Diprose was 'in a position of emotional dependence upon [Louth]&quot;' and that she manipulated him by manufacturing a false atmosphere of crisis with respect to her living arrangements in order to influence him to provide the money for the house. 19 An appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia 20 was dismissed by a majority (Jacobs ACJ and Legoe J, 14 Andrew basically tells the story told by the trial judge, King CJ, and those judges who upheld his findings in the Supreme Court and High Court appeals in Louth v Diprose. The term 'majority judges' or 'majority judgment' will be used to refer to these judges (including King CJ) or judgments, unless specific reference is made to either one or more of them. It is interesting to note that Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, who form part of the majority in the High Court, refer to the 'facts' as presented in the judgment of Toohey J, who is in dissent This is despite the fact that Deane J, who is also in the majority, sets out the 'facts' in detail by referring extensively to the judgment of the trial judge: see Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 623 (Mason CJ), 639 (Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh JJ) and 636-7 (Deane J). 15 Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd vAmadio (1983) 151 CLR 447, 474 (Deane J) (Amadio). 16 Ibid. 17 Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 449. His Honour held that both unconscionable dealing and undue influence was made out, but preferred to rest his judgment on the ground of unconscionable dealing. is Ibid 447. 19 Ibid 448. 20 Diprose v Louth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450.\n\n[Vol 19\n\nMelbourne University Law Review\n\nment&quot;.' 30 From about November 1983 until June 1985, Diprose telephoned and visited Louth 'quite regularly.' 31\n\nHe gave her jewellery and other gifts 'including a television set, a dish- washing machine, a twin tub, and a dish drying machine'. 32 'She would leave unpaid household bills lying about and he would pick them up and pay them.' 33 He regularly brought food to the house and he paid for her children to attend private schools. Diprose lived in rented accommodation in Adelaide. He owned an aero- plane worth about $25,000-$30,000, an 'old car', 34 an interest in a house in Tasmania, $91,000 which was lent on mortgage, and some interest totalling $15,000-$20,000. His debts amounted to about $15,000. Louth was on the 'Supporting Mothers' pension.' 35 She 'had a history of mental instability', 36 having 'injured herself in apparent suicide attempts on some occasions', 37 and having escaped a shoplifting conviction on 'psychiatric grounds.' 38 Louth's sister and brother-in-law separated in September 1984. There was some suggestion that she could not continue to live in the house owned by them at a low rent indefinitely. In May 1985 Louth and Diprose discussed the former's housing situation and in June Diprose purchased the house in which she was living for $58,000 and put it in her name. Settlement was effected in July. Diprose attended to the conveyancing involved in the transaction. There were two conflicting versions of what was said and agreed with respect to the house in the May discussions. Diprose's account was as follows: Louth telephoned him sounding upset. She said she'd have nowhere to live and that she was depressed. Louth raised the house issue again three days later and other conversations fol- lowed. She mentioned the 'dreadful life&quot;' 39 she had had with her hus- band, &quot;'that she had been carted from one address to another .... [how] they were always short of money .... [and that] she felt very insecure&quot;'.\n\n40\n\nShe said that she had finally experienced 'some security and stability&quot;' 41 in the house and that if she had to move again she'd kill herself and\n\n30 Ibid. 31 Ibid. 32 Ibid. 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid. 35 Ibid 441. 36 Ibid 440. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid. 39 Ibid 443. 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid.\n\n(Vol 19\n\n1994] Storytelling and the Law: A Case Study of Louth v Diprose 707\n\n'&quot;make a good job of it this time&quot;'. 42 He &quot;'had no doubt that she may well do it and certainly try&quot;'. 43 He made a number of suggestions to her. He asked whether her family might be able to help but she was doubtful about this. He offered to give her a loan out of his mortgage moneys which were due to be paid out, but she 'rejected the suggestion of a loan on the ground that she could not repay such a loan'.44 He said that he could purchase the house and she could remain there as a tenant but she refused 'on the ground that it would give [him] a hold over her which, in view of his sexual interest in her, was unacceptable.' 45 She finally agreed to his sug- gestion that he put the house in her name &quot;'on condition that [she] agreed to transfer it back&quot;'. Louth's account of what happened was that Diprose decided to make a gift of the house to her with &quot;'no strings attached&quot;' 47 so that she could feel secure, and that this occurred 'in the course of general conversation about the future' 48 and the possibility that she might eventually have to move house. She denied having made any suicide threats and that a loan was ever mentioned, although she agreed that she had turned down an offer by Diprose that he buy the house and allow her to rent it. After the purchase of the house and until the middle of 1988, the relation- ship between the parties 'continued very much as before' 49 in terms of the contact between them and the material support provided by Diprose. Louth wanted to reduce 'the number of his visits and conveyed that impression to him by her offhand behaviour.'5° In mid-1988 Diprose was 'without accommodation'5 1 during the period in which he had to vacate his rented premises and the date at which he obtained possession of a house he had purchased. Louth allowed him and his son to stay with her, but she became 'irked by [his] continued presence in the house .... [and a] quarrel occurred'. 52 Diprose told Louth he wanted the house transferred into his name. She refused and he left the house and sued her for it.\n\nVicki Pedagogous:\n\nSo whose version of events was believed?\n\n42 Ibid. 43 Ibid 44 Ibid. 45 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 48 bid. 49 Ibid 442. 5 Ibid. 51 Ibid. 52 Ibid\n\n1994] Storytelling and the Law: A Case Study of Louth v Diprose 709\n\nfor a right to have the house retransferred, but I am quite satisfied that on those matters his evidence is truthful and reliable and to be preferred to that of... [Louth].'6° Penny Edant: I don't think that giving 'careful consideration' to an inconsistency gets rid of it, and it certainly doesn't properly take into account the fact that on the critical issue of the retransfer, his evidence was rejected by the trial judge. Andrew Chieve: You didn't let me finish. What influenced Diprose's evidence on this point was the fact that he was 'a strange romantic character who had a sustained infatuation for ... [Louth]. When the scales fell from his eyes he bitterly regretted the transfer of the house'.\n\n61\n\nI was also about to say that a number of the majority judges in the appeals also raised the issue of inconsistency but then dismissed it. Mason CJ con- cluded that 'the rejection of part of [Diprose's] evidence does not ... entitle this Court to disregard his Honour's acceptance of [Diprose] as a credible and accurate witness in relation to ... the circumstances leading up to the purchase of the house.' 62 Deane J stated that the trial judge was 'fully con- scious of a possible appearance of inconsistency in that regard', 63 and fur- ther, that the fact that his Honour 'generally preferred the evidence of [Diprose] to that of [Louth] clearly did not preclude him, as a matter of logic or common sense, from rejecting [Diprose's] evidence on a particular matter'.\n\nTran Scripts:\n\n65\n\n(Angrily) It was not just 'part of Diprose's evidence that the trial judge didn't accept, or his evidence on just any 'particular matter'. Diprose's claim that he stipulated for a retransfer, and that therefore the house was not an outright gift, was the very basis of his case. Everyone really focus- sed on this issue. Counsel for Diprose made it quite clear in his opening address that he considered the gift issue to be the real issue in the case.\n\n60 Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 448. 61 lbid 443 (King CJ). 62 Louth vDiprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 625. 63 Ibid 635. 64 Ibid 635-6. 65 Tran tells an alternative story based on her own reading of the trial transcript. Given the theoretical premises of this article, it is trite to say that this story is not being presented as the truth or as fact either. Scheppele, above n 2, 2097, reminds us that: [T]he presence of different versions of a story does not automatically mean that someone is lying .... Stories can be told many ways, and even stories that lead to very different legal conclusions can be different plausible and accurate versions of the same event. 66 See Diprose v Louth, Transcript of Proceedings, Supreme Court of South Australia, before King CJ, commencing 8 May 1990, 2 ('trial transcript'): [Louth] ... opposes the relief sought ... on the grounds that the conveyance of the house to her was by way of an unconditional gift and that's essentially the issue for your Honour. It's in a fairly\n\nMelbourne University Law Review\n\nNot surprisingly, counsel for Louth concentrated on countering this aspect of Diprose's case. 67\n\nThis gives the finding that Diprose did not stipulate for a retransfer even greater significance. If the crux of his case was, as suggested by his counsel, based on this version of events, then surely this would affect his credibility on other issues. Moreover, it was not only once but at least six times during the course of the trial that Diprose attested to this version of events. On the other hand, Louth's evidence on this point was accepted. 69 I am amazed that the trial judge could still consider Diprose to be the more reli- able witness in these circumstances. The unconscionable dealing claim was quite peripheral to the whole case as far as both parties and their lawyers were concerned. It was the last of a number of alternative claims with respect to the house. 70 It does not appear until paragraph 15 of the Statement of Claim, 71 and is expressed to be '[iun the further alternative'. 72 Everyone, including the parties themselves, must have been quite surprised when the trial judge found that Diprose had made a gift of the house but nevertheless held in his favour on the basis of unconscionable dealing. It is extremely unlikely that Louth would have bothered to fabricate evi- dence about the May discussions which may have had a bearing on the unconscionable dealing issue, given how peripheral it was thought to be. And it is incongruous to accept Diprose's contrary evidence on these\n\nnarrow compass. Counsel for Diprose continued (trial transcript 8): for the sake ofcompleteness, that if contrary to the plaintiff's submissions your Honour came to the view that there was an out and out gift, we submit that that is voidable by reason of the unconscionability of the defendant (My emphasis.) 67 This tactic, which worked in so far as the claim based on the agreement to retransfer was concerned, proved counter-productive with respect to the unconscionable dealing claim. This is discussed below in the section titled 'Stories and Tactics: Strategies for Change'. 6 Diprose stated in evidence: 'I said, &quot;Well, look, I suppose I could put the house in your name but that would only be on condition that you agree to transfer it back to me&quot; .... She was quite happy with that' (trial transcript 26); 'I then said to her &quot;Now you will remember that eventually I want this transferred back to me because I have got three children as you know and I can't afford to give it to you, it is not a gift&quot;' (trial transcript 36); 'I said &quot;Well I'm sorry, that was the whole arrangement, that I would put it in your name if you transferred it to me&quot;' (trial transcript 45); 'I was sick and fired of her putting off the discussion which had to come about transferring the house back' (trial transcript 46); '1 said &quot;It's not going to be a gift&quot;' (trial transcript 58); 'I said, &quot;By the way, it is not a gift' (trial transcript 77). 69 See Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 445 (King CJ): 'I accept ... [Louth's] evidence that [Diprose] told her that it was a gift'; 'I place little reliance upon the evidence of [Louth] where it serves her own interests, but the other evidence in the case so strongly confirms that ... [Diprose] made a gift of the house to ... [her], that I have no hesitation in holding that there was such a gift.' 70 The other alternative claims with respect to the house were that Diprose loaned the money to Louth; that the gift should be set aside for undue influence; and that it should be set aside for misrepresentation. Diprose also claimed for the return of various items of furniture on the basis that these were let to Louth. 71 Diprose v Louth, Amended Statement of Claim, Supreme Court of South Australia, 19 April 1990, 5. 72 Ibid.\n\n[Vol 19\n\nMelbourne University Law Review\n\nconclusion that would have surprised both of them. Furthermore, in his evidence, Diprose suggested that Louth had attempted suicide after the house was transferred to her. 76 Taken together with sui- cide attempts she had made in the past, this means that she may well have been suicidal during the May discussions. So even if, as Diprose claimed, she had made suicide threats in relation to the house in May, then it is likely that they were genuine and not part of a scheme to manipulate Diprose. Basically, I don't think that even Matheson and Toohey JJ quite captured the extent of the inconsistency in the trial judge's findings on the issue of manipulation and on the question of the relative credibility of the parties. I'm also troubled by the fact that Matheson and Toohey JJ felt they had to rely on the evidence by Louth's brother-in-law to support their conclu- sions. Toohey J, for example, thought it 'necessary to put to one side the evidence of [Louth] herself [because the trial judge] found her testimony ... to be &quot;quite unimpressive&quot;'.&quot; This perpetuates the belief that Louth's tes- timony is inherently suspect, when, in fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction. Ultimately, it takes away from Louth's credibility, which, in the context of the case as a whole, works against her. Vicki Pedagogous: There seems to be quite a bit of disagreement about the reliability of the parties and what went on before the purchase of the house. Andrew Chieve: I don't really see the point of this. The majority in the High Court accepted the trial judge's findings and we have to stick by that. Vicki Pedagogous: Let's move on. As Andrew has already mentioned, the doctrine of uncon- scionable dealing requires that one party suffer under a 'special disability' in dealing with the other party. Can someone tell me something about the parties and the relationship between them?\n\nAndrew Chieve: The relationship which existed between the parties 'placed [Diprose] in a position of emotional dependence upon [Louth] and gave her a position of great influence on his actions and decisions.' 8 Diprose was a 'strange and romantic character'. 79 He wrote 'love poems [which] were tender, often sentimental, sometimes passionate, very often\n\n76 Ibid 40. Louth confirmed that she had made two serious attempts to take her life in 1988: see ibid 118. 77 Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 652 (footnote omitted). 78 Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 447 (King C). 79 Ibid 443.\n\n[Vol 19\n\n1994] Storytelling and the Law: A Case Study ofLouth v Diprose 713\n\non the theme of unrequited love.'80 He 'immediately fell very much in love' 81 with Louth.

He 'tried to persuade her to remain in Launceston and proposed mar- riage'.8 5 He helped her with her living expenses, 86 brought her foodstuffs, paid for her children's school fees, 87 brought her expensive giftss8 and eventually bought her a house; all this to a 'woman who did not return his love'8 9 and when he 'had only limited assets ... [and] had to work as an employee solicitor for a living .... [with] three children [in his care] who had natural claims upon his bounty.' Louth's attitude towards Diprose was 'quite indifferent', 9 'offhand' 92 and niggardly. 93 She 'would leave unpaid household bills lying around', 94 and she 'tolerated his visits and his company because of the material advanta- ges which resulted. The result of this toleration was to feed the flames of... [Diprose's] passion and to keep alive his hopes that [Louth] would relent and that his devotion would be requited.' 95 She 'deliberately manufactured the atmosphere of crisis [with respect to her living arrangements] in order to influence [Diprose] to provide the money for the house ... [S]he played upon his love and concern for her by the suicide threats ... then refused offers of assistance short of full ownership of the house knowing that his emotional dependence upon her was such as to lead inexorably to the gratification of her unexpressed wish to have him buy the house for her ... [I]t was a process of manipulation to which he was utterly vulnerable by reason of his infatuation.'\n\nPenny Edant:\n\nThe expressions you use to describe Diprose, 'while colourful ... assume that a &quot;normal&quot; standard of conduct ... is readily discernible ...

Which is the more accurate?\n\nAndrew Chieve:\n\nThe account I have given is taken from the findings of fact made by the trial judge. Penny's account is taken from the findings of the minority judges. The trial judge's findings were upheld by majorities in the Supreme Court appeal and in the High Court. Obviously, it is this account which is to be preferred.\n\nTran Scripts:\n\nI disagree with both of these accounts. To start with, Diprose's pursuit of Louth and his 'romantic' overtures toward her may have been less benign than the accounts by the trial judge and the minority judges indicate. Before Louth left Launceston for Adelaide, Diprose tried to persuade her to stay and proposed that she sign a contract to the effect that she would live with him 'as man and wife' and that in return he would give her various things 5 Louth refused this offer. So far, this has simply been described as a proposal of marriage which was refused or rejected 6 To me, it sounds more like a calculated attempt to strike a bargain. The judgments refer to a 'quarrel' or 'argument' between the parties while Diprose was temporarily staying with Louth in 1988 The use of the words 'quarrel' and 'argument' give no indication of the fact that this involved verbal and physical violence. In her description of events Louth stated that when she told Diprose to leave the house he responded '[t]hat I was an ungrateful bitch .... He got pretty nasty and in front of my son he called me a whore and he called [sic] me that I slept with everybody in Adelaide, why couldn't I sleep with him, and hurt my son and me ... I kneed him because he got hold of me, that's all I could do. So I kneed him and then I ran into the bedroom and then he called me all those names and my son was there too ... I rang a friend of mine to come around because I was scared.&quot; 08 And again in cross examination Louth stated that '[h]e was pushing me all around, calling me names.&quot;' 9 Diprose's version of this incident was a little different: 'she said &quot;Look, let's not argue about this, let's be friends.&quot; She came over to me, put her arm around my neck, I\n\n105 See trial transcript 7, 51, 95. Louth stated in evidence: 'he had a contract, that he would give me so much money if I stayed .... I put it in the fire' (trial transcript 95). 106 See, eg, Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 440 (King CJ); Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 644 (Toohey J). 107 See Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 442 (King CJ) ['quarrel']; Diprose v Louth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450, 460 (Legoe J) ['argument']; Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 647 (Toohey J) ['quarrel'). 108 Trial transcript 110. 109 Ibid 169.\n\nMelbourne University Law Review\n\nkissed her and then she attempted to knee me in the groin.'n 0 Because the trial judge was not interested in pursuing the issue of violence, ('Does the physical violence really matter. It is a peripheral thing.' 111 ) there was little other information about this altercation presented at the trial. However, in her evidence, Louth testified to another violent outburst which allegedly occurred while Diprose was staying with her: 'He said &quot;I'll see you rot in hell and I'll take you to the courts and I'll go to the highest Supreme Court and then the High Court&quot;. He said he would do anything and then he would bum the house down.&quot;' 2 Louth had even approached the police about Diprose's presence in the house.&quot; 3 Apart from the violence, there is the possibility that Diprose may have been sexually harassing Louth in the sense of subjecting her to unwanted sexual advances. There is a hint of this in the judgments, where mention is made of the fact that Diprose did not contact Louth immediately on his arrival in Adelaide so that she would not think she was being 'harassed'; that Louth had her brother-in-law contact Diprose to tell him she did not wish to see him; and that Louth initially refused to give him her telephone number 4 The explicit sexual content of one of the 91 poems ('The Mary Poems') which Diprose wrote about Louth and which he sent her is evi- dent from the extract included in the judgment of Legoe J: &quot;'I feel you biting my neck, our intertwined tongues, Your awakening nipples under my busy hands; And I take you and f... you deeply in my thoughts.&quot;'\n\n5\n\nAmazingly, in none of the judgments are these facts presented or described as sexual harassment. Instead, they are viewed as evidence that Diprose was romantic, infatuated, dependent and persistent, despite Louth's rejec- tions.&quot; 6\n\nThere was further evidence given at the trial which suggests harassment:\n\nThe reason Louth gave for not immediately giving Diprose her tele- phone number was 'because she had had a number of prank calls and\n\n110 Ibid 45. &quot;' Ibid 169 (KingCJ). 112 Ibid 111. 113 Louth said in evidence: 'I remember going to the Norwood Police Station to see what I could do about the matter': ibid. See also ibid 172. 114 See Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 440 (King CJ); Diprose v Louth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450,457-8 (Legoe J); Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 644 (Toohey J). 115 Diprose vLouth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450, 457. 116 King CJ's description of the poems as 'love poems ... [which] were tender, often sentimental, sometimes passionate, and very often on the theme of unrequited love', has already been noted: Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438,439. Toohey J quoted this description with approval: see Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621, 644. Legoe J stated that the poems displayed 'a passionate obsession for her': Diprose v Louth (No 2) (1990) 54 SASR 450, 457. Interestingly, it was counsel for Louth who submitted the poems as evidence for Louth. The use of this tactic is discussed below in the section titled 'Stories and Tactics: Strategies for Change'.\n\n[Vol 19\n\nMelbourne University Law Review\n\nthe following assets owned by Diprose: mortgage moneys worth '$91,000, an old car, an aeroplane of the value of $25,000/$30,000 ... interest worth about $15,000 or $20,000, and a house owned with other members of his family ... [and] debts of about $15,000.' Compared with Louth, who was on the supporting parents' benefit at the time, and who appears to have owned no significant assets at all, it seems to me that Diprose was very well off indeed. His assets were not incon- siderable. I would have thought that owning an aeroplane and being a solicitor, even an employee solicitor, is pretty privileged. There was also evidence that Diprose received a 'loan' of $120,000 from his mother in 1988 Whether this money had to be repaid or not, it is clear that he at least had access to a large sum from private sources. The 'old car' referred to was in fact two cars, an old Toyota and an antique MG. 129\n\nA further aspect of the trial concerns me. There was no attempt to get a broader picture of who Mary Louth was and what she did...\n\nAndrew Chieve:\n\n(Interrupting) This is meant to be an equity class. We are supposed to be discussing the doctrine of unconscionable dealing, not 'Days of our Lives'! (Andrew walks out. Vicki struggles to conceal a smile. The class continues...)\n\nThe classroom dialogue tells us three stories about Louth v Diprose. Each story is quite different, yet they are all derived from the same evidence, the same facts, presented at the trial. Not only does the interpretation of that evidence differ from story to story, but the 'facts', the 'same facts', are indeed different in each story. Some 'facts' are included, some excluded in the process of devel- oping each particular narrative.\n\nSTOCK STORIES: DAMNED WHORES, ROMANTIC FOOLS, DAMSELS IN DISTRESS AND KINDLY GENTLEMEN In this section I want to explore the various narratives deployed in more detail. Whose story do they tell or privilege, and whose voice is missing? What does each narrative tell us generally about women like Mary Louth and men like Louis Diprose? In the story told by the trial judge and echoed by the majority judges on appeal, Diprose is depicted as the classic romantic fool who is powerless in the\n\nhad to work as an employee solicitor for a living.' 127 Diprose v Louth (No 1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, 440-1 (King CJ). 128 Trial transcript 44 (evidence given by Diprose). 129 Ibid 160 (evidence given by Louth).\n\n[Vol 19\n\n1994] Storytelling and the Law: A Case Study ofLouth v Diprose 719\n\nface of love. He is so utterly in her power that he pursues her and showers her with gifts even though he gets no sex in return for it. He is also a very nice man. Not only is he generous, but he is helpful and supportive, he wants marriage; he is a loving father whose concern extends beyond his own children to her children as well. His generosity is more significant for the fact that his assets are so limited. Louth, on the other hand, is portrayed as the archetype 'damned whore'.\n\n30\n\nShe lies, she is obviously from the 'lower classes', 131 she is slovenly, conniving and materialistic. Her morals are suspect. Her sexuality is dangerous. She uses it to get what she wants, but she persists in denying him that which he has well and truly paid for. She is not a nice woman. She is a tease. She has power over him. There is nothing subtle about this story. It stands out for its vivid characteri- sations of both parties, the ample use of metaphor, and generally, the presence of an explicit 'narrative' flavour. When the powerful image of the 'damned whore' is juxtaposed with that of the 'love-struck knight in shining armour', we know immediately that Louth must lose the case. A somewhat different story is told by the minority judges. For them, Louth is less suspect. She might not be as conniving and manipulative as the majority makes out. Perhaps she told the truth about the May discussions. In fact, she is more of the victim-type, a 'damsel in distress'. 132 She deserves our pity. She is a single mother, after all, and she is poor. Sick, emotionally unstable, suicidal, victim of rape, oppressed former wife - that's Mary Louth. The minority story continues: Mary Louth, victim, is fortunate to have met a very kindly and generous gentleman, Louis Diprose. A romantic man of limited assets, he showered her with gifts. But he is not entitled to take those gifts back just because he regrets giving them. He is a grown professional man who knew what he was doing. He is not a fool, and he must have been getting something out of the relationship. Louth and he were on relatively equal terms. This story is more subtle. The acknowledgment of Louth's tragic past results in a depiction of her which is in marked contrast to the majority story. But the stereotype is reversed rather than eliminated. She turns from undeserving whore into pitiful victim, a status which makes it acceptable for the miflority to find that she should keep the house in the circumstances (those circumstances being that it was given to her as an outright gift and that it would be stretching the doctrine of unconscionable dealing beyond its previous parameters to set it aside on that basis 133 ). However the persistence of the image of Diprose as benign\n\n130 This term is borrowed from Anne Summers, Damned Whores and God's Police: the Colonisation of Women in Australia (1975), who argues that the 'damned whore' stereotype of women in Australia dates back from the beginning of white 'settlement'. 131 This term is derogatory because it implies a ranking of classes, but it is here used deliberately to highlight what appears to be a negative view of Louth. 132 See Anne Bottomley, 'Self and Subjectivities: Languages of Claim in Property Law' (1993) 20 Journal of Law and Society 56, 57, where the author argues that Lord Denning's construction of the female plaintiff in Eves vEves [1975] 1 WLR 1338 as a 'damsel in distress' assisted his finding in her favour on the basis of a constructive trust. 133 This is discussed below in the section titled 'Stories and Doctrinal Development: Unconscionable"
