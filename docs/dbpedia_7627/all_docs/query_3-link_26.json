        "text": "The AAG compiles a quarterly list of newly published geography books and books of interest to geographers. The list includes a diversity of books that represents the breadth of the discipline (including key sub-disciplines), but also recognizes the work which takes place at the margins of geography and overlap with other disciplines. While academic texts make up most of the books, we also include popular books, novels, books of poetry, and books published in languages other than English, for example.\n\nSome of these books are selected for review in the AAG Review of Books. Publishers are welcome to contact the AAG Review of Books Editor-in-Chief Debbie Hopkins, as well as anyone interested in reviewing these or other titles.\n\nA Caribbean Poetics of Spirit, by Hannah Regis (University of the West Indies Press 2024)\n\nAfter Nativism: Belonging in an Age of Intolerance, by Ash Amin (Polity Books 2023)\n\nAmerican Indians and the American Dream: Policies, Place, and Property in Minnesota, by Kasey R.
