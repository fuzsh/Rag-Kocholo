        "text": "A brand new ¬£3m funding initiative is set to improve the development of coaches and players from the British Isles ahead of The British & Irish Lions Women‚Äôs first ever tour in 2027. The ‚ÄòLevelling the Playing Field‚Äô funding from Royal London, founding partner of the Lions Women‚Äôs team, is set to be deployed in customised plans for each union, tailored to meet their specific needs. The plan for Scottish Rugby is to appoint two ‚ÄòPerformance Pipeline‚Äô coached, along with expanding youth camps and training matches to boost the development of the players. Additionally, they will host residential camps for a national academy. The WRU - Welsh Rugby Union is going to bolster its women‚Äôs pathway coaching team with the addition of five new members, including a specialist skills coach and a performance pathway coach. They will also put resources into talent identification programmes and initiatives aimed at Welsh qualified talent based out of the nation. Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) has allocated the funding to host supplementary camps and training matches for women‚Äôs under-18 and under-20 teams, aimed at accelerating player development. Alongside establishing a ‚ÄòCoach Accelerator Scholarship Program‚Äô and collaborating with universities to identify future talent. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) are going to use the grant to enhance England Rugby‚Äôs existing player development groups, which will help increase the targeted skill development for players progressing through the pathway. Ben Calveley, The British and Irish Lions CEO, said: ‚ÄúSupporting the growth of the women‚Äôs game is a key strategic priority for the British and Irish Lions as it is for each of our constituent unions.‚Äù ‚ÄúRoyal London‚Äôs ‚ÄòLevelling the Playing Field‚Äô grant represents a significant investment into the women‚Äôs game in the four unions and will make a positive impact on women‚Äôs rugby.‚Äù #investment #rugby #rugbyunion #lions #britishandirishlions #rfu #wru #irfu #scottishrugby #womensrugby\n\nI just picked up this ad for tomorrow's University of Oxford v University of Cambridge #Varsity Rugby match on my socials this morning. It took me back to when this was a must-see fixture on the #Rugby calendar. Those were halcyon days when half of the City of London would take a mid-week afternoon off and waddle down to #Twickenham to watch a couple of old mates and a good spattering of genuine international quality players running around the Cabbage Patch. It felt like the pinnacle of university rugby in the UK and therefore by default the world. However, in the post-professional egalitarian rugby world we live in today, most quality young rugby players are nurtured through the club academy system or if they do go on to a University it is one affiliated with, or near, a top club. Therefore, the relevance of this game today must be questioned. I'd much rather these two great institutions challenge themselves with meaningful regular fixtures with other top teams such as Durham University, University of Exeter and the best Welsh Unis in British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) Super Rugby or follow Hartpury University and Hartpury College, Loughborough University and #Exeter by competing in senior men's leagues to understand how good they are. I am not sure why they don't. Maybe it's clinging to traditions in the face of change or they don't want to face the potential truth that they are not the best University teams in the UK anymore. I have a feeling it may related to why Eton College and Harrow School still play their annual school cricket match at #Lords or why the BBC allows #Oxbridge to be represented by their individual colleges on University Challenge (when all other Unis put teams in representing their total cohort). Is that fair, or it is just a figment of my state-school, Poly-educated 'chip-on-my-shoulder' imagination? üòâ #universities #BUCS #Oxford #Cambridge England Rugby Premiership Rugby World Rugby Cardiff Metropolitan University Swansea University University of Nottingham Leeds Beckett University University of Bath Cardiff University / Prifysgol Caerdydd\n\nJoin Us for a Fundraising Golf Tournament in Support of the University of Manitoba Women's Hockey Program! ‚õ≥üèí Are you ready to tee off for a great cause? üéâ We're thrilled to invite you to our upcoming fundraising golf tournament in support of the University of Manitoba Women's Hockey Program!

A great meeting (as all the previous meetings from my local clubs have been) and enlightening on so many fronts!! A couple of headlines... 1. The Reality of Building a Rugby Legacy - Guildford Rugby Club has evolved from humble beginnings in 1922 to a thriving hub for rugby excellence. This growth is a testament to the dedication of players, coaches, volunteers and its community. 2. We discussed the Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts of Rugby Club development... Don‚Äôts: ‚ùå Don‚Äôt overlook the importance of youth development. ‚ùå Don‚Äôt neglect facility upgrades. ‚ùå Don‚Äôt be afraid to be a leader - deal with all manner of day to day ‚Äòrugby stuff‚Äô that lacks integrity or not within our sports values. Do‚Äôs: ‚úÖ Invest in youth rugby (girls & boys) - it's important!!. ‚úÖ Continuously upgrade facilities and look after your finances robustly. ‚úÖ Foster a sense of community - always!! Guildford Rugby Club‚Äôs success stems from these core principles and in no small measure I am sure, down to Aidan and his team. Good luck over the forthcoming season (not to much luck - obviouslyüôèüòÇüòÇ)!! #RugbySuccess #GuildfordRugby #ClubDevelopment #RugbyLegacy #GuildfordRugby #Commitment\n\nRWC 2023 I joined Foster Moore just over a year ago. Ireland had just beaten the All Blacks in a series in NZ, that July. To put that in perspective, the British and Irish Lions had only ever done so once in NZ, in their history. Rugby and my new tenure with FM, were forever more entwined. Much has been written of the comparison in terms of psychology, between sporting teams, and organisations. Teams and organisations always go through hard times, it is how they adapt to those, is what ultimately defines them. The All Blacks did not have the ideal build up to this RWC, but when it mattered, they were there, there in the right place, at the right time. This last year in Foster Moore has taught me that I still have a lot to learn. I have strong opinions on most things, and for sure I do not always need to share these, no matter what the subject, to be effective. I have learned this from the strong personalities, that are now my colleagues, and friends in Foster Moore. Foster Moore I hope has also benefited by my addition to their global team, and hopefully even more so in the months and years ahead. We have achieved a lot in this one year together, but our RWC final has yet to come. And so to the match tonight. Selfishly, for many reasons, I want the All-Blacks to destroy SA, so that the match against Ireland is regarded as the true final. To me, it has been the best game so far. But to win a World Cup, I think it is right that no team, has it all their own way, and I hope it is a tight game to the last passage of play. But, I will also think of the Irish players, watching the match tonight and what they are thinking. I cannot even comprehend how they feel. And of course for South Africa, it is always much more than a sport. They want to win for their own reasons. The draw was poor, two southern hemisphere teams to vie to win a RWC, does nothing for world rugby. The semis were poor. RWC competes against football in Europe. Failing miserably! There was a purpose to this post. And it is this. \"Success is a science, if you have the conditions, you will get the result.\" [Oscar Wilde] #TheRegistryPeople #FosterMoore"
