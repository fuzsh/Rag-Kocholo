        "text": "Through ISFA, schools enjoy affiliation to The Football Association and can stay in touch with everything that is going on in independent schools football, as well as participating in tournaments, the representative and development programme and coaching courses.\n\nAPPLICATIONS AND TOURNAMENT ENTRIES FOR 2023-24 ARE NOW OPEN.\n\nAny school wishing to participate in any ISFA activity, or to involve its pupils in representative matches or development camps, must be a Member of the Association for the current season.\n\n​\n\nThe Independent Schools FA (ISFA) is a “not for profit” organisation. The aim of the Association is to cover costs and, in the event of any surplus, it is reinvested in developing the game in our schools.\n\n​\n\nAll forms of membership run for a full football season/academic year, from 1st September to 30th June. Where ISFA events take place in July or August, then it is necessary for participating schools either to have been a member the previous season or to be already enrolled as a member for the following season.\n\n​\n\nThere are two membership options available\n\nFull Membership\n\nStandard Membership\n\n​\n\nFull Membership\n\nFull Members of ISFA are mainly Senior Schools who offer a particularly high standard of football provision. Full membership carries with it certain privileges, including free entry into the Boodles ISFA Cup, exemption to the last 64 of the Boodles ISFA Cup and priority entry into tournaments with restricted entry (e.g. the ISFA Six-a-Side Tournament). Full Membership is by invitation but schools interested should e-mail info@isfa.org.uk in the first instance.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nStandard Membership\n\nStandard Membership is the category for most schools. Standard Members schools qualify to participate in the following events, subject to payment of an Entry Fee if applicable:\n\nEntry into ISFA competitions - with the proviso that, where the total number of entries is restricted (e.g Senior Six-a-Side Tournament), Full Members will receive priority\n\nNomination of players for the ISFA representative and development programme at all age groups (U13, U14, U15, U16, U18 Boys and U16, U18 Girls)\n\nStaff Coaching Courses and INSET Events\n\nAccess to ISFA Development Programmes\n\nStandard Membership fee is £35 for the season.​\n\n​\n\nSchools applying for membership are asked to keep in mind the following:\n\nISFA must receive BOTH the application form AND the membership fee in order for membership to be processed. Some schools send one or the other but not both.\n\nSome PE Departments give their application form to the accounts department, who then make the payment but fail to forward the form. ISFA then has no contact details for the school and no details of any tournament entries.\n\nSome schools pay by bacs (or send a cheque) from an account that does not carry the same name as the school. ISFA is then unable to identify which school has sent the money."
