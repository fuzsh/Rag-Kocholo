        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nMaximum voluntary torque (MVT) is used to assess the capacity of the neuromuscular system (Morrison et al., 2004; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005) but its functional relevance has been questioned due to the time it takes to reach MVT (>125 ms) when contracting from rest (Tillin et al., 2012, 2018). Voluntary rate of torque development (RTD) measures the ability to produce torque rapidly and so is considered more functionally relevant than MVT during activities such as sprinting (Tillin et al., 2013a), joint stabilisation (Domire et al., 2011; Krosshaug et al., 2007) and balance recovery (Behan et al., 2018; Izquierdo et al., 1999). It is widely documented that MVT decreases with increases in core body temperature during brief (≤5 s) (Gordon et al., 2021; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005) and prolonged (10–120 s) (Morrison et al., 2004; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Todd et al., 2005) maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) with the magnitude of decline in MVT greater during prolonged voluntary efforts compared to brief contractions. However, the effects of high core body temperature on voluntary RTD are less well‐known.\n\nOur laboratory recently showed that voluntary RTD was preserved during high thermal strain (disruption to homoeostasis by stressing the thermoregulatory systems) despite declines in MVT (Gordon et al., 2021). The difference in responses is likely explained by the distinct neural and contractile mechanisms that determine MVT and RTD (Folland et al., 2014). Our recent study (Gordon et al., 2021) found that neural drive (descending voluntary neural input from the central nervous system) decreased with high rectal temperature, at the force plateau (where MVT is measured) and during the rising force–time curve (where RTD is measured). Whilst these declines in neural drive likely caused the reduction in MVT we observed, consistent with previous findings (Morrison et al., 2004; Nybo & Nielsen, 2001; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005), they could not explain why RTD was preserved, despite neural drive being an important determinant of RTD (Folland et al., 2014). The preservation of voluntary RTD was likely caused by the faster intrinsic contractile properties of the muscle, because of increased muscle temperature (de Ruiter & de Haan, 2000; de Ruiter et al., 1999; Dewhurst et al., 2005), countering the reduction in neural drive. Conceivably, if reductions in neural drive with high core temperature can be mitigated, the benefits of faster contractile properties caused by increases in muscle temperature may record an improvement in voluntary RTD.\n\nOne way of potentially attenuating the decline in neural drive in the heat is by decreasing the magnitude of perceived thermal strain through peripheral cooling. Skin temperature can influence human thermal behaviour via local afferent feedback (Schlader et al., 2011a) and changes in skin temperature (e.g., increase due to the ambient environment) can modulate thermal sensation (subjective ratings of the thermal intensity of the surrounding environment) independent of core temperature (Attia & Engel, 1981; Mower, 1976). This is particularly the case when cooling the skin of the head and neck region in hot ambient conditions (Cotter & Taylor, 2005). Reductions in perceived thermal strain, for example, from neck cooling, can improve subsequent exercise performance/capacity in the heat (Sunderland et al., 2015; Tyler & Sunderland, 2011a, 2011b; Tyler et al., 2010). The mechanism for this effect may be associated with an attenuation in hyperthermia‐induced reductions in the neural drive (Gordon et al., 2020; Racinais et al., 2008). An attenuation in the hyperthermia‐induced reduction in neural drive may, therefore, limit declines in MVT and, coupled with faster contractile properties due to a warmer muscle, potentially increase voluntary RTD, during high thermal strain.\n\nIf cooling the head when hyperthermic maintains or even improves neuromuscular function by decreasing the perception of thermal strain (reducing thermal sensation and feeling cooler), it is conceivable that the opposite may happen if the perception of thermal strain is increased by heating the head whilst normothermic. There is preliminary evidence of this with non‐thermal warming stimuli (e.g., capsaicin solution) applied to the face while normothermic, decreasing thermal comfort (TC; subjective affective rating of how thermally comfortable the surrounding environment is) and impairing self‐paced exercise (Schlader et al., 2011a, 2011b). Recent data also show that simulated sunlight exposure to the head and neck can impair cognitive function and some motor performance tasks (Piil et al., 2020). To the authors’ knowledge, the use of local thermal warming stimuli, that is, whole head heating, has not been directly investigated on MVT and RTD. Both skin and core body temperatures can influence thermoregulatory behaviour (Flouris & Cheung, 2009; Schlader et al., 2011b). Therefore, directly heating the whole head region should increase thermal sensation (i.e., feeling hotter) and should be a sufficient stimulus to exacerbate the perception of thermal strain while normothermic, which theoretically may reduce neural drive, MVT and voluntary RTD. The comparison of the effects of heating and cooling of the head and neck regions and the subsequent expected alterations to thermal perception may provide further evidence of the contribution of behavioural thermoregulation to the modulation of voluntary force output in hot and temperate conditions. The ability to modulate force output in hot conditions potentially translates beyond exercise performance in the heat, for example, to occupational or military settings, where the ability to perform physical work, specifically, rapid and forceful muscle contractions, is of potential importance.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of altered head and neck thermal sensation on MVT, voluntary RTD and their neuromuscular determinants in hyperthermic and normothermic participants. It was hypothesised that improved local perception of thermal sensation via whole‐head cooling during whole‐body hyperthermia would (i) attenuate the expected decline in MVT by preserving neural drive, and (ii) enable participants to benefit from faster contractile properties and so experience increased voluntary RTD, relative to no cooling. Conversely, it was hypothesised that exacerbated perceptions of local thermal sensation via whole head heating while normothermic would decrease both MVT and voluntary RTD, by lowering neural drive compared to no heating.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe present study aimed to investigate the manipulation of local head and neck thermal sensation independent of core body temperature on the neural and contractile mechanisms responsible for rapid and maximal voluntary torque capacity. Neither hyperthermia nor the manipulation of thermal sensation affected MVT or voluntary RTD, but there was evidence that neural drive was affected by hyperthermia, specifically, decreasing in the heat. During the rapid voluntary contractions, EMG0–100 and EMG0–150 were shown to decrease in HOT compared to NEU. Nevertheless, the consistent MVT and RTD across conditions, despite effects on neural drive, may partly be explained by a trade‐off in improved intrinsic contractile function (greater twitch/octet torques and faster contraction and relaxation times).\n\nMVT (Figure ) and voluntary RTD (Figure ) were similar between HOT and NEU. Hyperthermia can be induced by active (e.g., exercise) or passive methods, with the former potentially confounding interpretation of the influence of thermal strain on hyperthermia‐induced reductions in voluntary force output. Studies using active hyperthermia but assessing neuromuscular function on non‐exercised limbs have not shown decreases in maximal voluntary force (Martin et al., 2005; Nybo & Nielsen, 2001; Rattey et al., 2006; Saboisky et al., 2003), whilst studies using passive protocols (e.g., liquid conditioning garments) have demonstrated temperature‐induced declines (Gordon et al., 2021; Morrison et al., 2004; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005). MVT in the present study appears to corroborate the aforementioned active hyperthermia studies, and contrast with the passive protocols. Whilst the present study employed a low‐intensity cycling exercise bout (mean of all trials, 85.9 ± 0.6 W), it is unlikely that this would have elicited exercise‐induced fatigue to the lower limbs, given the amount of time participants passively rested between finishing the exercise and starting the neuromuscular assessment protocol. One explanation for no change in MVT, and a limitation of the study, is the omission of baseline measurement of neuromuscular function, specifically in the hot ambient conditions. The comparison of MVT between different ambient conditions on different trial days potentially masks any observable decline in MVT. Gordon et al. (2021) recently demonstrated this by showing a 12% (P < 0.05) decrease in MVT at T re 39.5°C relative to a baseline measure taken at T re ∼37°C, in the same trial. However, when MVT at T re 39.5°C in the hot ambient conditions was compared to the normothermic control trial, there was no difference (P > 0.05) in MVT. We, therefore speculate had there been a baseline measure of MVT in the present study, there would have been an observable hyperthermia‐induced decline in MVT. The similarity in voluntary RTD between HOT and NEU was expected, although there appears to be a subtle increase in RTD during the initial 50 ms from contraction onset when hyperthermic. These data are consistent with recent evidence from our group demonstrating that voluntary RTD does not decrease during high thermal strain (Gordon et al., 2021). The manipulation of local thermal sensation did not affect either MVT or voluntary RTD, which contrasted with our original hypothesis. Whilst torque output was not modified by local changes in thermal sensation, there may have been some differences in both neural drive and the intrinsic contractile properties, which will be discussed below.\n\nMVT and voluntary RTD were unaffected by high thermal strain or the modulation of perception of thermal strain, but neural drive decreased following hyperthermia. There were moderate‐to‐large effect sizes for declines in VA (−6%; d = 0.5) and EMGMVT (−31%; d = 0.8) during HOT compared to NEU. A hyperthermia‐induced reduction in neural drive at MVT is well‐documented (Morrison et al., 2004; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005), with recent data also showing a decline in the neural drive during rapid voluntary contractions with high thermal strain (Gordon et al., 2021). The present study supports this finding, with reductions in both EMG0–100 (−23%) and EMG0–150 (−24%; Table ) during whole‐body hyperthermia. The authors speculate that the manipulation of TShead from cooling may have had a small (non‐significant) effect (HOT vs. HOTcool; EMGMVT, d = 0.5, EMG0–50, d = 0.4, EMG0–100, d = 0.7, and EMG0–150, d = 0.9) on neural drive compared to no cooling in the heat. The implication is that whole‐head and neck cooling during hyperthermia may attenuate a decrease in the neural drive.\n\nThe changes in TShead and the possible effect on the neural drive could be explained in part by the high alliesthesial thermosensitivity of the head and neck regions (Cotter & Taylor, 2005), which has a small surface area but a large effect on thermal sensation and discomfort (Brown & Williams, 1982). A reduction in the neural drive from head and neck heating is plausible, with research conducted on non‐thermal facial heating (Schlader et al., 2011a) increasing perceptual sensations of the heat and decreasing TC, which can reduce cycling capacity (Schlader et al., 2011a). However, the present data do not support this in a predominantly passive heating context.\n\nIt is interesting to note that neither TC nor TSbody was statistically different within the two environmental conditions (NEU vs. NEUhot and HOT vs. HOTcool). This finding is in spite of statistical differences in T¯ sk for all trial comparisons (Table ). Cutaneous thermoreceptors are thought to influence thermal sensation (Mower, 1976), and thus if T¯ sk was different within the environmental conditions, it might be expected that these changes should also be reflected in TSbody. This may be due to a lack of sensitivity in the psychophysical scales used to assess thermal sensation (Young et al., 1987) and TC (Gagge et al., 1967), where the scale can become quickly ‘saturated’ and no longer provides quantifiable measures of sensations of warmth and how pleasant these may or may not be (Cabanac, 1975; Hensel, 1981). Alternatively, the discrepancy could be linked to anchoring biases (Raccuglia et al., 2018). It may be that the manipulation of TShead in the present study was not sufficient to effect meaningful changes in TC during either NEUhot or HOTcool, in part because TC is influenced by core body temperature (Cabanac, 1971). T re was 37.1 ± 0.2°C in NEUhot and 39.4 ± 0.1°C in HOTcool, which were similar to NEU and HOT, respectively (Table ), which adds to the growing body of literature that suggests that core body temperature is a key determinant of hyperthermia‐induced declines in the neural drive (Gordon et al., 2021; Morrison et al., 2004; Nybo & Nielsen, 2001; Périard et al., 2014; Racinais et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006; Todd et al., 2005).\n\nMuscle temperature was not recorded in the present study, although it is likely that high thermal strain did cause a rise in muscle temperature and subsequent improvements in the intrinsic contractile properties (de Ruiter & de Haan, 2000; de Ruiter et al., 1999; Dewhurst et al., 2005). These improvements are evidenced by the faster TPT and ½RT in both twitch and octet responses in HOT and HOTcool compared to NEU and NEUhot (Table ), resulting from improved excitation–contraction coupling and faster cross‐bridge cycling mechanics via an increased rate of myosin–actin attachment (Davies et al., 1982). However, there were subtle differences between HOT and HOTcool. Twitch RTD0–50 was 14% (d = 0.4) lower in HOTcool than HOT, which could partly explain why no increase in voluntary RTD was observed, relative to HOT and in contrast to our original hypothesis, given that twitch RTD0–50 is a determinant of early phase rapid torque production (Andersen & Aagaard, 2006; Folland et al., 2014). In addition, octet RTD0–50, which is a determinant of middle phase (50–100 ms) rapid torque production (Folland et al., 2014), was greater in HOT than both NEU and NEUhot, but in HOTcool, statistical significance was only observed compared to NEUhot (Table ). Last, octet pRTD in HOTcool was not statistically different from either NEU or NEUhot and 7% (d = 0.3) lower than HOT. Taken together, these data suggest that the intrinsic contractile properties produced lower involuntary RTD when cooling was applied to the head and neck compared to no cooling.\n\nWe have previously observed that high thermal strain creates a compensatory mechanism to preserve voluntary RTD through improved intrinsic contractile function as well as faster contraction and relaxation rates of the muscle. This is achieved via increased muscle temperature, which consequently counteracts the hyperthermia‐induced decrease in the neural drive (Gordon et al., 2021). When we examined skin temperature taken from the RF, it was statistically different between all trial conditions (P ≤ 0.020; d = 0.9–16.9). Using thigh skin temperature (HOTcool; 39.5 ± 1.1°C vs. HOT; 41.0 ± 0.3°C) as a surrogate estimation of muscle temperature, it may be that intrinsic contractile function improved in HOT compared with HOTcool because the head and neck cooling unexpectedly lowered thigh muscle temperature in HOTcool.\n\nHead and neck cooling increased the time to achieve the target T re (39.5°C) by slowing the ΔT re during the passive heating, which resulted in a lower mean session T re for HOT (38.4 ± 0.1°C) compared to HOTcool (38.6 ± 0.2°C; P = 0.02; d = 0.9). The increased heat exposure was reflected in a greater estimated sweat rate in HOTcool compared to HOT; however, ad libitum fluid replacement was adequate to prevent significant changes in body mass percentage, suggesting that hydration status was similar between these conditions. Therefore, head and neck cooling successfully alleviated local perceptions of thermal strain, but at the expense of prolonged heat exposure due to an apparent blunted ΔT re in HOTcool. The authors speculate this blunted ΔT re may be linked to a reduction in brain temperature, although, there is conflicting evidence to suggest that this may not be the case (see review by Marino, 2011). A recent study demonstrated a decrease in the brain (−0.9°C) and rectal (−0.3°C) temperature in healthy individuals (Diprose et al., 2022), suggesting the possibility that cooling the whole head may create a thermal gradient between the brain and body. The authors, therefore, cannot disregard the effects that a reduced brain temperature may have had, although these effects are currently unknown. Diprose et al. (2022) used a powerful cooling system to reduce the temperature of the head; therefore, any decrease in brain temperature in the current study is likely to have been smaller in magnitude in comparison. The increase in the duration of the protocol from cooling presents a further added confounding effect, and future research could extend these findings by focussing on dynamic reductions in skin temperature (de Dear et al., 1993). Nevertheless, data in this study suggest that local cooling or heating of the head–neck region did not inhibit or benefit neural drive, and by extension voluntary torque. This suggests the difference in T re between the temperate and hot ambient conditions, rather than the modifications in thermal perception, is a key factor in inhibiting voluntary muscle.\n\nThere are some practical implications of the presented findings. Locally cooling the head and neck regions with a sufficient cooling stimulus may not only improve local thermal sensation in the heat, but also slow the rate of rise in core temperature, in a passive setting. This manipulation of local thermal sensation does not affect measures of voluntary torque production in temperate or hot ambient conditions; however, it can slow the rise in core temperature, which may be practically beneficial in scenarios requiring physical exertion for sporting performance, occupational tasks or habitual exposure to the heat. Where interventions are used to reduce sensation and thus declines in neural drive, care should be taken for health reasons, as cooling may disrupt a potential natural protective mechanism to limit metabolic heat production from muscular activity.\n\n4.1. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, increased core temperature reduced neural drive during maximal and rapid voluntary contractions. MVT and RTD were not affected by the changes in neural drive, likely due to a trade‐off with the effects of the heat on the contractile properties. Local thermal sensation in the heat was improved with cooling of the head and neck while heating the same area during normothermia had the opposite effect. The local manipulations used to alter thermal perception had minimal impact on thermal discomfort, accounting for why the neural drive was neither increased with head cooling whilst hyperthermic nor decreased with head heating whilst normothermic."
