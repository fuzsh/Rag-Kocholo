        "text": "In June 2006 the World Health Organisation published a review of the issues concerning International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for biotechnological products, reflecting a growing awareness of the challenges posed by novel therapies to the established scientific naming conventions. Like many aspects of the biotechnology industry, the process of naming and branding new drugs is complex and often shrouded in technical vocabulary. Examining fictional representations of biotechnology in parallel with analysis of the ‘real-life’ processes for product naming reveals some of the implications of nomenclature whilst rendering the scientific discourse more transparent. In this paper, I use Margaret Atwood’s 2003 novel, Oryx and Crake, as an entry point for exploring these implications from a feminist perspective, examining biotech both as a space for critical analysis and its effects on the medical discourse surrounding women’s bodies."
