        "text": "Profile\n\nEXPERTISE\n\nI am a social, cultural and urban geographer whose research focuses on issues of social difference, identities, relationships, and contemporary processes of social and legal exclusion. In particular, I have a sustained interest and expertise in the following areas:\n\nThe geographies of childhood and youth (particularly the processes that marginalise children and young people in contemporary society)\n\nIntergenerational space and intergenerational justice\n\nThe influence of religion on law and policy related to same-sex relationships and sexual orientation equality (particularly related to law and policy concerning schools, same-sex marriage, and equalities legislation)\n\nTransnational religion and debates about sexuality and same-sex relationships, with a particular emphasis on the Anglican Communion\n\nGeographies of race and racism\n\nQualitative methodologies and international comparative research\n\nI adopt an interdisciplinary approach to research, drawing on (and seeking to contribute to) fields including sociology, anthropology, childhood and youth studies, sociolegal studies, religious studies, and environmental studies.\n\nResearch interests\n\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\nMonographs\n\nDiprose, K., Valentine, G., Vanderbeck, R.M., Liu, C., and McQuaid, K.
