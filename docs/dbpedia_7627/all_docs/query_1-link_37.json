        "text": "WELLINGTON — Getting to rub shoulders with world-class rugby stars like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter is just one of the many benefits young players from around the world are experiencing at the Canterbury and Crusaders International High Performance Unit.\n\nThe unit, which is based in Christchurch, New Zealand, has had a stream of players and coaches come through its doors over the past couple of years to learn from and experience rugby at one of the country’s most successful provinces and Super Rugby franchises.\n\nThe Crusaders have been the dominant force in Super Rugby, winning seven titles since the competition began in 1996. They are now in the running for an eighth title after winning the New Zealand conference last weekend to reach the playoffs for the 13th time.\n\nMeanwhile, Canterbury, the major province within the Crusaders franchise, has won six provincial titles in the professional era and has provided the core of the Super Rugby team’s players, including New Zealand All Blacks McCaw, Carter, Brad Thorn, Sonny Bill Williams and Kieran Read.\n\nIt is little wonder, then, that overseas players and coaches are so eager to learn the methods and skills that have produced so much success on such a consistent basis.\n\nAthletes must demonstrate high performance to be accepted into the I.H.P.U. program, which currently has three players who have represented Scotland at the Under-20 level, two Americans, a Russian, an Irishman and another Scot, all honing their skills under the watchful eye of John Haggart, who leads the unit.\n\nJeremy Chacon, a 20-year-old prop for the University of Northern Colorado, has taken a semester off from his studies to come to the unit for two months. During that time he will undergo specific training programs that will cover a range of technical aspects related to his position as a prop, as well as tactical, physical and mental skills, nutrition and holistic development as a player.\n\nHe and his fellow I.H.P.U. players will get to watch the Crusaders’ training sessions and will share the gym and other training facilities with the team’s players. They are integrated into the Canterbury Academy setup and assigned a club in Christchurch for which they play each weekend during their stay.\n\n“I’m very surprised at the level that players are at,” said Chacon, whose ambition is to become a professional rugby player. It is at a “whole other level” compared with the United States, he said.\n\n“New Zealand is the rugby Mecca and it’s awesome. I love it. I’m passionate about rugby. I want it to be a bigger part of my life than it is now, and I’m glad to be here.”\n\nWhile many of their teammates in Scotland are enjoying the off-season, Scotland Under-20 players Harry Leonard, Grant Gilchrist and George Turner are spending 18 weeks in Christchurch developing their skills and playing regular club matches before returning for the new season in the Northern Hemisphere, which begins in August.\n\nLeonard, a 19-year-old fly-half who is in Edinburgh’s Academy squad, said it had been a huge learning curve and that he had noticed a difference in the rugby culture in Christchurch. “Everyone is very optimistic, not just on the pitch but off the pitch as well,” he said.\n\n“After a loss they pick each other up. I think that’s a big criticism of rugby back at home. The boys dwell on the losses and they often talk about the negatives and don’t do enough about the positives.”\n\nHe continued: “One of the first things I was told when I came out here was that you should work harder on your strengths than on your weaknesses because your strengths are going to get you to where you want to go. That’s not to say you shouldn’t work on the things that you are bad at, obviously. It’s just a different approach.”\n\nHaggart admits that what Canterbury and the Crusaders do in terms of training, assessment and management is not necessarily that different from what other clubs, provinces or franchises around the world do. But the high standards demanded of players, management and other staff is what helps breed success.\n\n“I think that’s why we are special, because it’s something you probably can’t just say to someone ‘Here’s the magic pill, go have it.’ It is environmental,” Haggart explained.\n\n“An environment where they are watching the Crusaders train, they are seeing them do extra work after training, they are watching them in the gym, they might even be beside them working out in the gym,” he said. “They are learning almost by osmosis, just by being part of the environment.”\n\nThe two teams’ results mean that others are keen to see the winning culture firsthand, and not just through the I.H.P.U., where a monthlong program costs around 4,500 New Zealand dollars, or about $3,600.\n\nHarlequins coaches John Kingston and Tony Diprose recently spent a week in Christchurch, talking with coaches, sharing ideas and watching players train.\n\n“The style of rugby that Harlequins play in England, albeit in a totally different setup clubwise, is very, very similar to the way the Crusaders want to play,” Kingston said.\n\n“To me it was natural that you would want to come and see how they train and how they work and how they perform, what their mind-set is, the way they think the game is going.”\n\nGaining a different perspective is part of the attraction. “You spend a week out of your own environment and it gives you a chance to think about what it is you want to achieve, while looking at people who obviously know what they are doing working on things,” he said.\n\nSimon Mannix, a coach with the French club Racing Métro, is also expected to visit, and there has been interest from Japanese clubs and from the Russian club Krasnayar, which wants help setting up an academy based on the Canterbury template.\n\nBut as much as Canterbury and the Crusaders are willing to impart their knowledge, the reality is that they also need to make some money."
