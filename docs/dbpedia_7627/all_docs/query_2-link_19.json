        "text": "The leading rugby clubs of England have been airing grievances for a while now over their chances of taking on the best in Europe. Their problem, give or take the odd million on the salary cap, is the acquisitive aggression of some of their competitors. Their problem, in short, is the French. Those arrivistes have been spraying their money all over the world, accumulating vast squads that dwarf those of not only the English but also the Welsh, Irish, Scottish and Italians. Every now and then, we hear alarm bells about the finances of a few of them, which may not augur well for their future, but generally there is little sign of their spending falling in line with that of the rest.\n\nNo one is sleeping soundly upon it this side of the Channel, but there are those more concerned with the medium to long term, particularly at the Rugby Football Union, who are less worried. Indeed, you could even say they are quietly quite happy about it.\n\nIn the rugby world, the 2011 Six Nations and World Cup may be all anyone is talking about, and in London it may be 2012, but at Twickenham Towers 2015 is the date writ large across the psyche, the year the Rugby World Cup comes to England. They are excited there at a new trend sweeping across the Premiership clubs, partly brought on by the squeeze of the recession and the French, partly brought on by their own initiative to reward clubs that field English qualified players (EQPs) in their matchday squads.\n\nLast season, £1m was set aside by the RFU, to be shared between clubs that could average more than 14 EQPs in their squads of 23 across the season. There was one tranche of rewards handed out at Christmas in 2009 and another at the end of last season. Eight clubs qualified for the first lot of pay-outs and seven qualified for the second. But at the Christmas just gone 11 clubs qualified for their share of a pot that has now been increased to £2m and will continue to grow over the course of the eight-year Elite Player Squad agreement between the RFU and Premier Rugby.\n\nHarlequins lead the way, with an average of 78% of their matchday squads across all competitions this season qualifying for England, which is virtually 18 out of the 23. In Quins' win over Wasps in the Premiership a fortnight ago, 21 of their squad of 23 were EQPs. The only club not to have satisfied the standard this season is Saracens, but that will surely change soon. As the accompanying team (below) of young Englishmen demonstrates, their academy is as prolific as any in producing talent.\n\nThe financial strength of the French is forcing a lot of this on the English game, but through a neat paradox the process is now starting to force up its first shoots into the England team. The roll call of young players in the England team has been proclaimed loudly and regularly of late. That 21-year-olds such as Courtney Lawes and Ben Youngs have not only been selected for the full England side but thrived against some of the best in the world is an unusual development in England's notoriously conservative tradition.\n\nBehind them queue up a couple of 20-year-old forwards in the Saxons squad. James Gaskell, the Sale lock-cum-back-row, is setting Martin Johnson's famously flinty heart a-flutter, notwithstanding his brandishing the kind of pace that might tend a gnarled lock forward towards scepticism. And then there is Joe Marler, the Quins prop who, notwithstanding the kind of haircut that might do the same, has so impressed Johnson that he called him up to the senior squad in the autumn.\n\n\"The call-up was pretty much out of the blue,\" Marler says. \"Graham Rowntree [England's scrummaging coach] rang me up on the Sunday and asked if I wanted to come and train. I thought: 'Is this a wind-up?' I'd played at Gloucester the day before [Quins lost and Marler was booed by the Shed – quite a compliment – when he and his Mohican walked to the bench when substituted late on], and I'd had a shocker. The next day I was starting to find it tough, so to get that call was really good. But I haven't really thought about it too much, because I think if I do that, I'll end up not pushing on. I've got to keep going because everyone is improving around me.\"\n\nPart of the reason England are so excited about Marler is that he stands as a blueprint for the modern young professional. The way he has come through Quins' academy system, sharing a house with his fellow fledgling pros while training with the big boys, the way he stamps himself upon a match with an approach that can only be described as large and, yes, joking aside, the way he wears his hair. Reared through the new systems he may be, but he is no one's idea of a clone. His ever-changing hair is fashioned by his current housemate, Chris Brooker, who is a hooker and not, it need hardly be added, a hairdresser. For Harlequins' Big Game at Twickenham against London Irish this Christmas, Marler had shaved into the side of his head the words Jolly Hog and Sausage, a reference to his team-mate Olly Kohn's catering business. That was done by one of his girlfriend's friends, a hairdresser.\n\n\"He did it for me early on Boxing Day. I told Olly I was planning it for the Big Game. I was really excited about the event – it was more than just a game. But, also, you can't take these things too seriously.\"\n\nThere are plenty from previous generations who would say aye to that. Professional sport will never shake off concerns about the roundedness of the sportsmen it produces, but the concept of the academy can foster a spirit that would compare to anything that ran through the amateur era. You can well imagine Marler and Brooker at home, bonding over the shears. Before that, Marler shared an academy house with three other young Quins, including the promising wing George Lowe.\n\n\"The friendship we built up living together and coming through the academy together is huge. You take it out on to the pitch but even in training, day in, day out, when you have those dark days and it's pissing it down and freezing cold, you look round and you see those faces that are there to pick you up, not just faces of people you go to work with.\"\n\nThe benefits of such a spirit for any club are obvious, as are the benefits of giving these youngsters their head on matchday. Tony Diprose, the former England and Harlequins No8 who is the manager of Harlequins' academy, claims that it transfers up the chain to the top. \"It has to be of benefit to England for players to have these experiences,\" he says. \"It doesn't mean they are all going to be good enough, but it does mean they are being tested. Whereas in the first years of the academy process there were worries about how much rugby the young players were getting. I think those fears have been addressed.\n\n\"Joe Marler is a good example. He came here as an 18-year-old and spent a year at Worthing, where Will Green [the former England prop] taught him a few things, which is why I sent him there, and then he had a year at Esher. Now he's doing fantastically well in our first team. But he'd been in the system before that.\n\n\"I first saw him play for Sussex under-16s against Surrey in Crawley. He had long blond hair then. The next time I saw him he'd shaved it off, so I didn't recognise him. He was very physical. Everything he did he hit hard. It was obvious he was a talent, but we would have been alerted to him by someone in the network of coaches we have working for us on a volunteer basis throughout Surrey and Sussex.\"\n\nAt time of writing, Marler is shaven headed with just a wispy rat's tail at the base of his head to hint at any maverick streak. It might all seem anathema to the Leicester mafia, the Rowntrees and Johnsons of this world, but it is also indicative of a fresh breeze blowing through English rugby. A fellow prop in the Saxons squad, Alex Corbisiero, 22, hails from New York and fancies himself as a rapper. Characters all of them and young and, as importantly as anything, playing regularly at first‑class level.\n\nNo, Johnson will (probably) not discourage the odd experiment in hairstyle if that is an outward manifestation of this fresh energy coursing through English rugby, and neither will the organisation that arches over all of them and is hardly known for being down with the kids, the RFU.\n\nThey have their sights set on 2015, and want a good few of these youngsters to be enlivening the England team by then. In the meantime, if the English clubs have to bend their knee occasionally to their spendthrift French rivals, so be it. Grow your own seems to be the order of the day, and in these difficult times it is not a bad way of going about things."
