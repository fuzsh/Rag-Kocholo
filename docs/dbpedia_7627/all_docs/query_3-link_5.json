We want the education we offer to have a real and lasting impact on their lives, not only in terms of academic outcomes as the tickets to the next stage but also in their personal development embodying the school's core values of Purposeful Engagement, Humble Ambition, Gracious Leadership and Courageous Attitude. Canfordians are known as decent, honest and capable young people, who aim high and want to make a positive difference not only to their own lives, but also to the lives of others.\n\nMaking a difference to the lives of others\n\nCanford has sponsored The Bourne Academy since 2010 and the successful partnership is a beacon of success in UK education. Mutual support, pride, ambition, trust and high expectations combine to allow impressive academic achievements against a background of respect.\n\n“We value our links with The Bourne Academy tremendously and there is a great mutual benefit to the staff and pupils at both our schools from our collaboration.” BEN VESSEY, HEADMASTER\n\nFind out more"
