        "text": "I am a human geographer who studies innovative responses to global environmental change in Australia and Southeast Asia. My current focus is on societal transitions towards more sustainable, ethical and just food systems. I work with concepts from political ecology and transitions research. I have three main research programs:\n\n1. Alternative protein futures. In this research program I explore how alternative protein industries (e.g. plant-based meats, precision fermentation, cultivated meat) are evolving in Australia and the challenges and barriers they experience. I am interested in how alternative proteins are narrated, politicised, imagined and materialised and their implications for people and place. Coming from a multispecies justice perspective I am interested in what worlds and opportunities alternative proteins are enabling and how they are enrolled in efforts to move away from animal agriculture. I welcome relevant research enquiries on subjects including veganism, vegetarianism, multispecies justice, food systems transitions, sustainability transitions, just transitions, and alternative proteins.\n\n2. Sustainable food systems. I am interested in how plant-based food systems can become more ethical and sustainable. Incorporating concepts from food justice I am interested in what enables and prevents food systems change. I am currently working on projects involving CSIRO, Hort Innovation and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research exploring the social dimensions of food transitions.\n\n3. Carbon forestry. I have previously focused on carbon forestry in Indonesia and continue to have an interest in this area. I am interested in the potential of carbon forestry, its internal contradictions and how people are interacting with this form of climate finance to pursue particular outcomes. I am particularly interested in how non-humans become entangled in carbon programs and what the opportunities and risks are for those involved.\n\nMost of my research focuses on Australia and countries within the Southeast Asian region, particularly Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Cambodia. I have supervised over 30 PhD and Masters students to completion and welcome research enquiries on any of these or related topics.\n\nCurrent HDR supervsion\n\nTshering Oâ€™Gorman, Milena Bojovic, Thuy Nguyen\n\nCompleted PhD supervision\n\nIoannis Rigkos, Tasmin-Lara Dilworth, Bryan Maher, Ashraful Alam, Sunita Chaudhary, Fabiola Figuerola, Rini Astuti, Rowan Dixon, Pete Howson, Rachel Tallon, Amanda Thomas, Guil Figgins, Anthony George, Chandima Dakson"
