        "text": "Harlequins will pay tribute to former Academy player Seb Adeniran-Olule ahead of their Aviva Premiership clash with Leicester Tigers at the Twickenham Stoop tonight.\n\nAdeniran-Olule, who also represented England at Under -20 level, died in a car accident aged 20 in May last year.\n\nThis is the first annual memorial match to celebrate the life of Adeniran-Olule. All proceeds will go to the Sebastian Adeniran-Olule Charitable Fund.\n\nThe Fund was set up in Seb’s memory to support those who would not normally be able to afford the academic and sporting opportunities he enjoyed.\n\nHarlequins Global Development and Academy Director, Tony Diprose, said: “Seb meant so much to everyone at Harlequins during his time here.\n\n“As a club, we wanted to remember and celebrate his all too short life. There is no better way to do so than with a match dedicated to his memory, the first in what will be an annual occasion.”\n\nThis evening, pupils from Adeniran-Olule’s former school, Wellington College, will assist in bucket collections and the selling of raffle tickets. The raffle includes prizes donated by Richmond FC and Greene King.\n\nMr Diprose added: “Supported by Whitgift School, Wellington College, Richmond FC and the RFU, we hope that the evening is a fitting tribute and raises lots of money for the Seb Adeniran-Olule Charitable Fund.”\n\nA song, written and recorded for Adeniran-Olule by one of his Wellington College house-mates can be downloaded here.\n\nFor more information on the Sebastian Adeniran-Olule Charitable Fund, or to donate, please visit the Virgin Money Just Giving page by clickinghere."
