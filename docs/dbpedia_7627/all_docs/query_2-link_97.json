Part of Dr. Williams’ scientific research involves unraveling the geologic history of Mars to understand the relative timing of impact cratering, volcanism, tectonics, wind-blown processes, and water flowing over and below the surface. This work includes images from Mars orbiters, which provide information over large areas at resolutions as fine as 20 cm per pixel. These orbital images also provide context for surface operations of past and present landers and rovers.\n\nPaul Vanouse, Professor, University at Buffalo\n\n[Exhibiting Artist] A Professor in the Department of Art at UB, Paul’s artwork employs molecular biology techniques to challenge entrenched notions of individual, racial, and national identity, and the cultural authority of DNA.
