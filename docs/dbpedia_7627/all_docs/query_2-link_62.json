        "text": "Introduction\n\nTo date, the majority of malaria serologic studies have focussed on antibody responses to a small number of well-characterised, highly immunogenic Plasmodium falciparum antigens that have proven to be reliable markers of exposure to infection [1–8]. However, P. falciparum expresses more than 5000 proteins, each a potential antibody target [9, 10]. Advances in technology have led to the development of new assay platforms that allow proteome scale investigation of antibody responses, such as the protein microarray [11, 12]—boasting significantly greater experimental throughput than more classical monoplex methods (e.g. ELISA) [13, 14]. The ability to simultaneously interrogate large numbers of putative targets, using low volumes of sample, significantly increases the rate at which an individual’s antibody responses to antigens can be characterised. As such, protein microarray based approaches to biomarker identification and humoral response profiling in malaria, and other infectious diseases, have been increasingly adopted [15–24].\n\nOne widely utilised form of the protein microarray is based on an in vitro transcription/ translation (IVTT) system [25]–where protein products are produced through a PCR, in vivo recombination cloning and an in vitro expression pipeline, before being printed onto arrays [15]. In principle, whole organism proteome microarrays can be fabricated simply and quickly, enabling analysis of all potential protein driven immune responses to a pathogen. Cell-free synthesis (CFS) is a technique first established over 50 years ago as a means to dissect the molecular mechanisms around protein expression. More recently, the technique has been used as a high throughput expression platform to explore a number of diverse biological processes [26, 27]. At its simplest, the approach utilises the crude extract containing the transcription and translation machinery from the cell, performing the process of protein expression without the constraints of the cell. This allows a wide variety of proteins to be expressed including those that would be deemed toxic if expression was attempted within the confines of the cell membrane [28]. CFS systems based on Escherichia coli (E.coli) are among the most widely used of the IVTT systems [27] and have helped to transform the narrative around a number of areas including biomarker discovery for infectious diseases [15, 29, 30]. Despite the widespread uptake of the approach there remain some issues around the technique. This includes significant heterogeneity of expression, leading some research groups to describe the mechanisms of the process as a “black box”. Therefore, the inherent heterogeneity between products is not assessed for every target making it difficult to normalise for reactivity between protein spots, which represent an impure mix of E. coli and target protein. In addition to the E. coli cell-free expression platform, other approaches have been employed in the characterisation of protein targets for immunological assessment. The wheat germ cell-free expression system in particular has also proven to be an important platform in the advancement of biomarker discovery and malaria vaccine research [31–34]. This is not the focus of the current study.\n\nIn contrast to the IVTT array methodology, the printing of purified proteins is cheaper and typically more quantifiable. Uniform amounts of product can therefore be incorporated into arrays, increasing confidence when comparing quantitative antibody responses between antigenic targets [35] and assessing relative immunogenicity. The process can be modified to support the scale up of recombinant proteins, and furthermore, affinity purification of protein targets reduces the risk of undesired background reactivity due to expression system components, and in part truncated proteins. However, the time required to produce panels of purified proteins is far in excess of the IVTT system, particularly for large numbers of targets, unless supported by an automated production platform [36–38]. For both the IVTT and purified protein E. coli systems, although the production of complex conformational proteins is possible it can sometimes be a challenge [39, 40]. These challenges are in part due to the expression of proteins foreign to the bacteria, the speed at which bacteria express proteins, only partially mitigated with a reduction in expression temperature; and the lack of essential molecular chaperones to aid correct folding/refolding of proteins [41–43].\n\nHere we present a comparison between IVTT based and purified proteins on a single microarray. For clarity proteins produced using the IVTT system will simply be referred to as IVTT proteins, and those produced by conventional E.coli expression will be referred to as purified proteins. Matched malarial protein targets from each methodology were assessed for comparative reactivity in serum from Ugandan participant samples (n = 899) [44] to determine the suitability of each approach in the context of high-throughput profiling of serological responses to protein antigens.\n\nDiscussion\n\nProtein microarrays are a practical approach to the serological screening of large numbers of putative malaria antigen biomarkers. The throughput and flexibility of the microarray platform presents an opportunity to interrogate malarial antibody responses at a scale far exceeding traditional mono- or multiplex approaches, agnostic of predicted immunological targets. Here we have evaluated matched antigenic targets produced using two E. coli-based expression techniques–in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT), and purified, whole-cell recombinants–in the context of a protein microarray. We found that the magnitude of antibody responses to purified protein targets was generally higher than for their IVTT counterparts, and that correlation between protein target pairs at the individual serum sample level was variable and related to degree of sequence homogeneity between targets. Our findings warn against direct comparisons of microarray data from proteins produced in different expression platforms without careful cross-validation of sequences and allelic types. However, our data do provide support for the use of both IVTT and purified protein microarray platforms in the context of early-stage antigen biomarker identification to feed into experimental pipelines where candidate proteins may be interrogated by methods providing higher resolution analysis.\n\nIn building this study, we predicted that the magnitude of responses to IVTT products–which tended to be longer, often representing single exon sequences and therefore potentially containing more epitopes–would be greater than purified targets truncated based on species-specificity or domain boundaries which potentially represented fewer epitopes. Contrary to this prediction, we found that purified proteins captured a greater range and magnitude of responses (Purified, IQR Log2MFI = 3.88–6.40; IVTT, IQR Log2MFI 0.46–1.68; p = <0.001). The greater level of reactivity to purified targets may relate to differences in the amount of protein deposited on the array, where consistent and defined amounts of purified protein are spotted in contrast to the unquantified, and likely variable IVTT products. These findings recommend a degree of caution in interpretation of array data from two different platforms, for example: MSP5 showed the second highest mean MFI for any purified protein, but showed among the lowest mean MFI of any IVTT protein.\n\nIn addition to differences in the magnitude of mean responses to targets stratified by expression system, we observed a greater range of individual sample responses, stratified by antigen, to purified proteins than in sequence matched IVTT-expressed targets (e.g. AMA1—IVTT_1, median [IQR] Log2MFI = 1.66 [0.80–2.53]; Pure_1 (Pichia pastoris produced), median [IQR] Log2MFI = 7.92 [6.16–8.52]; p = <0.001). The P. pastoris AMA1 was included as a control for the evaluation of the production of a conformational protein. AMA1 is a complex structure comprised of three domains defined by three disulphide bonds. Production of AMA1 in P. pastoris has been fully characterised in terms of correct folding of the purified protein [53, 55] and this observation is likely a reflection of antibody reactivity to correctly folded (P. pastoris) and incorrectly folded AMA1 (IVTT). We acknowledge that a lack of correct folding in other purified and IVTT products may impact on epitope recognition by antibodies raised to native protein during infection. However, human antibody responses are composed of a polyclonal response to each antigen, which will include both confirmation and linear epitopes. Whilst questions remain about the appropriateness of using unfolded protein fragments in serological screens, such reagents remain the most widely utilised and efficient approach in this context at present.\n\nConsidering all antigenic targets together, we found no evidence of correlation in mean reactivity to sequence matched targets between expression systems (rs = 0.28, p = 0.23). In the context of this study, this was not unexpected taking into account the differences observed in magnitude of response between IVTT and purified proteins, and that the length of native protein sequence coverage between IVTT and purified targets was highly variable. More broadly, it is perhaps less reassuring that matched targets derived from different expression systems lack more obvious relationships in antibody response than have been demonstrated in other studies [17, 56], though Kobayashi et al. report relatively similar results for a smaller number of targets expressed in E. coli (purified proteins) and IVTT systems specifically [30]. It is likely that protein concentration disparities between the two approaches are one of the drivers of this heterogeneity. However, without attempting to quantify the exact amount of protein generated in the small volume of IVTT reactions we are unable to address this here. Although in this current study targets grouped by antigen displayed highly variable correlations of response, it is encouraging that sequence matched proteins did generally display stronger correlations of response than non-sequence matched targets. Further, this may indicate the importance of capturing specific epitopes within expression sequences when producing antigens by either expression method.\n\nDespite the lack of a clearly defined relationship between antigen-matched targets from the evaluated expression systems, we remain confident that microarrays utilising IVTT or purified recombinant proteins are able to produce compelling and biologically relevant data. Indeed, our data show age-dependent trends in antibody responses (typical of highly endemic populations) [1–3] irrespective of expression system (S3 Fig), lending weight to the applicability of either methodology in serological assays [57–70].\n\nThe IVTT system lends itself to microarray applications, as vast numbers of proteins, or even entire proteomes, may be produced at scale relatively quickly. However, for application to serology there is concern that expressed proteins are not quantified before printing, and that expression levels of product may vary considerably; product yield in bacterial-based IVTT systems is generally considered to be lower (typically ~1 mg mL-1 or less) though higher protein yields have been reported [71, 72]. This has been shown to be due to an inherent heterogeneity with IVTT components, although this weakness is an area of active research [26, 73]. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that the un-purified nature of printed reaction mixtures may mask, or otherwise adversely affect, the detection of antibody reactivity in a sample; Davies et al. report IVTT reaction compositions of 99% E. coli lysate to 1% target protein [15], though this will vary considerably, at scale, in practice.\n\nIn contrast to IVTT-based microarrays, printing purified protein allows a highly quantifiable approach to be taken. Affinity purification and dialysis of expression products substantially reduces the risk of background reactivity to bacterial components, and the simple determination of target protein concentrations allows defined quantities of product to be spotted, providing much greater confidence when comparing reactivity between targets. However, these advantages come at a substantial cost; the need for in silico analysis to design vectors, transfection procedures, expression and purification drastically slows the rate at which putative targets can be produced and screened. Shorter, epitope specific sequences may in theory be transposed from IVTT systems with a view to generating more granular serological screens, though we accept that truncated protein targets will in some cases favour linear B cell epitopes, while missing conformational epitopes. However, for measuring exposure to infection there is less importance on the targeting of confirmation epitopes than would be required for protective epitopes [57].\n\nThe primary benefit of the microarray platform is the ability to screen orders of magnitude more targets simultaneously than more standard serological assays. Our analysis shows that both IVTT and purified proteins can be successfully used to capture malarial protein-antigen specific antibody responses on a protein microarray. Although correlations of response between expression systems are not as strong as may have been expected, a number of acknowledged technical differences in the methods of protein production may account for this finding. In addition to the E. coli in vivo and IVTT systems utilised here, high-throughput wheat germ cell free systems have been successfully used to conduct large scale serological screens of putative antigen biomarkers [74, 75], alongside chemically synthesised peptide arrays [57, 62]. High-throughput mammalian and baculovirus expression systems have also been pioneered for the production of recombinant proteins [36, 76]. Differences in expression efficiency and the homology to native epitopes achieved by the assortment of available approaches likely have considerable impact on the capture of antibody from sample. This variability should be accounted for both in terms of choosing an experimental approach and comparative analysis between different methods. We suggest that further investigation of differences in seroreactivity to sequence-matched proteins derived from contrasting expression systems is needed to shed light on the parity between such data that is already widely published. It should also be noted that it is unlikely that any single expression platform will satisfy the demands of all recombinant expression projects due to varying importance such as protein folding, proteins activity (e.g. enzymes) and glycosylation. In addition, E. coli expression has the advantage of low cost, flexibility and easy scale-up.\n\nConsidering the data presented here more broadly, observed trends lend support to the utilisation of both IVTT and purified arrays depending on the objectives and context of hypotheses to be investigated. The strengths and weaknesses of each expression system should dictate the chosen approach on a case-by-case basis. For example, very high-density proteome level screening to identify ‘shortlists’ of candidate markers based on binary categorisation of seropositivity may be best achieved using IVTT systems. In contrast, smaller numbers of ‘shortlisted’ targets expressed as purified proteins may allow for more nuanced characterisation of antibody responses on a more continuous scale. As already described, the key limitation in the production of purified recombinants in our current expression pipeline is throughput. The adaption of our methods to increase the capacity of protein production would improve our ability to more widely mine the biomarker information derived from the IVTT platform. As such, we are currently exploring a number of existing approaches to address this methodological bottleneck [38, 77].\n\nIn summary, the IVTT protein microarray approach has proven to be a powerful, high-throughput, biomarker discovery platform with applicability across a range of infectious diseases. When combined with a cheap, scalable and flexible protein expression platform such as the E. coli in vivo expression platform we have the ability to mine potential diagnostic and vaccine related targets."
