        "text": "Harlequins confirmed on Wednesday 31 May 2017 that former Washington Huskies linebacker, Psalm Wooching, will be in their 16-man squad to participate in the Beachcomber World Club 10s tournament in Mauritius on 17 & 18 June 2017.\n\n23-year-old Wooching recently turned down the opportunity to play professionally in the NFL to pursue his first love of playing rugby.\n\nThe centre/winger developed his rugby skills in his native Hawaii and represented Kealakeha High School and Washington University before his talents caught the eyes of the American Football Coaches. Having converted back to rugby union, he recently had a trial with French Top 14 side Pau as well as being an athlete within the Atavus Rugby Development programme in Seattle.\n\nConfirming the news, Harlequins Academy and Global Development Director, Tony Diprose, said: “This will be a great opportunity and experience for Psalm to continue his pathway into rugby from American Football; we are very excited to have him within our ranks for the World Club 10s.\n\n“It also provides Harlequins with the opportunity to have a good look at him in a high-quality international tournament such as this one. This will also give him the chance to see how an elite professional rugby team operates.\n\n“The opportunity to welcome Psalm on board has come with the help of Atavus and as part of Harlequins’ commitment to developing rugby in the USA. Following the World Club 10s tournament, Gary Street and I will return to America to expand our ever growing roots in San Francisco and California.”\n\nHarlequins will travel to Mauritius ahead of the tournament which starts on Friday 17th June and will compete alongside the Toyota Cheetahs, Road Safety Western Force, Plus500 Brumbies, the Vodacom Blue Bulls, the Tsunami Pyrenees, the Kubota Spears and the APD’s invitational side.\n\nThe full 16 man Harlequins squad will be confirmed in the coming days.\n\nThe Beachcomber World Club 10s is fully sanctioned by World Rugby, Rugby Afrique and Rugby Union Mauritius.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nAdendorff leads Vodacom Blue Bulls to Mauritius\n\nFive Blitzboks in Vodacom Blue Bulls squad for Beachcomber World Club 10s\n\nMeet The Team – Harlequins"
