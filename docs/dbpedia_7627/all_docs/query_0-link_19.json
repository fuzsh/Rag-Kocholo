She kept the match statistics and provided short, pithy comments on each match. The Pressmen depended on her\n\n2/9/1995\n\nv Garryowen, Home. Won 62-19. Team:- Callard (T, 7c & 1p), Lumsden (Tx2), de Glanville, Guscott (T), Sleightholme, Catt (T), Nicol (T), Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Ojomoh (Tx2), Clarke (T). Replacements – Johnson, McCarthy (blood rep. Dawe), Crompton Ref – Chris Reeks. Ground – Good. Weather – Bright\n\nWhat a great display of running, 15-man rugby to celebrate the start of the new professional (!) season. Poor Garryowen, who had had a great deal of injury trouble, including Paul Hogan wrecking his ankle outside the Hilton on the morning of the match, didn’t know what hit them as Bath piled on a display that was a pleasure to watch. Outstanding were Lumsden, Catt, de Glanville, the whole back row, but it is invidious to single out any one from this tremendous team display. Nice to see a first outing for Nicol who played well. Once tuned up to Bath’s speed, he should be formidable.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nAFTER 17 months waiting to make his Bath debut, Andy Nicol wasted no time getting on the scoresheet.\n\nJust 11 minutes into the new rugby season, the 24-year-old Scottish international scrum-half collected an inside pass from Audley Lumsden to snatch the opening try.\n\nHis teammates eventually ran in another eight to rattle up 60 points against their Irish visitors. For Nicol, a management trainee with Mardons Packaging in Bristol, it was the perfect start.\n\n“It has been 17 months since I first registered for Bath,” he said afterwards. “It’s been a long wait to play a first team game and it went well.\n\n“No problems about the knee – obviously that was a hard game, not so much physical, but there was certainly a lot of running in it.\n\n“It was valuable because next week there will be more of the same.”\n\nBoth coach Brian Ashton and first team manager John Hall intimated that, apart from the injured Simon Geoghegan, this was the strongest team currently available.\n\nSo Bath are likely to start the Courage League campaign with virtually the same line-up at West Hartlepool on Saturday.\n\nTheir opponents from Limerick defended doggedly throughout the first half and trailed only 20-13 at the interval.\n\nLumsden crossed in the corner after unrelenting pressure to score Bath’s second try and Ben Clarke strolled through almost unopposed from another “tap and run.”\n\nBut Garryowen kept in touch through debutant fly-half Barry Everet, who kicked two penalties and then pounced for a charge-down try from a loose kick by Jon Sleightholme.\n\nEverett’s economical kicking style earned him two more penalties early in the second half as he accounted for all his side’s 19 points.\n\nAt this point, however, Bath were just getting into their stride, displaying a fluency and flair that was far beyond their opponents’ capabilities.\n\nSteve Ojomoh took the direct route through a maul for the fourth try and Jeremy Guscott slipped over in the corner almost unnoticed ten minutes later.\n\nJon Callard started and finished a counter-attack for the next and Ojomoh grabbed his second from a slick set move.\n\nFinger-tip passing at speed provided Lumsden with another and Mike Catt, with a superb sidestep and searing acceleration, brought up the 60 points. Callard’s seventh conversion brought his tally to 22 points.\n\nSCORERS: 11 mins – Nicol try, 5-nil; 15 mins – Everet pen, 5-3; 16 mins – Callard pen, 8-3; 22 mins – Lumsden try, 13-3; 30 mins – Clarke try, Callard conv, 20-3; 32 mins – Everet pen, 20-6; 34 mins – Everet try & conv, 20-13 (H-T); 42 mins – Everet pen, 20-16; 44 mins – Ojomoh try, Callard conv, 27-16; 46 mins – Everet pen, 27-19; 54 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 34-19; 64 mins – Callard try & conv, 41-19; 70 mins – Ojomoh try, Callard conv, 48-19; 74 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 55-19; Catt try, Callard conv, 62-19.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nGARRYOWEN: Larkin; Niland, Wallace, Danaher, Brooks (rep Kilroy, 60 mins); Everet, McIvor; Spain, Linnane (rep Humphries, 51 mins), Ronan, Coughlan, O’Connor, Birmingham, O’Sullivan, O’Donoghue.\n\nREFEREE: Chris Reeks (Somerset Soc).\n\n9/9/1995\n\nv West Hartlepool, Away. Won 20-15. Team:- Callard (5p), Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme (T), Catt, Nicol, Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Ojomoh, Clarke. Replacements – Sanders, French, Mallett Ref – B Campsall. Ground – Good. Weather – Fine\n\nNot a very auspicious start to the league season. After a bright start, Bath lost their way in the second half allowing a sharp and determined West to give them a bit of a fright. Some pernickety refereeing did not help. My man of the match was Yates, who was outstanding both in tight and loose. Callard cool as usual and saved the day with some finely struck penalties. No one else particularly covered himself in glory and Catt was particularly disappointing.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTWO unsuspecting Bath players will find themselves under the spotlight this week.\n\nThe club already video their matches but have now decided to target an extra camera on individuals – with one player being targeted in each half.\n\nIt shows no detail is being overlooked as Bath strive to regain the Courage League title from Leicester.\n\nBut on the evidence of this opening game, it could be an embarrassing exercise, particularly for anyone singled out for attention in the second half.\n\nFrom looking a slick, confident outfit, Bath slipped into their old bad habits of giving away penalties, making unforced errors and continually arguing the toss with the referee.\n\nAt one point Yorkshire official Brian Campsall summoned new skipper Phil de Glanville to issue a warning about persistent infringement.\n\nThe Pilkington Cup holders were conceding a penalty every minute at this stage and being pinned back in the corners by the impressive boot of West’s full-back, Tim Stimpson.\n\nFortunately, the line-out went well and the Bath defence held its nerve as West searched in vain for a score in the last quarter.\n\nDe Glanville was clearly relieved to pick up two points, thanks to Jon Sleightholme’s first-half try and five penalties from Jon Callard, but his concern was just as obvious.\n\n“I have to say I am disappointed with the second half,” said the international centre. “We tied up a little bit, went into our shells and didn’t help ourselves by giving away a lot of penalties.\n\n“With Stimpson kicking superbly as he was, we found ourselves under pressure and couldn’t break out of that stranglehold.\n\n“Every time we threatened to, we dropped the ball or were penalised. We’re our own worst enemies at times.”\n\nParticularly worrying was Mike Catt’s tendency to lose his cool at the slightest physical contact, a weakness which could get him sent off one day.\n\nThe England full-back had one of his more forgettable games at fly-half, repeatedly missing touch and generally failing to provide the direction the side desperately needed.\n\nOne or two escaped the general criticism. Callard’s place-kicking was again virtually faultless while Ben Clarke repeatedly broke through the uncompromising West tackling.\n\nBut the outstanding figure in the pack was young loosehead, Kevin Yates, whose impressive all round contribution was very nearly rewarded with a score.\n\nInstead, the only try went to left wing Sleightholme. He turned in one of his more convincing displays and left his marker for dead on a sprint to the corner after Jeremy Guscott had made the space.\n\nBut the home side refused to knuckle under, underlining the impression that Brierton Road will be an unforgiving destination for many sides again this season.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: inconsistent\n\nSCORERS: 5 mins – Callard pen, nil-3; 14 mins – Callard pen, nil-6; 19 mins – Stimpson pen, 3-6; 23 mins – Callard pen, 3-9; 34 mins – Sleightholme try, 3-14; 37 mins – Stimpson pen, 6-14; 40 mins – Callard pen, 6-17 (H-T); 43 mins – Stimpson pen, 9-17; 50 mins – Stimpson pen, 12-17; 58 mins – Hodder dropped goal, 15-17; 59 mins – Callard pen, 15-20.\n\nWEST HARTLEPOOL: Stimpson; Evans, Elwine, Lee, Jones; Hodder, Cook; Lancaster, Herbert, Shelley, Dixon, Westgarth, Mitchell, Wainwright, Brown.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Campsall (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – overcast; pitch – very good.\n\n16/9/1995\n\nv Gloucester, Home. Won 37.11 Team:- Callard (2c & 5p), Lumsden (T), de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme (T), Catt, Nicol (T), Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Peters, Ojomoh. Replacements – Johnson, McCarthy, Crompton Ref – S Piercy. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Overcast\n\nAnother pernickety referee nearly ruined this local derby as a spectacle. However, Bath, not quite firing on all cylinders but showing some great imagination and pace, soon put paid to a lacklustre Gloucester who really had nothing much to recommend them. Lumsden was again outstanding, as was Callard. Yates again prominent in the pack and Robinson his usual ubiquitous self.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nIF Bath ever wondered how they would cope after the retirement of ace try scorer Tony Swift, Audley Lumsden is providing some answers.\n\nIt was the 28-year-old schoolteacher’s clever change of pace which bamboozled his opponent and completed the rout of their West Country rivals.\n\nIt’s more than six years since a broken neck robbed Lumsden of a probable England cap and further leg injuries seemed to rob him of his appetite for the game.\n\nBut now he’s filling the right wing position so capably that team manager John Hall is tipping him for a belated international career.\n\n“If Audley carries on playing like he is at the moment then I can see him with an England shirt on his back” said Hall. “He’s such a talented footballer.\n\n“He’s wanted to play full-back in the past but we’ve had to put him on the wing. Now he is fully committed to the position, he’s come through and shown what a class player he is.”\n\nIrish star Simon Geoghegan is expected to return to training this week after giving a troublesome groin strain a long rest following the World Cup.\n\nBut again, with Jon Sleightholme looking increasingly confident on the left wing, there is no need to push Geoghegan into a premature and perhaps damaging return.\n\nSleightholme also collected a try which demonstrated his new-found assurance. The England A cap fielded a loose kick on his 22 and, haring across field, found skipper Phil de Glanville with a long pass.\n\nThe centre booted the ball upfield and when it bounced unkindly for Tim Smith, the speedy Sleightholme appeared from nowhere to hack on and claim the score.\n\nPre-season talk of Jon Callard having to give way to Mike Catt to further the fly-half’s England career at full-back is looking more and more irrelevant these days.\n\nIt was Callard’s now-indispensable boot that pulled Bath ahead to 9-3 when referee Stuart Piercy was awarding penalties for a mystifying range of offences in the first half.\n\nAndy Nicol then squeezed over for a try and another Callard penalty and a Catt dropped goal left the home side comfortably ahead at 20-3 at the interval.\n\nOld Gloucester forwards like the famed `Digger’ Morris cringed as their front five was taken apart in the second half.\n\nThat was embarrassingly highlighted in the 65th minute when the Bath pack drove fully 45 metres from a line-out, more at a sprint than a canter.\n\nAfter Sleightholme’s score Bath really let rip but the finishing is still not as sharp as it could be.\n\nThey were restricted to just one more score as intelligent work by Nicol and de Glanville on the left eventually provided the opportunity on the right for Lumsden.\n\nCallard converted to bring his tally to 19 points and Holford’s 76th minute try was really no consolation to the Gloucester faithful.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING: three stars\n\nBATH FORM: expansive\n\nSCORERS: 4 mins – Callard pen, 3-nil; 6 mins – Lee Osborne pen, 3-3; 18 mins – Callard pen, 6-3; 31 mins – Callard pen, 9-3; 35 mins – Nicol try; 38 mins – Callard pen, 17-3; 40 mins – Catt dropped goal, 20-3 (H-T); 47 mins – Callard pen, 23-3; 52 mins – Martin Kimber dropped goal, 23-6; 60 mins – Sleightholme try, Callard conv, 30-6; 71 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 37-6; 76 mins – Holford try, 37-11.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Peters, Ojomoh, Robinson.\n\nGLOUCESTER: T Smith; Holford, Cummins (rep Beck, 32 mins), Roberts (rep Keyse, 73 mins), Osborne; Fenley, Kimber; Martin, Greening, Deacon, Cornwell, West, Glanville, Raymond, I Smith.\n\nREFEREE: Stuart Piercy (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS; weather – overcast, showers; pitch – well grassed.\n\n23/9/1995\n\nv Leicester, Away. Won 14-9. Team:- Callard (3p), Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo (T), Catt, Nicol, Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Ojomoh, Clarke. Replacements – Sanders, French, Hilton Ref – Tony Rowlands. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Sunny\n\nThis was the game that saw the unveiling of the new Leicester Stand (although not officially until a later game), and very impressive it is too. Pity the game wasn’t as impressive. I don’t think I have ever seen an enjoyable Bath/Leicester tussle. Once again, a fair bit of niggle between the front rows. Packs fairly equal (apart from the lineout where Bath never came to terms with Johnson), but we were superior in the backs and the defence was tremendous. The sole try was a long-distance breakaway by Adabayo. But at least we beat ‘em! This weekend see the odd sight of Harlequins at the top of the league! Sir John Hall was at this game – I shouldn’t think he saw much to impress, although the rookie Welsh ref was slightly better than those seen recently.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nA BRAVE decision to select Adedayo Adebayo little more than a week after his return from New Zealand paid off spectacularly for Bath.\n\nIn fact it was almost too spectacular as the England tourist finished off a 65-metre dash with an extravagant dive over the try line.\n\nWhether Adebayo actually touched the ball down according to the letter of the law is open to doubt, but there was enough “downward pressure” to satisfy Welsh referee Tony Rowlands.\n\n“As a touch-down it wasn’t the best executed,” admitted the left wing. “I had no doubts at the time but having looked at the TV replay well, I’ll leave it at that!” he added, with a laugh.\n\nAdebayo looked particularly sharp after spending the summer with Southland, including an epic Ranfurly Shield encounter with Canterbury, but he was surprised to be called up.\n\n“To be honest, I didn’t expect to play today. It was a brave decision to pick me and, fortunately, it worked well.”\n\nEven as early as this in the Courage League season, taking two points from the champions at Welford Road represents a huge step in Bath’s bid to regain the title.\n\nThe air of crushing disappointment among the 16,000 Tigers fans – and the firmly closed home dressing room door – told the story. It was their first home league defeat in nearly two years.\n\nDespite the strength of the Leicester front five, Bath held the upper hand in the loose where Ben Clarke, Steve Ojomoh and especially Andy Robinson made an immense contribution.\n\nAll Tigers skipper Dean Richards had to show for his efforts was a yellow card after being flagged for foul play by the touch judge.\n\nThe try that settled a tense match of low ambition came on the hour when Bath had begun to wind up the tempo, recycling the ball quickly between forwards and backs.\n\nIt’s second nature to the Bath players but Leicester are happier to let things revolve around the set-piece, particularly the line-out where Martin Johnson won any amount of ball.\n\nSo as Leicester were drawn into spreading the ball wider themselves, they came unstuck. Neil Back threw a wild pass and John Liley could only knock it into Adebayo’s path.\n\nJon Callard, already successful with two out of three penalty attempts, missed the conversion and Liley pulled back the home side back to 9-11 with his third penalty.\n\nBath were on the defensive for the last 10 minutes but, with Jeremy Guscott tackling superbly, they never lost their nerve.\n\nIncreasingly desperate, Leicester lacked the poise to unlock the defence and gave away two penalties for obstructing tacklers. The second gave Callard his third penalty in injury time.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING: two stars\n\nBATH FORM: unflustered\n\nSCORERS: 5 mins – Callard pen, nil-3; 7 mins – Liley pen, 3-3; 12 mins – Liley pen, 6-3 (H-T); 50 mins – Callard pen, 6-6; 61 mins – Adebayo try, 6-11; 70 mins – Liley pen, 9-11; 82 mins – Callard pen, 9-14.\n\nLEICESTER: Liley; Hackney, Potter, Robinson, R Underwood; Malone, Hamilton; Rowntree, Cockerill, Garforth, Johnson, Poole, Wells, Richards, Back.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nREFEREE: Tony Rowlands (Welsh RFU).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – perfect.\n\n30/9/1995\n\nv Orrell, Home. Won 55-20. Team:- Callard (Tx2, 6c & 1p), Lumsden, de Glanville (T), Guscott (T), Adebayo (Tx2), Catt (T), Nicol, Yates, Dawe, Ubogu (T), Haag, Redman, Robinson, Ojomoh, Clarke. Replacements – Johnson, McCarthy, Crompton Ref – A Rowden. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Overcast\n\nAt last, Bath looked as though they were beginning to click into gear with a fast and furious performance of running rugby. Some of the ideas were so outrageous that they were bound to misfire, but the invention, wit and speed of the whole thing was at times breathtaking. Orrell never gave up and ran till the end, but on the whole they were outclassed and out-thought. No individual stars, it was a glorious team effort.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nHOW ironic that under Phil de Glanville’s leadership, centre partner Jeremy Guscott is at last beginning to show his true class.\n\nIn taking over as captain at Bath, one of de Glanville’s declared aims, aside from furthering his own England career, was to get “big games from the big names.”\n\nEveryone knew who he was talking about and Guscott has responded in recent weeks with his best performances for a long time, certainly since before the pelvic injury that ruled him out of the game for a year.\n\nAgainst Leicester, his defensive work was of the highest quality but, as Orrell discovered, the famed attacking flair is re-emerging too.\n\nGuscott, who finished off a wonderful 90 metre move for Bath’s fourth try, acknowledges that he has been under pressure from his centre partner but has clearly worked hard since the World Cup.\n\n“I’m trying to build a little more into the season, in terms of my fitness, pace and power,” said the man who has won 39 caps for England and played five British Isles Tests.\n\n“I’m looking to be at my peak, hopefully, in readiness for South Africa. But that all depends on selection.”\n\nDe Glanville recognises the cruel reality that an in-form Guscott is likely to slam the door on his own England chances, unless Will Carling is cast into the wilderness, which is unlikely.\n\n“It’s frustrating – it has been for two years. I’ve got used to it but that doesn’t mean it’s any less frustrating,” said the Bath skipper.\n\n“But if Bath win the double, I’ll be happy,” added de Glanville, whose own form is quite comfortably international class.\n\nFor the moment he can gain huge satisfaction from the blistering start that Bath have made to the new Courage League campaign.\n\nEight tries against Orrell lifted the points tally to 126 in just four games but it was the manner of the victory that was especially heartening.\n\nThe first try came on two minutes after Bath had burst out of the blocks, ignoring the boring old boot downfield to keep the ball in hand. The only interruptions from kick-off to Adedayo Adebayo touching down were a scrum and a tapped free-kick.\n\nJon Callard, who finished with 25 points, converted from the touchline before replying to a Simon Mason penalty with a 25-metre kick of his own.\n\nAdebayo’s second try followed a breathtaking passage of play – England selector Mike Slemen, also coaching adviser to Orrell, reckoned it came from eighth phase possession!\n\nCallard added a third in the same left hand corner, his well-struck conversion making the score 24-3 as Bath motored along at a point a minute.\n\nAnother Mason penalty stirred Bath into the superb Guscott effort on the stroke of half-time. Bath were actually defending deep in their own 22 but stole the ball and launched Adebayo from under their own posts before Catt made the link.\n\nOrrell, who actually defended tolerably well, responded with a close-range try by Scotland A hooker Martin Scott.\n\nBut Bath were on high-octane stuff and Victor Ubogu and de Glanville added further tries before the visitors fashioned a well-worked score for centre Paul Johnson.\n\nA Catt try and another for Callard, both converted by the prolific full-back, brought up the half-century for Bath for only the fourth time in the league.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – four stars\n\nBATH FORM: dynamic\n\nSCORERS: 2 mins – Adebayo try, Callard conv, 7-nil; 5 mins – Mason pen, 7-3; 7 mins – Callard pen, 10-3; 15 mins – Adebayo try, Callard conv, 17-3; 23 mins – Callard try & conv, 24-3; 29 mins – Mason pen, 24-6; 39 mins – Guscott try, 31-6 (H-T); 51 mins – Scott try, Mason conv, 31-13; 58 mins – Ubogu try, 36-13; 64 mins – de Glanville try, 41-13; 71 mins – Johnson try, Mason conv, 41-20; 77 mins – Catt try, Callard conv, 48-20; 81 mins – Callard try & conv, 55-20.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nORRELL: Mason; Naylor, Wynn, Johnson, Smith; Hamer, Healey; Winstanley, Scott, Cundick, Cusani (rep Parr, 50 mins), Glynn, Huxley, Bibby, Manley.\n\nREFEREE: Ashley Rowden (Berkshire Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – dull, some drizzle; pitch – lush.\n\n7/10/1995\n\nv Wasps, Away.

Replacements – Sanders, French, Ubogu Ref – Ed Morrison. Ground – Weedy and a bit clogged. Weather – Overcast drizzle\n\nOh what a disappointment! This game was billed as showing the way for running rugby and turned out to be a bit of a fiasco. Neither side could get going and Bath won by the strength of their defence, coupled with their ability to take their chances when they arose (seldom). Rob Andrew had a nightmare of a match, proving perhaps that Newcastle and Wasps don’t mix. So Bath remain top of the table with Harlequins, thanks mainly to Robinson (again!) and de Glanville. This was the game that Ubogu was dropped. Watch this space! This was also the game when the great de Glanville reached his 100th game for Bath.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nIF Jack Rowell is serious in his intention to play an out-and-out tearaway in the England back row this season, it’s hard to see how he can totally ignore Andy Robinson.\n\nThe Bath flanker is not in the England squad – that honour goes to Leicester’s Neil Back and the newcomer from Harlequins, Rory Jenkins.\n\nBut, as Wasps discovered, the battle-hardened Robinson remains the supreme exponent of the openside’s arts.\n\nHis uncanny anticipation and sheer street-wisdom, welded to extraordinary mental and physical resilience, make him indispensable to Bath.\n\nRobinson’s form is one very good reason why Bath are virtually unbeatable at the moment and he could certainly help England make the transition to a more fluid style.\n\nBath play the 15-man game more effectively than any other side but sometimes, as at Sudbury, a more pragmatic approach prevails.\n\nIt was not pretty, but the Courage League leaders can strike with deadly effect when opponents make mistakes in the 22, as Wasps did.\n\nThe man to profit was left wing Adedayo Adebayo whose two tries brought his tally to five in three games.\n\nRobinson admitted that Bath had not played with the sort of ambition constantly being demanded by skipper Phil de Glanville, the other outstanding figure in a poor match.\n\n“But playing up here is not the same as at the Rec,” said Robinson. “All the same, we’ve gone to Wasps and Leicester in recent weeks and won, whereas last year we lost. That’s two good results.”\n\nBath’s determination to regain the league this season is exemplified by the decision to throw away the tackle bags clubs normally use for training sessions.\n\nIt’s all fierce bodily contact work, which helps to remind the first-teamers that there are plenty of players in the United who want their places. And that suits an old campaigner like Robinson.\n\n“The training’s been tremendous this year,” he said. “Because people are more body-hardened in the training sessions, you get used to the knocks and there seem to be fewer injuries.”\n\nRobinson had a hand, or a foot, in both Bath tries. The first came when a 22 drop-out by Rob Andrew hit him on the boot and Bath won two rucks to put Adedayo Adebayo over in the corner.\n\nThe second resulted from a poor pass to the hapless Andrew who collected the ball and Robinson at the same time. A split-second later Ben Clarke’s knee accidentally caught him in the face.\n\nAs a concerned Clarke bent over his England teammate, Bath worked the ball away to the left where Adebayo collected his second try. While Andrew staggered off with blood pouring from a gashed brow and another wound inside his mouth, Callard kicked the conversion.\n\nIn typically outspoken mood, team manager John Hall branded Bath’s first-half performance as “inept” and accused his players of operating “in the comfort zone.”\n\nThe first 40 minutes were indeed pretty poor fare, with scoring restricted to a penalty apiece for Jon Callard and Rob Andrew.\n\nAs in the Pilkington Cup final last May, Bath found themselves under heavy pressure, particularly in a five-minute period at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe closest Wasps came to scoring was when impressive Wasps No 8 Peter Scrivener lost the ball over the try-line. The home side kept battering away but Bath’s decision to field David Hilton instead of Victor Ubogu was justified as Wasps were repulsed at a succession of close range scrums.\n\nEventually, Buster White was forced into touch at the corner by Audley Lumsden and Mike Catt cleared the danger after Martin Haag won the line-out.\n\nAndrew had a dreadful afternoon, kicking one out of seven penalties and having five kicks charged down. He did succeed with a dropped goal to give Wasps a short-lived lead but even that was touched in flight by Catt.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: unforgiving\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Callard pen, nil-3; 7 mins – Andrew pen, 3-3; 55 mins – Andrew dropped goal, 6-3; 59 mins – Adebayo try, 6-8; 79 mins – Adebayo try, Callard conv, 6-15.\n\nWASPS: Ufton; P Hopley, D Hopley, James (rep Gomarsall, 63 mins), Roiser; Andrew (rep James, 80 mins), Bates; Popplewell, Dunn, Dunston, Greenwood, Ryan, Dallaglio, Scrivener, White.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt, Nicol; Yates, Dawe, Hilton, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nREFEREE: Ed Morrison (Bristol Soc.).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – dull, windy; pitch – good.\n\n14/10/1995\n\nv Bristol, Home.

Replacements – Johnson, McCarthy, Yates Ref – B Campsall. Ground – Perfect. Weather – Hot and perfect\n\nWow! This was the game that gave you back your faith in rugby! Bath played the most outstanding 15-man game seen for many a long while. Invidious to pick out anyone specific, but again Robinson was everywhere. Sander’s return went very well and he certainly distributes the ball swiftly. Jack Rowell was in the crowd, so I hope he learnt a thing or two. Bristol, even with their much vaunted pack, were vastly disappointing.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nA DECADE or more of Bath dominance has been hard for their near-neighbours to bear.\n\nBut how on earth do they come to terms with the awful truth that the gap is widening?\n\nOn the evidence of this record defeat, there is a huge gulf between the sides – not just in ability but in the whole approach to the game.\n\nThe only consolation for someone like Kyran Bracken is that, as England scrum-half in waiting, he can look forward to loading the bullets for the likes of Catt, Guscott and de Glanville.\n\nBracken was as shell-shocked as the rest of the Bristol contingent, particularly since he had been suffering from a virus all week.\n\nBut that did not stop him offering a generous appraisal of a side who are already setting a red-hot pace for the rest of the First Division.\n\nAll Bristol’s brave talk of taking a stranglehold up front was blown away in 80 minutes of joyous running rugby from Bath, each of their seven tries drawing huge roars of appreciation from the full house at the Rec.\n\nBracken, not afraid to mention his opponents in the same breath as the All Blacks, did not let the crushing disappointment hide his admiration.\n\n“That’s the way I hope to see England playing this year. It’s the way I like to play. They were just out of this world,” he ventured.\n\n“It was almost like playing sevens. We were kicking off, losing possession, and they weren’t giving it back.\n\n“They don’t kick for line-outs. They just try to keep possession, nicking any ball they can, rucking and running, rucking and running – and there’s nothing you can do.\n\n“Obviously it was very difficult for Bristol but Bath are playing the sort of rugby the All Blacks have been playing.”\n\nIf there was ever any doubt as to how the league leaders would approach the game, it was revealed in the surprise choice of their own scrum-half.\n\nOut went Andy Nicol, of Scotland and the British Lions, and in came Ian Sanders, whose only international experience has been with England Emerging Players.\n\nBut reputation has never dictated selection at Bath. They just knew that the 24-year-old policeman has much the faster service and it would help to ensure that the match did not degenerate into a dog-fight up front.\n\nIt worked like a dream. At restart kicks especially, Nigel Redman and others merely had to tap the ball down in Sanders direction for it to be whipped lightning-quick to Catt and out there in the wide-open spaces the damage was done.\n\nBristol, again forced into fielding two young centres on the wings in Kevin Maggs and Mark Denney, were neatly unzipped as early as the eighth minute, following a tapped penalty.\n\nAdedayo Adebayo, in a rich vein of form on the Bath left, took out two defenders on the touchline and Jeremy Guscott accepted a return pass for the try.\n\nJon Callard swapped penalties with Mark Tainton, who had actually opened the scoring, but Bath stretched further ahead when the Bristol defence were so heavily committed that Guscott only had to round Alan Sharp to score under the posts.\n\nThe Scotland loosehead was expected to play a vital role in disrupting Bath’s scrummage but Bristol were twice penalised for collapsing and late in the game lost a strike against the head.\n\nNor did Bristol achieve their customary dominance in the line-out, where Redman and Haag varied their tactics intelligently. It was clear that Simon Shaw is still coming to terms with the move from front jumper to middle.\n\nBristol’s best chance of a try when the match was still a contest came just before half-time but Tainton had to stretch just that little bit too far for a pass and spilled the ball.\n\nHe did kick a penalty right after the interval to make it 21-12 but missed another shortly afterwards. Then the sky fell in.\n\nA loose kick by Paul Hull went straight to Catt who ran it straight back from his own half before feeding Callard. He made the breach and Guscott appeared on his shoulder to coast in for his hat-trick.\n\nFour minutes later Bristol won a line-out on their 22 only to be robbed in the subsequent maul. Steve Ojomoh burst from the huddle and nobody was going to stop the big blindside from that distance.\n\nBen Clarke thought he had scored on the hour but it was ruled out for a forward pass. His reward eventually came as Bath rattled up 19 points in just four minutes, scoring twice from restarts.\n\nThe No 8 first appeared outside Adebayo to score in the corner, while the next score went to Catt, sprinting clear after launching a move which featured de Glanville, Andy Robinson and the remarkable Graham Dawe.\n\nBath’s last try went to Simon Geoghegan, Callard’s conversion bringing up the half-century. Hurt pride stung Bristol into working lock Garath Archer for a try but it was an empty gesture.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – four stars\n\nBATH FORM: turbo-charged\n\nBRISTOL FORM: pedestrian\n\nSCORERS: 2 mins – Tainton pen, nil-3; 8 mins – Guscott try, 5-3; 12 mins – Callard pen, 8-3; 16 mins – Tainton pen, 8-6; 22 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 15-6; 26 mins – Callard pen, 18-6; 31 mins – Tainton pen, 18-9; 38 mins – Callard pen, 21-9 (H-T); 42 mins – Tainton pen, 21-12; 46 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 28-12; 50 mins – Ojomoh try, 33-12; 68 mins – Clarke try, 38-12; 70 mins – Catt try, Callard conv, 45-12; 72 mins – Geoghegan try, Callard conv, 52-12; 76 mins – Archer try, Tainton conv, 52-19.\n\nBATH: Callard; Geoghegan, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt, Sanders; Hilton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nBRISTOL: Hull; Maggs, Keyter, Wring, Denney; Tainton, Bracken; Sharp, Regan, Hinkins, Shaw, Archer, Armstrong, Corry, Barrow.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Campsall (Yorkshire Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – warm, sunny; pitch – well grassed.\n\nBRISTOL’S 11th successive defeat against Bath since the Courage Leagues began eight years was a real record-breaker.\n\nIt was Bath’s biggest win over their neighbours, both in terms of points scored and the margin of victory, eclipsing the 31-8 scoreline at the Memorial Ground three years ago.\n\nBut it was also the first time that Bristol have conceded 50 points in a league match. Their worst performance previously was the 47-11 defeat at West Hartlepool last season.\n\nBath, on the other hand, are averaging 32 points a game in the league this season having scored 23 tries in the six games and conceded just four.\n\nBristol coach Adrian Gouldstone said simply: “I told our lads afterwards that they just had to take it on the chin. There’s no substitute for class.”\n\nAnd skipper Paul Hull added: “It wasn’t that we played that badly, just that they played particularly well.\n\n“The individual tackling was very good but as a team we didn’t put enough pressure on them and they just ran the show.\n\n“You can’t afford to give them that much space because they have such pacey backs.\n\n“I don’t think you’ll see a better performance than that from a Bath team.\n\n“Andy Robinson was just all over the place. He linked and tackled and was in our faces all afternoon. And any time there was a breakdown he was there to recycle the ball.\n\n“On song, they’re very, very good. We just caught them on the wrong day. Hopefully it won’t be that bad when we get them at home.”\n\nLock Simon Shaw admitted: “We knew we had to be on our toes but we weren’t really awake.\n\n“I don’t know what happened mentally as far as we were concerned. We didn’t seem clued in and, apart from the penalties, we never looked like scoring for most of the game.\n\n“It was very hard to get the guys together after they had scored a couple of tries. People started to dip their heads a bit early, even in the first half.\n\n“I really can’t say what happened. It was all happening too fast and we didn’t know how to cope with it.”\n\nBath skipper Phil de Glanville: “It was really good, a fantastic game and I enjoyed it immensely. That’s what it’s all about, when there’s a real buzz in the crowd and amongst the squad.\n\n“We counteracted them very well. The possession we won today, the quality of it, was fantastic. When you win that sort of ball going forward, it shows how dangerous we can be with the backs we’ve got, and the back row.\n\n“Last week everyone was slagging us off for being really boring. It’s just the way things go sometimes. Today it all went for us.”\n\n21/10/1995\n\nv Harlequins, Away. Won 19-13. Team:- Callard (1c & 4p), Lumsden (T), de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo, Catt, Sanders, Hilton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Peters, Clarke. Replacements – Johnson (rep. Catt 75 mins), French, Crompton Ref – C White. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Perfect\n\nSo here we are having won all our games so far this season, including away to our three greatest rivals – Leicester, Wasps and now Quins. This was billed as the ‘Catt/Pears’ show, and Catt came out on top. Unfortunately they were both injured near the end of the game. Bath were superior to a tenacious Quins team, and really should have piled on the points in the second half. But somehow we went off the boil. Robinson again the class act, together with Guscott, who is looking really good again.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH’S `triple whammy’ of away wins over their closest challengers has all but killed off the Courage League title race – and autumn is hardly with us yet.\n\nWith seven straight wins under their belts, including victories at Leicester, Wasps and now Quins, what’s the betting now on an unbeaten league campaign?\n\nThere is certainly no air of complacency in the Bath camp. In fact the level of self-criticism borders on the masochistic.\n\nCoach Brian Ashton is very much the forgotten man of the Bath set-up these days.\n\nPrevented by school duties from attending games, he has to spend hours poring over match videos. It’s a frustrating role in which his main contact with the players is at midweek training.\n\nBut it allows him to offer a more critical analysis of the team’s progress – and he doesn’t mince his words.\n\n“I was left with a sense of half-frustration, half-disappointment,” said Ashton. “I’m delighted that we got two points away from home again but it could have been so much more.\n\n“My honest feeling is that we actually let them back into the game but, at the end of the day, they weren’t good enough to win it.\n\n“We do set ourselves very high standards and it’s disappointing, especially after last week’s performance against Bristol, to feel that we couldn’t actually repeat it on a similar sort of day 100 miles East.\n\n“But we’re going to have to do that, have the patience and the will to play the same sort of game – for 80 minutes, not 20 – away from home as we do at home.”\n\nThat’s a tall order, particularly as Bath’s form at the Rec has been of the highest quality, averaging 48 points a game.\n\nAnd in questioning his side’s approach away from home, Ashton does discount the attitude of the opposition. Many sides, in working out where they are going to pick up league points, automatically write off their chances at Bath.\n\nAt home though, they are a different proposition, driven by personal pride and their own supporters’ expectations to make that extra effort. Quins are a good example.\n\nBath began in such breathtaking fashion that they threatened to blow the Londoners away, but Will Carling and his colleagues stood firm and looked equally threatening at times.\n\nDavid Pears and Jon Callard swapped penalties and Quins came close to scoring when Carling swooped on a high ball spilled by Ben Clarke. Halted on the line, Quins’ over eagerness cost them a penalty.\n\nThe instant response was Bath at their boldest. A quick tap released Adedayo Adebayo inside the 22 and the move only foundered 70 metres on, deep in Quins territory.\n\nConsidering the way Bath were tossing the ball in all directions, looking for that all-important opening, it was a surprise that their 27th minute try came from first-phase possession.\n\nA deft flick by Martin Haag at the front of the line and Ian Sanders’ instant delivery allowed Mike Catt to send Jeremy Guscott on an angled run past Pears. Skipper Phil de Glanville was in support to send Audley Lumsden over for the touchdown.\n\nJon Callard converted but Quins replied within four minutes through wing Daren O’Leary after Carling, the impressive Peter Mensah and Jim Staples had made the opening.\n\nFrom that point, Bath seemed to be guilty of trying too hard.\n\nTechnical errors crept into their game and after half-time, instead of keeping the ball in hand, they began to kick for touch – and not too accurately either.\n\nFortunately, players like Nigel Redman are adaptable enough to cope and he did his work in the tight and also pulled off a couple of crucial tackles.\n\nCallard kicked three second-half goals to secure victory and although Pears replied with a dropped goal, a succession of injuries diluted Quins’ efforts at a comeback.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: uneven\n\nSCORERS: 8 mins – Pears pen, 3-nil; 12 mins – Callard pen, 3-3; 27 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 3-10; 31 mins – O’Leary try, Pears conv, 10-10 (H-T); 44 mins – Callard pen, 10-13; 51 mins – Callard pen, 10-16; 67 mins – Callard pen, 10-19; 69 mins – Pears dropped goal, 13-19.\n\nHARLEQUINS: Staples (rep Wright, H-T); O’Leary, Carling, Mensah, Bromley; Pears (rep Moore, 76 mins), Kitchin; Brown, Mitchell, Mullins, Snow, Thresher (rep Pickup, 62 mins), Russell, Watson, Allison.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt (rep Johnson, 76 mins), Sanders; Hilton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Peters, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nREFEREE: Chris Wright (Gloucestershire Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – good.\n\n28/10/1995\n\nv Saracens, Home.

Bath awarded a penalty try Replacements – Johnson, McCarthy, Hilton Ref – S Lander. Ground – Perfect. Weather – Gorgeous\n\nThis started off looking as though it might be a rout, as per the Bristol game, However, a combination of some iffy refereeing plus determined resistance by Sarries meant Bath periodically went off the boil. When they zinged, they really showed again the 15-man game they are trying to maintain this year. Robinson and de Glanville again outstanding in a truly team effort. Guscott got his 100th try for the Club in this game.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH have run in 32 tries in their eight league games – five more than defending champions Leicester scored in the whole of last season’s 18-match First Division campaign.\n\nIt’s a stark reminder of just how potent the current Bath team has become – possibly developing into the most exciting of all their great sides over the last 15 years.\n\nAsk Saracens, who shaded the league leaders for possession and spent two thirds of the game in the Bath half.\n\nMuch good it did them. They conceded eight tries and became the third side in a row to come away from the Rec on the wrong end of a 50 point thrashing.\n\nBath are not so much in a different class to everybody else in the league – that’s pretty obvious – it’s that they are playing a totally different game.\n\nIt’s as if they have discovered a new dimension to the sport. It certainly has more in common with Southern Hemisphere rugby than the stodgy old fare British fans are used to.\n\nIn firepower terms it’s like comparing a flint-lock pistol with a modern semi-automatic. And it’s proving a hit with spectators who are flocking to the Rec in greater numbers than ever before.\n\nFormer Bath hooker Rob Cunningham is now coaching Saracens’ forwards and was as impressed as anybody.\n\n“They’re doing things that nobody else is even trying at the moment,” said the ex-Bristol supremo.\n\n“They have changed the emphasis of their game entirely. It’s not as if we did much wrong from our point of view – our forwards went particularly well and we had our chances – but once they’ve got the ball, look out!”\n\nThings started to go wrong for the Londoners from the kick-off as Bath ran a free-kick and two penalties in quick succession. They eventually earned a penalty try on 50 seconds as Ben Clarke was tackled in an off-side position under the posts.\n\nThe next 20 minutes belonged to Saracens and their combative pack in which openside Richard Hill was outstanding throughout.\n\nAndy Lee kicked a penalty to pull them back to 7-3 but he missed with four more attempts before Bath burst back into life with a score by Irish wing Simon Geoghegan.\n\nJon Callard had run back a loose kick to set up the position but it was the under-rated Ian Sanders who made the telling break.\n\nSkipper Phil de Glanville added a third on 27 minutes, showing his pace with a flat run across the defence to reach the corner. Jon Callard landed his third conversion before Lee finally notched a second penalty.\n\nIf the bubbling Rec crowd thought that it was going to be plain sailing after the interval, they had a rude shock as the second half got under way.\n\nA swift Saracens thrust down the right pulled in the Bath defence and full-back Andy Tunningley slid a perfectly judged kick through to the left corner for Peter Harries to score.\n\nAt 21-11 Saracens were by no means out of things, but the loss of England A No 8 Anthony Diprose with a shoulder injury knocked them out of their stride.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes the rejuvenated Jeremy Guscott celebrated his 100th try for Bath and Callard’s thrust allowed Audley Lumsden to add another direct from the restart.\n\nCallard’s conversion – he kicked six in all to become the first Bath player to reach 500 league points – stretched the lead to 33-11.\n\nAlthough Sanders pounced on an untidy Saracens heel on their own line for a sixth try the Londoners continued to pursue their own pressure game.\n\nThe trouble is Bath only need a sniff of possession these days to make it tell.\n\nGeoghegan’s second try was a straightforward run-in, a neatly crafted effort by Sanders and Andy Robinson on the blindside of an attacking scrum.\n\nTunningley sped down the left touchline for a well-deserved score in the closing minutes but the last word was left to ambitious Bath as Sanders finished off a spectacular 70-metre move under the posts.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – four stars\n\nBATH FORM: magical SCORERS: 1 min – penalty try, Callard conv, 7-nil; 6 mins – Lee pen, 7-3; 22 mins – Geoghegan try, Callard conv, 14-3; 27 mins – de Glanville try, Callard conv, 21-3; 33 mins – Lee pen, 21-6 (H-T); 41 mins ¬- Harries try, 21-11; 53 mins – Guscott try, 26-11; 56 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 33-11; 62 mins – Sanders try, 38-11; 75 mins – Geoghegan try, Callard conv, 45-11; 76 mins – Tunningley try, 45-16; 80 mins – Sanders try, Callard conv, 52-16.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Geoghegan; Butland, Sanders; Yates, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Peters, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nSARACENS: Tunningley; Gregory, Buckton, Ravenscroft, Harries; Lee, Davies; Holmes, Olney, Wilson, Langley, Yandell, Green, Diprose (rep Zaltzman, 51 mins), Hill.\n\nREFEREE: Steve Lander (Liverpool).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – fine; pitch – perfect.\n\n4/11/1995\n\nv Sale, Away.

Replacements – Nicol, French, Yates Ref – C Rees. Ground – Good. Weather – Perfect\n\nThis was the game at which Callard celebrated the birth of his daughter Georgia the day before, by giving another superlative performance to mark his recall to the England line-up. A cracker of a game and Sale certainly gave us a run for our money. Paul Turner really is a magic man and was instrumental in Sale being well ahead with 5 minutes to go. However, Bath managed to play the Houdini-game again and ran out winners, to leave us at the top of the tree, unbeaten at the halfway point in the season.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nWITH Georgia on his mind, you couldn’t really blame Jon Callard for missing a sitter in the first ten minutes.\n\nCallard’s wife Gail had given birth to their first child, daughter Georgia, less than 24 hours before.\n\nSo the England full-back joined his teammates in Cheshire in an understandably emotional state after less than four hours sleep and a tiring drive up the M6.\n\n“When I lined up that kick I must admit my mind was elsewhere,” said the proud father. “It was a howler but I told myself I just had to get into the game.”\n\nAnd he eventually rounded off a wonderful week by scoring the first of two late tries that clinched a ninth successive Courage League win.\n\nFor good measure he landed all the conversions and a third penalty in injury time to finish with 20 points, taking his league tally for the season to 136.\n\n“It’s been a great week really,” said Callard, who last Wednesday was recalled by England for the clash with world champions South Africa on Saturday week.\n\n“But, from the rugby point of view, this is only the start. We’ve reached the half-way stage of the league unbeaten but we must really concentrate now to keep this league.\n\n“Now we’ve got to win all 18 games, not expect others to slip up.”\n\nIn fact, Bath came as close as they done all season to slipping up themselves, unsettled by Sale’s vigorous forward effort and the clever promptings of the old maestro, Paul Turner.\n\nRob Liley and Callard had exchanged penalties before the Cheshire club fashioned a slick try for full-back Jim Mallinder after Turner had committed the Bath defence under the posts.\n\nLiley extended the lead to ten points and, as half-time approached, it was obvious that the league leaders were out of sorts, struggling to breach the gain line and making uncharacteristic errors behind the scrum.\n\nBut a second penalty for Callard showed he was back in the groove while Liley’s eccentric technique was letting Sale down.\n\nFive minutes into the second half Bath’s backs finally clicked when Jeremy Guscott sent Phil de Glanville surging through a gap. The Bath skipper made 40 metres before threading a well-timed pass to Audley Lumsden for the try.\n\nCallard’s conversion from wide out on the right levelled the scores, but Sale were back in front almost immediately with a try that owed everything to Turner’s vision.\n\nA tapped free-kick caught Bath napping as the former Wales fly-half floated a long pass over Lumsden’s outstretched fingers and a jubilant Jos Baxendell claimed the score, which went unconverted.\n\nThat left Sale 18-13 ahead with half an hour to hold out but they suffered a severe blow in the 57th minute when their effective line-out forward Dave Baldwin had to be replaced.\n\nBut Bath continued to look frustrated. It certainly got to Ben Clarke, the England No 8 passing to Turner one minute and next having a penalty reversed for booting an opponent.\n\nLiley missed again, however, and the visitors took their cue in the closing minutes by launching a frantic series of attacks from a succession of tapped penalties.\n\nFinally, with Victor Ubogu leading the heavy infantry, they worked Callard over on the left to draw level. It was not an easy conversion but the full-back is Mr Reliable these days.\n\nMost sides would have been satisfied with a two-point lead at that stage but Guscott conjured another try for Lumsden with a typically elusive break and astute kick-ahead.\n\nCallard converted and also added a closing penalty to end a rush of 17 points in barely six minutes.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: resilient\n\nSCORERS: 5 mins – Liley pen, 3-nil; 13 mins – Callard pen, 3-3; 17 mins – Mallinder try, Liley conv, 10-3; 25 mins – Liley pen, 13-3; 33 mins – Callard pen, 13-6 (H-T); 45 mins – Lumsden try, Callard pen, 13-13; 49 mins – Baxendell try, 18-13; 75 mins – Callard try & conv, 18-20; 79 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 18-27; 82 mins – Callard pen, 18-30.\n\nSALE: Mallinder; Liley, Baxendell, Higginbotham, C Yates; Turner, Warr; A Yates (rep Ridehalgh, 78 mins), Diamond, Smith, Fowler, Baldwin (rep Erskine, 57 mins), Hewitt, Vyvyan, Ashurst.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Butland, Sanders; Hilton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nREFEREE: Chris Rees (London Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – good.\n\n11/11/1995\n\nv West Hartlepool, Home.

We won but not all that decisively and West played better than their bottom position would indicate. The half backs had a bit of a nightmare, but the front row were encouraging and I thought Pearce had a good game. Haag and Redman tireless as usual and Callard – surprise, surprise! – playing a supreme game at full back yet again. He passed 1,000 points for the Club in this match.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nIT’S impossible to see how money can buy any greater commitment from such a wholehearted player as Ben Clarke.\n\nThis is one of rugby’s brightest stars, a man who is destined to be one of its biggest earners when the sport goes fully professional.\n\nAnd if England are to beat world champions South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday they will need a big performance from the Bath No 8.\n\nYet here he was, leading from the front in the worst of conditions and risking the sort of silly knock that might have put him out of action for that crucial week or so.\n\nIn fact Clarke scored one of four tries against West Hartlepool and was only denied a pushover score by the referee’s decision to award a penalty try instead.\n\nHe said afterwards: “It’s always at the back of your mind before you play a game that there is a prospect of getting injured.\n\n“But I wouldn’t be an international if it wasn’t for Bath Rugby Club and the players here, so I don’t have any problem whatsoever about playing the week before playing South Africa.”\n\nHowever, Bath could afford to rest back row colleague Andy Robinson\n\nahead of his international comeback, together with tighthead Victor Ubogu.\n\nMike Catt was still missing too and Bath did not enjoy their customary superiority but there was never any likelihood that the visitors would pull off the shock of the season.\n\nBeing the last in a punishing sequence of ten league matches, there was a `half-term break’ air about the Rec. News of Leicester’s defeat at Saracens merely added to the party atmosphere.\n\nJeremy Guscott opened the scoring as early as the second minute, cutting back to the posts through a flatfooted defence.\n\nAt that point the script went slightly awry as Bath found themselves pinned down in the corner. West No 8 Paul Evans scrambled over but could not ground the ball and Scottish scrum-half Derrick Patterson fired an intended scoring pass direct into touch.\n\nSo it was not too much of a surprise when Patterson put tighthead Mike Shelley under the posts from a tapped penalty.\n\nStimpson’s conversion brought the sides level but Jon Callard’s flawless kicking yielded two penalties to take his tally for the club beyond 1,000 points.\n\nAs he prepares for his fifth England cap, the 29-year-old full-back has never been in better form.\n\nStimpson, one of the heirs apparent, pulled back three points as West’s fierce tackling unsettled the leaders who also struggled to hang on to the slippery ball.\n\nWhen Ian Sanders lost the ball at the back of a scrum after 32 minutes, Patterson booted it downfield to Callard.\n\nThe ball went loose and Bath looked to be in trouble – until left wing Jon Sleightholme picked up and hared away on a spectacular 60-metre run.\n\nHaving done all the hard work, he presented Audley Lumsden with his sixth league try in ten matches.\n\nTrailing 20-10 at the interval, hapless West might have struck back almost immediately afterwards but left wing Andrew Blyth spilled the ball when Stimpson’s penalty attempt hit the post.\n\nClarke’s try came from a concerted forward drive after Guscott carved through and the penalty try was awarded when Patterson dived in to stop the No 8 grounding the ball from a pushover scrum.\n\nAt 34-10, the game was in the bag and there was only mild irritation that wing Owen Evans and No 8 Paul Evans hit back with tries in the last ten minutes.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: cruising\n\nSCORERS: 2 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 7-nil; 11 mins – Shelley try, Stimpson conv, 7-7; 17 mins – Callard conv, 10-7; 22 mins – Callard pen, 13-7; 25 mins – Stimpson pen, 13-10; 33 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 20-10 (H-T); 48 mins – Clarke try, Callard conv, 27-10; 66 mins – penalty try, Callard conv, 34-10; 71 mins – Owen Evans try, 34-15; 77 mins – Paul Evans try, Stimpson conv, 34-22.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme; Butland, Sanders; Yates, Dawe, Crompton, Haag, Redman, Pearce, Clarke, Ojomoh.\n\nWEST HARTLEPOOL: Stimpson; O Evans, Hodder, Elwine, Blyth; Parker, Patterson; Beal, Herbert, Shelley (rep Sparks, 28 mins), Murphy, Westgarth, Mitchell, P Evans, Leach.\n\nREFEREE: Ashley Rowden (Berkshire Soc.).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – raining; pitch – wet, heavy.\n\n18/11/1995\n\nv Coventry, Home.

Weather – Cold but perfect\n\nThe first of the friendlies at this stage of the season saw a lively Coventry team (bolstered by their new Bristol arrivals) put up stiff resistance to this Bath team of ‘understudies’. After a pretty shaky start by Bath, they started to put it together and the educated boot of Butland, helped by an extremely lively back row and some good line-out work helped them to keep this year’s unbeaten season on The Rec.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH ran out worthy winners in front of a disappointingly small crowd at the Recreation Ground.\n\nCoventry made a promising start and after a penalty from full-back Craig Quick, some snappy handling led to a try for centre Garrath Reayer, one of the side’s new recruits from Bristol.\n\nThe Reayer try went unconverted by Quick soon made amends with his second penalty and Bath were 11-nil down after just 14 minutes.\n\nEventually spurred into action, impressive hooker Neil McCarthy bored his way over for a try. But Coventry, led impressively by Derek Eves, increased their lead after a storming run by Horrobin.\n\nQuick’s conversion, against two penalties from Bath fly-half Richard Butland, saw Coventry lead 18-11 at the break.\n\nWith the sun in their eyes, Coventry made a hash of Butland’s high kick early in the second period. From the resulting scrum, debutant centre Kenny Seager crossed for a try that Butland converted.\n\nButland’s third penalty inched Bath ahead for the first time before scrum-half Simon Johnson intercepted a pass on the half-way line to race away and score. Butland converted.\n\nRight on the final whistle, Horrobin secured his second try to complete an entertaining afternoon.\n\nBath: Sam Blackmore; Tony Iacano, Andy Webber, Kenny Seager, Peter Blackett; Richard Butland, Simon Johnson; T Woodman, Neil McCarthy, Darren Crompton, Nick Maslen, Pat McCoy, Bill Nicholas, Ed Pearce, Rob Amphlett.\n\nCoventry: C Quick; D Woodman, N Thomson, G Reayer, B Shepherd; J Hart, R Saverimutto; N Lewis, R Blundell, B Williams, T Gulliver, S Smith, M Curtis, J Horrobin, D Eves.\n\nReferee: Steve Kent (Liverpool Soc)\n\n25/11/1995\n\nv Loughborough Students, Home.

However, the students never gave up and gradually powered their way through to a good win. Some bright and entertaining rugby was played despite the appalling conditions.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nMATCH No 13 turned out to be the unlucky one as Bath’s impressive winning run this season ground to a halt.\n\nThis was Bath at their weakest, fielding a collection of willing second and third-teamers who have not had a sniff of Courage League action this season.\n\nBut they should have won, as skipper Nick Maslen acknowledged.\n\n“It was the old story for us of being in control and then giving it away,” said the back row stalwart.\n\nAt 17-14 ahead as late as the 72nd minute, they looked to have done enough to have maintained the 100 per cent record.\n\nBut fly-half Clive Book, standing on his own goal-line, dropped a low pass from replacement scrum-half Nick Lloyd and Loughborough earned a five-metre scrum.\n\nBath’s defence repulsed the first thrust but the ball was quickly switched to the short side where left wing Nick Miller wriggled under a tackle for the clinching try.\n\nThe loss of scrum-half Simon Johnson six minutes earlier had been a turning point but the home side had only themselves to blame for squandering a ten-point lead.\n\nLoughborough had opened the scoring in the seventh minute, very much against the run of play, when fly-half Nick Osman scored an opportunist try, chasing his own kick ahead.\n\nAtkinson converted but, as the rain bucketed down, Book kicked a penalty on 20 minutes and also added the conversion when lock Pat McCoy was driven over for a try.\n\nAlthough the conditions made life easier for defenders than attackers, Bath went ten points up when tighthead Mark Curtis rumbled over from a line-out.\n\nBut Loughborough battled back into the game, creating a try for prop Alex Poole from a tapped penalty which Atkinson converted.\n\nScorers: 7 mins – Osman try, Atkinson conv, nil-7; 20 mins – Book pen, 3-7; 31 mins – McCoy try, Book conv, 10-7; 45 mins – Curtis try, Book conv, 17-7; 53 mins – Poole try, Atkinson conv, 17-14; 73 mins – Miller try, 17-19.\n\nBath: Blackmore; Iacano, Webber, Seager, Blackett; Book, Johnson; Hussey, French, Curtis, Colver, McCoy, Maslen, Amphlett, Nicholas.\n\nLoughborough: Jones; Storey, Propper, Atkinson, Miller; Osman, Daniels; Poole, Nunn, Kelly, Cox, White, Friend, Powell, Davis.\n\nReferee: Ian Langley (Kent Soc).\n\n2/12/1995\n\nv Nottingham, Home.

Bath awarded a penalty try Replacements – Johnson, French replaced Dawe, Hussey Ref – Alec McKay. Ground – Sticky. Weather – Overcast\n\nWhat an antidote to the weather and Christmas shopping! A near first team put on a dazzling display of handling and running by all 15 which all but blew Nottingham away, who never gave up despite being outgunned on all fronts. Invidious to pick out anyone really, but Robinson and de Glanville were again outstanding. This was a pipe-opener for the Cup game on 23rd. Long may it last!\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nJON Sleightholme warmed up for his England A date with the Western Samoans tomorrow week with a hat-trick as Bath ran up a club record score.\n\nAstonishingly, when Jon Callard converted the right wing’s third try, Bath led 87-12 – and still had 20 minutes to bring up the century!\n\nThat already eclipsed the previous record of 84-nil against Streatham-Croydon on January 23, 1988 (worth 100-nil in these days of the five-point try).\n\nBut as the attackers’ legs tired and Nottingham defenders battled desperately to avoid further humiliation, the `ton’ eluded Bath.\n\nThat was a disappointment for the Recreation Ground crowd frantically urging them on, but perhaps a relief to operators of the digital scoreboard which cannot cope with three figures.\n\n“I was sure we were going to score 120 or more,” said Sleightholme. “It was no-holds barred stuff out of the 22 and even behind our own line and I think we kicked only twice in the whole game.\n\n“It’s refreshing to play a game like that because the pressure’s off. To be fair to Nottingham, they didn’t just lie down and die and scored a couple of good tries themselves.”\n\nThe England squad winger is a far more physical player than he was at this time last year.\n\n“That aggression is coming out in a controlled way because I’m fighting for my place. It’s something Bath look for in their players and it’s what the club’s success is founded on.\n\n“Training’s very competitive here and if you don’t compete, then you sink. You’ve got to take the knocks in training with the boys and you earn respect for doing that.”\n\nOne thing is for certain, though. He won’t be able to run through the Samoans at Gateshead as he did against a Nottingham side fielding just half a dozen first-teamers.\n\nSleightholme’s first try came after just 30 seconds. Nigel Redman collected the kick-off two-handed, Phil de Glanville burst through the middle, Andy Robinson provided the link and Tony Iacano came across from the left wing to put Sleightholme away.\n\nHis second started with a tapped penalty on half-way although he had to beat his opposite number with an impressive burst of speed on the touchline.\n\nIacano added a third try on the left, with Callard’s conversion taking the score to 19-nil after just 14 minutes.\n\nAn interception score by Nottingham right wing Tim Barley was answered immediately by Bath skipper de Glanville and followed in quick succession by tries from Andy Robinson and Iacano again.\n\nNottingham’s second try, by flanker John Brennan from an attacking scrum, offered little respite and Bath turned round 54-12 ahead at half-time after Ed Pearce and Callard crossed for the seventh and eighth tries.\n\nHalf-backs Ian Sanders and Richard Butland continued the rout immediately afterwards as Nottingham were torn to pieces by a bewildering and effective display of attacking rugby.\n\nThe forwards, apart from providing the possession, were playing a full part too. Hooker Graham Dawe and No 8 Steve Ojomoh were next on the scoresheet before Sleightholme completed his hat-trick on 60 minutes.\n\nLoosehead Kevin Yates plunged over for the next try to take the score into the 90s but fatigue then began to set in and there was only one more try in the remaining 15 minutes.\n\nThat went to Callard, taking his match tally to a Bath club record of 34 points. Agonisingly, the touchline conversion kick that would have brought up the century hit the far post.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: extravagant\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Sleightholme try, 5-nil; Sleightholme try, Callard conv, 12-nil; 14 mins – Iacano try, Callard conv, 19-nil; 18 mins – Barley try, Rutter conv, 19-7; 22 mins – de Glanville try, Callard conv, 26-7; 27 mins – Robinson try, Callard conv, 33-7; 29 mins – Iacano try, Callard conv, 40-7; 32 mins – Brennan try, 40-12; 34 mins – Pearce try, Callard conv, 47-12; 37 mins – Callard try & conv, 54-12 (H-T); 42 mins – Sanders try, 59-12; 44 mins – Butland try, Callard conv, 66-12; 48 mins – Dawe try, 73-12; 54 mins – Ojomoh try, Callard conv, 80-12; 60 mins – Sleightholme try, Callard conv, 87-12; 65 mins – Yates try, Callard conv, 94-12; 74 mins – Callard try, 99-12.\n\nBATH: Callard; Sleightholme, de Glanville, Perry, Iacano; Butland, Sanders; Yates, Dawe (rep French, 73 mins), Clark, Haag, Redman, Pearce, Ojomoh, Robinson.\n\nNOTTINGHAM: Byrom; Barley, Mustoe, Bygrave, Holland; Rutter, Royer; Freer, Ireland (rep Grantham, 63 mins), Kangura, Jones, Veldhuizen, Bradley, Donald, Brennan.\n\nREFEREE: Alex McKay (Cornwall Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – gloomy, drizzle; pitch – soft.\n\n9/12/1995\n\nv London Scottish, Away.

Replacements – Lloyd replaced Butland. Ref – J Burtenshaw. Ground – Sticky. Weather – Cold but fine\n\nA near Spartans team won this all action game. Lots of running by both sides and a refreshing determination by both sides to play an open and entertaining game, despite the cold. Butland left the field in the second half with what looked like a nasty ankle injury. Up until then he had shown his class with some great breaks and intelligent line kicking. Regrouping led to some indecision by Bath and the Scots scored two late tries. Perry played another very impressive game and looks good for the future. Vander had a good debut and Gillies jumped well.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nFLANKER Adam Vander made an impressive senior debut as Bath’s youngsters ran the Scots ragged at Richmond Athletic Ground.\n\nThe former Bath University student cut a dashing figure, both in attack and defence, displaying that rare knack of being in the right place at the right time.\n\n“He was absolutely everywhere, quite outstanding,” said assistant coach John Palmer. “he’s the best prospect I’ve seen for a long time.”\n\nVander left University last summer year but is now back in Bath after a spell with Rosslyn Park.\n\nHe was given his first team chance after making a good impression in the victory by a Bath Development XV against a New Zealand junior side recently.\n\nWith such an inexperienced line-up for an away fixture, Bath relied heavily on the experience of Nick Maslen and Colin Atkins in the pack.\n\nBut it was fly-half Richard Butland, well served by Simon Johnson, who was the inspiration behind the scrum.\n\nApart from keeping Bath ahead in the opening half hour with three penalties, he repeatedly carved through the Exiles’ defence only to see his efforts wasted through poor finishing.\n\nBut hooker Atkins burrowed over from a tapped penalty and Butland’s conversion ensured they turned round 16-5 ahead.\n\nA mistake by Scottish running out of defence was punished by a try in the corner for Johnson and prop Mark Curtis was driven over from a line-out shortly afterwards.\n\nAlthough home centre Fraser Harrold replied on the hour and Stent’s conversion made it 28-10, 18-year-old centre Matt Perry made the game safe by dummying his way over.\n\nButland had left the field with a leg injury and Scottish capitalised on the disorganisation in the Bath ranks by snatching two consolation tries in the final minutes.\n\nSCORERS: 4 mins – Butland pen, nil-3; 7 mins – Johnston try, 5-3; 29 mins – Butland pen, 5-6; 34 mins – Butland pen, 5-9; 36 mins – Atkins try, Butland conv, 5-16 (H-T); 52 mins – Johnson try, 5-21; 56 mins – Curtis try, Butland conv, 5-28; 59 mins – Harrold try, Stent conv, 12-28; 75 mins – Perry try, 12-33; 78 mins – Gordon try, Stent conv, 19-33; 82 mins – Harrold try, 24-33.\n\nLONDON SCOTTISH: Wichary; Gordon, Harrold, Kearney, Sly; Stent, Withers-Green; Signorini, McGavin, Baird, Johnston, Orr Ewing, Duthie, Jankovitch, Macleod (rep Buchanan-Smith, 79 mins).\n\nBATH: Seager; Iacano, Webber, Perry, Blackmore; Butland (rep Lloyd, 69 mins), Johnson; Hussey, Atkins, Curtis, Calver, Gillies, Maslen, Amphlett, Vander.\n\nREFEREE: John Burtenshaw (London).\n\n15/12/1995\n\nv Exeter, Home.

With the team we put out, there should have been more points on the board and on the whole the new boys looked sharper and keener than the old hands. First sight of Walters in the first team who looked as though he could be useful and Seager is growing comfortably into the full back spot. Perry, at fly half, continues to impress. Another of the all-running extravaganzas currently being played by the first team – quite fun but they sometimes take it too far.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTHE “no kicking” edict issued by new Director of Rugby John Hall certainly warmed up the action on a bitterly cold night.\n\nBut the four tries they conceded in the second half suggested that some players thought there was a ban on tackling too.\n\nThat certainly did not apply to the Devon side who defended with extraordinary enthusiasm, displaying a cussedness that will have to be repeated next weekend when Leicester visit for a Pilkington Cup fourth round tie.\n\nBath fielded five first team regulars – wings Audley Lumsden and Adedayo Adebayo, flanker Steve Ojomoh, prop Kevin Yates and lock Martin Haag, made captain for the night.\n\nOut in the backs they had Bristol University student Fraser Waters making his first team debut.\n\nWith disarming honesty, the 19-year-old second year economics student said: “I thought I had a shocker.\n\n“I had some difficulty fitting into the side, especially one playing such adventurous rugby. But I enjoy the atmosphere at Bath,” added Waters who joins the Bath training camp in Portugal next week.\n\nThe cup holders are hoping he will join them permanently when he is ready for the rigours of club rugby. His talent has already been recognised at divisional level and he was on the England A bench against the Western Samoans last Tuesday.\n\nAnother A replacement, Darren Crompton, got Bath off to a good start with a try in the first minute and further scores by Adedayo Adebayo and Andy Nicol earned a 17-3 half-time lead.\n\nIt was 24-3 after Audley Lumsden raced through shortly after the break but Exeter’s determination not to be overwhelmed caught Bath by surprise.\n\nKenny Seager and Lumsden crossed again but two-try lock Harry Langley had the last word with a try in the final minute to bring Exeter within a score.\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Darren Crompton try, 5-nil; 7 mins – Andy Green pen, 5-3; 27 mins – Adedayo Adebayo try, Kenny Seager conv, 12-3; 35 mins – Andy Nicol try, 17-3 (H-T); 43 mins – Audley Lumsden try, Seager conv, 24-3; 48 mins – John Batchelor try, Green conv, 24-10; 59 mins – Seager try & conv, 31-10; 62 mins – Langley try, Green conv, 31-17; 66 mins – Green try & conv, 31-24; 71 mins – Lumsden conv, 36-24; 80 mins – Langley try, 36-29.\n\nBATH: Seager; Lumsden, Waters, Webber, Adebayo; Perry, Nicol (rep Johnson, 80 mins); Yates, McCarthy, Crompton, Haag, Gillies, Vander, Pearce, Ojomoh.\n\nEXETER: Catling; Woodman, Thomas, Turner (rep Stewart, 69 mins), Doyle; Green, John; Reed, Cooper, Brooking, Langley, Curry, Batchelor, Baxter, Hutchinson.\n\nREFEREE: Peter Huckle (Bristol Soc)\n\n23/12/1995\n\nv Northampton, Home.

Replacements – Nicol, McCarthy, Yates, Butland Ref – Ed Morrison. Ground – Quagmire. Weather – Cold Monsoon\n\nAfter days of continuous rain and with the thermometer plummeting, it was feared that this mouth-watering cup-tie might turn into a non-event. Not a bit of it. This was a cracker! Played at a blinding pace and with great skill considering the conditions, both teams put on a magnificant display, and only Bath’s superior organisation in the pack let to the win. All eight, particularly Clarke, were outstanding. On to the next round!\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nIT WAS a day on which a collective judgement and individual assessment would have been as hazardous as the underfoot conditions at the Recreation Ground, but these two sides contrived to produce a game as good as any contest there has been all season.\n\nIf the better side won, and that is by no means certain, it was largely because most of the crucial decisions went Bath’s way.\n\nFurthermore, had Northampton kicked the early goals which were offered to them rather than dementedly running everything, the result might have been different.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the Saints kept in touch from the first to almost the very last was mainly because of a wondrously robust and superbly well organised defence, which time and again repulsed Bath when they seemed certain to score.\n\nTwice in the first half Northampton’s line survived in the face of overwhelming odds. Once when Ben Clarke lost control of the ball in a tackle in the very act of scoring and again when Budge Pountney’s telescopic arm scooped the ball from Simon Geoghegan’s grasp after the winger had cut inside and seemingly had a clear run to the line.\n\nOn other occasions, however, it was Bath’s own poor decision-making that let them down. In the second half, when Clarke galloped clear with only Michael Dods to beat and flanked on either side by a supporting cast, the No 8 chose to kick when a pass would surely have produced a try.\n\nYet there could be no doubt that Bath held sway in the key areas, notably the maul, which in the greasy conditions was a most potent weapon. Time and again they made dramatic territorial gains, rolling the opposition upfield and forcing them to concede penalties. Another important area of possession came, more surprisingly, from the line-out where those wily campaigners Martin Haag and Nigel Redman took some vital ball. Bath also profited from the fact that Graham Dawe’s throwing in was a great deal more accurate than his opposite number’s.\n\nBut it was impossible not to feel enormous sympathy for Northampton, the side who have been setting all manner of scoring records and in their combined play yesterday showed precisely why. The quality of their passing and running in the conditions surpassed all expectations.\n\nYet it was their defence which sustained them. Gregor Townsend and Matt Allen, who have been cutting a swathe through the Second Division, did occasionally, if understandably, hang on to the ball a mite too long but as the game wore on they found a few gaps. They also contributed magnificently in the defensive chores as did the young half-backs, Paul Grayson and Matt Dawson. Both worked tirelessly in support of their back row.\n\nHow often though, have Bath shown themselves capable of absorbing intense pressure before delivering the decisive blows? With Northampton, trailing by just three points and with eight minutes left, beginning to find some enticing space, Bath had sufficient reserves of stamina to drive their opponents back. Twice Northampton infringed, although Ed Morrison’s ruling on one occasion seemed harsh, and both times Jon Callard kicked the goals to give Bath the breathing space they had been seeking from the very first minute when Callard kicked the first of his four penalties.\n\nAt that stage is had seemed that Bath’s speed behind the scrum, combined with the powerful driving of their forwards, might swamp Northampton. Again and again they swept down on the Saints’ line but were miraculously kept out. Gradually the confidence returned to Northampton and Grayson equalised with a penalty.\n\nCallard’s second penalty four minutes before half-time was a fair enough reflection of the play and the question was whether or not Northampton’s defence could withstand another 40 minutes of the same.\n\nIt did, and the result was one of the most enjoyable games of the season so far. With it came a warning to all that although Northampton will have no further interest in the cup they will add lustre at the higher level in all competitions next season.\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Callard pen, 3-nil; 15 mins – Grayson pen, 3-3; 36 mins – Callard pen, 6-3 (H-T); 72 mins – Callard pen, 9-3; 78 mins – Callard pen, 12-3.\n\nBATH; Callard; Geoghegan, de Glanville, Guscott, Sleightholme; Catt, Sanders; Hilton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Ojomoh.\n\nNORTHAMPTON: Dods; Thorneycroft, Townsend, M Allen, Moir; Grayson, Dawson; Volland, Beddow, Hynes, Phillips, Bayfield, Rodber, Seely, Pountney.\n\nREFEREE: Ed Morrison (Bristol Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – incessant rain; pitch – very heavy\n\n6/1/1996\n\nv Leicester, Home.

After starting off at a blinding pace, Adebayo scoring a try in the first minute after some really good handling considering the weather, Leicester began to grind the game down to a near halt with some good work by Richards. Johnson, after narrowly avoiding being sent off in the first half, completely dominated the second half and Leicester won by playing the right, more boring, game for the day. Depressing, though.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH skipper Phil de Glanville will be keeping an anxious eye on the skies over the coming months.\n\nAfter making hay in the autumn when the sun seemed to shine every time they took the field, the British weather threatens to make it a nervous run-in for the leaders.\n\nDefending champions Leicester, now only two points behind, exposed the uncomfortable truth that Bath look far from invincible in the wet.\n\nThe qualities that make them virtually unbeatable on a dry day – pace, athleticism and boundless ambition – are worth little when the rain is driving into your face and the pitch is a quagmire.\n\nThose are the sort of conditions in which Leicester are happiest, when the ball is never more than arm’s length from Dean Richards’s vice-like grasp.\n\nBut there was no pun intended when de Glanville said: “We played into their hands. People like Richards are hugely skilful at stealing ball.\n\n“We needed a killer blow and it didn’t come. It’s a big setback but not a disaster – it depends how we react. The test of the side is how we bounce back,” added the 14 times-capped centre.\n\n“It’s still down to us. If we win all seven remaining games, we’ll win the league.”\n\nFor ten minutes, it looked as if Bath were going to skin the Tigers in the way every other visiting side had been humiliated this season.\n\nMartin Haag collected the kick-off, rucks were set up by Ben Clarke and Victor Ubogu and then de Glanville and Jeremy Guscott suddenly released Adedayo Adebayo on the left.\n\nThe wing outpaced the cover before stepping outside weak tackles by John Liley and Aadel Kardooni to finish off a stunning 60-metre move with just 34 seconds on the clock.\n\nJon Callard missed the conversion but Bath surged back into attack and Ben Clarke perhaps denied Adebayo a second try by holding on to the ball a moment too long.\n\nThey had to be content with a Callard penalty but that was 8-nil after five minutes and even Leicester supremo Tony Russ called it “fantastic rugby.”\n\nThen the squall blew in and Bath began to get drawn into the sort of dogfight which used to be meat and drink to them. In those days however, they had Stuart Barnes, Richard Hill, Gareth Chilcott and John Hall running the show.\n\nBarnes, now sitting in the TV commentary box, must have winced as Mike Catt struggled to find length or direction with his kicking.\n\nBut the forwards were also found wanting as the Leicester front five mounted a fierce onslaught. England lock Martin Johnson was warned twice in the first seven minutes and came close to being sent off.\n\nHe escaped but prop Darren Garforth received a yellow card in the 23rd minute for punching as the packs continued to war. Crucially, though, it was Bath who began to surrender control up front, even failing to control scrummage ball.\n\nMeanwhile Liley, the coolest man on the field, was picking Bath off from varying distances with a faultless display of placekicking.\n\nA third penalty edged his side in front on the half-hour and he added another within five minutes although Callard immediately pulled back three points so that Bath turned round 11-12 down.\n\nCallard missed a longer effort just after the restart but Liley’s fifth kick on 58 minutes turned out to be the clincher, even though his opposite number landed a 28-metre effort soon afterwards.\n\nThe last quarter belonged to Leicester and their pack in which flanker John Wells was outstanding. Richards was claiming a try in the closing minutes only to be denied by a forward pass.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: rudderless\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Adebayo try, 5-nil; 5 mins – Callard pen, 8-nil; 10 mins – Liley pen, 8-3; 14 mins – Liley pen, 8-6; 30 mins – Liley pen, 8-9; 35 mins – Liley pen, 8-12; 36 mins – Callard pen, 11-12 (H-T); 58 mins – Liley pen, 11-15; 61 mins – Callard pen, 14-15.\n\nBATH: Callard; Sleightholme, de Glanville, Guscott, Adebayo; Catt, Sanders; Crompton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Robinson.\n\nLEICESTER: Liley; Kilford, Robinson, Delaney, R Underwood; Harris, Kardooni; Rowntree, Cockerill, Garforth, Johnson, Poole, Wells, Richards, Back.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Campsall (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – blustery, then driving rain; pitch – sticky.\n\n13/1/1996\n\nv Northampton, Away.

Replacements – Johnson replaced Adebayo (50 mins), Maslen, Hussey\n\nI could not go to this game as I was recovering from flu, so these opinions are those of the Evening Chronicle. Bath apparently had a lacklustre first half, but led by an inspired Haag in the second, came back fighting. Waters outstanding with Lumsden and Butland in strong support.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH coach Brian Ashton told Bath supporters to blame him for a performance in which the result was quite blatantly sacrificed for a longer term aim.\n\nIt’s one thing spurning the boot and putting 99 points on Nottingham at the Rec, as Bath did in December.\n\nPersisting with the “no kicking” rule against a strong and confident Northampton side on their own patch is another matter entirely.\n\nBut Ashton was unrepentant, despite the failure to repeat the pre-Christmas Pilkington Cup victory over the Saints.\n\nHe is determined to find out how many of the younger players are capable of playing the high-octane rugby which Bath have made their trademark this season.\n\nThey simply cannot afford to get it wrong. If Bath are going to be laying out millions of pounds on player salaries from next season, they need to know that they are buying the right material.\n\n“We did say in training that we would try to play the game without kicking and that puts an immense pressure on players,” admitted Ashton.\n\n“But in some ways – this might seem strange coming from a Bath coach – it’s more important for me that I learn which players look as though they can handle the type of game we want to take into the future, as opposed to actually winning.\n\n“If they can’t, then I’m afraid they’ve either got to improve fairly smartly or…” he did not need to spell out the alternative.\n\n“We know exactly how we want to play the game in the next five years and we now need to look at some of these younger players and say: `Are you going to be able to cope with it?’\n\n“So I’m forcing ambition on them at the moment. If you want to blame anyone for this defeat, blame me, because we could have kicked umpteen penalties at goal and probably won the game.\n\n“I’m quite happy to take the blame from that point of view but I’m much more interested in the future of these younger players and the way Bath want to take the game forward.”\n\nFly-half Richard Butland is already pencilled in as one of the chosen few, having been awarded this week the first of the new sponsored scholarships at Bath University.\n\nHe again displayed the ambition and poise that Ashton is looking for – the coach even referred to his “Barry John-like” style of running.\n\nBut the technical errors that bedevilled the Bath performance also affected Butland. An ill-judged pass to flanker Ed Pearce under the Northampton posts led to a breakaway try for Nick Beal, although Butland, haring back, appeared to win the race to the touchdown.\n\nAdded to two earlier penalties by fly-half Alastair Hepher, that score put Saints 11-nil up at half-time.\n\nAndy Nicol, who forged an effective half-back partnership with Butland, grabbed an opportunist try at a scrum on the line on 56 minutes with the fly-half adding the conversion.\n\nBut Hepher quickly added his third penalty and wing Craig Moir then romped 60 metres to score under the posts after Bath again lost possession in attack.\n\nIn a furious flourish, Pearce and the strong-running Fraser Waters\n\nfashioned an impressive injury-time score for right wing Tony Iacano.\n\nBATH FORM: experimental\n\nSCORERS: 5 mins – Hepher pen, 3-nil; 18 mins – Hepher pen, 6-nil; 34 mins – Beal try, 11-nil (H-T); 56 mins – Nicol try, Butland conv, 11-7; 61 mins – Hepher pen, 14-7; 67 mins – Moir try, Hepher conv, 21-7; 83 mins – Iacano try, 21-12.\n\nNORTHAMPTON: Beal; Moir, Allen, Beale (rep Thorneycroft, 30 mins), Morgan; Hepher, Taylor; Volland (rep Beddow, 26 mins), Johnson, Hynes, Phillips, Etheridge, Cassell, Barnes (rep Milhouse, 68 mins), Pountney.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Iacano, Webber, Waters, Adebayo (rep Johnson, 50 mins); Butland, Nicol; Yates, French, Crompton, Haag, Gillies, Vander, Amphlett, Pearce.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Harris (Liverpool Soc.).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – overcast; pitch – good.\n\n19/1/1996\n\nv Moseley, Home.

Replacements –Johnson, Deane, Maslen, Nicholas Ref – R Naish. Ground – Pretty good. Weather – Fine and dry\n\nThis evening friendly was another of the all running games we have grown used to, with the ref. struggling hard to stay up at times. Moseley really entered into the spirit and it was a pretty fun evening – riddled with mistakes as these games so often are, but entertaining nevertheless. Robinson was really outstanding both as captain and on the flank, and Butland is beginning to look a real cut above the rest.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nANDY Robinson led Bath to victory with characteristic verve and commitment but his thoughts were already on next weekend’s Pilkington Cup tie at Wakefield.\n\nThe 31-year-old flanker eagerly accepted the chance to turn out against the Birmingham side.\n\n“I felt I needed a game ahead of the cup-tie,” said Robinson. “Contact work in training is not the same as playing a match.\n\n“And Moseley tackled well – we found it particularly difficult to break down their defence close to the line.”\n\nMoseley, of course, are one of the few teams in the last decade to have knocked them out of the cup. Every Bath supporter remembers that fateful day, February 27, 1988.\n\nSo there always seems to be an extra competitive edge to these games, even Friday night friendlies.\n\nThe Rec faithful appeared to be in for a feast of rugby when fly-half Richard Butland sliced through for a try on four minutes. The chance came indirectly from a tapped penalty after an 80-metre move launched by Butland at the other end.\n\nHe converted his own try but Moseley, prompted by former Bristol scrum-half Mark Chudleigh, pulled back to within a point with two penalties by full-back Mike Dossett.\n\nA frustrating period in which the referee’s whistle interrupted play at every turn was finally ended when Bath won a five-metre scrum and mauled their way over the line. Prop Darren Crompton got the touchdown and Butland again converted to leave Bath 14-6 up at the interval.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half, Robinson reacted quickest to a penalty award and his inside pass sent Andy Nicol scampering to the line for a try converted by Butland.\n\nImprobably, that was Bath’s last score. It was Moseley who finished the scoring in the 53rd minute, Eral Anderson crossing in the right corner after good work by former Bath centre Rob Stuart and No 8 Simon Owen.\n\nSCORERS: 4 mins – Butland try & conv, 7-nil; 10 mins – Dossett pen, 7-3; 13 mins – Dossett pen, 7-6; 34 mins – Crompton try, Butland conv, 14-6 (H-T); 42 mins – Nicol try, Butland conv, 21-6; 53 mins – Anderson try, 21-11.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Iacano, Webber, Seager, Blackett; Butland, Nicol; Clark, McCarthy, Crompton, Calver, Redman, Pearce, Amphlett, Robinson.\n\nMOSELEY: Dossett; Anderson, Bonney, Stuart, Wilkinson; Walker, Chudleigh; McKinnon, Ball, Webber, Fletcher, Bright, Johal (rep Holland, 50 mins), Owen, Ord (rep Poll, 42 mins).\n\nREFEREE: Roger Naish (Berkshire)\n\n2/2/1996\n\nv Swansea, Away.

Replacements – Mallett came on for Yates Ref – Peter Rees. Ground – Hard. Weather – Freezing\n\nDespite their continuing intention to run with the ball, Bath failed on their attempt to take away Swansea’s unbeaten home record this season. A largely very young and inexperienced Bath team ultimately gave in to the greater speed and power of the Swansea backs. The pack apparently took the honours, and Charlie Harrison at scrum half had an encouraging debut.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nJOHN Mallett finished on the losing side but the most important thing was that he had actually played a game of rugby – even if it was for only 25 minutes.\n\nWhen the England prop came on as replacement for Kevin Yates, it was his first game at senior level since his international debut against Western Samoa during the World Cup.\n\nBut the 25-year-old schoolteacher was soon struck down by a back complaint which has ruined his season.\n\n“It’s been a nightmare,” he said. “But it’s good to be back again.\n\n“All I’m looking to do now is get a few first team games under my belt and take it from there.”\n\nSensibly enough, Mallett is making no predictions about how soon he can fight his way back into the England side.\n\n“There’s plenty of competition at Bath for me to worry about before I can start thinking about England – but they know what I can do.”\n\nIt was also an important day for 20-year-old Bath University student Charlie Harrison who made a promising debut at scrum-half.\n\nThe last time Bath faced Swansea they hammered the Welshmen 79-3 on the Rec. Three years later Bath again appeared to have the edge up front but made too many errors to make that possession count.\n\nIn fact the scoreline flattered ultimately the visitors who managed only one try to Swansea’s five.\n\nThe first came after just seven minutes when hooker Euros Evans broke through from a maul and No 8 Dean Thomas was in support to send scrum-half Daniel Hawkins over for a try converted by Lee Davies.\n\nBath began in typically adventurous fashion but with the veteran Clive Book at fly-half lacked a cutting edge and, in their desperation, too often dropped passes or gifted possession.\n\nBook did kick a penalty after strong running by Darren Crompton, Yates and Adam Vander but Swansea hit back almost immediately through flanker Colin Charvis.\n\nA 12-3 half-time deficit became 17-3 after 54 minutes when wing Warren Leech beat Yates on the touchline to score the third try. Davies missed the conversion but added a penalty on 68 minutes.\n\nVander was driven over the line for the only Bath try shortly afterwards and Book converted but impressive scrum-half Hawkins grabbed his second at the end, also converted.\n\nSCORERS: 7 mins – Hopkins try, Davies conv, 7-nil; 32 mins – Book pen, 7-3; 36 mins – Charvis try, 12-3 (H-T); 54 mins – Leech try, 17-3; 68 mins – Davies pen, 20-3; 74 mins – Vander try, Book conv, 20-10; 78 mins – Hawkins try, Davies conv, 27-10.\n\nSWANSEA: Boobyer; Leech, Taylor, Weatherley, H Thomas; Davies, Hawkins; Davis (rep Buckett, 58 mins), Evans, Colclough, M Evans (rep S Thomas, 63 mins), Moriarty, Charvis, D Thomas, Field.\n\nBATH: Seager; Iacano, Webber, Perry, Adebayo; Book, Harrison; Yates (rep Mallett, 56 mins), French, Crompton, Haag, Calver, Ojomoh, Pearce, Vander.\n\nREFEREE: Peter Rees (Llandovery).\n\n10/2/1996\n\nv Wakefield, Away. Won 16-12. Team:- Callard (2p), Sleightholme, de Glanville, Guscott (T), Adebayo, Butland (T), Sanders, Hilton, Dawe, Mallett, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Peters, Clarke. Replacements – Harrison, French, Ojomoh Ref – Ashley Rowden. Ground – Gluey. Weather – Overcast\n\nThis game – postponed from late January because of snow – was never going to be easy. But there was no excuse for Bath making it as difficult as they did. They were awful. And hardly anyone escapes criticism, except possibly Sleightholme, Butland, Haag and, in flashed Guscott. The pack never fired as a unit, with Ben Clarke having one of his worse days, and Sanders a nightmare. Wakefield were robbed by a try by Butland in the dying seconds, but they deserved to win, especially with the outstanding Scully at scrum half and some good goal kicking by Jackson at full back. I will never come to terms with Ashley Rowden’s refereeing. This was the first game where Catt opted to play in the United.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nFOR sheer dramatic effect, Richard Butland’s last-minute try was straight out of the Stuart Barnes repertoire.\n\nBarnes got Bath out of some tight corners – notably with that dropped goal in the 1992 cup final – and Butland appears to have inherited that match-winning knack along with the No 10 shirt.\n\nJust 35 seconds of normal time remained on the clock when he swivelled out of a tackle and flopped over the try-line.\n\nEven Bath, masters of the Great Escape, have seldom come as close to such a humiliating defeat, one that would have gone down in cup history with Moseley ’88 and Waterloo three years ago.\n\nButland, now first-choice following Mike Catt’s decision to contest the full-back spot, said: “We like to try to hit the line quickly but we hadn’t had much opportunity to do it for most of the game.\n\n“It just happened to come in the last minute or so. We were shocking but we got through it. To be fair to Wakefield, they played very well and came at us with all cylinders firing.\n\n“But we kept our heads, stuck at it and in the end our experience told.”\n\nIn fact Bath looked dead and buried when yet another dangerous attack resulted in yet another penalty conceded, giving Wakefield a chance to clear their lines.\n\nBut hooker Terry Garnett, one of their most inspiring figures, then deliberately delayed his throw-in and was penalised for timewasting. The consequences will haunt him for the rest of his career.\n\nBath fed Eric Peters on the charge, launched Jon Callard from the ruck and when he was stopped on the line, Butland forced his way over on the blindside. Callard missed the conversion but Bath had done enough.\n\nAs the final whistle blew on Wakefield’s brave effort, Garnett sank to his knees in despair. It was no consolation that England wing Jon Sleightholme immediately went into the home dressing room to tell his ex-teammates that it was the best performance he had seen from a Wakefield team.\n\nYou could hardly say the same of Bath, whose error-strewn display dismayed coach Brian Ashton. “That was a disappointing performance, to say the least,” he said. “We were very lucky to get away with a win in the end.”\n\nIn the opening seco"
