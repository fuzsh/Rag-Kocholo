        "text": "June 3, 2024\n\nIf currently implemented policies are continued with no increase in ambition, there is a 90% chance that the Earth will warm between 2.3°C and 4.5°C, with a best estimate of 3.5°C.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nWith all the talk of “truth-telling” in Australia, some of it worthwhile and some clichéd, Kim Scott’s writing provides an invaluable entry point to a meaningful dialogue.\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\nLess gold in the mines. Unrest in the camps. And a new fishery for the giant Murray cod which decimated their population. The 19th century gold rush has left a bad environmental legacy.\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nOver a decade of protest led to the banning of fuel exploration in New Zealand waters. As this extract from a new book explains, that ‘win’ is still precarious and may depend on the election result.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023\n\nWhere both capacity and integrity are weak, dysfunction is inevitable.\n\nNovember 10, 2022\n\nIt has become an Aboriginal campfire classic. Kids in American inner-city public schools sing it in choir. Chris Gibson unpacks the mystery and enduring appeal of The Church’s Under the Milky Way.\n\nNovember 3, 2022\n\nAs a young child, Amy Thunig, a Gomeroi/Gamilaroi/Kamilaroi woman, moved with her family to be near her father, who was incarcerated in Adelaide. It was a difficult time, but he has taught her much.\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nThe science tells us this is our last chance to avert planetary disaster. Accepting our feelings of intense loss – for ourselves and the Earth – can propel us into action, writes Joelle Gergis.\n\nMarch 24, 2022\n\nScientists themselves seemed to be unaware that their lack of comment on the absurdity of apartheid was a statement in itself.\n\nJune 29, 2021\n\nThe lesson to draw from our conflict over China policy is not that Australia is having trouble identifying its national interest, but that there’s really no such thing as a single national interest.\n\nAugust 14, 2019\n\nContemporary mining disasters echo the devastation caused by Victoria’s gold fields. Victorians campaigned for some of the world’s first laws against industrial pollution.\n\nApril 1, 2018\n\nWhen the First Fleet sailed into Sydney Cove in 1788, they entered an ancient and unforgiving landscape. A new book charts Australians’ relationship with one of the world’s most volatile climates.\n\nNovember 26, 2017\n\nA new book from historian Sally Percival Wood explores how the politically active student media of the 1960s changed Australia socially, culturally and politically.\n\nNovember 14, 2017\n\nIn this book extract, Iram Siraj explains how to help kids get a leg up in a digital world by teaching them communication and other essential 21st century skills young.\n\nFebruary 16, 2017\n\nThe way times have changed is exemplified in the frequency of party coups against sitting prime ministers.\n\nOctober 24, 2016\n\nIn a globalised world, the credibility of the birthright lottery as grounds for excluding people from protection may be diminishing.\n\nAugust 11, 2016\n\nTemporary migrants are excluded from the benefits and rights of Australian citizenship. Is such immigration policy compatible with Australia’s democratic principles and values?\n\nJuly 7, 2016\n\nIt is important to restore public trust in any future decision for Australia to go to war. For this, a system that provides better democratic accountability is essential."
