Obviously likes watching as well as playing.\n\nJunior Polu: as well as being at North Harbour, he's been named in the Chiefs Super 14 squad.\n\nIs Ryan Manyika actually at Leeds? I have looked on their site and can't see him in their squad!\n\nHe is however named in the Zimbabwe Cheetahs 7s Squad\n\nI don't think Manyika ever went to Leeds.\n\nJames Inglis is still with Esher - coming back from a lengthy lay-off.\n\nProf or anyone - sensible question here - in which year did Will Carling leave?\n\nRamin Mathieson is at Edinburgh Accies\n\nDavid Officer is coaching at Boroughmuir\n\nViliame (Bill) Satala is at Toyota Shokki in Japan\n\nJohnny Rodham is at Sedgley Park\n\nAgustin Costa Repetto is at Petraca Padova\n\nChris Cracknell is at Bath\n\nNicolas Spanghero is at Colomiers\n\nAce Tiatia is at Bayonne\n\nAlton Ozdemir is now the scrum coach at Plymouth\n\nGarrick Morgan is coach at the Gold Coast Breakers\n\nNorman Ligari is at La Rochelle\n\n(there's also two Alex Mockfords on the list)\n\nMike Weddeburn is a Sky Sports News presenter rather than cricket commentator\n\nEdited 2 time(s). Last edit at 2009:11:11:14:24:53 by West Stand Quin.\n\nQuote:\n\nQuinten Poulsen\n\nI don't think Manyika ever went to Leeds.\n\nCheers QP, that is what I thought.\n\nSteve White-Cooper isn't at Staines any longer.\n\nPhil Burgess is indeed playing at Loughborough students (and\n\nhas played Glaws A) and is currently holding the 1st xv number 8 shirt,just ahead of someone else I believe is a former quins academy player - mike macfarlane\n\nCheers all - I think that's everything updated\n\nWhat about the Claxtons? Three of them, don't forget and one was Club Captain.\n\nI saw Steve White-Cooper outside the Garryowen before our game with Saracens earlier this season. A hero of our European Shield winning campaign in 2001...\n\nTerry Claxton can be found, most evenings in The Admiral Nelson, Whitton. He's very approachable. Buy him a pint of Pride and I'm sure he'll tell you what he's been up to!\n\nZinzan lives with me.He sulks if he isn't the centre of attention and has the tendency to bite if he doesn't get his own way.\n\nTu Tamarua has retired (with the distinction of being the only non Samoan, Tongan or Fijian to play for the Pacific Islanders. He's a Cook Islander)\n\nAndy Dunne is no longer at Connacht. Playing semi pro for Old Belvedere\n\nArwel Thomas has retired\n\nMatt Powell has retired from playing and is now a coach at Worcester\n\nDarren O'Leary has retired and is now a rugby agent for Top Marque Sports\n\nBilly Fulton has retired and now works in construction (ISG PLC) in the city.\n\nIsoa Damudamu is no longer at Newbury, represents the Army and England 7s\n\nAndy Reay is no longer listed in the Newbury squad\n\nRyan Strudwick isn't at Connacht any more, possibly retired.\n\nGeorge Harder is no longer at Mont De Marson\n\nI'm pretty sure George retired.\n\nDo you think Billy Fulton would like to come and build that cellar I designed for him and Ben Willis?\n\nBayonne play Wasps on Sat 12th Dec so I'm hoping to catch up with Ace. Surely he can't run that quickly any more?\n\nSome great research going on from people with too much time on their hands!\n\nWell done though.\n\nDon't mean to be nit-picky but isn't Tony Diprose's title a bit more than Academy Assistant Coach? Programme has him as first XV Backs coach and Academy Manager. He is a great bloke. We mustn't under-sell him.\n\nI think Collin Osborne may object to Dippy being called Backs coach - he's defence coach isn't he? Sorry for nit-picking!\n\nAndy Reay - Moseley\n\nDavid Pears - retired\n\nJames Hayter - left Esher to emigrate to US a year or two ago\n\nJason Keyter - left Esher following his drug ban several years ago\n\nQuote:\n\nJTD\n\nTerry Claxton can be found, most evenings in The Admiral Nelson, Whitton. He's very approachable. Buy him a pint of Pride and I'm sure he'll tell you what he's been up to!\n\nI stand corrected on the venue. Terry can be found in The Prince Albert, Whitton.\n\nWhat's Geo Cronje up to these days? I heard he had a farming accident a couple of years ago but nothing since.\n\nAll updated again\n\nHayter plays for NYAC these days\n\nI heard Cronje retired after his farming accident.\n\nIt appears that chris Cracknell is moving on from Bath. I think he only had a short term contract (4 months?) there.\n\nHe has however been selected for the England sevens squad.\n\nChris Cracknell\n\nJeremy Staunton - London Wasps (was at London Irish & London Wasps)\n\nI think this needs to be updated to somewhere in the East Midlands otherwise he is going round in circles.\n\nAll updated, info on Tom Billups added too\n\nRory Hamilton-Brown has returned to Surrey as captain after Sussex agreed to his release.\n\n\"Chris Wright - London Scottish (coach) & founder and Hon Sec of the Harlequins Hall of Fame\"....\n\nProf, do you think Chris Wright might be able to help me track down a former Harlequins player by the name of Bloxam between the Wars last century? How can I contact him/The Hall of Fame?\n\nOr do you have any other suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\nThe game's afoot;\n\nFollow your spirit: and upon this charge,\n\nCry � God for Harry! England and Saint George\n\nI met Henry Barratt today. He has retired from rugby through injury and is now a personal trainer.\n\n[www.henrybarratt.com]\n\nDeadly, the only player by that name to have played for the 1st XV was EC Bloxam who made one appearance on 27/12/1920 against the Royal Air Force at Queen's Club.

Last edit at 2011:10:24:09:05:45 by DOK.\n\nTOULOUSE, France � South African international duo Gurthro Steenkamp and Gary Botha penned three-year deals with French champions Toulouse on Friday after signing from Blue Bulls.\n\nA World Cup winner in 2007, the 30-year-old prop Steenkamp played five matches at the 2011 World Cup where his team reached the quarterfinals.\n\nBotha, also part of the 2007 squad, spent the last three seasons with Harlequins in England.\n\nI thought Gary left us to return to SA and his family. Have I got this wrong? I'm even more excited to see how we front up against Toulouse, Gary was a terrific player.\n\n........................................\n\nOne of the founder members of the Q-GOMC (promoted to Major Grump) � and proud of it - Bah!\n\nHasn't Ben Gollings joined up with Neil Back at Rugby?\n\nThink gollings is now player coach at rugby isn't he, or did that fall through?\n\nPhil Burgess is currently a member of Cornish Pirates 2011/2012 squad.\n\nOllie Kohn seems to be running an interesting sideline, not only in hog-roasts, but also in modelling suits for 'oversized' gentlemen....\n\n[www.bigtallorder.co.uk]\n\nQuote:\n\nScamble\n\nOllie Kohn seems to be running an interesting sideline, not only in hog-roasts, but also in modelling suits for 'oversized' gentlemen....\n\n[www.bigtallorder.co.uk]\n\nThat looks suspiciously like the entrance to Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons in the background. Surely that's a conflict of interest?\n\nnah, that's not Le Manoir\n\nBurgess is in his second season with Pirates.\n\nLast season he scored 14 tries.....not bad for a back row forward\n\nFormer Wales international Hal Luscombe could make his debut off the bench for Chippenham at the Allington Fields as the Wiltshire side host struggling Newbury Blues.\n\nChippenham, who slumped to 43-nil defeat away to unbeaten league leaders Bournemouth last weekend, also give a debut to another South African-born player with Graham Ridler starting at scrum-half.\n\nSam Saunders switches to full back with Rupert Crockett returning in the centre.\n\nChippenham (home v Newbury Blues, 3pm): S Saunders; C Fletcher, F Clilverd, R Crockett, M Beswick; L Surry, G Ridler; J Meadows, A Clark, P Kirby, R Lyons (capt), A Price, J Turner, N Doyle, J Doubleday.

Not resigned by Notts this season and we've struggled at flanker, but signing ex Newcastle Brent Wilson hopefully will fill the void left behind after Lukes departure.\n\nBest of luck to Luke Sherriff in the future, he was a very nice chap.\n\nI remember him being thought of as Simon Miall's butler and the shouts from the stand of \"hit him with your butler Simon!\"\n\nI always like Luke as a player.
