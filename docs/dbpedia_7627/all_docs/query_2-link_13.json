        "text": "At what age did you first play rugby?\n\nI joined Cranleigh when I was about 11. My dad kept me out of rugby until it was full contact – he knew I’d get bored.\n\nHave you always been a back-row?\n\nI was a centre to start with and I moved to second-row when I was about 13, then into the back row when we first had full scrums.\n\nDo you prefer No 8?\n\nI enjoy all three back-row positions but I like No 8 the best because you get to carry quite a bit.\n\nYou played in the JP Morgan Sevens for Harlequins at just 17. What was that like?\n\nThere were a few guys my age in it and it was good fun. It tested your fitness and physicality. I’ve been with Quins since I was about 14.\n\nWho are your mentors?\n\nThe main one is Quins academy manager Tony Diprose. I go through my games with him.\n\nYou made your Aviva Premiership debut this spring, was that one of your aims this season?\n\nI wanted to play well in the A league and on loan at Esher, and get as many Quins appearances as I could. I also wanted England to do well in the U20 Six Nations – it’s the first time I’ve been the proper captain of a team.\n\nWhat’s your next aim?"
