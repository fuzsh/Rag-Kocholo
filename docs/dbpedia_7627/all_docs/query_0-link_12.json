She kept the match statistics and provided short, pithy comments on each match – the Pressmen depended on her.\n\nMajor input towards Bath’s success must be attributed to the forward looking coaching triumvirate of Jack Rowell, Dave Robson and Tom Hudson.\n\nOther support specialists came to occupy prime positions, such as Ged Roddy of Bath University, who intensified a fitness programme first introduced by Hudson. Each player had his personal fitness programme, which was closely monitored.\n\n4/9/1993\n\nv Garryowen, Away. Won 38-8. Team:- Callard (4c), Swift (Tx2), de Glanville (Tx2), Catt, Lloyd, Barnes (Tx2), Hill, Chilcott, Dawe, Mallett, McCoy, Redman, Robinson, Hall, Clarke. Replacements – Atkins, Sanders, Lewis, Ojomoh Ref – Leo Mayne. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Sunny\n\nA great start to a new season, with Bath playing an expansive and impressive fast game, much to the interest of the Limerick crowd, assembled to celebrate the opening of their new clubhouse.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nGARRYOWEN pushed the boat out as only the Irish can to mark the opening of a new clubhouse complex at their Dooradoyle headquarters in Limerick.\n\nThere were marching bands, a lavish pre-match reception, speeches from the Irish RFU president and other dignitaries but nothing graced the occasion like a five-star performance from Ben Clarke.\n\nThe England back row man, star of this summer’s Lions tour of New Zealand, turned in a performance of the highest quality, full of power, pace, commitment and awareness.\n\nGarryowen have recently appointed as coach as astute a rugby man as you would find anywhere – David Leslie, skipper of the All Blacks during the mid-70s and more recently a consultant to the Irish Rugby Union.\n\n“If you’re talking about world-class players, there’s none better than this man,” he said. “And he’ll get better and better.\n\n“He’s the kind of honest-to-goodness forward we appreciate in New Zealand but he has a rare quality about him,” added Leslie, who was not so much disappointed at his own side’s display as delighted that Bath practised the rugby gospel he intends to preach in Ireland.\n\n“I would say that there are only two or three club sides back home who can play the game the way Bath do. It’s an approach that seems sadly lacking in the British Isles but at least our players know now exactly what I’m aiming for.”\n\nFor the time being though they had to rely on traditional Irish virtues, even down the up-and-under tactic that bears the club’s name. A furious opening ten minutes was no more than Bath expected, however, and they rode the storm until it blew itself out.\n\nFor the remaining 70 minutes, the English champions were in control, largely through the efforts of the back row of Clarke, Andy Robinson and new skipper John Hall. The ball was circulated between forwards and backs with mesmerising speed and sleight of hand.\n\nFirst try of the new season went to Stuart Barnes in the 19th minute, supporting Mike Catt and Tony Swift after Hall had set up a ruck. Jon Callard converted from in front of the posts.\n\nThe second was an altogether more spectacular affair, Clarke launching the move on his own 22 and launching Barnes on a 60-metre dash which was carried on by Swift who sent Phil de Glanville under the posts. Remarkably, Clarke was the other player in support.\n\nAlthough Garryowen’s international backs, Phil Danaher and Richard Wallace, might have prised an opening, the final pass too often went astray and their only reward was a Kenny Smith penalty.\n\nA quick heel, Clarke’s surge and a stiletto-sharp Barnes break 30 metres to the posts took the score to 21-3 after 50 minutes. Swift added a fourth try, squeezing in at the corner and the romp continued with de Glanville’s second, skipping round a tackle.\n\nCallard chipped to the corner for Swift to touch down another but Garryowen roused themselves for a grandstand finish and forced flanker Dara O’Sullivan over the line in the closing seconds.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – 3 STARS\n\nBATH FORM: commanding.\n\nSCORERS: 19 mins – Barnes try, Callard conv, nil-7; 28 mins – de Glanville try, Callard conv, nil-14; 39 mins – Kenny Smith pen, 3-14; H-T – 3-14; 49 mins – Barnes try, Callard conv, 3-21; 62 mins – Swift try, 3-26; 69 mins – de Glanville try, Callard conv, 3-33; 77 mins – Swift try, 3-38; 79 mins – Der O’Sullivan try, 8-38.\n\nGARRYOWEN: Larkin; Wallace, Danaher, Smith, Sheehan; Murphy, Barry; Spain, Cunningham, Ronan, Costello, Coughlan, Hogan, Cronin, O’Sullivan.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Lloyd; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Mallett, Redman, McCoy, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: Leo Mayne (Munster).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – excellent\n\n11/9/1993\n\nv Bristol, Away. Won 18-10. Team:- Callard (1p & 1c), Swift, de Glanville, Catt (Tx2), Lumsden, Barnes (1p), Hill, Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Hall, Clarke. Replacements – Beddow, Mallett, Sanders Ref – David Matthews. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Sunny.\n\nTypical dour local derby. Bath didn’t play well in the first half and there were a number of injuries. Things moved in the second half and Bristol ran out of steam and ideas, until Bath let them have a late and stupid try. My man of the match was Andy Robinson.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTHE records will forever show that Mike Catt, the latest recruit to Bath’s all-star band of rugby superheroes, was the man who decided a typically dour derby struggle at the Memorial Ground.\n\nBut those records will not tell anything like the real story. Bath won, yet again, not because their young South African centre ran in two well-taken tries but because the men at the other end of the age scale hit Bristol were it hurt most – up front.\n\nGareth Chilcott, Graham Dawe, Nigel Redman – these particular old hands had served a long sentence in the dark dungeon of the Bath scrum. They were, Bristol felt, ready to be picked off. Wrong. When the home pack went for the jugular in a bruising and exhausting first half, they found their opponents just as mean and grimly determined as ever. They were not prepared to curl up and die, not by a long\n\nchalk.\n\nAfter enjoying the best of the opening 30 minutes, Bristol found the game beginning to shift on its psychological axis as the champions turned the tables in the line-out. By the end, the old stagers were also outscrummaging their younger and supposedly hungrier challengers.\n\nIt confirmed once more that Bath can win on desire alone for, truth to tell, they had a rotten day by their own awesome standards.\n\nRichard Hill and Stuart Barnes were less than telepathic at half-back, Ben Clarke’s rampaging runs were repeatedly cut short by the magnificent Derek Eves and there was no scent of an opening for Tony Swift and Audley Lumsden on the wings.\n\n“At the end of the season, we’ll look back on that and be very grateful for the two points we came out with,” said new skipper John Hall, fully aware that his side had played badly and got away with it.\n\nNot that Bristol can consider themselves in any sense unlucky. Alastair Saverimutto showed flashes of inspiration in broken play and proved beyond doubt that he belongs at this level, but no-one else had much ammunition to unleash.\n\nTheir game plan, geared to forward dominance, worked well early on. Simon Shaw, who had another fine game, churned out some quality middle line-out ball and there were several threatening raids into Bath territory.\n\nRob Armstrong and Mark Regan joined forces with Eves to set up an inviting drop goal position while Paul Hull and Saverimutto sent Peter Stiff charging upfield to win a kickable penalty. Mark Tainton, though, was wide with both kicks.\n\nThe first big turning point came on the half-hour. Tainton produced a beautiful rolling kick that found touch six inches from the Bath line, but Martin Haag won vital two-handed ball under extreme pressure.\n\nThat gave the out-of-favour front jumper such a confidence boost that he proceeded to take a string of clean catches in important positions. Suddenly, Bristol’s supply line was shut off.\n\nHaag also made a decisive contribution to Bath’s first try, cleverly making the extra man as the ball sped right from Andy Robinson’s lunge into the Bristol 22.\n\nCatt, who had already produced a saving tackle on David John, just squeezed in at the corner.\n\nCatt pulled off another desperate tackle 10 minutes after the break, stopping Tainton 12 metres out after excellent work from Saverimutto and Kyran Bracken.\n\nBristol’s last chance of glory had slipped away. When David Hinkins tumbled over the top at a ruck in front of the Bristol posts, Jon Callard had no difficulty in giving Bath a two-score cushion.\n\nThey tied it up 13 minutes from time when Catt charged down Dean Wring’s clearance, sped after the rebound and touched down inches in front of the dead ball line.\n\nBristol’s tackling, so strong all afternoon, stayed together sufficiently to deny Bath another score and, against the odds, they managed one of their own at the death.\n\nBracken’s quick tapped penalty allowed Eves to run full pelt through a rare gap in Bath’s midfield defence. The skipper galloped fully 35 metres, set up fast ruck ball and Saverimutto made the line with ease.\n\nMatch Facts.\n\nEntertainment rating: two stars.\n\nBristol/Bath form – patchy.\n\nScorers: 4 mins – Barnes pen, 0-3; 10 mins – Tainton\n\npen, 3-3; 34 mins – Catt try, 3-8; H-T, 3-8; 58 mins –\n\nCallard pen, 3-11; 67 mins – Catt try, Callard con,\n\n3-18; 82 mins – Saverimutto try, Tainton con, 10-18.\n\nBristol: Hull; John, Wring, Saverimutto; Crossland; Tainton, Bracken; Sharp, Regan, Hinkins, Stiff, Shaw, Armstrong, Barrow, Eves.\n\nReferee: David Matthews (Liverpool).\n\nConditions: Weather – bright, light breeze. Pitch – perfect.\n\nQUOTES PIECE.\n\nGARETH Chilcott’s true influence on Bath’s latest league victory over their great local rivals only emerged after the game. The veteran loosehead prop, almost certainly making his final appearance at the Memorial Ground, called his forwards together after 30 minutes for a typical “Cooch”-style dressing down.\n\n“We’d started terribly slowly and Bristol were getting right in there amongst us,” he said. “We weren’t giving it anything like enough. “I called everyone together and said: `You look as though you don’t want this one. Remember who you’re playing. I don’t want to lose to this lot and I don’t think you do either. But we will if we don’t get stuck in.’\n\n“It seemed to do the trick. I think we were well on top come the end – when the Bristol forwards called a big scrum, we didn’t go anywhere. In fact, we put them up in the air at one point.”\n\nChilcott’s importance to the side was confirmed by front row partner Graham Dawe, who described him as “almost irreplaceable”. “I don’t suppose even Cooch would claim he gets around the field as much as he did, but he’ll always be the first name on my teamsheet,” said the Cornishman. “He makes my life so easy.\n\n“We knew they were talking about coming at us in the front row, but they were never going to get the better of us in that department. Cooch told us what he wanted in the dressing room and, after a ropey start, we gave it to him on the pitch.”\n\nBath coach Jack Rowell held out more consolation for Bristol’s forwards, who he described as a “huge and formidable outfit”. “I thought Simon Shaw was outstanding – when Andy Blackmore returns, they really will have a line-out to compete with the best,’ he said.\n\n“We continue to have trouble in the height department. These days, 6ft 5ins just isn’t tall enough. Bristol have genuine height and that makes them dangerous.\n\n“I’m sure we’re all disappointed with our performance. That was a game we could have lost in playing the way we did. The two points are ours but we know we’ll have to improve a lot on that performance.”\n\nBristol skipper Derek Eves had no complaints at the result. “We just didn’t score points from good positions,” he admitted. “It was a typical derby – we made two mistakes and they scored two tries from them. I could see the first try coming from miles out – they got in behind us and we just couldn’t get the cover across.”\n\nPerhaps the most salient comment on a disappointing game came from Stuart Barnes.” I had a feeling of deja vu out there,” said the Bath and England fly-half. “They kicked, we kicked, everyone tackled. So what’s new”\n\n18/9/1993\n\nv Northampton, Home. Won 37-9. Team:- Callard (T, 4c & 3p), Swift, de Glanville, Lewis, Lumsden (Tx2), Barnes, Hill, Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Hall, Clarke (T). Replacements – Atkins, Ojomoh, Sanders Ref – Jim Pearson. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Sunny.\n\nA cracking game, with the team really getting into top gear. Callard outstanding, but everyone contrived to make Northampton look pretty ordinary. Bath now lead the League by one point.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nFOR those who saw Audley Lumsden suffer a broken neck on that fateful night in Plymouth three and a half years ago, his return to Courage League action was particularly poignant.\n\nMany doubted whether Lumsden, still only 26, would ever regain the sharpness and zest for rugby which marked him out as one of the finest attacking talents in the game in the late 1980s.\n\nAs if recovery from such a life-threatening injury was not difficult enough, the comeback was cruelly interrupted by a twice-broken leg.\n\nBut this crushing victory over Northampton featured two tries from the Oxford Blue which oozed quality – the first a virtuoso effort, the second a team effort of bewildering speed and complexity.\n\nBath were already 3-nil up thanks to a Jon Callard penalty when a counter-attack launched left wing Lumsden inside his own half. Entering the 22, it took only the merest suggestion of a feint and change of pace to leave the final defender, England B scrum-half Matthew Dawson, sprawling in his wake.\n\nWithin three minutes it was 17-nil as Bath conjured quite the most breathtaking try. Skipper John Hall made a two-handed tap at the front of a line-out and, with fellow flanker Andy Robinson as the link in midfield, Callard, Tony Swift and Phil de Glanville ripped the defence apart to send Lumsden in at the corner.\n\n“Northampton’s big mistake was to keep saying in the press how beatable we were,” said a smiling Lumsden, now a physics teacher at Millfield School. “That really got us going. They should have kept their mouths shut.”\n\nA chastened Saints captain, John Olver, admitted afterwards: “Bath were exceptional today, just in two spells really, when they were scoring tries at will. When they’re on song, it’s very difficult to play against.\n\n“We spent a lot of time in their half but they are very good at soaking up pressure and then killing you off.” Then he added soberly: “It’s back to the drawing board, I suppose.”\n\nNor was 6ft 10in Lions lock Martin Bayfield allowed to dominate the line-out in his customary fashion. And although Northampton coach Glenn Ross has talked about introducing a more dynamic approach, it is clear that they – and the other First Division sides – are light years behind the champions in this regard.\n\nFor instance, Bath regard every scrum outside their own 22 as an attacking platform.\n\nThe third try, from an unpromising position 20 metres inside the Bath half, demonstrated just why. Callard took Hill’s pass on the blindside, sent Tony Swift away down the touchline and Ben Clarke, an awesome sight in full cry, was on his inside to sprint the last 40 metres.\n\nFive minutes later, a surge by the Lions back row man from a scrum on half-way was carried on by Robinson and Hill; Hall then set up the ruck for Hill and Clarke to send Callard in at the flag.\n\nCallard had landed every one of the six kicks offered to him but this was by far the most difficult, out on the right touchline. The kick was perfect, however, leaving the full-back with a personal tally of 22 points, including three penalties.\n\nAmazingly, Bath did not score again and Northampton sent flanker Craig Millhouse over for what everybody except Bristol touch judge Gerry Foley reckoned was a try. He had correctly spotted Olver punching and Bath gratefully accepted the penalty.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – four stars\n\nBATH FORM: deadly\n\nSCORERS: 1 min – Callard pen, 3-nil; 9 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 10-nil; 12 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 17-nil; 14 mins – Grayson pen, 17-3; 18 mins – Callard pen, 20-3; 28 mins – Grayson pen, 20-6; H-T – 20-6; 55 mins – Clarke try, Callard conv, 27-6; 58 mins – Callard pen, 30-6; 60 mins – Callard try and conv, 37-6; 62 mins – Grayson pen, 37-9.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, de Glanville, Lewis, Lumsden; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nNORTHAMPTON: Steele; Thorneycroft, Beal, Fielden, Packman; Grayson, Dawson; Baldwin, Olver, Pearce, Bayfield, Phillips, Walton, Rodber, Millhouse.\n\nREFEREE: John Pearson (Durham Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – fine; pitch – excellent\n\n25/9/1993\n\nv Orrell, Away. Won 18-15. Team:- Callard (T, 1c & 1p), Swift, de Glanville, Guscott (T), Lumsden, Barnes (1p), Hill, Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Hall, Clarke. Replacements – Adams replaced Callard (29 mins), Catt replaced Swift (8 mins) & Crompton Ref – R Rees. Ground – Excellent. Weather – Sunny.\n\nTypical rough, tough match against Orrell. Bath severely disrupted by injuries and finished up with Robinson playing on the wing. Callard received a head injury needing 14 stitches. All Orrell’s points were penalties. Referee could have been better.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH skipper John Hall made no attempt to hide his relief as the champions preserved their 100 per cent record in the Courage League.\n\nForced by injuries to shift flanker Andy Robinson out on to the wing for the last hour, they very nearly surrendered a 12-point lead as veteran centre Simon Langford landed five penalties.\n\nBut with two more points in the bag Hall can also be confident that, on their home ground, the no-nonsense Northerners are likely to be a tough proposition for Bath’s First Division rivals.\n\n“Aside from the disruptions, I’m a little bit disappointed in the way we played,” he said. “We gave away too many penalties, made too many unforced errors. But a lot of sides are going to lose here. We didn’t – and that’s what counts.”\n\nBath have never found it easy to strut their stuff at Edgehall Road so it was all the more encouraging when their particular brand of pace and vision yielded two smart tries in the first quarter.\n\nThey had already lost prolific wing Tony Swift with a hamstring injury when Langford put Orrell ahead with a penalty. But the visitors were soon presented with a kickable chance on the right.\n\nQuick-witted as ever, Jon Callard simply tapped the ball to himself and darted past a couple of surprised defenders to touch down near the corner.\n\nA couple of minutes later, a sloppy Orrell clearance allowed lock Martin Haag and then Hall to set up rucks in midfield. Stuart Barnes darted left and cleverly found Jeremy Guscott who showed no sign of his groin injury as he sprinted in from 40 metres.\n\nCallard’s conversion and a straightforward penalty shortly after put Bath 15-3 up but the full-back’s departure on the half hour with a gashed head proved a turning point.\n\nWith Mike Catt already on for Swift, flanker Gareth Adams was the obvious replacement, coming on for his league debut. However that entailed Robinson switching to the blindside wing while Audley Lumsden covered full-back.\n\nThe balance of the side thus altered, Bath lost their composure and gave away a string of penalties as tempers began to fray. Langford got close enough to reduce the margin to 15-6 only for Barnes to then bang one over from the half-way line on the stroke of half-time.\n\nIt was backs-to-the-wall in the second half as Orrell, chivvied by England and Lions scrum-half Dewi Morris, exploited the wind and slope through Gerry Ainscough’s boot to pin Bath in their own half. What they lacked however was the wit or pace to create try-scoring opportunities.\n\nLangford kicked his fifth penalty in the 53rd minute but that was the end of the scoring as Bath settled into a defensive posture, confident in their tackling and in the ability of Haag to win his own line-out ball.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: resilient\n\nSCORERS: 8 mins – Langford pen, 3-nil; 13 mins – Callard try, 3-5; 16 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 3-12; 19 mins – Callard pen, 3-15; 36 mins – Langford pen, 6-15; 40 mins – Barnes pen, 6-18; H-T – 6-18; 45 mins – Langford pen, 9-18; 48 mins – Langford pen, 12-18; 53 mins – Langford pen, 15-18.\n\nORRELL: Taberner; Naylor, Langford, Wynn, Hamer; Ainscough, Morris; Hynes, French, Southern, Cusani, Brierley, Cleary, Manley, Ashurst.\n\nBATH: Callard (rep Adams, 31 mins); Swift (rep Catt, 8 mins), de Glanville, Guscott, Lumsden; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: Chris Rees (London Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – excellent.\n\n2/10/1993\n\nv Gloucester, Home.

Replacements – Ojomoh, Sanders, Mallett Ref – Brian Campsall. Ground – Very Good. Weather – Fine.\n\nBath played excellently in patches, with some spectacular tries, but still giving away numbers of penalties. Gloucester immensely disappointing.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nIF anyone hoped that England’s top players would be offered any much-needed respite before facing the might of the All Blacks next month, they will have to think again.\n\nJust seven days before the Twickenham international, the Courage League will stage its own showpiece in front of 12,000 at Welford Road. Leicester v Bath on November 20 will go a long way to deciding the destination of the championship.\n\n“That could be the toughest of all; it looks like the crunch match,” said Gareth Chilcott after Bath made it four wins out of four over their hapless West Country rivals.\n\nAt the same time Leicester were establishing their credentials as prime challengers with a 38-6 win over Wasps, who play host to Bath on Saturday.\n\nBut front row veteran Chilcott, who retires in December, does not believe that record defeat will have served to soften up the Londoners. “Just the opposite,” he declared. “The `Waspies’ are dangerous animals when stirred up. It will just make things more difficult for us – but at least we’ll know what to expect.”\n\nCertainly, Bath cannot afford to let their concentration waver as they did against Gloucester. The men from Kingsholm no longer strike fear into opponents but injured pride was avenged by two second-half tries as the home side sat back on a 32-3 lead.\n\nHowever, there had never been any doubt about the outcome once Ben Clarke crossed in the corner as early as the third minute, a chance presented when Tim Smith spilled Jon Callard’s kick.\n\nCallard, scalp swathed in a turban-like protective bandage, landed the touch-line conversion and went on to reinforce his claims for an England debut against the All Blacks with 16 points from five conversions and two penalties.\n\nIn cruelly stark contrast, Tim Smith and Paul Beech miss-hit all four chances presented in the first half.\n\nOn the half-hour Jeremy Guscott strode over for the second try after stand-in fly-half Mike Catt neatly pierced the cover. Gloucester knew there was no way back from 17-nil.\n\nMuch to skipper John Hall’s annoyance, Bath seemed to take a breather after half-time. Given their ability to strike whenever the need arises from any position on the field, it is perhaps understandable that they occasionally sit back and admire their work.\n\nAfter Beech and Callard exchanged penalties, the champions stirred themselves again, prompted by some spectacular catching by the outstanding Nigel Redman. The result was a brace of close-range tries for tighthead Victor Ubogu, another with designs on an England place.\n\nOne blot on the Bath performance was again their tendency to concede penalties, 20 in all. Gloucester eventually capitalised by conjuring tries for centre Damian Cummins and impressive right wing Paul Holford.\n\nRoused again, Bath worked Adedayo Adebayo over on the right – a superb individual effort – and finally rounded things off with a sixth try from scrum-half Richard Hill after Phil de Glanville had made a stunning 50-metre break.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – 3 stars\n\nBATH FORM: nonchalant\n\nSCORERS: 3 mins – Clarke try, Callard conv, 7-nil; 24 mins – Callard pen, 10-nil; 31 mins – Guscott try, Callard conv, 17-nil; H-T: 17-nil; 42 mins – Beech pen, 17-3; 51 mins – Callard pen, 20-3; 54 mins – Ubogu try, Callard conv, 27-3; 58 mins – Ubogu try, 32-3; 66 mins – Cummins try, Smith conv, 32-10; 70 mins – Holford try, Beech conv – 32-17; 74 mins – Adebayo try, Callard conv, 39-17; 78 mins – Hill try, Callard conv, 46-17.\n\nBATH: Callard; Adebayo, de Glanville, Guscott, Lumsden; Catt, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nGLOUCESTER: T Smith; Holford, Cummins, Caskie (rep Merchant, 19 mins), Nicholson; Beech, Hannaford; Phillips, Hawker, Jones, Sims, West, Ashmead, Masters, I Smith.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Campsall (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – overcast; pitch – well grassed.\n\n9/10/1993\n\nv Wasps, Away.

Should have won by more.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nALL Wasps’ complaints of dodgy refereeing decisions could not wipe the grin off John Hall’s face at Sudbury.\n\nHall has a 100 per cent record as Bath skipper so the champions are sitting pretty at the top of the Courage League table with a two-point lead after the first five matches.\n\nAdmittedly, there were doubts about their second try, credited to Ben Clarke, while Wasps captain Dean Ryan was vehement in his claim that he had crossed at the posts in injury time.\n\nBut in a programme of 18 matches, home and away, there are going to be occasions when luck plays its part. and Wasps had more than their fair share last season.\n\nEach of Hall’s predecessors, Stuart Barnes and Andy Robinson, has achieved the double and the new captain has devised his own strategy to tackle the toughest domestic season in rugby history.\n\n“The message I’ve tried to get over to the team – and they keep joking about it – is that we are trying to break the season down into digestible chunks,” said the England blindside.\n\n“This was the first chunk. We’ve bitten that off and swallowed it,” he added with some satisfaction.\n\n“Now we’ve got a pause while we’re off to the divisionals. That will be good for us. We can regroup, sort out the injuries and get ready for the next league matches.”\n\nBath were in control of this game until the last four minutes when Graham Childs, the centre who nearly joined them three years ago, cut through to score under the posts. Rob Andrew’s conversion set up a pulsating period of injury time when Ryan claimed his “score.”\n\nIrish referee Gordon Black thought otherwise and awarded Bath a scrum from which Jon Callard cleared to touch to end the game.\n\nIt was Callard, being watched again by England manager Geoff Cooke, who laid the foundations for victory with three first-half penalties. He might have had a try too but for a superb cover tackle by Rob Andrew after nine minutes.\n\nOther scoring opportunities were restricted by both sides’ inability to hang on to the ball.\n\nBath enjoyed a marked advantage in the scrums and also broke even in the line-out even though Wasps had 24 throws to the visitors’ ten. Again Martin Haag provided clean possession at the front while Hall and Clarke were effective predators at the back.\n\nThe Londoners turned round 9-3 down but with the setting sun and a stiff breeze behind them. At the restart however, Andrew kicked the ball dead and Jeff Probyn compounded the error by dropping the resulting scrum on halfway.\n\nStuart Barnes’s penalty took Bath within striking range and after a couple of rucks the fly-half darted through the narrowest of gaps to expose the home defence. Chris Oti tried to spoil the pass to Adedayo Adebayo but the impressive Andy Robinson swooped on the loose ball and Haag and Adebayo put Mike Catt over in the corner.\n\nRampaging runs by Clarke and Victor Ubogu should have been finished off too, but Clarke did take the score to 19-6 after Hall had robbed Ryan in the line-out. Ryan claimed with some justification that Clarke had grounded the ball short of the line.\n\nIt was only then that Wasps roused themselves for a pulsating finish. Their chance for revenge will come on March 12 at the Recreation Ground.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – 3 stars\n\nBATH FORM: combative\n\nSCORERS: 10 mins – Callard pen, nil-3; 23 mins – Andrew pen, 3-3; 30 mins – Callard pen, 3-6; 36 mins – Callard pen, 3-9; H-T – 3-9; 42 mins – Catt try, 3-14; 60 mins – Andrew pen, 6-14; 67 mins – Clarke try, 6-19; 79 mins – Childs try, Andrew conv, 13-19.\n\nWASPS: Buzza (rep Skinner, 67 mins); P Hopley, Childs, D Hopley, Oti (rep Dallaglio, 55 mins); Andrew, Bates; Holmes, Dunn, Probyn, Kinsey, Ryan, Greenwood, Wilkins, White.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Catt, Adebayo; Barnes, Hill; Ubogu, Dawe, Chilcott, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: Gordon Black (Irish RFU).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – sunny; pitch – lush.\n\n15/10/1993\n\nv Llanelli, Away.

It was a 1st XV debut for Eric Peters. Ref – K Brackston. Weather – Evening Game – cold.\n\nBath made a good start, but allowed a 19-5 lead to slip away owing to poor goal kicking and handling by the backs. Pack played well.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nONLY Bath would even contemplate a trip to Llanelli in the knowledge that their 20 best players were not available.\n\nBut even they could not have dreamed that a second team liberally sprinkled with under-21s could lead for all of 80 minutes before being denied a famous victory by two injury-time tries.\n\nIt was a hugely encouraging performance from the next generation but among those players the reaction was one of acute disappointment.\n\nNone more so than scrum-half Ian Sanders whose clever overhead pass to debutant centre Danny Fox had opened up the home defence for a superb third try by hooker Colin Atkins.\n\nUnfortunately, when Sanders tried the same thing again, his pass was intercepted by Matthew Wintle who sped 50 metres to the posts. Colin Stephens’ conversion left Llanelli just two points adrift with around ten minutes left.\n\n“I felt I’d been playing well up to that point,” said Sanders. “That’s what makes it so disappointing. I should have gone back to the forwards or kicked it, but I suppose you learn by your mistakes. I certainly have.”\n\nThere was also a hint of ill fortune about the decisive score by centre Simon Davies, exploiting an overlap caused by the departure of left wing Mike Lloyd with a dislocated thumb. That was in the 80th minute and a second try to Wintle on the final whistle was rather flattering.\n\nLlanelli, captained by ex-Wales skipper Phil Davies and with two other caps in Simon Davies and Phil May, certainly had enough experience and talent to have fashioned a handsome win.\n\nBut they reckoned without the spirit and teamwork of the Bath pack, well led by veteran back row Nick Maslen. Two rolling mauls yielded first-half tries for prop Darren Crompton and No 8 Eric Peters and flanker Gareth Adams was devastating throughout.\n\nLlanelli, huffing and puffing to no real effect, had to make do with a try by Colin Stephens and found themselves 19-5 down soon after half-time. Bath should have been out of sight but wing Alex Tupman spurned a clear chance and, just as importantly, fly-half Craig Raymond missed two simple penalties.\n\nScorers: 23 mins – Crompton try, Raymond conv, nil-7; 34 mins – Stephens try, 5-7; 39 mins – Peters try, 5-12; 53 mins – Atkins\n\ntry, Raymond conv, 5-19; 60 mins – Thomas try, 10-19; 69 mins – Wintle try, Stephens conv, 17-19; 80 mins – Simon Davies try, 22-19; 83 mins – Wintle try, 27-19.\n\nLlanelli: Ian W Jones; Thomas, S Davies, Wintle, Evans; Stephens, Harries; Joseph, Young, John, May, P Jones, P Pook, P Davies, G Jones.\n\nBath: Stuart; Tupman, Fox, Webber, Lloyd (rep Long, 81 mins); Raymond, Sanders; Hilton, Atkins, Crompton, Haag, McCoy, Adams, Maslen, Peters.\n\nReferee: Ken Brackstone (WRU)\n\n19/10/1993\n\nv Oxford University, Away.

Weather – Frosty.\n\nA cold evening game in which the forwards, particularly Peters and Adams played well. Lumsden was all over the place.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH coach Jack Rowell is hopping mad over the way representative demands are wrecking the club programme.\n\nRowell has always been resigned to his top players being required for divisional duties. What he objects to is his reserve team being raided to fill the South West replacements’ bench. “They are bleeding us dry,” he said. “It’s getting to the stage where I don’t know if we will be able to field a side to play Nottingham on Saturday.”\n\nHe has a point. Of the side who achieved a comfortable win at Iffley Road last night, fly-half Mike Catt and forwards Darren Crompton and Gareth Adams will be on the bench at Gloucester with two other clubmates, Martin Haag and Marcus Olsen.\n\nSo Bath will attempt to pick a side knowing that some two dozen players are not available, either with the South West, resting or injured.\n\nBut Crompton, recently named as England Under-21 captain, feels that he and other up-and-coming players have benefited from being handed a “mission impossible” such as the trip to Llanelli last Friday and last night’s fixture against the students.\n\n“It’s done us good to be thrown in at the deep end,” said the burly tighthead. “There is a tremendous spirit and we’ve had to learn quickly,” added Crompton who enjoyed a rare old tussle with the University’s own Bath representative, Chris Clark.\n\nOnce Audley Lumsden, an ex-Blue, had opened the scoring with a try converted by Catt and the fly-half had added a penalty on the stroke of half-time, Bath seemed fully in control.\n\nBut the students, who had not even ventured into the visitors’ 22 in the first half, were a different side after the break, galvanised by some powerful running in the centre from Ed Rayner.\n\nHis break led to a try by left wing Gary Allison and Canadian fly-half Gareth Rees, who turned out for Wasps against Bath in the 1985 John Player Cup final, added a penalty.\n\nHowever, a timely interception try by left wing Mike Lloyd, his first for the club, quelled the comeback and two more penalties from Catt reasserted Bath’s control.\n\nScorers: 8 mins – Lumsden try, Catt conv, nil-8; 39 mins – Catt pen, nil-10; 42 mins – Allison try, 5-10; 49 mins – Rees pen, 8-10; 68 mins – Lloyd try, 8-15; 75 mins – Catt pen, 8-18; 82 mins – Catt pen, 8-21.\n\nOxford University: Joy; Dickinson, Boyle, Rayner, Allison; Rees, du Toit; Clark, Cooper (rep Henderson, 40 mins), Fennell, Daniell, Coveney, Ritchie, Aitken, Martin.\n\nBath: Lumsden; Stuart, Fox, Webber, Lloyd; Catt, Sanders; Hilton, Beddow, Crompton, McCoy, Crane, Adams, Peters, Maslen.\n\nReferee: Richard Bullock (Leicestershire Soc)\n\n23/10/1993\n\nv Nottingham, Home.

Nottingham’s backs more useful than their position would suggest, particularly the full back Gallagher. Outstanding players for Bath were Egerton on his return and Raymond.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nAMID all the concern about the burn-out risk to a world-class performer like Ben Clarke, it is often forgotten that Bath have another pedigree No 8 in their stable.\n\nEx-international David Egerton could not have given a more dramatic reminder of his value to the champions. He scored four of the 16 tries in this extraordinary game whose points aggregate was 111, a record at the Recreation Ground.\n\nEgerton would walk into most other First Division sides but has politely rejected approaches.\n\n“I’m 31 now and perhaps it’s too late for such an upheaval,” he said. “I enjoy playing at Bath and don’t see why I should switch clubs now.\n\n“It’s exciting to see the new generation of players coming through. I was very impressed with Eric Peters, even though he was playing out of position on the open side.”\n\nBut it was Egerton who caught the eye and not just for the scoring ability which has brought him a highly respectable 67 tries in 155 senior appearances.\n\nIt is the less spectacular but equally valuable work that has earned the admiration of teammates over the years – deft touches at the back of the scrum, the all-enveloping tackle and the priceless knack of stealing possession when the opposition seem certain to score.\n\nSlick combination with Peters and Mark Crane off the back of a scrum set things in motion and Egerton had two more in the next 20 minutes as Bath cruised into a 29-10 lead in even time.\n\nYet Nottingham were far from annihilated, finishing with five tries themselves – and no team has managed that at the Rec in recent times. Full-back Matt Gallagher, with a try, a dropped goal and three conversions in only his fifth first-team game, certainly marked himself out as a player of great potential.\n\nBut, if Bath’s defensive work was occasionally slip-shod, they held the whip hand up front and were racking up the scores at a point a minute. Left wing Mike Lloyd powered through for two as did lock Mark Crane, if at a more measured pace.\n\nAudley Lumsden, supplying the finesse in the back-line, profited from nicely-judged passes by fly-half Craig Raymond and Andy Webber. The final tries fell to the other young centre, Danny Fox, and scrum-half Ian Sanders.\n\nSCORERS: 6 mins – Egerton try, Raymond conv, 7-nil; 8 mins – Lloyd try, Raymond conv, 14-nil; 13 mins – Royer try, Gallagher conv, 14-7; 16 mins – Raymond pen, 17-7; 21 mins – Gallagher dropped goal, 17-10; 23 mins – Egerton try, Raymond conv, 24-10; 27 mins – Egerton try, 29-10; 30 mins – Gallagher try and conv, 29-17; 33 mins – Raymond pen, 32-17; 35 mins – Lloyd try, Raymond conv, 39-17 (H-T); 42 mins – Crane try, Raymond conv, 46-17; 45 mins – West try, 46-22; 47 mins – Lumsden try. 51-22; 50 mins – Gray try, Gallagher conv, 51-29; 55 mins – Egerton try, Raymond conv, 58-29; 60 mins – Crane try, Raymond conv, 65-29; 63 mins – Fox try, Raymond conv, 72-29; 71 mins – Smallwood try, 72-34; 78 mins – Sanders try, 77-34.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Stuart, Fox, Webber, Lloyd; Raymond, Sanders; Hilton, Beddow, Chilcott, Crane, McCoy, Peters, Egerton, Maslen.\n\nNOTTINGHAM: Gallagher; Smallwood, Furley, Jones, Byrom; Musto, Royer; Jackson, West, Hallam, Gray, Robinson, Morris, Metcalf, Berry.\n\nREFEREE: Tony Spreadbury (Somerset Soc).\n\n30/10/1993\n\nv Loughborough Students, Home.

Replacements – Deane, Clayton-Hibbert Ground – Good. Weather – Cold but dry.\n\nA Scrappy, rather unskilled contest belied by the score. Adams and Peters played well.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBRITISH Lion Andy Reed finally decided against testing out his damaged knee and Wayne Davies came in for his third game for the first XV.\n\nThe one bright spot of a listless game was Craig Raymond, 24 year old policeman and Bath stand off who claimed 23 points with four conversions, four penalty goals and a dropped goal. His last season’s tally in 12 games was nine conversions and five penalties.\n\nAfter a 25 minutes pre-match workout the Students looked impressively fit but they were soon on the defence as Tony Swift playing his first game since going off early against Orrell four weeks ago with a hamstring injury, forced the pace in an attack which ended with a penalty taken successfully by Raymond.\n\nThen Bath’s first try came from Danny Fox played at left centre, and this was converted by Raymond.\n\nSteve Dyer kicked a penalty goal for Loughborough when Bath were penalised for being offside but at the time Raymond had already added a further three points when Loughborough were penalised on the 32nd minute he notched up another penalty.\n\nBath, however, failed to open up the game and seemed short of options at half back. The fire of last week, in the lineout, was missing and there was none of the backrow cohesion.\n\nPeters and Adams, however, had good spells but generally it was a dour performance largely because of the Students scrum tactics.\n\nSecond half scores were Craig Raymond who kicked a penalty after ten minutes and kicked an immaculate dropped goal a few minutes later. Then Rob Stuart scored on the left wing for Bath but there was no conversion.\n\nAfter some determined mauls Darren Crompton scored and Raymond converted and then Ian Sanders got over for a try which Raymond again converted as he did the try which followed by Dave Hilton.\n\nIn the dying moments the Students left centre, M Allen scored wide out the conversion failing.\n\nDespite the glut of points there was little to cheer about on this performance. Gareth Adams needed attention and left the field for a gash on his forehead and Mark Crane replaced him until his return a few moments later.\n\nBath: J Bamsey, T Swift, A Webber, M Fox, R Stuart, C Raymond, I Sanders, D Hilton, C Atkins, D Crompton, N Maslen (captain), W Davis, E Peters, D Egerton, G, Adams.\n\nLoughborough Students: N Stork, S Dyer, J Bell, M Allen, M Dawson, G Williams, R Stone, G Reynolds (captain) C Claydon, C Senabuyla, S Mellalieu, C Quinnell, D Rouse, P Atkinson, C Davies.\n\nAttendance: 1,500.\n\n6/11/1993\n\nv South African Barbarians, Home.

Weather – Cold and overcast.\n\nA tough and bruising battle, Bath’s scratch team being well beaten by a rough and uncompromising SA side. Van der Linde sent off.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nJEREMY Guscott collected four stitches in an eye wound on his return to first team rugby but flies out to Paris tomorrow with an even stiffer test in prospect.\n\nThe Lions centre guests for the French Barbarians against the Australians on Thursday, intending to prove beyond all doubt to the England management that he is ready to face New Zealand at the end of the month.\n\nRestricted to just two senior appearances this season because of a groin injury, Guscott almost came through unscathed against the South African tourists, the first side to win at the Rec since April.\n\nBut in a vain attempt to prevent a 51st minute score by opposite number Christiaan Scholtz, a trailing boot caught him in the face, forcing him off the field for four minutes for running repairs.\n\n“Just a few stitches,” he said. “Nothing serious really – and the other injury has cleared up well.”\n\nAnother wounded Lion making a reappearance was lock Andy Reed but perhaps too late to persuade the Scottish selectors his knee problems have cleared up in time for him to be included against the All Blacks on Saturday week.\n\nIt was no gentle reintroduction either. The South Africans completed their eight-match tour with a 100 per cent record but their abrasive approach inevitably resulted in the dismissal of prop `Toks’ van der Linde in the 74th minute.\n\nHe had apparently stamped on Dave Hilton’s head, but the most persistent offender was flanker Andrew Blakeway who was severely cautioned for splitting Martin Haag’s face with a punch. Even wing Tony Swift sported a rare black eye afterwards.\n\nAlthough Ben Clarke filled in at short notice for tonsillitis victim Eric Peters, a makeshift Bath side found the tourists too much of a handful. Their strong-running backs created an early try for Pieter Hendricks, capped this year by South Africa, and the other wing Francois Naude jinked over on the half hour.\n\nCraig Raymond kept the home side in touch with three penalties but skipper Rudolf Straueli wheeled through some weak tackling for the third try and Scholtz’s effort put the result beyond doubt.\n\nSwift cut through expertly from the tapped penalty following van der Linde’s dismissal and Clarke rolled off a maul for the second try only for Gavin Lawless’s injury time penalty to end matters on a more upbeat note for the tourists.\n\nScorers: 8 mins – Hendriks try, Jannie de Beer conv, nil-7; 11 mins – Raymond pen, 3-7; 20 mins – de Beer pen, 3-10; 26 mins – Raymond pen, 6-10; 30 mins – Naude try, de Beer conv, 6-17; 37 mins – Raymond pen, 9-17 (H-T); 44 mins – Straueli try, de Beer conv, 9-24; 51 mins – Scholtz try, de Beer conv, 9-31; 74 mins – Swift try, Raymond conv, 16-31; 78 mins – Clarke try, Raymond conv, 23-31; 82 mins – Gavin Lawless pen, 23-34.\n\nBath: Lumsden; Swift, Bamsey, Guscott, Lloyd; Raymond, Hill; Hilton, Beddow, Chilcott, Haag, Reed, Adams, Egerton, Clarke.\n\nSouth African Barbarians: Lawless; Naude, Scholtz, Mulder, Hendriks; de Beer (rep Muir, 65 mins), Roux; van der Linde, Roberts, Garvey, Opperman, Schutte, Straueli, Lotter, Blakeway.\n\nReferee: Matt Bayliss (Gloucester).\n\n9/11/1993\n\nv Combined Services, Home.

Ground – Slippery. Weather – Wettish.\n\nA really dire display by Bath in which a Combined Services team ran rings round everyone. Bath’s experienced pack were particularly disappointing.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTHREE Bristol players enjoyed the rare treat of victory at the Recreation Ground as Bath surrendered to the servicemen.\n\nWing Stuart Crossland scored the conclusive try and back row men Chris Moore and Rob Armstrong did as much as anyone to nullify the home pack.\n\nArmstrong, the muscular Royal Marine, proved the main obstacle as Bath tried in vain to batter beyond the gain line.\n\n“They played into our hands,” he said. “Tackling is my sort of game. At least it gave us plenty of practice for our game with the All Blacks next month.”\n\nMany of the same Bath players had performed heroically at Llanelli recently but this time the performance was woeful and stand-in fly-half Jon Bamsey was off-target with all but one of his five kicks.\n\nArmstrong and fellow flanker Steve Berryman made the initial thrust for the opening try, finished off by centre Dave Sibson and converted by fly-half Ashley Johnson.\n\nBurly left wing Mike Lloyd was Bath’s most potent weapon and it was one of his bullocking runs that led to Bamsey’s sole success, but Johnson replied almost immediately to leave the score 10-3 at half-time.\n\nAlthough the servicemen conceded a string of penalties themselves, Bamsey failed to convert those opportunities and appeared unhappy in the position where he once earned an England Colts cap.\n\nLacking penetration both up front and behind the scrum, Bath looked vulnerable in defence too. Crossland’s try came five minutes into the second half after Berryman broke a tackle in midfield.\n\nIt was only when Johnson made it 20-3 with another penalty that the home side began to show any urgency. Even then a succession of tapped penalties foundered on determined tackling with Armstrong, as ever, holding the line.\n\nScorers: 14 mins – Sibson try, Johnson conv, nil-7; 22 mins – Bamsey pen, 3-7; 27 mins – Johnson pen, 3-10 (H-T); 45 mins – Crossland try, Johnson conv, 3-17; 49 mins – Johnson pen, 3-20.\n\nBath: Stuart (rep Haig, 62 mins); Sparkes, Fox, Webber, Lloyd; Bamsey, Sanders (rep S Johnson, 21 mins); Hilton, Beddow, Crompton, McCoy, Reed, Adams, Peters, Maslen.\n\nCombined Services: Lazenby; Bartliff, Sibson, Sharp, Crossland; Johnson, Worrall; Coughlan, Clay, Robson, Dahinton, Watson, Armstrong, Moore, Berryman.\n\nReferee: Keith Beaumont (Devon)\n\n13/11/1993\n\nv Newcastle Gosforth, Home.

Replacements – Hilton, Egerton, Sanders Ref – J Burtenshaw. Ground – Muddy and Slippery. Weather – WET!!\n\nBath coped very well in atrocious conditions and in fine weather would have put on many more points. This game was Chilcott’s last appearance on the Rec.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nA GARETH Chilcott conversion on his farewell appearance at the Rec provided a moment of light relief as Bath resumed the serious business of winning the league again.\n\nThe folk-hero forward, who celebrates his 37th birthday at Leicester on Saturday, plays his last game at Harlequins the week after.\n\nYet if the champions are still unbeaten when he hangs up his boots, then the title race could be virtually over before they have to replace him.\n\nQuins’ surprise win at Leicester has opened up a four-point gap and brought an even bigger smile to the face of Bath skipper John Hall. “That’s good news. It takes a little bit of the pressure off us,” he said.\n\nHall has played every weekend since the start of the season and admitted he had found it difficult to raise himself for this game. “I did feel a bit jaded to be honest. It will be quality rather than quantity in training this week though and the batteries will be recharged for Leicester.”\n\nNewcastle-Gosforth were never likely to threaten Bath’s 100 per cent record although North lock John Fowler posed problems in the line-out.\n\nMore disruptive was the incessant rain which made the handling so difficult that even as accomplished a player as Victor Ubogu spilled the ball three times.\n\nBut, after a penalty apiece to Jon Callard and Tom Willcox, the Bath pack surged through from Nigel Redman’s line-out take to earn a try for Ben Clarke. There should have been another score from a five-metre scrum but, inexplicably, Chilcott was penalised for lowering as their opponents slithered backwards.\n\nThe Geordies’ scrum was on the retreat for most of the game but they tackled ruggedly and scrapped for every bit of possession in the loose and consequently were not too fussy about giving away penalties.\n\nCallard landed three more kicks before half-time in addition to the conversion of Clarke’s score. Immediately after the restart, Richard Hill dived into the creaking Gosforth scrum for another try, converted by Callard who ended with a tidy 19 points.\n\nOnce the Bath forwards had got into their stride – Steve Ojomoh had an impressive game on his seasonal debut – it became a very one-sided affair.\n\nBut, with Jeremy Guscott again absent with his groin trouble and Phil de Glanville still not available, Bath lacked their customary poise in midfield.\n\nKicking therefore proved more productive than passing and after Callard’s fifth penalty had made it 29-3 a Stuart Barnes up-and-under produced a try for Jon Bamsey, converted memorably by Chilcott. It is the only successful place-kick of his career but, as Hall pointed out, he is now the only 100 per cent kicker in the First Division!\n\nOn the hour, Bath clicked impressively. Hooker Graham Dawe was the one to profit after a succession of rucks and some fine handling by Martin Haag in particular. The final score went to left wing Audley Lumsden on the blindside after the visitors had been shunted off their own heel.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: confident\n\nSCORERS: 9 mins – Callard pen, 3-nil; 15 mins – Willcox pen, 3-3; 19 mins – Clarke try, Callard conv, 10-3; 28 mins – Callard pen, 13-3; 37 mins – Callard pen, 16-3; 41 mins – Callard pen, 19-3 (H-T); 42 mins – Hill try, Callard conv, 26-3; 54 mins – Callard pen, 29-3; 57 mins – Bamsey try, Chilcott conv, 36-3; 60 mins – Dawe try, 41-3; 76 mins – Lumsden try, 46-3.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, Catt, Bamsey, Lumsden; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Ojomoh, Clarke, Hall.\n\nNEWCASTLE-GOSFORTH: Bennett; White, Beattie, Merritt, Penn; Willcox, Douglas; Fraser, Frankland, Vanzandvliet, Fowler, Archer, Chick (rep Clarkson, 27 mins), Arnold, Nicholson.\n\nREFEREE: John Burtenshaw (London).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – rain; pitch – muddy.\n\n20/11/1993\n\nv Leicester, Away.

Ground – A bit sticky. Weather – Cold.\n\nBath should have got this sewn up in the first half, but failed to take their chances. Leicester changed their game plan in the second half and narrowly deserved their win.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nSTUART Barnes is 31 today but as far as the rugby goes there’s not a lot to celebrate.\n\nNot only has he lost his England place to Rob Andrew but Leicester have taken Bath’s 100 per cent Courage League record with an 80th-minute penalty for which Barnes was held responsible.\n\nElation at charging down a Jez Harris dropped-goal attempt turned to despair when referee Jim Pearson whistled the fly-half up for offside and John Liley kicked the penalty.\n\nImprobably, the Bath maestro was given an injury-time chance to level the scores from 45 metres but the ball dipped under the bar. It was the last kick of the game.\n\n“I really thought that one was going over,” said Barnes after a trip to the treatment room to have 12 stitches behind his ear. “But it’s not been a very good week for me. Things often seem to go wrong around my birthday – even the electrics on my car froze this morning so my wife couldn’t get my present.\n\n“But things are more often good than bad at Bath. We’ve just got to be man about it and come back even stronger. Good luck to Leicester but they’ve got to come to us yet and with our points difference I reckon we’ve effectively got a three-point lead on the rest.”\n\nBy his own admission, Barnes did not have the best of games and a succession of missed touches allowed Leicester to raise a fair old head of steam in the last quarter.\n\nYet Bath won enough possession in the first half to have put the issue beyond doubt. Fatally, they seemed unable to find the higher gear that accelerates them into a different class at home on the Rec.\n\nFor all the dominance of the tight forwards in scrum and line-out – Nigel Redman was again outstanding – they missed the extra cutting edge of Ben Clarke in the loose. On a couple of occasions Victor Ubogu barrelled right through Neil Back in midfield but the Tigers’ defence regrouped in time.\n\nIt was scrappy stuff and in old adversaries Dean Richards and David Egerton each side had a man adept at denying opponents possession. When the ball did emerge it was so slow that the backs were confronted by a line of defenders.\n\nInjuries had forced a wholesale reshuffle of the Bath back line although Phil de Glanville’s return was a bonus. A half-fit Audley Lumsden shifted to fullback, giving Mike Lloyd a league debut on the left wing where he did give a glimpse of his running power.\n\nIn time Bath will use him more effectively but on Saturday the main tactic seemed to be Richard Hill’s box-kicks which, apart from forcing Barnes’s first penalty goal, met with varied success.\n\nThe longer the game went on without the champions achieving a significant breakthrough, the more likely it was that they would eventually find themselves on the defensive.\n\nSo it proved after they led by a mere 6-3 at half-time. Missed touches by Barnes and Gareth Chilcott, of all people, yielded a scrum in the Bath 22 from which Jez Harris dropped a goal to make it 6-6.\n\nRoared on by almost all the 14,000 capacity crowd, Leicester built up the pressure inexorably by employing that devil-child of the lawmakers, the driving maul. With someone like Dean Richards controlling the beast, it cannot be stopped legally and Bath began to look uncharacteristically desperate.\n\nThey dropped one maul after 70 minutes but Liley skewed an angled penalty chance. When Leicester set up a similar position ten minutes later, it was the backs who were penalised and Liley could not miss from in front of the posts.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: unambitious\n\nSCORERS: 3 mins – Liley pen, 3-nil; 7 mins – Barnes pen, 3-3; 25 mins – Barnes pen, 3-6; 59 mins – Harris dropped goal, 6-6; 80 mins – Liley pen, 9-6.\n\nLEICESTER: Liley; Hackney, Potter, R Underwood, T Underwood; Harris, Kardooni; Rowntree, Cockerill, Garforth, Johnson, Poole, Wells, Richards, Back.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Lloyd; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Egerton, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: Jim Pearson (Durham).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – dull, cold; pitch – good.\n\n26/11/1993\n\nv London Scottish, Home.

As half-time approached scrum-half Ian Sanders finished off a forward drive to give Bath a six-point interval lead.\n\nAs Andy Reed began to win some ball against his international teammates in the middle of the line-out, the home side established control up front.\n\nSparkes crossed for his first try six minutes into the second half and Catt’s conversion kick somehow found its target through the fog. The Exiles’ defence grew more desperate and Bath wasted a number of chances before Sparkes burst through for his second.\n\nWith another successful conversion, the score rose to 25-5 and although Steve Wichary replied with a penalty, the lively Sanders cashed in when his forwards drove a maul through the Scottish pack.\n\nSCORERS: 4 mins – Catt pen, 3-nil; 5 mins – Eriksson try, 3-5; 13 mins – Catt pen, 6-5; 37 mins – Sanders try, 11-5 (H-T); 46 mins – Sparkes try, Catt conv, 18-5; 59 mins – Sparkes try, Catt conv, 25-5; 64 mins – Catt try, 30-5; 66 mins – Wichary pen, 30-8; 69 mins – Sanders try, 35-8\n\nBATH: Long; Sparkes, Stuart, Fox (rep Johnson, 66 mins), Lloyd; Catt, Sanders; Crompton, Atkins, Mallett, Haag, Reed, Adams, Egerton, Maslen.\n\nLONDON SCOTTISH: Appleson; Wichary, Harrold, Eriksson, Dingwall; Walker, Troop; Burnell, Mair, Hillicks, Mackay, Cronin, Brown, Leckie (rep Robinson, 45 mins), Gray (rep Johnson, 32 mins).\n\nREFEREE: David Sainsbury (London Soc)\n\n4/12/1993\n\nv Harlequins, Away.

Bath not helped by lacking a number of first team players, including late withdrawal of Callard.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nHOW appropriate that Gareth Chilcott’s farewell performance should offer a timely reminder that that scrummaging still wins matches.\n\nThe only try of this Courage League One match came after seven minutes when the back row wheeled off a scrum to earn a touchdown for Andy Robinson.\n\nThe score was unconverted but Chilcott and Co never let up the pressure on the Quins eight, a fact the veteran prop emphasised with some satisfaction before going off “to burn my boots.”\n\n“At Bath we have never regarded the scrum as just a way of restarting the game,” he said. “It’s an attacking ploy which disrupts opponents and saps their strength.\n\n“Quins had four put-ins on our line and went back a couple of yards each time. At the end you could look in their eyes and see that they’d had enough,” he grinned.\n\nAll this was achieved without England hero Victor Ubogu, nursing an elbow injury, but John Mallett, one of the Emerging Players’ successes against the All Blacks recently, was a more than capable deputy on the tighthead.\n\nIf anything, the line-out work was even more impressive considering Quins had twice as many throw-ins and won less than 40 per cent of them. But they could point to the absence of key forwards in Alex Snow and Richard Langhorn as well as Will Carling.\n\nIf Bath had a problem it was in the threequarters where Tony Swift’s late withdrawal with hamstring trouble meant a league debut for 21-year-old student Robbie Stuart. Then England fullback Jon Callard decided in the dressing room that he had not recovered sufficiently from a virus so Audley Lumsden took over.\n\nMike Lloyd almost muscled his way over a couple of times but, with a makeshift back line and facing a defence as well organised as their own, it was always likely the issue would be decided by the packs and the kickers.\n\nTwo close-range penalties by full-back Kent Bray actually put the Londoners in front after 16 minutes but Stuart Barnes chipped over a similarly straightforward chance to give his side an 8-6 interval lead.\n\nBarnes had been in the wars, taking a bang on his left knee in tackling 17-stone back row Mark Russell and then aggravated the injury, falling awkwardly in Brian Moore’s tackle.\n\nBut the little man is nothing if not gutsy and he proceeded to give a superlative display of tactical and defensive kicking so that Quins were repulsed whenever they threatened to gain a toe-hold.\n\nAfter adding a second penalty from out on the left touch-line, he saw Bray again cut the deficit to two points but it was left to Mike Catt to land the third while Barnes was again receiving treatment.\n\nBray’s fourth successful kick came too late to give Quins a realistic chance of breaking the Bath hoodoo that has dogged them since leagues began in 1987.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: controlled\n\nSCORERS: 7 mins – Robinson try, nil-5; 12 mins – Bray pen, 3-5; 16 mins – Bray pen, 6-5; 32 mins – Barnes pen, 6-8 (H-T); 47 mins – Barnes pen, 6-11; 57 mins – Bray pen, 9-11; 62 mins – Catt pen, 9-14; 78 mins – Bray pen, 12-14.\n\nHARLEQUINS: Bray; O’Leary, Keyter, Thompson, Alexander; Challinor, Glenister; Hobley, Moore, Mullins, Coker, Dear, Russell, Sheasby, Pepper (rep D Thresher, 30 mins).\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Stuart, de Glanville, Catt, Lloyd; Barnes, Hill; Chilcott, Dawe, Mallett, Haag, Redman, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: Stuart Piercy (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – fine; pitch – good.\n\n11/12/1993\n\nv London Irish, Home.

An in-and-out game, not helped by a lot of niggles and some odd refereeing. Never really got up to full speed and stayed there. We should have won by miles.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH’S most capped player, Richard Hill, believes Ian Sanders has what it takes to succeed him as the champions’ scrum-half.\n\nHill, who retires at the end of the season, took a break on the replacements’ bench to see how the young Cornishman shaped up on his home league debut.\n\nEager to see his protege do well but not intending to give up that No 9 shirt just yet, Hill admitted to watching with mixed feelings.\n\n“I said to him in the dressing room `Have a good game but don’t go scoring four or five tries!’. That wouldn’t have been so good for me,” he laughed.\n\n“It wasn’t the ideal game because there wasn’t a lot of good ruck ball and we were pretty static at times, but he did well.”\n\nAlthough lacking Hill’s experience, Sanders is far more of a threat around the fringes, making the kind of darting breaks that his mentor made in his younger days. And he compared very favourably with his opposite number, 11 times-capped Rob Saunders.\n\nHill actually had the opportunity of a closer look in the last quarter, coming on in the centre for Jon Bamsey, and accepting a long pass from Sanders to score the final try in injury time.\n\nIt was by no means a vintage Bath performance but as an opportunity to blood the new generation of players such as Sanders, Darren Crompton and Gareth Adams, it represented a valuable investment.\n\nWith Stuart Barnes’s bruised knee forcing him to join the lengthening casualty list and others granted a well-earned rest, the league leaders began the game with less than half their first-choice line-up.\n\nAdams scavenged so effectively however, that Ben Clarke was able to roam increasingly freely. An early surge from a tapped free kick by the Lions back row star led to Mike Catt nipping over for the opening try, converted by Jon Callard.\n\nAnd Clarke launched the most spectacular move of the game some ten minutes later from a 22 drop-out. He took off with skipper John Hall and Victor Ubogu in support but the backs failed to finish it off and were forced into touch near the flag.\n\nNo matter, a leaping Pat McCoy stole the Irish line-out throw and, after a driving maul sucked in the defence, Sanders’ long pass allowed Bamsey and Audley Lumsden to release Mike Lloyd for a try on the left.\n\nThe only remaining scores of an occasionally niggly first half were penalties apiece for Mike Corcoran and Callard but at 15-3 Bath seemed well placed to step up a gear after the interval.\n\nThat was easier said than done although Lloyd, fast becoming the terrace supporters’ favourite, earned the loudest cheers for his strong running, so reminiscent of the fondly remembered Jim Fallon.\n\nThey had to wait until the 57th minute for the next try. Clarke swooped on a poor line-out tap to get behind the Irish defence and Phil de Glanville eventually finished off in the left corner, courtesy of an intelligent pass by Sanders.\n\nSo many sides just accept what’s coming to them at the Rec but the Irish responded spiritedly, answering a second Callard penalty with a try by skipper Paul Collins. Hill’s late try at least ensured Bath had the last word.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – two stars\n\nBATH FORM: disjointed\n\nSCORERS: 6 mins – Catt try, Callard conv, 7-nil; 19 mins – Lloyd try, 12-nil; 28 mins – Corcoran pen, 12-3; 33 mins – Callard pen, 15-3 (H-T); 57 mins – de Glanville try, 20-3; 63 mins – Callard pen, 23-3; 65 mins – Collins try, 23-8; 84 mins – Hill try, 28-8.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, Bamsey (rep Hill, 61 mins), de Glanville, Lloyd; Catt, Sanders; Crompton, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, McCoy, Adams, Clarke, Hall.\n\nLONDON IRISH: Hennessey; Corcoran, Geoghegan, Burns, Staples; Cobbe, Saunders; Donovan, Kellam, Halpin, Higgins, Domoni, Collins, Lambe (rep Verling, 43 mins), Jenkins.\n\nREFEREE: Steve Lander (Lancashire Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – blustery, cold; pitch – soft.\n\n18/12/1993\n\nv Wasps, Home.

Replacements – Atkins, Crompton, Hill Ref – B Campsall. Ground – Sticky & wet. Weather – Awful!\n\nA fast and furious cup tie – Wasps were never in it and Bath mastered the conditions far better. On to the fifth round!\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH’S unrivalled cup tradition is such that they happily blooded five players into the crackling atmosphere of this fourth round tie and it was hardly noticed.\n\nIt’s ten seasons since the first of seven Twickenham triumphs. Players and sponsors may come and go but Bath’s passionate attachment to knock-out rugby endures.\n\nJohn Hall, now skipper, is currently the only survivor from that first cup final win over Bristol but he was not in the least surprised at how easily players like try-scorer Ian Sanders slipped into the cup routine.\n\n“I’ve been reading all these things about Bath being under pressure, with so many players out,” he said. “It’s rather foolhardy to dismiss us like that, especially here where we are so difficult to beat.\n\n“We’re a good cup side; we’ve proved that over the last ten years and we are looking to put our name on it again.\n\n“Even if some of the players have not experienced anything like this before, they have played in league matches and it’s all credit to the coaching staff and the players themselves that they can slot in so that it causes very little disruption.”\n\nWasps came a cropper at the Rec ten years ago at the quarter-final stage. For all the brave noises from that direction and doubts about Bath’s ability to maintain a cup challenge on top of their league superiority, this victory was utterly conclusive.\n\nTouted as a match-winner, Lions fly-half Rob Andrew had a stinker. He did kick a second minute penalty after being late-tackled by England colleague Victor Ubogu and dropped a goal but the rest of his game gradually fell apart before he had to be helped off following a collision.\n\nBath were never headed once the excellent Mike Catt had squeezed in at the corner after his forwards had capitalised on a line-out drive to set up a ruck under the posts. Quick passing did the rest.\n\nIn the 22nd minute, Ben Clarke charged on to a quick free-kick tap from Sanders and although the big No 8 was held on the line, the scrum-half nipped through a gap carelessly left by the Wasps back row. Callard made his second conversion but both he and Andrew missed penalties before the interval and it took a fine tackle by Wasps skipper Dean Ryan to deny Catt a second try.\n\nBath then edged into a 17-6 lead in the first minute of the second half with a Barnes dropped goal which owed as much to Graham Dawe’s alertness in getting out of the way as to the fly-half’s kicking skills.\n\nWasps’ pedigree as one of English rugby’s premier sides cannot be argued but they have no-one like Clarke or Ubogu, able to make those all-important dents in the opposition’s armour.\n\nAnd it was Ubogu whose surge led to the third try, marvellously crafted by Barnes and Catt, who glided into space to send Audley Lumsden over. It was a remarkable score considering the conditions.\n\nHuw Davies skipped away for a consolation try five minutes from time but Bath were never in danger of being caught. In this mood there are not many sides who will be able to interrupt their smooth progress to Twickenham for the eighth time in ten years.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nBATH FORM: dominant\n\nSCORERS: 2 mins – Andrew pen, nil-3; 12 mins – Catt try, Callard conv, 7-3; 16 mins – Andrew dropped goal, 7-6; 22 mins – Sanders try, Callard conv, 14-6 (H-T); 41 mins – Barnes dropped goal, 17-6; 70 mins – Lumsden try, Callard conv, 24-6; 75 mins – Davies try, 24-11.\n\nBATH: Callard; Lumsden, de Glanville, Catt, Lloyd; Barnes, Sanders; Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, McCoy, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nWASPS: P Hopley; Wedderburn, Childs, Davies, Hunter; Andrew (rep Wright, 64 mins), Bates; Holmes, Dunn, Probyn, Kinsey, Shortland, Greenwood, Ryan, Wilkins.\n\nREFEREE: Brian Campsall (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – blustery, raining; pitch – heavy.\n\n22/12/1993\n\nv Toulouse, Home.

Weather – Cold & blowy.\n\nAfter a bright start, the almost third string Bath team, a lot of youngsters, found it difficult to cope with the more organised and stronger Frenchmen.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nBATH fielded far too weak a side to trouble Toulouse but may send the stars to France next September to show who is really boss.\n\nPressure of domestic competition has made it increasingly difficult\n\nfor England’s champion club to maintain contacts with continental and overseas opposition even though Jack Rowell has always seen it as an essential part of his players’ education.\n\nBut the first Saturday of next season may be the ideal opportunity for several days’ high-quality training and a rematch with a side who embody the true spirit of French rugby. Discussions are under way.\n\nThere were barely 2,000 at the Recreation Ground for the clubs’ fifth meeting in seven seasons yet they were privileged to witness a virtuoso performance by centre Christophe Deylaud.\n\nIf the French selectors can so easily discard such a player after three caps against Argentina and South Africa last year, their reserves of talent must be boundless.\n\nAn eccentric goalkicking style brought him two penalty goals but it was his perfectly-balanced running and handling on a sticky and unforgiving pitch that marked him out from the rest.\n\nThe teams were level at 6-6 when Deylaud combined sweetly with fullback Hugo Mola just after half-time to send fellow centre Olivier Carbonneau in for a try at the right corner.\n\nFour minutes later he grabbed a second after fullback Audley Lumsden, entering a little too rashly into the spirit of the occasion, had a pass intercepted by Deylaud on the Bath 22.\n\nAs Toulouse embarked on a string of substitutions their close-passing game which had proved so effective in the first hour faded away and the game became disappointingly scrappy. Flanker Steve Ojomoh repeatedly battered into the midfield defences but all Bath had to show for their efforts was another Long penalty.\n\nRichard Hill, captaining the side from scrum-half, probed and chivvied but there was little wrong with the Frenchmen’s defensive technique against a makeshift Bath backline in which Oxford University centre Ed Rayner guested.\n\nThe Carbonneau family monopoly on try-scoring continued with a late try for brother Philippe at scrum-half as his strong-scrummaging forwards shunted the Bath eight over the line.\n\nSCORERS: 2 mins – Andy Webber pen, 3-nil; 16 mins – Deylaud pen, 3-3; 23 mins – Long pen, 6-3; 38 mins – Deylaud pen, 6-6 (H-T); 44 mins – Olivier Carbonneau try, 6-11; 48 mins – Olivier Carbonneau try, 6-16; 58 mins – Long pen, 9-16; 72 mins – Philippe Carbonneau try, Mola conv, 9-23.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Lloyd, Long, Rayner, Woodman; Webber, Hill; Hilton, Atkins, Crompton, Yandell, McCoy, Ojomoh, Peters, Maslen.\n\nTOULOUSE: Mola; Legrand, Deylaud (rep Barre, 72 mins), O Carbonneau (rep Darricarrere, 55 mins), Woodman; Castaignede, P Carbonneau; Diniz (rep Pueyo, 51 mins), Lasserre (rep Guiter, 40 mins), Califano, Miorin, Cadieu (rep Foltrand, 40 mins), Cester, Cigagna, Sonnes (rep Lacroix, 64 mins).\n\nREFEREE: Ashley Reay (Somerset).\n\n30/12/1993\n\nv Cardiff, Home.

Great spirit from both teams and much skill despite really revolting conditions. Roll on the Anglo-Welsh!\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTHIS mudlark proved you do not need perfect conditions and two star-studded teams to guarantee an entertaining rugby match.\n\nWith virtually all the big names absent for one reason or another and the Recreation Ground pitch glistening with liquid mud, the prospects were not too promising.\n\nBut, as Bath coach Jack Rowell pointed out: “There is something magical about the Bath-Cardiff fixture.\n\n“I had my doubts when I saw the weather in the morning but the quality of rugby was extraordinary and Cardiff could well have snatched it at the end.”\n\nBy that stage, however, both sets of forwards were unrecognisable even after the home side had donned a fresh set of jerseys at half-time.\n\nBath were indebted to fly-half Mike Catt who turned up at short notice demanding to play and was slotted in when Adedayo Adebayo’s train was late. Catt’s defensive display in the last quarter was of the highest order, as much for his tackling as his kicking.\n\nAfter Bristol University student Chris John opened the scoring with a penalty, Bath racked up 19 points in 13 minutes to take control.\n\nFirst try went to right wing Mark Woodman, a man who has made quite an impact since his arrival from Devon junior club Crediton. And prop Dave Hilton slithered over for the next score after Eric Peters’ pick-up and drive had been taken on by Martin Haag.\n\nCatt’s perfect kick to the corner flag set up another for tighthead Darren Crompton, who burrowed over after Haag had made a two-handed catch at the line-out. The fly-half finished off what he had started by improbably heaving the conversion kick out of the mud near the touchline and between the posts.\n\nSkipper Andy Moore went over at periscope level for the Welshmen in first-half injury time for a try converted by John who then added a penalty immediately after the interval.\n\nAnd even though centre Ed Rayner swooped on a loose ball to extend Bath’s lead to 24-13, wing Steven John dived over in the left corner and Chris John converted to keep Cardiff in touch.\n\nThe appalling conditions might have rendered the last ten minutes absolutely farcical had it not been for the remarkable skill and endeavour of both teams.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – three stars\n\nSCORERS: 3 mins – Chris John pen, nil-3; 11 mins – Woodman try, 5-3; 16 mins – Hilton try, Catt conv, 12-3; 24 mins – Crompton try, Catt conv, 19-3; 43 mins – Moore try, Chris John conv, 19-10 (H-T); 45 mins – Chris John pen, 19-13; 48 mins – Rayner try, 24-13; 64 mins – Steven John try, Chris John conv, 24-20.\n\nBATH: Long; Woodman, Webber, Rayner, Lloyd; Catt, Hill; Hilton, Atkins, Crompton, Haag, Yandell (rep Matthews, 54 mins), Adams, Peters, Maslen.\n\nCARDIFF: Davies; Hurford, Price, Laity, S John; C John, Moore; Lewis (rep Johnson, 36 mins), Bevan, Matthews, Wakeford, Roy, Mills, Agar, Bennett.\n\nREFEREE: Arthur Savage (Telford).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – rain; pitch – very heavy.\n\n8/1/1994\n\nv Bristol, Home.

It was a dour struggle, played on a glue-pot of a pitch. Bath showed more flair, Bristol forwards acted better in the going. A close run thing.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nThe Recreation Ground remains unbreached, but Bristol will return there in 12 days time convinced that cracks are beginning to appear in the ramparts of Fortress Bath.\n\nThanks to a massive performance from their tight forwards, who really could not have done any more to force a watershed victory in the first part of this epic New Year double-header, the visitors drove back down the A4 with their self belief in tact.\n\nCynics might say that Bath will not be caught cold a second time when Pilkington Cup day arrives, that given a dry surface their diamond edged midfield will run the visitors ragged.\n\nThey might also express the view that if Bristol cannot win with the amount of ball they hoovered up on Saturday, they never will.\n\nBristol, though, will look at things more optimistically. If they can get an extra 20 per cent from their backs and, crucially kick their goals, there is still a chance of glory.\n\n“Perhaps we were too predictable outside and took a couple of wrong options,” admitted skipper Derek Eves. “Too often, our final pass let us down as well. “But we beat them up front – Alan Sharp’s scrummaging was magnificent – and I would say that they are more worried about us now than we are about them.”\n\nHeavy underfoot conditions ensured that the game never touched any great heights, although Bristol’s insistence that the surface was eminently playable was borne out by events. There were, however, some passages of real excitement.\n\nBath’s withering pace and adventure in midfield lit up a dank afternoon; Mike Catt’s contribution in attack was of the highest calibre and only some tremendous last ditch tackling by Bristol’s back three kept the ship afloat.\n\nBut the real tension came in the final quarter. Bath’s front five had been creaking throughout and now, under a sustained onslaught at the set piece, they fell apart.\n\nTime and again Sharp, David Hinkins and the wonderfully athletic Simon Shaw battered their way up field to allow Eves the sort of space he thrives on.\n\nAt times, it seemed that Ben Clarke was playing Bristol on his own. Largely neutralised as an attacking threat, he still made a huge impact by strangling Bristol’s backline moves at birth. He really is some player.\n\nNevertheless, there were chances. Eves might have scored from a surging, churning maul with a little more self control while Alastair Saverimutto was twice thumped down inches from the line by the superb Catt.\n\nIt was a sweet combination of Clarke’s ball-winning and Catt’s dynamism that set up the last decisive Bath score a third confident pressure penalty from Jon Callard that finally put the champions a score plus in front.\n\nBristol had already felt hard done by on 17 minutes when Ralph Knibbs was harshly penalised for hanging on to the ball a split second too long at a ruck.\n\nAlthough Callard added a second goal just after the break, there was still a way back for the visitors. But after Catt’s raid down the right, Mark Tainton was astonished to be pulled up for an unlikely stamp on his own goal line. The three points were a formality.\n\nTainton did not enjoy the happiest of days, failing with three vital penalty shot. All of them were awkward and two went agonisingly close but if Bristol are to end the Bath jinx once and for all on Saturday week, those near misses will have to become surefire hits.\n\nBath form: determined.\n\nBristol form: encouraging.\n\nSCORERS: 17 mins – Callard pen, 3-nil (H-T); 47 mins – Callard pen, 6-nil; 74 mins – Callard pen, 9-nil.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Lloyd; Barnes, Sanders; Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, McCoy, Robinson, Clarke, Hall.\n\nBRISTOL: Hull; John, Saverimutto, Knibbs, Crossland; Tainton, Kitchin; Sharp, Regan, Hinkins, Shaw, Blackmore, Eves, Barrow, Armstrong.\n\nREFEREE: David Leslie (Scotland RFU).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – dark, cold; pitch – very heavy.\n\n15/1/1994\n\nv Northampton, Away.

Weather – Wet & windy\n\nNorthampton were never really in this one and Batch played a much sharper game than against Bristol last week. Barnes was outstanding. First game for Ojomoh and Reed for the 1st team for quite some time.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nWHAT difference a week makes! All that was wrong with the champions’ approach against Bristol was put to rights with a vengeance at Northampton.\n\nThe backs, for instance, rediscovered their sharpness to conjure stunning tries for Tony Swift – two more took his club total to 147 – and England centre Phil de Glanville.\n\nAnd the scrummaging, so heavily criticised after the derby match, improved to such an extent that Northampton conceded a penalty try by collapsing a 5-metre scrum.\n\nHowever, the vital ingredient identified by skipper John Hall was less tangible – passion. “We didn’t have it against Bristol but it was there today,” he said.\n\n“The atmosphere in the changing room was so different to what it was the previous week. We only had to remind ourselves of how badly we played the week before – and also of our defeat here last season.”\n\nThat score was settled so emphatically that the Saints suffered their heaviest home league defeat since returning to the top flight in 1990.\n\nUndoubtedly, they were caught unawares by the league leaders’ rip-roaring start which saw them run a penalty from their own half after six minutes, despite the slippery conditions.\n\nUsing Steve Ojomoh’s power and pace first to set up a ruck in midfield, Jon Callard was launched on a 40-metre into the Northampton 22 before being forced into touch.\n\nBath stole the line-out and Stuart Barnes orchestrated a bewildering midfield move involving a diagonal burst from the left wing by Adedayo Adebayo before Callard’s swivel sent Swift over on the right.\n\nThe England fullback converted and Saints skipper John Steele replied with a penalty before Bath forced another line-out near the home line. A careless tap left Matthew Dawson with no option but to concede the scrum and when marched back, Pearce and Co all too predictably hit the deck to concede seven points.\n\nThe score mounted to 19-3 by the 28th minute when Victor Ubogu peeled round a line-out and two quick rucks led to de Glanville stealing over in the corner. Steele and Callard exchanged penalties before the interval but as a chilling, heavy drizzle descended, those were the only scores until the last quarter.\n\nBath had 6ft 7in Andy Reed back in the side to challenge 6ft 10in fellow-Lion Martin Bayfield in the line-out. Yet Bayfield, for all the first touches he got to the ball, tapped so much rubbish to Dawson that it became a liability.\n\nA cannier and less courageous player would have washed his hands of it all but Dawson manfully did his best until a particularly reckless tap on the hour arrived at the same time as Graham Dawe and Ubogu. There was a three-minute break while the scrum-half was stretchered off to hospital for X-rays on his chest.\n\nAs at Bath back in September, when Northampton crashed 37-9, they had plenty of territorial possession but seldom looked like creating an opening. Barnes again kicked immaculately out of defence.\n\nFrustration on both sides made for fractious exchanges and lectures for Dawe, Baldwin and Reed but a third Steele penalty broke the spell. Callard replied from short range to maintain the 16-point advantage and just when it seemed the game was drifting to its close, Bath exploded from a scrum on their own 10-metre line.\n\nOjomoh took out the midfield defence and Hall flipped the ball up to Richard Hill who launched a move going right. De Glanville made the telling break before Catt and Barnes, with a speculative overhead lob from the wing, found Swift who juggled with the ball before racing over.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – 3 stars\n\nBATH FORM: commanding\n\nSCORERS: 7 mins – Swift try, Callard conv, nil-7; 11 mins – Steele pen, 3-14; 14 mins – Penalty try, Callard conv, 3-14; 28 mins – de Glanville try, 3-19; 30 mins – Steele pen, 6-19; 40 mins – Callard pen, 6-22 (H-T); 67 mins – Steele pen, 9-22; 68 mins – Callard pen, 9-25; 77 mins – Swift try, 9-30.\n\nNORTHAMPTON: Hunter; Morgan, Fletcher, Fielden, Beal; Steele, Dawson (rep Taylor, 60 mins); Baldwin, Clarke, Pearce, Phillips, Bayfield, Walton, Steffert, Millhouse.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Adebayo; Barnes, Hill; Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Reed, Ojomoh, Clarke, Hall.\n\nREFEREE: David Matthews (Liverpool).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – cold, heavy drizzle; pitch – sodden.\n\n22/1/1994\n\nv Bristol, Home. Won 14-9. Team:- Lumsden, Swift, de Glanville, Catt (T), Adebayo, Barnes (2c), Hill, Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Reed, Ojomoh (T), Hall, Clarke. Replacements – Beddow, Sanders, Hilton Ref – S Piercy. Ground – Cloggy. Weather – Fine\n\nA fairly typical Bath/Bristol cup match, with Bath showing their class only occasionally. Lumsden had excellent game in absence of Callard (hamstring), but the continued absence of Redman was crucial in getting a bettering in the set pieces.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nSTUART Barnes was, as usual, brutally honest in his summing-up of another desperately close Pilkington Cup derby that left Bristol shedding yet more tears of bitter frustration.\n\n“If you’d put our backs with their forwards, it would have been 50 points at least,” said the Bath fly-half. “That may be painful for Bristol to contemplate, but it’s true.\n\n“You have to feel sorry for their pack. Someone over there has to start asking a serious question or two. How can you win that amount of ball yet lose the game?”\n\nBarnes knows full well how it happened, of course. He was generally responsible for the odd lightning flash of creative genius that separated these two bitter rivals.\n\nDespite suffering a thoroughly embarrassing day with his goal kicking – he was lumbered with the job when hamstrung full-back Jon Callard cried off at the last minute – Barnes was at the heart of Bath’s one real purple patch. It lasted only eight minutes but it was enough to edge the favourites home in an absolute belter of a cup tie.\n\nSteve Ojomoh’s close range try – there was a hint of a knock-on by Richard Hill but referee Stewart Piercy missed it – gave Bath a seven point cushion agains the run of first half play.\n\nSuddenly, Bristol were under the cosh. The excellent Rob Kitchin produced a classic cover tackle to snuff out one bewildering move down the left but when Andy Reed produced rare clean ball from the resulting line-out, Barnes ripped into overdrive.\n\nHe sped between Derek Eves and Mark Tainton, unloaded to Phil de Glanville at precisely the right moment and Mike Catt raced over in imperious style. that very much appeared to be that.\n\nYet Bristol did almost everything right from then on. Andy Blackmore and a half-fit Simon Shaw were unstoppable at the line-out in front of England manager Geoff Cooke while Alan Sharp confirmed his international credentials with another mighty display that must have pleased Scottish selector Richie Dixon no end.\n\nAnd then there was Rob Armstrong, Bristol’s teak-hard blindside flanker. What a game he had. If there was a big tackle to make, a loose ball to sweep up or a drive to set in motion, the big Royal Marine was first to volunteer for duty.\n\nOn the back of this remarkable forward effort, Bristol slowly clawed their way back into contention. Their tactical kicking had been sound all afternoon and now Tainton was chipping over awkward penalties with real confidence.\n\nBack to within a score, Bristol knew the game was in the melting pot. One flicker of inspiration was all that was needed in that final, pulsating quarter.\n\nIt didn’t come. Ralph Knibbs was wide with a dropped goal attempt, Ojomoh hit Craig Barrow with the original ten-ton tackle to wreck a promising Bristol raid while Paul Hull and Stuart Crossland both broke free from deep but just failed to breach the last line of defence.\n\nHull had another dynamic game but he was matched, defensively at least, by the recalled Audley Lumsden. Bristol threw the kitchen sink at him, but never once did he look like faltering.\n\nIf anything Bath finished the stronger, battering away at the Bristol line as the clock ticked down. But they had been taken right to the wire and Bristol, beaten but unbowed, will fear them no more.\n\nENTERTAINMENT RATING – four stars\n\nBATH FORM: inconsistent\n\nBRISTOL FORM: courageous\n\nSCORERS: 24 mins – Ojomoh try, Barnes conv, 7-nil; 32 mins – Catt try, Barnes conv, 14-nil; 40 mins – Tainton pen, 14-3 (H-T); 41 mins – Tainton pen, 14-6; 53 mins – Tainton pen, 14-9.\n\nBATH: Lumsden; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Adebayo; Barnes, Hill; Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Reed, Ojomoh, Clarke, Hall.\n\nBRISTOL: Hull; John, Saverimutto, Knibbs, Crossland; Tainton, Kitchin; Sharp, Regan, Hinkins, Shaw, Blackmore, Armstrong, Barrow, Eves.\n\nREFEREE: Stewart Piercy (Yorkshire).\n\nCONDITIONS: pitch – soft, sandy; weather – fine.\n\nAttendance: 9,000-plus\n\nQUOTES:\n\nOne look at the relieved expression on the face of Bath skipper John Hall confirmed just how close Bristol had come to ending his dream of a league and cup double. “We expected a really tough game up front and that’s exactly what we got,” said the former England flanker. “Bristol must be one of the best line-out teams in the world. that’s no exaggeration. they could win ball against anyone.\n\n“Given quick, clean possession we were confident of scoring tries. But we did struggle for ball and we know we’ll have to improve on that aspect of our play if we’re going to win trophies this season.”\n\nHall would not be drawn on the burning selection debate at The Rec – the tussle between Steve Ojomoh and Andy Robinson for the openside flanker’s berth.\n\nOjomoh certainly contributed his quota of big hits and gave Bath an important extra option at the line-out. Yet the amount of ball Bristol secured on the floor\n\nsuggested that the home side missed Robinson’s relentless presence down there in the mud and bullets.\n\n“They’re very different players,” said Bristol’s Mark Tainton, who has faced both men inside a fortnight. “Ojomoh is very explosive but I felt I had more time today because he wasn’t in my face all afternoon like Robinson would have been. It’s a difficult choice between the two.”\n\nBristol coach Brian Hanlon paid a glowing tribute to his outstanding forwards but also singled out scrum-half Rob Kitchin for special praise.\n\n“When you consider how little Rob has played since getting injured back in September, that was a performance of real quality,” he said.\n\n“I would say we have the strongest bank of scrum halves in the country. We know Kyran Bracken is international class. Rob has that sort of potential, too.”\n\nSkipper Derek Eves, meanwhile, offered the simplest of summaries.\n\n“We were close to winning here two weeks ago and closer again today. It’s still not enough but the gap is nowhere near as wide as it was even a year ago. We’re getting there.”\n\n29/1/1994\n\nv Orrell, Home. Won 13-7. Team:- Callard (1c & 2p), Swift (T), de Glanville, Catt, Adebayo, Barnes, Hill, Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Reed, Robinson, Hall, Ojomoh. Replacements – Sanders, Beddow, Crompton Ref – E Morrison. Ground – Heavy & muddy. Weather – Drizzle\n\nA really awful game. Probably Bath’s worst performance this year. Lucky to get by, really.\n\nKevin Coughlan Match Report – Bristol Evening Post\n\nTHE Recreation Ground is such a gluepot these days that prolific wing Tony Swift reckons Bath would be better off playing away from home.\n\n“It’s impossible to play any rugby on our pitch,” he complained after snatching the try that saved the champions from an embarrassing defeat.\n\n“You just sink into the mud and end up relying on brawn and effort. It’s impossible to achieve the level of sophistication we aim for.\n\n“I’d honestly prefer to play away from home at the moment – even Gloucester,” added Swift, still poaching the tries although he is now nearer his 35th birthday than his 34th.\n\nThe latest – No 148 in 212 appearances for the champions – came as a huge relief, particularly after Swift had helped to gift international scrum-half Dewi Morris a shock try five minutes from half-time.\n\nWith typical tenacity, Morris charged down a clearance by Stuart Barnes; Swift only had to gather the ball and touch it down behind the try-line – but he fluffed it and Morris pounced.\n\nSimon Langford’s conversion made it 7-3 to Orrell at the interval and Bath could hardly argue with that. Apart from an early Jon Callard penalty, one scintillating break from deep involving ten passes and an outstanding all-round performance from centre Mike Catt, they had offered little.\n\nTime, then, for a few home truths from skipper John Hall. That seemed to have the desired effect on his forwards and a sustained assault led to a second Callard penalty.\n\nAnd if Stuart Barnes’s attacking skills had been blunted by the cloying mud, his defensive kicking was still of the highest order. One clearance from deep in his 22 found touch on the Orrell 10-metre line.\n\nBath were beginning to force the pace, finally getting Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh running at the midfield, but the clinching score came from a line-out deep in their own half on the hour.\n\nBarnes sent the hard-running Catt through a gap with a suspiciously forward pass and the move was taken on with such pace by centre partner Phil de Glanville, Chris Clark and Ojomoh that when the ball went loose, Swift merely had to hack through and dive on the ball.\n\nThat made amends for the earlier blunder and Andy Reed even began to turn the tables in the line-out, but there were no more scores despite Orrell’s tendency to give away penalties as their frustration boiled over.\n\nCallard missed two more kicks, finishing with a below-par strike rate of three from seven. This time however the culprit seemed to be the pitch rather than his dodgy hamstring.\n\nNext stop in the quest for a fourth successive Courage League title is Kingsholm on February 12 and the next home game is not until a month after that, with a visit from Wasps. Perhaps the Rec will have dried out by then.\n\nEntertainment rating – one star\n\nBATH FORM: unconvincing\n\nSCORERS: 7 mins – Callard pen, 3-nil; 35 mins – Morris try, Langford conv, 3-7 (H-T); 48 mins – Callard pen, 6-7; 60 mins – Swift try, Callard conv, 13-7.\n\nBATH: Callard; Swift, de Glanville, Catt, Adebayo; Barnes, Hill; Clark, Dawe, Ubogu, Haag, Reed, Robinson, Ojomoh, Hall.\n\nORRELL: Langford; Naylor, Wynn, Farr, Hamer; Taberner, Morris; Hynes, French, Southern, Cusani, Cooper, Manley, Hayter, Cleary.\n\nREFEREE: Ed Morrison (Bristol Soc).\n\nCONDITIONS: weather – drizzle; pitch – very sticky.\n\n4/2/1994\n\nv Newbridge, Home.
