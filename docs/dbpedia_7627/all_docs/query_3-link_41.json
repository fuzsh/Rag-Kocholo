Notoriously, Sandel, along with other communitarians, was charged with a failure to spell out the political implications of his philosophical views, […]\n\n84 Reviews\n\n41Frantz Fanon would have been seventy in the summer of 1995 and the volumes under review celebrate the anniversary of his birth. Most of the twenty-one contributions to the Critical Reader are papers delivered at the ʻFanon Todayʼ conference held at Purdue University in March 1995; the handsomely produced The Fact of Blackness originates in […]\n\n85 Reviews\n\nIn the Preface to The Politics of Time Peter Osborne claims that it comprises two books: ʻa book about the philosophy of time which grew out of a book about the culture of modernityʼ (p. x). The reason for this is that metaphysical questions about time and temporality inevitably confront anyone who inquires deeply enough […]\n\n86 Reviews\n\nKinds of Minds provides an introduction to, and reﬁnement of, the position Dennett has developed to increasing acclaim over nearly thirty years, and which is now sufﬁciently important to require engagement from those aligned with different philosophical traditions. For he deals with a crucial topic – the place of intentionality in a material world – […]\n\n87 Reviews\n\nPhilosophy of Mind is presently regarded as one of the most productive areas of comtemporary analytic philosophy. A number of recent introductory works (here those by Jackson and Braddon Mitchell, Crane, Kim and Rey) give us a chance to reﬂect on the dominant paradigms in terms of which the subject is taught. These texts display […]\n\n88 Reviews\n\nBack in the 1960s, Quentin Skinner started a little revolution in the study of political theory in Britain. Drawing on Wittgenstein and Austin, he attacked the whole idea that there could be monolithic cumulative progress in ʻpolitical scienceʼ. There was no ﬁxed set of political questions, he said – rights, the state, equality, and civil […]\n\n89 Reviews\n\nJane Gallop is an American academic whose writings on psychoanalysis, feminism and related topics are as dazzling in their intelligence as they are scintillating in their wit. Their humour is part of the thought processes embodied in her texts. A careful argument, proceeding by tentative steps, will ﬁnally reach an explosive and paradoxical conclusion, inducing […]\n\n90 Reviews\n\nReviews A gender lens to the centurySheila Rowbotham, A Century of Women: The History of Women in Britain and the United States, Viking, London and New York, 1997. xiv + 753 pp., £20.00 hb., 0 670 87420 5. The briefest reﬂection on the scale of this undertaking is enough to produce vertigo, induced not so […]\n\n91 Reviews\n\nMarxism has differed from most other bodies of radical political thought in its conviction that its political radicalism is inseparably connected to a philosophical radicalism – a conviction that underlies the name of this journal. Engels, Kautsky and the orthodox Soviet Marxists all saw Marxism as distinguished from mainstream (ʻbourgeoisʼ) social thought by the dialectical […]\n\n92 Reviews\n\nReviews In the Name of the FatherElisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan, translated by Barbara Bray, Polity Press, Cambridge, 1997. xix + 574 pp., £25.00 hb., 07456 1523 6.
