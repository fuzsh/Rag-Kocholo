        "text": "While the NWFL (formerly NTFL) currently consists of seven clubs playing seniors football, since its formation in 1987 17 clubs have been affiliated with the league including twelve in the inaugural year.\n\nThe league was formed by clubs from the former North West Football Union and Northern Tasmanian Football Association as a result of other member clubs choosing to join the fledgling State League (Mark I).\n\nMember clubs have been (from Tasmania’s north) Scottsdale, George Town, Longford, Deloraine, Launceston, South Launceston and North Launceston.\n\nCoastal clubs have been Smithton (now Circular Head Saints) , Burnie (Tigers and Dockers), South Burnie, East Devonport, Devonport, Latrobe, Ulverstone, Penguin and Wynyard.\n\nThe latter four clubs have been vital parts of the league for its entire 36 years of existence.\n\nThe following briefly outlines the involvement of all clubs which have been associated with the NWFL, which has long been recognised as Tasmania’s premier regional football competition.\n\nLatrobe: 1987 – 2023 37 years\n\nThe Demons (once aka Diehards) struggled somewhat in the early years.\n\nIt imported ‘ace’ players from Victoria as coaches, Terry Keays and Ashleigh Brown. But real success still eluded the club.\n\nAnd then along came ‘Ned’. Dale Perry arrived at the club and things began to happen.\n\nFuture Latrobe Mayor Peter Freshney was president and the club’s revitalisation began.\n\nThe class of the administration at the club is confirmed when it is noted it has hosted 32 (of the 37) NWFL Grand Finals, including the past 30 straight.\n\nIn the new era the Demons won four senior flags and lost two grand finals in seven years.\n\nThe Development won five, including three in a row from 2011 plus one in 1995 while the Colts have won a single flag, with the club also winning one Club Championship.\n\nBeginning with Darrel Baldock decades ago the club produced many champions on and off the field including Gavin Woodcock (one) and Josh Holland with (two) Baldock medals.\n\nIn the goals Mark Williams was king with 132 majors in 1989, Terry Keays booted 117, Stephen French twice won the goalkicking award as did Brodie Deverell, including 106.\n\nAdam Jeffrey and Ryan Keep (103) also led the tally, with Alex Diprose taking the award in 2022.\n\nThe Paddy Martin medal for best rep. game player has been won by Wayne Jaffray, Josh Holland and Rodney Coghlan. Simon McCall won the equivalent in an under age game with Dillon Goss in 2021 being awarded the Ian Wotherspoon medal for best player in the Colts rep. game.\n\nPeter Febey and Claye Sculthorpe took out the best first year senior player award, with Matthew Stephenson, Kurt Wells and Alex Diprose being adjudged Most Improved. Best in Grand Finals were James Wescombe, Holland, Coghlan and Shaun McCrossen.\n\nThe Development Best & Fairest has been won by Dean Smith and Adam Stevenson while Dane Williams took out the award an incredible three times.\n\nLeading goalkickers have been Simon Howard, Corey Lamprey and Peter Fulton (three times) while Nick Freeman, Matthew Sheahan, Nick Von Schill and Ben Blacklow have been best in grand finals.\n\nColts best and fairest winners are Mathew Dawkins, and Will Shearer, leading goalkickers Matthew Freshney and Mitchyl Hampson, with the best grand final player being Kurt Wells.\n\nIn 2017 the Latrobe side took out the first NWFL women’s flag with Danielle Dunstone and Brooke Brown sharing the best and fairest award that year as well as Danielle being best player in that year’s grand final. Kristy Harpley was the leading goalkicker in 2020, with Brooke Brown having won that award in 2017,\n\nOff-field, again the club has excelled.\n\nFive people have been acknowledged for their dedication – Rod Butler, Ivor Kirkwood, Brett Smith, Adam Jeffrey and Gavin Woodcock are league Life Members.\n\nNo less than 12 Demons have been inducted into the NWFL Hall of Fame: Brett Jaffray, Brett Smith, Stephen French, Leon Dawkins, Matthew Langmaid (+ another club), Dale Perry (+ another club), Matthew Stephenson (+ another club) Ian Broomhall, Wayne Jaffray, Josh Holland, Gavin Woodcock and Rod Walker.\n\nThe Patrons Service to Football award has gone to Rod Butler, Royce Viney (+ other service), Ian Broomhall, Ivor Kirkwood, Kaylene Dawkins, Rod Walker, Peter Freshney and Kate Perry.\n\nCertificates of Merit receivers are Bill Wickham, Leon Dawkins, ‘Alf’ Woodcock, Malcolm Wright, Malcolm Jackson, Gill Clarke and Kandice Blake.\n\nThe Queen/ Ambassador Quest has been won by Angela Broomhall, Stefani Bissett, Sarah Lewis with player Damon Cock taking the award in 2022 and in 2023 Grace Johnstone was a deserving winner, while Kate Ritchie, Belinda Dawkins and Kandice Blake have been honoured with the “Miss Fundraiser” award.\n\nIn its 37 years the NWFL has benefitted from the input of 11 Latrobe affiliated Board members.\n\nFoundation president (in the NWFL era) Julian Minton-Connell in two stints was there for six years as was Shane Greenwood.\n\nLatrobe has always been a strong, loyal member of the NWFL whose contribution to coastal football has been remarkable. The club’s normal policy has been to do what is best for football generally.\n\nThe manner in which it (assisted by the Latrobe Council) has hosted 32 grand finals is testament to the club’s culture and people.\n\nThe club has been recognised as a Tasmanian Hall of Fame “Great club” with “Legendary team” status also accorded it.\n\nThe Latrobe Demons, a proud, loyal, foundation member of the NWFL.\n\nUlverstone 1987 - 2023 37 years\n\nOver the 37 year journey undoubtedly the strongest club with on-field success unmatched is Ulverstone . Across the three male levels the club has won 37 out of 111 possible male premierships, or one in three.\n\nThat success includes five successive senior flags in the 1990’s, 11 consecutive Colts premierships from 1987, nine Development flags and 12 club championship awards.\n\nIn 2021 the Ulverstone NWFL Women’s team won its first premiership, as did the Youth Girls and boys’ under 12’s.\n\nThe women in 2022 again won the premiership, completing the season undefeated and finishing with a massive for/against percentage in excess of 900%\n\nJust two seniors ‘wooden spoons” are discreetly hidden away in the clubrooms.\n\nHowever that early success has diminished to a degree in the past 23 years with only two senior flags and two at Development level, while the Colts have taken out six, the last being in 2015, with two club championships.\n\nSuch was the strength of the seniors team in those early years (1987-97) that almost anyone could have coached them to a flag. Four individual coaches led the club to those first seven flags, including Max Brown with three.\n\nHow the wheel turns.\n\nReg Horton, Nathan Howard (2), Simon Walmsley, Scott Blair and Justin Hays were winners of the Darrel Baldock medal while Jamie Auton with 95 goals in 1997 is the only Robins player to win the leading goalkicker award at senior level.\n\nAuton that same year won the best first year player award which the following year was won by Josh Cox. Darren Crawford, Hamish Anderson, Jarrad Gale, Corey Dyson, Jacob Wiggers, Lliam Davies and Jesse Shepheard continued the club’s domination of that award.\n\nDavid Newitt, Luke Marshall, Nick Leedham, Shaun Knott and Luke Dyson all took out the most improved player award while Simon Walmsley and Jeremy Soden claimed the hallowed Paddy Martin medal for their rep. game performances.\n\nUlverstone’s domination of senior grand finals is confirmed with the best player medals going to Garth Barrett, Leigh Rawson (2), Simon Walmsley, Nathan Howard, David Orders, Adrian Siely, Troy Davies, Jarrad Gale and John Holland on the winners list.\n\nAt Development level Craig McCulloch, Tim Auton, Nick Hearn and Touray October were deemed best and fairest while the club’s domination of the under age is confirmed with Joe Pearson, Josh Cox, Rohan Gibson, Luke Dyson, Lliam Davies and Lleyton Connelly taking out the best player awards.\n\nOther Development players to earn accolades were Gary Howe (2), Grant Hearps, Daniel Gale, Matthew Turner, Tim Auton, Brodie Connelly, Shannon Abel, Nathan Applebee, Jacob Campbell, Shaun McCrossen and Oliver Depaoli-Kubank.\n\nOther Colts awards went to Troy Brooks who kicked 109 goals (phenomenal at that level) to win the 1991 goalkicking. Jason Stephens, Mark Singleton, Matthew Smedley, Haidyn Clarke, Jordan Kelly (2), Brodie Connelly, Bradley Gibson, Bryce Heazlewood and Troy Purton have also won that award including the latter four in consecutive years.\n\nBest in the Colts grand finals were Gillam Leary, Adam Holstrum, Haidyn Clarke, Waide Jones, Jordan Quaile, Lliam Davies and Harrison Barker while in rep. games the best player medal went to Brent Melhuish, Russell Yaxley, Ben Hilfenhaus (2) and Justin Clarke.\n\nIn 2017 Brooke Brown shared the NWFL Women’s best and fairest award as well as being the leading goalkicker in that competition’s first year.\n\nRuby Mitchell was the competition’s best and fairest winner in 2021, while best on ground in that year’s grand final was Candice Belbin. The League’s best 1st year player was Luka Starick.\n\nThe female Robins dominated the individual awards in their undefeated 2022 season.\n\nRuby Mitchell again won the best and fairest, leading goalkicker was Nikki Ellis with 36 while Lucy Thomson was adjudged best 1st year player, Most Valuable Player in representative games and best in the winning grand final side. A star in the making.\n\nSo that’s the list of player awards. One wonders what became of so many of those younger players who reached significant heights so early; similarly with other clubs.\n\nThe Robins have traditionally been a stronghold of junior footy; in 2023 the club fielded teams in all five levels of boys and girls competitions, finishing the roster season on top in three of the five.\n\nLife Membership of the NWFL has been awarded to the following stalwarts: Neil Rawson (plus other service), Wayne Wing (including many year’s service in the former NWFU), Ron Ansell and Andrew Richardson (plus other service).\n\nHall of Fame members are Les Toombs, Rex Bloom, Nathan Howard, Ron Ansell, Max Brown and Richardson with Eddie Atkinson, Ansell, Toombs, Wing, Dr Mark Heikkinen, Richardson and Doreen Leary also being recognised with Patron’s Service to football awards.\n\nMerit awards went to Dr Heikkinen, Bloom, Millie Walmsley, Wayne King, Lynn Brett, Kate Williams and Andrew Leary\n\nThe league’s Queen/Ambassador Quest winners was the inaugural one in 1987, Michelle Eaton, followed by Kathryn Orders, Tamika Costello and Hannah King.\n\nRon Ansell was the club’s NWFL Director for an incredible 15 years. Six others have filled the role in the ensuing 20 years, which has shown great stability in that area.\n\nThe club has been recognised as a Tasmanian Hall of Fame “Great club” with “Legendary team” status also accorded it.\n\nSo there’s a real success story.\n\nUnfortunately around 14 or so years ago the club encountered a real hurdle with people from both within and outside the club making a strong push for it to leave the NWFL and join the state league, aided and abetted by the hierarchy of that league.\n\nFortunately the pro NWFL lobby won but the club was seriously divided and it hurt.\n\nPeople like Ron Ansell, Wayne King, Doreen and Terry Leary and others got the Robins back on track, but the wounds took a long time to heal.\n\nThe Ulverstone Robins, a proud, loyal foundation member of the NWFL.\n\nPenguin 1987 – 2023 37 years\n\nThe Two Blues is the only club which has been affiliated with the league for its entire 37 years not to have won a senior flag or provided a Baldock medallist. But it’s been close!\n\nIt has played in four losing seniors grand finals with two of its three flags coming on the same day in 2017 when its Colts and Development both won premierships, with the Development again being victorious in 2021.\n\nIts past three (losing) grand finals have been by 3, 3 and 4 points!\n\nIts sole club championship came in 2011.\n\nFive seniors ‘wooden spoons’ have come the Two Blues way.\n\nBut the club has achieved a lot for a town of around 4,000 people.\n\nFrom the (by today’s standards) sub-standard ground and facilities in downtown Penguin to the new, world class stadium in the Dial Range foothills, the club has progressed; with strong leadership and a great culture it is on a sound footing.\n\nIt has had many individual players of note in the NWFL.\n\nWinners of the Paddy Martin rep game medal are Neville Keep, Brian Brett (2), Brad McDonald, Zac Mihocek with 2023 senior coach Luke Russell taking out the award that year.\n\nBest 1st Year senior player, Elijah Taylor and Jack Templeton.\n\nMost Improved, Grant Guard, Rodney King, Toby Skene and Jake Wray-McCann.\n\nIn an injury riddled 2021 season (for him) Jack Templeton became the first Penguin player to take out the leading goalkicker award, with 54 majors.\n\nTayla Marshall with 42 goals took out the equivalent women’s award that year.\n\nIn 2022 Joey Revell followed by Emilie Saward in 2023 were deemed the Women’s Most Improved Player.\n\nLeague Development best and fairest winners are Terry Duff, way back in 1987, Graeme Haywood, David Guard, Tim Bakes, Jed Dunham and Tyler Parker, while in the goalkicking Dan Laws, Kerry Jackson, Gary ‘Tom’ Clarke and Jake De Groot have taken the honours.\n\nNathan Russell was deemed best player in the Development 2017 premiership and Kallum Paul in 2019, while in 2021 it was Sam Mawer’s performance which saw him take out this coveted award.\n\nAt Colts level Randall Hardy, James King and Kallum Paul have taken out the best and fairest; Jack Templeton best in the 2009 rep game, while best in the 2017 grand final was Dylan Bramich.\n\nNo Penguin player has won the competition under age goalkicking award.\n\nThe Two Blues in 2023 fielded teams in all five levels of the junior competitions, which is an indication of the support there is for the game and the club in ‘tiny’ Penguin. Two teams reached grand finals, with one victorious.\n\nPenguin might not have achieved a lot on-field, but individually it certainly has.\n\nLife Members of the League are Bill Fielding (also for NWFU service), Brett Schulze (plus other service), another club legend Ted Howe, while Kim Miles was recognised in 2021 for his contribution (plus other service).\n\nThe Hall of Fame is where Penguin has excelled, with eight people included in that illustrious faculty.\n\nMatthew Smith, Kim Miles and Robbie Lavell (all with other service), Don Naden, Janine Naden, Garry Carpenter, Ted Howe and Brett Schulze have all earned that recognition.\n\nThe Patrons Service to Football award has gone to Fielding, Schulze, Miles and Wayne Turnbull.\n\nCertificates of Merit awardees – Bert Cragg, Earl Howard, Alma Carpenter, Victor Anderson, Pam Revell, Don Naden, Paul Murray and Lyn Brown.\n\nThe Queen Quest /Ambassador award has been won by Kim Fielding, Stuart Whiley and James King.\n\n15 people have been league directors, including foundation president Earl Howard (7 years) and his son-in-law, current NWFL President Garry Carpenter), also seven. Other than those two the turnover has been significant. Thankfully current president Brian Lane has been there for seven years to date.\n\nIn 2023 the club was rightfully recognised when it was inducted into the AFL Tasmania Hall of Fame as a ‘great club’.\n\nPenguin, a proud, loyal foundation club of the NWFL.\n\nDevonport: 2001-2008 2015 – 2023 17 years\n\nDevonport was in the state league at the time of the NWFL’s inception, where it won a flag in 1988, while on the same day the club across the Mersey River, East Devonport took out the NWFL premiership.\n\nIn 2001 the club joined the NWFL for eight years and like a few others were enticed back to the latest version of the state league in 2009, but returned to the NWFL in 2015 where it has remained happily, united and productively for the past nine years. Like the Burnie Dockers the club briefly, but unsuccessfully tried to compete simultaneously in both competitions.\n\nIf there is ever to be an example of a sporting body which has gone from rags to riches, both administratively and on-field, the Devonport Football Club would be a fine example.\n\nDevonport played in the 2004 grand final, going down to a rampant Burnie Dockers side by 107 points. In 2005 and 2006 grand final losses to the Dockers again occurred. This time round it played in the ultimate season ending game in 2019, 2020, again going down to its nemesis, those Burnie Dockers!\n\nThe club won the Club Championship in three consecutive years from 2005, following up in 2021,and took out the Development premiership in 2007, 2022 , 2023 and Under 18’s in 2018, 2021 and 2022.\n\nIt could be argued 2022 was the most successful season for the Magpies - ever!\n\nFor the first time in more than 100 years it won back-to-back seniors premierships and also for the first time, won all three flags on the same day.\n\nPlayers from the club had a significant impact in the 2022 individual awards, winning (or sharing victory) in seven categories. 2023 was no less than eight.\n\nIn 2023 the senior team dominated the competition, being undefeated throughout the roster season, losing the 2nd semi, only to regroup and reach the grand final, where the Magpies inflicted some sort of payback on those Dockers, winning the premiership by 41 points – the club’s third in a row, and all under the astute leadership of coach Kurt Byard.\n\nThe Development had an unbelievable season , winning all roster games, ending with a massive percentage of 1,039, and raising the premiership cup.\n\nDevonport also stood strong with the juniors and women, fielding teams at every level\n\nKurt Heazlewood is the only winner of the Darrel Baldock medal while Matthew Langmaid (2), Phil Crowden (with 111) and Charlie Castles (57) in 2023 have taken out the seniors goalkicking award.\n\nThe Paddy Martin medal for best rep. game player has gone to Mark Lowe while Clint Matthews has taken out the Most Improved Player award with Oliver Kelly (2021) and Kai Cameron in 2023 being awarded the Best 1st Year Senior Player award..\n\nQuaide Byard and Braden Van Buuren’s have taken out the Wayne Wing medal for best on ground in the seniors grand final while in 2023 that prestigious award went to Keegan Lowe, who also that year won the SeaFM Rising Star (Under23) award.\n\nCaleb Van Buuren shared The Advocate/CUB Player of the Year award and took out the CoastFM Player of the Year, as voted on by all coaches in 2022.\n\nThe Development best and fairest winners are Mitchell Wilson, Beau Bramich and Jack Foster, while in 2022 Hayden Reid shared that award, with Blair Ryan taking it out in 2023. Leading goalkickers are Marcus Smith and Joshua Moore, with Nick Milbourne taking that award in 2023, while Nick Hess, Xavier Todman and Milbourne (2023) were best in grand finals.\n\nBrent Sheean, Fletcher Kelly, Chase Redpath and Zac Heazlewood won the Colts best and fairest; best in grand finals were Kristan Higgs, Alex Jolly, Redpath and Ely Blizzard.. Leading goalkickers were Higgs, Corey Plumbridge, Joshua McConnon, Tristan Wells and Blizzard, with a roster season’s 64 majors seeing that award go to Lucas Ivory in 2023.\n\nBest players in Colts rep games were Brenton Gale, Darren Banham and Bradley Chard with Bailey Woodcock being best player in 2023.\n\nThe club won the NWFL women’s flag in 2018-19 with Zoe Knight, Savahn Overall and Meg Graham having won the best and fairest. Overall and Graham were best in grand finals. Penelope Fulton and Knight have taken out the leading goalkicker awards.\n\nAdministrators recognised have been Ted Smith and Peter Davern with the Patrons Service to Football award, while Certificates of Merit have gone to Athol McIvor, Tony Bell and Graeme Andrews: all absolute stalwarts of the club, among many others.\n\nIn 2021 the legendary Athol McIvor became the first individual to be inducted into the NWFL Hall of Fame, solely for his contribution to the Devonport Football Club.\n\nFormer high profile club members Dale Perry and Matthew Langmaid have also been recognised at this level for their involvement with the club and in other areas.\n\nGoalkicking ace Nick Milbourne joined the Hall of Fame for his services to the Devonport and East Devonport clubs.\n\nIn 2018 Indea Pearce was named winner of the NWFL Ambassador Quest.\n\nA significant number of nine individuals have been NWFL Board Directors in the 17 years, including Neil Wilkinson’s five year term.\n\nWynyard: 1987 - 2023 37 years\n\nIn the early days Wynyard competed without much success. It was a wonderful club, especially socially. Club icon Kerry ‘Couta’ O’Neill basically ‘ran the show’ as secretary.\n\nRox Snare, Richard Lakeland, Robert Hope, Colin Robertson and Dale Hutton were all good leaders but in the first twenty years the club won just a single flag, the Development in 1987.\n\nAnd then along came Tom. Greyhound guru Tom Englund has now moved on, but when he became president things began to happen and the club hasn’t looked back, with fantastic people involved. Just look at the ground and facilities, and the football culture.\n\nThe club has now won three senior premierships, five Development, four Colts and a colossal ten club championships (2nd only to Ulverstone). The club in 2020 won its first NWFL Women’s premiership, a feat which was repeated in 2023, with just one defeat for the season..\n\nBest player awards in the seniors (Baldock medal) have gone to Tony Flint, Sam Douglas (3), Zac Smith, Dylan Smith and Kallum Kubicki , while the goalkicking award has been taken out by Kevin Taylor, who in 1987 amassed 141 goals, which remains an NWFL record (and is likely to remain so).\n\nGregg Sharman (3 times), Grant Williams (2) and Brody Denehey are also winners in that category.\n\nBest player in seniors grand finals have been Zac Smith (2) and Zane Murphy while Mark Stretton, Kubicki , Denehey and Geordie Payne have won best 1st year player awards.\n\nMost Improved player awards have gone to Roger Newman, Gregg Sharman in 1998 (who then progressed far), as did Sam Douglas, plus Anthony MacMichael and Zac Marshall.\n\nThe Development Best and Fairest has been taken out by Joey Hawkes, Marty Fry, Ben Englund, Andrew House, Todd Chatwin and James Allen.\n\nBest in grand finals have been Jye Gardam, Jake Watts and Sam Gleeson with leading goalkickers Ricky Mica, Manassa Walker, Brady Allen (3), Ben Dawson and Chris Bryan.\n\nIn the Colts best and fairest Scott Garland, Nick Mitchell, James Allen (2), Jahmar Jackson , and Mason Elphinstone (2023) are winners, with best in grand finals being Ben Grubb, Kai Apted, Tane Routledge and Kobi Lyons.\n\nNick Pearce and Thomas Liefhebber received best player medals in Colts rep. games.\n\nLeading goalkickers are Andrew Jenkins, Peter Fulton, Clint Robertson, Tyller Keene, Zac Marshall and Routledge.\n\nFor the first time a Wynyard player took out the best and fairest, with Olivia Smith taking out this prestigious award.\n\nBest player in the Cat’s 2023 women’s premiership side was Amy Bissett with Abbie Hoiberg-Cox taking that Award in 2020\n\nWith a record 50 goals Amy also won the NWFL leading goalkicker award..\n\nIn 2021 the inaugural women’s Most Improved Player award winner was Elise Hoiberg-Cox, while in 2022 Olivia Smith took out the SeaFM Womens’ Player of the Year award.\n\nSo there are plenty of individual award winners in Cat country. But there’s more:\n\nKerry O’Neill and Roxley Snare are NWFL Life Members while Glenn Ebdon, Clinton Stretton and Roxley are Hall of Fame members, with Dan Smith being added in 2021\n\nPatrons Service to Football awards have gone to Kerry, Tom Englund, Kathy Granger and Peter Symes.\n\nCertificates of Merit recipients are Brendan O’Neill, Wayne Arthur, Grant Crowe, Phyllis Voss, Linda Hope, Adrian Hope, Phillip Granger, Sherrie Leno, Darryl O’Halloran and Rox Snare, who is the only person to have been recognised in every non-playing category available within the league.\n\nThe club has done well in the Queen/Ambassador Quest with seven winners in this important category.\n\nBelinda Hutchinson, Bridget Elliott, Kelly Bakes, Madison Hope, Rachel Degenhardt, Emma Page and Zoe O’Halloran (2021 and daughter of Kelly) are all winners.\n\nThe club has had 11 individual NWFL Board Directors including Kerry O’Neill for 13 years.\n\nWynyard, proud, loyal foundation member of the NWFL.\n\nBurnie Tigers: 1987-93 Burnie Dockers 2001-2008: 2015-2023 (less 2017) 23 years:\n\nWith one team from Burnie being involved with the state league, the other, the Burnie Tigers, thankfully, for seven years was a major player in the NWFL, hosting four grand finals and a rep. game in addition to winning a senior premiership and two Development flags in those early days of the league.\n\nA book could be written on the politics of football in Burnie in that era, with the Tigers disappearing, amalgamations, new names and changes to the entire structure. Burnie Tigers, Cooee Bulldogs, Burnie Hawks and now it’s settled – the Burnie Dockers.\n\nThe Dockers joined the NWFL in 2001 for eight dominant years, rejoining the state league in 2009 where it won a flag before returning to the NWFL in 2015 where it remains as a strong, well administered club. It actually fielded teams in both the NWFL and state league for a time but that became too difficult, impracticable and unsuccessful.\n\nThe Tigers in 1992 won the flag under the coaching of ex Richmond ace Mark Lee with his former Richmond team mate Jim Jess being a grand final match winner. Burnie went down to East Devonport by just four points in 1988 in its only other senior grand final appearance.\n\nChris Reynolds in 1991 and 1992 won the NWFL leading goalkicker award, with Colin Lamprey and James Sweeney taking out the best 1st year player award while the Paddy Martin medal for his rep game performance went to Craig Johnstone, with subsequent winners of that award from the Dockers being Matthew Smith and two time winner Dylan Smith. Jess won the best player medal in the ’92 grand final.\n\nWith 102 goals in 2001 Andrew Hering was the league leading goalkicker, he repeated the dose in 2004 while Harry Walters is also a two time winner in that category.\n\nA host of players were deemed best player in Docker’s grand finals – Matthew Wooldridge, Nick Probert, Matthew Smith, Jason Howard, Brad Davis, Nick McKenna, Dylan Smith and Kade Munday.\n\nJack McCulloch in 2018 was adjudged best first year senior player, with Colin Lamprey and James Sweeney taking out that award way back in 1989 and 1990, Kade Munday (2001) and Nigel White in 2004.\n\nTravis Hudson in 2004 took out the Development leading goalkicker award with 65 goals while in that premiership year best on ground in the Development grand final was Ben Britton.\n\nBrett Robinson (2001) and Brett Miller (2008) have also been best in grand finals.\n\nIn 1989 the Colts best and fairest was won by Darren French and Oliver Fryett in 2016, while leading goalkickers were Phillip Glozier and French (2).\n\nGrand Final best players have been Blair Challis (2016) and Samual Neasey (2020)\n\nIn 2001 along came the Burnie Dockers, representing the city of Burnie, led by coach and club administrator, former Collingwood premiership player Mick McGuane.\n\nA sharp operator was he!\n\nThe club won five consecutive senior flags (to match Ulverstone) under McGuane, Nick Probert and Errol Bourn. It also took out two Development flags and three club championships in that era.\n\nLaunceston then dominated the competition before they all left for yet another state league competition in 2009.\n\nThe Dockers returned to the NWFL in 2015 while briefly remaining in the state league and subsequently won three consecutive flags under Brent Plant, giving the Dockers eight senior premierships in 13 years. This time round it also won the 2020 under 18’s flag.\n\nThe club played solely in the state league in 2017 but was welcomed back to the NWFL in 2018.\n\n2021 was the Dockers least successful year since returning to Tasmania’s premier regional competition in 2018, but there was a marked improvement in 2022 with the senior team being knocked out in the Preliminary Final and Colts reaching the finals, while the Under 12’s were successful in their grand final.\n\nThe Dockers really came alive in 2023, defeating Devonport in the 2nd semi, but succumbing to the Pies two weeks later in the Grand Final, while the Colts finished the season third.\n\nThe club’s juniors were competitive in all five levels.\n\nFor the first time the club fielded a women’s team in the NWFL, surprising everyone with four wins – a tremendous effort first up.\n\nReese Davis, daughter of club legend Brad capped it all off by winning the Best 1st Year Senior Player award.\n\nBailey Boag was voted best senior player in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2023, with Nick Probert and Kade Munday also being on the Darrel Baldock medal honour board.\n\nBoag now holds the record as a four time winner of the league’s top award.\n\nThe co-captain in 2023 for the 2nd time won the Impress Print Most Valuable Player award after another stellar season and in 2022 shared the C.U.B./Advocate Player of the Year award .\n\nAll senior coaches voted weekly in the CoastFM Player of the Year Award and not surprisingly Boags also took out this award. What a season he had; what a record he has – and he’s still only 24!\n\nHarry Walters has won the leading goalkicker award, as has Andrew Hering twice, including a tally of 102.\n\nBest 1st Year Senior Player was taken out by Munday, Jack McCulloch and Nigel White with Matthew Smith and Dylan Smith (twice) winning the prestigious Paddy Martin medal as best rep game players.\n\nBest in the (many) grand finals are Jim Jess, Matthew Wooldridge, Probert, Matthew Smith, Jason Howard, Brad Davis, Nick McKenna, Dylan Smith and Munday.\n\nBest in the Development grand final was Brett Robinson and Ben Britton, with leading goalkicker, Travis Hudson.\n\nUnder 18’s best and fairest was won by Oliver Fryett with Blair Challis and Samuel Neasey being best in grand finals.\n\nPatrons Service to Football awards have gone to:\n\nTigers – Ian Wright (+ other service) + Dockers – Kim Miles and Barry Walker (+ other service) and Harvey Warren.\n\nKim Miles in 2021 was made a Life Member of the NWFL for his contribution to the club, in addition to other significant roles within the league.\n\nIn 2022 the dedicated Terry Sandman became a member of the NWFL Hall of Fame, the first person to have done so solely for his contribution to the Burnie club.\n\nCertificates of Merit have gone to Freda Trevarthen, Sedric Trevarthen and Charlie Crane (all Tigers)\n\nQueen/Ambassador Quest winners for the Tigers were Tammy Lamprey and Kristie Atkinson with the Dockers Claire Hall also being a winner.\n\nTigers Queen Belinda Walker took out the “Miss Fundraiser” category.\n\nIn 23 years Burnie has had 10 individual league Board members with Ian Wright, Geoff Jacobs, Peter Vincent and Jamie Boag each representing their club at that level for three years.\n\nIn 2005 The Burnie/Cooee clubs were inducted into the Tasmanian Hall of Fame as a ‘great club’. From those two clubs the Burnie Dockers Football Club evolved.\n\nCircular Head Saints /Smithton Saints / Circular Head Giants: 1987 – 2018, 2022- 2023 34 years\n\nSmithton, Circular Head a magnificent club in an awesome community.\n\nOn-field it won the seniors premiership in 1991 under former Geelong player Darren Denneman with Darren Munday being awarded the best player medal in the grand final.\n\nThe club won the club championship in 1989 and 2009 and also played in three losing grand finals.\n\nThe under 18/19’s won the flag in 2001 and 2009.\n\nMark Thorp, Dean Tuson, Denneman, Tony Crennan, Clint Riley and Matt Elliott are all on the Baldock medal honour board as league best player. Damien Medwin won the goalkicking award with 88 in 2009.\n\nThorp, Danny Schoenmaker, Medwin and Tyson Armstrong were best first year senior player award winners while the Most Improved player award went to Wayne Dixon, Jaiden Crole and Josh Gale.\n\nIn the league Development best and fairest Jeff Triffitt, Dean Johnson, Troy Donohue, Kelvin Popowski and Ben Poke took the limelight while in the under age David Coates remains the only player to win the award twice. Jarod Watling and Armstrong also being winners.\n\nMark Spinks, Scott Bryan and Regan Townsend won the best player medal in under age grand finals while Tyrone Morrison won the best player award in the 2007 Rep Game.\n\nMorrison in 2022 played his 250th game, after having long since departed Circular Head for success at the Burnie Dockers.\n\nTony Crennan in 1994 was awarded the Paddy Martin medal with Kent Jackson also winning that award while Scott (Soup bones) Blizzard took it out twice. He was awarded Life Membership of the league in 2015 after playing 300 senior games.\n\nOff-field is where the side from Circular Head excelled, as confirmed by the number of personnel recognised by the league. Haydn Nichols, Jodie Saville, Mary Saville, Fred O’Halloran, Bill O’Halloran, Judith Moore, Peter Dunlop and Tony Maguire are all members of the Hall of Fame.\n\nPatrons Service to Football presentations have been made to Scott Knight, Bill O’Halloran, Mary Saville, Gavin Coombe, Kevin Radford and Megan Popowski while\n\nStafford Heres, Leonie Edwards, Nichols and David Riddoch received Merit awards.\n\nThe Queen Quest, later to become the Ambassador Quest was an area in which the club thrived with Melissa Saville in 1989 and Letitia House (2017 ) reigning supreme.\n\nIn the former Miss Fundraiser section the club dominated, often sharing the accolades with fellow country club (at the other end of the island), Scottsdale.\n\nNo less than six winners came from the Saints, Cindy Bishop, Shelly Popowski, Megan Dunlop, Laurinda Murphy, Jodie Edwards and Shaundelle Medwin.\n\nIn 2005 the league scrapped the idea of recognising the club queen who raised the most money, primarily because of a perception that those isolated ‘country’ clubs had a distinct advantage over those in the major towns. You know, spuds and cattle.\n\nIn the early days the ground and facilities could only be described as being unique with those in the grandstand almost needing binoculars to see the game. But then along came people with foresight and money and now the facilities and ground are superb (and they’ve retained the legendary ‘Fishermens Shed’ from where lubricated fans can watch games.\n\nIn 2016 in an effort to increase interest and support within the community in the club it chose to change its name from Saints to Circular Head Giants. That idea seemingly did not work and disappointingly just three years later the club went into recess. Fortunately a group of people with foresight, led by new president -to-be, Keith Billing rekindled interest in the club and in 2022 it returned to the ranks of the NWFL.\n\nIt has been a tough return to the NWFL, with the club winning just two games across the seniors and Development in the two seasons. A real positive is the fact in 2023, their first season back with the league the club’s Colts won seven games, reaching the finals and winning the elimination final against reigning premiers Devonport. At junior level Circular Head fielded teams in the Boys Under 14’s and Under 12’s and Girls Under 17’s, so the signs are promising. The club’s presence in the league has been strongly supported by other clubs and we can be sure that with further support from the Circular Head community it will continue to grow with benefits for the whole region.\n\nTime spent at Smithton was always worth the travel, with friendships and catering unequalled.\n\nIn 34 years 12 people represented the club as NWFL Director level with the president who sadly oversaw the club going into recess, Nic Bellinger and former coach Tony Maguire each with five years leading the longevity stakes\n\nEast Devonport: 1987 – 2020 34 years\n\nIt was a sad situation when in early 2021 this city based club with a history dating back more than 100 years discovered it could no longer field teams (other than juniors) in the NWFL, all because of a player shortage.\n\nThe Swan’s contribution to Coastal football, including that of the NWFL cannot be understated. Its history of ups and downs is worth noting.\n\nThe club took out the 2nd ever NWFL Grand Final, with the Tim Allen coached side defeating the Burnie Tigers by a mere four points in the only NWFL grand final ever played at the Devonport Oval. The best player medal went Peter Apps.\n\nIt lost its 1987, 1997 and 1998 grand finals and at no level has it played in a grand final other than its victorious effort in the Development in 2010. The Colts never played on that one day in September.\n\nInterestingly in 1997 the club played Ulverstone in the 2nd semi final, scoring 1.4 10, the lowest finals score to date (still), yet won the preliminary final only to come up against the Robins again in the grand final, going down by 78 points.\n\nThe ‘wooden spoon’ for bottom of the seniors ladder is one record the Swans would not have aspired to, having ‘won’ nine in 34 years, or almost one in four.\n\nEast Devonport has certainly had its share of individual award winners.\n\nThe Darrel Baldock (who began his illustrious career with the Swans) medal has been won by Paul Spencer, Craig Muir and Adrian Partridge while Mark Williams with 119 goals in 1988 and Nick Milbourne 72 in 2010 have taken out the leagues’ senior goalkicking award.\n\nThe best first year senior player award has gone to Sam Rundle and Brodie Sheahen while Chris McGurk, Leigh Febey and Jack Triffitt have won the Most Improved Player category.\n\nThose to get a mention in the Development include Nathan T. Applebee, Darren Thornton, Damien Hall and Chris Hall while Creighton Tinney won an Under 18/19’s best and fairest.\n\nGraeme ‘Gypsy’ Lee, Craig Muir and Andrew Buchhorn were recognised for their service by being inducted into the Hall of Fame while Patrons Service to Football awards went to Ron Dell, Dawn Targett, Audrey Conley, Sue Milbourne and Barry Johnson.\n\nNick Milbourne in 2022 became a Hall of Fame member, primarily for his service with East Devonport before becoming a premiership full forward with Devonport following the Swans demise.\n\nCertificates of Merit were awarded to Sue, Andrew, Graeme Walton and Michael Tait.\n\nAmbassador Quest winners have been Vashti Borlini, Elliott Stenson and Grant Milbourne.\n\nIn 34 years the club had 11 different NWFL Board Directors, headed by Graeme Walton, seven years and club foundation president Ron Dell, six.\n\nThe club has a fantastic history, in addition to ‘the Doc’, ace AFL players including Graham Wright and Matthew Richardson were involved early in their careers.\n\nArnold Richardson, Sue (nee Richardson) Milbourne, ‘Gypsy’ Lee are among many whose influence at the club cannot be measured. “Businessmen’s”lunches, high profile guests were part of the culture.\n\nHopefully the current situation is just an aberration; that the Swans will soon return to normal operation. Girdlestone Park is a magnificent ground, the facilities are first rate and the club is financially very sound.\n\nFor many years the club magnificently hosted finals footy, which was a credit to all concerned.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023 it fielded teams in all three levels of the NWFL junior boys competition and girls under 14’s, so the signs are there..\n\nWe must remain optimistic.\n\nLaunceston: 1987- 1993 1998 – 2008 18 years\n\nLaunceston was a foundation league member which in 1994 joined the state league before returning to the NWFL four years later.\n\nSuccess was limited in the club’s first life in our league with no premierships and only Paul Beechy (best 1st year player) and Alan Neville ( rep game best player) winning awards I that time.\n\nBut when the club returned to the competition, it was look out, especially in later years.\n\nIn 2006-2008 the club played in its only NWFL grand finals, winning all three under the leadership of Adam Sanders.\n\nThis success was preceded in 1998 when the Under 18’s won the premiership.\n\nIn 2008, the last year of the club’s involvement it also took out the Club Championship.\n\nThe Darrel Baldock medal was won by Sanders, Anthony Taylor and Brian Finch, who also was recognised twice as best rep. game player, with Brennan Savage also a winner.\n\nSuperboot Adam Derbyshire won the league goalkicking award three times, including centuries (111) in 2006 and 125 in 2008. What an inspiration it was to watch his leads, marks and kicks. They don’t seem to make full forwards like that anymore!\n\nFurther League awards at senior level went to Ashley Peck, Nathan O’Donoghue (2), Brad Dutton ,Gene Savage, Andrea Miar, Sam O’Keefe, Derbyshire and Tom Bellchambers.\n\nReserve award winners were Simon Hill (2) and Simon Spencer, as best and fairest.\n\nGordon Smith, Matthew Alway, Nathan Pendergast, Brad Dutton and Scott Bernes figured in the under18/19’s awards.\n\nJenny Thurlow (1992) and Tiani Steele (1998) took out the league’s Queen Quest (later Ambassador Quest) while in 1988 Kellie Pinner won the “Miss Fundraiser” section.\n\nKevin Goldsmith and Malcolm Atkins each with five years in the role were significant Board\n\nDirectors at the league. Seven people represented the club over the 18 years at Board level.\n\nWhen the club (like others) in 2008 was negotiating to re-join the State League, to Malcolm’s credit he kept the league and its board up-to-date with what was happening. No secrets.\n\nSuccess has finally come the way of the Blues at state level. It is a proud club, one of the oldest in the country, which was always a pleasure to deal with.\n\nDeloraine: 1987-2003 17 years\n\nThe Kangaroos were in a difficult position being jammed between the north of the state (NTFA) and the north west coast, with the bulk of the population and therefore prospective players living quite some distance away on either side of the Meander River town.\n\nThe club did not have a lot of success but what a wonderful club it was with its sole league Hall of Fame member Stephen Tyson, a key figure being the club’s League Board member for nine years, in addition to serving another three years as an independent. In 17 years the club had just five different NWFL Board members.\n\nDeloraine played in no grand finals at any level and in its last year (2003) won just two senior games, one Development and three under 18’s. The following year it went back to the NTFA.\n\nRod Thomas captained the NWFL rep. team on three occasions, winning the Paddy Martin award for best player twice.\n\nAt senior level Jamie McClennaghan, Charlie Challis, Simon Coull and Brad Crowden were recognised with various awards while Damien McClennaghan and Adam Kent took out under 18/19’s best and fairest awards.\n\nLeague Certificates of Merit went to Sheila Simpson, John Loone MLC, David Simpson and Ian Cubit.\n\nDeloraine had a habit of producing fine young ladies to represent it in the league’s Queen Quest, later to become the Ambassador Quest. Five times the winner came from Deloraine.\n\nKathryn Loone, Merrilyn Young, Kim Underlin, Courtney Heffernan and Linda Sherriff are on the honour roll as winners.\n\nIn 1987 Lynn Paine was the recipient of the “Miss Fundraiser” award.\n\nTravelling to matches at Deloraine, where the league’s “season launch’ function was once held was always enjoyable. It was a joy to join the umpiring experts upstairs and later a good time could be assured in the wonderful clubrooms.\n\nThe visitors’ changerooms, well that’s another story.\n\nScottsdale: 1987 – 1999 13 years\n\nAt times north west coasters used to moan about the long trip to Scottsdale: around 300km from Smithton or 200km each way from Ulverstone. But Coastal clubs visited the Magpies nest once each season while the northerners made the trip to the Coast maybe eight times in a year.\n\nIt was also a long trip to Devonport for league meetings or for players to attend tribunal hearings. Scottsdale was a key cog in the competition for 13 years from 1987.\n\nThe club was an iconic part of football in Tasmania and it certainly made an impact on our league.\n\nIn 1989 at Latrobe the Danny Hall coached senior team defeated Smithton, the Development also won the 1989 flag and again in 1994.\n\nDespite winning the club championship in 1990 the side lost the grand final to Ulverstone that year and again succumbed to the Robins in 1993.\n\nRuckman Peter Roozendaal and coach Ricky Hanlon won the Baldock medal in 1990 and 1992 respectively while Mark Nichols won the goalkicking in 1990 and 1993 with Stuart Blackwell taking out that award in 1996.\n\nBrett Hadley, Tony Saunders and Craig Willis won NWFL seniors awards while in the Development Mark Nichols, Stephen Nichols, Matthew Goss, Gary Underhill, Phil Bennett and Chris Baker were recognised in various categories.\n\nLikewise in the Under 18’s/19’s Brett Lethborg, Cameron Galbraith and Michael Towns are in the record books.\n\nRicky Hanlon coached the league representative side to a narrow loss in 1993.\n\nScottsdale’s significance in Tasmanian football and that of many associated with the club was confirmed when the league in 2001 awarded four of its players Life Membership, along with three former NWFU players.\n\nThe honour went to Danny Hall, Greg Lethborg, Stephen Nichols and Rodney Hill.\n\nIn 1994 Tamara Burnett won the NWFL Ambassador Award (formerly Queen Quest) while the “Miss Fundraiser” award which annually became a battle between Scottsdale and Smithton “Queens” was taken out by Tina Abraham, Chelsea Jones, Taneil Hall and Sharee Cassidy.\n\nLong time club president Bill Krushka was for five years the club’s NWFL Board member, a similar term to that of Greg Howard, current Dorset Mayor. In 13 years just four people represented the Magpies at Board level.\n\nScottsdale has been recognised as a Tasmanian “Great club” with “Legendary Team” status also accorded it.\n\nTrips from the coast to Scottsdale were always enjoyable and worthwhile even if the coast based league management copped a bit of flack from club supporters!\n\nSouth Launceston: 1998 – 2008 11 years\n\nIn 1998 the Bulldogs were another club which joined the NWFL from the state league (only to return there briefly in 2009)\n\nThey played in two successful seniors grand finals in that initial yearand 1999, but didn’t play in another, although in 11 years the Development and under 18’s each played in four for two flags apiece. The club won the Club Championship in 2002.\n\nScott Harris (2000) and Matthew Westfield (2006) took out the league’s major player award, the Darrel Baldock medal while Jade Elmer, Scott Harris, Chad Baker and Scott Stephens in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 were awarded the Paddy Martin medal as best rep. game players.\n\nJade Elmer and Brent Dean were deemed best players in their respective senior’s grand finals (1998, 1999).\n\nIt was a dominant era for the ‘Dogs’ and its players.\n\nOther best players at Development level included Jacob Norris, Glenn Chapman, Matthew Smart, and Shaun Spencer while in 2001 and 2002 Geoff Page took out the goalkicking awards – while at the same time being an independent member of the league executive before assuming the role for four years as the club’s league Board Director.\n\nThe under 18’s best and fairest was won by Dane Nicholls and Mitcham Toreresi while Michael Lette won the goalkicking award in consecutive years. Sam Page was best in a grand final and Nicholas Buller rewarded for a great performance in the rep game.\n\nNo South Launceston player, official or ‘helper’ was recognised with any form of award by the league, as sadly the club apparently had a policy not to nominate such people for consideration.\n\nIt was always a pleasure to visit Youngtown where the Bulldogs also hosted a handful of finals games, while visiting players experienced changerooms almost as small as those at Deloraine!\n\nIn 11 years the club had six different NWFL Board members with Geoff Page (4 years) heading the list\n\nNorth Launceston: 2001-2008 8 years\n\nThis proud former NTFA club had its first foray in the state league before joining the NWFL in 2001, where it played a significant role for eight years and despite not winning a seniors flag (against tough opposition) returned to the state league in 2009 where winning seniors premierships became the norm.\n\nThe Bombers played in four under 18’s premierships, winning three, won a Development grand final with two unsuccessful seniors grand finals, while in 2005 it shared the important Club Championship award with Devonport. .\n\nAt senior level Allan O’Sign, Robert Gilligan, Alex Grima and Leigh Harding won NWFL awards while Callan Young in 2006 took out the Development best and fairest, with Josh Chugg in 2007 booting a record breaking 109 goals to win the Development goalkicking competition.\n\nBen Arkless, Josh Murfet, Matthew Adams, Sonny Whiting, Josh Newson and Shannon Buller all took out league awards during the club’s eight years while the hardworking Lilla Fitzallen was recognised for her contribution over many years with an NWFL Merit Award.\n\nThe irrepressible Reg Lyons (who later went on to join the NTFA and became its General Manager) was North’s NWFL rep for seven years. Gary Carr also did a term.\n\nGeorgeTown:1987-1990 4 years\n\nThe Saints were original members of the league, but after four years returned to the NTFA.\n\nThe club was quite successful winning 22 games in the four years at senior level, 35 + two draws in the Development who reached the finals on two occasions, while the Unders were victorious 22 times including 12 wins and a draw in their final year.\n\nIn 1988 Derek Smith won the league Under18/19’s best and fairest.\n\nThe club’s Board members over the years were Lionel Young, Kevin Porteus, Mick Cowburn and Brent Woolley.\n\nSouth Burnie: 1997-1998 2 years\n\nAfter significant success in the Darwin Association the club joined the league in 1997.\n\nOn-field that first season the club won a single game at senior level, two in the Development and four in the Under 18/19’s. There was improvement the following year with three, one and five wins across the three grades.\n\nAfter two seasons the club decided it had had enough, returning to the DFA where from time to time it has dominated the competition.\n\nIn 1998 Trevor Snooks was recognised with a Certificate of Merit award.\n\nIt has been said that perhaps people involved at the time did not show enough tolerance or patience as South Burnie slowly adapted to the requirements of the higher level of competition and administration.\n\nLongford:1987 One year\n\nThe Tigers were foundation members of the league but chose to return to the decimated NTFA at the conclusion of the first year. The club had some success, winning three games in each of the seniors and Development while its under 18/19’s showed promise with eight victories. There were no individual league award winners. Its NWFL Board member was Michael Barnes.\n\nPREMIERSHIPS (current clubs)\n\nClub Seniors Reserves/Development U18/19 Women TOTAL\n\nUlverstone 10 9 18 2 39\n\nBurnie Dockers/Tigers 9 5 2 - 16\n\nWynyard 3 5 4 2 14\n\nLatrobe 4 6 1 1 12\n\nDevonport 3 3 3 2 11\n\nPenguin - 2 1 - 3\n\nCircular Head 1 - 2 - 3"
