        "text": "Mark Evans sighs when you ask whether this could be the season when Harlequins finally achieve something major, and certainly there was little to support the prospect yesterday when they suffered a dispiriting 32-21 defeat by London Irish at the Stoop.\n\nA match they must surely have expected to win, rarely looked within their grasp...\n\nEven before yesterday, Evans, Quins' chief executive since May last year, was eager to play down the optimisim that has been gathering since the New Zealander Zinzan Brooke quit as head coach at the start of the year. Evans himself took over Brooke's role and, barely a week later, the club surprised everyone by seeing off Leicester 22-18 in the Tetley's Bitter Cup semi-final. They then went on to win the European Shield, which put them into this season's Heineken Cup.\n\n\"I suppose people look at the second half of last season and then extrapolate from that,\" says Evans. \"But the league table doesn't lie and, over the course of the season, we came eleventh out of 12.\"\n\nEvans, 42, is an engaging character. Born in London and raised in South Wales, he went to Cambridge University where he played hardly any rugby because \"I was in revolutionary upheaval\". Like all good revolutionaries, he went into teaching - he ended up as the deputy head of a big comprehensive in Essex - and started to take his rugby seriously. He made the Saracens first team playing at hooker, turned to coaching and then became the club's director of rugby, before switching to Harlequins in 2000.\n\nOne of the reasons, Evans says, that Quins' season improved after he took over as coach last January was that \"we probably engendered a better spirit\", but says this shouldn't be taken as an implied criticism of Brooke. \"Morale was never poor, but the confidence had gone and sometimes to get the confidence back you have to wipe the slate clean and start again.\" He says that he wasn't tempted to continue as coach himself this season. \"That would have been very selfish and it wasn't the job I was recruited to do. It would have meant that a lot of the other things that need doing would have been neglected.\"\n\nDespite yesterday's reverse, Evans is confident the new coach, John Kingston, can make a difference. A good club prop, who captained Cambridge University, Kingston had success coaching Richmond before that club, as Evans puts it, \"went belly up a couple of years back\". Kingston, a Geordie, then went to Ireland where he enhanced his reputation while in charge of Galwegians. \"A lot of people expressed interest in coaching Quins,\" says Evans, \"and I felt John was the outstanding candidate.\"\n\nKingston has a squad to work with that has been strengthened by, among others, the returning Lions winger Dan Luger and two other players from Saracens, Bill Davison and Tony Diprose. Evans denies that he deliberately targeted his former club when he went about recruiting during the summer. \"It was really a question of they fitted what we needed and they all happened to be at Saracens. It was just one of those things, really.\" Kingston has also been boosted by key players such as Will Greenwood and Jason Leonard signing deals with the club even though they weren't out of contract.\n\nIt is easier to pin Evans down on numbers when talking about off-the-pitch matters - \"I expect to grow our average gate. Last season it was about 4,000 and this season I would be disappointed if it didn't average more than 5,000\" - than it is when discussing the team's playing ambitions.\n\n\"If we start saying we must come in the top three and come fourth, is that a failure? I don't know. It seems a bit silly to me. We try to be much more performance orientated than outcome orientated. If we defend well, play with a good attitude and train properly then results will come. It's the second year of a relaunch, I suppose. We made some strides last season, now we want to consolidate on those.\"\n\nThe image of Quins as a bunch of dilettantes who are incapable of success is not one that worries Evans. \"To be quite honest, it's not accurate, but I don't think it's particularly damaging either,\" he says. \"People who bring it up either know what they're talking about and are taking the rise or they haven't been around the scene for about 30 years. So I don't take too much notice of it. It's a stereotype, really. Just as Gloucester are supposed to be a bunch of mauling forwards, which they haven't been for years, or Saracens are a collection of foreign stars, when they've probably got more young English players than any other club in the country.\"\n\nSadly for Evans, the perception in some quarters of Quins as inveterate underachievers will not have been dispelled by yesterday's performance.\n\nHarlequins: Gollings; Moore, Burrows, Greenstock, Luger; Burke, Powell; Leonard, Fuga, Dawson, Morgan, White-Cooper, Winters, Sanderson, Diprose.\n\nReplacements: Wood, Olver, Davison, Alesbrook, Bemand, Mapletoft, Bell.\n\nLondon Irish: Horak; Cunningham, Bishop, Venter, Sackey; Everitt, Edwards; Worsley, Drotske, Halford, Strudwick, Fahrensohn, Cockle, Dawson, Sheasby.\n\nReplacements: Barrett, Hoadley, Danaher, Halvey, Kirke, Hatley, Delaney."
