        "text": "Brotherhood of St Laurence partnership\n\nThe University’s partnership with the Brotherhood of St Laurence is one of the key community relationships within the University.\n\nThe University and the Brotherhood share a history of collaboration going back at least 50 years, with a more formalised approach established in 2003 to broaden the partnership’s cross-faculty links and encourage greater University-wide collaboration. A Memorandum of Understanding was completed in 2013 which drove the work for the next five years. The partnership continues to flourish to this day.\n\nThis long-standing partnership focuses on a joint research agenda that addresses social inclusion across the life course, with a particular focus on helping to shape inclusive growth, social inclusion and poverty-prevention policies.\n\nLearn more\n\nScope – University of Melbourne Partnership\n\nThe Scope – University of Melbourne Partnership is a collaboration that draws upon the interdisciplinary expertise of staff from both University of Melbourne and Scope Australia.\n\nWorking with the emerging expertise of University of Melbourne students, the partnership is a leader in disability research, teaching and advocacy, informed by rigorous scholarship and the lived experience of people with disability.\n\nTogether, the University of Melbourne and Scope Australia are collaborating on a range of activities that are improving services to, and the lives of people with disability and their families.
