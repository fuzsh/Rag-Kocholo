        "text": "False context\n\nThis category is used to describe content that is genuine but has been reframed in dangerous ways. One of the most powerful examples of this technique was posted shortly after an Islamist-related terror attack on Westminster Bridge in London in 2017. A car mounted the curb and drove the length of the bridge, injuring at least 50 people and killing five, before crashing into the gates of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nOne tweet was circulated widely in the aftermath. This is a genuine image. Not fake. It was shared widely, using an Islamophobic framing with a number of hashtags including #banislam.\n\nThe woman in the photograph was interviewed afterward and explained she was traumatized, on the phone with a loved one and, out of respect, not looking at the victim. We now know that this account, Texas LoneStar, was part of a Russian disinformation campaign and has since been shut down.\n\nAn account associated with a Russian disinformation campaign implies that the Muslim woman depicted was indifferent to the victim of an attack. In reality, she was not looking at the victim out of respect. The account has been deleted but was reported in The Guardian.\n\nAnother example that caused significant outrage was this image of a child inside a cage that circulated in the summer of 2018.\n\nIt received over 20,000 retweets. A similar post on Facebook received over 10,000 shares. The picture was actually staged as part of a protest two days earlier at Dallas City Hall against immigration policies — another example of a genuine image where the context got framed and warped. In this example, however, the author did not realize it was part of a protest when he shared the image. It was a case of misinformation, not disinformation.\n\nIn a similar vein, during the lead-up to the US midterm election, there was a great deal of coverage around the “caravan” of immigrants traveling to the US from Central America. Genuine imagery was shared, but with misleading framing. One was this Facebook post, which was actually an image of Syrian refugees in Lesbos, Greece, from 2015.\n\nAnother example of false context is this tweet that circulated on Election Day of the 2018 midterm elections. It was based on a genuine video of a broken voting machine that highlighted the wrong name when pressed. The machine was taken out of operation and the person was given the opportunity to vote on a machine that was working correctly. But this tweet, posted by someone with a username that referenced the QAnon conspiracy, used the video to push the idea that this was a more serious example of targeted voter fraud.\n\nImposter content\n\nAs discussed earlier, our brains are always looking for heuristics to understand things like credibility when it comes to information. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that help us make sense of the world. Seeing a brand that we already know is a very powerful heuristic. It is for this reason that we’re seeing an increase in imposter content — false or misleading content that uses well-known logos or the news from established figures or journalists.\n\nI first came across imposter content designed to cause harm when I worked in 2014 for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. We were constantly battling Facebook posts where smugglers were creating pages with the UNHCR logo and posting images of beautiful yachts and telling refugees that they should “call this number to get a place on one of these boats that would take them safely across the Mediterranean.”\n\nSince then, we continue to see examples of agents of disinformation using the logos of established news brands to peddle false and misleading content. Here are two examples of the BBC being used in this way. One circulated in the lead-up to the 2017 UK general election and was posted on social media. The image says that the election is over two days, and depending on your party affiliation, you need to vote on the correct day.\n\nThe other circulated on WhatsApp in the lead-up to the 2017 Kenyan general election, prompting the BBC to put out a fact check stating that the video was not theirs, despite the clever use of BBC branding.\n\nA more sinister example emerged during the 2016 US presidential election when NowThis was forced to issue a similar debunk because of a fabricated video that had been circulating with its logo.\n\nIn 2017, a sophisticated imposter version of Le Soir in Belgium emerged claiming that Macron was being funded by Saudi Arabia. So sophisticated was it that all the hyperlinks in this version took you to the real Le Soir site.\n\nThe Parkland, Florida, shooting on February 14, 2018 was the backdrop for two very worrying techniques emerging around this category of imposter content. The first involved someone taking a Miami Herald story and photoshopping in another paragraph (suggesting that another school had received threats of a similar shooting), screenshotting that and then circulating it on Snapchat.\n\nAnother example also involved the Miami Herald, but this time an individual reporter, Alex Harris, was targeted. Using a fake tweet generator site that allows you to enter a user’s handle so it populates with the genuine photograph and bio, someone created two offensive tweets. They were circulated as screenshots. Anyone who went to Harris’s Twitter page would have seen that she had tweeted no such thing, but in an age where people screenshot controversial tweets before they are deleted, there was no immediate way for her to definitively prove she hadn’t posted the messages. It was a wake-up call about how reporters can be targeted in this way.\n\nAnother famous example of imposter content surfaced during the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election. Using the official Hillary Clinton logo, someone created the following image that was then used to micro-target certain communities of color in order to try to suppress the vote.\n\nRemember that the amount of information people take in on a daily basis just on their phones — emails, social media notifications and push alerts — means heuristics become even more impactful. Therefore logos, the accurate wording of disclaimers and bylines from known reporters are disproportionately impactful.\n\nIn addition to text, videos and images, we increasingly need to be aware of the power of audio to deceive. In the run-up to the Brazilian presidential election in October 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during a campaign event. He spent the next 17 days in a hospital. During that time, an audio message circulated that purported to be Bolsonaro cursing at the nurses and stating “that the theater is over,” which led to conspiracies that his stabbing had been staged to increase sympathy — and therefore support — for the candidate. Forensic audio specialists were able to analyze the recording and confirm that the voice was not Bolsonaro’s, but instead a very authentic-sounding impersonator.\n\nFinally, another technique that has been investigated by Snopes is the creation of sites that look and sound like professional local news sites, such as The Ohio Star or the Minnesota Sun. Republican consultants have set up a network of these, designed to look like reputable local news sites.\n\nThere are five of these sites as part of the Star News Digital Media network. They are partly funded by the Republican candidates these news sites are covering.\n\nConclusion\n\nInformation disorder is complex. Some of it could be described as low-level information pollution — clickbait headlines, sloppy captions or satire that fools — but some of it is sophisticated and deeply deceptive.\n\nIn order to understand, explain and tackle these challenges, the language we use matters. Terminology and definitions matter.\n\nAs this guide has demonstrated, there are many examples of the different ways content can be used to frame, hoax and manipulate. Rather than seeing it all as one, breaking these techniques down can help your newsroom and give your audience a better understanding of the challenges we now face.\n\nThis HTML version of this Essential Guide is the most up-to-date.\n\nClick here to download a PDF version of this guide – last updated October 2019\n\nAbout the author\n\nClaire Wardle currently leads the strategic direction and research for First Draft.
