        "text": "As many Americans have shifted away from organized religion in recent years, mystical thinking has not evaporated, but simply taken on new forms. Popularized in the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s, and influenced by earlier spiritual and religious movements from around the world, the new-age movement includes ideas that are embedded in the belief systems of many Americans.\n\nA YouGov poll in August finds that nearly all Americans hold at least one belief associated with the new-age movement, or have engaged in practices associated with it. Beliefs that emphasize the interconnectedness of humanity — like karma or the view that everything happens for a reason — are among the most widely held. Goals that emphasize the interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit — such as living in harmony with nature and seeking spiritual growth — are also seen as at least somewhat important to most Americans.\n\nNew-age beliefs\n\nThe poll asked Americans whether or not they hold 20 beliefs that fall under the loosely defined umbrella of new-age spiritualism. Nearly nine in 10 Americans — 87% — say they believe in at least one of the 20 polled, and almost half (45%) say they believe in at least five. Of the beliefs asked about, the largest share of Americans, 55%, say they believe in karma, which — while definitions vary — is generally perceived as the notion that a person's actions in life influence what happens to them in the future (or, in some versions, in future lives). Many Americans, though fewer than half, believe in each of the following: hypnosis, extraterrestrials and UFOs, or manifesting — also referred to as the \"law of attraction.\" Around one in four people believe in each of reincarnation, astrology, parallel realities, or telepathy.\n\nPhenomena that involve the ability to see the past or future – including mediums, psychic readings, tarot card readings, and fortune-telling — are less credible to Americans. The two concepts asked about that are least familiar to Americans are Chakras — which refer to energy points in your body — and astral projection, or the ability to have your spirit travel out of your body.\n\nNew-age principles\n\nAmericans agree – at least somewhat – with many of the core principles of new-age spiritualism, which often overlap with tenets of other religious and cultural worldviews, including Christianity. The poll asked about five beliefs, each of which was agreed with — strongly or somewhat — by at least half of people. The assertions with which the largest share of people strongly or somewhat agreed with are that \"everything is interconnected\" and the related principle that \"everything happens for a reason\" (69% and 68%, respectively).\n\nWhile a majority also believe that \"we create our own reality\" (65%) and 52% say \"nothing is as it seems\", these statements don't evoke as strong of an agreement as do the ones about connectedness and everything happening for a reason. The most controversial statement of the five polled — \"everything is god and god is everything\" — is strongly agreed with by 28% of people but strongly disagreed with by 24% (a larger share than strongly disagree with any other statement)."
