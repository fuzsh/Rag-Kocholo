        "text": "Secondhands is a column that examines music of the past through a modern lens.\n\nConnecticut, 1992: I’m 10 years old and lying on the floor of my bedroom, listening to a new age tape with my mom. The music on the tape doesn’t sound anything like Ride the Lightning by Metallica or Unplugged by Mariah Carey, both of which are on my short prepubescent list of The Best Albums of All Time. It doesn’t even sound like music, really. It’s more like how I imagine the desert at night: Some sparkly sounds followed by some windy sounds, then a little bit of flute. If my friend Pat Evans ever heard it he would definitely call it gay, so I don’t play it for Pat Evans, or anyone else. Instead, I keep it—and all the other tapes like it—in a soft black zipper case at the bottom of my closet that nobody knows about but my mom and me.\n\nFourth grade has gone badly so far. Lizzie Shine turns me down for the Memorial Day Parade then chews me out when I ask her best friend, Danielle. I cope by making fun of kids who are chubbier than I am. At night I stand in the corner of the kitchen eating Swiss Miss hot chocolate mix with a serving spoon, then go upstairs and lie awake for two or three hours trying to figure out what happens to your soul after you die. For reasons nobody can understand, my lips are chapped all year round.\n\nAt least I have the tapes. Happy is too strong a word to describe how I feel when I listen to them. Most of the time, I don’t feel anything, which in 1992 is exactly what I need.\n\nLike “serenity” or “self-help,” “new age” is a term that can\n\nconjure weak-minded people desperate to console\n\nthemselves for having somehow failed at life.\n\nAs with any genre, the boundaries surrounding new age are porous. Some of it sounds like hippy folk; some sounds like a de-cluttered version of what people generally call “minimalism”: gauzy, repetitive music that finds a nice place to rest and rests there indefinitely. Some is heavy on the synthesizer; some is basically slow jazz played at a whisper. For people who embrace the term, it’s a system of belief; for everyone else, it’s a slur.\n\nDouglas Mcgowan, a record collector who recently compiled a three-album project called I Am the Center: Private Press New Age Music in America, 1950-1990, says he used to pitch new age music as “downtempo psych” but eventually embraced the term as a badge of honor. “Getting into new age was exciting because it was considered no good. Intelligent people all know that new age is an awful movement socially, and it’s intellectually devoid of anything, and it’s bad music.”\n\nMcgowan lives in the small college town of Eugene, Oregon, where he runs a label called Yoga Records. In 2014, he has plans to reissue albums by a Dutch musician named Enno Velthuys (who he describes as an acid-burned Brian Eno worshipper who lived with his mom) and a woman named Alice Damon, whose album Windsong II he found while buying out the leftovers of a folk-music distribution company that had been collecting dust in an attic in Vermont. (A hardcore collector, Mcgowan talks about his adventures with the embarrassment of a boy. “I don’t think this is anything anyone will find interesting,” he says, sighing. Then he tells me the story anyway.)\n\nLike “serenity” or “self-help,” “new age” is a term that can conjure weak-minded people desperate to console themselves for having somehow failed at life. Even as a kid browsing the bookstore where my mom and I bought our tapes, I had the terrible feeling I was in the presence of losers. Yoga, alternative medicine, astrology, tarot, inter-dimensional travel, allowing one’s body to be a conduit for angels: The new-age spectrum that starts at self-improvement ends in what some people would still call mental illness.\n\nMcgowan’s relationship to these ideas is complicated. He avoids overtly spiritual terms and apologizes when they slip out. He refers to his life as a “search” and thinks that listening to new age can be a healthy way to detach from a culture that constantly bullies us. He fantasizes about what life would be like if new age was piped into American nursery schools or used to interrupt the broadcasts of late-night talk shows. “I think transformation is necessary,” he says, and when he says it, I take him to mean the transformation of the world, or at least the way we perceive it.\n\nAt the same time, he concedes that a lot of people looking for answers in new-age ideals—especially the community that cottoned to the music in the 1970s and 80s—were deluded and sad. “One of my problems with the new-age world was that there was no boogeyman,” he says. “There was no enemy. New age had no answer for what you do about the Koch brothers,” oil heirs who through donations to conservative political campaigns and advocacy groups have supported the kinds of interests liberals see as precipitating the apocalypse. “New age doesn’t believe in the idea that there are evil people in the world,” he says, “but there are.”\n\nI Am the Center focuses on what’s known as private-press new age: music released on record labels so small and in such limited quantities that even calling them “record labels” seems inappropriate. For Mcgowan, who is 38, these mid-70s and early 80s releases represent the genre’s golden age, a time when independently minded people took the project of making music into their own hands.\n\nIn a way, these musicians—people like Iasos, Constance Demby, J.D. Emmanuel, and Peter Davison—functioned as punks: countercultural figures generally dissatisfied with the universe as presented to them by television, the government, public school, and other familiar systems of control. “I’m a staunch believer in the idea that the world is completely fucked,” Mcgowan says. But like any embattled idealist, he’s willing to try and work with the world anyway.\n\nNew age doesn’t stir emotions, it alleviates them.\n\nLet me say that I am by nature an anxious person. I drink too much and often wake up in the middle of the night with a burning need to work. When friends come to me with problems, I bully them with solutions, like someone shaking an old TV set in hopes that the picture might get better.\n\nNew age helps. It dulls my edges and lightens my mood. When I’m working, I use it as a kind of psychological Drano, something to flush out the passages of my brain blocked by subconscious distractions about whether or not I left the heat on upstairs or whether, at 31, I’m too old to have kids.\n\nNew age doesn't stir emotions, it alleviates them. Most of the time, the less that happens on a new age album, the better. “You experience the quietude of a pine forest,” promises the 70s nature-sounds Environments series, “even though it will be anything but quiet.” This is the koan at the heart of new age music: Like bathwater, you feel good when you get in it but don’t really notice until you get out.\n\nOn some level I understand why people can’t tolerate this music. It’s the same reason people can’t tolerate when other people maintain eye contact too long. Society has conditioned us to treat any show of sustained gentleness with either skepticism or pity. We’re taught to thrive on drama, anxiety, and violence because drama, anxiety, and violence are more dynamic and easier to sell. Nothing is less interesting than inner peace. Try and tell a friend about a time when you felt completely at ease with the tides of the world and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nThis still happens, by the way. New age. Trawl Bandcamp in 2014 and you’ll find no shortage of coy, hip-looking albums with pictures of geodes on them. Many of these albums are bad. Some are very good. Some seem interested in new age as a kind of multilayered joke. Some aren’t categorized as new age at all. Lucky Dragons’ Publicity Reform is tagged “future,” “human,” and “life”; Greyghost’s Memoirs of Dementia is tagged “adventurous” and “spiritual,” though both could probably be called new age (and both are great). Some of the music Dan Lopatin records as Oneohtrix Point Never (especially some of his album Replica) could be, too, along with some of the artists on Lopatin’s label, Software. One of my favorite albums of last year, Bitchin Bajas Bitchitronics, is probably new age (whether Bitchin Bajas like it or not).\n\n“Being into new age now is a reaction to punk,” John Fell Ryan says. Ryan plays in Excepter, a Brooklyn band whose sound encapsulates the history of weird Western music, from free improv to hard noise to dub-influenced drone. On the subject of new age, he's prankish and sly. “In my vision of the cosmos, you can’t just lay in the sun and let the waves wash over you. You might hear nature sounds, but nature turns out to be a dangerous place. Or there’s a beach,” he adds, referring to the Excepter album Black Beach, “but the beach is boring.”\n\nFor Ryan, new age is just like any other performance. Be entertained, be educated, return to the obligations and banalities of real life. (Douglas Mcgowan echoed the same sentiment, calling new-age pioneers like Iasos and J.D. Emmanuel as “lucid, savvy, down-to-earth people who are simultaneously connected to another world.”) I don’t see Ryan’s take as cynicism as much as a realist’s way of buffering themselves from cruelty. “Think about it,” he says. “There are teenagers now who have never known a time that wasn’t fucked up.”\n\nEmbed is unavailable.\n\nEvery Wednesday afternoon, Los Angeles resident Matthew McQueen drives west from Mount Washington to the studios of a Silver Lake radio collective called dublab, where he improvises a two-hour set of synthesizer music called “Mindflight Meditation”, live and on-air. The music is patient, growing from small kernels of sound into big waves that crash and dissolve into silence. “It’s healing music,” McQueen says. “It’s my mandatory mindscape vacation weekly take-a-break-from-the-stresses-of-everyday music.” It is, by some standard, new age.\n\nMcQueen, who performs under the name Matthewdavid and runs a small label called Leaving Records, is 29. He is the proud owner of a Himalayan salt lamp, likes to experiment with borscht, and believes that we as a culture are entering what some thinkers call the Age of Aquarius. He is an acolyte of Robert Anton Wilson’s 1977 book Cosmic Trigger, which posits reality as a “mutable” condition less like a brick or a baseball bat than a river or a dance (Wilson’s metaphors, not mine), and, along with the artist and musician Diva Dompe, parent of a month-old baby girl named Love.\n\nHe is, in short, a believer. He’s also self-aware enough to realize this and confident enough to not care. “People who are in it already know,” he says, referring to a loose community of artists, academics, musicians, “weird old freaks and new budding beautiful young hip kids” he’s connected with.\n\nLike Mcgowan and John Fell Ryan, McQueen sees the new new-age community as a refuge for people who once might’ve identified as punks. “Transients, burnouts, weird desert hippie mamas,” he says, conjuring the familiar tableaux of losers who make up the new-age community in the popular mind. “That connotation is in the past.”\n\nHe grew up on rap and is generally associated with L.A.'s Brainfeeder scene: alternatively-minded artists like Flying Lotus, Ras G, and Samiyam, who make instrumental hip-hop cross-pollinated with hippie jazz, noise, and the spiritualist outer reaches of electronic music. Recently, though, he's started devoting more of his time to the kind of beat-free, introspective music he plays each week on air.\n\nMcQueen is, by his own admission, into what he calls “the freaky stuff: UFOs, OOBEs, DMTs, etc!,” but he sees his personal search as tangential to his artistic one. The term “new age” is only relevant until it becomes an argument that sets us at a distance from the music. What he does on air and at home with his wife and his newborn at his side, he says, “is a pure thing, an easy thing—it’s music we make to assist our daily living.” I could judge him but I have no good reason to.\n\nFurther listening: Peter Davison: Music on the Way; Iasos: Inter-Dimensional Music, Enno Velthuys: A Glimpse of Light; Jon Bernoff & Marcus Allen: Breathe; Joanna Brouk: Healing Music; Constance Demby: Skies Above Skies; Steve Roach: Structures From Silence; J.D.
