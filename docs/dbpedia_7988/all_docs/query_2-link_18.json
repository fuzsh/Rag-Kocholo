        "text": "I’ve consciously been on a spiritual journey most of my life. I grew up in Los Angeles, and my parents raised me on the heels of ancient as well as new age wisdom. Throughout my teens I found my joy and passion in music; writing, recording, and touring in a pop punk band. We were signed to a record label, toured the country, and had our music on MTV and the radio. That was until I had my first “Aha” moment, a spiritual awakening, and realized I had never given any deep thought about life beyond the stage.\n\nWhen I was twenty I felt compelled to make the hardest decision of my life; to leave behind my childhood dream and pursue the understanding of a deeper truth. Being Jewish, I turned to my spiritual roots and moved to Jerusalem to study the essence of life. For over a decade I've had the blessing of connecting with some of the greatest minds, learning the treasures of profound Torah wisdom, and experiencing the light and love of Kabbalah and Chasidus. I was absorbing all the spiritual principles, practices and anything else that helped me align with my true purpose: to be a source of love and inspiration in the world.\n\nI have been blessed to write many books and share the stage with the most wonderful teachers in the world. My mission slowly came into focus, and today, all I want is to be truly helpful and share this life giving wisdom of unconditional love with you. To be a part of your own personal spiritual journey and empower you to awaken to a higher consciousness."
