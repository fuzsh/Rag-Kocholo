        "text": "We have finally reached our favorite holiday of the year – Allhallows Eve, or Halloween as it’s referred to in modern times. For the youngsters, the festivities are completed by dressing up as their favorite characters and obtaining as much candy as possible while Trick o’ Treating! However, for others, it’s the perfect opportunity to embrace the darkness and dwell in all things maniacal and evil! Whether it’s watching your favorite horror series or getting an ear full of brooding music, there is no other day quite like this. My favorite thing to do is to have a dark music marathon of new and old music, no matter the genre. If you’re like me, there is never a shortage of music to listen to but if you’re down for checking out something new, I’ve compiled a set of summary reviews for seven new releases that are bound to get you into a dark, atmospheric mood. I hope you enjoy these recommendations and please support all of these artists and the labels that provide a platform for their ominous craft.\n\n1. Halloween Scene – Issue No. 1-The Graveyard Manor\n\nIf you’re not spending Halloween with the sounds of spooky intent, then unfortunately you’ll not get to experience the full effects of the most ghostly night of the year. Thankfully, we have ‘Issue No. 1 – The Graveyard Manor’ by Halloween Scene to supplement our sinister audial needs. Over an hours worth of grim incantations of darkened ambience, this recording is just what we need to provide the eerie atmosphere for this special night. Whether it’s the ominous textures of “An Old & Gloomy Road”, “The Haunted Manor” and “An Eerie Secret Passage”, or the discordant soundscapes presented in “A Safe Room To Escape?” and “Cadavers Unearthed For Fiendish Reasons”, there is an uncanny presence though out that magnifies the intensity of this horror-filled evening. I hope that Halloween Scene continues to release these seasonal recordings, as it sets the mood perfectly.\n\n2. Onasander – Eltanin\n\nOnasander never fails to deliver the darkness and on the latest outing, ‘Eltanin’, we find a heavily drone-induced recording with the expansive elements of deep space ambience. Delivered in a soothing arrangement of flowing, broad textures, there is an ominous presence on each track that creates an unhinged barrier of menacing darkness. Tracks such as “Acrid” and “Council Of War” generate a dreamy scenario of comprehensive modulations akin to drifting in a celestial dimension, while “Ancient Nightsky” and “Outer Primitives” produce a range of eccentric soundscapes that may provoke a sense of fear. At any rate, this six track offering by Onasander is not only another amazing recording in his consistent discography, but it has a persistent sound direction that easily aligns with the theme of Hallows Eve.\n\n3. Dev-I-Ant – A Place Of Warmth And Tears\n\nSome Dark Ambient recordings are not meant for the squeamish; and by squeamish I mean those that are adversely triggered by haunting timbres and disturbing soundscapes. ‘A Place Of Warmth And Tears’ by Dev-I-Ant is a resounding journey through the macabre via unhinged, nightmarish textures and ominous field recordings. There is a frightful presence throughout this album that will send chills down your spine and may give your nightmares a nightmare. At almost seventy minutes in length, there is no escaping these terrifying modulations as they continuously elicit a sense of dread and provide jolts of disarray without any notice. Whether it’s Halloween or not, this is how Dark Ambient was intended to be played. If you think you’re ready for this menacing journey, then test the waters with tracks such as, “Carriage Of The Fox” and “The Room Of Despair”. These are prime examples of how disquieting this album is.\n\n4. Erythrite Throne – Forever At The Mercy Of Thy Abhorrent Cruelty\n\nErythrite Throne has never released anything short of amazing. After all, in my opinion, Erythrite Throne is the G.O.A.T. of modern Dungeon Synth. On ‘Forever At The Mercy Of Thy Abhorrent Cruelty’, Wyrm constructs six tracks of Medieval enchantment, with powerful orchestrations and somber emotions that are compelled to bring out a sense of ensorcelled sorrow. It’s inevitably special when you can produce a sound of lugubrious intent and captivating beauty at the same time. At just under an hour, these six long players succeed in setting a gloomy mood and maintaining it for the duration of the recording. Not only is Erythrite Throne a treat to experience all year round, it’s uniquely amazing to experience it during the Season Of The Witch as well, as it magnifies the intensity of the darkness and all of the evil it brings with it.\n\n5. Skuggkonungen – Skördetid\n\nSkuggkonungen, an adept purveyor in the realms of Dark Ambient and Dungeon Synth music, presents his latest recording of minimalistic ambient music called, ‘Skördetid’. As if endlessly adrift in a vivid, hallucinating dream, these six modulations are crafted with enlightened intent. The electronic spectrum is a hallowed spectacle on this recording as each track presents a variety of soundscapes and modulations that flow seamlessly into the next, offering a unique, emotional experience along the way. Whether it’s the cold, disturbing drones of “Den Sista Frosten” or the retro soundscapes of “Vilan”, this amazing album has something to offer for all fans of ambient music. As Halloween festivities present a fabric for chaos and unhinged enjoyment, ‘Skördetid’ can be listened to for winding down from all of the abrupt discord that may have played out previously. Needless to say, this is a beautifully ominous album that can be enjoyed at anytime!\n\n6. Mora-Tau – Music For Ghosts\n\nWhen it comes to ambient improvisations, Mora-Tau is one of the best in the business. ‘Music For Ghosts’ is no exception as it showcases a sense of disharmonic nostalgia in the form of three epic tracks. At seventy two minutes long, there is plenty of room to balance haunting atmospherics with audible storytelling. Just in time for Halloween, this album can be used a a backdrop for those bleak moments that are to be expected during this dark, festive season. With layers of dissonant synth leads, there is a particular grimness that lurks around every corner and nothing is as it seems while churning through these long players. At just over twenty one minutes, the lead off track, “The Water Dripping From The Veins Of A Leaf” is the shortest on the album, but sets an ominous mood for what’s left to come. The albums title track (and fitting closer for this amazing recording) is twenty six minutes of sporadic modulations that complete the soulful journey that only Mora-Tau can present so eloquently.\n\n7. Various Artists (Dustopian Frequencies) – Ghost Stories\n\nIn true Halloween fashion, Dustopian Frequencies presents ‘Ghost Stories’ a collection of tracks from four artists that go above and beyond the confines of basic presentation, by manifesting audial renditions of their favorite hauntings. With each song being around ten minutes in length, there is an endless space for translating these stories into magnificent audial performances that maintain the same level of impact. From Dark Ambient and Hauntology to Industrialized trance pieces, each convey a story or horror in their own unique way. My favorite amongst these transmissions is “Dullahan” by Everyday Dust. This whirlwind of a performance is a sonic journey through various modulations and sound sequences that are not only mesmerizing but paint a picture of a dystopian time where perpetual escapism becomes the norm and defeat by death exists at all costs. Each of the remaining tracks are high-level outings that demands the listeners attention with the utmost reward hanging in the balance.\n\nIf your seeking a label that incorporates a menagerie of artists from different backgrounds with a broad sense of musical direction, then look no further than Strange Mono Records. Releasing everything from Dungeon Synth and Ambient to Dream Pop and Extreme Metal, Strange Mono knows no boundaries and has safely provided a home for such artists since 2021. Since I’m always seeking the most obscure forms of music around, it’s no wonder that Strange Mono has resonated with me since the beginning. In order to pay homage to this amazing little label, I decided to write a few summary reviews on ten of their latest releases. These albums are all over the place but equally enjoyable – at least to these ears. Enjoy reading these reviews and please consider listening to and downloading some or all of these fantastic recordings.\n\n1. Forge Of Tears – Softly In This Vale Of Tears\n\nWhat’s more excruciating than a razor burn filled with rubbing alcohol and sealed with a gob of crazy glue? Probably two long form tracks of chaotic noise terror by way of Forge of Chains. With no compassion for delicate, tender moments, ‘Softly In This Vale Of Tears’ is thirty minutes of intense discord that is as addictive as it is disturbing. With an unrelenting wall of modulated audial pungency, Forge Of Tears produces a mesmerizing soundscape for a pallet of maniacal indulgence, not letting up from start to finish and only adjusting the molecular structure of things between tracks. At first you may be in disarray by the abrupt jolt of power but you’ll soon find yourself drawn into a world of corrupt audial sequences. This is a magnificent release on many levels.\n\n2. Grey Windowpane – Ice The World\n\n‘Ice The World’ presents nearly seventy minutes of abstract noise intrusion by way of ambient subtleties, haunting voice recordings and an array of soundscape to catapult this recording to its own unique design. As if being dragged through a vast world of distinct cultures and influences, Grey Windowpane finds a way to gratify all of the senses with a massive kaleidoscope of musical happenings. Presented in four elongated pieces, each track extends a sonic adventure of various themes but ultimate create a fabric of likeness and audial intimacy due to its compelling modulated bonding. This amazing album is the result of obscurity becoming an acceptable criterion of musical bliss.\n\n3. Thecia – My Sojourn Among The Torturers\n\nNow on to something more abrasive, as Thecia emits an angered, repugnant blend of distorted guitars, thick drum beats and destructive vocals in their brand of unrelenting Death Metal. ‘My Sojourn Among The Torturers’ presents three tracks of ripping metal that fuses Black and Death Metal with a tinge of classic Heavy Metal riffing. This mixing is both loudly askew and causticly raw – the only way to listen to metal in my opinion. The songwriting is incredible and they are perfectly lengthened to maintain headbanging integrity without becoming dry and sparse. I’m definitely looking forward to hearing more from this prominent act.\n\n4. Jonathan Patrick – Open Heart EP\n\nJonathan Patrick gives us an abridged taste of Americana on his soulful new EP, ‘Open Heart’. Featuring two tracks of heartwarming guitar compositions, I can imagine listening to these out in an early morning Midwest setting, where the Dawn of the sun of slightly obscured by thick fog and towering, natural forestry. These tracks sound new and refreshing while providing a proper callback to acoustic classic rock sounds from the 70’s and 80’s. Two tracks just isn’t enough and my hope is that the next Jonathan Patrick release has at least five hundred tracks on it. All jokes aside, this is simply incredible!\n\n5. Webb Chapel – Speeding\n\nWebb Chapel presents the unparalleled offering, ‘Speeding’, a lo-fi collection of alternative rock arrangements with obvious influences from synthwave, dark pop and electronica genres. This album sounds as if it could have literally been released in 1984. Even with the gnarled production, this entire albums is an addictive listen with impeccable songwriting and masterful musicianship. I could listen to these tracks over and over again without getting bored and as they say, the louder the better! This is a fantastic release that certainly deserves top tier recognition.\n\n6. Clang Quartet – A Slow Death For The Peacemaker\n\nI’ve only recently crossed paths with the musical endeavors of Clang Quartet, but it’s certainly been a pleasant experience getting to know the output of this artist, the values that he represents and the impactful delivery of the chaotic noise that is consistently presented. On ‘A Slow Death For The Peacemaker’, harsh noises are more conservative and are augmented by spoken word segments and bits of contemporary instrumental parts. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a sense of pandemonium, because this albums is a breakout achievement for the Noise Ambient genre. In between the more serene parts we can still find a massive wall of industrialized chaos that is hypnotizing as it is war piercing. This is a captivating album that has earned its praise, but demands so much more!\n\n7. Idiot Mambo – Flamingo In Limbo\n\n‘Flamingo In Limbo’ is a lighthearted soundtrack of summer rock & pop with a passion for shoegaze and low fidelity tones of the late 80’s. With whimsical instrumentation and jocular lyrics, this is a fun album that can be played and enjoyed on just about any occasion. Adding to the dynamics of these tracks are glitchy samples, hissing loops and slightly distorted melodies that all come clashing together in solid harmony. There are eleven tracks on this album and every single one of them portrays a slightly altered style, but at the same time, is very much an Idiot Mambo manifestation. Whether you need a vibe for a steamy summer drive, or some background music on a gloomy, rainy afternoon, ‘Flamingo In Limbo’ is a sure recommendation in order to facilitate an enlightened mood.\n\n8. Ruah – Ruwa\n\nStrange Mono continues to hit it out of the park with their consistent picks of amazing talent and Ruah is no exception. On ‘Ruwa’, Ruah continues to explore an array of genres to compliment the stellar vocal arrangements contained within. At times, they tread down the Darkwave path with gothic influences and undertones, while on some tracks, they emit a heavy Swans influence with repetitive music play and looping vocal deliveries. No matter what they’ve intended to explore, each track is an alluring endeavor that stands on its own while delivering an arcane composition with ominous intent. This album is totally captivating and it’s hypnotic effects will leave a lasting impression on the listener, while demanding repeated listens. Perfect for fans of The Swans, Vaura or 80’s Darkwave!\n\n9. Ixian – Collective Indiscipline\n\nWhat do you get when you combine harsh noise with Grindcore and Black Metal aesthetics? You get what’s known as unruly, dystopian cybergrind. As if just having one extreme genre wasn’t enough, Ixian goes all out on the pummeling new EP, ‘Collective Indiscipline’. As deranged as it may sound, there is actually a sense of atmospheric control amongst these tracks, as they provide an overwhelming sense of ominous disarray. Discordant tones and hyperactive drum beats create an onslaught of droll modulations. Although it’s only nineteen minutes in length, a back-to-back listen of all five tracks will have you perspiring an illusive sudor, while your brain continues to scramble in a desperate exodus of audial release. This is a very intriguing album and I would recommend this to fans of all forms of extreme music.\n\n10. Fugue State – Subtlety’s Dead\n\nFugue State presents an upbeat, grungy depiction of old-school punk rock. With reverberated vocals (reminiscent of early Les Claypool), fuzzy guitar tones and audial hisses all over the place, ‘Subtlety’s Dead’ is a proper call back to a time when music was routinely presented in raw form to represent the most jubilant crowds of fractious souls. Even at just sixteen minutes in length, there is enough output here to satisfy the tortured umbra that resides in all of us. This makes for a great driving album, especially when blasting it at loud volumes. Can’t wait to hear more from Fugue State in the near future.\n\nLinks:\n\nBC: https://strangemono.bandcamp.com\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/strange_mono?igshid=MmJiY2I4NDBkZg==\n\nMerch: https://strangemono.bigcartel.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/strangemono?s=21&t=XJy864ZhViZB0VAW0YrwBw\n\nI have lots of fun writing about my favorite labels in The Nebula Breviary column. Originally I intended for it to be a one-off publishing but due to the growth in the Dark Ambient and Dungeon Synth genres over the past few years, I plan to keep at it in order to showcase some of my favorites of both genres. For this particular publishing, I will feature ten exiting albums from the Taste Of Beer Records label. This up and coming label has produced a lot of exciting albums in both digital and physical formats and they continually deliver music from the tavern that surely appeals to an ever growing fan base. Thanks for reading this and I hope you enjoy these albums as much as I have.\n\n1. Goblin Mage – Charms & Devilry\n\n‘Charms & Devilry’ is an absorbing journey through enchanted forests, where mystical entities become your guide for captivating adventures. Minimalistic and soothing, these eight tracks present a light-hearted effort that elicits tones of mystic landscapes and rhythmic modulations that are part whimsical and part daring. Tracks such as “Strange Magick” and “Goblin Town” stand out as studious anthems that are memorable and truly representative of album as a whole. Recommended for fans of buoyant sounds and jaunty Dungeon Synth dirges.\n\n2. Helmet – Vanitas\n\nThe Medieval times were not always filled with gory battles and drama amongst royalty. When I think of the more ostentatious times, this is exactly the music that I envision being played. Relaxing melodies and soothing orchestrations are at the center of these simple, yet uniquely composed songs. With an eloquent tone that is reminiscent of lenitive landscapes and soft, breezy forests, ‘Vanitas’ is an entertaining effort that truly symbolizes the fulfilling life beyond the Keep and beyond the realms of battle. This will be a Dungeon Synth classic in the years to come.\n\n3. Vouivre – The Father Of Dragons-Glaurung\n\nTalking about a beautiful cinematic effort, ‘The Father of Dragons-Glaurung’ could easily be a soundtrack to a Medieval-inspired action movie. This robust album features four long-players that produce a theatric blend of Dungeon Synth intonations and intoxicating orchestrations. Beautiful produced, one could easily create their own feudal adventure, as these tracks weave through dark landscapes and harrowing Middle Ages creativity. Epic, to say the least, Vouivre has provided the ultimate audial accompaniment that certainly does this genre proud. You definitely don’t want to sleep on this one.\n\n4. Mushrooms – Between The Moss And The Sky\n\n‘Between The Moss And The Sky’ is a dainty little offering that resides in the Comfy Synth realm and it provides a playful antidote for the ears. I can imagine a rainforest in recovery, after the harshness of an autumn storm, where the raindrops faintly evaporate and the ground gives way to natural fungal growth. Content with its beautiful surroundings and exotic location off the hidden path, these tracks expand upon natures gift to mankind and the alluring endeavors that continue to evolve. Simple rhythms and dreamy synth leads will leave the listener mesmerized and wanting more.\n\n5. Assorted Potions & Deep Gnome – Threadmage’s Curious Encounter With The Fae Folk\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite Comfy Synth albums of the last few years. Not entirely whimsical, these consoling canticles have a particular enchanting tone that takes a somberly approach on its delivery, instead of being outright quirky. To make it even better, there are a couple of cover songs that are mouthwatering takes on a few Cheryl Crow and Enya classics. If you enjoy the more consoling side of Dungeon Synth, then be sure to check out this amazing project and album.\n\n6. Anadûnê – Durin, Father Of Dwarves\n\nFrom the Elminster camp, Anadûnê presents a sharper, more focused effort that is dark, menacing and at times gothic in tone. The four long-players that make up ‘Durin, Father Of Dwarves’ are a true calling to the traditional Dungeon Synth sound and comes complete with rhythmic percussive elements and layers of intoxicating instrumentation. This is a journey that demands to be revisited time and time again, and is one for the ages. Listening to tracks like ‘The Hammer Of Aulë” and “I Wander Alone” gets me exited for endless Medieval endeavors and all of the imaginative tales that come with it. I’m a big fan of this project and recommend this to all of the daring souls that wish to embark on mystifying musical adventures.\n\n7. Elminster & Meadow Grove – Winds Of Mages\n\nTwo of Dungeon Synth’s most prominent artists, Elminster & Meadow Grove have teamed up to present one of the ultimate collaboration projects of the genre. Two uniquely crafted artists, very distinct sounds and impeccable song writing on one mammoth of an album. ‘Winds Of Mages’ soars high and delivers a bold blend of darkness, magic and obscure electronic synths. Coherent modulations exude a capricious path of synth madness and haunting tales that need no narrative for understanding. As each track transparently flows into the next, it’s apparent that this is a high-scale output that needs a follow-up album (hint, hint). Another highly recommended album that is sure to get plenty of playing time in the foreseeable future.\n\n8. The Toadstool Elf – The Toadstool Elf\n\n‘The Toadstool Elf’ is a quaint, Comfy Synth offering that wondrously flows like a symphonic soundtrack of a mystical domain. With only five tracks and twenty two minute of playing time, there are heaps of entertaining, musical sections contained within to satisfy your whimsical needs. Boasting a dream-like production effort, there is a visible haze to these tracks, as if daydreaming of peaceful times, deep in a hidden forest of elves, mythical creatures and colorful landscapes. This is a serene album with enough harmonious sections to pique your interest.\n\n9. Forlorn Swordsman – Old School Lo-Fi Dungeon Music\n\nWhen it comes to Dungeon Synth – well music In general – I tend to resonate the most with lo-fi offerings that are raw, organic and in some cases, relatable to my emotional state. That being said, Forlorn Swordsman is right up my alley. Producing an hour long blend of Dungeon Synth and Comfy Synth, ‘Old School Lo-Fi Dungeon Music’ is not only aptly named, but in a sense, a completely dark & eerie experience. These tracks are not flimsily thrown together at all, as they are masterfully orchestrated with bits of melody and chaos – all at the same time. Standout tracks include “Cross The Sorrowfields”, “Dreams Of Old Times” and “Made Free By The Blade”. I hate that I missed out on the cassette version of this, as it would have sounded perfect on my old shoebox cassette player. At any rate, this is an exquisite release and it doesn’t get more lo-fi than this.\n\n10. Onfang – Audible Mending\n\n‘Audible Mending’ is a unique Comfy Synth offering that features dreamy vocal performances, tranquil synth effects and a song called “The Last Narwhal”. How can you not like an album that feature a song about the rare, Arctic sea creature? Containing six electrifying songs, they each stand out in their own way and envelop all of the traditional Dungeon Synth aesthetics. Haunting and whimsical, this album produces an array of emotions that extends beyond Medieval realms and encapsulating forests while allowing the listen to sink into their own imagination. Another great release from Taste Of Beer Records!\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://tasteofbeerrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://instagram.com/tasteofbeerrecords?igshid=NDk5N2NlZjQ=\n\nFor some reason, trees seem to be synonymous with all things spooky and evil. Whether it’s a darkened forest in a horror movie, or the ruffling of leaves in an evening breeze that has us looking over our shoulders for something creepy, trees create a space of frightening imagination with limitless potential for purpose. For Halloween, trees portray a gruesome shadow in the night that causes goosebumps and chills when not expected. Remember the tree in the original Poltergeist film? They also create a blockade for hiding behind so that you can jump out and scare your friends while trick or treating. Whatever the case may be, trees serve more of a purpose than the ecology for their existence. Like trees, music provides the same escape by enticing an imaginative spark for which you can escape from reality. That’s exactly the case for these twelve chilling albums. They are the soundtrack for the season and so much more. Please enjoy these summary reviews and show your support for these artists by downloading their killer albums. Happy Halloween!! 🎃\n\n1. Lamp & Dagger – This Tape Is Haunted Too!\n\nLamp & Dagger is back with their second spooktacular collaboration, featuring a handful of ominous artists that aim to frighten your very existence. From Sombre Arcane’s psychedelic massacre to a modicum of Dark Ambient soundscapes from The Night Keep that feature morbid field recordings and samples. FVRFVR offers a chip tune spectacle that is part crypt hop and part nostalgic cinema. Whispering Mirror offers a droning canticle full of gruesome modulations, while Halm conjures up some disgusting field recordings to create a gruesome scene of terror. The final track by Spectral Manse proposes a climactic ending with eerie narrations, malevolent haunts and lots of dark melody that penetrates deep in the psyche, proving that the sequel is just as damning as the original offer. I’ll never get enough of these compilations so I’m already looking forward to Halloween 2023.\n\n2. Guild Of Lore – Night Of Halloween\n\nDungeon synth stalwart, Guild Of Lore, steps beyond the realm of Winterstead, leaving behind the Medieval intonations to embrace a world of 80’s-influenced synthwave with elements of cinematic horror. The results are a fascinating blend of B-horror movie anthems full of ghoulish field recordings, theatrical samples and rhythmic patterns that scream the elements of classic horror film soundtracks. “Lurking In The Shadows” is a prime example of ample beats, darkwave undertones, and retrospective synths, while “The Festivities” is done in the style of a skit, with spooky narrations, haunting screams and bleak atmospherics. This is an album that’s not just enjoyable during All Hallows’ Eve, but can provide eerie entertainment throughout the year, and for many years to come.\n\n3. Erythrite Throne – A Shade Of Melancholy In The Shadow Of Death\n\nIf your not listening to Erythrite Throne on All Hallows’ Eve, then you’re either very much afraid or have already been bitten by a post-apocalyptic zombie. In the case of the latter, perhaps ‘A Shade Of Melancholy In The Shadows Of Death’ has become the perpetual soundscape for your existence. Expertly fusing classical synth tones and the occasional blasts of tasty percussion, this is another magnum opus from the master of Dungeon Synth music. Just as the title suggests, this album is a bit more lugubrious than other Erythrite Throne albums, but that’s what makes this project so special. Especially on Halloween, this is some classically creepy music to enjoy on this malevolent night.\n\n4. Aleksis Tristan Shaw – Crooked Teeth\n\nThe ever so cleaver Aleksis Tristan Shaw once again keeps us on our toes with a musical endeavor that defies genre categorization but is presented just in time for Halloween. These three tracks showcase beautiful, yet twisted piano melodies with a dreamy, atmospheric production. Just as the album cover suggests, I can only imagine a blurry figure sitting behind the ivories and playing these dirges to conjure up the spirits of ancient past, allowing them to provide frights once again. Although each track is different, they each have a thematic element that maintains a dark but elegant mood. A full album of these ghastly sounds would be awesome as well.\n\n5. Wodenwyrd – The Teutoburg Massacre\n\nWodenwyrd presents a rather unique recording as a short narrative is read over obscure backing tracks that fusses Dungeon Synth, Dark Ambient and synthwave. Read over a series of Acts (seven in all), the story summarizes the first battle between German forces and the Roman Empire around 9 AD. As compelling as the story is, the music fits perfectly and produces a brooding gray background for a malevolent narrative. There are three stand alone tracks that serve as an intro, intermission and outro and they explore more nostalgic territories such as 80’s cinema and dreamy effects. In all, this is a fantastic album and I wouldn’t mind having a series of recordings in this style.\n\n6. Born From Pain – Begotten (1989)\n\nJust in time for Halloween, Born From Pain delivers another compelling motion picture re-score. This time, 1989’s horror/fantasy film, ‘Begotten’, becomes the object of creativity as the quest for Dark Ambient obscurity reigns supreme. Over seventy two minutes of ethereal order becomes the pallet for rediscovering this film in a more sinister light. The film itself, is supremely bleak and a boldly obscure statement for cinema at the time of its release. If your a fan of cult filmmaker, Maya Deren, then you’ll have a good understanding of this film. As for the music, Born From Pain masterfully captures that essence with gloomy soundscapes and haunting effects that will lead to nightmarish outcomes in itself. Another fascinating adventure that I can’t recommend enough.\n\n7. Scott Lawlor – The Livestream Series, Volume V\n\nScott Lawlor, the king of spatial Drone music and a jack-of-all-trades Ambient musician that never stops working and has enough released material to create the soundtrack to your very existence for years on end. On Halloween of last year, he produced a five hour livestream special that will be digitally released on Halloween this year. Spanning eleven tracks, this colossal of an album, flows like a never ending experiment through celestial voids and dark passages, as enigmatic effects combine with baneful textures to create the realm you’ve always dared to travel through. Each track presents a malefic journey through dark regions of the subconscious, bringing a terrorized reality to the forefront of the mind. Good luck getting through all five hours of this but enjoy the breathtaking adventure along the way.\n\n8. Orcchasm – OrcChasm!\n\nOrcchasm is truly unique experience, as we encounter a variety of musical intonations during this thirty one minute endeavor. From creepy ambience and whimsical synths to bazaar arrangements and nonstop frills, this is a musical adventure that is equally enjoyable and fulfilling. From grandiose, Medieval incantations to light, flute fills, you never know what direction the music is headed. However, hold on to your witches hat and broomsticks because this is a venture that won’t want to miss. Each track flows seamlessly into the next, showcasing a story of dark dungeons and numerous escapades. “Groping For Wild Hogs In The Dark Paphian Abyss” is my favorite track and it truly represents the musical prowess of this album as a whole. Don’t pass up on this warm journey into the wildly unknown.\n\n9. Pumpkin Witch – The Return Of The Pumpkin Witch\n\nIt’s been a few years since we’ve heard from Halloween favorite, Pumpkin Witch. However, after finally rising from the Orange tomb of seasonal vegetation, they’ve returned with their most enigmatic spectacle to date, ‘The Return Of The Pumpkin Witch’. Eleven spooky anthems that provide an audial bludgeoning for almost forty four minutes, these progressive haunts are just what the doctor (or vampire or serial killer) has ordered to infiltrate your Halloween playlists. From distorted, doom-laden guitar tones and retrospective drum beats to hair raising electro sequences and synthwave tactics, this is the album that checks all the blocks for horrifying entertainment. Tape hisses and reverberated production efforts create a sinister ambiance that drives the mail in the coffin (no pun intended) for this masterful recording.\n\n10. Ammothea – My God Is The Moon\n\nAmmothea, the ambient-infused post metal project by Glacial Anatomy, is truly a riveting encounter that satisfies the pallet of those that enjoy the multi-genre experience. Soft, careening vocals, doom metal riffing and dreamy production yields a hypnotic effect, so that you can sit back, close your eyes and indulge in your own trip. These five tracks disperse almost sixty four minutes of playing time but, it’s over before you know it due to being completely lost in the mix of these alluring intonations. “Depth” and “My God Is The Moon” are standout tracks that incorporate a more upbeat approach without diverting away from the haunting gray that the entire album discharges. This is an extremely impressive release and I’m already looking forward to more from this artist.\n\n11. Whöreplay – Whöreplay\n\nA good dark wave tune goes hand in hand with the Halloween season, given its close ties to Gothic romanticism, vampires and grim landscapes. It also has provided bleak, atmospheric backdrops for scenes in classic horror films such as ‘Silence Of The Lambs’. This two track spectacle from newcomer, Whöreplay, fits right in with all of the aforementioned. Although only five minutes long, the artists wastes no time setting the listener on a collision course with haunting electronics, reverberated vocals, and a dreamy production. These tracks slice through like a jagged dagger, leaving a spot of coagulated blood for the creatures of the night to feast on.\n\n12. Unsheathed Glory/Ozeregroth – Nights Shadow Darkening\n\nThere is no better time to come together for delivering a darkened dungeon synth experience than Halloween. Unsheathed Glory and Ozeregroth combine their talents of Medieval summonings to render a five track split album, culminating in twenty four minutes of effortless canticles set to the gloomiest night of the year. Not only does each artist produce two tracks of their own, but they collaborate on the daunting self title track. Although each artist delivers contrasting tones, they mesh together very well and and flow transparently with ominous accord. This is one of my favorite Dungeon Synth collaborations of the year and I hope these artist get together again in the future, to produce more music like this.\n\nAdditional forest photos courtesy of Carlton Whittle Photography. Please follow him on IG:\n\nThe main article image is a unique creation from the WOMBO Dream APP.\n\nKalamine Records has been delivering stunning releases on its Bandcamp page since 2019. The online label from Bordeaux, France specializes in Dark Ambient, Noise, Experimental music as well as a vast array of obscure genres that migrate well off the beaten path. Producing top quality material on a regular basis, it’s difficult for me to schedule these albums for a normal review as I simply don’t have the time. However, with the introduction of this column last month and the multitude of spectacular albums that Kalamine Records have put out as of late, the timing was right for me to pick ten of these albums for summary reviews. I hope you enjoy this article and please check out Kalamine Records at the links below.\n\n1. Mono Hideout – True Lord\n\n‘True Lord’ is a thirty three minute session of adversarial ambience that depicts a dystopian atmosphere of chaos and evil. Although these tracks are shorter than the typical Dark Ambient intonation, the urgency of soundscape buildup and dismal drones fuel a fire of angst-laden heresy that are compelling as much as they are effective at providing huge, atmospheric settings. From celestial & spirited pieces like “Harpocrates” to sinister and minimalistic drones of “The Snake Himself”, Mono Hideout has fabricated a world of dark malevolence.\n\n2. Helecho Experimentar – OU.. OU.. Sintaxis\n\nHelecho Experimentar combines ominous sound effects, samples and controlled noise on the brilliant release, ‘OU… OU… Sintaxis’. Commencing with a thirty six minute opus that forges a tumultuous passage through layers of obscure musical stanzas, this album presents a relentless impression of restrained noises and hasty modulations. Truly a unique recording, this will soon become an addictive listen as the effort to notice additional peculiarities throughout, are inevitable.\n\n3. Mora-Tau – The Five Sutra\n\nMora-Tau has quickly become one of my favorite Dark Ambient composers and his ever-growing catalog of consistently great recordings is something to be proud of. ‘The Five Sutra’ is another paradigm of esoteric compositions that slowly portrays a story of tragedy through elongated drones, repetitive synth manipulations and a deep venture into angst-filled arrangements. This collection of retrospective anthems provide almost two hours of listening pleasure, allowing the listener enough time to mediate in its thought-provoking sound.\n\n4. Eijra Woon – Leïla\n\n‘Leïla’ is a compelling offering of Dark Ambient, drone, noise, glitch and a touch of EDM, all wrapped up in a audial adventure that is both seductive and thought provoking. Haunting samples and various spots of vocalizations complete this mesmerizing collection of sonic objects that will leave the listener in a relaxed state at times, as well as emitting bouts of angst during other times. These twelve tracks ebb and flow into various emotive states and the harrowing soundtrack that ensues, is sonically unparalleled. Upon completion of this sixty five minute opus, the listener may become paralyzed with emotional shock and drenched in sweat from sheer survival of the audial jolt that took place.\n\n5. HEL – Innocently Wicked\n\nHEL incorporates a plethora of vocal manipulations to establish a baseline of obscure ambient for showcasing a provocative blend of harmonizing textures and meaningful poetry. This anomalous recording also includes a variety of field recordings and effects to round out this massively peculiar effort. Taking a cappella to extreme realms, HEL emits an uncompromising take on enigmatic, yet experimental music. Highly recommended for those that are brave enough to indulge in uncompromising reaches into evanescent realms.\n\n6. Christian Fiesel – Barren Land\n\n‘Barren Land’ sounds like a dismal exploration into mystical territories during the cultivation of 70’s or 80’s progressive-influenced synthwave. Vast wastelands are brought to light with soothing orchestrations and mesmerizing drones, as tranquil modulations produce a landscape of effervescent bliss and slow-moving sequences. This one hour long track is a lot to consume, but is equally rewarding and ominous sections fuse together in a single instance, as if wandering various rooms in a mansion, searching for clues to a portentous and puzzling storyline. One thing that remains constant throughout is the vibrant drones that seem peaceful and resonant.\n\n7. Philippe Simon – Amarante\n\n‘Amarante’ is a colossal offering of minimalistic Dark Ambience that stretches beyond the imagination and pushes the boundaries of atmospheric synth music. At almost eighty minutes in length, these seven tracks produce a transient environment of electronic music that combine Berlin School, drone, space ambient and quirky effects with resilient results. As these long players unwind, a deluge of celestial textures tell a haunting story of abandonment and foreboding solitary confinement. These songs are equally soothing and enthralling to say the least and once you begin this epic journey, it’s hard to stop. Enjoy this sonic masterpiece and the reward is well worth the endurance.\n\n8. Wasatch Front – I Walked Up Stairs\n\n‘I Walked Up Stairs’ showcases a fascinating blend of Dark Ambient, industrialized soundscapes and contained noise. This is not one to relax to or have on as background music. Wasatch Front demands your full attention to the oblivion contained within these five tracks to fathom a true understanding of the audial depth that they collectively offer. Each track takes a grueling approach to the intricacies of obscurity as the listener ascends a staircase into the unknown. As the music breeches the subconscious, a perilous adventure awaits. However, be forewarned; what goes up, must come down.\n\n9. Hostile Surgery – Into A Cold Light\n\n‘Into A Cold Night’ contains six protracted anthems that extend to almost eighty minutes of playing time. These masterful drones mirror a creativity of malevolent proportions as they represent a barrage of hostile actions that can only be portrayed in nightmares. From deafening modulations to wavering sound effects, there is a certain demise that becomes paramount when indulging in its menacing grasp. Although each of these tracks produce a unique listening experience, the results for all of them is the same- dark, brooding ambience with rugged atmospherics that will leave the listener is a gloomier state than before listening to this massive recording.\n\n10. Glamourie – Imaginal Stage\n\n‘Imaginal Stage’ may just be one of my favorite recordings from Kalamine Records. It combines dark and light ambient with a touch of acoustic folk music and even some forest synth and there is so much variation on this album, it’s hard to grasp within a few listens. However, upon multiple listens, you’ll begin to experience a decaying, yet soothing journey into assorted realms of audial reassurance. On the downloadable version of this album, each track is combined with a beautiful, mystical painting that truly represents the soundscape that affectionately makes its way through the speakers (or headphones). This is such a delightful album and I highly recommend this for those that need a peaceful, meditative source to accompany them in their life excursions.\n\nWebsite: https://KalamineRecords.com\n\nWelcome to The Nebula Breviary! For starters, I’m not sure if this will be a continuous column or just a one-off publishing. In either case, I wanted to create something where I could spotlight an artist that is involved in a variety of projects, with a steady amount of releases. I couldn’t think of a better entity than Ithildin Tape Production. The home of Dungeon Synth maestro Elminster, Ithildin Tape Production is the mainstay of many other activities that performs in the Dungeon Synth realm and beyond. Enjoy these summary reviews of some of the many projects from Ithildin Tape Production!\n\n1. The Owl Knight – Chamber Of The Starplotter\n\nOne thing I love about this release, is that it covers a lot of ground although being very compositionally minimalistic. This assortment of flavors included winter synth, raw Dungeon Synth and nominal chip tune without the cheerful undertones. The constant tape hiss gives off a nostalgic vibe and the flow from track-to-track is well thought out. You’ll definitely be reminiscing through retrospective Medieval content and this truly sounds like something that could be played in a deep, dingy dungeon. This one is worth checking out and adding it to your collection is a must.\n\n2. Elminster – Caern Mist\n\nElminster, the flagship project of Ithildin Tape Production, sends a mesmerizing reminder as to why this is one of the best, traditional Dungeon Synth projects out right now. ‘Caern Mist’ is an exceptional release that features a range of dynamic orchestrations and light-hearted patterns that are enough to sooth the soul. These lengthy tunes drift in slow motion as if waiting for the seasons to change or the lapse in light as day fades to nocturnal bliss. Beautifully produced and elegantly composed, this album is a true testament of the mature path traveled for Elminster.\n\n3. Muzgash – Hymn Of Hithlum\n\nThis is one of those recordings that you can turn on and then get lost in its vast atmospherics. A soothing ambience starts this twenty one minute long track and then it faintly reforms into a juggernaut of ritualistic beats and hypnotic loops that will keep you sedated for the duration on the track. Hints of Dungeon Synth effects are scattered throughout in a tasteful manner, as to not take away from the complete submersion of this audial spectacle. I would love to hear more from this project, especially if this is the material we have to look forward to.\n\n4. Mahomet Renatus – Ire Of The Crescent Reborn\n\n‘Ire Of the Crescent Reborn’ is an interesting blend of lo-fi Black Metal and sparse Dungeon Synth undertones. Minimalistic in approach, these three tracks complete a 20 minute cycle of trance-inducing wall of noise that is more of a controlled chaos that an all out blitzkrieg. The drums shift between blast beats and industrial thumps that maintains a deafening cadence. Overall a good release but the faster parts definitely stand out and create a whirlwind of noise that’s addictive and refreshing.\n\n5. In Dusk’s Embrace – Earth End’s Pantheon\n\nAtmospheric, primitive and seductive are a few words that come to mind while spinning ‘Earth End’s Panthron’. This thirty four minute opus is a single-track, tour de force of atmospheric black metal that is a melting pot of twisted & sinister riffs, ambient textures and grainy vocals that redirects the listener to early incantations of icy cold Black Metal. Other than a quaint acoustic intro and outro, this track procures a relentless pace and delivers top quality low fidelity music. I highly recommend this recording for those that love that old school necro sound.\n\n6. Moss Keep – The Curtain Of Time\n\n‘The Curtain Of Time’ exhibits two long-players of primordial Dungeon Synth with the essence of Medieval yearnings. Complete with hisses, cracks & pops of ancient recordings, the music leans on the side of melancholic compositions with somber soundscapes and a passion for mellow, emotive terrain. With both tracks extending beyond the thirteen minute mark, these depressive dirges are best heard on a dark, dreary day where emptiness is of the essence. This is a very entertaining release and amongst my favorites by Moss Keep.\n\n7. Howling Mire – Answering The Hidden Summons\n\n‘Answering The Hidden Summons’ is like an album of distraught ellegies, assembled for those mournful souls lost in ancient battles. The keyboard work throughout this album is amazing and truly showcases a sophisticated effort from the Ithildin Tape Production camp. Complete with background hisses to supplement the overall dismal ambience, these four tracks are over before you know it, even though totaling almost thirty minutes worth of music. Save this one for a rainy day and it will fit right in.\n\n8. Dyvyná – Within The Walls Of The Promised Kingdom\n\nFrom the music to the art work, this has the Renaissance era written all over it. Crisp synth leads and dreamy effects solidifies a haunting atmosphere of bright, effervescent colors. There is a slight reverb on the instrumentation as well, emitting a powerfully thick sound that aligns perfectly with the production efforts. This Dyvyná project is definitely one to look out for and an extensive catalog of music is already building up.\n\n9. Whispers Of Umbar – Hail The Voidlord\n\nWhispers Of Umbar is one of my favorite projects from Ithildin Tape Production. There is just something about that primitive sound that blurs the line between Dungeon Synth and Dark Ambient that brings joy to these ears. ‘Hail The Voidlord’ is a near twenty seven minute experience that is crafted in noise and brutal harmonics that produces visions of bleak landscapes and unfathomable bloodshed. By the time this insane track is over, you’ll need a nap and a chalice of spirits before your next listening experience.\n\n10. Üvegszakadás – In The Ashes Of The Fallen Empire\n\n‘In The Ashes Of The Fallen Empire’ is a mammoth of an album, especially in regards to previous releases in the Ithildin Tape Production catalog. Almost an hour and forty minutes of granular Dungeon Synth that feels like a massive compression chamber of ghastly intonations that are sequentially summoning Medieval spirits for an upcoming apparitional raid. Haunting melodies compounded by wobbly effects and battle-ready cadences, this is an imposing outing that is sure to become a fan favorite.\n\n11. Sorrow Of The Moon – Hávamál\n\n‘Hávamál’ is one of six Sorrow Of The Moon demo’s released this year (thus far), each containing a single track ranging from twelve to twenty minutes of playing time. This project is a firm mashup of Elminster and Üvegszakadás, with its own production value that is gothic influenced and completely introspective. What I do love is the upbeat nature of this demo and how complete it sounds, with regards to the traditional Dungeon Synth sound. This is one that I can easily play over and over again without getting tired of it.\n\n12. Maeglin – Screams Of A Frozen Heart\n\nUnlike the other Black Metal releases on Ithildin Tape Production, Maeglin infuses more distorted guitar chords and focuses on melody and song structure, instead of trance-like atmospherics. The results – at least for ‘Screams Of A Frozen Heart’ – is that it’s more focused, catchy and quite enjoyable. There are definitely some Dungeon Synth undertones, specifically in the intro and various spots throughout the release. However, they are used more of as a background discord than being the focal point of the music. This is another admirable release from ITP!\n\nCassettes Can Be Purchased Here:\n\nhttps://ithildintapeproduction.bigcartel.com\n\nFrom the distant reaches of the macrocosm, I bring you another planetary offering of Dark Ambient summary reviews. This batch of Celestial Ephemerides offers a copious selection of mystical performances that surges deep in the spheres of dimly lit voids. From noise and ritualistic to supernatural soundscapes and haunting field recordings, this is the most impressive gathering of Dark Ambient albums I’ve had the pleasure of reviewing in a while. Hope you enjoy!\n\n1. Pillars Of Golden Misery – ‘Riders Of Misfortune’\n\n‘Riders Of Misfortune’ is a majestic blend of discordant algorithms and resounding clamor in this abrasive but enjoyable offering. Served on a tumultuous platter of indignant ambience, this recording is not for the faint of heart or those with sensitive hearing. Piercing effects and elongated droning produce a disquieting pulse of audial horror that is as punishing as it is enthralling. Highly recommended for fans of harsh noise, glitch and transfixing avant-garde.\n\n2. VSSP – ‘Modular Performances’\n\n‘Modular Performances’ is such a fitting title for this massive collection of ambient tunes from VSSP. Innovative, tranquil, dreamy and calming are other adjectives that also accurately describe this seventy three minute offering that traverses the drone, space ambient and dark ambient genres. One thing that is predominant on this recording is the real sense of melody in each track. The emotional feeling is almost heartbreaking and sorrowful but extremely compelling to listen to. Highly recommended for background music on a cold, rainy day or while relaxing with the intent to cleanse the mind of negative thoughts.\n\n3. Sana Obruent – ‘Aftoktonia’\n\nTo these ears, this is one of the most complete Drone Ambient recordings I’ve heard in a long time. Aside from a few other artists, Sana Obruent is quickly becoming my go-to artist for epic drone excursions due to the prominent foray into meditative resonance. Minimalistic & simple, yet effective and powerful, ‘Aftoktonia’ is over one hundred minutes of reflective musings that brings together powerful drones and circadian effects that is as relaxing as it is strident. This is one of my favorite Ambient albums of 2022 and probably will remain that way for many years to follow.\n\n4. Underwater Sleep Orchestra – ‘The Night And Other Sunken Dreams’\n\nUnderwater Sleep Orchestra, the new, brooding collaboration between Cities Last Broadcast and God Body Disconnect is a seventy eight minute magnum opus of polarizing dark ambient music. From hypnotizing drones to warm soundscapes, this is a project that I cannot wait to hear more from. These songs are lethargic and melodic and are a bit different from the typical dark ambient setting. You can definitely hear the input of each artist as they bring their signature sound to this musical alliance. Can’t recommend this one enough, especially if you’re looking for something to listen to while drifting off to never never land.\n\n5. Leila Abdul-Rauf – ‘Phantasiai’\n\nIt’s not often we get a fascinating album with trumpet and glockenspiel performances, but here we are. ‘Phantasiai’ is a spellbinding album of bleak expression with chilling vocals and dreamy production. Cyclic Law continues to recruit the finest artist that are ready to deliver the best of their craft. Thankfully we have Leila Abdul-Rauf to continue the flow and this album fits in with a long list of stellar releases.\n\n6. O Saala Sakraal – ‘Heven’\n\nThe concept of improvisation by O Saala Sakraal is a must listen and ‘Heven’ is one of those albums that will draw the listener in based on the sheer amazement of the unknown. Although only 21 minutes long, this collection of spontaneous incantations is both ritualistic and engaging. Soothing vocal parts with sinister narrations coalesce with haunting atmospherics to provide a post-apocalyptic feel without sounding dilapidated. I can’t wait to hear more from this artist and thanks again to Cyclic Law for continuing to release amazing albums like this.\n\n7. Muhd – ‘Dilogia’\n\n‘Dilogia’ is another prime example of hypnotic ambience that builds in layers to achieve a fusion of synthwave and dark ambient excellence. Warm, harmonizing drones go through an assembly of thickening tones and modulated soundscapes to produce emotion canticles that represent an exceptional blend of retro and futuristic synth virtue. Also from the Cyclic Law label, it’s no wonder why this album made it into the lineup as it sounds fresh, inviting and completely divergent.\n\n8. Yuko Nakai – ‘Me, And The Waters’\n\nThere is nothing more soothing than the blissful sounds of crystal bowls, harmonizing with natural soundscapes. Yuko Nakai excels in this area with a splendid three-track EP, ‘Me, And The Waters’. Fusing the sound of crashing ocean waves with extended hums of crystal bowls, beautifully arranged songs of scenic allure expel a magnitude of harrowing sequences that lure the listener in with unimaginable power. My only wish is that this album was about an hour long in order to fully appreciate its hypnotizing effect. Highly recommended for a deep, meditative experience.\n\n9. Gdanian – ‘Submersion’\n\nGdanian is a new edition to the Cryo Chamber label lineup and upon initial listen, I can confirm that it’s the perfect label to release an album as alluring as this one. An oceanic-themed outing, ‘Submersion’ pulls no punches with including aquatic soundscapes and sub-surface atmospherics. Beautifully produced, each track immerses the listener into a vast world of unexplored adventure. With the feeling of unimaginable depth, there is no choice but to sit back and soak in (no pun intended) the bleak soundscapes and minimalistic drones. An amazing recording that should not be overlooked.\n\n10. Lētum – ‘The Face Of Life And Death’\n\nLētum presents a cinematic nightmare of an album with ‘Tue Face Of Live And Death’. A conglomerate of disturbing samples and soundscapes backed by malevolent drones and pads. Horrifying vocal sequences are enough to to disrupt your sleeping pattern and send you down a vortex of enraged evil and madness. Coupled with theatric production values, this is a highly professional offering from one of Dark Ambient’s independent achievers. Recommended for Dark Ambient fans that don’t mind being on edge during a whole albums worth of menacing intonations.\n\nThe main article image is a unique creation from the WOMBO Dream APP.\n\nHope all is well and please enjoy this latest round of Dungeon Synth summary reviews. I know that many of these absolutely deserve a full review. However, being a one-man shop, periodically doing these Celestial Ephemerides articles is the best way for me to keep up with the high review demand. These ten albums are all very intriguing and different in their own right, but are still firmly planted in the mysterious genre that we all know and love.\n\n1. Countryside Views – ‘Mountain Country Memories’\n\nThis comfy synth projects takes us to far away hills and farmland settings in this tranquil synth outing. Featuring field recordings of the peaceful endeavors of country living, this album will make almost anyone feel right at home in the serene setting of all things nature. Elongated droning keyboards and crisp, enjoyable synths complete this reposeful recording and provides the feeling of refreshment and undisturbed emotions. ‘Mountain Country Memories’ is perfect for creating a placid start to your day or just having a moment of calmness.\n\n2. Ferrydor Archive – ‘Tale Of The Foolish Dreamer’\n\nAnother multi faceted outing that moves Dungeon Synth music beyond the blurred lines of tradition and incorporates a slew of other styles and techniques. From ambience, whimsical interludes to modulations composed of chip tune technique, ‘Tale Of The Foolish Dreamer’ is an impressive album that could very well be a soundtrack for a fantasy-based story. Sometimes cheerful and sometimes somber, it is unequivocally a meticulous synth recording that has superlative elements of classical compositions.\n\n3. Arcanist – ‘Poseidonis’\n\nThe purveyor of multi-genre greatness, Archanist, surpass all expectations on the darkly fantastic offering, ‘Poseidonis’. From lush, textured synths to Berlin school sequences, this album runs the gamut of soulful and emotional sounds that exclude melody and magnified feelings. Each track produces a unique vibe while maintaining a constant, bleak posture. A wonderful, modern take on Dungeon Synth aesthetics while brilliantly weaving in retro synthwave, this album is an instant classic and is sure to be a fan favorite for all.\n\n4. Landstrykar – ‘A Walk Amidst The Cairns’\n\nOver an hours worth of well crafted, beautifully orchestrated music, ‘A Walk Amidst The Cairns’ is an epic release that transcends any genre. Even though it’s rooted in Dungeon Synth, these soothing tracks emit an energy of classical instrumentation and exuberant scenes of endless landscapes and peaceful times. This is the perfect album to have for filling the void of background ambience, or slipping away into a meditative bliss. This is top quality synth music and is highly recommended.\n\n5. Lunar Cult – ‘Death Cannot Contain You’\n\n‘Death Cannot Contain You’ is a hefty collection of quirky canticles with ominous undertones and endless exploration of synth madness. Watch what’s lurking around every corner, as these tunes provide the soundtrack for lurking evil and heinous ambition. Nearly forty five minutes of non-stop keyboard and percussive repose, these tracks offer an impressive melding of various instruments sounds and effects to bring forth a sense of gritty contentment. Don’t pass on this album as if offers an audial satisfaction like no other.\n\n6. The Sage Of Seers – ‘Watching From Within’\n\nThe Sage Of Seers hit the jackpot with this release as it’s one of the most momentous collection of tracks I’ve heard in a while. Heavy use of reverb give it a huge wall-of-sound feel and the instrumentation is performed in a flawless, mesmerizing way. Songs such as “As I Slept Upon The Ancient Barrow” and “The Path Leads To The Light” pay homage to quaint, Medieval settings, while “Under The Frozen Lake” contains Dark Ambient passages and idiosyncratic effects. Very impressive release that covers an array of genres without sounding fatigued or over played.\n\n7. Thalmar – ‘Pried From Winter’s Frost Laden Grip’\n\nStrident, lo-fi project from the Ithildin Tape Production camp, Thalmar epitomizes the despotic side of Dungeon Synth with epic, grinding tracks of looping discord. Creating an uneasy approach to layering with a consternation of bleak arrangements, ‘Pried From Winter’s Frost Laden Grip’ is a disturbing audial ride through chaos and the horrors of Medieval battles. Edgy production that borders on tense distortion and restive modulated impulses, this is the ultimate album for your dark inquisitions.\n\n8. Fantoma Sânge – ‘The Siren Of Black Lake’\n\nFantoma Sânge takes the listener on a colossal adventure that is part whimsical and part theatrical. From big sounds to quirky arrangements, this is a twenty four minute excursion that you don’t want to miss. Jubilant drums and massive synth tones pave a path toward eccentric oblivion while the lo-fi production maintains a tradition of Medieval spirit. Don’t pass up this dainty little offering and enjoy all the turns and twists along the way.\n\n9. Chamber Of Sorrows – ‘Guardian Of The Realm’\n\nProduced with a sense of isolation, this gritty offering presents a cloudless perspective of ancient times. Full of sorrow and melancholy, these tunes range from light-hearted dirges to jarring compositions that truly reflect life back in ancient times. With an array of synth effects and tonal changes, ‘Guardian Of The Realm’ is a complete listening experience and will surly meet all of your Dungeon Synth needs and desires.\n\n10. Disemballerina – ‘Fawn’\n\nUnofficially rooted in the aesthetics of Dungeon Synth, Disemballerina charges forth on ‘Fawn’, their latest EP of Medieval fueled orchestrations and discordant instrumentation. Nearly fifteen minutes of classical interpretations that dive into various genres of avant-garde liking. Subtle, smooth, and at times unconventional, this enticing release is worth multiple listens as well as a gander into their back catalog of impressive albums.\n\nThe main article image is a unique creation from the WOMBO Dream APP.\n\nIt’s almost mind numbing to see how great the Dark Ambient genre has not only grown, but expanded in sound. It seems as if harsh noise and industrial ambience is coming more into existence and coupling with the bleak intonations of Dark Ambient soundscapes and drones. The albums in this list represent change, growth and also homage to the influences of modern day Dark Ambient music. I hope you enjoy these summary reviews as much as I did putting them together.\n\n1. The Owl – Beyond The Vastness Of Infinity\n\nThe Owl specialized in noise terror and monstrous modulations that are presented in a controlled chaos offering. ‘Beyond The Vastness Of Infinity’ is an improvised endeavor that plays on the decline of normalcy and the abruptness of ataxia. Rigid guitar tones set against the strident sounds of industrialized soundscapes and eerie narrations set a precedence of tonal despondency. As mesmerizing as it is turbulent, this albums is just another gem in the vast The Owl discography.\n\n2. Aleksis Tristan Shaw – Loud Nothing\n\nMulti-talented, multi-genre artist Aleksis Tristan Shaw, once again dabbles in the world of Dark Ambient music with the twisted oblation, ‘Loud Nothing’. Combining the forces of demented horror sounds, spacious soundscapes and drifting drones, this is a compelling story of electronic proportions. Elongated drones provide a hypnotic state while supernatural subtleties and sequences keep the listener from completely going under with hints of smoldering tension. At times, spacey, and other times downright grim, this recording is a full offering of Dark Ambient amusement and is fascinating to say the least.\n\n3. Crepuscular Entity – Zwolf Bagatellen\n\n‘Zwolf Bagatellen’ is an exercise in harsh frequency delivery and the chaotic amplification of audial discord. Consisting of twelve tracks of white noise, with belligerent modulations, this is a test of determination and surviving the true grit of noise ambience. Filled with abrupt soundscapes and extreme reverberation, this album is a massive overdose of music that is meant to overtake the sense and infiltrate the mind. Listen at your own risk but prepare to be amazed at the indulgence of extreme electronic music.\n\n4. Drone Islands – Volume I / II / III\n\n‘Drone Islands – Volume I /II / III’ is a massive collection of ambient magnificence, containing beautiful audial offerings from an array of artists. This album combines the work of all Drone Island releases to include, ‘Land Rising’, ‘The Lost Maps’ and ‘Stellar’. Some of the biggest names in the Dark Ambient community lend their services to this recording such as Ashtoreth, Kammarheit, BlackWeald, Taphephobia, Alphaxone and Infinexhuma. These types of collective albums are a real treat, as you get a cluster of unique musical achievements in a single album. This is an exemplary collection that must be heard.\n\n5. Long The Night – Illusion\n\n‘Illusion’ is an assemblage of beguiling drones with cinematic-like production. Although starting out with a light ambient vibe, the mood swiftly changes on track two, “Untold Mind” and a belligerent tone is thrusted into this space ambient endeavor. These songs sequentially crescendo into a mammoth-like sound and slowly fade out into oblivion before shifting to the next moment of surprising moments. There are moments that are influenced by the Warhammer 40k sound, while the majority of the album is like a dark space excursion. This is an excellent album that fits right in with some of the top names in the genre.\n\n6. Pavor Nocturnus – Bosch\n\nPavor Nocturnus specializes in flowing light drones that are delivered in an obscure pallet of ominous soundscapes, torturous industrial sounds and peaceful samples and field recordings. All fused together, this is an eerily harmonious endeavor that will be pleasing to fans of multiple Dark Ambient sub-genres. ‘Bosch’ is eclectic blend of soulful modulations that don’t have a particular flow (from track to track), but works very well in the overarching concept of the album. This is an amazing recording that I cannot recommend enough.\n\n7. Sij & Textere Oris – Reflections At The Sea\n\nSij & Textere Oris is one of the most fascinating Dark Ambient collaborations on the Cryo Chamber label roster. Although only having released two albums on the giant label, they are both top quality endeavors that are unique in their own way. On latest effort, ‘Reflections At The Sea’, soothing drones are met with enchanting vocal melodies and theatrical reverberations that produces a theatrical-like sound. From piano chops to random sound effects, this album is put together magnificently and will warrant multiple listens. This is definitely one not to miss.\n\n8. Melanohelios – The Durance Machine\n\nIn my opinion, Melanohelios doesn’t put out music often enough. There is something very addictive with Melanohelios albums and I can’t quite put my finger on it. However, I can say that what you’ll get with each album is an exclusive listening experience – one just as good as the next. On ‘The Durance Machine’, there are two tracks of mind-melding drone work that lasts the better part of thirty six minutes. While listening, you’ll find yourself drifting between peaceful experiences and terrifying moments that flow together with extreme transparency. This is another alluring album from such a reclusive entity.\n\n9. Marco Pianges – Somewhere\n\nDark tones and blistering keys set the backdrop for this escapade of quality electronic tracks. With a plethora of samples and soundscapes, this short album is a cacophony of aggressive moment and angst-filled resilience. The genius aspect of this album is the malevolence hidden in the peaceful details – like a field of beautiful flowers in the dead of winter. Even with just twenty minutes of playing time, this five track album is a beast to contend with and will surely please all fans of Dark Ambient music.\n\n10. Northumbria – Isolering\n\nIf you’re a fan of Dark Ambient music, you should at least be aware of the haunting entity known as Northumbria. With a list of unrivaled albums on the Cryo Chamber label, the stringed duo often ventures out independently and continues to produce quality ambience. On 2021’s ‘Isolering’, we’re presented with four ominous tracks containing nearly seventy five minutes worth of mesmerizing intonations. These extended efforts take the listener down a blackened path and instill a relentless blend of lethargic tones and reverberated modulations that are simply paralyzing. In my opinion, this is one of their best efforts and the mood that it sets is quite compelling.\n\nThe main article image is a unique creation from the WOMBO Dream APP.\n\nWith the ever growing Dungeon Synth community and the endless amounts of review requests that I receive, publishing these Celestial Ephemerides articles is the quickest way for me to keep up, and to also push out content to the community in a timely fashion. For Part V, we find a varied list of exciting Dungeon Synth albums and some that are multi-genre endeavors with just a touch of Dungeon Synth influence. Needless to say, it’s awesome to watch this community grow with everyone’s unique spin on one of the greatest genres around. Keep up the great work, artistry support and most of all, I hope you all enjoy this publishing.\n\n1. Psyyps – L’oracle de I’imaginaire et La Porte du Chemin\n\nPsyyps adopts the Dungeon Synth aesthetic to create a magnetic brand of New Age bliss. Permeated with tribal-like beats, alluring ambience and a host of instrumentation, this experience is one of a kind. It’s as if the dungeon lore of Medieval times escaped to a futuristic setting of unfamiliarity and enlightenment. Prepare to be amazed by these eight tracks of cutting edge explorations.\n\n2. Baerdcyn – Naegling\n\nNo other artist has mastered the art of Medieval tranquility quite like Baerdcyn. Blending aspects of folk ambient with his passionate stringed instrumental chops, ‘Naegling’ is a product of majestic beauty and absolution. Tracks such as “The Quest” and “Dragon’s Scale” dig toward the center of the soul with ardent layers of mythical sounds. Haunting reverberations increase the intensity of these tracks, showcasing a likeness for enthralling peace.\n\n3. Search For The Navigator – Flight Of The Firmament\n\n‘Flight Of The Firmament’ is an unparalleled sonic adventure. Combining Dungeon Synth, Ambient Music, Comfy Synth and whimsical soundscapes, this album is like an interstellar odyssey; a grand musical, if you will. Containing six tracks of celestial-themed electronics, the incursion of various oddities is endless as you wander through clusters and nebulas, heading toward an otherworldly dungeon. Don’t let this one slip under the radar; it’s too good to pass up and it needs to be heard immediately.\n\n4. Ancestral Axe – Dawn Of The New Age\n\nLike a Medieval battle between Christianity and Paganism, ‘Dawn Of The New Age’ is a sacrificial offering of war-time aggression and dark hymnals as bloodshed spills across the land. The samples, field recordings and soundscapes really breathe a spectacular life into this recording, as the music takes us through the trials and tribulations of battle, territorial reign and the fight for ultimate victory. So, sit back and enjoy this marauding journey of superlative tunes.\n\n5. Grîmmöld – Heatherfrost\n\nGrîmmöld takes on the coldness of winter with three tracks of mesmerizing ambience that represents the quiet days of snow covered lands and hibernating conditions. Taking a break from the normal blackened dungeon synth offerings, in favor of a modest take on the lighter side of things, Grîmmöld amasses a celestial escapade of bleak proportions. These tracks are soothing, yet desolate in delivery. ‘Heatherfrost’ is another exemplary offering from one of the most respected artists in the business.\n\n6. Ozeregoth – In The Shadow Of Gloomspire\n\n‘In The Shadow Of Gloomspire’ is a chillingly atmospheric album that is more reminiscent of the peaceful settings of the Renaissance era than the battle-heavy times of the Medieval period. These are tranquil tracks that slowly build and include a sensation background ambience, slightly distorted modulations and a dose of synthwave textures as well. This is a great album to sit back and relax too; and reflect on ancient times and how those experiences must have played out.\n\n7. Stuffed Crust – Sacrificial Slice Upon The Blackened Stone\n\nDon’t let the playful album cover and hilarious song titles fool you, this weird adventure is done in great taste and the musicianship is surprisingly good. ‘Sacrificial Slice Upon The Blackened Stone’ is like the Primus of Dungeon Synth – only stranger. On this whimsical ride, you’ll hear metal drumming, screaming vocals, eerie synth chops and super lo-fi guitar harmonies – all in the name of delicious fun. I mean, who doesn’t like pizza and music? The moody tracks are borderline comfy synth, then it’s followed up by maniacal black metal parts that seem out of place but are exquisitely relevant in this instance. Sit back and enjoy (a slice) the journey to Margherita(ville)!\n\n8. Dungeon Guerrilla – The Prophecy\n\nDungeon Guerrilla takes us on a mystical journey through the ages with the fantasy synth album, ‘The Prophecy’. This maritime adventure showcases layers of melodic synths that are intricately woven to create a chunky sound, while sparse percussive parts show an innovative side to these tunes. The production is on point while the reverberation creates a grandiose sensation. This thirty seven minute journey is well worth the time and it’s sure to warrant multiple listens.\n\n9. Oulfaam – Χορεύοντας στις σκάλες\n\nTalking about impressive, this album is like listening to a live orchestral concerto mixed with dark jazz noir. The dissonant moments are compelling and the mood often changes from estranged elevator music to haunting synth anthems. I love albums that showcase many sides of a musical genre and Oulfaam succeeds in doing so here. Ten tracks of variety lead toward an epic adventure of the unknown and this is the album that will be your guiding hand. A very enjoyable endeavor!\n\n10. Blood Moss – Blood Moss\n\nWho would have ever thought to combining Dungeon Synth with 60’s-era psychedelic rock? Well, Blood Moss thought of it and have latched on to something creative, and you know what? It works extremely well! The lo-if quality makes this sound so amazing and the guitar work – for what it’s intended for – is extremely addicting and it’s something that I could vibe with for days! This album is not only full of jarring compositions, it also has passion and an overall gratification for music in general. If you’ve not heard this yet, you have no idea what you’re missing. I highly recommend this to everyone that is open-minded for new, fresh ideas.\n\nThe main article image is a unique creation from the WOMBO Dream APP."
