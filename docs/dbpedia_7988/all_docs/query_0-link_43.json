        "text": "Nailah Hunter grew up in a household where magic was considered demonic, so her parents didn’t let her read the “Harry Potter” books. Her father was a pastor in the South Los Angeles neighborhood Ladera Heights and she sang at his church, and later wrote songs on acoustic guitar and performed in her high school’s choir. She also read fantasy novels and listened to Gary Stadler, a fanciful composer whose titles are filled with “fairy” or “faerie.”\n\n“The nerdiness started early,” said Hunter, now 26 and quite close to her parents, over FaceTime on a September morning.\n\nIn college, she felt stifled as a traditional singer-songwriter or the vocalist in groups where others, “namely white dudes,” controlled the creative direction. She got a Korg Triton synthesizer and the audio production software Logic Pro. She also got deep into the harp. “The realm it accesses — the timbre, the texture, the low notes — it feels like you’re summoning things out of your body as you’re playing,” she said.\n\nHunter’s creations began to break from conventional song structures and develop into something freer, and in March, she put out her debut EP, “Spells.” Last Friday, she released new music alongside fellow artists on the Los Angeles label Leaving Records who likewise create a distinctive version of new age music. It’s an often derided, and loosely defined, genre that’s been called out for its cheesiness and outmoded conventions (is that a wind chime tinkling in the distance?), but the Leaving roster offers an updated perception of what new age can be, and who makes it."
