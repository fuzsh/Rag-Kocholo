But I believe that the moment we stop being curious — about our own minds and the minds of others — we begin to stagnate.\n\nI endeavor, instead, to never stop learning, never stop expanding, and never stop being inquisitive toward life, which is how I found myself observing this strange phenomenon.\n\nI realized the words “New Age” are tossed around frequently (and often derogatorily) as a kind of shorthand that everyone understands, but rarely defines, and it got me thinking…what does “New Age” even mean?\n\nWho falls under the category? And why are so many people dismissive of the so-called “New Age” philosophy and the people that ostensibly practice it?\n\nI Am “People”\n\nWarning: this might get very meta.\n\nBecause I’m both the person who used to disdain New Age-y folks, and now, could easily be called one."
