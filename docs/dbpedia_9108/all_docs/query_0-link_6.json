        "text": "Chinese Coins with Flower Holes\n\nWestern Han Dynasty Coins (206 BC - 25 AD)\n\nThe inscription on this coin is read right to left as ban liang (半 两).\n\nThis coin was cast during the years 186-182 BC during the reign of Empress Lu of the Western Han Dynasty and is known as a 8 zhu (铢) ban liang.\n\nThe coin has a very nice flower hole.\n\nFlower holes on coins from the early Han Dynasty are very scarce. In fact, this particular coin is the earliest example of a Chinese coin with a flower hole that I have seen.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 32 mm and the weight is 3.8 grams.\n\nWang Mang Coins (7 - 23 AD)\n\nThis coin is a huo quan (货泉) which translates as \"wealth coin\" or \"money coin\".\n\nThese coins were cast beginning in the year 14 AD by Wang Mang.\n\nThis huo quan is considered a very early example of a Chinese coin with a flower hole.\n\nThe flower hole may not be as obvious as that on the coins to follow so I have outlined the eight sides of the hole for your convenience.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 28 mm and the weight is 2.1 grams.\n\nEastern Han Dynasty Coins (25-220 AD)\n\nThe coinage of the Western Han and Eastern Han Dynasties was dominated by the wu zhu (五 铢) coin.\n\nAt the left is an example of an Eastern Han wu zhu coin.\n\nThis coin, however, is quite remarkable in that it displays a number of special characteristics.\n\nThe coin has a very nice flower hole.\n\nBelow the square hole are three \"dots\" which the Chinese refer to as \"stars\".\n\nAbove the square hole are two vertical lines which are believed to represent the number \"two\", and connecting these two lines is an incused line creating what some believe is the Chinese character gong (工).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23.5 mm and a weight of 2.2 grams.\n\nThe Three Kingdoms Coins (220-280 AD)\n\nWith the end of the Han Dynasty, China entered a period of disunity and warfare known as the Three Kingdoms.\n\nThe Kingdom of Shu was one of these Three Kingdoms and the coin at the left was cast there during the years 221-265.\n\nThe inscription is tai ping bai qian (太 平百钱) which translates as Taiping (Great Peace) One Hundred Cash.\n\nThis is a small and thin specimen but one that exhibits a flower hole.\n\nAnother very distinctive variety of this coin, which reflects Daoist (Taoist) influences, can be seen at Chinese Coins with Charm Features.\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 19.5 mm and a weight of only 0.7 grams.\n\nTang Dynasty Coins (618 - 907 AD)\n\nBeginning in the 4th year (621) of the Wu De reign of Emperor Gaozu, use of the wu zhu (五 铢) coins was abolished and a new coin began to be cast with the inscription kai yuan tong bao (开 元 通宝).\n\nAn example of a kai yuan tong bao with a well-formed flower hole is displayed here.\n\nThis new coin was a monumental change in the history of Chinese coinage because Chinese coins were now no longer named after their weight, such as \"half tael\" (ban liang 半两) or \"five zhu\" (wu zhu 五铢), but instead would have inscriptions such as tong bao(通 寶), yuan bao (元 寶) and zhong bao (重 寶).\n\nAnother important change was that the coin inscription would was no longer written in the ancient zhuan shu (篆书) or \"seal\" script but rather in li shu (隶书) or \"official\" script which is a square and plain style of Chinese calligraphy.\n\nEmperor Gaozu had one of the Tang Dynasty's most famous calligraphers, Ouyang Xun (欧阳询), write the inscription for the new coin and these kai yuan tong bao cash coins would continue to be cast for more than 200 years.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 25 mm and a weight of 3.1 grams.\n\nAs mentioned in the history section above, coins with flower holes started to become more commonly seen during the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThis is an ordinary one cash coin with a nicely formed flower hole. The inscription reads qian yuan zhong bao (乾 元重宝) and these coins were cast during the years 759-762 of the reign of Emperor Su Zong (756-762).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23 mm and a weight of 3.5 grams.\n\nThe Chinese coin at the left is also a qian yuan zhong bao (乾元重宝) cast beginning in the second year (759 AD) of the Qian Yuan reign of Emperor Su Zong (756-762).\n\nThis particular specimen also has a nicely centered eight-sided flower hole.\n\nThe flower or rosette hole is clearly seen on the reverse side of the coin as well.\n\nPlease note that this coin has a double outer rim. This dual rim (chonglun 重轮) was done intentionally to indicate that the coin was equal in value to 50 ordinary cash coins.\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 35 mm and a weight of 15 grams.\n\nThe inscription on this Tang Dynasty cash coin is read clockwise as da li yuan bao (大历元宝).\n\nThe coin has a well-formed flower hole and was cast during the Dali reign (766-779) of Emperor Dai Zong.\n\nThe diameter is 22.5 mm and the weight is 2.6 grams.\n\nBeginning in the 5th year (845) of the Hui Chang reign of Emperor Wu Zong (841-846), cash coins were cast with the inscription kai yuan tong bao (开元通宝).\n\nHowever, these kai yuan tong bao coins differed from those cast at the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in that the reverse side displays a Chinese character.\n\nThe first coin of this type was cast under the authority of Li Shen, the Resident Administrator of Yangzhou Prefecture, and had the character chang (昌) on the reverse side to indicate the reign year Hui Chang.\n\nOther mints subsequently produced coins of this type with a character on the reverse side indicating the prefecture where the coin was cast. For this reason, these coins are commonly referred to as Hui Chang Kai Yuan (会昌开元) coins.\n\nThis is the reverse side of the coin.\n\nIf you observe closely, you will notice the Chinese character yan (兖) just above the flower hole.\n\nThis indicates that this Hui Chang Kai Yuan coin was cast at the mint located at Yan Prefecture in Shandong.\n\nIn general, the workmanship of Hui Chang kai yuan tong bao coins does not match that of the kai yuan tong bao coins cast at the beginning of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe diameter of this coin is 24 mm and the weight is 3.1 grams.\n\nFive Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Coins (907-960)\n\nFollowing the Tang Dynasty, South China was ruled during the years 907-960 by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms.\n\nThis coin was cast in the year 917 which was the first year of the Tian Han reign of King Wang Jian (907-918) of the Former Shu (First Shu) Kingdom (907-925).\n\nThe inscription is read clockwise as tian han yuan bao (天汉元宝).\n\nThis particular specimen exhibits a flower (rosette) hole.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23 mm and the weight is 3.4 grams.\n\nThis coin, with a prominent flowerhole, was cast during the reign of Wang Yan (919-925), the son of Wang Jian, of the Former Shu Kingdom.\n\nThe inscription reads clockwise as qian de yuan bao (乾德元宝).\n\nThese coins were cast during the years 919-924.\n\nThe diameter is 23.8 mm and the weight is 3.1 grams.\n\nNorthern Song Dynasty Coins (960 - 1127 AD)\n\nThis is one of the earliest examples of a Northern Song Dynasty coin with a flower hole.\n\nThe inscription is written in running script and is read clockwise as zhi dao yuan bao (至道元宝).\n\nThe coin was cast during the years 995-997 of the reign of Emperor Tai Zong (976-997).\n\nThe diameter is 25 mm and the weight is 3.5 grams.\n\nNorthern Song cash coins tend to be finely cast as illustrated by this coin with its deep characters.\n\nThe inscription reads clockwise, beginning at the top, as jing de yuan bao (景德元宝) and is written in regular script.\n\nThis coin with a flower hole was cast during the years 1004-1007 of the reign of Emperor Zhen Zong (998-1022).\n\nThe diameter is 25.9 mm and the weight is 3.7 grams.\n\nThis coin with a flower hole was cast during the years 1008-1016 of the reign of Emperor Zhen Zong (998-1022) of the Northern Song.\n\nThe inscription is read clockwise as xiang fu yuan bao (样符元宝) and is written in regular script.\n\nThe diameter is 25 mm and the weight is 3.5 grams.\n\nThis Northern Song coin with a flower hole was cast during the years 1017-1022 in the reign of Emperor Zhen Zong (998-1022).\n\nThe inscription is read clockwise, starting with the top character, as tian xi tong bao (天禧通宝) and is written in regular script.\n\nThe coin is 25 mm in diameter and weighs 3.5 grams.\n\nThe inscription on this Northern Song coin is read clockwise as tian sheng yuan bao (天圣元宝) and is written in regular script.\n\nThis coin with a flower hole was minted during the years 1023-1031 of the reign of Emperor Ren Zong (1022-1063).\n\nThe diameter is 24.5 mm and the weight is 2.6 grams.\n\nThis particular Northern Song dynasty coin was only cast in the years 1032-1033 during the reign of Emperor Ren Zong (1022-1063).\n\nThe inscription is written in regular script and is read clockwise, beginning at the top, as ming dao yuan bao (明道元宝).\n\nThis specimen has a flower (rosette) hole.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 26 mm and weighs 4.2 grams.\n\nDuring the years 1039-1054 of Emperor Ren Zong's reign, coins with the inscription huang song tong bao (皇宋通宝) were cast.\n\nIn this example, the inscription is read top to bottom and right to left.\n\nThe inscription is written in seal script and the coin has a flower hole.\n\nThe diameter is 25 mm and the weight is 3.5 grams.\n\nThis coin from Emperor Ren Zong was cast during 1054-1055.\n\nThe inscription is zhi he tong bao (至 和通宝) and is written in regular script.\n\nThe coin displays a very nice flower or rosette hole.\n\nThe diameter is 25 mm and the weight is 3.6 grams.\n\nThe inscription (legend) on this cash coin is also zhi he tong bao (至和通宝) but it is written in seal script.\n\nThis coin was also cast during the years 1054-1055 of the reign of Song Dynasty Emperor Ren Zong.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 25 mm and a weight of 3.4 grams.\n\nThis coin was also cast during the reign of Emperor Ren Zong.\n\nThe inscription (legend), written in seal script, is jia you tong bao (嘉祐通寳) and the coin was cast in the years 1056-1063.\n\nThe diameter is 24.8 mm and the weight is 3.3 grams.\n\nEmperor Ying Zong reigned during the years 1064-1067.\n\nThis coin has the inscription (legend) zhi ping yuan bao (治平元宝) written in a beautiful seal script.\n\nIt was cast during the entire period of Emperor Ying Zong's rule.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24 mm and a weight of 3.5 grams.\n\nThis cash coin was also cast during the years 1064-1067 of Emperor Ying Zong's reign.\n\nThe coin has the same zhi ping yuan bao (治平元宝) inscription but, in this case, is written in regular script.\n\nThe diameter is 24 mm and the weight is 4 grams.\n\nThis is another cash coin cast during the Zhi Ping reign of Emperor Ying Zong.\n\nIn this case, however, the inscription is zhi ping tong bao (治平通宝) written in seal script.\n\nThese coins were cast in the years 1064-1067.\n\nThe coin is distinctive in that the character (ping 平), located below the square hole, is written with three strokes at the bottom instead of one.\n\nThe diameter is 24.7 mm and the weight is 4.1 grams.\n\nThe reign of Emperor Shen Zong (1068-1085) of the Northern Song included the casting of coinage with the inscription xi ning yuan bao (熙宁元宝) during the years 1068-1077.\n\nThis is a variety of such a coin which happens to have a flower hole.\n\nThe inscription is written in regular script and is read clockwise.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24.5 mm.\n\nThe coin is thicker than most Song dynasty coins of this size which explains its weight of 5.5 grams.\n\nAt the left is another \"flower hole\" coin with the same xi ning tong bao (熙 宁元宝) inscription.\n\nThis inscription, however, is written in seal script.\n\nCoins with this style of calligraphy were cast during the years 1068-1077 of the reign of Emperor Shen Zong.\n\nThe diameter is 24.5 mm and the weight is 3.8 grams.\n\nBeginning in the year 1071, larger denomination coins, initially valued at 10 cash coins each, were produced. These coins were issued during the reign of Emperor Shen Zong to pay for military expenses.\n\nThe coin at the left is one of these larger cash coins with this particular specimen displaying a flower (rosette) hole.\n\nThe inscription reads xi ning zhong bao (熙宁重宝) and is written in seal script.\n\nThese coins were gradually devalued to be equal to 3 cash coins and finally to 2 cash coins.\n\nCasting of xi ning zhong bao coins ceased in 1077.\n\nThe diameter of this coin is 29 mm and the weight is 8 grams.\n\nSimilar to the above large cash coin, this is another xi ning zhong bao (熙宁重宝) but one which is written in regular script.\n\nThis coin was also cast during the years 1071-1077 of the reign of Emperor Shen Zong.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 32 mm and a weight of 8.4 grams."
