At 0030, a prolonged NVA mortar and rocket attack announced that the siege of Khe Sanh had started. It destroyed the largest U.S. Marine ammunition dump and was followed by a strong attack on Hill 861. 1,500 tons of ordnance exploded along with helicopters, tents, fuel, and tear gas. Only half the runway was usuable the next day. A simultaneous battalion-size attack on the village of Khe Sanh and its CIDG camp is repulsed after partial penetration by the enemy. After beating off a second attack, the CIDG and the District headquarters are withdrawn into the Khe Sanh Combat Base.\n\n__________________\n\n(5)January 30, 1968\n\nThe 2d Bn, 174th NVA Regt and local forces attacked the Kontum Subsector Headquarters and the town. Prior to the attack, local VC infiltrated the city. About 25 percent of Tanh Canh was destroyed in the battle and the 2/174th suffered heavy casualties, probably as high as 50 percent. After the battle 167 NVA and VC bodies were removed from the city.\n\nAt about 0200 hours, the 5th Bn, 95th NVA Regt attacked the Tuy Hoa airfield, the provincial prison, and American artillery positions. C Battery, 6th Bn, 32nd Artillery, an 8 inch and 175mm composite battery, was one of these positions. They were located at the Tuy Hoa North Airfield, on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Tuy Hoa. At about 0700 hours, a reaction force arrived from the 4th Bn, 503rd Inf, 173rd Abn reinforced by a battalion from the Korean 28th Regt. The RVN prison camp was just south of the artillery battery. The NVA had suffered very high casualties during the night and holed up in a little refugee village just south of the prison camp. The battalion commander of the 4/503rd landed and personally led a charge against the surrounded NVA which resulted in 19 US KIA and 39 WIA. The brigade commander had him pull back and had the fast movers from Tuy Hoa Air Base annihilated the survivors of the NVA battalion. There were less than a half dozen wounded survivors. The NVA were supported during the Tet attack by a local Viet Cong battalion which escaped almost unscathed. It was this VC battalion that conducted two attacks against the city of Tuy Hoa and were repulsed by two battalions of the ARVN 47th Regt. The ARVN moved against the remaining enemy strongholds in the center of Tuy Hoa on 5 Feb and captured it on the 6th.\n\nPleiku: The VC 15H LF and 40th Sapper Bns attacked cross an expanse of open field at great cost. Heavy fighting raged around the Pleiku sector headquarters, the MACV compount, the 71st Evac, the POW compound, both airfields, and a Montagnard training center. The 3d ARVN Cav Sqdn and the 22d ARVN Ranger Bn backed up by a company of the 1/69th Armor responded immediately. Two mobile strike force cos from B/5th SF were added to the street fighting. Finally the 4th Eng Bn, as infantry, were added. By 3 Feb this amalgamated force was mopping up.\n\nKontum: The 24th NVA Regt, the 304th VC Bn and the 406th Sapper Bn attacked the MACV compound, post office, airfield, and 24th ARVN STZ headquarters. Some of the most ferocious combat of Tet-68 transpired in Kontum city. The initial assault was met by two Montagnard scout companies which were rapidly brushed aside and the 2/42d ARVN Regt which fell back. The B-24 SF Det compound was penetrated at several points. At noon the Americans rustled up the ground elements of 7/17th Air Cav, fused them with 1/22d Inf and C/1/69th Armor. This composite task force was shoved into the heart of the city but the fierce tempo of urban fighting was sustained five more days.\n\nBan Me Thuot: The 33d NVA Regt and the 301E VC LF Bn attacked the 23d ARVN Div headquarters, the MACV compound, both airfields, and numerous other targets including the bank. Initially they were opposed by only the local RFPF force and the SF B-23 Det. By midday on the 30th, the 8th ARVN Cav Sqdn and the 45th ARVN Regt were also engaged. The house-to-house fighting was so intense that the 23d ARVN Ranger Bn was committed on 1 Feb. These rangers were quickly consumed by the slaughter and the next day the 1/503d Airborne Battalion, 173d Airborne Brigade was flown in from Pleiku. Four major NVA assaults were hurled against Ban Me Thuot during the course of the battle, but by 6 Feb the town was cleared. Over one third of the city had been reduced to smoking rubble. In Code-Name Bright Light, we learn that several ARVN, Montagnards and three American civilians were captured by the NVA during the battle. Mike Benge, the head of USAID and one of the senior ranking Americans in Ban Me Thuot, was captured as he drove his jeep around the city collecting Americans and taking them to the MACV compound. He was unaware that various parts of the city were in NVA hands. Two American missionaries, Henry Blood and Betty Olsen, were also captured.\n\n__________________\n\n(6)31th January 1968\n\n(a)On Tet Holidays, the Vietcong and Vietminh launched “The Tet Offensive” against the town of South Vietnamm and mounted a huge offensive, penetrating several town s in an attempt to destroy the morale of the South Vietnamese and Americans , who believed that their power was confined to the countryside.\n\nJanuary 31, 1968\n\nBattle for Hue. The battle began at 0340 with a 122mm rocket attack followed by two bns from the NVA 6th Regt charging across lightly defended bridges and taking part of the Imperial Citadel. They were halted by the ARVN Hoc Bo (Black Panther) Co at the Tay Loc airfield before they could reach the ARVN 1st Div HQ. The NVA 4th Regt struck the MACV HQ defended by a makeshift force of 200 Americans. The USMC base at Phu Bai responded by sending one Inf Co reinforced with 4 tanks. When this force was pinned down, a second Co with 2 SP 40mm guns were dispatched. Six hours later with 10 KIA and 30 WIA this unit reached the MACV compound. At nightfall, the NVA consolidated their positions eventually committing 10 bns (more than a full division) to the Citadel battles. The allies countered with 3 understrength USMC, 6 USA and 11 ARVN bns.During this battle the 1st and the 5th Marines and several ARVN elements defended and drove the enemy out of Hue City as the largest major action of the enemy Tet Offensive. Several USA units from the 1st Cav and 101st Abn Divs were involved blocking position and cutting enemy supply lines to the west and nouth of Hue.

I was commanding a battery that was providing air defense for a supply area.We had fifty-two men on dury. at 9.00 we were attacked by F-4Hs and F-105s.By the time it was over forty of my battery personnel were deead including two platoon leaders and the company executive officer. The political officer and I were both wounded and three of our four guns were knocked out. My battery had been deployed right at the center of rthe attack and we had taken all the fire ,The 26th Battery ,which was on one of my flanks,had seven killed.The 398th Battery was at my rear .They had one killed and three wounded.The 27th off to the east took five wounded.\n\nThe guys commanding these batteries had been playing tricks.In principle,the moment Battalion gave the orders, we were all supppsed to open fire at the same time. But the other companies had withheld their fire at the same time. But the other companies had withheld their fire for a couple of seconds with that kind of delay, the target might have beeen out of sight.If you delayed just one or two seconds, you could conceal your position.The unit that opened fire first would be pinpointed.\n\nOf cource the other units would be identified as well,but they wouldn’t considered the main objectives.So it was my battery that was identified, ands we got all the bombing and shelling.\n\nI complained about this to the battalion officers, but all I got out of it was a reprimand for “lack of vigilance in leadership” I was lucky I wasn’t subjected to disciplinary action.Battalion didn’t realizede what was going on. so from then I used the same tricks myself (Info from Nguyen Van Thanh,Lieutenan NVA-north Vietnam Army.Antiaircraft Battery)\n\n(4) August,24th. 1968\n\nInformation from “NGANH XANG DAU QUAN DOI”:\n\n(a)Ngay 13.6.1968. nganh xang dau da xay dung xang 42 km duong ong dan dau vuot qua Nam Ban ,Dong Loc, Truong Bang.(D)\n\n(b)Ngay 24.8.1968.

Johnson. Among 24,500 men ordered to active duty in 88 units across the United States were 570 Kentucky Guardsmen and 750 Kentucky Air Guardsmen.\n\nAfter approximately three weeks of processing, the Army Guardsmen were flown to Fort Hood, Texas, for concentrated field training and combat qualification. Following the heritage, which had been passed down through the generations of the Kentucky National Guard, these men performed their duties with the utmost of expertise. These were civilian soldiers taken from their civilian jobs to perform the task of liberating from Communist tyranny a tiny country practically on the other side of the world. Even though such was quite unpopular with many U.S. citizens, these centurions carried the torch of freedom for posterity. During the months before deployment to the Republic of Vietnam, 105 men sought an injunction from shipping the unit to a hostile zone without a declaration of war by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to issue the injunction. These men had their day to be heard and never once complained of being sent to Southeast Asia. Not one man failed to do his duty commendably.\n\nBattery C, 2 / 138th Field Artillery in Vietnam – believed to be Mike Simpson’s gun at Firebase Denise 1969.”\n\nThe Kentucky men showed much spirit. This was indicated by their disregard for a Department of Defense policy, which disallowed two brothers serving together in a combat zone. The 2d Battalion had numerous pairs of brothers serving in combat, as well as many who had brothers serving with the U.S. Regulars in South Vietnam. Such concern truly brought out the inbred motto of Kentuckians, “United We Stand, Divided We Fall.”\n\nThe 2d Battalion of the 138th Field Artillery established headquarters at Gia Le Combat Base. Its firing batteries occupied such famous bases as Fire Base Bastogne, Tomahawk Hill, and Hamburger Hill. Its responsibility was to provide fire support for the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division, whose home is Fort Campbell, Ky. Together they were to keep North Vietnamese regulars from destroying neighboring villages that were located along the China Sea. In this endeavor the Kentucky National Guard had provided such superior fire support that NVA sappers, demolition experts, were given the life-or-death mission of completely destroying Charlie Battery of Bardstown. Charlie Battery had created utter destruction for the NVA and the only possible hope was an attempt to destroy her. Later intelligence indicated that the NVA had practiced their mission of destruction because it was well aware of Charlie Battery’s battle adeptness.\n\nThe evening of June 19, 1969, was a quiet one for Charlie Battery on Tomahawk Hill. There had been few attacks by the enemy in the previous days and fire missions were at a minimum. It was pouring rain. South Vietnamese rainstorms are much different from those in the States. It comes down with such force that one would think a dam had broken. The rain numbs all hearing senses and limits visibility to one foot. The infiltrators are pleased with such climate as it allows them movement, which normally would be checked. Many of the off-duty men of Charlie were watching a James Bond movie or thinking about their loved ones back in Kentucky.\n\nMeanwhile, approximately 150 NVA sappers were amassing outside the perimeter of the compound. Twenty-two infantrymen from the 101st Airborne Division were manning the perimeter. At approximately 0145 about 75 of the sappers, clad only in loin cloths and skullcaps with satchel charges strapped to their bodies and carrying RPG’s, shoulder-firing rocket launchers, proceeded to snake through the barbed concertina wire barricade. Supported by a mortar unit the NVA sappers completely overran the defending infantry, killing and wounding most of them.\n\nA Bardstown man shouted the first alarm and the destruction was on. The deadly sappers, who were, as would be later confirmed, on drugs, moved around devilishly free with no fear of death. They threw satchel charges into the bunkers, killing and wounding many. The wounded as well as the unharmed fought back with every ounce of life to drive the madmen from the firebase. At the same time, other units of the Kentucky Guard at other firebases were shelled by the NVA so that they could provide little or no fire for Charlie Battery.\n\nThe sappers delivered approximately 150 satchel charges and RPG’s. After destroying an ammunition storage area, three howitzers, nine bunkers, the mess hall, dining tent, maintenance building, four ammunition carriers, three 21/2-ton trucks, two 3/4-ton trucks, and three jeeps, the marauders of the night were forced to retreat. Cobra gunships zeroed in on the NVA position and forced the surviving NVA sappers to run for their lives.\n\nThe enemy felled nine Kentucky Guardsmen but he lost 23 on the battlefield. Other dead he carried off so as not to allow the Kentucky men the satisfaction of knowing they had bluntly checked the NVA’s attempted goal: total destruction of Fire Base Tomahawk. The Kentuckians took one prisoner, from which they learned much so that no such attack could occur again.\n\nSenior Commander in Vietnam, General Creighton Abrams, said the 2nd Battalion 138th Field Artillery, was “one of the best trained, and absolutely the best maintained battalion-sized unit in Vietnam.”\n\nMeanwhile, in Kentucky, on May 27, 1968, 700 Guardsmen were ordered to Louisville to quell a racial riot as state and local police fought late into the night to restore order after rioting and looting erupted in the city’s West End. Six units from Louisville were originally called to curb the disturbance. Seventeen incidents of burning automobiles, looting of stores and vandalism had occurred before the Guard established its headquarters at Brandeis Elementary School. The mission of the Guardsmen was to protect firemen who were attempting to extinguish fires initiated by arsonists. There were a total of 29 incidents of looting, vandalism, and arson in the 90-minute period after the command post was set up.\n\nThe rioting centered around 28th and Greenwood. It was there that the action began at 8:30 p.m. following a rally protesting reinstatement of a Louisville policeman accused of using excessive force in arresting a African-American on May 8. The rioting fanned out for blocks as gangs of African-American youths roamed the streets. The price tag for the disturbance was pegged at $200,000. The cost of maintaining the Guard for the period was estimated from $30,000 to $40,000 per day.\n\nIn October of 1969 a welcome home ceremony was held for the Second Howitzer Battalion who had returned from Vietnam. Members of the Guard stood proudly in honoring its achievements. The spring of 1970 was a violent one. President Richard Nixon had committed troops into the fishhook of Cambodia in order to check North Vietnamese supply lines and rest camps, which had been used as springboards for campaigns against the allied forces. Back home in the U.S., the college campuses were humming with dissatisfaction as evidenced by the numerous campus disorders. The powder, which set the explosion, was the incident at Kent State University in Ohio. Four students had been accidentally struck and killed by bullets, which allegedly came from the muzzles of Ohio Guardsmen. This incident created chaos on many of the college campuses throughout the U.S. The University of Kentucky also had its problems. On the night of May 5, Governor Louie B. Nunn issued an emergency proclamation after witnessing the destruction of the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) Building. Two hundred eighty-five Guardsmen were called to aid in the protection of state property and human life. On May 7, 1000 student protesters were dispersed by tear gas for failure to break up an unlawful assembly. Such was a distasteful task for the Guard for many of the men were students at the University themselves. Yet they performed outstandingly in keeping peace on the campus without a major incident. After four days the Guardsmen had settled all chaos and had kept the University intact for the citizen taxpayers of the Commonwealth.\n\nApproximately 125,000 Kentuckians served in the Vietnam War. One thousand seventy-seven gave their lives.\n\n2.\n\nReal Name: Digby Tatham-Warter\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2002\n\nLocation: Lion Route\n\nNovember 16, 1968\n\nAs part of Operation SHERIDAN SABRE, B and E Companies, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cav Division are attacked by an estimated enemy company west of Katum.

Rather than surround and search single hamlets or villages, the division planned a cordon around 36 square kilometers in the Dodge City area, south of Da Nang. Intelligence estimated that the enemy forces in Dodge City numbered between 100 and 150 VC infrastructure and could include up to 900 NVA and VC regular forces that consisted mainly of the 1/36 NVA Regiment. Over seven Marine battalions (1/1, 2/5, 3/5, 1/7, BLT 2/7, BLT 2/26, and 3/26 Marines) would be involved.

On its 40th anniversary, Alan Woods analyses the events that led to the Vietnam War and the significance of the Tet Offensive in bringing about the defeat of US imperialism.\n\nThe Vietnamese call it “Chien Tranh Chong My Curu Nuoc” or “The War against the Americans to save the nation.” In the course of this war, some 58,000 US soldiers were killed in action, as well as 304,000 wounded. But these figures pale in insignificance beside the horrific casualties suffered by the Vietnamese. Almost 1,400,000 North and South Vietnamese were killed in action.\n\nTo this we must add 2,100,000 wounded. It was one of the bloodiest wars in history, and one that took a particularly high toll of civilian lives. The total number of Vietnamese people killed in this conflict will never be known but was probably not fewer than three million, and the total number of casualties not fewer than 8 million.\n\nThe collections will arranged years per years from 1964 until 1968,the install still in processing,please be patient and look some sample pictures below.\n\nThe Vietnam War in Pictures\n\nOn January 27, 1973, the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam was signed by representatives of the South Vietnamese communist forces, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the United States in Paris. A cease-fire would go into effect the following morning, and two months later, on March 29, 1973, the last U.S. military unit would leave Vietnam. The two-decade-long Vietnam War would finally come to an end two years later, and in 1976 the country was reunited as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In the course of the war, more than 3 million people died (including 58,000 Americans), with more than half of them being civilians.\n\nOn this 38th anniversary of the Paris Accord, we take a look inside Britannica’s archive and bring you some photos from the Vietnam War.\n\nAssault boats being used as river patrol as U.S. Marines move inland during the final phase of exercise Jungle Drum III, southern Thailand, March 20, 1965\n\nU.S. Marines wading ashore near Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam, 1965\n\nU.S. soldiers form a search-and-destroy patrol in Phuoc Tuy province, South Vietnam, in 1966\n\nJohn McCain (centre) surrounded by Hanoi residents in Truc Bach Lake after his plane was shot down during, Oct. 26, 1967\n\nVietnamese citizens photographed during the My Lai Massacre, March 16, 1968\n\nProtesters demonstrating against the Vietnam War, New York City, April 27, 1968\n\nCreighton Abrams, U.S. commander in South Vietnam, speaking as Pres.

[Oil on canvas 152 x 175cm. AWM ART40758]\n\nIn May 1966 the first soldiers of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6RAR) arrived in South Vietnam; the rest followed in June. Within two months elements of the battalion found themselves engaged in one of the largest battles fought by Australians in the Vietnam War.\n\nBy August 1966 the Australian task force base at Nui Dat was only three months old. Concerned at the establishment of such a strong presence in their midst, the Viet Cong determined to inflict an early defeat on the Australians. In the days before the battle, radio signals indicated the presence of strong Viet Cong forces within 5 kilometres of the base but patrols found nothing. On the night of 16–17 August Nui Dat came under fire from mortars and recoilless rifles. The defenders stood to, expecting the barrage to be followed by an assault. None came. Searches of the area the next day located some of the sites from which mortars had been fired, but nothing else.\n\nPatrols continued the following day, 18 August. D Company left the base at 11.15 that morning bound for the Long Tan rubber plantation. As they departed Nui Dat the sounds of a concert by Little Pattie, the Australian entertainer, reached their ears. They entered the Long Tan plantation at 3.15 that afternoon. Less than an hour later the Viet Cong attacked in force, putting the Australians under mortar, machine gun and small arms fire. Only the quick response of a New Zealand artillery battery to desperate calls for support saved D Company from annihilation.\n\nAlmost as soon as the battle began a torrential downpour added to the gloom in the rubber plantation. The Australians, surrounded, short of ammunition and fighting an enemy whose strength they could only guess at, called for helicopters to drop ammunition to them. Flying at tree-top height, braving the terrible weather and heavy Viet Cong fire, two RAAF helicopters located the beleaguered Australians and dropped boxes of ammunition and blankets for the wounded.\n\n// Sketches detailing the movements of Australian and enemy troops during the Battle of Long Tan. [To Long Tan, Ian McNeill, Allen & Unwin in association with the Australian War Memorial, 1993]\n\nThe survivors of D Company along with accurate artillery fire from New Zealand’s 161 Field Battery as well as the Australian 103 and 105 Field batteries and a United States battery inflicted heavy losses on the Viet Cong. As the fighting continued Australian reinforcements were committed to the battle. B Company was on the way and A Company, loaded into Armoured Personnel Carriers of 3 Troop, 1 Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron, which fought its way into D Company just before 7 pm as daylight was fading. The Viet Cong had been massing for another assault but were forced to retreat into the plantation. They had suffered terrible casualties, but only when the Australians returned to the scene of battle the following morning did they realise the extent of the defeat that they had inflicted on the enemy. The Australians counted 245 enemy dead still in the plantation and surrounding jungle with evidence that others had already been removed from the battlefield. Captured documents and information from prisoners suggested that D Company had faced some 2,500 Viet Cong. Eighteen Australians were killed in the Battle of Long Tan and 24 wounded, all but one of the dead were from D Company.\n\nvietnam war leaflet the 1969 leaflets which picked them up off the ground the morning after the 1969 Mother’s Day battle at LZ Oasis, Central Highlands, Republic of Vietnam.\n\nGI’S !\n\nAmerican officers and men\n\nOctober 30, 1968\n\nAt approximatively 0200 hours, the U.S 173d Airborne Brigade Base Camp at An Khe in Binh Dinh Province received an unreported number of 82mm mortar rounds followed with a light ground probe by an unknown-size enemy force employing small arms and automatic weapons fire. Artillery and Air Force AC-47 gunship engaged the suspected enemy postions & withdrawal routes with unknown results.\n\nIn November 1971, the Australian 4RAR and Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment flags at Nui Dat base were lowered for the last time by New Zealand Regimental Policeman Private Tai Whatu and Australian Regimental Policeman Private John Skennar of Grafton, NSW. [AWM CUN/71/0536/VN]\n\nThe Tet offensive of February 1968 is regarded as a turning point in the Vietnam War. The Viet Cong mounted a series of attacks on major centres throughout South Vietnam. Although the Viet Cong suffered enormous losses, it was a psychological and propaganda victory for them. Surprised at the Viet Cong’s ability to orchestrate such major attacks across the country, including an assault on the American embassy, many in the United States began to disbelieve assurances that the war was being won.\n\nThe fallout from Tet also led the United States President, Lyndon Johnson, to announce that he would not seek re-election. He was succeeded by Richard Nixon who won office in November 1968. In 1969 Nixon announced that the withdrawal of American troops was a priority. In a policy known as ‘Vietnamisation’ the number of United States combat troops was gradually reduced and their places were taken by soldiers in an expanded South Vietnamese army. But the United States continued to provide assistance by supplying weapons, further training for the South Vietnamese army, and naval and aerial support for South Vietnamese soldiers on operations.\n\nTet had had its effect. In May 1968, just 4 months later, peace talks attended by representatives of North and South Vietnam, the Viet Cong and the United States, opened in Paris. Australia’s Government, having followed the United States lead in Vietnam, was now in the position of having to also enunciate a strategy for withdrawal. In April 1970 the Australian Prime Minister, John Gorton, announced that the 8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (8RAR) would not be replaced when its tour of Vietnam ended in November. This followed a United States Government announcement that more than 180,000 Americans would be withdrawn and, more importantly, that a complete American withdrawal would follow.\n\n5RAR troops led by Corporal John Hinchey, instruct ARVN soldiers on the use of the M60 at the Horseshoe, 1970. [Image courtesy of Mos Hancock]\n\nVietnamisation meant that the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam (ARVN) would double in size, necessitating additional military trainers and resulting in an expanded role for the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) whose numbers increased in the final phase of the war. However, the ARVN was ill-equipped and unable to match the North Vietnamese Army in the field. Early in 1971 Australia’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, reporting on the progress of Vietnamisation, described the ARVN as ‘uneven in quality’ and suffering from poor leadership. Australian military officials in Phuoc Tuy and Saigon reported that the local ARVN would meet significant difficulties once the Australian Task Force’s battalions left. To add to the gloomy outlook, few South Vietnamese had any confidence in their own government which was regarded as corrupt and incompetent.\n\nThe biggest mistake was the failure to go about a fair dinkum approach of boosting the South Vietnamese Army in the early stages, giving them a fair allocation of helicopters and artillery and the like, and above all else comprehensive training. Subsequently, after the Tet Offensive in 1968 and after President Nixon replaced President Johnson in early 1969, the catch-cry went up that ‘Vietnamisation would turn things around’ and a huge effort was attempted, finally, to boost the South Vietnamese Army. It was too little, too late.’\n\n[Tim Fischer, 1 RAR in Vietnam: our war – our peace, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, pp. 128-129]\n\n// The last Australian troops to leave 1ATF Nui Dat, October/November 1971. [AWM CUN/71/0539/VN; FOD/71/0513/VN]\n\nAustralia’s last two battalions to serve in Vietnam, the 3rd and 4th Battalions, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR and 4RAR) arrived in 1971. In August that year the Prime Minister, Billy McMahon, announced that the remainder of the Task Force would be withdrawn at the end of 1971. 3RAR returned home in October 1971 followed in December by 4RAR and the Royal Australian Air force’s No. 9 Squadron. Some logistics personnel and the last of No. 35 Squadron’s Caribou aircraft left early in 1972.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Bill Denny, 86 Transport Platoon, RAASC, was with one of the last Australian units to leave Vietnam in February 1972.\n\nWe were going home… Walking through empty buildings, this seemed a special moment in time – doors banging in the wind and the base eerily deserted. Vietnamese workers were crying and distressed. I lied to them, reassuring them that we would be back ‘if the VC come’. As it turned out, the Viet Cong did come – four weeks later – but we were never going to go back. I never really got over the friends I lost in Vietnam, nor the desertion of those we had so comprehensively fought to support and protect. The last of us formed the final convoy and headed down to De Long Pier, then by landing craft out to HMAS Sydney.\n\n[ Bill Denny, in Vietnam: our war – our peace, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, 2006 pp 48-49 ]\n\nIn April Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces launched an offensive across the South. United States airpower, rather than the ARVN, stopped the North Vietnamese. A massive United States bombing campaign against the North followed in December 1972. In 1975, when the North Vietnamese Army again launched a major offensive against the South, the ARVN forces, this time without United States air support or supplies, were overwhelmed. South Vietnam descended into chaos as civilians fled and thousands of ARVN troops and officers deserted. RAAF personnel returned to Vietnam during these fraught days to help evacuate civilians and transport humanitarian supplies. They counted among their number the last Australian service personnel to leave Vietnam. The South capitulated in late April 1975, bringing the war in Vietnam to an end and ushering in an era of Communist rule.\n\nOfficers and Men of the 1st Air Cav Div\n\nTom Hatfield found this leaflet on an artillery hipshoot in Binh Dinh Province, probably west of Bong Song, circa August 1969.\n\nARVN safe conduct pass\n\nUS Artillery poster from 1971 “RESPONSIVE FIELD ARTILLERY HAS BEEN\n\nTHE MAIN STAY OF THE VIETNAM PACIFICATION\n\nEFFORT.

The tank was sent to South Vietnam in Sept/October 1970 aboard a Landing Ship Medium (LSM). Initially given the squadron call sign 92C, Centurion 169056 later became part of 5 Troop with call sign 5 Bravo (5B).\n\nIt took part in Operation ‘Hermit Park’ in June 1971 when the barrel was struck by a round from an enemy anti-tank weapon (RPG), wounding the driver.\n\nVietnam War"
