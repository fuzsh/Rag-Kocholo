Some entries have precise dates, some have a range, and some are approximate - so the ordering is also subjective, but we have attempted to list events in rough chronological order, up to an arbitrary cutoff date of 1700 CE.\n\nNo such list can be definitive. Apart from many omissions, this selection reflects the interests of the compiler, with incompatible biases towards the early, the underdocumented, and the archaeologically or historically reliable, and specifically relating to maritime and trade history. Not all of this information is reliable - but a few decades ago, perhaps very little of the early history would have been believed by the cynical and Euro-centric, and archaeological discoveries since then have so often validated or exceeded legend that we are not inclined to be too dismissive. There is an extraordinary volume of documentary evidence in Asian and Middle Eastern languages not directly accessible to us. Also, the combination of snippets of varying quality, and from different cultures, may sometimes build up to an overall impression more convincing than the individual parts.\n\nSources are of very variable quality - sometimes tertiary or even more distant from the first hand accounts, but we have tended to include interesting assertions, using the best references to hand, and allow the reader to discriminate. The intention is to improve references over time, to the original documents or more reliable secondary sources - but we will retain multiple references, if potentially useful leads to books or internet content. All errors are the fault of the compiler, Claire Barnes. Contributions and suggestions are welcome: please send them to info@maritimeasia.ws.\n\nNames of discovered shipwrecks are highlighted in bold. Italicised names without quotation marks are the original names of the ships (e.g. Avondster). Italicised names in quotation marks are reference names invented recently (e.g. 'Turiang'). Place names used to refer to wrecks are in bold but unitalicised (e.g. the Hoi An wreck), and are the names by which the specific wrecks are generally known (if other wrecks are found near Hoi An, they will doubtless be given other reference names). Events with date ranges are entered towards the later end of the range.\n\nc.33000-38000 BCE: Humans settled in Australia, after crossing open sea.\n\nPeter Bellwood, 'Ancient seafarers', Archaeology Vol.50 No.2, Mar/Apr 1997, http://www.archaeology.org/9703/etc/specialreport.html.\n\nc.6000-4000 BCE: Neolithic dugout boats and wooden paddles have been excavated at Hemudu and Xiaoshan in China's Zhejiang province.

Eudoxus returned with perfumes and precious stones. On a second voyage, Eudoxus was himself blown off course to Ethiopia, where he found the wreck of a ship which he thought to have come from Gades (Cadiz) by circumnavigating Africa. He later sailed from Gades down the west coast of Africa in an attempt to repeat the journey, but was forced to give up. On the voyages of Eudoxus or shortly afterwards (by 90BCE), a Greek named Hippalus started to sail to India with the monsoon winds and the open sea, rather than coast-hugging.

Import dependence was unsatisfactory, and the south coast glass industry waned. Even the knowhow was eventually lost, but a separate glass industry later developed in the north, with assistance from India during the reign of Wei emperor Shizu (424-452 CE).\n\nShen Fuwei, Cultural flow between China and the outside world, p.116-120, citing the C3rd Guang Zhi on the maritime 'glass route' from Rome via India, Sri Lanka and Cambodia to China, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea on the export of 'crude glass' to the East, and Wei Shu (History of the Wei dynasty) on the Indian technology transfer to Pingcheng (Datong).\n\nOfficial relations were established between Japan and Han China, after the establishment of the Han's Lelung Jun command nearPyongyang in 108 BCE.\n\nFukuoka City Museum caption.\n\n24 BCE: Augustus Caesar sent an army to capture Aden. Thereafter, the Romans opened sea routes to India, where they could buy Chinese silk, bypassing war-torn areas and diminishing the role of Persians and Arabs who previously dominated the trade.

The coins all have gold or silver content, and are predominantly from the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius (14-37 CE) - the two sound-money emperors. Fewer ships sailed around south India, but C1st Roman coins were found at Kadmat in the Lakshadweep islands.\n\nKenneth Hall, Maritime trade and state development in early Southeast Asia, p.34-36, citing R.E.M.

A shipwreck found offshore has been tentatively dated to the C4th or earlier. Ceramics from Persia and China, and Roman coins, are found at Godavaya.

Stuart Munro-Hay notes (Nakhon Sri Thammarat, p.11) that Ptolemy's comments were probably amplified subsequently, and that the text now attributed to him may not predate the earliest copies, C10-11th.\n\n166 CE: Purported envoys of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius arrived in China by sea.

The cargo was entirely from China, apparently destined for the Middle East, on a through voyage via the Sunda Strait. The ship was of Middle Eastern construction, made of mostly African timber, sewn together with rope (possibly hibiscus, implying resewing in Southeast Asia); it was 20-22m long and 5m wide. The bulk of the cargo comprised mass-market Changsha ceramics, including 40,000 bowls, 1635 ewers, 763 inkpots, and 915 spice jars: motifs include Buddhist symbols, Persian-carpet and geometric designs, date palms, and Arabic Muslim scripts. In one area of the stern, there were items of imperial quality, which include fine Ding and Yue ceramics, three blue-and-white saucers (the earliest intact blue-and-white so far found), an octagonal gold cup with decorations including a Persian dancer and Central Asan figures, and exquisite silver boxes - a royal commission or gift? perhaps to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad?
