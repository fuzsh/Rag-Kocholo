        "text": "A HISTORY OF CHINA\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE SHANG DYNASTY(1600-1028 B.C.)\n\nPart ONE\n\n1.-\n\nPeriod, origin, material culture\n\nAbout 1600 BC we come at last into the realm of history. Of the Shang dynasty, which now followed, we have knowledge both from later texts and from excavations and the documents they have brought to light. The Shang civilization, an evident off-shoot of the Lung-shan culture (Tai, Yao, and Tunguses), but also with elements of the Hsia culture (with Tibetan and Mongol and/or Turkish elements), was beyond doubt a high civilization. Of the origin of the Shang State we have no details, nor do we know how the Hsia culture passed into the Shang culture.\n\nThe central territory of the Shang realm lay in north-western Honan, alongside the Shansi mountains and extending into the plains. It was a peasant civilization with towns. One of these towns has been excavated. It adjoined the site of the present town of Anyang, in the province of Honan. The town, the Shang capital from 1300 to 1028 BC, was probably surrounded by a mud wall, as were the settlements of the Lung-shan people. In the centre was what evidently was the ruler's palace. Round this were houses probably inhabited by artisans; for the artisans formed a sort of intermediate class, as dependents of the ruling class. From inscriptions we know that the Shang had, in addition to their capital, at least two other large cities and many smaller town-like settlements and villages. The rectangular houses were built in a style still found in Chinese houses, except that their front did not always face south as is now the general rule. The Shang buried their kings in large, subterranean, cross-shaped tombs outside the city, and many implements, animals and human sacrifices were buried together with them. The custom of large burial mounds, which later became typical of the Chou dynasty, did not yet exist.\n\nThe Shang had sculptures in stone, an art which later more or less completely disappeared and which was resuscitated only in post-Christian times under the influence of Indian Buddhism. Yet, Shang culture cannot well be called a \"megalithic\" culture. Bronze implements and especially bronze vessels were cast in the town. We even know the trademarks of some famous bronze founders. The bronze weapons are still similar to those from Siberia, and are often ornamented in the so-called \"animal style\", which was used among all the nomad peoples between the Ordos region and Siberia until the beginning of the Christian era. On the other hand, the famous bronze vessels are more of southern type, and reveal an advanced technique that has scarcely been excelled since.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the bronze vessels were used for religious service and not for everyday life. For everyday use there were earthenware vessels. Even in the middle of the first millennium BC, bronze was exceedingly dear, as we know from the records of prices.\n\nChina has always suffered from scarcity of metal. For that reason metal was accumulated as capital, entailing a further rise in prices; when prices had reached a sufficient height, the stocks were thrown on the market and prices fell again. Later, when there was a metal coinage, this cycle of inflation and deflation became still clearer. The metal coinage was of its full nominal value, so that it was possible to coin money by melting down bronze implements. As the money in circulation was increased in this way, the value of the currency fell. Then it paid to turn coin into metal implements. This once more reduced the money in circulation and increased the value of the remaining coinage. Thus through the whole course of Chinese history the scarcity of metal and insufficiency of production of metal continually produced extensive fluctuations of the stocks and the value of metal, amounting virtually to an economic law in China. Consequently metal implements were never universally in use, and vessels were always of earthenware, with the further result of the early invention of porcelain. Porcelain vessels have many of the qualities of metal ones, but are cheaper.\n\nThe earthenware vessels used in this period are in many cases already very near to porcelain: there was a pottery of a brilliant white, lacking only the glaze which would have made it into porcelain. Patterns were stamped on the surface, often resembling the patterns on bronze articles. This ware was used only for formal, ceremonial purposes. For daily use there was also a perfectly simple grey pottery.\n\nSilk was already in use at this time. The invention of sericulture must therefore have dated from very ancient times in China. It undoubtedly originated in the south of China, and at first not only the threads spun by the silkworm but those made by other caterpillars were also used. The remains of silk fabrics that have been found show already an advanced weaving technique. In addition to silk, various plant fibres, such as hemp, were in use. Woolen fabrics do not seem to have been yet used.\n\nThe Shang were agriculturists, but their implements were still rather primitive. There was no real plough yet; hoes and hoe-like implements were used, and the grain, mainly different kinds of millet and some wheat, was harvested with sickles. The materials, from which these implements were made, were mainly wood and stone; bronze was still too expensive to be utilized by the ordinary farmer. As a great number of vessels for wine in many different forms have been excavated, we can assume that wine, made from special kinds of millet, was a popular drink.\n\nThe Shang state had its centre in northern Honan, north of the Yellow river. At various times, different towns were made into the capital city; Yin-ch', their last capital and the only one which has been excavated, was their sixth capital. We do not know why the capitals were removed to new locations; it is possible that floods were one of the main reasons. The area under more or less organized Shang control comprised towards the end of the dynasty the present provinces of Honan, western Shantung, southern Hopei, central and south Shansi, east Shensi, parts of Kiangsu and Anhui. We can only roughly estimate the size of the population of the Shang state. Late texts say that at the time of the annihilation of the dynasty, some 3.1 million free men and 1.1 million serfs were captured by the conquerors; this would indicate a population of at least some 4-5 millions. This seems a possible number, if we consider that an inscription of the tenth century BC which reports about an ordinary war against a small and unimportant western neighbour, speaks of 13,081 free men and 4,812 serfs taken as prisoners.\n\nInscriptions mention many neighbors of the Shang with whom they were in more or less continuous state of war. Many of these neighbors can now be identified. We know that Shansi at that time was inhabited by Ch'iang tribes, belonging to the Tibetan culture, as well as by Ti tribes, belonging to the northern culture, and by Hsien-yn and other tribes, belonging to the north-western culture; the centre of the Ch'iang tribes was more in the south-west of Shansi and in Shensi. Some of these tribes definitely once formed a part of the earlier Hsia state. The identification of the eastern neighbors of the Shang presents more difficulties. We might regard them as representatives of the Tai and Yao cultures.\n\n2\n\nWriting and Religion\n\nNot only the material but also the intellectual level attained in the Shang period was very high. We meet for the first time with writing--much later than in the Middle East and in India. Chinese scholars have succeeded in deciphering some of the documents discovered, so that we are able to learn a great deal from them. The writing is a rudimentary form of the present-day Chinese script, and like it a pictorial writing, but also makes use, as today, of many phonetic signs.\n\nThere were, however, a good many characters that no longer exist, and many now used are absent. There were already more than 3,000 characters in use of which some 1,000 can now be read. (Today newspapers use some 3,000 characters; scholars have command of up to 8,000; the whole of Chinese literature, ancient and modern, comprises some 50,000 characters.) With these 3,000 characters the Chinese of the Shang period were able to express themselves well.\n\nThe still existing fragments of writing of this period are found almost exclusively on tortoiseshells or on other bony surfaces, and they represent oracles. As early as in the Lung-shan culture there was divination by means of \"oracle bones\", at first without written characters. In the earliest period any bones of animals (especially shoulder-bones) were used; later only tortoiseshell. For the purpose of the oracle a depression was burnt in the shell so that cracks were formed on the other side, and the future was foretold from their direction. Subsequently particular questions were scratched on the shells, and the answers to them; these are the documents that have come down to us. In Anyang tens of thousands of these oracle bones with inscriptions have been found. The custom of asking the oracle and of writing the answers on the bones spread over the borders of the Shang state and continued in some areas after the end of the dynasty.\n\nThe bronze vessels of later times often bear long inscriptions, but those of the Shang period have only very brief texts. On the other hand, they are ornamented with pictures, as yet largely unintelligible, of countless deities, especially in the shape of animals or birdsâpictures that demand interpretation. The principal form on these bronzes is that of the so-called T'ao-t'ieh, a hybrid with the head of a water-buffalo and tiger's teeth.\n\nThe Shang period had a religion with many nature deities, especially deities of fertility. There was no systematized pantheon, different deities being revered in each locality, often under the most varied names. These various deities were, however, similar in character, and later it occurred often that many of them were combined by the priests into a single god. The composite deities thus formed were officially worshipped. Their primeval forms lived on, however, especially in the villages, many centuries longer than the Shang dynasty. The sacrifices associated with them became popular festivals, and so these gods or their successors were saved from oblivion; some of them have lived on in popular religion to the present day. The supreme god of the official worship was called Shang Ti; he was a god of vegetation who guided all growth and birth and was later conceived as a forefather of the races of mankind. The earth was represented as a mother goddess, who bore the plants and animals procreated by Shang Ti. In some parts of the Shang realm the two were conceived as a married couple who later were parted by one of their children. The husband went to heaven, and the rain is the male seed that creates life on earth. In other regions it was supposed that in the beginning of the world there was a world-egg, out of which a primeval god came, whose body was represented by the earth: his hair formed the plants, and his limbs the mountains and valleys. Every considerable mountain was also itself a god and, similarly, the river god, the thunder god, cloud, lightning, and wind gods, and many others were worshipped.\n\nIn order to promote the fertility of the earth, it was believed that sacrifices must be offered to the gods. Consequently, in the Shang realm and the regions surrounding it there were many sorts of human sacrifices; often the victims were prisoners of war. One gains the impression that many wars were conducted not as wars of conquest but only for the purpose of capturing prisoners, although the area under Shang control gradually increased towards the west and the south-east, a fact demonstrating the interest in conquest. In some regions men lurked in the spring for people from other villages; they slew them, sacrificed them to the earth, and distributed portions of the flesh of the sacrifice to the various owners of fields, who buried them. At a later time all human sacrifices were prohibited, but we have reports down to the eleventh century A.D., and even later, that such sacrifices were offered secretly in certain regions of central China. In other regions a great boat festival was held in the spring, to which many crews came crowded in long narrow boats. At least one of the boats had to capsize; the people who were thus drowned were a sacrifice to the deities of fertility. This festival has maintained its fundamental character to this day, in spite of various changes. The same is true of other festivals, customs, and conceptions, vestiges of which are contained at least in folklore.\n\nIn addition to the nature deities which were implored to give fertility, to send rain, or to prevent floods and storms, the Shang also worshipped deceased rulers and even dead ministers as a kind of intermediaries between man and the highest deity, Shang Ti. This practice may be regarded as the forerunner of \"ancestral worship\" which became so typical of later China.\n\n3\n\nTransition to feudalism\n\nAt the head of the Shang state was a king, posthumously called a \"Ti\", the same word as in the name of the supreme god. We have found on bones the names of all the rulers of this dynasty and even some of their pre-dynastic ancestors. These names can be brought into agreement with lists of rulers found in the ancient Chinese literature. The ruler seems to have been a high priest, too; and around him were many other priests. We know some of them now so well from the inscriptions that their biographies could be written. The king seems to have had some kind of bureaucracy. There were \"chen\", officials who served the ruler personally, as well as scribes and military officials. The basic army organization was in units of one hundred men which were combined as \"right\", \"left\" and \"central\" units into an army of 300 men. But it seems that the central power did not extend very far. In the more distant parts of the realm were more or less independent lords, who recognized the ruler only as their supreme lord and religious leader. We may describe this as an early, loose form of the feudal system, although the main element of real feudalism was still absent. The main obligations of these lords were to send tributes of grain, to participate with their soldiers in the wars, to send tortoise shells to the capital to be used there for oracles, and to send occasionally cattle and horses. There were some thirty such dependent states.\n\nAlthough we do not know much about the general population, we know that the rulers had a patrilinear system of inheritance. After the death of the ruler his brothers followed him on the throne, the older brothers first. After the death of all brothers, the sons of older or younger brothers became rulers. No preference was shown to the son of the oldest brother, and no preference between sons of main or of secondary wives is recognizable. Thus, the Shang patrilinear system was much less extreme than the later system. Moreover, the deceased wives of the rulers played a great role in the cult, another element which later disappeared. From these facts and from the general structure of Shang religion it has been concluded that there was a strong matrilinear strain in Shang culture. Although this cannot be proved, it seems quite plausible because we know of matrilinear societies in the South of China at later times.\n\nAbout the middle of the Shang period there occurred interesting changes, probably under the influence of nomad peoples from the north-west.\n\nIn religion there appears some evidence of star-worship. The deities seem to have been conceived as a kind of celestial court of Shang Ti, as his \"officials\". In the field of material culture, horse-breeding becomes more and more evident. Some authors believe that the art of riding was already known in late Shang times, although it was certainly not yet so highly developed that cavalry units could be used in war. With horse-breeding the two-wheeled light war chariot makes its appearance. The wheel was already known in earlier times in the form of the potter's wheel. Recent excavations have brought to light burials in which up to eighteen chariots with two or four horses were found together with the owners of the chariots. The cart is not a Chinese invention but came from the north, possibly from Turkish peoples. It has been contended that it was connected with the war chariot of the Near East: shortly before the Shang period there had been vast upheavals in western Asia, mainly in connection with the expansion of peoples who spoke Indo-European languages (Hittites, etc.) and who became successful through the use of quick, light, two-wheeled war-chariots. It is possible, but cannot be proved, that the war-chariot spread through Central Asia in connection with the spread of such Indo-European-speaking groups or by the intermediary of Turkish tribes.\n\nWe have some reasons to believe that the first Indo-European-speaking groups arrived in the Far East in the middle of the second millennium B.C. Some authors even connect the Hsia with these groups. In any case, the maximal distribution of these people seems to have been to the western borders of the Shang state. As in Western Asia, a Shang-time chariot was manned by three men: the warrior who was a nobleman, his driver, and his servant who handed him arrows or other weapons when needed. There developed a quite close relationship between the nobleman and his chariot-driver. The chariot was a valuable object, manufactured by specialists; horses were always expensive and rare in China, and in many periods of Chinese history horses were directly imported from nomadic tribes in the North or West. Thus, the possessors of vehicles formed a privileged class in the Shang realm; they became a sort of nobility, and the social organization began to move in the direction of feudalism. One of the main sports of the noblemen in this period, in addition to warfare, was hunting. The Shang had their special hunting grounds south of the mountains which surround Shansi province, along the slopes of the T'ai-hang mountain range, and south to the shores of the Yellow river. Here, there were still forests and swamps in Shang time, and boars, deer, buffaloes and other animals, as well as occasional rhinoceros and elephants, were hunted. None of these wild animals was used as a sacrifice; all sacrificial animals, such as cattle, pigs, etc., were domesticated animals.\n\nBelow the nobility we find large numbers of dependent people; modern Chinese scholars call them frequently \"slaves\" and speak of a \"slave society\". There is no doubt that at least some farmers were \"free farmers\"; others were what we might call \"serfs\": families in hereditary group dependence upon some noble families and working on land which the noble families regarded as theirs. Families of artisans and craftsmen also were hereditary servants of noble families--a type of social organization which has its parallels in ancient Japan and in later India and other parts of the world. There were also real slaves: persons who were the personal property of noblemen. The independent states around the Shang state also had serfs. When the Shang captured neighboring states, they resettled the captured foreign aristocracy by attaching them as a group to their own noblemen. The captured serfs remained under their masters and shared their fate. The same system was later practiced by the Chou after their conquest of the Shang state.\n\nThe conquests of late Shang added more territory to the realm than could be coped with by the primitive communications of the time. When the last ruler of Shang made his big war, which lasted 260 days against the tribes in the south-east, rebellions broke out which lead to the end of the dynasty, about 1028 B.C. according to the new chronology (1122 B.C. old chronology).\n\nPart TWO\n\nThe Shang Dynasty Rulers\n\nResidences: Bo (Caoxian /Shandong), Ao or (Yingyang /Henan), Xiang (Neihuang /Henan), Geng [Xing] or (Xingtai /Hebei or Wenxian /Henan), Bi (Yuncheng /Shandong), Yan (Qufu /Shandong), Yin or called Beimeng (Anyang /Henan), Mo or Chaoge (Qixian /Henan)\n\nFirst ancestor Xie (son of Gao Xin, grandson of Jiao Ji, great-grandson of Xuan Ao, and great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor [Huang Di]; dynastic title Shang Jia.\n\nson: Zhao Ming\n\nson: Xiang Tu\n\nson: Chang Ruo\n\nson: Cao Yu\n\nson: Ming\n\nson: Zhen or Wang Hai\n\nson: Wei or Shang Jia Wei\n\nson: Bao Ding (Baoding) (in oracle texts after Bao Bing)\n\nson: Bao Yi\n\nson: Bao Bing\n\nson: Zhu Ren or Shi Ren\n\nson: Zhu Gui or Shi Gui\n\nson: Tian Yi or Da Yi , called Cheng Tang\n\nKINGS\n\nShang\n\n(Tang \"the Perfect\") (1675â1646)\n\nYilu had a son called Yao Situ, he was appointed as Vassal by Xia King by his contribution to his people and after 13 generations, born a man called Zhuggui, father of Tang. He was the head of his tribe for more than 17 years, and during that time period, he employed wise men as civil officials and revamped his government. Tang married Jiandi, daughter of Gaoxin. After 18 years as leader of Shang tribe, which was Xia's state, seeing that the Xia Dynasty has began to falter, Tang initiated eleven wars against Xia Dynasty, taking large quantities of land and subduing many vassal states. After an internal rebellion in Xia, Tang swept away the Xia armies in one final victory. He then set Jie into exile until he died. In the 19th year of his regime (2nd year after defeated Xia), there was a drought. The Di and Qiang people sent envoy to worship him, also regarded him as their king. In the 20th year of his regime, there was a drought and the last king Jie of Xia died at Tingshan. He banned dancing and singing, in order to plead with heaven to rain. In the 21st year of his regime, there was drought again. Tang made Golden coins to be given to the poor family that sold their children caused by the drought, so that they can buy their children back.From the 22nd year to 24th year of his regime, there was still drought. After 5 years of continuous drought, Tang prayed at Sanglin, promised that if it did not rain, he will sacrifice himself to the God who in charge of Raining. Finally it rained.In the 25th year of his regime, he wrote Dahu music. This year was the first time he hunted. In the 27th year of his regime, he moved the 9 bronze vessels, or ding, made by Yu of Xia, to the Shang Palace. In the 29th year of his regime, he died. He ruled 13 years after defeated Xia.\n\nTai Ding\n\nEldest son of King Tang but sources are conflicted as to whether he actually succeeded his father In the Records of the Grand Historian he was said by Sima Qian to have died at an early age without succeeding his father King Tang and the throne passed to his younger brother Wai Bing\n\nWai Bing.\n\nSon of Tang, succeeded his father following the earlier death of his elder brother Tai Ding . He was enthroned in the year of Yihai (Chinese) with Yi Yin as his prime minister and Bo as his capital. He ruled for about 2 years before his death.\n\nZhong Ren\n\nSon of Tang and younger brother of Wai Bing. He was enthroned with Yi Yin as his prime minister and Bo as he capital. He ruled for 4 years before his death.\n\nTai Jia\n\nGrandson of Tang, he succeeded his uncle Zhong Ren in the year 1535 B.C. with Yi Yin as his prime minister and Bo as his capital. He was an autocratic ruler who treated his people badly and broke his own laws. A few years into his reign saw internal disorder among the court. Prime Minister Yi Yin advised him to change his ways but the headstrong king ignored the advice of the elder statesman. Eventually Yi Yin had no other choice but to exile the king. Yi Yin ruled the country as regent for three years until he felt that the king had sufficiently changed and invited him back to the capital to reclaim his throne. From that point on the king took care of his people and managed the government well. So that in the 10th year of his reign Yi Yin resigned from his post and retired, honoring the king, after his death. The Bamboo Annals however tell a very different story; claiming that after the exile Yi Yin seized the throne and ruled as king for seven years later until Tai Jia secretly retured to the palace killed his former Prime Minister. Afterwards the king assigned Yi Yin's land and castle to his sons, Yi She and Yi Fen. Since archaeological evidence shows that Yi Yin was still worshipped by the Shang people several hundred years after his death the former account is widely considered the more reliable. According to both sources the king ruled for 12 years before death.\n\nWo Ding\n\nSon of Tai Jia, he was enthroned with Qinshi as his prime minister and Bo as he capital. In the 8th year of his reign, he conducted ceremonies to honour Yi Yin, the previous prime minister. He ruled for 19 years (other sources say 29 years) before his death.\n\nTai Geng\n\nSon of Tai Jia and the younger brother of Wo Ding, he was enthroned with Bo as his capital. He ruled for 25 years (although the Bamboo Annals claim 5 years)\n\nXiao Jia\n\nSon of Tai Geng, he succeeded his brother Tai Geng with Bo as his capital. He ruled for 17 years\n\nYong Ji\n\nBrother of Xiao Jia, he was enthroned with Bo as his capital. He ruled for 12 years.The dynasty began to decline under his rule.\n\nTai Wu\n\nThe Dunhuang Star Map\n\nYounger brother of Yong Ji, he was enthroned with Bo as his capital. He appointed Yishe and Chenhu as his higher officers. In the 7th years of his reign, a sang tree and millet were found growing together in his palace. In the 11th year of his reign, he ordered Wu Xian (an astronomer) to pray at Shanchuan. In the 26th year of his reign, the Queen of West Rong sent an envoy to Shang, the king later sent Wangmeng on a return visit. In the 31st year of his reign, he appointed Zhongyan of Fee vassal as position of Chezheng. In the 35th year of his reign, he wrote a poem called Yanche. In the 46th year of his reign, there was a great harvest of crops. In the 58th year of his reign, he built the city of Pugu. In the 61st year of his reign, the nine east Barbarians Yi tribes sent envoys to Shang. He ruled for 75 years.\n\nZhong Ding\n\nSon of Tai Wu, he was enthroned with Bo as his capital. In the first year of his reign he moved his capital to Ao . In the sixth year of his reign he attacked the Blue Barbarians . He ruled for 11 years (other sources say 9 years) before his death.\n\nWai Ren\n\nSon of Tai Wu and younger brother of Zhong Ding, he was enthroned with Ao as his capital. During his reign there was a rebellion from Shang's vassals of Pei and Xian peoples. He ruled for 15 years (although the Bamboo Annals claim 10 years) before his death.\n\nHe Dan Jia\n\nSon of Tai Wu and younger brother of Wai Ren, he was enthroned with Ao as his capital. In the first year of his reign, he moved his capital to Xiang. In the third year of his reign, his Minister Pengbo conquered Pei who had rebelled against his father. In the fourth year of his reign he launched another attack against the Blue Barbarians. In the fifth year of his reign the Xian occupied Banfang but were later defeated by the king's ministers Pengbo and Weibo and sent an envoy to the Shang. He ruled for 9 years before his death.\n\nZu Yi\n\nSon of He Dan Jia, he was enthroned with Xiang as his capital. In the first year of his reign he moved his capital to Geng where he held a ceremony and wrote the article of Zuyi. The following year he moved his capital again, this time to Bi where six years later his palace was completed. During his reign the Shang became stronger than ever thanks to some fine appointments including Wuxian as his prime minister in the third year of his reign and Gaowei as his vassal in the fifteenth year of his reign. He ruled for about 19 years before his death.\n\nZu Xin\n\nSon of Zu Yi, he was enthroned with Bi as his capital. He ruled for about 16 years before his death.\n\nWo Jia\n\nSon of Zu Yi and the younger brother of Zu Xin, he was enthroned with Bi as his capital. He ruled for about 25 years (although other sources claim 20 years) before his death.\n\nZu Ding\n\nSon of zu Xin, he was enthroned with Bi as his capital. He ruled for about 32 years before his death.\n\nNan Geng\n\nSon of Wo Jia, he succeeded his cousin Zu Ding, he was enthroned with Bi as his capital. In the third year of his reign he moved his captical to Yan . He ruled for about 29 years before his death.\n\nYang Jia\n\nSon of Zu Ding, he succeeding his father's cousin Nen Geng and e was enthroned with Yan as his capital. In the third year of his reign he sent troops against the barbarians of Danshan . He ruled for about 17 years (although other sources claim 7 years) before his death. The country was in decline during his reign.\n\nPan Geng\n\nClassic of History\n\nSon of Zu Ding and the younger brother of Yang Jiah e was enthroned with Yan as his capital and in the seventh year of his regime, the Ying vassal came to Yan to pay homage to him. In the fourteenth year of his reign he moved his capital to Beimeng (renaming it Yin); henceforth the Shang dynasty was also called the Yin Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of his reign he reviewed his army at the new capital and in the nineteenth year of his reign he assigned his minister Fen in Yawei.He ruled about 28 years according to both the Bamboo Annals and the Records of the Grand Historian\n\nXiao Xin\n\nSon of Zu Ding and the younger brother of Pan Geng he was enthroned with Yin as his capital. He ruled for 3 years. The country declined again in his reign.\n\nXiao Yi\n\nSon of Zu Ding and the younger brother of Xiao he was enthroned with Yin as his capital. In the sixth year of his reign he ordered his son Wu Ding to live at He and study at Ganpan. He ruled for 10 years before his death.\n\nWu Ding\n\nHe succeeded his father Xiao Yi and was enthroned with Gan Pan as his prime minister and Yin as his capital. He cultivated the allegiance of neighbouring tribes by marrying one woman from each of them. His favoured consort Fu Hao entered the royal household through such a marriage and took advantage of the semi-matriarchal slave society to rise through the ranks to military general and high priestess.\n\nFu Hao - Queen and top general of King Wuding of Shang\n\nFu Hao, also known as Houmuxing, was a key player in the rise of the fortunes of the Shang Dynasty. She married King Wuding (r. 1250-1192 BCE), and with an army of 13,000 at her command, she was the Shang general with the largest number of troops during the reign of Wuding. King Wuding fought many wars against the peoples on the borders of the Shang Empire. Fu Hao led the campaign against the Jiang tribes, taking many of the Jiang captive. She also directed the campaigns against the Tu, Ba and Yi peoples, with key Shang generals Zhi and Hou Gao reporting to her. Her victory against the Ba people was the earliest recorded instance of a large scale ambush in Chinese history. King Wuding gave Fu Hao a fiefdom on the borders of his empire, from which she could defend his borders and launch assaults against foreign peoples. In addition to crushing both domestic and foreign foes of King Wuding, Fu Hao served as a high priestess, conducting sacrifices to appease Heaven and honor the ancestors. She also held the office of oracle-reader. Fu Hao was apparently a very important public figure; the ancient Shang writings describe her military expeditions, religious rites, personal health, and other aspects of her life in detail. In Anyang, archeologists found caves which were repositories of Shang records. Fu Hao was mentioned more than 200 times in the contents of one cave alone. After Fu Hao's death, Wuding buried his beloved queen in a grand tomb filled with thousands of exquisite works of art. In 1976, Fu Hao's tomb was discovered untouched in Anyang, Henan Province. It contained many weapons and implements of war, including a large bronze battle axe - the symbol of her military authority. Fu Hao is certainly not the only female military leader of China's Bronze Age. Another tomb of a female military commander, dated to the Western Zhou era (which followed the Shang Dynasty) has been found in Changping County, Beijing. It contained a hoard of battle-ready weapons - such as long range bows, double-pointed lances, spears, pikes, battle-axes, long-bladed sabres, short swords, daggers, helmets and shields.\n\nIn the third year of his reign King Wu Ding he had vivid dreams about the way to rule his kingdom.

In the thirty-second year of his reign, he sent troops to Guifang and after three years of fighting he conquered it. The Di and Qiang barbarians immediately sent envoys to Shang to negotiate.

Several years later, Jili defeated the Rong people at Xitu and captured three generals and reported the victory to king Wen Ding.

He assigned Jiu, Zhou and Er as his dukes. In the Records of the Grand Historian, Sima Qian wrote that Di Xin, in the early part of his reign, had abilities which surpassed the ordinary man, was quick-witted and quick-tempered. In legend, he was intelligent enough to win all of his arguments, and he was strong enough to hunt wild beasts with his bare hands. He was the younger brother of Wei Zi and Wei Zhong (both children of a concubine) and father of Wu Geng and Lu Fu. His father Di Yi had two brothers, Ji Zi and Bi Gan. Di Xin added to the territory of Shang by battling the tribes surrounding it, including the Dongyi to the east.\n\nIn the 3rd year of his regime, people found a hawk hatched in a sparrow nest at the corner of the city.

In fictionalizations, including the novel Fengshen Yanyi, she was said to be possessed by a malevolent fox spirit. One of the most famous forms of entertainment Zhou enjoyed was the \"Alcohol Pool and Meat Forest\". A large pool, big enough for several canoes, was constructed on the Palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. This allowed for the entire pool to be filled with alcohol. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had branches made of roasted meat skewers hanging over the pool. This allowed Zhou and his friends and concubines to drift on canoes in the pool. When they thirst, they reached down into the pool with their hands and drank the wine. When they hungerred, they reached up with their hands to eat the roasted meat. This was considered one of the most famous examples of decadence and corruption of a ruler in Chinese history. In order to please Daji, he created the \"Cannon Burning Punishment\". One large bronze cylinder covered with oil was placed on top of a pile of burning charcoal. Prisoners were made to walk on top of the slowly heating cylinder. As the cylinder became hot, the prisoners are forced to shift their feet to avoid the burning. In turn, the oil made it difficult for the prisoners to maintain their stance. If they fell into the charcoal, they would burn to death. The prisoners are thus forced to dance in agony and fear, screaming in prolonged pain, while Zhou and Daji laughed at the tortured dances. Eventually, the prisoners would fall into the charcoal and burn to death.Zhou and Daji were known to get highly aroused after watching such victims. Victims ranged from civilians and prisoners to high government officials, including Mei Bo.\n\nIn June of 10th year of his regime, he hunted at the west suburban. In the 17th year of his regime, his vassal Zhou sent troops to Qu. In the winter, he swam at Qi.

In December, the vassals of Yong, Shu, Qiang, Mao, Wei, Lu, Peng and Pu all followed Zhou to fight Shang.\n\nThe Battle of Muye\n\nDuke Wu of Zhou led an army of about 50,000. Di Xin's army was at war in the east, but he still had about 530,000 men to defend the capital city of Yin. But to further secure his victory, he gave weapons to about 130,000 slaves to protect the capital. The slaves did not want to fight for the corrupted Shang Dynasty, and defected to the Zhou army instead. This event greatly lowered the moral of the Shang troops. When engaged, many Shang soldiers did not fight and held their spears upside down, as a sign that they no longer wanted to fight for the corrupted Shang. Some Shang soldiers joined the Zhou side altogether. Still, many loyal Shang troops fought on, and a very bloody battle followed. The Zhou troops were much better trained, and their morale was high. In one of the Chariot charges, Duke Wu broke though the Shang 's defense line. Di Xin was forced to flee to his palace, and the remaining Shang troops fell into further chaos. The Zhou were victorious and showed little mercy to the defeated Shang, shedding enough blood \"to float a log\". After the battle, Di Xin placed many valuable jewelry on himself, and lighted a fire and burned himself to death in his palace. Duke Wu personally killed Daji after he found her. Shang officials were released without charges, and some later worked as Zhou officials. The imperial rice storage was opened right after the battle, to feed the starving population. This Battle leaves Duke Wu as master of all of Shang's important cities. Duke Wu proclaimed the Zhou dynasty as King Wu of Zhou.\n\nMain Source. Wikipedia Shang Dinasty\n\nCHAPTER III."
