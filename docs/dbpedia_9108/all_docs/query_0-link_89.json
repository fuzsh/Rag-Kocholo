        "text": "The paper offers an overview and short discussion of contemporary assessments of 'the Romans' and the Roman Empire in literary and documentary sources from the great Eastern trade routes between the Mediterranean Sea and Ancient China. The paper also proposes new interpretations of the sections on Imperial Rome in the Hou Hanshu and the Weilüe from ancient China.\n\nA broad-brushstroke analysis of ways in which the 4th-century Roman empire was highly unusual, and very different to modern empires. Firstly, power within it was often divided between more than one emperor (definitively at the end of the century), and yet, although civil wars were frequent, these were not as disastrous as we'd expect. Secondly, the emperors, and effective power, were located in the 4th-century, not in centrally-placed capitals, but in the empire's periphery (its 'military-belt'); yet somehow in the 5th century the emperors returned to ruling from centrally-placed capitals (very effectively in the case of the eastern empire and Constantinople). Thirdly and finally, although there is plenty of evidence of social unrest, there is very little evidence of the provincial ruling classes seeking independence; at least at an aristocratic level people appear to have been happy to be within the empire."
