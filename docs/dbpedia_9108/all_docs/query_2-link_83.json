        "text": "This chapter focuses on the two dozen words of Qing's own language that Joseph Orpen transmitted to us in his famous 1874 paper, 'A Glimpse into the Mythology of the Maluti Bushmen’, and which were obtained in the course of conversations where he attempted to elicit the meanings of the rock paintings around them. These few words are a slender body of evidence, yet still enough to confirm that Qing’s own language would have had close affinities with the handful of only mildly differentiated ǃUi dialects once spoken south and north of the Gariep. This validates approaches that make comparative reference to the archival ǀXam material. At the same time, they confirm the widespread and in some cases early uptake of loanwords from Khoekhoe sources. Lastly, the presence of a number of words that are rather ‘unKhoesan-like’, and really appear to be either Sotho or Nguni, if not in fact Phuthi, tells us that Qing’s forebears, like the speakers of the Orange Free State Seroa, must have been part of a rather intricate social nexus. The message of Qing’s own words appears to be that we might obtain a more complete understanding of the painted records on the rocks if we allow ourselves to imagine a more complex social setting as our starting point. In such a scenario, the speakers of ǃUi languages and their descendants would not be seen as uniquely authorised interpreters, with privileged access to and understanding of some supposedly pristine (even ‘primordial’) 'Bushman' cosmology, but rather as one among several groups of people who participated from the very outset in a regional dialogue of continually intersecting — and changing — social, economic and cultural relations."
