        "text": "Symbols Begin to Appear on Chinese Coins\n\nMany of the very earliest forms of Chinese money had inscriptions (legends) which identified the state or kingdom where they were cast. Some included their value as well, and examples of some of these early forms of money can be seen at Chinese Spade Charms.\n\nGradually, other notations such as dots, crescents, circles, lines and blobs began to appear on Chinese coins. These simple symbols can be \"in relief\" (yangwen 阳文), where they protrude above the surface of the coin, or they may be carved, engraved or incused (yinwen 阴文) into the coin.\n\nWhile these simple symbols are not well understood, they are believed to represent stars, moons, suns, numbers, etc.\n\nA theory on the meaning of these symbols is discussed at Ancient Chinese Charm Symbols: Star, Moon, Cloud and Dragon.\n\nThese early symbols on Chinese coins were the beginning of the evolution that eventually resulted in the \"charms\" and \"amulets\" of the next 2,000 years.\n\nPresented below is a brief description of these first symbols as they appeared on early Chinese coins.\n\nZhou Dynasty Round Coins\n\nThis small coin was one of the first examples of \"round\" coins from the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nIt was also one of the first coins to have a square center hole instead of a round one.\n\nThe coin was cast in the ancient state of Yan during the period 300-220 BC.\n\nThe inscription is read right to left as yi hua (一化).\n\nThe inscription was previously believed to be yi dao (一刀) or \"one knife\".\n\nThese coins always have a plain and very flat reverse side.\n\nIt is very rare to see any marks or symbols on the reverse side of these coins. To the best of my knowledge, only a very few coins with the Chinese character ji (吉) or gong (工) on the reverse have ever been found.\n\nWhat is distinctive about this particular coin is the very large \"dot\" (xing 星) at the five o'clock position. This dot is just inside the rim and protrudes almost 0.75 mm above the face of the coin.\n\nGiven the method of casting at the time, this \"dot\" would almost certainly have been intentional.\n\nDots on coins are believed to symbolize \"stars\". This tradition of placing such a symbol on coins, which must have begun about the time this coin was cast, would continue for the next two millennia.\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 19 mm and a weight of 1.5 grams.\n\nThe wu zhu coin shown here was probably also cast during the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n\nIt has what appears to be a series of four \"stars\" on its reverse side below the square hole.\n\nAlso, just above and to the left of the \"stars\" is a small crescent which may be a \"moon\".\n\nAs is the case with the very oldest coins with charm-like symbols, the exact meaning and intent are unclear.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24.5 mm and a weight of 2.8 grams.\n\nThe Eastern Han wu zhu displayed here has five stars above the square hole.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24 mm and a weight of 2.8 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu also has five dots or stars above the hole but in a different configuration.\n\nThe diameter is 25 mm and the weight is 2.1 grams.\n\nThis Eastern Han wu zhu has a series of five stars below the square hole on its obverse side.\n\nThe coin's diameter is 23.7 mm and its weight is 2.4 grams.\n\nWu Zhu Coin with Circle or \"Sun\"\n\nThe nicely cast wu zhu coin at the left has a \"circle\" below the square hole.\n\nCircles are believed to symbolize the \"sun\".\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 25.2 mm and a weight of 4.1 grams.\n\nWu Zhu Coins with Numbers\n\nThis is another Eastern Han wu zhu coin.\n\nThis particular coin has one horizontal line, or the Chinese character for \"one\" (yi 一), below the hole.\n\nThis short line was not cut or engraved into the coin. Instead, the symbol was designed into the mold and protrudes above the surface of the coin the same as the Chinese characters wu zhu (五 铢).\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 26.4 mm and the weight is 3.1 grams.\n\nThis Eastern Han wu zhu coin has a short bar or Chinese character \"one\" (yi 一) situated above the character wu (五) at the right of the square hole.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 25.9 mm and the weight is 2.8 grams.\n\nOn this wu zhu, the \"one\" (yi 一) is located below the character wu (五) to the right of the square hole.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23.3 mm and a weight of 1.8 grams.\n\nThe obverse side (far left) of this wu zhu coin also has a prominent \"one\" (yi 一) located below the character wu (五).\n\nHowever, the most distinctive characteristic of this coin is the hole which is not square.\n\nMost non-square holes result from insufficient molten bronze flowing to certain parts of the mold. The borders of the holes, in these cases, tend to be very ragged, irregular, and uneven.\n\nThe Han Dynasty coin pictured here is fairly well-made and has a \"number\" symbol meaning it received special attention during its casting. The coin's unusual hole, while not square, is still too regular to have been formed accidentally.\n\nThere are documented reports of similar wu zhu coins having been found with unusual holes which appear to have been intentionally made. An article in the 1987 (7th issue) of the Chinese periodical \"Shaanxi Finance\" (shan xi jin rong 陕西金融) shows rubbings of several wu zhu coins with unusual holes found in a hoard. One coin is very similar to the one displayed here but has only one, in contrast to two, square-like projections extending beyond the normal border of the hole. The article also showed several coins which had triangular-shaped projections extending beyond the border of the inner hole.\n\nThe author of the article says that the coins did not show any indication that the holes were modified by force at some time after their casting. This is also the case with the coin displayed above.\n\nUnfortunately, the author of the article was unable to propose what these distinctive holes may mean or symbolize.\n\nThese coins, with their modified square holes, may very well have been the precursor of the coins with \"flower\" or \"rosette\" holes which were to become fairly common by the time of the Song Dynasty (960-1279). For a detailed discussion of flower hole coins, including many examples, please see Chinese Coins with Flower (Rosette) Holes.\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 26.2 mm and a weight of 2.5 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu also has the Chinese character (yi 一) meaning \"one\".\n\nIn this case, however, the \"one\" is above the \"zhu\" (铢) character at the left of the hole.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 26.2 mm and a weight of 2.4 grams.\n\nOn this wu zhu, the character \"one\" (yi 一) is below the \"zhu\" (铢) character at the left of the hole.\n\nThe diameter is 25.8 mm and the weight is 2.7 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu has two long horizontal lines above the square hole which may represent the Chinese character for \"two\" (er 二).\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23.9 mm and the weight is 2.1 grams.\n\nThe wu zhu coin at the left has two short horizontal lines above the zhu (铢) character at the left of the square hole.\n\nTwo parallel lines represent the Chinese character for \"two\" (er 二).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23.3 mm and a weight of 1.8 grams.\n\nThis coin was actually cast during the \"Six Dynasties\". In Chinese history, the \"Six Dynasties\" refers to the period of disunity, great social upheaval and warfare that existed from the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220 AD to the founding of the Sui Dynasty in 581 AD.\n\nThis time period included the Three Kingdoms (220-280 AD), the Western Jin Dynasty (265-316 AD), the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420 AD), and the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-581 AD).\n\nWhile some very refined coins were cast at this time, most coins were rather crude and inferior.\n\nAt the left is a wu zhu coin from this period.\n\nThe zhu (铢) character to the left of the hole has been simplified so that only its right side component (朱) appears.\n\nWhat is unusual about this wu zhu are the two vertical bars incused just above the hole which probably represent the Chinese character for \"two\" (er 二).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 22.3 mm and a weight of 2.5 grams.\n\nThis Han Dynasty wu zhu coin has a short vertical line or bar above the square hole.\n\nThis symbol may represent the Chinese number \"one\" (yi 一).\n\nThe coin's diameter is 25.65 mm and the weight is 2.6 grams.\n\nThe obverse side of the Han wu zhu coin at the left also has two vertical lines in relief (yangwen 阳文) above the hole.\n\nThe two lines represent the Chinese number \"two\" (er 二) .\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23.4 mm and the weight is 2.1 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu has two vertical lines in relief above the hole on the reverse side of the coin.\n\nThe two lines represent the number \"two\" in Chinese (er 二).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23 mm and a weight of 1.7 grams.\n\nThis Han Dynasty wu zhu has three vertical lines above the square hole.\n\nThree lines represent the Chinese number \"three\" (san 三).\n\nThe diameter is 25.3 mm and the weight is 2.8 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu is similar to the one above except that there are three slanting lines located below the square hole.\n\nThe three lines are believed to represent the Chinese character for \"three\" (san 三).\n\nThe diameter is 22.5 mm and the weight is 1.6 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu (五 铢) has a second wu (五) character meaning \"five\" above the square hole.\n\nThis second wu character is raised above the surface of the coin the same as the Chinese characters to the right and left of the hole.\n\nThis means the second wu character was intentionally engraved into the mold the same as the other characters.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 23 mm and a weight of 2.2 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu (五 铢) coin has another wu (五) character, meaning \"five\", located to the left of the square hole on the reverse side.\n\nUnlike the coin above, this wu character is incused.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24 mm and a weight of 1.8 grams.\n\nIf you closely examine the reverse side of this wu zhu coin you will notice that there is the Chinese character liu (六), which means \"six\", incused at the right of the square hole.\n\nThe character is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nThe incused character was engraved into the coin sometime after it had been cast and was not a feature of the mold from which the coin was made.\n\nThe diameter of the coin 23.5 mm and the weight is 1.6 grams.\n\nThe reverse side of this wu zhu has the Chinese character ba (八), which means \"eight\", incused above the square hole.\n\nIn this example, the ba is upside down.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 22.2 mm and a weight of 1.7 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu has the number \"nine\" (jiu 九) incused (carved) above the hole.\n\nThere is also an incused line running vertically through the wu (五) character on the right.\n\nThe coin's diameter is 26.2 mm and the weight is 3 grams.\n\nThe Chinese coin at the left is a wu zhu cast during the Eastern Han.\n\nThe coin has a large and unusually well made Chinese character \"ten\" (shi 十) below the hole.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23 mm and the weight is 2.6 grams.\n\nThis unusual wu zhu has the Chinese character for \"ten\" (shi 十) above the square hole.\n\nBelow the hole are two dots or \"stars\".\n\nThe \"stars\" and the \"ten\" character are in relief meaning that they protrude above the coin surface and were part of the original design of the mold from which the coin was cast.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24.5 mm and a weight of 2.9 grams.\n\nThe Chinese coin at the left is another wu zhu with the character for \"ten\" (shi 十) incused above the square hole on the obverse side.\n\nUnlike the above coin, however, the \"ten\" was engraved on this coin sometime after it was cast.\n\nThe diameter is 25.9 mm and the weight is 2.8 grams.\n\nAbove the hole on the reverse side of this wu zhu is the Chinese character \"ten\" (shi 十) which protrudes above the surface of the coin.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 22 mm and a weight of 1.4 grams.\n\nThis is the reverse side of another wu zhu.\n\nThe Chinese character for \"ten\" (shi 十) is incused above the square hole.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24.5 mm and a weight of 2 grams.\n\nWu Zhu Coins with Lines\n\nThe obverse side of this wu zhu has a very prominent vertical line (shu 竖) above, and another below, the square hole.\n\nThe diameter is 22.5 mm and the weight is 1.8 grams.\n\nThis is another Eastern Han Dynasty wu zhu coin.\n\nIn this case, there is a long vertical line above and another below the square hole on the reverse side.\n\nSince the lines are raised above the coin surface, they had to have been intentionally included in the mold from which the coin was cast.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23 mm and the weight is 2 grams.\n\nThis is the obverse of another wu zhu.\n\nThe coin displays a long, prominent horizontal line above the square hole .\n\nThe diameter is 20.6 mm and the weight is 1.7 grams.\n\nThis wu zhu coin is distinctive in that it has three slanted lines above, and three slanted lines below, the square hole.\n\nThe slanting lines are raised above the surface.\n\nThe three lines above and the three lines below resemble the symbols on the Western Han ban liang displayed in the \"Ban Liang Coins\" section above.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23 mm and the weight is 1.8 grams.\n\nThe reverse side of this Eastern Han wu zhu has four lines or elongated dots to the left of the square hole.\n\nThe symbols are similar to those on the reverse of a Western Han ban liang above.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 22.6 mm and a weight of 1.4 grams.\n\nThis is an example of a wu zhu that has four oblique lines extending outward from each corner of the hole to the rim on the reverse side.\n\nIn Chinese, this is referred to as si chu (四出). Si (四) means \"four\"and chu (出) means \"going out\".\n\nThe coin is also known as a \"corner coin\" (jiao qian 角钱).\n\nThis coin is believed to have been cast in the year 186 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling of the Eastern Han.\n\nCities in ancient China had walls built around them as a means of protection. It is said that the square hole of this coin represented the city and that the four lines going out represented wealth flowing out, portending the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220 AD.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 25 mm and the weight is 3.1 grams.\n\nThis is another example of a si chu (四出) or \"corner\" coin with four lines radiating outward from the hole.\n\nThis coin, however, is made of iron.\n\nIt was made in 523 AD during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (502-557 AD).\n\nFor reference purposes, this is the obverse side of this Southern Dynasties iron coin.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 20.5 mm and a weight of 2.6 grams.\n\nWu Zhu Coins with Characters and Symbols\n\nThe coin at the left is an Eastern Han wu zhu with the Chinese character xiao (小), meaning \"small\", above the square hole.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, such characters as these may have indicated the area or limits in which these coins were intended to circulate.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 24.3 mm and the weight is 2.1 grams.\n\nThe reverse side of this Eastern Han wu zhu coin has the Chinese character wang (王), rotated 90 degrees, below the square hole.\n\nWang means \"king\" but is a common family name (surname) in China.\n\nThe wang character rises above the field of the coin which means it was a designed into the mold.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 22.7 mm and a weight of 2 grams.\n\nOn the obverse side and below the square hole of this wu zhu is the Chinese character gong (工) meaning \"work\" or \"industry\".\n\nThe gong character is \"in relief\" (yangwen 阳文) meaning it was engraved into the mold the same as the other characters in the inscription.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 23.7 mm and the weight is 2.3 grams.\n\nThis is another wu zhu which displays a very distinct gong (工) character meaning \"work\" or \"industry\".\n\nIn this example, the gong is on the reverse side below the lower left corner of the square hole.\n\nThe diameter is 26 mm and the weight is 2.8 grams.\n\nAnother example of an old Chinese coin displaying auspicious symbols would be this wu zhu coin.\n\nBoth above and below the square hole are swastikas.\n\nThe swastika is a very old Asian symbol.\n\nIt is said that the symbol in China represents the Chinese character wan (万) meaning \"ten-thousand\". The extended meaning would be \"all\" such as \"the myriad things\" as used in the Dao De Jing (道德经), the classic Taoist (Daoist) text written by Lao-zi (老子).\n\nThe diameter of this coin is 23.5 mm and the weight is 2.3 grams.\n\nWang Mang Coins\n\nWang Mang usurped the throne and founded what was to be the very short-lived Xin (Hsin) Dynasty (7-23 AD).\n\nDuring his brief reign, he introduced four major currency reforms which resulted in 37 different kinds of money consisting of different substances (tortoise shell, cowries, gold, silver, copper), different patterns (knife, spade, coin), and different units (values of 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1,000).\n\nNot surprisingly, these reforms caused unprecedented disorder to the monetary system and brought tremendous misery to the people.\n\nWang Mang was assassinated in 23 AD.\n\nThese coins, nevertheless, tend to be of very high artistic value and the coin types exist in a number of varieties. The variations include symbols such as dots, blobs and radiating lines as well as the Chinese characters written in slightly different ways.\n\nBecause of their distinctive style, coins of the Wang Mang era were popularly used as the basis for charms and amulets. Several of these \"Wang Mang\" charms can be seen at Chinese Charms with Coin Inscriptions. Examples of his spade money are displayed at Chinese Spade Charms.\n\nThis is one example of a Wang Mang era coin with distinctive features.\n\nThe inscription is da quan wu shi (大泉五十) which means \"Large Coin Fifty\".\n\nThese coins were cast during the years 7-14 AD.\n\nThe unusual feature of this specific coin is that there are incused lines radiating from the four corners of the hole.\n\nAs explained in the section above concerning wu zhu coins, this feature is referred to as si chu (四出) with si (四) meaning \"four\"and chu (出) meaning \"going out\".\n\nUnlike most coins, however, this same da quan wu shi also has incused lines radiating from the four corners of the hole on the reverse side.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 27.5 mm and a weight of 5.8 grams.\n\nTo see examples of Chinese charms based on da quan wu shi coins, please visit Chinese Charms with Coin Inscriptions.\n\nThis is another example of a Wang Mang era coin with distinctive features.\n\nThe inscription (legend) is read right to left as huo quan (货泉) and these coins were cast beginning in the year 14 AD.\n\nSimilar to the da quan wu shi shown above, this coin also has four lines protruding or radiating from the corners of the square hole.\n\nAdditionally, there are large blobs both above and below the square hole.\n\nThe meaning of these symbols is still unknown.\n\nThere is one additional feature of this coin. It is very thick and heavy. Because of their thickness and weight, these coins are variously known as \"biscuit\" (bing 饼) or \"cake\" coins.\n\nThis coin has a diameter of 23.3 mm and a weight of 7 grams.\n\nWhy Do Old Chinese Coins Have Auspicious Symbols?\n\nThere have been a number of theories as to why certain early symbols such as stars, moons and clouds started appearing on old Chinese coins.\n\nOne theory bases the appearance of these symbols on the ancient Chinese belief of Yin Yang and the Five Elements. For an explanation of this theory please see Ancient Chinese Charm Symbols: Star, Moon, Cloud and Dragon."
