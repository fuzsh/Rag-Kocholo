        "text": "Chinese Royal Bathrooms 2,300 Years Ago\n\nChinese archaeologists have recently excavated 3 royal bathrooms dating back to the Warring States Period (475 BC – 221 BC) on the outskirts of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, where terracotta warriors were unearthed.\n\nThe walls and floors of the bathrooms were decorated with ceramic tiles, and the wet areas were equipped with drainage holes and sewage pipes.\n\nClassic Chinese Bath Culture\n\nBathrooms and urban water supply systems appeared in China as early as the Shang Dynasty, based on the evidence discovered at the Dongzhouyang archaeological site in Henan Province.\n\nThe earliest written reference to Chinese bath culture was recorded with Oracle Turtle Script 3,000 years ago, also during the Shang Dynasty (1700 to 1027 BC). By then bathroom was called 湢 (pronounced bi or bee), and the bathtubs were usually made with bronze or timber.\n\nAn ancient Chinese princess taking a bath\n\nAccording to the Rites of Zhou, a work on the idealistic Zhou Dynasty’s politics and culture mainly compiled during the Spring and Autumn Period around the 6th century BC, it was a requirement for the government officials of the Zhou era to wash their hair every three days and take a bath every five days.\n\nAppropriate bath practice also included using two towels, one for the upper body and one for the lower part of the body, showering with clean warm water after stepping out of the bathtub before drying oneself and putting on clothing. The entire bath ritual was concluded with a drink and a light meal (禮記·玉藻: 浴用二巾 上締下綌 出杅 履蒯席 連用湯 履蒲蓆 衣巾晞身 乃屨 進飲).\n\nEntering the Han Dynasty (206BC–220AD), the government offered the officials to take a day off every five working days for having a bath (休沐). Later in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the bath day (休浣日) was between every ten working days.\n\nIn the fifth century, an emperor of the Liang Kingdom, a culturally and technologically quite advanced Southern Dynasty, personally penned a book titled On Bath (沐浴經).\n\nTo ancient Chinese, taking a bath is not just to keep personal hygiene but to observe civil conduct.\n\nAncient Chinese Bath Gel\n\n2,000 years ago, warm rice water was the most popular body wash gel among Chinese ladies.\n\nCame to the 3rd century, “bath bean (澡豆)”, specially made with mixed navy bean powder, five scented dried plants and flowers, medicinal herbs, egg white, pig pancreas and flour, emerged, which not only clean the body but nourish the skin.\n\nThe ingredients and formula to make the bath bean are explained in detail in Sun Simiao’s Treasured Prescriptions (千金方), a book published in the mid-7th century about traditional Chinese medicine clinical diagnosis and prescriptions.\n\nDuring the Song, the rise in popularity of commercialised public bathrooms saw the mass production of Fat Bean (肥珠子), a soap made with oily fruits and bath beans, which could be easily purchased from most grocery stores.\n\nThe Emerge of Public Bathhouse\n\nAn ancient Chinese female bathhouse\n\nPublic bathhouses did not appear in China until a thousand years ago. Yet during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), commercial male and female bathhouses became so popular that they could be found everywhere in China.\n\nApart from baths and showers, the Song bathhouses also offered back massage and nail cut services and provided tea, liquor, fruits and cakes as refreshments after a bath.\n\nSu Shi, one of the greatest poets in Chinese history, was a patron of the public bathroom and composed a poem reflecting his naked experience:\n\nWater and dirt were on a war\n\nSoon they both rendered naught\n\nA message to the back massager\n\nTake it easy, take it easy\n\nMy body is an illusion\n\nThe dirt is your imagination\n\n水垢何曾相受\n\n细看两俱无有\n\n寄语揩背人\n\n尽日劳君挥肘\n\n轻手, 轻手\n\n居士本来无垢\n\nMost Song bathhouses had water in the pool heated by coal, but the people of the Song Dynasty also exploited natural hot water resources. In the prosperous mid-11th century, just in the city Fuzhou alone, there were over 40 hot spring bathhouses.\n\nWhen Marco Polo visited China during the short-lived Yuan Dynasty under the Mongols’ rule, he could still witness the Song-style bath culture in China and described how the locals got up early and took a bath before having breakfast.\n\nPublic bathhouses during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) were probably the most elaborate. In an encyclopaedia compiled by Ming scholar Lang Ying, under the word “混堂”, the author mentioned public bathhouses in Suzhou. He depicted Suzhou bathhouses as having slabbed floors below and brick dome ceilings above. A huge boiler would be installed in the back of the house providing the bathing pool with hot water through a tunnel, which was powered by a turning wheel motioned by a staff (大石为池，穹幕以砖，后为巨釜，令与池通，辘轳引水，一人专执爨).\n\nAncient Chinese women bathing their babies\n\nAncient Chinese women bathing their kids in a garden"
