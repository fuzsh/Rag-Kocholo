        "text": "I think this brings me just about right up to the 350-400 poems I said I would post.\n\nAnyway, it’s close enough. It is getting harder for me to be sure I’m not re-posting ones I’ve already done. So, this’ll be it. Unless I decide to do a few more sometime, which could happen.\n\nBefore that happens, though, I’ll be working on putting all the previous postings in this category and making a Word .doc file out of them, all in one place. Not today, though, not today.\n\nWithout further ado (always click images for full size):\n\nMeng Jiao\n\nA SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL\n\nLakka-trees ripen two by two\n\nAnd mandarin-ducks die side by side.\n\nIf a true-hearted girl will love only her husband,\n\nIn a life as faithfully lived as theirs,\n\nWhat troubling wave can arrive to vex\n\nA spirit like water in a timeless well?\n\nMeng Jiao\n\nA TRAVELLER’S SONG\n\nThe thread in the hands of a fond-hearted mother\n\nMakes clothes for the body of her wayward boy;\n\nCarefully she sews and thoroughly she mends,\n\nDreading the delays that will keep him late from home.\n\nBut how much love has the inch-long grass\n\nFor three spring months of the light of the sun?\n\nChen Ziang\n\nON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU\n\nWhere, before me, are the ages that have gone?\n\nAnd where, behind me, are the coming generations?\n\nI think of heaven and earth, without limit, without end,\n\nAnd I am all alone and my tears fall down.\n\nLi Qi\n\nAN OLD AIR\n\nThere once was a man, sent on military missions,\n\nA wanderer, from youth, on the You and Yan frontiers.\n\nUnder the horses’ hoofs he would meet his foes\n\nAnd, recklessly risking his seven-foot body,\n\nWould slay whoever dared confront\n\nThose moustaches that bristled like porcupinequills.\n\n…There were dark clouds below the hills, there were white clouds above them,\n\nBut before a man has served full time, how can he go back?\n\nIn eastern Liao a girl was waiting, a girl of fifteen years,\n\nDeft with a guitar, expert in dance and song.\n\n…She seems to be fluting, even now, a reed-song of home,\n\nFilling every soldier’s eyes with homesick tears.\n\nLi Qi\n\nA FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND CHEN ZHANGFU\n\nIn the Fourth-month the south wind blows plains of yellow barley,\n\nDate-flowers have not faded yet and lakka-leaves are long.\n\nThe green peak that we left at dawn we still can see at evening,\n\nWhile our horses whinny on the road, eager to turn homeward.\n\n…Chen, my friend, you have always been a great and good man,\n\nWith your dragon’s moustache, tiger’s eyebrows and your massive forehead.\n\nIn your bosom you have shelved away ten thousand volumes.\n\nYou have held your head high, never bowed it in the dust.\n\n…After buying us wine and pledging us, here at the eastern gate,\n\nAnd taking things as lightly as a wildgoose feather,\n\nFlat you lie, tipsy, forgetting the white sun;\n\nBut now and then you open your eyes and gaze at a high lone cloud.\n\n…The tide-head of the lone river joins the darkening sky.\n\nThe ferryman beaches his boat. It has grown too late to sail.\n\nAnd people on their way from Cheng cannot go home,\n\nAnd people from Loyang sigh with disappointment.\n\n…I have heard about the many friends around your wood land dwelling.\n\nYesterday you were dismissed. Are they your friends today?\n\nLi Qi\n\nA LUTE SONG\n\nOur host, providing abundant wine to make the night mellow,\n\nAsks his guest from Yangzhou to play for us on the lute.\n\nToward the moon that whitens the city-wall, black crows are flying,\n\nFrost is on ten thousand trees, and the wind blows through our clothes;\n\nBut a copper stove has added its light to that of flowery candles,\n\nAnd the lute plays The Green Water, and then The Queen of Chu.\n\nOnce it has begun to play, there is no other sound:\n\nA spell is on the banquet, while the stars grow thin….\n\nBut three hundred miles from here, in Huai, official duties await him,\n\nAnd so it’s farewell, and the road again, under cloudy mountains.\n\nLi Qi\n\nON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET\n\nA POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG\n\nWhen this melody for the flageolet was made by Lady Cai,\n\nWhen long ago one by one she sang its eighteen stanzas,\n\nEven the Tartars were shedding tears into the border grasses,\n\nAnd the envoy of China was heart-broken, turning back home with his escort.\n\n…Cold fires now of old battles are grey on ancient forts,\n\nAnd the wilderness is shadowed with white new-flying snow.\n\n…When the player first brushes the Shang string and the Jue and then the Yu,\n\nAutumn-leaves in all four quarters are shaken with a murmur.\n\nDong, the master,\n\nMust have been taught in heaven.\n\nDemons come from the deep pine-wood and stealthily listen\n\nTo music slow, then quick, following his hand,\n\nNow far away, now near again, according to his heart.\n\nA hundred birds from an empty mountain scatter and return;\n\nThree thousand miles of floating clouds darken and lighten;\n\nA wildgoose fledgling, left behind, cries for its flock,\n\nAnd a Tartar child for the mother he loves.\n\nThen river waves are calmed\n\nAnd birds are mute that were singing,\n\nAnd Wuzu tribes are homesick for their distant land,\n\nAnd out of the dust of Siberian steppes rises a plaintive sorrow.\n\n…Suddenly the low sound leaps to a freer tune,\n\nLike a long wind swaying a forest, a downpour breaking tiles,\n\nA cascade through the air, flying over tree-tops.\n\n…A wild deer calls to his fellows.

Either could face ten thousand.\n\nThey make the white silk stretch away into a vast desert.\n\nAnd the seven others with them are almost as noble\n\nMist and snow are moving across a cold sky,\n\nAnd hoofs are cleaving snow-drifts under great trees-\n\nWith here a group of officers and there a group of servants.\n\nSee how these nine horses all vie with one another-\n\nThe high clear glance, the deep firm breath.\n\n…Who understands distinction? Who really cares for art?\n\nYou, Wei Feng, have followed Cao; Zhidun preceded him.\n\n…I remember when the late Emperor came toward his Summer Palace,\n\nThe procession, in green-feathered rows, swept from the eastern sky —\n\nThirty thousand horses, prancing, galloping,\n\nFashioned, every one of them, like the horses in this picture….\n\nBut now the Imperial Ghost receives secret jade from the River God,\n\nFor the Emperor hunts crocodiles no longer by the streams.\n\nWhere you see his Great Gold Tomb, you may hear among the pines\n\nA bird grieving in the wind that the Emperor’s horses are gone.\n\nDu Fu\n\nA SONG OF A PAINTING TO GENERAL CAO\n\nO General, descended from Wei’s Emperor Wu,\n\nYou are nobler now than when a noble….\n\nConquerors and their velour perish,\n\nBut masters of beauty live forever.\n\n…With your brush-work learned from Lady Wei\n\nAnd second only to Wang Xizhi’s,\n\nFaithful to your art, you know no age,\n\nLetting wealth and fame drift by like clouds.\n\n…In the years of Kaiyuan you were much with the Emperor,\n\nAccompanied him often to the Court of the South Wind.\n\nWhen the spirit left great statesmen, on walls of the Hall of Fame\n\nThe point of your brush preserved their living faces.\n\nYou crowned all the premiers with coronets of office;\n\nYou fitted all commanders with arrows at their girdles;\n\nYou made the founders of this dynasty, with every hair alive,\n\nSeem to be just back from the fierceness of a battle.\n\n…The late Emperor had a horse, known as Jade Flower,\n\nWhom artists had copied in various poses.\n\nThey led him one day to the red marble stairs\n\nWith his eyes toward the palace in the deepening air.\n\nThen, General, commanded to proceed with your work,\n\nYou centred all your being on a piece of silk.\n\nAnd later, when your dragon-horse, born of the sky,\n\nHad banished earthly horses for ten thousand generations,\n\nThere was one Jade Flower standing on the dais\n\nAnd another by the steps, and they marvelled at each other….\n\nThe Emperor rewarded you with smiles and with gifts,\n\nWhile officers and men of the stud hung about and stared.\n\n…Han Gan, your follower, has likewise grown proficient\n\nAt representing horses in all their attitudes;\n\nBut picturing the flesh, he fails to draw the bone-\n\nSo that even the finest are deprived of their spirit.\n\nYou, beyond the mere skill, used your art divinely-\n\nAnd expressed, not only horses, but the life of a good man….\n\nYet here you are, wandering in a world of disorder\n\nAnd sketching from time to time some petty passerby\n\nPeople note your case with the whites of their eyes.\n\nThere’s nobody purer, there’s nobody poorer.\n\n…Read in the records, from earliest times,\n\nHow hard it is to be a great artist.\n\nLiu Zongyuan\n\nAN OLD FISHERMAN\n\nAn old fisherman spent the night here, under the western cliff;\n\nHe dipped up water from the pure Hsiang and made a bamboo fire;\n\nAnd then, at sunrise, he went his way through the cloven mist,\n\nWith only the creak of his paddle left, in the greenness of mountain and river.\n\n…I turn and see the waves moving as from heaven,\n\nAnd clouds above the cliffs coming idly, one by one.\n\nBai Juyi\n\nA SONG OF UNENDING SORROW\n\nChina’s Emperor, craving beauty that might shake an empire,\n\nWas on the throne for many years, searching, never finding,\n\nTill a little child of the Yang clan, hardly even grown,\n\nBred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her,\n\nBut with graces granted by heaven and not to be concealed,\n\nAt last one day was chosen for the imperial household.\n\nIf she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast a hundred spells,\n\nAnd the powder and paint of the Six Palaces faded into nothing.\n\n…It was early spring. They bathed her in the FlowerPure Pool,\n\nWhich warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin,\n\nAnd, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her\n\nWhen first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride.\n\nThe cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved,\n\nWere sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains;\n\nBut nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon,\n\nAnd the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings\n\nAnd lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry,\n\nHis mistress of the spring, his despot of the night.\n\nThere were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty,\n\nBut his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body.\n\nBy the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it would be almost evening;\n\nAnd when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she would loiter, slow with wine.\n\nHer sisters and her brothers all were given titles;\n\nAnd, because she so illumined and glorified her clan,\n\nShe brought to every father, every mother through the empire,\n\nHappiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.\n\n…High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,\n\nAnd far and wide the breezes carried magical notes\n\nOf soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.\n\nThe Emperor’s eyes could never gaze on her enough-\n\nTill war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole earth\n\nAnd broke the tunes of The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.\n\nThe Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust\n\nFrom thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest.\n\nThe imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing- –\n\nBut thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate,\n\nThe men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir\n\nTill under their horses’ hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows….\n\nFlowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up,\n\nAnd a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird.\n\nThe Emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face.\n\nAnd later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears\n\nWas hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.\n\n… At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line\n\nUnder Omei Mountain. The last few came.\n\nFlags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight….\n\nBut as waters of Shu are always green and its mountains always blue,\n\nSo changeless was His Majesty’s love and deeper than the days.\n\nHe stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace.\n\nHe heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast.\n\nAnd when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home,\n\nThe Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away\n\nFrom the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was buried\n\nThat memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white face?\n\nRuler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats\n\nAs they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital.\n\n…The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before,\n\nThe Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace willows;\n\nBut a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow —\n\nAnd what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them?\n\n…Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring;\n\nWutong-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains;\n\nThe Western and Southern Palaces were littered with late grasses,\n\nAnd the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away.\n\nHer Pear-Garden Players became white-haired\n\nAnd the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;\n\nOver the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight.\n\nHe would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep.\n\nBell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours\n\nAnd the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn,\n\nAnd the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost\n\nAnd his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder\n\nWith the distance between life and death year after year;\n\nAnd yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.\n\n…At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest of heaven,\n\nAble to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.\n\nAnd people were so moved by the Emperor’s constant brooding\n\nThat they besought the Taoist priest to see if he could find her.\n\nHe opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning,\n\nUp to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.\n\nAbove, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow Spring;\n\nBut he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for.\n\nAnd then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea,\n\nA part of the intangible and incorporeal world,\n\nWith pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,\n\nAnd of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,\n\nAnd of one among them-whom they called The Ever True-\n\nWith a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought.\n\nSo he went to the West Hall’s gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door\n\nAnd asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The Doubly- Perfect.\n\nAnd the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of China,\n\nWas startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy.\n\nShe pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep,\n\nAnd opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen.\n\nHer cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste,\n\nAnd her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace,\n\nWhile a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with her motion\n\nAs though she danced The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.\n\nAnd the tear-drops drifting down her sad white face\n\nWere like a rain in spring on the blossom of the pear.\n\nBut love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him thank her liege,\n\nWhose form and voice had been strange to her ever since their parting —\n\nSince happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright Sun,\n\nAnd moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain Palace.\n\nBut when she turned her face and looked down toward the earth\n\nAnd tried to see the capital, there were only fog and dust.\n\nSo she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had given\n\nAnd, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and gold hairpin,\n\nBut kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the box,\n\nBreaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell of the box;\n\n“Our souls belong together,” she said, ” like this gold and this shell —\n\nSomewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall surely\n\nAnd she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence reminding him\n\nOf vows which had been known only to their two hearts:\n\n“On the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the Palace of Long Life,\n\nWe told each other secretly in the quiet midnight world\n\nThat we wished to fly in heaven, two birds with the wings of one,\n\nAnd to grow together on the earth, two branches of one tree.”\n\nEarth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall end,\n\nWhile this unending sorrow goes on and on for ever.\n\nBai Chuyi\n\nTHE SONG OF A GUITAR\n\nIn the tenth year of Yuanhe I was banished and demoted to be assistant official in Jiujiang. In the summer of the next year I was seeing a friend leave Penpu and heard in the midnight from a neighbouring boat a guitar played in the manner of the capital. Upon inquiry, I found that the player had formerly been a dancing-girl there and in her maturity had been married to a merchant. I invited her to my boat to have her play for us. She told me her story, heyday and then unhappiness. Since my departure from the capital I had not felt sad; but that night, after I left her, I began to realize my banishment. And I wrote this long poem — six hundred and twelve characters.\n\nI was bidding a guest farewell, at night on the Xunyang River,\n\nWhere maple-leaves and full-grown rushes rustled in the autumn.\n\nI, the host, had dismounted, my guest had boarded his boat,\n\nAnd we raised our cups and wished to drink-but, alas, there was no music.\n\nFor all we had drunk we felt no joy and were parting from each other,\n\nWhen the river widened mysteriously toward the full moon —\n\nWe had heard a sudden sound, a guitar across the water.\n\nHost forgot to turn back home, and guest to go his way.\n\nWe followed where the melody led and asked the player’s name.\n\nThe sound broke off…then reluctantly she answered.\n\nWe moved our boat near hers, invited her to join us,\n\nSummoned more wine and lanterns to recommence our banquet.\n\nYet we called and urged a thousand times before she started toward us,\n\nStill hiding half her face from us behind her guitar.\n\n…She turned the tuning-pegs and tested several strings;\n\nWe could feel what she was feeling, even before she played:\n\nEach string a meditation, each note a deep thought,\n\nAs if she were telling us the ache of her whole life.\n\nShe knit her brows, flexed her fingers, then began her music,\n\nLittle by little letting her heart share everything with ours.\n\nShe brushed the strings, twisted them slow, swept them, plucked them —\n\nFirst the air of The Rainbow Skirt, then The Six Little Ones.\n\nThe large strings hummed like rain,\n\nThe small strings whispered like a secret,\n\nHummed, whispered-and then were intermingled\n\nLike a pouring of large and small pearls into a plate of jade.\n\nWe heard an oriole, liquid, hidden among flowers.\n\nWe heard a brook bitterly sob along a bank of sand…\n\nBy the checking of its cold touch, the very string seemed broken\n\nAs though it could not pass; and the notes, dying away\n\nInto a depth of sorrow and concealment of lament,\n\nTold even more in silence than they had told in sound….\n\nA silver vase abruptly broke with a gush of water,\n\nAnd out leapt armored horses and weapons that clashed and smote —\n\nAnd, before she laid her pick down, she ended with one stroke,\n\nAnd all four strings made one sound, as of rending silk\n\nThere was quiet in the east boat and quiet in the west,\n\nAnd we saw the white autumnal moon enter the river’s heart.\n\n…When she had slowly placed the pick back among the strings,\n\nShe rose and smoothed her clothing and, formal, courteous,\n\nTold us how she had spent her girlhood at the capital,\n\nLiving in her parents’ house under the Mount of Toads,\n\nAnd had mastered the guitar at the age of thirteen,\n\nWith her name recorded first in the class-roll of musicians,\n\nHer art the admiration even of experts,\n\nHer beauty the envy of all the leading dancers,\n\nHow noble youths of Wuling had lavishly competed\n\nAnd numberless red rolls of silk been given for one song,\n\nAnd silver combs with shell inlay been snapped by her rhythms,\n\nAnd skirts the colour of blood been spoiled with stains of wine….\n\nSeason after season, joy had followed joy,\n\nAutumn moons and spring winds had passed without her heeding,\n\nTill first her brother left for the war, and then her aunt died,\n\nAnd evenings went and evenings came, and her beauty faded —\n\nWith ever fewer chariots and horses at her door;\n\nSo that finally she gave herself as wife to a merchant\n\nWho, prizing money first, careless how he left her,\n\nHad gone, a month before, to Fuliang to buy tea.\n\nAnd she had been tending an empty boat at the river’s mouth,\n\nNo company but the bright moon and the cold water.\n\nAnd sometimes in the deep of night she would dream of her triumphs\n\nAnd be wakened from her dreams by the scalding of her tears.\n\nHer very first guitar-note had started me sighing;\n\nNow, having heard her story, I was sadder still.\n\n“We are both unhappy — to the sky’s end.\n\nWe meet. We understand. What does acquaintance matter?\n\nI came, a year ago, away from the capital\n\nAnd am now a sick exile here in Jiujiang —\n\nAnd so remote is Jiujiang that I have heard no music,\n\nNeither string nor bamboo, for a whole year.\n\nMy quarters, near the River Town, are low and damp,\n\nWith bitter reeds and yellowed rushes all about the house.\n\nAnd what is to be heard here, morning and evening? —\n\nThe bleeding cry of cuckoos, the whimpering of apes.\n\nOn flowery spring mornings and moonlit autumn nights\n\nI have often taken wine up and drunk it all alone,\n\nOf course there are the mountain songs and the village pipes,\n\nBut they are crude and-strident, and grate on my ears.\n\nAnd tonight, when I heard you playing your guitar,\n\nI felt as if my hearing were bright with fairymusic.\n\nDo not leave us. Come, sit down. Play for us again.\n\nAnd I will write a long song concerning a guitar.”\n\n…Moved by what I said, she stood there for a moment,\n\nThen sat again to her strings-and they sounded even sadder,\n\nAlthough the tunes were different from those she had played before….\n\nThe feasters, all listening, covered their faces.\n\nBut who of them all was crying the most?\n\nThis Jiujiang official. My blue sleeve was wet.\n\nLi Shangyin\n\nTHE HAN MONUMENT\n\nThe Son of Heaven in Yuanhe times was martial as a god\n\nAnd might be likened only to the Emperors Xuan and Xi.\n\nHe took an oath to reassert the glory of the empire,\n\nAnd tribute was brought to his palace from all four quarters.\n\nWestern Huai for fifty years had been a bandit country,\n\nWolves becoming lynxes, lynxes becoming bears.\n\nThey assailed the mountains and rivers, rising from the plains,\n\nWith their long spears and sharp lances aimed at the Sun.\n\nBut the Emperor had a wise premier, by the name of Du,\n\nWho, guarded by spirits against assassination,\n\nHong at his girdle the seal of state, and accepted chief command,\n\nWhile these savage winds were harrying the flags of the Ruler of Heaven.\n\nGenerals Suo, Wu, Gu, and Tong became his paws and claws;\n\nCivil and military experts brought their writingbrushes,\n\nAnd his recording adviser was wise and resolute.\n\nA hundred and forty thousand soldiers, fighting like lions and tigers,\n\nCaptured the bandit chieftains for the Imperial Temple.\n\nSo complete a victory was a supreme event;\n\nAnd the Emperor said: “To you, Du, should go the highest honour,\n\nAnd your secretary, Yu, should write a record of it.”\n\nWhen Yu had bowed his head, he leapt and danced, saying:\n\n“Historical writings on stone and metal are my especial art;\n\nAnd, since I know the finest brush-work of the old masters,\n\nMy duty in this instance is more than merely official,\n\nAnd I should be at fault if I modestly declined.”\n\nThe Emperor, on hearing this, nodded many times.\n\nAnd Yu retired and fasted and, in a narrow workroom,\n\nHis great brush thick with ink as with drops of rain,\n\nChose characters like those in the Canons of Yao and Xun,\n\nAnd a style as in the ancient poems Qingmiao and Shengmin.\n\nAnd soon the description was ready, on a sheet of paper.\n\nIn the morning he laid it, with a bow, on the purple stairs.\n\nHe memorialized the throne: “I, unworthy,\n\nHave dared to record this exploit, for a monument.”\n\nThe tablet was thirty feet high, the characters large as dippers;\n\nIt was set on a sacred tortoise, its columns flanked with ragons….\n\nThe phrases were strange with deep words that few could understand;\n\nAnd jealousy entered and malice and reached the Emperor —\n\nSo that a rope a hundred feet long pulled the tablet down\n\nAnd coarse sand and small stones ground away its face.\n\nBut literature endures, like the universal spirit,\n\nAnd its breath becomes a part of the vitals of all men.\n\nThe Tang plate, the Confucian tripod, are eternal things,\n\nNot because of their forms, but because of their inscriptions….\n\nSagacious is our sovereign and wise his minister,\n\nAnd high their successes and prosperous their reign;\n\nBut unless it be recorded by a writing such as this,\n\nHow may they hope to rival the three and five good rulers?\n\nI wish I could write ten thousand copies to read ten thousand times,\n\nTill spittle ran from my lips and calluses hardened my fingers,\n\nAnd still could hand them down, through seventy-two generations,\n\nAs corner-stones for Rooms of Great Deeds on the Sacred Mountains.\n\nGao Shi\n\nA SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY\n\nIn the sixth year of Kaiyuan, a friend returned from the border and showed me the Yan Song. Moved by what he told me of the expedition, I have written this poem to the same rhymes.\n\nThe northeastern border of China was dark with smoke and dust.\n\nTo repel the savage invaders, our generals, leaving their families,\n\nStrode forth together, looking as heroes should look;\n\nAnd having received from the Emperor his most gracious favour,\n\nThey marched to the beat of gong and drum through the Elm Pass.\n\nThey circled the Stone Tablet with a line of waving flags,\n\nTill their captains over the Sea of Sand were twanging feathered orders.\n\nThe Tartar chieftain’s hunting-fires glimmered along Wolf Mountain,\n\nAnd heights and rivers were cold and bleak there at the outer border;\n\nBut soon the barbarians’ horses were plunging through wind and rain.\n\nHalf of our men at the front were killed, but the other half are living,\n\nAnd still at the camp beautiful girls dance for them and sing.\n\n…As autumn ends in the grey sand, with the grasses all withered,\n\nThe few surviving watchers by the lonely wall at sunset,\n\nServing in a good cause, hold life and the foeman lightly.\n\nAnd yet, for all that they have done, Elm Pass is still unsafe.\n\nStill at the front, iron armour is worn and battered thin,\n\nAnd here at home food-sticks are made of jade tears.\n\nStill in this southern city young wives’ hearts are breaking,\n\nWhile soldiers at the northern border vainly look toward home.\n\nThe fury of the wind cuts our men’s advance\n\nIn a place of death and blue void, with nothingness ahead.\n\nThree times a day a cloud of slaughter rises over the camp;\n\nAnd all night long the hour-drums shake their chilly booming,\n\nUntil white swords can be seen again, spattered with red blood.\n\n…When death becomes a duty, who stops to think of fame?\n\nYet in speaking of the rigours of warfare on the desert\n\nWe name to this day Li, the great General, who lived long ago.\n\nLi Qi\n\nAN OLD WAR-SONG\n\nThrough the bright day up the mountain, we scan the sky for a war-torch;\n\nAt yellow dusk we water our horses in the boundaryriver;\n\nAnd when the throb of watch-drums hangs in the sandy wind,\n\nWe hear the guitar of the Chinese Princess telling her endless woe….\n\nThree thousand miles without a town, nothing but camps,\n\nTill the heavy sky joins the wide desert in snow.\n\nWith their plaintive calls, barbarian wildgeese fly from night to night,\n\nAnd children of the Tartars have many tears to shed;\n\nBut we hear that the Jade Pass is still under siege,\n\nAnd soon we stake our lives upon our light warchariots.\n\nEach year we bury in the desert bones unnumbered,\n\nYet we only watch for grape-vines coming into China.\n\nWang Wei\n\nA SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG\n\nThere’s a girl from Loyang in the door across the street,\n\nShe looks fifteen, she may be a little older.\n\n…While her master rides his rapid horse with jade bit an bridle,\n\nHer handmaid brings her cod-fish in a golden plate.\n\nOn her painted pavilions, facing red towers,\n\nCornices are pink and green with peach-bloom and with willow,\n\nCanopies of silk awn her seven-scented chair,\n\nAnd rare fans shade her, home to her nine-flowered curtains.\n\nHer lord, with rank and wealth and in the bud of life,\n\nExceeds in munificence the richest men of old.\n\nHe favours this girl of lowly birth, he has her taught to dance;\n\nAnd he gives away his coral-trees to almost anyone.\n\nThe wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights go out,\n\nThose nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain of flowers.\n\nBetween dances she has barely time for singing over the songs;\n\nNo sooner is she dressed again than incense burns before her.\n\nThose she knows in town are only the rich and the lavish,\n\nAnd day and night she is visiting the hosts of the gayest mansions.\n\n…Who notices the girl from Yue with a face of white jade,\n\nHumble, poor, alone, by the river, washing silk?\n\nWang Wei\n\nSONG OF AN OLD GENERAL\n\nWhen he was a youth of fifteen or twenty,\n\nHe chased a wild horse, he caught him and rode him,\n\nHe shot the white-browed mountain tiger,\n\nHe defied the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye.\n\nFighting single- handed for a thousand miles,\n\nWith his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.\n\n…Granted that the troops of China were as swift as heaven’s thunder\n\nAnd that Tartar soldiers perished in pitfalls fanged with iron,\n\nGeneral Wei Qing’s victory was only a thing of chance.\n\nAnd General Li Guang’s thwarted effort was his fate, not his fault.\n\nSince this man’s retirement he is looking old and worn:\n\nExperience of the world has hastened his white hairs.\n\nThough once his quick dart never missed the right eye of a bird,\n\nNow knotted veins and tendons make his left arm like an osier.\n\nHe is sometimes at the road-side selling melons from his garden,\n\nHe is sometimes planting willows round his hermitage.\n\nHis lonely lane is shut away by a dense grove,\n\nHis vacant window looks upon the far cold mountains\n\nBut, if he prayed, the waters would come gushing for his men\n\nAnd never would he wanton his cause away with wine.\n\n…War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan Range;\n\nBack and forth, day and night, go feathered messages;\n\nIn the three River Provinces, the governors call young men —\n\nAnd five imperial edicts have summoned the old general.\n\nSo he dusts his iron coat and shines it like snow-\n\nWaves his dagger from its jade hilt in a dance of starry steel.\n\nHe is ready with his strong northern bow to smite the Tartar chieftain —\n\nThat never a foreign war-dress may affront the Emperor.\n\n…There once was an aged Prefect, forgotten and far away,\n\nWho still could manage triumph with a single stroke.\n\nWang Wei\n\nA SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER\n\nA fisherman is drifting, enjoying the spring mountains,\n\nAnd the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an ancient source.\n\nWatching the fresh-coloured trees, he never thinks of distance\n\nTill he comes to the end of the blue stream and suddenly- strange men!\n\nIt’s a cave-with a mouth so narrow that he has to crawl through;\n\nBut then it opens wide again on a broad and level path —\n\nAnd far beyond he faces clouds crowning a reach of trees,\n\nAnd thousands of houses shadowed round with flowers and bamboos….\n\nWoodsmen tell him their names in the ancient speech of Han;\n\nAnd clothes of the Qin Dynasty are worn by all these people\n\nLiving on the uplands, above the Wuling River,\n\nOn farms and in gardens that are like a world apart,\n\nTheir dwellings at peace under pines in the clear moon,\n\nUntil sunrise fills the low sky with crowing and barking.\n\n…At news of a stranger the people all assemble,\n\nAnd each of them invites him home and asks him where he was born.\n\nAlleys and paths are cleared for him of petals in the morning,\n\nAnd fishermen and farmers bring him their loads at dusk….\n\nThey had left the world long ago, they had come here seeking refuge;\n\nThey have lived like angels ever since, blessedly far away,\n\nNo one in the cave knowing anything outside,\n\nOutsiders viewing only empty mountains and thick clouds.\n\n…The fisherman, unaware of his great good fortune,\n\nBegins to think of country, of home, of worldly ties,\n\nFinds his way out of the cave again, past mountains and past rivers,\n\nIntending some time to return, when he has told his kin.\n\nHe studies every step he takes, fixes it well in mind,\n\nAnd forgets that cliffs and peaks may vary their appearance.\n\n…It is certain that to enter through the deepness of the mountain,\n\nA green river leads you, into a misty wood.\n\nBut now, with spring-floods everywhere and floating peachpetals —\n\nWhich is the way to go, to find that hidden source?\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nA MESSAGE FROM LAKE DONGTIN\n\nTO PREMIER ZHANG\n\nHere in the Eighth-month the waters of the lake\n\nAre of a single air with heaven,\n\nAnd a mist from the Yun and Meng valleys\n\nHas beleaguered the city of Youzhou.\n\nI should like to cross, but I can find no boat.\n\n…How ashamed I am to be idler than you statesmen,\n\nAs I sit here and watch a fisherman casting\n\nAnd emptily envy him his catch.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nON CLIMBING YAN MOUNTAIN WITH FRIENDS\n\nWhile worldly matters take their turn,\n\nAncient, modern, to and fro,\n\nRivers and mountains are changeless in their glory\n\nAnd still to be witnessed from this trail.\n\nWhere a fisher-boat dips by a waterfall,\n\nWhere the air grows colder, deep in the valley,\n\nThe monument of Yang remains;\n\nAnd we have wept, reading the words.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nAT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE\n\nOF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI\n\nIn my bed among the woods, grieving that spring must end,\n\nI lifted up the curtain on a pathway of flowers,\n\nAnd a flashing bluebird bade me come\n\nTo the dwelling-place of the Red Pine Genie.\n\n…What a flame for his golden crucible —\n\nPeach-trees magical with buds ! —\n\nAnd for holding boyhood in his face,\n\nThe rosy-flowing wine of clouds!\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nON RETURNING AT THE YEAR’S END TO\n\nZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN\n\nI petition no more at the north palace-gate.\n\n…To this tumble-down hut on Zhongnan Mountain\n\nI was banished for my blunders, by a wise ruler.\n\nI have been sick so long I see none of my friends.\n\nMy white hairs hasten my decline,\n\nLike pale beams ending the old year.\n\nTherefore I lie awake and ponder\n\nOn the pine-shadowed moonlight in my empty window.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nSTOPPING AT A FRIEND’S FARM-HOUSE\n\nPreparing me chicken and rice, old friend,\n\nYou entertain me at your farm.\n\nWe watch the green trees that circle your village\n\nAnd the pale blue of outlying mountains.\n\nWe open your window over garden and field,\n\nTo talk mulberry and hemp with our cups in our hands.\n\n…Wait till the Mountain Holiday —\n\nI am coming again in chrysanthemum time.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nFROM QIN COUNTRY TO THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YUAN\n\nHow gladly I would seek a mountain\n\nIf I had enough means to live as a recluse!\n\nFor I turn at last from serving the State\n\nTo the Eastern Woods Temple and to you, my master.\n\n…Like ashes of gold in a cinnamon-flame,\n\nMy youthful desires have been burnt with the years-\n\nAnd tonight in the chilling sunset-wind\n\nA cicada, singing, weighs on my heart.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nFROM A MOORING ON THE TONGLU\n\nTO A FRIEND IN YANGZHOU\n\nWith monkeys whimpering on the shadowy mountain,\n\nAnd the river rushing through the night,\n\nAnd a wind in the leaves along both banks,\n\nAnd the moon athwart my solitary sail,\n\nI, a stranger in this inland district,\n\nHomesick for my Yangzhou friends,\n\nSend eastward two long streams of tears\n\nTo find the nearest touch of the sea.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nTAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI\n\nSlow and reluctant, I have waited\n\nDay after day, till now I must go.\n\nHow sweet the road-side flowers might be\n\nIf they did not mean good-bye, old friend.\n\nThe Lords of the Realm are harsh to us\n\nAnd men of affairs are not our kind.\n\nI will turn back home, I will say no more,\n\nI will close the gate of my old garden.\n\nMeng Haoran\n\nMEMORIES IN EARLY WINTER\n\nSouth go the wildgesse, for leaves are now falling,\n\nAnd the water is cold with a wind from the north.\n\nI remember my home; but the Xiang River’s curves\n\nAre walled by the clouds of this southern country.\n\nI go forward. I weep till my tears are spent.\n\nI see a sail in the far sky.\n\nWhere is the ferry? Will somebody tell me?\n\nIt’s growing rough. It’s growing dark.\n\nLiu Changqing\n\nCLIMBING IN AUTUMN FOR A VIEW FROM THE TEMPLE\n\nON THE TERRACE OF GENERAL WU\n\nSo autumn breaks my homesick heart….\n\nFew pilgrims venture climbing to a temple so wild,\n\nUp from the lake, in the mountain clouds.\n\n…Sunset clings in the old defences,\n\nA stone gong shivers through the empty woods.\n\n…Of the Southern Dynasty, what remains?\n\nNothing but the great River.\n\nLi Shangyin\n\nTO THE MOON GODDESS\n\nNow that a candle-shadow stands on the screen of carven marble\n\nAnd the River of Heaven slants and the morning stars are low,\n\nAre you sorry for having stolen the potion that has set you\n\nOver purple seas and blue skies, to brood through the long nights?\n\nLi Shangyin\n\nJIASHENG\n\nWhen the Emperor sought guidance from wise men, from exiles,\n\nHe found no calmer wisdom than that of young Jia\n\nAnd assigned him the foremost council-seat at midnight,\n\nYet asked him about gods, instead of about people.\n\nWen Tingyun\n\nSHE SIGHS ON HER JADE LUTE\n\nA cool-matted silvery bed; but no dreams….\n\nAn evening sky as green as water, shadowed with tender clouds;\n\nBut far off over the southern rivers the calling of a wildgoose,\n\nAnd here a twelve-story building, lonely under the moon.\n\nZheng Tian\n\nON MAWEI SLOPE\n\nWhen the Emperor came back from his ride they had murdered Lady Yang —\n\nThat passion unforgettable through all the suns and moons\n\nThey had led him to forsake her by reminding him\n\nOf an emperor slain with his lady once, in a well at Jingyang Palace.\n\nHan Wu\n\nCOOLER WEATHER\n\nHer jade-green alcove curtained thick with silk,\n\nHer vermilion screen with its pattern of flowers,\n\nHer eight- foot dragon-beard mat and her quilt brocaded in squares\n\nAre ready now for nights that are neither warm nor cold.\n\nSeven-character-quatrain\n\nWei Zhuang\n\nA NANJING LANDSCAPE\n\nThough a shower bends the river-grass, a bird is singing,\n\nWhile ghosts of the Six Dynasties pass like a dream\n\nAround the Forbidden City, under weeping willows\n\nWhich loom still for three miles along the misty moat.\n\nChen Tao\n\nTURKESTAN\n\nThinking only of their vow that they would crush the Tartars- –\n\nOn the desert, clad in sable and silk, five thousand of them fell….\n\nBut arisen from their crumbling bones on the banks of the river at the border,\n\nDreams of them enter, like men alive, into rooms where their loves lie sleeping.\n\nZhang Bi\n\nA MESSAGE\n\nI go in a dream to the house of Xie\n\nThrough a zigzag porch with arching rails\n\nTo a court where the spring moon lights for ever\n\nPhantom flowers and a single figure.\n\nWumingshi\n\nTHE DAY OF NO FIRE\n\nAs the holiday approaches, and grasses are bright after rain,\n\nAnd the causeway gleams with willows, and wheatfields wave in the wind,\n\nWe are thinking of our kinsfolk, far away from us.\n\nO cuckoo, why do you follow us, why do you call us home?\n\nWang Wei\n\nA SONG AT WEICHENG\n\nA morning-rain has settled the dust in Weicheng;\n\nWillows are green again in the tavern dooryard….\n\nWait till we empty one more cup —\n\nWest of Yang Gate there’ll be no old friends.\n\nWang Wei\n\nA SONG OF AN AUTUMN NIGHT\n\nUnder the crescent moon a light autumn dew\n\nHas chilled the robe she will not change —\n\nAnd she touches a silver lute all night,\n\nAfraid to go back to her empty room.\n\nWang Changling\n\nA SIGH IN THE COURT OF PERPETUAL FAITH\n\nShe brings a broom at dawn to the Golden Palace doorway\n\nAnd dusts the hall from end to end with her round fan,\n\nAnd, for all her jade-whiteness, she envies a crow\n\nWhose cold wings are kindled in the Court of the Bright Sun.\n\nWang Changling\n\nOVER THE BORDER\n\nThe moon goes back to the time of Qin, the wall to the time of Han,\n\nAnd the road our troops are travelling goes back three hundred miles….\n\nOh, for the Winged General at the Dragon City —\n\nThat never a Tartar horseman might cross the Yin Mountains!\n\nWang Zhihuan\n\nBEYOND THE BORDER\n\nWhere a yellow river climbs to the white clouds,\n\nNear the one city-wall among ten-thousand-foot mountains,\n\nA Tartar under the willows is lamenting on his flute\n\nThat spring never blows to him through the Jade Pass\n\nLi Bai\n\nA SONG OF PURE HAPPINESS I\n\nHer robe is a cloud, her face a flower;\n\nHer balcony, glimmering with the bright spring dew,\n\nIs either the tip of earth’s Jade Mountain\n\nOr a moon- edged roof of paradise.\n\nLi Bai\n\nA SONG OF PURE HAPPINESS II\n\nThere’s a perfume stealing moist from a shaft of red blossom,\n\nAnd a mist, through the heart, from the magical Hill of Wu- –\n\nThe palaces of China have never known such beauty-\n\nNot even Flying Swallow with all her glittering garments.\n\nLi Bai\n\nA SONG OF PURE HAPPINESS III\n\nLovely now together, his lady and his flowers\n\nLighten for ever the Emperor’s eye,\n\nAs he listens to the sighing of the far spring wind\n\nWhere she leans on a railing in the Aloe Pavilion.\n\nDu Qiuniang\n\nTHE GOLD-THREADED ROBE\n\nCovet not a gold-threaded robe,\n\nCherish only your young days!\n\nIf a bud open, gather it —\n\nLest you but wait for an empty bough.\n\nLi Shangyin\n\nTO ONE UNNAMED V\n\nThere are many curtains in your care-free house,\n\nWhere rapture lasts the whole night long.\n\n…What are the lives of angels but dreams\n\nIf they take no lovers into their rooms?\n\n…Storms are ravishing the nut-horns,\n\nMoon- dew sweetening cinnamon-leaves\n\nI know well enough naught can come of this union,\n\nYet how it serves to ease my heart!\n\nWen Tingyun\n\nNEAR THE LIZHOU FERRY\n\nThe sun has set in the water’s clear void,\n\nAnd little blue islands are one with the sky.\n\nOn the bank a horse neighs.

Far down the river now,\n\nI find you alone under falling petals.\n\nWei Yingwu\n\nAT CHUZHOU ON THE WESTERN STREAM\n\nWhere tender grasses rim the stream\n\nAnd deep boughs trill with mango-birds,\n\nOn the spring flood of last night’s rain\n\nThe ferry-boat moves as though someone were poling.\n\nZhang Ji\n\nA NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE\n\nWhile I watch the moon go down, a crow caws through the frost;\n\nUnder the shadows of maple-trees a fisherman moves with his torch;\n\nAnd I hear, from beyond Suzhou, from the temple on Cold Mountain,\n\nRinging for me, here in my boat, the midnight bell.\n\nHan Hong\n\nAFTER THE DAY OF NO FIRE\n\nPetals of spring fly all through the city\n\nFrom the wind in the willows of the Imperial River.\n\nAnd at dusk, from the palace, candles are given out\n\nTo light first the mansions of the Five Great Lords.\n\nLiu Fangping\n\nA MOONLIGHT NIGHT\n\nWhen the moon has coloured half the house,\n\nWith the North Star at its height and the South Star setting,\n\nI can fed the first motions of the warm air of spring\n\nIn the singing of an insect at my green-silk window.\n\nLiu Fangping\n\nSPRING HEART-BREAK\n\nWith twilight passing her silken window,\n\nShe weeps alone in her chamber of gold\n\nFor spring is departing from a desolate garden,\n\nAnd a drift of pear-petals is closing a door.\n\nLiu Zhongyong\n\nA TROOPER’S BURDEN\n\nFor years, to guard the Jade Pass and the River of Gold,\n\nWith our hands on our horse-whips and our swordhilts,\n\nWe have watched the green graves change to snow\n\nAnd the Yellow Stream ring the Black Mountain forever.\n\nGu Kuang\n\nA PALACE POEM\n\nHigh above, from a jade chamber, songs float half-way to heaven,\n\nThe palace-girls’ gay voices are mingled with the wind —\n\nBut now they are still, and you hear a water-clock drip in the Court of the Moon….\n\nThey have opened the curtain wide, they are facing the River of Stars.\n\nLi Yi\n\nON HEARING A FLUTE AT NIGHT\n\nFROM THE WALL OF SHOUXIANG\n\nThe sand below the border-mountain lies like snow,\n\nAnd the moon like frost beyond the city-wall,\n\nAnd someone somewhere, playing a flute,\n\nHas made the soldiers homesick all night long.\n\nLiu Yuxi\n\nBLACKTAIL ROW\n\nGrass has run wild now by the Bridge of Red-Birds;\n\nAnd swallows’ wings, at sunset, in Blacktail Row\n\nWhere once they visited great homes,\n\nDip among doorways of the poor.\n\nLiu Yuxi\n\nA SPRING SONG\n\nIn gala robes she comes down from her chamber\n\nInto her courtyard, enclosure of spring….\n\nWhen she tries from the centre to count the flowers,\n\nOn her hairpin of jade a dragon-fly poises.\n\nBai Juyi\n\nA SONG OF THE PALACE\n\nHer tears are spent, but no dreams come.\n\nShe can hear the others singing through the night.\n\nShe has lost his love. Alone with her beauty,\n\nShe leans till dawn on her incense-pillow.\n\nZhang Hu\n\nOF ONE IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY"
