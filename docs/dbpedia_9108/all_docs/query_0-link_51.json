Recent studies, however, have convinced that apart from Indian influence, Champa did benefit greatly from other civilization centers, especially China and the Middle East. This article, relies on Chinese historical document and the old inscriptions of ancient Champa as well as recent archaeological findings in central Vietnam, aims to shed new light on the diplomatic relations and commercial links between Champa with China and Middle East during the period from the 7th to the 10th: Firstly, the tributary trade and diplomacy from Champa to Chinese courts will be taken into account; and secondly, the engagement of Champa in the expansion of Muslim trade network in the Indian Ocean will be investigated.\n\nMaritime Trade Networks in Asia through the Tang Era\n\n2The formation of the Great Tang Empire in 618 CE marked an important milestone not only in the history of China, but also of the Eurasian continent at large. The Tang Empire is recognized as one of the most flourishing dynasties in the thousands of years of Chinese history. The political stability, the cultural bourgeoning and the economic prosperity during the Tang had all made China a massive and desired market with which all the countries in Eurasia wished to establish the diplo-political relations, cultural exchanges and trade, using both maritime and overland routes.\n\n3From the 8th century onward, however, the overland Silk Road was affected by increasing acts of pillage, and massacre of the merchants in the Central Asia. By this time, the rise of Arab merchants who worked to take over the trading networks also contributed to the break in trade between Tang China with the Mediterranean world via the overland Silk Road. This break resulted in both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, the decline of trade via the overland Silk Road weakened the relationship between China and its traditional markets in Central and West Asia as well as in Mediterranean, depleting the fiscal revenues of the Empire, and consequently led to political and economic disorder in China. On the other hand, the stagnation in overland trade activities opened up new prospects for strengthening and increasing trade with potential markets in the south through maritime routes. From a reluctant substitute for the overland Silk Road, the maritime Silk Road gradually became the principal trading route linking the enormous Chinese market with other major markets of Eurasia.\n\n4The rise of Arab world from the 7th century played a significant role in shaping, operating and developing both the overland and maritime trade networks of Eurasia in the following centuries. Before the sixth century, while Indian merchants were regarded as the master of the trade activities between South Asia and Southeast Asia, Arab traders played only a limited role in the operation of regional trade networks in West Indian Ocean. From the sixth century onwards, Arab traders, thanks to innovations in science and technology, especially in marine engineering, gradually broke down the traditional Indian networks, and finally established themselves in the maritime trade activities in the whole regions of vast Indian Ocean and South China Sea. From the 7th century, the Arab vessels started to sail directly further north, cross the South China Sea, to conduct direct exchanges at the coastal ports of Champa and South China, carrying along with them many valuable Western Asia-origin items such as glass, ceramics, and jewelry.\n\n5From the 8th century CE onwards, the role of Arab traders, the stability of the Tang Empire as well as the innovational advancements in terms of navigation all led to major changes in the commercial system of Eurasia in which the maritime trade became increasingly significant to most countries in Asia. Seas and Oceans served as avenues for civilizational diffusion, cultural exchanges and trade activities. The connections between major civilization centers, in spite of the geographical distance, become easier and more frequent. With the increase in the maritime trade activities throughout the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, the coastal polities of Southeast Asia enjoyed new favorable conditions for economic take off, political stability and territorial consolidation.\n\n6Champa, with its long coastline and because of its location in the middle of the safest maritime route connecting China with Southern Sea countries, rapidly engaged with the regional maritime trade networks and took full advantage of the new circumstance to expand its influences over other polities in the region. During the Tang period, Champa was not only the most active mandala in the Southern Sea area sending tributary and diplomatic missions to Tang China, but also emerged as one of the most important centers for Arab traders who, by the time, controlled and operated the maritime trade networks in Asia.\n\nTribute and Trade from Champa to Tang Court\n\n8In the late 680s, trade in the Nanhai re-emerged after a decade of decay due to the growth of corruption in Guangzhou, the central trading port of Tang China as well as Nanhai trade system. Linyi was again the first polity sending a diplomatic mission to the Tang court in 686. In following years, the tribute missions from Linyi, along with those from Srivijaya, continued to visit regularly the Tang Court even during the decay period after the An Lu Shan revolt in 755 (Wang 1998: 75). Champa sent tribute missions in 691, 695, 699, 702, 703, 706, 707, 709, 711, 712, 713 and 731 (Maspero 1928: 93, n. 1) and another mission in 749 (Wang 1998: 84, n. 38, Maspero 1928: 93 n. 3). In these tribute missions, elephants were the most popular tribute objects from Linyi to the Tang court (Maspero 1928).\n\n9The rebellion of An Lushan in 755 caused the fall of the great market-cities of Changan and Luoyang, and as a result, the decline of Nanhai trade as a system. From the middle of the 8th century until the end of the 9th century, Arab and Persian merchants became important middlemen in the trade of maritime Asia. The Muslim merchant in Canton could even revolt and led to the short-term decline of the trade in the region. Consequently, during the period from 758 to 878, there were only few tribute missions from the South sent to the Tang court (Wang 1998: 79, 86 n. 66).\n\n10From 758 onwards, the Chinese historical records stopped using the term “Linyi” to indicate the Cham polity in central Vietnam and started to call it “Huanwang” instead (Maspero 1928: 95). The precise reason behind this change of name of Champa in Chinese records is unknown. Previously, Champa scholars followed Maspero’s study, thus believing that by this time the political center of “Champa” had moved to the south, from Trà Kiệu in Amaravati to Kauthara and Panduranga (ibid.). This view, however, has been questioned by recent scholars who assume that there was in fact no “shift” of capital of Champa during this period since Champa was not a unified state but a confederation of small kingdoms. William Southworth has made an attempt to explain this change from the economic perspective and suggests that:\n\n[…] the collapse of the early Tang trade and the demise of Guangzhou during the mid 8th century A.D. also destroyed the commercial dominance of the Thu Bon valley system, and when the South China Sea trade was transferred to the ports of the Red river delta during the late 8th century A.D., an entirely new pattern of trade emerged. The financial importance of Hanoi, and the emergence of a burgeoning maritime commerce with Java, encouraged a major shift in the displacement of trade wealth to south central Vietnam, in particular to the ports of Nha Trang and Phanrang, on the sea-route from Java to northern Vietnam. The independent states of Kauthara and Panduranga, which flourished here during the late 8th and early 9th centuries AD, became of central importance to the continuing history of Campa during this period. (Southworth 2001: 318)\n\n11Only one tribute mission of rhinoceros and buffalo from Huanwang was recorded in 793 (Maspero 1928: 104-105). In the meantime, Champa suffered from naval attacks by Malay and Javanese in 774 and 787 respectively. Soon after that, the Chinese record that Huanwang attacked the Chinese Protectorate of Annam twice in 803 and 809. These events provide strong evidence showing Champa’s ambition in competing with its northern rivalry ports in order to gain control over the maritime trade in the region (Wang 1998: 90). After the attack of Huanwang in 809, Chinese records cease to mention “Huanwang”.\n\n12As observed from tribute missions sent by Linyi and Huanwang to China during the Tang era, it was apparently that Champa was a major source of important commodities for China market and in return the maritime trade provided the financial and commercial basis for the great epigraphic and sculptural traditions of the 7th and early 8th centuries CE in Champa (Southworth 2001: 318). Champa’s trade with Tang Empire was mainly in its local products including ivory, rhinoceros horns, gharu-woods, tortoise-shell, amber and manufactured articles of gold and silver. In return, Champa received great amount of goods from China, especially the trading ceramics as presented below. The active engagement of Champa into the tributary system of Tang Empire was among the major factors leading to the prosperity of the trade in South China Sea during the Tang era (Wang 1998: 89).\n\nThe Expansion of Muslim networks in Maritime Asia and Champa’s engagement\n\n13The rise of Arab world from the 7th century CE had a significant implication in shaping, operating and developing both overland and maritime trade networks of Eurasia in the following centuries. Starting from the initial base in Konkan and Gujarat, Persians and Arabs gradually expanded their territory to the east and dominated the maritime trade routes along the coast of Indian Ocean by the 9th century, turning the Indian Ocean into an “Arab Mediterranean” (Wink 1990: 65, 1997: 1). Arab traders then expanded their network to Southeast Asia and southern China by the 10th century (Wink 1997 : 1, Salmon 2004). By the late 12th century, the maritime trade in South China Sea was basically in the hands of Muslim and Tamil traders (Wade 2009: 234).\n\n14As the controllers of maritime trade in the South China Sea, Arab traders and travellers appeared to have rich knowledge of the mercantile ports along the maritime trade routes of the region. In the 9th century, Ibn Khordadbeh recorded the trade ports at the furthest extension from the Arab world as Luqin (likely Loukin, situated in what is today Vietnam), Khanfu (Guangzhou/Canton), Khanju (Quanzhou), with Qansu (Yangzhou) marking the end of the maritime route (Wade 2010: 367-368). With the emergence of Arab networks in the region, the Cham soon recognized the opportunity and actively participated into the regional maritime trade networks. Champa ports, especially the ports in Amaravati region became a rival of the ports in northern Vietnam, and were seen as regularly destinations for international trading vessels. Sanf – the term used by Arab traders designating both the country of Champa as well as its mercantile port, was repeatedly mentioned in various travelling records by Ya’Qūbī (9th century), Mas‘udi (10th century), Ibn al-Nadīm (988 CE), Aja’ib al-Hind (c.1000 CE), the Mukhtasar al-Aja’ib (c.1000 CE) and Idrisi (mid-12th century) (Tibbetts 1979, Ferrand 1913-1914).\n\n15Although the relationship between Champa and the Muslim network since the 9th century is quite clear, the issue of when exactly Islam penetrated into Champa still remains debatable and has not yet been studied comprehensively. Rie Nakamura assumes that there were apparently two waves of contacts between Champa with the Muslim world. The first wave, according to her, probably took place no later than the 9th century and featured the key role of the Persians, Arab, Indian and Chinese Muslims. The second wave of contacts occurred during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when the Malay Muslim trade was at its height in the regional waters (Nakamura 2000: 58). During the first period of contacts, individuals of Champa converted to Islam, however, Rie suggests, “these conversions would have been rather isolated instances, limited to commercial circles and the court which had relationships with foreign communities.” (Ibid.: 59.)\n\n[…] at the time when I was in India the king who ruled in Sanf was called Lajin. The monk of Najran told me that at that time the king was a king called the King of Luqin who had invaded Sanf, ravaged it and enslaved all the inhabitants. (Tibbetts 1979: 41-42)\n\n17Vietnamese historical records also mention a noble, known as Lưu Kỳ Tông, who fled to Champa and then established himself as king of Champa by end of the 10th century.\n\n18The earliest Arab accounts of Champa are included in the Kitab al-masalik wa’l-mamalik of Ibn Khurdadhbih and in the Akhbar al-Sin wa’l-Hind, which dated to around 850 CE (Tibbetts 1979: 25-29). The first of these texts includes a section describing the maritime route from Persian coast to the East. A journey of three days from the Khmer realm (Qmār) to Champa (Sanf) before sailing to Annam (Luqin) is described as follow:\n\n4 Pulau Tioman.\n\n5 The Khmer polity, likely around the Mekong delta.\n\n6 William Southworth suggests that the Cham port used on this journey was probably Nhatrang (Southwo (...)\n\n[…] On leaving Mā’it, one find to the left, the island of Tiyūma4 […] From there one goes in five days to Qmār5 […] From Qmār to Sanf is three days following the coast. The aloeswood of Sanf, known under the name Sanfi, is superior to that of Qmar…From Sanf6 to Lūqīn which is the first step of China, is a hundred parasangs either by land or sea. (Tibbetts 1979: 28-29)\n\n8 Pulau Tioman.\n\n9 Tibbetts suggests various locations and equivalents for Kadrang (Tibbetts 1979: 157-59). Ferrand s (...)\n\n10 Southworth suggests this journey probably stopped in Quảng Nam Province (2004).\n\n11 The island of Hai-nan.\n\nThen the ships travel to a place called Tiyūma,8 which has fresh water for anyone who desires it, and the distance to it is ten days. Then the ships set sail for a place called Kadrang and arrive there after ten days. There one also finds fresh water. Such are the islands of India, wherever you find springs you will find fresh water in them. At Kadrang9 is a high mountain where slaves and robbers sometimes hide. The ships next reach a place called Sanf10 situated at a distance of ten days; there they find also fresh water, and from this place is exported a kind of aloeswood called Sanfī. This place is a kingdom. The inhabitants are brown and each one of them wears two fūtas. When the ships have taken fresh water they set sail for a place named Sundur Fūlāt,11 which is an island in the sea, ten days distance away [from Sanf]. Here also fresh water is found. Then they set sail as far as sea called Sankhai, as far as the ‘Gates of China’. (Tibbetts 1979: 26-27)\n\n20In the Chinese travelling accounts, Champa ports also depicted as important spots for long-distance ships to anchor while sailing from South China ports to the Southern Seas. In about 800 CE, Jia Dan (730-805) wrote a book with a range of itineraries describing major maritime trade route from China to the Persian Gulf. Although Jia Dan’s book is now lost, but this maritime route was recorded in the Xin Tang Shi. As could be seen below, the importance of several ports along Champa coast were featured:\n\n12 Xin Tang shu, juan 43C, 18b, cited from Wang (1998: 98). For further details, see Pelliot (1904).\n\nSailing from Canton, it is 200 li to the south-east, to T’un-men Shan [an anchorage south of Pao-an and opposite the north coast of Lantao Island], and two days towards the west to Chiuchou Shih [Ch’I islands or Taya Islands, north-east point of Hainan], and two days towards the south to Hsiang Shih [Tu-chu-shen or Tinhosa Island, or even further south], and three days towards the south-west to Chan-pu-lau Shan [Culao Cham], which is in the sea 200 li east of Huanwang, and two days towards the south to Ling Shan and one day [towards the south] to Men-tu Kuo and one more day [towards the south] to Ku-ta Kuo and half a day [towards the south] to Pen-t’o-land Chou and two days [towards the south-east] to Chun-t’u-nung Shanand five days [further to the south-east] to a Strait, 100 li from north to south, which the barbarians call che [Straits of Malacca], and three days sailing westwards out of the Straits to Ko-Ko-seng-ti Kuo, many of whose people were devoted to robbery and plunder, and were much feared by those who travel in ships and four or five days [towards the north-west?] to Sheng-teng Chou [east coast of Sumatra, near Deli?], and five days towards the west to P’o-lu Kuo [north-west Sumatra, Perlak or Perkir or Baros, the P’o-lu-shih of I-ching] and six days [towards the west or north-west] to Ch’ieh-lan Chou [one of the Niclobar Islands].12\n\n21Following the suggestion of Chia Tan’s maritime route from South China to the Straits of Malacca and compare with the availability of both inscriptions and archaeological evidences along the coastal central Vietnam, we could to some extent identify important mercantile ports of Champa during the 9th century CE. The maritime route originated from Canton – the most important port of China for centuries, especially during the Tang era. From Canton, it took several days to reach the first position on the coast of Champa namely Chan-pu-lau Shan. Chia Tan suggested that Chan-pu-lau Shan is “in the sea” and its exact location is “200 li east of Huanwang.”The Chan-pu-lao Shan, thus, could be easily identified as the Cù Lao Chàm Island, off the coast of modern Hội An port city. Huanwang, as Chinese accounts and archaeological evidence show, is undoubtedly the Trà Kiệu Citadel where served as the political center of nagara Amaravati in the 9th century. The Newer Tang History provides another account of Champa in the name of Huanwang:\n\nHuanwang, originally Linyi, is called Zhanbulao and also Zhanpo. It is situated 3,000 li by sea south of Fuzhou. Its land area east to west is more than 300 li and 100 li north to south. It is bounded to the west by Mount Wuwen of Zhenla and is bordered on the south by Benlangtou zhou. (Goble 2014: 9)\n\n22Leaving Cù Lao Chàm, it took two days going to the south to reach Ling Shan. While Zhan-pu-lao Shan is generally accepted by scholars as Cù Lao Chàm Island, the term “Ling Shan”, however, has called for discussion among scholars. The Ling Shan or “Ling Mountain” has conventionally been associated with Cap Varella, near the Cả pass in Phú Yên province but the course of this itinerary suggests that Ling Shan in Chia Tan’s record must be located at between Cù Lao Chàm Island and Kauthara/Nha Trang. Southworth suggests that “Ling Shan” could be identified with the Cù Lao Re island but given the fact that the distance between these two islands is not too far and it take less than one day by sail from this island to one another (2000: 242). Wang Gungwu speculates that Ling Shan was possibly Cape Sa-hoi [Sa Huynh], in the south of Quảng Ngãi province (Wang 1998: 98). The new discoveries in Bình Định province, however, suggest that Ling Shan should be associated with a position around the modern Quy Nhon city, Bình Định province. It is interesting that there is still a pagoda in the name of Ling Shan located at the top of the mountain in Phuong Mai peninsula, which lies between the Thị Nại bay and the eastern Sea/South China Sea. A Champa statue with few Sanskrit words carved on its back is still visible to researchers and thus suggest that this position once was a temple during Champa period. It should be noted that Thị Nại gulf, just next to the Ling Shan Pagoda, is a very good water area for huge trading vessels. Nagara Vijaya, where the Thị Nại port and the Ling Shan temple located, was emerging as a rival of nagara Amaravati in the north by 9th century, and thus it is possible that this area was on the maritime itinerary of the Chinese. (Note that Jia Dan’s account refers to several different “guo”, or countries, indicating separate Champa polities.) The two-day journey from Cù Lao Chàm to Ling Shan in Bình Định province is also acceptable.\n\nNagara Amaravati and the Cross-Cultural Exchange through the Tang Era\n\n24Throughout the history, Champa maintained the situation of simultaneous existence of several different nagaras/polities based on their ability to control the trade networks along the major rivers. The history of Champa noted the existence of major powerful centers/nagaras including the region north of Hai Van Pass (from present-day Hue Province to Quảng Bình province), nagara Amaravati (from Da Nang to Quảng Ngãi province), nagara Vijaya (including Bình Định and Phú Yên provinces), nagara Kauthara in Khánh Hòa province and nagara Panduranga (in Ninh Thuận and Binh Thuận provinces). These centers of power had existed simultaneously, competed and allied with each other. The topographical features, the lack of large agricultural communities, the shortage of manpower, as well as the absence of a centralized administrative tradition all contributed to the failure of Cham in building a centralized state like the Vietnamese and the Khmer had done successfully. The history of Champa, however, witnessed the emergence of certain nagaras in some period of time who could control administratively and economically other nagaras and put other territories under their direct control. Among them, nagara Amaravati had served as a dominant center of Champa civilization where the Cham built two large sanctuaries at My Son and Đồng Dương, the capital city in Trà Kiệu and a system of commercial ports in Đà Nẵng, Hội An and Cù Lao Chàm island.\n\n26From this time onwards, the name of Campapura, Campa or Campapuri began to appear regularly in Champa inscriptions. The kings of Champa called Campadesa while the place where he resides called Campapura/city or citadel of Champa that is Siṅhapura/Trà Kiệu since the 7th century. The inscriptions by this period refer repeatedly to Valkimi and Indian epic, and this suggests that the rulers of Champa had begun to apply the traditional Indian political and administrative models in Champa. The king of Siṅhapura (or of nagara Amaravati) was the king of kings [of entire nagara Champa], the gods in Mỹ Sơn sanctuary were the gods of all territories of Champa and Siṅhapura citadel was the capital of mandala Champa as a whole.\n\n27The period from 9th to 12th centuries could be seen as the most prosperous period in the entire history of the nagara Amaravati both economically and politically. Firstly, it was during this period that the Đồng Dương sanctuary was formed and, along with the near-by Mỹ Sơn sanctuary, served as the primary religious center of entire mandala Champa. The prosperity of the Đồng Dương dynasty had also given way for the birth of a brilliant artistic style in the art history of Champa namely the Đồng Dương art style. Secondly, the numbers of inscriptions in the nagara Amaravati increased significantly. It’s worth noting that, Amaravati and Kauthara were the two centers of inscription production of Champa during this period. The content of inscriptions provides invaluable information for our awareness on various issues of Champa history including the political organization, religion, society and economic activities. Finally, the foreign trade and mercantile ports of Amaravati flourished during these centuries as will be presented below. Economic prosperity laid the foundation for the political stability and development of Đồng Dương dynasty, the economic basis for the construction of Đồng Dương and Mỹ Sơn sanctuaries as well as the proliferation of Champa inscriptions during this period.\n\nCross-Cultural Exchange in Hội An – Cù Lao Chàm Island\n\n30Recent archaeological excavations in Đà Nẵng and Quảng Nam provinces have unearthed a huge amount of trading ceramics originated from various regions of Asia and thus intensely affirmed the economic prosperity of this region in the past. Archaeological finds reveal that the economic activities of nagara Amaravati had undertaken mostly at the northern bank of Thu Bon River. The Estuary of Thu Bon river was recorded in Chinese accounts as the economic center of Huanwang kingdom—the Linyi Town (V: Lâm Ấp Phố). The Thu Bon river, as Tran Quoc Vuong and Tran Ky Phuong have both suggested, served as the nexus of economic activities of nagara Amaravati that connecting several economic zones stretching from the western mountains to the eastern river estuary (Trần Kỳ Phương 2008, Trần Quốc Vượng 1995). At the Hau Xa 1 site in the north side of Thu Bon estuary, archaeologists have excavated many Chinese ceramics sherds of the Tang and Song periods, as well as the Islamic ceramics sherds dating back to the 9th-11th centuries (Kikuchi 2010: 72). Also locate at the north side of Thu Bon estuary, the sites of Hậu Xá II, Trang Soi and Bàu Đà have unearthed many Chinese ceramic sherds from Yuezhou kilns in South China in 10th century (ibid.: 73). Based on these archaeological findings, Seiichi Kikuchi suggests that the northern bank of Thu Bồn river had become a favorable location for commodity exchanges of merchant ships in the East-West maritime trade route and thus the Lâm Ấp Phố in Chinese records could be identified with this area (Kikuchi 2010:81, Trần Quốc Vượng 1998: 443).\n\n31In the south of Thu Bồn estuary, archaeologists have found both ceramic artifacts and ancient coins. Tran Quoc Vuong and his colleagues had discovered many Chinese and Vietnamese ceramics and coins of the 9th-12th centuries in the Trung Phuong area (Trần Quốc Vượng 1995: 444). In 2012 and 2013 respectively, the author of this current study carried out surveys in southern bank of Thu Bồn estuary in searching for Chinese trading ceramics but the results were not fruitful. Perhaps, we have to wait until more thorough archaeological excavations being undertaken to have a firm conclusion about the economic activities of the Cham in this area of south Thu Bồn River.\n\n32While the Thu Bồn estuary served as the primary economic zone of Amaravati, the evidences from archaeology suggest that there were several other nearby places had also played important part in exchanging commodities with foreign merchants. The maritime voyages of both Chinese and Arab merchants noting that Cù Lao Chàm, an island off the Thu Bồn Estuary, was an important location for the seafaring sailors because they could obtain the fresh water, firewood, foods for their long-day journeys. The archaeological study of Cù Lao Chàm was kicked off in 1992 with a large-scale survey conducted by a joint group of Vietnamese and Japanese scientists. During the period from 1997 to 2000, the local archaeologists in conjunction with those from Vietnam National University had conducted detailed surveys and archaeological excavations in which the 1999 excavation was the largest mission. These archaeological studies in Cù Lao Chàm have important implications for the study of the commercial history of Champa in general, and of the nagara Amaravati in particular, as they provide physical evidence of the presence of a large volume of trading artifacts those originated from China, Southeast Asia, India and Middle East.\n\nChampa’s Cross-Cultural Trade and Long-Distance Exchange: A View from Maritime Archaeology\n\n34Recent archaeological discoveries in central Vietnam have made it possible to reconstruct a maritime history of Champa during the Tang period in which it features the important role of Champa as a hub for cross-cultural exchange in the maritime silk route. The excavations in Cù Lao Chàm have provided solid evidence to demonstrate the significance of this island in the maritime silk route as mentioned in Chinese records and presented earlier. The Châu Tân shipwreck and its commodities, as will be introduced below, indicate the presence of international merchants on the coast of Champa by the ninth century.\n\n38The discovery of Châu Tân shipwreck off the coast of Quảng Ngãi province has a significant implication for those studying the maritime contacts between ancient Champa and the outside world. Most importantly, it provides the physical evidence for what had been written by contemporary Arab and Chinese writers during the ninth century. This finding affirm that the coast of nagara Amaravati was a favourable destination for long-distance travellers and merchants during the Tang era. The recovered assemblages of this shipwreck as briefly introduced above could be seen as one of the fullest representation of cross-cultural exchanges by the ninth century which see the involvement of Arab traders, Chinese commodities, Southeast Asian ship technology. Champa’s coast, as mentioned in both Arab and Chinese maritime itineraries and strongly re-affirmed by Châu Tân shipwreck, appears to be the favorable destination of the cross-ocean vessels.\n\n39Combining evidence, we might sketch out the tentative/possible itinerary of the unfortunate Châu Tân ship as follow: Canton port in south China, where Arab and Persian traders had firmly established a trading colony by end of Tang period, appeared to be the departure place. This ship might call at Hainan coast for fresh water and goods before arriving at the coast of Champa. Although the Châu Tân ship was unfortunately sank off the coast of Quảng Ngãi, roughly 100km south of Thu Bồn estuary and Cù Lao Chàm island, we, however, believe that this vessel had called at either Cù Lao Chàm island or Thu Bồn river estuary before setting sail to the south. Information from Champa inscription and the discovery of Chinese and Islamic artifacts along the Thu Bồn river banks suggest that a short stay of Arab and Chinese traders for the purpose of exchanging goods and visiting the local rulers is arguably imaginable. Leaving the port of Amaravati and sailing along the coast, the ship was shortly sank due to either an ocean-storm or hitting the reef. The later reason appears to be more reasonable when we note that many shipwrecks have been discovered off the coast of Quảng Ngãi in recent years. If the ship had not sank, its next destination would probably be the mercantile port of nagara Panduranga in south of Champa before leaving for Pulao Condore. After leaving the sea of Champa, this ship might follow the same itinerary of the contemporary Belitung Ship and thus might anchor at a mercantile port of Java sea. The abundance of Arabic and Indic inscriptions written on the recovered ceramics suggest that the final destination of this ship may have been the Persian Gulf, or more precisely the Ambarak in north of ancient Siraf port if the information from the Indic inscriptions are accurate."
