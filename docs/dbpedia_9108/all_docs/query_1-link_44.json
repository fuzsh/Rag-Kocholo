        "text": "Section 11 – Da Qin (Roman territory/Rome)\n\n11.1. The kingdom of Da Qin 大秦 [Ta Ch’in] = Roman territory. The use of the exalted name “Da Qin” (literally, ‘Great Ch’in’ = ‘Great China’) for a foreign state is unexpected.\n\nThe Hou Hanshu states:\n\n“The people of this country are all tall and honest. They resemble the people of the Middle Kingdom and that is why this kingdom is called Da Qin.”\n\nWhile the Weilue claims:\n\n“The common people are tall and virtuous like the Chinese, but wear hu 胡 (‘Western’) clothes. They say they originally came from China, but left it.”\n\nThis folk etymology, charming as it is, does little to really explain the origin of the rather surprising name, Da Qin. It is reminiscent of the rather similar names for Ferghana – Dayuan = ‘Great Yuan,’ and for Bactria – Daxia = ‘Great Xia’? Graf (1996), pp. 199-200 says:\n\n“For Hirth and the initial interpreters of the HHS and WL accounts, the country designated as Ta-ch’in (“Greater Ch’in”) was to be identified with the Roman East. Although the term Ch’in referred to the Chinese as early as the second century A.D., the name Ta-ch’in perhaps is best understood as simply a reflection of Ch’in as the western region of China, i.e. Ta-ch’in represents the country beyond and comparable to Ch’in. It has also been observed, first by Shiratori and later by others, that the accounts of Ta-ch’in bear a deep resemblance to the Taoist Utopia and are therefore not to be completely understood literally, i.e. they present a fictitious religious world, not a real one. As will become obvious later, this fact did not prevent Shiratori from respecting the essential historical framework of the Chinese accounts of Ta-ch’in. For the most part, such mythological elements are so strikingly evident that they represent only a minimal problem.”\n\n“In the Roman world stories, some based on fact though often much distorted in transmission, others completely fanciful, began to circulate about the Seres, that is, the Silk People. A little later the name Sinae based, like Sanskrit Cīna and our present China, on Qín 秦, the name of the short-lived dynasty that preceded Han and united China in 221 B.C.E., also appears in western sources. At the same time the Chinese began to hear about a country in the far west which they called Dà Qín, Great Qín, apparently thinking of it as a kind of counter-China at the other end of the world.” Pulleyblank (1999), p. 71.\n\n“Moreover, as their geographical knowledge of the world grew with time, the Han Chinese even came to the realization that China was not necessarily the only civilized country in the world. This is clearly shown in the fact that the Later Han Chinese gave the Roman Empire (or, rather, the Roman Orient) the name of Great Ch’in (Ta Ch’in). According to the Hou-Han shu, the Roman Empire was so named precisely because its people and civilization were comparable to those of China.” Yü (1986), p. 379.\n\nThese place-names which begin with Da 大 may originally have been formed as attempts to transcribe foreign names into Chinese. Yu (1998) believes Daxia [dat-hea] stands for the Tochari (pp. 22, 35). and thinks it possible (ibid. p. 68) that Dayuan [dat-iuan] may have likewise represented the Tochari. It is just possible that Da Qin represents some similar process though, if this is the case, it is difficult to imagine what name it was originally intended to represent.\n\nHirth, and many other scholars who followed him, have taken Da Qin to refer to the ‘Roman Orient.’ I think that the term is often clearly used in a broader sense than this to mean the Roman Empire, or any territory subservient to Rome. It is true that all the dependencies mentioned in the Weilue are probably found in the ‘Roman Orient,’ but it specifically mentions that it only lists a few of the dependencies of Da Qin, presumably the ones visited by the Chinese, or those reported on to the Chinese, because of their importance for east-west trade. These are, quite naturally, territories in the ‘Roman Orient.’\n\nSometimes, the name is used more specifically: the Weilue gives directions across a ‘Great Sea’ (the Mediterranean) to “that country” (i.e. Da Qin) from Wuzhisan in Haixi, which is undoubtedly Alexandria in Egypt – see notes 11.5, 11.7 and Appendix C.\n\nThis is rather similar to the situation today when it is commonly said that one is “entering China,” when one enters territory inhabited by other people, but controlled by the Chinese, such as Tibet, or Chinese Turkestan (Sinjiang). Similarly, ‘Mexico’ may be used to refer to either the city or the country.\n\nTherefore I have translated Da Qin as either ‘Rome’ the city, ‘Roman territory,’ or the ‘Roman Empire,’ as the context demands. The reader should remember, meanwhile, that in each case the Chinese text will have only ‘Da Qin’.\n\n11.2. 黎靬 Lijian [Li-chien] – another name for Da Qin. Lijian [Li-chien – sometimes written Li-kan] is given here as another name for Da Qin or the Roman Empire.\n\n“The pronunciation jian (鉅連反 or 鉅言反) [for the second syllable of Lijian] is indicated by Yan Shigu (Qian Hanshu, chap. XCVI, a, p. 6a).” Translated from Chavannes (1905), p. 556, n. 4.\n\n“It becomes clear that, as first proposed by Brosset (1828) and accepted by a number of other scholars, including Markwart, De Groot, and Herrmann (1941), Líjiān is actually a transcription of Hyrcania, Old Persian Wrkāna, a country that existed in the second century B.C.E. on the southwest [sic – should read southeast] corner of the Caspian Sea; and that, surprisingly, it is Tiaozhi that is a good transcription of Seleukia. The difficulty with identifying Líjiān with Hyrcania is that, although it fits perfectly with the earliest account in the Shĭjì, the name was displaced when the passage was copied into the Hànshū and in later texts it reemerges as another name for Dà Qín. The latter identification led Pelliot to propose that it transcribed the name of Alexandria in Egypt, of which more will be said below.” Pulleyblank (1999), p. 73.\n\n“As for Líjiān, Hulsewé and Loewe, using Karlgren’s Old Chinese reconstruction, remarked that “although Liɘr-g’iän [for which they cite Yán Shīgǔ’s gloss to 靬 in the Hànshū which I believe is of doubtful authority in this case] could be said to resemble ‘Hyrcania’, it is a far cry to the original ‘Vehrkāna [i.e., Old Persian Wrkāna]” (1979: 118). In fact the sequence –rkan is common to both the Greek and the Old Persian and fits well with EMC lεj/li xɨan/kɨan, with Chinese l- <*r-. What is apparently missing is anything to correspond to Old Persian initial w-, represented in Greek by the syllable Hy- (the letter upsilon with spiritus asper). Note, however, that lí 利 EMC lih ‘sharp, profitable’, the phonetic in lí 犁 and lí 黎, is composed of dāo 刀 ‘knife’ + hé 禾 EMC γwaa̭ < *wál ‘grain’, presumably as a phonetic indicator. A full discussion cannot be given here but, assuming that this analysis of the graph is correct, one may tentatively reconstruct lí 犁 as Old Chinese *wrǝ́l > EMC *wríj > EMC lεj. We find a similar alternation in initials in the xiéshēng derivatives of lì 立 EMC lip ‘stand’ which include the etymologically related word wèi 位 EMC wih ‘position’.\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the name Líjiān (in the variant reading Líxuān 黎軒) is in Shĭjì 123 in what purports to be Zhāng Qiān’s report on the countries of the far west after his return to China ca. 125 B.C.E. It comes at the end of his account of Ānxí (Parthia) and reads:\n\n. . .。其西則條枝。北有奄蔡黎軒。條枝安息西數千里 , 臨西海。\n\n. . . To the west [of Ānxí] lies Tiáozhī and to the north Yăncài and Líxuān. Tiáozhī is situated several thousand li west of Ānxí and borders on the Western Sea. . . .\n\nThis is the standard and most natural pronunciation found, for example, in the Takigawa edition and the recent Zhónghuá shūjū edition. That is, the section on Ānxí ends with mention of three other more distant countries, after which a new section begins on one of these, namely Tiáozhī. Yăncài, already mentioned in the text as a country northwest of Kāngjū (at that time in the region of Tashkend), has long been identified with the Aorsoi of western sources, a nomadic people out of whom the well-known Alans later emerged (Pulleyblank [1962: 99, 220; 1968:252]). On the assumption that Líxuān (that is, Líjiān) was in roughly the same direction, the equation with Hyrcania on the southeastern side of the Caspian Sea fits perfectly.\n\nThere are two other references to Líxuān in Shĭjì 123, neither of which contradicts this. In the first, which has a parallel in Hànshū 61 but is not referred to by Leslie and Gardiner, it is said that after Zhāng Qiān’s death “more envoys were sent to Ānxí, Yăncài, Líxuān, Tiáozhī and Shēndú (India)” 因益發使安息, 有奄, 黎軒, 條枝, 身毒 (Zhonghua ed., p. 3170). Though Líxuān again comes in juxtaposition to Tiáozhī, it also again comes immediately after Yăncài.” Pulleyblank (1999), pp. 74-75. [Note that Pulleyblank has considerably more detail on the name Líjiān in this article, if you wish to check it further].\n\nGR No. 1611, gives discusses several possibilities for the derivation of the name Lijian in its various forms:\n\n“[a] JIAN [CHIEN1]\n\n(Etymological) Skin of a dried animal\n\n1. Piece of copper from the harness of a horse. 2. From 梨靬 or 犛靬 or黎靬 li2 jian1 [li2 chien1] (Historical geography – phonetic transcription of the ancient Greek Seleukidai) Li-chien: a. The Persian Hellenistic Empire of the Seleucides (365-64 BCE), of modern Afghanistan to the Aegean Sea; plus particularly : The Hellenistic Syria of the Seleucid kings (c. 358-93 BCE). At this period (dynasty: 西漢 Western Han 206 BCE – 8 CE) beginning, after the conquest of Bactria by the 月氏 Yuezhi, about 100 BCE, the exchanges, across the Pamir, between China and the West. B. All lands and kingdoms to the west of China; by extension : The Roman Empire (dynasty: 東漢 Eastern Han 25-220). – Cf. 大秦 da4 qin2 [ta2 ch’in2].\n\n[b] QIAN2 [CH’IEN2]\n\nFrom 麗靬 or 驪靬 li4 qian2 [li4 ch’ien2] (Historical geography) Liqian (Li-ch’ien) : ancient sub-prefecture situated in modern 甘肅 Gansu (Kan-su), instituted under the 東漢 Eastern Han dynasty to settle prisoners originally from territories designated under the name of 梨靬, 犛靬, 黎靬 “Lijian [Li-chien]” (Cf. supra), and abolished during the 北魏 Northern Wei dynasty (南北朝 period of the Dynasties of the South and the North, 420-589).” Translated and adapted from the French.\n\nThe character 黎 li is another form of 梨; both translated as ‘pear’ (although Karlgren gives ‘to plough’ for the first character and ‘pear’ for the second, and GR No. 6842, while giving ‘pear’ as the primary meaning, also gives, ‘old’, ‘aged’, ‘to divide’, and ‘dismember,’ as alternate meanings). All three forms of li show similar reconstructed pronunciations.\n\n黎 – K. 519g * liər / liei; EMC lεj\n\n梨 – K. 519h *li̯ər / lji; EMC li\n\n犛 – K. 979j * li̯əg / lji; EMC lɨ / li\n\nHirth (1885), p. 159 ff., and 170, n. 1, suggested it represented Rekem, an old name for Petra – both meaning ‘rock.’\n\nSeveral scholars have suggested that it must have been originally derived from ‘Alexandria’ or ‘Alexander.’ See, for example: Dubs (1957), pp. 2-3, and Sitwell (1984), p. 213, n. 22. Leslie and Gardiner (1996), pp. XVIII-XXVI and 253-254 argue that Li-kan (Lijian) referred originally to the Seleucid Empire. Also – see quote from GR above and under GR, No. 6864. For detailed reviews of the many theories about the origin and various forms of the name, see CICA: 117, n. 275, and Dubs (1957), pp. 24-26.\n\n“[Li-jien was also] used by the Chinese for Rome and the Roman empire. Their later name for the Roman empire was Da4H-ts’in2TU, the use of which begins in the Later Han period, when, in A.D. 166, a man came to the border of China, stating that he was an envoy from “the King of Da4H-ts’in2TU, An1JZ-dun1WA [Marcus Aurelius Antoninus].” Da-ts’in was used for the Roman empire until the Middle Ages, when the name Fu25DZ-lin3TS came to be used instead (for the Eastern Roman Empire). Prefacing the account of Da-ts’in in the History of the Later Han Dynasty, there is the statement, “The country of Da4H-ts’in2TU is also called Li2MGDZ- jien1MGG.” This statement is repeated in other Chinese accounts of foreign countries, so that there can be no reason for doubting it.\n\nThe name Li-jien was almost surely a Chinese transcription of the Greek word “Alexandria” and originally denoted the Alexandria in Egypt. We may even perhaps be able to tell how this word came into use in China.\n\n“Between 110 and 100 B.C., there arrived at the Chinese capital an embassy from the King of Parthia. Among the presents to the Chinese Emperor are stated to have been fine jugglers from Li-jien. The jugglers and dancers, male and female, from Alexandria in Egypt were famous and were exported to foreign countries. Since the King of Parthia obviously esteemed highly the Emperor of China, he naturally sent the best jugglers he could secure. When these persons were asked whence they came, they of course replied “from Alexandria,” which word the Chinese who disliked polysyllables and initial vowels and could not pronounce certain Greek sounds, shortened into “Li-jien.”. When they also learned that this place was different from Parthia, the Chinese naturally used its name for the country of these jugglers. No Chinese had been to the Roman empire, so they had no reason to distinguish a prominent place in it from the country itself. The Romans moreover had no name for their empire other than orbis terrarum, i.e., “the world,” so that these jugglers would have found it difficult to explain the name of the Roman empire! In such a fashion there probably arose the Chinese name Li-jien which, for them, denoted the Roman empire in general.” Dubs (1957), pp. 2-3. See also Dubs’ detailed discussion of the various forms of this name, ibid., pp. 24 n. 6.\n\n“It is possible that Li-jien originally meant ‘the land of Alexander’, just as An-hsi meant ‘the land of the Arsaces’; and that, having first been applied to the Seleucid kingdom, it was then extended to cover the nations (including Rome) whose rulers regarded themselves as the heirs of Alexander. It was a convenient coincidence that one of the largest cities of the West also bore this man’s name; but, pace Dubs, it seems most unlikely that Roman soldiers would ever have described themselves as ‘Alexandrians’.” Sitwell (1984), p. 213, n. 22.\n\n11.3. Dahai 大海 [Ta Hai] – ‘a great sea.’ I believe this must refer to what we now know as the Indian Ocean including the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. For details refer to Appendix C.\n\n11.4. The city of Angu 安谷 [An-ku] = Gerrha or modern Thaj.\n\nIt seems probable that the ‘Angu’ of the Weilue refers to the ancient trading city of Gerrha, and its port on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. We are told that to travel by boat from Angu to Haixi [= Egypt] with favourable winds took two months and with slow winds half a year. In Section 16 of the text it says that that, from Zesan, “can take half a year to cross the water, but with fast winds it takes a month” (to reach Lüfen, which is only a short distance by land and “across the sea” by a very long bridge from Haixi or Egypt). So, it is reasonable to deduce that Zesan was approximately half way between Angu to Egypt, and the northern part of Azania fits this description remarkably well.\n\nGerrha admirably fits the statements in the Weilue that Angu is, “on the frontier of Anxi (Parthia)” and is in close communication with Zesan [= Azania].”\n\n“There was more about Gerrha [in the Greek and Roman writers] than about any other place in Arabia, but even so it was not more than could be committed to a small piece of paper. Oddly enough, in Arrian’s description of Alexander’s preparation for a campaign against Arabia, including the coastal explorations of 323 B.C., there was not the slightest mention of Gerrha. But Eratosthenes, writing about a hundred years after Alexander, tells of the merchants of Gerrha carrying their spices and incense overland to Mesopotamia. This is contradicted by Aristobulus, says Strabo, who tells that the merchants travelled by raft to Babylonia. Strabo, who wrote in the last two decades B.C., quotes Artemidorus, of the previous century, as saying: “By the incense trade . . . the Gerrhaei have become the richest of all tribes, and possess a great quantity of wrought articles in gold and silver, such as couches, tripods, basins, drinking vessels; to which we must add the costly magnificence of their houses; for the doors, walls, and roof are variegated with inlaid ivory, gold, silver, and precious stones.”\n\nThe historian Polybius about the same time tells of a campaign of the Seleucid king, Antiochus III, who took a fleet along the Arabian coast in 205 B.C., with the intention of conquering Gerrha; but he was persuaded by large presents of silver and precious stones, to leave the city unharmed.\n\nThere was thus little doubt that in the first, second, and third centuries B.C. Gerrha was an exceedingly wealthy city, trading overland and by sea in aromatics, presumably the frankincense of the Hadramaut. Strabo even tells us where Gerrha lay, but his account is difficult to interpret. Gerrha, he says, is “a city situated on a deep gulf; it is inhabited by the Chaldeans, exiles from Babylon; the soil contains salt and the people live in houses made of salt. . . . The city is about 200 stadia” – about 60 miles [actually only about 37 km – as 1 Greek stadium = 185 metres] – “distant from the sea.” And you sail “onward,” he says, from Gerrha to Tylos and Arados, which are the Bahrain islands.\n\nThe elder Pliny, writing in the middle of the first century A.D., is more explicit, and I knew the description by heart. Describing the Arabian shore of the Gulf he comes to the island of Ichara, which must be our Ikaros, and then the Gulf of Capeus, and then the Gulf of Gerrha. “Here we find the city of Gerrha, five miles [five Roman miles = 7.41 km] in circumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt. Fifty miles [74.1 km] from the coast, lying in the interior, is the region of Attene, and opposite to Gerrha is the island of Tylos, an equal number of miles distant from the coast; it is famous for the vast numbers of its pearls . . .”\n\nTylos, we knew, was Bahrain, and the region of Attene fifty miles inland was normally believed to be the Hofuf oasis. . . .” Bibby (1970), pp. 317-318.\n\nD.T. Potts has, I believe, convincingly identified the town of Gerrha with modern Thaj, and located the port of Gerrha near the modern port of al-Jubayl:\n\n“A recent attempt by W. W. Müller to deduce the Semitic origin of the Greek name ‘Gerrha’ has important implications for the solution to the problem of the site’s location. Müller postulates that the ancient Hasaitic designation for ‘the city’ would have been *han-Hagar, from which an Aramaicized ‘Hagarā’ could have developed. As the use of Aramaic in this area is well-attested (see ch. 5 below), this presents no difficulties. From the form ‘Hagarā’, then, the Greek form ‘Gerrha’ can be derived. The application of the term ha—ar to a walled city with towers and bastions was stressed by H. Von Wissmann in his final, posthumously published work on Sabaean history. If a similar usage obtained in north-eastern Arabia where, as we have seen, the South Arabian alphabet was used in the indigenous Hasaitic inscriptions, then one immediately thinks of Thaj as a likely candidate for the site of ancient Gerrha. Pliny’s statement that Gerrha ‘measures five miles round and has towers made of squared blocks of salt’ is, moreover, reminiscent of the white limestone city wall at Thaj discussed above; nor are there any other sites of the period in eastern Arabia which fit such a description. Finally, if we remember the admittedly rough calculation of the distance between Gerrha and Teredon which brought us to the region of al-Jubayl, it is interesting to note that this is in fact Thaj’s traditional and indeed only outlet to the sea. Thus, there exists at least a strong possibility that Thaj and al-Jubayl are the sites of the inland town of Gerrha and its coastal port.” Potts (1990), pp. 89-90.\n\n“As we have seen, Androsthenes’ information on Tylos [modern Bahrain], and by extension that of Theophrastus, can be dated to the lifetime of Alexander. Some of Pliny’s material, such as the parts drawn from Juba, can be dated roughly to the time of Christ, around the middle of the Parthian period. When we move into the second century AD, an altogether different perspective on Bahrain is afforded by an important inscription discovered during the 1939-40 season of excavations at Palmyra. The text belongs to a group of Palmyrene texts known as ‘caravan inscriptions’, in which a prominent citizen was honoured by his compatriots for services rendered in the caravan trade between Palmyra and Babylonia. In this case, the text records that in AD 131 the Palmyrene merchants of Spasinou Charax erected a statue at Palmyra in honour of Iarhai, son of Nebozabad. What makes this text so important, however, is the added fact that Iarhai is said to have served as ‘satrap of the Thilouanoi for Meredat, king of Spasinou Charax’. Spasinou Charax, a city located near modern Basra in the southernmost Babylonian province of Mesene, was the capital of the small but important kingdom of Characene. Situated in the shadow of Parthia, this kingdom enjoyed commercial success and attendant fame out of all proportion to its size, since Spasinou Charax was the most important Babylonian port of call for ships arriving laden with luxury goods from the East during the first century BC and the first two centuries AD. Palmyrene traders, as purveyors of these Eastern goods to Roman Syria and ultimately to the wider Mediterranean world, had established permanent colonies at Babylon, Vologesias, and, most importantly, at Spasinou Charax.\n\nThe Palmyrene caravan inscriptions leave us in no doubt that Palmyrene commerce with the kingdom of Characene was a great success. Given the close commercial ties between Charax and the Palmyrene community, therefore, it is hardly surprising that the king of Charax should have employed a citizen of Palmyra in a political capacity, as satrap of the Thilouanoi. For many years, however, scholars did not recognise the significance of the satrapal name implied here. It was not until 1968, when a collection of notes completed by E. Herzfeld in 1948 was published posthumously, that the meaning became clear. The Thilouanoi were the inhabitants of Thiloua or Thilouos, which name is clearly an Aramaicised form of ‘Tylos’ [modern Bahrain]. Thus, by the early second century AD Bahrain was a satrapy of the kingdom of Characene.\n\nMeredat will be dealt with in greater detail in Chapter 6 below, but it is important to note that, as we now know from a Graeco-Parthian inscription recently discovered at Seleucia-on-Tigris, he was a member of a high-ranking Parthian family. Thus, as a Parthian on the Characene throne, his rule represented an extension of Parthian influence over Charax and the Gulf. That he came into conflict with other branches of the Parthian nobility, however, is likely, and twenty years after he was mentioned in the inscription from Palmyra, he was driven off the Characene throne by the Parthian king Vologases IV and heard of no more. From this time on, a more purely Parthian political presence was established in the central Arabian Gulf. . . . ” Potts (1990), pp. 145-146.\n\nAlthough modern Thaj is situated well inland, there are some recent indications that the town may, during historical times, have actually been at the edge of a large inlet that joined with the Persian Gulf itself (thus averting the need for a separate port), as the following abstract indicates:\n\n“Holocene sedimentation processes at the Saudi Arabian Gulf coast”\n\nProjekte unter Leitung von PD Dr. Hans-Jörg Barth\n\nFunding: Deutsche Forschungs Gemeinschaft (DFG), National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD), Riyadh\n\nAbstract\n\nEustatic fluctuations of sea level during Pleistocene and Holocene times resulted in remarkable shifts of the shoreline along the Arabian Gulf. But even after the establishment of the present sea level around 1000 years ago, the coastal geography experienced significant alterations. Satellite data indicate that a large territory west of Jubail might once have been part of the Arabian Gulf. Concerning the location of the lost city of Gerrha, which Alexander the Great was planning to invade shortly before his death, archaeological sources mention a large inlet east of the city. The ruins of Thaj 90 km west of Jubail in the middle of the desert are located directly at the western shore of the assumed inlet. That leads to the assumption that Thaj is the “lost city of Gerrha”. Recent accumulation in the Jubail area at the Saudi Arabian Gulf coast is dominated by terrestrial aeolian processes. Cyanobacteria which is abundant in the intertidal flats, were discovered below about 70 cm of terrestrial and marine sediments in a sabkha environment. This sabkha is located in a distance of more than two kilometers from the actual intertidal. 14C dating of the cyanobacteria provided an age of not more than 700 years. Sedimentation characteristics indicate a significant change in sedimentation processes from marine to aeolian accumulation of terrestrial dune sand some time after the cyanobacterial growth 700 years ago. Progradation at rates of more than three meters per year implies a considerable sand source as well as intensive sand movement. Therefore a reduction in vegetation cover seems most probable to have caused this development. Strong winds moved sandy substrate in southern to southeastern directions where it finally accumulated in the intertidal. Whether a climatic change or human impact or even both led to this reduction in the vegetation cover, is presently unknown.” Downloaded on 10 November 2003, from: http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_III/Geographie/phygeo/barth.htm\n\nFor more details on these identifications refer to Appendix H.\n\n11.5. Haixi 海西 – literally: ‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt. Refer to Appendix B, especially subsection (a) “Haixi 海西 – literally: ‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt.”\n\n11.6. “With favourable winds it takes two months; if the winds are slow, perhaps a year; if there is no wind, perhaps three years.” This account from the Weilue gives a somewhat different account of the time it can take to reach Da Qin from the Persian Gulf, than the story told to Gan Ying recounted in the Hou Hanshu:\n\n“In the ninth Yangyuan year [97 CE], during the reign of Emperor He, the Protector General Ban Chao sent Gan Ying to Da Qin (the Roman Empire). He reached Tiaozhi (Characene and Susiana) next to a large sea. He wanted to cross it, but the sailors of the western frontier of Anxi (Parthia) said to him:\n\n“The ocean is huge. Those making the round trip can do it in three months if the winds are favourable. However, if you encounter winds that delay you, it can take two years. That is why all the men who go by sea take stores for three years. The vast ocean urges men to think of their country, and get homesick, and some of them die. When (Gan) Ying heard this, he gave up his plan.” TWR.\n\nThe shorter time of 2 months to make the round trip from the Persian Gulf to Da Qin in the Weilue compared to the 3 months mentioned in the Hou Hanshu can be explained by the expansion of Parthia to include the port of Gerra, which was considerably closer to the Red Sea ports than Charax Spasinu, the port Gan Ying reached in 97 CE.\n\n11.7. The city of (Wu) Chisan (烏) 遲散 [(Wu) Ch’ih-san] = Alexandria.\n\n“On the name of Alexandria in Indian literature, cf. in the first place S. Lévi’s paper of 1934, reprinted in Mémorial Sylvain Lévi (Paris, 1937, 413-423). Lévi concurs with the opinion I first upheld in 1914 (JA, 1914, II, 413-417) that the Alasanda of the Questions of King Menander was the Egyptian Alexandria. Moreover, ālisaṃdaga, the name of a bean, and ālakandaka, a name of the coral, must be nouns derived from Alexandria.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhist texts, the Chinese version of the Questions of King Menander gives a form 阿茘散 A-li-san (* •Â-ljie̯-sân), nearer to the Greek original for the vowel of the second syllable than Pâli Alasanda. Lévi (loc. cit. 418) also thought he had found the name of Alexandria in the Chinese version of Nāgārjuna’s commentary on the Prajñāpāramitā; but he elicited it through a correction which I hold as very doubtful.\n\nApart from Buddhist texts, I proposed in TP, 1915, 690-691, to identify with Alexandria of Egypt the name 黎軒 Li-hsüan (*Liei-χi̯ɐn), Li-kan 犂靬 (* Liei-kân), etc., known in China from the end of the 2nd cent. B. C. Although others entertain different views, I still think that the equivalence is substantially correct. It remains doubtful whether, in the first half of the 3rd cent. A. D., the name of Alexandria underlies the transcriptions 遲散 Ch’ih-san (* D´’i-sân) and 烏遲散 Wu-ch’ih-san (*·Uo-d´’i-sân) of the Wei lio; cf. HIRTH, China and the Roman Orient, 181-182 (but the equivalence has gained in probability now that we know for certain that 烏弋山離 Wu-i-shan-li [*·Uo-i̯ək-ṣǎn-ljie̯, still more anciently ·O-di̯ək-sǎn-ljia], certainly renders the name of another Alexandria; cf. ZDMG, 1937, 252; TP, 1938, 148). Chao Ju-kua, writing in 1225, has a whole paragraph on 遏根陀 O-ken-t’o (*·Ât-kən-d’â), and describes its Pharos with the wonderful mirror (HR, 146-147; cf. LE STRANGE, Nuzhat-al-Qulūb, transl., 239-241); this last transcription is made the Arabic form Iskandariya.” Pelliot (1959), p. 29.\n\n“A better phonetic correspondence to Alexandria in a western context [than Lijian] is provided by Chísăn 遲散 or Wūchísăn 烏遲散 EMC ?ɔ dr̮i san’ (or sanh), said in the Wèilüè to be the first place one reaches in Dà Qín and identified by Hirth as Alexandria. The first syllable wū 烏(truncated in the first case) is the regular equivalent in Han times for a foreign initial a-, replaced by ā 阿 EMC ?a, in the new-style transcriptions that appear in the early Buddhist texts. The few xiéshēng connections of chí 遲, which appears to have xi 犀 EMC sεj as phonetic, do not give the kind of clear-cut evidence for *l- as the source of the Middle Chinese retroflexed stop, dr̮, that we find in the cases of EMC d < *l cited above; but neither do they support a connection with Old Chinese dental stops. It is relevant that, as Hirth noted, Middle Chinese dr̮- was sometimes used in transcriptions of Sanskrit to represent the voiced retroflex stop ḍ, a sound that is rather close to [l].” Pulleyblank (1999), p. 76.\n\n“Ancient Alexandria stood about twelve miles from the Canoptic branch of the Nile, with which it was united by a canal. The lake Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north. It was divided into straight parallel streets, cutting one another at right angles. One great street, two thousand feet wide, ran through the whole length of the city, beginning at the gate of the sea, and terminating at the gate of Canopus. It was intersected by another of the same breadth, which formed a square at their junction half a league in circumference. From the centre of this great place, the two gates were to be seen at once, and vessels arriving under full sail from both the north and the south. In these two principal streets, the noblest in the universe, stood their most magnificent palaces, temples, and public buildings, in which the eye was never tired with admiring the marble, the porphyry, and the obelisks, which were destined at some future day to embellish the metropolis of the world. The chief glory of Alexandria was its harbor. It was a deep and secure bay in the Mediterranean, formed by the shore on the one side, and the island of Pharos on the other, and where numerous fleets might lie in complete safety. Without the walls of Alexandria, and stretching along the shores of the Mediterranean, near to the promontory of Lectreos, was situated the palace and gardens of the Ptolemies. They contained within their inclosure the museum, an asylum for learned men, groves and buildings worthy of royal majesty, and a temple where the body of Alexander was deposited in a golden coffin. It were endless to enumerate the many palaces, temples, theatres, and other buildings with which Alexandria and its suburbs were adorned.” Edwards and Brown (1835), p. 57.\n\n“This position [as: “the most important commercial city of the Mediterranean world”] Alexandria owed to its natural advantages. There were two magnificent harbours, the Great Harbour to the east and the Eunostus (Harbour of Fortunate Return), with a smaller, artificially excavated harbour at its rear, to the west. The harbours were separated by an artificial dyke, the Heptastadium, linking the mainland to the island of Pharos on which the famous lighthouse stood. These accommodated an immense volume of maritime trade with the Mediterranean world and also made Alexandria an important centre of the shipbuilding industry. To the south of the city, Lake Mareotis, which itself had a harbour on its northern shore, was linked by canals to the Canopic branch of the Nile delta, giving access to the river valley. Not only did this make available to Alexandria as much of Egypt’s domestic produce as she required – the large-scale transport of grain from the valley was, of course, absolutely essential to feed the city’s populace – but it also linked her through the important entrepôt of Coptos to the ports of the Red Sea coast and a network of trading relations with India and Arabia, which reached its apogee in the Roman period. Great though the volume of imports through this route was, it was outweighed, as Strabo noted, by the volume of exports which Alexandria despatched to the south.” Bowman (1996), pp. 218-219.\n\n“But to form an estimate of the number of Jews that statedly resided in Alexandria, it may be sufficient to mention that about the year of Christ 67, while the quarrel was going on between that people and the Romans, which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, the subversion of their ecclesiastical polity and their ruin as a nation, fifty thousand of them were put to death at one time in the city of Alexandria! It is said that at the time this terrible event took place, there were not less than a million of Jews dispersed through the whole province of Egypt, in which they had a vast number of synagogues, and oratories which were either demolished or consumed by fire, for refusing to set up the statues of the Roman emperor, Caius Caligula.” Edwards and Brown (1835), p. 58.\n\nFor a discussion of the various Chinese transcriptions of Alexandria see: Pelliot (1959), p. 29.\n\n11.8. The city of Wudan 烏丹 [Wu-tan] = Tanis? I believe that Wudan, Egyptian Ta-an, or Tsàn, refers to the Egyptian city of Tanis, capital of the Eastern Nile Delta.\n\n烏 K. 61a *•o / uo; EMC ?ɔ\n\n丹 K. 150a *tân / tân; EMC tan\n\n“The Ancient Egyptian name of that place was “D’n.t”, in egypto-speak rendered Djanet. I suppose it rather sounded like *Dja’ane, for the Greeks heard it as Tanis (-is Greek ending), but the Hebrews heard it as Zoan, and the Assyrians heard it as Saanu. Perhaps someone else can give you the Coptic, which would be the most relevant for you.” Email correspondence from Aayko Eyma, 24/12/98.\n\nIt appears from the Weilue that one could sail all the way from Zesan to the city of Wudan. Assuming this identification of Wudan and Tanis is correct, then reaching Tanis via the ancient Nile canal to the Red Sea was possible. The canal had been recently re-dredged by Trajan and Hadrian. For more details, see Appendix M.\n\n11.9. This text appears to refer to crossing the Sebannitus and then the Canopis branches of the Nile. For details see Appendix M.\n\n11.10. fayudadusan 凡有大都三. “There are, in all, three major cities.” I understand this text to mean that there are three major cities that you meet with on the journey from the Pelusic branch of the Nile to Alexandria. These would have been, at the time, Daphnae, Tanis and Alexandria. In the Chinese text accompanying the translation by Hirth (1885), p. 111, end of line 12, he has the character xi 郤 – ‘interval,’ ‘gap.’ but he doesn’t include this word in his translation – “There are three great divisions of the country [perhaps : three great cities].” It is clear that it must be mistaken for the commonly confused character, que 卻 = ‘now,’ ‘meanwhile,’ etc.\n\nIn fact, the use of the character xi does not make sense here and it was obviously intended to be attached to the beginning of the next sentence, as is made clear in the punctuation of the New China Library 1975 Edition. The translation then reads smoothly, with the following sentence beginning: “Now (or, ‘meanwhile’), if you leave the city of Angu. . . . ”\n\nAlso, Hirth’s suggestion that du 都 might represent a division of the country cannot be supported. The character at this period had the meaning of a large walled town, city, or a provincial capital; although much later – during the Song and Qing dynasties – it sometimes had the meaning of a small territorial unit. See GR, No. 11668.\n\n11.11. The territory called 海北 Haibei ‘North of the Sea’ here must refer to the lands between Babylonia and what is now Jordan and/or Syria. Refer to Appendix B, especially under the subheading: (b) Haibei 海北 ‘North of the Sea.’\n\n11.12. This text seems to imply that there was a journey of more than a day from Alexandria along the coast before actually sailing for Rome. This gives a total time of seven or more days from Alexandria to Ostia. Six days would seem to be about right for the sailing time from the neighbourhood of Appollonia in Cyrene (west of Egypt) to Ostia, the port for Rome.\n\nThe total sailing times between Alexandria and Puteoli, to the south of Rome, are given in The Times Atlas of World History (1978), p. 91, as “15-20 days (fastest 9 days)”.\n\n“Egypt sent 150,000 tons of annual grain tribute to Rome in the 1st – 3rd centuries CE. Sailing to Puzzuoli or Ostia took a month or more, and the return voyage 10-20 days.” Baines and Málek (1984), p. 54.\n\nHowever, these figures relate to the ordinary voyages of merchantmen. If the winds were right, a fast ship could make it from Italy to Alexandria in less than six days as Priscus of Panium (5th century CE) reported – refer to Appendix B, subsection (a) Haixi 海西 – literally: ‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt.\n\n11.13. The overall description of the Roman Empire is self-explanatory and quite accurate: “This country (the Roman Empire) has more than four hundred smaller cities and towns. It extends several thousand li in all directions.”\n\n11.14. wangchi 王治 [wang-chih] = ‘the king’s seat of government’ must undoubtedly refer here to the city of Rome, which is situated on the Tiber River some 24 km (15 miles) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\n11.15. 松 song = pine trees, bai 柏 = cypress (a generic name for cypresses, thujas, etc), 槐 huai = Sophora japonica L., 梓 zi = catalpa (Catalpa ovata G. Don.), 竹 zhu = bamboo, 葦 wei = reeds, 楊 yang = poplars, 柳 liu = willows, 梧桐 wutong = the “Chinese parasol” or “phoenix” tree (Firmiana simplex = Sterculia platanifolia). See: Schafer (1963), p. 186.\n\nWhile the name, Wutong [Wu-t’ung], was used to denote other species of trees (especially outside of China), it is of interest to examine some of the significance this name would have had for the Chinese reader:\n\n“The desert poplar (Populus diversifolia), which is also called the unequal-leaved poplar, bears two kinds of leaves at one time; those on the new growth are narrow and lancet-shaped like the willow, while those on the older branches are broad and tooth-edged. The Chinese name for this strange tree is wutung. Hardy as it is, and able to endure both cold and dryness, it is yet the very first tree to feel the touch of autumn, change colour and cast its leaves. For this reason the Chinese have chosen to make the wutung symbolic of sadness, and the eldest son of a family should lean on a staff cut from the wutung when he follows his father’s coffin in the funeral procession. The bark of the tree carries masses of spongy growth called “tears of the wutung,” doubtless because of this association with sorrow. These trees rise to a height of seventy-five feet, and the branches, meeting overhead, form dignified arched alleys. The patches of woodland are as symmetrical as though they had been planted by hand, and the edge is a clear-cut line with no straggling growth.” Cable and French (1943), p. 280.\n\n“Near the camp we reached that night was a clump of wu-t’ung trees, the first I had seen closely, though we had passed a few in the dark on one of the marches through Kuai-tze Hu – their most easterly range, so far as I know it. The caravan men call them “false” wu-t’ung for some reason of their own. The true wu-t’ung is the Dryandra of the upper Yang-tze, the tree from which is obtained wood oil, one of the most valuable exports of Hankow.1 The Dryandra may have been originally a sacred tree of the aborigines of the Yang-tze valley, judging from the legends with which the later-coming Chinese adorned it. They say that the first fall of its leaf is the undeniable beginning of autumn – a fitting symbolism for a holy tree. It is yet more venerable because it is the only tree on which the phoenix will alight when it visits the earth. I have never seen the true wu-t’ung, nor do I know how the “false” wu-t’ung got its name, since I have heard Chinese say that it has not much resemblance to the Dryandra; the caravan men explain very simply that it is false because no phoenixes ever perch on it. The masquerading wu-t’ung is the toghraq or wild poplar of the Tarim desert. It is found throughout the half-deserts and desert fringes of Chinese Turkestan and Zungaria, and also, I am told, in India. One of its peculiarities is that parasitic willow shoots are often found growing in the notches of old trees; another is the great variation in the form of the leaf. On the Edsin Gol the leaf is fairly uniform, but in the Tarim basin it is sometimes very nearly round, with slightly serrated edges, and sometimes almost as deeply indented as a maple leaf, The wood is of no use for any carpentry, and burns rather weakly without giving an intense heat. It is impregnated, apparently, with salts of the deserts where it grows. A plentiful sap or pitch oozes out of it when burning, which is used like soda or yeast to raise bread; the camel men call it “wu-t’ung soda.\n\n1I now find that, according to Giles (Dictionary), the wu-t’ung associated with the phoenix is not the Dryandra but Sterculia platanifolia, while the oil-producing tree also is not Dryandra but Aleurites cordata (t’ung-yu-sha).”\n\nLattimore (1929), pp. 195 and n. 1; 196.\n\n11.16. sangcan 桑蠶 [sang-ts’an].\n\n“This passage can hardly be translated as anything other than, “The customs of the inhabitants are the following: they practice agriculture and plant the five types of cereals; as for domestic animals they have horses, donkeys and camels; they cultivate the mulberry tree and raise silkworms.” But it is evident that Yu Huan, the author of the Weilue, may have come under the influence, unconsciously perhaps, of the more ancient texts which he compiled.” Translated from Chavannes (1907), p. 180, n. 1.\n\nThe term 桑蠶 sangcan [sang-ts’an] is not really as clear-cut as Chavannes states, and the text certainly does not state that they: “cultivate the mulberry tree and raise silkworms” – only that they raise sangcan. The term sangcan is listed by itself immediately after the word 駱驼 luoduo – the normal term for camels.\n\nOn its own like this, sangcan may indeed have meant ‘silkworms,’ but this is not certain – and may not have been the intention here. In the entry under GR No. 9430 we find three definitions: 1. (Entomological) another name for the larvae of the Capricorn beetle, which were used as a medical material. 2. mulberries and silkworms. 3. To feed silkworms with mulberry leaves.\n\nAdditionally, the similar-looking Black Mulberry (Morus nigra L.) tree was native to the Mediterranean region, and may be what is referred to here. They could well have been confused unless they were fruiting, when the large black fruits of the Black Mulberry would have clearly distinguished it from the White Mulberry (Morus alba L.), the leaves of which are used to raise the cultivated silkworm, as it bears white fruits. See the discussion in Hirth (1885), p. 256.\n\n11.17. See the quotes in note 11.2 by Dubs (1957), pp. 2-3, and the translated quote from Saint-Denys (1876), pp. 268-269, in Appendix B, subsection (a) “Haixi 海西 – literally: ‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt.”\n\nThe Shiji chapter 123 – written about 91 BCE – records that when the first envoys from China reached Anxi [Parthia]; “the king sent some of the eggs of the great birds which live in the region [ostriches], and skilled tricksters of Li-hsüan, to the Han court as gifts.” Dubs (1944), p. 277. See also this same event recorded in the Hou Hanshu, Chap. 96A, translated in CICA, p. 117-118.\n\n11.18. This appears to be nothing more than a fabulous story told of an ideal country far-away and is reminiscent of many such stories told by early European travellers to distant lands.\n\n11.19. For an account of these extravagant descriptions of the Roman Empire and its people, see note 11.1.\n\n11.20. This sounds like a sober description of the Parthians’ desire to keep control of and raise taxes on the lucrative trade between China and the Roman Empire. The net result of this policy was, predictably, the development of alternative routes, particularly the route that headed north around the Aral and Caspian Seas to the country of the Alans who had contact with the Romans via Black Sea ports, and the long maritime route from southern Chinese territory (in what is now northern Vietnam) to East Africa and Egypt. Some of this maritime trade could have taken place through the intermediaries of the Roman trading stations or “factories” set up around the Indian coasts and at Oc Eo near the mouth of the Mekong.\n\n11.21. This may well record Chinese surprise at the number of ordinary people who were literate in the Roman Empire. In China, at this time, it was only the privileged elite and government bureaucrats who were able to read and write. This was partly due to the fact that it is easier and quicker to learn an alphabetically-based phonetic form of writing. In addition, Jews (and some of the early Christian groups), insisted that every male learn how to read and write – so they could study the holy scriptures themselves in the original. There was the long Greek tradition of teaching men, in particular, to read and write and this heavily influenced the later Romans to value literacy as well:\n\n“Literacy in Greece was never a craft skill, possessed only by experts, from the start writing was used for a great range of activities, from composing poetry to cursing enemies, from displaying laws to voting, from inscribing tombstones or dedications to writing shopping lists. To be completely illiterate was to be ignorant, uncultured: but our evidence shows that there existed all levels of skill in writing, spelling, and grammar: only a society in which literacy is widespread can offer such a range of evidence from semi-literacy to illiteracy. There is of course no sign that women were expected or encouraged to read, although many of them could. To be cautious, we may say that in a city like Athens well over half the male population could read and write, and that levels of literacy in the Greek cities of the classical and Hellenistic periods were higher that at any period in western culture before this century.” Boardman, Griffin and Murray (1986), pp. 227-228.\n\nAfter the rise of the Roman Empire, it was common for Greek slaves to act as tutors to the sons of well-to-do Roman families.\n\n11.22. Haibei 海北 [Hai-pei], literally: ‘North of the Sea,’ must refer to the lands between Babylonia and what is now Jordan and/or Syria. Refer to Appendix B for details.\n\n11.23. This passage has caused some confusion to modern scholars. A ting 亭 [t'ing] in China was basically a shed or simple lodge for travellers to stop at, which I have called a ‘stage,’ and a zhi 置 [chih] was a ‘postal station’ or inn that could provide shelter, fresh horses, food and supplies.\n\nThe Roman and Parthian systems of postal relays were further developments of the famous Achaemenid system initiated by Darius I circa 515 BCE. The road from Sardis to Susa was 2,475 km in length, and had 111 postal stations [i.e. on average, one every 4 parsangs, or about one every 22 km]. At normal rates of travel, the whole could be covered in 90 days (average speed = 27.5 km/day). However, by changing mounts and couriers, over 350 km could be covered in a day, and messages could be taken the whole length of the route, from Sardis to Susa, in just seven days. From: Ciolek (2000). See also: Dandamayev (1994), p. 52.\n\nIn fact, the Chinese, Parthians, and the Romans all had well-developed systems of postal stations and relays which were quite similar to each other:\n\n“The voyager, having picked a conveyance or riding and pack animals, having loaded up and got under way, next faced the problem of where to stop for the night, and, if he was travelling with hired gear, where to find a change of animals and equipment. As it happened, his choices were often determined by the network of inns and hostels that belonged to the cursus publicus, the government post.\n\nRome’s cursus publicus was created by Augustus, but the idea of such a service was hardly original with him; it is an essential tool for any government that rules extended areas. The earliest examples we know of go back to the third millennium B.C., when the city-states of Mesopotamia first began to build miniature empires. . . . By the third century B.C., China’s Han dynasty and the super-centralized administration that the Ptolemies had set up in Egypt were running the nearest thing to a modern postal system that the ancient world was to know. The carriers were all mounted. In China the post-stations were some eleven miles apart, with two or more substations in between. In Egypt they were sparser, at intervals of six hours by horseback or roughly thirty miles apart. Some records of one of these Egyptian post offices have been dug up by the archaeologists, so we have a fair idea of the way they worked. Thanks to Egypt’s geography, mail had to go only north and south, along the ribbon of inhabited land bordering the Nile. The offices handled at least four deliveries daily, two from each direction. For packages and other heavier matter there was an auxiliary camel-back service.\n\nWhen Augustus conquered and annexed Egypt in 30 B.C., the system was right at hand to serve as a model. He, however, was interested neither in speed nor regular delivery. What he sought was a facility which would forward dispatches when necessary and permit him to interrogate the carriers as well as read the papers they brought. So he fashioned a service in which there were no relays: each messenger went himself the whole route, and since time was not of the essence, travelled in carriages rather than on horseback. As the system developed, the couriers were more and more drawn from the army, especially from the elite unit called speculatores ‘scouts’; instead of scouting the situation of an enemy, they scouted, as it were, the situation at the headquarters they were delivering to. . . .\n\nIn Egypt the Romans may well have maintained the Ptolemies’ mail service, since it was so feasible a system there. But everywhere else the Roman post operated as Augustus had designed it, making sporadic deliveries according to need – or rather the emperor’s need, since officially only men carrying dispatches from him or for him were entitled to the privileges of the cursus publicus. Every user had to have a diploma, as a post warrant was called, signed by the emperor or, in his absence, his authorized agent; governors of provinces could also issue them, but they disposed of a limited number only, rationed out by the emperor. A diploma, entitling one to travel with the use of government maintained facilities, was a prized possession, and inevitably some fell into hands which did not deserve them. . . .\n\n. . . . All along the routes at strategic intervals were more or less well-equipped inns called mansiones or stationes; the first term originally applied to places with the facilities to handle an imperial party, the second to posts maintained by the road police, but by this time the two had gradually merged. In between the mansiones or stationes were very simple hostels, mutationes ‘changing places’ as they were sometimes called, which could supply the minimum of a traveller’s needs – a bite to eat, a bed, and, as the name implies, a change of beasts or vehicle. The distance from one mansio to the next depended on the terrain and how thickly an area was populated, but in general an effort was made to keep them twenty-five to thirty-five miles apart, that is, the length of an average day’s travel. In densely settled districts, such as around the capital, they tended to be a good deal closer. There might be one or two hostels between a pair of mansiones, again depending on the terrain. . . .\n\nThe inns and hostels of the cursus publicus were not built specifically for it, nor did they service only those travelling on official business, although these had an ironclad priority. The post, despite the fact that it was run wholly for the benefit of the central government, was largely maintained by the communities along the routes. The emperors simply selected given existing inns of the required quality and incorporated them into the system, requiring them to put up without charge any holder of a diploma who came along. Only in remote areas, as on mountain passes or along lonely tracts of road, did they have to build from scratch. . . ; such places, too, to help meet expenses put up all voyagers, private as well as official. Vehicles, animals, drivers, stablehands – all were requisitioned, wherever possible, from local citizens.” Casson (1974), pp. 182-186.\n\n“As it happens, the Romans were not the only skilled road-builders of antiquity. On the other side of the world the powerful lords of the Han dynasty of China (c. 200 B.C. – A.D. 200) ruled an equally farflung empire, which they too knit together by means of a comprehensive system of highways. Their engineers, like Rome’s, laid the tracks as straight as possible, cutting through forests and bridging streams, and even outdid Rome’s when it came to hacking out roads in dizzying heights. They went in for greater width than Rome; fifty feet is mentioned for major routes, wide enough for nine chariots abreast. We cannot confirm the figure since the Chinese never used paving – gravel surfaces satisfied their needs – and accordingly hardly a trace of their ancient roads has survived. We have only contemporary or near contemporary descriptions to go on, and these cannot always be taken as gospel truth.” Casson, (1974), p. 174.\n\n11.24. The report that there were no bandits or thieves along the roads in the Roman Empire is probably an accurate reflection of the effectiveness of Roman policing and severe application of the law within their territories. However, dangerous wild animals were common – to a degree it is hard to imagine these days.\n\nHerodotus (5th century BCE) informs us that in the time of Xerxes’ invasion of Greece in 480 BCE, lions were still a danger to caravans in the eastern parts of Greece:\n\n“This road which led him [Xerxes] through Paeonia and Crestonia to the river Echeidorus, which rising in the country of the Crestonians, flows through Mydonia, and reaches the sea near the marsh upon the Axius.\n\nUpon this march the camels that carried the provisions of the army were set upon by lions, which left their lairs and came down by night, but spared the men and sumpter-beasts, while they made the camels their prey. I marvel what may have been the cause which compelled the lions to leave the other animals untouched and attack the camels, when they had never seen that beast before, nor had any experience of it.\n\nThat whole region is full of lions, and wild bulls with gigantic horns which are brought into Greece. The lions are confined within the tract lying between the river Nestus (which flows through Abdera) on the one side, and the Acheloüs (which waters Acarnania) on the other. No one ever sees a lion in the fore part of Europe east of the Nestus [which divides Greek Macedonia and Thrace], nor through the entire continent west of the Acheloüs [which empties into the Ionian Sea near the southwest corner of mainland Greece]; but in the space between these bounds lions are found.” Herodotus (VII, 124-126), 1996 edition, p. 556.\n\n“Game was plentiful: lions existed in the Euphrates valley until the middle of the nineteenth century. . . . ” Fedden (1955), p. 134.\n\n“From the writings of the ancient historians it appears very clear that Lions were at one time found in Europe, but they have long since totally disappeared. They are also no longer seen in Egypt, Palestine or Syria, where they once were evidently far from uncommon ; and, as Cuvier remarks, even in Asia generally, with the exception of some countries between India and Persia, and some districts of Arabia, they have become comparatively rare. . . . How different it was in the time of the Romans! Struck with the magnificent appearance of these animals, they imported them in vast numbers from Africa, for their public spectacles.” Maunder (1878), p. 382.\n\n11.25. For the translation of wangsuozhi cheng 王所治城 as ‘the king’s administrative capital’ – refer to the section titled: “About Measurements and Administrative Divisions,” at the end of the Introduction.\n\nFor the circumference of Rome to have equalled 42 km, outlying suburbs must have been included. The greatest extent of the walled area of Rome was enclosed by the brick-faced concrete walls built by Aurelian in 270 CE. These were almost 12 miles (19 km) around and enclose an area of approximately 60 sq. kms. Many suburbs were, however, outside the walls.\n\nThe population of Rome by the late 1st to early 2nd centuries has been estimated to be over a million people. The population began to decline rapidly during the plagues of the second century:\n\n“Forty years later [after the ‘plague of Orosius in 125] there followed the plague of Antoninus, sometimes known as the plague of the physician Galen. The story is better documented than that of previous outbreaks. Disease started among the troops of the co-emperor Lucius Verus on the eastern borders of the empire. It was confined to the east for the two years 164-6 and caused great mortality among the legions under the command of Avidius Claudius, who had been sent to repress a revolt in Syria. The plague accompanied this army homewards, spreading throughout the countryside and reaching Rome in A.D. 166. It rapidly extended into all parts of the known world, causing so many deaths that loads of corpses were carried away from Rome and other cities in carts and wagons.\n\nThe plague of Antoninus or Galen, is notable because it caused the first crack in the Roman defence lines. Until A.D.161 the empire continually expanded and maintained its frontiers. In that year a Germanic barbarian horde, the Marcomanni from Bohemia and the Quadi from Moravia, forced the north-eastern barrier of Italy. Owing to the fear and disorganization produced by the plague, full-scale retaliation could not be undertaken; not until A.D.169 was the whole weight of Roman arms thrown against the Marcomanni. Possibly the failure of this invasion was as much due to the legions carrying plague with them as to their fighting prowess, for many Germans were found lying dead on the battlefield without sign of wounding. The pestilence raged until A.D. 180; one of the last victims was the noblest of Roman emperors, Marcus Aurelius. He died on the seventh day of his illness and is said to have refused to see his son at the last, fearing lest he, too, should succumb. After A.D.180 there came a short respite followed by a return in 189. The spread of this second epidemic seems to have been less wide, but mortality in Rome was ghastly; as many as 2,000 sometimes died in a single day.\n\nThe name of the physician Galen is attached to the plague of A.D. 164-89 not only because he fled from it, but because he left a description of the disease. Initial symptoms were high fever, inflammation of the mouth and throat, parching thirst and diarrhoea. Galen described a skin eruption, appearing about the ninth day, sometimes dry and sometimes pustular. He implies that many patients died before the eruption appeared. There is some resemblance to the Athenian plague, but the undoubted Eastern origin and the mention of pustules have led many historians to assert that this was the first instance of a smallpox epidemic. One theory holds that the westward movement of the Huns started because of virulent smallpox in Mongolia; the disease travelled with them, was communicated to the Germanic tribes upon whom the Huns were pressing and, in turn, infected the Romans who were in contact with the Germans. Against this theory must be set the fact that the later history of the Roman outbreak in no way resembles the later history of European smallpox in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. But, as we shall see in some of the following chapters, the first appearance of a disease often takes a form and a course which is quite different from that of the disease once established.\n\nAfter A.D. 189, plague is not again mentioned until the year 250. . . . ” Cartwright and Biddiss (1972), pp. 12-14.\n\n11.26. The title used here is jiang 將 [chiang], which is commonly translated as ‘general.’ However, it sometimes had a less militaristic meaning. Hucker, No. 690 includes: “(3) HAN: Leader of the expectant and unassigned officials who attended the Emperor as courtiers with the title Court Gentleman (lang).”\n\nHere, the mention of the “thirty-six leaders” seems probably to be a reference to the consuls:\n\n“Lastly, though Augustus did not form a Privy Council after the pattern of the Hellenistic monarchies, he laid the foundations of such a body. In 27 B.C. he instituted a committee of the Senate, consisting of the two consuls, of one representative apiece from each of the other colleges of magistrates, and of fifteen private members selected by lot, for a period of six months, to prepare the agenda and expedite the business of the whole House. In A.D.13 he reinforced this committee with members of the imperial family and additional nominated members of the equestrian order, and he carried out its recommendations without submitting them to the Senate for confirmation. In addition to this regularly constituted committee, Augustus also convened from time to time informal consilia of assessors in judicial cases, according to the ordinary custom of the republican magistrates. From these two sources the formal Consilium Principis was eventually derived.” Cary (1954), pp. 481-482.\n\n“The reign of Hadrian also marks an important stage in the history of Roman law. Under this emperor the annual edicts of the Praetors charged with civil jurisdiction at Rome, and presumably also the edicts of the provincial governors, were cast into final shape by a distinguished jurist named Salvius Iulianus. Henceforward the function of interpreting and expanding Roman law devolved mainly upon the Consilium Principis, to which the chief jurists of the day were regularly invited for consultation on judicial matters.” Cary (1954), p. 634.\n\nI have not been able to confirm the existence of any body that had exactly thirty-six members or, if it did, at what time. It seems the largest number of consuls (25) existed under Commodus’ rule about 190 CE. They may have be joined by the consilium princeps, a council of usually five (but, perhaps, at times, more) men who advised the consul on civic improvements and laws that affected the Empire.\n\n11.27. This seems to be another example of exaggerated travellers’ tales – an idealistic account of an exotic foreign civilisation. It may also be an embellished reference to the appeal process under the law afforded to Roman citizens.\n\n11.28. The Romans were justly famous for their magnificent glassware. The term used here is shui-ching (crystal or clear glass). The Chinese at this period apparently did not know how to make transparent glass so rock crystal and clear glass were often confused. Glass must be what is meant here. See also note 12.12 (30). Furthermore, the idea that the pillars of the palaces were made of glass is not as fanciful as it first sounds:\n\n“Fused mosaic glass of marble-like or figural patterns was employed, for instance, to adorn the surfaces of walls and furniture. When Pliny describes the Theatre of Scaurus, built in 58 B.C. – where the second story of the stage building was faced with glass – he is probably alluding to mosaic glass made to imitate the swirling grains of marble (Natural History XXXV.24). Mosaic glass in bold patterns seems to have been used throughout the Empire period to decorate walls. Figural inlays of mosaic glass also decorated walls and furnishings.\n\nColorful opaque inlays for opus sectile mosaic were created from pre-formed shapes fitted together. Glass also came to be used in place of marble for tessera mosaics laid on floors, walls, and vaulted ceilings. The advantage of glass tesserae over marble one rested primarily with their consistently glittery quality and their range of colors, which could be produced on demand. According to Pliny, glass mosaic for walls and ceilings was introduced at Rome in the late first century B.C. The myriad uses made of opaque and colorful glass notwithstanding, clear glass was the most frequently admired in the world of Rome. In Pliny’s words:\n\n. . . there is no other material nowadays that is more pliable or more adaptable, even to painting. However, the most highly valued glass is colorless and transparent. . . (Pliny, d. CE 79, Natural History XXXVI.66).”\n\nFrom: Root, et al. (1982).\n\n“Thanks to the discovery of glass-blowing in the Syro-Palestinian region during the first century B.C., glass vessels became commonplace throughout the empire by the first century A.D. and from time to time were exported to places as far afield as Scandinavia and the Far East.\n\n. . . . Augustan Rome was a rich city with a population that probably approached one million. Italy had other large cities, too, and the demand for manufactured items, including glass, was enormous. Glassmaking quickly became established, and blowing came into its own as the only technique that made large-scale glass production practicable.\n\nAt the same time, glass became fashionable. Although lacking the intrinsic value of rock crystal and precious metal, it is attractive and, while some looked down on glass because it was cheap, others admired it. . . . The Romans’ ambivalence about glass is neatly summed up in Petronius’ Satyricon, where Trimalchio, the quintessential parvenu, remarks to his guests at dinner, “You will excuse me for what I am about to say: I prefer glass vessels. Certainly, they don’t smell and, if they weren’t so fragile, I would prefer them to gold. These days, however, they are cheap.” As Timalchio observed, glass vessels do not impart a taste or smell to substances they contain, and for this reason they were frequently used for food, perfumes, and medicines; indeed, the physician Scribonius Largus (active about A.D. 50) insisted that certain medical preparations should only be kept in glass containers.\n\nGlass was used at all stages in the preparation and consumption of food. Although the very rich would eat from gold and silver plates, many more used glass vessels for serving food, for drinking, and for washing hands between courses. Indeed, Propertius (died ca. 2 B.C.) reported that glass services were used instead of metal ones for drinking or dining in summer, and Seneca (died ca. A.D. 65) maintained that fruit appears more beautiful when it is in a glass vessel. At his absurdly lavish dinner party, Trimalchio served rare, vintage wines in glass amphorae. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, various foods and condiments, such as garum, a popular fish sauce, were stored in glass bottles and jars. In his treatise on agriculture (written ca. A.D. 60-65), Columella recommended using glass jars for preserving pickles. The jars should have vertical sides, he wrote, so that the contents can be compressed. Glass containers not only preserved the flavor, but also had the advantage (in a society with a high level of illiteracy) of allowing one to see the contents without removing the cover.” Whitehouse (1997), pp. 79-81.\n\n“The Sanskrit word vaiḍūra, which means lapis lazuli, beryl or cat’s-eye gem, is the origin of liu-li. Before Buddhism spread to China, the Chinese name for lapis lazuli, a precious stone from the north-west, was miu-lan. From the Han to the Northern dynasties miu-lan and liu-li came to be interchangeable terms for a few kinds of precious stones. . . .\n\nThe word po-li underwent the same kind of transition [as liu-li]. The Sanskrit word sphāṭika, phalika in Pali, meaning crystal or quartz, is related to po-li. In the early Chinese context po-li and crystal (shui-ching) were synonyms (Chang Hung-chao 1921: 43). However, imported fake crystal enabled a few Chinese to realize that both po-li and the so-called crystal were man-made materials. Ke Hung (AD 284-386) pointed out that the imported ‘crystal vessels’ were actually made by mixing five kinds of minerals. He also ridiculed the ‘ignorant people’ who believed that the ‘crystal’ was a kind of natural precious stone like jade (Pao-p’u-tsu Nei-p’ien: II, 21). Because, by the third and the fourth centuries, most buyers did not distinguish between po-li and crystal, the two terms came to mean either rock crystal or transparent glass.\n\nDuring the period when the ancient Chinese imported po-li or liu-li they also continued to make their own glass, probably in order to imitate jade. The Later Han scholar Wang Ch’ung describes man-made jade thus: ‘The jade made out of melted jade-like stones is as brilliant as real jade’ (Yang Po-ta 1979: 77). The major characteristic of Chinese glass, as analysed by P. D. Ritchie, is the high proportion of lead, and in some samples, barium (1937). It contains much less silicon, the major element of modern glass, than does the glass from Egypt and other ancient countries. The high lead content resulted in a lower melting point and the greater fragility of the glass. Barium and other elements made it opaque. Wang Ch’ung made his comments in the period when the Chinese continued to make this opaque fragile glass long after they had seen the transparent glass vessels from foreign countries, they apparently did not understand that both their opaque material and the transparent glass shared similar chemical components and thus belonged to the same category of glass, at least as classified by modern glass experts. When the author of the history of the Northern Wei records that a merchant from the Yüeh-chih taught the Chinese how to make liu-li (WS: CII, 2275), he does not consider the jade-like materials long produced in China to be liu-li.\n\nThe distinction between liu-li and po-li is not always clear outside Buddhist literature. The category liu-li includes transparent or translucent glass, which was a treasure for the emperors and other élite. In the legends about the Former Han Emperor Wu, liu-li was one of the treasures in his ‘Exotic Jewels Palace’, and the screen of another palace was made of ‘white liu-li’ – which can mean either white or transparent glass (Lu Hsün 1939: 347-9). In the Chin period, a minister, Wang Chi, who was considered extremely generous and extravagant, entertained Emperor Wu with po-li utensils (CS: XLII, 1206). An anecdote of Chin times records a comment on a liu-li vessel: ‘Why is this empty vessel a jewel? Because it is clear and transparent’ (Shih-shuo-hsin-yü: XXV, 595). What the owners actually treasured was the transparency of a glass vessel, be it called po-li, liu-li or crystal [shui-ching].\n\nChinese élites were not alone in yearning for the transparent material. Pliny complains that crystal was a ‘crazy addition as a symbol of wealth and prestige’ in Rome (XXXVII 10). He says that Indian crystal was the most preferred (XXXVII 9). When the Indians exported crystal to the Roman empire some genuine crystal was probably also transported to China. Pliny’s time also saw a rapid development of glass-making in the West. He says that the glass-ware of his days closely resembles rock-crystal (XXXVII 10, XXXVI, 67). A few centuries later in China, the most extravagant prince Yüan Chen in the Northern Wei boasted of a few dozen crystal plates and bowls, glass (liu-li) vessels and red-jade cups. All of these vessels came from the Western Region (YHC: IV, 207). These ‘crystal plates and bowls’ were very likely transparent glass, as Ke Hung had pointed out two centuries earlier. . . .\n\nFrom the Han period on the Chinese viewed both the Roman empire and India as producers of liu-li. The official history of the Former Han described liu-li as a product of Chi-pin in the Kashmir region [sic – refer to Appendix K](HS: XCVI, 3885). At that time liu-li still mainly denoted lapis lazuli, whose origin was not far from Kashmir. By the time that the Later Han history identified the Roman empire as the origin of liu-li (HS: LXXXVIII, 2917) the word liu-li had come to mean glass. Later historians followed this tradition of viewing liu-li as of Roman origin until the Northern Wei History, when Yüeh-chih merchants, probably citizens of the small state surviving from the Kushan empire, are credited with the introduction of glass-making techniques.\n\nLike China, India began to produce glass much later than Egypt and Mesopotamia, but unlike China it produced good-quality glass very early. Very few samples from Taxila, Nalanda, Ahicchatra, Arikamedu and other sites show traces of lead, and none of them show any barium (B. B. Lal 1952). This feature enabled Indian workers to make transparent and clear glassware. Pliny referred to glass from India as being of good quality (XXXVI, 66; Schoff 1912: 220). Moreover, Roman traders brought flint glass to Barygaza (Periplus: 49). Indian workers must have been familiar with the technology of processing glass. The early Christian era witnessed the best period of glass production in ancient Indian history (Dikshit 1969: 25). However, Indian workers in the Kushan period do not seem to have been familiar with glass-blowing techniques. Most glass vessels found in Taxila were foreign imports, the local products being limited to moulded objects such as seals and beads (Dikshit 1969: 81ff.) Glass tiles in Taxila reveal that Indians were skilful at moulding large pieces of glass (B. B. Lal 1952: 22).” Liu (1988), pp. 58-62. See also: Stern (1991), pp. 113-124.\n\n“Among the products of Nature, the most expensive... on the earth’s surface, it is rock-crystal...” Pliny NH (a), p. 377 (bk. XXXVII, chap. 204).\n\n11.29. 澤散 Zesan [Tse-san] – Azania in East Africa. See note 15.1.\n\n11.30. 驢分 Lüfen [Lü-fen] = Al Wajh on the east coast of the Red Sea?

The term can refer to any ‘linen’ but in China usually referred to dolichos or hemp cloth. Here, in the Roman context, though, it undoubtedly referred to linen from flax – a major product of the Empire.\n\n“Egypt, which had long been a big supplier of wheat, linen, and building stones, and the sole provider of papyrus and mosaic glass, now became [under the Julian-Claudian emperors, AD 14-68] the great entrepôt for Rome’s African and Asian trade. This hinged upon Alexandria, a city of about 500,000 inhabitants [the second largest in the Roman Empire], and a great processing as well as a great trading centre. Its linen industry made special cloths for the Asian trade, and its weavers also worked on Indian cottons and Chinese silks.” Simkin (1968), p. 38.\n\n“Chinese silk, moreover, is mentioned only twice [in Diocletian’s famous Edict of 301 CE]; white silk at 12,000 denarii a pound, against 1,200 for the best linen yarn. . . . ” Simkin (1968), p. 47.\n\n“The ancient world’s writing paper was either papyrus or parchment; papyrus was cheaper, practically all of it came [during the time of the Ptolemies] from Egypt, and its manufacture and sale belonged to the crown. So too did the textile industry, which, using native flax, produced for export not only fine fabrics but very likely much of the linen that went into sailcloth.” Casson (1959), p. 159.\n\n“Originally a pleated robe was the mark of haute couture. Then the robe with a spotted pattern became démodé. Fenestella writes that the togas of Phyrgian wool with a smooth surface began to be in vogue in the last years of the late Emperor Augustus. Togas closely woven with poppy fibres go back further, and are already alluded to by the poet Lucilius in the case of Torquatus. The toga with a purple border had its origin in Etruria. I understand that kings used robes of state. Embroidered robes were already in existence in Homer’s time and are the origin of those worn at triumphs.” Pliny the Elder (1991), pp. 125-126 (NH VIII.195).\n\n12.2. The Roman exchange rate in the 3rd century Weilue of gold to silver at 1 : 10 is very close to the 1 : 11 ratio of Pliny’s time (c. 77 CE):\n\n“Pliny, a well-informed adviser of Vespasian (A.D. 69-79), reckoned that each year Indian trade drained Rome of 12,500,000 denarii and that the Arabian and Chinese trade together of at least another 12,500,000 denarii. The denarius was a silver coin – perhaps it was helpful that Rome preferred silver to gold while India had the opposite preference – and in Pliny’s day had a content of 3.1-3.3 grams. The aureus had a gold content of 7.3 grams so that, as an aureus was worth 25 denarii [and, therefore, Rome was exporting the equivalent of 7,300 kg of gold each year], the two metals had an exchange ratio of 1 :11. . . .\n\nBy modern standards this is not a large drain for a great empire, but it was substantial for the Ancient World as a few comparisons may indicate. It has been estimated that, between 200 and 150 B.C., the Roman Republic obtained 261,000,000 denarii as booty or indemnities from the Mediterranean conquests, Gaul, Asia, and Spain’s gold mines, the chief western source. This works out at 50,000,000 denarii a year, twice Pliny’s estimate of the annual loss to Asia. The Emperor Tiberius, moreover, a frugal man, left his successor only 750,000 denarii. In China, the usurping Emperor Wang Mang, by A.D. 23, had accumulated a gold treasure of 156,200 kilograms and so equivalent to 540,000,000 denarii, or about twenty-two times Pliny’s estimate.\n\nThe crucial question, of course, is the relation of Rome’s gold drain to its Asian imports. Rostovtzeff held that ‘the goods of the east were paid for, without doubt, partly with silver and gold coins, as Pliny says, but mostly by goods produced in the empire, especially in Alexandria’. No evidence is adduced for this view but it is, perhaps, supported by the apparent success Vespasian had in halting the outflow of coins to India. Although, too, the Periplus refers to ‘a great quantity of coin’ being sent to South India, and a profitable exchange for gold and silver at Barygaza, it does not mention significant exports of coin to other ports of the Erythraean Sea and lists many exports from Rome or Egypt. . . . ” Simkin (1968), pp. 45-46.\n\n“It was later decided to strike denarii at 40 to the pound of gold and the emperors gradually reduced the weight of the gold denarius; most recently Nero devalued it to 45 denarii to the pound.” Pliny NH (a), p. 293 (bk. XXXII, chap. 47).\n\nTo follow these quotes it should be pointed out that 25 silver denarii equalled one gold denarius. Also, one Roman pound equalled 327.25 grams.\n\nThus, from the latter quote of Pliny’s it can be calculated that the Roman gold to silver standard had been 10 : 1 and was gradually reduced. By the time of Nero it was about 1 : 11. However, it may have been raised again after Nero’s time. According to Prasad (1977), p. 174:\n\n“in Plato’s and Xenophon’s time and more than 100 years after the death of Alexander 10 : 1.” This, apparently, continued for some time, probably into the period covered by the Weilue: “The relative value of silver and gold was 10 : 1 which continued for a long time. It was an international relative value. Ancient India by establishing the Mana standard of exchange currency internationalised the relative value at 10 : 1.”\n\nFor the trade of Roman coins to India see also: Lebedeva (1988); Sherkova (1990); Nagaswami (1995), pp. 21-27; Ray (2003), esp. pp. 181, 210-213.\n\n12.3. ‘Sea wool’ or ‘silk’. There are two early references to shuiyang 水羊 – literally, ‘water-sheep,’ in Chinese literature that have caused considerable confusion for many years. It appears that it referred to the very rare byssus or thread like filaments produced by the large Pinna nobilis shell found in the Mediterranean. These shells produced an extremely fine, yet strong and beautiful silky fibre. Refer to Appendix D.\n\n12.4. ye jiansi 野繭絲 – “silk from wild cocoons.” For a full description of the use of wild silks in the Roman Empire, refer to Appendix E.\n\n12.5. Haidong – ‘East of the Sea’ = Persis, and other lands to the east of the Persian Gulf. Refer to Appendix B.\n\n12.6. The Chinese terms for the silks in this passage are: 絲 szu – silk thread; a general word for silks; and 綾 ling – damask or twilled silk = Sogdian parang (pr’ynk, pryng) – Kageyama (2003). See note 12.12 (46).\n\n“It has been supposed that the Greeks learned of silk through Alexander’s expedition, but it probably reached them previously through Persia. Aristotle (Hist. Anim., V, xix, 11) [4th century BCE] gives a reasonably correct account: “It is a great worm which has horns and so differs from others. At its first metamorphosis it produces a caterpillar, then a bombylius, and lastly a chrysalis – all these changes taking place within six months. From this animal women separate and reel off the cocoons and afterwards spin them. It is said that this was first spun in the island of Cos by Pamphile, daughter of Plates.” This indicates a steady importation of raw silk on bobbins before Aristotle’s time. The fabric he mentions was the famous Cos vestis, or transparent gauze (woven also at Tyre and elsewhere in Syria), which came into favour in the time of Cæsar and Augustus. Pliny mentions Pamphile of Cos, “who discovered the art of unwinding the silk” (from the bobbins, not from the cocoons) “and spinning a tissue therefrom; indeed, she ought not to be deprived of the glory of having discovered the art of making garments which, while they cover a woman, at the same time reveal her naked charms.” (XI, 26). He refers to the same fabric again in VI, 20, “the Seres, so famous for the wool [= silk floss. See: Casson (1989), pp. 238-239] that is found in their forests. After steeping it in water, they comb off a soft down that adheres to the leaves; and then to the females of our part of the world they give the twofold task of unravelling their textures, and of weaving the threads afresh. So manifold is the labor, and so distant are the regions which are thus ransacked to supply a dress through which our ladies may in public display their charms.” Compare Lucan, Pharsalia, X, 141, who describes Cleopatra, “her white breasts resplendent through the Sidonian fabric, which, wrought in close texture by the skill of the Seres, the needle of the workman of the Nile has separated, and has loosened the warp by stretching out the web.”\n\nSilk fabrics of this kind were much affected by men also during the reign of Augustus, but this fashion was considered effeminate, and early in the reign of Tiberius the Roman Senate enacted a law “that men should not defile themselves by wearing garments of silk.” (Tacitus, Annals, II, 33) the cost was enormously high; from an account of the Emperor Aurelian we learn that silk was worth its weight in gold, and that he neither used it himself nor allowed his wife to possess a garment of it, thereby setting an example against the luxurious tastes that were draining the empire of its resources.” Schoff (1912), pp. 264-265.\n\nIt seems that quite early in the silk trade from China to the Mediterranean, the silks were taken to Sidon and Tyre to be dyed and a method was found to reweave the thick Chinese cloths into transparent gauzes. It is of great interest to find descriptions of this process corroborated in both the Roman and the Chinese sources. These dyed silk gauzes soon became fashionable.\n\nMa Duanlin [Ma Tuan-lin] in his Wenxiantongkao [Wên-hsien-t’ung-k’ao], ch. 330 has a rather similar passage to the one in the Weilue but gives more details:\n\n“They [people from Ta Ch’in] make all kinds of rugs [Chü-sou, T’a-têng, Chi-chang, etc.]; their colours are still more brilliant than are those manufactured in the countries on the east of the sea. They always made profit by obtaining the thick plain silk stuffs of China, which they split in order to make foreign ling kan wên [lingganwen 綾绀紋 = ‘purple patterned damask’], and they entertained a lively trade with the foreign states of An-hsi [Parthia] by sea.” Ma Duanlin [Ma Tuan-lin], quoted in: Hirth (1885), pp. 80-81.\n\nProcopius, writing about 500 CE said:\n\n“The manufacture of silken garments had for many generations been a staple industry of Beirut and Tyre, two cities of Phoenicia. The merchants who handled these and the skilled and semi-skilled workmen who produced them had lived there from time immemorial, and their wares were carried from there into every land.” Williamson (1966), pp. 115-116.\n\n“In Parthian times, some of the high officials of both Palestinian and Babylonian Jewry participated in the international silk trade. The Babylonians included Ḥiyya the Elder, Abba the father of Samuel, Judah b. Bathyra of Nisibis, and others; the first named was probably related to, and a Palestinian representative of, the Babylonian exilarch (see below). Among the Palestinians was R. Simeon the son of R. Judah. Babylonia was the western entrepôt of silk from China; the thread was woven and manufactured into clothing for the Roman market in Palestine and Syria. Jews, represented on both sides of the frontier, were in a favourable position to profit from the trade. So, in particular, were the representatives of the Jewish administrations established by the respective imperial régimes. Since the silk trade was closely supervised by the Parthian government, it stands to reason that the Jewish participants were encouraged by the government, which found them an efficient means of carrying on the international exchange.” Neusner (1983), pp. 912-913.\n\n“The Chinese trade differed from the Indian trade mainly in that the bulk of its material consisted in silk textures which, before they were thrown on the Roman market, had to undergo the process of dyeing, chiefly purple dyeing, at Tyre or Sidon, or that of being woven (rewoven?) at Berytus or Tyre. The next route from the Red Sea to the manufacturing towns of the Phœnician coast, however, did not lead through Egypt, but through the country of the Nabataeans.” Hirth (1885), pp. 158-159.\n\n“Towards the other extremity of the line of commerce, at Palmyra, some woolen cloths and Chinese silks found in tombs and having, perhaps, served as shrouds, present similarities of style and technique with fragments of material from Lou-lan, in the eastern region of Lop-nor, likewise found by Aurel Stein. An exchange of professional knowledge had been able to take place between the two races of weavers. Fabrics of monochrome silk with a damask weave have been found at Palmyra which Mr. Pfister calls the Han weave. It produces a thick material, as it has two faces; on one side it shows the pattern of damask; on the other it has the appearance of a taffeta, which serves to stiffen it (the specialists pronounce taffeta or linen cloth the simplest fabric to weave, the warp and the weft are mixed together like in darning; this is the most rudimentary technique). The combination of these two weaves into one represents quite an advanced art of weaving, which is attributed to the Chinese. These materials, damasked according to the Han weave, had a scintillating appearance. The Parthian standards of the battle of Carrhae [53 B.C.], to which history has definitely attributed a heavy responsibility, were probably made of Chinese damask.\n\nIt was the taste for light weaves which caused the abandonment of these heavy silks, even though in the 2nd and 3rd centuries Chinese silk had become abundant. A Palmyrene material has been found from the 2nd century – it has a woolen weft dyed with cochineal, an expensive dye (yet less than the prohibitively priced purple) on a weft of Chinese silk, almost invisible, dyed with madder, which colours cheaply. The silk served only as a base like the coarse canvas of a beautiful tapestry, and it was the damask wool that was shown.” Translated from: Boulnois (1992), pp. 147-148.\n\n“A piece of crimson damask with a rhombic design was recovered from one of the 2nd century B.C. tombs excavated at Mawangtui, Changsha, Hunan Province: A Damask is a monochrome fabric made by the use of the drawloom. The background is woven by plain weave, while the decorative patterns appear as twill weave with warp threads three up and one down. . . . ” Anonymous, 1976: note 56.\n\n“Similarly, the use of other prohibited textiles [for the Buddhist clergy] such as silk obtained from the silk-worm (koseyya) is also associated with the Chhabbagiyas [“or ‘Group of Six,’ who were prone to the emulation of an elite lifestyle”], as is the use of silk-mixed woollen rugs and wrappers. The Buddha is shown as reluctantly accepting gifts of expensive silk and woollen shawls imported from the Sibi country in the north-west (Vinaya Piṭaka I: 281). This association of expensive and fine textiles with elite status is evident in descriptions of the nāgaraka or urban elite in Sanskrit literature. The Mandasor inscription refers to women wearing two garments of silk on special occasions, while Kalidasa describes weddings where both the bride and the groom were attired in expensive fabrics termed dukūla and identified as silk (Kumārasambhava VII: 7, 26, 73; Raghuvaṁśa VII: 18, 19).” Ray (2003), p. 221.\n\n“Another use of textiles was as a medium of exchange. The Kharoshthi inscriptions from Central Asia dated to around the fourth century indicate that silk was used as a payment in transactions, and even render the price of a woman as equivalent to forty-one bolts of silk (Burrow 1940: 27,95). Similarly, there is mention of Buddhist monasteries fining monks in silk.” Ray (2003), p. 227.\n\n12.7. These “nine-coloured jewels” are almost certainly fluorite (calcium fluoride - also known as fluorspar). It not only comes in more colour varieties than any gem other than quartz, but it also exhibits fluorescence, phosphorescence and thermoluminescence.\n\nThe reference to them being of “inferior” or “second-rate” quality stems, I would imagine from the fact that fluorite is relatively soft and is easy to scratch or damage (unlike jade).\n\nInterestingly, the colours attributed to it in our text (blue, carnation red, yellow, white, black, green, purple, red, dark blue) closely approximate the following modern description (which also lists nine distinct colours):\n\n“Fluorite is a mineral with a veritable bouquet of colors. Fluorite is well known and prized for its glassy lustre and rich varieties of colors. The range of common colors for fluorite starting from the hallmark color purple, then blue, green, yellow, colorless, brown, pink, black and reddish orange is amazing and only rivaled in color range by quartz. Intermediate pastels between the previously mentioned colors are also possible. It is easy to see why fluorite earns the reputation as “The Most Colorful Mineral in the World”. . . .\n\nMost specimens of fluorite have a single color, but a significant percentage of fluorites have multiple colors and the colors are arranged in bands or zones that correspond to the shapes of the fluorite’s crystals. In other words, the typical habit of fluorite is a cube and the color zones are often in a cubic arrangement. The effect is similar to phantomed crystals that appear to have crystals within crystals that are of differing colors. A fluorite crystal could have a clear outer zone allowing a cube of purple fluorite to be seen inside. Sometimes the less common habits such as a colored octahedron are seen inside of a colorless cube. One crystal of fluorite could potentially have four or five different color zones or bands.\n\nTo top it all off, fluorite is frequently fluorescent and, like its normal light colors, its fluorescent colors are extremely variable. Typically it fluoresces blue but other fluorescent colors include yellow, green, red, white and purple. Some specimens have the added effect of simultaneously having a different color under longwave UV light from its color under shortwave UV light. And some will even demonstrate phosphorescence in a third color! . . . .\n\nAnother unique luminescent property of fluorite is thermoluminescence. Thermoluminescence is the ability to glow when heated. Not all fluorites do this, in fact it is quite a rare phenomenon. A variety of fluorite known as “chlorophane” can demonstrate this property very well and will even thermoluminesce while the specimen is being held in a person’s hand activated by the person’s own body heat (of course in a dark room, as it is not bright enough to be seen in daylight). The thermoluminescence is green to blue-green and can be produced on the coils of a heater or electric stove top. Once seen, the glow will fade away and can no longer be seen in the same specimen again.” Amethyst Galleries Inc. (2000).\n\nFluorite was considered a luxury item in the Roman Empire as this account from Pliny makes clear:\n\n“That same victory [over Mithradates IV of Pontus, in eastern Anatolia in 63 BCE] first brought myrrhine ware to Rome. Pompey was the first to dedicate fluorspar bowls and cups from his triumph to Capitoline Jupiter. Vessels of fluorspar immediately passed into everyday use, and even display stands and tableware were eagerly sought. This kind of extravagance increases daily. An ex-consul drank from a fluorspar cup for which he had paid 70,000 sesterces, although it only held 3 pints. He was so enamoured of it that he used to chew the rim. Yet this damage increased its value, and no item of fluorspar today bears a higher price-tag on it. . . .\n\nWhen the ex-consul Titus Petronius was at the point of death, he broke a fluorspar ladle for which he had paid 300,000 sesterces, thus depriving the emperor’s dining-room table of this legacy. Nero, however, as was fitting for an emperor, outdid everyone by paying a million sesterces for a single bowl. That a commander-in-chief and Father of his Country paid so much to drink is a matter worthy of record.\n\nThe East exports fluorspar vessels. There the mineral is found in many otherwise unremarkable places, especially in the kingdom of Parthia. The best specimens of fluorspar, however, occur in Carmania. The actual mineral is thought to be a liquid that is solidified underground by heat. Pieces of fluorspar are never larger than a small display stand, and usually seldom even the size of the drinking vessels to which I have alluded. They shine, but not intensely – indeed, they can more accurately be said to glisten. Their value lies in their variegated colours. As the veins swirl round they vary repeatedly from purple to white to a mixture of the two, the purple becoming fiery, and the milk-white, red, as though the new colour was passing through the vein.\n\nSome people reserve special admiration for pieces whose edges reflect colours as we see them in the inner part of a rainbow. The smell of fluorspar is also one of its attractions.” Pliny NH, XXXVII, 18, 20-21; (1991), pp. 366-367.\n\n12.8. This probably refers to a mountain near the important oasis of Hami (I-wu 伊吾 – modern Kumul). Alternatively, it could possibly be a reference to the Yiwulu [I-wu-lü] Mountains to the west of Shenyang (Mukden) in Manchuria (modern Liaoning Province), where an unusual stone, called xunyuqi [sün-yü-k’i or hsün-yü-ch’i], which was classed as a type of jade is found. A piece of it was obtained by Da Cheng [Ta-Ch’êng], an Imperial Commissioner when he passed through the region circa 1884, who said:\n\n“I obtained a piece of jade produced in the I-wu-lü mountains. It was cut and polished into the shape of a girdle pendant, in size not exceeding an inch. I confess I have not yet seen such big ones. The common name is ‘stone of Kin chou.’ It is not very expensive or esteemed. The jade substance in the ring under consideration is similar to the Kin chou stone. There are especially differences between the old and the modern ones: if it has lain underground for a long time, the color receives a moist gloss and reflects under the light. Truly it is an unusual kind of jade.” Laufer (1912), p. 109.\n\n12.9. Chapter 118 of the Hou Hanshu provides interesting details of Chen Pan’s career:\n\n“During the Yuanchu period [114-120 CE] in the reign of Emperor An, An Guo, the king of Shule (Kashgar), exiled his maternal uncle Chen Pan to the Yuezhi (Kushans) for some offence. The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, An Guo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yi Fu (literally, ‘Posthumous Child’), who was the son of a younger brother of Chen Pan, and born of the same mother as him, on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chen Pan heard of this and appealed to the Yuezhi (Kushan) king, saying:\n\n“An Guo had no son. The men of his mother’s family are young and weak. I am Yi Fu’s paternal uncle; it is I who should be king.”\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chen Pan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yi Fu and went to Chen Pan, and made him king.” See CWR Section 21.\n\nIn the section on the Kingdom of Jumi or Keriya the Hou Hanshu (CWR Section 3) adds:\n\n“In the first Yangjia year [132 CE], Xu You sent the king of Shule (Kashgar), Chen Pan, who with 20,000 men, attacked and defeated Yutian (Khotan). He beheaded several hundred people, and released his soldiers to plunder freely. He replaced the king [of Jumi] by installing Cheng Guo from the family of [the previous king] Xing, and then he returned.”\n\nThese accounts involving the Kashgari prince, Chen Pan, being held hostage by the Kushan king (who “became very fond of him”) almost certainly form the basis of the story that Xuan Zang, the famous Chinese pilgrim monk, heard when he was travelling through the Punjab in 633 CE. Of interest is the fact that the Kushan king, who remains unnamed in the Hou Hanshu, is named as Kanishka in Xuan Zang’s account:\n\n“When Kanishka was reigning the fear of his name spread to many regions s"
