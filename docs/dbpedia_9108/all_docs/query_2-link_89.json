        "text": "Prehistoric art refers to the art created by humans before the invention of writing.\n\nIt is important to contextualize prehistoric art in order to understand its meaning and significance.\n\nCultural context, historical context, and environmental context are three important factors to consider when contextualizing prehistoric art.\n\nCultural context includes the beliefs, values, and practices of the people who created the art.\n\nHistorical context includes the events and circumstances that were happening at the time the art was created.\n\nEnvironmental context includes the physical surroundings and natural resources available to the people who created the art.\n\nBy considering these contexts, we can gain a better understanding of the purpose and meaning behind prehistoric art.\n\nThe Near East is a region that includes modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and parts of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nThe art of the Near East dates back to the Neolithic period, around 8000 BCE.\n\nThe Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 4000 BCE, created some of the earliest known works of art in the region, including cylinder seals and votive statues.\n\nThe Babylonians, who followed the Sumerians, created intricate relief sculptures and decorative tiles.\n\nThe Persians, who ruled the region from the 6th to the 4th century BCE, created elaborate palaces and tombs, such as the famous Persepolis.\n\nIslamic art, which emerged in the 7th century CE, is characterized by intricate geometric patterns, calligraphy, and the use of bright colors.\n\nThe art of the Near East has been influenced by various religions, including Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nMany of the works of art from the Near East are now housed in museums around the world, including the British Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris.\n\nEtruria was a civilization in ancient Italy that flourished from the 9th to the 3rd century BCE.\n\nEtruscan art was heavily influenced by Greek art, but it also had its own unique style.\n\nIt was characterized by its use of terracotta, bronze, and gold.\n\nIt was also known for its intricate and detailed designs, which often depicted scenes from mythology and daily life.\n\nEtruscan tombs were often decorated with frescoes, which depicted scenes from the afterlife and the deceased's life.\n\nEtruscan sculpture was also highly detailed and often depicted human figures in a naturalistic style.\n\nEtruscan pottery was also highly prized and was often decorated with intricate designs and scenes from mythology.\n\nEtruscan art declined after the Roman conquest of Etruria in the 3rd century BCE, but its influence can still be seen in Roman art and architecture.\n\nMesopotamia, located in the Tigris-Euphrates river basin, was home to some of the earliest civilizations in the world, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians.\n\nMesopotamian art portrays the cultural, religious, and political ideas of cultures that thrived between 4000 BCE to 539 BCE.\n\nIt is renowned for its enormous building, such as the ziggurat and the palace, as well as its exquisite reliefs, sculptures, and items fashioned from clay, stone, and metal.\n\nIt also features a rich heritage of cylinder seals, which had a number of purposes, including administrative, religious, and commercial.\n\nIt is noteworthy not just for its aesthetic value, but also for the information it provides into the ancient Mesopotamian social, economic, and political systems.\n\nAncient Egyptian art, which goes back to roughly 3100 BCE, is renowned for its highly stylized and symbolic qualities.\n\nIt was intricately intertwined with the religious beliefs and rituals of the civilisation, which lasted over 3,000 years.\n\nIt was religious in nature and depicted the gods and goddesses of the Egyptian pantheon, as well as pharaohs and other prominent figures. tombs and temples, as well as depictions of everyday life, were also decorated with Egyptian art.\n\nIt was profoundly inspired by their belief in the afterlife, which resulted in the development of tombs, sarcophagi, and other elaborate funerary artifacts.\n\nIt was defined by the usage of hieroglyphs, which were a sort of writing used to depict words and concepts.\n\nAncient Greek art comprises the art created in the Graeco world from the ninth century BCE to the fourth century AD.\n\nThis time witnessed the rise and collapse of the major city-states of Athens, Sparta, and Corinth, as well as the birth of the Hellenistic period after Alexander the Great's conquests.\n\nThe art of ancient Greece was defined by its emphasis on the human form as well as balance, harmony, and symmetry.\n\nGreek art also reflects the society's political and cultural values as well as its religious beliefs and myths.\n\nAncient Greek art continues to amaze and inspire audiences today, from the Parthenon's renowned marble statues to the Minoan civilization's vibrant murals.\n\nAncient Etruscan art, the art and architecture produced by the Etruscan civilisation in central Italy between the eighth and third centuries BCE, is distinguished by its particular style, which was inspired by the art of the ancient Greeks and the indigenous cultures of Italy.\n\nMetalworking is prominent in Etruscan art, particularly in the creation of complex sarcophagi and jewelry. The monumental architecture of the Etruscan civilization included the construction of enormous tombs and ornate city fortifications.\n\nEtruscan art also includes paintings and pottery. These works of art offer insight into the Etruscans' religious beliefs, social organization, and daily life.\n\nAs a major forerunner to Roman art, Etruscan art is also crucial in the history of Western art.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto was written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848.\n\nIt was first published in German in London.\n\nThis was commissioned by the Communist League, a political organization that sought to unite various socialist groups.\n\nThe text outlines the principles of communism and critiques capitalism.\n\nThe Manifesto argues that the history of society is a history of class struggle, and that the proletariat (working class) will eventually overthrow the bourgeoisie (capitalist class).\n\nThe Manifesto had a significant impact on political and social movements around the world, and is considered one of the most influential political texts in history.\n\nAfrican art has a long and rich history that dates back to prehistoric times.\n\nThe continent's diverse cultures and civilizations have produced a wide range of artistic traditions, including sculpture, painting, textiles, and performance art.\n\nAfrican art has been influenced by a variety of factors, including religion, politics, and social customs.\n\nThe arrival of European colonizers in the 15th century had a significant impact on African art, as it led to the introduction of new materials and techniques, as well as the exportation of African art to Europe.\n\nIn the 20th century, African art became increasingly recognized as a valuable and important cultural heritage, leading to the establishment of museums and galleries dedicated to African art around the world.\n\nBuddhism: founded by Siddhartha Gautama in India, focuses on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path to achieve enlightenment and end suffering.\n\nHinduism: one of the oldest religions, originated in India, believes in reincarnation and karma, and has many gods and goddesses.\n\nDaoism (Taoism): originated in China, emphasizes living in harmony with nature and the Tao (the way), and has a focus on meditation and simplicity.\n\nConfucianism: founded by Confucius in China, emphasizes moral values, respect for elders, and the importance of education and social order.\n\nShintoism: indigenous religion of Japan, focuses on the worship of kami (spirits or gods) and the importance of nature and purity.\n\nChristianity: based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, believes in one God and the Holy Trinity, and has many different denominations.\n\nIslam: founded by the prophet Muhammad in Arabia, believes in one God (Allah) and the importance of the Five Pillars of Islam, including prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nSome areas of the Pacific are among the oldest inhabited places on earth, while others are among the newest.\n\nAborigines reached Australia around 50,000 years ago.\n\nRemote Pacific islands like Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand were occupied only in the last thousand years.\n\nSeafarers reached Fiji in the central South Pacific around 1300 B.C.E.\n\nTechnological development of sailing craft enabled greater territories to be mapped and charted for possible occupation.\n\nTonga was reached in 420 B.C.E. and Samoa in 200 B.C.E. using the particularly effective twin-hulled sailing canoe.\n\nThe discovery of New Zealand by the ancestors of the Maori happened perhaps as early as the tenth century, but certainly by the thirteenth century.\n\nEuropean involvement in the Pacific began with the circumnavigation of the globe by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his crew.\n\nExplorers of the eighteenth century were followed by occupiers from the nineteenth century, who implanted European customs, values, religions, and technologies onto the indigenous population.\n\nMany areas of the Pacific achieved independence in the twentieth century.\n\nStone: Prehistoric artists used stone to create sculptures, tools, and weapons. They used different types of stone, such as flint, obsidian, and jade, depending on availability and suitability for their purpose.\n\nBone: Bone was used to create tools, weapons, and decorative objects. It was often carved or engraved with intricate designs.\n\nIvory: Ivory was used to create small sculptures and decorative objects. It was often carved with intricate designs.\n\nClay: Clay was used to create pottery and figurines. Prehistoric artists would shape the clay by hand or using simple tools, and then fire it to harden it.\n\nPigments: Prehistoric artists used natural pigments such as charcoal, ochre, and manganese dioxide to create paintings and drawings. These pigments were often mixed with water or animal fat to create a paint-like substance.\n\nCarving: Prehistoric artists would carve stone, bone, and ivory using simple tools such as chisels and hammers. They would often use sand or water to smooth the surface of the object.\n\nEngraving: Engraving involves cutting or scratching a design into a surface. Prehistoric artists would often use sharp stones or bones to engrave intricate designs onto bone or ivory objects.\n\nModeling: Modeling involves shaping a material such as clay or wax into a three-dimensional form. Prehistoric artists would use their hands or simple tools to shape clay into pottery or figurines.\n\nPainting: Prehistoric artists would mix pigments with water or animal fat to create a paint-like substance. They would then apply the paint to a surface using brushes made from animal hair or plant fibers.\n\nTwo sides: war side and peace side; may have been two halves of a narrative; early example of a historical narrative.\n\nWar side: Sumerian king, half a head taller than the others, has descended from his chariot to inspect captives brought before him, some of whom are debased by their nakedness; in the lowest register, chariots advance over the dead.\n\nPeace side: food brought in a procession to the banquet; musician plays the lyre; the ruler is the largest figure—he wears a kilt made of tufts of wool; may have been a victory celebration after a battle.\n\nShamash: Sun god, enthroned on a ziggurat, hands Hammurabi a rope, a ring, and a rod of kingship.\n\nShamash is in a frontal view and a profile at the same time; their headdress is in profile; rays (wings?) appear from behind his shoulders.\n\nShamash’s beard is fuller than Hammurabi’s, illustrating Shamash’s greater ­wisdom.\n\nShamash, judge of the sky and the earth, with a tiara of four rows of horns, ­presents signs of royal power, the scepter and the ring, to Hammurabi.\n\nThey stare at one another directly even though their shoulders are frontal; composite views.\n\nHammurabi is depicted with a speaking/greeting gesture.\n\nEach pyramid has a funerary complex adjacent connected by a formal pathway used for carrying the dead pharaoh’s body to the pyramid to be interred.\n\nShape may have been influenced by a sacred stone relic called a benben, which is shaped like a sacred stone found at Heliopolis.\n\nHeliopolis was the center of the sun god cult.\n\nEach side of the pyramid is oriented toward a point on the compass, a fact pointing to an association with the stars and the sun.\n\nGiza temples face east, the rising sun, and have been associated with the god Re.\n\nTop register — Hunefer in white at left before a row of judges.\n\nMain register — the jackal-headed god of embalming, Anubis, leads the deceased into a hall, where his soul is weighed against a feather. If his sins weigh more than a feather, he will be condemned.\n\nAmmit: The hippopotamus/lion figure; between the scales, will eat the heart of an evil soul.\n\nThoth: A god who has the head of a bird; the stenographer writing down these events in the hieroglyphics that he invented.\n\nOsiris: god of the underworld, enthroned on the right; will subject the deceased to a day of judgment.\n\nGreek predilection for algebra and geometry is omnipresent in the design of this building: parts can be expressed as x = 2y + 1; thus, there are 17 columns on the side (x) and 8 columns in the front (y), and the ratio of the length to the width is 9:4. Proportions are the same for the cella.\n\nUnusually light interior had two windows in the cella.\n\nThe façade floor curves upward in the center to drain rainwater and prevent sagging at the ends.\n\nSince the end columns are surrounded by light, they are thicker to match the others.\n\nIonic elements in a Doric temple: the rear room contains Ionic capitals, and the frieze on interior is Ionic.\n\nAlexander, at left: does not wear a helmet, showing his bravery.\n\nAlexander pierces the body of an enemy with his spear without so much as a glance at his victim.\n\nAlexander’s widened eye is trained on Darius.\n\nDarius, in center right on chariot: horrified, weakly cedes the victory; his charioteer commands the horses to make their escape.\n\nDarius looks stunned as his brother, Oxyanthres, is stabbed, the brother portrayed here as sacrificing himself to save the king.\n\nThe dying man’s right hand is still gripping his weapon, as though he wished to pull it out of his body, but his body is already collapsing onto the bloody corpse of his black horse.\n\nInterior contains a slightly convex floor for water drainage.\n\nSquare panels on floor and in coffers contrast with roundness of walls; circles and squares are a unifying theme.\n\nCoffers may have been filled with rosette designs to simulate stars.\n\nCupola walls are enormously thick: 20 feet at base.\n\nThickness of walls is thinned at the top; coffers take some weight pressure off the walls.\n\nOculus, 27 feet across, allows for air and sunlight; sun moves across the interior much like a spotlight\n\nHeight of the building equals its width; the building is based on the circle; a hemisphere.\n\nWalls have seven niches for statues of the gods.\n\nTriumph of concrete construction.\n\nWas originally brilliantly decorated.\n\nIdealized view of the Roman emperor, not an individualized portrait.\n\nConfusion between God and man is intentional; in contrast with Roman Republican portraits.\n\nStanding barefoot indicates he is on sacred ground.\n\nOn his breastplate are a number of gods participating in the return of Roman standards from the Parthians; Pax Romana.\n\nBreastplate indicates he is a warrior; judges’ robes show him as a civic ruler.\n\nHe may have carried a sword, pointing down, in his left hand.\n\nHis right hand is in a Roman orator pose; perhaps it held laurel branches.\n\nAt base: Cupid on the back of a dolphin—a reference to Augustus’s divine descent from Venus; perhaps also a symbol of Augustus’s naval victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra.\n\nMaybe a copy of a bronze original, which probably did not have the image of Cupid.\n\nRibbed vaults: A vault with a framework of ribs or arches under the intersections of the vaulted sections.\n\nFlying buttresses: An arched stone support that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass.\n\nPointed arches: An arch with a pointed crown, characteristic of Gothic architecture.\n\nS-curve (ogee) shape: A double curve, shaped like an S, used in architecture and decoration.\n\nElaborate tracery: Decorative stone openwork, typically in the upper part of a Gothic window.\n\nGargoyles and grotesques: A carved or sculpted figure, typically with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building.\n\nIlluminated manuscripts: A manuscript in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as initials, borders, and miniature illustrations.\n\nPolychrome sculpture: A sculpture decorated in several colors.\n\nOil paint: A type of paint made by mixing pigments with oil, usually linseed oil. It is known for its slow drying time and ability to create rich, layered colors.\n\nCanvas: A type of fabric used as a surface for painting. It is typically made from cotton or linen and stretched over a wooden frame.\n\nWood panels: A flat surface made of wood that was commonly used for painting before the introduction of canvas. It was often prepared with a layer of gesso before painting.\n\nFresco: A painting technique in which pigments are applied to wet plaster. This allows the colors to become embedded in the wall and creates a durable, long-lasting artwork.\n\nLinear perspective: A technique used in art to create the illusion of depth and space on a flat surface by using converging lines that meet at a vanishing point.\n\nChiaroscuro: An Italian term that refers to the use of strong contrasts between light and dark in art to create a sense of volume and three-dimensionality.\n\nSfumato: An Italian term that refers to a painting technique used to create a soft, hazy effect by blending colors or tones together to create a gradual transition from light to dark.\n\nForeshortening: A technique used in art to create the illusion of depth and perspective by shortening the length of an object as it recedes into the distance.\n\nGlazing: A painting technique that involves applying thin, transparent layers of paint over a previously painted surface to create depth, luminosity, and color harmony.\n\nChrist, as a strict judge, divides the world into those going to heaven and those going to hell.\n\nChrist is depicted with a welcoming right hand, a cast down left hand.\n\nChrist sits in a mandorla.\n\nA dividing line runs vertically through the cross in the middle of the composition.\n\nThe Archangel Michael and the devil are at Christ’s feet, weighing souls.\n\nHell, with the damned, is on the right.\n\nPeople enter the church on the right as sinners and exit on the left as saved; the right door has sculptures of the damned and the left door has images of the saved.\n\nThe figures of the saved move toward Christ, Mary, and Saint Peter; local abbots and monks follow Charlemagne, the legendary benefactor of the monastery, who is led by the hand.\n\nParadise, at the lower level, is portrayed as the heavenly Jerusalem.\n\nSainte Foy interceded for those enslaved by the Muslims in Spain—she herself appears kneeling before a giant hand of God.\n\nOn the right lower level, the devil presides over a chaotic tangle of tortured condemned sinners.\n\nInscription on lintel: “O Sinners, change your morals before you might face a cruel judgment.”\n\nHieratic scale may parallel one’s status in a feudal society.\n\nStarted in 1145; fire in 1194 forced reconstruction of everything except the façade.\n\nMary’s tunic, worn at Jesus’s birth, is its most sacred relic; its escape from a fire in 1194 was seen as a signal to rebuild the cathedral.\n\nRight spire is from 1160; left spire is Late Gothic (1507–1513), a style more elaborate and decorative called Flamboyant Gothic.\n\nImportance of the church reflected in the speed of construction: 27 years.\n\nEach wing of the cathedral faces a cardinal direction of the compass:\n\nThe west wing is the entrance, facing sunset and symbolizing the end of the world.\n\nThe north wing has stained-glass windows that symbolize the past.\n\nThe south wing has stained-glass windows that symbolize the presentworld depicted in the New Testament.\n\nThe east wing has the apse and altar, located where the sun rises.\n\nPart of a complex that included a school, a bishop’s palace, and a hospital.\n\nLamentation shows scenes of Jesus’s followers mourning his death. Usually the scene contains Mary, Saint John, and Mary Magdalene.\n\nSaint John throws his hands back—recalling his iconographic symbol as an eagle; Mary Magdalene cradles Jesus’s feet; Mary holds Jesus’s head.\n\nAt left is the Old Testament scene of Jonah being swallowed by the whale and returning to life, a parallel with the New Testament scene of Christ dying and rising from the dead.\n\nRange of emotions: heavy sadness, quiet resignation, flaming outbursts, despair.\n\nSadness of scene emphasized by grieving angels.\n\nLeafless tree echoes the theme of death in the painting; also represents the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, which dies after Adam and Eve are expelled; a dead tree also symbolizes the wood of the cross Jesus was crucified on.\n\nChristians believe Jesus sacrificed himself, in part, to expiate the expulsion from the ­Garden of Eden.\n\nSymbolism of weddings:\n\nThe custom of burning a candle on the first night of a wedding.\n\nShoes are cast off, indicating that the couple is standing on holy ground.\n\nThe groom is in a promising pose.\n\nThe dog symbolizes fidelity.\n\nTwo witnesses in the convex mirror; perhaps the artist himself, since the inscription reads “Jan van Eyck was here 1434.”\n\nThe woman pulls up her dress to symbolize childbirth, although most likely she is not pregnant; the gesture may simply be a fashion of the time.\n\nStatue of Saint Margaret, patron saint of childbirth, appears on the bedpost.\n\nThe man is standing near the window, symbolizing his role as someone who makes his way in the outside world; the woman appears further in the room to emphasize her role as a homemaker.\n\nWealth is displayed in the opulent furnishings, the elaborate clothing, and the importing of fresh oranges from southern Europe.\n\nMichelangelo chose a complicated arrangement of figures for the ceiling, which broadly illustrates the first few chapters of Genesis in nine scenes, with accompanying Old Testament figures and antique sibyls\n\nThe grand and massive figures are meant to be seen from a distance, but also echo the grandeur of the Biblical narrative.\n\n300 figures on the ceiling, with no two in the same pose; a tribute to Michelangelo’s lifelong preoccupation with the male nude in motion.\n\nEnormous variety of expression.\n\nPainted cornices frame groupings of figures in a highly organized way.\n\nMany figures are done for artistic expression rather than to enhance the narrative; the ignudi, for example.\n\nIgnudi: nude corner figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling\n\nSistine Chapel was erected in 1472 and painted by quattrocento masters, including Botticelli, Perugino, and Michelangelo’s teacher, Ghirlandaio.\n\nQuattrocento paintings are of the life of Christ and the life of Moses; Michelangelo needed a different topic for the ceiling; he chose the cosmic theme of creation.\n\nMichelangelo’s paintings are painted over the window level of the chapel as well as the ceiling.\n\nThe chapel is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, as such the central panel on the ceiling depicts Eve, the archetype of Mary, who, according to tradition, began the redemption necessitated by the sin of Eve and Adam.\n\nAcorns, a motif on the ceiling, were inspired by the crest of the chapel’s patron, Pope Julius II.\n\nOpposite this work is a Raphael painting called La Disputà,\n\nbased on religion;\n\nreligious books were placed below;\n\nparallels drawn between the two themes expressed in the paintings.\n\nTo the left of Philosophy is Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, referencing literature.\n\nThe building depicted in the background might reflect Bramante’s plan for Saint Peter’s; Bramante appears as the bald Euclid in the lower right.\n\nIn the center are the two greatest figures in ancient Greek thought:\n\nPlato (with the features of Leonardo da Vinci) on the left pointing up, and\n\nAristotle (perhaps with the features of the architect Giuliano da Sangallo) pointing out.\n\nTheir gestures reflect their philosophies.\n\nOn the left are those interested in the ideal (followers of Plato); on the right, those interested in the practical (followers of Aristotle).\n\nRaphael is on the extreme right with a black hat.\n\nMichelangelo, resting on the stone block writing a poem, represents the philosopher Heraclitus; the figure was added later and was not part of the original composition.\n\n240 feet long, facing the garden façade.\n\nBarrel-vaulted painted ceiling (paintings stress the military victories of Louis XIV; rooms that flank the Hall of Mirrors are thematically related, one of Peace and the other War).\n\nLight comes in from one side and ricochets off large panes of glass, the largest that could be made at the time.\n\nThis is an example of a use of flickering light in an architectural setting.\n\nMirrors were among the most expensive items manufactured in the seventeenth century—the Hall of Mirrors is an extravagant display of wealth.\n\nMirrors were made exclusively in Venice at the time; workers had to be imported from Venice to make the mirrors, which conformed to the dictates that the decorations at Versailles had to be made in France.\n\nHall of Mirrors used for court and state functions: embassies, births, and marriages were celebrated in this room.\n\nSubsequent history:\n\nUsed by Bismarck to declare William I as German emperor after the defeat of the French in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.\n\nUsed reciprocally by the French after the defeat of the Germans in World War I to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nOn the ceiling in the main nave of Il Gesù, Rome\n\nIn the center is the monogram of Jesus, IHS, in a brilliant sea of golden color.\n\nFigures tumble below the name; some are carved in stucco and enhance the three-­dimensional effect.\n\nSome cast long shadows across the barrel vault.\n\nSome painted figures are not stucco, but maintain a vibrant three-dimensional illusion.\n\nIt is as if the ceiling were opened to the sky and the figures are spiraling around Jesus’s name.\n\nDepicted in the center are holy men and women.\n\nAround the rim are priests, soldiers, noblemen, and the Magi.\n\nAllegories of avarice, simony, heresy, and vanity occupy the lowest registers.\n\nDi sotto in sù: a type of ceiling painting in which the figures seem to be hovering above the viewers, often looking down at us\n\nPortrait of the artist in his studio at work; he steps back from his very large canvas and looks at the viewer.\n\nCentral is the Infanta Margharita of Spain with her meninas (attendants), a dog, a dwarf, and a midget. Behind are two chaperones in half-shadow. In the doorway is perhaps José Nieto, who was head of the queen’s tapestry works (hence his hand on a curtain).\n\nThe king and queen appear in a mirror. But what is the mirror reflecting?\n\nVelázquez’s canvas?\n\nThe king and queen perhaps standing in the viewer’s space—is this why people have turned around?\n\nOr is it reflecting a painting of the king and queen on the far wall of the room?\n\nWhat is the painter painting?\n\nThe royal family?\n\nThe Infanta?\n\nA painting of this painting?\n\nUs?\n\nUltimately, there is no answer, which expresses the Baroque fascination with exploring reality.\n\nHenry IV is smitten by the portrait of his intended; the portrait is the center of a swirling composition.\n\nThe portrait is held by Cupid (the god of love) and Hymen (the god of marriage).\n\nMythological gods Jupiter (symbolized by an eagle) and Juno (symbolized by a peacock) look down from below; they are symbolic of marital harmony. They express their support.\n\nRoyalty was considered demigods; the approval of mythological gods is in concert with their beliefs about themselves.\n\nThis represents the tradition of portraits being exchanged before the marriage.\n\nThey were actually married by proxy in 1600.\n\nBehind Henry is the personification of France: –France is a female figure with a masculine helmet and manly legs. –She whispers to Henry to choose love over war.\n\nCommissioned by an unnamed “gentleman of the Court:” a painting of his young mistress on a swing; in an early version, a bishop is pushing the swing with the gentleman admiring his mistress’s legs from below.\n\nIn the finished painting, the older man is no longer a priest, a barking dog has been added, and Falconet’s sculpture of Menacing Love comments on the story.\n\nThe patron in the lower left looks up the skirt of a young lady who swings flirtatiously, boldly kicking off her shoe at a sculpture.\n\nThe dog in the lower right corner, generally seen as a symbol of fidelity, barks in disapproval at the scene before him.\n\nEntered in an unjuried show, the work was refused—narrowly voted out by the organizers.\n\nThought to be indecent, not fit to show women.\n\nDuchamp resigned in protest.\n\nIt is not fully understood why Duchamp resigned; it may have come from his experience exhibiting an earlier work Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2 to the Salon des Indépendants in Paris; although the work was illustrated in the show’s catalog, Duchamp was asked to remove it a few days before the opening.\n\nHe removed the object but felt betrayed; said it was a turning point in his life.\n\nFountain can be seen as an experimental replay by Duchamp, testing the commitment of the new American Society to freedom of expression and tolerance of new conceptions about art.\n\nThe title is a pun: a fountain spouts liquid, a urinal collects it.\n\nThe placing of the urinal upside down is an added irony.\n\nThe rotation of Fountain may symbolize seeing something familiar from a new perspective.\n\nThe original is now lost; Duchamp oversaw the “remaking” of a few models in 1964.\n\nSaid to have been done in response to Picasso’s claim that anything looks good in fur; Oppenheim said to respond, “Even this cup and saucer?”\n\nErotic overtones.\n\nCombination of unalike objects: fur-covered teacup, saucer, and spoon. The tea cup was purchased at a department store; the fur is the pelt of a Chinese gazelle.\n\nA contrast of textures: fur delights the touch, not the taste; cups and spoons are meant to be put in the mouth.\n\nOppenheim did not title the work, but the Surrealist critic, Andre Breton, called the piece Le Déjeneur en fourrure, or Luncheon in Fur, a title that references Édouard Manet’s Luncheon on the Grass as well as the erotic novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch called Venus in Furs.\n\nChosen by visitors to a Surrealist show in New York as the quintessential Surrealist work of art.\n\nBecause fame came to Oppenheim so young (she was twenty-two when she produced this work), it inhibited her growth as an artist.\n\nThere is a juxtaposition to two self-portraits.\n\nKahlo’s two hearts are joined together by veins that are cut by scissors at one end and lead to a portrait of her husband, artist Diego Rivera, at the other; painted at the time of their divorce.\n\nThe vein acts as an umbilical cord; symbolism: Rivera as both husband and son.\n\nBlood on her lap suggests many abortions and miscarriages; also, surgeries related to her health issues.\n\nKahlo rejected the label Surrealism for her artwork.\n\nCuban-born artist whose career took him to Europe and the United States.\n\nThe artist was interested in Cuba’s mixture of Hispanic and African cultures.\n\nThis work was “intended to communicate a psychic state.”\n\nThe work addresses the history of slavery in colonial Cuba.\n\nInfluences include African sculpture; Cubist works; Surrealist paintings (Lam was a member of the Surrealist movement in Paris).\n\nThe painting contrasts a Cuban landscape with a tourist image of Cuba as a tropical paradise.\n\nCantilevered steel-supported porches extend over a waterfall.\n\nThe accent is on horizontal lines—as opposed to the verticality of much of twentieth-century architecture.\n\nThe architecture is in harmony with the site.\n\nThe living room contains a glass curtain wall around three of the four sides; the building embraces the woods around it.\n\nThe floor of the living room and the walls of building are made from the stone of the area.\n\nThe hearth (physically and symbolically) is the center of the house, an outcropping of natural stones surrounds it.\n\nThe interior shows a suppression of space devoted to hanging a painting; Wright wanted the architecture to dominate.\n\nThe ground plan and design is irregular and complex.\n\nOnly two colors used: light ochre for the concrete and Cherokee red for the steel.\n\nBoxlike horizontal quality; an abstraction of a house.\n\nThe main part of the house is lifted off the ground by narrow pilotis—thin freestanding posts.\n\nThe house appears to float on pilotis; allows air to circulate around the base of the house.\n\nThe turning circular carport on the bottom floor enables family members to enter the house directly from their car.\n\nAll space is utilized, including the roof, which acts as a patio.\n\nThe roof terraces bring the outdoors into the house.\n\nSubtle colors: white on exterior symbolizes modern cleanliness and healthful living.\n\nOpen interior is free of many walls.\n\nSome furniture is built into the walls.\n\nRibbon windows wind around the second floor.\n\nStreamlined look.\n\nLiving spaces that are surrounded by glass face an open courtyard-type setting on the second floor.\n\nMinimalist architecture.\n\nMonolith style expresses corporate power.\n\nMies’s saying of “Less is more” can be seen in this building with its great simplicity, geometry of design, and elegance of construction.\n\nMies also said, “God is in the details;” truthful buildings express their structure, not hide it.\n\nSteel and glass skyscrapers and curtain wall construction became the model after World War II.\n\nA triumph of the International Style of architecture.\n\nOne of a series of 60 paintings that depicts the migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the urban North after World War I.\n\nNegroes escaping the economic privation of the South.\n\nNarrative painting in an era of increasing abstraction.\n\nCinematic movement of views of panels: some horizontal and others vertical.\n\nInfluenced by the Italian masters of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; used tempera paint.\n\nThe Phillips Collections in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art in New York bought the collection and it was split.\n\nThe Phillips took the odd-numbered paintings; the Museum of Modern Art has the even-numbered ones.\n\nCombination of stereotypes; ironic comment on the banal and artificial world of film and advertising.\n\nCommentary on the female form in art history.\n\nIs she aggressive? Or have aggressions been committed against her? Or both?\n\nOne of a series of six paintings on this theme.\n\nInfluenced by everything from paleolithic goddesses to pin-up girls\n\nMarilyn Monroe’s public face appears sequentially as if on a roll of film.\n\nFifty images from a film still from a movie, Niagara (1953).\n\nSocial characteristics magnified: brilliance of blonde hair, heavily applied lipstick, seductive expression.\n\nPrivate persona of the individual submerged beneath the public face.\n\nMarilyn’s public face appears highlighted by bold, artificial colors.\n\nLeft, in color, represents her in life; right, in black and white, represents her in death; work done four months after her tragic death.\n\nRepetition of faces reflects the repetition of the number of times Marilyn appeared before the public; sometimes overexposed, sometimes underexposed.\n\nThe artist originally featured the work as an uninvited participant in the 1966 Venice Biennale.\n\nFifteen hundred large, mirrored, plastic balls were placed on a lawn under a sign that said “Your Narcissism for Sale.”\n\nThe viewer is reflected seemingly into infinity in the mirrored surfaces.\n\nThe artist offered the balls for sale for 1,200 lire ($2 each) as a commentary on the commercialism and vanity of the current art world.\n\nThe installation later moved to water, where the floating balls reflect the natural environment—and the viewers—around the work; water placement makes a stronger connection to the ancient myth.\n\nBalls move with the currents of the water and wind, reflecting organically made, ever-changing viewpoints.\n\nThe installation has been exhibited in many places around the world, both in water and in dry spaces\n\nUpon walking on the jetty, the twisting and curling path changes the viewer’s view from every angle.\n\nA jetty is usually a pier extending into the water; here it is transformed into a curl of rocks sitting silently in a vast, empty wilderness.\n\nThe coil is an image seen in North American earthworks—cf. Great Serpent Mound, Ohio—as well as in petroglyphs and Anasazi pottery.\n\nThe work reflects emerging views of the environmental movement; Earth Day was inaugurated in 1970.\n\nSmithson wanted nature to have its effect on the jetty (sometimes it is submerged, sometimes it is visible).\n\nThe façade contains an arch inside a pediment form.\n\nA squat, bulging Doric colonnade is asymmetrically placed.\n\nThe columns are actually flat rather than the traditionally round forms.\n\nThe drainpipe at the left bisects the outermost column.\n\nThe flattened forms on the interior arches echo the exterior flat columns.\n\nThe interior forms reflect a craftsman’s hand in curved, cutting elements.\n\nInside the old temple of Chavín is a mazelike system of hallways.\n\nPassageways have no natural light source; they are lit by candles and lamps.\n\nAt the center, underground, is the Lanzón (Spanish for “blade”) Stone; blade shaped; may also represent a primitive plough; hence, the role of the god in ensuring a successful crop.\n\nDepicts a powerful figure that is part human (body) and part animal (claws, fangs); the god of the temple complex.\n\nHead of snakes and a face of a jaguar.\n\nEyebrows terminate in snakes.\n\nFlat relief; designs in a curvilinear pattern.\n\n15 feet tall.\n\nThe lintel was originally set above the central doorway of Structure 23 as a part of a series of three lintels.\n\nLady Xook (bottom right) invokes the Vision Serpent to commemorate her husband’s rise to the throne.\n\nThe Vision Serpent has two heads: one has a warrior emerging from its mouth, and the other has Tlaloc, a war god.\n\nShe holds a bowl with bloodletting ceremonial items: stinging spine and bloodstained paper; she runs a rope with thorns through her tongue.\n\nShe burns paper on a dish as a gift to the ­netherworld.\n\nThe depicted ritual was conducted to commemorate the accession of Shield Jaguar II to the throne.\n\nThe building is dedicated to Lady Xook, Shield Jaguar II’s wife.\n\nThe inscription is written as a mirror image—extremely unusual among Mayan glyphs; uncertain meaning, perhaps indicating she had a vision from the other side of existence and she was acting as an intercessor or shaman.\n\nThe inscription names the protagonist as Shield Jaguar II.\n\nBloodletting is central to the Mayan life. When a member of the royal family sheds his or her blood, a portal to the netherworld is opened and gods and spirits enter the world.\n\nFarming done on the plateau above the pueblo; everything had to be imported into the structure; water seeped through the sandstone and collected in trenches near the rear of the structure.\n\nLow winter sun penetrated the pueblo; high summer sun did not enter the interior and therefore it stayed relatively cool.\n\nInhabited for two hundred years; probably abandoned when the water source dried up.\n\nCoyolxauhqui and her many brothers plotted the death of her mother, Coatlicue, who became pregnant after tucking a ball of feathers down her bosom.\n\nWhen Coyolxauhqui chopped off Coatlicue’s head, a child, Huitzilopochtli, popped out of the severed body fully grown and dismembered Coyolxauhqui, who fell dead at the base of the shrine.\n\nThis stone represents the dismembered moon goddess, Coyolxauhqui, who is placed at the base of the twin pyramids of Tenochtitlán.\n\nAztecs sacrificed people and then threw their dismembered remains down the steps of the temple as Huitzilopochtli did to Coyolxauhqui.\n\nAztecs similarly dismembered enemies and threw them down the stairs of the great pyramid to land on the sculpture of Coyolxauhqui.\n\nA relationship was established between the death and decapitation of Coyolxauhqui with the sacrifice of enemies at the top of Aztec pyramids.\n\nAztecs felt they needed to feed the sun god human hearts and blood.\n\nA tongue in the center of the stone coming from the god’s mouth is a representation of a sacrificial flint knife used to slash open the victims.\n\nCircular shape reflects the cyclic nature of time.\n\nTwo calendar systems, separate but intertwined.\n\nCalendars synced every fifty-two years in a time of danger, when the Aztecs felt a human sacrifice could ensure survival.\n\nFound on the site; actually a much older work executed by the Olmecs.\n\nOlmec works have a characteristic frown on the face; pugnacious visage; baby face; a cleft in the center of the head carved from greenstone.\n\nShows that the Aztecs collected and embraced artwork from other cultures, including early Mexican cultures such as the Olmec and Teotihuacán.\n\nShows that the Aztecs had a wide-ranging merchant network that traded historical items.\n\nAshlar masonry; carefully grooved and beveled edges of the stone fit together in a puzzle-like formation.\n\nSlight spacing among stones allows movement during ­earthquakes.\n\nWalls taper upward; examples of Inkan trapezoidal architecture.\n\nTemple displays Inkan use of interlocking stonework of great precision.\n\nOriginal exterior walls of the temple were decorated in gold to symbolize sunshine.\n\nSpanish chroniclers insist that the walls and floors of the temple were covered in gold.\n\nDuring a ritual performance, the wearer opens and closes the transformation mask using strings.\n\nAt the moment of transformation, the performer turns his back to the audience to conceal the action and heighten the ­mystery.\n\nOpening the mask reveals the face of an ancestor; there is an ancestral element to the ceremony.\n\nAlthough these masks could be used at a potlatch, most often they were used in winter initiation rites ceremonies.\n\nThe ceremony is accompanied by drumming and takes place in a “big house.”\n\nMasks are highly prized and often inherited.\n\nDepicts traditional aspects of the Plains people’s culture that were nostalgic rather than practical: bison hunted with bow and arrow—nomadic hunting gone; bison nearly extinct.\n\nHide paintings mark past events.\n\nBison considered to be gifts from the Creator.\n\nHorses, in common use around 1750, liberated the Plains people.\n\nTeepee: made of hide stretched over poles:\n\nExterior poles reach the spirit world or sky.\n\nFire represents the heart.\n\nThe doorway faces east to greet the new day.\n\nThe sun dance was conducted around a bison head, and was outlawed by the U.S. government; viewed as a threat to order.\n\nThe sun dance involved men dancing, singing, preparing for the feast, drumming, and constructing a lodge. They honored the Creator deity for the bounty of the land.\n\nThe warrior’s deeds were celebrated on the hide.\n\nAfrican art is made from a wide range of materials including wood, metal, ivory, clay, stone, and textiles.\n\nWood is the most commonly used material in African art due to its abundance and ease of carving.\n\nMetal is used for casting sculptures and creating intricate jewelry.\n\nIvory is used for carving small figurines and decorative objects.\n\nClay is used for creating pottery and sculptures.\n\nTextiles are used for creating clothing, blankets, and other decorative items.\n\nAfrican art is created using a variety of processes including carving, casting, weaving, and painting.\n\nCarving is the most common process used in African art and involves using a chisel or knife to shape wood, ivory, or stone.\n\nCasting is used to create metal sculptures and involves pouring molten metal into a mold.\n\nWeaving is used to create textiles and involves interlacing threads or fibers.\n\nPainting is used to decorate sculptures, pottery, and textiles.\n\nZimbabwe derives from a Shona term meaning “venerated houses” or “houses of stone.”\n\nInternal and external passageways are tightly bounded, narrow, and long; occupants are forced to walk in single file, paralleling experiences in the African bush.\n\nThe conical tower is modeled on traditional shapes of grain silos; control over food symbolized wealth, power, and royal largesse.\n\nThe tower resembles a granary and represented a good harvest and prosperity; grain gathered, stored, and dispensed as a symbol of royal power.\n\nAbandoned in the fifteenth century probably because the surrounding area could no longer supply food and there was extensive deforestation.\n\nSymbol of the Ashanti nation, in Ghana.\n\nContains the soul of the nation.\n\nNever actually used as a stool; never allowed to touch the ground; it is placed on a stool of its own.\n\nAccording to Ashanti tradition, it was brought down from heaven by a priest and fell into the lap of the Ashanti king, Osei Tutu.\n\nIt became the repository of the spirit of the nation; it is the symbol of the mystical bond among all Ashanti.\n\nEach king is commemorated by symbols on the base of the figure; this king has a sword in his left hand in a nonaggressive pose, handle facing out.\n\nOne of the earliest existing African wood sculptures; oldest ndop in existence.\n\nRubbed with oil to protect it from insects.\n\nActed as a surrogate for the king in his absence.\n\nKept in the king’s shrine with other works called a set of “royal charms.”\n\nSpirits are embedded in the images.\n\nSpirits can be called upon to bless or harm others, cause death or give life.\n\nIn order to prod the image into action, nails and blades are often inserted into the work or removed from it.\n\nMedical properties are inserted into the body cavity, thought to be a person’s life or soul.\n\nThe figure has a role as a witness and enforcer of community affairs.\n\nThe figure also cautions people on the consequences of actions contrary to community norms.\n\nEach board’s design is unique and represents the divine revelations of a spirit medium expressed in sculptural form.\n\nMemory boards are controlled by the Mbudye, a council of men and women who interpret the political and historical aspects of Luba society.\n\nZoomorphic elements represented by the turtle, an animal that lives on both land and water; the dual nature of the turtle is a metaphor for the Luba people’s political organization as founded by two distinctly opposed embodiments of power: Kongolo Mwamba, avatar of all excess and tyranny, and Mbidi Kiluwe, sophisticated cultural hero who introduced royal culture to the Luba people.\n\nReading example:\n\nOne colored bead can stand for an individual.\n\nLarge beads surrounded by smaller beads can signify a ruler and his court.\n\nLines of beads are journeys or paths, migrations or genealogies.\n\nThe surfaces were ritually rubbed with oils to add luster and protect against insects.\n\nByeri figures are composed of characteristics the Fang people place a high value on: tranquility, introspection, and vitality.\n\nThe Fang people were nomadic; these figures were made to be portable.\n\nThe abstraction of the human body is an attraction for the early-twentieth-century artists.\n\nThe king is the focal point between himself and others represented on the post.\n\nBehind the king, his large-scale senior wife supports the throne.\n\nShe crowns the king during the coronation; protects him during his reign.\n\nThe smaller figures include his junior wife; his flute player, Eshu, the trickster god; and a figure of a fan bearer now missing.\n\nThe region has a long history of metalworking, dating back to ancient times.\n\nSkilled metalworkers used a variety of techniques to create intricate metal vessels decorated with geometric patterns, floral motifs, and calligraphy.\n\nThey also produced weapons and armor for both humans and horses, often decorated with intricate designs.\n\nThe metalwork of this region is a testament to the skill and creativity of its metalworkers and continues to be admired and studied by art historians and collectors worldwide.\n\nThe region is known for producing high-quality ceramics with intricate designs and vibrant colors.\n\nOne of the most famous types of ceramics from the region is Iznik pottery, which was produced in the Ottoman Empire and is characterized by its blue and white floral designs.\n\nAnother notable type of ceramics is Persian pottery, which often features intricate geometric patterns and calligraphy.\n\nCentral Asian ceramics, such as those produced in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, are known for their bright colors and bold designs.\n\nMany of these ceramics were used for practical purposes, such as storing food and water, but they were also highly valued as decorative objects.\n\nThe title of each chapter is scripted in gold.\n\nScript is rigidly aligned in strong horizontal letters well-spaced apart in brown ink.\n\nKufic script; strong uprights and long horizontals.\n\nGreat clarity of text is important because several readers read a book at once, some at a distance.\n\nArabic reads right to left.\n\nConsonants are scripted, vowels are indicated by dots or markings around the other ­letters.\n\nThe diacritical markings of short diagonal lines and red dots indicate vocalizations.\n\nPyramids of six gold discs mark the ends of ayat (verses).\n\nQur’ans were compiled and codified in the mid-seventh century; however, the earliest surviving Qur’an is from the ninth century.\n\nCalligraphy is greatly prized in Qur’anic texts; elaborate divine words needed the best ­artists.\n\nIllustrated is the heading of sura 29 (al-’Ankabūt, or “The Spider”) in gold.\n\nThe text indicates that those who believe in protectors other than Allah are like spiders who build flimsy homes.\n\nMedallion in center of carpet may represent the inside of a dome with 16 pendants.\n\nMosque lamps hang from two of the pendants; because one lamp is smaller than the other, the larger lamp is placed farther away so that it appears the same size as the smaller; some suggest that this is a deliberate flaw to reflect that God alone is perfect.\n\nCorner squinches also have pendants completing the feeling of looking into a dome.\n\nInscription says, “Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.\n\nExcept for this door there is no resting-place for my head.\n\nThe work of the slave of the portal, Masqud Kashani,” and the date, 946, in the Muslim calendar.\n\nThe word “slave” in the inscription has been variously interpreted, but generally it is agreed that he was not a slave in the literal sense, but someone who was charged with executing the carpet.\n\nBahram Gur was an ancient Iranian king from the Sassanian dynasty.\n\nHe represents the ideal king; wears a crown and a golden halo.\n\nMongol artists of Persia sought to link themselves to great ancient Persian heroes shown as Mongol horsemen.\n\nA karg is a kind of unicorn or horned wolf he fought during his trip to India.\n\nCross-cultural influences are Bahram Gur wears a garment of European fabric; Chinese landscape conventions can be seen in the background; these aspects connect the painting with trade along the Silk Road.\n\nIts lavish production suggests it was commissioned by a high-ranking Ilkhanid court official and produced at the court scriptorium as a chronicle of great Persian kings.\n\nA high point of Persian manuscripts; very lavish.\n\nThe original story by Firdawsi was written around 1010.\n\nFolio from the text called the Great Ilkhanid Shahnama, or the Book of Kings, a Persian epic.\n\nOriginally one of 280 folios by several different artists; 57 pages survive.\n\nThis excerpt shows the first king of Iran, Gayumars, enthroned before his community, ruling from a mountaintop.\n\nDuring his reign, men learned how to prepare food and prepare leopard skins as clothing; wild animals are shown as meek and submissive.\n\nOn left, his son Siyamak; on right, his grandson Hushang.\n\nHis court appears in a semicircle below him; court attire includes the wearing of leopard skins.\n\nThe angel Surush tells Gayumars that his son will be murdered by the Black Div, son of the demon Ahriman; his death will be avenged by Hushang, who will rescue the Iranian throne.\n\nKaaba means cube in Arabic; the Kaaba is cube-like in shape.\n\nKaaba said to have been built by Ibrahim (Abraham, in the Western tradition) and Ishamel for God\n\nExisting structure encases the black stone in the eastern corner, the only part of the original structure by Ibrahim that survives.\n\nHas been repaired and reconstructed many times since Muhammad’s time.\n\nThis building houses several sacred sites:\n\nThe place where Adam was born.\n\nThe site in which Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac.\n\nThe place where Muhammad ascended to heaven (as described in the Qu’ran).\n\nThe place where the Temple of Jerusalem was located.\n\nMeant to rival the Christian church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, although it was inspired by its domed rotunda.\n\nArabic calligraphy on the mosaic decoration urges Muslims to embrace Allah as the one God and indicates that the Christian notion of the Trinity is an aspect of polytheism.\n\nOldest surviving Qur’an verses; first use of Qur’an verses in architecture; one of the oldest Muslim buildings.\n\nErected by Abd al-Malik, caliph of the Umayyad Dynasty.\n\nLarge central rectangular courtyard surrounded by a two-story arcade.\n\nTypical of Muslim architecture is to have one large arch flanked by two stories of smaller arches\n\nThe qibla iwan is the largest and most decorative; its size indicates the direction to Mecca.\n\nSouthern iwan is an entry for a private space used by the sultan and his retinue; its dome is adorned by decorative tiles; this contains the main mihrab of the mosque.\n\nMuqarnes: an ornamental and intricate vaulting placed on the underside of arches.\n\nElaborately decorated mihrab on the interior points the direction to Mecca; the elaborateness reflects the fact that this is the holiest section of the shrine.\n\nPerhaps used as a music room or for receptions.\n\nThe hall is so named because of two big twin marble flagstones placed on the floor.\n\nIn between these flagstones is a small fountain and a short canal from which water flows to the Court of the Lions.\n\nThe hall was built by order of Mohammed V.\n\nTranslated to mean “crown palace.”\n\nNamed for Mumtaz Mahal, deceased wife of Shah Jahan, who died while giving birth to her 14th child.\n\nPart of a larger ensemble of buildings.\n\nGrounds represent a vast funerary garden, the gardens found in heaven in the Islamic tradition.\n\nTaj Mahal reflected in the Charbagh garden\n\nDifferent from other Mongol buildings in its extensive use of white marble, which was generally reserved for interior spaces; white marble contrasts with the red sandstone of the flanking buildings.\n\nInfluence of Hindi texts in which white is seen as a symbol of purity for priests and red for warriors; the Taj Mahal is white marble but the surrounding buildings are red sandstone.\n\nHinduism and Buddhism are the major influences on Indian art\n\nThe Ajanta and Ellora caves are famous for their rock-cut architecture and paintings\n\nMughal art is known for its intricate miniature paintings and calligraphy\n\nThe Taj Mahal is a famous example of Mughal architecture\n\nIndian art is characterized by bright colors, intricate patterns, and religious themes\n\nStatue thought to have been blessed by the Buddha himself;

restored in 2003.\n\nEnshrined in the Jokhang Temple, Tibet’s earliest and foremost Buddhist temple.\n\nThree umbrellas at the top represent Buddha, Buddha’s law, and monastic orders.\n\nA railing at the crest of the mound surrounds the umbrellas, symbolically representing a sacred tree.\n\nDouble stairway at the south end leads from base to drum, where there is a walkway for circumambulation.\n\nOriginally painted white.\n\nHemispherical dome is a replication of the dome of heaven. Seated Buddha from second level from the Later Gupta period.\n\nThis massive Buddhist monument contains 504 life-size Buddhas, 1,460 narrative relief sculptures on 1,300 panels 8,200 feet long.\n\n72 openwork stupas containing a Buddha, each with a preaching mudra.\n\nSix identical square terraces are placed one atop the other, like steps;\n\nthree smaller circular terraces are placed on top;\n\nthe lowest level functions as the base of the structure, with a square floor plan;\n\nthe second level recedes 23 feet from the edge of the base so that the space is wide enough for processions.\n\nEach terrace is a level of enlightenment.\n\nOn the top is an enclosed stupa.\n\nDivided into three sections, representing three levels of Buddhist cosmology:\n\nBase: represents the lowest level of experience;\n\nthose who are aligned with their desires on Earth;\n\nthe world of desire and negative impulses;\n\nsculptures here show the deeds of self-sacrifice practiced by the ­Buddha in his previous births and the story of his last incarnation as Prince Siddhartha.\n\nBody: five terraces in which people abandon their earthly desires;\n\nthis is the world of forms—people have to control these negative impulses;\n\nsculptures here show the pilgrimage of the young man, Sudhana, who sets out in search of the Ultimate Truth.\n\nSuperstructure: an area that represents a formless world, in which a person experiences reality in its purest stage, where the physical world and worldly desire are expunged.\n\nShiva has four hands.\n\nOne hand sounds the drum that he dances to; another carries a flame of destruction; the other two offer the abhaya mudra, a gesture that allays fear.\n\nEpicene quality showing an idealized, nearly nude, male figure.\n\nFlying locks of hair terminate in rearing cobra heads. Often depicted in a flaming nimbus, vigorously dancing with one foot on a dwarf, the Demon of Ignorance.\n\nFire around Shiva represents the borders of the Hindu cosmos; covered with flowers when carried in processions.\n\nThe sculpture becomes the receptacle for the divine spirit when people pray before it; therefore, the sculpture is royally treated with gifts, food, and incense.\n\nThe sculpture can be bathed and clothed.\n\nA hole is at the bottom of the sculpture for the placement of a pole so that it can be used in processions and covered by flowers.\n\nShiva periodically destroys the universe so that it can be reborn again.\n\nHe unfolds the universe out of the drum held in one of his right hands; he preserves it by uplifting his other right hand in a gesture indicating “do not be afraid.”\n\nShiva has a third eye barely suggested between his other two eyes; he once burned the god Kama with this eye.\n\nThe message is that belief in Shiva can achieve salvation.\n\nThe distribution of this figure due to the patronage of a queen, Mahadevi.\n\nThe temple is placed on a high pedestal, or plinth, to be seen from a distance. It appears like rising peaks of a mountain range.\n\nCompact proportions.\n\nEast/west axis: it receives direct rays from the rising sun.\n\nThe building is a series of shapes that build to become a large tower; complicated intertwining of similar forms called a shikara.\n\nIn the center is the “embryo” room containing the shrine.\n\nThe embryo, called a garbha griha, is very small with only space enough for a limited number of people. It is meant for individual—not congregational—worship.\n\nJahangir is the source of all light; he is surrounded by a halo of the sun and moon.\n\nJahangir is near the end: seated on an hourglass throne; sands of time running out.\n\nJahangir wears a single pearl as a devotion to an eleventh century saint.\n\nSufi Sheik is handed a book by Jahangir, or perhaps the holy man is handing Jahangir the book—the book is placed on a cloth so that the sheik does not touch Jahangir.\n\nThe sheik was the superintendent of the shrine at Ajmer, where Jahangir lived from 1613–1616.\n\nHoly men are placed above and rank higher than all others; the painting is thought to represent the importance of spiritual life over worldly power.\n\nThe Ottoman sultan (not a real portrait) is placed higher than James I, but shows deference to Jahangir.\n\nJames I of England is in the lower left-hand corner; less important than Jahangir, as his position implies; the portrait based on a diplomatic gift probably by artist John de Critz, given by ambassador Sir Thomas Roe.\n\nThe artist, a Hindu, holds a miniature with two horses and an elephant—perhaps gifts from his patron.\n\nThe artist is in lower left-hand corner; he symbolically signs his name on the footstool beneath Jahangir.\n\nJahangir had many artists follow him wherever he went; he wanted everything recorded.\n\nHe sought to bring together things from distant lands.\n\nCross-cultural influences from Europe: a Renaissance carpet is in the background; figures of small cherubs are copied from European paintings; there is a halo behind Jahangir.\n\nGreat interest in the Mughal court for European allegorical portraits, techniques, and motifs.\n\nLargest and most complete Chinese architectural ensemble in existence.\n\n9,000 rooms.\n\nWalls were built 30 feet high to keep outside people out and those inside in.\n\nEach corner of the rectangular plan has a tower representing one of the four corners of the world.\n\nThe focus is on the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the throne room and seat of power; it is a wooden structure made with elaborately painted beams; meant for grand ceremonies.\n\nYellow tile roofs and red painted wooden beams placed on marble foundations unify the structures in the Forbidden City into an artistic whole; yellow is the emperor’s color.\n\nCalled “Forbidden” in that no one could enter or leave the inner sanctuaries without official permission.\n\nThe throne room was placed symbolically at the center.\n\nThe emperor is associated with the dragon: sits on a dragon throne, wears dragon-themed robes.\n\nAnimals and figures on the roof were placed to ward off fire and evil spirits.\n\nThe surrounding wall of the Forbidden City is characteristic of a Chinese city: privacy within provides protection and reflects the containment aspect of Chinese culture.\n\nMandate of Heaven: heaven bestows a mandate on the emperor, who rules with divine blessing as the Son of Heaven; as a result, his Forbidden City was a reflection of heaven itself.\n\nVery complex landscape.\n\nDifferent brushstrokes describe different kinds of trees: coniferous, deciduous, etc.\n\nThe long waterfall on the right is balanced by a mountain on the left; the waterfall accents the height of the mountain; embodying the essence of a place rather than likeness.\n\nNot a pure landscape: donkeys laden with firewood are driven by two men; a small temple appears in the forest; people seen as small and insignificant in a vast natural world.\n\nMists, created by ink washes, silhouette the roof of the temple.\n\nKorean prime minister (1461–1464 and 1471–1475); scholar and soldier, involved in creating the modern Korean alphabet.\n\nThe portrait was made when he was a second-grade civil officer: insignia, or rank badge, designed with clouds and a wild goose.\n\nKorean portraits emphasize how the subject made a great contribution to the country and how the spirit of loyalty to king and country was valued by Confucian philosophy.\n\nRepainted over the years, especially in 1475, when Sin Sukju died, as an act of reverence for a departed ancestor.\n\nPainted during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976; high art was dismissed as feudal or bourgeois; art was created to be of service to the state.\n\nBased on an oil painting by Liu Chunhua, which first appeared at the Beijing Museum of the Revolution in 1967.\n\nThis type of art was done anonymously; individual artistic fame was seen as countercultural in a collectivist society.\n\nA moment in the 1920s; Mao on his way to Anyuan to lead a miners’ strike.\n\nMao worked for reforms for miners; supported a local strike for better wages, working conditions, and education.\n\nFor many people, this action formed a permanent bond with the Communist Party.\n\nThe Buddha is arranged as if on an altar of a temple, deeply set into the rock face.\n\nVairocana Buddha is flanked by monk attendants, bodhisattvas, and guardians; perhaps a portrait of Wu Zetian.\n\nThe figures have elongated legs and exaggerated poses.\n\nSculptures and reliefs are carved from the existing rock—some colossal, some small.\n\nRealistic musculature of the heavenly guardians shows them as able protectors and ­defenders of the faith.\n\nThe blue color was imported from Iran; Chinese expansion into western Asia made the cobalt blue available.\n\nThe vases were modeled after bronzes of the same type.\n\nThe necks and feet of the vases contain leaves and flowers.\n\nThey have elephant-head-shaped handles.\n\nCentral section: Chinese dragons with traditional long bodies and beards; dragons have scales and claws, and are set in a sea of clouds.\n\nThis is the main gate of Todai-ji.\n\nNandaimon: great south gate, with five bays—three central bays for passing and two outer bays that are closed.\n\nThe two stories are the same size: unusual in Japanese architecture (usually the upper story is smaller).\n\nDeep eaves are supported by the six-stepped bracket complex, which rise in tiers with no bracketed arms.\n\nThe roof is supported by huge pillars.\n\nUnusual in that it has no ceiling; the roof is exposed from below.\n\nOverall effect is of proportion and stateliness.\n\nA narrative work that is read from right to left as the scroll is unrolled.\n\nPoint of view: one looks down from above onto the scene, which takes place in Kyoto.\n\nStrong diagonals emphasize movement and action.\n\nSwift, active brushstrokes.\n\nDepersonalized figures; many with only one stroke for the eyes, ears, and mouth.\n\nTangled mass of forms accentuated by Japanese armor.\n\nFinal scene: lone archer leads the escape from the burning palace with the Japanese commander behind him.\n\nMilitary rule in Japan from 1185 on had an interest in the code of the warrior; reflected in the large quantity of war-related literature and paintings.\n\nScroll depicts a coup staged in 1159 as Emperor Go-Shirakawa is taken prisoner.\n\nBurning of the imperial palace at Sanjô in Kyoto as rebel forces try to seize power by capturing a retired emperor.\n\nImperial palace in flames; rebels force the emperor to board a cart waiting to take him into captivity.\n\nRebels kill those opposed and place their heads on sticks and parade them as trophies.\n\nPainted a hundred years after the civil war depicted in the scene.\n\nUnrolls like a film sequence; as one unrolls, time advances.\n\nA stream cuts rhythmically through the scene; swirls in the paint surface indicate water currents.\n\nWhite plum blossoms on left; red on right.\n\nThe artist worked in vivid colors or ink monochrome on gold ground.\n\nThis work has more abstracted and simplified forms than the compositions of Ogata’s predecessors.\n\nOld tree on left is balanced by new tree on right.\n\nJapanese rinpa style named for Ogata (Rin, for Ko-rin, and pa, meaning “school”).\n\nThe work is influenced by the yamato-e style of painting.\n\nTarashikomi technique, in which paint is applied to a surface that has not already dried from a previous application; creates a dripping effect, useful in depicting streams or flowers.\n\nThe artist was a member of a Kyoto family of textile merchants that serviced samurai, a few nobility, and city dwellers.\n\nEach wood-block print required the collaboration of a designer, an engraver, a printer, and a publisher.\n\nConceived of as a commercial opportunity by the publisher, who may have doubled as a book dealer.\n\nThe publisher determined the theme.\n\nThe print was designed by an artist on paper, and then an engraver copied the design onto a woodblock.\n\nThe printer rubs ink onto the block and places paper over the block to make a print.\n\nMany colored prints were made by using a separate block for each color.\n\nPrussian blue was highly prized in Japan; acquired through trade with Europe.\n\nThey use natural materials such as wood, bark, shells, feathers, and fibers.\n\nThese materials are often sourced from the local environment and have cultural significance to the communities that use them.\n\nWood is a particularly important material in Pacific art, used for carving sculptures, masks, and canoes.\n\nBark cloth, made from the inner bark of trees, is used for clothing, bedding, and ceremonial purposes.\n\nShells and feathers are used for adornment and decoration.\n\nPacific art is characterized by a range of techniques that are specific to different cultures and regions.\n\nFor example, in Maori culture, the technique of \"whakairo\" involves carving intricate patterns and designs into wood.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, the \"bilum\" technique is used to create woven bags and baskets using a looping technique.\n\nIn Fiji, the \"masi\" technique is used to create bark cloth by pounding and stretching the inner bark of trees.\n\nThese techniques are often passed down through generations and have cultural significance to the communities that use them.\n\nRed was considered a royal color in Polynesia; yellow was prized because of its rarity.\n\nThe cape was created by artists who chanted the wearer’s ancestors to imbue their power onto it.\n\nIt protected the wearer from harm.\n\nThe concept of “mana:” a supernatural force believed to dwell in a person or sacred object.\n\nMany capes have survived, but no two capes are alike.\n\nLarge, column-like, wooden core mounted upright in village common spaces; the wooden core is wrapped with tapa cloth.\n\nThe wooden sculpture placed on top features a large carved head with several smaller figures carved below it).\n\nThe shaft is in the form of an elongated body.\n\nThe lower end had a carved phallus. Some missionaries removed and destroyed the phalluses, considering them obscene.\n\nThe soul of the god is represented by polished pearl shells and red feathers, which are placed inside the bark cloth next to the interior shaft.\n\nMost staff gods were destroyed; only the top ends were retained as trophies.\n\nThis is the only surviving wrapped example of a staff god.\n\nIn the contextual image from a book by an English missionary (not shown), the staff gods have been thrown down in the village square in front of a European-style church; it represents the fall of one faith and the adoption of another.\n\nThe contextual image is the only visual evidence that indicates how these staff gods were used.\n\nReverend John Williams observed that the barkcloth contained red feathers and pieces of pearl shell, known as the manava or the spirit of the god. He also recorded seeing the islanders carrying the image upright on a litter.\n\nThe painter was born in Bohemia and was famous for portraits of Maori chieftains upon his arrival in New Zealand in 1873–1874 until his death in 1926.\n\nHe was a journeyman painter and tradesman who worked on commission.\n\nThis is a European-style painting in its use of oil paint, canvas backing, coloring, modeling, shading, and atmospheric perspective.\n\nConflicting interpretations of works such as these:\n\nMaori may see the portraits as an embodiment of the spirit of a person, and as a link between past and present.\n\nWesterners may see the paintings as a commercial adventure with a monetary value.\n\nSome may see the portrait as a record of a vanishing culture.\n\nOthers may interpret the work as anthropology highlighting aspects of Maori costuming and physiognomy, and what they could mean.\n\nStill others may see the portraits as expressions of colonial dominance.\n\nMalagan ceremonies send the souls of the deceased on their way to the otherworld.\n\nSometimes ceremonies begin months after death and last an extended period of time.\n\nDuring the time after death the sponsors must organize the ceremonies and the feasts. They must also hire the sculptors who will carve the structures for the event.\n\nAn expensive undertaking: families often combine their wealth and honor several individuals.\n\nThe commissioned malagan sculptures are exhibited in temporary display houses. Each sculpture honors a specific individual and illustrates his or her relationships with ancestors, clan totems, and/or living family members.\n\nDuring the course of the ceremony it is believed that the souls of the deceased enter the sculptures.\n\nThe ceremonies free the living from the obligation of serving the dead.\n\nStructures are erected to suit a purpose; after the ceremony, the structures are considered useless and usually destroyed or allowed to rot—they have fulfilled their function.\n\nThere are about 900 statues in all, 50 tons apiece, mostly male; almost all facing inland.\n\nThey were erected on large platforms, called ahu, of stone mixed with ashes from cremations; the platforms are as sacred as the statues that are on them.\n\nAfter being carved, figures were said to have been “walked” into place from where they were quarried.\n\nBeneath an ahu is a cemetery where village elders were buried.\n\nThe depletion of resources may have caused an ecological crisis which led to a decline in society and the destruction of the monuments.\n\nMonuments were toppled face down because it was believed that the eyes had spiritual power.\n\nRepresentation matters: Art should reflect the diversity of the world we live in.\n\nAccessibility: Art should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or abilities.\n\nIntersectionality: Recognize and celebrate the intersection of different identities and experiences.\n\nEducation: Educate yourself and others on the importance of inclusivity in art.\n\nCollaboration: Work with artists from diverse backgrounds to create inclusive art.\n\nEmpathy: Approach art with empathy and an open mind to understand different perspectives.\n\nCritique: Critique art through an inclusive lens to identify and challenge biases and stereotypes.\n\nFound objects: Artists often use found objects such as discarded materials, everyday objects, and natural materials to create their works. This approach is known as \"found object art\" or \"readymade art\" and was popularized by artists such as Marcel Duchamp.\n\nMixed media: Mixed media art involves the use of multiple materials and techniques to create a single work of art. This can include anything from paint and collage to sculpture and installation.\n\nDigital media: With the rise of digital technology, many contemporary artists are using digital media such as video, animation, and interactive installations to create their works.\n\nCollage: Collage involves the layering of different materials and images to create a new composition. This can be done using traditional materials such as paper and glue, or digitally using software such as Photoshop.\n\nPerformance art: Performance art involves the use of the artist's body as a medium to create a live performance. This can include anything from dance and theater to political protests and social commentary.\n\nInstallation art: Installation art involves the creation of a three-dimensional environment or space that the viewer can interact with. This can include anything from large-scale sculptures to immersive multimedia installations.\n\nAbstract art: Abstract art is characterized by the use of non-representational forms and colors to create a purely visual experience. This can include anything from geometric shapes and patterns to gestural brushstrokes and splatters.\n\nRealism: Realism involves the creation of art that accurately represents the world as it appears to the artist. This can include anything from hyper-realistic paintings to detailed sculptures.\n\nConceptual art: Conceptual art is characterized by the use of ideas and concepts as the primary focus of the artwork. This can include anything from text-based works to performance art that explores philosophical or political themes.\n\nThe building has swirling forms and shapes that contrast with the industrial landscape of Bilbao.\n\nFrom the river side, the building resembles a boat, referencing Bilbao’s past as a shipping and commercial center.\n\nThe curving forms were designed by a computer software program called Catia.\n\nFixing clips make a shallow dent in the titanium surface; it produces an effect of having a shimmering surface that changes according to atmospheric conditions.\n\nCurvilinear forms evoke the architecture of Borromini and the Italian Baroque in general\n\nMaya Lin is an Ohio-born Chinese-American.\n\nThis was the winning design in an anonymous competition held to create a memorial on the mall in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe work is not an overly political monument with a message, but a memorial to the deceased who sacrificed everything.\n\nOne arm of the monument points to the Lincoln Memorial, the other to the Washington Monument, placing itself central to key figures in American history.\n\nIt digs into the earth like a scar, a scar that heals but whose traces remain, a reflection of the impact of the war on the American consciousness.\n\nStrongly influenced by the Minimalist movement.\n\nInitially strongly criticized by those who wanted a more traditional war monument; later, a figural grouping was placed nearby.\n\nThe figure sits on a low stretcher of wooden legs, substituting for human legs.\n\nThe figure is hollowed out, just a shell.\n\nThe figure is placed to be seen in the round: the complete back and the hollow front are visible.\n\nThe pose suggests meditation and/or perseverance.\n\nSexual characteristics are minimized to increase the universality of the ­figure; hence the title Androgyne, or an androgynous figure, one that is neither male nor female.\n\nJeff Koons is a Pennsylvania-born artist, working in New York.\n\nThis work is a commentary on celebrity romance, sexuality, commercialism, stereotypes, pop culture, and sentimentality.\n\nThe work is kitsch but is made of “high art” porcelain.\n\nCreates a permanent reality out of something that is ephemeral and never meant to be exhibited.\n\nPart of a series called The Banality at a show in the Sonnenbend Gallery in New York in 1988.\n\nThis image explores the theme of the Old Testament figure Judith decapitating Holofernes (from the Book of Judith).\n\nThe richness of the costuming and the setting acts as a commentary on late-nineteenth-century versions of this subject.\n\nRichly decorative drapes hang behind the figure.\n\nJudith lacks any emotional attachment to the murder that has taken place.\n\nJudith uses her sexuality to attract and slay Holofernes.\n\nHolofernes appears masklike, alert, and nearly bloodless.\n\nRed garments denote lust and blood.\n\nCindy Sherman is a New Jersey–born American artist.\n\nThe artist appears as the photographer, subject, costumer, hairdresser, and makeup artist in each work.\n\nThe artist expresses the artifice of art by revealing the props used in the process.\n\nThe artist’s work comments on gender, identity, society, and class distinction.\n\nThe artist uses old master paintings as a starting point, but the works are not derivative.\n\nThis series sheds a modern light on the great masters in this case Italian Baroque.\n\nFigures in Ringgold’s works often act out a history that might never have taken place, but that the artist would have liked to have taken place.\n\nThe artist created a character named Willia Marie Simone, a young black artist who moves to Paris. She takes her friend and three daughters to the Louvre museum and dances in front of three paintings by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nThe story is spelled out in text written on the borders of the quilt.\n\nThis is the first of twelve quilts in a series.\n\nJaune Quick-to-See Smith is a member of the Salish and Kootenai American Indian tribes of the Flathead Nation.\n\nThe work was meant as the “Quincentenary Non-Celebration” of European occupation of North America (1492–1992).\n\nAmerican Indian social issues caused by European occupation are stressed: poverty, unemployment, disease, alcoholism.\n\nTitle Trade references events in American Indian history such as Manhattan being sold to the Dutch in 1626 for $24.\n\nEven if this story is apocryphal, it does highlight a history of “trade” in which Indians have been taken advantage of.\n\nThe poem written on the face is in Farsi, the Persian language; the poem expresses piety.\n\nThe poem is by an Iranian woman who writes poetry on gender issues.\n\nThe gun divides the body into a darker and a lighter side.\n\nThe gun adds a note of ominous tension in the work.\n\nThe work expresses the artist’s duality as both Iranian and American.\n\nShirin Neshat is an Iranian-born artist, raised in the United States.\n\nChador: a type of outer garment, like a cloak, that allows only the face and hands of Iranian women to be seen.\n\nThe chador keeps women’s bodies from being seen as sexual objects.\n\nWesterners could view the work as an expression of female oppression.\n\nIranians could view the work as an image of an obedient, right-minded woman who is ready to die defending her faith and customs.\n\nThe work contrasts with stereotypical Western depictions of exotic female nudes in opulent surroundings\n\nMichel Tuffery was born in New Zealand of Samoan, Cook Islands, and Tahitian descent.\n\nThe artist is interested in exploring aspects of his Polynesian heritage in a modern context.\n\nCanned corned beef is a favorite food in Polynesia; exported from New Zealand.\n\nCanned meat (pisupo, a Samoan language variant of “pea soup,” the first canned food in the Pacific) is given as a gift on special occasions in Polynesia.\n\nHowever, canned meat has been a major contributor to Polynesian obesity.\n\nThe introduction of canned meat caused a fall in traditional cultural skills of fishing, cooking, and agriculture.\n\nThe artist introduces a tone of irony in that the cow is made of hundreds of opened cans of cow meat.\n\nThe theme of recycling is emphasized by the reuse of these cans.\n\nNeon lighting outlines 50 states and the District of Columbia (Alaska and Hawaii are on the side walls).\n\nEach state has a separate video feed; hundreds of television sets and 50 separate DVD players.\n\nThemes associated with each state play on the state’s screen; for example, the musical Oklahoma! plays on the Oklahoma screen.\n\nA camera is turned on the spectator and its TV feed appears on one of the monitors; it turns the spectator into a participant in the artwork.\n\nBill Viola is a Queens, New York–born artist.\n\nThe artist promotes video as an art form.\n\nThe work shows actions that repeat again and again.\n\nThe artist is interested in sense perceptions.\n\nThere is an implied cycle of purification and destruction.\n\nFilmed at high speed, but sequences are played back at super slow motion.\n\nEvokes Eastern and Western spiritual traditions: Zen Buddhism, Islamic Sufism, Christian mysticism.\n\nRequires the viewer to remain still and concentrate.\n\nMori herself appears as if in a vision in the guise of the Heian deity, Kichijōten.\n\nKichijōten is the essence of beauty and the harbinger of prosperity and happiness.\n\nShe holds a wish-granting jewel, a nyoi hōju, which has the power to deny evil and fulfill wishes.\n\nThe jewel symbolizes Buddha’s universal mind.\n\nAnimated figures of lighthearted aliens play musical instruments on clouds.\n\nA lotus blossom floats on water and symbolizes purity and rebirth into paradise.\n\nSet in a landscape evoking the Dead Sea, a place of extremely high salinity: salt seen as an agent of purification.\n\nKiki Smith is an American artist who was born in Germany and lives in New York City.\n\nA theme of Smith’s work is the human body; this is a nude female figure.\n\nFemale strength is emphasized in the woman lying down with the wild beast.\n\nThe wolf seems tamed by the woman’s embrace.\n\nThe wolf is traditionally seen as an evil or dangerous symbol, but not here.\n\nKara Walker is a California-born, New York–based, African-American artist.\n\nThe work explores themes of African-Americans in the antebellum South: a teenager holds a flag that resembles a colonial ship sail; one man has his leg cut off; a woman is caring for newborns.\n\nThe work explores how stereotypes and caricatures of African-Americans have been presented.\n\nInspired by an anonymous landscape called “Darkytown”; it was the artist’s invention to have the figures in rebellion.\n\nThis is not a recreation of an historical event, but a commentary on history as it has been presented in the past and the present.\n\nThe viewer interacts with the work, walking around it, engaging in elements of it; the viewer is part of the history of the piece.\n\nThis work depicts a stylized rendering of stadium architecture.\n\nThe forms suggest the excitement, almost frenzy, of a competition held in a circular space surrounded by international images.\n\nDynamic competition is suggested in sweeping lines that create a vibrant pulse.\n\nThe work uses multilayered lines to create ­animation.\n\nSweeping lines create depth; the focus of attention is around a central core from which colors, icons, flags, and symbols resonate.\n\nDoris Salcedo is a Colombian sculptor.\n\nShibboleth: a word or custom that a person not familiar with a language may mispronounce; used to identify foreigners or people of another class.\n\nA shibboleth is used to exclude people from joining a group.\n\nBible source: Judges 12:6: “They said, ‘All right, say Shibboleth.’ If he said, ‘Sibboleth,’ because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.”\n\nThe crack emphasizes the gap in relationships.\n\nThe work references racism and colonialism; keeping people away or separating them.\n\nThe installation is now sealed, but it exists as a scar; it commemorates the lives of the underclasses."
