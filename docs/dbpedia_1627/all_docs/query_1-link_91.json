But it's key to note that it's just an OPINION, a preference, a matter of likes and likes more.\n\nI don't care about the objective measurable differences between Nikon and Zeiss glass. I care about the way the images I shoot look in the end. I don't look at it as better or worse - I look at it like different flavors. I tend to like chocolate far more often than vanilla or strawberry, but that doesn't mean chocolate is BETTER, just that I like it more most of the time.\n\nSo the way I break down with lenses is that I have three Zeiss lenses, all in the wider end of the spectrum, all bought used. I'm mostly a wide angle shooter - it's how I see best and where I live. I have the Zeiss 21 f2.8, the 25 f2.8, and the 35 f2.0. The 25 is my most used lens - it's the worst of the three in terms of testing, but I don't care, it's a focal length I love as an every day lens and I think it renders beautifully and is easy to work with. Before this lens, I was often stuck between whether to take a 24 or 28 as a main all-day lens, but this is actually about 25.7 (according to Lloyd Chambers), so it sits nicely between the two and eliminates the need to decide. I just grab this and go. I use it for street and semi-macros and landscapes and everything in between and haven't found anything it doesn't do well. I could easily live with just this and something up around 100mm if I had to, but fortunately I don't have to!\n\nThe 21 is an amazing lens and I love it and use it whenever I have the chance - I almost always have it handy. But it's a bit wide for a primary every-day lens. I had a Nikon 20 f1.8 briefly, thinking it might be a nice economical (and smaller/lighter) alternative to the Zeiss, but I just didn't like it near as much. It's a fine lens, but most of the images I got from the Zeiss 21 had a look that I couldn't replicate with the Nikon, a combination of colors and clarity with distant subjects. The 35 is as nice a lens as I need, but I don't shoot with it much because it's just not a focal length I generally prefer. I had an RX1 that I loved (which was my first real exposure to both digital full frame and Zeiss) and when I sold it, I felt I should replace that camera with a lens that was at least close, and I did. I love it when I use it, but I don't use it that much. Fortunately, neither the 25 or 35 cost me all that much used. I saved a lot on the 21 too, but it was still an expensive piece of gear.\n\nI have a Rokinon 14mm, a Nikon 50 f1.4D, a couple of mostly neglected zooms, and various primes in the 85-180mm range, which I mostly use for candid portraits. All of my zooms and all of my longer lenses are Nikon except for a 90mm Tamron macro. Some are manual focus, most are auto-focus. If Zeiss made an AF lens at 100 or 135, I'd probably buy it. But I spend most of my time in that focal range doing candid portrait type of shooting and I'm just not good enough with manual focus for that kind of shooting at that focal length. So Nikon's auto-focus lenses are an easy call there...\n\nIt's not like I don't like Nikon's rendering - I just like Zeiss better. If Zeiss didn't exist, I'd happily be shooting Nikon lenses at 20, 24, 18, and 35mm. But Zeiss does exist and I just like the look of the files I produce with my Zeiss lenses than the alternatives. I don't even care if I'm being logical or rational or not - I've been shooting in one form or another since the late 1960's and I feel I have a somewhat discerning, if not overly-technical, eye. I can't talk about optical qualities in any sort of technical way. But I know what I like. And I don't care of other's like the same thing or even if they think I shouldn't like what I like - I still like it...\n\n-Ray\n\nRay S.\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.5 #9 · p.5 #9 · Nikkor vs. Zeiss\n\nAndre Labonte wrote:\n\nThe short version: I've not seen any convincing data that the rendering differences are noticeable to the point that it would pass a double blind test. If it can't do that, then the differences really are meanings.\n\nOh well, it was an interesting topic, but I guess without seeing some extraordinary data (which is not likely to happen in a web forum) or a double blind test (even less likely) I guess I will never truly know. In the mean time, I remain highly skeptical.\n\nYou're looking for DATA and double blind tests, which really sort of misses the point. When I first had the RX1, I liked the 35mm Sonnar quite a lot initially, but it was only after shooting with it for a few weeks and even months that it really grew on me to the point of seeing the \"character\" of the lens, which I fell in love with. I lusted after my wife when I first met her too, but it took some time to really see and fall in love with her unique character. And it's nothing I can explain or quantify. And, again, I'm not saying it's \"BETTER\", just different, and in a way I prefer. I've had similar experiences with the Zeiss 21 and 25 on my Nikon, but since I'd become familiar with the Zeiss rendering, it happened a bit quicker. And, yet, those lenses have a somewhat different character than the Sonnar 35 on the RX1, but they still clearly have that Zeiss look and feel.\n\nLooking at it the way you're looking at it, you could only be skeptical and dubious. It's something you either see and care about it, or you either don't see it or don't care about it. In which case it would never be worth it. OTOH, except for the Otus lenses, the Zeiss lenses aren't really more expensive than their high end Nikon counterparts. The Zeiss 25 f2.0 is similar in cost to the Nikon 24 f1.4 - the Zeiss 25 f2.8 is considerably less expensive. The Zeiss 85 f1.4 (non-Otus version) is a bit less expensive than the Nikon 85 f1.4. The Zeiss 135 is considerably more than the Nikon 135 DC lens, but it's a whole different level of lens and I suspect if Nikon ever gets around to their long rumored 135 replacement, it'll be a lot closer in price to the Zeiss...\n\n-Ray\n\npanos.v\n\nOnline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.5 #10 · p.5 #10 · Nikkor vs. Zeiss\n\nAndre Labonte wrote:\n\nHmmm ... interesting.\n\nIf what you say is correct, then that confirms for ME, that the right thing to do is not go Zeiss.

If you cannot there is no point. If you cannot manual focus, it is irrelevant. If it is too heavy or big (as is the case with some lenses), again it is irrelevant whether it is theoretically better or not, you won't use it.\n\nAs for the double bling test and whatever, with the exception of sharpness which you may or may not see a difference depending on the lens, as I said before the main benefits of Zeiss are things like rendering, contrast and colour. These are things that a double blind test will likely not pick up but you only get a feel after shooting extensively with these lenses. Then after a year you can look at, say, this year's shots with the Zeiss and last year's shots with the Nikon/Canon/Leica/whatever and then as a whole you will start noticing the patterns and differences. Once you see them they are obvious but no blind test with 20 shots will ever show them.\n\nI mean, even a blind test won't tell you anything about sharpness. The 28/2 has field curvature as one of its main \"assets\" for the way it renders. That means it is crap for test chart shooting. The 50/1.4 has a certain look wide open which is far from sharp. Again, that's one of its features yet it would be considered poor with normal tests. And so on.\n\nAnyway, in the end if you take a Nikon 105 and a Zeiss 100 you can still make fantastic images with either. My photos did not dramatically improve when I bought a Zeiss neither did I suddenly get masterpieces when I bought the Leicas (though my wife is convinced that the 50 Summicron makes wrinkles go away which is fine by me and another reason to buy more Leicas...mwahahahahahah)."
