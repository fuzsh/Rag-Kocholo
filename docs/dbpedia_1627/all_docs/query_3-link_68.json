        "text": "<p>Since it's raining and I was pretty bored this afternoon, I decided to put together a snapshot of the different variations of the Nikon F-mount lenses as sort of a quick reference for identification purposes. I thought it might be handy for whenever the \"what type of lens is this/what lens can I use\" questions come up.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone think of anything that has been left out? I had to lump the AIS and AF/AF-d lenses together because I don't actually own any Nikon manual focus lenses in AIS mount.</p>\n\n<p>I put a larger version in my portfolio. <a href=\"../photo/12077503\"><strong>(Link)</strong></a></p><div> </div>\n\n<p>The earliest F-mount lenses had triangular prongs instead of the rounded ones more often seen. But that's just a cosmetic difference.</p>\n\n<p>You point out (correctly) that AI-S shows the minimum aperture in orange, but you might also note that non-AI lenses only have one row of aperture numbers (or, to put it another way, that AI introduced the second row of numbers).</p>\n\n<p>One problem with your presentation is that the four lenses you are using have many differences other than the mount. I don't know which lenses you're using offhand, but they don't look very similar. Four closely-related lenses (which you may not have) would have shown the differences more clearly.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone's a critic, I know… but AF-D lenses should have CPU contacts too, right? IMO there are enough less important distinctions that leaving it at the four major categories is more than enough… but perhaps take a shot looking straight down on the lens and orient them all the same way instead?</p>\n\n<p>To further my pedantic causes the solid vs holed aperture prong is a bit of a non-issue for any modern camera. An old non-AI lens that's been converted (and maybe some of the early AI?) would/may have solid prongs, and an Ai-S compatible Series E lens will have no prongs.</p>\n\n<p>Jay: Also the second generation Cosina (SL II / ZF.2) lenses. But the D200 seems to identify mine as an auto focus lens in the EXIF data. </p>\n\n<p>Hmmm... maybe I should put a disclaimer on there somewhere. </p>\n\n<p>I had originally intended to include only non-AI (1959 and later), AI, and AIS lenses (hence the no CPU contacts on the AF-d lens shot), but it looked kinda silly with only three pictures, so I included the AF-S lens at the last moment for more aesthetic purposes than anything else. The reason behind concentrating on those three types is that they are the one's most commonly confused due to the lack of designations on the lens barrels. Nikon definitely doesn't have a problem putting lettering on newer lenses these days, and the older models and shift lenses are either rare enough, or specialized to the point that they don't come up that often.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I should have been a bit more specific in that I was really asking about anything in the pictures I provided that should also be labeled, rather than other lens types that might have been left out. I thought about trying to include other types, but adding more lenses would have made things really small if I were to stay within the posting limits for posting in threads, so I went with the more popular types. Also, I don't own any of those other types of lenses, so I'd have had to steal pictures from the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, like I said in the original post, this was a project born more out of boredom than anything else. I thought maybe it would come in handy if someone asked about lens types, as does come up every now and then. I did learn one thing today, though, in that apparently Nikon has finally discontinued the lens type notch in the G-type lenses after not producing a camera body that actually used that info in the last 25 years or so. I never noticed that before.</p>"
