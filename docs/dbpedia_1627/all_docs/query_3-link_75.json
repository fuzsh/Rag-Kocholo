Even if you go with the 58mm .95 Noct for the S digital system, that's more of a head scratcher than a legend, optically magnificent it though it may be.\n\nAlan9940\n\nJoined\n\nJun 17, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,248\n\nLocation\n\nArizona\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nFeb 15, 2021\n\n#8\n\nDon't know if I'd call 'em legendary, but two of my favorites are the 105/2.5 and the 20/4.\n\nAriston\n\nJoined\n\nJan 20, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n1,658\n\nLocation\n\nAtlanta\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nFeb 15, 2021\n\n#9\n\nThe 50mm, which is outstanding, has to have taken more photos than any other Nikon lens... if that counts as legendary.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 3, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,903\n\nLocation\n\nOlympia, Washington\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nFeb 15, 2021\n\n#10\n\nThe 50mm, which is outstanding, has to have taken more photos than any other Nikon lens... if that counts as legendary.\n\nWhich 50mm?

Personally, I prefer the macro for portraits and weddings because I need tight face shot and the macro focuses closer. Also, for weddings, I need a lens that can be used for portraits as well as ring close-ups.\n\nNikon 105mm Lenses by Narsuitus, on Flickr\n\nnarsuitus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 24, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n1,813\n\nLocation\n\nUSA\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nFeb 15, 2021\n\n#23\n\nThe rangefinder mount was different from the F mount though, weren't they?\n\nYes, they were different.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n12,920\n\nLocation\n\nIowa City, Iowa USA\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nFeb 15, 2021\n\n#24\n\nThe current 70 to 200 VR lens (not for film) is absolutely mind boggling.
