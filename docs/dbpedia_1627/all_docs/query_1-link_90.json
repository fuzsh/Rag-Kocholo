        "text": "Can't be done. There is no adapter to make the Z lens fit a DSLR. It only works with the FTZ adapter when mounting an F-mount lens to a mirrorless camera.\n\nYes, I have that FTZ adaptor. I was hoping there was a way to do the verse for the DSLR. I would buy one, in a heartbeat if Nikon or a third-party manufactured one. I hope it happens.\n\nYes, I have that FTZ adaptor. I was hoping there was a way to do the verse for the DSLR. I would buy one, in a heartbeat if Nikon or a third-party manufactured one. I hope it happens.\n\nGiven the 'advantage' of the Z lenses is that much larger diameter of the opening of camera and lens (camera end) -- can you tell I'm not an engineer -- I suspect a ZtF adapter simply wouldn't work or reduce the image size as the diameter was stepped down so much as to produce results not equal to simply using an f mount lens on the DSLR.\n\nThe issue is Z cameras have the shortest flange distance of current cameras. The FTZ adapter and adapters for other mounts, fills space (adds distance). While someone could technically make an adapter to fit the Z lens on a DSLR or other camera, it would be like adding an extension tube so you would be limiting the range the lens could focus.\n\nI just wrote to Nikon:\n\nIt would be wonderful if Nikon manufactured a \"reverse\" FTZ adaptor for Z lenses to be mounted on a DSLR (D850, D500, etc.). I currently own, the Z9, D5, and D850.\n\nI am sure that they would be a hot seller. I would buy one in a heartbeat. People with no interest in a mirrorless camera may be inclined to buy Z lenses due to the hype or reputation.\n\nIf I get a reply, I will post it.\n\nWhy would Nikon make such an adapter?\n\n(Theoretically it can be done with some complex optics in it that would make the Z lenses perform worse...).\n\nIt makes zero sense from a business point of view...\n\nYou want the shiny new lenses, you get the shiny new bodies as well .\n\nI don't agree with you. If that's the case, why did Nikon make the FTZ adapter? If you want a mirrorless camera, you would be forced to buy the new Z line of lenses.\n\nIt's not always about the mighty dollar. Keeping the customers satisfied, goes a long way.\n\nI don't agree with you. If that's the case, why did Nikon make the FTZ adapter?

It was an immediate bridge folks could use to get started with Mirrorless using their F mount lenses.\n\nThere is no way to adpat a Z mount lens to a DSLR without additional optics that may [likely] end up changing the focal length and aperture of the Z mount lens.\n\nI don't see any advantage to Nikon doing this.\n\nI just wrote to Nikon:\n\nIt would be wonderful if Nikon manufactured a \"reverse\" FTZ adaptor for Z lenses to be mounted on a DSLR (D850, D500, etc.).

People with no interest in a mirrorless camera may be inclined to buy Z lenses due to the hype or reputation.\n\nIf I get a reply, I will post it.\n\nI am virtually certain it would NOT be a hot seller. People are going mirrorless because of the advantages (real exposure in viewfinder, silent shutter, etc) of mirrorless bodies. The lenses are sharper when paired with a mirrorless body due to larger opening and shorter distance to sensor. There is no advantage that I know of to putting a mirrorless lens on an SLR. There are still plenty of great SLR Nikon lenses; currently a better selection than what is available for mirrorless (with the possible exception of the two super teles with built-in teleconverters).\n\nI don't agree with you.

Keeping the customers satisfied, goes a long way.\n\nThey made the FtZ adapter because their existing client base has invested in f mount lenses, all of which have fit every Nikon camera since forever, and the FtZ adapter doesn't degrade the performance of the f mount lenses (and in fact on Z cameras can enhance the performance of those lenses). The Z mount is about producing great quality images, allowing an improvement in lens optics; producing an adapter so it fits the technology it was meant to improve upon, and in doing so erasing those performance improvements, makes no sense.\n\nNikon made the FTZ adapter becasue there were only a couple of Z lenses when they introduced their mirrorless cams...and you can't sell many cameras that way.
