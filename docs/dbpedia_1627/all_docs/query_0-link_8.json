Through the powerful control of diaphragm blades, stable high-speed continuous shooting is enabled, even at smaller apertures*.\n\n*Some limitations apply.\n\nDistance information\n\nAll AF lenses, and PC and PC-E-series lenses provide the distance information output capability. Subject-to-camera distance information, obtained with an internal encoder, is transmitted to the camera body for the high-precision exposure control such as 3D Color Matrix Metering and i-TTL Balanced Fill-Flash.\n\nAF DC-NIKKOR lenses\n\nAF DC-NIKKOR lenses feature exclusive Nikon Defocus-image Control technology. This allows photographers to control the degree of spherical aberration in the foreground or background by rotating the lens' DC ring. This will create a rounded out-of-focus blur that is ideal for portrait photography. No other lenses in the world offer this special technique.\n\nMeniscus Protective Glass\n\nNIKKOR's exclusive protective glass for lenses comes attached to the front of fast super-telephoto lenses. Normal flat protective glass lets incoming light reflect off the surface of the image sensor or film, especially under a strong light source such as a spotlight. This then reflects again off the protective glass, resulting in a ghost effect. NIKKOR's curved meniscus glass dramatically reduces this re-reflected light, realizing clearer images with less ghosting.\n\nRounded Diaphragm\n\nWhen shooting with an ordinary diaphragm, blurry, polygon-shaped spots are likely to appear in images of scenes that include point light sources such as street lamps or holiday lighting at night. A rounded diaphragm is achieved by using specialized blades for a beautiful and naturally round shape for out-of-focus objects.\n\nMTF Chart\n\nMTF (Modulation Transfer Function) is one of the measurements that evaluate a lens' performance; it shows contrast reproducibility of the lens using characteristic spatial frequencies. Spatial frequencies indicate the number of lines per mm.\n\nIn the MTF chart of this website, the horizontal axis is in millimeters and shows the distance from the center of the image toward the edges, and contrast value (highest value is 1) is shown in the vertical axis, with fixed spatial frequencies of 10 lines/mm and 30 lines/mm.\n\nThe MTF chart for each lens is based on the value at the maximum aperture of the lens; the red line shows the spatial frequency of 10 lines/mm and the blue line, 30 lines/mm.\n\nIn the off-axis field, contrast reproducibility of the lens for sagittal direction and meridional direction varies with astigmatic affection. The path of 10 lines/mm indicates the contrast reproducibility of the lens (the higher and straighter is better). The higher and straighter the 30 lines/mm-path is, the higher the resolution of the lens.\n\nNote that the lens performance can not be measured only with MTF chart. Softening or blurring of color also governs measurement."
