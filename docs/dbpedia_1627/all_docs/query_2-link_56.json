I have been using Sony FF for longer than I can remember for my wedding business and am excited to come full circle (started with a Nikon FM a few centuries ago)\n\nI *love* my current lens setup for weddings and want to duplicate it as close as possible once the Nikons arrive.\n\nI shoot one body with the Sigma 85mm 1.4 and the other with the Tamron 28-200\n\nNot really familiar with what lenses will work with the new Zf, but I think this will work:\n\nSigma 85mm 1.4 with the FTZII adapter\n\nNikon Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-200mm VR\n\nAnything glaring that I am missing?\n\nExcited to participate here in this forum and learn\n\nThanks!\n\nGreg\n\nJust want to make sure\n\nswifty168\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #2 · p.1 #2 · Lens question for Nikon Zf\n\nHi Greg, just trying to understand you correctly.\n\nWhich Sigma 85mm f/1.4 do you have? If its in E-mount then you would use one of the third party E to Z adapters and not the FTZ I or II. Youd need to check compatibility list for the adapter you end up buying.\n\nBut since youre starting from scratch, I might suggest you try all Z lenses.\n\nThe Z 85mm f/1.8 is stellar but only f/1.8.\n\nThe Z 85mm f/1.2 is stellar-er/est but is bulky and expensive and may not balance well on a Zf. Might be ok with the extra grip extension though.\n\ngheller\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #3 · p.1 #3 · Lens question for Nikon Zf\n\nSorry, I will try to clarify. I use (and love) the Sigma f/1.4 on my Sony. I want to buy the Nikon mount version, but seems like I will need the FTZ adapter (which I am fine with).\n\nYes, I want 1.4 and don't want the weight (or cost) of the 1.2\n\nI am guessing the NIKKOR Z 24-200mm VR will work right on the body.\n\nThanks!\n\ngreg\n\nswifty168\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · Lens question for Nikon Zf\n\nAhh ok.\n\nFirstly any native Z mount lens from Nikon will be 100% compatible with Z bodies including the Zf. So yes, 24-200 Z will work perfectly.\n\nSecondly only Nikon AFS F-mount lenses are guaranteed to be fully compatible with Z bodies via FTZ. But having said that the majority of third party lenses for F mount also have no issues and those with issues are usually rectified via firmware.\n\nCheck this article:\n\nhttps://photographylife.com/nikon-ftz-adapter-lens-compatibility/amp#sigma-brand-lenses\n\nThe Sigma 85mm f/1.4 is listed as fully compatible on the latest firmware.\n\nNow the Zf is a new body so it may break a few things for third party lenses initially but theyre usually resolved via firmware. Theres no way to 100% guarantee things for third party lenses however.\n\nAcuteShadows\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: On\n\np.1 #6 · p.1 #6 · Lens question for Nikon Zf\n\nYou will probably need f/1.4 only for depth of field, not light.\n\nCheck the Nikkor Z f/1.8 S lenses, they have amazing quality in a lightweight package.\n\nIf you need shallow depth of field, consider the Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.2, and crop a little if necessary.\n\nAlso, I'd consider the Nikkor Z 28-75mm f/2.8 and the Nikkor Z 24-120mm f/4 S, unless you really need 200mm. At f/6.3, the 24-200mm may be too slow at the long end.\n\nThe Nikkor Z 24-120mm f/4 S is also a great (near) macro lens, as it has a 1/2.6 magnification at minimum focus distance.\n\nDesmolicious\n\nOffline\n\n     \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · Lens question for Nikon Zf\n\ngheller wrote:\n\nThank you very much for the information (and the link).\n\nI may check out the Z 85mm f/1.8 ~ perhaps the weight and compatibility factor will outweigh the faster 1.4\n\ngreg\n\nI would 100% get the Z 85 1.8 over a 3rd party 1.4 and FTZ adapter. I use the FTZ on my Z7, and pretty much it spoils the handling. It's for if you already have F mount lenses. I wouldn't buy it so I could also buy F mount lenses to use!\n\nAnd you'll never have to worry about possible compatibility issues."
