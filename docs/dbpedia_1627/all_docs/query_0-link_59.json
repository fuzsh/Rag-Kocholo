        "text": "​ Updated Oct. 17, 2023\n\nWith the longest-lived 35mm SLR bayonet-mount (1959-), Nikon has a vast catalog of manual focus F-mount lenses in a sometimes dizzying array of variations. This can make choosing the right one for you seem daunting. Hopefully, we can help you to find the most suitable candidates for your Nikon lens (Nikkor) arsenal. In this first article, we will search out the best bargains in single focal length (prime) lenses. \"Bargain\" is relative in this case to other Nikkors in the same focal length ;-). Nikkors generally have higher prices than other brands of vintage glass because the mount is still current and because of Nikon's reputation as the \"choice of pros\" over a period of many decades.\n\nNikkor Nomenclature\n\nManual focus F-mount Nikkors can first be separated into two major categories: 1) pre-AI (non-AI) and 2) AI. AI stands for Automatic Aperture Indexing, which debuted beginning in 1977. Before 1977, Nikkor lenses used a metering-prong (referred to as Rabbit Ears or the Crab Claw, colloquially) which was the means of communicating the lens aperture setting to the camera body for metering purposes. This slotted prong engaged a pin that protruded below the prism housing of the camera. To properly couple the lens to the camera, you had to: 1) set the lens to f/5.6, line the slot up with the pin while inserting the lens into the bayonet-mount camera, 2) turn the lens counter-clockwise to lock it into place, and 3) twist the aperture ring to minimum aperture and then back to maximum aperture to index the lens with the meter. This was called by Nikon the \"click-click\" procedure, and was given various other names by Nikon users ;-). It was anything but automatic. In 1966, Minolta had introduced its MC coupling for its Rokkor lenses, which was a simple tab on the aperture ring that engaged a spring-loaded collar with a tab on its new SRT SLR body. All you had to do was mount the lens, and the coupling & indexing took place automatically. Nikon basically copied this simple system in 1977 to quicken the lens indexing process.\n\nAI lenses will mount on any Nikon body, pre- or post-1977. Non-AI lenses, however can only be used on pre-1977 bodies or bodies with a flip-up AI tab (Nikkormat FT-3, Nikon EL2, FM, FE, F3, F4, Df). Mounting an unmodified pre-AI lens on Nikon bodies with fixed AI tabs WILL DAMAGE the camera and/or lens and will necessitate repairs. The greater mounting versatility of AI lenses thus makes them more popular and they have higher prices than pre-AI Nikkors do. This leads to our first bargain possibility: pre-AI lenses are a more cost-effective way to get into the Nikkor system, especially if you are using them on a mirrorless camera (no AI tabs to worry about on adapters). Another avenue available to the pre-AI user is conversion of the aperture ring to allow AI operation. Indeed, for many years, Nikon offered a factory AI conversion program where they would do an aperture ring swap to your lens. Unfortunately, this program is no longer offered and the few remaining conversion kits are rare and can be costly. Fortunately, though, most pre-AI aperture rings can be machined or have a tab added (commonly referred to as \"AI'd\") to permit full AI compatibility. We are happy to provide this service at 678 Vintage Cameras for $40 CAD per lens plus shipping. Feel free to contact us for details.\n\nOk, now that we have that out of the way, here are the different generations of manual focus Nikkor glass:\n\nAuto Nikkor (1959-71) - the original Nikkors introduced beginning in 1959 with the Nikon F. These lenses had a single-letter code following the NIKKOR on the filter ring that signified the number of optical elements in the lens (e.g. the 50mm f/2 had an \"H\" code signifying 6 (Hexa) elements). All single-letter lenses have single or double lens coatings (except the 28/2 N & 35/1.4 N Auto Nikkors, which were the first fully multi coated Nikkors even though they lack the \"C\" designation).\n\n\"C\" Nikkors (1971-74) - the \"C\" code signifying the use of multi coating began to be added after the original single-letter element# code starting in 1971. (The 50mm f/2 now had an H-C code designating it as a multi coated lens.)\n\nNew Nikkors (K) (1974-77) - In 1974, the modern look of Nikkors was introduced with the familiar ribbed-rubber focus ring and pyramid-knurled aperture ring. The letter-codes were eliminated. These are often referred to as \"K\" lenses by Nikonians. This is the final series of pre-AI Nikkors. Many of these designs were carried over into AI versions, requiring only the new-style aperture ring. Nikon Integrated Coating (NIC) was introduced as an improvement on the first-gen multi coating. All NIC Nikkors were color-balanced to provide color uniformity across the board, no matter which focal length was used.\n\nAI Nikkors (1977-81) - While many \"K\" Nikkor designs were initially carried over into AI form, \"value engineering\", Nikon's euphemism for cost-cutting started to creep in during the AI era. Most of this was cosmetic at first, but mount screws on the smaller lenses decreased from five to three in number. Further, optical formulas were simplified in many lenses, some of which offered improved performance, while in others it was clear that cost reduction was the goal and that brought a slight weakening of performance. Nevertheless, overall quality remained very high. Aperture Direct Readout (ADR) debuted, allowing aperture values to be displayed via a periscope into the viewfinder of the camera.\n\nSeries E (1979-1985) - This was a budget line of lenses designed to compete against third-party glass. Construction is lighter, and the 50/1.8 & 100/2.8 make do with single coatings, but performance of most focal lengths is remarkably good. Operation is as with AI-s Nikkors, but Series E lenses do not have the old-style Rabbit Ears and were not designated as Nikkors.\n\nAI-s Nikkors (1981-2006) - With the rise in popularity of Program and Shutter-priority auto exposure modes in the early '80s came the need to modify the aperture actuation of AI Nikkors from non-linear to linear. Translation: the method of controlling aperture now had to be more precise to enable accurate exposures in these modes. Another change was the machining of a little divot into the lens mounting flange that indicated the focal length of the lens to the camera thus indicating when higher shutter speeds would need to be set by the camera for longer focal lengths when in Program mode. Minimum aperture on the ADR is now colored orange. Most AI-s lenses had shorter focus throws than their AI predecessors and utilized simplified internal construction. Some late-AI-s lenses were given Nikon's new Super Integrated Coating from about 2000 to 2005.\n\nMost of our recommendations will start with C lenses as most people prefer the advantages of multi coating. However, if you prefer the rendering of the single coated lenses, more power to you and more money in your pocket ;-). They are definitely the best bargains in Nikkors. All of the lenses in this list take 52mm filters.\n\nWide Angles\n\n24mm f/2.8 N-C/K/AI/AI-s Nikkor (1972-2006)\n\nThis was the first lens to feature Nikon's Close Range Correction (CRC) technology, which permitted improved performance at close focusing distances, which was generally a weakness of wide angle's. Up to this point, such lenses had to be optimized for either close focus or infinity (far) focus, at the expense of the other. CRC now allowed for excellent performance at both ends of the focus range. The 24/2.8 is the best bargain among CRC lenses. All variants have 9 elements, but the pre-AIs have these in 7 groups rather than the 9 groups of the redesigned AI & AI-s. Performance is reputed by many to be a bit better in the last two versions, which also focus a tiny bit closer, but there is nothing wrong with the earlier versions, which can be had for lower cost because of their pre-AI construction. If you are seeking the absolute best (SIC) coatings on a 24/2.8, look for an AI-s with a serial # of 84xxxx and up. But be prepared to pay more for an AI-s, generally around $200 USD, which, frankly, is still pretty decent. On the other hand, the pre-AI lenses, particularly the K with its NICs, can often be had for $120 USD and the AI version for $150 USD and sometimes less, with a bit of patience :-). All have 7-blade apertures, except the N-C version with 6, if that is important to you (7 blades will give 14-point versus 6-point sunstars). One other thing to be aware of is the shorter focus throw of the AI-s, less than a quarter turn compared to just under a half a turn for its predecessors. This can be an important difference if you plan to use the lens for video, with the longer throw making pulling focus much easier. Weights dropped from 290 grams (10.2 oz) for the N-C to 250 grams (8.8 oz) for the AI-s.\n\n28mm f/3.5 K Nikkor (1975-77); AI (1977-81); AI-s (1981-83)\n\nThe ultimate bargain in wide angle Nikkors. Copies of the K can be found in excellent condition and factory AI converted for $70 - 80 USD. This version is special because it offers an interesting combination of optics, coatings, and aperture blades unique from all other iterations of the 28/3.5 Nikkor. All versions have a 6 element design, but the formula was changed with the AI version. The older design has a larger front element and a smaller rear element that produces a trade-off: more light falloff at the edges (vignetting) and slightly softer corners, but excellent performance shooting into the sun and for infrared (IR) photography. The AI & AI-s versions have a smaller front element and larger rear to combat the light falloff but do not work as well for IR. Check out Bjorn Rorslett's review of the 28/3.5 for more details (scroll down his page). The K version has the advantages over its predecessors of: 1) NIC (which further suppress flare and ghosting), 2) a 7-blade aperture instead of 5 blades (giving 14-point sunstars as opposed to 10-point if that floats your boat :-)), and 3) focusing down to 0.3m (12\"), half of the 0.6m (24\") of previous versions. There are other Nikkors that do as well at such contre-jour (into-the-light) shooting, but none at even close to this price point. Focus throw for the K is 190 degrees. Weight is 230 grams (8 oz). The AI version has a 200-degree throw and the AI-s a very quick 90-degree throw and they weigh 235 and 220 grams, respectively. If you are shooting landscapes or at medium to far distances, the 28/3.5s are the ticket. If you are looking for a 28 Nikkor that is better at close distances, the next lens is more likely for you.\n\n28mm f/2.8 AI-s Nikkor (1981-2006)\n\n​ While not in the same bargain category as the 28/3.5, the AI-s f/2.8 is a good bargain for its performance level. As the only 28/2.8 Nikkor with the CRC floating elements feature, it focuses down to just 0.2m (8\") and is wicked sharp in the center. Some performance has been sacrificed at farther focusing distances, but that's not what you buy this lens for. Produced for 25 years, the AI-s was upgraded to SIC from serial # 825xxx on. Focus throw is just under 180 degrees and weight is 250 grams (8.8 oz). Prices run from $200 - 250 USD.\n\n35mm f/2.8 K/Early AI Nikkor (1974-79); AI New (1979-81); AI-s (1981-89)\n\nNikon's 35/2.8 has a long history, first being produced in 1959. The design went though several changes over the decades. For our purposes of maximum performance for the dollar, we recommend the third optical formula (6 elements in 6 groups) found in K & early-AI form, which gives the best performance and costs no more than the late-AI/AI-s version (5 elements in 5 groups). This article from the Nikkor website gives an interesting glimpse into the evolution of the 35/2.8 and shows the superiority of the K/AI iteration over its predecessors. There is basically no distortion and reduced coma from the earlier versions. As with the 24/2.8 the K & early-AI have a longer focus throw than their successors (195 degrees vs. 100 - 120 degrees). Weight is 240 grams (8.5 oz). Roland Vink's invaluable website gives all the necessary details to determine the serial numbers and other data that differentiate all Nikkor lens versions (including the 35/2.8s). Prices run between $70 - 150 USD depending on condition.\n\n​ Normal Lenses\n\n50mm f/2 H/H-C/K/AI Nikkor (1964-79)\n\nThe classic budget normal lens, even the single-coated H version gives great performance (using a lens hood is always a good idea). About all it gives up to its f/1.8 successor is slight barrel distortion and field curvature, and a 6-blade aperture vs. the 7 blades of the 1.8. The K & AI variants have a long 230-degree focus throw for any videographers out there. A typical Planar design (6 elements in 4 groups), the K & AI versions also focus closer than the H & H-C (0.45m (18\") vs. 0.6m (24\")). Performance is equal from f/2.8 onward to concurrent 50/1.4 lenses. Prices are variable, $50 - 80 USD depending on variant and condition. Weight increased from 200 - 220 grams (7 - 7.8 oz) over time.\n\n50mm f/1.8 AI/AI-s Nikkor (1980-2005)\n\nProbably the best all-around manual focus 50mm Nikkor, ever. As mentioned above it offers superior distortion correction and a flat field of view. The AI and first-edition AI-s (commonly called long-grips) are seeing a rise in price to over $100 USD, but with a bit of patience you can still score one for $80 USD or so. The plethora of later AI-s versions are very plentiful at that $60 USD mark. They give up some build quality and close-focus distance to the two earliest variants, but optical quality remains excellent. The AI has a 210-degree focus throw as opposed to the 130 - 140 degree throws of the AI-s models. Weight was reduced over time from 220 to 145 grams (7.8 to 5 oz). The Series E 50/1.8 shares the optical formula of the Nikkors and it performs just as well, apart from a longer close-focus distance of 0.6m versus 0.45 and a bit less flare resistance with its single-coated optics. The final AI-s version (1985-2005) of the 50/1.8 was simply the Series E upgraded with NIC multicoating.\n\n50mm f/1.4 K/KII/AI/AI-s Nikkor (1974-2020)\n\nSo you just have to have f/1.4 ;-). Although Nikon debuted its 50/1.4 in 1962, we will confine our recommendation from the first-generation K-version to the AI-s. Why? Well, because more improvements in performance were made in that period. Now, some people swear by the performance of their S Nikkors, and we are not here to argue about it. If it gives you the look you want, go for it :-). But we feel that the newer versions offer more bang for your buck. Like closer focusing (0.45m vs. 0.6m), better coatings (NIC), and better performance at wider apertures. If you are a video junkie (or like ultra-precise focusing), the first-gen K also offers a nice long 225-degree focus throw instead of the 160 degrees of its predecessors. Nikon changed the optical design during the K-era from 7 elements in 5 groups to 7e/6g. That is why we show a KII in the subheading. The easiest way to tell the two K-versions apart is by the front name plate: the early-K ring slopes in toward the front element, and the gen-two K is flat (as is the AI/AI-s). The focusing ring also has a larger diameter swept-back front surface on the early K. That also means that the first K is the heaviest of the bunch: 310 grams (11 oz), which then dropped by 50 grams (2 oz) in the later iterations. The second-gen K and AI went with a 210-degree focus throw which was reduced to 140 degrees in the AI-s version. Prices range from $100 USD for an early pre-AI K to $200 USD for a mint AI-s.\n\nTelephotos\n\n85mm f/2 AI/AI-s Nikkor (1977-81/1981-95)\n\nThe 85/2 Nikkor is the Rodney Dangerfield of 85mm Nikkors. It gets no respect ;-). Held up against the legendary 85/1.8 pre-AI Nikkor, which it trails slightly in central sharpness and bokeh performance in the eyes, or maybe more correctly...ears of many Nikonistas, the 85/2 is often overlooked and thus makes our bargain list. Overall performance (corners included) is just fine and it packs plenty of contrast into a much more compact (think of a slightly-pudgy 50/1.4) and over 25%-lighter package than the vaunted 85/1.8. The focus throw is plenty long (255 degrees for the AI and 170 degrees for the AI-s) for precise focusing and weight is 310 grams (just under 11 oz). $200 USD will get an excellent copy.\n\n100mm f/2.8 Series E (1979-85)\n\nPerformance is very good for this simple, single-coated (4e/4g) lens. The only reason, though, we would recommend selecting it over the classic 105/2.5 Nikkor, though, is for its compact, lightweight (it's hardly bigger than a 50/1.4) construction. Coming in at around half the weight (225 grams for the early black-ringed version, and 215 grams for the later chrome-ringed type) of the 105/2.5, the Series E is the ultimate travel or backpacking low-powered telephoto in Nikonland. You can snag one in excellent condition for under $100 USD. The early 100/2.8 is easily distinguished by its square focusing ring nubs and black body ring. The later version adopted the AI-style rubber focusing ring and the chrome body ring, but kept the same aperture ring style as the first version. Focus rotation is 140-degrees.\n\n105mm f/2.5 P/PII/P-C/K/AI/AI-s Nikkor (1959-2005)\n\nIf we could only have one Nikkor telephoto, this is our pick, hands down. Legendary performance for portraiture or general use. The 105/2.5 came in two optical configurations: the first P-design was a Sonnar-type (5e/3g) and the second was a Xenotar-type (5e/4g) that was carried through for 34 years (1971 - 2005). Some prefer the rendering of the Sonnar version to the Xenotar and you can save a few dollars in doing so. The P-Sonnar is easily differentiated from the P-Xenotar by its silver nose and lens barrel and shorter focusing grip. The Xenotar variant is a little sharper and offers the advantage of selecting from multicoated versions with 7 curved aperture blades for smoother bokeh (out-of-focus areas). It also focuses 0.2m (8\") closer than the Sonnar version. Focus throws ranged from 180 degrees on P-Sonnars to 170 degrees on all Xenotar types except the AI-s with 140 degrees. All pre-AI version Xenotar-types have an f/32 minimum aperture which dropped to f/22 with the AI & AI-s lenses. The AI-s version went to straight aperture blades instead of curved and SIC was integrated from serial # 1043xxx onward. P-Sonnar weight is 375 grams (13 oz) and all Xenotar versions are 435 grams (15.2 oz). Prices range from $115 USD for excellent P-Sonnars to $250 USD for near-mint AI-s and everywhere in between and often with a hood included (which it is good to use on any variant, but especially a single-coated lens).\n\n135mm f/3.5 Q-C/K/AI/AI-s Nikkor (1973-83)\n\nStarting at $60 USD for an excellent condition Q-C or K (4e/3g), the 135/3.5 is one of the most cost-effective Nikkors in the line-up. If you want to lose a little weight & bulk, improve performance, and focus 0.2m (8\") closer, the redesigned AI and AI-s (4e/4g) versions can be had for $80 - 150 USD. And that is a considerable savings of $50 - 100 USD over a comparable 135/2.8. Focus throws went from 190 degrees on the Q-C & K to 220 degrees on the AI and back down to 180 degrees on the AI-s.\n\n135 f/2.8 Series E (1981-85)\n\nComing in at the same price point as the 135/3.5 Nikkor, the Series E f/2.8 snags 2/3s of a stop more light in a touch smaller package with no weight penalty. Focus is much faster, with a 130-degree throw and close focus comes in at 1.5m (just under 5'). NIC ensures plenty of contrast with the 4e/4g optical construction. Just over 77,000 produced.\n\n200mm f/4 K/AI/AI-s Nikkor (1975-86)\n\n​ If you are looking for a light telephoto with excellent image quality that will not break the bank (or your back carrying it), the 200/4 is a great choice for Nikon film SLRs or AI-compatible DSLRs. The AI-s has a slightly different aperture blade design, that produces smoother bokeh (out of focus areas) under some conditions than the K & AI versions (which have a pronounced saw-tooth/ninja-star shape to the iris at wider apertures). Weight ranges from 540 - 510 grams (19 - 18 oz). Focus throw is 205 degrees on all variants, with the AI-s generally determined to have a lighter feel than the heavier-damped K and AI versions. Minimum focus distance is 2m (6.5'), which is very good for this class of lenses (the average is 2.5m or 8'). You can get excellent condition K & AI variants for $115 USD and an AI-s for $150 USD. Great for hikers or anyone looking to travel lighter, but still have a bit of reach.\n\nMacros...Ahem...Micros (This is Nikkorland after all ;-))\n\n55mm f/3.5 P (1969-73)/ P-C (1973-75)/ K (1975-77)/ AI (1977-79) Micro-Nikkor\n\nFor a lens that was priced the same as the 105/2.5 when new, the 55/3.5 Micro is a steal today in the $50 - $100 USD range, occasionally including its matching extension tube (M2, PK-3, or PK-13 depending on generation) for up to a 1:1 reproduction ratio. Without the extension tube the 55/3.5 tops out at 1:2 (0.241m close focus distance versus 0.45 for the standard 50mm Nikkors of its time) like all other contemporary 50mmish macros. Although originally developed for copying documents, it can serve as an excellent lens for more varied tasks (product photography, still life, etc.) and some photographers have utilized it as their standard lens, notwithstanding its slightly lesser performance at longer distances than the standard 50s. It can also do nicely as a portrait lens wide-open on an APS-C digital camera. While the 55/3.5 first appeared in 1961 and the optical formula (5 elements in 4 groups) remained virtually unchanged (according to Nikon, anyways), we have restricted our recommendation to the non-compensating versions offered first in P-form from 1969-on.\n\n\"Non-compensating\" you ask? As the 55/3.5 was originally developed before the rise of through-the-lens (TTL) metering in SLRs, Nikon cleverly designed a mechanism to automatically close or open the aperture to compensate for the changes in light transmission due to the extension of the lens as focus distance changed. Once TTL came on the scene, this system became more than redundant (on a TTL body, you have to make compensation for the compensating aperture mechanism...way too complicated :-)). Seeing as most users today will have TTL bodies, the non-compensating version is preferable. If you are using a non-TTL Nikon body (e.g. an eye-level F or F2, F Photomic, or a Nikkormat FS) then you may prefer the compensating version. The easiest way to distinguish a non-compensating 55/3.5 is the focusing grip: all non-compensating versions use rubber focus rings, while the compensating-types had knurled metal grips. Aside: the earliest 55/3.5 (1961-63) used a pre-set aperture (no AUTO engraved on the filter ring following NIKKOR) and was also non-compensating while having a knurled metal focus ring. It looks and operates much differently from the succeeding compensator-type (1963-69), is quite collectible nowadays and is priced accordingly ($400 - $700 USD on average).\n\nBack to our recommended versions: they all have a 300-degree focus throw and weigh between 235-245 grams (8.6 oz) without extension tube. Ps are single-coated with a diamond-pattern focus grip; P-Cs are multicoated and otherwise identical cosmetically to the Ps; Ks are multicoated with NIC and with the familiar ribbed focus grip, and the final AI version was basically identical to a K excepting the AI bits, coarser-ribbed grip, and a drop to a 3-screw rear flange on the late-AI versions (last 20,000 approx.) versus the 5-screw flange on the Ks and earlier-AI lenses. There was no AI-s version of the 55/3.5 as it was replaced with the 55/2.8 AI-s, a totally new design (and which costs about double, nowadays).\n\nA future post will look at bargains among Zoom Nikkors. To finish off, here is a great video on building an MF Nikkor set, with many of our bargains included. Notice the photographer's applications he uses them for, which informed his decisions:"
