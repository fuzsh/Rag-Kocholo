        "text": "The best binoculars are the perfect companion for anyone who wants to get a closer look at wildlife, sporting events, or concerts, and they can even be used for a spot of stargazing. They tend to be cheaper and more portable than telescopes, providing you with a convenient way of observing the sky during your nighttime wanders.\n\nIdeally, binoculars should be comfortable to hold, easy to carry around with you, and weatherproof for when you unexpectedly get caught outside in the elements. If you're hoping to use them for stargazing, you'll also want to look for a pair with large objective lenses to soak in as much light as possible from distant stars. Our reviewers have scoured the market to bring you a list of the very best binoculars for different purposes and budgets, so check out our top picks below.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a highly portable pair, take a look at our guide to the best compact binoculars for small and lightweight models, and if your little ones want to get involved, we also have a guide to the best binoculars for kids. Those looking to take their stargazing to the next level may also want to check out our guides to the best telescopes and best beginner telescopes.\n\nThe quick list\n\nBest binoculars we recommend in 2024\n\nBest overall\n\nFor hand-held astronomy, the Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars are among the best you can get. Their standout feature is Canon's Optical Image Stabilization (IS). This clever technology uses gyroscope motion sensors to detect arm movements and a vari-angle prism to correct them by up to 0.8 degrees. With the push of a button, you can eliminate the movements caused by your hands shaking and get a steady image. This comes in particularly handy during long viewing sessions when your arms might get tired.\n\nThe Canon 10x42L IS WP use premium L-series glass with Canon's multi-layered anti-reflective lens coating (known as 'Super Spectra') to increase light transmission and reduce lens flare. This ensures a bright and clear view with accurate color reproduction. During our Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars review, we were really impressed with the incredibly sharp image which featured no chromatic aberration, which is just what you need for observing stars.\n\nThe downside of these high-tech binoculars is that the IS system is quite power-hungry. It will go through a few AAA batteries during a long sky-watching session, so it's worth making sure you take some spare ones with you. Though not exactly exclusive to Canon, the IS system used here is not widely used. That’s partly because it’s so expensive, though few who have had the good fortune to try this electronic system consisting of motion sensors and a ‘vari-angle prism’ will say it’s not worth the outlay.\n\nWe also weren't wholly satisfied with the accessories provided with these binoculars, especially considering the price point. We struggled to get the one-piece lens caps to stay in place, and the carry case was a bit basic and flimsy, so you might want to upgrade it. But overall, these are still the best stargazing binoculars on our list thanks to the astronomy-centric glass and clever image stabilization feature.\n\nRead our Canon 10x42L IS WP binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest optical performance\n\nIf your primary concern is optical quality, then the Nikon Monarch HG 10x42 binoculars may be the pair for you. The optics on these binoculars are absolutely stunning thanks to their specialist Field Flattener Lens System, which ensures sharpness across the whole field of view, and their Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass, which all but eliminates chromatic aberration. During our Nikon Monarch HG 10x42 review we tested these binoculars in a range of challenging conditions and were pleased with the results every single time.\n\nLight transmission is good because the 42mm objective lenses are large enough to allow light to pass through even in twilight hours. Every single glass element also contains multilayer coatings to help improve the transmission of light, which Nikon reported as being 92% or higher.\n\nWhilst they're undeniably pricey binoculars, we feel you're getting real quality for your money with this pair. Everything about them feels premium. The magnesium alloy body is slim and lightweight enough to slip into a coat pocket, but they feel balanced in the hand and come coated in a grippy rubberized armor. They're also entirely waterproof, so you don't need to worry about getting caught out in bad weather, and they're nitrogen-filled to prevent fogging as well.\n\nEven the accessories feel high-quality. These binoculars come with a cushioned neck strap, objective lens caps and a premium carry case that has a secure safety catch to prevent them from falling out during transit (no relying on velcro here). We also enjoyed other unexpected details like the locking mechanism on the diopter adjustment ring which means it can't get accidentally knocked out of place. The only thing they lack is image stabilization technology.\n\nRead our Nikon Monarch HG 10x42 binocular review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for affordable stargazing\n\nThe Celestron Nature DX 12x56 binoculars are a great deal for under $250, perfect for casual wildlife spotting, bird watching or stargazing. The build quality is fantastic: They have a full rubber housing and they're completely waterproof, fogproof and nitrogen-purged. The Nature DX 12x56 binoculars include a tripod mount that could be useful for longer viewing sessions and a rain guard that protects the lenses from getting watermarked.\n\nThe focus knobs turn smoothly and easily. During our Celestron Nature DX 12x56 review, we appreciated that the binoculars can focus on objects less than 10 feet away, making them great for spotting wildlife in your backyard. If you wear glasses, you'll appreciate the 16mm eye relief provided by the twist-up eyecups.\n\nThe optics on these binoculars are comparable to some more expensive models as they feature phase-coated BaK-4 prisms with multi-coated optics. They may not have the sharpness to satisfy professionals, but for casual users looking for an affordable pair to invest in, the Celestron Nature DX 12x56 are some of the best you can buy.\n\nIf you want a high-quality pair of binoculars for bird watching or wildlife watching and can forgo some level of sharpness that more expensive models can provide, these are attractive. They are also suitable for sky watching and, thanks to the rubber armoring, are hardy enough to be taken anywhere without worrying about the elements.\n\nRead our Celestron Nature DX 12x56 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest binoculars under $300\n\nWe think the Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars make a great pair for amateur astronomy, whilst also having the flexibility to be used for a range of other pursuits. Their price point sits just above the more affordable mass-market binoculars, and this means that you get high-quality BaK-4 glass and multi-coated optics, as well as waterproofing and nitrogen purging to make these binoculars safe to use in any weather conditions.\n\nIn our Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars review we were very pleased with the build quality on these binoculars. They're constructed from a lightweight magnesium frame with rubber coating for grip and protection. They also come with a useful range of accessories, including a thick and comfortable neck strap, a padded carry case and an innovative harness strap that spreads the weight of the binoculars over your shoulders for longer viewing sessions.\n\nThe 8x magnification and 42mm lens diameter means that they're at the lowest useful end for stargazing purposes, but the wide viewing angle they offer is ideal for spotting star clusters and scanning the Milky Way. Unlike more expensive pairs, they don't have Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass, so we did notice a little bit of color fringing when viewing bright objects like the moon. Celestron do offer a model with ED glass, but they're substantially more expensive.\n\nTheir specifications make them an entry-level choice in some ways; you wouldn’t want to go any lower than their 8x magnification and 42mm objective lens size. Although the TrailSeeker 8x42 are good all-rounders, 10x50 binoculars remain the sweet spot for stargazing.\n\nGlasses-wearers will also find this pair easy to use thanks to their generous 17mm eye relief, which can be set in three different positions depending on your preference.\n\nRead our Celestron TrailSeeker 8x42 binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest budget binoculars\n\nThese are affordable skywatching binoculars that would be ideal for anyone just starting out who wants to get the most for their money.\n\nIn our Celestron UpClose G2 10x50 binocular review, we found the moon looks amazing through these binoculars, easily fitting into the view with just a hint of false color. In July 2020, the UpClose G2 10x50 binoculars were very effective in spotting the naked-eye comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE). We managed to spot three stars within the Trapezium Cluster near the center of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), but you'd need a pair with higher magnification if you want to see the fourth bright star in this star-forming area.\n\nWe think these binoculars are a great choice for beginners on a budget who are just starting on their stargazing journey. They're lightweight and perfect for trekking, but we did find them a bit cheap in some ways we discuss in our review. For a start, you need to adjust the alignment of the lenses (collimation).\n\nAlthough the rubber-armored aluminum housing is water-resistant, the Celestron UpClose G2 10x50 aren’t waterproof and haven’t been nitrogen-purged. As a consequence, they could fog up slightly in the cold, though they were fine during a two-hour session in near-freezing conditions.\n\nRead our Celestron UpClose G2 10x50 binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for moon views\n\nCelestron is a well-respected brand with a strong reputation and the SkyMaster binoculars, including the 15x70 'giant' model, deliver excellent views at an affordable price. Despite being a bit on the heavy side, these binoculars are durable and we think they offer impressive quality for their cost.\n\nThe SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars have a big advantage: They gather more light and provide stronger magnification, making objects clearer than less powerful binoculars. Although there's some blurring at the edges, which is typical for budget models, they offer 0.7 inches (18 mm) of eye relief, making them comfortable for people who wear glasses.\n\nOptically the star images were excellent at the center of the field of view, but the distortion was evident towards the edges, with the stars appearing as streaks. This is not very disturbing, as one’s vision is only sharp at the center anyway, but it means that you would have to move the binoculars to explore a large starfield. To get edge-to-edge sharpness in binoculars of this size you will have to pay a great deal more.\n\nAt 11 inches (280mm) in length and weighing 3 lbs (1.36kg), we found in our Celestron SkyMaster Pro 15x70 binocular review that they certainly have a lot of heft. Using them handheld isn't impossible, but for maximum comfort, it's best to use a tripod with these binoculars. Their powerful magnification makes views of the moon truly stunning, and we were especially impressed by how the lunar surface looked three-dimensional.\n\nDespite the larger 70mm objective aperture, the higher magnification of 15x reduces the apparent field of view to 4.4 degrees, compared to typical 10x50s or 12x50s that provide a degree more.\n\nRead our Celestron SkyMaster Pro 15x70 binocular review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest mid range model\n\nWith their wide field of view, the reliable and sturdy Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD binoculars are great for wildlife watching and occasional stargazing. They stand out thanks to their excellent design, featuring a strong and easily adjustable focusing knob that comes in very handy when you're wearing thick gloves in cold weather.\n\nThe eyecups are comfortable and twistable, allowing you to customize the eye relief to 17mm for a personalized viewing experience. We love how lightweight these binoculars are, weighing only 1.89 lbs (0.86kg), so they're great if you want to travel and take them on the go.\n\nThe Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD are roof prism binoculars, which means a relatively compact and space-saving design of two tubes joined by a small hinge in the center that houses the optics and the focusing knob. The lens caps on the 50mm objective lenses are tethered to the hinge.\n\nThe Vortex Crossfire HD 10x50 binoculars provide a sharp and clear view, particularly if you're into astronomy; they make stars look like perfect pinpoints of light. You might notice some color distortion when looking at brighter objects, but this is common for binoculars in this price range. However, they offer a great balance of brightness and sharpness across the entire field of view. During our Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD review, we only observed a tiny drop-off towards the very edges of the field of view.\n\nThere are a few downsides to them, of course. Although these binoculars come with a harness, we realized during our testing that the padded case forms part of the harness so you can't use one without the other, which is a little frustrating.\n\nRead our Vortex 10x50 Crossfire HD binocular review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest family binoculars\n\nIt is a known fact that children have better night vision than adults, meaning they do not require high-end binoculars to see the same amount of light that an adult would with a more powerful pair. As such, the 7x magnification and 50mm objective lenses make the Celestron Cometron 7x50 a great choice for kids (they're featured in our best binoculars for kids guide).\n\nHaving reviewed the specs on paper, we weren't too excited about reviewing this pair of binoculars, but to our pleasant surprise, we ended up loving them in our Celestron Cometron 7x50 review. We think they offer a budget-friendly entry into the realm of sky-watching, and if they don't suit you, the gamble will only set you back $40.\n\nThey're lightweight and easy to carry, perfect to accommodate small hands and arms, but they're sturdy enough to withstand inevitable knocks. It's worth noting that the Cometron 7x50 aren't waterproof, but that's typical for binoculars in this price range.\n\nKeep in mind that kids might find it more challenging to keep binoculars steady for a long time, so it's a good idea to pick a pair that are lightweight and comfortable for them. This makes it easier for kids to use them and helps prevent them from getting tired quickly. Alternatively, consider mounting them on a tripod.\n\nRead our Celestron Cometron 7x50 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for magnification\n\nThe Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 are our top pick for large astronomy binoculars. They act like two 100mm (4-inch) refractor telescopes set up side-by-side, with built-in image-erecting prisms and eyepieces that rotate independently through 450 degrees rather than the combined central focus knob that you get on traditional binoculars. They also have a 15mm eye relief, which is just enough to comfortably use them with glasses.\n\nDuring our Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 review, we were impressed with the breathtaking images of the night sky they provided. We were able to pick out clusters of galaxies like the Leo Triplets, Jupiter's atmospheric belts and the Sagittarius star cloud (also known as Messier 24). The multi-coated optics produce bright, clear views through the unusually large objective lens diameters.\n\nKeep in mind that these binos are quite heavy, weighing in at 8.75 lbs (3.97 kg). You won't be able to use them handheld; instead, you'll need to mount them using the built-in tripod adapter, possibly with a counter-weighted arm for balance. The design is well-thought-out, with a sturdy reinforced metal bar supporting the weight of the glass which also serves as a convenient handle for carrying and storing the binoculars. While the lens covers and thinly padded carry case are somewhat disappointing, these binoculars are still among the best for astronomy.\n\nRead our full Celestron SkyMaster 25x100 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for entry level astronomy\n\nThe Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 are our top pick for entry-level astronomy. Their 10x magnification and 50mm objective lenses are ideal for stargazing, though they could also be used for observing birds or other wildlife when you're out and about.\n\nFor the price, we think the optics on these are fantastic. They utilize a porro prism design, which makes them a bit bulkier than some other options, but really maximizes the brightness of the image for stargazing. They also incorporate high-density BaK-4 glass, which is much better than the BK-7 glass that you'll more commonly find at this price point. This makes them a great-value choice for those looking to get started with astronomy.\n\nWe really enjoyed scanning the skies with these during our Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 binoculars review. Stars appeared extremely sharp in the center of the field of view, with just some blurring towards the outer edges and a little chromatic aberration when viewing the moon. This is to be expected at this price point, but we don't think it would hinder the enjoyment of first-time stargazers.\n\nThere are a couple of things to bear in mind if you're looking at buying these binoculars. Firstly, their close focus is limited to a minimum of 23 feet (7 meters), so they wouldn't work well for observing wildlife in your own backyard. Secondly, the eye relief is only 11.8mm, which makes them unsuitable for glasses-wearers, although anyone else should find the eyecups smooth and easy to use.\n\nRead our full Nikon 10x50 Aculon A211 binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for beginners\n\nThe Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 are fantastic entry-level binoculars that punch well above their modest price tag. They are new to the market and hold their own against more expensive binos because their optics are fantastic for the price. The eye relief is very long at 20.2mm and the eyecups are adjustable — excellent news for anyone who wears glasses.\n\nThese binoculars are designed to be lightweight and durable. Made from strong fiberglass-reinforced polycarbonate resin, they have a non-slip rubber coating for a comfortable grip during long use. The shockproof design makes them resistant to damage from any accidental drops or bumps, and they are also waterproof and fog-proof, which is impressive for their affordable price.\n\nDuring our Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 binocular review, we found adjusting the focus on very easy, and we love that they offer just the right amount of resistance, even when you're wearing thick gloves. Although they don't include a tripod adaptor, their 8x magnification and lightweight design (only 572g) make them manageable without one.\n\nThe Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 are great for casual nature watching or travel, without stressing about exceeding your luggage weight limit. However, if you plan on long nights of extended stargazing, they might not be the most suitable choice.\n\nRead our Nikon Prostaff P3 8x42 binocular review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for reliability\n\nThe Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars are a fantastic option compared to more mainstream 10x50 binoculars as they provide a higher 12x magnification while maintaining the same 50mm aperture. The build is excellent, featuring comfortable rubber grips and a large focus knob, although the 13mm eye relief will be a little short for anyone who wears glasses.\n\nWhen using higher magnification binoculars such as 12x50s, you usually get less bright images because you're magnifying the same amount of collected light. However, the Action EX 12x50 tackles this problem with multi-coated lenses and high-refractive-index prisms, ensuring that the brightness decrease is hardly noticeable.\n\nThe Nikon Action EX 12x50, weighing in at 2.3 lbs (1.04kg), is too heavy for long bouts of stargazing, and the higher magnification will enhance any image wobble, so we advise using a tripod.\n\nIn our Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars review, we found that these binoculars give clear and sharp images in the center, especially when looking at stars. However, you might see some distortion near the edges of the 5.5-degree field of view. Seeing Saturn's rings individually wasn't possible with this pair of binoculars, but observers can still notice clear ansae – the extensions of the rings on either side of the planet, creating an oblate shape. Overall, they offer a great viewing experience.\n\nRead our Nikon Action EX 12x50 binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for daytime use\n\nThese are some of the finest handheld binoculars for stargazing and wildlife observation. The Extra-low Dispersion (ED) objective lenses produce aberration-free sharp images.\n\nDuring our Celestron Nature DX ED 12x50 review, we took them to several events, which made us appreciate how lightweight and compact they are to carry in their padded case. We tested them at a motor race and were delighted with the bright and sharp views, even at dusk.\n\nWe were equally happy with how well these binoculars worked at night. The Pleiades star cluster looked sharp and clear across the entire view, with only a slight decrease in quality towards the edges, and we didn't see any noticeable color distortion either.\n\nThe only thing that didn't really impress us was the quality of the eyecups. They're just okay and don't provide much comfort, especially for people who wear glasses. But aside from that, the Nature DX ED 12x50 binoculars are made with great quality and have tough rubber armor that protects them from water and impacts. They sit just below the $250 mark, which is on the more expensive side, but will keep stargazers and nature spotters entertained for years to come.\n\nRead our Celestron Nature DX ED 12x50 binoculars review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest binoculars FAQ\n\nWhich binoculars are best?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on your needs, abilities and budget. Binoculars come in two kinds: Porro-prism and Roof-prism. The Porro-prism kind have the most common look of any binocular. They feature a gradual and stepped-up appearance, forming part of the housing which includes two exit pupils, eyecups, central focuser, objective lenses and optical system. You’ll find them best for observing due to their affordability.\n\nMeanwhile, the Roof-prism binocular boasts a “H”-shaped appearance that lends well to a smaller, and lighter-weight design. These instruments have complicated optical designs, which means that observers need to spend a substantial amount of money to own a reliable binocular of this type. As such, a good Roof-prism binocular isn’t ideal for those on a budget, or casual observers.\n\nWhat do binocular numbers mean?\n\nExamine any binoculars and you’ll discover that one of several combinations of numbers separated by a 'x' will be visible — for example, 7x40, 10x50, 8x40 and so on. These numbers, which are often located close to the eyepieces, tell you the magnification and aperture of the optical system. For example a 10x50 binocular has a magnification, or 'power' of 10x and front lenses with a diameter of 50mm. These numbers determine which objects you can observe by telling you how much you can magnify them by and how much light your binoculars can collect.\n\nThe larger the aperture, the easier it will be to see fainter night sky targets such as galaxies and nebulae. As a rule of thumb, and under decent observing conditions, 7x35 binoculars will reveal a hundred thousand stars while 10x50s will show the finer details of the Moon, planets, the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) and the Orion Nebula. Larger, heavier binoculars such as 20x80s and 20x100s open up a wealth of objects such as the fainter spiral galaxies Messier 65 and NGC 3628 and a selection of globular clusters and star-forming regions.\n\nSome models of binocular have their field of view printed on the barrels or somewhere close to the magnification and aperture. Given in degrees, this number tells you how wide you can see when peering through the eyepieces. The larger the number, the wider the scene. Ten degrees will allow the Big Dipper’s bowl to comfortably fit within your field of view.\n\nWhich is best BaK-4, BK-7 or K9 binoculars?\n\nAs you shop around for your next piece of observing kit, you’ll come across the terms BaK-4, BK-7 and K9. These refer to the formulations of glass found in the prisms of spotting scopes, binoculars and monoculars.\n\nBK-7 and K9 glass refer to borosilicate formulations and can be found in cheaper products. While they're used across a wide range of brands, this glass is said to lead to problematic exit pupils; the field of view in particular isn’t perfectly round, which can leave the observer with poor clarity around the edges of their chosen target. We must stress that this isn’t true of all pieces of kit, so we advise giving your chosen binoculars a test before committing to them.\n\nWhile it's a touch more expensive than BK-7 and K9, the BaK-4 — or barium crown glass — is preferable for binoculars. With this type of prism you’ll achieve a higher quality of image, particularly when combined with a well-made optical system.\n\nMulti-coated vs fully-coated binoculars\n\nWithout coatings on the optics of binoculars, images would be blurry and lack contrast since light transmission would be poor, glare would become prevalent and light would be lost through internal reflections. The observer would be left with a disappointing view.\n\nIt’s easy to find out if your binocular lenses feature a coating: you’ll see a darker appearance when you peer through the barrels, while the glass will feature a bluish or greenish tint thanks to a layer of magnesium fluoride. If you see a brownish tint, then your optics are coated with calcium fluoride. Both offer the same outcome — they halt the reflection of some wavelengths, allowing more light to enter your eyes through the exit pupils.\n\nBinoculars largely come in two varieties when it comes to coatings: they’re either fully coated or multi-coated. In both versions, all lenses, glass surfaces and prisms feature at least one layer of magnesium fluoride or calcium fluoride. Binoculars with multi-coated optics are the most superior kind you’ll be able to find on the market, with at least one of the surfaces featuring several layers of anti-reflective compounds.\n\nWhich binoculars are best for astronomy?\n\nFor a decent observing experience in the dark, the best binoculars for stargazing must have an optical system that is able to collect as much light as possible to pick out those faint targets. In other words, the larger the aperture, the better. This does mean that they tend to be bulkier and more expensive than models used for other disciplines, though.\n\nWe advise purchasing at least 10x50 binoculars for comfortable views of a selection of targets; they’re light enough to hold for long periods of time, while offering good views of a selection of night-sky targets. The larger the binocular, the more you’ll be able to see, but be warned: They’ll also be heavier and will require a tripod for steady sights of the heavens.\n\nIt isn’t just the aperture that you need to be mindful of. The quality of the optical system is an essential feature to consider for high-definition, excellent contrast and crystal-clear views. You’ll discover two major kinds of binoculars at reputable stockists: the porro-prism and roof-prism. Choose the Porro-prism design for a reliable and affordable piece of kit, making sure that the lenses feature a coating and the glass is of decent quality (we can vouch for multi-coated optics and BaK-4 prisms). If you wear spectacles, we advise choosing binoculars that offer eye relief of at least 14 to 15mm.\n\nWhichever model you decide to go for, there are plenty on the market to suit a variety of budgets, observing interests and abilities.\n\nHow we test the best binoculars\n\nTo guarantee you're getting honest, up-to-date recommendations on the best binoculars to buy here at Space.com we make sure to put every binocular through a rigorous review to fully test each instrument. Each binocular is reviewed based on many aspects, from its construction and design, to how well it functions as an optical instrument and its performance in the field.\n\nEither our expert staff or knowledgeable freelance contributors test each pair of binoculars carefully, to ensure a personal, fair and hands-on review of each model and judge it based on price, destined use and class.\n\nFor example, comparing a pair of 25x100 mammoth binoculars to a compact pair of 8x25s wouldn’t be appropriate though each binocular might be the best pick in their own class.\n\nWe look at how easy they are to operate, whether eye relief can be adjusted for spectacles wearers, if a binocular comes with appropriate accessories or carry bags and suggest if a particular set of binos would benefit from any additional kit to give you the best viewing experience possible.\n\nWith complete editorial independence Space.com are here to ensure you get the best buying advice on binoculars, whether you should purchase an instrument or not, making our buying guides and reviews reliable and transparent."
