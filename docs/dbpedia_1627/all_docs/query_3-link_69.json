        "text": "Building a Nikon lens collection is a critical part of your photography journey. In some ways, adding the right lens to your kit is even more important than your choice of camera, especially if you concentrate on a particular genre of photography, such as portraits, wildlife, or street photography. The type of lens you select can make a significant difference between so-so photos and consistently excellent images. Whether youâre shooting with a full-frame DSLR, an APS-C DSLR, or a Nikon Z-series mirrorless camera, weâll help you sort through the best Nikon lenses available.\n\nBest Nikon mirrorless lenses\n\nBest overall: Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S\n\nBest wide-angle: Nikon NIKKOR Z 17-28mm f/2.8\n\nBest for portraits: Nikon NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.2 S\n\nBest telephoto: Nikon NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S\n\nBest budget: Nikon NIKKOR Z 50mm f/1.8 S Lens\n\nBest Nikon DSLR lenses\n\nBest F-mount lens overall: AF-S FX Nikon NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4\n\nBest F-mount telephoto zoom: AF-S FX NIKKOR 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens\n\nBest budget F-mount lens: Nikon FX NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D\n\nHow we chose the best Nikon lenses\n\nThe writers and editors at Pop Photo have decades of experience with just about every major camera and lens manufacturer, including Nikon. We have hands-on experience with most of the lenses on this list. We also factored in user and editorial reviews. Given the wide variety of Nikon lenses, we aimed to choose options for most situations and price points. Overall image quality, handling, autofocus, build quality, and lens features were all important factors when making our selections.\n\nThe best Nikon lenses: Reviews & recommendations\n\nNikon makes a wide array of lenses for its DSLR and mirrorless lineup. Lenses span the full spectrum of lens types and budgets, so youâre sure to find a quality Nikon lens that fits your needs.\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon Z, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/2.8 â f/22\n\nImage stabilization: No\n\nFilter size: 82mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 1.25 feet\n\nWeight: 1.77 pounds\n\nDimensions: 3.5 x 4.96 – 6.15 inches\n\nPros\n\nVersatile zoom range\n\nExcellent image quality\n\nLightweight and compact\n\nUseful OLED display\n\nCons\n\nFocus is a little slow compared to the competition\n\nA quality 24-70mm lens is something that most photographers should have in their kits. It offers an extremely versatile focal length range thatâs ideal for a vast range of situations, meaning you can switch lenses less often. And this Nikon lens is one of the best available across all brands. It offers exceptional sharpness across the zoom and aperture range, with minimal aberrations or fringing, resulting in superb image quality.\n\nThis standard zoom lens features a fast and constant f/2.8 aperture, making it ideal in low-light situations like wedding receptions or indoor family shoots. Its autofocus is slightly slower than other lenses in this class, partly because it uses two stepper motor AF actuators instead of linear focus motors. But it is accurate and quiet, and there is very limited focus breathing, making it a good option for videographers.\n\nThe lens isnât cheap, but it is roughly the same as the mirrorless f/2.8 options from Canon and Sony. And it offers a lot in terms of quality and features. For example, the OLED display on the top is handy for checking focal length, aperture, or focus distance. Nikon built it with robust weather sealing to protect it against the elements. And itâs also the lightest 24-70mm available at the moment. If you want to save some money, Nikon also makes an excellent 24-70mm f/4 that, at $1,000, is less than half the price, albeit with a slight drop in image quality and a slower maximum aperture.\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon Z, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/2.8 â f/22\n\nImage stabilization: No\n\nFilter size: 67mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 7.5 inches\n\nWeight: 15.9 ounces\n\nDimensions: 3 x 4 inches\n\nPros\n\nVery compact and lightweight for the class\n\nInternal focus and zoom\n\nCan focus very close\n\nGood balance of quality and price\n\nCons\n\nMinimal controls on the lens body\n\nControl ring is hypersensitive\n\nWhile this lens isnât at the top end of Nikonâs wide-angle lineup, it is very well-balanced in regard to price and quality, which is why it earned our top wide-angle spot. It is very reasonably priced but still has a lot to offer. Weighing just under a pound and measuring four inches long, itâs extremely compact and lightweight for the class. It is one of our favorite lenses to hike with, as a result.\n\nThis wide-angle zoom lens features fully internal zoom and focus, meaning the lens doesnât change length at all. That makes it ideal for video use, especially when using a gimbal, as you wonât need to rebalance when changing focal length. It can also focus as close as 7.5 inches, making it possible to get some unique wide-angle closeup shots.\n\nThough this lens wonât offer the same sharpness as Nikonâs higher-end S lineup, it is plenty sharp for most people and situations. The f/2.8 aperture and rounded nine-blade diaphragm results in pleasing bokeh, especially when you get close to your subjects. And despite the ultra-wide perspective, you can use a reasonable 67mm filter on it. For the price, this lens is quite impressive.\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon Z, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/1.2 â f/16\n\nImage stabilization:\n\nFilter size: 82mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 33.46 inches\n\nWeight: 2.6 pounds\n\nDimensions: 4 x 5.6 inches\n\nPros\n\nSuperb image quality\n\nFast f/1.2 aperture\n\nFast and accurate autofocus\n\nRugged build quality\n\nCons\n\nA bit pricey\n\nBulky and heavy\n\nAn 85mm prime is the quintessential portrait lens, and this Nikon version is a premier example of one. It offers truly excellent image quality, with excellent sharpness across the image and at all apertures. But its bokeh is where it really shines. Thanks in part to the rounded 11-blade diaphragm, the bokeh is wonderfully smooth, with beautiful transition from focused and defocused areas. It contrasts the sharpness of the lens perfectly.\n\nAs a member of Nikonâs S line of lenses, this 85mm features rugged build quality with weather sealing. It offers a programmable control ring and L-Fn function button, and there is an auto/manual focus switch as well. The autofocus is speedy and reliably accurate, so it can keep up with even rapidly moving subjects like little kids.\n\nOf course, the fast f/1.2 aperture results in a steep price tag and a lot of bulk. If you want to save $2,000 and a pound and a half of weight, the NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.8 S is your best alternative.\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon Z, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/2.8 â f/22\n\nImage stabilization: Yes\n\nFilter size: 77mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 1.64 feet\n\nWeight: 2.99 pounds\n\nDimensions: 3.5 x 8.66 inches\n\nPros\n\nStunningly good image quality\n\nExtremely fast, quiet, and accurate autofocus\n\nBuilt-in stabilization\n\nExcellent handling\n\nCons\n\nPro-level price tag\n\nBesides a 24-70mm, a 70-200mm is one of the most versatile zoom lenses you can buy. They can cover most situations at weddings, work extremely well for motorsports and other sporting events, and are great wildlife lenses. And Nikonâs mirrorless version of this popular lens is possibly the best to have ever existed.\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 70-200mm offers truly stunning image quality. Itâs extremely sharp across the zoom and aperture range. The colors and contrast are pleasing and true to life. And the bokeh is very attractive, resulting in beautiful portraits. The autofocus is very fast, accurate, and quiet, so youâll be able to trust it even if youâre shooting a wedding ceremony in a poorly lit church.\n\nAs we would hope for a 70-200mm, it provides image stabilization to improve low-light performance. Itâs built to Nikonâs S-line standards, meaning itâs dust and moisture-resistant and gets a fluorine coating on the front element. And the OLED lens information panel displays aperture setting, focus distance, and depth of field figures right on top of the lens for quick reference. Of course, it comes with a price tag to reflect all these pro features, but it is a spectacular lens for those who want the absolute best.\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon Z, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/1.8 â f/16\n\nImage stabilization: No\n\nFilter size: 62mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 1.31 feet\n\nWeight: 14.64 ounces\n\nDimensions: 2.99 x 3.41 inches\n\nPros\n\nExcellent overall image quality\n\nVery fast autofocus\n\nReasonably priced\n\nRelatively compact and lightweight\n\nCons\n\nNo fluorine coating on the front element\n\nIf you are just starting out in photography and looking for a single, relatively affordable but quality lens, youâd be hard-pressed to beat Nikonâs 50mm f/1.8 S. It isnât the cheapest Nikon lens you can buy, but the quality you get makes this one we would recommend over less expensive options. It offers a ton of value for the relatively low price, which you simply wonât find elsewhere.\n\nItâs as sharp as much more expensive lenses, even when shooting wide open. The bokeh is pleasing, and it results in minimal distortion, vignetting, and aberrations. The autofocus is also as fast as its more expensive peers, so you can trust itâll keep up with fast-moving subjects. The f/1.8 aperture is fast enough for most, though if you want extra low-light performance and razor-thin focus areas, Nikonâs 50mm f/1.2 S is another option, albeit for more than twice the price.\n\nIn terms of build quality, you also get a lot for your money here. Itâs weather sealed and offers a programmable control ring which you can use for a variety of camera and exposure settings. Nikon did leave out a fluorine coating on the front element, so you will want to take extra care in cleaning your lens before shoots. Finally, itâs relatively compact and lightweight, making it comfortable to keep on your camera even for long days of shooting.\n\nIf you don’t mind a slightly wider perspective and want to save $350, the NIKKOR Z 40mm f/2 is a fantastic choice.\n\nBest F-mount lens overall: AF-S FX Nikon NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon F, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/1.4 â f/16\n\nImage stabilization: No\n\nFilter size: 77 mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 2.79 feet\n\nWeight: 1.31 pounds\n\nDimensions: 3.39 x 3.31 inches\n\nPros\n\nVery sharp optics\n\nAttractive bokeh\n\nRelatively lightweight for the class\n\nHighly accurate autofocus\n\nCons\n\nStrong vignetting when wide open\n\nThe AF-S FX Nikon NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4 lens is one of the best Nikon DSLR lenses for portraits. It produces sharp-as-a-tack images. And thanks to its f/1.4 aperture, it creates beautiful bokeh that softens the background to emphasize your main subject.\n\nThe autofocus of this 85mm isnât as fast as other lenses, but for most portrait situations, itâll keep up just fine. And it makes up for the lack of speed in its accuracy. Plus, the lens is relatively compact and lightweight for an 85mm, so you wonât mind carrying it with you for a full day of shooting.\n\nFor budget-minded Nikon shooters, take a look at the AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.8G.\n\nBest F-mount telephoto zoom: AF-S FX NIKKOR 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon F, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/5.6 â f/32\n\nImage stabilization:\n\nFilter size: 95mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 7.22 feet\n\nWeight: 5.07 pounds\n\nDimensions: 4.25 x 10.53 – 13.5 inches\n\nPros\n\nVersatile range for sports and wildlife\n\nExcellent image quality across zoom range\n\nReasonably priced\n\nVibration reduction of up to 4.5 stops\n\nCons\n\nNot fully weather-sealed\n\nDistant subjects are no longer out of reach with the AF-S FX NIKKOR 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens. It provides an awesome zoom range, making it an ideal choice for sports and wildlife photographers. The image quality from this super-telephoto zoom lens is superb, resulting in highly detailed shots. It also offers 4.5 stops of vibration reduction to help obtain sharp images even when hand-holding the lens.\n\nAnother benefit to this lens is that it is compatible with Nikonâs teleconverters. That means that you can get up to twice the focal range for even more reach. And donât forget, an APS-C camera adds 1.5x (or about 750mm) to the lensâ reach as well. Unfortunately, it isnât fully weather-sealed, but it does offer a rotating tripod collar for better balance when using a tripod or monopod in either landscape or portrait orientation.\n\nBest budget DSLR lens: Nikon FX NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D\n\nSpecs\n\nLens mount: Nikon F, full-frame\n\nAperture range: f/1.8 â f/22\n\nImage stabilization: No\n\nFilter size: 52mm\n\nMinimum focus distance: 1.48 feet\n\nWeight: 5.47 ounces\n\nDimensions: 2.5 x 1.54 inches\n\nPros\n\nTiny and lightweight\n\nVery affordable\n\nExcellent image quality\n\nCons\n\nNeeds to be stopped down for the best performance\n\nDespite its low price and compact 2.5 by 1.5-inch size, this little Nikon lens is the perfect go-to lens for a variety of scenarios. It weighs a mere 5.5 ounces, so itâs a lightweight companion, making it ideal for travel or hiking adventures. The lens provides excellent sharpness so, but it does perform best when stopped down a few stops. At f/2.8 or so, the lens performs beautifully.\n\nOne caveat, though, is that this nifty fifty only works in manual focus with older cameras without an AF motor built-in, like the Nikon D40. If you use a body with the body-mounted screw to drive autofocus, it will focus quickly and accurately. These older 50mm lenses are getting a bit hard to find these days, so if you are thinking of picking one up, you may not want to wait much longer.\n\nEven more Nikon lenses to consider\n\nNikonâs 14-24mm f/2.8G lens for its F-mount cameras was the premier example of an ultra-wide-angle zoom lens across any brand, and this Z-mount version is even better. It is a pound lighter than the DSLR lens and features a handy OLED display. And it offers truly exceptional overall image quality with edge-to-edge sharpness. The fast f/2.8 aperture makes it an ideal choice for astrophotography, and the ultra-wide perspective with well-handled distortion is fantastic for real estate work.\n\nFor professional wildlife and sports photographers, you canât beat Nikonâs 600mm lens. It offers a bright f/4 aperture, stunning image quality, fast autofocus, and five stops of vibration reduction. But perhaps the most unique feature is the built-in 1.4x teleconverter. With a simple flip of a switch, youâll get 840mm reach. And since the teleconverter is integrated into the lens, it maintains the weather sealing as well as image quality. Nikon also makes a 400mm version with a built-in 1.4x teleconverter, resulting in a reach of 560mm, should you want something a little less dramatic.\n\nWhat to consider when buying the best Nikon lenses\n\nNikon has an extremely expansive list of lenses, especially when you are looking at both F-mount and Z-mount options. Choosing a lens can be challenging as a result, but careful consideration of the items below will help you find the best Nikon lens for your needs.\n\nFocal length\n\nThe first step to making any lens decision is narrowing down what focal length you need or want. To put it simply, focal length determines how much you see (angle of view) and how large things appear (magnification). A telephoto lens, which has a narrow angle of view and high magnification, wonât work for real estate photography. On the other hand, a wide-angle lens, with its wide view and low magnification, isnât ideal for most portrait and wildlife situations. As a result, itâs important to consider the types of images you want to create before choosing a focal length.\n\nThe other piece of the focal length puzzle is if you use an APS-C or full-frame camera. Focal lengths are listed in reference to their use on full-frame cameras. However, lenses used on APS-C cameras will result in a narrower angle of view due to the cameraâs crop factor. Because of this, you will need to take that into account when buying a lens for your APS-C camera. For example, if you want a wide-angle lens, you will need to go extra wide in order to actually have that wide angle of view on a crop sensor camera.\n\nPrime versus zoom\n\nOnce you know the focal length you want, you can decide if a prime or zoom lens is better for your needs. A prime lens offers a single focal length, while a zoom lens offers a range of focal lengths. Which is best mostly comes down to personal preference and your shooting style, but there are advantages and disadvantages to both.\n\nPrime lenses are typically higher in quality and can offer faster maximum apertures. They can also be more affordable. But they arenât as versatile since youâll need to be able to physically move or switch lenses to change the perspective. Zoom lenses are more convenient since you can simply zoom in or out to change the view. But the quality is typically slightly lower than prime lenses, and they can get very expensive.\n\nAperture\n\nThe maximum aperture of a lens is provided right in the name of the lens and is important for a few reasons. First, a wider aperture will let in more light, making it better in low-light conditions. Wedding photographers, astrophotographers, or anyone shooting indoors or in dark situations will want to prioritize a wide (also called fast) maximum aperture. Second, aperture is one factor in determining depth of field. If you want a shallow depth of field for greater separation of your subject and background, be sure to choose a lens with a wide maximum aperture.\n\nSome zoom lenses will feature a variable maximum aperture, such as f/4.5-5.6. This means that as you zoom in, you will get a smaller aperture and lose light. That can get frustrating when shooting in low light conditions or trying to achieve a shallow depth of field. Youâll have to pay more for a lens with a constant maximum aperture, but it may be worth it for you.\n\nSize\n\nLens size can be an especially important factor if you plan to travel or hike with the lens or if you have long shooting days, such as weddings. Lugging around a bulky piece of glass is not very fun if you arenât prepared for it. Nikon makes some excellent compact and lightweight options of popular focal lengths or zoom ranges, so be sure to check the size closely if that is something that is important to you.\n\nFAQs\n\nFinal thoughts on the best Nikon lenses\n\nBest Nikon mirrorless lenses\n\nBest overall: Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S\n\nBest wide-angle: Nikon NIKKOR Z 17-28mm f/2.8\n\nBest for portraits: Nikon NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.2 S\n\nBest telephoto: Nikon NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S\n\nBest budget: Nikon NIKKOR Z 50mm f/1.8 S Lens\n\nBest Nikon DSLR lenses\n\nBest F-mount lens overall: AF-S FX Nikon NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4\n\nBest F-mount telephoto zoom: AF-S FX NIKKOR 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens\n\nBest budget F-mount lens: Nikon FX NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D\n\nNikon makes lenses for just about every situation, from portraits to wildlife to real estate. It also makes lenses at a range of price points. Though the best lens comes down to what you want to shoot and your budget, chances are good that you will be able to find a Nikon lens that is suitable for your needs.\n\nWhy trust us\n\nPopPhoto has a long history of delivering the opinions of some of the sharpest and most prolific camera dorks the world has to offer. Since 1937, weâve been reviewing cameras, providing wisdom from well-known photographers, and generally just nerding out about all that goes into making great pictures. Our current crop of writers and editors have decades of professional photography and camera writing experience among them. Collectively, weâve probably shot with just about every camera and lens combo you can imagineâas well as some obscure stuff you may not even know about. Remember the Casio Tryx folding camera? PopPhoto does.\n\nWe also get that buying a camera is a big decision, which is why weâre dedicated to helping folks choose the right one (or, in our case âonesâ) for their needs. Case in point: Handing over top dollar for an expensive rig may leave you unsatisfied if it doesnât fit your preferred shooting style. Sure, a $6,000 sports-oriented DSLR can capture landscapes, but do you really need to do it at 30 frames-per-second? No, you donât."
