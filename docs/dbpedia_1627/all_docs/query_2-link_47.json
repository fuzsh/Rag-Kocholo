        "text": "Share with your friends!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNikon Lens Mounts\n\nIn this article, we will the talking about lenses from three different Nikon Lens mounts. The Z-Mount, the F-Mount and the 1-Mount.\n\nZ-Mount\n\nThe Nikon Z-Mount is an interchangeable lens mount that was introduced in 2018 alongside a new full-frame mirrorless camera system. The Z-Mount’s short 16mm flange distance and wide 55mm mount diameter will pave the way for a totally new series of Nikkor Z lenses that can use modern manufacturing techniques and optical design to attain even sharper lenses in a smaller and lighter package.\n\nAt introduction, Nikon launched three lenses for the Z-Mount, whilst at the same time providing a roadmap of future lens releases for this new format.\n\nAlongside the new Nikkor Z lenses and Z-Series mirrorless camera bodies, Nikon also launched the Nikon FTZ Mount Adapter. This adapter allows you to use the vast majority of Nikkor F-Mount lenses (approximately 36o lenses) on a camera that has a Z-Mount – great news for the millions of F-Mount lens owners out there!\n\nFull AF/AE is supported when using FX or DX AF-S Type G, D or E lenses, as well as AF-P type G and E lenses, and AF-I type D lenses. It’s also fully compatible with AF-S/AF-I Teleconverters.\n\nNote that there is no way to go the opposite way and mount Nikkor Z lenses on an F-Mount DSLR camera. The Z-Mount is simply far too wide.\n\nMost popular Z lenses: NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.8 S Lens | NIKKOR Z 50mm f/1.8 S Lens | NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S Lens\n\nF-Mount\n\nThe Nikon F-mount is Nikon’s standard DSLR lens mounting system. Introduced in 1959, F-mount lenses have been in production for over 50 years and the range currently encompasses over 400 Nikkor lenses; In the 1980s, with the coming of the auto-focus revolution Nikon, unlike other manufacturers, chose to adapt the F-mount rather than scrapping it in favour of a new auto-focus compatible lens mounting system. This decision cemented the F-mount’s unquestionable claim of being the largest interchangeable lens system ever manufactured.\n\nThe Nikon F-mount system features a high level of lens and camera compatibility; Many early manual-focus lenses can with slight modification be used on modern Nikon cameras, and many current Nikon lenses can be used on the original Nikon F SLR. It is worth noting however that some compatibility issues do exist, so be sure to check manufacturer documentation before experimenting with new combinations.\n\nNikon Lens Formats\n\nNikon Lens Types\n\nNikon Lens Abbreviations & Acronyms\n\nPin This Post"
