        "text": "As we all know, throughout the late 80's to 1st quarter of the 90's, the Nikon F4 era has truly given many Nikon photographers a helluva of a \"good time\" in terms of system compatibility among all the Manual Focus and Autofocus Nikkor lenses. Now we are stepping into the F6 era, and the F4 still has the BEST* compatibility factor among all the Nikon's.\n\n<<<---Credit: Mr. Desmond Lew Chee Wai from YL Camera for lending me his F5 and the AF-D 85mm f/1.8s for me to take a few shots appeared in this website. Copyright-free images collection © 2004 . http://www.IMAGES.com.my\n\nWhen the Nikon F90(x) was introduced, it had for the first time in 35mm photography, a new method of including the distance information into exposure calculation. The resulting implementation of this new 3D-Matrix Metering on Nikon SLRs saw the emergence of an entirely new series of Nikkor lenses which incorporated a distance chip in the lens. This relayed specific information back to a capable Nikon camera for exposure measurement.\n\nBy the time the Nikon F5 was announced in 1996, many of older version of AF-Nikkor had already been updated with this new idea. You cannot refer to this as coincidental, but rather a very well timed scheme in conjunction with the release of the F5. The one-generation up camera with the advanced 3D-Colour metering sensor would be able to tab onto the existence of the many AF-D Nikkor lenses that had been sold previously with Nikon D-capable SLRs. Well there is no doubt that the mighty Nikon F5 would require an AF-D Nikkor to bring out its best in ALL of its operations. However such a lens/camera combination has also resulted in making the Nikon F5 the poorest performer in terms of system compatibility with the new and older Nikkor optics. It is not easy to address the compatibility issues. But I will do my best to provide a rough guide and if I ever present them wrong, rectify this via the |Message Board| and I will patch them accordingly.\n\nLens Compatibility Chart\n\nWith AF Nikkor lenses or some selective lenses in combination with the older TC-16A autofocus Teleconverter, the F5 can provide full autofocus operation. Full manual focusing, or manual focusing with the F5's electronic rangefinder. This is available with virtually all Nikon F-mount Nikkor and Nikon lenses as long as they have a maximum aperture of f/5.6 or larger. Use the following table as a guide. Fortunately I have compiled a very good and in-depth resource regarding the MF-Nikkor and will use them as a link to show you the model and where it relates.\n\nCredit: Image courtesy of Mr. Kimmy Magino®Kimmy maintains an online portfolio on his own at Pbase.com which contains many other excellent images.

For a long time, one of the key weaknesses of the whole Nikon AF architecture was the adaptation of a totally camera driven AF-system during the 1st generation of the AF cameras. The system was more backwards in its compatibility so that the enormous amount of manual focus Nikkor's would be useable on the early AF SLRs. When Canon rebuilt its entire AF system with the EOS/EF framework, the weakness of the Nikon AF became very apparent. Beginning in 1992, Nikon subsequently replied to the external aggression from its rivals with a limited number of AF-I Series Nikkor super-tele which has a DC core-less motor built within. The AF-I lenses, which were limited to only three, are the early batch of Nikkor lenses that have a new M/A focus control (as well as 4 separate focus locks on the barrel) that allows manual fine focus in auto mode. Overall they were considerably faster than all previous AF Nikkor's. The AF-I Series is comprised of the early AF-I Nikkor 300mm f/2.8D IF-ED (1992); AF-I Nikkor 600mm f/4.0D IF-ED (1992); AF-I Nikkor 500mm f/4.0D IF-ED (1993) & AF-I Nikkor 400mm f/2.8D IF-ED (1994). These served as the core lens system to satisfy demands of professional photographers, who require this kind of high performance. These area's are generally wildlife and action photography. Naturally this series of Nikkor's is also genetically a D-lense in nature.\n\nBut one problem surfaced during this era. Nikon did not have a capable professional class SLR. The Nikon F90X - in every aspect can be regarded as a top quality imaging tool for serious photography. In figures it can also match some numbers in AF performance with the Canon giant killer the EOS-1n. But to expect Nikon photographers to be stuck with using a Nikon without seeing any \"signs\" possibility of a Super-Nikon in the future makes for a lengthy few years indeed and can be very frustrating. Many had bore the pain in the ass (pockets) and have switched to a different camp(s) .. .Credit: Image courtesy of Adorama® Inc. \"Ebay - Mathew Duren\" <ebay@adorama> Website URL: Adorama.com, who also operates a popular Ebay Store.

In fact brand loyalty has played a very important role in the long continuing success of Nikon. Although I don't quite agree with the \"popular\" thinking that AF-speed is one of the most important factors in modern photography. But still many feel it is the yard stick used when comparing various systems. The scope of exposure on media based photographers played an influential role in changing the perception of less-confidence photographers. They tend to feel that hardware plays the most important factor in their \"success\" or \"failure\". Too bad ...\n\nThe introduction of the Nikon F5 has somehow cast a magical spell for Nikon. It has reawakening with a more aggressive and positive attitude in their marketing as well as their product development. This is where the Nikkor lens family developed another major system upgrade with introduction of an AF-S series of Nikkor lenses in 1996 to replace the AF-I Nikkor. These new series of Nikkor lenses, with its lens integrated, \"Silent-Wave-Motor\" uses the theory of converting ultrasound waves into a more efficient means of rotary motion for a quieter and faster auto-focusing lens. This also reduces the amount of moving mechanical parts in a lens during operation that may contribute excessive fiction & noise. It also requires new software in the camera to maximize its performance. By making these changes Nikon has improved their performance in speed and power efficiency as well as as being much smoother and quieter during operation. Unlike the previous AF-I series which was confined to super-tele, some exciting AF-S lenses have started to appear in shorter focal lengths. During this same period, other optical developments have also been integrated into these lenses, most noticeably was the improved lens coating \"SIC\" process as well as extensive use of Aspherical elements. This has resulted in emergence of many existing if not exotic new Nikkor lenses.\n\nCredit: Image was\n\nretouched from\n\nan original\n\ndownloaded from\n\nNikon USA. The far\n\nleft image was a\n\nmodified\n\nscanned image\n\nfrom a Nikon\n\nmarketing\n\nleaftlet.\n\nTowards the \"end\" of the Nikon F5 generation, the vast majority of both film-based and digital Nikon SLRs have adopted the new Main/Sub Command Dials for camera control. We also saw a new breed of AF-Nikkor optic with removal of the conventional aperture ring where the minimum aperture lock is located as well as manually selected aperture value is no longer permissible. The radical change in these G-series Nikkor lenses also signifies possible withdrawal of future commitment to older MF Nikon SLRs. As one can observe with many of the new AF-S Nikkor lenses introduced lately also bear the G-series specification. Nikon photographers within a different \"age group\" (errr. like me) may have to decide what to face next. There is nothing wrong with this switch, as the Company has to move on for continual existence and to counter the threat of its rivals, it is only WE that are falling behind of all these \"drastic\" developments. But we have had a good time living with all the Nikkor-oldies all these years, right ? haha...\n\nDON\"T CURSE, Nikon.\n\n-03.2005-\n\nSupplements: A concerned Nikon user recently sent me a GOOD read which may be quite \"educational\", apparently it was extracted from an official Nikon site \"somewhere\", it says: - \"...What is a Nikon AF-G lens and how does it differs from a Nikon AF-D lens? Answer: .... will continue to introduce new AF-G lenses across the Nikkor range. The only difference between Nikon AF-D and AF-G lenses is that AF-G does not have an aperture ring. Studies reveal that few Professionals are now using lenses with aperture rings, the ability to electronically adjust exposures by 1/3 stop via the command dials far out performs manual ring adjustment, however experienced the user may be. A substantial weight saving is a secondary benefit too, G-type lenses like D-type lenses transmit distance information to the camera for 3D Matrix metering systems. The absence of an aperture ring affects the compatibility of the lens with certain cameras ... These lenses can physically be attached to the camera, but will not function....\". Errr...a typical Nikon assumption versus users perception.\n\nNOTE: the only Nikkor lense that truly meant for all* Nikon users for this entire generation of Nikon F5 was a pancake-sized, a beautifully chrome-finished Nikkor 45mm f/2.8P, which was introduced along with surprise debut of the Manual Focus Nikon FM3A in Feb. 2001 - that certainly was a rare treat for Nikon fans worldwide. It has been a long time since Nikon last introduced a MF lens for their cameras.\n\n* Compatible with all exposure modes of CPU-controlled Nikon SLRs.

But Nikon can argue some of these \"aged\" AF-S Nikkors are almost 10 years old now and should be phased out accordingly with newer ones ... |CLICK HERE.| (Well, Nikon USA does not have the GUTS to provide these kind of return results via their SITE SEARCH with simple keywords like: \"discontinued, Nikkor\". Singapore + Japan official sites do (native language for Japan). Perhaps they may be be worried about affecting buying sentiment ? Good news for all of us is, prices of used AF-S lenses will & SHOULD come down. hehe..\n\nNikon advised due to the renewed lens mounting ring, some of the following Nikkor lenses CANNOT be attached directly to the Nikon F5 even if requires mirror lockup, where relates: Fisheye 8mm f/8, Old-type 21mm f/4.0, Old-type PC 35mm f/3.5, Old-type Reflex 1000mm f/6.3 (brief info); AF Teleconverter TC-16; AF 80rnm f/2.8, 200mm f/3.5 ED-IF for F3AF\n\nThe following Nikkor lenses can be attached to the Nikon F5 after camera body modification.
