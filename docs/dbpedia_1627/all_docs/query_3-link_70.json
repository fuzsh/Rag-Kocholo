        "text": "Our definitive Nikon Z lens list now caters to full-frame and APS-C cameras, spanning native Nikon brilliance and innovative offerings from third-party makers.\n\nNikon Z Mount Official Lenses – A Complete List\n\nUse this guide to find every mirrorless Nikon lens, including all Nikon Z zoom lenses, all Nikon Z Prime lenses, and third-party lenses Z lenses.\n\nWhile F-mount lenses are still great (although they are all discontinued now), cameras with IBIS will revert to only 3-axis stabilization when using older F lenses.\n\nNikon Z-Mount Prime & Zoom Lenses\n\nHere is some information about the Nikon Z Lenses.\n\nThe S-line lenses have different focus features and speeds. For instance, the 85mm has a dual focus system for better close focus, while the 50mm f1.8 is the speediest lens to focus. The 26mm f2.8 uses an all-element focus system, but it is slower than the 28mm f2.8.\n\nThe S-line prime lenses aim to reduce the changes in field of view (focus breathing) when focusing. They also have silent aperture and focus systems for video recording. The aperture smoothly adapts to exposure changes during video shooting. The 85 f1.8 and f1.2 still have some focus breathing, but most of them are well controlled.\n\nThe S-line zoom lenses are versatile for video and still shooting, just like their prime lenses. Nikon is designing the whole system with video as a priority, and they are incorporating technology that enables the best performance for both video and stills.\n\nThe Z lenses do not have manual focus rings; instead, they use electronic focus systems. They also have weather sealing to protect them from dust and moisture.\n\nWhat to look for in different Nikon Z lenses when comparing.\n\nDual focus system: Some lenses, like the 85mm, have this system that improves close focus performance.\n\nReduced focus breathing: The S-line prime lenses try to minimize the changes in field of view when focusing. They also have silent aperture and focus systems for video shooting. The aperture smoothly adjusts to exposure changes during video recording. The 85 f1.8 and f1.2 still have some focus breathing, but most of them are well controlled.\n\nFocus-by-wire: None of the Z lenses have manual focus rings, but they use electronic focus systems instead. They also have weather sealing to protect them from dust and moisture.\n\nNikon Z Mount Third-Party Lens List\n\nMoving into the third-party lenses for the Nikon Z mount, we are now seeing some lenses with autofocus capabilities and protocols. Specifically, check out Tamron and Viltrox for Nikon’s third-party Z lenses.\n\nAmerican Lenses\n\nLensbaby Lenses For Nikon\n\nThese unconventional lenses prioritize artistic expression over clinical sharpness, offering manual control over focus effects like tilting for dramatic perspective shifts, twisting for swirling bokeh patterns, and adjusting the aperture for variable softness.\n\nGerman Lenses\n\nMeyer Optik Gorlitz Z Lenses\n\nMeyer Optik Görlitz lenses prioritize the classic charm over raw technical prowess, capturing subjects with a unique blend of character. Known for their distinctive bokeh swirls and smooth transitions, Meyer Optik lenses offer a nostalgic warmth and subtle vintage-inspired rendering.\n\nFrom the legendary Biotar’s dreamy orbs to the Trioplan’s ethereal soap bubble effect, each lens boasts a distinct personality.\n\nJapanese Lenses\n\nGizmon Z Lenses\n\nGizmon lenses offer entry-level and niche solutions for Nikon users. Their lineup primarily features prime lenses, including an f/1.6 pancake. Gizmon lenses prioritize affordability and portability. Compared to established brands, they may lack advanced features or high-end build quality.\n\nSigma Lenses For Nikon\n\nSigma offers a growing ecosystem of prime and zoom lenses spanning versatile everyday options to specialized telephoto reaches. Known for their balance of performance and value, Sigma Z mount lenses often feature fast apertures, robust construction, and advanced optical elements. Hopefully, we see more Sigma lenses come to the Nikon system.\n\nTamron Lenses\n\nTamron’s current lineup leans towards mid-range zooms, covering popular focal lengths like 24-70mm f/2.8 and 70-300mm f4.5-6.3, catering to everyday shooting needs and travel photography. Tamron lenses emphasize affordability and practicality, featuring lightweight designs and weather sealing for all-weather use. While not pushing the boundaries of optical performance, they deliver consistent sharpness and vibrant color rendition, making them well-suited for enthusiasts and budget-conscious professionals.\n\nTokina Lenses For Nikon\n\nTokina’s lens lineup remains limited today, offering a single super-telephoto option – the SZX 400mm f8 reflex mirror lens. This specialized lens caters to photographers seeking extreme reach on a budget, featuring a compact and lightweight design compared to traditional telephoto lenses. Notably, the SZX 400mm utilizes a reflex mirror design for a unique optical path, balancing cost with decent image quality.\n\nVoigtlander Lenses\n\nVoigtländer lenses typically prioritize character and craftsmanship over optical perfection. Voigtländer Z mount lenses often feature fast apertures, compact designs, and robust metal construction, evoking a nostalgic feel and tactile shooting experience.\n\nTheir lineup features diverse options, from wide-angle Apo-Lanthars to Nokton portraits and macro Apo-Ultrons, catering to specific needs and artistic visions. Their black paint on brass Vintage line has been very popular with film shooters.\n\nOverall, Voigtländer lenses provide a niche yet compelling alternative within the Z mount system, perfect for enthusiasts and professionals who value heritage, manual control, and distinct artistic expression.\n\nDo be careful with Voigtlander, I’ve reviewed several of the Voigtlander lenses and they are a little hit-and-miss. They often prioritize small-size lenses with faster apertures over corner-to-corner perfection. If you buy a tiny Voigtlander lens for convenience, it’s likely not going to be very impressive with its image quality.\n\nYasuhara Lenses for Nikon\n\nYasuhara has made a small and lightweight manual focus 35mm f1.8 lens. They may release a few more in the future.\n\nThe new Anthy 35mm f1.8 Features 9 elements in 7 groups. So far, I’m seeing nice contrast and sharpness, with the weakness being the vignetting. This might be a great place to start if you want to build out their prime manual lens collection.\n\nKorean Lenses\n\nSamyang / Rokinon Lenses\n\nSamyang shines through with two distinct offerings: the ultra-wide 14mm f/2.8 and the portrait-perfect 85mm f/1.4. Both lenses prioritize manual focus control and affordability, catering to enthusiasts and budget-conscious professionals.\n\nI’ve used Samyang lenses for years, and they’ve improved greatly. I would say their lenses are pretty good optically now, and their coatings are decent overall.\n\nThese lenses are worth exploring if you’re comfortable with manual focus and prioritize affordability and performance.\n\nRussian Lenses\n\nLomography / Zenit Lenses\n\nCurrently, Lomography’s presence is limited to a single lens, enabling users to explore the unique character of Zenit lenses on their modern Z cameras.\n\nTheir vintage Soviet-era lenses, primarily from the Helios and Industar lines, offer a blend of affordability, distinctive renderings, and manual focus operation. Known for their crazy swirling bokeh, soft vignettes, and vintage-inspired color shifts, Zenit lenses appeal to photographers seeking creative experimentation and artistic expression.\n\nSwiss Lenses\n\nIrix Lenses\n\nIrix lenses offer cine-inspired features and rugged construction. Their lineup leans heavily towards prime lenses with fast apertures, weather sealing, and internal focusing mechanisms, all geared towards smooth and reliable operation during video shoots.\n\nWith clickless aperture rings and fully manual focus lenses, their precise and tactile rings cater to the deliberate, controlled movements preferred by cinematographers.\n\nIrix lenses appeal to videographers and passionate filmmakers seeking high-quality optics, distinctive bokeh characteristics, and a professional shooting experience.\n\nChinese Lenses\n\n7Artisans Lenses\n\n7Artisans lenses offer primarily manual focus prime options for enthusiasts and casual photographers.\n\n7Artisans prioritize affordability and portability, featuring lightweight designs and simple construction. Their lenses generally deliver decent optical performance, making them suitable for basic everyday shooting and creative experimentation. Their offerings currently focus on APS-C systems, but we’re starting to see more full-frame lenses from them.\n\nAstrHori Z Lenses\n\nAstrHori lenses specialize in unique and unconventional offerings. Their current lineup features specialized designs like a 28mm f/13 micro probe lens for extreme close-up work, an 18mm f/8 wide-angle shift lens for creative architectural photography, and a macro lens with variable magnification.\n\nBrightin Star Z Lenses\n\nBrightin Star lenses offer budget-friendly prime options, primarily featuring manual focus lenses and covering common focal lengths.\n\nFunleader Z Lenses\n\nFunleader carves a quirky niche with manual focus prime lenses. Prioritizing affordability and compact designs, their offerings cater to casual photographers and enthusiasts seeking playful experimentation.\n\nWhile build quality and optics may not rival established brands, Funleader’s unique charm lies in its budget-friendly lenses.\n\nKipon “Elegant” Lenses For Nikon Z Mount\n\nKipon stands out for its diverse lens offerings, encompassing native design lenses and adapters. With their German designs and very high-end build quality, their lineup caters to enthusiasts and professionals.\n\nKipon is known for its manual-focus prime lenses, which showcase fast apertures and compact builds. It also offers adapters that allow the use of vintage optics from various mounts.\n\nKamLan Lenses\n\nKamlan’s is another budget-friendly brand focusing on manual focus prime lenses.\n\nThere aren’t too many of their lenses available for the Z mount, but hopefully, we will see more in the future, as I really like their Kamlan 50mm f1.1 mark II lens.\n\nMeike Lenses For Nikon Z Mount\n\nMeike is a third-party lens manufacturer that produces a variety of manual focus and autofocus lenses for Nikon Z-mount cameras. Their lenses are generally budget-friendly and offer a good value for the price. However, like with most third-party brands, they are not as well-built or optically sharp as some of the more expensive lenses from Nikon or other brands.\n\nIf you’re looking for a budget-friendly option, Meike is a good place to start. However, if you’re a serious photographer who needs the best possible image quality, you’ll want to consider lenses from Nikon or other high-end brands.\n\nMitakon Zhongyi Z Lenses\n\nMitakon Zhongyi, also known as ZY Optics, is a third-party lens manufacturer offering a range of manual focus prime lenses for Nikon Z-mount cameras. Their lenses are recognized for their exceptionally fast apertures, often pushing boundaries with options like f/0.95 and f/1.0. This caters to low-light shooting and shallow depth-of-field effects, but generally at the expense of autofocus and overall build quality compared to native Nikon offerings.\n\nMitakon’s Z-mount lineup currently features primes in focal lengths ranging from 20mm to 85mm, with the popular Speedmaster series being their flagship. These lenses incorporate high refractive index and ultra-low dispersion elements to combat chromatic aberrations and maintain sharpness, particularly at wider apertures. However, manual focus operation and potential quality control inconsistencies are aspects to consider.\n\nOverall, Mitakon Zhongyi Z lenses provide a niche option for Nikon Z users seeking extreme aperture speeds and unique aesthetic qualities. However, their manual focus nature and potentially less robust build may not suit all photographers, particularly those accustomed to native Nikon lenses or prioritizing autofocus capabilities.\n\nNiSi Lenses For Nikon\n\nCurrently, Nisi only offers one native Z-mount lens: the 15mm f/4 Sunstar ASPH. This ultra-wide prime lens is designed for landscape, seascape, architecture, and interior photography, and is known for its unique 10-blade aperture that produces distinct 10-point sunstars throughout the aperture range.\n\nNisi primarily focuses on filter systems for existing lenses, offering a wide range of 100mm and 150mm filter holders compatible with various Nikon Z-mount lenses. So, while their native lens selection is currently limited, their filter ecosystem provides extensive creative control for Z-mount photographers.\n\nNisi also developed Cine lenses, but we’ve yet to see any of those lenses come over to the Nikon mount.\n\nOpteka Lenses\n\nOpteka offers a limited range of manual focus lenses for Nikon Z-mount cameras, primarily catering to the super-telephoto and budget segments. Their lenses are known for their affordability but generally come with trade-offs in terms of build quality, optical performance, and autofocus capabilities compared to native Nikon or other high-end brands.\n\nOpteka Z lenses may be suitable for hobbyists on a tight budget who prioritize extreme focal lengths. However, their manual focus, potentially lower build quality, and limited availability of wider prime lenses make them less appealing to professional or experienced users seeking autofocus functionality and top-tier optical performance\n\nPergear Lenses For Nikon\n\nPergear is a rising name in the third-party lens market, offering a growing selection of manual focus prime lenses for Nikon Z-mount cameras. Their lenses aim to strike a balance between affordability and decent optical performance, appealing to budget-conscious photographers and enthusiasts.\n\nOverall, Pergear Z-mount lenses provide a valuable entry point for Nikon Z users seeking affordable manual focus options for various photographic genres. While they come with limitations inherent to third-party lenses, their budget-friendly pricing and decent performance make them a viable alternative for hobbyists and enthusiasts looking to expand their lens collection without breaking the bank.\n\nRock Star\n\nRockstar makes a lens cap lens for the Z Mount. You might be able to find it on eBay.\n\nThey also have a 35mm f1.8 that looks almost exactly like the Yasuhara Anthy 35mm f1.8. The Yansuhara Anthy35 is a very good lens that I’ve reviewed.\n\nI’m not sure Rock Star is a real company, but possibly just someone rebadging OEM lenses.\n\nSIRUI Z Lenses\n\nSirui, primarily known for tripods and other camera accessories, has dipped its toes into the Nikon Z-mount lens market with a unique focus: anamorphic lenses. These specialized lenses capture a wider horizontal field of view, creating the distinctive stretched “cinematic” look often seen in movies.\n\nKey characteristics of Sirui Z anamorphic lenses include:\n\nManual focus: Like most anamorphic lenses, Sirui’s offerings require manual focus operation.\n\nMetal construction: Both lenses boast durable metal construction for a premium feel.\n\nCine-style markings: Focus and aperture markings are displayed in both T-stops and f-stops for convenient use in video workflows.\n\nCharacterful bokeh: The lenses are known for their pleasing oval-shaped bokeh, adding a distinctive touch to your footage.\n\nSirui Z anamorphic lenses cater to a niche audience of filmmakers and videographers seeking a unique cinematic aesthetic for their projects. While their manual focus operation might not suit all photographers, their affordability and distinctive optical qualities make them a compelling option for creative video creators on a budget.\n\nTTArtisan Nikon Z Lenses\n\nTTArtisan is a Chinese manufacturer offering a rapidly expanding range of manual focus lenses for Nikon Z-mount cameras. They cater to budget-conscious photographers and enthusiasts who prioritize affordability and vintage aesthetics over high-end features and autofocus.\n\nKey characteristics of TTArtisan Z lenses include:\n\nManual focus: All lenses require manual focus operation, demanding precise control and potentially limiting them for fast-paced action photography.\n\nMetal construction: While not as robust as some professional lenses, many models feature metal construction for a solid feel.\n\nVintage-inspired aesthetics: Often showcasing rounded shapes, knurled focus rings, and clickless apertures, reminiscent of classic manual lenses.\n\nGenerally good optical performance: TTArtisan lenses often deliver decent sharpness and image quality, especially considering their budget-friendly pricing.\n\nHowever, some potential drawbacks to consider:\n\nQuality control inconsistencies: Some users report occasional QC issues, so thorough testing before purchase might be advisable.\n\nLimited autofocus offerings: Currently, TTArtisan only offers autofocus functionality in one lens, the AF 27mm f/2.8 APS-C.\n\nOverall, TTArtisan Z lenses provide a compelling option for Nikon Z users seeking affordable manual focus lenses with a vintage flair. While they come with limitations inherent to third-party lenses, their budget-friendly pricing, range of focal lengths, and decent image quality make them a viable choice for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and photographers looking to experiment with manual focus photography.\n\nVenus Optics Nikon Z Lenses\n\nThe Venus Optic Laowa brand offers a wide range of lenses, with a focus on ultrawide lenses with no distortion. They also have standard and telephoto lenses with macro features and some zoom lenses. They have a unique line of Cine and Anamorphic cine lenses as well.\n\nSome of the lenses have different aperture options. The lower apertures create better sun stars and the higher apertures produce smoother bokeh when stopped down.\n\nSome of the Cine lenses let you choose the units for the markings and the colors for the flares.\n\nLaowa lenses tend to have a more clinical and high-element look. This list includes APS-C and Super35mm lenses. To see more details, including the 35mm equivalent for APS-C cameras, click the + sign next to the lens name.\n\nViltrox Z Mount lenses\n\nViltrox, a well-established manufacturer of third-party lenses, offers a growing and diverse lineup. They aim to strike a balance between affordability and optical performance, appealing to budget-conscious photographers and enthusiasts.\n\nKey characteristics of Viltrox Z lenses include:\n\nAutofocus and manual focus options: Some lenses offer autofocus, while others are manual focus only, catering to different user preferences and budgets.\n\nMetal construction: Many models feature durable metal construction for a quality feel.\n\nSome potential drawbacks to consider:\n\nBuild quality might not match native Nikon lenses: While generally good, build quality might be a step below high-end native options.\n\nAutofocus performance might not be as fast or consistent as native Nikon lenses: Autofocus speed and accuracy may vary depending on the specific lens and camera body combination.\n\nOverall, Viltrox Z lenses offer a budget-friendly alternative to native Nikon options, providing decent performance and features for the price. They’re a viable choice for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and photographers seeking value without compromising too much on quality.\n\nI’ve reviewed the Viltrox 35mm AF lenses of the Nikon system and it was overall a good value for the price and does offer a different rendering than the Nikon 35mm f1.8 S lens. While I consider a lot of the Nikon S lenses to have a little bit more of a dreamier vibe, the Viltrox 35mm f1.8 was a bit more crunchy and classic.\n\nYongnuo Lenses For Nikon\n\nYongnuo Z lenses offer a budget-friendly entry point. While they come with limitations inherent to third-party lenses, their affordability and decent performance make them a viable option for hobbyists.\n\nNikon Z-Mount Adapters\n\nSo far we only have the official Nikon F to Z mount adapter. It will autofocus AF/AE with E, G, D Lenses.\n\nD lenses will not be able to have autofocus.\n\nThird Part to Nikon Adapters\n\nWhen buying dumb adapters, I’ve found Kipon to be the best quality although they are a bit more expensive, except for maybe Novoflex. It’s important to get a higher quality adapter when buying an adapter for Leica M or M42 since those lenses are a bit more difficult to get on and off and sometimes can get stuck.\n\nFor Leica M lenses, you can jump up to a Helicoid adapter. Leica M lenses have a pretty far minimum focus distance. Having the Helicoid allows you to adjust the length of the adapter for a closer focus.\n\nFor AF adapters, I have the Techart Sony FE to Z adapter. It’s great for adapting AF lenses and autofocus works, but it’s not very fast or reliable. It seems to use contrast-detect mostly so there is a lot of pulsing action as it tries to fine-tune focus. If you put it on AF-S and use a center point, then it’s fine. It’s like shooting with an old DSLR.\n\nThe Autofocus Techart Adapter will not allow you to use non-CPU Sony lenses. You won’t be able to engage the shutter for some reason, I had to buy a Pixco Sony FE to Z adapter to use my non-CPU MF Sony lenses.\n\nNote: The Techart FE to Z adapter does not fit on the Nikon Z50 APS-C camera. There isn’t enough space for part of the adapter to recess into the camera since the Z50 is a little shallower near the mount.\n\nThere are a million other adapters out there for various exotic lenses. It would be futile for me to try to list them all here. But here are some nice options for what’s popular.\n\nNikon Z Mount Lenses Conclusions\n\nBuilding the most complete guide to Nikon Z-mount lenses is a collaborative effort! I’m continuously expanding this list with in-depth reviews, and your input is invaluable. If you discover a lens I haven’t covered or spot any mistakes, please share your knowledge and help me keep this resource up-to-date."
