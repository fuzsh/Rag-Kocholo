What is the difference between AF and AFD lenses?

Enables the 3-D element of 3-D Matrix Metering on bodies which support it. Advantage is most noticeable when using TTL flash.\n\nI've not owned either AF 28mm lens, but as I understand it, the 28mm lens was completely re-designed when the AF-D variant was released. Much better build and optical quality in the AF-D.\n\nIan\n\nPhotoJim\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n2,316\n\nLocation\n\nRegina, SK, CA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nSep 9, 2008\n\n#3\n\nThe 28/2.8D has one more element than the non-D and is a much better performer. It is also usually significantly more costly, for this reason. However, if you can afford it the D is worth the difference in price most times.\n\nThe D lens will work slightly better with flash (as Ian said) but the difference is subtle, most noticeable when shooting subjects that are very dark or very light (like brides and grooms).\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nMarkok765\n\nJoined\n\nApr 26, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,263\n\nLocation\n\nOntario, Can\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nSep 9, 2008\n\n#4\n\nThe 28mm 2.8 AFD is 160, or 20 more than the non D version on Keh.\n\nvet173\n\nJoined\n\nMar 29, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,209\n\nLocation\n\nSeattle\n\nFormat\n\n8x10 Format\n\nSep 9, 2008\n\n#5\n\nThe D version will tell the flash what the zoom is at and set zoom feature of flash to match.\n\nPhotoJim\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n2,316\n\nLocation\n\nRegina, SK, CA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nSep 9, 2008\n\n#6\n\nThe D version will tell the flash what the zoom is at and set zoom feature of flash to match.\n\nI don't think that's unique to D lenses.

Nikons literature states the D lens sends distance info to camera for 3-d matrix metering.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nMarkok765\n\nJoined\n\nApr 26, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,263\n\nLocation\n\nOntario, Can\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nSep 10, 2008\n\n#9\n\nAnyone know how is the light fall off with the D version of this lens?\n\nPoohblah\n\nJoined\n\nAug 30, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n436\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 11, 2008\n\n#10\n\nAnyone know how is the light fall off with the D version of this lens?\n\ni doubt it's very different from any other 20mm f/2.8 lens.\n\neven if you routinely shot wide open, i wouldn't consider it a big deal.\n\nPhotoJim\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n2,316\n\nLocation\n\nRegina, SK, CA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nSep 11, 2008\n\n#11\n\nAnyone know how is the light fall off with the D version of this lens?\n\nIt's fine. Not perfect, but perfection does not exist.\n\nCheck out the back issues of Popular Photography at your local library.
