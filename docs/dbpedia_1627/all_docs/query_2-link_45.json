        "text": "If you’re using a Nikon Z camera, it’s important to check before buying any non-Z-series lenses to make sure they’re compatible with Nikon’s FTZ and FTZ II adapters. This comprehensive article goes into the compatibility of various Nikon and third-party lenses when using these FTZ adapters.\n\nAlthough the FTZ adapter is a good way to use F-mount lenses on one of Nikon’s mirrorless cameras, doing so can come with some compromises. Most of Nikon’s newest lenses work without any missing features, but plenty of older lenses or third-party options have only partial compatibility. I’ve seen a few sites with compatibility charts for the Nikon-brand lenses, but none with all the third-party options on the same page. So, hopefully you find this comparison useful.\n\nNote that although there are some construction differences between the FTZ and FTZ II adapters, all these compatibility results are identical between the two adapters. Throughout the remainder of this article, I’ll refer to everything as the FTZ adapter instead of the FTZ II.\n\nNikon NIKKOR Brand Lenses\n\nWe’ll start with Nikon-brand lenses, most of which are at least partly compatible with the FTZ adapter. Here’s where they stand.\n\nNikon AF-P and AF-S Lenses\n\nFeatureCompatibility\n\n*Automatic distortion control, vignetting correction, and diffraction compensation affect JPEG files and the in-camera image review, but do not directly affect raw files\n\nAutofocusYesElectronic Rangefinder in Manual FocusYesFocus PeakingYesAperture Control via CameraYesFull EXIF DataYesMatrix, Spot, and Center-Weighted MeteringYesHighlight Priority MeteringYesManual ModeYesAperture Priority ModeYesShutter Priority, Program, and Auto ModeYesAutomatic Distortion and Vignetting Control*YesDiffraction Compensation*YesFocus Shift ShootingYesIn-Body Image StabilizationYesCompatibility SummaryFully compatible;

these lenses don’t have electronic contacts, so several of the missing features aren’t surprising\n\nAside from everything mentioned above, there are a few minor, highly-specific compatibility issues not included in the charts above. For example, Nikon specifically mentions that if you use the AI Nikkor 500mm f/4P or the AI 1200–1700mm f/5.6-8P on the FTZ adapter, the meter may not be totally accurate, and you’ll need to use exposure compensation more often. Congrats to all (checks notes) 35 people worldwide who own a copy of the 1200-1700mm f/5.6-8 for getting a callout. The rest of these special-case differences are covered in Nikon’s full FTZ adapter PDF.\n\nAlso note that Nikon has stated that the following lenses are incompatible with the FTZ adapter, and attempting to mount them could damage either the adapter or the lens:\n\nNon-AI lenses\n\nIX-NIKKOR\n\nTC-16A AF Teleconverter\n\nLenses that require the AU-1 focusing unit (400mm f/4.5, 600mm f/5.6, 800mm f/8, 1200mm f/11)\n\nFisheye 6mm f/5.6, 7.5mm f/5.6, 8mm f/8, and OP 10mm f/5.6\n\n2.1cm f/4\n\nK2 Extension Ring\n\n180-600mm f/8 ED (serial numbers 174041-174180)\n\n360-1200mm f/11 ED (serial numbers 174031-174127)\n\n200-600mm f/9.5 (serial numbers 280001-300490)\n\nAF lenses for the F3AF (AF 80mm f/2.8, AF 200mm f/3.5 ED, TC-16 AF Teleconverter)\n\nPC 28mm f/4 (serial number 180900 or earlier)\n\nPC 35mm f/2.8 (serial numbers 851001-906200)\n\nPC 35mm f/3.5 (old type)\n\nReflex 1000mm f/6.3 (old type)\n\nNIKKOR-H Auto 2.8cm f/3.5 (28mm f/3.5) lenses with serial numbers below 362000\n\nNIKKOR-S Auto 3.5cm f/2.8 (35mm f/2.8) lenses with serial numbers below 928000\n\nNIKKOR-S Auto 5cm f/2 (50mm f/2)\n\nNIKKOR-Q Auto 13.5cm f/3.5 (135mm f/3.5) lenses with serial numbers below 753000\n\nMicro-NIKKOR 5.5cm f/3.5\n\nMedical-NIKKOR Auto 200mm f/5.6\n\nAuto NIKKOR Telephoto-Zoom 85-250mm f/4-4.5\n\nAuto NIKKOR Telephoto-Zoom 200-600mm f/9.5-10.5\n\nIn practice, most F-mount non-AI lenses can be mounted successfully on the Nikon FTZ adapter without damaging it, such as many of Nikon’s pre-AI lenses from before 1977. However, if you do damage anything, it will not be covered under warranty, so proceed very carefully and at your own risk. Consider using a cheaper adapter than the FTZ, such as Fotasy’s $16 version, and don’t apply more force than normal. If the lens does successfully mount, you will have all the same features as the non-CPU lenses shown a moment ago.\n\nNext, I’ll cover third-party lenses from Sigma, Tamron, and Zeiss. Even though many of these lenses work great, note that even some “fully compatible” lenses may not work quite as well on the FTZ adapter compared to using a DSLR. For example, they may be louder when focusing, or sometimes a bit slower to focus. There are also some general drawbacks compared to Nikon lenses: Some do not work with the focus shift feature, and none have the automatic distortion or vignetting control features. If any of those are critical to you, make your lens purchasing decisions accordingly.\n\nSigma Brand Lenses\n\nWhile some popular Sigma lenses had initial issues with the FTZ adapter, many of the biggest problems have been fixed with firmware updates. Here’s how they stand now.\n\nFully compatible:\n\nSIGMA 12-24mm F4 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 14-24mm F2.8 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG OS HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 60-600mm F4.5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Sports\n\nSIGMA APO 70-200mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM\n\nSIGMA APO 70-300mm F4-5.6 DG MACRO\n\nSIGMA 70-300mm F4-5.6 DG MACRO\n\nSIGMA 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Contemporary\n\nSIGMA 120-300mm F2.8 DG OS HSM | Sports\n\nSIGMA 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Contemporary\n\nSIGMA 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Sports\n\nSIGMA APO 200-500mm F2.8 / 400-1000mm F5.6 EX DG\n\nSIGMA APO 300-800mm F5.6 EX DG HSM\n\nSIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 20mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 24mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 35mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 105mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 135mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 500mm F4 DG OS HSM | Sports\n\nSIGMA MACRO 105mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM\n\nSIGMA APO MACRO 150mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM\n\nSIGMA APO MACRO 180mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 8-16mm F4.5-5.6 DC HSM\n\nSIGMA 10-20mm F3.5 EX DC HSM\n\nSIGMA 18-35mm F1.8 DC HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 18-300mm F3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM | Contemporary\n\nSIGMA 50-100mm F1.8 DC HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 4.5mm F2.8 EX DC CIRCULAR FISHEYE HSM\n\nSIGMA 10mm F2.8 EX DC FISHEYE HSM\n\nSIGMA 30mm F1.4 DC HSM | Art\n\nFully compatible, if firmware is current:\n\n50mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art (Previously, when the subject was extremely out of focus, autofocus wouldn’t always engage and might need to be restarted a few times.)\n\n24-35mm F2 DG HSM | Art (Previously, had an issue where it would occasionally “stop recording” when shooting video, according to Sigma.)\n\n85mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art (Previously, would overexpose occasionally when stopping down the aperture from f/5.6.)\n\nAutofocus not recommended:\n\nAPO 800mm F5.6 EX DG HSM (Of this lens, Sigma says “it is difficult to achieve sufficient focusing accuracy” and “please use manual focus.”)\n\nIn-camera IBIS remains permanently on, and camera’s “auto timer off” does not work, so camera must be turned off manually:\n\nSIGMA 17-50mm F2.8 EX DC OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 17-70mm 2.8-4 DC MACRO OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 17-70mm 2.8-4 DC MACRO OS HSM | Contemporary\n\nSIGMA 18-50mm F2.8-4.5 DC OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM | Contemporary\n\nSIGMA 18-250mm F3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 18-250mm F3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM | Art\n\nSIGMA 50-200mm F4-5.6 DC OS HSM\n\nSIGMA 70-300mm F4-5.6 DG OS\n\nLenses which won’t autofocus:\n\nAll of Sigma’s newest lenses have a built-in autofocus motor, so they will autofocus with the Nikon FTZ adapter without issue. (This includes every lens listed above.) However, some of the oldest and discontinued Sigma lenses do not have a built-in motor, so they will not autofocus with the FTZ.\n\nTamron Brand Lenses\n\nA number of popular Tamron lenses are manual-focus-only with the FTZ adapter. Here are the lists.\n\nFully compatible:\n\n10-24mm F/3.5-4.5 Di II VC HLD (Model B023)\n\nSP 15-30mm F/2.8 Di VC USD (Model A012)\n\nSP 15-30mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 (Model A041)\n\n17-35mm F/2.8-4 Di OSD (Model A037)\n\n18-400mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC HLD (Model B028)\n\nSP 24-70mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 (Model A032)\n\n35-150mm F/2.8-4 Di VC OSD (Model A043)\n\nSP 70-200mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 (Model A025)\n\n70-210mm F/4 Di VC USD (Model A034)\n\nSP 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Di VC USD (Model A030)\n\n100-400mm F/4.5-6.3 Di VC USD (Model A035)\n\nSP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2 (Model A022)\n\nSP 35mm F/1.4 Di USD (Model F045)\n\nSP 35mm F/1.8 Di VC USD (Model F012)\n\nSP 45mm F/1.8 Di VC USD (Model F013)\n\nSP 85mm F/1.8 Di VC USD (Model F016)\n\nSP 90mm F/2.8 Di MACRO1:1 VC USD (Model F004)\n\nAll features technically work, but autofocus is inconsistent:\n\nSP 90mm F/2.8 Di MACRO1:1 VC USD (Model F017)\n\nManual focus only:\n\n16-300mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD MACRO (Model B016)\n\n18-200mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC (Model B018)\n\n18-270mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD (Model B008TS)\n\n18-270mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD (Model B008)\n\nSP 24-70mm F/2.8 Di VC USD (Model A007)\n\nSP AF 28-75mm F/2.8 XR Di LD Aspherical [IF] MACRO (Model A09)\n\n28-300mm F/3.5-6.3 Di VC PZD (Model A010)\n\nSP 70-200mm F/2.8 Di VC USD (Model A009)\n\nSP 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Di VC USD (Model A005)\n\nSP AF 90mm F/2.8 Di MACRO 1:1 (Model 272E)\n\nManual focus only, and vibration compensation does not work:\n\nSP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD (Model A011)\n\nNote that some of the “fully compatible” lenses may still require a firmware update before they work with the FTZ adapter without any issues. If you buy any of these lenses new, Tamron has likely already installed the most recent firmware, but if you’ve had the lens for years, you might need to send it off for an update (or use Tamron’s tap-in console).\n\nTokina Brand Lenses\n\nThere are only six Tokina lenses with specific notices about FTZ adapter incompatibility. Here they are:\n\nAT-X 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 DX fisheye (no built-in focus motor; manual focus only)\n\nAT-X 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 DX NH fisheye (no built-in focus motor; manual focus only)\n\nATX-I 100mm f/2.8 macro (no built-in focus motor; manual focus only)\n\nAT-X 100mm f/2.8 PRO macro (no built-in focus motor; manual focus only)\n\nOpera 50mm f/1.4 (autofocus is slower with the FTZ adapter than natively on a DSLR)\n\nAT-X 70-200mm f/4 FX VCM-S (autofocus communication error; manual focus only)\n\nZeiss Brand Lenses\n\nAll Zeiss lenses work as expected. ZF.2 lenses have full EXIF data and allow aperture to be changed via the camera’s command dial; non-CPU Zeiss lenses work like all non-CPU lenses on the FTZ adapter (see below).\n\nNon-CPU Lenses from Various Brands\n\nFor lenses without any electronic contacts, the FTZ adapter has the following limitations:\n\nFeatureCompatibility\n\n*Automatic distortion control, vignetting correction, and diffraction compensation affect JPEG files and the in-camera image review, but do not directly affect raw files\n\nAutofocusNo, but there never wasElectronic Rangefinder in Manual FocusNoFocus PeakingYesAperture Control via CameraNo, but not expected of a non-CPU lensFull EXIF DataNo; FTZ adapter doesn’t have an aperture feeler ringMatrix, Spot, and Center-Weighted MeteringYesHighlight Priority MeteringNoManual ModeYesAperture Priority ModeYesShutter Priority, Program, and Auto ModeNo, but not expected of a non-CPU lensAutomatic Distortion and Vignetting Control*No, but not expected of a non-CPU lensDiffraction Compensation*No, but not expected of a non-CPU lensFocus Shift ShootingNo, but not expected of a manual focus lensIn-Body Image StabilizationYes, if proper non-CPU lens data is enteredCompatibility SummaryPartially compatible; these lenses don’t have electronic contacts, so several of the missing features aren’t surprising\n\nThis is the same chart as the “Nikon AI, AI-S, AI Converted, and Series E Lenses” shown earlier in the article, since those are non-CPU lenses as well. With such lenses, you can save quite a bit of money over the FTZ adapter by simply buying the $16 Fotasy F to Z adapter. But if you already have an FTZ lying around, you can use it, too.\n\nBe careful not to force any lens onto the FTZ adapter. Non-CPU lenses with an F-mount are highly unlikely to damage the FTZ, but it is possible that some broken or very unusual non-CPU lenses could do so, and it would not be covered by warranty.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdapted lenses don’t always have the full capabilities of native lenses, but they often have advantages in price and specialization that makes them worth considering anyway. I hope this article helped you figure out what lenses to use with your FTZ adapter or FTZ II. Although there are some disappointing incompatibilities – especially the lack of autofocus on Nikon AF-D lenses – there are some good points, too.\n\nThanks to features like focus peaking, in-body image stabilization, and metering in aperture-priority mode (even with non-CPU lenses), the FTZ adapter can breathe new life into some classic lenses. I’ve had fun using the FTZ with some non-CPU macro lenses like the Laowa 25mm f/2.8 2.5-5× and 100mm f/2.8 2× Ultra Macro, and even the 58mm f/1.2 Noct-Nikkor that I had a chance to use a few years ago.\n\nLet me know in the comments if you have any questions about these lenses. I did my best to cross-reference the most recent sources, especially on third-party lenses, but if I’m missing any information or got something wrong, please let me know. I want to make this the best possible resource for anyone with questions about Nikon FTZ adapter lens compatibility!"
