Looking on ebay and amazon there are lots that to me would be the same but I assume they are different so I tried looking into them a bit and now I am confused as to which would work on my camera and which is best.\n\nWould a Nikon AF 70-300 work on a D3500?\n\nWould a Nikon AF-S 70-300 work?\n\nDo I need to get vibration reduction using a lens that goes to 300mm?\n\nThank you in advance for any advice, I have had such great reccomendations on here already.\n\nKind Regards\n\nJoe\n\nAZ6\n\nMessages\n\n1,022\n\nEdit My Images\n\nNo\n\n31 May 2020\n\n#2\n\nThey are simply terms for AF systems; AF-S stands for 'Auto Focus Silent wave motor', and AF-P is 'AF Pulse motor'. Basically just marketing terms really*. AF-P lenses are supposedly quicker at focussing or summat. Both types will work on your D3500. Yes, Vibration Reduction is very useful especially on telephoto lenses.\n\n\"The AF-P designation means that a lens uses a pulse motor, hence the \"P.\" The pulse motor relies on stepping motors to move elements inside the lens to achieve focus. This is in contrast to AF-S lenses, which use Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) and rely on rotational energy to focus a lens's optics.\"\n\n*An AF-P lens I had was noticeably quicker at focussing than the AF-S version I'd had previously (which wasn't slow anyway). It's generally a good idea to get the latest tech. It wouldn't matter too much if you didn't though, and if the AF-S version is cheaper, then that's money that can be spent on summat else. I wouldn't lose sleep over it though; the VR function is far more useful in terms of aiding picture taking, imo.\n\nLast edited: 31 May 2020\n\nMessages\n\n1,672\n\nName\n\nAndy\n\nEdit My Images\n\nYes\n\n31 May 2020\n\n#3\n\nYou also need to make sure that the lens has a built in AF motor.

I've been using Nikon equipment for nearly 30 years, and I'm still baffled by all the acronyms! Yes; the 'G' designation means there is no mechanical aperture control (so such lenses cannot work in Manual or Aperture Priority modes on older film cameras). I wasn't aware of any 'G' lenses that weren't AF-S; there can only be a couple, surely? I'd be interested to know which 'G' lenses don't have internal AF motors; every day's a schoolday!\n\nAnyway. Back to the OP:\n\nIf you just want a lens that works with your current camera, then 4-7 in Retune's helpful post will be fine. The other issue of confusion is the 'DX' designation; this relates to camera sensor size. Your camera has a 'DX' or APS-C sensor. Therefore, 'DX' designated lenses are perfect for your camera. These won't work properly with cameras with larger sensors, though, so if you plan to upgrade to the larger format in future, then those DX lenses won't be much use. So there is the AF-P 70-300mm zoom, and the DX AF-P 70-300mm zoom, just to confuse you more. Both will work fine with your camera, but only the non-DX version will work properly with 'FX' or 'full frame' cameras with the larger sensors.\n\nSorry, this is just getting really bogged down in details. But either of those will be fine; the DX version is a lot cheaper.\n\nMessages\n\n315\n\nName\n\nTed\n\nEdit My Images\n\nYes\n\n1 Jun 2020\n\n#15\n\nThe long lens I use on my D3500...…£150 to £200 new.....for the price brilliant.\n\nI leave VR on at all times....why not?\n\nNikon 70-300mm VR AFP\n\nf/4.5-6.3 DX ED\n\nKen Rockwell's review:-\n\nhttps://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/70-300mm-vr-afp.htm\n\nLast edited: 1 Jun 2020\n\nMessages\n\n3,991\n\nName\n\nAdam\n\nEdit My Images\n\nYes\n\n1 Jun 2020\n\n#16\n\nIsn’t AFP also designated E not G for electronic diaphragm apperture control rather than mechanical like G models are ?\n\nMessages\n\n7,701\n\nEdit My Images\n\nNo\n\n1 Jun 2020\n\n#17\n\nNikon themselves sometimes seem confused about compatibility. This spreadsheet ought to be the final word on the issue for the dSLRs:\n\nhttps://nikonsupport.eu/europe/images/5532/LCC_En.xlsx\n\nBut it doesn't entirely agree with this page on the AF-P lenses:\n\nhttps://www.nikonimgsupport.com/eu/BV_article?lang=en_GB&articleNo=000035705\n\nThe spreadsheet says that the D800 won't autofocus with the AF-P DX lenses, whereas the AF-P page (I believe correctly) says it will (with limitations, and only if you have the latest firmware). This may be a minor point, as most people wouldn't want to use a DX lens on an FX camera like the D800 (as above, it won't cover the full sensor area, and although you can select DX cropping with a viewfinder mask, that's like shooting through a letterbox on FX). But Nikon really should get this stuff right.\n\nKen Rockwell, above, is also wrong about this and several other things (e.g., he incorrectly states that AF-P in general won't work on the D800).\n\nLast edited: 1 Jun 2020\n\nMessages\n\n7,701\n\nEdit My Images\n\nNo\n\n1 Jun 2020\n\n#18\n\nIsn’t AFP also designated E not G for electronic diaphragm apperture control rather than mechanical like G models are ?\n\nThese are separate things. Versions (5) and (6) are G, but (7) is E. Electronic aperture control is another technology that breaks compatibility with the film cameras and early dSLRs.\n\nLast edited: 1 Jun 2020\n\nAZ6\n\nMessages\n\n1,022\n\nEdit My Images\n\nNo\n\n1 Jun 2020\n\n#19\n\nIsn’t AFP also designated E not G for electronic diaphragm apperture control rather than mechanical like G models are ?\n\nGood lord. Even more confusion. I hadn't even thought about that.\n\nNikon themselves sometimes seem confused about compatibility.\n\nYou're not wrong. It's a nightmare.\n\nThe spreadsheet says that the D800 won't autofocus with the AF-P DX lenses, whereas the AF-P page (I believe correctly) says it will (with limitations, and only if you have the latest firmware).\n\nI bought a D3300 actually on Dec 31st 2016. It came in a kit with the then brand new AF-P lens. The camera's firmware was the latest version and allowed full function with the lens (albeit in either DX mode or with a heavily vignetted image). A firmware update also allowed full function on my older D600, which is only slightly younger than the D800. I think the caveat was that you can't turn the VR on or off, as that's an in-menu command. I can't remember. I do know that it did work fine with my D600 in all other respects, certainly AF.\n\n\"The camera does not offer the \"Manual focus ring in AF mode\" custom setting for enabling/disabling focus ring operation in autofocus mode.\"\n\nAccording to that spreadsheet. Meh. I only mounted it on the D600 to see if it would work. It did.\n\nKen Rockwell, above, is also wrong about this and several other things\n\nKen tends to do a LOT of cutting and pasting of specs, but doesn't actually use a lot of the gear he 'reviews', beyond praps handling stuff in a shop. So much of his stuff is just utter guff. I stopped considering him a source of reliable content very soon after I discovered his site.

Nikon have had what, 4? S-mount, F-mount, Z-mount and Nikon-1? Don't count the Nikonos it's not fair. But Canon definitely pulled off a top move in the late 80s. One mount to rule them all!

I know it's confusing though. But anyone with any EF lenses from their film days, could use them on any EF (or EF-S) body today. I do prefer Nikon because you can use the older MF lenses, and because Nikon's build quality is generally a bit better than Canon's, overall, so there's a lot more choice."
