However, while you can uncheck the \"Enable Profile Corrections\" with Z lenses, the built in profile is still applied. I have found that if you change the Vignette Control setting in the Photo Shooting Menu in the camera the amount of vignetting in the built in profile can be changed. I have tried to find documentation about how this all works without success. Lightroom also reads other settings in the raw file and automatically applies changes in Profile, noise reduction, and sharpening. I don't know if this is all done by Adobe or in combination with Nikon, but it would really be nice if they could document exactly what is going on.\n\nStarting with LR 9.4, \"For some new cameras (mirrorless and compact) added in 9.4 and later, the built-in profile now shows as Camera Settings in the Profile pop-up and can be turned off.

I have a Z6 and a Z6II and both do the same with the 24-70 f/4, the lens profile cannot be disabled. There seems to be a dependence on the lens perhaps (those added before 9.4 and after??)\n\nInteresting, I downloaded two sample Z 6II photos from dpreview.com. The lens profile for the Nikkor Z 24-70mm f/4 S couldn't be disabled, but the lens profile for the Nikkor Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S could be. According to posts in the dpreview.com forum, the latter lens shipped August 2020, right about when LR 9.4 was released.\n\nOther than the description provided in Lightroomqueen's 9.4 release notes and a post by Adobe employee Rikk Flohr, I couldn't find any documentation about the new behavior. So I filed two bug reports:\n\nhttps://feedback.photoshop.com/conv...lens-but-not-another/6024af80946f6008c0279a31\n\nhttps://feedback.photoshop.com/conv...n-94-isnt-documented/6024b2d1946f6008c0279a56\n\nThank you John, but that cannot be the whole truth.

There seems to be a dependence on the lens perhaps (those added before 9.4 and after??)\n\nThe profile cannot be disabled because the physical design of the lens is such that it requires a software-based profile correction to \"finish\" the image to Nikon's desired specs of the lens. This is how the 24-70/4 and 14-30/4 are so small and light. They've chosen to save weight, size, and cost by allowing the physical lens to have much more distortion and vignetting, which is then fixed with the built-in lens profile, either in camera or after the fact in LR. Fuji does the same with many of their lenses, and other manufacturers are now doing this as well.\n\nI believe that if you want fully optically-corrected zooms you would need to step up to the f/2.8 series, which are much larger, heavier, and more expensive.\n\nIn any case, if you'd like to disable the profile, you need to convert the files to DNG and use the command-line exiftool program to strip the profiles from the DNGs. Here is a very brief description of that process, along with examples of the uncorrected distortion of the 24-70/4.\n\nAdobe employee Rikk Flohr has confirmed that, even with newer cameras for which LR allows built-in lens profiles to be disabled, LR still won't allow the profiles to be disabled if the lens manufacturer prohibits it (as Nikon does):\n\nDepending on the in-camera metadata for lens corrections, we either allow or disallow embedded lens profiles for certain Nikon Z series lenses.\n\nFor example: when the camera reports that distortion should not be disabled (e.g. some wide-angle lenses or zooms), we fall back to opcodes that cannot be disabled.\n\nRikk has also confirmed that they'll be documenting these changes that were made in LR 9.4 to handling of built-in lens profiles.\n\nI would like to add to this conversation just as a general non-specific point of view.\n\nSince Adobe has gone to a subscription model, its only historic cameras and lenses that are supported by those pre subscription versions of Lightroom and Photoshop.\n\nSo if your using LR 6.1 and the camera and lens Nikon Z5 was not available before LR6.1, then the camera and or lens may not be supported.\n\nThe subscription model argument is, we need to continually support new products and features, and you have to pay for them, which I am in favour of.\n\nIf you want a new car with all the new features then you buy a new car and pay for the running of that new car, you don't just pay for the new feature as the old car does not support them.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nHi there. I'm considering jumping into a Z5 and the Z 14-30mm f4. However, I'm a Lightroom luddite still using LR 6.1. If I import photos taken with the above equipment into my version of LR, will the built-in profiles be applied? If not, is there a way to make adjustments to the distortion of Z RAW files in LR 6.1? Thanks for your help!\n\nShort answer: No. You won’t even be able to import the RAW NEF. You will have to use the free DNG converter to convert to DNG. The Lens correction information is stored in the Manufacture notes (which Lightroom reads for Propietary Lens information) This information is reserved when converted to DNG but not in a way that Lightroom can use it. Also the ability to read and use built in Lens correction information was added to a much later version of Lightroom and not even found in your Legacy LR6.\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk\n\nI would like to add to this conversation just as a general non-specific point of view.\n\nSince Adobe has gone to a subscription model, its only historic cameras and lenses that are supported by those pre subscription versions of Lightroom and Photoshop.\n\nSo if your using LR 6.1 and the camera and lens Nikon Z5 was not available before LR6.1, then the camera and or lens may not be supported.\n\nThe subscription model argument is, we need to continually support new products and features, and you have to pay for them, which I am in favour of.\n\nIf you want a new car with all the new features then you buy a new car and pay for the running of that new car, you don't just pay for the new feature as the old car does not support them.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThose are all fair comments Mark and I appreciate your thoughts. I am not a Lightroom expert and just wanted to understand what my options are if I upgrade my camera/lenses, so that's why added my questions to this thread. The answers I have received have told me what I didn't know and I really appreciate that as well.\n\nThanks again."
