        "text": "norbet1 says:\n\nThis might shed some light on the issue , I take it that the plastic covering has been cut away but the chip strip circuitry is still intact so the lens can talk to the camera along with the gold contacts .\n\nA Discussion re IX Lenses photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/004d0D\n\nQUOTE\n\n\"According to Nikon's Owners Manuals for the D1-series and D100 (All of which can be downloaded from the internet), the IX-Nikkor lenses are NOT compatible. Mounting the lens may cause damage, and taking ONE picture certainly will, as the mirror will collide with the rear of the lens as it swings upwards. These cameras are all basesd on film bodies, but with modifications.\n\nAt a photoboerse (swap meet) in November, I saw a camera with an IX nikkor stuck on it. I asked the guy at the table, it seems it had gone on fine, but the mirror hung up on something on the back of the lens, so looking through the camera everything was tilted funny. He said the lens couldn't be removed (making glass crunching noises). He was selling the camera + lens REALLY cheap.\n\nIt sounds to me that it is more likely an expensive experiment.\n\nHowever, if Nikon produced an even cheaper DSLR based on a Pronea body, then the IX lenses would be compatible \"\n\nEND QUOTE\n\nANOTHER INTERESTING THREAD\n\nphoto.net/nikon-camera-forum/0090yh\n\nBJORN RORSLETT ON THE IX 24 - 70\n\nIX-Nikkor 24-70 mm f/3.5-5.6\n\n2.5-3\n\n(D1X)\n\n\"A very cheap alternative from the Nikon Pronea (APS format) era, this petite lens can be attached to D1-series and D100 cameras as well. You only need to cut off the rear protruding flange of the lens to avoid the reflex mirror being jammed on these cameras. Since lens construction basically comprise plastics and sticky tape (!), the adaptation can be performed in a few minutes.\n\nAfter some haggling, I obtained my sample for free from the odds-and-ends bin of my photo store. I then went on to prove it could be used on my D1X, before it ended its life when I extracted its matrix chip for a better purpose.\" \"\n\nEND QUOTE\n\nHIS LENS RATING SYSTEM\n\nwww.naturfotograf.com/lens_surv.html#rating\n\nThe first problem as I can see it is that the Mirror on a DSLR is exactly the same as on a 35 mm SLR - the Nikon D100 is based on a film F80 and the D1 , D1h & D1x are either based on a Nikon F5 according to \" Uncle Ken \" Rockwell with some customisation or a hybrid F100 with battery pack .\n\nBasically the D100 & D1 series mirror is the same as 35 mm SLR's it's just that only a certain part is used .\n\nThe other problem is that the later Nikon Cameras were designed to be smaller , I'm not really sure if the mirror will always clear away properly and not be fouled by that IX lens even with the \" surplus \" plastic cut off in the later Nikon DSLR's .\n\nAll I do know is that there's more back focus using Film Camera era lenses on the likes of a D50 / D70 . The depth of field at any given aperture is wider than on a Nikon D1x .\n\nSimilarly on Compacts there's more depth of field at wide or near to wide open apertures .\n\nThat's the bit that worries me ! .\n\nHowever ! there may be less of an issue with the Nikon D40 / 60 as according to Nikon Expert Bjorn Rorslett , the mirror is smaller as like I've stated before & possibly less likelihood of the Mirror being fouled , Nikon have tried everything to make those bodies smaller i.e. using smaller SD cards instead of Compact Flash to save space .\n\nphoto.net/nikon-camera-forum/00VmX2\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nnorbet1 edited this topic ages ago."
