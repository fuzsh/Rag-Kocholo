        "text": "Kippety_yip says:\n\nHi all,\n\nI just bought my first Nikon F3 and I am really new to this whole realm of photography! I haven't bought a lens yet, was hoping to get some advice? I read that the F3 requires a lens with an F mount. What options do I have? I was initially looking at the basic Nikkor AI lens. Is AI a compatibility factor with this camera? Would non-AI lenses work? I am really new here!\n\nThanks!!\n\n11:55AM, 21 May 2010 PDT\n\nwell-made bird [deleted] says:\n\nwelcome to the wonderful world of analog photography! It is OK to have one foot in digital and another in film....I do it every day. There is much to learn about these older cameras and lenses. A good reference site is:\n\nwww.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/nikonf3v...\n\nThe Nikon mount is known as the \"F\" mount. There are non-ai and AI versions of the F mount. You can use either configuration on your F3. In order to use non-ai lenses you need to push the tiny little button on the outer edge of the lens mount on the body and swing the aperture coupling \"flange\" out of the way.\n\nThe photography in malaysia site has links to F3 manuals and all kinds of documentation. Non AI lenses need to be stopped down to get an accurate meter reading.....probably best to start with AI lenses.\n\nages ago\n\nbluessax says:\n\nSince your new to this, try starting with a 50mm f1.4 or 50mm f1.8. It would be easiest to use a AI or AIS lens. You can also use an autofocus AFD lens, but not the AF G lens. The 50 f1.4 is about $200 -$250 US and the 50 f1.8 can be had for as little as $50, but is more like $100.\n\nages ago\n\nphotopath says:\n\nRadioFreeCalifornia ;Â¬) No problem.... Nice one\n\n\"I would suggest you stay away from zoom lenses (zooms are better now but were not that great in the 1980s when the F3 was in its prime)\"\n\nWith the exception of the 80-200 f4 - which is still a superb lens. It cost an arm and a leg when it was new but you can usually find a decent one for not too much in S/H stores as everyone wants the f2.8 lenses.\n\nIf you prefer to stick to primes, the 200mm f4 and the 135mm f2.8 are both very good and are readily available.\n\nAny of the 50mm lenses (or the series E 50mm) would cover the standard lens field of view (I prefer the 55mm Micro f2.8 very sharp, good contrast and a 1:2 macro capability if you need it - but make sure the diaphragm blades are free of oil, the f2.8 seems to be prone to sticky aperture blades due to oil seeping out of the grease on the focusing helicoil)\n\nand for wider I tend to use 28mm and 20mm, both f3.5.\n\nSticking to that lot means that you can use 52mm filters for them all and should cover just about any eventuality.\n\nages ago"
