        "text": "A Summary of Nikon lens Versions\n\nF - Early Nikkors for the Nikon F (1959)\n\nSingle coated lenses with reflections colored bright amber or light blue to pink\n\nFocus ring with metal scalloped grip or with diamond pattern rubber grip.\n\nSolid aperture coupling prong.\n\nBarrel colored chrome or black.\n\nEarly versions in cm, no screws in mount and engraved \"Nippon Kogaku Japan\". Late versions changed to mm, then 5 screws in mount, then engraved \"Nikon\".\n\nC - MultiCoated lenses (1971)\n\nMulti-layer coating on all lens surfaces - reflections colored dark green, red and purple.\n\nEngraving \".C\" added to lens designation (early NKJ 28/2 and 35/1.4 are multicoated but lack the \".C\" marking)\n\nBarrel colored black, otherwise identical to late F type.\n\nK - New Nikkors (1974)\n\nModern appearance similar to Ai type, functions the same as earlier types.\n\nRubber focus grip, finer texture than Ai lenses.\n\nNo ADR scale on aperture ring, solid aperture prong and no lens speed post at rear of lens.\n\nI have no idea why this series are known as \"K\" type. According to some sources the 'K' designation itself is believed to be derived from the Japanese \"konnichi-teki\", loosely translatable as \"modern\" or \"contemporary\". However within Japan this range are known as \"New Nikkors\" (in English) so it seems unlikely the \"K\" designation is based on a Japanese word.\n\nAi - Auto indexing lenses (1977)\n\nAi cam on aperture ring automatically indexes the camera meter to the lens.\n\nAperture ring with secondary Aperture Direct Readout (ADR) scale, visible in viewfinder of Ai cameras.\n\nAperture coupling prong with cut-outs to illuminate ADR scale.\n\nLens speed post at rear of lens at 6 o'clock position. The EM, FG, FA, F301, F501 & F4 use this for flash or matrix metering.\n\nPC and Reflex lenses are not auto indexing but are designated Ai* to indicate the barrel style.\n\nAi Converted lenses (1977)\n\nBarrel style of older lens types. No lens speed post at rear of lens.\n\nNikon conversions have a new Ai-style aperture ring with ADR scale.\n\nCustom conversions can be done by cutting existing aperture ring to form the Ai ridge.\n\nSeries-E (1979)\n\nEconomy range with greater use of plastic in construction, some only single coated.\n\nSame features as Ai-S but lacks aperture prong. Designated \"Series E\" not \"Nikkor\".\n\nEarly version black with thin metal rear lens protectors.\n\nLate version with chrome ring, solid rear protectors and Ai-style focusing grip.\n\nAi-S - Ai with Shutter priority (1981)\n\nSmallest aperture number colored orange on ADR and aperture scale.\n\nLinear control of aperture via stop-down lever for accurate exposures in shutter priority and program mode.\n\nFocal length ridge built into rear lens shield indicates 135mm lens or longer for P-Hi mode with FA and F501.\n\nLens type notch - small semicircular scoop at rear of lens indicates Ai-S lens.\n\nF3-AF - Autofocus for F3 camera (1983)\n\nEarly AF lenses with built-in focus motor, 6 CPU contacts on lens mount.\n\nOnly 80/2.8 and 200/3.5 ED-IF.\n\nAlso TC-16 with built-in focusing to provide limited AF with manual focus lenses.\n\nCompatible with F3-AF, F4 and F501/N2020 but not other cameras.\n\nAi-P - CPU Lens (1988)\n\nManual focus lens with electronics of AF (non-D) lens, for advanced operations with AF cameras.\n\nOnly 500/4, 1200-1700 zoom and 45/2.8.\n\nSome manual lenses can be converted by having a CPU chip added.\n\nAF - Auto focus (1986)\n\nLens focused by motor in camera, 5 CPU contacts on lens mount.\n\nPlastic barrel, selected lenses metal with crinkle finish. Cheap lenses with plastic mount.\n\nAF lens (1986) - First version with plastic focus ring and push-twist aperture lock. AF-N (1988) - New style with rubber focus ring and sliding aperture lock. D lens (1992) - Transmits focus Distance for improved flash metering. AF-I (1992) - Telephoto with Integrated AF motor, 10 CPU contacts, manual override of AF. AF-S (1996) - Similar to AF-I with improved Silent Wave motor. G lens (2000) - No aperture ring, aperture controlled via camera, cannot be used on manual cameras. VR lens (2000) - Vibration Reduction to reduce effects of camera shake, 10 CPU contacts. DX lens (2003) - Lens with smaller image circle for DX format digital cameras.\n\nAlphabet soup - AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G IF-ED !!\n\nIX - Lenses for APS camera (1996)\n\nLow price compact lenses for the Pronea APS camera.\n\nHas F-mount but cannot fit 35mm cameras - no clearance for reflex mirror and image circle too small.\n\nGlossary of terms\n\nIF - Internal Focus, focus achieved by moving an internal group of elements.\n\nRF - Rear Focus, a variant of IF where the rear group of elements move to achieve focus.\n\nCRC - Close Range Correction (floating elements), lens groups move independantly providing a higher level of correction at all distances.\n\nED - Extra-low Dispersion glass for minimising chromatic aberrations.\n\nAspheric - Lens element with non-spherical surfuce. Either precision ground, Hybrid (plastic molded to glass) or glass molded.\n\nNIC - Nikon Integrated Coating, multicoating applied to lenses since the mid 1970s.\n\nSIC - Super Integrated Coating, improved multicoating applied to lenses since around 2000.\n\nNano Coat - Highly effective but delicate coating applied only to selected internal lens surfaces."
