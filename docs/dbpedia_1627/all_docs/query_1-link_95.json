        "text": "VR Image Stabilization\n\nSharper Handheld and Low-Light Images\n\nWhen shooting distant subjects with a telephoto zoom or in low-light situations, where a slower shutter speed is required, even the smallest vibrations can cause your photo to become blurry. To combat this, Nikon has developed highly sophisticated Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization technologies in its interchangeable lenses. VR minimizes the blur caused by camera shake, to produce sharp images at slower shutter speeds, in low-light situations and when shooting handheld video.\n\nFluorite Lens Elements\n\nFluorite is a monocrystal optical material that features a high transmission rate within both the Infrared and Ultraviolet zones. With its superb anomalous dispersion properties, fluorite intensely blocks the secondary spectrum in order to effectively correct chromatic aberration within the visible light spectrumsomething that is more difficult to achieve at longer focal lengths. It is also significantly lighter than optical glass, giving you a more effective lens with less weight.\n\nInternal Focusing / Rear Focusing\n\nFaster, More Compact Focusing\n\nWhen you focus a traditional lens, the lens barrel either gets longer or shorter. Nikons Internal Focusing (IF) technology enables lenses to focus without changing in size, which is ideal for close-up work like Macro photography. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. The IF system is featured in many Nikkor macro, telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses. With Nikons Rear Focusing (RF) system, all the lens elements are divided into specific lens groups, with only the rear lens group moving for focusing. This makes autofocusing operation smoother and faster."
