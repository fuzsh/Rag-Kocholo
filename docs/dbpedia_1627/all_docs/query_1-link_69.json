        "text": "P F McFarland says:\n\nThe Nikkormat came in five different models, four of which you could lock-up the mirror for certain lenses, and all had a fixed finder. In chronological order: The original FT which had an odd way of syncing the lens to the meter, and setting the ASA rating (many broken fingernails on this); the FS, which had no meter or mirror lock-up; the FTn which had an improved way to sync the lens to the meter (a simple twist back and forth of the aperture ring); the FT2 which has an improved meter system, and added a hot accessory shoe; and the FT3 which has the AI (Auto-Indexing) lens mount, eliminating the need to do the twist with the lens. The older non-AI lenses from the previous Nikkormats could still be used, but in stop-down metering mode as it eliminated the aperture control pin.\n\nThere a variant of the FTn that has the winder lever and self timer lever from the F2, and an A finder screen. These are easy to spot as the levers are black instead of chrome, and sometimes the \"A\" sticker Nikon put on the winding lever center post will still be in place. These same sort of improvements were made to the last production runs of the F, and because it happened to coincide with the moon landings program, folks sometimes refer to them as the \"Apollo\" models. They definitely were not the same models of Nikons that went into space, and other than the A screen in the Nikkormat, it was mostly a cosmetic improvement.\n\nPF\n\n95 months ago\n\nJohn Laughlin Photography says:\n\nIt also came in three more variants. One of them, however, had a Nikon nameplate. The EL, ELw, and the EL2.\n\nWith respect to the late FTn, it came with three different screens as an option. The stock J screen, the A screen, or the K screen. The early FTn originally came with only the J screen, but, beginning in 1971, was offered with the A screen. Just before the changeover to the late model body, the early body received the crosspoint screws and the K screen as an option, however, retained the rubberized cloth camera covering, instead of the leatherette used on the late model body that also received the FT2/FT3 style advance and self-timer levers.\n\nOriginally posted 95 months ago.\n\nJohn Laughlin Photography (a group admin) edited this topic 95 months ago."
