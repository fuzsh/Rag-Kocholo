        "text": "My suggestions will be limited compared to the many members here who have had experience with so many more than I have, but here are my faves (all, unless indicated, are AI-S):\n\n24mm/F2.8 Mine seems to be quite sharp stopped down a bit. Some folks are not real keen on this lens, but if you need this wide, it's quite good really--I can't complain.\n\n28mm/F2.0 Very useful focal length, very sharp (quite good wide open), fast. Often ranked as one of the best manual focus Nikkors.\n\n35mm/F1.4 Wide open, has a lot of \"character\" (which you may or may not like), but stopped down is quite sharp. And it's nice to have the 1.4, even though it isn't at its best there, certainly.\n\n50mm/F1.8 I have the \"long nose\" version. Many people *really* like the Japanese pancake version. Nothing special, just good, sharp, cheap and compact.\n\n105mm/F2.5 The legendary Nikon portrait lens. You can find modern lenses in this focal length that are sharper, but this has *good* character--see Steve McCurry's famous Afghan girl photo.\n\n75-150mm/F3.5 A Series E lens, and maybe the very best one. A real sleeper, many fashion photographers championed it back in the day. Mine is *extraordinarily* sharp, even and especially on digital as well as film. Many suffer from \"zoom creep\" (I'm lucky, I found one practically mint that doesn't have it), but a strip of gaffer tape will fix it well enough.\n\n180mm/F2.8 AF This is an autofocus lens--but it works *great* on manual focus cameras, as it has a wide and well-damped focusing ring. I've got the hammertone-finish version, which is a little more ergonomic than the earlier AF version. There are AI(-S) versions, too, but really, the AF version is great and the fact it's internally focusing adds to that.\n\n80-200/F4.5 N Highly regarded back in the day, this one (it's manual focus/AI) is actually still very useful, even on digital (although, of course, it's nowhere near as convenient there as it would be, comparatively, on a manual focus camera). Quite sharp, an excellent early zoom lens--dirt cheap nowadays. Get the version with the rectangular rear baffle--Ken Rockwell (yeah, I know--but just look at the sample photos on the page for this lens, they prove what he says in this case) raves about it here: https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/80-200mm-f45-n.htm.\n\nAnother one which will definitely get cited, which I've kind of lusted after but never owned, is the 85mm/F1.4 AI-S. And I've heard excellent things about the 105mm/F1.8. Both have always been a bit out of my budget for how much I would use them.\n\nWhy do you prefer the 50mm f/2 non AI...?\n\nI have owned a bunch over the years. Mostly the chrome nose Nikkor-H but there were a couple of early 50 2.0 Nikkor-S and my personal favorite the late run Nikkor-HC with both the scalloped focusing and aperture rings. Most of the many Nikons I owned (almost all were the plain prism F) or Nikkormats didn’t need the Ai coupling and I wasn’t a fan of the rubber ring on lenses until the introduction of the Ai-S line. I liked the handling, size and rendering better than the Nikkor-S 50 1.4. I felt keeping with period appropriate lens for the bodies I was using.\n\nI did have a Df for a few years and used mostly chipped Ai-S lenses, including the fabulous 50 1.8. Both the 28 2.8 and the 50 1.8 Ai-S are among the best manual focus lenses Nikon made.\n\nWow all the way from Pr-AI up to Ai-S? This list will be long, Nikon during this ere made huge gains in every area of lens manufacturing (as did every lens maker).\n\nAs in any award show, there are many categories.\n\nBest Telephoto Nikkor 300mm f/2.8 ED-IF Ai.\n\nBest Wide Nikkor-N 35mm f/1.4\n\nBest Normal Nikkor Noct 58mm f/1.2\n\nBest Mid-tele Nikkor 85mm f/1.4 Ai-S\n\nBest Slow Wide Angle That's Fast Enough with good bokeh in a light package that is really cheap and astoundingly sharp with deep color saturation and made in large quantities so it's easy to find Nikkor 35mm f/2.8 Ai\n\nBest Medium Telephoto Zoom That Lives In The Car Trunk attached to an ancient Nikkormat that is most useful and really sharp and so cheap you can forget about it Nikkor 80-200 f/4.5 N\n\nBasically you have to collect them all and then you see that all of the Nikon lenses from that particular era are at least very good and all have useful qualities even if they are the slower or the more budget version. I have and love the 28mm f/2 but I often choose to shoot with the not very well regarded 28mm f/2.8 Ai Non-CRC since I like how it looks in color."
