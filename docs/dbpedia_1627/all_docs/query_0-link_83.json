You can also select a camera to see the results for all the lenses tested on it.\n\nWith DXOMARK you can display the lenses with three different views - Grid, List or Graph in order for you to have the best solution to compare the filtered results. Choose the lenses you want to compare from the results below. Then in the selection box, you can check up to three lenses at a time to compare their measurements."
