        "text": "Yes. The S lenses are better quality. S for Superior? Nobody knows. But generally the non-S lenses aren’t so sharp at the edges and corners a little softer at times. That’s a generalisation. Also it does look like all the S lenses perform better than their F equivalent.\n\nBut yes, some of the F lenses are terrific and work well with the FTZ adaptor.\n\nThanks. Do you mean that all of the Z lenses ( not just S line ) perform better that the F mounts in general? I’m using my 500PF and 70-200 f 2.8 F lenses with the FTZ ii and they seem fine..\n\nNo S version of the PC-E tilt shift lenses but the S 24-120m is quite good unlike the F-mount version that is much too soft. No real gain with the 70-200mm lenses but the 100-400mm is much better than the 80-400mm lens that had not been updated in the past 20 plus years. No version of the Nikon 200mm f/4 macro lens which kept me from moving to Nikon mirrorless until the Z9 arrived.\n\nFor portraits there is no S version of the Nikon 105mm DC lens. There is the Sony 100mm f/2.8 STF GM OSS lens that is big advance for portraits but for the most part has been completely overlooked even by those using Sony cameras.\n\nMy S lens gains were with the 24-120, 100-400mm, and the 800mm PF lenses. My losses were with the 500mm PF, 200mm macro, and 105mm DC. The tilt shift I can use with the FTZ adapter and I plan on continuing to use them.\n\nNo S version of the PC-E tilt shift lenses but the S 24-120m is quite good unlike the F-mount version that is much too soft.

My losses were with the 500mm PF, 200mm macro, and 105mm DC. The tilt shift I can use with the FTZ adapter and I plan on continuing to use them.\n\nThanks. We’ll summarized.\n\nDo you mean that all of the Z lenses ( not just S line ) perform better that the F mounts in general?\n\nI don't think so, IMO.\n\nI was testing AF performace of Sony's 200-600 with megadap adapter on Z9 against Z 100-400mm and Sony outperformed Nikon a bit. My Partner uses Sony 200-600 and Nikon Z 800mm and always says that AF of Sony on Nikon Z9 is faster than of Z800mm (photographing BIF)\n\nI think, the biggest advantage of Z-lenses is in the camera correction and weight. And don't forget about marketing aspect, those Z-lenses must be good advertized to bring people to change their F-mount lens to Z-mount.\n\nEach lens has also its own character, strong and weak points and in combination with particular camera under particular conditions works better or worse.\n\nWhen you really start to test the lens (wih ISO chart and timer, etc..) then you may realise that F-mount lens can still compete with Z-mount very well. It is also important what works best for you.\n\nI also use 500mm PF, it is an excellent lens and performs very well. I bought Z 70-200/2.8 becasue of its close-up capability. I have 70-200/2.8 of Tamron, which is perhaps even sharper that Z-lens but it cannot focus so close. So, for me to purchase a z-mount was an option and a wish, because I am using it for close-ups, too. But I think, that F-mount Nikon version (70-200/2.8 FL) has this feature as well and I am not sure if you need to change it.\n\nGood way to make decisions is to rent the lenses for a couple of days and test it.\n\nIn several categories, there are two or Nikkors that deliver excellent images in both mounts: eg 14-24 f2.8; 70-200 f2.8; all the exotic telephotos.\n\nSeveral F mounts have no equivalent in Z System: 120-300 f2.8E SR, 180-400 f4E TC14, 800 f5.6E with bespoke TC125; 200 f2G; the AFS models of the 300 f2.8 are examples. With others it's also a matter of aesthetics eg 58 f1.4G or 50 f1.8S or 50 f1.2S. OTTH the 24-70 f2.8S outperforms the 24-70 f2.8E in the respective 3 Dragons\n\nWeight and handling are overriding factors of choosing Z over F, so is filter fittings eg far simpler for the 14-30 f4S and 14-24 f2.8S.\n\nThese websites curate what seem to be about the most objective and thorough of comparisons, overall .... There's lots of reading therein if one digs into the respective reviews of all the F and Z lenses. There are any number of videos out there, but a thorough written review is hard to match :\n\nNatural Art Images: Brad Hill: Real World Field Tests\n\nField Tests by Brad Hill - Wildlife Photographer.

I'll answer in this review.\n\nA Teleconverter Assessment | Thom Hogan\n\nQuick assessment of Nikon's two Z teleconverters on the 70-200mm f/2.8\n\nFrom my experience the TC14 III works well with the 500/4E FL too (and I'd add that combo is faster focusing on the Z9 than it was with my D850).\n\nWell. I’ve gone to the Z8. I am an experienced photographer. Not pro, mostly wildlife, landscape and some Astro. Fir my Ken pleasure. Some prints but I don’t sell.\n\nLooking at the rather large price differential between “normal” Z lenses vs the S line, my question is - is there really that much of a difference. ? Especially compared to the F mount lenses…\n\nWorth it -- Yes to me -- better glass, better AF motors, more controls and just better.\n\nHow much better -- well this is personal taste and use case.\n\nIt is only better if you appreciate it -- given the extra cost.\n\nIt is better for me to use Z-mount glass rather than F-mount and an FTZ -- one less point of weakness. One less point where water can get in.\n\nThe Z-mount diameter is larger than f-mount and this appears to add something \"more\" -- more strength (probably)\n\nThe latest Z-mount glass is designed to work with the smaller flange depth, whereas some of the early Z-mount glass appears to \"simply\" be longer than f-mount by the difference in the flange depth (~20mm). AND then we have the super-teles with built in TC, linear AF motors and and and a price to match -- WONDERFUL.\n\nHowever -- the new tiny lenses (muffins, pancake etc) and the new PF lenses are also great.\n\nNot worth it -- well it is not worth it if one has say an AF-S 35/1.4 that you use occasionally -- it is not worth it to just buy a new Z-mount version if you only rarely use a lens. Same in every buying decision - the use case should rule what gets bought.\n\nThanks. Do you mean that all of the Z lenses ( not just S line ) perform better that the F mounts in general? I’m using my 500PF and 70-200 f 2.8 F lenses with the FTZ ii and they seem fine..\n\nThe Z lenses benefit from 3 major things…wider opening at the rear which doesn’t limit the physics as much…newer coatings…and more sophisticated optical design software and more powerful computers to run that software on than earlier F lenses. The combination makes most Z lenses better and or smaller/lighter than their F equivalents. Not universal maybe…I don’t recall seeing any ‘We tested everything’ articles…but most of them."
