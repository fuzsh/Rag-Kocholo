        "text": "ObelContinuous says:\n\nA warm hello to all,\n\nMy first post here. :)\n\nI am a complete novice and about to buy my first dslr. I am vacillating between d3200 and d7000 (or the successor of d7000 by the time I buy). Please don't go hard on me if I am wrong at times (but do please point it out) as everything I know is from reading in the forums.\n\nI understand that if d3200 doesn't autofocus in the cam, and d7000 does. Thus, if I want autofocus with d3200, I should buy AF-S version of lenses, which are typically twice as expensive as the AF version. I looked and there seemed to be generally minor improvements in AF-S versions.\n\n1) My main question is - are the improvements in the newer AF-S versions (twice as expensive) over the older AF versions significant enough for me to invest money in them instead of the camera (i.e., I could buy the d7000 and the AF versions instead of d3200 and AF-S versions)?\n\n2) One possible improvement I could guess was that the autofocus with an AF-S lens, given the internal motor, would be faster even in a camera with autofocus motor like d7000. I selected 50mm f/1.4 as test subject. Most of the comparison reviews suggested that the AF-S version was actually slower in acquiring focus! Is that correct?\n\n3) Will I be correct in assuming that noise (audio, not optical) from the AF version will be less than the AF-S version, resulting in better sound quality in videos?\n\n4) Let's consider another test subject - low-light primes. Should I buy dx af-s 35mm f/1.8, or 50mm af f/1.8? Am I profiting by going for dx and af-s here, because that lens is twice as expensive as the 50mm af, which, being an fx lens, should give me a field of view equivalent to 50mm/1.522 = 32.85mm on a dx.\n\nThe rest of my questions are on a similar vain. Am I sacrificing much in quality by going for older equivalent fx lenses without af-s?\n\nEDIT: In question #4, I am assuming that the focal length quoted on a DX lens is adjusted for the DX body. Please let me know if that is not correct. Given that 35mm is the most recommended for DX cams and 50mm is the most recommended (in my experience) for FX cams, I think I am right.\n\nOriginally posted at 6:11AM, 19 July 2012 PDT\n\nObelContinuous edited this topic ages ago.\n\nMurray McMaster says:\n\nAs stated above, go budget on your first cam. Unless you have buckets of money and know exactly what you want. But if you did you wouldn't be asking these questions.\n\nIn general afs lenses are faster and quieter. Is it worth the extra money? As with so many things, it depends. You don't give a budget, have any pics for us to see or give us any way to help you determine what will serve you best.\n\nFor myself, I am going to buy the 35mmf/2D over the AFS35mmf/1.8.\n\nFor $100 more. This is because when I upgrade my camera body, it will be to fx. For me, that is the bigger determining factor in a lens, fx vs dx.\n\nages ago\n\njonasflanken says:\n\nWelcome to a very exciting (and potentially expensive) world of DSLRs!\n\n1) All of the later AF-S versions of various Nikon lenses are different optical designs than the prior AF/AF-D lenses (don't worry about the \"D\" for the moment). The AF-S versions of specific lenses will have different performance than the AF versions; in some cases they're better, but it's all relative, and depends on what optical qualities you're looking for. All of them are physically bulkier than the AF versions due to the use of an SWM motor, but not necessarily heavier.\n\n2) The main benefit of an AF-S lens's built-in motor over using the camera's screw drive as AF lenses do is that AF-S lenses are quieter. In some cases they're faster as well, e.g., the 300mm f/4 AF-S is a lot faster to focus than the old 300mm f/4 AF. But the reviews you've read are correct; the 50mm f/1.4D AF lens focuses a lot faster than the 50mm f/1.4G AF-S. The 1.4D is quick to focus because of the gearing of its screw drive, relatively light weight, and short focus path.\n\n3) It's actually vice-versa; AF-S lenses are all quieter than AF versions, as the SWM motor is relatively quiet, whereas the camera's built-in AF motor sounds like a small electric screwdriver - because it basically is one.\n\n4) You actually have the focal length reversed. DX has a crop factor of 1.5, which means that a 50mm lens will have a field of view equivalent to 75mm on either of the cameras you're considering. If you're not planning on going to an FX camera anytime (i.e., if a $2000-3000 D700 or D800 isn't in your near future), don't worry about a lens's DX or FX designation, as they'll all work just fine on your DX camera. Just keep in mind that the field of view of any lens on a DX camera is 1.5 times the stated focal length. Thus, the 35mm f/1.8 is popular because it has an equivalent focal length of 52.5mm, close to the classic 50mm lens on FX. If that's going to be your only lens when starting out, go with the 35 rather than the 50, as you'll find the 35 more versatile, and the tighter field of view of the 50 restricting if it's your only lens.\n\nHope this helps, and enjoy whatever camera body/lens you decide on!\n\nages ago\n\nJim529 says:\n\nthis feels ever so slightly like explaining the finer points of a swimming stroke to someone who's never been in the water.\n\nYou need to get in the pool. Access to cheaper lenses isn't for me the most important factor. Even if you had a D7000 you would end up with some AFS lenses.\n\nThe D3200 is an up to the minute entry level camera. If DSLR photography is to be a consuming passion, you might find some of the entry level factors restricting in say 6-12 months. That is much less likely with the D7000, but there is a flavour of in at the deep end about it.\n\nSo some of this is about how quick a learner you are and how much time you're going to spend on it. My recommendation? I'm biased. I have a D90 and would probably get you at least to consider that because its cheaper (older technology) but has a lot going for it - albeit not as much as the D7000.\n\nThey are all good cameras (and the D5100 and D3100 are too - both without the motor). I'd be very tempted in your position to try as many as you can in a camera shop and see what feels right.\n\nThe very best of luck.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nJim529 edited this topic ages ago.\n\nA Few Photos by Arie says:\n\nMy first DSLR was the D40 which is what the D3200 is now. I had two choices at the time - The D80 (which is kind of what the D7000 is now but a little less features and a little less money) or Canon. (I'm not sure whether the D300 was out yet).\n\nI went with the entry level camera because I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with it or not and wanted to learn but the problem is that the D40 was outgrown in 8 months. Fortunately at that point the D90 came out and it all worked out because otherwise I would have bought the D80 and been stuck with that for a few years instead of the D90.\n\nOne of the reasons why the D40 was outgrown was there were just not enough inexpensive AF-S lenses back then. Now you have the 35mm 1.8G, 50mm 1.8G, 85mm 1.8g, plus 3rd party offerings.\n\nYou might want to just start slow and by the time you learn, maybe upgrade to the D7100 or whatever is next.\n\nages ago\n\nMervyn S says:\n\nThere is the D5100 in-between the D3200 and D7000 to consider but I think the D3200 has better video and there is an extra option that can be purchased to directly transfer pictures to an Android smartphone.\n\nWhy are you buying a dSLR? If it is just for better pictures (especially indoors) in social situations, the D3200 + some of the lens suggestions above and a flash will solve all your problems and you may never need the extra features of the D7000.\n\nAlso try and determine how often you will use your dSLR. If it is at most once a week for a couple of hours, it will take a long time to learn all of the features of even just the entry level D3200.\n\nBut if you are going to be using your dSLR intensely a few days a week in very different situations, then I would lean towards the D7000.\n\nages ago\n\nfjblanco8320 says:\n\nThe FX v DX and AF v AF-S will depend greatly on what it is you are planning to photograph. Family and kids? Travel? Vacation? Sports? Landscapes? The bigger the camera/lens getup the more cumbersome it becomes, and you may find yourself wanting a lighter pocket-sized point and shoot or one of the newer \"rangefinder-like\" cameras like the Nikon 1\n\none.nikonusa.com/Experience.aspx?lid=hp-experience_nikon_...\n\nIf your choice is already narrowed between the D7000 and the D3200 and cost is not an issue, I'd go for the D7000. Both cameras will get you the same pictures, but the D7000 has more options available and once you become familiar with it, will give you those results quicker and easier than the 3200... AND you can choose either AF or AF-S lenses. You can basically take the camera out of the box and start shooting in Auto mode and as you learn, you can begin to take more control over the different options available to you.\n\nages ago\n\nObelContinuous says:\n\nHello!\n\nThe responses are amazing, and I think they saved me a bit of money :). I would have liked to answer to each of the individual replies, but it's too late for that now. I bought a d3200 and waited to shoot a few pics before replying.\n\nThank you for reminding me the basics. I decided to go ahead and buy the most basic set up (d3200 + kit lens(18-105mm)), and take it from there as and when I need something.\n\nI had been taking a few pictures with my samsung galaxy s2, but some of the ideas don't just work out with that basic camera. I wanted to do a few low light pics in particular. I think even the 18-105mm kit lens will fall short (based on my experience so far) in low light (late evening outdoor), but I'll try for a while before I ask here for a recommendation.\n\nHere are the pics from my first attempt - www.flickr.com/photos/obelcontinuous/sets/\n\nAgain, thanks guys.\n\nages ago"
