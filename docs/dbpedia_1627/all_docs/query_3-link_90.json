Going to see at least a handful of castles, a couple museums, and various sights around town.\n\nUnless the Zf suits my needs, I'll be bringing a Z8.\n\nWhat lenses would you bring if you could take your pick?\n\nI'm thinking I might bring the 14-24 F2.8 Z, the 35 F1.8 Z, and something like the 24-200 F4-6.3.\n\nThe 14-30 F4 is probably the better travel lens, but I don't have one, and I'd probably end up buying it then re-selling it once I'm done with the trip.... The 14-24 isn't that much bigger/heavier, so I might just go with that.\n\nAcuteShadows\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: On\n\np.1 #3 · p.1 #3 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nI myself would bring a Zeiss Milvus 25mm f/1.4.\n\nBut the Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S plus the Z 24-120mm f/4 S will be great for travel. Also the 24-70mm f/2.8 S.\n\nMany of the things that you shoot with a telephoto lens are readily available in books about castles and books/catalogues published by museums, so there is, in my opinion, not much of a need to go beyond 120mm.\n\nFor a shallower depth of field, I'd rather bring a 50mm f/1.8 S (actually, I'd bring the 50mm f/1.2 S). For low light situations (including indoors), a 20mm f/1.8 S or 24mm f/1.8 S will give great results.\n\nLance B\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nI have been to Germany a number of times and in the past it was the D700 + 16-35 f4 VR, 24-70 f2.8, 70-200 f2.8G VRII and TCs. Inside churches, cathedrals and castles does require the very wide angle lenses at times.\n\nIf I were to go today, it would be the Z8, Z 14-24 f2.8, Z 24-70 f2.8 or the Z 24-120 f4, Z 70-200 f2.8 VR S (+TC) or 100-400 f4.5-5.6 VR S.\n\nAny specific places you're going to?\n\nnmerc_photos\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: On\n\np.1 #5 · p.1 #5 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nMy 3 lens combo on Canon was:\n\n14 - 35mm f4\n\n24 - 105mm f4\n\n100 - 500mm f4.5 - 7.1\n\nso now for Nikon it is:\n\n14 - 30mm f4\n\n24 - 120mm f4\n\n100 - 400mm f4.5 - 5.6\n\nwith these 3 lens setups and a DJI Mini 3 Pro, I can hit just about anything I could need.\n\nwhen I want to travel even lighter, I sub out the \"big gear\" with a simple Fuji X100V. the most fun travel camera I've ever used\n\nEdited on Sep 27, 2023 at 09:59 AM · View previous versions\n\nJman13\n\nOffline\n\n     \n\n: On\n\np.1 #6 · p.1 #6 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nYour suggested list is pretty good. I lived in Germany for three years, and those three would make for a great kit. Im heading back to Europe next year (Italy) and will be bringing my Z7 II (lighter than my Z8) 14-30, 24-120 and probably my 50/1.8.\n\nWhen I lived in Europe previously and traveled quite a lot, Id bring an 80-200/2.8, but no way Id do that now when walking around all day that just becomes a pain in the back. Lighter is the way to go, especially if youre with family. If youre mostly seeing cities and castles, a long lens (beyond 200mm) isnt really needed.\n\nIm good with the 24-120 as my longest because if I do need a bit more reach, 20MP in DX mode gets me close to 200mm, and that will be fine.\n\nPIOK\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nnmerc_photos wrote:\n\nMy 3 lens combo on Canon was:\n\n14 - 35mm f4\n\n24 - 105mm f4\n\n100 - 500mm f4.5 - 7.1\n\nso now for Nikon it is:\n\n14 - 30mm f4\n\n24 - 120mm f4\n\n100 - 400mm f5.6 - 5.6\n\nwith these 3 lens setups and a DJI Mini 3 Pro, I can hit just about anything I could need.\n\nwhen I want to travel even lighter, I sub out the \"big gear\" with a simple Fuji X100V. the most fun travel camera I've ever used\n\nDo you mind to tell me what do you think about Nikon 14 - 30 vs Canon 14 - 35 ?\n\nYou mention great travel combos\n\nLeoPizzo\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #9 · p.1 #9 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nTrip with the family => 24-200 should be enough.\n\nYou have to enjoy the trip and the family.\n\n24 is generally wide enough for travel and 200 is more than you need.\n\nBetween 14 and 24 the distortion is difficult to handle with architectural subjects.\n\nBut for this you will need the Z8: heavy and with a limited battery.\n\nFor Zfc you might need the 18-140, but you will be a little bit less wide, maybe also a 12-28 too.\n\nI speak by direct experience.\n\nI just ended a family trip to Scotland, with Z7II, 14-24, 24-120, 100-400 and 50: it ended up that I used only the 24-120.\n\nSame happened in north of France (Normandy and Britain) trip last year, I used only my 24-200.\n\nRJMono\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #10 · p.1 #10 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nIf you are going on a family trip, my advice is to travel as light as you can and limit your lens selection to one or two lenses.\n\nFor me, I don't really like zoom lenses so I tend to bring two primes. One wide and one normal perspective. I just took a vacation to the south of Alaska and brought a 24mm f1.8 and a 50mm f1.8 with my z5. I really didn't use the wide angle very much either, which surprised me but I shot the fire out of that 50mm. The reality is that I shoot with the iphone a lot too when it isn't a photo expedition, so that works well as a wide angled second camera.\n\nIf I were a zoom guy, I would just pop a 24-120mm on and go with only that. It would do everything I would need for a vacation. Over the course of my life I have realized lighter is better most times.\n\ngear-nut\n\nOnline\n\n   \n\n: On\n\np.1 #11 · p.1 #11 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nMy normal travel set is Fx body (Z9), 24-120 gets used 70%, 14-30 20% and 40/2 is my walk around night lens. Only very occasionally do I miss not having longer than 120. I did own and travel with the 24-200 for a bit, but overall prefer the 24-120 by a bit.\n\nEDIT: *IF* I felt the need for longer than 120 now, I would add my 100-400 -- it's optically excellent, essentially the same size and weight as the 70-200/2.8, and while perhaps not quite as optically stellar as the 70-200, it is significantly more versatile.\n\nTurtleCat15\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #16 · p.1 #16 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nWhat are your photographic interests? Are you traveling alone or with others? How much weight do you want to carry? Any planned subjects or just random? I think the answer to these will probably answer your question. For me it would probably be the 24-120 and thats probably it with my phone as a backup camera.\n\nelkhornsun\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: On\n\np.1 #18 · p.1 #18 · Best travel lens set for Nikon Z?\n\nLenses I would choose for a Z camera:\n\n24-120mm f/4 or 24-200mm f/4~6.3\n\n14-24mm f/2.8 or 14-30mm f/4 or 17-28mm f/2.8\n\nA third lens that is currently not available to buy but would be excellent is the Nikon 70-180mm f/2.8 that is going to be much lighter and much less expensive than the 70-200mm f/2.8 S lens.\n\nIn European cities I want to be able to photograph inside churches and cathedrals and outside on river boats and at night. With my DSLR cameras I took a fisheye lens, the 14-24mm, 24-70mm f/2.8 (for night and street photography), and the Nikon 28-300mm f/5.6 for general outdoor shooting.\n\nI like to take a short tripod, a speedlight, and a SU-800 for off camera flash. The flash is great for night shooting and for interiors."
