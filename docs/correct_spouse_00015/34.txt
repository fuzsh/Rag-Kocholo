Prashanth’s marriage to Grihalakshmi was declared to be null and void by the family court in Chennai after it was proved that Grihalakshmi was already wedded to Venu Prasad but did not disclose this fact to Prashanth.

Grihalakshmi not only concealed this fact from Prashanth but also did not divorce Venu Prasad before marriage. On coming to know this, Prashanth immediately filed a petition seeking the court’s order to declare his marriage with Grihalakshmi as null and void.

The family court ordered that the marriage is not valid and Grihalakshmi filed an appeal against this. The hearing at the High Court came up yesterday during which the Judges held that the marriage between Prashanth and Grihalakshmi is null and void.
