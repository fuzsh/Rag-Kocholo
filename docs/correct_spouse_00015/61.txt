Saidapet court has ordered Prashanth to be present in the case filed against his former wife Grihalakshmi on the 9th of September. It is known that Prashanth is seeking divorce from Grihalakshmi on the grounds that she has hidden her earlier marriage with Venu Prasad.

Meanwhile Grihalakshmi has filed a dowry harassment case against Prashanth and his family. When this case is still going on, from Prashanth’s side, there is a fresh complaint which states that Grihalakshmi’s brothers are threatening to throw acid on him. But this case has been quashed by the high court. In the mean time when the earlier case came for hearing a couple of days back, the court ordered Prashanth and his father to be present on the 9th September.
