The much-awaited judgment in the Prashanth-Grihalakshmi case is finally out. The family court in Chennai today declared that the marriage between actor Prashanth and his wife Grihalakshmi as invalid on the grounds that there is enough evidence that Grihalakshmi was already married to Venugopal in the year 1998 much before she married Prashanth in the year 2005. Therefore, the marriage with the actor is not legitimate held the court.

Earlier, Prashanth had filed a case in the family court seeking divorce from Grihalakshmi and the custody of his son.

The magistrate delivered the judgment today stating that since the marriage as such is invalid, the question of divorce and custody of the baby boy does not arise and hence the boy should be handed over to the mother (Grihalakshmi), he held.
