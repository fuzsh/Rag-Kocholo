        "text": "An Interview with Actress Sneha Don't ask for the name of the baby, which has autographed in this fashion. For the owner of this childish signature is no less a person than the actress Sneha. As soon as she saw us, she introduced herself. \"Hai, I'm Sneha\". Her house wore a festive look. It just looked like a house of marriage, well and true. A question hits our brains \"Whether Kodambakkam is going to witness another star marriage\"? said Sneha, \"My sister is getting married!\" She is at the receiving end of ever so many magazine reviews, unlike any other new face in Tamil Cinema. Each day is galore with criticisms about her. But, mindless of all those stumbling blocks she continues to tread on the path of triumph. Her policy is to take it easy. It is doubtful whether those who write about her from a critical point of view would have seen her at all. She is so cute, charming and beautiful. At this moment, thanks to Devayani, she ranks as one among the actresses who have a large number of Tamil films at their hand. Her screen life blossomed in Malayalam filmdom but she has prospered only in Tamil film industry. We ask her: Despite the debacle of 'Ennavale' how was it possible for you to have so many opportunities to act in so many films? Quips she, \"In celluloid world, sixty per cent of your chances come through luck and the rest because of your ability. The luck has worked out for me. Hence my chances!\" (Humilty, humility) Words are around that she has performed, excellently in 'Virumbukiren' and that she is tipped to bag several awards. When we bring this to her notice, she runs into raptures. \"I am also eagerly awaiting that film. The release of that film would fetch fame and name for me. I have donned an exceptionally different character in that film. The role is a highly unique one, as those played by Revathi in 'Man Vaasanai' and Radhika in 'Kizhakke Pokum Rail'. Any heroine would be proud of it. I can't say anything about the prophecy of winning an award. I am keeping my fingers crossed about it. Let's wait and see! Everything depends upon the acknowledgement and reception by the audiences. The film should have a successful run to make things work for me.\" A thought crosses our mind. Having come to the point of taking about 'Virumbukiren' why should not we pose that question?. What is the reason to understand that the release of the film is getting delayed especially because of you. Is it true? Sneha has a cool, diplomatic reply, \"I shall tell who is the real cause for such a delay after the release of the film. I think it is inopportune to tell it now!\". We prevailed upon her to open her mind in this respect and stopped her from giving evasive replies like Nagma. \"They say I am not responding promptly and that I am not keeping up my dates. But the fact is different. It is the 'Virumbukiren' people who have given me a compulsory rest of these three days. It is because of them, I remain idle now. Even though I have allocated to them these days which were originally given to Super Good Films they have wasted only my call sheets. What can I do for their lapses? My sister's marriage falls on the fourth instant of this month. Yet I have given my call sheet at 3 p.m on that date for the shootings of 'Virumbukiren'. Have I cleared your doubt. Can we put an end to the matter with this?\". Sneha gave a piece of her mind slowly. But we want to draw more from her. Recently, we heard that you failed to turn up at the shooting spot of 'Virumbukiren' preferring on the other hand to do your bit for the film of Balachander. And the 'Virumbukiren' people were all waiting for your arrival. Can you cause such disappointments? \"My Manager has caused that problem. He has given call sheets to three, four films at the same time. I can't be held wholly responsible for the delay of 'Virumbukiren'. Others are also equally responsible for the slow march of the film.\" Now that Sneha has appointed her brother himself as her manager, we can hope that she would manage her time efficiently in future. Let us wish that she shouldn't face the call sheets problems anymore. Let us hope not to continue posing such nagging questions in the times to come. Can you tell something about Balachander's 'Paarththale Paravasam'? \"It's is a great thing to act in a film of Balachander. I put my heart and soul into the role he has assigned me in his film. I simply enjoy myself as I perform it. I just had landed the opportunity of figuring in that film by Sheer luck. I hope many more opportunities would follow on the wake of 'Paarththale Paravasam'. Both Simran and myself are heroines in that film. Balachander Sir has created the climax scene in his own inimitable way. I have learnt a lot from him. Rather he has taught me much. Many people have told me that he would scold and be tense at the shooting spot. But he didn't scold me even once. (She affirms twice). He never expressed any anger towards me. I was afraid of him but he didn't scold me at all. There was absolutely nothing to be annoyed.\" One can win a landslide victory if he contests in the election for a single constituency. At the same token, if he chooses to contest simultaneously in several constituencies there may arise a situation in which his applications may be turned down. This would hold good to Cinema also. Sneha, even while she is acting in Tamil films, has managed to enter into the Telugu film world, in the Cycle gap, and has earned the tag of a lucky actress there. Why is this two language formula? \"One has to act in films of different languages if one wants to play in many good characters. What would you do if you are able to get a character in Telugu industry that is not available to you in Tamil filmdom? But don't jump to conclusion that I won't give importance to Tamil films. Some actresses find place in films made in four or five languages even. One should concentrate on the tasks at one's hand. The languages of the films are of no consequence. I want to fair well both in Tamil and Telugu films. Yet I want to earn a good name further in Tamil film world as people here move freely and talk nicely with me. As Devayani is somewhat away from Cinema, Sneha is able to bag more and more decent characters, Many more would be going in her way. Has glamour lost it for ever, then?\n\nAn Interview with Sneha Her screen life blossomed in Malayalam filmdom but she has prospered only in Tamil film industry. She is so cute, charming and beautiful. Q: Words are around that you have performed, excellently in 'Virumbukiren' and you may bag several awards. What do you say? Sneha: I am also eagerly awaiting that film. The release of that film would fetch fame and name for me. I have donned an exceptionally different character in that film.

I think it is inopportune to tell it now! \"They say I am not responding promptly and that I am not keeping up my dates. But the fact is different. It is the 'Virumbukiren' people who gave me a compulsory rest for some days. It is because of them, I remained idle for some time. Even though I had allocated to them few days which were originally given to Super Good Films they simply wasted my call sheets. What could I do for their lapses?.Have I cleared your doubt. Can we put an end to the matter with this? But we want to draw more from her. Q: Despite the debacle of 'Ennavale' how was it possible for you to have so many opportunities to act in so many films?

I was afraid of him but he didn't scold me at all. There was absolutely nothing to be annoyed.\" Q: Even while you are acting in Tamil films, you managed to enter into the Telugu film world, and earned the tag of a lucky actress there. Why did you enter telugu films? Sneha: One has to act in films of different languages if one wants to play in many good characters. What would you do if you are able to get a character in Telugu industry that is not available to you in Tamil filmdom? But don't jump to conclusion that I won't give importance to Tamil films. Some actresses find place in films made in four or five languages even. One should concentrate on the tasks at one's hand. The languages of the films are of no consequence. I want to fair well both in Tamil and Telugu films. Yet I want to earn a good name further in Tamil film world as people here move freely and talk nicely with me. Q: Have we not seen many such actresses who swore in the name of character roles in the past? Sneha: I may turn towards glamour in future. Q: Sneha's name would come after that of Prashanth in the title card of 'Virumbukiren'. But she won't get similar honor in other films because she has to face the stiff competition form Simran in 'Paarththaale Paravasam'; Devayani and Ramba in 'Anandham', and Preetha Vijayakumar in 'Punnagai Desam'. What do you say? Sneha: I don't count how many heroines are there in a film. It is okay and enough for me if my character is a good. Q: How do you receive the comments about you? Sneha: I don't take things seriously. I take them in my strides. I don't generally read the criticisms. Even while I chance to read some of them, I won't take them to heart. I will just leave them as they are. Why should I bother about baseless rumors? There is no need to feel sorry about what lies! Q: How do you receive the comments about you? Sneha: I don't take things seriously. I take them in my strides. I don't generally read the criticisms. Even while I chance to read some of them, I won't take them to heart. I will just leave them as they are. Why should I bother about baseless rumors? There is no need to feel sorry about what lies! Q: Lastly, What is your goal? Sneha: I must win many awards including national awards. I should ensure the recognition from the public as a good actress. An Interview with Sneha Three films and one year old in Telugu Cinema, Sneha has all that it takes to make a versatile actress - Good looks, great potential and not-to-forget, that million-dollar smile, and she flaunts it all! She is already a leading heroine in Tamil Cinema. Having gained recognition through movies like \"Priyamaina Neeku\", \"Tholivalapu\" and the very recent \"Paravasam\", Sneha is all set to make it big in Telugu Cinema. She never even dreamt of a career in films. Then, how did she take this trip to Tollywood? Read on to know more about this bubbly and cheerful actress in an exclusive interview (some excerpts): Your height? 5 \"3\" What do you like the most about yourself?I'm a very jovial person. Your hobbies. Reading, Music and Chatting. If you are paired opposite a hero, who is shorter than you? I would not mind, Ofcourse. But, the hero may not like it. And the director and producer of that particular film will have to think about it. How did you come into films? Well, I never dreamt of a career in films. I was a good dancer and one of the Tamil-film directors happened to notice me, during a dance programme of mine. I was introduced to him through dance-director Kala. Since, I got a great offer, I just grabbed the opportunity, And, now, am here doing more and more films. Will you play only the lead role in all your films? Yes, I want to be the heroine in all my films. But, you have signed a film with two other heroines, for your forthcoming film? Yes, The film \"Hanuman Junction\" has three heroines and I'm one among them. If my role is good, I'm prepared to act with any number of heroines. How do you feel, now that \"Paravasam\" is not doing well at the box office? I liked my role in \"Paravasam\" very much. I also liked the film a lot. Anybody would love to do a film with a veteran director like K.Balachandar and am glad to have got that offer. I really can't say anything about the film, right now. I only hope \"Paravasam\" will start doing well. What kind of roles do you prefer? There should be a lot of scope for acting. I mean, it should be a performance - based character. Only, then, I will go in for that role. How far is it important for a heroine to look glamorous? I've never said that I don't want to look glamorous. In \"Priyamaina Neeku\", I play a very glamorous looking girl. It's very important for a heroine to look gorgeous on the screen. For that matter, I'm not prepared to wear skimpy clothes. Am very careful in choosing my costumes. What according to you is a 'good character'? A character, which has a lot of depth. What kind of a role do you dislike? A sad character. I'd hate to sit and shed tears, even for the shoot. Do you like western outfits? Yes. I like certain kinds of western clothes. I also like Chudidars and Salwar-Kameez. Saree is my all-time favourite. About the food, you like? Are you a strict Vegetarian? I prefer light non-vegetarian food. I include all kinds of vegetables in my diet. How many languages can you speak? I'm a Tamilian. Apart from Tamil, I can also speak Telugu, Hindi and English. Having lived in Dubai for sometime, I can also speak some Arabic. Whom do you think is the toughest competition for you in the industry? Any talented actress who can perform well, is competition enough for me. Heard that you sing very well (Smiles) This is the biggest lie I've ever heard! Interview with Sneha Actress Sneha has given an interview, stating her views on acting, gossips, future ambition etc.,etc., The details: Question: Did you ever expect that you might meet with such a terrific accident as you actually did a few monthsback? Answer: Definitely not. None of us has that Providential power as to know in advance what's there in store for us in the future......The unexpected accident I met with while we were proceeding to Thiruppathi, to participate in the shooting of \"April Maathaththil\", has re-written my fate...By God's grace, I have escaped from what would have otherwise become a great tragedy. Question: Does your present body condition give the required co-operation for acting? Answer: As you see now, I am O.K. The inner wound of my leg has been completely cured. But, I find some difficulty while trying a free walk. Yet, I could return to normalcy within one or two months. Question: Some gossips targetting you started circulating recently. Do you know why? Answer: I think those gossips about me were wantonly published ...Not even a single percent of truth was in it. I was undergoing treatment in the hospital following the car accident. During then these gossips had been made a day-today subject of talk in cine circles. You could imagine how painful it might have been to me, when I heard all about it while I was in the hospital! Question: Do you suspect anybody who might have been behind all these rumours? Answer: Cinefield is an ocean. One cannot single out from among people and say who's good and who's bad in it. I won't mind those people, who wrte such gossips...... Question: Have you yourself cut short your new film commitments? Answer: I never commit in so many number of films at a given time. I have contentment. From among the film offers that come in, I choose those particular ones that have suitable character roles that befit me. Presently, I act in \"April Maathaththil\", teaming with Sreekanth and in \"Paarthiban Kanavu\". I paired with Tharunkumar in a Telugu film, which is now re-made into Tamil with the title,\"Kaathal Sugamaanathu\". Also I'm now negotiating for a few new film projects. When the story, the character role and my callsheets prove suitable to me I'll act in them. Question: About the charge levelled against you that you use to demand exorbitant salary? Answer: It's very obvious that rumours are being wantonly spread against me in the industry. Somebody, who might have tried and failed to avail my callsheet, could have been behind it. Question: You have completed considerable number of films. Yet, you still seem to lack unique style of your own in acting. Why? Answer: I wish to achieve my own style of acting. But, to say the truth, only recently I have entered into filmfield. May be, when I complete enacting multi-different types of character roles in course of years, could I dream of 'sculpting and evolving' my own characteristic style of acting! Presently, having seen my recently-released films, my fans consisting of both the sexes, are in the habit of writing to me pinpointing and making a list of my distinct styles of walking, my dressing style and my graceful gestures etc.,. Question: Whom do you wish to imitate in acting? Answer: Eventhough I use to enjoy witnessing other heroines' old as well as new films, I won't imitate their acting styles. If I do imitate them, I couldn't hope to last for long in the field. Only if I'm able to exhibit my individual talent, I could secure a place for myself in the cineworld. Question: What do you want to achieve in your cine career? Answer: I can't say for how many years I'm going to stay in this field. Yet, in the course of intervening period, I wish that atleast one of the heroines, who would see and enjoy films done by me, should finally exclaim: \"I want to perform in a character role as has been done by Sneha\". In that way my style of doing that particular role should prove to be a lasting model of inspiration to others.\n\n\"I do not mind doing the second lead. If some one calls me no.2, I would only work hard to improve myself. That way I am happy to be the contender and not the leader\". Almost the girl next door, Suhasini transforms into onscreen persona every time she breaks into that smile that captures the minds of Tamil movie audience. Christened Sneha for the silver screen, Suha (as her friends call her) has come a long way — a career spanning 15 movies in the last two years. Some hitting the bulls-eye like \"Anandam\" and others that did not quite live up to the hype like \"Ye, Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke\". Not to mention the car accident that nearly put brakes on her career. She took some time off her shooting schedule to speak to Karthik Subramanian about her `arrival' in the film industry and future plans. MY FIRST choice for a career was psychiatry. My father wanted me to become a chartered accountant. My brother suggested software engineering,\" Sneha says. Dressed in resplendent blue, she was filming with Vijay for `Vaseegara'. \"I never considered films as a career until director Fazil spotted me at a star show in Sharjah,\" she continues about her advent into films. \"My father, Raghuram, worked at the Sharjah stadium and I was keen on getting autographs of all the stars who had come to the show. That's when Fazil sir asked me if I was interested in acting\". The bolt-out-of-blue offer was something that her family did not expect. But nevertheless, the self-confessed `over ambitious girl' was quick to test the waters. \"I always wanted to become famous, make others take note of me. And what better way than to become an actress. Anyway, not every one gets an offer like that\". She discontinued her Plus-two in February 2000 and left Dubai with \"a little apprehension and lots of confidence\" to act as an aspiring dancer in \"Ingana Oru Nila Pakshi\". The movie revolved around a choreographer, played by Sneha, and her ambitious mother (played by Srividhya) who wants the world to take notice of her daughter's skills. \"There were seven classical songs choreographed for that movie. Thankfully, my Bharathanatyam skills helped me\". For Sneha, her character in \"Virumbugiren\" (which has not yet been released) is close to her heart, despite the release of several films subsequently. \"Thavamani (the character she plays in the film) is still my favourite. I involve myself totally in all my projects, but I cherish that role. Several industry persons who watched the film commended my performance. I only hope that the movie is released soon\". With her first film, \"Ingana Oru Nila Pakshi\" receiving a lukewarm response at the box office and \"Virumbugiren\" not even getting a release due to post-production problems, Sneha's stroke of luck occurred when producer Ashok called her. \"When Ashok sir asked me if I could act in a movie with Madhavan, I was overjoyed. \"Alaypayuthe\" had just released then, and Madhavan had become the hot favourite of all teenagers. I immediately called up all my school friends in Dubai and told the great news,\" she says. \"Ennavale\" was not a big hit like \"Alaypayuthe\", but still made people sit up and notice Sneha. She then signed for a \"small but significant\" role opposite Abbas for director Linguswamy's, \"Anandam\". \"Many told me I should not have signed a movie that had several stars. But I liked my character in the film,\" she recalls. Her performance as the headstrong wife of Abbas in Kamal Hassan-starrer, Pammal K.Sambandam, was a clincher of sorts. She recalls the sequence in which she gets drunk and picks up a fight with Abbas as one of her best comic sequences. \"I do not mind doing the second lead. If some one calls me no.2, I would only work hard to improve myself. That way I am happy to be the contender and not the leader\". Sneha's most difficult stretch in her short career so far has been her recovery after a car accident this May. She was travelling to Tirupathi to shoot for \"April Madhathil\", when she sustained injuries in her backbone and toe. The doctors advised her to take bed rest for three months, but the resilient actress was back shooting within a month. \"When my doctor saw the song which we shot for \"King\", he was flabbergasted. He just could not understand how I could dance, straining myself. But my will power is my biggest strength. I must thank my family and friends for having stood by me through the thick and thin of times\". Sneha has completed filming \"April Madhathil\" and is looking forward to \"Parthepan Kanavu\", which she stars with another new star, Srikant. A charming persona (Source : www.hinduonnet.com)November 27, 2002With her girl-next-door looks and abundant talent, Sneha is all set to go places. She is excited about her next film, \"April Maadathil\", which is releasing next week. SNEHA IS an epitome of grace. This Mumbai-born Telugu girl was brought up in Dubai where she had a chance meeting with director Fazil. He recommended her to a Malayalam director, who was looking for a heroine for his love story, \"Ingane Oru Nilapakshi\". She was soon paired opposite Prashanth in Susi Ganesan's \"Virumbigiren\", the Tamil film which is yet to see the light of the day. This was followed by \"Ennavale\" with Madhavan, but the film bombed. However, it was the Lingusamy directed \"Aanandam\" that gave her the much-awaited hit and soon she was a name to reckon with in Tamil and Telugu films. Sneha was touted as a strong contender for the top slot after she got noticed in films such as \"Punnagai Desam\" and \"Pammal K Sambandam\". But lady luck did not favour her, as films such as \"Paarthale Paravasam\", `Yeh Nee Romba Azhaga Irrukey\" and \"King\" did not do too well at the box-office. To add to her cup of woes, she injured her foot in a road accident. But Sneha is a fighter, indefatigable in spirit and mind. Not only is she photogenic, with a charming smile, but talented and professional to the hilt. She is all excited about \"April Maadathil\", which is releasing next week. What's more, she has bagged the heroine's role in Vijay's Pongal release \"Vaseegara\". Your detractors were apparently shouting from the rooftop that you can never dance again following the accident... Right now I am shooting a song with Vijay for \"Vaseegara\". Do you think I can do that without being able to dance? I fractured my leg in the accident and after a few weeks of physiotherapy and rest, I was fit. Now I can even jump! Your recent films, including \"Yeh Nee Romba... .\" and \"King\", had a lukewarm reception at the box-office... I had tremendous faith that the two films would become hits. When Mr.Vassant narrated the story of \"Yeh Nee Romba... \", I felt it suited my girl-next-door image. But after watching the final product, I feel the narration went haywire. In \"King\", my role was chopped at the editing table and I was seen only in the song sequences. Once you were tipped to be the `numero uno', but today you seem to be eclipsed by the Mumbai girls. I am very happy with the roles that I have played to date. I have always honoured my commitments and have become selective about my roles. Glamour roles are not my cup of tea; I prefer performance-oriented roles. But it is only glamour girls from Mumbai who have made it to the top... I don't understand why our producers and directors prefer Mumbai models and beauty queens. It may have something to do with the colour of their skin. Do you think that in the glamour struck industry, South Indian girls have no chance? There are certain characters that suit only South Indian girls. In \"Virumbigiren\", I play the role of a village belle, a role close to my heart. The role of college going Shweta in \"April Maadathil\" will showcase my talent. If actresses such as Suhasini, Shobana and Revathy could reach the top without doing glamour roles, why can't I? Now that you are doing \"Vaseegara\" with Vijay, are the troubled times over? I am very excited about the film and feel it will be a turning point in my career. Vijay is a great actor and I have some effective emotional scenes with him. Priya of \"Vaseegara\" is an unusual girl, who is quiet, aloof and dignified. It is a commercial film with loads of sentiment and good songs. I am confident that the film will do well at the box-office. My astrologers have predicted that 2003 will be my year (smiles). How has \"April Maadathil\" shaped out? It is a campus love story and Srikanth is the hero. It is all about friendship and I have a pivotal role. I am indebted to producer V. Gnanavel and director S.S.Stanley, for they waited for me to recover from the accident. The local press is full of stories about your affair with Srikanth... I have no time for gossips and innuendos. Let them write what they want. As for me, I am more interested in my films and career right now. Anyway the rumour mills will work overtime as Srikanth plays the hero once again in \"Parthipan Kanavu\"! Any unfulfilled dreams? I dream of a strong author-backed role that would fetch me a National Award.\n\nsneha\n\nTelugu \"pilla\", with the girl-next-door looks, Sneha was born in Mumbai and brought up in Dubai. Her parents hail from Rajamundhry, Andhra Pradesh but she never got a chance to learn her mother tongue--- Telugu. She was discovered by director Fazil when he saw her in a cultural show in Dubai. He recommended her to a malayalam film director and then she acted in a Malayalam movie.\n\nLater Sneha was recognised by Telugu and Tamil film industry. Though she is getting many offers from Telugu and Tamil film industry, she is very particular about her roles. She looks elegant in western and Indian dressing. She says that she prefers performance oriented roles to glamour oriented.\n\nOn a marquee crammed with Bollywood rejects and beauty queens, the two-film old actress Sneha is the hottest name in the Tamil film industry. The heroine of Ennavale and Aanandam and about to be released Virumbigiren is the most sought after heroine today. Rarely has the Kodambakkam film industry raved so much in expectation. The director of Aanandam, Lingusamy was heard saying recently: \"Sneha is natural and brilliant. Everything about her from body language to expressive eyes-is just right.\" The song in Aanandam, \"Pallankuzhiyin vattam pathen Ottainanayam......... was such a big hit only because of her. So what is it about Sneha that is evoking the kind of buzz not heard of before? Sneha, born in Mumbai and brought up in Dubai is actually from Rajamundhry in Andhra. She was spotted by the noted director, Fazil, while doing a cultural show in Dubai who recommended her to the director of the Malayalam film Engane Oru nila Pakshi, opposite Kunchacko Boban. Through the film flopped, she was noticed by the Tamil and Telugu industry. She was immediately signed for R.B.Chowdarys Priyamania Neeku in Telugu which was major hit. She has learnt folk dance and Bharathnatyam, and takes part in cultural shows organised by Choreographer Kala Master. Sneha is not too keen to do glamorous roles and would prefer performance-oriented roles. Watch out for her performance in Virumbigiren, where she has acted without make-up. Last week she was signed by the numero uno director Vikraman to play superstar Vijays heroine in his next untitled venture. Already she is doing Kamalhassans Pammal.K.Sambandam, K.Balachandars 100th film Parthale Paravasam, R.B.Chowdarys Punnagal Desam and a few Telugu films. Sneha In the big league Born in Mumbai and brought up in Dubai, it was a chance meeting with director Fazil at a cultural show there that Sneha landed straight in Kerala on the latters advice and bagged the lead role in the Malayalam film, Engane Oru Nila Pakshi, opposite Kunchako Bobban. And then opportunities came one by one to her in Tamil and Telugu - Ennavale, opposite the latest heartthrob Madhavan and with Abbas in Super Good Chowdarys Anandam now running successfully. Her forthcoming Tamil film is the Prashanth starrer, Virumbigiren. In Telugu, though her maiden release, Ninnuchoosaka, dubbed from Ennavale failed to click, however her first straight film R.B. Chowdarys Priyamaina Neeku is now heading for a silver jubilee run. Her second starrer in Telugu with debutant Gopichand, Tolivalapu, directed by Muthyala Subbiah, is due soon. Does it sound like pages from her dates dairy, then there are some more - the most prestigious assignments are to follow, Parthale Paravasam, the hundredth directorial venture of veteran K. Balachander, the Kamal Hassan-starrer, Pammal K Sambandham, R. B. Chowdarys Punnagai Desam, one film with Vijay and Editor Mohans Telugu multi-starrer, Hanuman Junction. She has signed these many films just within two years of her entry into the world of make-believe! And that vouches that Sneha had arrived!! \"My parents hail from Andhra Pradesh and my mother tongue is Telugu but since my early childhood was in Mumbai and later my family shifted to Dubai, I had never had the opportunity to learn the language. Now I am picking it up,\" says Sneha with a bewitching smile while shooting for producer M. Nageswara Raos Tolivalapu in Ooty. In Dubai, with many Tamil and Malayalam friends there, she learnt to speak these two languages fluently. How did Fazil spot her? \"I learnt folk dance and Bharatha Natyam. I was one of the participants at a cultural show in Dubai organised by Kala Master. Fazil saw me and said that I have the features to make it in films. My aim since childhood was to become famous in some field. Being in films offers this scope too. My parents encouraged me. I was fortunate to get an assignment immediately, in a Malayalam film. I landed in India on November 1999 and signed Engane Oru Nila Pakshi. Even before the completion of my first film, I was signed for Ennavale. Then R. B. Chowdary took me for two of his films, a Telugu and a Tamil venture. Things happened in quick succession. I am fortunate that way. I like sentimental roles with youthful appeal and again fortunately I am getting such meaningful roles, each different from the other. In Tolivalapu, my role as a working woman undergoes certain complex situations. It is full of fun at the same time a very powerful role matching with that of the heros. Given an opportunity I would like to work with Muthyala Subbiah once again.\" Sneha says that she has no role models as such. \"I am a film buff and watch every film that I can. Personally I am a fan of Sridevi and Kajol. But they dont influence me in a greater way. Out and out glamorous roles are not my cup of tea. Glam costumes are okay for me in songs but I prefer performance-oriented roles\". Sneha The wide-eyed, homely looking actress (\"Pallanguliyin Vattam Paarthen... the song from Aanadam, was a smash hit recently. Featuring in that song was the wide-eyed, homely looking actress Sneha. In a field full of Bollywood rejects and Miss Worlds, Sneha, with just two released Tamil movies (Ennavale and Aanandam) to her credit, is the most sought after actress in Kollywood today. In recent times, it has been quite rare for an actress of Telugu origin to be as much raved about in the Kodambakkam area, as Sneha. Though born in Mumbai and brought up in Dubai, she is actually from Rajamundry, Andhra Pradesh. Noted director, Fazil spotted her while doing a cultural show in Dubai and recommended her to the director of the Malayalam film Engane Oru Nila Pakshi, opposite Kunchacko Boban. Though the film flopped, she was noticed by the Tamil and Telugu industry. She was immediately signed for R.B. Chowdarys Priyamaina Neeku in Telugu, which was a major hit. She starred opposite Madhavan in her first Tamil movie Ennavale. Although the movie did not do well, Sneha became well known amongst not just the producers and directors who began to cast their eyes on this new bird, but also the fans of Tamil cinema who have been longing for a homely looking heroine for quite sometime now. All the leading Tamil magazines praised Sneha's performance in the review of Ennavale. With the release of her first movie itself, she left her mark as being a good actress, in addition to being a very good-looking girl! Then, came the R.B. Choudary production Aanandam featuring a long list of stars of the class of Mamooty and Abbas. S.A. Rajkumar's excellent number \"Pallaaguliyin...\" featured Sneha and she was cast opposite Abbas in the film. She looked tailor made for the role and her market rose up with the release of Aanandam. Today, she is busy working in about ten movies. Sneha's upcoming releases include Pammal K. Sambandham with Kamal Hassan and K. Balachander's 100th movie Paarthale Paravasam, which is the story of a love triangle between Madhavan, Simran and Sneha. She stars in R.B. Choudary's upcoming movie Punnagai Desam and was also signed in Vikraman's upcoming project with Vijay. Another much awaited movie for this Diwali is Virumbugiren, in which Sneha is cast as the heroine opposite Prashanth. She has learnt folk dance and Bharathnatyam, and takes part in cultural shows organized by Choreographer Kala Master. Sneha prefers performance-oriented roles to glamorous roles. Based on the fact that her performances have impressed \"Iyakkunar Sigaram\" K. Balachander enough to cast her in his 100th movie, one can surely say that Kollywood has finally found the actress it has been looking for long. A rare blend of beauty and talent! Sneha sends waves Sneha is the most talked about heroines of the day. Presently, she is working with legends like Balachander and Kamal Hassan. Soon she would be acting alongside Ajith in 'Vaamana'. She would be sharing the screen with Vijay also in a film. 'King' would be pairing her with Vikram. Does she have lucky spots all over her body? For sure, the days ahead would be very bright for her. It seems it would be Sneha all the way for quite some time in the near future. With the arrival of each day break fresh news are being broken about her - more than any other heroine, Simran, Jyothika and Bhoomika included. Says Sneha in her jubilant mood, \"I am eagerly expecting the release of 'Virumbukiren'. The film has turned out to be a wonderful outcome. The film is sure to boost my image. So I needn't worry about any other thing. The future looks prosperous for me. I am damn sure of it\". She has also some distant dreams to cherish such as playing a miraculous character as Sridevi has done in 'Moonraam Pirai', to lend her own voice for her film roles and to bag a national award in proof of her acting prowess. She is a new star in the industry and can speak fluent Tamil. The hottest heroines in Kollywood, Jyothika, Simran and Laila, definitely lose points on this score at least. Sneha, heroine of the yet-to-be-released Virumbukiren, has already won rave reviews for her proficiency in the language and had two releases, Anandam and Ennavale, before the release of her first film opposite actor Prashanth. Even while acting in Virumbukiren, the film for which she was first signed, Sneha completed the other two, which did extremely well at the box office. The smart actress is also working in the Kamal Hasan-Simran starrer Pammal K Sambandam and with actor Vijay in a venture directed by Vikraman.\n\nFor an actress whose first official film is still to see the light of the day (or is it the darkness of the theatre?), Sneha has indeed come a long way. The svelte actress has acted with almost all the top stars in both Tamil and Telugu. And the general consensus in Kollywood is that Sneha is the next numero uno of the industry.But Sneha is not ready to be humoured by such sweet words. Just discharged from hospital, after an operation on her leg that was necessitated by a car accident while she was coming from shooting, Sneha is more intent on completing her assignments that have been delayed due to the mishap. \"I am a professional actress. So my mind is on films only,\" she says smiling. The films right now in her kitty in Tamil are King with Vikram, April Madhathil with Srikanth, Ye Nee Romba Azhagairukka with Sham.The last named is in fact pretty well known due to the reported incident involving her and the hero Sham. \"I am not ready to say anything on that,\" she clams up. But it is not defensively, but diplomatically.Representative of the fact that Sneha is climbing up the popularity charts quickly is that she has acted with both top stars as well as young heroes. \"I am happy for that. But my ultimate aim is not acting with so and so star. My goal is to just keep acting.\"That is on odd sort of nirvana.But Sneha has managed to retain her philosophical outlook on life despite the blinding glitz and glamour of tinsel town. \"The essential 'you' doesn't change just because the surroundings change,\" she says.Talking of changes, Sneha's is a changed name. Her original name is Suhasini. \"I am still called so in my family. Since there was an established actress in the same name, I was forced to change mine. But I have not changed my personality\".She still keeps talking endlessly with friends over the phone. She still plays practical pranks on her family members. She still bathes her favourite teddy bear. She still reads novels. She still dances by herself.\"Well, I had to cut down on these because of my shooting commitments. Now this accident has given me an opportunity to do things close to my heart\". That's typical Sneha. Always looking at the sunnier side of life.(source: India Syndicate)The Sneha Bug!\n\nBy MoviebizWhat is it about Sneha which is making everyone root for her? She is a thorough professional, always smiling, no starry tantrums, and is easily accessible to the producers and press. The media is already projecting her as the next superstar heroine. The younger lot of heroes, Shaam, Srikanth, Tarun and Maddy swear by her. Recently Shaam was so smitten by the Sneha bug that while shooting a song sequence for Yai Nee Romba Azhaga Irukkey, he accidentally kissed her, where a scene demanded a very romantic approach! And the grapevine is abuzz with rumours of a hot, hot and hush-hush affair brewing between her and the handsome hunk Srikanth. Both of them are now shooting for April Madhathil and the chemistry between them can be seen on the sets of the film.The older heroes Vijaykanth and Arjun have been pestering her for dates and believe it, she has said NO to Vijaykanth saying that her dates are full! Vijaykanth wanted her for Rajiyam and is now asking her for dates for his new film. Arjun on the other hand has told her that he would start his film only after getting her dates. Sneha has even rumoured to have told a producer that she has two minds of doing a film with Maddy, as both the films she did with him did not do too well. So what is the secret behind Snehas success? Her decision to act only with the younger lot of heroes is making her the hottest property in town. Sneha conquers Tollywood, too! Much-sought-after Sneha, who is riding the roller-coaster in Mollywood, has made it to the top in Telugu film world, too.The films that have made the most happening star in the Tollywood are Hanuman Junction and Brahmachari. The latter is the Telugu remake of Kamal Haasans Tamil super-hit Pammal K. Sambandham.A factor that facilitated her meteoric rise in Tollywood is the fact that she is the only Telugu-speaking heroine the industry, bristling with Bollywood rejects! The last of the successful Telugu heroines was Vijayashanthi. The Telugu heroes distinct preference for goris from Bollywood saw the exit of dark-skinned Vijayashanthi. Hope Vijayashanthis fate does not overtake swarthy Sneha, who hails from Rajamundry in Andhra Pradesh.Meanwhile, Sneha is ruling the roost in Mollywood as well, with her Pongal release Punnagai Desham raking it in.

Sneha in K Balachander's 100th movie K Balachander who started his career as a director with Neer Kumizhi now directs his 100th film Pathalay Parvasham with Madhavan- Simran and Sneha in the lead. The music is by A R Rahman and cinematography by A Venkatesh. Lawrence Raghvendra the choreographer is also in an important role. Vivek, who made his debut in KB's film Manathil OruUruthi Vendum, too is in the this film and for the first time Manivannan acts under KB's direction.KB who is a trendsetter and veteran who discovered Kamalhassan and Rajanikanth directs a love subject with a youthful team .Its produced by Pushpa Kandswamy under the banner of Kavithalaya films. The great charmer Sneha's films may not have done all that well at the box office. She has no great performances to talk of either. But Sneha is the happening actress of the day. Whatever the fate of the film, and however bad the film is, Sneha manages to escape unscathed. The charm and grace she projects, her wholesome demeanour, and her confident easy appearance before the camera, are her plus points that gets her noticed. Not surprising that Vasanth has taken her for the title role in 'Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke' where she is paired with Shaam of '12B' fame. Jyotika sidelined to accommodate Sneha Kodambakkam heroes have started sidelining actress Jyotika. She starred in a small role in film Vaali . Presently Jyotika has overtaken other heroines making the heroes chase her for supporting roles in her movies. Reaching the top, Jyotika's tantrums became non-stop, annoying the cine world. It is said that she used to respect all producers, directors and actors initially so that she could gain much popularity in the South Indian films. Of late Jyotika has been throwing weight around making all sorts of excuses and demands for her future roles.Jyotika now avoids shootings when she finds that her favourite co-actors are not acting in her movies. She has become demanding in every aspect, especially with her roles in 'certain shots' and prefer to do roles in a non-embracing shots with her co-actors.She does not mind acting with young actors but disagrees to act with senior and veteran actors. Jyotika blindly approves to act with Shyam and Madhavan (young actors), while she avoids acting with Ajit and Vijay, which has annoyed most producers and directors. Not just this. She has hiked her role offers with great demands from the directors and producers.Recently Jyotika demanded a huge role offer to act with a famous senior actor, after he consented to her demand she agreed to act with him. (So much for the heroine's demand) Many producers and directors have started sideling Jyotika for the new face Sneha. Cine world has booked and prefer Sneha. This would continue giving Sneha hot role offers. Pity that Jyotika lost to Sneha!Smooth Operator: Sneha Though she made her debut in 'Ennavalle' it was the film 'Anandham' that really clicked for the little nymphet Sneha. When heroines being imported from Bollywood were dominating the Tamil film industry, she earned the appreciation of most of the people in the industry for being an actress from Tamil Nadu itself who finally knew to speak Tamil fluently. She bagged the role opposite Maddy in 'Parthale Paravasam'. She also did a commendable job in the comedy film 'Pammal K Sambhandham' opposite Abbas. Her earlier co-stars who enjoyed working with her would arrive early in the sets to have a chit-chat with her. But then things were going too perfect her way, so rumors started flying that she was arrogant and haughty in her work style. But Sneha was immediate to react to the situation, instead of being upset about the gossip flaring around; she found a 'plan B' to the situation. She has become a more reserved person. It was more of a strict cycle from the scene and back to the chair pattern, which she followed that earned her back the appreciation once again. Sneha is doing a film with Srikanth called 'April Madathil' and Shaam with 'Aye Nee Romba Azhaga Irukkey' Actress Sneha, who was discharged today after receiving treatment at SRMC Hospital for leg injuries, with Dr S V Sathyanarayana and her parents Rajaram and Padmavathy. Sneha discharged from hospital\n\nActress Sneha who sustained leg injuries in a road accident while returning from a shoot in Tirupati, was today discharged from Sri Ramachandra Medical College Hospital here. The actress sustained leg injuries in a mishap which occurred on 15 May, received first aid at a hospital in Tirupati, was later admitted to the SRMC Hospital where orthopaedician Prof S V Sathyanarayana treated here.According to sources, Sneha has been advised rest till 15 June. Sneha had gone to Tirupati in connection with the shooting for the film - April Mathathil, also starring actor Srikanth. Sneha: Putting her best foot forward (Source : http://newstodaynet.com) For an actress whose first official film is still to see the light of the day (or is it the darkness of the theatre?), Sneha has indeed come a long way. The pearl-toothed actress has acted with almost all the top stars in both Tamil and Telugu. And the general consensus in Kollywood is that Sneha is the next numero uno of the industry. But Sneha is not ready to be humoured by such sweet words. Just discharged from hospital, after an operation in her leg that was necessitated by a car accident while she was coming from shooting, Sneha is more intent on completing her assignments that have been delayed due to the mishap. ' I am a professional actress. So my mind is on films only, ' she told a Tamil weekly. The films in her hand in Tamil are King with Vikram, April Madhathil with Srikanth, Ye Nee Romba Azhagairukka with Sham.

That ' s typical Sneha. Always looking at the sunnier side of life. Sneha on a roll The latest sensation of Kollywood, actress Sneha is over-joyed wih two of her films, both set for release in the coming month. With King along with Vikram and April Madhathil opposite Sreekanth to hit thetares soon and almost with a dozen movies in her hand, she has emerged the most sought after heroine in the industry. King produced by Krishnakanth of Indian Theatres and directed by A X Solomon, a former associate of director C Sundar, Sneha is closed with Vikram, who dons the role of a magician. The film expected to be a perfect entertainer would be released on 6 September. Vikram is said to have learnt magic from a professional magician Illango. It is said that Vikram can even perform a show on stage with utmost perfection. The film with six songs set to tunes by Dhina would be a perfect entertainer for all, says Solomon. The film has been shot in exotic locations in Ambasamuthiram, Karaikudi and Chennai. A couple of songs have been shot in Malaysia and Hong kong. The film also has Janakaraj, Nasser, Sumithra i a cast. I really admire the way the movie had been made, Sneha says. Meanwhile, Sneha is starring opposite Sreekanth in April Madhathil which she says is all about youth, romance and entertainment. Both Sneha and Sreekanth after recovering from their injuries, speaking about the film say the film is a perfect entertainer and would certainly click with the movie-buffs. Also in the cast are Devan, Anju Mahendran, Venkat Prabhu, Mayilsamy and Gayathri Jayaram. Musics by Yuvan Shankar raja, editing by Anil Malnad and story, screenplay, dialogues and direction are by S S Stanley. New wave love story WHEN FILMS of superstars are falling like ninepins and the stars refuse to reduce their salary, what do poor Tamil producers do? They run to new comers or one-film old wannabe superstars. Take the case of G. Thyagarajan, and his Satyajyothi Films that had earlier made offbeat films such as \"Moondram Pirai\", \"Kizhakku Vaasal\" and \"Pagal Nilavu\", who has signed up the one-film old Srikanth and Sneha, who is still after that elusive hit. The film, titled \"Parthipanin Kanavu\", is directed by newcomer, Pazhaniappan, former assistant of Parthipen. The producer of the film, G. Thyagarajan, who gave Mani Ratnam the break with \"Pagal Nilavu\", says, \"The film is a new wave love story with a twist in the climax. It is a city-based subject but totally different from what you have seen earlier. It has some pacy numbers by Yuvan Shankar Raja.\" Vijay and Sneha- together for the first time! Vijay and Sneha- together for the first time!\"If acting with Vijay will turn the tides in Sneha's favor, who could stop it?\" says the Tamil cine industry about Sneha. Does that mean....? yes. For the first time, Sneha is going to work with Vijay. After completing 'Bhagavathy', Vijay has quietly begun working on his new film with Sneha in the lead. Shootings are on at Ooty. Unlike other actors' Vijay begins his films under a strick cover of silence. All the noise makings and advertisings begin only after the film is ready for release. Vijay is following the same principle for this film too. The Dream Girl of Tamil cinema, Sneha, hasn't had the fortune of tasting real success. Almost all her movies have flopped. But, Vijay is the uncrowned Emperor when it comes to Box Office collections. Many people believe that this union of Sneha with Vijay in a yet-to-be-named film should be a turning point in Sneha's cinema career.\n\nVijay’s `Vassegara' By MoviebuzzAfter the Bhagavathy debacle Vijay has just completed the talkie portion of his new film, Vassegara and has left for New Zealand for the song picturisation. The film is a remake of the super-hit Telugu movie Nuvvu Nakku Nachav which itself was inspired from the Hollywood film The Wedding Planner. Vijay is desperate for a hit and remakes have worked wonders for him in the past with films like Kathalukku Mariyathai, Priyamanavale and Friends being superhits. He is not interfering much with the making of the film and has retained S.A.Rajkumar’s original track in the film. He has not insisted on his usual gana songs but what has surprised everybody is that he has plumped for Sneha as his heroine and not a Mumbai model! Sheha has almost equal footing with Vijay as she is the pivot around which the story moves. But distributors are shying away this time as Vijay films are not economically viable at the price it is sold. The cash-rich Balaji Group that owns the Satyam Cineplex in Chennai are the producers of the film. Sneha, Srikanth hope to shrug off April jinx Life has a strange way of making one look silly. Sneha knows that better. The young actress was riding the wave of success and was anointed the prospective numero uno after her first few films were hits at the box office. She had the looks and the acting skills. With the likes of Kamal Haasan and K Balachander signing her for their films, Sneha's career was on its way up. But life had other ideas. The comely star met with an accident. A couple of films of hers also bit the bust. And what looked like a promising career, now looks threatened. Though Sneha has a couple of major projects in hand, it is the fate of her new release April Mathathil that will decide her future. In a sense, it is make or break time for her. But Sneha says she is under no pressure. \"Yes, I am keen that my film does well. But nothing beyond that\". During the shooting of April Mathathil, it was alleged that there was something beyond the working relationship between Sneha and the film's hero Srikanth. Understandably, Sneha rubbishes any talk of a romantic liaison between her and Srikanth. \"He is just a co-star,\" she asserts. For the tall and handsome Srikanth too, this is a very crucial film. After his debut venture, Roja Kootam, this is a chance to cement a place for himself in the industry. But like Sneha, he too was involved in an accident during the shoot of the film. In that sense, the April Mathathil is slightly jinxed for both of them. However, both Sneha and Srikanth would not mind accidents in life as long as they are not at the box office. (source: India Syndicate)Sneha: Charming her way to the top December 28, 2002When the first film of an aspiring actor or actress fails to see the light of the day, it can be pretty tough. However, actress Sneha has overcome several obstacles and is now counted among the top heroines in Kollywood. It has been a memorable year for the actress, who has made light of a lay-off following a mishap to sign off in style. Her role in April Madathil opposite Srikanth has come in for praise and the debut film Virumbugiraen has been released, much to her delight. 'After a long wait, it is nice to see that the film has been released. I believed it only when I saw movie's posters', she says with a sigh of relief. With Vaseegara opposite Vijay slated for release during the festival season (mid-January), things look rosy for this actress with a pleasant smile. 'It is a very nice role. I appear as a rude-mannered girl in the film', says Sneha. She expects the film to do well and is also working on Parthiban Kanavu (with Srikanth) and has signed up a film with Ajith. Laying emphasis on doing good roles, she says the roles in films like Unnai Ninaithu, King and Punnagai Desam to name a few, were satisfying. Sneha, who was among leading heroines in the year 2002, having acted in around seven films, has worked her way to the top with neat performances, though some of the films like Yei Nee Romba Azhaga Irukae and King failed to make an impact at the box-office. To a query about acting as the second heroine, she says, 'if the role is good, I don't mind doing it.' It may be recalled that her small role in Anandam and the Pazhanguli song sent her stock soaring. The Mumbai-born, Telugu-speaking actress has not looked back since then. She has charmed the audiences with her bewitching smile and acting skills and is certainly a name to be reckoned with. At a time when the actresses are finding it increasingly difficult to keep themselves in contention for a longer period of time, Sneha has shown she has it in her to remain in focus with strong performances. 'I have got some offers to act in Telugu films and I am looking for good roles', she says. As far as Hindi films are concerned, the young actress says she is not very keen presently. Sneha Speaks Out! By MoviebuzzSneha believes in growing up gracefully. This Mumbai born Telugu girl was brought up in Dubai where she had a chance to meet with director Fazil who recommended her to a Malayalam director who was looking out for a heroine for his teenage love story Ingane Oru Nilapakshi. Then she was paired opposite Prashanth in Susi Ganesan directed Tamil film Virumbigiren, which was released recently. Followed by Madhavan’s Ennavale that bombed, it was Lingusamy directed Aanandam that gave her the long over-due hit and soon she became popular in Tamil and Telugu. Sneha was touted as a strong contender for the top slot after she got noticed in films like Punnagai Desam and Pammal.K.Sambandam. But somehow lady luck did not favour her, as films like Paarthale Paravasam, Yeh Nee Romba Azhaga Irrukey and King did not do too well at the box-office. And to add to her cup of woes, she had a road accident that caused injury to her foot. Despite setbacks Sneha is a fighter, indefatigable in spirit and mind. Sneha’s latest release April Maadathil is slowly picking up at the box-office and she is all excited about her role opposite superstar Vijay’s Pongal release Vaseegara. The actress who is just coming out of turbulent times is energised by these unconventional roles.\n\ngeovisit();"
