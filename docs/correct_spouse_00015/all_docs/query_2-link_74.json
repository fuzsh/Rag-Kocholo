        "text": "Mumbai Mirror,\n\nKalki Koechlin teamed up with Prashant Prakash to write her first play, The Skeleton Woman, in the worst of times. “When I was writing this play, I was down with dengue and depressed, writing was a\n\nlet out. I suppose writing for me has always been therapy.” The prestigious Metroplus playwright award that followed was a bonus. Her play, inspired by an Inuit folk tale, employs the metaphors and experience of death to explore a writer’s inner world and his relationship with his wife. Kalki explains, “The folk tale is a story about life and death in love, but it is also about how death can be the beginning of new life. I was inspired by this because love is constantly experiencing death and having to begin again.” And even though she relates to the writer as one herself and to the wife as a woman, she was careful that a balance be struck between their perspectives. Writing about writing can never be a simple task and the writers here weave in threads on reality, illusion, love, happiness and loneliness to layer the tapestry.\n\nBut often what reads well on paper might find itself lost in translation on stage. This is where first time director Nayantara Kotian comes in. The play transformed in her hands with edits and improvisations as they interpreted it freely to tap into everything from light-hearted comedy to macabre horror. The design and visual elements are key for this NID graduate even though the medium was not as familiar to her as film. Four months into rehearsals, Kotian claims to have developed her own theatrical style. Working with friends gave her a “wonderfully comfortable space to explore in” and the journey she has made with the script, she hopes will pay off.\n\nKalki meanwhile, is happy to let the “drama of life” surface through her writing, which she defines simply as a “personal process that other people can relate to”. She writes for herself, she says, and leaves one feeling that even if a part of her honesty and brightness seeps in, the writing may well be worth waiting for."
