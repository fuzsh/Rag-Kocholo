She sets out seeking a perfect homemaker (Grihalakshmi) for her son, so he never faces same fate as his father. In pursuit for a perfect Bride, she chooses the younger, simple-minded sister who meditates, instead of the older one, whom she imagined exactly her own mirror image. Hell breaks out when elder sister discovers that her younger sister has stolen the heart of the boy’s mother. As the story unfolds, a series of events lead to Meditation taking centre stage, encompassing “Bridegroom to be”, who pulls a surprise to declare that all’s well that ends well. There is a twist in the story where each member of the family discovers his/her own happiness during engagement ceremony of both sisters!\n\nFilm Inspiration God created this beautiful world to relish. In its pursuits, human mind somewhere lost track and embraced vices that created great confusion and turmoil; its wear and tear effecting the entire world. While peace and prosperity is most sought after, yet the challenges in the modern world have presented a detrimental impact, causing great concerns for the society. It is few minds that cause disharmony in the world, creating turbulence, leading to unrest, shock and damage. To combat such dreadful effects in our society, these minds need transformation that will put human consciousness on the track of harmony, peace & balance. It is here that we felt the need for a paradigm shift from an ever increasing materialistic pursuit to a divine spiritual experience. The biggest blessing our Nation INDIA provides today, is its spiritual & cultural heritage, where great souls were born to show the light to attaining a higher consciousness (granted by God only to man). Their lives defined a path of righteousness & courage, revealing a universal 2\n\nmessage of how one can find the correct balance to resolve any crises situation with ease and poise. One of the most ancient Practice of Yoga & Meditation has its origins enshrined in the great Sage Markandeya’s Devi Puran - The awakening of the Kundalini Energy, bequeathed to mankind, whichopens the gateway to attaining a level of higher consciousness. In these modern times such important knowledge was never explained in its relevant context, with its practical application not fully understood.\n\nA very simple & practical method called Sahaja Yoga evolved in 1970 by its founder HH Shree MatajiNirmala Devi. Through its practical application, its simple meditation format made millions of seekers of truth across 130 countries gain access to powers of a collective consciousness, which helped them to achieve self-transformation via Self Realisation. Sahaja Yoga offers a very scientific & highly developed meditation technique, which enables man to reach a high level of self-awareness, triggering a positive transformation within. The Kundalini energy residing within each human being since birth, when awakened to 3\n\nits full potential, grants a stress-free life, promising to resolve all conflicts of the mind. This caught the fancy of thousands of seekers across 130 Countries, irrespective of caste, creed, colour, nationality or borders. It embraced all human beings as the creation of one God, to coexist in complete peace & harmony, creating an atmosphere of love, compassion, tolerance & benevolence among all races on earth. The meditation technique taught worldwide, is absolutely free of any fee. It is simple & easy to adapt in day to day life. Feature Film – GRIHALAKSHMI THE AWAKENING offers an introduction to this school of meditation, which in the larger interest of Society,has been well received since its release in India on 26th April 2019. The film’s outstanding results cannot escape your attention. The film touches upon a universal subject of National Importance for every country, offering simple solutions to these turbulent times, where humans can discover their own powers through the practice of Sahaja Meditation, finding contentment in spirituality than in pursuit of materialism. The Film offers a window in finding solutions to the problems that today’s Governments seek, when people will, one day become responsible, wise & lawabiding citizens of their respective countries. It has international relevance, and therefore, we the Production House of the film, most humbly seek its global release in all countries of the world with the assistance & support of our Indian Missions overseas. We seek cooperation & encouragement from all film production houses, to help us promote & release this film in Cinema Theatres in all countries they have offices, such that the pride of our nation’s Ancient Sciences of Yoga & Meditation gets enshrined in every culture of the world.\n\nModern man spends his entire life in pursuit of comfort from health, wealth, relationships, family well-being & social relevance. Yet he seldom finds a perfect balance of all these pursuits, falling short of his expectations or failing to do so. As a slave to his five senses, his attributes are derived from a materialistic approach, hence denying himself the capability to attain a higher order of consciousness, to which he has every right. Ignorance of his birth right to discover his own potential to redemption & freedom from this self-imposed slavery, is causing him pain to survive in an ever growing complicated lifestyle - a major source of problems he encounters today. The entire media today is buzzing with the evils of human endeavour; instilling fear & helplessness, as no real solution seems to be coming forth to quell this increasing disorder in man’s psyche. He is on the precipice of self-destruction, with wars looming large. 4\n\nThe most tried & tested format today is that of Yoga (derived from the word YUJ)- meaning Union. With whom? Union of one’s own self, with a living divine force or energy that created & runs this entire universe – one that is eternal. This yoga is not the physical one, but is one that is found in pure meditation. Sahaja Meditation provides a simple access to a system where man can easily connect to his energy source through his autonomous nervous system, easily correcting the imbalances in his parasympathetic nervous system, thereby granting him the ability to manifest this power within him, and help himself liberate from the bondage of his own slavery to his senses. The awakening of an inner power, called Kundalini (existing in every individual), connects him directly to an energy field called collective consciousness, wherein he begins to gain his control over life and become a problem solver, slowly eradicating all evils within himself – only to discover that the entire world around him can be transformed by sharing this light with all whom he comes in contact with. He becomes a harbinger for peace and a better world order.\n\nIndian & International Cinema has always been a source of great entertainment & knowledge, depicted through the creative insights of the Bollywood & Hollywood Industry since time immemorial. However, this medium has been rarely used to touch upon this highly sensitive subject of Self Realization through Self Awakening using the medium of Meditation. 5\n\nDepiction of Horror, Sexuality, Violence, Loot & Revenge has ruled the big screen for decades, with a rare film coming up and touching the heart strings that long to find solutions to this ever growing menace in the name of entertainment. Except for instilling the thrills in the senses, and fear of the unknown, our World Cinema has never looked at this amazing medium to become a source of Good News & Solutions through self-transformation for a better world order. There is great expectation that the film GRIHALAKSHMI THE AWAKENING will revolutionize Cinema, and as an experimental film on the subject, it will bring forth the very basic knowledge of the science working behind this unique form of Yoga, in its 73 minute run. Audiences will take home an enthralling experience & a seeking, to further their knowledge in this vast ocean of self-transformation, through this form of Yoga. As has been promoted far and wide by our Honorable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi Ji, Yoga in all forms is our national pride, that today India offers to the entire world, as an emerging Super Power. Not only in Economic development & Defence preparedness, but also as the Harbinger of Peace through its powerful Spiritual Heritage. The film belongs to Transformational / Spiritual genre where SAHAJA YOGA teachings of Her Holiness Shree Mata Ji Nirmala Devi has been used judiciously. Though her teachings are vast, nevertheless, we chose the story that focuses on the ‘Grihalakshmi’ principle, which deals with happiness and contentment in day to day household life.\n\nINTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE FILM Grihalakshmi – The Awakening is a film made by a group of creative Yogis, offering a cinematic experience on an ancient concept of Meditation, with a pure desire that it be released in Cinema Theatres worldwide. The Film Introduces Sahaja Meditation to its audiences in the voice of HH Shree Mataji Nirmala Devi (Founder of Sahaja Yoga Meditation Worldwide) in both her pictorial & live Video formats, bringing forth Her Message to Mankind on Inner Awakening through Meditation. The essence of Meditation through Kundalini awakening has been explained in the story of an ordinary middle-class family, where life of the ordinary transforms into an extraordinary existence - How a normal human desire to enjoy a good life for one’s own self, evolves into a Pure Desire to seek higher consciousness through the practice of Sahaja Yoga Meditation, where all inner desires ultimately get fulfilled as a result of this seeking. An individualistic selfish persona gives way to benevolence, experiencing the beauty of an innate love – inborn within, to discover a power that grants all wishes as a by-product. 6\n\nThe Process - The Attention (Chitta), that till now served selfish motives, gets enlightened by a higher consciousness, expanding its limitations & opening a whole new world of Joy and happiness in life. The concept of Kundalini Awakening and the flow of the all Pervading Energy transforming people to discover their inner beings and reflect it in the outside world as a means to achieve the ultimate joy of living, is the main theme of this film - Introducing for the first time in Cinema a positive notion about human emotions, that are not driven by fear to life & dignity, but have the power to feel, nurture & attain a meaningful existence based on a loving & benevolent lifestyle. It’s an eye opener to audiences seeking a new type of content in movies, where such kind of depiction of self-empowerment is rarely seen in the world of Cinema.

Were you not sceptical? My inspiration for the film is: Her Holiness Shree Mataji Nirmala Devi. My inner being longed to make a Feature film even before I was introduced to Shree Mataji (in 1984). As a child I loved to watch films, and rarely missed any new release since my early years in 1961, when I was 6 years old. Music used to mesmerise me and I would spend hours delving in the beautiful melodies of Indian films. In the year 1986, barely 2 years after my initiation into Sahaja Yoga Meditation by Shree Mataji, I began to discover my creative potential as a writer, composer & singer. It started to sprout in my early tears of practice of this meditation. In about 16 years it grew in leaps & bounds till I had reached its zenith. It simply kept flowing from the divine knowledge I had imbibed in the presence of this great Goddess. I kept learning & writing about it in prose, presenting it to Her as an offering at Her Lotus feet, Her own message to mankind, on its tremendous transformative impact it had on my life. My Poetry got composed spontaneously, and my voice developed significantly in both texture, quality & softness. So the moment I rendered it, after She would give the Experience of Self Realisation while addressing world audiences, it begin to work on seekers of truth to help them connect deeply with their own powers within and feel their own transformations. The real inspiration was then planted in my mind by Shree Mataji Herself, when She recommended that my songs be rendered eternal through the digital media. I already had over 21 Albums with 150 songs to my credit. In 2002, she asked me to take it to the next level ie. Cinema. Really the untouched subject had touched my heart so much, that the sprout of my creative instinct, nourished by her words spoken 15 years back, had grown into a full tree. That is when I decided to take the plunge, and bring it all back in the highest form of Cinematic depiction – The Film GrihalakshmiThe Awakening. There was no question of my being sceptical. I simply knew that one day it would happen, and that day happened to be 08th Feb 2017, when I started the Non-Profit NGO – Immaculate Ideal Human Foundation, that finally became the Production House of the film.\n\n14\n\nWhat significant change has the practicing of Sahaja Yoga meditation brought in your life? Undoubtedly, Sahaja yoga Meditation started to work on me from day one. Firstly, it came from a Mother, who appeared before me as the Mother of all Mothers. She was simple, loving, forgiving, cheerful, Joyous & extremely generous – I can say “the most fantastic person I had ever met in my entire life”. I felt the true light of my spirit shine within me. All my falsehood & shortcomings started to become so visible, that if I glanced at them even once, they began to shed away. I could practically wish away all that was negative about me & around me. Such was the impact of the meditation, that a complete transformation of my being had begun. It worked gradually, but surely, that I started feeling a kind of empowerment in my being. I started to see a lot of truth around me - which I could never see earlier. I started to enjoy life, its beautiful moments, that I probably had ignored earlier. It was like a second birth for me. I can sum it up with these words – Life is beautiful. Sorrow never exists. It’s nothing but pure love of the divine that percolates one’s every pore and fills you with a light that you can share and make the world look even more beautiful. I realised the real meaning of this life – And that was to become the harbinger of peace by spreading this light of love that I had received from Her Holiness Shree Mataji Nirmala Devi through the expression of my films.\n\nWhat are your future plans to reach the larger audience? The beauty about time is, that past was my present a while ago, and future will be my present in the next moment. The ocean is large to be reached out. So is the darkness of life that needs to be dispelled with the light of this wondrous awakening. Its profound nature is in a state called “Thoughtless Awareness”. This is the space or void where no thought exists, and where the Super-consciousness can permeate our beings and transform us into beautiful living beings. So that we lead a full, healthy & happy life – full of joy. So my plans are to reach out to this infinite audience through the world of Cinema. Since there are many like me spread over 150 countries who have been through similar experiences like mine, I am keen that all such like-minded persons join hands with me to help me reach out to world audiences. Audiences must also be empowered by doing this meditation and help themselves to a better life & world order. Therefore I would like my film to be seen in most of the Film Festivals of the world. Distribution in all Cinemas of the world can happen in a phased manner. Proper 15\n\nrecognition of the teachings of this meditation must reach out to the common man & those who run Governments & educational institutions. That this meditation becomes a popular means to resolve all problems of the world, so that one day our world can be freed from all man made evils. Hence, my plans are to work on this front till eternity. My NGO shall endeavour by making more such films in the future. Finally, such that it becomes popular in all forms of Media like TV, Social Media & Print. Other formats of participation are live shows, seminars, workshops in public places and corporates both in India & Overseas. One day – that it becomes breaking news.\n\nDoes Sahaja Yoga solves everyone’s problems? This is a very relative question. My answer is “Depends if one really wants to solve, what you call as problems” What many call as “Problems”, are not really problems for some. Unfortunately there are many such people, who think there is no problem at all, in the way things are. It is only the less fortunate ones, who really are in a problem because of such people around. There is a popular saying, that variety is the spice of life. There are those who seek the truth & want to experience it, so as to rise in their human awareness. Sahaja Meditation helps them achieve it, and no doubt, depending upon how sincerely they do it, it works for them. It worked for me in these last 35 years. So my direct answer to your question is YES, but only for such people. Those who do not seek higher awareness or wish to connect to a higher consciousness, are the ones who do not feel the need for it, because they think they are good to go – as they are. For these non-seekers, Sahaja yoga becomes merely a subject of discussion& not experience. For them no problems ever existed, so what is there to solve. That is what makes this question relative. Hence we cannot generalise. It is meant only for those who deserve it. They have to earn it through humility. It firstly empowers you to solve all the problem of your life, provided you stay dedicated, devoted & focussed. Ultimately, it is going to be the only solution to all the problems of this world.\n\nWhat other mediums are available to make the people understand the benefits of Sahaja Yoga? 16\n\nOther mediums are Digital (Virtual) like Internet. It has several websites, particularly www.sahajayoga.org or www.freemeditation.ca, and several others under search words “Sahaja Yoga”. Also there are several book written by enlightened & Self Realised Sahaja Yogis. Besides Shree Mataji Herself has written several books. One of them being “Meta Modern Science”. There are several pre-recorded speeches of Shree Mataji during her programs of granting enlightenment worldwide. These have been preserved in high quality audios & videos available on-line. From time to time Sahaja Yoga Meditation classes are held in all cities of the world on every day of the week. Several Meditation Centres can be found in the same city too. Both National & International seminars are held from time to time the whole year round where several seekers/new people get a better insight to the benefits. Live musical programs, concerts & performance based shows facilitate the meditation process in many of these seminars. UNESCO peace initiative based out of the US conducts several workshops across the globe to educate on its practice & benefits.\n\nIs the entire crew follower of Sahaja yoga? Sahaja Yoga is a way of life. Anyone practicing this meditation in all earnestness, emits positive vibrations around. Half of the crew of the 60 odd crew members were already practicing this meditation before. They came together and pooled their creative resources to contribute to the film. The other half started working with us as hired professionals, with few of them wanting to donate their time & talent, to what appeared to them as a “good cause film”. Both these categories, when they mingled together on the very first day, they performed a “Havan”, which is a sacred ritual to rid of all evil forces from preventing this project to complete. The positive vibrations of those already practicing seemed to have worked wonders on almost all of the rest who were new. And before we knew it almost the entire crew had started this meditation. This collective strength actually became so powerful during the shooting & the post production of the film, that at the end of it one could not differentiate one from the other. Such was the contagiousness of the positivity of this meditation.\n\nWe are curious to know if following this meditation leads as smooth a transition as depicted in the film!\n\n17\n\nActually, life is not that complicated as one makes of it. It’s all in one’s understanding of it. If one is inside of the play, sometimes he cannot be an observer, and his judgement gets clouded. But the moment he begins to see this play from outside, like an audience, he can immediately see more than what he could see when he was in it. It’s as simple as that. You can yourself now answer this question. As audience, you saw how easy & simple (Sahaja) it was, for the meditation to have become a smooth transition to transformation. But really, those who were playing this drama, and that means the real life characters, could have a different perspective & experience. Maybe not as smooth, or maybe very profound. We were limited to a lot of things when coming up with such a film. There was a story between two sisters, and how each one responded to inner desires & expectation from life. But the minute Sahaj Yoga Meditation entered in their lives, it suddenly became less complicated & rather became more enjoyable. That is all the message we wanted to convey. Within the various constraints of having made our very first film, we do see a lot of things we can do to make it a better. We are learning from this experience. I hope that you were moved by the simplicity of the film. It was meant to appeal to our hidden innocence within. Innocence that is very child-like. No wonder children seemed to love the film.\n\n18"
