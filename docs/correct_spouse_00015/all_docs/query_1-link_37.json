He made a comeback as an actor in the 1980s with low budget Malayalam movies before starring in Vaaname Ellai directed by K.Balachander. He then started acting in negative roles in movies like Aval Varuvaala before entering tele serials. In the 2000s, he played crucial roles in the serials Ramany vs Ramany and the supernatural thriller Marma Desam, both directed by Naga. These serials gained him a breakthrough, while he also hosted the show Savaal in Jaya TV. He then appeared as transgender goon Ganga in Radhika’s serial Arasi, before continuing to act further in the serials Raja Rajeshwari and Vani Rani.[1]\n\nAs film offers became less frequent, Prithveeraj spent a year competing as a part of the dance reality show, Jodi Number One during its second season. During the show, he was involved in an on-air altercation with actor and show judge Silambarasan.[2] Since 2010, he has predominantly concentrated on television roles and has featured as a lead character in the soap, Vani Rani. In 2014, he set up a bubble tea shop, Cha Republic, in Besant Nagar, Chennai after being inspired to set up a store following a visit to Malaysia.[3]\n\nPrithveeraj married Beena in 1994,[4] and they have a son named Ahed Mohan Jabbar.[5] Prithveeraj and Beena divorced in 2022 after being separated for six years.\n\nFilms\n\nYear Film Role Language Notes 1971 Naangu Suvargal Tamil Child artist 1972 Needhi Child artist 1974 Amma Manasu Telugu Child artist 1975 Dr. Siva Tamil Child artist 1975 Naalai Namadhe Child artist 1976 Bharatha Vilas Child artist 1979 Naan Vazhavaippen Child artist 1985 Naan Sigappu Manithan 1985 Bandham dancer in song \"Hey Aatha\" 1987 Oru Thayin Sabhatham Madhu 1989 Malayathippennu Malayalam 1989 Paandi Nattu Thangam Ravi Tamil 1990 Sandhana Kaatru Special appearance 1990 Manaivi Oru Manickam 1991 Sigaram Special appearance 1991 Kumbakarai Thangaiah 1991 Azhagan Kumarasan 1991 Vasavadatta Malayalam 1992 Vaaname Ellai Tamil 1993 Naan Pesa Ninaipathellam Guest appearance 1994 Priyanka Special appearance 1994 Thaatboot Thanjavoor 1994 Veeramani Gautham 1994 Mani Rathnam Nadarajan 1994 Pudhiya Mannargal 1994 Thaai Manasu Periya Marudhu 1995 Chellakannu Rajavel 1996 Musthaffaa Lakshmanan 1997 Pelli Prithvi Telugu Nandi Award for Best Villain 1997 Pelli Pandiri Prakash 1997 Raman Abdullah Tamil 1998 Aval Varuvala Prithvi 1998 Circle Inspector Kannada 1998 Pellaadi Choopista Telugu 1998 Deergha Sumangali Bhava Prakash 1999 Samarasimha Reddy Vasu 1999 Hello Yama 1999 Srimathi Vellostha Rajendra 1999 Rajasthan 1999 Panchadara Chilaka Prithvi 1999 Preyasi Raave Sriram 1999 Time Dilip Tamil 2000 Sudhandhiram Charlie 2000 Sammakka Sarakka Telugu 2000 Madhuri 2000 Nagulamma 2000 Nagalingam Raja Tamil 2000 Goppinti Alludu Paramahamsa Telugu 2000 Vyjayanti 2000 Bhavani 2000 Devullu Prashanth 2000 Bachi Bachi 2000 Kante Koothurne Kanu 2000 Sanchalanam 2001 Pandanti Samsaram Narendra [6] 2001 Naa Manasistha Raa 2001 Nuvvu Naaku Nachav Mohan 2001 Nageswari Tamil 2002 Lagna Patrika Subhash Telugu 2002 Santosham Shriram 2002 Chennakesava Reddy Chennakesava Reddy's brother-in-law 2003 Naaga 2003 Annai Kaligambal / Shri Kalikamba Tamil / Kannada 2003 Palnati Brahmanayudu Telugu 2003 Thayumanavan Tamil 2003 Vani Mahal 2004 Love Today Telugu 2004 Swetha Naagu Telugu\n\nKannada Special appearance 2004 Bhagawan Kannada 2005 Keelu Gurram Sadhu Telugu 2005 Gowtam SSC Kondal Rao 2006 Boys and Girls Kumar Tamil 2006 Seethakoka Chiluka Telugu 2006 Chinnodu Ranga Telugu 2007 Best Friends Prithvi Malayalam 2008 Vaaranam Aayiram Asad Tamil 2011 Payanam / Gaganam Chandrakanth Tamil / Telugu 2014 Chandamama Kathalu DK Telugu 2014 Kolagala Kannada 2015 Lailaa O Lailaa Kuppuswamy Malayalam 2017 Ticket Tamil 2017 Patel S.
