        "text": "MR VIVEK\n\nActor Name\n\nVivek\n\nVivekanathan is a Tamil film comedian from India. In contrast to other comedians in Tamil cinema, Vivek is more of a satirist than a slapstick comedian.\n\nHis movies draw humor from scenes of daily life in Tamil Nadu (especially Chennai) and the surrounding regions.\n\nHis jokes often relate to serious subjects, such as bribery, over-population, and political corruption among other things. He is more conscientious and his comedy has more serious undertones than that of his contemporaries.\n\nHe often targets hypocrisy in Indian society and politics and uses satire well to point out contradictions which are often taken for granted by people. He is also well known for his readiness to spoof almost any celebrity. He is mostly popular with urban people as his comedy is of more immediate relevance to them.\n\nIn rural areas, he is less popular than other comedians such as Vadivelu, Senthil, and Goundamani. He has starred in numerous films since the early 90s as a supporting actor and now as a main comedian.\n\nHe has entertained many in his most noted films such as Run, Namma Veetu Kalyanam, Dhool, M. Kumaran son of Mahalakshmi, and many others. He is famously called as Chinna Kalaivanar for his message-oriented comedies.\n\nVivek will appear in other films to come.

He has acted in more than 300 films, which is most of them in Malayalam cinema.\n\nHe is the recipient of 4 National film awards for Best Actor, five State awards and 5 Filmfare awards in the best actor category. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1998 and he is called as the Super Star of Malayalam Cinema along with Mohanlal. Mammootty is rated as one of the talented actors in Indian film indusrty. He is also the current Chairman of TV channel Kairali.\n\nHe was born to Ismail (an agriculturist) and Fatima (a homemaker). Mammootty has two younger brothers, Ibrahim and Zakariah; and three sisters, Ameena, Sauda and Shafina. Mammootty received his education from Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam and then studied law at Ernakulam Government Law College.\n\nIt was during his days at Maharajah’s that Mammootty got his first role in Anubhavangal Paalichakal (1971). He practised as a lawyer in Manjeri, Kerala for two years.\n\nHe got married in 1980 to his wife, Sulfath, and has a daughter, Surmi and a son, Dulquar Salman. Mammootty first film as an actor, Devalokam (World of Gods), was not released in theatres. Famous writer and auteur M. T. Vasudevan Nair and Film director K. G. George played an important part in his career.\n\nMammootty’s talent was noticed in films like Vilkanundu Swapnangal directed by M T Vasudevan Nair and films like Mela and Yavanika, by K.G George. One thing that sets him apart from his contemporaries is the fact that from the beginning itself, he has been able to treat both art-house cinema and commercial potboilers with ease.\n\nHe made his mark during the early period of his career itself by enacting roles in films of stalwarts like M. T. Vasudevan Nair, K.G. George, Padmarajan, P.N. Menon, and Bharathan. Later on his talent was utilized by internationally renowned directors like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, T. V. Chandran, and Pavithran. Mammootty was a regular in movies of Harikumar, Mohan, et al.\n\nThe movies by M.T. Vasudevan Nair and Padmarajan, arguably among the best of Malayalam writer-directors, widened Mammootty’s acting horizon. It may be mentioned that two of M.T. Vasudevan’s movies which bear his autobiographical elements were enacted by Mammootty - Aksharangal and Sukrutham (Harikumar).\n\nThe film New Delhi, directed by Joshy, was a turning point in his career and the film was based on the novel, The Almighty by Irving Wallace. The hero’s portrayal of a victimized journalist, who systematically took revenge on politicians who beguiled him, was noticed and well accepted well by the masses. By then he had achieved superstardom.\n\nHis, Oru CBI Diary kurippu, was also a major landmark in the history of Malayalam Cinema. It brought to fore a new concept of an investigative thriller, fresh presentation of politicians and above all a refreshing idea of the hero.The film went on to create box-office history in Kerala.\n\nFollowing the success of the first CBI film three more murder mysteries sequels were produced with the same cast of characters: Jaagrutha (1989), Sethurama Iyer CBI (2004) and Nerariyan C.B.I (2005, all directed by K Madhu, with Mammootty as Sethurama Iyer, an efficient but unassuming CBI officer.\n\nHe touched the pinnacle of his career in [[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]] (roughly translated as northern heroic folklore), again an M. T. Vasudevan Nair creation. His depiction of a Chekavan of distinguished velour but vilified by circumstances won him the top honors of the country, National Award for best acting.\n\nHis histrionics matched the literary genius of M. T. in each and every minute detail. It was his acting talent, coupled with his willingness to go to any extent to rationally portray the roles that enabled him to act in both offbeat and commercial movies.\n\nHe became almost a regular face in Adoor Gopalakrishna’s films. Mammootty starred in three of his movies, Anantharam (Thenceforth), Mathilukal (alls) and Vidheyan (The Servile) and the easiness with which he illustrated on screen the protagonist in Mathilukkal(based on Mathilukal, a novel by the Malayalam literary genius Vaikom Muhammad Basheer) was also instrumental in getting him his first National Award for Best Actor. His performance in two commercially off-beat movies, Ponthan Mada by TV Chandran, and Adoor Gopalakrishnan’s Vidheyan won him the award for the second time. His performance in Ambedkar, an English movie by Jabbar Patel, won him the National award for a third time.\n\nMammootty is also a recipient of Padma Shri, one of the highest civilian awards in India. Mammootty had briefly crossed the boundaries of Malayalam cinema and acted in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi films. Though he proved that only a moderate success in Tamil after Mani Ratnam’s Thalapathi, his fan following is on par with other Tamil film stars. Mammootty’s notable successes in Tamil include Anandam by Linguswamy and Kandukondain Kandukondain by Rajiv Menon. Unfortunationaly however, his maiden Hindi film, Dhartiputra went unnoticed.\n\nMammootty, nonetheless made his presence felt on the national level with the biographical film on Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Directed by Jabbar Patel. All though he has been criticised as unable to portray comic roles, his latest movies Rajamanikyam, Thommanum Makkalum, and Thuruppugulan gave a fitting reply to critics.\n\nHe, though a hugely popular star, is an exception in Indian films where dancing skills have to be a necessary part of an actor’s repertoire but the emotion and the depth that he lends to his characters makes him a well revered actor and makes up for his shortcomings.\n\nMADDY MADHAVAN\n\nActor Name\n\nMadhavan\n\nActor Full Name\n\nRanganathan Madhavan\n\nFamily\n\nRanganathan-Faterh, Saroja-Mother, Sarita-Wife and Devika- Younger Sister\n\nDate of birth\n\n1st of June 1970\n\nFirst Film\n\nShanthi Shanthi Shanthi (Kannada)\n\nAwards\n\nR.

He is the son of known Indian film producer, R B Choudary. Jeeva debut performance as a film hero was his fatherâ€™s 50th production, Aasai Aasaiyai. Jeeva 2nd film Thithikuthe, a Tamil remake of Uday Kiran’s Telugu film Manasanta Nuvve, was also from his fatherâ€™s banner, Super Good Films.\n\nJeeva has three older brothers: B.Sursh is the joint producer in Super Good Films. Another brother Jeevan is a business magnate. Next is Ramesh. Jeeva is also an actor, now known as Githan Ramesh. Jeeva started off as a child star in 2 of his father’s film productions, one of them being the Sarath Kumar blockbuster Sooryavamsam. Audiences remember Jeeva as the cute boy who brought an estranged father and son together in Sooryavamsam.\n\nHe is the youngest and inarguably the cutest with the boyish charms and killer smile that made people stand up to notice in his debut film Aasai Aasaiyai itself. Jeeva’s father, R B Choudary, produced numerous films, introduced now-famous directors and heroes and is a noted South Indian film producer despite having Hindi as mother tongue and hailing from Rajasthan, a north Indian state.After Aasai Aasaiyai and Thittikudhey, which were romantic Tamil flops, he found himself in a spot of bother, with no good film offers coming his way. Then in 2005, he came back with the mega blockbuster Raam which put him in contention with other young actors in Kollywood like Jayam Ravi, Bharath and Silambarasan. Raam was a one-of-a-kind Tamil movie by critically acclaimed director of the 2002 sleeper hit Mounam Pesiyathe, Ameer Sultan; it falls in the genre of a murder mystery thriller, yet it is primarily a character study. He played Ramakrishna, an autistic schoolboy, desired by the rich girl next door and later accused by her father for murdering his own mother.\n\nJeeva hardly talked throughout the movie, letting his body language demonstrate his character. The movie was one of the highest grossing movies of the year, it was screened at Indian Panorama and later at the Cyprus International Film Festival(CIFF), where it won two awards - the Best Actor award for Jeeva and the Best Musical Score Award for its Music director Yuvan Shankar Raja. For 22-year old, it was not only the first International Award he received, but also his first ever acting award. The only other time a Tamil actor received an international award was when Legendary actor Sivaji Ganesan received the Best Actor Award for his film in 1959, Veerapandiya Kattabomman, at the Afro-Asian International Film Festival in Cairo, Egypt in 1960.\n\nThanks to Raam and Jeeva, this was indeed an honour for Kollywood in 21st century. From then onwards, he has had a successful stint in Dishyum with Kaadhal actress, Sandhya, proving a musical hit. Jeeva played another different role in Dishyum, that of a stuntman in films, this role was different from usual heroic roles in Tamil Cinema. Although the title Dishyum gave viewers the impression of an action-packed film, Dishyum was predominantly a romance between that of a cocksure stuntman and a practical arts student.\n\nThis film won accolades due to the remarkable acting and an impressionable direction by Sasi, director of former hits such as Sollamalae and Roja Kootam. Among his films, Raam, Dishyum, Keerthi Chakra and E are the ones that have done well at the box office. Jeeva’s flops include Aasai Aasaiyai, Thittikudhey, and Pori. Hence, his hits and misses are balanced. Aran was not a flop it was considered a success and his upcoming films are Thamizh MA, Thenavattu and Rameswaram. Jeeva is considered a better actor than his brother Ramesh.\n\nCHERAN D DIRECTOR\n\nActor Nick Name\n\nCheran (director)\n\nCheran is a Tamil film director and actor, who has a reputation for directing and producing culturally strong films.

The young man caught the attention of the film producer, Henry.\n\nHenry was the producer of the Malayalam film Yavanika directed by K.G. George.
