        "text": "valli,\n\n50 years ago, when children were aplenty, jaanavaasam or mappillai azhaippu was a big thamasha looked forward by one and all.\n\nto narrate from 'washingtonil thirumanam', the main ingredients were an open car, nadaswaram, lots of bejewelled women carrying fruits and goodies, sombre men discussing in whispers whatever, lots of kids running about, squishing the groom, who used to sit like a dressed up doll in the back of the car, crowded by the kids, and the petromax lamps carryied by nari kuravas, followed by the barking dogs.\n\nit was a must, that every once ina while a toddler would be thrust on his lap, who would sqeal and howl, and invariable one of them would wet the new mapillai suit, and in rare cases even stain it with their business. all in good fun and tolerated those times.\n\nit was more a procession for the public. traffic would stop, people would ogle, and make discrete enquiries as to who and whereabouts of the mapillai. by the time i married, this practice was on the wane, and for moi, it was a quick private trip to a temple near the would be inlaw's house, a quick prayer and back to the mandapam for food.\n\nin recent marriages, this has been shelved in india.\n\nbut in toronto, we have adopted the north indian baraat with gusto. on wedding morning, the bridegroom arrives to the mandapam perched uncertainly on a goda, with a sardar doing the bhangra beat, the more energetic mamis and mamas doing the 'light bulb', if they can muster up the energy early morning\n\ngo with the flow, i say\n\nWould there be anything wrong with the groom sitting in his mom's lap as well? I think the brides wouldn't take that one lying down! (figuratively speaking).\n\nOk personally speaking I just love this whole custom/idea of sitting on my dad's lap during thali kattu. Its the most special and unique thing and very intimate. This is the sole reason why I love the tambrahm style wedding. In fact i had decided years ago i want to sit on my dad's lap, whoever I marry, even if he isn't tb because i love this custom. This is probably the 1st and last chance i ever have of sitting on my dad's lap. We haven't done that since we were what? 11 perhaps....so yeah i don't care what anyone says. I shall insist on this\n\nHaving said that, of course it is upto the father/daughter to decide on this if one is too frail and the other weighty or something.\n\nPS: This definitely beats the Telugu custom of having to put the bride in a basket or pot or some such and all her mamas (mother's brothers or cousin brothers) have to carry her to the mandapam. Probably in case she does a runner!\n\nSowbagyavathy Renuka, Greetings.\n\nMostly, Tamil Brahmin weddings are conducted by the bride's family. So, they also act as hosts to the groom family. Usually, the groom & his family goes to the nearest temple (just a psychologically auspicious venue) and proceeds to the wedding venue from there. Well, majority of the boys travel the short distance in a rented covertible car; I have seen grooms going in cycle-rickshaw. ( I got married in my own village. I walked. I didn't know the benefits of walking! It was great!). At the wedding venue, the groom gets received by the bride. That is known as 'mapillai azhaippu'.\n\nCheers!\n\nThanks Raghy dear,\n\nYou know out here its different..when I got married..the guys side will come take the girl to the marriage hall and the guy comes himself in a car for the wedding.\n\nThe groom is not received by the girls side..he comes there on his own before the bride comes cos in Malaysia Non Brahmin marriage all the expenses for the marriage is by the groom side only.\n\nOnly the engagement is by the girls side.\n\nSo in Malaysia if you have many sons there goes all your money!!!\n\nSowwbagyavathy Renuka, Greetings.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu too, amoung NBs, it is customary for the groom side to foot the expenses for the wedding. In those marriages, it would be 'penn azhaippu' on the eve of the wedding.\n\nCheers!\n\nraghy,\n\nfrom what i know and hear, this situation does not exist anymore.\n\nalready in 60s, with the start of spread of knowledge base away from tambram/pillai/mudaliar to other castes,during the initial transformation stages, the prospect of an urban educated groom became an attractive proposition.\n\nthe law of supply and demand stepped in, and very soon, the concept of dowry from the girls and the girls' side footing the wedding expenses made its ugly inauguration.\n\nnowadays with aplenty of male graduates, and female NBs still lagging behind their 'upper caste' sisters in education, job skills, career paths and (rural girls' parents) status sybol of படிச்ச மாப்பிள்ளை, the boys demand, (& GET), dowries running into tens of lakhs of rupees.\n\nmany a times, it is not so blatantly termed as dowry. it could be setting up a medical practice, and if he is a specialist, investing in expensive equipments such as xray or scanning or blood test labs and such like.\n\nwhich is why, when these guys fall in love and marry upper caste girls, for them a trophy wife, these poor girls are constantly harassed by the boy's family. because these u.c. girls come with no dowry or support from their parents, and the boys' parents feel 'deprived' of a good chunk of money, gold and other luxuries.\n\non occassions, the boys, due to constant family badgering, fall into the trap laid by the parents, and end up harassing the girls, forcing them to abandon their 'love', divorce. and then end up marrying their own caste, for a fat dowry and community acceptance.\n\ninterestingly, the case of prashant, the actor, a mudaliar, is a case worth mentioning here. the knowledge is public, for those following movie news. prashant, at the height of his career, got into an arranged marriage, with a rural girl. the price of marrying this country bumpkin, was tons of gold (believe me, it was easier to measure as fraction of ton, than in numbers of sovereigns.).\n\nthe facts are a bit hazy here. apparently the girl had someone else in mind, and it was discovered after the marriage, that she was indeed carrying a baby. prashant denied parenthood to the baby, divorced. which the wife objected, even though she went back to her parents. with the baby, but without the dowry. thanks to the influence of prashant family (father thiagarajan is himself prominent in tamil filmdom) there is no more news of the eventual settlement.\n\nthere is a huge commercial building near arcot road bearing prashant's name.\n\nunfortunately, all this negative publicity, sank prashant's career. he of jeans and such great hits, was subsidized by his dad into making a third rate flop 'ponnar sankar' produced and directed by dad, after 5 years of no movies. poor guy. or was it greed on dad's part.\n\ni dont know. but a sad story nevertheless.\n\nbtw, indian penal law makes demand of dowry a crime. though giving of it is not. so in many cases, i have heard, as an insurance policy, bride's family pays the dowry, but publicly announces it and has sufficient proof of the giving, so that in any future situations, the girl always has an upper hand. after all, it is her word of mouth evidence against the spouse. and the law, these days in india, on domestic cases, swings towards the woman.\n\njai mata! jai பெண்ணினம்\n\nraghy,\n\nfrom what i know and hear, this situation does not exist anymore.\n\nalready in 60s, with the start of spread of knowledge base away from tambram/pillai/mudaliar to other castes,during the initial transformation stages, the prospect of an urban educated groom became an attractive proposition.\n\nthe law of supply and demand stepped in, and very soon, the concept of dowry from the girls and the girls' side footing the wedding expenses made its ugly inauguration.\n\nnowadays with aplenty of male graduates, and female NBs still lagging behind their 'upper caste' sisters in education, job skills, career paths and (rural girls' parents) status sybol of படிச்ச மாப்பிள்ளை, the boys demand, (& GET), dowries running into tens of lakhs of rupees.\n\nmany a times, it is not so blatantly termed as dowry. it could be setting up a medical practice, and if he is a specialist, investing in expensive equipments such as xray or scanning or blood test labs and such like.\n\nwhich is why, when these guys fall in love and marry upper caste girls, for them a trophy wife, these poor girls are constantly harassed by the boy's family. because these u.c. girls come with no dowry or support from their parents, and the boys' parents feel 'deprived' of a good chunk of money, gold and other luxuries.\n\non occassions, the boys, due to constant family badgering, fall into the trap laid by the parents, and end up harassing the girls, forcing them to abandon their 'love', divorce. and then end up marrying their own caste, for a fat dowry and community acceptance.\n\ninterestingly, the case of prashant, the actor, a mudaliar, is a case worth mentioning here. the knowledge is public, for those following movie news. prashant, at the height of his career, got into an arranged marriage, with a rural girl. the price of marrying this country bumpkin, was tons of gold (believe me, it was easier to measure as fraction of ton, than in numbers of sovereigns.).\n\nthe facts are a bit hazy here. apparently the girl had someone else in mind, and it was discovered after the marriage, that she was indeed carrying a baby. prashant denied parenthood to the baby, divorced. which the wife objected, even though she went back to her parents. with the baby, but without the dowry. thanks to the influence of prashant family (father thiagarajan is himself prominent in tamil filmdom) there is no more news of the eventual settlement.\n\nthere is a huge commercial building near arcot road bearing prashant's name.\n\nunfortunately, all this negative publicity, sank prashant's career. he of jeans and such great hits, was subsidized by his dad into making a third rate flop 'ponnar sankar' produced and directed by dad, after 5 years of no movies. poor guy. or was it greed on dad's part.\n\ni dont know. but a sad story nevertheless.\n\nbtw, indian penal law makes demand of dowry a crime. though giving of it is not. so in many cases, i have heard, as an insurance policy, bride's family pays the dowry, but publicly announces it and has sufficient proof of the giving, so that in any future situations, the girl always has an upper hand. after all, it is her word of mouth evidence against the spouse. and the law, these days in india, on domestic cases, swings towards the woman.\n\njai mata! jai பெண்ணினம்\n\nHey Kunjs,\n\nYou know that Prashanth case..it was Thiagarajan who wanted a \"homely\" looking girl for his son and did not want anyone from the film world and he married this rather matronly looking rich female who was actually married before to someone else by registered marriage.\n\nShe had ditched her 1st hubby when they had some misunderstanding..thats the story and BTW the child is Prashants not the 1st husbands.\n\nSo Prashant got the marriage annulled cos it was not valid anymore.\n\nSo remember \"homely\" looks can be like still water run deep but dont know why people still like \"homely\" looks so much like how many guys are crazy for actress Devayani for the same reason but I feel she doesnt have good features at all.\n\nDear Sri.Kunjuppu, Greetings.\n\nraghy,\n\nfrom what i know and hear, this situation does not exist anymore.\n\nalready in 60s, with the start of spread of knowledge base away from tambram/pillai/mudaliar to other castes,during the initial transformation stages, the prospect of an urban educated groom became an attractive proposition.\n\nthe law of supply and demand stepped in, and very soon, the concept of dowry from the girls and the girls' side footing the wedding expenses made its ugly inauguration.\n\nnowadays with aplenty of male graduates, and female NBs still lagging behind their 'upper caste' sisters in education, job skills, [COLOR=#da7911 !important][FONT=inherit !important][COLOR=#da7911 !important][FONT=inherit !important]career [/FONT][COLOR=#da7911 !important][FONT=inherit !important]paths[/FONT][/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR][/COLOR] and (rural girls' parents) status sybol of படிச்ச மாப்பிள்ளை, the boys demand, (& GET), dowries running into tens of lakhs of rupees.........\n\nAs far as I remember, dowry system existed amoung NBs as early as 1970s. I observed few Mudaliar sections and Nadar sections demanded and received huge dowry payments, many times more than brahmins. It had nothing to do with groom's education levels. In 2004 when I visited my village, my lower jaw just hung open when I heard our village ensnared a CBSC English medium higher secondary school; plus an Engineering college (quite a decent one at that. They have an affliation with one of the prestegious universities in Australia). Simple looking children have become Engineers! Girls study well too. I met my old classmate, a dobby (வண்ணாத்தி ) in 2010. She was still continuing the same profession; her daughter was studying in the local Engineering college.\n\nBut, as of today, only the groom families spend for the wedding. There is no change in that. It is a prestige issue for them.\n\nwhich is why, when these guys fall in love and marry upper caste girls, for them a trophy wife, these poor girls are constantly harassed by the boy's family. because these u.c. girls come with no dowry or support from their parents, and the boys' parents feel 'deprived' of a good chunk of money, gold and other luxuries.\n\nI don't know about this. May be, you know of few cases. But, I know few cases otherwise. My own niece married IC; I noticed, she is treated well by her mother-in-law. I know of few other cases too. I can not judge from one Prasanth example. I have other examples that show otherwise.\n\nCheers!\n\nDear members\n\nAlright, much has been discussed about tamil brahmin marriage and the inconvenience of the girl sitting on her father's lap and so on!\n\nNow, I want to know about the convenience/inconveniene of boys regarding the 'Mapillai ayaizhppu'! Those who experienced it - did you like it? Did you guys feel embarressed? What was/is your opinion?\n\nWhat about the future grooms' view?\n\nKind regards\n\nSowbagyavathy Valli, Greetings.\n\nWhat is inconvenient in 'mapillai azhaippu'? It's all fun. I enjoyed it. Actually, it was a bonus for me! Our wedding took place in a large house in our own street. The temple is at the end of the street. I offered to walk from the temple to the wedding venue (but, I didn't know I had to stop at all the houses, only about 8 though). I was just wearing a simple 'veshti' and a sleeveless shirt, with the inevitable garland. Surprise awaited me at the first house; I was asked to stand on a மணை, my feet were washed, nalangu was applied with the song 'சீதா கல்யாண வைபோகமே....'! It happened at every house! At the bride's home, besides nalangu and a song, ஆரத்தி was done. The same thing happened at my home too. Then I went to the wedding venue, received by the girl who is my wife for the last 30 plus years. I enjoyed it.\n\nLet's hear the future groom's views now!\n\nCheers!\n\nDear Raghy Anna\n\nWhen I wrote it, all I had in my mind was the 'mappillai azhappu' i.e. the procession in the car! All the marriages I have attended (of my cousins, I have 17 totally) the 'mappillai azhappu' was always the procession of the groom sitting in the car and little children also being sat on either side of him!\n\nWhen my girl cousin was married off the groom refused the above procession and told our side to select a temple as close as possible to the mandapam. The girl's family made a special request that at least the groom sit in the decorated car and pose just in front of the mandapam instead of having the procession. So the groom walked from the temple and just sat in the car and posed for the photo and the girl was also made to sit next to him in the car!\n\nAnother male cousin of mine refused the car concept totally! So it was a walk from the temple.\n\nNice to hear that you had good fun and enjoyed your 'mappillai azhappu'!\n\nKind regards\n\nDear Kunjuppu Ji,\n\nThe info about Prashant the actor was interesting. Am told his ex-wife (named grihalakshmi incidentally) is no rural girl, her family has plenty of rural properties and very very wealthy....her uncle is a well established doctor in chennai city....had heard this divorce story aplenty.\n\nRumors go that grihalakshmi was in love before marriage and married the guy (venu) in 1998. The guy was a cheat, and so they seperated ways.\n\nMuch later in 2005 she agreed to marry prashanth. By this time she was seperated from her first husband for quite a long time; and she was definitely not pregnant with his child.\n\nThe child's father is prashant indeed. Which is why prashant complained that he is not allowed to see his son. Came across this -- Dailynews - My wife is already married\n\nNow the whole point is Prashant himself has had a string of ladies in his life. What he himself was upto is pretty much whispered about. But the society practices double standards of nailing a lady for her one single past affair.\n\nRumours go that grihalakshmi despite bringing a fat dowry was harassed for more. There were also MIL DIL problems.\n\nI suppose some MILs overlook all the deficiencies in her son, but are sadists when it comes to taunting and harassing the DIL.\n\nPrashant is the only son, he has a sister. The receipe for trouble was all there.\n\nProbably grihalakshmi realised what matters to prashant and his family was her money.\n\nShe probably realised after 2 failed weddings and a son in hand she is never going to get married ever again. Nothing prevents prashant from marrying again.\n\nThe lady rightfully demanded alimony of one lakh a month for herself and her son's future. But then Prashant said he wants to reunite with his wife !! and the alimony amount became a contested issue.\n\nAs for prashant's future, there is no audience waiting for him...Kollywood has moved on to making technically advanced movies these days..\n\nThe man probably has to thank his parents for his failed film career and his failed wedding. ...Anyways, prashant's family is quite wealthy, and i suppose business, real estate investments, etc are always available..\n\nBtw, i thot grihalakshmi is pretty, her pix.....everyone is beautiful in their own right. Asian features does not make anyone less beautiful...\n\nAnyways, i suppose beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder...if one likes an other person, the other person will automatically look beautiful. The sense of 'attraction' to me depends on past life vasanas.\n\nIf one does not like an other person, then even aishwarya rai wud look ordinary or ugly. Which is why possibly we see so many negative comments on the looks of beautiful women like aishwarya rai, vidya balan, preity zinta, etc...\n\nHappy,\n\nhorse-back \"mappillai azhaippu\" (MA) has come from Rajputs I think. None of the ordinary hindus of Kerala used horses; of course, elephants were used in the procession by the royalty and such-like but the groom was either in a palnquin or a throne carried by bearers just as idols are taken around in utsavams.\n\nOnly when motor car came the tabras took to it in an eager way.\n\nBTW, I did not want MA, nalanku, etc., and our marriage went off without those, 47 years ago.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI don't know about Kerala but i think groom on horse back was quite common in southern india across various communities. I had a kallar friend whose groom came on horse back. I also heard a kallar groom came for his wedding sitting on a elephant about 15 years back in his village. Among telugu NBs, grooms on horseback was fairly common in the past am told, which is why grooms wear their wedding dhoti parted between the legs like this to be able to sit on a horse.\n\nAm told horse was the only means of transport for tax collectors back then. As such men generally used horses. Women ofcourse were doomed to bullock carts. When cars came, the horse was seen as poor man's transport. Somehow cars became the must-haves for mappilai azaipu. Families still using the horse in the 60s and 70s were seen as backward. Not many could afford a motor car back then.\n\nRegards."
