        "text": "Recall the recent past when Dasari Narayana Rao's daughter-in-law also had approached the court of law seeking justice in the matter of property. Then when Dasari was asked to give explanation he simply replied, \"I failed as a father and father-in-law'. That's the answer which needs no further query.\n\nPrashanth, the Tamil hero also said that women today are using the advantage given by law and trying to pull as much as they can when terms go wrong with husband or in-laws.\n\nNagarjuna's first wife issue didn't turn out to be nuisance just because of gentleman settlement. Even now Dr Ramanaidu and Dr ANR meet each other in happy terms. That's the sign of good understanding and maturity. After all, everybody is human being and problems with human relations are common for all. The maturity comes out in the point of settling them.\n\nComing to Pawan Kalyan-Nandini issue, a leading News Daily mentioned that Nandini filed case as settlement wasn't done till now. It implies that Pawan Kalyan and his family have shown recalcitrance to Nandini's pleas. The result is seen now. Everything has gone public. It's a sign of black mark for Chiranjeevi's family as the girl mentioned 'Griha Himsa' aspects in her complaint. She also said that the influence of Chiranjeevi suppressed her from giving compliant all these days.\n\nWhenever be the issue, the problem that can be solved with 1 stitch has now extended to nine."
