        "text": "Remember the James Bond movie Goldfinger? Then you remember this dialogue \"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action.\" And if you look at the pace of random geopolitical actions happening globally, it cant be anything but enemy action and counter action. But before that it was foretold in the celestial skies that when Mars conjunction Uranus along with fixed star Algol there would be serious events that would change the course of geopolitics globally. July 12-20 is the most intense period. And the planetary combinations suggest that it should continue at least till end June 2025. So let’s understand what are the series of events that took place thus far. 1. A week before Trump’s attempted assassination short positions in $DJT Trumps own platform more than doubled. 2. June 13, Trump survives an assassination attempt and re-emerges stronger punching the air & chants Fight. Fight. Fight. Now the failed attempt has the Dems on the backfoot - rather on the run. Trump also says that he will work for MAGA and take the world along. 3. JD Vance out of the blue is Trump’s running mate. Incidentally JD Vance was anti Trump and his wife is a Democrat hardliner. Was a deal struck between Trump and the Deep State. He also attacked the leftist cabal calling UK the first Islamic nuke state. 4. July 13 Indian press goes ecstatic over Kamala Harris - RaGa telecon. This is denied by Kamala’s office and post that RaGa disappears. Was RaGa played via a prank call to reveal his next move in India? Did The Deep state silence him. 5. July 18, Xi Jin Ping suddenly disappears. Has a power struggle erupted in China? 6. July 19, CrowdStrike blows up and brings the world servers to a grounding halt. Yet impacts only Macintosh and Windows 10 & Office 365 servers. Windows11 and other systems continue to work. It’s not a bug but a deliberate take down. Apparently there is a CrowdStrike server in Ukraine that carries all the dark secrets of the activities of the present leaders of the West. And Trump wanted to lay hands on this way back even before his election as President in 2020. And the only way to wipe a server off its contents is to bring it down instantly. Was this a negotiated settlement between the Deep State and global nationalists. Cause just one day before on July 18 Putin makes a statement that the West cannot pressurize Modi. It is believed that the oligarchs (Russians) were able to lay their hands on this server in the ongoing Ukraine Russia conflict. And on the sidelines of the Deep State interference in India, negotiated settlements were going on with DeepState and Modi govt and the pre wedding parties at Jamnagar and on the cruise ship culminating on July 12 with the wedding. Since then have you noticed the resurgence of Yogi ji in UP and the silence around Manipur and communal riots (by RaGa)\n\nToday I want to touch upon a sincere topic of Modi versus RSS. 1. It is my firm belief that RSS has suddenly become power hungry. And not the other way around because Modi has always been a politician, at least for the last 25 years. 2. The RSS charter has been about selfless service Mohan Bhagwat should continue doing that. 3. Publicly shaming Modi without naming him and washing dirty linen in public is just not done. 4. And in the anger to oppose Modi and tying up with Rahul Gandhi is just not the done thing. 5. Mohan Bhagwatji what is the point of becoming anti national just to challenge Modi. Can someone ask this question on my behalf to Bhagwatji. 6. Why does Bhagwat want his minions in the cabinet and positions of power. 7. Modi did a splendid job by getting professionals like Ashwini Vaishnav DOVAL and Jaishankar into the cabinet. And if he wants to professionalise it then what is the harm. 8. By not supporting Modi and hence BJP IN 2024 elections, Bhagwat is aligning the RSS in sync with the Deep State ideology which is destroying the world as we know it. 9. Mr. Bhagwat it would be better to course correct forget your personal ambition and let Modi do the job of governing this country. 10. Your role is to support the power in the centre ensure that it remains in power and the Hindutva brigade lives on forever. 11. Your role as the silent force is 100% contributory for Sanatan revival. But you have zero iota of understanding of how to govern a country as complex as India. Don’t even think that you can. You can’t. 12. The realisation of 11. Is very important and the starting point for your cooperation and not opposition to the Modi government.\n\nKia Trump while speaking at a Republican event clearly put forth a human touch to the personality of Donald Trump. This speech by his granddaughter clearly is the kick in the centre of the leftists who - want to abandon family values - want pronouns to replace he/she - want children to take decisions on sex change - want islamization of of the world to establish one world government - snatch individual freedoms away by indenting future generations for life Yea! These are the aspirations they have for us, the global idiots that apparently they take us for. Modi, Trump, Putin and and a few European leaders are those who stand up to them and hence they want them to be removed from power or eliminated as long as the Deep State cabal is able to push through their agenda. One of the strongest vote of change against these elite bastards is to elect Trump to power and ensure that the Ukraine war is snuffed out before the end of this year. Yes in India Modi will manage the situation because he is your one man army that stands up to the leftist-urban naxal-Islamist-communist-deep stateCongress-RSS cabal who are power hungry and want him to go.\n\nWhen Krishna’s time was up, Yadavas fought amongst themselves and destroyed a great civilization. And while Kaliyug is still going on we are having a mini cycle coming to and end. That mini cycle portends the destruction of the Deep State, Leftist, Communist and Wahabi ideology. If one were to look up to skies and try to read the astro signatures any astro expert will tell you that we are in for tough times. And the global scenario also looks similar is it not. It’s all been the workings of the Deep State who want to maintain their stranglehold on humanity and instil a one world govt run through their proxies and “Rule based order.” Their rule based order ensured that the entire Europe aligned with the idea of war and pit Christian against Christian in the Ukraine Russia war where close to million have died. In the bargain all these countries have seen their countries tottering on the brink of a recession. But the European countries are fighting back now. First the countries have nationalist governments being elected back to power. Next is to deport the illegal kmmigrants out of the country. Now remember when you cut off a snakes head it can still fight back and try to bite and inflict its poisonous venom on you. So nations will see a blood rioting happening everywhere. India is not exception where the agents of these Deep State egotistical one world government fanatics are importing demography changing radicals into the country.\n\nDo you want to know what Modi is up against? Hear this. 1. Nagpur spoke up against NaMo after 3.0 win. If you study the heavy losses that BJP suffered then you will notice that it is in the locations which are the forte of the Sangh. Nagpur has no understanding of the dynamic nature of geo politics and they have become power hungry. 2. If you go through the daily price trend of petrol and diesel you will notice that whatever may have been the crude price, the fuel prices remained fairly constant. This was because NaMo did not allow anyone to make windfall gains from sharply falling crude prices. Obviously this upset India’s richest businessman as he could not make profits. This businessman in 2019 had funded a faction of the BJP (led by Highway man), India’s oldest party and also the third front. Even then Modi became PM in 2019. Today this businessman went to give wedding card to the first lady of India’s oldest party. Recall Modi had spoken about tempo full of money reaching this party’s offices after the 3/4th round of voting. So this Businessman is the messenger between Nagpur and the Lady. 3. Incidentally the Businessman’s son had many pre-wedding parties where many Deep State agents were seen cozying up together and working to topple Modi govt. Sensing that something could go wrong Modi raised the bar with his 400 paar slogan and also bought CBN and Niki together. Hedging his bets ensured that Modi 3.0 became a reality despite not getting 272 on his own. Now you will realise what Modi is up against. Deep State + Nagpur + Sino Wahabi Leftists + Indian businessman. Simple common sense will tell you that money power can easily derail the Modi govt anytime. But with his back to the wall, Modi will swing this around and with the immense blessings of Lord Almighty he will emerge victorious. The game was already on. Now its Modi’s turn to play.\n\nSome quick thoughts on Modi speech in Parliament and other political happenings of yesterday. 1. MODI stated openly that Balak Budhi behaviour although childish will not be treated with kids gloves. 2. He also stated that the ecosystem will be replied to in exactly same way as the Leftist ecosystem has been treating us. It was not limited only to the INC and the opposition parties but also globally a message was sent to the Deep State. Now unknown gunmen will be active. 3. Yesterday Ex RAW Chief Rajinder Khanna was made additional NSA. Also TV Ravi Chandran special Director IB has been appointed as Deputy NSA. So both RAW and IB keep a close watch on global happenings and have been very active in Pakistan ( remember unknown gunmen 😛😂). Now relate 2 with 3. 4. Modi is scheduled to visit Russia next week. Putin a few days back said “ no topic is off limits.” This is strong messaging and apart from discussing and strengthening trade ties there will also be signing off on either countries using each others soils for military logistics in play. Its Modi 3.0 first state visit. And the West is already stressed with that. 5. HATHRAS stampede is going to put more pressure on Yogi govt. It is already believed that this faud Hindu ‘Bhole Baba’ who conducted this unauthorised Sabha has killed 116. Action has been initiated against them. 6. While a case has been filed in the SC against some aspects of the new Legal Samhita there is not much hue and cry otherwise. This is going to be the weapon with which Modi 3.0 will wield tremendous power and bring to justice and stop the Bail Bail game that power politicians and the Sibal-Singhvi types have been playing. 7. If you remember (Suzanne) Arundhati Roy Deep state mole? An FIR has been filed against her and that is the first assault on the Deep State. More to come. And the Deep State ecosystem will be dismantled here in India. It is what Amit Shah has often iterated. Now connect the dots between 6 & 7. 8. Most Important Allahabad HC has started s in its judgement that if the majority do not protect themselves against conversion then it won't be time before the majority becomes the minority."
