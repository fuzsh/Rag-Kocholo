        "text": "Delivering the verdict on a divorce petition filed by Prashanth, Principal Judge P Ramalingam observed that the marriage between Grihlakshmi and another man namely Narayanan Venu Prasad has been proved beyond doubt and the fact was suppressed when she once again married to actor Prashanth, hence it is no longer valid.\n\nHowever, Prashanth’s another prayer to get full custody of his son from Grihlakshmi was dismissed by the court. Reacting to the judgment outside the courtroom, Prashanth said, “My four year struggle in the married life has been ended today and hopes for better days ahead.” He said, “My lawyer would soon move a new petition in the court to get the child’s full custody and I don’t want my kid to be in wrong place.” Prashanth had married to Grihlakshmi, in September 2005 at a grand function.\n\nBut within three months, differences cropped up between them and Grihlakshmi left Prashanth to her home. In 2006, Grihlakshmi gave birth to a baby boy and Prashanth was denied to see his son either at hospital or at her home. In October 2006, Prashanth filed a restitution petition in the Family Court and sought the court’s intervention to unite him with his estranged wife."
