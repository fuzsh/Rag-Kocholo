        "text": "This dissertation tracks three decades of the relationship between the Bombay film industry and the Indian state as it relates to the question of infrastructural reform. This period is bracketed off by 1939, the year of the All India Motion Picture Congress, and 1969, the year the Indian New Wave burst onto the scene. Briefly, what I show in the dissertation is that the project of reform of the Bombay film industry was always already delayed, missing the mark or slipping by. While the factors responsible for such a state of affairs are too many to enlist, the two main ones can be, at the risk of simplification, be declared outright. One is the failure of the political class which made up the post-Independence state to understand the very nature of cinema: the range of affects it generates, its play with desire. Secondly, and tied to the first reason, is the failure of the Congress-led state to recognize or match up to the dynamics of indigenous capital, which was effectively the determinant economic force within the film industry. In short, what the Congress-coalition missed in its attempt to size up the film industry to the austere ideals of Nehruvian socialism was that this indigenous capital was itself shifting alliances, tapping into newer reserves of popular energy, desire and affect as the 60s were ending. The fast-eroding nationalist consensus between state and capital which, I hope to show, ultimately led to the paradigmatic shifts in the film industry could not in retrospect be contained either by rigorous policymaking, mere censoring of film content or relentless taxing, yet this is what the state unsuccessfully tried to do.\n\nThis chapter covers audio-visual services in the Australia-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA). It shows that the Australian film market has potential—demand size, cultural diversity, supply size—to attract the EU film industry, and hence to envisage negotiations favourably. An overview is presented of audio-visual provisions in the FTAs concluded to-date by Australia and the EU. The level of protection granted by existing Australian and EU regulatory barriers is assessed. The chapter argues that the Australia-EU FTA negotiators should seek to increase market access by improving the provisions on co-production that exist in the Australia-Korea and Korea-EU FTAs. These provisions have the merit not only of reducing the remaining regulatory barriers, but also of offering some opportunities to address the problems raised by large and increasing subsidies: subsidies are fast becoming the most important global problem facing the film industries.\n\nThis dissertation explores the ways in which postwar East Asian cinema was shaped by the practice of transnational collaborations and competitions between newly independent and still existing colonial states at the height of Cold War cultural politics. More specifically, my aim is to elucidate the extent to which postwar film studios aspired to rationalize and industrialize the system of mass-production by way of co-producing, expanding the market, and co-hosting film festivals. I argue that the emergence of these motion picture studios was the offspring of the Cold War and American hegemony. While providing financial aids to film industries and supporting the cultural elite, U.S. agencies helped to initiate the first postwar inter-Asian film studio network. It is a new attempt to reconstruct East Asian film history. By unveiling these cinematic links, the previously unquestioned history of quintessential national cinema is reassessed. I claim that the concept of national cinema is a fictional construct precariously built upon the denial of the regional cinematic sphere.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Ethiopia has witnessed the rapid growth of a local digital film industry whose economic model is similar to the one adopted by other industries of this kind emerged in African countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. Films are shot in digital format, are independently funded and commercially-driven, use Amharic as main language and target local and diasporic audiences. Unlike other productions of this kind around the continent, however, Ethiopian video films are firstly released in the large cinema theatres that characterize Addis Ababa’s urban landscape, and later circulate via VCDs, in Ethiopia, and in internet, throughout the diaspora. Within a context defined by a relatively tight governmental control on media production and circulation, the emergence of this phenomenon is introducing important transformations, and modifying the way locally-produced media are perceived and consumed within the Ethiopian public sphere. While being commercially oriented, in fact, videos do produce a social and moral commentary which portrays, and in some cases criticizes, the way the society has transformed over the past few years.\n\nThis thesis is a study of how regional film and television companies in Norway manage to survive and achieve their goals in the context of a larger film and television business that is centralised, economically fragile, and subsidy dependent. Interest in production studies has boomed in recent years, but little of this research addresses regional film and television companies. This thesis employs a production studies approach and incorporates theory on place and work on the creative industries. It contributes to the limited amount of research that accounts for both structural framework—in particular, the impact of film policy and dependence on public funding on these companies—and agency in terms of the intrinsic value of regional film and television production in a local, national and global context. Using multiple perspectives, this thesis presents an in-depth exploration of the advantages and disadvantages of being a regional film and television company. The case study is its principal methodological approach, including interviews with film workers at four companies and employees at six regional film agencies, as well as policy documents, websites, newspapers and productions. The thesis focuses on four well-established regional film and television companies that have produced critically acclaimed films. All are located outside Oslo, the hub of film production in Norway. The four companies are Original Film in Tromsø, Northern Norway, Flimmer Film in Bergen, Western Norway, Mer Film in Tromsø/Bergen, Northern/Western Norway, and Filmbin in Lillehammer, central Eastern Norway. This thesis argues that one of the greatest challenges to these regional companies (and the government that supports them) is how to develop strong, sustainable regional film milieus among a scattered populace like Norway’s. The regions suffer from low production volume and brain drain and the research shows that these companies rely on human resources to deal with this challenge. Policy development indicates that the public funding of regional film is mostly based on regional and economic, but also cultural, arguments—regional film, that is, should contribute to regional development, economic growth and diversity. I argue that the economic and rural political rationale for support of this business tends to undermine the cultivation of the cultural value of regional film, as well as its quality and professionalism. However, the companies have managed to produce critically acclaimed films and the thesis reveals how the peripheral location can be a creative and economic advantage."
