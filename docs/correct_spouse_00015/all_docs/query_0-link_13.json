        "text": "New Delhi: Tamil superstar Prashanth flew to Kuala Lumpur to clarify that he was not going to marry a Malaysia based girl.\n\nThe actor denied media reports and assured his fans that he was still eager to strike peace with his estranged wife.\n\n\"I am trying to find out what went wrong with my marriage. I want to get back to my wife. That's why I have filed in the court for restitution of conjugal rights,\" news agency PTI quoted the actor as saying.\n\n\"The reports in the media are very hurting, Malaysia is like my second home and with so many fans here, I did not want to upset them. I wanted to come here and clear my name,\" he added.\n\nHis father, Thiagarajan, a film producer said they wanted to make clear Tamil Nadu press reports which could have been picked up by local dailies in Malaysia and has worried “Prashanth's fan base”.\n\nThe actor's wife, Grihalakshmi reportedly left him two months after their marriage in September last year. Later she delivered a child, whom the star claimed he had still not seen.\n\n\"I am very very eager to see my child. I was not invited to the seemantham ceremony (a ritual before the child is born), nor told about the birth or invited to the naming ceremony where tradition demands that the infant's father is present,\" Prashanth was quoted by PTI as saying.\n\nHe also claimed that he could not see his child despite filing a petition.\n\nThe actor's father refuted media reports that his son had taken a dowry of Rs 3.5 crore for constructing a mall in Chennai.\n\nMeanwhile, a Malaysian event organiser claimed that the Thiagarajans owed him some money for organising a show for them.\n\n\"The way they ruined my life and did not give me the 350,000 ringet they owed me, I am not surprised Prashanth's life too has been touched by worries,\" the organiser said.\n\nPrashanth has acted in several Tamil blockbusters and has a huge fan following in Malaysia where most of the ethnic Indians are from Tamil Nadu."
