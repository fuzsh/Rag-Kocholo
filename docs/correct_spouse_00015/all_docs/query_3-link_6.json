        "text": "On Monday, the Madras High Court upheld a family court's order annulling Prashanth Thyagarajan and Grihalakshmi's marriage, on the grounds that Grihalakshmi suppressed the fact that she was married earlier.\n\nPrashanth and Grihalakshmi tied the knot on Septemner 1, 2005. Their son was born on July 31, 2006. Due to domestic disputes, the relations between the two families turned sour after Grihalakshmi left for her maternal home.\n\nPrashanth moved to the family court seeking reunion with his wife and restitution of conjugal rights. While the matter was still pending, Grihalakshmi lodged a dowry harassment complaint against Prashanth.\n\nHowever, on June 11, 2007, Prashanth learnt that Grihalakshmi was married already to Natayan Venu Prasad in 1998 and their marriage was registered on December 31, 1998. Suppression of earlier marriage and non-disclosure amounted to fraud, on the grounds of which Prashanth sought divorce. Grihalakshmi, however, denied the claim and charged Prashanth and Venu Prasad of colluding with each other.\n\nOn the basis of a marriage certificate, issued by a joint registrar of marriage, the family court granted divorce in April 2009. However, Grihalakshmi moved to the High Court against the order."
