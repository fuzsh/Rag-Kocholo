        "text": "Repelling liquid drops from engineering surfaces has attracted great attention in a variety of applications. To achieve efficient liquid shedding, delicate surface textures are often introduced to sustain air pockets at the liquid–solid interface. However, those surfaces are prone to suffer from mechanical failure, which may bring reliability issues and thus limits their applications. Here, inspired by the aerodynamic Leidenfrost effect, we present that impacting drops are directionally repelled from smooth surfaces supplied with an exogenous air layer. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the synchronized nonwetting and oblique bouncing behavior is attributed to the aerodynamic force arising from the air layer. The versatility and practicability of our approach allow for drop repellency without the aid of any surface wettability treatment and also avoid the consideration of mechanical stability issues, which thereby provides a promising candidate for the applications that necessitate liquid shedding, e.g., resolve the problem of tiny raindrop adhesion on the automobile side window during driving.\n\nThe combination of pavement rutting, poor road alignment, and extreme adverse weather will seriously threaten the driving safety of vehicles, whereas only a few of these factors are commonly concerned. This study aims to efficiently evaluate the impacts of various driving conditions on the lateral stability of the vehicle and produce a practical recommendation for pavement maintenance in what concerns rutting. A systematic framework was, thus, developed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the lateral stability of the vehicle, which incorporates a single-factor test and multi-factor test based on the stability indicators obtained from Carsim simulations. The vehicle road weather model was established in the Carsim software by considering seven factors, including driving speed, width–height ratio (WHR) of rutting sidewall, radius of circular curve, superelevation, crosswind angle, crosswind speed, and friction coefficient, respectively. The results show that the established framework behaves with satisfactory performance, regarding evaluating the effect of various impact factors on the lateral stability of the vehicle while driving across rutting. Stability indicators suddenly fluctuate in a short time, due to the instantaneous wandering behavior of crossing rutting. Additionally, the sudden fluctuation phenomenon is greatly enlarged, and the vehicle is inclined to occur with lateral instability when WHR equals 5, particularly in roll-over instability. It is recommended to concurrently confine the WHR greater than 10 and friction coefficient greater than 0.4, in order to ensuring driving stability. The multi-factor test revealed that the vehicle speed and WHR of the rutting are leading factors that affect driving stability, followed by the radius of circular curve, superelevation, crosswind angle, crosswind speed and friction coefficient, respectively, which are both essential factors for driving stability. The outcomes of this study may contribute to supplying guidelines for controlling key adverse conditions and making decisions on pavement maintenance.\n\nThis study focuses on the analysis of place attachment related to the elements of territorial identity in Oraviţa, a small town in the Mountainous Banat. Oraviţa played a highly significant role from an economic and administrative point of view during the Austrian domination: it was the urban centre that coordinated the mining activity on the territory of Mountainous Banat. This study aims to assess the place attachment to several symbolic buildings in Oraviţa that have been identified as elements of territorial identity. In order to fulfil the purpose of this study, the following research questions were established: What are the main elements of territorial identity in Oraviţa represented in postcards over time? Which of the identified elements of territorial identity are currently being promoted and valued by the local public administration? What are the elements of territorial identity of Oraviţa to which the population is attached? From a methodological point of view, the authors used postcards to identify the elements of territorial identity. Subsequently, the place attachment to the representative historical buildings of Oraviţa was interpreted based on the analysis of the information posted on sites developed by members of the local community. In conclusion, the authors highlighted the particular characteristics of the urban fabric of Oraviţa and their various ways of use, elements through which the physical and social attachment of the local population were preserved.\n\nPolice records, kept in the form of yearbooks, enabled analysis of the possible relationships between traffic accidents and the weather in the Czech Republic for the 1979–2020 period. These data were used to create annual series of traffic accidents in general, accidents with only material damage, numbers of people injured (seriously and slightly) and fatalities. Seven weather categories were used to characterise the weather at the time of an accident. The categories “rain”, “onset of rain and light rain”, “snowfall” and “glaze ice and rime” proved the most important, contributing to the highest numbers of accidents, fatalities and injured. Less important were “fog”, “gusty wind” and “other inclement weather”. The influence of the relative annual proportions of all weather categories on the numbers of all accident characteristics fluctuated generally between 10 and 30%. Annual numbers of accidents, fatalities and injured attributed to individual weather categories were statistically significant when correlated with series of annual numbers of days with fog, rain, snowfall, glaze ice and gusty wind. The closest relationship emerged for snowfall, with correlation coefficients between 0.76 and 0.94. The annual numbers of accidents, fatalities and injured attributed to several of the weather categories tended to decrease, especially in the two most recent decades. The discussion section concentrates on the broader context of the results obtained.\n\nAs a significant detriment to physical and mental health, millions of motor vehicle crashes occur in the United States each year, with approximately 23% of these crashes linked to adverse weather conditions. This study builds upon a strong knowledge base to provide a deeper understanding of how rainfall intensity influences relative crash risk. Gridded precipitation and temperature data were aggregated to the county level and analyzed alongside motor vehicle crash data for all 146 counties in the Carolinas (North Carolina and South Carolina) for the period 2003–19. A matched-pair analysis routine linked unique time steps of rainfall (daily, 6-h, and hourly) to corresponding dry periods to evaluate relative crash risk across each state. Risk estimates were calculated on the basis of precipitation thresholds (light, moderate, heavy, and very heavy). Results indicate a statistically significant increase in crash risk during periods of rainfall in the Carolinas. As a baseline, the relative risk of experiencing a crash increases by 11.6% during days with accumulating rainfall and as much as 81.0% during heavy rainfall events over a 6-h period. In general, estimates of risk increase relative to the intensity of the rainfall event and the temporal delineation of the matched-pair routine. However, these relationships have unique spatiotemporal patterns indicating that, although hourly risk estimates may be beneficial for urban counties, daily relative risk estimates may be the only way to accurately capture risk in rural areas. Significance Statement Each year, more than 1 000 000 motor vehicle crashes in the United States are linked to adverse weather conditions in police reports, with rainfall events being among the largest contributors to increased crash risk. In this study, crash frequencies are evaluated to better understand how the intensity of rainfall events (light vs heavy) influences the risk of experiencing a collision on roadways in North Carolina and South Carolina. The results of statistical analyses revealed that risk increases significantly during rainfall events in both states and that the risk of experiencing a crash is highest during the heaviest rainfall events. However, even during light precipitation events, the risk of experiencing a crash is significantly higher than when driving during dry conditions. These results are helpful to transportation stakeholders and emergency responders in the hope of reducing crash risk in our changing climate.\n\nRoad accidents have become more common these days and it is pathetic when the accidents happen due to ignorance. The research objective is focused on university students, creating awareness about road safety and improving a sustainable traffic management scenario in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. An analytical hierarchy process and a logistic regression model were used to determine the risk priorities ranking of severity factors based on the comparisons of different driver behaviour factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 3200 university students in Saudi Arabia to evaluate the risk associated with accident factors. The main factors taken for risk analysis were Stability during driving, not adhering to rules, committing human errors, Insufficient Visibility, Facing Vehicles Issues. The model estimation analysis revealed the severity, which was based on the student's behavioural factors as a driver which contributed to the high fatality. It is further proposed to teach an interdisciplinary course on Traffic Management to various university students. The awareness towards traffic sense and safety rules would bring down the accidents rates and help the government to maintain smooth traffic density.\n\nFlooding is one of the main weather-related disasters that cause numerous fatalities every year across the globe. This study examines flood fatalities reported in the contiguous United States (US) from 1959 to 2019. The last two decades witnessed major flood events, changing the ranking of the top states compared to previous studies, with the exception of Texas, which had significantly higher flood-related fatalities than any other state. The rankings of counties within some states changed as well. The study aims to improve understanding of the situational conditions, demographics, and spatial and temporal characteristics associated with flood fatalities. The analysis reveals that flash flooding is associated with more fatalities than other flood types. In general, males are much more likely to be killed in floods than females. The analysis also suggests that people in the age groups of 10–19, 20–29, and 0–9 are the most vulnerable to flood hazard. Purposely driving or walking into floodwaters accounts for more than 86% of total flood fatalities. Thus, the vast majority of flood fatalities are preventable. The results will help identify the risk factors associated with different types of flooding and the vulnerability of the exposed communities.\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of fatalities attributable to weather conditions in the Czech Republic during the 2000–2019 period. The database of fatalities deployed contains information extracted from Právo, a leading daily newspaper, and Novinky.cz, its internet equivalent, supplemented by a number of other documentary sources. The analysis is performed for floods, windstorms, convective storms, rain, snow, glaze ice, frost, heat, and fog. For each of them, the associated fatalities are investigated in terms of annual frequencies, trends, annual variation, spatial distribution, cause, type, place, and time as well as the sex, age, and behaviour of casualties. There were 1164 weather-related fatalities during the 2000–2019 study period, exhibiting a statistically significant falling trend. Those attributable to frost (31 %) predominated, followed by glaze ice, rain, and snow. Fatalities were at their maximum in January and December and at their minimum in April and September. Fatalities arising out of vehicle accidents (48 %) predominated in terms of structure, followed by freezing or hypothermia (30 %). Most deaths occurred during the night. Adults (65 %) and males (72 %) accounted for the majority of fatalities, while indirect fatalities were more frequent than direct ones (55 % to 45 %). Hazardous behaviour accounted for 76 %. According to the database of the Czech Statistical Office, deaths caused by exposure to excessive natural cold are markedly predominant among five selected groups of weather-related fatalities, and their numbers exhibit a statistically significant rise during 2000–2019. Police yearbooks of the fatalities arising out of vehicle accidents indicate significantly decreasing trends in the frequency of inclement weather patterns associated with fatal accidents as well as a decrease in their percentage in annual numbers of fatalities. The discussion of results includes the problems of data uncertainty, comparison of different data sources, and the broader context."
