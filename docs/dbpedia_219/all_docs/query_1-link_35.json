        "text": "Israeli occupation forces (IOF) launched extensive raids across the occupied West Bank early Wednesday, igniting fierce confrontations with Palestinian Resistance groups determined to defend their own cities. The clashes resulted in injuries and fatalities, with reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent indicating that an individual was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Beit Furik, south of Nablus.\n\nAl-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for intense confrontation with the IOF in Nablus’s Old City, asserting that their fighters engaged in heavy gunfire directed at occupation forces near the eastern compound.\n\nIOF stormed Balata camp in Nablus and targeted the Fatah movement’s headquarters.\n\nIsraeli occupation forces also stormed the city of Dura south of al-Khalil, the town of Dar Salah in Beit Lahem, and the Qalandiya refugee camp in occupied al-Quds, detaining Palestinians.\n\nThe situation has escalated over the past few days, with the Palestinian Health Ministry reporting the deaths of 21 Palestinians across the West Bank since Saturday.\n\nThis period has seen particularly violent confrontations in Jenin, where drone strikes and ground assaults by the IOF resulted in multiple casualties, including a child and several young men in Tubas.\n\nResistance factions, including the al-Qassam Brigades and the Mujahideen Brigades, have vowed to confront the IOF with considerable force. During a 20-hour siege in Jenin, these groups reportedly utilized firearms and improvised explosive devices against Israeli military vehicles, marking some of the fiercest fighting of the year."
