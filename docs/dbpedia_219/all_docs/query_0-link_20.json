The new proposed classification, using stages, recognizes AF as a disease continuum that requires a variety of strategies at the different stages, from prevention, lifestyle and risk factor modification, screening, and therapy.\n\n2.\n\nAF risk factor modification and prevention: This guideline recognizes lifestyle and risk factor modification as a pillar of AF management to prevent onset, progression, and adverse outcomes. The guideline emphasizes risk factor management throughout the disease continuum and offers more prescriptive recommendations, accordingly, including management of obesity, weight loss, physical activity, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, hypertension, and other comorbidities.\n\n3.\n\nFlexibility in using clinical risk scores and expanding beyond CHA2DS2-VASc for prediction of stroke and systemic embolism: Recommendations for anticoagulation are now made based on yearly thromboembolic event risk using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc. However, patients at an intermediate annual risk score who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation can benefit from consideration of other risk variables to help inform the decision, or the use of other clinical risk scores to improve prediction, facilitate shared decision making, and incorporate into the electronic medical record.\n\n4.\n\nConsideration of stroke risk modifiers: Patients with AF at intermediate to low (<2%) annual risk of ischemic stroke can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke, such as the characteristics of their AF (eg, burden), nonmodifiable risk factors (sex), and other dynamic or modifiable factors (blood pressure control) that may inform shared decision-making discussions.\n\n5.\n\nEarly rhythm control: With the emergence of new and consistent evidence, this guideline emphasizes the importance of early and continued management of patients with AF that should focus on maintaining sinus rhythm and minimizing AF burden.\n\n6.\n\nCatheter ablation of AF receives a Class 1 indication as first-line therapy in selected patients: Recent randomized studies have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over drug therapy for rhythm control in appropriately selected patients. In view of the most recent evidence, we upgraded the Class of Recommendation.\n\n7.\n\nCatheter ablation of AF in appropriate patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction receives a Class 1 indication: Recent randomized studies have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over drug therapy for rhythm control in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection failure. In view of the data, we upgraded the Class of Recommendation for this population of patients.\n\n8.\n\nRecommendations have been updated for device-detected AF: In view of recent studies, more prescriptive recommendations are provided for patients with device-detected AF that consider the interaction between episode duration and the patient's underlying risk for thromboembolism. This includes considerations for patients with AF detected via implantable devices and wearables.\n\n9.\n\nLeft atrial appendage occlusion devices receive higher level Class of Recommendation: In view of additional data on safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion devices, the Class of Recommendation has been upgraded to 2a compared with the 2019 AF Focused Update for use of these devices in patients with long-term contraindications to anticoagulation.\n\n10.\n\nRecommendations are made for patients with AF identified during medical illness or surgery (precipitants): Emphasis is made on the risk of recurrent AF after AF is discovered during noncardiac illness or other precipitants, such as surgery.\n\nPreamble\n\nSince 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are the official policy of the ACC and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA collaborate with other organizations.\n\nIntended Use\n\nClinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.\n\nClinical Implementation\n\nManagement, in accordance with guideline recommendations, is effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities.\n\nMethodology and Modernization\n\nThe ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, updates, and modifies guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from organizations, including the Institute of Medicine,1,2 and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified in response to evolving technologies and other factors to optimally facilitate dissemination of information to health care professionals at the point of care.\n\nNumerous modifications to the guidelines have been implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular, “knowledge chunk” format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text and, when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of cost–value considerations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of value for a drug, device, or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology.3\n\nTo ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the writing committee and staff. Going forward, targeted sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically after publication and timely peer review of potentially practice-changing science. The previous designations of “full revision” and “focused update” will be phased out. For additional information and policies on guideline development, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual4 and other methodology articles.5-7\n\nSelection of Writing Committee Members\n\nThe Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee contains requisite content expertise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular community by selection of experts across a spectrum of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and clinical practice settings. Organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators.\n\nRelationships With Industry and Other Entities\n\nThe ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee members’ comprehensive and relevant RWI; for the purposes of full transparency, comprehensive and relevant disclosure information for the Joint Committee is also available online.\n\nEvidence Review and Evidence Review Committees\n\nIn developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data.4,5 Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only key references are cited.\n\nAn independent evidence review committee is commissioned when there are ≥1 questions deemed of utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic review to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence review committee and formal systematic review include absence of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial number of patients, and likelihood that the findings can be translated into actionable recommendations. Evidence review committee members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians. Recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked “SR”.\n\nGuideline-Directed Management and Therapy\n\nThe term guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States.\n\nJoshua A. Beckman, MD, MS, FAHA, FACC\n\nChair, ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Methodology and Evidence Review\n\nThe recommendations listed in this guideline are, whenever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted from May 2022 to November 2022. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: atrial fibrillation; pregnancy; heart defects, congenital; smoking; cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic; alcohol; caffeine; sleep; diet; fitness; obesity; anticoagulants; diabetes; rhythm monitoring; heart failure; genetics; heart valve diseases; rate control; catheter ablation; social determinants of health; chronic kidney disease; sinus rhythm; chronic coronary syndromes; left atrial appendage occlusion; left atrial appendage exclusion; cardiac surgical procedures; amiodarone; electrical cardioversion; thromboembolism; rhythm control; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables are included in the Online Data Supplement and summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. References selected and published in the present document are representative and not all-inclusive.\n\n1.2 Organization of the Writing Committee\n\nThe writing committee consisted of cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and patient representatives/lay stakeholders. The writing committee included representatives from the ACC and AHA, ACCP, and HRS. Appendix 1 of the current document lists writing committee members’ comprehensive and relevant RWI.\n\n1.3 Document Review and Approval\n\nThe Joint Committee appointed a peer review committee to review the document. The peer review committee comprised individuals nominated by the ACC, AHA, and the collaborating organizations. Reviewers’ RWI information was distributed to the writing committee and is published in this document (Appendix 2).\n\nThis document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and was endorsed by ACCP and HRS.\n\n1.4 Scope of the Guideline\n\nIn developing the “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation” (2023 atrial fibrillation guideline), the writing committee reviewed previously published guidelines.

The estimated global prevalence was 50 million in 2020.2,3 Although the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the community is unknown, using back-calculation methodology, investigators have estimated that, in 2015, about 11% (591,000 cases) of the >5.6 million AF cases in the United States were undiagnosed.4\n\nAF is associated with higher health care utilization and costs.2 Using US data from Optum (an administrative claims database for commercially insured [United Healthcare] patients in the United States), compared with patients without AF, patients with incident AF had an increased risk of inpatient visits and more cardiovascular-related emergency department visits (relative risk [RR], 2.41 [95% CI, 2.35–2.47]).5 AF is costly. Examining Optum data, individuals with AF have annual health care costs of $63,031, which is $27,896 more than individuals without AF.5 Investigators examining public and private health insurer data estimated that in U.S. dollars in 2016, AF accounted for $28.4 billion (95% CI, $24.6 billion–$33.8 billion) in health care spending.6\n\n2.1.1 Prevalence, Incidence, Morbidity, and Mortality\n\nAF prevalence in the United States was estimated to be 5.2 million in 2010, with an expectation to rise to 12.1 million in 2030.1 Corresponding estimates for U.S. incidence was 1.2 million cases in 2010, with an expectation to rise to 2.6 million cases in 2030.1 The rate of AF diagnosis varies by education, income,2 clinical,3,4 and genetic3 factors. Overall lifetime risk is about 30% to 40% in White individuals,2-4 about 20% in African American individuals,2 and about 15% in Chinese5 individuals.\n\nAF is associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of death6,7; studies suggest that the mortality risk may be higher in women than in men.6 In meta-analyses, AF is also associated with increased risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including a 2.4-fold risk of stroke,7 1.5-fold risk of cognitive impairment or dementia,8 1.5-fold risk of myocardial infarction (MI),9 2-fold risk of sudden cardiac death,10 5-fold risk of heart failure (HF),7 1.6-fold risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD),7 and 1.3-fold risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD).7 In Medicare beneficiaries, the most frequent outcome in the 5 years after AF diagnosis was death (19.5% at 1 year; 48.8% at 5 years)11; the next most common diagnosis was HF (13.7%), followed by new-onset stroke (7.1%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (5.7%), and MI (3.9%).11\n\n2.1.2 Risk Factors and Associated Heart Disease\n\nIn Table 3, we present the evidence for the most widely reported and validated factors for AF from single studies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization studies. Risk factors include demographic, anthropometric, and cardiovascular risk factors, CVD, noncardiac conditions, biomarkers (eg, electrocardiographic, imaging, circulating), and genetic markers.1 Models predicting risk of AF onset are presented in Section 4.1 (“Risk Stratification and Population Screening”). Most studies of AF risk factors and outcomes have been reported from high-income countries and in individuals of European ancestry.\n\n2.2 Atrial Arrhythmia Classification and Definitions\n\n2.2.1 AF Classification\n\nThe previous classification of AF, which was based only on arrhythmia duration, although useful, tended to emphasize AF once it was diagnosed and focused mainly on therapeutic interventions. The new proposed classification using stages aims to correct the deficiencies of the previous classification by recognizing AF as a progressive disease that requires different strategies at the different stages, from prevention to screening, to rate and rhythm control therapies. The different stages better define AF as a progressive disease and highlight the need to address it at the earliest stages, especially emphasizing the importance of prevention, risk factor management, and timing for screening in those patients at the highest risk. The stages are not mutually exclusive (eg, risk factors should be managed through multiple stages) (Figure 4).\n\nAF is the most common arrhythmia in the world and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, evidence has consistently shown that the best treatment of atrial fibrillation requires multiple stakeholders committed to providing comprehensive patient-centered care. In addition, as emphasized in this guideline, AF should be thought of in a more holistic sense over an individual patient’s lifetime.\n\nThe foundation of optimal AF management is the treatment of risk factors and implementing lifestyle changes to decrease the likelihood of developing AF (Figure 5). Once AF develops, patient care should focus on assessing the risk of stroke and implementing any necessary treatment, continued optimization of all modifiable risk factors, and managing potential symptoms of AF, with an initial focus on evaluating and minimizing AF burden. However, as outlined in this guideline, access to all aspects of health care to all patients is necessary for any true improvement to be realized.\n\nWhen AF develops, holistic and optimal care of the patient at risk for AF, or who has developed AF, can be simply modeled using a building. The foundation of care is treatment of comorbidities and risk factors and implementing behavioral change in all individuals to decrease the likelihood of developing AF and reducing its burden (Screening for all risk factors from HEAD 2 TOES). Once AF develops, there are 3 important care processes that must be specifically addressed with all patients and aligned with their goals of therapy: Stroke risk assessment and treatment, if appropriate, Optimizing all modifiable risk factors, and Symptom management using rate- and rhythm-control strategies that consider AF burden in the context of an individual patient’s needs (SOS). The overarching principle for AF management is Access to All Aspects of care to All (4 As).\n\n2.2.2 Associated Arrhythmias\n\nOther atrial arrhythmias are often encountered in patients with AF.\n\nAtrial Tachycardia (AT): It is a regular atrial rhythm at a constant rate of >100 beats per minute (bpm) with discrete P waves and atrial activation sequences originating outside of the sinus node.1 The mechanism can be automaticity, triggered activity, or a microreentry circuit. Focal ATs arise from a single discrete site within the left or right atrium, in contrast to macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias and AF, which involve multiple sites or larger circuits. In multifocal AT, the atrial activation sequence and P-wave morphology vary.\n\nAtrial Flutter (AFL) and Macroreentrant AT: They occur in many of the same situations as AF. Typical AFL, also known as “typical AFL” or “cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent AFL,”2 involves a macroreentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus traversing the CTI on the right side of the heart (Figure 6). This is the arrhythmia associated with the classic electrocardiogram (ECG) finding of sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads when the circuit goes in the counterclockwise direction. The same circuit in the clockwise direction is called “reverse typical AFL.” If the flutter involves a different circuit than tricuspid valve/isthmus, then it is called “atypical” AFL, which is also known as “noncavotricuspid isthmus–dependent macroreentrant AT.”2 AFL was previously classified as either type I or type II. That terminology is no longer used.\n\n2.3 Mechanisms and Pathophysiology\n\nAF is a chaotic, rapid (300-500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. Although normal rhythms are conducted through the atria in smooth waves initiated by the sinoatrial node, AF is the result of either electrophysiological abnormalities that underlie impulse generation and/or structural abnormalities of cellular connections that typically facilitate rapid and uniform impulse conduction. AF often stems from waves of electrical activity originating from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA),1 or in response to reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis.2 Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or conduction that is sufficiently heterogeneous to enable reentrant activity to persist. The electrical abnormalities evident on the ECG during AF likely represent a shared phenotype of a condition with many distinct etiologies (genetic, environmental, and metabolic) (Figure 7).\n\n2.3.1 Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Electrical Remodeling\n\nThe observation by Haissaguerre et al1 that ectopic firing from PVs triggers AF revolutionized treatments for AF. PV features that increase vulnerability for initiating ectopy include a higher resting membrane potential, stretch-activated channels,2 and pattern of cross myofiber orientation.\n\nElectrical remodeling, which can contribute to and result from AF, includes perturbations that culminate in abnormal Ca2+ handling and shortened, proarrhythmic triangulated action potentials (eg, from decreased L-type Ca2+ current3 and increase in IK1).4 Heterogeneity in IK1 between left and right atria further promotes arrhythmogenicity.5 Downregulation of connexin results in decreased gap junctions, leading to slow heterogeneous atrial conduction velocity and repolarization,6 promoting regional functional conduction block that can support reentry. Connexin remodeling can be due to genetic7 or acquired factors, such as inflammatory state,8,9 older age, or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).10\n\nCalcium mishandling from remodeling increases calcium load in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and dysfunction of ryanodine receptors, which regulate intracellular calcium release. Remodeling in AF of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase underlies sequestration of intracellular calcium between beats, and/or altered regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase by phospholamban and sarcolipin.11 Increased intracellular sodium from calcium-calmodulin II-induced increased late sodium current or cardiac glycosides can also increase sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium through the sodium-calcium exchanger.12,13 Several upstream mechanisms (eg, oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling) promote calcium-calmodulin II -activation. CaMKII-mediated and hyperphosphorylation of ryanodine receptor 2 promotes spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ leak by increasing ryanodine receptor 2 channel open probability, leading to higher intracellular Ca2+ levels and the milieu for delayed afterdepolarizations, the most likely trigger for AF initiation.14 Electrogenic action of sodium-calcium exchanger drives afterdepolarizations, and expression of sodium-calcium exchanger is increased in HF and AF. Action potential alternans related to Ca2+ mishandling can be noted to precede AF onset and increases with age.\n\n2.3.1.1 Triggers of AF\n\nThe atria of patients with AF tend to have both shorter effective refractory periods and slower conduction, which enhances dispersion of repolarization and favor reentry. This substrate is sensitive to AF initiation, frequently after premature atrial contractions (PACs).1 PAC burden is associated with development of AF.2 Larger LA volume, increased NT-proBNP levels, and impaired LA emptying are associated with increased PAC burden.3 In a study of 100 patients undergoing PV isolation, PACs induced 41 episodes of AF in 22 patients, with most episodes originating in the PVs.4 Earlier studies also reported an LA gradient of background potassium currents, resulting in shorter LA than right atrial effective refractory period in patients with AF.5 Mapping studies of AF electrograms in canine models documented a left-right gradient of high frequency sources (drivers), with the highest frequency regions located near the PVs in the LA.6\n\n2.3.2 Atrial Structural Abnormalities, Remodeling, and Atrial Myopathy\n\nAtrial cardiomyopathy has been identified as “any complex of structural, architectural, contractile or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria with the potential to produce clinically relevant manifestations.”1 Atrial cardiomyopathy is common, associated with aging and other comorbidities with metabolic or hemodynamic stress, and often leads to or results from AF. Structural and electrical remodeling promote AF and include interstitial changes, increased myofibroblast activity, and collagen deposition, fibrofatty deposits, altered ion channel expression, calcium signaling and contractility, and inflammatory infiltrates.1 Myeloperoxidase, an oxidase in neutrophils and macrophages, is associated with fibroblast activation, interstitial fibrosis, and inducibility of AF in a mouse model.2 Prothrombotic changes are often evident in the LA, including increased endocardial expression of von Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 changes, which may increase risk of thrombus formation and stroke.1\n\nExperimental hemodynamic overload, such as reversible aortopulmonary artery shunting promotes atrial dilation, atrial myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, alterations in extracellular matrix composition and vascular dysfunction, and increased vulnerability to atrial ectopy and AF inducibility.3 Electrical remodeling similar to that seen during AF is observed, with characteristic loss of calcium currents. Shunt closure reverses electrophysiological changes.3 Clinically, the hemodynamic structural changes are difficult or impossible to reverse.\n\n2.3.2.1 Upstream Pathways\n\nUpstream pathways include inflammatory, oxidative stress, fibrosis, calcium handling, genetic, metabolic, obesity, and other mechanisms implicated in increasing susceptibility to or progression of AF. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and calcium overload are discussed here and in Section 2.3.1 (“Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Electrical Remodeling”). Upstream therapies are discussed in Section 8.3.4 (“Upstream Therapy”).\n\nThe RAAS regulates blood pressure (BP) and is activated in hypertension and obesity. RAAS activation promotes vascular smooth muscle constriction (increasing BP), activates fibroblasts (increasing atrial interstitial collagen), and increases reactive oxygen species in the sympathetic nervous system. BP and weight control, including treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers, attenuate pathologic changes.\n\nOxidative stress is associated with: (1) activation of calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II1,2 and jun kinase 2,3 which promotes ryanodine receptor phosphorylation and leads to spontaneous calcium release4; (2) increased late sodium current, INa,L, and lower calcium current amplitude; (3) formation of reactive lipid products (isolevuglandins) in hypertension5 and AF6; (4) activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B and the NLRP3 inflammasome7; (5) increase in mitochondrial and metabolic stress; (6) inflammatory changes; and (7) myofilament protein degradation, impairing atrial contractility, which may increase thromboembolism risk.8\n\nSystemic inflammatory activation, first documented with AF after cardiac surgery,9 has also been associated with nonsurgical AF.10 NLRP3 knockdown prevented AF inducibility in a mouse model, implicating the NLRP3 inflammasome in AF pathophysiology.11 NLRP3-blocking drugs are in development.\n\n2.3.2.2 Persistence of AF\n\nIn general, persistence of AF reflects the substrate for AF. A suitable substrate for AF has a wavelength (wavelength = refractory period × conduction velocity) that is shorter than the dimensions of the tissue, with heterogenous conduction velocity and/or repolarization duration. Thus, an individual with large, fibrotic, and/or fatty atria is more likely to have persistent AF than one with a normal-sized atria with little interstitial fibrosis or adipose infiltration. Electrophysiologic remodeling is typically a response to persistent AF rather than the trigger.\n\n2.3.3 Role of the Autonomic Nervous System\n\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) has an important role as trigger and substrate (Figure 8).\n\nANS triggers AF\n\nThe ANS as AF trigger is detailed in several reviews.1-6 Sympathetic efferent stimulation releases noradrenaline, stimulating G-coupled β-adrenergic receptors, enhancing L-type calcium channels, and increasing inward current (automaticity/early afterdepolarization). Delayed afterdepolarization occurs via calcium overload and ryanodine-2 receptor dysfunction. Parasympathetic stimulation shortens atrial effective refractory period by increasing IKACh (acetyl-choline receptor mediated inward rectifying potassium channel) activity. Atrial effective refractory period heterogeneity follows the pattern of autonomic innervation. Sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, alone or combined, can trigger AF.\n\nANS maintains AF\n\nAtrial sympathetic and parasympathetic hyperinnervation and spatial heterogeneity, coupled with electrical fractionation and altered atrial electrophysiology, contribute to substrate.7-10 Modifiable AF risk factors promote ANS dysfunction.3 AF produces autonomic afferent reflex deficiencies elicited by decreased cardiac volume11,12 and increases sympathetic activity.13 Afferent abnormalities disrupt blood volume and pressure homeostasis. Similar abnormalities to AF were identified in HF.14 Afferent ANS dysfunction could link autonomic with anatomic remodeling (atrial dilatation15), contributing to AF self-perpetuation.\n\n2.4 Genetics\n\nBoth common forms and familial AF are heritable.1-3 Multiple recent genome-wide association studies have documented >100 loci specific for AF.4,5 Numerous AF loci appear consistent across multiethnic groups,5 with some population variation.6,7 With large genome-wide genotyped cohorts such as the UK Biobank and the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) Trans Omics for Precision Medicine, the genetic architecture of AF is now emerging. A UK Biobank study identified TTN loss of function variants in 0.44% of participants, 14% of whom had AF.8 In a Trans Omics for Precision Medicine study of nearly 1300 participants <66 years of age with AF, 10.1% harbored a disease-associated genetic variant in genes associated with inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndromes (most common were TTN, MYH7, MYH6, LMNA, and KCNQ1), and 62.8% had variants of undetermined significance. Disease-associated variants were more prevalent at younger age of AF onset, 16.8% in those <30 years.9 A smaller study of persons of Hispanic or African American descent reported 7% of persons with AF onset at ≤66 years of age harbored rare likely pathogenic or pathogenic sequence variants, mostly in myocardial structural proteins and ion channels.10\n\n2.5 Addressing Health Inequities and Barriers to AF Management\n\nRecommendation to Address Health Inequities and Barriers to AF Management\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nInequities in AF care and outcomes in individuals who are women, from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (UREGs),2 or who have adverse SDOH have been documented.3,4 Sex differences in AF treatment have been described with respect to anticoagulation6,7 and rhythm control therapy approaches.7-9 Racial and ethnic differences in clinical presentation, management, and prognosis, including stroke, HF, and death, in patients with AF are widely reported.2,10\n\nTo avoid guidelines having the unintended consequence of widening inequities in clinical care and outcomes in individuals with AF, it is essential to longitudinally measure the receipt of AF GDMT and outcomes at the clinical practice and health system levels stratified by specific populations who have historically experienced inequitable care. If inequities are identified, barriers to GDMT should be eliminated. Data are needed to assess the impact of addressing SDOH in patients with AF on process measures, health care utilization, costs, and clinical outcomes.11 In other health contexts, there are observational and randomized data12 that screening and addressing SDOH leads to improved medication adherence,13 risk factor control,14 and clinical outcomes.15\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nDespite the elevated risk of stroke in women and several UREGs, many are less likely to be treated with stroke risk reduction therapies.6,7 Although women and individuals from UREGs with AF are more symptomatic and report worse QOL than their counterparts, they also are less likely to be referred to an electrophysiologist7 and receive catheter ablation.2,7-9,16 Women are referred for ablation later in the disease course and at older ages than men.7,17,18 These differences or delays in therapy may result in worse outcome given early rhythm control of AF improves outcomes1,19 in select patients. In addition, in the Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drugs in AF trial, individuals from UREGs treated with catheter ablation had a 72% relative reduction in the all-cause mortality rate.20 Therefore, ensuring timely and equitable referral of women, individuals from UREG, and those with adverse SDOH for rhythm control therapy is important. In patients with AF, indicators of lower socioeconomic status were associated with lower oral anticoagulation rates,21 lower rate of adherence during direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) initiation,22 specialty care,21,23 and less use of cardioversion4,21 and catheter ablation.4,21,24 Indicators of socioeconomic disadvantages, such as increased risk of hospitalization,25 stroke,4,21 HF,4,21,26 and death, were also associated with complications in patients with AF.4,21,27\n\n3 Shared Decision-Making (SDM) in AF Management\n\nRecommendation for SDM in AF Management\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nThere are wide variations in how SDM is implemented in clinical care settings.5,6 Decision aids may provide standardization of SDM approaches for better informing patients about stroke reduction therapies and improve patient-reported measures but to date have not consistently been developed with recommended frameworks, have rarely been tested in systemically disadvantaged populations (low health literacy, UREGs, low socioeconomic status, rural geography, older adults), and have had variable impact on adherence and clinical outcomes.1-8 Ongoing work will measure health and digital literacy and strengthen the evidence for the impact of decision aids on decisional quality, adherence to treatment, and health outcomes.9\n\nSymptom severity strongly correlates with QOL; thus, minimizing symptoms is an essential component of patient-centered AF management decisions. Rhythm control strategies improve QOL, particularly when maintenance of sinus rhythm or low AF burden is achieved.10 Notably, few SDM decision aids are focused on rate or rhythm control treatment options, and few have measured QOL as an outcome.3,5\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nRecently, 2 comprehensive reviews of decision aids for stroke reduction therapies were conducted to determine the impact of these tools on patient-reported measures of decisional quality, while considering other important outcomes including oral anticoagulant (OAC) uptake, medication adherence, and the effect on bleeding and stroke.3,4 Most decision aids focused on patient- reported measures, and few underwent rigorous pilot testing or correlated the aid with clinical outcomes, such as stroke and bleeding. Decision aids consistently demonstrate improvements in patient knowledge. The pooled analysis by Song et al noted lower decisional conflict using decision aids and enhanced OAC uptake (risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]).4 Decision aids have historically shown marginal improvement in 3-month measures of adherence, and the 2 largest randomized trials to date showed no improvement in adherence between decision aids and usual care at 1 year.1,2 There is a paucity of data on the impact of decision aids on stroke, thromboembolic events, or bleeding, and when assessed the benefit has been minimal or neutral.4,11 Despite the US Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services coverage decision requirement for SDM for percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), only 1 tool was identified that incorporated this option (Table 5).5\n\n4 Clinical Evaluation\n\n4.1 Risk Stratification and Population Screening\n\nThere are >20 risk prediction models for incident AF in the community.1 The most widely replicated risk prediction model for newly diagnosed AF is CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology model for atrial fibrillation; Table 6),2 while the C2HEST score (coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1 point each]; hypertension [1 point]; elderly [age ≥75 years, 2 points]; systolic HF [2 points]; thyroid disease [hyperthyroidism, 1 point]) was derived and validated in Asian cohorts (Table 7).3,4\n\nScreening for AF has been investigated, mostly in patients >65 years of age, using various protocols that include both 1-time electrocardiographic recordings, recurring intermittent ECGs (including consumer-based devices), or continuous electrocardiographic external monitors. Most screening trials have shown higher AF detection using intermittent or continuous electrocardiographic recordings5 and higher AF detection in patients with higher predicted risk for AF.6 A recent study also showed that an AI algorithm able to risk-stratify a relatively uniform population (eg, older adults at risk for stroke) to detect undiagnosed AF during short-term cardiac monitoring was associated with increased AF.7 Conversely, mass population screening with a smartwatch app only rarely detected a new diagnosis of AF.8 Ultimately, for risk stratification models and screening programs to be useful, they would need to improve outcomes and be cost-effective.9 It is not yet established that patients at high risk of developing AF by a validated risk score benefit from screening and interventions to improve rates of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and survival.\n\n4.2 Basic Evaluation\n\n4.2.1 Basic Clinical Evaluation\n\nRecommendations for Basic Clinical Evaluation\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe initial clinical evaluation of the patient with newly diagnosed or suspected AF should be focused on confirming the diagnosis and identifying relevant clinical factors that will impact management. A targeted history and physical examination should be performed at the initial assessment and repeated during periodic follow-up, especially given the evolving risk of thromboembolism and the cadence of symptoms in response to therapy (see Section 11, “Future Research Needs”). An ECG can assess other electrical abnormalities, including possible substrates such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, coexisting atrial arrhythmias, as well as abnormalities that may affect decision-making in pharmacological management (eg, bradycardia, QT duration). Basic laboratory tests should be performed to determine if other clinically relevant disorders are present and impact on management, particularly with respect to stroke and bleeding risk. A transthoracic echocardiogram provides information on chamber size, thickness, function, and the presence of valvular pathology. Additional testing, including multimodality advanced imaging and further ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, may be pursued based on the results of these initial evaluations. AF itself does not increase the likelihood of myocardial ischemia, ACS or PE, and therefore routine testing for these disorders in the absence of signs or symptoms is of no benefit.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nA transthoracic echocardiogram is essential to evaluate chamber size and function, valve function, and right ventricular (RV) pressure. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) impacts decisions for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and whether to prioritize other rhythm control therapies, including catheter ablation. Additionally, strain imaging may suggest an underlying infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis.1 Echocardiography also provides information on LA size and function. Altered LA compliance is known to be associated with AF11 and progression toward persistent-type AF.2 In a meta-analysis, AF recurrence after ablation was associated with a lower LA strain,3 while LA volume was a stronger predictor of recurrence after ablation than the characterization of AF as paroxysmal or persistent.4 Laboratory testing can detect other medical conditions that are associated with AF and would impact therapeutic decision-making, such as CKD,5 liver dysfunction,6 and hyperthyroidism.7,12 Laboratory testing may also reveal electrolyte abnormalities, including from medications such as diuretics. Laboratory testing is also needed to determine stroke risk and bleeding risk factors, which will guide management decisions. When clinical suspicion exists, additional testing might be needed to evaluate for potentially related conditions, such as significant valvular disease.\n\n2.\n\nThe presence of AF itself should not prompt routine protocolized testing for myocardial ischemia, ACS, or PE, in the absence of signs or symptoms to suggest those diseases. A retrospective analysis of asymptomatic patients with AF compared with age- and sex-matched controls that were referred for myocardial stress imaging found no difference in mean summed stress score or rate of abnormal studies.8 A retrospective analysis of 1700 asymptomatic AF patients (no chest pain or dyspnea) found that 4.6% had >5% ischemic myocardium, and the yield to detect ischemia that resulted in revascularization was only 0.4%.9 Among patients suspected of PE, a retrospective analysis showed that the presence of AF did not increase the probability of PE.10 Certainly, this would not preclude from evaluating patients with signs and/or symptoms of ischemia and PE.\n\n4.2.2 Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods\n\nRecommendations for Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nMonitoring options for AF include a standard 12-lead ECG, continuously recording or loop-recording electrocardiographic monitors using separate electrodes or as patches, implantable cardiac monitors (sometimes referred to as implantable loop recorders), cardiac rhythm management devices with an atrial lead (eg, pacemakers and defibrillators), handheld ECGs, and smartwatches. Photoplethysmography has been used to infer AF from irregular pulse patterns using a variety of devices, predominately smartphone cameras14 and smartwatches.15-18 Electrocardiographic monitors often deploy automated algorithms for AF detection, but due to variable accuracy,1-5 the initial diagnosis should rely on a health care professional’s examination of the electrocardiographic tracing. Although photoplethysmography monitors may alert individuals to obtain an electrocardiographic tracing, it is not sufficiently reliable to establish an AF diagnosis.14-18 AF detected from an atrial lead has been validated versus surface ECGs6,7 and independently predicts stroke.8,9 RCTs have demonstrated that implantable cardiac monitors exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting AF compared with external ambulatory monitors, likely related to the longer duration of monitoring.10,11 Automated algorithms to analyze electrocardiographic devices have generally been found to be sufficiently reliable to infer the frequency, duration, and burden of AF among those with an AF diagnosis.1,4,5,12 A randomized trial showed that a handheld electrocardiographic monitor resulted in earlier detection of recurrent AF.13\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nAlthough automated algorithms in various devices are generally reliable, health care professional overread of electrocardiographic tracings remains necessary given the imperfect test characteristics of those algorithms.1-5 Similarly, while algorithms utilizing photoplethysmography signals (derived using smartphones or smartwatches) to infer irregular heart rates can discriminate AF from normal sinus rhythm, these are not sufficiently reliable to establish an AF diagnosis.14-18\n\n2.\n\nCardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead have been shown to detect AF validated against conventional surface electrocardiographic tracings.6-8 In addition, both the presence and duration of AF detected solely by these devices predict stroke in a manner that would be expected of AF.8,9 It is still essential that the intracardiac tracings are reviewed for confirmation because false-positives are possible. The duration of AF that mandates intervention with anticoagulation will be discussed in Section 6.4.1 (“Oral Anticoagulation for Device-Detected Atrial High-Rate Episodes Among Patients Without a Previous Diagnosis of AF”).\n\n3.\n\nThe more frequent and longer monitoring for AF is deployed, the greater the sensitivity in detecting AF.10,19 Randomized trials, predominately among cryptogenic stroke patients, have revealed that implantable cardiac monitors exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting AF in view of extended monitoring periods compared with external monitors.10,11\n\n4.\n\nIt is often not feasible to manually review all electrocardiographic strips from various monitoring devices, either due to inaccessibility or time and resource constraints on health care professionals. Although variability in accuracy across different devices may be present, the validity demonstrated in automated algorithms is generally sufficient to infer frequency, duration, and burden of AF using electrocardiographic devices such as continuously wearable monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead.1,4,5,12\n\n5.\n\nCardiac monitoring may be advised to AF patients for various reasons, such as for detecting recurrences, screening, or response to therapy. Among patients with AF who are undergoing cardioversion or AF ablation, a single-center, randomized trial demonstrated that use of a self-administered handheld ECG resulted in earlier detection of recurrent AF13 and possibly improvement in survey-determined AF-related QOL20 compared with usual care.\n\n5 Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modification (LRFM) for AF Management\n\n5.1 Primary Prevention\n\nRecommendation for Primary Prevention\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe clinical, family history, and genetic risk factors for AF are well established (Table 3), and risk prediction models (Section 4.1, “Risk Stratification and Population Screening”) for AF have been reported and replicated.7-9 Multiple reports have established that maintenance of optimal risk factors and ideal cardiovascular health are associated with substantially reduced risk of AF10,11 onset and complications (Section 5, “Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modification [LRFM] for AF Management”). To reduce risk of AF onset, individuals in the general population, particularly those at increased risk of AF, should receive comprehensive integrated LRFM, including maintenance of ideal weight and weight loss if overweight or obese1,12; pursue a physically active lifestyle,2 particularly if sedentary; receive smoking cessation counseling and/or medications4; moderate (≤1 standard alcoholic drink/day) or abstain from alcohol and avoidance of binge drinking3; control diabetes5; and control BP in accordance with GDMT.6,13 There is also an association of cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamine, or opiate use with increased incidence of AF.14\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nMost cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased risk of new-onset AF. Observational studies have demonstrated that obesity and physical inactivity each independently increase the risk of newly diagnosed AF.1,2,12,15-20 However, caution should be considered in pursuing years of regular, high-volume (≥3 h/day) high-intensity endurance training given observational data linking it with increased AF risk21-23 in men and similar “J” curve risk curve observed for high or vigorous activity in both men and women in another study.24 Alcohol consumption enhances the risk of AF in a fairly linear fashion, with clear evidence that binge drinking heightens the risk.3,25-29 Uncertainty persists regarding harms or benefits of no more than 1 regular drink per day.28,29 Self-reported,4 biomarker-verified,30 and genetically predicted31 smoking is associated with increased risk, and smoking cessation is associated with decreased risk of incident AF.4 The presence of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes increases AF risk,5,32 with evidence that worse glucose control correlates with a higher probability of developing AF.33 Hypertension is the risk factor with the highest attributable risk for AF10; intensive BP control lowers the risk of incident AF in observational and randomized data.6 Effective strategies to manage risk factors and prevent CVD have been reported elsewhere.12,13\n\n5.2 Secondary Prevention: Management of Comorbidities and Risk Factors\n\n5.2.1 Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese\n\nRecommendation for Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nObesity is associated with the development and progression of AF.5 It results in direct changes to the atrial myocardium forming the substrate for AF.6-8 In addition, obesity is also associated with several comorbidities that have been independently associated with the development of AF.9,10 Obesity has a significant adverse impact on attempts to maintain sinus rhythm, with each 5-unit increase in BMI being associated with a 10% and 13% greater risk of postoperative and postablation AF, respectively.5,11,12 Management of weight is important in the prevention and treatment of AF.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nIn an RCT in overweight and obese individuals with BMI >27 kg/m2 and AF, weight loss, as part of a comprehensive LRFM program, was associated with reduction in arrhythmia symptoms, recurrence, and burden.1 Observational studies demonstrated graded responses commensurate with the degree of weight loss, with achievement of at least 10% weight loss associated with greater maintenance of sinus rhythm,2 improved ablation outcomes,3 and reversal of AF type.4 In observational studies, bariatric surgery in Class III obese individuals (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) with AF was associated with improved sinus rhythm maintenance after catheter ablation13,14 and reversal of AF type.15 The greater number of risk factors managed associated with likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm.16 However, a small observational study in individuals with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) with long-lasting persistent AF observed no difference in symptoms or sinus rhythm maintenance despite significant weight loss, suggesting that there may be extreme substrates in which a weight loss strategy may not be effective.17\n\nStructured programs with regular review of progress facilitate achievement of weight loss and appear essential, as demonstrated by inability to reduce AF burden in a small RCT that achieved only 4.5% weight loss in the intervention arm.\n\n5.2.2 Physical Fitness\n\nRecommendation for Physical Fitness\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nRandomized trials provide evidence that prescribed aerobic exercise interventions may reduce arrhythmia burden in those with nonpermanent AF2 and improve functional capacity and health-related QOL in both permanent1,6 and nonpermanent AF.2 In the ACTIVE-AF (An Exercise and Physical Activity Program in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) study, an exercise intervention combining home and supervised aerobic exercise over 6 months resulted in greater freedom from arrhythmia recurrence, reduced burden, and improved QOL.3\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nIn patients with nonpermanent AF, aerobic exercise training may contribute to a reduction in AF burden and improve maintenance of sinus rhythm.2-5 Aerobic exercise interventions reduce severity of AF symptoms, increase functional capacity, and improve health-related QOL among patients with both nonpermanent and permanent AF.1,3,6 Initiation of or continuing regular exercise after development of AF was associated with a lower risk of HF and mortality in a population-based cohort study.7 Exercise training should be moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, with a target of 210 minutes per week, and should be prescribed to reduce the frequency and duration of AF episodes, while improving cardiorespiratory fitness and symptom severity.3 Exercise prescription may be further modified to patient comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.4 Caution should be applied to ensure adequate ventricular rate control during exercise training and absence of atrial myopathy related to excessive exercise training. To date, there is little evidence that high-intensity aerobic exercise may be favorable over moderate-intensity activities,8 and extreme levels of exercise have been associated with higher incidence of AF.9,10 Exercise training may be delivered as a stand-alone intervention or as a component of multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves QOL and functional capacity among patients with AF undergoing ablation,11,12 although available studies have not been adequately powered to assess AF-specific outcomes, such as arrhythmia recurrence.13 There is mixed evidence for a reduction in hospitalization or all-cause mortality with exercise training or exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.12,14,15\n\n5.2.3 Smoking Cessation\n\nRecommendation for Smoking Cessation\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nObservational data support that cigarette smoking in individuals with AF is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes and death and that individuals with AF who quit smoking are less likely to develop stroke or die. Despite the benefits of smoking cessation, individuals with AF are less likely to receive smoking cessation management than counterparts without AF.7,8 Patients with AF should be strongly advised to quit cigarette smoking9 and should receive GDMT for tobacco cessation, including behavioral interventions10,11 and pharmacotherapy.2\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nIn individuals with AF, cigarette smoking was associated with poorer outcomes. For individuals who have undergone AF catheter ablation, current cigarette smoking was associated with increased risk for AF recurrence.12,13 Cigarette smoking was associated with less time in therapeutic range for patients on warfarin.14 Although some heterogeneity exists, the preponderance of studies have reported that individuals with AF who smoked cigarettes had increased risks of stroke,3,4 HF,5 hospitalization,6 and death.6,15 Of concern, studies have reported that individuals with AF (versus those without) were less likely to receive smoking cessation interventions.7,8 Observational studies suggest that compared with current smokers, individuals with AF who quit smoking after AF diagnosis were less likely to experience CVD,3 stroke,3,16 and all-cause mortality.16\n\n5.2.4 Alcohol Consumption\n\nRecommendation for Alcohol Consumption\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nAmong patients with a diagnosis of AF, randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in AF burden on assignment to abstinence,1 that alcohol acutely changes human electrophysiology in a fashion that renders the atria more prone to fibrillate,2 and suggest that avoiding alcohol can reduce the risk of a near-term AF event.3\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nAmong patients with AF, a case-crossover study revealed a higher risk of a discrete AF episode hours after objectively confirmed alcohol consumption.4 In the context of a structured comprehensive management of risk factors, alcohol abstinence1 or reduction to ≤3 standard drinks per week has been demonstrated to reduce AF symptoms,5 AF burden,6,7 and progression of AF from paroxysmal to persistent.8\n\n5.2.5 Caffeine Consumption\n\nRecommendation for Caffeine Consumption\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nA randomized N-of-1 trial,2 as well as longitudinal, observational studies, have generally found that caffeine consumed within normal limits is either associated with no heightened risk3-6 or a reduced risk of incident AF.3,5,7-9 Patients often report caffeine as a trigger of AF,10 although this has not been supported by objective data.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nA randomized trial of caffeine failed to show any difference in postoperative AF risk,1 and paroxysmal AF patients experienced no detectable difference in AF episodes when exposing themselves to versus avoiding caffeine in randomized N-of-1 trials.2 Longitudinal, observational studies have generally found that caffeine consumed in usual amounts is either associated with no heightened risk3-6 or a reduced risk of incident AF.3,5,7-9Also, Mendelian randomization studies examining caffeine metabolism-related genetic variants as instrumental-variable surrogates of caffeine consumption have not shown either a harmful or protective effect related to incident AF.8,11 Several case reports have described a relationship between excessive consumption of caffeine (involving overdoses or highly caffeinated energy drinks)12,13 and AF in young, healthy individuals. Individuals should not begin or increase their caffeine consumption with the intent of reducing their AF risk.\n\nPatients often report that caffeine triggers their AF,10,14 although this has neither been supported by nor extensively studied in an objective manner. Current studies cannot exclude the possibility of individual-level idiosyncratic relationships between caffeine and AF. It is also possible that caffeine exacerbates symptoms of AF, or causes similar symptoms of palpitations, or enhances heart rhythm awareness.\n\n5.2.6 Diet and Dietary Supplementation\n\nPromoting a healthy diet is an effective strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The evidence pertaining to the prevention of AF using dietary supplements is inconsistent, complicated by substantial misclassification and difficulties controlling for potential confounding factors associated with dietary interventions.\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the role of omega-3 fatty acids and AF, demonstrating an inverse relationship between plasma omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and prevalent AF.1,2 However, with supplementation there has been no effect or a potential for greater AF.3-7 Although vitamin D supplementation is not useful on a population basis,8,9 its use in the perioperative period in deficient individuals reduces AF.10 Similarly, ascorbic acid has been beneficial in reducing postoperative AF in some studies, although not uniformly.11\n\nThe importance of weight management on AF symptoms, burden, and recurrence is increasingly recognized,12,13 leading to various dietary interventions. Although evidence on diets is still evolving, analyses of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study caution using low-carbohydrate diets, which were found to increase the risk of incident AF, regardless of the type of protein or fat used to replace carbohydrate.14\n\n5.2.7 Diabetes\n\nAF and diabetes are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and sudden death.1 In patients with diabetes, vascular mortality was lower in patients treated with DOACs compared with warfarin.2 In patients with AF and diabetes undergoing catheter ablation, optimal glycemic control preablation may lessen the risk of AF recurrence postablation.3\n\n5.2.8 Treatment of Hypertension\n\nRecommendation for the Treatment of Hypertension\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nRenal denervation and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been associated with decreased AF burden in clinical trials.1,2 The only randomized trial singularly targeting BP control as a mechanism to reduce the recurrence of AF8 showed no significant difference in the primary outcome of recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 months’ postablation among the 2 groups. However, clinical trials of integrated comprehensive LRFM programs in conjunction with rhythm control therapies for AF have resulted in longer arrhythmia-free survival and decreased AF burden.3,5,9 Among patients with AF, treating elevated BP to guideline-directed goals reduces major cardiovascular events.9\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nIn patients with AF, treatment of hypertension should aim for current BP guidelines to reduce stroke, bleeding, and other adverse outcomes.5,10 An RCT of patients with paroxysmal AF and hypertension noted fewer recurrences among participants treated with renal denervation and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) compared with PVI alone.2 Randomized studies of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for hypertension have been shown to reduce AF burden, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have been associated with lower AF incidence in secondary analyses of RCTs (see Section 8.3.4, “Upstream Therapy”). In addition, several integrated LRFM programs that have resulted in a decrease in BP have been associated with a decreased recurrence of AF.3,11\n\nThe SMAC (Substrate Modification With Aggressive Blood Pressure Control) AF trial randomized hypertensive patients scheduled for AF ablation to standard or aggressive BP treatment with a systolic BP target of 120 or 140 mm Hg.8 No significant difference was shown in recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 months postablation (median follow-up, 14 months), and this is the only RCT to date singularly targeting BP control as a mechanism to reduce AF recurrence.8 Post hoc analyses of DOAC clinical trials to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF have consistently found lower rates of stroke in patients with controlled BP.6,7\n\n5.2.9 Sleep\n\nRecommendation for Sleep\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendation\n\nSynopsis\n\nSDB is a risk factor for the development of incident AF, and more severe SDB acutely increases the risk of a discrete AF episode.14-18 Independent of SDB, poor sleep quality is associated with an increased risk of developing incident AF.19-21 When formal testing for SDB is used, the disease is frequently observed in >20% of patients with an AF diagnosis.1-5 Observational studies suggest that treatment of SDB may reduce the risk of AF recurrence and AF burden, but RCTs have not been adequately powered to reveal a relationship between treating SDB and reduced AF.6-13\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nThe prevalence of SDB is remarkably and consistently high in patients with AF (generally substantially >20% and sometimes >50% regardless of the type of AF population assessed), is often undetected, and, as conventional symptoms of SDB may be absent, may require formal study to establish a diagnosis of SDB.1-5,11 Multiple observational studies have described fewer recurrences of AF and a reduction in AF burden, including after cardioversion and catheter ablation procedures, among those undergoing treatment for SDB compared with those not treated for their SDB.6-11,22 However, small trials randomizing patients with AF and SDB treatment versus usual care have not shown significant differences in AF burden or AF recurrence, including after cardioversion or PVI ablation,12,13,22 although studies tended to exclude patients who might benefit most from SDB treatment (eg, those who had more symptomatic sleep apnea [Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >10 or 15], severe cardiovascular disease [LVEF <40% or 45%], or severe obesity).\n\n5.2.10 Comprehensive Care\n\nRecommendations for Comprehensive Care\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nAlmost all patients with AF have multiple conditions that either increase AF risk or are exacerbated by AF. Patients with AF are also at risk of developing thromboembolism, stroke, and HF, so a comprehensive approach tailored to the needs of the individual patient should improve outcomes. Randomized trials have shown that interventions aimed at AF risk factors, such as alcohol use, overweight, and HF, reduce AF burden. Clinical care pathways and algorithms for AF management, including LRFM, have shown promise in randomized trials through coordinating care and facilitating comprehensive AF management.\n\nAlthough comprehensive care of the multiple conditions associated with AF is logical, it is unclear whether integrated care by a multidisciplinary team leads to better outcomes than comprehensive care by a single clinician applying an evidence-based AF clinical care algorithm or pathway. Nevertheless, coordination of care among multiple clinicians should also improve care, even though it has not been evaluated rigorously.7\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nRandomized trials have shown the efficacy of many individual components of patient-centered care for AF, as discussed earlier in this section. Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have utilized comprehensive programs for patients with AF.2,8,9 The RACE 3 (Rate Control versus Electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation) trial3 found that multifaceted treatment for patients with AF and early HF (with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, statins, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and cardiac rehabilitation) improved maintenance of sinus rhythm.\n\n2.\n\nVarious clinical care pathways, algorithms, and electronic clinical decision support systems for the care of patients with AF have been tested in clinical trials, with mixed results. Care provided by specialty nurses using a clinical support system aimed at enhancing adherence to guideline-directed therapies improved cardiovascular outcomes in a single center study4 but not in the subsequent multicenter RACE 4 trial, where results were associated with experience of the center, although adherence to guideline-based recommendations was still greatly improved.10 In a cluster randomized trial of elderly patients with AF where integrated care intervention consisting of (a) quarterly AF check-ups by trained nurses in primary care, also focusing on comorbidities, (b) monitoring of anticoagulation therapy in primary care, and finally (c) easy-access availability of consultations from cardiologists and anticoagulation clinics, the patients assigned to integrated care experienced a 45% reduction in all-cause mortality when compared with usual care.11 In another study (SAFETY [Standard versus Atrial Fibrillation specific management study]), a posthospital discharge management program specific to AF was associated with proportionately more days alive and out of hospital but not prolonged event-free survival relative to standard management.12 On the other hand, data on technology-based clinical decision support systems are mixed, with a reduction in stroke and thromboembolism in the mAF-App 2 (Mobile Health Technology for Improved Screening and Optimized Integrated Care in Atrial Fibrillation) trial5 and improved anticoagulation use in the CDS-AF (clinical decision support tool for stroke prevention) trial,6 but no significant effect on primary outcomes in 3 other randomized trials.13-15 Educational interventions for both providers and patients can improve use of anticoagulation.16\n\n6 Prevention of Thromboembolism\n\n6.1 Risk Stratification Schemes\n\nRecommendations for Risk Stratification Schemes\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nPatients with AF have an increased risk of stroke that varies widely among individuals. Several risk scores based on clinical factors have been developed.1-3 Risk scores should be evaluated using accepted criteria11: their ability to discriminate between high- and low-risk individuals (eg, as assessed by the c-index), their accurate calibration to actual risk levels, and their validation in independent populations. A patient’s absolute risk of stroke is central to recommendations about anticoagulation and can be characterized as low (∼< 1%/y), intermediate (∼1 to ∼2%/y), and high (∼>2%/y). Currently used risk scores discriminate moderately well between patients at higher and lower risk yet can greatly overestimate or underestimate absolute risk levels4 in different populations. Current risk scores may be inaccurate because they omit other factors that alter risk of stroke, especially characteristics of AF12-14; consequently, risk scores should be calibrated against the actual annual rates of stroke in the target population to assure an accurate, unbiased risk prediction. Newer risk scores may modestly improve risk discrimination (c-index) compared with CHA2DS2-VASc and may offer potential advantages in specific populations (Table 8). Online calculators are available for the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation),1 CHA2DS2-VASc,2 and GARFIELD-AF3 (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation) risk scores.\n\nAnticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding risk as part of SDM about anticoagulation. Currently used bleeding risk scores—HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio [INR], elderly [age ≥65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly]),5 HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older age [≥75 years], reduced platelet count or function, re-bleeding risk, hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, stroke),6 and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation: anemia, renal disease, elderly [age ≥75 years], any prior bleeding, hypertension)7—discriminate poorly between patients with and without bleeding15 and include many nonspecific factors that predict an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and previous stroke). Assessment of factors that specifically predict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nSeveral risk scores based on clinical factors have been developed1-3; in general, risk discrimination is improved by including more predictors (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc improved on the original CHADS22 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemia attack/thromboembolism] by adding additional risk factors and age categories). However, the absolute risk associated with any particular score level varies widely across populations; among 15 cohort studies, patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 had annual rates of stroke that ranged from low to high: <1% in 4 cohorts, 1% to 2% in 6 cohorts, and >2% in 5 cohorts,4 although higher scores were associated with higher stroke risk in each cohort (Figure 9). The CHA2DS2-VASc score is considered the most validated score, most therapies have used that score to prove efficacy, and thus CHA2DS2-VASc is generally the preferred score. Yet, despite its extensive use, CHA2DS2-VASc has shown suboptimal performance in selected populations, such as those with renal disease, prompting the creation of other scores. Newer risk scores, such as the ATRIA1,16,17 and GARFIELD-AF3,18 scores, modestly improve risk discrimination (c-index) compared with CHA2DS2-VASc, but their calibration and risk reclassification performance has not been as rigorously evaluated. A recent meta-analysis reported that 19 risk scores, 329 external validations, and 76 risk score updates have been conducted to predict ischemic stroke in patients with AF.19 Potential differences of the most studied risk scores are listed in Table 9. Some potential advantages of other scores, for example, the GARFIELD-AF score, includes mortality and bleeding risk to facilitate discussion with patients in a more comprehensive way. Also, when uncertainty exists, a score such as GARFIELD-AF adds additional variables to consider, such as smoking status, renal disease, and dementia. This guideline does not intend to preclude the future development of more accurate scores for stratifying patients.\n\n2.\n\nClinical decisions surrounding stroke prevention therapy in patients with AF must balance the risks of ischemic stroke, the risks of bleeding with treatment, net clinical benefit, and patient preferences. The most studied bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED,5 HEMORR2HAGES,6 and ATRIA7) discriminate poorly between patients with and without bleeding20 (c-index 0.58 to 0.59 in a French nationwide study21). These scores are problematic to use in clinical decision-making because they incorporate several clinical factors that increase the risks of both stroke and bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and previous stroke), which makes it difficult to balance the benefits and risks of anticoagulation because the same risk factors also predict higher risk of stroke. Consideration of factors that specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding without predicting higher risk of stroke (eg, previous bleeding, anemia, and certain medications) may better inform decision-making about the balance of benefits and harms expected from anticoagulation. Assessment of risk factors specific for bleeding may suggest interventions to reduce bleeding risk, such as discontinuing antiplatelet medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or the use of LAAO devices.10\n\n3.\n\nThe decision to treat with OACs for stroke prevention in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc of 1 (CHA2DS2-VASc of 2 in women) may at times require additional discussion with patients as the strength or recommendation is less robust (2a), and often patients might be more reluctant. Also, the 1-point-concept of risk estimation in the subgroup of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 has shown to be simplistic because the magnitude of risk for each factor is heterogeneous and because data have shown a wide range of risk depending on the studied cohort.22 Thus, as part of SDM discussions with patients, other factors, such as AF burden, can be considered when interpreting a stroke risk score.12-14,23 Additional factors, such as degree of hypertension control, can also affect the risk of stroke; in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, a single elevated BP measurement during the study was associated with a 50% increased risk of stroke.23,24 Additional patient-specific risk factors, such as certain biomarkers (eg, proBNP), LA or left atrial appendage (LAA) function and anatomy, or electrocardiographic features, among others, have been demonstrated to influence stroke risk, yet it is unclear how to incorporate them into clinical practice.12 Antithrombotic treatment with DOACs seems to offer a superior net-benefit with regard to prevention of thromboembolic events and the risk of major bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Consideration of these additional factors may inform decision-making for patients with an intermediate risk of stroke who remain uncertain on deciding anticoagulation.\n\n4.\n\nUnless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS-BLED,5 HEMORR2HAGES,6 and ATRIA7) are based on several clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding.8,9 Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.8,9\n\n6.2 Risk-Based Selection of Oral Anticoagulation: Balancing Risks and Benefits\n\nRecommendations for Risk-Based Selection of Oral Anticoagulation: Balancing Risks and Benefits\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nPrevention of stroke is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL. Selection of stroke risk reduction therapy should be guided by the patient’s risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and their individual preferences. When considering stroke prevention therapy, the risk of stroke should inform the decision regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent). All decisions regarding stroke prevention therapy should be periodically reassessed since a patient’s risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nAlthough the risk of stroke and systemic embolism and all-cause mortality are increased in persons with more persistent forms of AF, selection of stroke prevention therapy should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF. Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent) in trials of stroke prevention therapy.1-3\n\n2.\n\nAF is a lifelong condition and, thus, patient characteristics, risk factors, and net clinical benefit can and often will change over time.4 In long-term follow-up, stroke risk increases due to age and accumulation of other risk factors.6 Physiologic factors that impact stroke prevention therapy also change over time and can have important implications for proper medication dosing and patient safety.5 Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently in the context of changes in clinical status, such as reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors.\n\n6.3 Oral Anticoagulants\n\nVitamin K Antagonists\n\nSince the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice. A narrow therapeutic window based on international normalized ratios (INRs), frequent monitoring, more frequent drug interactions (mainly through CYP2C9), dietary restrictions, and low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice. Because of affordability issues of DOACs for some patients with AF, warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs. About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017.1 Warfarin remains the first-line therapy in patients with AF and moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves. Clinical studies show that the target INR is between 2 and 3, and risk of bleeding becomes mostly apparent when INR exceeds 4. OAC use in special populations will be discussed in separate sections.\n\nDirect oral anticoagulants\n\nDOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the first-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients) in this guideline. All 4 pivotal clinical trials comparing individual DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) with warfarin showed superiority or noninferiority to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF except for moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve.2-5 They also showed significantly lower risks of major bleeding in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily group, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups compared with the warfarin group or nonsignificant differences in major bleeding between dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group and warfarin. All DOAC groups showed significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared with warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were significantly higher in the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban groups compared with the warfarin group. However, the apixaban group did not significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with the warfarin group.\n\n6.3.1 Antithrombotic Therapy\n\nRecommendations for Antithrombotic Therapy\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nA high risk for stroke or systemic embolism is about 2% per year, and all the DOAC trials (Re-LY [Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy]; ROCKET AF [Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation]; ARISTOTLE; and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 [Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48]) included patients with this level of risk.1-4 Patients at intermediate risk (1%-2%/y) can also benefit from anticoagulation, and the RE-LY1 and ARISTOTLE3 trials included this population. Stroke risk scores applied to cohorts give different stroke rates, and therefore any score should be viewed as only an estimate of true risk; in addition some scores used stroke, while others used thromboembolic events. Nonetheless, it is practical to use a validated risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, or GARFIELD-AF. Future research may yield improved risk scores that refine how to incorporate risk modifiers, such as female sex12 and other parameters such as AF burden. Anticoagulation has also been shown to be superior to antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.8,9 Recommendations for antithrombotic selection in valvular heart disease (VHD) are provided in Section 6.8.5 (“AF in VHD”) and for AFL in Section 6.8.6 (Figure 10).\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nRandomized trials published in the 1990s established the superiority of anticoagulation, at that time limited to warfarin, to reduce stroke.11 Since that time, management has advanced considerably, and the randomized trials that compared DOACs with warfarin1-4 are more relevant to current antithrombotic management. In these trials1-4 and metanalyses,5-7 DOACs were favored for lower risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH.1-7 These trials reported the CHADS2 score. The recently studied ATRIA and Swedish cohorts13,14 reported lower stroke rates, by CHADS2 score, compared with that previously reported.15 A CHADS2 score of 1 gave a stroke rate of 1.20 in ATRIA14 and 2.4 in a Swedish cohort.13 A CHADS2 score of 2 gave a stroke rate of 2.59 in ATRIA14 and 3.5 in the Swedish cohort.13 Therefore, the stroke risk of patients in the rivaroxaban2 and edoxaban4 trials was likely >2% given a required minimum CHADS2 score of 2, and lower in the apixaban3 and dabigatran1 trials that included scores of 0 and 1. A Markov state transition decision model16 concluded that anticoagulation was preferred for a stroke rate of 1.7%. Therefore, a stroke and systemic embolism risk threshold of 2% is likely to yield a benefit that far exceeds risk. In some conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the risk of stroke is high enough independent of risk score to indicate anticoagulation.17\n\n2.\n\nIn the randomized DOAC trials, all DOACs achieved noninferiority1-4 and in 2 trials (for dabigatran, RE-LY, and for apixaban, ARISTOTLE) were superior to warfarin. With warfarin, regular assessment of the INR is necessary to maintain a therapeutic value. In the RCTs, the mean time in therapeutic range was only 55% in ROCKET AF2 and highest at 66% in ARISTOTLE.3 In a meta-analysis,6 DOACs, compared with warfarin, had a relative risk of stroke of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91; P<0.0001), a relative risk of mortality of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P=0.0003), relative risk of ICH of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.59; P<0.0001), and increased relative risk of bleeding of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.01-1.55; P=0.043). Although patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve were excluded from DOAC trials (and subsequently shown they may have worse outcomes with DOACS), other forms of VHD were allowed, such as aortic stenosis or regurgitation or mitral regurgitation. Bioprosthetic valves and valve repair were allowed in the edoxaban (ENGAGE AF) and apixaban (ARISTOTLE) trials, and valve repair in the rivaroxaban (ROCKET AF) trial. A systematic review18 of patients with VHD (other than mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) concluded that DOACs were safe.\n\n3.\n\nAs the DOAC trials1-4 demonstrated improved safety compared with warfarin, the threshold of using a DOAC might be different than for warfarin.16 A Markov decision model found the tipping point for warfarin to be at 1.7%/year stroke risk.16 Considering the improved ICH and mortality risk of DOACs compared with warfarin in meta-analyses of the DOAC trials,5-7 it is appropriate to designate a lower stroke risk threshold if a DOAC is utilized. The dabigatran1 and apixaban3 trials included lower risk patients and about one-third of patients had a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1. This likely corresponds to an estimated annual stroke risk of about 1%, considering more recent cohorts.13,14 This is further supported by meta-analyses that showed a consistent benefit of DOACs across a broad range of vulnerable patients, including as classified by CHADS2 scores.6,7\n\n4.\n\nA meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and early 2000s found that while antiplatelet therapy (APT), most commonly aspirin, reduced stroke and systemic embolism compared with placebo, APT was inferior to warfarin in patients with AF.11 Aspirin was studied compared to apixaban in the AVERROES trial (Apixaban Versus ASA to Prevent Stroke In AF Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment)9 for patients unsuitable for VKAs; this trial was stopped early due to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin to prevent stroke or systemic embolism, while major bleeding was similar between the 2 arms. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was compared to VKAs in ACTIVEW (Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events),8 and this trial was stopped prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagulation with VKAs to prevent stroke, non–central nervous system systemic embolus, MI, or vascular death. Unless there is an indication for antiplatelet therapy, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) or vascular disease, patients with AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.\n\n5.\n\nAspirin therapy was compared with no treatment in patients with low stroke risk in a multicenter RCT in Japan, the Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial.10 This trial was stopped early when an interim analysis showed that aspirin gave a marginally higher risk of major bleeding and was unlikely to prevent primary or secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was noncardiovascular death, ICH, major bleeding, and peripheral embolization. A meta-analysis of 7 trials that studied aspirin versus placebo found that aspirin reduced stroke by 19%, which did not reach statistical significance with a CI that included 0 (–1% to 35%). Four of these were primary prevention trials and showed an absolute risk reduction with aspirin of 0.8% per year, with a number needed to treat of 125.11 Although aspirin has not been studied in patients without any risk factors for stroke, patients without stroke risk may derive no benefit from aspirin therapy. In fact, 1 study that analyzed stroke mechanisms in the SPAF (Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation) I-III trials demonstrated that aspirin did not decrease the rate of cardioembolic stroke and that AF patients at highest risk for stroke are those with the highest rates of cardioembolic stroke and have the greatest reduction in stroke with anticoagulants.19 Thus, modest reduction in stroke observed in some trials may have been related to noncardioembolic stroke in patients with additional risk factors.\n\n6.3.1.1 Considerations in Managing Anticoagulants\n\nRecommendations for Considerations in Managing Anticoagulants\n\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement.\n\nCORLOERecommendations\n\nSynopsis\n\nMultiple factors need to be considered to select an optimal OAC in patients with AF. Efficacy, safety, insurance coverage, renal/hepatic function, drug interaction screening, medication adherence, and patient preferences are the major factors for consideration. Dosing of DOACs in patients with AF should be selected based on age, renal function, weight, and concomitant medications. The hepatic function also needs to be evaluated for the appropriateness of DOACs. Characteristics and dosing of OACs are summarized in Table 13. Although DOAC drug interactions occur in practice less frequently than with warfarin, clinically significant drug interactions through CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein should be carefully evaluated. Strong CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and ritonavir may significantly increase DOAC plasma levels and the risk of bleeding, while strong CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inducers such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, or St. John’s wort may lower DOAC plasma levels and increase the risks of stroke or systemic embolism. The routine measurement of DOAC plasma concentrations is not indicated in practice due to the lack of well-established therapeutic ranges in the literature. DOAC levels may be indicated when clinicians assess DOAC adherence for potentially noncompliant patients, quantify residual anticoagulation levels before emergency invasive procedures/surgeries, or evaluate the absorption of DOAC after bariatric surgery. Regular monitoring is recommended to optimize indications, ensure appropriate dosing, and avoid adverse effects. Suggested laboratory monitoring is summarized in Figure 11.\n\nIf warfarin is selected over DOACs, achievement of higher time in therapeutic range (eg, ≥70%), and thorough consideration of drug-drug interactions, vitamin K food intake advice, and patient education on adherence to dosing instructions are important to reduce adverse effects.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nRivaroxaban is contraindicated for patients receiving ketoconazole or ritonavir, because ketoconazole or ritonavir coadministration significantly increased rivaroxaban plasma levels by 158% or 153%, respectively.1 Apixaban also requires dose adjustment to 2.5 mg twice daily for patients receiving apixaban 5 mg twice daily when ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir is started.13 Apixaban plasma level was significantly increased by 99% when ketoconazole was coadministered in healthy subjects.2 The concomitant therapy of dronedarone or ketoconazole for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30 to 50 mL/min receiving dabigatran requires dose adjustment to dabigatran 75 mg twice daily because it produced comparable dabigatran exposure in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min receiving the concomitant therapy to patients with CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min receiving only dabigatran.14 A retrospective study revealed that the probability of patients with subreference DOAC levels was"
