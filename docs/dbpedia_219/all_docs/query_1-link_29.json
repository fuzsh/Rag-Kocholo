        "text": "The protective shell is covered in solar panels to make use of light and produce energy. This will drastically reduce energy loss.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of the energy consumed by the French pavilion will be produced by the sun.\n\nThe architecture will control light sources to provide a highly insulated and airtight building.\n\nThe forecourt is protected from the sun and the plants will refresh the inner spaces.\n\nA micro water treatment plant will recycle used water to supply the irrigation for the plants and to flush the toilets. This will reduce the pavilionâ€™s need for fresh water by 30 per cent.\n\nEnergy-saving equipment will be used for all lighting and projections.\n\nBeyond its use for the expo, the pavilion will be easy to dismantle and reuse the material.\n\nSome elements of the metal frame can be prefabricated in a factory.\n\nFrom architects to sound technicians and construction companies, a group of experts from 10 companies have created the pavilion.\n\nWork will begin in May; the first stone will be laid in Dubai in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nConstruction of the pavilion will take 17 months from May 2019 to September 2020.\n\nThe UAE overhauled the procedure to recruit housemaids and domestic workers with a law in 2017 to protect low-income labour from being exploited.\n\nOnly recruitment companies authorised by the government are permitted as part of Tadbeer, a network of labour ministry-regulated centres.\n\nA contract must be drawn up for domestic workers, the wages and job offer clearly stating the nature of work.\n\nThe contract stating the wages, work entailed and accommodation must be sent to the employee in their home country before they depart for the UAE.\n\nThe contract will be signed by the employer and employee when the domestic worker arrives in the UAE.\n\nOnly recruitment agencies registered with the ministry can undertake recruitment and employment applications for domestic workers.\n\nPenalties for illegal recruitment in the UAE include fines of up to Dh100,000 and imprisonment\n\nBut agents not authorised by the government sidestep the law by illegally getting women into the country on visit visas."
