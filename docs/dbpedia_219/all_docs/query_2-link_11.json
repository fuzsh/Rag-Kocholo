        "text": "Yemen’s civil war has taken a dramatic turn after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, punishing him for switching sides and seeking peace with Saudi Arabia.\n\nPictures of Saleh’s corpse appeared on Houthi-run television after the militia said it had killed him as he fled the capital, Sana’a. He had ruled Yemen for more than 30 years and was forced to resign in 2011 as part of the Arab spring political revolution.\n\nHouthi military officials said Saleh was killed as he was travelling with other top party leaders from Sana’a to his hometown of Sanhan. Houthi fighters followed him in 20 armoured vehicles, then attacked and killed him and almost all those with him. Gruesome video footage of his blood-spattered body were distributed on social media.\n\nEarlier his house was destroyed in fighting that has erupted in Sana’a between Houthi militia and forces loyal to Saleh. Saudi-led coalition warplanes pounded Houthi positions close to the city airport, and the ministry of the interior.\n\nThe Saudi bombing was part of a desperate and ultimately doomed attempt to prevent the Houthis taking complete control of the capital. Salah’s death may prompt a furious reaction from Saudi Arabia, which is determined to push back Iranian influence in the country.\n\nThe violence between the Houthis and Saleh’s forces has led so far to the deaths of at least 125 civilians in clashes in the last last five days, according to the International Red Cross. The fresh violence comes after the sudden collapse of the political and military alliance between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Saleh. The two groups had held Sana’a for the past three years in an uneasy alliance.\n\nThe International Red Cross also warned it was struggling to keep the hospital functioning in Sana’a and access its warehouse of medical supplies.\n\nThe distribution of humanitarian aid across the country is fraught, with 7 million people dependent on aid in what the UN has described as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. The civil war has so far claimed 10,000 lives.\n\nOn Saturday, Saleh gave a televised address in effect announcing that he was swapping sides in the civil war, and would be seeking a dialogue with the Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led coalition that he had been fighting, alongside the Houthis, since 2015. The Saudis have sought to reinstall the UN-recognised government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and defeat the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a Middle East-wide power struggle that has the potential to envelop the whole region in a war. It is widely thought that UAE diplomats persuaded the 75-year-old Saleh to swap sides.\n\n“Yemeni citizens have tried to tolerate the recklessness of the Houthi over the last two and a half years but cannot any more,” Saleh said in his TV address. He ordered forces loyal to him in the capital to stop taking instructions from the Shia Houthi rebels.\n\nThe alliance of convenience between Saleh and the Houthis has been close to collapse for months, with claims that Houthis tried to kill Saleh’s son.\n\nHadi also ordered forces loyal to him, mainly based in the southern city of Aden, to capitalise on the disarray in the opposition and advance north to Houthi positions. Hadi’s staff also said they would offer an amnesty to anyone that had collaborated with the Houthi regime.\n\nHours after Saleh’s death, Hadi delivered a televised speech calling for Yemenis to unity against the Houthi rebels, describing them as “Iranian militias” and a “nightmare”.\n\nIt is widely thought that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had been engineering Saleh’s change in allegiance for months after they became disillusioned with Hadi’s leadership, and looked for a new way to break the political and military deadlock. Hadi has been living in exile in Riyadh, and there are reports that he now has little independence from Saudi control.\n\nPeter Salisbury, expert on Yemen at the thinktank Chatham House, said: “With Saleh gone, and no one with whom the Saudis can strike a deal, it is very likely the Saudis will take the gloves off, but the precise extent to which they do so depends very much on what Washington allows them to do. It could get very bloody and messy.”“Everyone has been shocked by the speed with which the Houthis seem to have gained ground in Sana’a, and it has left the Saudis worse off than they were 72 hours ago.”\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, called for fighting in Sana’a to pause on Tuesday during daylight hours to allow civilians trapped in their homes to seek food and water.\n\n“The streets of Sana’a city have become battlegrounds and people are trapped in their homes, unable to move out in search of safety and medical care and to access basic supplies such as food, fuel and safe water,” he said in a statement issued from Geneva.\n\nRiyadh’s determination to crush the Houthis hardened last month after an Iranian-made missile was fired from Houthi positions at Saudi Arabia’s international airport in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia responded by mounting a three-week blockade of goods entering Houthi-controlled ports, prompting widespread shortages."
