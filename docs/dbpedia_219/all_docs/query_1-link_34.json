        "text": "Mortada Mansour, former president of Zamalek Club, directed a fiery criticism of the journalist Ibrahim Fayek via Facebook due to the case of the late player Ahmed Refaat.\n\nMortada Mansour said: “After President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s decision to transfer the case of the late Ahmed Refaat to the Public Prosecution, Ibrahim Fayek appeared claiming heroism and that the decision is a great victory for him and his program, and I do not know what his role is, frankly, except Just crying in an episode in which you are being charged a million pounds.”\n\nHe added: “What did I do to take away the rights of the deceased, and there is no need, and by mentioning him and the media channels and the internal media in two posts of mine, perhaps you will excel and come to your senses.” \".\n\nHe continued: “Enough of misleading public opinion and fabricating fake championships. By the way, the prosecution’s investigations will not be about revealing the person who caused the killing of Ahmed Refaat, but rather about revealing who is responsible for his travel despite his conscription.”\n\nHe concluded: \"Finally, all thanks to Mr. President for his interest in the case of an oppressed player who died oppressed.\""
