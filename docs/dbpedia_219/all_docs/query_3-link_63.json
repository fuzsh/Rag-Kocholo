        "text": "Grief Q & A\n\nWhat are the common causes of grief?\n\nThough life can be full of joy and love, in every person’s life, there will be periods of profound loss and grief. It is impossible to be alive and not experience this at some point. This loss can come from many sources, whether it is the death of a loved one, a divorce, the loss of a pet, or a financial loss. Personal illness and loss of physical or mental function can also be incredibly powerful losses to experience.\n\nThe grief that follows from these losses is natural. However, it can be hard to deal with the grief and move forward healthily. When someone becomes stuck in their grief and loses the ability to process and move beyond their grief, it is called complicated grief. Someone experiencing complicated grief may feel that they will always feel this way, and their grief may consume their life. Often, professional help may be necessary to become “unstuck.”\n\nWhat are the symptoms of grief?\n\nThe effects of grief and loss can appear in many ways, some of them obvious and some not so obvious. It is common to feel profoundly sad and down, experience frequent crying, and have feelings of shock and denial. Other feelings associated with grief include:\n\nNumbness\n\nAnxiety\n\nConfusion\n\nAnger\n\nGuilt\n\nShame\n\nLoneliness\n\nFeeling withdrawn\n\nConfusion\n\nExhaustion\n\nIn addition to the difficult emotions associated with grief and loss, an individual may also experience physical symptoms, including:\n\nDifficulty sleeping\n\nHeadaches\n\nLoss of interest in activities that are usually pleasurable\n\nAlcohol or drug use\n\nIf you suspect that you or a loved one may be experiencing grief, know that help is available. Contact Adrian Counseling and Psychiatric Clinic right away.\n\nWhat is a healthy way to deal with grief?\n\nThe feelings of grief can sometimes be overwhelming, making it hard to effectively process the emotions and move forward in a healthy manner. When someone becomes stuck in their feelings of grief, speaking with a mental health professional can help that person begin to process their emotions in a healthy manner, reminding them of the possibility of living a life filled with joy and happiness.\n\nTo learn more about dealing with loss and grief and how you can get the help that you need, call or book online today to schedule your first appointment."
