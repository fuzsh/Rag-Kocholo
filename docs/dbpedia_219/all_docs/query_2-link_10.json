        "text": "According to Kurdpa, a Kurdish man was executed in Ilam Central Prison on 11 March. His identity has been reported as 44-year-old Mansour Mansouri from Sarableh in Ilam province. He was sentenced to qisas (retribution-in-kind) for murder.\n\nIran Human Rights previously reported the execution of Moein Salahvarzi at the prison that day.\n\nAt the time of writing, his execution has not been reported by domestic media or officials in Iran.\n\nThose charged with the umbrella term of “intentional murder” are sentenced to qisas (retribution-in-kind) regardless of intent or circumstances due to a lack of grading in law. Once a defendant has been convicted, as the plaintiffs, the victim’s family are required to choose between death as retribution, diya (blood money) or forgiveness.\n\nIn 2023, at least 282 people including two juvenile offenders and 15 women, were executed for murder charges, the second highest number of qisas executions since 2010. Only 20% of the recorded qisas executions were announced by official sources. In 2023, Iran Human Rights also recorded 857 cases of families choosing diya or forgiveness instead of qisas executions."
