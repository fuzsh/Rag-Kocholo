        "text": "An emerging paradigm in biology is that events in traditional 2-dimensional cell culture often differ from those in 3-dimensional (3-D) culture (Benam et al., 2015; Pampaloni et al., 2007). Furthermore, the extracellular matrix regulates cell biology (Yamada and Cukierman, 2007; Schwartz and Chen, 2013; Parker et al., 2014) and infection biology differs between 2-D and 3-D systems (Cheng et al., 2011; Barrila et al., 2010). Human disease occurs in 3-D and in the context of extracellular matrix. Consequently, conclusions drawn from 2-dimensional cell culture systems may not fully reflect events in vivo (Yamada and Cukierman, 2007). This presents a challenge to progress from standard culture systems, where cells are grown in 2-D on plastic, to more advanced systems that more faithfully replicate events in man (Yamada and Cukierman, 2007). These technical difficulties are particularly marked in studying infectious diseases, where experiments must have additional levels of containment to prevent the release of pathogens (Barrila et al., 2010).\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogen of global significance that continues to kill 1.5 million people per year (O'Garra et al., 2013; Horsburgh et al., 2015). Unfortunately, despite major investment in research, recent clinical trials and vaccine studies to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) have been unsuccessful (Tameris et al., 2013; Ndiaye et al., 2015; Warner and Mizrahi, 2014), indicating that the model systems that informed these studies require further refinement. In TB, the host-pathogen interaction is highly complex, with the immune response concurrently necessary for containment of infection but paradoxically also driving immunopathology that leads to lung destruction and transmission (Russell, 2011; Elkington and Friedland, 2015). The mouse is the principal model system to study TB, but inflammatory conditions in the mouse differ from man (Seok et al., 2013), and lung pathology is different in murine Mtb infection (Young, 2009). Mtb is an obligate human pathogen and has a very prolonged interaction with host cells, surviving within professional phagocytes (Russell, 2011). Therefore, long term human culture experiments are required to investigate pathogenesis. A specific advantage of 3-D cell culture incorporating extracellular matrix is that cellular survival is greatly prolonged (Buchheit et al., 2012; Mueller-Klieser, 1997). Furthermore, inflammatory signalling in TB granulomas is spatially organised (Marakalala et al., 2016), with specific microenvironments (Mattila et al., 2013), and the extracellular matrix regulates cell survival in TB (Al Shammari et al., 2015), indicating that an optimal system to study human disease will need to be 3-D with extracellular matrix.\n\nWe hypothesised that to fully understand the host-pathogen interaction in TB, a 3-D cell culture system that incorporates primary human cells, extracellular matrix, fully virulent Mtb, and multiparameter longitudinal readouts is required. Whilst human cellular models of human granuloma formation have been developed, none have all these characteristics (Puissegur et al., 2004; Lay et al., 2007; Kapoor et al., 2013; Parasa et al., 2014). We addressed the technical challenges of performing these experiments at biosafety containment level three by adopting a bioengineering approach (Workman et al., 2014). We developed a model system that permits interrogation of the host-pathogen interaction in 3-D in the context of extracellular matrix. We demonstrate that cardinal features of human disease develop and that the host immune response is significantly different when cells are adherent to collagen, favouring the host relative to the pathogen. We investigate emerging therapeutic approaches in the system, and demonstrate that each intervention has both beneficial and likely harmful effects. The model permits the concurrent analysis of multiple outcomes and therefore can be used to develop optimal approaches to address the TB pandemic, and can be applied to diverse infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.\n\nNovel approaches to the global TB pandemic are urgently required. Mtb is an obligate human pathogen characterised by a prolonged interaction with the host (Russell, 2011; Cambier et al., 2014), a spatially organised immune response (Marakalala et al., 2016; Mattila et al., 2013; Egen et al., 2008) and extensive extracellular matrix turnover (Elkington et al., 2011). Therefore, extended studies of human cells adherent to extracellular matrix in 3-D are likely to be essential to fully understand the host-pathogen interaction. We developed a model of human TB utilising bio-electrospray technology that replicates key features of clinical disease and optimised a multiplex readout to investigate both host and pathogen responses. We demonstrated that the extracellular matrix regulates the host immune response, consistent with reports of the ECM regulating inflammation (Sorokin, 2010), and found that collagen favours host control of Mtb. We then used the model to investigate novel therapeutic approaches. The system permitted prolonged culture of primary human cells, and we found that significant differences between experimental conditions often only emerged after more than 7 days, which would not have been observed in 2D culture systems where 3–4 days is the standard experimental duration. Our findings are consistent with other infections, where the cellular adaptions to their context determines outcome (Snijder et al., 2009). This cell culture platform is highly flexible for both matrix and cellular composition within spheres and therefore has wide potential applicability within the biomedical field.\n\nOur bioengineering approach differs significantly from traditional model systems to investigate TB, which predominantly rely on culture of human cells in 2D culture systems without extracellular matrix, infection of the zebrafish larvae with M. marinum or infection of mice with Mtb (Young, 2009; Guirado and Schlesinger, 2013; Vogt and Nathan, 2011). The mouse model of TB has many advantages and key findings in the mouse have been replicated in man, such as critical roles for CD4+ T cells, TNF-α and IFN-γ (Flynn and Chan, 2001), but pathology in the mouse differs from human TB (Young, 2009) and humanised mice are required to generate caseating lesions (Calderon et al., 2013; Heuts et al., 2013). Other advanced human cellular models of TB have been developed. For example, Altare’s group has studied a prolonged model of PBMC culture with Mtb and demonstrated cell aggregate formation (Puissegur et al., 2004; Lay et al., 2007), but this model lacks extracellular matrix. A collagen matrix-containing model has been developed by Kapoor, showing aggregation and TB dormancy (Kapoor et al., 2013), but lacks the high throughput potential of the bioelectrospray system and rapid cellular recovery for multiparameter readouts. Generation of a complete human granuloma structure will require stromal cells such as fibroblasts, which are present in the periphery of TB granulomas (O'Kane et al., 2010). A key next step will be to compare patients with latent TB with active TB, and those with and without HIV-co-infection, to determine whether the model can differentiate protective immunity to Mtb directly ex vivo.\n\nMany of our findings are consistent with conclusions drawn from these systems. For example, a significant role for IFN-β in the host immune response to TB is emerging from genomic studies, though it remains controversial as to whether this is protective or harmful (Cliff et al., 2015). Our data suggest a predominantly protective effect, and emerging data support this conclusion (Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016). Similarly, we confirmed that augmentation of PGE2 improves host control of mycobacterial proliferation, consistent with findings in the mouse (Mayer-Barber et al., 2014). Finally, T cells responsive to specific Mtb antigens proliferated in infected microspheres and secreted cytokines known to be important in the host immune response to Mtb (O'Garra et al., 2013).\n\nHowever, while some results were as expected, several findings in the 3-D system may not be predicted from current disease paradigms. For example, IFN-γ in high concentrations increases the growth of TB, whereas murine experiments predict improved control. Consistent with our findings, several previous studies have shown that IFN-γ increases Mtb growth in primary human cells (Vogt and Nathan, 2011; Douvas et al., 1985; Rook et al., 1986; Crowle and Elkins, 1990). The evidence for a beneficial role of IFN-γ in humans is principally supported by individuals where there is a complete absence of signalling through the IL-12/IFN pathway (Karp et al., 2015), and this protective effect has clearly been shown in the mouse through both knock-out and vaccination studies (Flynn and Chan, 2001; Aagaard et al., 2011). However, cohort studies have shown that a high PPD response, or high IFN-γ response to ESAT-6 or CFP-10, associates with the subsequent development of TB (Comstock et al., 1974; Higuchi et al., 2008; del Corral et al., 2009), suggesting that an excessive IFN-γ response may be deleterious. We attempted to determine if there was a tipping point of IFN-γ concentration by adding IFN-γ neutralising antibodies to the microsphere matrix, and although we were able to demonstrate increased growth with IFN-γ neutralisation, we found a similar effect with isotype control antibodies, so it was impossible to determine if this was a specific effect. Our longitudinal observations of Mtb growth in a non-destructive manner using luminescent mycobacteria support the emerging concept that a balanced immune response is essential, and either a deficit or excess of a specific mediator may favour the pathogen (O'Garra et al., 2013; Gideon et al., 2015). Combining the model with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit further interrogation of each cytokine component of the immune response.\n\nPGE2 augmentation has been proposed as a novel host-directed therapy to improve outcome in TB, and we demonstrate reduced Mtb growth. However, the multiparamter analysis in our human system showed that PGE2 increases secretion of IL-8, which is likely to drive migration of neutrophils, and PGE2 also reduced host cell viability. Neutrophil recruitment has been described to have a deleterious effect on host control of infection (Kimmey et al., 2015; Nouailles et al., 2014) and therefore there is potential that this may favour Mtb, driving increased pathology, lung destruction and transmission. The peak PGE2 concentration that we studied is similar to that reported in human tissue (Reikerås et al., 2009). We also found that immunoaugmentation with ESAT-6 or CFP-10 responsive T cell lines led to increased growth of Mtb. Pathogenic mycobacteria express the RD1 locus but the precise mechanism linking RD1 to pathology is not fully understood (Majlessi et al., 2015). Our findings are consistent with the recent observations that T cell epitopes are hyperconserved in pathogenic mycobacteria (Comas et al., 2010; Coscolla et al., 2015; Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2015), indicating an evolutionary advantage to the pathogen of specifically stimulating components of the host immune response to facilitate transmission (Orme et al., 2015). However, an alternative explanation is that the in vitro expansion conditions generated a T cell phenotype that was permissive to Mtb growth, skewing an initially protective phenotype to a deleterious one, and so further confirmation across different T cell lines is required. Augmented iNKT cells did not increase Mtb growth after ex vivo expansion. The key conclusion of these experiments is that the immunoaugmentation model has potential to dissect protective versus pathological host immune responses.\n\nThe recent negative outcomes from both vaccine trials (Tameris et al., 2013; Ndiaye et al., 2015) and treatment-shortening regimes (Warner and Mizrahi, 2014) illustrate that observations in current model systems may not reliably translate to human disease and highlight the need for more nuanced approaches that reflect human TB infection. Our data suggest that simply driving an increased immune response to Mtb will not improve control of mycobacterial growth. Augmenting PGE2 release by modulating the leukotriene pathway may reduce mycobacterial proliferation but may come at a cost of increased pathology. Vaccination using ESAT-6 as an antigen, which has entered human trials (Luabeya et al., 2015), may actually favour Mtb growth under certain circumstances, demonstrating the fine balance between the host immune response and control of pathogen growth. Critically, our data from the bioengineered model are consistent with clinical phenomena observed in human TB. For example, an excessive immune response in patients is associated with greater pulmonary pathology (Kaufmann and Dorhoi, 2013; Comstock et al., 1974; Philips and Ernst, 2012; Nunes-Alves et al., 2014). Similarly, our immunoaugmentation studies concur with the expression of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 by pathogenic mycobacteria, implying a critical role in causing disease (Brites and Gagneux, 2015). The model can be used to investigate approaches currently in development, such as vaccines based on targeting CD1-restricted T cells (Van Rhijn et al., 2015) and emerging host-directed therapies (Hawn et al., 2013; Zumla et al., 2015), to determine whether they confer greater protection without likely harmful effects.\n\nThe bio-electrospray cell culture model has broad potential, addressing the technical complexity of performing 3-D primary cell culture within diverse extracellular matrices. The system can readily be applied to study diverse infectious and inflammatory diseases, or cancer immunotherapy, and can be developed for high-throughput applications by combining the microsphere system with microfluidics. Integration with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit genetic manipulation of both host and pathogen (Chakraborty et al., 2014). The multiparameter readouts define the translational potential of novel interventions over time with longitudinal data acquisition, identifying both beneficial and deleterious effects. Therefore, this system developed to dissect the host-pathogen interaction in human TB can be applied to identify novel therapeutic approaches to multiple human diseases."
