        "text": "MAKKAH: Dr. Saleh bin Zain Al-Abidin Al-Shaibi, the senior caretaker of the Kaaba, died in Makkah on Friday evening. Funeral prayers were held after Fajr on Saturday at the Grand Mosque.\n\nAl-Shaibi, who held a doctorate in Islamic studies, was a university professor and an author of several works on creed and history. He was the 77th key holder of the Kaaba since the conquest of Makkah.\n\nHis responsibilities included opening and closing the Kaaba, cleaning, washing, repairing its Kiswa (covering), and welcoming visitors. He took over the guardianship after the death of his uncle, Abdulqader Taha Al-Shaibi, in 2013.\n\nHis son, Abdulrahman Saleh Al-Shaibi, told Arab News that saying farewell to his father was one of the hardest and saddest moments of his life. He added that the family accepted Allah’s will for a man who was always close to everyone and dedicated his life to serving the family.\n\nHe went on to say that his father had been suffering from illness recently but had remained patient and steadfast. The entire community shared in the family’s grief and expressed their sorrow and pain for the loss of the Al-Shaibi family’s pillar.\n\nAl-Shaibi chaired the Department of Creed at Umm Al-Qura University for over two decades. Known for his scholarly approach and love for knowledge, he explored religious and doctrinal issues deeply. An academic at heart, he left a significant and lasting impact.\n\nKing Fahd bin Abdulaziz appointed him to the Saudi Shoura Council, and Al-Shaibi served as the deputy to his uncle in the guardianship of the Kaaba until becoming senior caretaker.\n\nHis son Abdulrahman added that he had served as his father’s deputy in the guardianship of the Kaaba for five years, after which his cousin Abdulmalik Al-Shaibi had taken over.\n\nHe said that his father had wished him to hold the guardianship and the key to the Kaaba after him. However, if this wish is not honored, the guardianship and the key will be handed over to his uncle Abdulwahab Al-Shaibi.\n\nNizar Al-Shaibi, the cousin of the deceased, told Arab News that it was a sad day for the family. However, the outpouring of love, solidarity, and support from all segments of society, who had rushed to offer their condolences, had helped to ease the burden of their grief.\n\nThey had expressed their gratitude for the life of the deceased, who had dedicated his life to the guardianship of the Kaaba and enhancing its reverence.\n\nThe General Presidency for the Affairs of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque mourned the death of Sheikh Dr. Saleh bin Zain Al-Abidin Al-Shaibi.\n\nIt said in a statement: “With hearts content with God’s decree, the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque and all its employees extend their deepest condolences to the family of the deceased, Sheikh Dr. Saleh bin Zain Al-Abidin Al-Shaibi, the senior caretaker of the Holy Kaaba.”\n\nKhaled Al-Husseini, a writer and expert on Makkah’s affairs, expressed his deep sorrow over the death.\n\nAl-Husseini described Al-Shaibi as a man of knowledge and learning, who, alongside his honored role in the guardianship of the Kaaba, was a scholar, academic, and lecturer at Umm Al-Qura University. He had generously shared his knowledge with successive generations which had benefited from his expertise over 20 years.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia welcomed the US, Egypt and Qatar inviting Israel and Hamas to resume Gaza ceasefire negotiations on Aug. 15, the Kingdom’s foreign ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe Kingdom confirmed its complete support for the continued efforts of President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and address the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the territory.\n\nThe Kingdom stresses the need to stop the bloodshed, end the suffering, protect civilians, and move forward to end the Israeli occupation, achieve peace and security, and give the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights.\n\nThe following is the statement issued by the leaders of the US, Egypt, and Qatar on Thursday:\n\n“It is time to bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. The time has come to conclude the ceasefire and hostages and detainees release deal.\n\nThe three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude. This agreement is based on the principles as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024, and endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2735.\n\nThere is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\n\nAs mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\n\nWe have called on both sides to resume urgent discussion on Thursday, August 15 in Doha or Cairo to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay.”\n\nMADINAH: The Madinah Book Fair this year attracted about 170,000 visitors, drawn by the presence of more than 300 publishing houses and local, Arab and international agencies.\n\nThe third staging of the exhibition featured more than 200 pavilions, with visitors from the Madinah region and beyond contributing to a 22 percent increase in numbers compared with the previous edition, the Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nThe exhibition was held from July 30 to Aug. 5 at King Salman International Convention and Exhibition Center in Madinah.\n\nThis year, the fair coincided with the summer school vacation, resulting in a significant leap in attendees, particularly students, families and book enthusiasts. The event offered a diverse and rich cultural program with the latest literary, cognitive, scientific and Islamic publications on display.\n\nThe event reflected a new vision and a distinct identity, aligned with the latest developments in the publishing industry in the Kingdom. This initiative builds upon the successes of the two previous editions and underscores Madinah’s cultural significance in the Saudi cultural scene.\n\nThe fair is part of the strategic “Book Fairs” initiative, which aims to empower the publishing industry, enhance cognitive and cultural awareness, improve quality of life, and contribute to national economic growth in line with the goals of the National Strategy for Culture outlined in Saudi Vision 2030.\n\nRIYADH: The Saudi Embassy in the US called on its citizens to remain cautious against the aftermath of Hurricane Debby, which was downgraded to a tropical depression on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, the embassy said: “In light of the declaration of a state of emergency in a number of states expected to be affected in the coming hours as a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Debby, the embassy calls on its citizens in the states of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to take precaution and abide by the local authorities’ instructions.”\n\nThe remnants of Debby churned through the US mid-Atlantic toward New England on Friday, bringing heavy rains that could trigger flash flooding from Maryland to Vermont before the onetime hurricane blows out to sea this weekend.\n\nThe US National Weather Service issued flood warnings and tornado watches for parts of an area stretching from coastal Georgia to Vermont, as the storm moved northeast at 56 km an hour, considerably faster than earlier in the week.\n\nThe storm, which was downgraded to a post-tropical depression, was centered near the border of central Pennsylvania and New York state late on Friday morning.\n\nDebby, a slow-moving storm for most of the week, has dropped as much as 63cm of rain on its march north and killed at least eight people."
