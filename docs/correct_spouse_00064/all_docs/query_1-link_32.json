After a stint in the United States Navy, Bramlett moved to Los Angeles, California, in the early 1960s where he established himself as a singer-songwriter, writing with fellow musicians Joey Cooper, Mac Davis, and Jackie DeShannon. By 1965, Bramlett was a regular member of the Shindogs, the house band of the television show, Shindig!. During this time, he worked with J.J.

Clapton still credits Delaney for pushing him to sing and teaching him the art of rock vocals. Bramlett produced King Curtis' last LP, which had two hit singles: \"Teasin'\" and \"Lonesome Long Way from Home\".\n\nBramlett taught then Beatle George Harrison to play slide guitar, which led into a gospel jam that resulted in Harrison's hit \"My Sweet Lord\". Bramlett wrote, recorded, or appeared on stage with many notable performers, including Joe Cocker, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Billy Preston, John Lennon, The Everly Brothers, Spooner Oldham, Steve Cropper and Billy Burnette.

In 2008, the year of his death, Bramlett released his first CD in six years, A New Kind of Blues.\n\nThe Bramlett's \"Never Ending Song of Love\" has been covered by others, and appears on the soundtrack of RV and A Good Year. Bramlett co-wrote the Eric Clapton hit, \"Let It Rain\".\n\nOn January 18, 2011, Bramlett was inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.\n\nDeath\n\nDescribed in an obituary as a \"Southern Legend\", Bramlett died from complications of gall bladder surgery on December 27, 2008, in Los Angeles, California. Delaney was survived by his widow, Susan Lanier-Bramlett, a brother, John Wayne Bramlett, three daughters, Michele Bramlett, Suzanne Bramlett, Bekka Bramlett, a stepson, Dylan Thomas, and two grandchildren.\n\nWide Thumb\n\nClearart\n\nFanart\n\nBanner\n\nUser Comments"
