        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) ” Singer-songwriter-producer Delaney Bramlett, who penned classic rock songs such as “Let it Rain” and worked with musicians George Harrison and Eric Clapton, has died. He was 69.\n\nBramlett died Saturday shortly before 5 a.m. at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles as a result of complications from gall-bladder surgery, his wife Susan Lanier-Bramlett said.\n\nBorn in Mississippi, Bramlett enjoyed a career in the music business that spanned 50 years.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for standards such as “Superstar,” co-written with Leon Russell, which was recorded by Usher, Luther Vandross, Bette Midler, The Carpenters and most recently, Sonic Youth, in a version featured on the Grammy-nominated soundtrack of the movie “Juno.”\n\nHe also co-wrote “Let it Rain” with British guitarist Clapton, who also recorded it, and “Never Ending Song of Love,” which was recorded by more than 100 artists including Ray Charles, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Patty Loveless and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nDuring his career, he performed, co-wrote or recorded with stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, Dave Mason, Billy Preston, the Everly Brothers and Mac Davis. He also produced artists including Etta James and Elvin Bishop.\n\nHe recently released an album “A New Kind of Blues,” on independent label Magnolia Gold Records.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, three daughters: Michele Bramlett, Suzanne Bramlett and Bekka Bramlett-Britt, a son Dylan Thomas, and a brother John Bramlett. Services are pending."
