        "text": "Delaney Bramlett was a successful studio musician and Bonnie Lynn O'Farrell was the only white member of Ike Turner's Ikettes when they met in Los Angeles in 1967. The couple married that week and formed a soulful, rootsy band that hosted a rotating line-up of stellar guest musicians who included Jim Keltner, Bobby Keyes, Leon Russell, and Gram Parsons, among others. The group made six albums, had two charting singles, co-wrote songs for others, and toured extensively with numerous artists in the late '60s (including good friend Eric Clapton), but their musical tenure and marriage ended in 1972. Neither artist's solo career was as influential as their combined efforts, although Bonnie enjoyed some success as an actress and Delaney continued as a top-notch session man."
