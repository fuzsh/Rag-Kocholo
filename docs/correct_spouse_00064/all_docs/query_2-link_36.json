He was 69.\n\nBramlett died Saturday shortly before 5 a.m. at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles as a result of complications from gall-bladder surgery, said his wife, Susan Lanier-Bramlett,\n\nBorn in Mississippi, Bramlett enjoyed a career in the music business that spanned 50 years.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for standards such as “Superstar,” co-written with Leon Russell.
