        "text": "Delaney & Bonnie and Friends\n\nReissue\n\nDelaney & Bonnie and Friends\n\nD&B Together (Columbia /Legacy) Mississippi's Delaney Bramlett and ex-Ikette Bonnie Lynn O'Farrell were well-steeped in roots music when they married in the late Sixties. Both Home and Accept No Substitute (1969) layered transcendent gospel with rootsy blues-rock and got the attention of Gram Parsons, who recommended them to George Harrison, who played them for Eric Clapton, who dropped everything to tour with them. Delaney & Bonnie and Friends on Tour With Eric Clapton (1970) was a brilliant display of vocal pyrotechnics and musicianship, as well as the blueprint for Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs & Englishmen. By 1971, marital problems meant the end was near, and the following year's ironically titled D&B Together was their last, a potent mix of white-lightning rock and gospel blues, with Dave Mason's \"Only You Know and I Know\" opening. Bonnie's revival-tent roots meet Delaney's songwriting in \"Wade in the River of Jordan\" head on; she had her touch with songwriting, too, \"Coming Home\" being co-authored with Clapton, but her moment came on the incandescent \"Superstar,\" written with Leon Russell and covered by Bette Midler and Karen Carpenter. Delaney's \"Are You a Beatle or a Rolling Stone?\" is a punchy retort to \"Superstar,\" while Bonnie's \"I Know How It Feels to Be Lonely\" is torchy smooth. After the hits, most of Together's 18 tunes are high-octane filler (\"Move 'Em Out,\" \"Big Change Comin'\"); the six bonus tracks are from the couple's respective solo albums, soulful but less distinguished. Delaney & Bonnie gave the world a unique sound that reverberated in the unlikeliest of ears. They were rootsy when rootsy wasn't cool.\n\nA note to readers: Bold and uncensored, The Austin Chronicle has been Austinâs independent news source for over 40 years, expressing the communityâs political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene.
