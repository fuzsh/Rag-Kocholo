        "text": "Interview Done By Mike Wilkerson\n\nMW: Please introduce yourself?\n\nTA: Hello ya all I’m Teri Allen from CMT’s Redneck Island and Redneck Rehab I am 35 years old and Live in Orange Springs Florida …love Florida for many reasons but most of all the Stand Your Ground law!! I am very very into guns!\n\nMW: How did you get cast to be on Redneck Island?\n\nTA: To this day I still have no idea how I was picked for the show I was called out of the blue by a producer from CMT asking if I would be interested in doing a reality show and I was like who the hell is this cause I never signed up for anything like this. I didn’t believe him until after my Skype interview that this was for real!\n\nMW: What did you think when you got off the safari truck with everyone?\n\nTA: When we got off the safari truck and was FINALLY able to speak to one another I was sizen everyone up and thought to myself “yep I go this and seen the threats of Bobo and Jenn right off the bat”\n\nMW: Did you know Steve Austin was going to be the host?\n\nTA: No we did not know who the hell our host was gonna be. After our hike down the side of the damn mountain…lol..we came to the camp where there was a tub of beer with a note in a piece of wood that said welcome signed S. A. we are all like who the hell is this…we all wanted to thank this person for the nice ice cold beer after our hike!\n\nMW: How was it getting to hang out with Steve?\n\nTA: Steve Austin has to be one of the most down to earth guys I have ever met he treated everyone like we have known him for years and always had a smile on his face “bigger one when he had a beer in hand” but always asked how everyone was doing. Hell to this day I get sporadic phone calls just checken on me to see how I am doing after the show…that is so awesome!\n\nMW: Give me a good Steve Austin story?\n\nTA: Hum good Steve story… I will say the look in Steve’s face after he took me for a ride on the 4wheeler and when I got off I stood up and said” Aint no one that can’t say that I didn’t have Steve Austin between my legs” lol..He looked at me and said TERI family show…lol with a big smirk and laugh…another one is when I was able to show Steve how good I was with a gun..He was very impressed and the praise he gave me praise I was like HELL yeah!!\n\nMW: Who did you like to hang out with?\n\nTA: I hung out with Bobo pretty much most of the time, I’m not saying I didn’t like hanging out with everyone but I am not a drama kinda chick so I didn’t want any part of the drama. So me and Bobo just stuck with one another!\n\nMW: Who did you not like to hang with?\n\nTA: …Not like to hang with…I would have to say my least favorite person to hang with was Catherine she is just a very needy person and well if you ain’t kissen her lil ass then you don’t like her or you’re talking about her so I just stayed clear of her.\n\nMW: Did you all only get to eat and drink what we saw on the show?\n\nTA: YES! Our diet was….spam, corn, peas(disgusting would rather starve) beans, soups, eggs, Seagull, Monitor Lizard, and fish then when we bought the other food from Steve..But all was good I am a redneck gal and I love me some fried spam!! And let me tell ya the Seagull surprised me…that shit tasted like steak…never thought a seagull would of been red meat…it was and it was very tasty!!!\n\nMW: What was your favorite challenge to do?\n\nTA: My favorite challenge would be when me and Bobo was maw and paw at the shotgun wedding we worked very well together when he was blindfolded and I was callen out to him where to shoot worked very well together on that challenge, and I also loved how we whipped the blue teams ass in the puzzle challenge ..I was a police anf fire dispatcher for 16 years I have very good communication skills not to mention a very loud mouth…and very proud of that!\n\nMW: When your beer ballot came up what did you think?\n\nTA: I knew when I didn’t get my mark with the crossbow it was all downhill from there I knew and expected my name to go on the can because challenges were getting more redneck and they all new I was the last redneck standing and if it was anything else with guns I would of tore their asses up!\n\nMW: Were you upset?\n\nTA: No I wasn’t upset with them I was upset with myself I love to shoot guns I am not a big Bow person …and that showed..I was upset cause I know if I would of won that challenge I would of been in the top 2 for sure! I think making it to episode 8 out of 10 was pretty damn good!!\n\nMW: After Redneck Island you and your family were cast for Redneck Rehab. How did that happen?\n\nTA: Again I was contacted by CMT for this show as well because I had such a high fan base from Redneck Island I thought this was awesome that I was able to let my family see a little bite of what I went through on the island for 28 days with cameras on ur every move!\n\nMW: How was it working with Tom Arnold?\n\nTA: Tom Arnold ain’t no Steve Austin that’s for sure…lol…But he was a pretty cool guy also didn’t get to spend a lot of time with him he was only there with us during the intervention.\n\nMW: What is your best story from the show?\n\nTA: My best story from Redneck Rehab was seeing my mom drunk..my mom don’t drink and well she cut loose at the bar she had guys doing body shots(they didn’t show that part) and just seeing her and my sister actually cut loose and have a good time with no worries that was awesome!!\n\nMW: Did the show go the way you wanted to?\n\nTA: Yes the show was great and has done wonders for my family we are defiantly closer now and speak a lot more then we use to…and my sister actually went hunting with my brother n law this past weekend!\n\nMW: Tell me about the monkey in your family?\n\nTA: Willy is our lil capuchin monkey that just loves to drink beer and smoke or eat cigarettes…lol…He is a trip never a dull moment with a monkey running around the house!\n\nMW: What have you done since both shows?\n\nTA: Since both shows I have just been laying low…lol…I opened for Gretchen Wilson at the OEC complex here in Ocala I got to go on stage before her… and I have done some charity functions but other than that just relaxing and waiting on the next thing to come around hopefully my own damn talk show me and Bobo are working on that! Me and Bobo will be doing the redneck mud games in Illinois in July 2013 we are their honored guests so this should be interesting!\n\nMW: What would you like to say in closing?\n\nTA: In closing I want to say thanks to everyone for the support I got during both shows and don’t ever be afraid to be able to tell people YES I AM A REDNECK AND DAMN PROUD! And if ya see me out and about feel free to come up to me I love meeting fans! I am very open on FB you can look me up under Redneck Island’s Teri Allen!!! Thanks for the interview Mike and hope to meet ya some day once things calm down on my end!\n\nInterview Done By Mike Wilkerson\n\nMW: What did you think when you were picked for season 3 of Face Off?\n\nRM: I was thrilled, yet filled with anxiety! I like to take my time with my work, brain storm, do research if possible. Creating solid makeup designs can take weeks, sometimes months, yet on the show we only have two and a half days! It’s crazy! I didn’t know how I was going to handle it. That’s why on the first challenge, I hit the ground running (literally!). I wasn’t going to waste a single second. I gave it my all, and continued to do that on every challenge.\n\nMW: What was going through your mind with the first meet up with everyone?\n\nRM: We all met for the first time at the swimming pool on top of that high-rise (although I had met Alana before working on a project for Danny DeVito). My mind was really focused on what the first challenge might be at that poolside, hoping I wouldn’t have to glue leaves to someone’s head … oh wait, that’s what I ended up doing:/ ! lol\n\nMW: Who was your favorite judge?\n\nRM: During filming, we didn’t really get to interact much with the judges other than what you see on the show. And as tough as all the judges were on me, (and they all were, at one time or another:), they all had something constructive to say, and in the end, their comments made me a better artist. Since the show, I’ve had the chance to get to know them better. As “judgey” as they are on the show, they are all very nice people in real life (yes, even Glenn:). So, I really don’t have a favorite. Actually, come to think of it, Patrick only judged my work on the first challenge, had nothing but positive things to say, then left without any criticism …, so, maybe Patrick was my favorite, lol:)\n\nMW: Was Joe as big a dick as the show showed?\n\nRM: I had no problem at all with Joe, we got along just fine. I really wasn’t that present for the other stuff, I was swamped creating the Robot Baby with Roy, and helping others out when I could.\n\nMW: Who was your favorite contestant to hang with?\n\nRM: My roommates were Jason and Alana, we always cracked each other up. But we all got along great in the house.\n\nMW: Who was your least favorite contestant to hang with?\n\nRM: I don’t have a least favorite. Even when we were irritable from exhaustion, there was something positive to get from hanging with each person.\n\nMW: How was living at the Face Off house?\n\nRM: People don’t get to see the cool people behind the scenes making sure we are okay. We were always well taken care of. Under the structure of the show, we formed a family very quickly. The house had an amazing view, so when stressed, we could just sit outside and look over the city and unwind (if and when there was time!)\n\nMW: What do you think you were cut from Face Off?\n\nRM: As time went on, the judges were interested in me going beyond a style of mine that emerged. I worked as hard as I could, and listened to the judges as best I could. But on the last challenge, my client (Sofia) had a character that incorporated elements of my style the judges were hoping I’d move away from. I chose to honor a child’s design, and risk being eliminated.\n\nMW: Is it bittersweet now?\n\nRM: Sure, I would have loved to have stayed and kept on being challenged, but I was very proud of the monster Sofia and I created. And as I look back over all the challenges, I really enjoyed the results of being pushed so hard.\n\nMW: What have you done since leaving Face Off?\n\nRM: Man it’s been crazy! But my work with Legacy’s Truth campaign has been the most rewarding so far (you can see my strawberry monster transformation here: http://www.thetruth.com/games/flavor-monster-transformation). I lost a dear friend to emphysema many years ago, and working with Truth is a wonderful way to honor her. The tobacco industry isn’t allowed to make fruit flavored cigarettes, yet there are about 45 different fruit flavored tobacco products out there…. mmm, makes you wonder who’s being targeted. Awareness goes a long way. I was happy to read this at nytimes.com\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/opinion/a-ban-on-flavored-tobacco-products.html?_r=0\n\nMaybe more legislators will make a stand like Angel Taveras and Michael A. Solomon of Providence R.I.\n\nMW: What can we expect from you in the future?\n\nRM: Now that the show is airing, I’m happy that people are getting to download and watch my film “The Wishing Well” on their iPhones and iPads (www.thewishingwellmovie.com). I really enjoy directing, whether its live action or animation, so I’m developing an animated series based off of my Dumbleton characters (www.thedumbletons.com). Working with Truth on the Flavor Monster Campaign has been so rewarding, I’d like to participate in more good causes such as this.\n\nMW: What would you like to say in closing?\n\nRM: I almost didn’t do Face Off, out of fear … I thought, what if I can’t do it, what if I make a fool of myself … all the things that stop us from moving ahead. But I learned from friends and family that have passed, life is short. So I said yes, and I made it on Face Off season 3. And yes, at times I made a fool of myself. I attempted doing things I couldn’t do. But I have to say, I had the time of my life. So I say, take a chance, say yes, make a fool of yourself, fall down, pick yourself up, its part of life’s journey. When it’s all said and done, hopefully you can look back and say, that was an awesome trip.\n\nInterview Done By Mike Wilkerson\n\nMW: Please introduce yourself?\n\nCK: Christopher Kelly\n\nMW: How would fans of The Walking Dead TV show on AMC know you?\n\nCK: They probably wouldn’t. I was the first zombie Glen shot in the season 2 finale when he is driving in the green car. If you freeze frame it, you can see me getting a bullet in the head. I was told that you can spot me out because “You’re the eight foot tall zombie.” I’m a tall guy. I’m also the walker behind Glen in s3ep1 biting the fence before Rick barrels through the gates.\n\nMW: How did you get cast as a walker on The Walking Dead?\n\nCK: Picked my name from a hat. Literally If anyone tells you otherwise, they’re lying. There’s nothing to it. I was “cast” because they needed an unusual amount of people. In the industry they call those “cattle calls” because they have to herd us like cows. A friend of mine called me and asked me if I had anything to do for two days and I didn’t, so I was cast. I had never watched the show before the filming and saw it as another industry gig.\n\nMW: Tell me about zombie school?\n\nCK: I didn’t go.\n\nMW: What episodes of season 1 or 2 are you in?\n\nCK: Season 2 finale. It was extremely cold.\n\nMW: You are also in episode 1 “Seed” of season 3 of The Walking Dead. Where can we see you in the episode?\n\nCK: Behind Glen, biting the fence before Rick comes through. I also did a lot of other scenes, but they were all cut.\n\nMW: Will you be in any of the rest of the episodes of season 3?\n\nCK: Every one of them until Ep. 10.\n\nMW: Have you done any conventions as a guest yet?\n\nCK: Hell no. Most of the fellow zombies and I actually frown upon those who do that. We usually make fun of them and say they are just looking for attention. I got into a mild argument with one of the heavily featured zombies and said “You wanna sign an autograph and take a picture, for what? Taking credit for someone else’s make up, growling and being naturally ugly?” They feel like they are entitled to something. Give me a break. A lot of the nicknames you see for the various zombies were started by the zombies themselves. The conventions are a bunch of bull to me and I find it unprofessional. The real people who should be doing any of that are the KNB team. They are amazing and the best crew I have ever worked with.\n\nMW: What new conventions will you be at?\n\nCK: None. Won’t do them or ever will.\n\nMW: Who is the coolest actor on The Walking Dead to work with?\n\nCK: They all are actually. Very nice and polite. Every time I’ve worked, they always come up and say hello, thanks for coming out, etc. The guy who plays T-Dog has the most outgoing personality. He literally knows everyone. It’s unreal. He’ll stop and talk to anyone, and he remembers faces and everything. If you told him about your sick dog, next time he sees you, he’ll say “How is your dog?” and so on.\n\nMW: What else are you doing other then The Walking Dead?\n\nCK: I work as an extra, stand in and photo double for various films and television shows in Georgia. You name the production, I’ve worked on it. I work heavily on The Vampire Diaries too.\n\nMW: What would you like to say in closing?\n\nCK: I love the people at The Walking Dead. Every time I go there, it’s like seeing old friends. We all tell jokes, stories and BS all day. It hardly feels like work, it’s more like a paid vacation. We sign confidentiality agreements, which is why most of the answers are vague and nothing specific. I love working for them and don’t want to disrupt anything. We really are like a big family and I love going there. The food is amazing too.\n\nInterview Done Mike Wilkerson\n\nMW: Please introduce yourself?\n\nAP: Hello – My name is Adam, and I am a Big Brotheraholic!\n\nMW: How did you get cast to be on Season 13 of Big Brother?\n\nAP: After years of my friends saying “You should be on Big Brother” I finally went to an open audition for Season 10. I bombed miserably. I talked about my job, and the city I live in, not about myself. So Season 12 I went back and tried again. This time I was more relaxed and focused on showing them who Adam is & what makes me tick. I got all the way to Finals that year, but got a call about 2 weeks before the show was scheduled to start saying, “thanks, but no thanks. Try again next year” So I started going to the gym, and eating better so I could be in better physical shape for Season 13. When I tried out again, they were impressed by my dedication and my confidence level was through the roof. They could not deny me this time!\n\nMW: What did you think going into the house?\n\nAP: At first I thought “HOLY SH*T! I am in the Big Brother house.” But then when I only saw 7 other people, I knew something was up. Game was on, and I needed to figure out what to do to get to the end of the game.\n\nMW: When the All-Stars were put into the house what did you think?\n\nAP: I knew something was not quite right with just 8 people, and knew more people were coming. I was excited to see Evel Dick & Rachel as they were two of my all-time favorites to watch – but I knew it was going to be a battle competing against them.\n\nMW: Who were you the most excited to meet?\n\nAP: I was so excited to meet Evel Dick. He was / is my all time favorite houseguest and one of the reasons I thought I could get on the show. He was not the typical cookie cutter model that you see on the show every year. Like me, he is a rocker. I could not believe during the first challenge looking over and thinking to myself, I am playing against my hero.\n\nMW: What did you think when Evil Dick had to leave the game?\n\nAP: By the time Dick had left – we were in the house for almost a week and the house was already divided newbie’s vs. vets. Him leaving was sad on one hand, because I knew how much he loved the game, but on the other hand, I was excited that we “got rid” of someone on the other side of the house. This should have strengthened the newbie’s because we had better numbers, but alas it did not.\n\nMW: Who while in the Big Brother House did you like to hang out with?\n\nAP: Early on, I loved hanging out with Dominic, Danielle, & Lawon the most. We had some funny times just getting to know each other. Lawon & I could talk about music all day & night. Dominic & I could talk sports, and Danielle was just as sarcastic as I was. I loved trying to say things to freak her out.\n\nMW: Who while in the Big Brother House did you not like to hang out with?\n\nAP: There was really no one I did not like to hang out with. At times everyone got on my nerves – and I am sure I got on other people’s nerves as well. That’s what happens when you are locked up away from your loved ones. If I did not feel like being social, I would find a quiet spot, or take a nap.\n\nMW: What do you think of the Jeff Schroeder controversy?\n\nAP: I do not know what controversy you are speaking of. From a fans perspective – which I know very well – people criticize every move people make inside the house. That’s the fun of being a fan. Sometimes things are said / done that people at home don’t know the whole story and will blow stuff out of proportion. But as a fan going into the house, I knew to be very careful of what words I would say.\n\nMW: What was your favorite HoH to play?\n\nAP: Obviously the Fortune Teller one since I won it. But I loved playing in all of them, Even the ones I sucked at (which were most of them) – because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to be in the house and compete.\n\nMW: What was your favorite Have and Have Not to play?\n\nAP: All of the Have / Have Not’s were brutal. Getting milked by Keith was no fun. being in the ant suit with Dominic was worse (I still have scars on my knees). And the drinking the blended crap was HORRIBLE!\n\nMW: What was your favorite VETO to play?\n\nAP: Big Brother Odyssey (week 5) & OTEV (week 9). Big Brother Odyssey was a very close battle between me & Jeff. The editing did not show that we were trading off the lead back and forth on our way to getting 300 points. I would be up by 4 or 5, and then he’d go on a run and go up by a few. Back and forth we went – and he eventually won 300 – 298. That showed me that I can compete with anyone in the house at any given game. I impressed myself and some of the other houseguests. OTEV was great not just because I won – but because that is a fun challenge to play in. You need to use your brains to figure out the clue, and then find the correct answer and race to get back.\n\nMW: What did you think of Pandora’s Box?\n\nAP: I never was presented with a Pandora’s Box – but I do know that NO ONE in the history of the game has ever NOT taken the box. Its part of the game now for the past few seasons – so you take the good and the bad!\n\nMW: What did you think when Tori Spelling walked into the Big Brother house?\n\nAP: I could not believe it was really her. I mean, my summer was already a dream come true, walking into the house, playing the game, celebrating my 40th birthday. But to add to it meeting my favorite celebrity of all time? Are you kidding me? I will never in my life forget that moment!\n\nMW: How was it eating SLOP?\n\nAP: HORRIBLE – it’s so nasty. Thankfully I was only a have-not once all summer!\n\nMW: You were 3rd. to last to be evicted. Could you have done anything different to make it to the end?\n\nAP: If I did anything different before the final 3, who knows if I would have gotten to the final 3. In the final 3 – if I would have won part 2 of the final HoH – there is no doubt in my mind I would have won part 3. I spent the summer getting to know all of my fellow houseguest to prepare for the Q & A at the end, and sitting in the kitchen listening to the questions on finale night, I got 4 out of 5 right – and Rachel only got 2. Now if the jury would have voted for me – we’ll never know. Afterwards it sounded like they probably wouldn’t have, but like I said – we will never know.\n\nMW: Do you think you would ever play Big Brother again?\n\nAP: It’s not up to me to decide right now. I lived my dream by getting on – i am not going to harass the producers / casting people to put me back in. If they &/or the fans want me back – then I would consider it – but as of now I am happy that i had the chance to play once.\n\nMW: What have you done since Big Brother?\n\nAP: I have gotten very involved in charity work. I have raised money & volunteered my time for various Cancer events, ALS events, and other great causes. I would like to do my own event at some point. I was also on Travel Channel’s show BACON PARADISE 2 with my friend Wesley who owns a Bacon Bakery in NYC called the Baconery. But other than that, back to my normal routine of work, concerts, food events, hosting trivia nights, sporting events, and spending time with my friends and family. I am currently planning my wedding this spring with my fiancé Fara. She was so supportive of me the entire time I was going through the process of getting on the show, while I was in the house, and now when we do these charity events. I am so lucky to have such a wonderful girl by my side through it all.\n\nMW: What would you like to say in closing?\n\nAP: I am living proof that fans of reality shows can get on reality shows – so never give up on your dreams. But only you can make it happen!

I was in the memoriam on ‘The Talking Dead’ as “Later Walker”. I was in the season 3 opening_ yeah i was the eyeball and the body behind it, heheh. Wasn’t expecting all that!\n\nMW: How did you get cast as a walker on The Walking Dead?\n\nMM: I had recently moved back from California and looking for work, started working on different movie sets and friends kept saying that i really needed to submit for this, so I did.\n\nMW: Tell me about zombie school?\n\nMM: I didn’t go to Zombie School– I played hooky from school, heheh.\n\nMW: What episodes of season 1 or 2 are you in?\n\nMM: The only episode of season 1 or 2 was the season 2 finale. And it was the best set, hands down, ever-in every way!! I have been on a lot of sets I really don’t know how that came about, it just did.\n\nMW: You are also in episode 1 “Seed” of season 3 of The Walking Dead. Where can we see you in the episode?\n\nMM: In the very beginning-it starts off on an eye kind of spiraling out–that was me!\n\nMW: You have the pleasure of being the last walker killed in season 2 and first walker seen and killed in season 3. How did that come about?\n\nMM: I really don’t know how that came about, it just did–I don’t question the cool stuff!! Still, I’m kind of in shock about the s.3 opener\n\nMW: What have people been saying about you being the first walker in season 3?\n\nMM: They are as stunned as I am! I knew it was going to be cool, but certainly wasn’t prepared for all of that.\n\nMW: Will you be in any of the rest of the episodes of season 3?\n\nMM: We will have to see, I’m not allowed to divulge that info.\n\nMW: Have you done any conventions as a guest yet?\n\nMM: I have not, but was just offered something, might be cool. I am pretty much game for the conventions and what not. I have friends who travel and do that sort of thing.\n\nMW: Who is the coolest actor on The Walking Dead to work with?\n\nMM: The coolest actor, hmm- I would have to say, in all honesty, all of them–they are all super-cool, treat you like family. That is the big theme on that set, and it’s my favorite set ever! Great crews and they have it so dialed in; it speaks volumes about the people involved, in my opinion!\n\nMW: What else are you doing other then The Walking Dead?\n\nMM: I have worked on just a few things this year, all a part of important history to me.. I am in a few scenes in ‘Flight’ comes out nov.2nd with Denzel–that should be really good- ’42’ the Jackie Robinson story, about crossing the racial barriers in baseball. ‘Ring of Fire-The June Carter Cash story’ w/ Jewel. One ‘secret movie’ going on right now that I am not allowed to mention the name of. Oh yeah, ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’ w/ Kate Husdon. That is about it.\n\nMW: What would you like to say in closing?\n\nMM: In closing, I just want to say hats off to Greg N. and his crew. He and his people are so professional, positive, and a pleasure to be around. They definitely create the family atmosphere. I have made some really good friends from this set and hope to continue. This looks to be an awesome season and I’m looking forward to it. I was and still am a fan!! That makes it a little weird, but a good weird"
