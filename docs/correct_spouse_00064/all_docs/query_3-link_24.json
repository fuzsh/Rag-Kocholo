        "text": "I just picked up the new expanded version of \"Motel Shot\" and the liner notes quote Jac Holzman as referring to Delaney as a \"Scumbag\". It seems that most times I read about Delaney he seems to not be remembered too fondly by his peers. I don't know that much about the man's life other than a few passing comments I've read about how difficult he was to work with. Anybody have anymore info on this? I'd be interested in hearing it.\n\nWell, it is not proper to speak ill of the dead.\n\nHowever, in his book Bobby has much negative to say about Delaney as it relates to just about everything from Bonnie, family members, fellow musicians,\n\npets, etc. He did not sound like a very decent human being. Since reading that book, I've seen or read other comments that seem to corroborate Bobby's observations.\n\nI did not know Bobby Whitlock had a book. So Bobby Whitlock's wife Coco Carmel used to be married to Delaney Bramlett?\n\nYikes. I should have done a better job conveying my thoughts. I was not implying that people should not speak ill of the dead. I used that as a possible explanation as to why Bobby Whitlock has backed off on negative comments about Delaney since his passing. Sorry about that.\n\nPersonally, I have no respect for the man. I have read about wife beating, shorting musicians out of money, being mean to animals, to name a few. This guy spent the better part of his adult life taking advantage of people and being a thorn in the side. There are lots of stories about this guy, all bad."
