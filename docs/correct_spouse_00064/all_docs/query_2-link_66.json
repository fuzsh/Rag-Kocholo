        "text": "best fucking song ever\n\nrip mr bramlett\n\nI had my gall bladder removed and I'm pretty sure the only way you can die from that is the doctor fucking something up. When they did it to me they do it with that microscope or whatever so there's just 3 small cuts, so maybe they did it the old school massive cut way? But it's still sad :( RIP\n\nHow long did it take for you to recover from surgery?\n\nI had to stay at the hospital overnight and then it was about a week at home. When I went back to school, I couldn't do anything beyond like walking in gym class for another month.\n\n(no subject) - schmanda Expand\n\n(no subject) - electrelux Expand\n\n(no subject) - avrillavinge Expand\n\n(no subject) - krm Expand\n\n(no subject) - avrillavinge Expand\n\nWell, I've seen some pretty fucked up things happen due to surgery - the MD never knows just what they will find when they go in there. If the gallbladder was inflamed/infected enough, he could have ended up septic...and that could have killed him.\n\nSometimes, you'll see in the chart that the surgery was supposed to have been done laprascopically, but that it had to be done via abdominal incision. So, I guess something odd could have occured. Whatever the case may be, it's sad, isn't it?\n\n(no subject) - surrenderface Expand\n\nyeah there are a lot more risks with the older surgery. my grandma had it done like 40yrs ago and her scar is fucking huge.\n\ni had mine taken out when i was 14 with the same surgery as you,my scars arent too bad but i hate the one in the center under my boobs its really raised and like an inch and a half long :(\n\nRecovery if someone's 71 and lead a hard life, could be problematic after any surgical procedure.\n\nI always thought that gall bladder surgery was an outpatient thing. I could be wrong, either way that sucks and so does 2008\n\nDepending on your age and other medical problems, sometimes they make you stay the night. When I had mine done they tried to make me stay the night, but I wouldn't. It took about seven hours in the recovery room before they finally let me go.\n\n2008 was just the beginning IMO\n\nPut your seat belts on for the next couple years cuz they're gonna be brutal.\n\nI'm afraid you might be right. We have a country filled with angry, ignorant rednecks and too many guns whose economy is collapsing that just elected a non-white man as President. Things have the potential to get ugly real quick. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nThat makes two of us. I both look forward too and kind of dread 2009.\n\nI'm sticking with the looking forward too as it is not good to look to a new year wasting on old thoughts.\n\nThis is true, as all the Baby Boomers are now entering the death zone.\n\nRIP :(\n\na lot can happen in 3 days D:\n\nHow does someone die of gall bladder surgery?\n\nYou can die from any type of surgery bb. Especially when anesthesia is used as well.\n\nRIP :(\n\nhe was so talented\n\nRIP :(\n\nRIP\n\nHow does someone die of gall bladder surgery?\n\nIt doesn't really tell you if he had any other medical conditions apart from the busted gallbladder...sometimes a person's heart or lungs aren't in a condition to really operate but the doctors have to take a chance. My grandfather had a bad heart, lungs, the works, and he was in no condition to go into surgery for a hernia but he had no other choice, and technically that operation killed him.\n\nin before the fuck 2008 comments\n\nnever mind :(\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - x_unitydivides Expand\n\nHmm, I'm not sure but maybe complications with the doctor or with his liver?\n\nfuck you 2009\n\nGive it a chance!\n\nlol\n\nlol"
