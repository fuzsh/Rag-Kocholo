        "text": "Mr Groove is:\n\nTim Smith, bass guitar, and producer\n\nRoddy Smith, guitar\n\nTim Gordon, saxes\n\nSteve Willets, piano\n\nMark Stallings, Hammond B3 organ\n\nDonnie Marshall, drums\n\nOne of the top ten albums of the year, according to\n\nGritz at Swampland Music\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nA couple of choice reviews follow, from the many complimentary ones we've seen:\n\n1. \"A legendary vocalist re-emerges with one of her best efforts ever\"\n\nEarnest upstart jazz label Zoho couldn't have chosen a better artist to christen their new roots label than the legendary Bonnie Bramlett. Anyone who has heard her dusky, sensuous voice will know she is more than able to take a song in any style and make it completely her own. The real question is, why has she stayed away from the music scene for so long and why has she chosen now to come back? On the other hand, as long as she's singing this good, does it really matter?\n\nThose under thirty might not remember how influential she and her then-husband Delaney Bramlett were back in the late '60's and early '70's. Right in the music mix with the biggest English rock stars like Clapton, Joe Cocker and Traffic, Delaney and Bonnie helped organize one of the biggest rock tours of their day and also released several great albums that ended up being FM staples for many years. Eventually, their musical and personal union broke up and the two went their separate ways. While both stayed in music for a time, eventually both faded from view, the sum of their parts apparently greater than the two of them individually.\n\nAfter a few acting stints, most notably as a frequent guest star on the Roseanne sitcom, and more than thirty years after her heyday, Bonnie Bramlett is back to prove she hasn't lost one teeny bit of her vocal power and also to remind everyone in this Pro-tools, auto-tuned world that there's still some vocalists who can still sing, dammit. Together with her band, a fresh crew of Southern soul upstarts who probably weren't even born when Bramlett was first on the charts, Bramlett seeks to reclaim her soul diva crown from the current crop of neo-soul (how about neo-suck?) youngsters who try to sing pure soul music but can't quite seem to get the job done like the veteran\n\nFrom blues to ballads to uptempo soul-funk, this album has a little bit of everything Bramlett does well. Despite her age her vocal powers are still as supple as ever and her phrasing is sublime as well. I may be going out on a limb but maybe everything she has done in the past, including her almost thirty-year hibernation out of the public eye, was all in preparation of this fine album. She sure sings as if she has had tons of emotion bottled up in her for a long time and does it with a joy that is infectious. She seems to be having as much fun singing as I am having listening to her songs. Acquiring her early records long after she had exited stage right, this set reminds me why I had loved those so much.\n\nThose who appreciate true soul music sung and performed by artists who know how to do it right will no doubt love this album. Fans of '70's rock music who have wondered what happened to one of the great vocalists of the period will welcome this album as well. Hopefully this is just the beginning of another long chapter in Bramlett's career. Either way, this album is a thrilling tour de force and one that I am sure will be staying in my CD changer for many weeks to come.\n\nScott Homewood\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nBonnie Bramlett and Mr. Groove Band\n\nRoots, Blues & Jazz (Zoho)\n\nSinger Bonnie Bramlett not only revisits her rock and soul roots on this spirited recording, she also interprets various jazz standards well suited to her bluesy style. Bramlett’s voice sounds an octave lower and a tad smokier than it was during the 1970s, but it still packs a soulful wallop.\n\nWith this follow-up to her 2002 comeback release I’m Still the Same, Bramlett sings with confidence drawn from experience. At age 15 she became the first white Ikette backing Ike and Tina Turner. In 1967 she married Delaney Bramlett, and together they formed the blue-eyed soul duo Delaney & Bonnie. On a European tour, the pair fronted a dream band whose members included Eric Clapton and George Harrison. Bramlett later embarked on a successful solo career, and in the ’90s landed a recurring role on the TV sitcom “Rosanne.”\n\nBacked by the versatile six-piece ensemble Mr. Groove, Bramlett belts out the first two rollicking numbers like it’s 1969 again. Then the music turns jazzy. Chuck Berry’s “No Particular Place to Go” begins as a cool-jazz tune and ends as a snazzy swinger. A gospel-influenced cover of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” seems appropriate since its composer, Joe Zawinul, was one of the first to recognize Bramlett’s potential as a jazz singer. A spine-tingling take on Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come” is the album’s centerpiece, while smoldering versions of “I’m Confessin’” and “Harlem Nocturne” are offset by uptempo tracks like “Work Song” and the original finger-snapper “Gotcha.” Two other solid originals are also included.\n\nUnlike Rod Stewart’s bloated renditions of standards, Bramlett’s arrangements remain true to her R&B background, and the end result is a fine album.\n\nEd Kopp\n\n'The Guardian' - Film Reviews & News\n\nST. PETERSBURG TIMES\n\n\"Bonnie Bramlett is phenomenal as the crusty owner of a blues bar where the guys hang out; the role gives us several chances to hear her glorious singing.\" (St. Petersburg Times)\n\nPITTSBURG TRIBUNE - REVIEW\n\n\"There's a particularly affecting scene involving barmaid Bonnie Bramlett that should have had her in awards contention.\" by Ed Blank, Pittsburg Tribute-Review, January 25, 2007\n\nTHE SHREVEPORT TIMES\n\nTHE GUARDIAN premier and Bonnie Bramlett photo:\n\nTONAWANDA NEWS\n\nREVIEWS: Crowd-pleasing 'Guardian far from all wet\n\nAre you intrigued by the sequences in The Perfect Storm in which Coast Guard rescue teams attempt to save storm-tossed sailors? If so, youll be pleased that The Guardian tells a more-detailed story about people like them, courageous folks who are willing to jump into cold, rough seas to try to save human lives.\n\nThe action-packed, water-drenched, crowd-pleasing film stars Kevin Costner as Ben Randall, a veteran rescuer near the end of his Coast Guard career, and Aston Kutcher as Jake, the young Coast Guardsman to whom Ben may one day pass the torch.\n\nThe men meet at the Coast Guards rescue school, where Ben reluctantly teaches classes after being grounded by injuries and age, and where Jake is a cocky, hot-shot swimming champion who is eager to wipe Bens rescue records off the wall.\n\nThe beginning and end of The Guardian feature several riveting, well-staged rescues. Were introduced to Ben as he valiantly saves storm victims in a riveting opening sequence. By the films end, Ben and Jake are together in the heaving water, again in an attempt to rescue folks in trouble. Director Andrew Davis (an action drama veteran, thanks to The Fugitive and The Package) brings intensity and reality to the scenes, though were given at least one too many rescue sequences. The overly long Guardian offers more than one ending; youll swear the credits were about to roll at least twice before they finally do.\n\nMeanwhile, the films vast middle portion will remind filmgoers of An Officer and a Gentleman and other boot-camp sagas, telling of young recruits trying to get through the rigors of an elite military program.\n\nBoth actors are well cast. Costner projects the courage and determination of a life-long rescuer, along with the frustrations of not being able to sustain a family life, and with the encroachment of age and injury. And, as the seemingly arrogant student, Kutcher lets out just enough vulnerability for filmgoers to understand hes an emotionally wounded young man who needs to mature.\n\nTheyre ably supported by Melissa Sagemiller and Sela Ward as the women in Jakes and Bens lives, and Brian Geraghty and Dule Hill as fellow students at the rescue school.\n\nSpecial kudos to Bonnie Bramlett, a legendary blues-rock performer of the 60s and 70s who appears here as a mother-confessor bartender and still-rockin saloon singer.\n\nThree stars out of four.\n\nTHE COLUMBUS DISPATCH\n\nThe Guardian  After losing his crew in a storm at sea, a Coast Guard rescuer (Kevin Costner) becomes an instructor and takes on an arrogant recruit (Ashton Kutcher). The latest in an endless line of mentorstudent training dramas was directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive). Singer Bonnie Bramlett pops up as an entertainer in the requisite off-duty club that everyone visits in the PG-13 adventure.\n\nTHE STATE, COLUMBIA, SC\n\nSinger serves it up: Bonnie Bramlett, who plays Kevin Costners bartender friend in The Guardian, is no stranger to sharing the stage with big-name celebrities. She was a member of the 19nd, Delaney Bramlett. Some of the well-known friends to perform with Bramlett include Eric Clapton and George Harrison. She still continues to write and tour as a solo act. Bramlett also appeared as a bartender in The Doors (1991).\n\nNatasha Derrick\n\nORLANDO SENTINEL\n\nBut wait. It's also The Right Stuff, as Costner's Randall copes with inner demons, legends of a spirit of the deep, a failing marriage (to Helen, played by Sela Ward) and a grizzled lady bartender (folk rocker Bonnie Bramlett in a nice turn) who relates life lessons to the old guy and the old guy's legend to his students.\n\nST. PETERSBURG TIMES\n\nAn officer and a 'Guardian'\n\nKevin Costner's new film has quite a familiar ring, but it's somewhat redeemed by good performances and action scenes.\n\nBy MARTY CLEAR\n\nPublished September 28, 2006\n\nIt's basically An Officer and a Gentleman, only wet. And cold. In Kevin Costner's comeback movie, The Guardian, there's a hotshot recruit in an elite military training program. He's arrogant and doesn't want to be a team player. The tough veteran officer dislikes him and tries to drive him out of the service with grueling physical punishment, but the two end up respecting and even liking each other.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotshot starts dating an attractive but hardened local woman. She doesn't want to get serious because she knows these trainees always leave as soon as they finish school.\n\nIt's a pretty blatant ripoff of a plot that was formulaic to begin with.\n\nStill, thanks to appealing performances by Costner and Ashton Kutcher - and a lot of rousing action scenes - The Guardian ends up being satisfying but disposable entertainment.\n\nHere Costner is Ben Randall, a superstar Coast Guard rescue swimmer. These are the people who drop from helicopters in cold, stormy seas (the setting is Alaska) to help people who have been thrown off boats and ships.\n\nAfter a tragedy he is powerless to avoid, Randall, aging but still effective, is assigned to train new recruits, including Jake Fischer (Kutcher), a champion high school swimmer.\n\nFischer is brash and cares more about breaking Randall's records than saving lives. Randall has no patience with Fischer's ego.\n\nMeanwhile, (surprise!) Randall's marriage is on the rocks because he cares more about strangers in distress than his wife, and Fischer is driven by a dark secret.\n\nThe story is punctuated with a palpable sense of the harrowing rescues. These guys drop into seas with waves so high that huge ships are tossed about. They enter burning, sinking ships to rescue trapped sailors.\n\nThose scenes are exciting, but they're all kind of the same, with churning seas and driving nighttime storms. And we never really get a sense of what drives people to take such unpleasant and dangerous work (other than the too-facile revelation of Fischer's secret).\n\nThere are lots of peripheral roles, and all the actors are quite engaging. Bonnie Bramlett is phenomenal as the crusty owner of a blues bar where the guys hang out; the role gives us several chances to hear her glorious singing. (Baby boomers may remember Bramlett as the co-leader of Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, an R&B band that included Eric Clapton.)\n\nSo, for the first two hours, there's enough artistry to assuage the triteness. But then, in the last few minutes, things crumble. The climax is clumsily telegraphed, and the denouement is as hokey as anything you've ever seen in a major movie. It leaves a serious scar on an otherwise solid action flick.\n\nClick here for more information on The Guardian."
