        "text": "After a long, cranky-pants day at the office, my partner and I threw together dinner tonight. As is custom in our house, a record was spinning during meal prep. My partner is deejaying our friends’ wedding at the end of the month and scored a Motown anthology on vinyl at Half-Price. The Miracles’ “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me” came on and while we don’t think its self-destructive lyrics are wedding-appropriate, we danced anyway. Irresistible pop songs can have that effect on people.\n\nThis got me to thinking about Roseanne, a show I previously earlier intimated a love for on this blog. I was specifically thinking about a moment in season three’s “Scenes from a Barbecue” when the titular heroine invited folks over for a BBQ. At some point, her husband Dan (played by the incomparable John Goodman) breaks out the guitar and the group starts singing “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.” One friend in attendance is Bonnie Watkins, Roseanne Conner’s partner in crime from waiting tables at a mall restaurant. It’s established that Bonnie is in a relationship with struggling musician Duke, played by David Crosby. But she’s a musician in her own right too, even if she’s not slugging it out in buses and bars. She proves as much when she belts out the classic song, leaving the gang slacked-jawed. Let’s see how you feel about her performance.\n\nThat’s some whisky-throated alto, innit? For good measure, let’s see the TV couple tear up Danny Sheridan’s “Roll On Down” in season four’s “The Bowling Show.”\n\nI couldn’t remember the name of the actress, but my partner did a little digging on IMDB and was like, “you know, Bonnie Bramlett? From Delaney & Bonnie? They were in Vanishing Point? Why don’t we have any of their albums?”\n\nA fair question and a worthy investigation. Because I’m clearly going to need more Bonnie Bramlett in my life. Maybe you will too."
