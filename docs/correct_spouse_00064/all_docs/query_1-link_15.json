        "text": "Delaney Bramlett Dead at 69\n\nPosted: Dec 28, 2008\n\nLegendary singer/songwriter/guitarist/producer Delaney Bramlett died early Saturday morning, December 27, 2008 at 4:55 a.m. at the age of 69. Delaney passed away in a Los Angeles hospital as a result of complications following gallbladder surgery, according to his wife Susan Bramlett.\n\nDelaney was born in Mississippi, and wrote and performed music professionally for over 50 years. He is perhaps best known for his work with former wife Bonnie in Delaney & Bonnie & Friends, a rotating lineup of stellar musicians that sometimes featured Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Leon Russell, Dave Mason and Duane Allman, to name a few. Delaney & Bonnie got their big break in 1969 when asked to open the Blind Faith tour.\n\nAs a songwriter, Delaney wrote or co-wrote such treasures as “Never Ending Song of Love,” “Let it Rain,” and “Only You Know & I Know.” His songs have been covered by everyone from Eric Clapton to Ray Stevens, The Everly Brothers, Crystal Gayle, the duo of Conway Twitty & Loretta Lynn, Lester Flatt, Dickey Lee and more.\n\nFormer wife Bonnie Bramlett, now a Nashville resident, is a powerhouse solo performer with a new album called Beautiful, and their daughter Bekka spent four years touring as part of Fleetwood Mac and has become one of Nashville’s in-demand vocalists and songwriters, touring with Faith Hill and recording with Vince Gill.\n\nDuring his career, Delaney performed, co-wrote or recorded with stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, Dave Mason, Billy Preston and Mac Davis. He also produced artists including Etta James, John Hammond, and Elvin Bishop.\n\nHe recently released an album, A New Kind of Blues, on independent label Magnolia Gold Records.\n\nMemorial information will be forthcoming."
