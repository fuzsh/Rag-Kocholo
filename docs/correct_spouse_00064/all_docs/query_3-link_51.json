        "text": "Delaney and Bonnie & Friends: Motel Shot Expanded Edition 2LP was the 7th fan voted title and 8th ROG release pressed on vinyl. Limited to 1,231 LPs worldwide and delivered to stores in January 2018. If you missed out on the pre-order check our store locator to find an authorized Run Out Groove dealer near you.\n\nVinyl info:\n\nThe 2LP was mastered for vinyl by Dave Shultz at D2 with lacquers cut by Jeff Powell at Sam Phillips Recording Studio. 180g black vinyl was pressed at Record Industry in the Netherlands. Gatefold tip-on jackets with 11x11 inserts were manufactured at Stoughton Printing Company.\n\nDetails about the record:\n\nFirst reissue on vinyl since 1971. The ROG edition comes with unique and alternate cover art originally only issued in France and new liner notes. 2LP set includes an additional LP of acoustic outtakes from the sessions, recorded in hotel rooms while the band was on tour and available for the first time on vinyl.\n\nInfo about the band:\n\nDelaney & Bonnie were a pioneering musical duo and married singer-songwriter couple, known as Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett that fronted a rock & soul ensemble called Delaney & Bonnie & Friends in the late 60s and 1970s. The “Friends” part included a laundry list of legendary performers such as Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, George Harrison, Leon Russell, Bobby Whitlock, Dave Mason, Rita Coolidge, King Curtis, and of course, Eric Clapton. Delaney was from Mississippi and was an accomplished guitarist and singer. His earliest work included playing for the Shindig! TV series house band with Leon Russell. Bonnie was from Alton, Illinois, near St. Louis, and was an amazing singer performing with Albert King at 14 and Ike & Tina Turner at 19 years of age. She met and married Delaney when she moved to Los Angeles in 1967. The duo secured a recording contract with Stax in 1969 and released their debut album, Home. Despite excellent production and session assistance from Isaac Hayes and Donald “Duck” Dunn, the album was not successful commercially and suffered similar distribution woes as other Stax albums of the late 60s and early 70s. Delaney & Bonnie signed with Elektra Records for their follow up album, Accept No Substitute, issued in 1969. Despite not selling well, it created a buzz in music industry circles and caught the attention of one George Harrison who offered D&B a contract with Apple Records. The duo signed with Apple despite their prior commitment to Elektra, the Apple contract was voided and this caused tension between the group and Elektra who were eventually released from their contract in late 1969. At the behest of George Harrison, Eric Clapton took Delaney & Bonnie & Friends on the road in mid-1969 as the opening act for Blind Faith. Clapton became good friends with Delaney, Bonnie and their band and preferred their music over what he was doing with Blind Faith. Impressed with their live performance, he would often join them on stage and continued to record and perform with them following the demise of Blind Faith in August of 1969. Clapton helped get the band a record deal with his then-US label, Atco Records and even performed on their third album: On Tour with Eric Clapton. Released in the US in 1970, this would be their most successful release, reaching number 29 on the Billboard album chart and achieving RIAA gold status. Clapton also recruited Delaney & Bonnie and their band to back him on his debut solo album, which was consequently produced by Delaney. The band continued to release well-regarded, modest selling records through their entire career. “Motel Shot” is their fourth studio album released in 1971, their third release for Atco Records and their fifth album overall. The album’s title refers to the impromptu, late-night jam sessions that touring musicians would get into while on the road. The album reached #65 on the Billboard album chart and includes Delaney & Bonnie’s biggest chart single, “Never Ending Song of Love,” which peaked at #13. Guest musicians on the album include Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Duane Allman, Dave Mason, John Hartford, Clarence White, Gram Parsons and Bobby Whitlock. The band attempted to record the impromptu jam session in engineer Bruce Botnick’s living room but ended up doing it over in a recording studio. The performances are mostly acoustic and the song choices are mostly traditional gospel, blues and country standards. Eight of those impromptu, acoustic jam tracks will be included on this deluxe ROG edition for the first time on vinyl if this title wins the popular vote. By late 1971, Delaney & Bonnie’s often tempestuous relationship began to fall apart. Their next album, “Country Life” was rejected by Atco and the label decided to sell their recording contract to CBS including the master tapes to Country Life. The album was released by CBS in 1972 and it would be the duo’s last album of new material. They eventually divorced in 1973. Both went on to release solo albums and Delaney passed away in 2008, only months before releasing his final solo album, “A New Kind of Blues.” Extremely influential before their time, Eric Clapton has been quoted as saying that Delaney Bramlett taught him everything he knew about singing. Delaney has also been cited as teaching George Harrison how to play slide guitar.\n\nQuotes, links to reviews:\n\nhttps://www.analogplanet.com/content/run-out-groove-issues-expanded-delaney-bonnie-and-friends-motel-shot\n\nhttp://www.goldminemag.com/news/delaney-bonnies-motel-shot-voted-next-run-groove-title\n\nhttp://modern-vinyl.com/2018/04/27/review-roundup-a-run-out-groove-rundown/"
