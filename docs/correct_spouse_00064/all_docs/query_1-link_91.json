        "text": "If the Tedeschi-Trucks Band, coming to Summer Camp this weekend, doesn't mean anything to you, think of an 11-piece electric-blues band that marries an Allman Brothers pedigree with a Bonnie Raitt growl.\n\nDerek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi really are married, of course, and they really do make beautiful music together.\n\n\"Music is supposed to be medicinal. It should be uplifting and it should be a tool for relief. That's the point of a band like this,\" Trucks told an interviewer in the May issue of Music & Musicians.\n\nSo get ready for a big dose of what's good for you if you're lucky enough to see this band when they stop in Chillicothe on Sunday as part of a far-reaching North American tour.\n\nNot that touring is anything out of the ordinary for Trucks. Only 32, he already rates as a road warrior. \"I started playing when I was nine. My dad traveled with me until I was 17,\" he said in a telephone interview, referring to father, Chris Trucks, a former Florida roofer who now travels with the new aggregation, handling merchandise for the band.\n\nMusicianship runs in the family. Derek's uncle is drummer Butch Trucks, a founding member of the Allman Brothers, the legendary group that helped invent Southern rock.\n\nDerek Trucks isn't just related to the Allmans, however. He's already a veteran second-generation member of that band, having joined in 1999. When not playing with his uncle and the boys, he found time to go on the road with the Derek Trucks Band. Between the two, he sometimes played 300 dates a year.\n\nToday, Trucks and Tedeschi, who have two children, 10 and 7, try to bring it all together - play music, tour and raise a family. \"We're trying to juggle all of it - so far, it's working,\" said Trucks, who, with typical modesty, doesn't let on just how well it's working.\n\nThe group just released a double live album (shades of the Allmans' fabled \"Live at Fillmore East\") that follows the critically-acclaimed \"Revelator\" album, described by Rolling Stone as a \"meaty masterpiece\" from \"the best Dixie-funk family band since Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett.\" And it is a big family; the couple plays with nine other members.\n\n\"We spent six months to a year putting this band together,\" said Trucks, noting that 11 people seemed like the right number - especially once they performed together on stage. After all, you had to have the Burbridge brothers, Oteil (bass) and Kofi (keyboards and flute), as well as two drummers, an Allman Brothers hallmark.\n\n\"There's something about two drummers on stage. There's just no substitute for it,\" he said. Add the harmony vocalists and horn section and Summer Camp followers will probably realize there's no substitute for the Tedeschi-Trucks Band.\n\nSUMMER CAMP 2012\n\n- What: Summer Camp Music Festival 2012.\n\n- When: Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
