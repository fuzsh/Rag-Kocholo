        "text": "Music By Turner\n\nTrying to fully comprehend the legendary album Layla and other Assorted Love Songs from Derek and the Dominos is just about as futile as looking for spark plugs in a diesel engine.\n\nIn my 37 years covering music, this astounding music offering and the story of its recording remain among the strangest and most peculiar stories in the music biz.\n\nLayla , originally released in November 1970, long has been regarded as one of the finest albums in the history of rock 'n' roll. The title song was written by a smitten Eric Clapton, who had fallen deeply in love with his best pal George Harrison's wife, Patti.\n\nA 40th anniversary edition of the immortal two-disc set was issued recently with some cool outtakes and live cuts. Material from the band's aborted second album and a trio of tunes performed on the Johnny Cash Show are the standouts of the unreleased songs.\n\nWhat happened to the group would make a great movie, but most probably would not believe the tragic turns of events that followed the musicians were true.\n\nThe band consisted of five musicians, including one guest, guitarist Duane Allman. Allman was a major Clapton fan long before the Allman Brothers cut their debut album in 1969. Their classic Live at the Fillmore East wouldn't be recorded until 1971.\n\nLayla 's 14 songs (nine originals, five covers) featured Allman on slide guitar on all but three tracks. Allman met Clapton and the band in Florida and immediately began sitting in on the sessions with terrific results. Tragically, Allman died a little more than a year later in a Macon, Ga., motorcycle accident at age 24.\n\nBassist Carl Radle, who played in groups with Gary Lewis, Leon Russell and Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, was battling severe drug addiction (as were most of the Dominos) during the recordings. His vices cost him his life in 1980.\n\nMost bizarre is the saga of the Dominos' Jim Gordon, a \"first call\" drummer for Steely Dan, Traffic, Carole King and Joe Cocker. In 1983, Gordon, an undiagnosed schizophrenic, murdered his mother and was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison, where he remains.\n\nIt is difficult to comprehend that the troubled Gordon wrote the lovely piano coda that concludes the long album version of the song Layla . Curiously, Gordon, while still behind bars, won a Grammy for co-writing that tune in 1996 when Clapton's Unplugged album was issued.\n\nThankfully, pianist Bobby Whitlock, also an ex-Delaney and Bonnie sideman, is still performing in his native Texas. Whitlock shared lead vocals on many of the songs on Layla in addition to co-writing six of them. Whitlock's lovely ballad Thorn Tree in the Garden concludes the album as perfectly as a beautiful sunset ends the day.\n\nOf course, Clapton is a survivor in the best possible way. He too, was deeply into heroin in the early '70s and continued to drink heavily.\n\nIn 1982, he kicked his addiction and founded the Crossroads Center in Antigua in '93 to help fellow substance abusers.\n\nClapton did perform once in Augusta, on June 22, 1982, at our civic center (now James Brown Arena). Old local hipsters still talk excitedly about that night when EC's blues reined supreme in our town.\n\nLAYLA'S KEY TRACKS: All of 'em! Jimi Hendrix's Little Wing was recorded by the band only nine days before his death. Covers of the blues standards Key to the Highway, It's Too Late, and Have You Ever Loved a Woman are incendiary rockers hotter than this year's spring. Bell Bottom Blues, I Looked Away, Anyday and I Am Yours still sound as fresh and soulful as the day they were recorded 41 years ago.\n\nLAST WEEK'S contest winner is Saundra Plunkett, who takes home three 8-Track tapes from Stereo City in Daniel Village. Check out the cool new \"listening stations\" at the counter."
