        "text": "Bonnie Bramlett \"Roots, Blues & Jazz\" Zoho Roots\n\nBy Bob Putignano\n\nBonnie Bramlett is one of America's greatest interpreters of blues, soul, R&B and jazz. Bonnie understands her power which makes her a rock and roll legend. From 1969 to 1972 Bonnie Bramlett was a soul powerhouse with Delaney & Bonnie, she co-wrote mega hits like \"Soul Shake,\" (which featured Duane Allman on guitar) \"Only You Know & I Know,\" and \"Never Ending Song Of Love.\" Bonnie also performed with Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, George Harrison, Dave Mason, Gram Parsons, and John Lennon, she also wrote the FM radio classic \"Let It Rain\" with Eric Clapton which appeared on his first solo recording.\n\nDuring her formative years Bonnie Lynn O'Farrell performed in the juke joints of St. Louis with her local heroes Albert King and Little Milton. At fifteen years young Bonnie already gained the reputation as a strong vocalist with a powerful delivery, so much so Bonnie became the first white girl to tour with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue as one of the Ikettes. Somewhere around 1967 Bonnie moved to Los Angeles where she met and married Delaney Bramlett. Not long afterwards the dynamic southern newlyweds were signed to Atlantic Records, and landed an opening slot with rock icons Blind Faith. After the short lived Blind Faith disbanded, Eric Clapton went on to join Delaney & Bonnie on a European tour which is a still in-print- dynamite recording titled \"Delaney & Bonnie & Friends On Tour- with Eric Clapton.\"\n\nBonnie also released three solo albums for Capricorn Records in the 1970s, and appeared as a backup or featured guest vocalist on outstanding albums by Little Feat, Delbert McClinton, Rita Coolidge, Carly Simon, Dave Mason, and Joe Cocker. Bonnies 2002's \"I'm Still The Same\" was well received with strong reviews & airplay, which brings us to: \"Roots, Blues & Jazz\" a full scale return to her soul, blues & jazz roots. Bonnie's band \"Mr. Groove\" is Nashville based and have been together since 1980s, check out their sharp arrangements on \"Love the One You're With\" and the ultra hip \"No Particular Place to Go.\" But the sweetest soul of Roots, Blues & Jazz\" are Bonnie's original songs; like the especially raucous \"I Can Laugh About it Now\" and \"Gotcha\" the later co-written by ex- NRBQ vocalist/guitarist Big Al Anderson who is also now Nashville based.\n\nThis album also contains the first recorded material of Bonnie with the two original members of the Ikettes, Robbie Montgomery and Jessie Lucas. The album also features the first recording of Bonnie and her daughter Bekka who also worked with Fleetwood Mac in the 1990's- sounds like the apple did not fall far from the tree.\n\n\"Roots, Blues & Jazz\" by Bonnie Bramlett should be cherished, as I suspect you will be still playing this very fine recording for friends and yourself for many years to come. Enjoy\n\nBob Putignano www.SoundsofBlue.com"
