        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Delaney Bramlett, a singer-songwriter-producer who penned such classic rock songs as \"Let it Rain\" and worked with musicians George Harrison and Eric Clapton, died Saturday. He was 69.\n\nBramlett died at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles as a result of complications from gallbladder surgery, his wife Susan Lanier-Bramlett said.\n\nBorn in Mississippi, Bramlett enjoyed a career in the music business that spanned 50 years. With his then-wife Bonnie Lynn, he created the Southern blues-rock band Delaney & Bonnie & Friends. The group opened for Blind Faith, which featured British guitarist Clapton, in 1969.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for standards such as \"Superstar,\" co-written with Leon Russell, which was recorded by Usher, Luther Vandross, Bette Midler, The Carpenters and most recently, Sonic Youth, in a version featured on the Grammy-nominated soundtrack of the movie \"Juno.\"\n\nDuring his career, he performed, co-wrote or recorded with stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, Dave Mason, Billy Preston, the Everly Brothers and Mac Davis. He also produced artists including Etta James and Elvin Bishop."
