        "text": "RIP\n\nNFA!\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Singer-songwriter-producer Delaney Bramlett, who penned\n\nclassic rock songs such as \"Let it Rain\" and worked with musicians\n\nGeorge Harrison and Eric Clapton, has died. He was 69.\n\nBramlett died Saturday shortly before 5 a.m. at UCLA Ronald Reagan\n\nMedical Center in Los Angeles as a result of complications from gall-\n\nbladder surgery, his wife Susan Lanier-Bramlett said.\n\nBorn in Mississippi, Bramlett enjoyed a career in the music business\n\nthat spanned 50 years.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for standards such as \"Superstar,\" co-written\n\nwith Leon Russell, which was recorded by Usher, Luther Vandross, Bette\n\nMidler, The Carpenters and most recently, Sonic Youth, in a version\n\nfeatured on the Grammy-nominated soundtrack of the movie \"Juno.\"\n\nHe also co-wrote \"Let it Rain\" with British guitarist Clapton, who\n\nalso recorded it, and \"Never Ending Song of Love,\" which was recorded\n\nby more than 100 artists including Ray Charles, George Jones, Tammy\n\nWynette, Patty Loveless and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nDuring his career, he performed, co-wrote or recorded with stars such\n\nas Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, Dave Mason, Billy Preston,\n\nthe Everly Brothers and Mac Davis. He also produced artists including\n\nEtta James and Elvin Bishop.\n\nHe recently released an album \"A New Kind of Blues,\" on independent\n\nlabel Magnolia Gold Records.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, three daughters: Michele Bramlett, Suzanne\n\nBramlett and Bekka Bramlett-Britt, a son Dylan Thomas, and a brother\n\nJohn Bramlett. Services are pending.\n\nFrom his website: http://delaneybramlett.com/\n\n* The guitar Delaney is holding in the above picture is\n\na very rare Rosewood Telecaster given to him by George\n\nHarrison. After a show at the Royal Albert Hall George gave\n\nthis guitar to Delaney and said \"I want you to have this for\n\nwhat you've done for me\". Delaney still plays and cherishes\n\nthis rare piece, he uses it mostly for slide work.\n\n* The old sunburst Stratocaster and the red baby Les Paul\n\nonce belonged to Duane Allman who was one of Delaney's very\n\nbest friends. Recently FENDER'S custom shop turned an exact\n\nduplicate of the Duane Strat out for Delaney. He's still\n\nplaying Duane's during recording sessions.\n\n* The old metal Pre-Decal National had joint ownership for a\n\ntime between Delaney and his longtime friend Eric Clapton.\n\nThe guitar was given to them while on tour in the deep South\n\nby an old man who said it belonged to his father. He told D\n\nand E while he couldn't play, he knew his father would approve\n\nof them having it the way he saw them play. Eric eventually knew\n\nDelaney loved it so much that he told Delaney to keep it.\n\nDelaney plays it on several cuts on his new release.\n\n\n\nHi:\n\nIt was one of my first major concerts. I saw the Delaney & Bonnie\n\nband open for Blind Faith in Chicago, 1969. Eric Clapton pulled\n\ndouble duty....It must've been great. I remember being the only\n\nlonghair dancing out of my balcony seat. The rest were a bunch of\n\nclueless and stiff yuppies-to-be with their\n\ntrophy dates. It seemed to me, they wondered what I was doing....\n\n(LOL!)\n\nI think the obit was missing a mention of Bonnie Bramlett. Why not?\n\nWhat's the problem with that? If there is a public obit etiquette of\n\nsome sort, I'd say it ought to be updated to include exes.\n\nI have some D. & B. in my collection. I'll look for it and spin a\n\ntrack or so on Surf City Sounds Plus, my webradio station.\n\nHNY,\n\nJBK, etc., etc...\n\n\n\nSomeone (I think it was Kelly) posted a link to a thread with Bobby\n\nWhitlock over at the Steve Hoffman music group (there sure are some\n\nknowledgeable dudes over there) and he was most generous with praise\n\nfor just about everybody except Delany Bramlett, who he said was a\n\ntotal asshole.\n\nWhoops, sorry Ken, I spoke ill of the dead before the statute of\n\nlimitations expired. Oh well...\n\nAnyway, people should check out the Whitlock thread, unbelievable\n\nstories about Duane, Keith Moon etc, over 1,000 posts long. Whitlock\n\nis a humble guy (he was literally amazed that people consider him a\n\nmajor factor in a couple of the best rock albums ever made. Are you\n\nfucking kidding me??? His vocals and keyboards were a huge part of\n\nDerek and the Dominoes' sound) and a great great story teller."
