        "text": "For some 15 years, Derek Trucks fronted his own, highly acclaimed group, the Derek Trucks Band, which joined Trucks’ powerful blues slide guitar to influences from jazz, Indian and Pakistani music, R&B and more. That was in addition to his other jobs: playing for the Allman Brothers Band, which he joined at age 19; appearing in lots of other artists’ albums (from David Sanborn to Toots & The Maytals); joining some high-profile tours like Eric Clapton’s.\n\nHis wife, fellow blues guitarist and singer Susan Tedeschi, had had an active and prolific solo career as well, one that’s yielded four Grammy nominations.\n\nWith their kids well into school age, last year Trucks and Tedeschi, who married in 2001, chose to wed their professional careers as well. They disbanded their bands and formed a new group, Tedeschi Trucks Band, an 11-piece combo that this past June released his first disc, the soulful “Revelator.” The band plays Rochester this Saturday, Oct. 22, for an 8 p.m. concert at the Rochester Auditorium Theatre.\n\nThe couple aren’t exactly new to sharing a stage — each has frequently appeared in support of the other, and have toured together before under the name Soul Stew Revival. But that was a big-tent grouping of both their bands; the new project is a new band created specifically for this new era in their musical journey.\n\n“We had talked about it on and off for years,” Trucks said in a recent phone interview. “She was fully into her solo career, and I had a band for 16 years. We were really busy; we had two kids and eight records — it was a big decade. We felt like if we were ever going to do it, now was the time.” The kids, he noted, are now 9 and 7.\n\n“We took the plunge,” he said. “It certainly is a leap of faith, anytime you quit doing something that’s working really well.”\n\nThe plunge hasn’t gone unappreciated. It broke into Billboard’s Top 200 Chart at #12. Rolling Stone’s David Fricke in a June post called the disc a “meaty masterpiece” and the new band “the best Dixie-funk family band since Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett.”\n\nTrucks kinda likes it himself. “It was a blast to make!” he said. “I think it’s holding up well. I’ll often listen to a record of mine, and nine times out of ten I have a million things I would do differently.” Not so with the new disc.\n\nJoining Tedeschi and Trucks in the band are longtime Allmans bassist Oteil Burbridge and his brother, Derek Trucks Band keyboardist/flutist Kofi Burbridge; drummers J.J. Johnson and Tyler Greenwell; trumpeter Maurice Brown; tenor saxophonist Kebbi Williams; trombonist Saunders Sermons; and hamony singers Mike Mattison — who sang with the DTB — and Mark Rivers.\n\nLike any marriage, this new musical union has created something different from the individual parts. While “Revelator” contains plenty of Trucks’ signature slide and Tedeschi’s emotive vocals (imagine a meld of Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt), its overall sound — a gospel-soaked R&B — is something akin to a modern-day version of the classic soulful records made at Stax and FAME studios in Memphis and Muscle Shoals, Ala., by such seminal artists as Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding. That is, if someone like a Duane Allman took on the lead ax chores.\n\n“That’s kind of the idea,” Trucks said. “We’d build the studio behind the house” — their Swamp Raga Studios in Jacksonville, Fla. — “get really comfortable in the room, get that sound out of it. Generally play with the same musicians in the same place — that’s what Stax and Muscle Shoals were all about. It’s that sensibility — real musicians playing real music, writing songs and thinking about it and living it.”\n\nTrucks, 32, has been living the music since before hitting his teens. He grew up in Jacksonville, which was ground-zero for the bluesy-boogie Southern rock sound of the Seventies, spawning such bands as Lynyrd Skynyrd, .38 Special, Blackfoot, Molly Hatchett — and, most importantly, the Allman Brothers.\n\nTrucks is in fact the nephew of drummer Butch Trucks, one of the Allman Brothers’ founding members, and he would join the band himself when he was 19. (Trucks still plays with the Allmans — they’re only playing limited dates right now, which fits well with this new gig.)\n\nBut growing up, Trucks wasn’t around uncle Butch and the boys much, and the Eighties weren’t that busy for the Allmans, anyway. It was Derek’s dad Chris Trucks who really sparked the passion for music in the youngster. Chris Trucks himself was a roofer, not a musician — but he loved music, quality rock and soul and blues. His son is named after the band Derek and the Dominos, the Eric Clapton project that featured Duane Allman on slide guitar and made a single, essential album: “Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.”\n\nClassic records like “Layla” and the Allmans’ “At Fillmore East” were always playing in the house, Trucks recalled, and he would meet many musicians — rockers, bluesmen, jazz artists — through his family’s orbit. Almost inevitably, he picked up the guitar himself, before he was 10 — but less inevitably, he built himself into a virtuoso, one who was playing with the likes of Buddy Guy and Bob Dylan in his teens.\n\n“It wasn’t planned — it certainly wasn’t pushed on me,” Trucks recalled. “It was nature taking its course. ... I was lucky that I was around a lot of blues musicians who’d been on the road for 30 years trying to make it happen. It’s just really honest music, no B.S. I would get their lists of great artists” — and so, through their recommendations, he would discover one giant after another. Delta bluesman and slide guitarist (and former Rochester resident) Son House. Eccentric jazz bandleader Sun Ra. The Mozart of jazz, John Coltrane. Eastern musicians like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan — the title of an early DTB track, “Deltaraga,” displays the fusion of Southern and Eastern sounds that shape Trucks’ music.\n\nThe record he labels a “seminal influence”? Miles Davis’ “Kind of Blue,” featuring Coltrane and “Cannonball” Adderley on sax.\n\n“It was always timely, it was always right,” Trucks said. “It sent me down a lot of paths I wouldn’t have gone otherwise. Once you listen to the real stuff, it makes you refine what you do and want to plug into the source: Jimi to Buddy to Wolf and Muddy. The more that you know, the easier it is to become a part of it. These are the things that are really missing from modern music. Everybody’s copying copies of copies.”\n\nHe’s dipping from the same stream, too, he acknowledges — but notes it helps when you know where it’s flowing from.\n\n“I think really with every musician, your sound, all your influences distill down to whatever your ability level happens to be,” he said. “One night you’ll play a riff and ‘where did that come from?’ It could be a part of a Wayne Shorter solo you heard some night.\n\n“I think it’s important as a musician to be serious about the stuff that you listen to,” he added — drawing the parallel of an athlete in training, eschewing junk food in favor of the good stuff. And the good stuff? “People who dedicate their life to a craft — if you’re a musician, that stuff is important to you.”\n\nHe paused. “Actually, if you’re a human.”\n\nTrucks’ years and years of gigging have yielded many a moment meaningful to him. Playing (with Tedeschi) on stage with bluesman John Lee Hooker in one of his last shows. Bringing his dad on the Clapton tour — and getting to play with Eric himself. And simply getting to know musical legends as friends, having folks like Willie Nelson or Herbie Hancock over to dinner in Jacksonville. Hancock, it turns out, was quite taken with Chris Trucks’ shrimp and grits.\n\n“Herbie, he loved the shrimp and grits,” Trucks laughed. “We did Carnegie Hall for his 70th (birthday show) and he came off and said, ‘Man, I’ve been thinking about your dad’s shrimp and grits the whole time!’\n\n“Every moment — that’s kind of set in time.”"
