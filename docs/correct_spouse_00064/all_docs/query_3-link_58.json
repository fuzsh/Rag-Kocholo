Delaine Alvin “Delaney” Bramlett was a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer. Bramlett’s 5 decade career reached peaks in creativity, performance, and fame in partnership with his then wife, Bonnie Bramlett, in a revolving troupe of professional musicians and rock superstars known as Delaney & Bonnie & Friends. In the late 1960s, Eric Clapton joined Delaney & Bonnie & Friends on tour, after which Bramlett produced and co-wrote songs for Clapton’s debut solo album, “Eric Clapton.” Bramlett taught George Harrison, who was then with the Beatles, to play slide guitar, which resulted in Harrison’s hit “My Sweet Lord.” Bramlett wrote, recorded, or appeared on stage with many notable performers, including Joe Cocker, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Billy Preston, John Lennon, the Everly Brothers, Steve Cropper and Billy Burnette. Various members of the Friends appearing in concert or recording with Bramlett on Friends albums include Clapton, Harrison, Leon Russell, King Curtis, Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, Dave Mason, Rita Coolidge, Jim Gordon, Bobby Whitlock, Jim Keltner, Bobby Keys, and Gram Parsons. “To Bonnie from Delaney” is the 4th album from Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. It was released in Sept of 1970, and has the hit single, “Soul Shake.” Several of the album’s songs (“Living on the Open Road,” “The Love of My Man,” “Alone Together” and “Going Down the Road Feeling Bad”) became staples of Delaney and Bonnie’s live shows. Appearing in this album album are, Duane Allman, Bobby Whitlock, Little Richard, King Curtis and many more. #delaneybramlett #tobonniefromdelaney #duaneallman\".",
