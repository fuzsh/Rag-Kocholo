        "text": "Bonnie Lynn O’Farrell was born on 8 November 1944 in Acton, Illinois. She spent most of her childhood in East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nBonnie quit school at 14 and launched her music career by singing in East St. Louis R&B bars. During this time, she worked with other local musicians, Albert King and Little Milton and jazz luminaries like Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon and Maynard Ferguson. At 15, she became an “Ikette” touring with Ike & Tina Turner. Bonnie entered musical history for the first time as she was the first white female singer to join the band.\n\nIn 1967, Bonnie moved to Los Angeles. Shortly after her arrival, she met musician Delaney Bramlett. They married after knowing each other only 7 days. Signed as a duo to Stax Records, they moved to Memphis, Tennessee to record. Their first album for the label was “Delaney & Bonnie: Home”.\n\nExpanding their band, it evolved into Delaney & Bonnie & Friends. In 1969, they were selected as the opening act for Blind Faith’s U.S. Tour. It was during this time, Eric Clapton befriended the Bramletts. Eric Clapton would sign on as a “Friend” for a time (as did George Harrison), recording the classic live album, “Delaney & Bonnie: On Tour With Eric Clapton.”\n\nAfter she and Delaney divorced in 1973, Bonnie Bramlett recorded several solo albums and still later, she returned to her gospel roots. Bonnie has toured and worked as a backing vocalist for Stephen Stills, the Allman Brothers Band, Little Feat, Joe Cocker, Carly Simon, Jimmy Buffet, and others.\n\nRelocating once again to Los Angeles, she launched an acting career using the name “Bonnie Sheridan”. She appeared in a guest-starring role on the U.S. TV series, “Fame”. This lead to a role in the Oliver Stone film, “The Doors.” In 1991 and 1992, she was a cast member on the hit U.S. TV series, “Roseanne”, which starred comedienne Roseanne Barr.\n\nA resident of Nashville since 1999, she has once again embarked on a recording career. In recent years, she’s released the solo albums “I’m Still The Same” and “Beautiful” as well as a cd of greatest hits, “Piece of My Heart.” She also performs and records with the Mr. Groove Band. Session work includes Buddy Guy (Skin Deep), Klaus Voorman (The Sideman’s Journey), Charlie Daniels (Signed, Sealed, Delivered),"
