        "text": "DELANEY BRAMLETT\n\nPOP SINGER, GUITARIST\n\n1-7-1939 Â— 27-12-2008\n\nDELANEY Bramlett, a singer and songwriter whose bluesy, gospel and country-flavoured music influenced Eric Clapton and George Harrison, among others, and whose songs were covered by popular musicians ranging from Ray Charles to Sonic Youth, has died of complications after gall bladder surgery in Los Angeles. He was 69.\n\nBramlett's most famous compositions included Groupie (Superstar), which he wrote with Leon Russell and which became a hit for the Carpenters, but was also recorded by artists as varied as Woody Herman and Vikki Carr; Never Ending Song of Love, covered dozens of times by performers as diverse as Charles, Herbie Mann and the Osmonds; and Let it Rain.\n\nA revered sideman who was adept on slide guitar, Bramlett became a rock star in the late 1960s when he fronted a band with his wife at the time, Bonnie Bramlett, to whom some sources give co-writing credit on Groupie and Never Ending Song of Love. Their band became a who's who of rock'n'rollers.\n\nDelaney & Bonnie & Friends, as the band was known, at various times included Russell, Dave Mason, Rita Coolidge, Duane Allman and most notably Clapton, who met the Bramletts when they opened for his band, Blind Faith, on a 1969 tour.\n\nClapton wrote in his autobiography that performing after Delaney & Bonnie \"was really, really tough, because I thought they were miles better than us\".\n\nWhen Blind Faith broke up, Clapton joined as one of the Friends. Bramlett later produced Clapton's first solo album, Eric Clapton, on which the British superstar, at Bramlett's urging, sang lead vocals.\n\nIn December 1969, Delaney & Bonnie & Friends played the Royal Albert Hall in London. \"And all the Beatles were right there in the front row,\" Bramlett recalled in an undated interview posted on YouTube.\n\n\"George Harrison came backstage, and he said, 'Will you teach me how to play that slide?' And I said, 'You ain't done too bad; the Beatles aren't slouches, George.' And he said, 'But I don't know how to play like you play slide.' So I did.\" (Out of that lesson came My Sweet Lord.)\n\nBramlett, who was born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, received a guitar as a Christmas gift when he was 8. In the early 1960s he settled in Los Angeles, where he lived the rest of his life, never losing his southern twang.\n\nIn Los Angeles, he was hired for the Shindogs, the house band for the television show Shindig. One night in 1967, the story goes, the Shindogs were moonlighting at a bowling alley when he met the former Bonnie Lynn O'Farrell; they married a week later. Their albums included Home, To Bonnie From Delaney and On Tour With Eric Clapton.\n\nThe Bramletts broke up in 1973, as did their band. They both continued to record, but their successes never matched what they achieved together.\n\nThe couple's daughter, Bekka, also a singer, survives Bramlett, along with his wife, Susan Lanier-Bramlett, and a brother, John. The Associated Press reported that survivors also include two other daughters and a son.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES"
