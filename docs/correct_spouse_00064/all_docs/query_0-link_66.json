        "text": "HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL OF YA\n\nWhat can we hope for 2009 ?\n\nA Led Zeppelin world tour with Robert Plant ?\n\nAC/DC to change their setlist every night ?\n\nA new David Bowie cd and tour ?\n\nHope these dreams come true !!!\n\nWell , the only thing i hope is that David Bowie won't be the next one after the sad passing of Delaney Bramlett , Freddy Hubbard & Bo Diddley in 2008.\n\nLed Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant has been honoured by The Queen in the New Year Honours List today (December 31).\n\nRobert Plant becomes a CBE for services to music as part of the 966-strong list of honours.\n\nAnd still no news of a Led Zeppelin reunion with ... or without Robert Plant , but shoud it be called Led Zeppelin ?\n\nSad December , after Delaney Bramlett who died a few days ago now it's Freddie Hubbard .\n\nLOS ANGELES – Freddie Hubbard, the Grammy-winning jazz musician whose style influenced a generation of trumpet players and who collaborated with such greats as Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, died Monday, a month after suffering a heart attack. He was 70.\n\nHubbard died at Sherman Oaks Hospital, said his manager, fellow trumpeter David Weiss of the New Jazz Composers Octet. He had been hospitalized since suffering the heart attack a day before Thanksgiving.\n\nA towering figure in jazz circles, Hubbard played on hundreds of recordings in a career dating to 1958, the year he arrived in New York from his hometown Indianapolis, where he had studied at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music and with the Indianapolis Symphony.\n\nWell... the title says it all.\n\nHow can such an average band be so popular ?\n\nThank god in 2008 ( and 2009 ) we have AC/DC.\n\nSad news i've just received this :\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Delaney Bramlett, the singer-songwriter-producer who penned classic rock songs such as \"Let it Rain\" and worked with musicians George Harrison and Eric Clapton, died Saturday. He was 69.\n\nBramlett died shortly before 5 a.m. at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles as a result of complications from gall-bladder surgery, his wife Susan Lanier-Bramlett said. Born in Mississippi, Bramlett enjoyed a career in the music business that spanned 50 years.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for standards such as \"Superstar,\" co-written with Leon Russell, which was recorded by Usher, Luther Vandross, Bette Midler, The Carpenters and most recently, Sonic Youth, in a version featured on the Grammy-nominated soundtrack of the movie \"Juno.\"\n\nHe co-wrote \"Let it Rain\" with British guitarist Clapton, who also recorded it, and \"Never Ending Song of Love,\" which was recorded by more than 100 artists including Ray Charles, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Patty Loveless and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nCheck his website for Biography and full discography :\n\nhttp://delaneybramlett.com/\n\nand his myspace page to hear some music :\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/delaneybramlett\n\nJAMES HUNTER @ Café de la Danse\n\nParis France\n\nJan 8th 2009\n\nIn case you don't know him, here's a video here :\n\nhttp://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=suNDap09HkI&feature=channel_page\n\nSome music here :\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/jameshuntermusic\n\nIt may be my first show for 2009\n\nJust checked our past review of James Hunter here :\n\nhttp://rockerparis.blogspot.com/2008/10/james-hunter-new-morning-paris-oct-17th.html\n\nChristopher Cross has played a private gig tonight ( monday 22nd ) @ Paris' Ciné Aqua near the Trocadero in front of 50 people unfortunately i couldn't go there ( had some family at home from abroad ) . The gig was sponsored by french Radio Nostalgie.\n\nChristopher Cross was in Paris to play a secret show @ Cinéaqua near the trocadero , gig sponsored by Radio Nostalgie.\n\nUnfortunately i couldn't be there but i've found a few videos on the internet :\n\nhttp://fr.youtube.com/user/hcressent\n\nhere's \"Sailing\" ( this is not my video ) :\n\nContact : irockinparis@yahoo.fr\n\nDuffy + Jamie Lidell @ Bataclan Paris Dec 19th 2008 , Virgin radio tour .\n\nOther artists were supposed to play tonight and were announced at the very beginning but were cancelled later : Keziah Jones & Yael Naim .\n\nJamie doing the show\n\nOf course the Bataclan is Sold- out , some people have payed ( 25 euros ) to be here tonight but as it's a radio show ( part of the show was broadcasted live on Virgin radio ) there are a lots of invits .\n\nIt's 70 % female audience , many think Jamie's cute but most of' 'em are here for Duffy who's very popular in France .\n\nEarly start , Jamie's on at 7:45 PM , He's a real showman always dancing, jumping, playing percussions and so on ... in the end it's getting on my nerves, he's doing a bit too much.\n\nAs long as he's playing his \" Light\" funk that's allright but when he starts doing the DJ on his own with his sample machine it's quite boring ( his last show at the Rock en Seine was like this and it was sooo bad ).\n\nNice hour gig but ...\n\nStill doing it\n\nSetlist\n\nDuffy 's next .\n\nHer record is probably( one of ) the best selling this year.\n\nI saw her for the first time just 9 months ago in February @ Canal+, tv show \" l' Album de la semaine\" in front of a 100 people and she was completely unknown.\n\nIt's amazing how fast singers can become famous .\n\nSame happened with Amy Winehouse after seeing her at the very same tv show she was selling out huge venues a few months later.\n\nUnfortunately for Duffy her music is far from being as exciting and she's far from having the charisma of Amy. She's like a nice polish version but without the \" spark\" that makes Amy so special .\n\nAt least she's sexy now , she has dropped her silly country girl dresses she used to wear a few months ago. Good point she's sexy but is still dressed like the girl's nextdoor . I like that .\n\nShe's more confortable on stage now than last time , she's walking the stage , but she should let it go a bit more .\n\nThe show is nice but way too nice , it's like going to a Razorlight or a Stereophonics concert : everything is too perfect , its good but there's no excitement at all.\n\nEnjoyable though but too short less than 1 hour with no encore\n\nCome on Duffy i'm sure you can do better .\n\nSetlist\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR\n\nThat was my last gig for 2008 ( the 208th ).\n\nPete Doherty is playing the Bataclan on March 9th 2009.\n\nBob Dylan will play @ Palais des Congres in Paris on Avril 7th and 8th 2009\n\nTickets are already on sale and once again it's expensive up to 90 euros .\n\nThe Palais des Congres has a capacity of 2500 people .\n\nAC/DC 's concert @ Stade de France in Paris on June 12th is SOLD OUT\n\nHope they will add a second one.\n\nMorrissey is playing The Grand Rex beginning of June.\n\nTickets already on sale.\n\nCarbon/Silicon @ Trabendo Dec 17th 2008 with french opening artist Laetitia Sheriff.\n\nHere's the review at last :\n\nCrosswords before the show ( left ) Laetitia Sheriff ( right )\n\nLaetitia Sheriff opened the show tonight on her own with a guitar to play a \" minimalist\" dark pop-rock-folk.\n\nStrange how all these french girls are playing that kind of music . Last time i was at the Trabendo another french girl ( Marie - Flore )opened for Isobell Campbell & Mark Lanegan, playing a similar music. They're young and beautiful and living in Paris there should be a \" Joie de vivre \" in their music but no that's the opposite , they look ( or sound ) like they wanna commit suicide. Doesn't mean it wasn't good but where's the \" Joie de vivre \" ?\n\nDifficult to open for a Punk band but she did very good ( well she wasn't booed off stage ) even tough her music is too \" minimalist\" for me.\n\nPeople welcomed her nicely.\n\nHere's a video here :\n\nhttp://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg8ulhYg1wc\n\nThese boots are made for playing ...\n\nMick Jones & Tony James\n\nFirst concert in Paris for Carbon/Silicon, far from being full here tonight and many people are on the guest list ( including myself i have to admit )Shame it's not sold out when a Clash is in town but i've heard their new cd and i can't really say that I liked it , Songs are lame .\n\nHad my fear about the show.\n\nThey were both in Paris last month to promote the album and these guys are really nice and funny so at least i was expecting some funny moments.\n\nSome songs might be a bit too long but live they sound good , Mick Jones is a character always ready for a laugh. the band seem very happy to be with us and the audience seem very happy to be with them.\n\nNice 80 min of rock' n roll in a very relax atmosphere they both entered the stage with a bottle in hand. Tony James told us that the last time he played in Paris was 20 years ago at the famous Gibus Club with Johnny Thunders.\n\nThey don't really look like punks anymore , these days are long gone, but more like Dandies ( for Mick ) or Bankers ( for Tony ). Sad they only played songs from their cds maybe a couple of covers ( not necessarilly Clash's ) could have been nice.\n\nMick picked someone up from the audience to come and sing with him for the last song ( another lad sneaked in too )\n\nEnjoyable evening.\n\nMick & Leo \" Eezykill \" Williams on bass\n\nMick and Tony went to meet the audience after the show and signed many autographs to fans , they were nice and chatty to everyone and pose for pictures .\n\nSetlist + Mick signing stuff backstage\n\nHere's a video \" reasons to believe \":\n\nThe (International) Noise Conspiracy , Live @ the Maroquinerie Dec 16th 2008\n\nFar from being full tonight ( many people went to see Gogol Bordello @ Bataclan ) , it's a shame .\n\nThe singer's a real entertainer\n\nI just saw the last song of the french heavy rock who was opening tonight , hard to judge in 3 min but they sounded promising . I'll try to find out who they were.\n\nKids wanna ROCK\n\nFirst time i was seeing The ( International ) Noise Conspiracy Live and i wasn't disappointed , i like their kick ass rock ' n roll. They' re 60's influenced , with a keyboard ( organ ) to nice effects even though i couldn't really hear it as i was standing in front of the guitar player.\n\nThese guys have to jump around all the time and are giving it all on stage.\n\nA nice change after seeing all those indie english bands who are looking at their shoes while playing.\n\nThese guys FUCKING ROCK !!! No time to breath for 90 min.\n\nVery good show.\n\nSetlist\n\nDon't forget Carbon/Silicon ( with former CLASH guitar player : MICK JONES ) are playing the Trabendo tomorrow.\n\nSee Ya there\n\nThe new GUNS N ROSES ( Axl & Co ) are ready to go on tour in Europe this summer to promote long awaited and finally released last november \"Chinese democracy\" .\n\nThey should play in Paris Bercy.\n\nIn the US \" Chinese democracy \" is far from being a success.\n\nAfter entering charts at N° 3 it has dropped to N° 18 for its second week in the charts.\n\nhttp://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+200&pageNumber=Top+11-50&g=Albums"
