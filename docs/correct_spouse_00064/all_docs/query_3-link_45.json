        "text": "\"Because it is truly from the Soul...that invisible place where all the great ideas come...art, music, books. All the great lasting anything comes from that invisible place.\"\n\nCoCo Carmel Whitlock: Peace and Love\n\nCoCo Carmel is a multitalented artist and musician (Bass, Composer, Engineer, Flute, Producer, Saxophone, Vocals, and photographer). CoCo Carmel and Bobby Whitlock, have been making music together since 2001 beginning with their live record \"Other Assorted Love Songs\", springing up in the year 2003 while in New York and playing live radio , The Kennedy Center , and Sirius Satellite Radio in Rockefeller Center.\n\nSince that time they have recorded seven records, the latest being \"Metamorphosis\", a live recount of the defunct Lovers CD, only more powerful and intense complete with the same musicians, Stephen Bruton and David Grissom on guitars, Brannen Temple on drums, Andy Salmon on bass and James Fenner on percussion, topping it off with a the world's most gracious guest, Willie Nelson again on CoCo's \"True Love\". Released July 2010 is CoCo Carmel's first solo endeavour \"First Fruit\", co-produced with ex-husband Delaney Bramlett. Songs include \"I don't know why\" also produced by Delaney for Eric Clapton on his first solo record , \"Sound of City\" features Delaney and Bekka Bramlett , and finally a beautiful tribute to Delaney entitled \"Rest in Peace\". CoCo lives in Texas with her husband and musical partner, Bobby Whitlock. CoCo and Bobby’s new album is the “Carnival” (Live In Austin) and it's release date is Jun 25.\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\nWhen was your first desire to become involved in music and what does offered you?\n\nCoCo: I remember always loving music, it touched me in a way that nothing else could. We were living in Japan, this was around 1967, I was 8 years old and I heard Louis Armstrong singing Wonderful World on the radio. Something hit me and I was struck on music...his voice, even then being so young I was quite struck. And then I started to compose on the piano. Little songs. I remember one distinctly all on the black keys. I played it for my babysitters (a young couple); they applauded me and loved it.\n\nWhat does the Blues mean to you and what do you learn about yourself from the music?\n\nCoCo: The Blues is really an experience...and anyone can experience the Blues in different degrees. The actual Blues came out of slavery…so for me it's difficult to say that I understand the blues since I have never had that particular experience. I think it's a wonderful music, but I have a very hard time accepting anyone who comes along claiming to be a Bluesman (woman), simply because it is an experience. There are people today that are genuine…but don't consider themselves blues artists, I hear it in their music such as some of the African artists and Indian. Yes India has some incredible Blues sounding artists. They have the experience to back it up. What I learn from myself from the music is that it gives me a deep feeling that I cannot describe...it touches the Soul. Nina Simone is one of my favorite artists and I was fortunate enough to meet her in Los Angeles when she performed only once at The Vine Street Bar and Grill, she gives me that feeling…but she never considered herself a Blues artist.\n\nHow do you describe your philosophy about the music and life? What characterize CoCo Carmel?\n\nCoCo: My philosophy has always been to do what you enjoy and are guided to do, don't be afraid to be different, sink your teeth into it and never but never let anyone talk you out of your hearts desire. I have always bucked the system, I do not believe that just because someone says this is so, that this is so. I have to find out for myself. There are no errors in Life and no mistakes. Mistakes are just proof that you are still trying. Let your intuition guide you in all you do. Believe in yourself no matter how many do not...no matter how long.\n\nWhat experiences in your life have triggered your ideas most frequently?\n\nCoCo: Meditation and waiting. Never try to conjure up a song. Allow it to flow through. My ideas are never mine, they are God's.\n\n\"My philosophy has always been to do what you enjoy and are guided to do, don't be afraid to be different, sink your teeth into it and never but never let anyone talk you out of your hearts desire.\" Photo by Todd V. Wolfson\n\nAre there any memories from studio with Bobby Whitlock and your guest which you'd like to share with us?\n\nCoCo: The very first time I saw Bobby in a session was when we arrived in Muscle Shoals and were recording All Night All Stars. Bobby was out in the studio on the Hammond B-3, when the song kicked in…so did he and he was swaying back and forth …it was this energy I have never seen anywhere anytime. He became One with the instrument, it was captivating. I never got over it. It was amazing.\n\nWhat is the usual funny story that you hear from Bobby’s life?\n\nCoCo: That Bobby is accident prone, he is always knocking things over, breaking things, falling down the stairs, and always at the most in-opportune moment and in front of important people. (The Queen, dignitaries, The Rolling Stones at dinner…my parents)\n\nWhat is the best advice ever given to you?\n\nCoCo: I was with Delaney we were recording \"With a Little Help From my Friends\", we had Bekka of course (Delaney's daughter) me, and Rose Stone (Sly Stone's sister) singing the background parts. I am not really a background singer per se, but I remember Rose leaning over to me and saying \"Concentrate...listen and concentrate\". I always remember that. And Al Perkins (Manassas) once said to me \"Don't waste one moment\". That also was not only true but something to live by every moment. I would like to thank them for that.\n\nWhat do you miss most nowadays from 60s and 70s? How the music and people changed over the years?\n\nCoCo: The 60's was before my time. I think the 70's really shined when it came to Rock and Roll and the kind of music I like and do. I was still young in the 70's, but got to hear a lot of music and toward the end of the great 70's is when I moved to London. I believe the art of songwriting and singing is dying, which is a shame. People are more concerned with being famous. They have nothing to say…they are empty, there is no meat, no substance to their music. People always change, but I think in the United States in particular that we are steadily losing our freedom and that everyone has become complacent and is suffering from mental inertia. In the 60's and 70's people really had ideas and were excited about Life. That seems to have died from inertia.\n\nWhich meetings with musicians have been the most important experiences for you?\n\nCoCo: Not certain what you mean here, but I think you mean what musicians that I have played with been the most important? Delaney Bramlett to whom I was married to and with for 13 years, I learned an incredible amount of things in every way. Bobby Whitlock, my husband and musical partner, where I gained freedom to do as I please. I have learned something from everyone I have played with. Meeting Nina Simone, Eric Clapton, Albert King, BB King, Bobby Blue Bland, Alexis Korner, Willie Nelson and so many others, really has shaped my life and continues to do so, I don't expect it to ever end.\n\nWhich of historical personalities would you like to meet?\n\nCoCo: Would have to be Jesus and Gautama (The Buddha) and nowadays would perhaps be The Dalai Lama.\n\nWhat are your hopes and fears for the future of world and music?\n\nCoCo: I have hope that music will change the world. This world will always be \"this world\" until none of us are seeking anything from any other. Until that time we will not have lasting Peace.\n\n\"I believe the art of songwriting and singing is dying, which is a shame. People are more concerned with being famous. They have nothing to say…they are empty, there is no meat, no substance to their music.\"\n\nWhat has made you laugh lately and what touched (emotionally) you?\n\nCoCo: Bobby's antics always make me laugh. I am a sucker for animals, I saw where a dog had been rescued from the pound in the south and it was brought back to visit the woman who saved it. This little dog has one eye, and when it saw this woman it got in her lap and hugged her like a child. It made me tear up.\n\nDo you have any amusing tales to tell from your experiences in India?\n\nCoCo: India was so sacred to me…it is such a beautiful country. The people are so different, so amazing. We were told that we had all this great equipment ready for the concert. When we arrived in the afternoon, it was a let down immediately because we were under the impression that we were to play this big beautiful palace. They had a stage set up somewhere on the grounds, in fact I never saw the palace. Anyway…we got all set up to rehearse, we had the instruments of the other musicians which were adequate but when it came to play through amplifiers and Bobby's piano it was a disaster. Everything was hot…I mean we nearly all got electrocuted. There was no ground and the noise coming from the amps were horrendously loud. This went on for hours...and I remember this guy with a bunch of wires in his hands laying them on the amplifiers just so …if they got moved the amp would start making noise. It really was a disaster. The sound was terrible; none of the equipment they promised us arrived. The only B-3 in the entire country was in Mumbai, and the man wouldn't let us rent it. He was afraid that it would be damaged trying to get it there. And if you could see the way things are transported (on the back of a donkey?) you know that the man was right. One Hammond B-3 in the ENTIRE country! And the audience kept yelling soundcheck!! during our performance. They never got out of their seats. It was strange.\n\n\"I have hope that music will change the world. This world will always be \"this world\" until none of us are seeking anything from any other. Until that time we will not have lasting Peace.\"\n\nWhy did you choose the titles: Esoteric and Metamorphosis and what is the philosophical hypostasis of?\n\nCoCo: Everything we do must have a meaning to it and behind it. Esoteric of course means that which lies beneath, an understanding of the deeper things. What we do is much more than just playing and recording the music...it's deeper than that. And Metamorphosis was named because that is the experience that we were going through at the time….it was a definite time of growth and change, a Metamorphosis.\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable gigs and jams you've had? Which memory makes you smile?\n\nCoCo: I have had some wonderful gigs…The most memorable I guess would be The Road to Austin with our dear departed friend Stephen Bruton. That was the first show we did in Austin, with an audience of about 20,000 people. Kris Kristofferson, Bonnie Raitt and a host of other musicians played the show, it was phenomenal. When I was with Delaney of course we had a lot of jams at the house with all different kinds of people. The ones that make me smile though I think have been with Brannen Temple (in Austin) on drums…his playing will make you smile…it's ridiculous. I think on every gig I am grinning from ear to ear when we have Brannen on drums.\n\nSome music styles can be fads but the Blues and Rock are always with us. Why do think that is?\n\nCoCo: Because it is truly from the Soul…that invisible place where all the great ideas come…art, music, books. All the great lasting anything comes from that invisible place. We are merely the instruments from which it comes forth."
