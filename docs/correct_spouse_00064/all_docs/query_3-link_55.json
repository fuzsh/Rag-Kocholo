        "text": "If my eyes and ears are not playing tricks on me, I believe Bonnie Sheridan\n\nused to be Bonnie Bramlett, when she was married to Delaney Bramlett.\n\nThey had a band (in the 70s?) called \"Delaney and Bonnie\". They released an\n\nalbum titled \"Delaney and Bonnie & Friends\" where the \"Friends\" were\n\nEric Clapton and some others I don't recall at the moment. This was while\n\nClapton was going through his recovery from the many substances he was abusing\n\nat the time. Working with this band he regained his ability to get on stage,\n\nand improved his skills to the point that he became a front man in the\n\nsolo career that followed. In fact, the singing style that emerged bears a\n\nstrong resemblance to that of Delaney.\n\n\"D&B\" were a fairly mediocre band, but it was interesting to see them on\n\ntour with Eric in tow (and I did).\n\nIs Bonnie getting into a rut? First, she helps Clapton back to reality,\n\nand now she's partnered with David Crosby (at least on TV) who himself\n\nrecently returned from the land of the dead."
