        "text": "I've used him for joke references before, partly because his success and ever-presence made him a better target. But the man certainly deserves a farewell tour for his work and some additional respect for handling this the way he is.\n\nThanks for the post Scotti...I always loved to hear Glenn sing...One of his best songs in my opinion was \"There Ought To Be A Hall Of Fame For Mamas\"...Just a great song with a great message...It`s sad to hear about things like this happening to the stars that we grew up with and listened to and loved....\n\nThanks again.....Willie\n\nThat IS sad to hear. Generations of us have loved Glen and his music, including my daughter, who fell in love with him at a very young age. We've seen him in concert several times, and it's always a treat. I guess he does have a Rhinestone Cowboy type of reputation, but he's an amazing musician, for the little he shows it off.\n\nGlenn Campbell factoids:\n\n1. He was the guitarist for the Champs when they recorded Tequila back in the 1950's.\n\n2. He recorded an album of acoustic 12-string guitar instrumentals for World Pacific in the '60's, and also played guitar on Tut Taylor's 12-String Dobro album, same label.\n\n3. John Hartford got first major national exposure as a banjoist/songwriter/pickin' partner on The Glen Campbell Good-Time Hour. I believe Carl Jackson replaced Hartford later in the show's run...?\n\n4. He recorded Buffy Sainte-Marie's Universal Soldier around 1966-67 or so; as a PFC at Ft. Carson CO, I used to play the song on the Colorado College student union juke box every weekend when I hung around there. \"He knows he shouldn't kill, and he knows he always will...\" Didn't line up with his later conservative profile.\n\nGreat picker, good singer, made some career choices that cost him respect in the \"serious about music\" community, but, especially in collaboration with songwriter Jimmy Webb, left a legacy of songs that ensure a lasting reputation.\n\nI'm so sorry to learn about Glen's illness. I've been a fan ever since he released \"Witchita Lineman\" all those years back, & his song \"Galveston\" is one of my top 5 favourite songs. I just love his vocal tone & his delivery of the songs he sings,a truly great artist.\n\nA friend of mine has the 12-string Guitar album,\"The Astounding 12-String Guitar of Glen Campbell\" believe that Roy Clark is playing banjo on it on a few tracks,\n\nIvan\n\nIt's sad to see people lose their capacity to do what they love doing due to illness. my great grandpa was an old-time mandolin/fiddle/tenor banjoist, and in the years after he passed, my great grandma has suffered severe memory loss. Last time I saw her she didn't know who I was, but I played her \"Wildwood Flower\" and \"Cindy\" \"Faded Love\" and a mess of other old tunes, and she could name every tune and sing lyrics I didn't even know. If this is any indication, I think the music is embedded the deepest in our memories. It's that powerful.\n\nSad indeed.........I have been researching dementia, delirium & elder depression as part of a gerontology module I am coordinating at the univ where I teach & Alzheimer dementia is such a devastating & debilitating disease. I have been a huge fan of his since childhood........use to love watching he & Bobby Gentry singe (ok......more watching Bobby Gentry....:-) what talents. He also joined Jimmy Seals & Dash Crofts in the ever evolving group called The Champs back in the late 1950s/early 1960s if I recall correctly.........talented musician & vocalist for sure.\n\nPeace\n\nI remember seeing him on TV with Roy Clark, and they did this thing where they both played one guitar; one of them picked while one of them worked the fretboard behind him. They played something that would have been impressive if they were doing it on their own, but to play it flawlessly the way they did ... never been able to forget that ... I was a longhaired rocker of about 15 or so at that time so generally speaking was only impressed by Hendrix, so it was on that level of virtuoso musicianship ..."
