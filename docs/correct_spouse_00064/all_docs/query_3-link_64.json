        "text": "2012 Nominee – Female Vocalist of the Year – 22nd Annual LA Music Awards\n\nA native of Dallas, TX, I decided to be an actress at the ripe old age of 5 while watching the “Miss America” contest on our old black & white TV. Being a beauty contestant (which was a big deal for a girl from the South) was never an option since I was always the shortest one in class….but, being on stage acting, dancing, singing, doing comedy…was my dream & life’s passion from that night forward.\n\nMy first real job was working as Little Miss K-BOX as a receptionist & part time teenage DJ at the # 1 Rock ‘n Roll radio station in Dallas. I loved being on the air and learned to appreciate great music.\n\nI attended North Texas State University, where I was the 1st freshman to ever win the Alph Phi Omega, Best Actress Award, and the next year, headed for New York City to pursue my dreams of acting on the Broadway stage. I enrolled at NYU and studied acting with the great Uta Hagen, herself, & soon began performing in numerous Off-Off Broadway productions. Just as soon as I was cast in my 1st real Broadway show, “Hair,” I was blessed with news that I was expecting my amazing son, Dylan.\n\nAt 4 months old, me & my baby boy ended up touring the country in various theatre productions, one of which led us to Hollywood where I went to work doing episodic & sitcoms on TV.\n\nIn late 1977, I happened into the Troubadour Club on Santa Monica Blvd., where I met the love of my life, Delaney Bramlett, whom I would later marry.\n\nBefore meeting Delaney, music was just something I loved to listen to, but being around his amazing musical genius, was contagious & inspiring. One day, he asked me to help write some lyrics on a song he was working on, & I fell in love with songwriting.\n\nIn the late 80′s, I began playing with my own band at different LA venues, including the world-famous Palomino Club, & soon discovered the art of Cabaret. It allowed me the opportunity to combine my love for stand-up comedy & songwriting.\n\nOver the years, I have worked as a performer, producer, director, photographer, teacher…& have loved it all.\n\nDelaney’s passing at the end of 2008 was the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced. He had not only taught me the meaning of love, but also the true meaning of perseverance, enjoying the process, and following your passion.\n\nMy one woman show, “Swamp Cabaret” is an comedy-driven autobiographical one-woman musical, combining Southern Rock, Country Blues, Broadway, etc. and remains a work in progress. It’s a joy to be back on the Cabaret stage as I continue to work in Film, TV, and Theatre."
