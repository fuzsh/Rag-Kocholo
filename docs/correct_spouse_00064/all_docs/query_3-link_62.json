        "text": "“By the time On Tour with Eric Clapton was released in 1970, the husband/wife pairing of Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett could loosely be placed in the category of ‘seasoned veterans’ within the music industry, despite the fact that they had only been recording as a unit for a very short period of time. … Working on the television show would bring Bramlett in contact with Leon Russell (also a member of the Shindig! band) and Russell would play a very important role in Delaney’s musical future (and the pair also filtered into a potent scene of musicians featuring former Byrds members Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman that would eventually spawn The Flying Burrito Brothers). Bonnie Lynn O’Farrell was climbing her own ladder in the music industry, putting two notable notches onto her musical resume at a very early age, singing with blues legend Albert King and later, the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, both while she was still in her mid-teens. A few years later, she would eventually move to Los Angeles where she met and married Delaney Bramlett in 1967. … Despite ace production and session assistance from notable players(including Donald ‘Duck’ Dunn, Isaac Hayes and others), the band’s first album Home (released on Stax Records) in 1969 was not a success. … By the end of 1969, Delaney & Bonnie found themselves without a label, but they had a new ally thanks to their friend George Harrison (who famously had tried to sign the group after hearing an early version of Accept No Substitute, even though they were still signed to Elektra at the time) who introduced them to Eric Clapton, who was looking for an opening act for an upcoming Blind Faith tour. Clapton quickly took a liking to Delaney & Bonnie’s music and performed with the group often on-stage during the duration of the tour. Clapton was able to help the band secure a new record deal with Atco Records and he helped pave the way for the eventual release of On Tour with Eric Clapton, recorded in December of 1969 and released the following year. …”\n\nCD Review: Delaney & Bonnie, “On Tour With Eric Clapton” (Deluxe Edition)\n\nW – On Tour With Eric Clapton\n\nDiscogs, Spotify (Audio)\n\nYouTube: Poor Elijah (Live), Where There’s A Will There’s A Way 1969 (Live), Eric Clapton – I Don’t Know Why (Live)\n\nYouTube: On Tour With Eric Clapton (Live), Delaney & Bonnie & Friends 1 / 52\n\nYouTube: Delaney & Bonnie & Friends – Fillmore West, 22 Feb 1970 1:04:11"
