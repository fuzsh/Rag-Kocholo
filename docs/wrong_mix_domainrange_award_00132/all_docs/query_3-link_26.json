He was born in Copenhagen in 1885, and his father was a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen. Bohr's most significant contribution to physics was his development of a model of the atom known as the Bohr model. In this model, the electrons in an atom are arranged in distinct energy levels, and the atom emits or absorbs energy when an electron moves from one energy level to another. Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for his atomic structure and quantum theory work. He later became a professor at the University of Copenhagen and was crucial in developing the first nuclear reactor. Bohr was also an advocate for international cooperation in science and played a role in establishing CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. #nielsbohr #october7 #physicist #atomicstructure #quantumtheory #bohrmodel #nobelprize #techexplorist"
