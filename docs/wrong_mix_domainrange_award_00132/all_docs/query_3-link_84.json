He was the oldest son of Christian Bohr and Ellen Adler. His father was an eminent physiologist and was largely responsible for awakening his interest in physics while still at school and his mother came from a family distinguished in the field of education. Bohr took his Master's degree in Physics in 1909 and his Doctor's degree in 1911. Bohr was recognized on the structure of atoms when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for 1922. Niels Bohr died in Copenhagen on November 18, 1962.\n\n3 Contribution and How it Was Significant In 1913, Bohr published a theory about the structure of the atom based on an earlier theory of Rutherford's, which had shown that the atom consisted of a positively charged nucleus, with negatively charged electrons in orbit around it. Bohr expanded upon this theory by proposing that electrons travel only in certain successively larger orbits. He suggested that the outer orbits could hold more electrons than the inner ones, and that these outer orbits determine the atom's chemical properties. Later other physicists expanded his theory into quantum mechanics. This theory explains the structure and actions of complex atoms.\n\n4 Diagrams of Experiment"
