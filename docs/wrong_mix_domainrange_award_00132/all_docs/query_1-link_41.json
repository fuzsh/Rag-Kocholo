        "text": "On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes, the Nobel Prizes. As described in Nobel’s will, one part was dedicated to “the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics”. Learn more about the Nobel Prize in Physics from 1901 to 2023.\n\nNumber of Nobel Prizes in Physics\n\n117 Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded since 1901. It was not awarded on six occasions: in 1916, 1931, 1934, 1940, 1941, and 1942.\n\nWhy were the Nobel Prizes not awarded in those years? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” During World War I and II, fewer Nobel Prizes were awarded.\n\nShared and unshared Nobel Prizes in Physics\n\n47 physics prizes have been given to one laureate only.\n\n32 physics prizes have been shared by two laureates.\n\n38 physics prizes have been shared between three laureates.\n\nWhy is that? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.”\n\nNumber of Nobel Prize laureates in physics\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to 225 laureates 1901–2023. As John Bardeen has been awarded twice there are 224 individuals who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics since 1901.\n\nList of all Nobel Prize laureates in Physics\n\nYoungest physics laureate\n\nTo date, the youngest Nobel Prize laureate in physics is Lawrence Bragg, who was 25 years old when he was awarded the Nobel Prize together with his father in 1915.\n\nOldest physics laureate\n\nThe oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics to date is Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018.\n\nFemale Nobel Prize laureates in physics\n\nOf the 224 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, 5 are women.\n\nList of all female Nobel Prize laureates\n\nMultiple Nobel Prize laureates in physics\n\nJohn Bardeen is the only person who has received the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, year 1956 and 1972 . Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize twice, once in physics 1903 and once in chemistry 1911.\n\nSee the list of multiple Nobel Prize laureates within other Nobel Prize categories here\n\nPosthumous Nobel Prizes in Physics\n\nThere have been no posthumous Nobel Prizes in Physics. From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Before 1974, the Nobel Prize has only been awarded posthumously twice: to Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize 1961) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931).\n\nFamily Nobel Prize laureates in physics\n\nMarried couples\n\nMarie Curie and Pierre Curie were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize a second time in 1911, this time receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (One of Marie and Pierre Curie’s daughters, Irène Joliot-Curie , was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 together with her husband Frédéric Joliot.)\n\nFather & son\n\nSir William Henry Bragg\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1922 for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them.\n\nAage Niels Bohr\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection.\n\nKarl Manne Georg Siegbahn\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1924 for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy.\n\nKai M. Siegbahn\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1981 for his contribution to the development of high-resolution electron spectroscopy.\n\nJoseph John Thomson\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1906 in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.\n\nGeorge Paget Thomson\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1937 for their experimental discovery of the diffraction of electrons by crystals.\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal in physics\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal in physics was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents Nature in the form of a goddess resembling Isis, emerging from the clouds and holding in her arms a cornucopia. The veil which covers her cold and austere face is held up by the Genius of Science.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize medal in physics\n\nThe Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nEach Nobel Prize diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount\n\nAlfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,702 million) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount for 2023 was set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize amount\n\n* Why are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Prize laureate? The word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular Crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour – both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\n\nLinks to more facts on the Nobel Prizes\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nFacts on the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nFacts on the prize in economic sciences"
