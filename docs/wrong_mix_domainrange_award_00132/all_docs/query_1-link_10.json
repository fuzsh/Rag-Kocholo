        "text": "(1885–1962). One of the foremost scientists of the 20th century, the Nobel prizewinning physicist Niels Bohr was the first to apply the quantum theory to atomic structure. His interpretation of the meaning of quantum physics was to become a basic tenet of the science. (See also quantum mechanics.)\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 7, 1885. His father was a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen, and young Bohr grew up among scientists. He entered the university in 1903, winning in 1907 the gold medal of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters for his experiments with the vibrations of water to determine its surface tensions.\n\nIn 1911 Bohr went to England to study with J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford. His first great work began with a study of the theoretical implications of the nuclear model of the atom proposed by Rutherford. In 1913 he combined the concept of the nuclear atom with the quantum theory of Max Planck and Albert Einstein, departing radically from classical physics. He returned to Copenhagen in 1916 as a professor at the university, becoming director in 1920 of the university’s Institute for Theoretical Physics, to which he attracted world-renowned physicists. In 1922 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on atomic structure.\n\nWhen Bohr visited the United States early in 1939, he brought with him the knowledge that German scientists had succeeded in splitting the uranium atom. Bohr worked during the winter of 1939–40 at Princeton University, where he developed the theory of atomic fission that led directly to the first atomic bomb. He returned to Denmark in 1940.\n\nAfter the Germans occupied his country, Bohr was active in the anti-Nazi resistance movement. Under threat of arrest because of his Jewish ancestry, he escaped by fishing boat to Sweden in 1943. He was then flown secretly to England. In the United States he was an adviser on the atomic bomb project but did not remain to see the first test bomb exploded. In 1957 he received the first United States Atoms for Peace Award. He died in Copenhagen on November 18, 1962. Bohr’s essays were collected in Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature (1934); Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge (1958); and Essays, 1958–1962, on Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge (1963). His son, Aage Bohr, was a joint winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 for his own work on atomic structure."
