Niels Bohr - Nobel Prize Winner (Physics)

On December 11th, 1922, Niels Bohr gave a lecture on The Structure of the Atom. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the scientific community. It is because of him, we begin to understand that the electrons are not only in orbit around the nucleus, they can also jump between different levels, or Quantum Leaps. "Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it."

-Niels Bohr

Nicholas Baker - The Manhattan Project

During WWII, Niels Bohr fled Copenhagen to Los Alamos, New Mexico to avoid persecution by Hitler and the Nazi Regime. In New Mexico, Niels, then working by the name Nicholas Baker for obvious reasons, began helping to create what would eventually be known as the atomic bomb, or A-bomb. He, and the other scientists helping with the project, were well-aware of the implications creating such a destructive device. He wanted this information to be used responsibly and humanely.

Open Letter to the United Nations

Niels Henrik David Bohr not only had multiple contributions to the scientific community, he stood by his beliefs. In 1950, Niels Bohr wrote a letter to the United Nations listing his concerns for what he helped create during World War II. He goes on saying that it "holds out such great promises for the improvement of human welfare it has, in placing formidable means of destruction in the hands of man". He was a peaceful man and it weighed heavily on his conscience.
