The 1950s, the baby boom era was marked with the Civil Rights movement, the Cold War, and the fear of spreading communism. From an entertainment perspective, we witnessed the ubiquitousness of television (and with that, Swanson introduced their frozen TV dinners in 1954) and the dawn of teen angst and rebellion.

Hollywood took aggressive measures towards winning back a growing television audience with film gimmicks such as CinemaScope, VistaVision and 3-D. Their answer to a rising teen influence were answered by these influential young stars making their screen debut: Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), James Dean in East of Eden (1955), and even Elvis Presley in Love Me Tender (1956).

The era was marked with several lavish, historical epic dramas. Noteworthy among these were: The Robe (1953), The Silver Chalice (1954), The Ten Commandments (1956), and Ben-Hur (1959). In addition to the big budget epics, Hollywood took an introspective look at the business of making movies and the associated drama and goings-on with such films as: The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), Singin' in the Rain (1952), A Star is Born (1954), and All About Eve (1950).

Amid the anticommunism crusades being waged by the HUAC and the resulting blacklistings, Hollywood's most popular stars in 1950s drama films were: Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, Kim Novak, Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Charlton Heston, Rock Hudson, Natalie Wood, Burt Lancaster, James Stewart, William Holden, Elizabeth Taylor, and Audrey Hepburn.

​ The 50’s also brought us a new breed of celebrity, coined; “sex symbols”: Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Jayne Mansfield, and Mamie Van Doren.
