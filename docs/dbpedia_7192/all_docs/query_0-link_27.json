        "text": ".\n\nDirector: Roger Corman\n\nScreenwriters: Lou Rusoff / Lou Rusoff, Charles B. Griffith (uncredited)\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIn memoriam: Roger Corman 1926-2024\n\nI started writing this to give more appreciation to Corman before it was too late; then, mid-writing, it was too late. In any event, this is the first of a two-part look at some of my favourite Corman films of his pre-1960 phase.\n\nThe first five years of Roger Corman’s directing career saw him direct twenty-five feature films, a frenzy of creative zeal mixed with mercenary cool practically without comparison for productivity or richness in the history of cinema. In 1960 Corman released two movies that garnered him a sudden upswing in attention and respect, if not exactly respectability: The Little Shop of Horrors, a movie that was, like most of the films he had made up until then, incredibly cheap and filmed quickly in black-and-white, and House of Usher, a lush colour horror movie made on a comparatively munificent budget. The Little Shop of Horrors played at the Cannes Film Festival, and House of Usher kicked off a series of films adapted from Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft that remain, today, his best-known and most-loved works. It’s comparatively easy to celebrate Corman as a director for his later work – other entries in the Poe-Lovecraft series, also including Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964), his variably mythic and surreal counterculture exploitation excursions like The Wild Angels (1966), The Trip (1967), and Gas, or, How It Was Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It (1970), and his thematically and directorially ambitious historical films, The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967), Bloody Mama (1970), and Von Richthofen and Brown (1971).\n\nBy contrast, the fruits of those first five years have long attracted two entwined but also sharply distinct kinds of appreciation: viewers and critics genuinely fascinated by the particular kind of ingenuity and eccentric verve Corman and his team of regular collaborators exhibited, and those seeking immersion in the pantomime delights of Corman’s tacky monsters, makeshift sets, and other threadbare wonders. Here is where truly advanced Corman studies await. Those films range from strange masterpieces to a couple that are indeed pretty bad, but are all interesting – an array of stark, smart, ideogram-like variations on the essential stuff of genre cinemagoing, often delivered to meet whatever genre vogue there was going on, but shot through with perverse speculative interest, radicalism in theme and humour, and theatre-of-the-mind invention. Corman didn’t just prove you could make a movie about the end of the world on a budget that would hardly cover the catering on a big movie, but, perhaps, could and should only be done that way, with scope and scene reduced to a handful of players clinging on to the edge of the world – subject matter and setting mimicking Corman’s place in the Hollywood scheme of things. In that he proved, at long last, the ablest survivor. Corman successfully defined a version of commercial cinema that could subsist beneath the superstructure of expensive spectacle, a version that would split and veer off into many streams.\n\nCorman’s factory-line approach to turning out movies could well be traced back to the place of his birth, Detroit, and his initial choice to train as an engineer, in trying to follow his father, after the family moved to California. Corman served in the US Navy through the end of World War II before finishing a degree in industrial engineering at Stanford. After a brief attempt to work in a car manufacturing plant, Corman realised this was not his metier. His older brother Gene was already working as an agent in the film world, and Corman decided to follow him. His first display of his defining independent streak and dislike for the big Hollywood studios would emerge when he quit working for Twentieth Century Fox after not getting any credit for coming up with the idea behind Henry King’s The Gunfighter (1950), and became a student again, using the GI Bill to study English at Oxford before returning to Los Angeles and working for a literary agent whilst thrashing out scripts. One he wrote became Highway Dragnet (1954), a movie he also signed on to serve as an associate producer for no pay, purely to get experience. Corman immediately ploughed the money he got for the script and more he borrowed from contacts, adding up to about $12,000, into his first foray as full producer, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954).\n\nThis gambit proved sufficiently successful for Corman to quickly produce another, The Fast and the Furious (1955), which Corman wrote as well and was directed by its star, John Ireland, alongside Edward Sampson. Despite receiving interested offers from well-established players, Corman sold the movie to American Releasing Company, a recently founded by the two entrepreneurial impresarios, James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff, as they offered Corman the chance to immediately make more movies. Corman kicked off his official directing career with his next project, Five Guns West (1955), a modest, mostly conventional, solidly-handled Western: Corman was still not yet thirty years old. Corman’s loyalties as a movie aficionado were perhaps most clearly signalled in his early work by the relatively straight-laced approach he usually took with the Westerns and gangster movies he made, but he began introducing twists, like the warring female antagonists of Gunslinger (1956), and the fascination with criminal psychology as a house of cards introduced in Day The World Ended and developed in Machine-Gun Kelly (1958) through to Bloody Mama. Corman later described The Intruder (1962) as his one stab at a message movie and his only flop, but Corman’s edge of social critique and humanist concern was percolating from the start, like the confrontation with racism often elided in Westerns in Apache Woman (1955). Gunslinger also proved fateful for Corman as it was his first time working with screenwriter Charles B. Griffiths, who would write many of Corman’s films in the next few years.\n\nSome were crime sagas, some teen flicks, others monster movies, a neat cross-section of the era’s popular fare. Still, Corman sometimes found himself starting trends rather than chasing them. The Undead (1957), a truly original and odd melange of horror, science fiction, and fantasy, emerged right at the cusp of a resurgence for horror cinema, whilst the trilogy of burlesques A Bucket of Blood (1959), The Little Shop of Horrors, and The Creature From The Haunted Sea (1961), helped birth the 1960s style of hip, pop art-inflected satirical comedy – particularly the latter, which came well before the likes of Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) and A Hard Day’s Night (1964) in transposing the aesthetics of stand-up comedy and MAD Magazine to the movie screen. Corman would later become most celebrated for the sheer number of future major Hollywood figures to gain major early career boosts from working with him. More immediately, Corman assembled a cadre of collaborators behind the camera and in front, employed across many movies. Some major if aging stars like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Ray Milland would pass through his orbit, and stars on the rise, particularly Jack Nicholson and Charles Bronson, but also including Peter Graves, Lee Van Cleef, Mike ‘Touch’ Connors, and Robert Vaughan. But it was Corman’s corps of regular players whose faces become like old pals, among them Jonathan Haze, Dick Miller, Susan Cabot, Beverly Garland, Allison Hayes, Abby Dalton, Mel Welles, Dorothy Neumann, Barboura Morris, Richard Devon, Richard Garland, Bruno Ve Sota, and Mike Forrest.\n\nOne of the peculiar truths Corman stumbled upon, one he’d later explain to one of the young, blow-in talents looking to him for backing, a lad named Martin Scorsese, was that if you hit the right beats for pleasing the market being aimed for in his hemisphere of the filmmaking business, you could basically make any movie you wanted in between. Corman had already proved this often, and some of his best, most peculiar work exists in arguably his least-appreciated, most ephemeral movies-as-product, the ones he made to get in on the rock ‘n’ roll craze: movies like Rock All Night (1957) and Carnival Rock (1957) toss in a couple of numbers by some hit parade acts in scripts that otherwise dabble in postmodern farce and operatic tragedy, explorations of the absurd underside of show business and its players, and its connection with the vast American demimonde, the appetites serviced and personal fantasies given realisation, but built not down from the airy clouds of most Hollywood product, but from the stanchions of the street up. From almost the beginning, too, Corman had experimented with blending genre modes in a way that annexed the postmodern. It’s tempting to call Day The World Ended, Corman’s fourth film as a director, the wellspring of his oeuvre as his first movie in a fantastical genre and the one that really got things moving when it proved extremely profitable, making upwards of $1,000,000 from a budget of $96,000 and a shoot that lasted ten days.\n\nIn another sense, however, Day The World Ended stems directly from Five Guns West in focusing on a small, motley band adrift in a hostile landscape. From the Old West to the new: a high mountain abode at the fringes of what was civilisation, suddenly the only recourse for a small group of survivors of nuclear apocalypse. The script was written, as several of his early films would be, by Arkoff’s brother-in-law Lou Rusoff. Nepotism helps keep costs down, but Rusoff was also a sober, canny screenwriter, and he proved the first to invest Corman’s oeuvre with the trait that helped it to stand out, good writing and acting even in the most straitened circumstances. “Our story begins with….THE END!” announces the opening title card; its partner right at the end of the movie is, of course, “THE BEGINNING.” Corman would return to that idea with a more radical angle on Teenage Caveman (1958). “THE END!” is a mushroom cloud boiling up into the atmosphere. Atomic war has broken out, the world’s cities have been pummelled, and radioactive death is spreading across the world. Faux-Biblical scripture booms out over churning clouds. A narrator intones over shots of ruined buildings, “This is TD Day – Total Destruction by Nuclear Weapons…Man has done his best to destroy himself.” A gnarled and filthy figure gropes his way out of surging smoke and steam and stumbles down a slope before collapsing, revealing the stigmata of radiation poisoning blooming on his face. This is the edge of Corman’s little world, the pocket of normality left by the apocalypse, floating on an island of reality, the B-movie rough draft for Solaris (1972).\n\nCorman signals John Huston as a particular touchstone in Day The World Ended, borrowing the coot prospector from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and from Key Largo (1948) the surly gangster with might-makes-right attitude and his brassy, mistreated moll at his side, as well as the theme of siege and of nerves being ridden like a merry-go-round. Day The World Ended is however more a sci-fi redraft of Frank Capra’s Lost Horizon (1937) – a fantasy of seclusion unfolding in a mountain retreat protected by walls of stone, left delicately untouched by the churning storms without, with a mystic pool of purity at its heart where the maidens swim, and where the disruption in the tenuously balanced Eden comes from those who cannot let go of the world that was. Corman’s fondness for that source was signalled decades later when he acted in a short film directed by his daughter built around its mystique. Day The World Ended is also inflected with a brand of meta-textual play that would recur throughout Corman’s career, in the characters-in-search-of-an-author eccentricity of Rock All Night, The Little Shop of Horrors, and Creature From The Haunted Sea, and hit an apotheosis with Gas, or, How It Was Necessary To Destroy The World In Order To Save It, which would also provide the ultimate self-deconstruction of Day The World Ended’s titular thesis, tales where Corman confronts characters and dramatic modes usually kept apart.\n\nDay The World Ended is still circumspect in that regard but the borrowings and tropes are fed into a supercollider, as Corman gropes towards discovering his compulsive themes and essential business model. The trash auteur who’d studied English at Oxford gives the game away by prominently featuring the Tragedy and Comedy masks on the wall of home that constitutes the bulk of the film’s setting, and even makes their presence the butt of a ruthless visual joke, as he zeroes in on a heroine trying to cheer everyone only to move as she dissolves in tears, the Comedy mask kept sarcastically in the frame. The bedraggled and irradiated survivor is Radek (Paul Dubov); shortly after geologist Rick (Richard Denning) arrives by the same path and finds Radek collapsed and seemingly dying. A little further along the ridge, gangster Tony (Connors) and his burlesque dancer girlfriend Ruby (Adele Jergens) also arrive at the fringe of the poisoned clouds in a car, and look down the slope into the mountain valley where a single, modernist-style house stands. The house belongs to Jim Maddison (Paul Birch), a retired US Navy Commander who chose the locale to live in precisely because he anticipated nuclear war and sought out a local where there was a chance of remaining safe from clouds of radioactive fallout: as well as high and remote, the mountains around the valley are filled with lead, and the house is well-stocked with provisions and fuel.\n\nMaddison lives with daughter Louise (Lori Nelson), who had called her fiancé to retreat to the house with them when it became clear war was going to break out, but he never showed up. At first Maddison wants to fight off the new arrivals because their presence would swiftly exhaust their stockpiles, a stance that seems all the more justified when Tony uses a pistol to shoot off the lock on the front door, but Louise demands her father open the house to them. Rick arrives shortly after, carrying Radek, and Maddison checks Radek with a Geiger counter, finding he’s badly irradiated. Tony’s initial intention to seize control of the situation by brandishing his gun is foiled by Rick, who surprises him with a powerful punch and disarms him. A final survivor arrives, this one descending from the mountains above: Pete (Raymond Hatton), aged gold prospector with a mule he calls Diablo. Pete claims to have just found the gold seam he’s searched for; Pete has big deals going down in his intended destination, the now non-existent San Francisco. Corman’s debriefing of the different eras and ideals of American life, pack mule to car to atom bomb to mutant, but the search for gold goes on. Despite his misgivings, Maddison quickly advises his guests to wash off with bottled water and sets about arranging the house for them. As in a fairy-tale, the clean water is the prize above all.\n\nScience fiction films of the 1950s often dealt in veiled or slightly metaphorical ways with the new reality of the atomic age. Arch Oboler’s Five (1951), a likely immediate influence on Corman and Rusoff, proposed a similar tale of a handful of survivors holed up in a large, modern house after such a war and arguing through what world they would build after, but avoided dealing directly with the realities of nuclear war. Other films had dealt with what-if scenarios about sudden cataclysms disrupting and even ending human civilisation, like Deluge (1933), Le Fin du Monde (1933), and When Worlds Collide (1952). And still more had envisioned the shock of the new and threat of the next through monstrous figurations, as mutant atomic monsters started stalking across movie screens, from Them! (1954) to Godzilla (1954). But Day The World Ended synthesised all those influences and more, and created a new subgenre: the post-apocalyptic drama, and children run as wayward as Planet of the Apes (1968), The Omega Man (1971), Mad Max (1979), and The Matrix (1999), all dealing in different ways with the same basic proposition of a post-nuclear landscape becoming as strange, teeming, brutal, transformation-riddled, and dreamlike as Greek mythology. Its DNA could also be said to inflect the entire realm of American independent film, an idea that barely existed when Corman began, but his template of making virtues out of scarcity and constructing elemental situations became its backbone: Corman, for instance, gifted the basic template to Monte Hellman for his debut The Beast From Haunted Cave (1959), and Hellman passed on the influence through his own cinema. Wim Wenders, whose Paris, Texas (1984) describes an American landscape as alien, arid, and depopulated as Corman’s, paid it puckish tribute in his The State of Things (1983), a film about a wayward attempt to remake Corman’s film.\n\nThe tiny cadre of survivors settle down to try and outlast the fallout before they exhaust their supplies. The situation is complicated as Radek, who everyone expects to die, instead clings on to life, but seems to need no food or water. Instead, he goes out of the house at night and devours wildlife that should be inedible, contaminated as all the animals are. One night, about to consume a snared rabbit, Radek sees a strange, gnarled figure looming out of the darkness and shrubbery at the valley fringe, and flees in fear. Meanwhile Tony stews with increasing frustration as he fixates on Louise, spurning Ruby and looking for a chance of gaining the upper hand over everyone. Maddison is worried that seasonal rains might dump radioactive water on the valley, spelling their doom, but for the time being a spring-fed pond provides fresh water and a place to swim. Having a dip there one day with Ruby, Louise experiences the peculiar feeling not just of being watched but of something trying to communicate with her on some inchoate level. Eventually Radek steals away Diablo the donkey and eats him, only for the lurking being to attack and kill him: the being is a mutant, a swiftly evolved response to the new radiation-soaked Earth beyond the valley, but one that still seeks what it can only find there. The distraught Pete, after finding Diablo dead, tries to climb back into the mountains but drops dead from radiation poisoning. Maddison, trying to chase him down, also receives a dangerous dose and barely makes it back to the house. Finally the mutant dares to try and snatch Louise away, whilst Tony takes advantage of Maddison’s prostration to steal his gun and plan Rick’s murder.\n\nThe valley and the house are Corman’s Forest of Arden, his Prospero’s Island, realised in a fashion that sustains a tradition to back when Shakespeare’s players only needed to hang up a sign announcing the scene was a forest. The immune Eden encompasses the possibilities of what the world looks like boiled down to a basic dichotomy: communal selflessness versus will to power. That dichotomy, as reports transmit from the mystic mutant zone from beyond the protecting ridge suggests, is solved in favour of raw strength – Corman’s regressing version of the apes-around-the-waterhole scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The basic object of all effort is Louise, the young, unsullied mother of the future – paging another Corman acolyte, James Cameron, and his The Terminator (1984) – and who will be her mate. The three immediately vying candidates are Rick, Tony, and the mutant; Ruby, despite being only a little bit older than Louise, is nonetheless discounted, hated by Tony as the emblem of what he was forced, in his way of thinking and seeing, to settle for. Maddison is the canny prototype of a survivalist, and also an emblem of paternal authority: the island of refuge is his discovery, his construction, and despite his own misgivings and sense he tolerates his gate-crashers. Maddison is also keeper of forbidden lore: as a Navy captain he witnessed the results of atomic bomb tests, animals deliberately exposed to the fallout. Most died, but a handful mutated rapidly to weather the new climate, gaining new, tough, crusty skin and horns on the head – and in the case of a monkey, a third eye and wicked claws.\n\nThis finds its alarming rhyme when another badly irradiated and disfigured man (Jonathan Haze) tumbles into the valley. Rick and Maddison recognise his gnarled skin and changed features as resembling the test animals, and Rick realises that Radek and this man are both stages in a continuum of mutation, of which the ultimate and perfect example is the mutant stalking the valley. The man quickly dies from starvation after reporting the formation of a community of mutants, who are stronger than him and so claim all the food. When Rick tracks Radek and asks up him what he sees when he goes back over the ridge, Radek reports, “There’s wonderful things happening,” but also mentions that he has “an enemy.” As if already tuned into the wavelength of where imagination would drift in the post-World War II era, Corman conceives of the chimera produced by the atomic age as a neo-hobgoblin with the third eye of Buddhist lore and psychic powers. These transmit on levels only Louise can pick up and that only registering on the level of sensation rather than thought, flesh and sex threatening to break and reform in strange, grotesque patterns – anticipating the proto-Cronenbergian warpings of The Haunted Palace, Corman’s great blueprint for modern body horror, in particular. In a cheeky touch, Corman includes himself as Louise’s fiancé in the framed photo she keeps and discards at film’s end, whilst it’s very faintly suggested the mutant might in fact be Louise’s fiancé, radically transformed. Playing the mutant is Paul Blaisdell, a specialist in creating masks, models, and suits, who found himself the go-to man for Corman and other makes of low-budget creature features like Edward L. Cahn throughout the late 1950s.\n\nOne of Corman’s recurring, even obsessive themes in his early movies was a fascination with defining the difference between the genuinely tough, brave, hardy, streetwise, what have you, and the merely posturing, the macho, and the maniacal. It’s a question he likely figured a vast number in his audience would respond to: many of Corman’s heroes are literal and figurative little guys who prove braver and more resilient than the hulks and he-men. He’d revisit this in terms comedic (Rock All Night), revisionist of classical myth (The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent, 1957), and socially conscientious (The Intruder, when the Rick-Tony figuration is inverted and recast as the racist rabblerouser and righteous plebeian hero). The variation is straightforward in Day The World Ended, with the intelligent but still potent Rick contends with Tony, or, as they’re called at different points in the movie, “Mr All-American Hero” and “Mr Heel.” Tony is the embodiment of primeval virtue, for whom civilisation is a perpetual stymie: even in the refuge he’s only held at by Maddison who carries a gun and the key to the storeroom. Rick is at once an ideal hero but also the fallen version of something worthier, pressganged stand-in for Louise’s fiancé whilst mourning his brother, who was “studying for the ministry,” but the world needs a saviour of the flesh, not the spirit. He is, nonetheless, still two-fisted, besting Tony in their two stand-up fights. The seething, acquisitive, self-congratulatory hard-knock student Tony, declares that when he repopulates the Earth with his progeny, “They’ll be tough!” The end of the world and the reduction of the human race to a handful only winnows Tony’s feelings of frustrated strength and need down to the perfect version.\n\nMaddison, realising that survival might just be possible, lobbies for Louise to marry Rick and have children, appointing himself as the equivalent of a ship’s captain with emergency clerical powers. This all seems amusingly prim given the situation portrayed, as too is Louise and Ruby swimming together in swimsuits that wouldn’t get a deacon bothered, but the censor doth sleep no less than the atomic mutant. The dichotomy of the two female archetypes is very different to the men, signalling another quality that would distinguish Corman at the time: his female characters were a cut far above where the vast bulk of Hollywood cinema was, and sometimes still feel radical. Here basic presumptions are still in play: Louise is the “nice” girl, so prudishly dressed it borders on the satiric (like the entirely swathing nightgown she wears in the climax) versus Ruby the sexy dame. And yet Ruby is Corman’s truest figure of empathy, victim of a particular kind of misogyny not ended with the old world but perhaps only, again, rendered to pure form, as she finds herself the inferior candidate for mating and propagation. She gets along best with Pete, who she sneaks pilfered sugar to make moonshine with, watches Louise’s back, and tries to maintain Tony’s last tethers to human decency. Ruby kicks up her heels and amuses her companions by recreating her old burlesque act: “They’d give me the blue spot and then I’d give them the clincher!” she recalls with the glee of someone who’s held the eyes and groins of an audience enthralled, enacting the role of sexual a form of power and exaltation that played to a world vanished but could, in a genuinely revivified world, be powerful and beneficent. Ruby is however doomed by alternations of love and hate for her ratbag boyfriend, enacted in quick and deadly manner when she saves Louise from being raped by Tony and makes a last, desperate appeal to Tony: “What are we fighting for? We’re like a couple of kids!”, only to turn homicidally enraged when Tony spurns her: trying to stab him, Ruby instead ends up with Tony shoving the knife in her own gut, and in a startling vision of misogynist disdain, he drops her corpse over the edge of a cliff with a wiseguy kiss-off that could come right out of Raymond Chandler: “Happy landings, sweetheart.”\n\nCorman’s concise, waste-free technique contends expertly with the limited settings, as when he uses the prostrate Maddison on the couch that bisects his living room as a compositional element to complicate the space and staging, and his steady editing rhythm invisibly breaking up what is in effect a dialogue-driven chamber piece. Later Corman would know that his audience at least partly showed up to see the cheap monsters, but for the moment he makes the mutant’s first appearance a cleverly elusive, even hallucinatory moment, the creature hovering slightly out of focus in the distance, Radek looking on from the foreground. The “wonderful things” hover in the stygian mist all around, at least until the Biblically cleansing rain starts to fall. The mutant’s attempt to abduct Louise is foiled when it proves terrified of the water of the spring, and Louise manages to wriggle free and take refuge in the pool. The rain that starts falling proves to not be irradiated but instead start washes the fallout away. Representing as it does a sudden evolutionary leap to contend with a poisoned world, clean water is ironically toxic to the pathetic mutant, which dies, its corpse smoking in the downpour: Rick and Louise deduce the reason for its death and know this means other mutants won’t survive the rain either. Meanwhile Tony manages to snatch up the pistol Maddison keeps close and immediately plans to gun Rick down when he and Louise return, but he doesn’t know Rick gave Maddison another pistol for extra security, and when he realises there’s no other choice Maddison kills Tony. Maddison finally dies and Louise and Rick finally leave the valley together, with a closing note that might be just a tad excessively optimistic, but certainly fulfils the film’s parable-like form.\n\nBy the standards of Corman’s first phase, Day The World Ended is a leisurely affair at 80 minutes long – if he’d made it couple of years later it would likely have been ten to fifteen minutes shorter. It also follows suit with a lot of ‘50s sci-fi cinema in invoking religious overtones, at a time when to sell to a large audience many dabbling in the genre assumed there had to be some kind of parochial moral to what was being portrayed. This was something Corman would quickly dispense with when he realised his young audience, watching from their cars in the drive-ins between make-out sessions, didn’t really want or like. By contrast, when the moral of the story is summarised at the end of Corman’s follow-up monster movie, It Conquered The World, it’s couched entirely in terms of human qualities and potentials, distinguishing their emotional reflexes from the cold, calculating alien whose lack of feeling indicates a species without any feel for, or interest in, communal care. Rusoff wrote the script for It Conquered The World again, although Corman had Griffith give it an uncredited polish, and indeed the writing has the feel of Griffith’s involvement in the headier dialogue and quirkier humour. Again, Corman is doing the utmost with next to nothing, although now the settings stretch to a couple of different houses and interior sets, a world where famous scientists subsist in California bungalows and army bases are safely represented by some wire fencing.\n\nIt Conquered The World was the first film released under American Releasing Corporation’s new, more ambitious name of American International Pictures. This time Blaisdell was given few hundred dollars to build the monster that was to be the movie’s main attraction. Corman later, wryly commented that it taught him that movie monster shouldn’t be shorter than the leading lady, and that lady herself, Beverly Garland, reportedly snorted on seeing the creature, “That conquered the world?” The Venusian is indeed pretty blatant in its stiff articulation and rubbery stature, but is also amongst the most memorably designed and iconic of movie monsters, vaguely resembling an ambulating upturned radish with a skirting fringe of scuttling claws, two waving, pincer-capped arms, glow-in-the-dark eyes, and face twisted into a permanent evil leer. It Conquered The World gets in on the run of mid-1950s movies about alien possession and suborning with its theme of an alien invader who starts using creepy little bat-like creatures to fly around and implant control devices in chosen recipients, turning them into slaves.\n\nAnother of Corman’s recurring preoccupations emerges here, in the figure of the intelligent and inquisitive being whose private moral schemes lead them in a radically different direction to the society about them, which they consider themselves above or fatefully at odds with. Corman would later take that figure to a conceptual limit in The Masque of the Red Death’s Prince Prospero, who devoted to evil as an ethic, and Bloody Mama’s titular matriarch. Here the equivalent is Lee Van Cleef’s Dr Tom Anderson, a brilliant physicist who has nonetheless alienated himself from authorities with his impassioned antiwar activism and bizarre predictions, including theories about life on other planets being provoked by human emergence into space. Tom is first glimpsed lobbying US Defense Secretary Platt (Marshal Bradford) and General Carpenter (David McMahon) in a desperate effort to get an army-run project trying to launch satellites into space cancelled: “We’re all in a state of high hilarity,” Tom comments sardonically when the honchoes denies he’s been worrying them, “And we’ll all end up in a state of high mortality if you don’t call off this satellite project.”\n\nMeanwhile Anderson’s close friend and former colleague Dr Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) is running the project with his own, more orthodox genius and sense of duty to the fore. His team of scientists and technicians includes Dr Ellen Peters (Karyne Kadler) and Dr Pete Shelton (Griffith), and they’re trying to finally get a satellite into orbit after several failures. “I hear that satellite cost us nine million bucks,” one of the team notes, to another’s quip: “It’d be just great if she sideswiped an airliner.” Tom and Paul and their wives Claire Anderson (Garland) and Joan Nelson (Sally Fraser) have dinner together at the Andersons’ house, where Paul gets the feeling Tom is peculiarly smug about his latest satellite launch. Tom responds by showing Paul a shortwave radio setup in his living room, and lets Paul listen to a peculiar throbbing noise coming in over it, a noise that Tom says is actually the voice of an alien being he’s made contact with, one of a circle of nine, immensely advanced beings living on Venus. What Tom doesn’t tell his friend yet is that he’s been paving the way for the alien to come to Earth: Tom has given the alien information about the personnel of the project base and who exactly it needs to take control of amidst the local population in order to seize all the levers of authority. Tom’s reasons for helping the creature emerge quickly: Tom believes the alien will benignly apply its greater intelligence and will on the human race, finally cure it of warlike impulses and set the species on the path to noble betterment, a world where a man like Tom will finally be hailed as a noble visionary rather than a brilliant crank. The alien’s spacecraft crash-lands after encountering the satellite Paul’s team launched, but the alien survives and takes up residence in a cave system near the project base. The alien sends out a number of small, bat-like flying creatures to track down those selected to be controlled, including Paul and his fellow scientists on the project as well as its military overseer, General Pattick (Russ Bender), and the Sheriff of the nearby town, Shallert (Taggart Casey), as well as Joan and other wives, as Tom has told the alien they must also be controlled. The alien also uses its powers to shut down every machine in the surrounding countryside, save those belonging to Tom and the subjugated: in a miniature remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), trains, cars, and industrial machines crawl to a halt.\n\nAt first glance It Conquered The World seems fairly conventional in its mid-1950s social presumptions, with its pair of dutiful housewife-partners framing the core clash of rebel antihero, a study in warning about and professional intellectual dissenters crossing the line into outright disloyalty through utter conviction they’re doing right, versus the firmly with-the-program hero. Add to this to the way the alien mimics a particular kind of propagandist ideal of what a Communist was supposed to act like – lacking familiar moral standards, acting according to emotionless expedience and absorbing other consciousnesses into its own, blank, gestalt identity. As the film unfolds, however, Corman has great fun revising and toying with those precepts. The alien proves instead a caricature of arch individualism, as Paul realises, acting without any understanding of human empathy as above all the underpinning of a social animal. Paul has to become the anarchic and ruthless guerrilla warrior within his own little backwater. The wives are soon split between the conformity-pushing, in the shape of the controlled Joan, thrusting one of the bat-creatures at her husband with a smile of pleasure straight out of a TV commercial evangelising a miracle cleaning product, and Claire, the seething defender of both home and species, who becomes increasingly determined and irate in provoking her husband’s conscience before marching off with rifle in hand to confront the alien invader. The military hierarchy, in the form of Pattick, is easily controlled, and his watchwords of paranoia readily tweaked to serve the alien’s quarantining needs precisely.\n\nAll that’s left of army power capable of intervening is a unit of bewildered GIs tramping about the landscape as if trapped in their own private Beckett play. Here we get the essential Corman double act, of Dick Miller as the stern, rugged, but confused sergeant Neil, and Haze as Ortiz, ethnic comic relief, an obscurely accented, clumsy, but attentive private who notes the “funny-looking bird” that keeps flitting overhead. Cruel satire on the spectacle of repression of civil rights protestors comes when Paul happens upon the controlled sheriff casually gunning down elderly newspaper editor Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) for his refusal to obey orders. Paul’s sense of logic dictates that anyone possessed by the alien is “my enemy,” and takes this to the still rather shocking limit of shooting Joan after she attempts to plug him into the alien’s soothing mainstream of mindless obedience. Corman’s jocular cynicism extends to the dead-eyed violence that dots the film, from Tom setting Shallert on fire with his blowtorch after he changes sides, to one of the suborned scientists at the rocket range calmly reciting instructions over the radio whilst his colleague throttles Ellen to death, after she is horrified to find the bat-creatures that delivered their control devices in a putrefying stack stashed in a locker: the cool, post-gender landscape of scientific research suddenly becomes the scene of proto-slasher movie stuff. Corman’s images become increasingly charged with evocations of extreme threat but all couched in everyday and domestic settings – Claire beholding her husband dutifully oiling up his rifle to get ready to kill his friend and lurking behind decorative bars that became a cage cutting her off from her husband, and Paul pulling out his pistol to gun down his wife and then clutching her body whilst sobbing.\n\nWhilst dotted with such episodes of surprisingly hard-edged violence and weirdness, It Conquered The World is like Day The World Ended finally propelled by character interaction, with the two scientists duelling with a kind of violence manifest in thought and attitude, violence that never becomes physical between them as Tom in particular tries to maintain the indulgent reasonableness of a man confident he’s about to be proven right. The rest of the action can be seen as mere illustration of the clash of their differing philosophies. Science fiction epic spills over into domestic drama, the two different marriages proving battlegrounds the alien war is fought on. Joan’s possession and Paul’s slaying of her sparks Tom’s appalled bewilderment: “She was still your wife – still Joan! You would have been one with her…”, to Paul’s hard, disgusted retort that she had become his enemy in a war that Tom has foisted on them all. Hard as it to see the roguish Van Cleef with his vulture-like, lunging physique as anyone’s idea of a famous scientist, he does a great job regardless of selling his character’s mix of fanatical fervour and friendly indulgence, as when he assures Paul over the phone that since he’s destroyed his control unit and can’t be possessed for at least a week he might as well come over a drink. But the scotch-sipping palsiness of Tom and Paul doesn’t disguise the sharp angles of their duels of language. “Makes me look back into history for comparison,” Tom comments when Paul notes the alien’s ruthless methods. “Comparison or rationalisation?” Paul retorts. Finally the alien, tired of Paul marauding and upsetting their plans, decides it can’t wait to muzzle him and commands Tom to kill his friend. And Tom seems to shoulder this responsibility in the name of the greater good.\n\nMeanwhile Claire, marvellous played by Garland, personally embodies a paradigm in her moment of his history, trying to live according to the ideal of wifely duty, a duty that demands she incessantly harass her husband over his increasingly dubious life choices, the old job talk transmogrified into a running debate on the ethics of intergalactic treason. As treason unfolds, Claire finds herself made militant and obliged to go out and face the being that is both organ of and puppet master for Tom’s galactic-sized ego. In the process she evolves into a rough draft for Ellen Ripley in her furious, alien-slayer resolve. “Look, I don’t know if you can hear me or not,” she barks over the radio at the alien she now sees as her personal nemesis, “But if you can you listen good – I hate your living guts for what you’ve done to my husband and to my world! I know you for the coward you are and I’m gonna kill you!” The steals the rifle Tom intends to use on Paul and ventures into the caves. There she’s confronted by the creature: “You think you’re gonna make a slave of the world? I’ll see you in hell first!” she snarls as she plugs the sneering creature. But the alien proves invulnerable to both bullets and invective, and Claire dies nastily in its pincers. A sorry end for a character who today would be onto her fourth franchise instalment. Tom and Paul overhear her death through the radio, finally shocking Tom out of all his illusions about the alien’s nature.\n\nOrtiz hears Claire’s screams whilst he’s foraging, as he fetches his comrades. Too late to save Claire, they battle the monster within and outside the cave. Meanwhile Paul visits the rocket range and guns down the possessed there, whilst Tom improvises a weapon with the blowtorch and kills the sheriff to get hold of his working car. Arriving at the cave, Tom is in time to see the soldiers being slaughtered by the alien on the rampage, but he manages to approach the alien which thinks it still his stooge, only for Tom to declare with savage reckoning, “I made you welcome to this Earth – you made it a charnel house!” He plunges the blowtorch into one of the Venusian’s eyes: the alien swipes him in agonised retaliation, and monster and scientist both topple over dead, Tom lying in the alien’s cold embrace. Corman’s laconic direction sharpens here and there with flashes of the inspired, like the sight of the alien’s gleaming eyes in deep shadow as it advances on Claire, and suddenly at the very end he goes for a concluding note of threadbare cinematic poetry, cutting between the various littered corpses left behind by the drama, as Paul makes account of the meaning of it all: “There can’t be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves,” Paul notes by way of eulogy when he arrives too late: “It has to come from inside – from Man himself.” A fascinating sign-off to a movie from the era, contrasting the usual moral along the lines of “there are some things man is not meant to know,” with Corman’s own, distinct variation: humanity must know itself before it can know anything. And in this idea, Corman had found the key to his career’s preoccupations. That, and making much out of practically nothing."
