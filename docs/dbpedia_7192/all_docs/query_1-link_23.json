Turkish director Orçun Behram explores the mayhem in the surreal, political body-horror film THE ANTENNA, and talks with us about how it came to be.\n\nDirect download: MM-801_The_Antenna_v01_Tagged.mp3\n\nCategory: Podcast -- posted at: 4:43pm EDT\n\nDeath abides, but not often easily. In BURNING GHOST, a young man ferries lost souls to the afterlife, until love distracts him from his mission, while in A WHITE, WHITE DAY, a policeman investigates the possibility that his recently deceased wife was having an affair.

Bela Lugosi horror(?) film, SCARED TO DEATH, and treat it to a daringly new concept in film analysis, one that's never been seen before and certainly has absolutely no connection to MST3K or CINEMATIC TITANIC or RIFFTRAX, or anything like that. (And if there appears to be resemblance, well, we came up with it first and our lawyers are going to be in touch with all of those guys in the morning, believe you me.)\n\nA few notes:\n\nThis was Bela Lugosi's only color film, not that it did him much good.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a video file. We've adjusted the compression to make it as small as possible, but it'll still take a bit longer to download.\n\nBecause of the file size, the video quality will be a bit scrubby -- particularly on larger screens -- but should be good enough.\n\nAnd we'd love to actually finish the rest of the film, so if you like what you see, give us a holler and let us know!\n\nSome thoughts on the 50th anniversary of Star Trek.\n\nDirect download: HotW-421_2016-09-08_Star_Trek_50th_Review_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Hour of the Wolf -- posted at: 3:51pm EDT\n\nReview of Laika's Kubo and the Two Strings.\n\nDirect download: HotW-417_2016-08-25_Kubo_and_the_Two_Strings_Review_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Hour of the Wolf -- posted at: 3:48pm EDT\n\nLet's not mince words about this: THE VAMPIRE'S COFFIN is a goofy movie, a Mexican horror-fest with rubber bats, balsa wood coffins, poorly choreographed fight scenes, and a \"hero\" (the star of THE BRAINIAC, actually) who caps off practically every scene by coming close to wetting his pants. It also happens to be a surprisingly good-looking film, with cinematographer Victor Herrera ripping whole reams from the German expressionist playbook for his set up. Which makes for an unusual ToB episode in which Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale, Orenthal Hawkins, and Dan Persons explore the paradox between production and content as much as they explore the film's copious flaws.

Sorry to disappoint you, but likely they climb up on the couch and go to sleep. Ever wonder what kind of film Syfy runs when nobody's watching? Very likely it's ICETASTROPHE, a virtual non-entity of a natural disaster movie in which a meteor somehow manages to put an isolated mountain town under a deadly deep freeze and nobody, not even the people being frosted over, cares.\n\nCome join the Temple of Bad team of Orenthal Hawkins, Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale (whose formidable editing kung fu saved this show from slipping into the \"Lost Episode\" category), and Dan Persons as they slap themselves in the face (not to keep warm, just to stay awake), and take on a film that makes your basic snowman look like an icon of flamboyant excess.\n\nDirect download: ToB-402_Icetastrophe_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Temple of Bad -- posted at: 4:33pm EDT\n\nOh, sure, anybody can look at a ROBOT MONSTER, a BIRDEMIC, a XANADU and say, \"Wow, that's stinky.\" It takes next-level insight to take on the likes of PATCH TOWN, an ambitious tale of a grown up Cabbage Patch doll breaking out of the gulag-like factory where he's enslaved to find the little girl who loved him many years ago.\n\nIn facing the German-expressionist production style of a Tim Burton, a Sovietesque mise-en-scene, a bit of Cronenberg body-horror, and lashings of Danny Elfman-like musical comedy(?!), the regular Temple of Bad team of Andrea Lipinski, Orenthal Hawkins, Kevin Lauderdale, and Dan Persons bring all of their kung fu to this admittedly impressive and frankly weird, weird, weird exercise in dark whimsy, and prove they are up to the challenge.\n\nClick on the player to hear the show, or right-click the title to download.\n\nDirect download: ToB-401_Patch_Town_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Temple of Bad -- posted at: 9:56am EDT\n\nSoooo much to cover in one, brief segment! First, I look at the French animated film APRIL AND THE EXTRAORDINARY WORLD, and how it takes on the genre of steampunk in a way few steampunkers dare to consider. Then I have some belated thoughts on the entertaining comic book movie, DEADPOOL, and highlight a standout performance in the gory Turkish(!) horror film, BASKIN. Finally, I celebrate the documentary that celebrates the artist Chet Zar, I LIKE TO PAINT MONSTERS, and alert retro-horror fans to the delights of a new homevid collection, THE AMERICAN HORROR PROJECT, VOLUME 1. Then it's time for light lunch, but that's outside of your realm of interest, isn't it?\n\nClick on the player button to hear the segment; right-click the link to download, and in all cases, SPEAK OUT AGAINST TRUMP.\n\nDirect download: HotW-407_2016-03-24_April_and_the_Extraordinary_World__Review_v01_podcast.mp3\n\nCategory:general -- posted at: 2:43pm EDT\n\nHere's a curious thing: A fun, funny, action-packed animated family film that just by happenstance strikes at the very core of the ugliness behind the presidential campaign of a certain, stubby-fingered, orange-American. Couldn't have been by design, not with production schedules for CG animation being what they are, but there it is: ZOOTOPIA -- anthropomorphized animals against Trumpism. Couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nAlso in this review, my take on near-future hipster comedy CREATIVE CONTROL, and Terrence Malick's introspective KNIGHT OF CUPS.\n\nClick the player to hear the review, or right-click the link to download.\n\nDirect download: HotW-406_2016-03_17_Zootopia_Review_v02_mp3.mp3\n\nCategory:Hour of the Wolf -- posted at: 11:20am EDT\n\n2016 marks the 40th anniversary of the film that changed the entertainment industry as we know it, the film the rewrote the rules on action entertainment, that dazzled audiences with its innovative special effects, that forever lodged in popular culture the notion that exciting adventures awaited audiences a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nOh, wait a minute... STAR WARS debuted in 1977. In 1976, we got the Dino De Laurentiis remake of KING KONG, the film that did absolutely nothing for the industry, special effects, or the public's gas shortage-ravaged attitudes. Come join Kevin Lauderdale, Orenthal Hawkins, Andrea Lipinski, and Dan Persons as delve deep into this gorilla-shaped turkey, and try to get the world's biggest monkey off their backs.\n\nDirect download: ToB-304_King_Kong_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Temple of Bad -- posted at: 4:31pm EDT\n\n(Sung to the tune of Maniac):\n\nA Satanist who can zip out of chains.\n\nHe is suave, and he's smart, and clumsy.\n\nHe gropes all the chicks, and eats his victim's brains,\n\nEverybody says he's eeeee-vil.\n\nHe gets burned at the stake, but is feeling no pain.\n\nHe knows it's just a matter of time,\n\nThree hundred years in fact, that he's coming right back,\n\nTo suck out brains with his big, floppy tongue.\n\nHe can freeze you with a look,\n\nBut you'll just look like a schnook,\n\n'Cause you should have known by now:\n\nHe's a Brainiac, Brainiac with some style,\n\nAnd to eat your brains is the thing that makes him smile.\n\nHe's a Brainiac, Brainiac who's intense,\n\nAnd his vengeance really don't make no damn sense.\n\nYes, in a long-delayed but well-worth-waiting-for Temple of Bad, Orenthal Hawkins (who brainstormed the soulful ballad above), Andrea Lipinski and Kevin Lauderdale, and Dan Persons take on the goofy Mexican horror film, The Brainiac. Bad makeup, crappy sets, and ridiculous effects rule the day!

The Machine? Surely you must mean Ex Machina, the dark, sensual drama about a young programmer falling into the thrall of an eerily human-like android, the film that grabbed so much attention earlier this year. That's the film you're talking about, right?\"\n\nNo, no I'm actually talking about The Machine, another film entirely. But in an curious way, I'm talking about Ex Machina as well, because it turns out there are some interesting parallels between the two films, in sufficient quantity that I think it's well-worth discussion.

Much like Cahiers du Cinema, we seek to enshrine the world of film as a true artform, analyzing the efforts its creators' invest in fulfilling their unique visions, and exploring how the results serve to elevate humanity's understanding of itself and the universe.\n\nAnd then a film comes along that features a group of astromauts on a mission to discover if there's life on Uranus, and all that goes out the window. A Danish/American co-production starring that ambulatory hunk o' granite, John Agar, Journey to the Seventh Planet is a film whose supreme silliness only starts with the sophomoric opportunities offered by its central premise. Come join the Temple of Bad team of Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale, and Orenthal Hawkins as they take on a tale that isn't satisfied with giving filmgoers a giant, mutant, cyclopean rat when a giant, mutant, and quite noisy, spider, plus a bevy of women in filmy negligees, can be thrown in as well.

Self/less was the \"serious\" opening last weekend -- directed by overt stylist Tarsem Singh, starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley -- and the worst sin that could be levelled at it was that it was kind of stoopid. But then, the weekend also saw the debut of a couple of more compelling releases: Jellyfish Eyes, a family film send-up directed by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami; and the delirious Korean noir comedy A Hard Day.

If your first thought when you hear the phrase, \"found-footage mockumentary\" is a sincere wish that somebody should have released a Web virus long ago to wipe every copy of The Blair Witch Project off every server on Earth, that's certainly understandable. So I'm aware of the risk I'm taking by going on record to say that The Midnight Swim -- a moody, enigmatic found-footage ghost story about three sisters discovering the ominous mystery surrounding the lake that claimed their mother's life -- demonstrates there's still something new and moving to be discovered in this debased genre.

Which is ironic, because that is pretty much what this film -- directed by Brad Bird, who co-scripted with Damon Lindeloff -- is about. It is, of course, easier to get excited about the future when you know George Clooney is going to waiting around there for you; but a well-sculpted profile can go only so far in making the dream of jet-packs, hover trains, and interplanetary commuter runs a reality.

The good in this case: Yours truly has made the move to the lovely city of Philadelphia, a process that led to the extended delay of this episode. The bad: the film we're discussing, of course. The SF-comedy Invasion of the Star Creatures tries to mimic the slapped-together-fast-n-cheap success of Little Shop of Horrors -- with Horrors star Jonathan Haze stepping into the role of screenwriter -- but pretty much blows everything it attempts, most prominently any attempt at humor (unless you think grievously stereotyped Native Americans and a subterranean rewrite of an old Scooby-Doo chase gag repeated ad nauseum is downright high-larious).\n\nCome join Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale, Orenthal V.

Interesting thing, though: You can play the game with fictional characters, too, and learn something about corporate decision making in the modern-day film industry. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen, the smart, courageous protagonist of THE HUNGER GAMES franchise. Whatever happened to her?

Whether you watched it all the way through or just paused long enough to think, Huhn, what's this all about?, it turns out that the film, which has been knocking around since the 1950's, is just the tip of a visionary iceberg that was taken away from its creators, the director Paul Grimaut and the poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert, and released unfinished without their permission. It took some thirty years to complete the project, and another thirty-odd years for it to get its U.S. release. Now, under the title The King and the Mockingbird, the film is making its way into theaters this Friday, and kid, it was well worth the wait.

The film fundamentally changed the way I thought about science fiction, narrative story-telling, and the nature of film itself. Not that I was cognizant of all of that at the time -- I was twelve fer chrissake -- but something in that film set the switch that eventually led to the obsessive film nerd you see before you today.\n\nSo when Christopher Nolan lards copious references to that most hallowed of space epics throughout his own epically-proportioned Interstellar -- robots that look like monoliths; resonant organ chords that echo the last few seconds of Also Sprach Zarathustra, no less than two, maybe even three, stargate-like experiences, etc, etc. -- it's hard not to regard it as not so much heartfelt homage as a throwing down of the gauntlet.

But among the many marvels borne of those shores, truly the most wondrous has to be the knock-off film, a genre that took groundbreaking, innovative American titles and replicated them with a low-budget zeal and enough questionable technical prowess to make them their own classics. Loved Jaws? Wait’ll you see Tentacles, the Italian version that features a giant octopus (plus the all-star quadrifecta of John Huston, Henry Fonda, Shelley Winters, and Claude Akins!). Got nightmares from The Exorcist? You should check out The Return of the Exorcist, which, despite the title, has neither Jason Miller nor Max von Sydow in the lead, but does offer Richard Conte in his final performance.\n\nAnd if you just couldn’t get enough of Star Wars, then the ever-inventive Italian filmmakers were willing to feed your hunger with Starcrash, a faithful replication of Chapter IV: A New Hope — if by “faithful” one means cheesy special effects, hammy acting and a storyline so muddled that audiences couldn’t help but proclaim, “Y’know, The Phantom Menace wasn’t that bad.” Forsaking their Jedi code, Temple of Bad residents Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale, and I allow ourselves a flirtation with the Dark Side, one that here also claimed the souls of Caroline Munro, Marjoe Gortner, Christopher Plummer and (swoon) David Hasselhoff.

A brilliant comedian with a lightning-fast mind, Lewis has bested interviewers with far more supple intellects than yours truly. To add to my anxiety, I went into the discussion having watched DRUNKS, the 1995 feature film in which Lewis reveals a rarely seen facility for soul-searing drama. Fully aware of his range and his skill, I knew this discussion was going to be working at a wholly different level than my typical, cozy little chats.\n\nAnd, bless him, Lewis was great.

After all, TWC's previous effort in this arena was Vampire Academy, and that blatant mish-mosh of Harry Potter, Twilight, The Hunger Games, and whatever else has been luring adolescent females to the theaters didn't go down too smoothly.\n\nServing as definite counter-balance to my trepidations: the presence at the helm of Phillip Noyce, a very good director who becomes even better when telling tales of people finding the inner resources to confront near-insurmountable, social challenges.

TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES doing quite well, thank you very much.

However, since even the big tent-poles can now be somewhat inconsequential in their story-telling and quality (AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, anyone?), it’s become less surprising that a dog-day release could have been just as welcome, if not more so, in the months preceding.\n\nSuch is the case with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, a fun space adventure based on a Marvel comic book that racked up record box office in its opening week, and earns its good will in a number of ways.

After that, of course, anything goes: I ORIGINS continues director Mike Cahill’s ongoing exploration of humanity’s interconnectedness through the tale of a dedicated, eye-obsessed scientist (Mike Cahill) having his adherence to objective reasoning challenged by the mystical outlook of an exotic model (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) with equally exotic eyeballs; while MOOD INDIGO lets director Michel Gondry explore the artificiality of certain, idealized brands of French romance through the story of how the wacky life of an eccentric inventor (Romain Duris) is overthrown when the health of his wife (Audrey Tatou) is threatened.\n\nAnother way to distinguish these films: They aren’t equally successful in their goals.

Why is the sequel to RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES called DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES? I mean, \"dawn\" suggests a beginning, right? And you can't actually rise until you begin, right? So shouldn't the titles of these films be reversed? Then again, that first film wasn't really focused on the planet of the apes beginning, but on the events that eventually led to that beginning. And this newest film isn't so much about the planet's rise as one glimpse into how humanity loses its foothold to the newly born society of intelligent simians. But then, I guess EVENTS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING AND HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT UPON THE DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES and ONE CHAPTER THAT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES wouldn't quite pop on movie posters, would it?

EDGE OF TOMORROW makes good sport of it, coming up with a pretty keen action film and allowing Tom Cruise to play comedy beats better than he did in KNIGHT AND DAY. But, given the mind-bending possibilities inherent in the genre, it seems almost a crime not delve for deeper meanings than just \"craven coward becomes kick-ass action hero.\" GROUNDHOG DAY did it. So did TIMECRIMES. So did FUTURAMA (numerous times).\n\nAnd now, so does COHERENCE. The tale of a Los Angeles dinner party that goes all kinds of wrong when a comet begins warping the dimensions, the film -- directed by James Ward Byrkit, the man who helped create the freaky \"family\" film RANGO, and starring BUFFY's Nicholas Brendon, Emily Baldoni and Maury Sterling, among others -- manages to be as much a commentary on relationships and the fragility of the social contract as it is an sf mindfreak. I delve into the film in my review for HOUR OF THE WOLF, and, as bonus, also take a look at the latest episode of the fan-produced STAR TREK CONTINUES and IDW's first Star Trek: New Visions photo-novella, both of which, in another example of the crossing of the timelines, deal with the aftermath of the Enterprise crew's visit to the mirror universe in \"Mirror, Mirror.\" Weeeeeeeird.

As a techie, I want to embrace any technology that’ll expand the cinemagoing experience, but even I have to concede that most of the time 3D is employed as little more than an add-on, just a way to charge extra for stuff that’d be the same with or with depth (visual, that is. We’ll save a discussion of dramatic depth for another day).\n\nWhich is why I’m usually jazzed to check out the latest release from DreamWorks Animation. More often than not, those folk go the extra distance with 3D, using it to enhance both the visual canvas and the dramatic impact of their films. That was definitely the case with the original HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, the 2010 fantasy adventure where the third dimension became an active player in an already entertaining and visually stunning film.\n\nSo, yeah, there I was at my local multiplex, shelling out the extra bucks for my 3D experience with the new HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2. Did I feel this new adventure — in which the young, Viking dragon-rider Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) faces down a powerful warlord (Djimon Hounsou) and has a family reunion with his long-lost mother (Cate Blanchett) — paid back my investment?

I went into EDGE OF TOMORROW a little nervous, knowing this much about it: that Tom Cruise played a soldier who, by some trick of the time-space continuum, was reliving over and over his death during a disastrous attack on an alien invasion force. Sounded intriguing, no question. But it also smacked, in general conception if not plot specifics, uncomfortably of last year’s OBLIVION, where Tom Cruise played a survivor of an alien invasion who was also confronted with the mystery behind his own existence. What was doubly dismaying was that I could conceive of a possible explanation for EDGE’s protagonist that would parallel a major revelation in OBLIVION. If that was the case, it’d be game over for me. I liked OBLIVION just fine, but there was no need to revisit it.\n\nA lot of people may have been thinking the same way — not too long before EDGE’s release, the good folks over at Warner Bros. altered their ad campaign, filling in a bit more about what Cruise’s character was going through. That put me more at ease, but I was still concerned that, like Cruise’s soldier, we’d be reliving the same day over again.\n\nHere’s the good news: EDGE OF TOMORROW is not OBLIVION redux. But here’s the conundrum: As a result, the pendulum may have swung too far in the opposite direction. I explore the problem in my latest review for Jim Freund’s HOUR OF THE WOLF.

There were clearly commercial reasons why the latest chapter in the X-MEN franchise had to be a time travel tale: Having previously flubbed the introduction of a new, younger Professor X and Magneto (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, respectively) in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, the producers clearly wanted to recover a bit of the franchise's mojo by bringing back the old band -- namely Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen under the direction of Bryan Singer, plus Hugh Jackman -- while also trying to finesse the audience into a better appreciation for their replacements. The side benefit is that the time period decided upon for this film has interesting significance for themes explored in the X-MEN universe, and, after my quick review of the surprisingly decent MALEFICENT, I turn my attention to what Singer has wrought.

I had to delay my viewing of GODZILLA ’til Sunday, meantime trying to avoid the various hosannas and the occasional nay-say (not to mention Steve Biodrowski’s own in-depth analysis) being splattered all over Facebook, Twitter, etc. An impossible task, it turns out, and I went into the theater a little anxious over whether what little feedback had filtered through to me was somehow going to skew my reaction, for good or ill.\n\nHappily, I was well pleased with GODZILLA. Not staggered, no, but grateful that director Gareth Edwards managed to pay homage to the history of the franchise while adding some crucial elements to the exercise, elements that I explore in my review for WBAI 99.5FM’s HOUR OF THE WOLF.

It is the perfect model of the drive-in B-movie, a sublime mix of papier-mache creatures, suggestive sexuality, and dodgy science, with just a bit of cold-war philosophy thrown in for tang. This is one of Roger Corman’s earliest films, and despite the bare-bones budget and having the ever-pressing theme of identity loss being delivered via the medium of giant, telepathic crabs with big, googly eyes, the master of the B’s makes it sixty minutes of pure hoot.\n\nThe Temple of Bad team of Andrea Lipinski, Kevin Lauderdale, Orenthal Hawkins, and Dan Persons welcome their special guest, Cinefantastique Online’s Steve Biodrawski, to giggle along at the silliness, praise the kind of good-bad film that’s all too rare but always welcome, and make far too many references to drawn butter.

That film has already caused so much pain (mostly from brain-strain as one struggles to figure out how such a major project could go so wrong), that it doesn’t really deserve any more attention. Let’s focus instead on something more worthy of attention: a dystopic, Kafkaesque comedy called THE DOUBLE, based on a novella by Dostoevsky and starring Jesse Eisenberg as a mousy little bureaucrat who finds his life upended when his job hires a charismatic and morally-challenged new employee who looks exactly like him. The film is directed by Richard Ayoade — known for his involvement with THE IT CROWD and GARTH MARENGHI’S DARKPLACE — and he uses his facility with unhinged humor to good effect on this sardonic glimpse into one man’s crisis of identity.

Which is cool -- I mean, the film, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the promises of its premise, but the notion of what happens to humanity as it begins to intersect more and more with technology is so potent that I feel an examination of what director Wally Pfister did right and wrong in exploring the concept is still worthwhile. So, tardy though it may be, please enjoy this latest segment.\n\n(Interestingly, HotWolf host Jim Freund liked last week's review of 23:59 -- which was intended only to run on the Web -- so much that he also included it in this week's show.

Long-time anchorman and host Robert Knight passed away over the weekend, and so HOUR OF THE WOLF is being pre-empted this week for a special tribute to the man. This kind of thing will happen — not always for unfortunate circumstances; there are always pledge drives and the like to account for — and since in this case I want to hold my TRANSCENDENCE review for when the show comes back next week, I figured this would be a good time to experiment with doing stand-alone review segments featuring films that maybe didn’t get the attention they deserved upon release, or that fall into genres that HotWolf host Jim Freund doesn’t want to feature on his show, such as horror.\n\nOr, in this case, both, since we’ll be talking about 23:59, an evocative horror film out of, of all places, Singapore, that got a home video release in the U.S. last year, and is still available in DVD and streaming form on Amazon (so it’s a perfect time to use the CFQ link to get a look).

That was good, because I reeeeeeally wanted to review UNDER THE SKIN, but constraints -- both on time and finances -- meant that I needed a good reason to get to it. Since we were committed to reviewing CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER -- an okay film, but not really more than that -- on the CINEFANTASTIQUE SPOTLIGHT the week UNDER THE SKIN was debuting, Jim's advocacy was just the motivation I required.\n\nSo let it be noted, in case you had any doubt, that this confirms Jim Freund's status as a fighter on the side of the angels. I've had a cautious relationship with UNDER THE SKIN director Jonathan Glazer -- I felt SEXY BEAST was good but overrated, and BIRTH was... odd -- but there's no such caution here. In telling the tale of an alien predator who takes the form of Scarlett Johansson and stalks the highways of Scotland, Glazer seems to have found the perfect stage for his restrained approach to storytelling.

Pretty damn frustrating, it turns out. OCULUS tells the tale of an orphaned brother and sister who reunite as adults to destroy the mirror that turned their father into a homicidal maniac, yet despite casting DOCTOR WHO's Karen Gillan in the lead, finding unique ways of styling flashback sequences so that past impinges on present and vice versa, and stuffing its scenario full of such spooky stuff as hostile, spectral presences, mind-bending hallucinations, and a guest walk-on by the Weeping Angels, the whole winds up decidedly less than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe Cinefantastique Online team of Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French, and Dan Persons get together to express that fascination about a film that has so much and falls so short, and to try to figure out what prevents this latest Blumhouse (or as it's now being called, BH Productions) release from rising to its potential.

Not that things are totally restrained, here, what with an attack by a giant, incontinent ant-man, weird (really weird) robot sex, and a widowed male scientist so dedicated to his sons that he breast-feeds them (yeah: ew).

That’s as much for convenience’s sake as anything else — it’s clearly not fiction, so what else could it be? Except in no way does the film hew to conventional notions of documentary storytelling. Filmmakers Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel brought a multitude of cameras onto a commercial fishing vessel, mounted them to boards, fixtures, and sometimes the crewmembers themselves, then cut the resulting footage into a non-narrative film that’s beautiful, mysterious, disorienting, and somehow revelatory.

Instead, what triple-threat producer/writer/special effects artist Frank R.

LOOK OF LOVE starts in the late fifties and wends its way through the both decades and venues that include men's clubs, bawdy legitimate theater, and the magazine industry to tell the tale of a man making himself the center of a sexual revolution, even as the relationships with his wife (Anna Friel), lover (Tamsin Egerton) and daughter (Imogen Poots) deteriorate.\n\nI got a chance to speak with Winterbottom about reviving Raymond's world for the screen and how Steve Coogan brought the man to life.\n\nDirect download: MMP720_Michael_Winterbottom_on_LOOK_0F_LOVE_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Drama -- posted at: 3:27pm EDT\n\nCo-Director Pierre Coffin invents his own gibberish...

How about Sandra Bullock as a Type A, by-the-book FBI agent clashing up against Melissa McCarthy as a loose-cannon Boston police detective as they try to take down a drug lord? THE HEAT isn’t shy about acknowledging its debts to the buddy-cop comedies of yore, but throws in a few, gender-twisted wrinkles all its own (you never saw Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in a drunken hug-dance, did you?).\n\nWriter Katie Dippold makes her feature film debut with THE HEAT, after logging time on the writing staffs of MADTV and PARKS AND RECREATION. I sat down with her to discuss her spin on this hallowed genre, and her experience working on-set with director Paul Feig.\n\nDirect download: MMP719_Katie_Dippold_on_THE_HEAT_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:general -- posted at: 11:17am EDT\n\nEvery now and then, we pause in awe of the people we've had the opportunity to spend time with. Doug Trumbull, John Kricfalusi, and Paul Verhoeven in earlier years, Armin Shimerman and Frank Oz more recently -- now it's Martin Landau's turn, and we couldn't be happier.\n\nIn an extended and wide-ranging interview, we got a chance to discuss the length and breadth of Martin's career. In the course of talking about his roles in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, and his Oscar-winning portrayal of Bela Lugois in ED WOOD -- and much, much more -- Martin provides insights on the art of acting, shares anecdotes from the set, and talks about the sometimes seamy politics that drive the film industry. It is, all told, a fascinating exploration of the life of an actor.\n\nDirect download: CFQi-112_Martin_Laundau_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Cinefantastique -- posted at: 2:09pm EDT\n\nBreaking through the clichés is what writer/director Sally El Hosaini is all about. Her debut feature, MY BROTHER THE DEVIL, is about Egyptians living in London, and there isn't a terrorist among them. There are, however, artists, students, drug dealers, petty thieves, and in the middle of it, two brothers, elder Rashid (James Floyd) and younger Mo (Fadi Elsayed), the former drifting away from his life of crime, the latter being slowly seduced into it. But if you think this is PUBLIC ENEMY filtered through the Quran, guess again. When Rashid finds himself falling in love with a handsome photographer, it's clear Hosaini is prepared to take the audience to places Jimmy Cagney never dreamed of visiting.\n\nWe got a chance to talk with Sally El Hosaini and James Floyd.

What it turns out to be is an acerbic comedy in which Fraser, as an American emigre moved to Belfast for personal, and very messy, reasons, finds himself in the middle of a hostage crisis as bits of his past begin to catch up with him. The film was written and directed Terry George, who was previously responsible for such phenomenal dramas as IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER and HOTEL RWANDA, and here uses those more serious tools to bring some credible edge to the comedy.\n\nI was able to speak with Brendan Fraser about the film.

When, in the new comedy REALITY, he's called in to audition for a spot on the Italian edition of BIG BROTHER, the siren song of fame so distracts him that he's soon losing sight of such small details as making a living. Director Matteo Garrone takes the naturalistic intensity he poured into his crime film GOMORRAH and applies it to this sly tale of ambition gone way, way wrong. I got to talk to Garrone about what motivated his move to (adimittedly dark) comedy, what it was like shooting at the legendary Cinecittà studios, and the unorthodox background of his lead actor.

It may be the most gripping, devastating, insightful film you'll see ever. The tale of an elderly couple descending into isolation and desperation as the husband (Jean-Louis Trintignant) tends to a wife (Emmanuelle Riva) succumbing slowly to the damages of a stroke, the film demonstrates not only the expected, unsparing intensity of director Michael Haneke (CACHÉ, THE WHITE RIBBON), but also his skillful empathy in portraying humans coping with impossible, but all-too-common, circumstances, as well as his knack for catching audiences unawares with a radical example of what true love actually is. The film's an unforgettable experience; the best I've seen this year.\n\nThis episode features a press roundtable with Haneke recorded during the New York Film Festival, as the director discusses the movie and gives us some insight into his approach to filmmaking.\n\nDirect download: MMP629_Michael_Haneke_on_AMOUR_v02.mp3\n\nCategory:Drama -- posted at: 4:06pm EDT\n\nThe journey will be long, the challenges daunting, the popcorn very likely stale. But that doesn't matter now -- the grand epic that is the three-part, film adaptation of THE HOBBIT is upon us with the release of the first installment: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY. Having braved the onslaught of orcs, goblins, and restless eight-year-0lds, beabetterbooktalker.com's Andrea Lipinski joins Cinefantastique Online's Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French, and Dan Persons to discuss whether director Peter Jackson has taken what started as a compact, nimble fantasy tale and managed to elaborate on it in a way that will entrance audiences enough to make them sign on for all three films. They also delve into the film's introduction of High Frame Rate (HFR) projection technology for screenings at certain venues, and what effect the process has on the viewing experience.\n\nAlso: What's coming to theaters next week.\n\nDirect download: csl_3-50_the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Fantasy Film -- posted at: 11:16am EDT\n\nSome people's pasts come back to haunt them; some come back to kill them. In Peter Ho-Sun Chan's martial arts film, DRAGON, Donnie Yen plays a loving husband living with his wife and child in a small, Chinese village at the beginning of the twentieth century. But when he seemingly inadvertently foils a robbery attempt, the investigation by a dedicated detective (Tekeshi Kaneshiro) reveals that the humble villager may not be all he seems. As the truth comes out in layers of deception and revelation, it becomes more and more obvious that the village savior also has a family past, one that could doom him, his loved ones, and anyone who knows him.\n\nYen not only stars in the film, but also was responsible for the action sequences, and the combination of intriguing storyline with eye-dazzling martial arts sequences makes this one of the best entertainments to come out of Hong Kong in a while. We were delighted to talk to Yen about how it all came together.

Quintel credit for coming up with a title that works in ironic counterpoint to itself. On the one hand, the Cartoon Network series is an examination of young people entering the workforce in modern America, with all the friction, tension, and social and moral quandaries that might ensue. On the other, said young people include a giant blue jay, his best-friend raccoon, and their boss, a giant, walking gumball machine, and situations that start as prosaically as an argument over Internet access time and the desire to forge a cool identity for oneself soon acquire such irregular aspects as visits from interplanetary basketball gods and assaults by far-future Terminators.

Thus, XANADU, a swirling maelstrom of bad ideas that somehow sucked Gene Kelly, Olivia Newton John, The Electric Light Orchestra, The Tubes, and animator Don Bluth into its destructive vortex. (Oh, and Michael Beck is the lead, which, yeah, exactly.) Temple of Bad officiates Andrea Lipinsky, Kevin Lauderdale and Dan Persons shed their vestments and put on their widest lapels to celebrate this landmark of singing, skating, and really glowy people.\n\nAll together now: XANADUUUU!

While the 3D, stop-motion animated tale, in glorious black and white, centers on a young Victor Frankenstein (here a (relatively) normal suburban kid rather than a deluded doctor) jolting his beloved dog Sparky back to life after a tragic car accident, with serious repercussions when his classmates get in on the revivification business themselves, for director Tim Burton, it's also an opportunity to dip into his past, adapting the story from an early, live-action short, and bringing in many key players from earlier Burton films to contribute as voice performers. Whether the expansion to feature length and the addition of 3D goggles justifies the nostalgia trip is something that Cinefantastique Online's Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French, and Dan Persons discuss at length in this week's review (as well as pledging their eternal devotion to that most hallowed of cinema traditions, the monster rampage).\n\nThen, Larry talks about a new, stop-motion exhibit at the Disney Museum, Steve surveys what's new in L.A.'s Halloween haunts this year, and Dan runs down what's coming to theaters next week.\n\nDirect download: csl_3-40_Frankenweenie_v02.mp3\n\nCategory:Cinefantastique -- posted at: 4:36pm EDT\n\nThis is an episode of Temple of Bad that includes several firsts. It's our first discussion of a black-and-white film. It's our first discussion of a film that has such a ridiculously short running time. It's our first film starring John Carradine, and our first film starring the oh-so-dreamy John Agar. Sadly, it's also our first episode without our fearless leader Dan Persons. So this time around, Invisible Invaders is discussed by Andrea Lipinski [link name tohttp://www.beabetterbooktalker.com], Kevin Lauderdale [link name to http://kevinlauderdale.livejournal.com/], and pop culture fiend / bad movie aficionado Orenthal Hawkins [link name tohttp://www.multimediumrare.com]. Will this fearless trio be able to wrangle some sense out of this sci-fi classic? Will they be swayed by their love of Geiger counters and theremins, or will they decide that this film is just a waste of time? Will they come up with a record number of rules for the Temple of Bad's drinking game? What do YOU think?\n\nDirect download: Invisible_Invaders.mp3\n\nCategory:Bad Movies -- posted at: 12:24am EDT\n\nCould there be a movie so inanely scripted, so ineptly produced, so all-around awful that it confounds even the staunch acolytes of the Temple of Bad? Uh, yes. Yes there is, and it's the topic of our latest episode.\n\nAN AMERICAN CAROL was intended to serve as a counterbalance to the perceived liberal tilt of mainstream cinema, to provide the arguments that would swing the 2008 presidential election to the Republican side, and to do it all with the crowd-pleasing satirical sting of AIRPLANE and the NAKED GUN franchise. That it fails on all points is a singular example of a golden opportunity thoroughly botched, and ToB stalwarts Andrea Lipinsky, Kevin Lauderdale, and Dan Persons take it upon themselves to explore how far director David Zucker and stars Kelsey Grammer, Jon Voight, and Kevin P. Farley (among a dazzling roster of guest cameos, all of whom will be leaving this project off their resumes) can stray from their intentions.\n\nSPECIAL BONUS DRINKING GAME: Every time Dan says something is fascinating.

Famed cartoonist John Kricfalusi -- aka John K -- has started up a Kickstarter campaign for his new project, CANS WITHOUT LABELS, featuring that fireplug dynamo of really bad ideas, George Liquor (characteristic quote: \"It's discipline that begets love!\"). John wanted to talk about it and I was up for finding out what he was up to, thus this special episode of MIGHTY MOVIE PODCAST.\n\nJohn was one of the guys responsible for the rebirth of truly anarchic, funny cartoons with REN AND STIMPY. His mix of gorgeous and grotesque set the stage for everything from SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS to ADVENTURE TIME, and one look at the pitch art for CANS makes me eager to see ol' George back in action and imposing his manly will on us luckless mortals.\n\nClick on the player to hear John and I discuss the upcoming cartoon, John's campaign to get animation back to its chaotic roots, the strange genealogy of cartoon nephews, and the dying tradition of animated spokespeople.\n\nDirect download: MMP617_John_K_on_Cans_Without_Labels_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:general -- posted at: 11:48am EDT\n\nNUIT #1 begins with its main characters, Clara (Catherine de Léan) and Nikolai (Dimitri Storoge), engaged in a superficial but strenuous bout of sex, having just met each other at a rave and retreated to Nikolai's sparsely appointed apartment. But, using the sheer shallowness of that physical coupling as a springboard, director Anne Émond delves deeper, as Clara and Nikolai begin to unburden themselves in a post-coitus confrontation that exposes their hopes, disappointments, fears, and desires. Abandoning the by-now common widescreen format for a 35mm frame to enhance the intimacy of the drama, Émond stages an exchange between two souls that's spare and intimate, yet sears as hot as the most reckless of one-night stands. It's incisive, passionate drama that, frankly, blew me away.\n\nDirect download: MMP616_Anne_Emond_on_Nuit_No_1_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Drama -- posted at: 12:24pm EDT\n\nMore than just a simple transcript of a museum show, the documentary MARINA ABRAMOVIĆ: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT is its own, emotionally-charged experience. Keyed off the controversial performance artist's 2010 retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the film is one part eye-opening exploration of the woman who tends to push the boundaries of physical endurance in her pieces, and one part startling observation of the main piece of her MoMA exhibit: A bare gallery with two chairs, offering the visitors the opportunity to sit across from the silent, expressionless artist for a few seconds as she looks back. So easy to sum up, and so simple in execution. But as director Matthew Aker's cameras document, also so physically taxing for Abramović and, startlingly, so profound an experience for those who sit opposite her. It's the rare case where a film starts as an observation the creation of art and eventually becomes a profound tale of people transformed by the work.\n\nClick on the player to hear my interview with Akers.\n\nDirect download: MMP615_Matthew_Akers_on_MARINA_ABRAMOVIC_THE_ARTIST_IS_PRESENT_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Documentary -- posted at: 8:35am EDT\n\nYou could say that a documentary with the title OC87: THE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE MAJOR DEPRESSION BIPOLAR ASPERGER'S MOVIE is maybe biting off more than it could chew, but no more so than the filmmaker who found himself coping, not voluntarily, with all those afflictions. More than just a sympathetic observer, Bud Clayman -- who co-directed this film with Glenn Holsten and Scott Johnston -- had a career in film derailed all those mental illnesses and, after years in therapy, has now picked up the camera again to create a film that's at once a personal document, an attempt to convey the experience of these diseases from an insider's viewpoint, and an outreach to those who also suffer, to convince them to understand their situation and seek help. Oh, and there's also a tribute to LOST IN SPACE that turns out to be surprisingly relevant.

I've long wanted to do a show with Ben Model, silent film accompanist extraordinaire, and since Samsung's latest episode of their comedy series FACT CHECKERS UNIT is essentially an extended chase sequence between the intrepid scandal-rag detectives and a shape-shifting James Franco (creeeeeepy!), it seemed like a good excuse to talk with the man who has scored so many chases they're probably a core component of his thought processes by now.\n\nInstitutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, Kino Video, and the Library of Congress count on Ben's compositional skills and tinkling ivories to bring that final, crucial bit of life to the works of D.W. Griffith, Buster Keaton, Mack Sennett, and on and on, so he's managed to develop some unique insights into the art and craft of having people, animals, and vehicles in furious pursuit (not plants, though, unless you want to count DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS).

Well, when KFC strives to become the leading face in the battle against breast cancer, then, yeah, maybe. In the new documentary, PINK RIBBONS, INC, producer Ravida Din and director Léa Pool look at how the activism surrounding a pressing women's issue was co-opted by corporations and diverted into high-profile, soft-focused fund raising activities -- walks, runs, and rallies with possibly little pertinence to the disease being battled.\n\nThe blatantly political attempted defunding of Planned Parenthood by the Susan G. Komen Foundation for the Cure raised public awareness of the ways that breast cancer charities may have gone astray; PINK RIBBONS is the next logical step, showing that that ill-advised event was only the tip of the iceberg. In talking with doctors, activists, fundraisers, and women living with breast cancer, the film raises troubling and controversial questions, but questions that strike to the heart of the modern definition of charity.\n\nClick on the player to hear my interview with Ravida Din.\n\nDirect download: MMP612_Ravida_Din_on_Pink_Ribbons_Inc_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:Documentary -- posted at: 1:52pm EDT\n\nA comedy about dire consequences, WHERE DO WE GO NOW? takes a look at the ease with which humanity slips into war, and the sometimes insurmountable difficulties that arise as people struggle to avoid it. Setting the film in a small Lebanese village where Christian and Muslim live side-by-side, director/writer/actress Nadine Labaki tells the tale of women -- wives and mothers who have seen too many husbands and sons claimed in pointless battles -- attempting to stave off another religious conflict through methods ranging from dissuading the men folk with direct entreaties to distracting them with a bus full of Ukrainian strippers (U.N, take note: works better than a planeload of old white guys).\n\nAs with her previous film, CARAMEL, Labaki manages to mix an empathetic understanding of human tragedy with warm, wry humor. For so gentle an outlook, the film has a powerhouse impact, which made it a genuine pleasure to talk with Labaki for this episode.\n\nDirect download: MMP611_Nadine_Labaki_on_WHERE_DO_WE_GO_NOW_v01.mp3\n\nCategory:general -- posted at: 10:44am EDT"
