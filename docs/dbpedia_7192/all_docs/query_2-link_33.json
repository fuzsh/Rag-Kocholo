        "text": "Beyond Amazing: Learning from 60 Years of Spider-Man\n\nExploring comics art and pop-culture history through the lens of Marvel’s iconic superhero, Professor of English Ben Saunders curates a 2022 exhibition at San Diego's Comic-Con Museum\n\nStory By Jason stone | Original Art and graphics by marvel\n\nIt’s truly amazing! Marvel’s Spider-Man turns 60 this year.\n\nThe wall-crawling crime-fighter was introduced to the world in August 1962, debuting in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15. Created by the collaborative team of writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Spider-Man was an instant sensation with readers. Marvel quickly made him the star of his own title, establishing a classic character of the Silver Age of Comic Books. Featured for decades in films, television, toys, video games, apparel, and innumerable other media, the iconic web-slinger’s latest stop is a major museum exhibition.\n\nSpider-Man: Beyond Amazing – the Exhibition opened July 1 at San Diego’s new Comic-Con Museum.\n\nAccording to Ben Saunders, director of the University of Oregon’s comics and cartoon studies program, gallery walls are a fitting stage not only owing to the character’s status in popular culture—but also the genius of Spider-Man’s creators.\n\n“Some of the finest commercial artists in history have worked at Marvel, from the 1950s right up to the present day. And the real-world narrative of Marvel is every bit as fascinating as the fictional, superhero worlds they’ve created.”\n\nThe series editor for Penguin Classics’ historic new series of Marvel anthologies, Saunders also served as co-curator of the new exhibit, which features original art drawn for comics of all eras, plus thousands of unique artifacts spanning every facet of the hero’s lifetime in media.\n\n“When you get to see the original artwork, the traditional distinctions between fine art and commercial art break down,” he says.\n\nA lifelong reader of comics who is also a professor of English and an expert on the works of Shakespeare, Saunders brought to the exhibit project not only his literary and historical insights, but also significant elbow grease. He estimates scanning more than 300 images from his personal comic book collection to use in the show. For the many original works on display, however, he acknowledges the exhibitors' reliance on generous collectors who agreed to loan them the materials. Marvel Comics de-acquisitioned their archives of production art during the 1980s, Saunders explains—most of those pieces ended up in private hands, making comprehensive exhibitions like this one a special challenge to organize.\n\nTimeless Themes; Enduring Popularity\n\nAn exhibit that Saunders and Reed previously worked on together, Marvel: Universe of Superheroes debuted at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture in 2018 and met with sufficient acclaim to subsequently tour the country. The organizers anticipate that tens of thousands may also attend their new, one-character show. What can account for Spider-Man’s out-of-the gate success and enduring appeal? According to these experts, it must come down to a variety of factors—but the most important may be Spider-Man’s underlying psychology, and his impressive list of enemies.\n\n“Hardcore comic book nerds like to argue about which title produced the best rogues gallery,” Saunders confesses. “To me, it really comes down to either Batman or Spider-Man.”\n\nFrom Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin to Kingpin and Kraven the Hunter, early issues of The Amazing Spider-Man introduced more than a dozen supervillains who proved to be nearly as popular as the hero himself. They’d continue to bedevil Spidey and frequently reappear in other Marvel titles over the decades.\n\n“There’s no other brief, intense burst of creativity in comics that’s equivalent,” Reed says. “It’s like the Beach Boys, Beatles, or Rolling Stones in popular music, in that same time period—artists who were cranking out two or three albums per year and not just sustaining high quality but growing by leaps and bounds with every new release.”\n\nAs for Spider-Man’s unique inner life—most of that was explored through his secret identity. Peter Parker, a somewhat introverted Queens high-schooler being raised by his elderly aunt and uncle, obtained his powers from the painful bite of a radioactive spider. Unlike earlier superhero youths who’d always been relegated to the sidekick’s role by comics writers, Parker had no superpowered adults around to guide him. All on his own, he had to learn to control his strange new powers and apply them “with great responsibility.”\n\nThe Heroic Look of Success\n\nTo help him envision this new kind of hero, Lee reached out to Marvel’s most idiosyncratic artist. Unlike the bulk of his peers, Steve Ditko had little interest in anatomical accuracy or drawing with “realism.” He was a master of gesture and character design, however, and his unique style brought a kinetic flair to the pages. Perhaps most impactfully, Ditko invented Spider-Man’s iconic threads.\n\n“There’s something intrinsically appealing about the Spider-Man costume,” Reed enthuses. “Kids immediately react to it, even before they’re old enough really to understand the character. Spider-Man just looks cool.”\n\nIn a comics era when the great majority of characters were still white—and most wore masks that partially revealed their faces—Lee also credited the head-to-toe style of Spider-Man’s suit with helping readers, irrespective of their race, to connect with the character by picturing themselves inside his costume. It’s probably no coincidence that Spider-Man is a perennially popular subject for Halloween masks and children’s pajamas. And the universal nature of the character’s appearance has doubtlessly contributed to his appeal across cultures and generations.\n\nIn recent years, with the Marvel universe growing in print and exploding across various media, this inclusive aura has expanded to also include depictions of the character behind the mask.\n\n“As curators, we always strive to be aware of and include all the various perspectives,” he says. “There are many ways to recognize the resonances of the core creation. Our hope is that people will leave the exhibit with a greater awareness not just of the work itself, but its cultural impact.”\n\nIn the words of his creator, the great Stan Lee: \"Excelsior\" to Spider-Man! A sexagenarian hero to millions, Spidey continues to spin vast webs of influence.\n\nJason Stone is a staff writer with University Communications. All Spider-Man graphics and artwork © 2022 Marvel."
