        "text": "Buttered Up 2010\n\nHistory Channel\n\nAmerican Restoration featured several train-related pieces they restored over the course of its 6 “Rick’s Restorations” seasons. A couple episodes even featured trips to the Nevada Northern Railway at East Ely — sadly none of which were available on DVD when I reviewed.\n\nFortunately, Season One, Episode 4 “Buttered Up” on DVD from 2010 tells the story of turning a junked backyard toy train into a beautifully-renovated masterpiece. [The show takes its name from a movie theatre popcorn machine simultaneously being restored.]\n\nRick Dale (seen above) spots the locomotive in a pile of junk and buys it (along with two gas nozzles) for $100 bucks from Eric the Picker. Can Rick and the boys turn this rusty, railroad-related relic into a regal ride?\n\nLooks like they did. Here’s a sneak peak at the finished product. Read on for all the juicy details…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Tattered Dress 1957\n\nUniversal-International\n\nLet’s take a ride on the Southern Pacific. Many thanks to reader Tony Roberts for sending me an extra Blu-Ray disc of this movie to watch. Today’s feature is a late 1950’s film noir courtroom drama with about six minutes of railroad footage at the beginning. Apologies for the poor quality of the screen caps in this review. I plead extenuating circumstances.\n\nThe Espee was quite cooperative, renting a set of passenger train equipment, a pair of diesel locomotives and two, separate passenger stations for filmmakers to use. Not to mention “track and time”. ;p It looks like most on-board footage was on actual passenger cars with rear screen projection out the windows.\n\nActress Elaine Stewart, (seen above playing trophy wife Charleen Reston), provides the cheesecake in her “tattered dress” and although she doesn’t appear in any train scenes, she’s bound to show up somewhere in this review. What a Lark!\n\nHotshot New York lawyer Jim Blane (played by Jeff Chandler) has arrived in town to get a local crook off the murder charge. The townsfolk are not pleased. Note the Southern Pacific sleeping car in the background.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nDeath is a Double Cross 1971\n\nA Quinn Martin Production\n\nColumbia Broadcasting System\n\nRecommended by Lance (thanks for the link!), comes this TV episode of “Cannon”, broadcast on Pearl Harbor Day in 1971. The first half of this 60 minute “Quinn Martin Production” takes place on, or around, a Santa Fe Railway Super Chief-type consist, Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal (LAUPT), and studio sets for the onboard train scenes.\n\nAt the time of filming, Amtrak was just starting to take over passenger operations (on May 1, 1971) from the private railroads.\n\nWho is Cannon? He was a robust, rotund, private detective played by William Conrad. He drives around in a big old, metallic blue 1971 Lincoln Mark III two-door with a car phone and red interior.\n\nIs there any cheesecake in this feature? Of course! Not only that, there’s a couple Star Trek connections as well. BUT you’ll have to wait until the end of my review. All aboard!\n\nA Santa Fe Conductor checks his watch in the time-honored tradition beside ATSF “Pleasure Dome” #503. Note the Amtrak “Pointless Arrow” to his left – a harbinger of things to come for American train travelers (shudder…).\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBerth Marks 1929\n\nMetro Goldwyn Mayer\n\nThe famous vaudeville comedy act, Laurel & Hardy starred in this early talkie short (19 minutes). Early scenes are filmed at Santa Fe Railway’s La Grande Station in Los Angeles.\n\nStan Laurel and Oliver Hardy play, well, themselves with a series of sight gags at the depot and onboard a heavyweight passenger train (partially filmed in the studio). They have tickets for a Pullman “section” set up for night time use (even though it’s broad daylight for the entire trip to “Pottsville”).\n\nMotive power for the train is ATSF #1373, a 1337 class, Baldwin-built (1913), 4-6-2 Pacific. Santa Fe #1373 even has its own locomotive.fandom.com web page!\n\nWill the boys make it to their destination in one piece? Let’s take a peek and see.\n\nThe majority of the plot consists of the duo attempting to get into their upper berth, well-illustrated in this movie poster; Not seen in the movie, but in this publicity shot is Stan & Oliver between a pair of outside-braced box cars. The car behind them is lettered “P.E.” for Pacific Electric, a subsidiary of Southern Pacific Railroad.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Gambler 1980\n\nTime-Life\n\nColumbia Broadcasting System\n\nToday’s feature is a tale of two steam locomotives — mostly filmed at the Old Tucson Studios whose star attraction was ex-Virginia & Truckee #11, “Reno”. According to Larry Jensen’s “Hollywood’s Railroads, Volume One”, ex-Dardanelle & Russellville #8, also appeared in this made-for-TV movie and therein lies my quandary.\n\nI can’t tell the engines apart. Both are 4-4-0’s. Both burn oil. V&T #11 was built by Baldwin in 1872. D&R #8 was built by Alco (Cooke) in 1888. From all the screen caps and pictures I’ve seen, these two could be twins.\n\nSO. For identification purposes throughout my review, I will refer to the locomotive as it is painted — Southern Pacific Railroad #8.\n\nUpdate: Many Thanks to blog reader Caldwell Butler, who has identified the locomotive below as D&R #8.\n\nThe entire 94 minute movie takes place in or around a train, so let’s explore Kenny Rogers’ journey “On a train bound to nowhere” (or in this case, to Yuma). At the bottom of this review, is a 3 1/2 minute video of “The Gambler” song on which this movie is based.\n\nSP #8 is at full gallop with its passenger train on a nice, flat stretch of track. How about that MOD S.P.R.R. lettering on the tender? Is that a funky font or what?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Seven Year Itch 1955\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nMost famously known as the movie that lifted Marilyn Monroe’s skirt, Seven Year Itch (or “Itch” as I call it), features COLOR footage of the old, original Pennsylvania Station in New York City. Itch is also a train movie without any physical trains seen — unless you want to count the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line seen briefly in a later scene.\n\nWhat little we see of this palatial Beaux-Arts terminal is gorgeous though. This was the Pennsylvania Railroad’s masterpiece. It inspired me to purchase and research Paul Kaplan’s book “New York’s Original Penn Station — The Rise and Tragic Fall of an American Landmark”.\n\nOf course, you can’t review this movie without a FEW screen caps of “Norma Jean” gassing it up with co-star Richard Sherman (played by Tom Ewell).\n\nI’m not positive, but this MIGHT be the area of the station where Itch was filmed. The stairways and clock and overhead arches appear to line up. Photo credit: www.history101.nyc\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun 1950\n\nMetro Goldwyn Mayer\n\nPull! It’s a Technicolor musical extravaganza, featuring Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show — which happily for us, traveled by train back in the day. Annie Oakley (played by Betty Hutton) and Frank Butler (played by Howard Keel) star as a pair of sharpshooters which is based on a true story.\n\nAccording to Larry Jensen’s “Hollywood’s Railroads, Volume One”, MGM used their ex-Virginia & Truckee 4-4-0 #11 (The Reno) for studio train scenes. Unfortunately, the editors saw fit to only give a glimpse (see above) of Reno’s TENDER with “Transcontinental & Western” script lettering – concentrating instead on a string of bright yellow coaches.\n\nOther train scenes utilized a model train for the credits (see top) and lifted footage of Sierra Railroad #18 directly out of Dodge City 1939 (see bottom).\n\nA well-lit broadside of ATSF #18 (Sierra #18) 2-8-0 Baldwin 1906 pedaling furiously along. Close ups of this engine were used as bridging shots in Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nTrain Chasers 2023\n\nMountain Dew\n\nDo The Dew! OK, this review is just a quickie. A 30 second commercial, to be exact. I first saw this ad online while waiting for my YouTube Virtual Railfan camera to fire up (My favorite cams are Skykomish, LaPlata, Fort Madison, Flagstaff and Arvada).\n\nI believe this commercial was heavily “touched up” (as we used to call it) with whatever modern manipulative software they use nowadays.\n\nFrom a railroad standpoint, the first thing I see are two, orange diesel locomotives leading a freight train. It is a single track line with a dirt road running alongside. They’re in a desert setting with small, hopefully-extinct, volcanic peaks in the background. The orange engines are POSSIBLY BNSF Railway GE units of some kind, or maybe even Genesee and Wyoming short line power.\n\nIn other words, this could have been filmed almost anywhere.\n\nThree cars behind the diesels is the neon green Mountain Dew box car — the main “protagonist” of our feature. Very eye-catching. Unfortunately, there’s a startling lack of information about today’s short on the Internet — at least what I can find. So let’s dig a little deeper…\n\nJust for fun, here’s a K-Line O-scale DIET Mountain Dew box car and a Lionel Mountain Dew tank car.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nProject Phoenix 1972\n\nUniversal Studios\n\nBanacek! George Peppard stars in this NBC Wednesday Night Mystery Movie. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” fans will remember him as the courtesan to Patricia Neal and companion of Audrey Hepburn.\n\nThis train-laced movie (both prototype and model) features 4 character actors from Star Trek TOS and Batman 1966 and includes overhead (helicopter) scenes of railroads in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nBanacek is brought in when an expensive, experimental sports car vanishes from a non-stop freight train. The solution to the mystery is so preposterous, you just HAVE to come along for the ride (no pun intended). Let’s roll…\n\nWould you believe an Atlas O scale (two rail) Great Northern, Big Sky Blue box car is a key exhibit in explaining how they done it? Read on…\n\n42 years later, this is what Big Sky Blue fades to, in Sandpoint, Idaho.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLast Clear Chance 1959\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad\n\nThis railroad safety film has the dubious honor of being mocked by Mystery Science Theater 3000 in one of their episodes, “Radar Secret Service”. A YouTube link to the MST3K version is provided below.\n\nBasically the message is, don’t try to beat the train to the crossing – sound advice – but there’s a whole plethora of neat, old ’59 Fords and Chevys being driven, rather ineptly, by my fellow Idahoans, sometimes with disastrous results. (Thanks for the car ID’s, Mark!)\n\nBeside the blurred streamliner images, trackside views include EMD F units, GP9s, switchers and even an Alco-GE gas turbine-electric locomotive.\n\nWill the Idaho State Police get the word about railroad safety through people’s thick skulls? Let’s find out.\n\nUP owned a fleet of EMD E8’s and E9’s seen here flashing past the camera in southern Idaho. Passenger trains of the era included #105/#106 City of Portland, #17/#18 Portland Rose and Mail and Express #11/#12. Portland Rose was the only train that traversed the Boise area in daylight.\n\nContinue reading →"
