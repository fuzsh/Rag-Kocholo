        "text": "Two mismatched partners — maybe one's a cop and the other's a Fed, or a cop and a crook, or a by-the-book detective and the precinct's resident loose cannon— have to work together to solve a crime. Two friends see their close bond tested by misadventures, misunderstandings and one-crazy-night obstacles. Two folks embark on a road trip — maybe they're running from the Mob, or maybe they're just in search of White Castle burgers — and encounter wacky and/or dangerous characters along the way. The specific details differ (and mileage may vary) for each story, but you could tack on the same three-word-phrase to the end of each description: \"with hilarious results.\"\n\nReality Bites: The 25 Best and Worst Biopics\n\nThey call 'em buddy comedies, and with the Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill double act 22 Jump Street hitting theaters, we've taken the opportunity to rank the 25 best buddy-comedy movies. There were a few ground rules: The films had to qualify as comedies, which meant a few great buddy-cop movies didn't make the cut (no, Mel Gibson's Moe-from-the-Three-Stooges mugging does not make Lethal Weapon a comedy); and we narrowed the field down to movies focused primarily on a pair of buddies (very sorry, The 40-Year-Old Virgin). So grab a friend — or someone who you can't stand but, by the time you get to the end of this list, will have forged a begrudging mutual respect for — and see what made the cut."
