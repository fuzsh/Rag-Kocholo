        "text": "Movies are about things — even bad movies are about things. Even “Surf Nazis Must Die” is about something. It has a theme, even if it doesn’t want to have a theme…. You have to know in some way what you are about to do (as a scriptwriter and director). Even if that theme gets rerouted or ends up in subtext, somehow the theme has to be some sense of why you are doing this (making a movie). — Paul Schrader, Screenwriter\n\nWhen we look at novels, plays and poetry, theme means an idea often called the “central idea,” “the point,” “the message”, or “the statement of the work as a whole.”\n\nHowever, for film analysis, this definition of theme is too narrow. The theme of a movie might not be an idea at all. A film’s central concern may be to create an emotional effect on an audience such as suspense (“Silence of the Lambs”) or establish a specific mood such as comedy (“Bridesmaids”).\n\nThus the literary concept of theme must be expanded so it can be used to examine films ranging from “Star Wars” to “Memento,” from “Scream” to “Schindler’s List.”\n\nIn film analysis, we will use the word theme to mean the central concern around which a movie is constructed; the focus that gives a film unity. The focus may be on an idea, but it is just as likely to be on plot, emotional effect or mood, character, or style and texture. All five elements are present in ALL films, but one usually dominates the other four and becomes the primary element or theme (concern) of a movie.\n\nFOCUS ON PLOT:\n\nIn adventure stories, the primary emphasis is on events — on what happens. Since the aim of films like “The Adventures of Robin Hood,” “Mission Impossible,” or “Green Lantern” is to give a few hours of escape from the real life, the action is exciting and fast paced.\n\nCharacters, ideas and emotional effects are far less important to the plot and the final outcome, which usually shows the hero battling against tremendous obstacles to defeat the villain and win the heroine before “The End” flashes on the screen.\n\nNo matter how the events and the ending unfold, they are only important in the context of the specific story being told; little real significance can be attached to the events or characters in plot-based movie. The theme of such a film can best be captured in a concise summary of the central action.\n\nThose films with themes that can easily be communicated in a 30 second television commercial or a splashy poster (“Jaws,” “40 Year Old Virgin” “Godzilla”) are movies that usually focus on plot rather than ideas, characters or emotions.\n\nFor example, it is easy to capture the central focus of “Super 8” in a TV commercial: Good kids against bad alien from outer space in small rural American town with the heroes in constant peril. But think how difficult it would be to write a 30 second TV ad about complex movies like “Memento,” “Schindler’s List,” “Run Lola Run” or “Temple Grandin.”\n\nFOCUS ON EMOTIONAL EFFECT OR MOOD:\n\nA very specific mood or emotion serves as the focus for many movies. In such films, it is possible to identify a single mood or emotion that exists throughout the movie or to view each segment of the film as a step leading to a single powerful emotional effect such as the climactic triumph of Robert Redford in “The Natural” as his character wins the championship baseball game with a bases loaded home run.\n\nAlthough plot may be very important in such films, events are not as significant as the emotional response they produce. Most horror films like “Saw,” thrillers like “Psycho,” and erotic suspense tales like “Double Indemnity” can be interpreted as trying to create a mood or emotional effect as their primary focus and unifying element. Themes of such films can best be stated by identifying the mood or emotional effect you experience while watching.\n\nIn some films, a balanced combination of two emotions may make it difficult to tell which emotion dominates. Comedy-thrillers such as “Beverly Hills Cop,” “Iron Man I” or “Ghostbusters” might be classified as either comedies or thrillers while “Freddy vs. Jason” can be described as either a horror or comedy film depending on your reaction.\n\nFOCUS ON CHARACTER:\n\nSome films, through both action and dialogue, focus attention on a single character. Although plot is important, what happens in the story is only significant because it clarifies the character being developed. The major appeal of such characters lies in the qualities that set them apart from ordinary people.\n\nGood examples of character based movies might include: “Taxi Driver,” “Tootsie,” “Jerry Maguire, “Temple Grandin,” “Edward Scissorhands,” “Millions,” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” The theme of such films can best be summarized in a description of the central character, with emphasis on the unusual aspects of the individual’s personality.\n\nFOCUS ON STYLE OR TEXTURE:\n\nIn a relatively small number of feature films, the director tells the story in such a different visual way that the visual style or texture becomes its most memorable and powerful element, making a stronger impact than any of the other thematic elements.\n\nSuch films have a quality that sets them apart — a unique look, rhythm, atmosphere, color, sound or editing style that overwhelms the plot, characters or emotions.\n\nThese kinds of movies are usually not box office hits. They aren’t the kind of film most movie audiences expect. Instead of an easy to follow plot, attractive characters or larger-than-life emotional experiences, stylistic films are a form of personal expression for the director who has less interest in creating a commercial project than in reflecting an inner vision and perspective on life and filmmaking techniques. Examples include “Bad Lieutenant,” “Persona,” “8 1/2,” “Blue Velvet,” “Run Lola Run,” and “Memento.”\n\nFOCUS ON IDEAS:\n\nIn most serious films, the action and characters are important because of the film’s content. They help explain or clarify some aspect of life experience or the human condition. The ideas can be communicated directly through a specific incident or stated in a character’s dialogue.\n\nMost often, however, the concept is presented more subtly and you are challenged to find a meaning that best fits the film. This indirect approach increases the possibility of many different interpretations depending on your past experiences, prejudices, moral values, age, sex, social class, cultural background and other factors.\n\nAlthough all of you will see the same films in this class, each of you will see different movie in your minds as your individual personality shapes and changes the common experience into a private one. All of these interpretations of the same film are not contradictory, nor is one right and the others wrong. In fact, all of them are right and complimentary to each other.\n\nThe sum of the different points-of-view add up to a collective definition of the movie’s basic concept or idea. The more diverse the reactions to the film, the more successful it is as a work of art that challenges us to use our own personal experiences and perspective to interpret what the movie is trying to communicate.\n\nWhile it is impossible to reach total agreement as to the basic idea or concept of a film, you can still try to accurately identify the abstract subject in a single word or phrase — for example, jealousy, injustice, prejudice.\n\nIf this is as specific as you can get in figuring out the theme, you shouldn’t be concerned. Some concepts can be stated clearly, others cannot. At any rate, if you can identify the true subject of the film you have made an important step in film analysis.\n\nIf possible, you should try to go beyond merely identifying the thematic subject and see if you can come with a statement that accurately summarizes the subject of the film and is conveyed by all its elements. If such a specific statement of the film’s central concern is possible, the movie’s theme might fall into one of the following categories of ideas.\n\n1. MORAL STATEMENTS:\n\nFilms that make moral statements are trying to convince us of the wisdom of a moral principle and persuade us to apply that principle in our own lives. Such principles often take the form of proverbs like “The love of money is the root of all evil” or “Crime does not pay.”\n\nAlthough many modern films have moral implications, very few are built around a single moral statement and you must be careful not to mistake a moral implication for a statement of morality.\n\nFor example, action films end with the villain defeated by the hero. This is an implication of morality, not a statement. The primary focus of such films is not to persuade us that “evil is wrong” but to give us a cinematic roller coaster for ride a few moments of vicarious thrills.\n\nHowever, in a movie like “Midnight Express,” the message that smuggling drugs can lead to a long prison sentence with life threatening consequences is clearly the central moral theme. Its doubtful that anyone who has seen the movie would ever consider smuggling drugs out of Turkey no matter how profitable such a venture might be.\n\n2. THE TRUTH OF HUMAN NATURE:\n\nQuite different from films that focus on unique characters are those that present universal or representative characters. Such films move beyond character study into the realm of “ideas as theme” for such characters take on significance beyond themselves and the context of the film in which they appear.\n\nThese characters represent humanity in a general way; they serve as cinematic vehicles to illustrate some widely or universally acceptable truth about human nature.\n\nHuman nature themes are most obvious in movies where there isn’t one central star, instead the script presents a number of characters interacting with each other in “ensemble” performances such as in “The Big Chill,” “Star Trek,” “The Breakfast Club,” “Lord of the Flies,” “Lord of the Rings,” and “Harry Potter.”\n\n3. SOCIAL PROBLEMS:\n\nSince the first Hollywood feature length film, “Birth of a Nation” (1914), many filmmakers have been concerned about social problems. Their cinematic projects expose social vices and follies or criticize social conditions.\n\nAlthough the underlying purpose of such films is social reform, they rarely spell out a solution to the problems posed in the film. Instead, they concentrate on defining the problem and emphasizing its importance.\n\nA social problem film may treat its subject in a light, satirical or comic manner (“Dr. Strangelove” or “Network”) or it may attack the subject in a savage, harsh and brutal style (“Midnight Cowboy” or “The Hurt Locker.”).\n\nThe social problem film, unlike the human-nature movie, concerns itself with the special functions of human beings as social animals and the social institutions and traditions they have created.\n\nSocial problem films are the most time-bound of movie themes. They are living historical records of contemporary social, political, cultural, and economic issues that were of great public concern when the film was produced.\n\nBy noting the copyright date of a film, it’s possible to gain valuable insight into the social forces that shaped and defined its specific approach to the issue it’s presenting.\n\nFor example, the 1932 “Scarface,” dealt with public anxiety about alcohol prohibition and the resulting rise in criminal power and violence. When the remake of “Scarface” with Al Pacino was released 51 years later in 1983, cocaine had replaced booze as the illegal drug plaguing American society although the other elements of the modern version were amazingly similar to the original.\n\nIn fact, an examination of Hollywood films from the late 1950’s to the present shows that they accurately reflect America’s attitude towards drug use. During the 1950’s, the few films that focused on drugs told stories about heroin addicts living in filth and poverty who predictably died from an overdose in a garbage-filled alley to drive home the message that “drugs are a social menace.”\n\nBy the late 1960’s, however, as drug use became more commonly accepted by the nation’s youth, moviemakers changed their position from temperance to encouragement. In films like “Easy Rider,” “Return of the Secaucus Seven,” “Woodstock,” and “Annie Hall,” drug use was presented as a normal part of the screen characters’ lifestyle without any negative effects. Drug taking moved from the dingy urban slums to the tastefully decorated living rooms of suburbia as Hollywood mirrored our changing attitude towards chemical stimulants.\n\nA decade later, the American drug scene had changed from the innocent days of pot-smoking and LSD parties to the murderous business of cocaine and crack dealing that left bullet-ridden bodies and destroyed lives in its wake. Teenagers who were pro-drug became “just say no” adults and Hollywood returned to its anti-drug position with a flood of films depicting the ravages of drug dealing and addiction (“Clean and Sober,” “Sid and Nancy,” “The King of New York,” “Boyz ‘n The Hood”).\n\n4. THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN DIGNITY:\n\nMany serious films portray a basic conflict or tension between two opposing sides of human nature. One is the desire to surrender to animal instincts and drown in the muck of human weakness, cowardice, brutality, stupidity, and sensuality. The other is the struggle to stand up to the challenge, to display courage, sensitivity, intelligence, a spiritual and moral sense, and a strong belief in one’s self.\n\nThis conflict is best shown when the central characters are placed in a position of disadvantage, having been “dealt a bad hand” in some way, so they must work against tremendous odds to triumph as seen in such films as “Rocky,” “The Mighty Ducks,” “Born on the Fourth of July,” “Swing Girls,” “Temple Grandin” and “Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio.”\n\nThe conflict may be external with the character struggling against some dehumanizing force, system, institution or attitude as seen in “Schindler’s List,” “Philadelphia,” “Erin Brockovitch,” “The Matrix” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”\n\nOr the plot may center on an internal conflict with the character struggling for dignity against the human weaknesses present in his or her own personality as found in such films as “Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde,” “On the Waterfront,” “Memento,” “In the Line of Fire” and “Edward Scissorhands.”\n\n5. THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS:\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of films are, in some way, about human relationships, there are some movies where this theme is the central concern.\n\nIn movies about how human beings interact with each other, we see the problems, frustrations and pleasures of human contact: love, friendship, marriage, divorce, family structure, sexuality, etc..\n\nSome films show the gradual working out of a problem; others give insight into a problem without any solution. Although a great many of these films deal with the continuing struggle for harmony between men and women (“Kramer vs. Kramer,” “Sleepless in Seattle,” “Body Heat,” “When Harry Met Sally”, “Tootsie”), there are plenty of movies that deal with friendship and love between those of the same sex (“Midnight Cowboy,” “Fried Green Tomatoes,” “Rain Man,” “Brokeback Mountain” “Double Indemnity”).\n\n6. COMING OF AGE/LOSS OF INNOCENCE/GROWING AWARENESS:\n\nThe major character or characters in such films are usually (but not always) young people going through experiences that force them to become more mature or to gain some new awareness of themselves in relation to the world around them. Such concepts can be treated comically (“American Graffiti,” “Millions,” “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,”) seriously (“The Graduate,” “Water for Elephants”), or tragically (“The River’s Edge,” “Scarface”).\n\nThe central character in these films is always different in some way at the end of the film from what he or she was at the beginning. The changes that happen may be subtle shifts of attitude or drastic alterations that are reflected by differences in the character’s behavior or lifestyle.\n\n7. A MORAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL RIDDLE:\n\nSometimes a film may attempt to create a variety of subjective interpretations by developing a story around a riddle or puzzling quality, to suggest or mystify instead of communicating clearly, and attempting to pose question rather than give answers.\n\nThe typical reaction to such films as “2001–A Space Odyssey,” “Persona,” “Days of Heaven,” and “Run Lola Run” is: “What’s it all about?” Since this type of film communicates through symbols and or images, an analysis of these elements is needed for interpretation, and even then, there will be major differences of opinion.\n\nSince these films do not present a typical Hollywood story, the subjective reactions we experience are to be expected. However, this doesn’t mean that the analysis of all the elements in the film can be ignored. The theme (whatever you conclude it is) should be the sum total of all these elements and your interpretation should be supported by a close examination of the various parts of the movie.\n\nIDENTIFYING THE THEME\n\nThe theme, or focus of a film, is the basic unifying factor of the script. Each element in the project (characterization, cinematography, editing, music, dialogue, setting, etc.) must advance the theme and must be analyzed in terms of its relationship to the theme.\n\nTherefore, as you look at the specific technical and creative elements in a film, you must ALWAYS relate them to the movie’s theme. As you think about editing, visual style, acting, music, or picture composition always begin by asking: “What is the theme of this film and how do these elements support it?”\n\nUnfortunately, figuring out the theme of a film is often difficult. It isn’t likely to come to you in a flash of insight halfway through the movie. Although watching a movie may give you a grasp of its basic meaning, accurately stating the theme is more complex.\n\nOften this can’t be done until after the movie is over and you have some time to think about it or discuss the film with others. Sometimes just describing the movie to someone who hasn’t seen it will give you a clue to the theme because we tend to describe things that made the strongest impression.\n\nIdentifying the theme can be considered both the start and end of film analysis. After seeing a movie, you should try to identify the theme as a starting point for further thought.\n\nIn your efforts to isolate the theme, remember that some films have more than one theme; they may have other, less important areas of emphasis called motifs. These are images, patterns, or ideas that are repeated throughout the film and are variations of the major theme.\n\nFor example, in Woody Allen’s “Radio Days,” his nostalgic memories of growing up in Brooklyn, New York, in the late 1930’s are tied together by repeated scenes of his family listening to radio programs which created a magical, fantasy world that sharply contrasted with the drab, ordinary stuff of daily living.\n\nEVALUATING THE THEME\n\nOnce you have figured out the theme, it is important to make some kind of evaluation of it, especially in a serious film that tries to do more than just entertain.\n\nOne standard commonly used in theme evaluation is universality. A universal theme is one that lasts, that is of interest not just to those who saw the movie when it was first released, but to all human beings in all ages.\n\nTherefore, a theme with universal appeal may be considered superior to one with an appeal limited strictly in time and place. Four social problem films illustrate this point.\n\nThere are those that are strictly limited in time and place like two films from the late 1960s: “Easy Rider” and “Billy Jack.” Both were very popular at the box office and well received by movie fans when they were released but seem silly and dated when viewed today.\n\nIn contrast, however, “Gone With the Wind” (U-S Civil War in the 1860s) and “The Grapes of Wrath” (the plight of migrant farm workers in the 1930’s) still have their original emotional power and impact. These films still satisfy because of the real and powerful characters they present, the heroic struggles fought for human dignity, and the artistry with which the films were made.\n\nIn other words, if a film made years ago still has its original effect on us, be it a comedy, tragedy, satire or action script, then it has some universal quality that conquers time and space; some mysterious element that makes it a “classic” film that remains fresh and alive no matter when the movie was made.\n\nThere are countless examples of “classics” that continue to entertain, stimulate and satisfy film audiences including: “The Adventures of Robin Hood,” “Casablanca,” “Duble Indemnity,” “Citizen Kane,” “Fantasia,” “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” “Wizard of Oz,” “The Godfather”.\n\nThis does not mean that films without universal themes have no value. Even if a theme’s appeal is limited to a specific time and place (“All the President’s Men,” “China Syndrome,” “Woodstock”) it may have some important connection to your own experience. You will naturally give a theme that says something significant to you more praise than one that does not.\n\nYou should also expect that a theme be intellectually interesting. In other words, if a movie attempts to make a significant statement, the statement should be neither boring nor self-evident but should be interesting and challenging till the final credits."
