        "text": "Opinion\n\nThe PointConversations and insights about the moment.\n\nPinned\n\nTen years ago, the Anti-Defamation League released its annual audit of antisemitic incidents in the United States. The group reported just 751 incidents targeting Jews in 2013, a 19 percent drop from the previous year.\n\n“In the last decade we have witnessed a significant and encouraging decline in the number of antisemitic acts in America,” Abraham Foxman, the A.D.L.’s director at the time, said in a news release. “The falling number of incidents targeting Jews is another indication of just how far we have come in finding full acceptance in society.”\n\nThat was then. On Tuesday, the A.D.L. released its audit for 2023. It recorded 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the United States — a 140 percent increase over 2022 and a tenfold increase over a decade ago. The numbers include 161 physical assaults, 2,177 acts of vandalism and 1,009 bomb threats against synagogues and other Jewish institutions, as compared to 91 bomb threats for 2022. Jewish cemeteries were desecrated 13 times last year, up from four times the year before.\n\nMuch of the increase came after Hamas’s massacre in Israel on Oct. 7, and the A.D.L. changed its methodology somewhat to take account of anti-Zionist expressions it deemed to be effectively antisemitic. But even without the methodology changes, the A.D.L. would still have recorded 7,523 antisemitic incidents last year.\n\nWhat do some of these incidents look like? The report offers dozens of examples.\n\nIn February 2023, a man shot two Jewish men as they were leaving a synagogue. In May, “swastikas made of feces were smeared in a residence hall bathroom at the University of California, San Diego.” In July, a group of about 20 people assaulted three Jewish teens at New York’s Rockaway Beach after noticing that one of the teens was wearing a Star of David. In October, Jemma DeCristo, a professor in American studies at the University of California, Davis, threatened “Zionist journalists”: “they have houses w addresses, kids in school,” she wrote, before signing off with knife, hatchet and blood emojis.\n\nAntisemitism can be difficult to define — a fact that has long offered antisemites an opportunity to hide their prejudice behind terminology. But as Justice Potter Stewart once said about pornography — “I know it when I see it” — so it could be said about hatred of Jews.\n\nTo see it in America today, you don’t have to look very far.\n\nApril 16, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nNew York’s politicians have finally struck a deal to address the state’s disastrous housing crisis, the most pressing issue facing the region.\n\nThe deal, announced by Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers Monday, is solicitous of real estate interests. But it may help accomplish some of what the state and its tenants need anyway.\n\nUnder the compromise, which would be included in the state budget, developers would receive generous tax incentives to build more housing. In exchange, developers would make 20 percent of the units affordable. A limit on building sizes would be raised, providing an incentive for more construction in New York City. Owners of rent-stabilized buildings could charge higher rents for making improvements. Hochul officials say the plan would lead to just under 190,000 units of new housing in the state over the next decade.\n\nTenants in New York City would win new protections against evictions, a long-sought goal. But other benefits for tenants are weak. Municipalities outside the city would have to opt in to the protections, which would prohibit owners of market-rate buildings from increasing the rent by more than 10 percent over the previous year, or 5 percentage points above the rate of inflation. There is a feast of exemptions, including properties with 10 or fewer units, and new units built wouldn’t be covered under the protections for the first 30 years. The weakness of these tenant protections, which have been fought hard by groups like the Real Estate Board of New York, is a reflection of the industry’s continued outsize sway on state politics.\n\nBut as flawed as this compromise is, walking away from it entirely would be irresponsible.\n\nFour in 10 New York State residents are spending 30 percent of their income or more on housing. More than half of New York City residents are doing the same. Evictions are up nearly 200 percent.\n\nDoing nothing isn’t an option. Instead, lawmakers and state officials can work quickly to make the deal better. Tenant protections can be strengthened. Allowing residents to rent accessory dwelling units, known as in-law apartments, would also be a win.\n\nTruly facing this crisis will require bigger fights, like confronting restrictive zoning laws in Westchester and Long Island that have made it almost impossible to build multifamily housing. It’s also past time to reform New York City’s embarrassingly regressive property tax system, in which renters get stuck with most of the bill.\n\nResidents, voters and businesses invested in New York City need to build a powerful pro-housing coalition, one that not even Albany can ignore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 15, 2024, 5:44 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Biden must be tearing his hair out over the latest New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters. Half of the respondents describe economic conditions as “poor.” Only 20 percent say they strongly approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, while 45 percent strongly approve of Donald Trump’s handling of the economy as president.\n\nThis would make sense if the economy were in recession, but the opposite is true. The Covid-19 recession happened while Trump was still in office, and the economy has snapped back powerfully since. On Monday, the Census Bureau released retail sales data for March that economists described as “solid,” “strong” and “booming.”\n\nTo be clear, what this means is that there are some likely voters whose opinions and actions don’t line up. They’re saying the economy is poor, but they’re behaving as if things are really good. How is Biden supposed to respond to this in his economic speech in Scranton, Pa., on Tuesday, without antagonizing voters by telling them they’re wrong?\n\nHere’s a chart I made based on the Times/Siena poll about the two presidents’ handling of the economy:\n\nAnd here’s one about economic conditions, which only 5 percent of likely voters rate as excellent:\n\nI asked Ludovic Subran, the chief economist of Allianz Research in Germany, for his explanation of the divergence between the economy’s performance and voters’ perceptions. He put it into an international perspective. Around the world, he said, voters have turned against people who were in office when the inflation shock hit. Biden’s predicament doesn’t look unusual from that point of view.\n\nSubran also said that inequality has increased during the recovery from the pandemic because the strong stock market has lifted the wealth of the stock-holding class. He attributed part of the stock market gains to the Biden administration’s policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which directed government aid to companies that are investing in the fight against climate change. (Partially offsetting that, wage gains have been strongest at the bottom end of the income scale.)\n\nThe good news for Biden in the Times/Siena poll is that the two candidates are nearly tied in terms of whom voters would pick if the election were held today. But if Biden can’t persuade voters that he’s better than Trump on the economy — or at least somewhere in that neighborhood — his re-election campaign will remain in peril.\n\nApril 15, 2024, 2:47 p.m. ET\n\nBeyond seeing its historical importance, those of us covering the Trump trial expected the first day to be relatively uneventful, with housekeeping details and rules of the road for jury selection. But it turned out that the morning also had the first stirrings of accountability for Donald Trump.\n\nAs part of the pretrial housekeeping, Justice Juan Merchan delivered the so-called Parker warnings on courtroom behavior directly to the defendant, reminding him that he could be jailed if he disrupted the proceedings.\n\nTrump, who earlier seemed to be dozing, muttered, “I do,” when asked if he understood this and the other elements of the warning, which Merchan was delivering to Trump for a second time — now orally — just to make sure it sank in.\n\nThen the former president had to sit and listen to a discussion of the admissibility of his years of witness intimidation, his arguably illegal social media posts and his efforts to use The National Enquirer to destroy his rivals. The jury didn’t hear any of this, but Trump and everyone else in the courtroom did.\n\nAll morning, Trump’s side only won once: when Merchan ruled that during the testimony of Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, there could be no mention in front of the jury of Trump’s wife being pregnant and then being with a newborn (Barron Trump) at home when McDougal says they were having a long-running affair.\n\nAt one point, Todd Blanche, Trump’s lead attorney, saw that his slumped client was looking straight ahead, dejected. He reached out and patted Trump on the back.\n\nMerchan said he would hold a hearing on April 23 on the prosecution’s motion that Trump be held in contempt of court and possibly jailed for three Truth Social posts attacking Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, which seemed to be a clear violation of Merchan’s gag order preventing Trump from trying to intimidate witnesses.\n\nMerchan indicated that he would reject Trump’s go-to argument that he was just responding in kind.\n\nIn the meantime, Merchan was also concerned about the logistics of accommodating Trump’s desire to be heavily involved in jury selection. Part of that process can take place in conference, outside the courtroom, if a potential juror wants to talk to Merchan and the lawyers in private. The unspoken worry hanging over the courtroom: Would a potential juror feel intimidated if Trump, exercising his right, was there, too?\n\nMerchan is working that out. He reminds me of the old deodorant ad for Ice Blue Secret. The bespectacled, snow-haired Merchan is “cool, calm and collected” and will do a terrific job in this trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 15, 2024, 11:26 a.m. ET\n\nMemory plays tricks on us. It’s famously unreliable. That’s the bane of estranged lovers weighing the wisdom of reconciliation. Of jurors determining the credibility of a witness.\n\nAnd of Americans deciding how to vote in a presidential election? The latest poll by The New York Times and Siena College makes me wonder.\n\nThe poll, published Saturday, shows Donald Trump holding on to a slight edge of 46 percent to 45 percent over President Biden. And it includes this detail: When survey respondents were asked whether they remember the years of Trump’s presidency as “mostly good,” “mostly bad” or “not really good or bad,” 42 percent said “mostly good,” while just 33 percent said “mostly bad.”\n\nMostly good? Which part? His first impeachment? His second? All the drama at the border (because, yes, there was drama at the border then, too)? All the drama in the West Wing? The revolving door of senior administration officials, his good-people-on-both-sides response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., his wishful musings about violent attacks on journalists and Democrats, his nutty soliloquies at news conferences early in the coronavirus pandemic, his recklessly cavalier handling of his own Covid infection, his incitement of the Jan. 6 rioting, the rioting itself?\n\nThose were the days.\n\nI realize that the “mostly good” camp comprises many MAGA loyalists who will simply answer any Trump-related question in a Trump-adoring way. Tribalism triumphs. I realize, too, that Americans tend to prioritize economic realities in assessments of this kind, and that much of what they’re remembering and referring to are the lower prices of housing, food and other essentials during Trump’s presidency.\n\nBut I fear that they’re forgetting too much else in a wash of voter nostalgia. A fresh presidential bid by someone who was in and then away from the White House isn’t just highly unusual. It’s a memory test — and, in the case of a politician as potentially destructive as Trump, a profoundly important one.\n\nAmericans unhappy with Biden’s presidency need no reminders about why. They’re living it every day. But their present discontent may be claiming the space on their mental hard drives where their past discontent was stored, purging all the discord and disgrace that created Biden’s opening.\n\nAbsence makes the Trump grow stronger.\n\nApril 15, 2024, 9:29 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s on.\n\nOn Monday morning, those of us fortunate enough to have a seat in the courtroom will feel the hush of history as Justice Juan Merchan opens the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump. This will be the first time since the founding of the American republic that a president of the United States has gone on trial in a criminal court.\n\nAs jury selection begins, my thoughts will inevitably turn to this striking lack of precedent. Richard Nixon was pardoned, Bill Clinton was disbarred, and Ulysses S. Grant paid a ticket for speeding in his carriage, but none faced a criminal trial.\n\nThis case is about highly credible charges that Trump falsified business records as part of a scheme to silence an adult film star and tilt the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\nThe prosecution’s argument that this is a 2016 election interference case is prompting Trump to pursue his usual I’m-rubber-you’re-glue strategy and claim that it’s really the judge and the Manhattan district attorney who are interfering — in the 2024 election. But he won’t be able to make that argument inside the courtroom.\n\nTrump will probably have to settle for sitting silently and glaring at the judge. He is a domineering client, even when it’s not in his interest, and he’ll probably weaken his case by forcing his lawyers to back his ridiculous claim that the whole extramarital affair is made up. They’ll have a better shot arguing that the hush-money payments were not illegal and Trump did not intentionally break tax and campaign finance laws.\n\nAmong the witnesses expected to testify are Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime fixer turned major accuser, whose credibility will be a big issue; Hope Hicks, Trump’s former press secretary, who could help corroborate Cohen’s testimony; Stephanie Clifford (Stormy Daniels), the porn star who received $130,000 in payments Trump is charged with laundering through Cohen; Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate of the year who also received hush money; and David Pecker, the National Enquirer chief testifying for the prosecution, whose catch-and-kill scheme to bury dirt on Trump will open a window on how tabloid journalism, well, changed world history.\n\nTrump claimed on Friday that he’s willing to testify, but that may be just his usual posturing. If he rejects the pleading of his attorneys and takes the stand, cross-examination about his many lies would be admissible.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday afternoon with a report on how the day went.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 15, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nEvery Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:\n\nDonald Trump has spent this year projecting political strength. His renomination was inevitable, and he has been ahead of Joe Biden in many battleground state polls and national polls. Keep in mind: Trump rarely led in general election polls 2016 and 2020, making his strength in the first quarter of 2024 notable. It’s one reason there’s so much talk of him winning the presidency this year.\n\nBut this week? It’s the start of the Trump vulnerability chapter of the campaign. I haven’t seen him looking this vulnerable since his 2022 Senate endorsements blew up in his face. The reasons are two twists in the race: the Trump trial and abortion.\n\nAs everyone knows, Trump’s trial in the Stormy Daniels hush money trial is set to start Monday in Manhattan. Trump has never faced a criminal jury trial in his life. I don’t think he ever thought one of these criminal trials would actually happen — he’s been an escape artist his whole life. The big question: Will this trial actually change anyone’s opinion of Trump when so much about his bad behavior is already baked into our brains? I think a conviction might — there’s some polling that suggests that independents and some Trump leaners would be less likely to vote for him if he’s convicted, especially of a criminal cover-up. Based on a lot of years reporting with voters, and our Times Opinion focus groups, I think voting for a recently convicted criminal for president will be a bridge too far for some Americans otherwise inclined to back him.\n\nOn issues, Trump has boxed himself into a position on abortion that he thought was awfully clever when he rolled it out: Let each state decide its abortion law. Then Arizona’s Supreme Court did just that, upholding a ban from 1864. I’ve rarely seen Trump look as slippery and untrustworthy with his own base, and he’s running away from abortion as far as he can. Do swing voters really believe him when he says he wouldn’t sign a national abortion ban if he had the chance? Doubt it.\n\nAs you’ll keep hearing, the election is more than six months away, and so much can change: we barely know how the Iranian attack on Israel might affect things, for instance. But for all those known unknowns, one thing is clear: Trump is entering his riskiest phase yet of the race.\n\nApril 12, 2024, 5:40 p.m. ET\n\nWhen Jimmy Buffett was dying last August, Paul McCartney came to Buffett’s house in Sag Harbor to sing to him.\n\n“He was in a pretty bad way but he still had a twinkle in his eye,” McCartney recalled. One of the songs was “Let It Be.” And on Thursday night, Sir Paul came to the Hollywood Bowl to play the piano and sing the song about an “hour of darkness” to more than 15,000 parrot heads who came together for a pirate’s wake.\n\nHawaiian shirts and grass skirts as far as the eye could see. Buffett’s music echoed through the Hollywood Hills, a celebration of oysters and beer, surf and sailing, drinking and, well, let’s call it bold barroom flirtation. “Why Don’t We Get Drunk and …” Not to mention margaritas. (Including a giant green one slurped by the former Beatle onstage.)\n\nA wild mélange of musical and Hollywood royalty showed up to honor their friend precisely because he refused to allow any hours of darkness if he could help it. Don Johnson, who hung out with Buffett in Aspen in the cocaine-fueled “Miami Vice” days, choked up as he read a Jimmy quote about making life a magical voyage. Even though there were storms and he “bounced across the bottom on occasion,” Jimmy said he relished the thousand ports of call behind him and wanted a thousand more.\n\nJane Fonda said that “Jimmy has the ability, like Tinker Bell, to spread happiness all over” — his generosity of heart and spirit always at the fore. She, John McEnroe and others paid homage to Jimmy’s love of weed with a running gag about smoking joints with him in outlandish places like the roof of the Vatican and center court at Wimbledon.\n\nThe Emperor of Key West, as he was known, was a sunny, magnetic presence in a world where the algorithms are always torquing up conflict and hatred, in a country where no one can seem to get along or even talk to one another.\n\nHarrison Ford shared the story of a “boozy lunch” with Buffett and the “60 Minutes” correspondent Ed Bradley. “I saw both of them had earrings, so right after lunch I got my ear pierced,” Ford said of his infamous piercing in his 40s. “That’s how infectious Jimmy’s coolness was.”\n\nDolly Parton, beaming in on video, reminded everyone that Buffett was more than just a guy in flip-flops. He wrote books and stuff, she said.\n\nThat stuff made him rich but he always kept the vibe of a lucky dude from the Gulf Coast who happened to busk his way to monumental success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 12, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\nWhen December rolls around, cultural critics looking for a catchy theme for the year might consider 2024 the Year of the Radical Revision, in which Black artists of some renown revisit, reinterpret and even rewrite iconic works by white artists.\n\nIn March the novelist Percival Everett published “James,” a retelling of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” from the point of view of Jim, an enslaved runaway. A few weeks later, Beyoncé dropped “Cowboy Carter,” on which she covers and partly rewrites the lyrics to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” adding a touch of flex to the desperate pleas of the original.\n\nAnd last week, the video artist Arthur Jafa unveiled his video “*****,” a revision of the gruesome climax of the 1977 film “Taxi Driver.” In the original, written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese, all the victims of Travis Bickle’s vigilante murder spree are white. In “*****” (the artist calls it “Redacted”) Jafa, through various artistic means, recasts them with Black actors, making the original film’s sublimated racial tensions explicit.\n\nThe overtones of these projects are obvious. Empowered by years of unquestionable achievement in their respective art forms, Everett, Beyoncé and Jafa can now profitably and critically engage with sacred cultural cows produced by white artists. There is — especially in Jafa’s disorienting and disturbing film — an element of confrontation. But there is also something far more complex than payback or one-upmanship involved.\n\nThe tradition of artists messing with icons isn’t new: It is straight out of Dada, whose patron saint, Marcel Duchamp, once decided to draw a mustache on a postcard of the Mona Lisa. Every generation consumes and composts the crops of the previous ones, allowing fertilization and new growth.\n\nFor me, “Taxi Driver” is a work that once seemed untouchable. In working-class Staten Island, where I grew up, we saw 1970s New York in the same grim light in which “Taxi Driver” was bathed. In our communities, the film was transgressive because it depicted a reality that could be spoken of only in whispers.\n\nWhen I finally saw the film, the idea that the rampage scene could be anything other than a cinematic icon set in stone never occurred to me. Watching Jafa’s intervention at the Gladstone Gallery in Chelsea this week cured me of that eerie nostalgia.\n\nIn my mind, the best thing about these remakes and remixes is that they are not mere protest. They don’t argue for discreditation, removal or canceling. They invite us not just to consider new art but also to send us back to the original works on our own terms.\n\nApril 12, 2024, 2:55 p.m. ET\n\nIn the mid-1990s, I spent an afternoon in the courtroom covering O.J. Simpson’s criminal trial in Los Angeles. The effect of being there — like the effect of seeing Donald Trump in court during pretrial proceedings in New York — was to shrink the whole spectacle into something more quotidian. In person, the carnival looks not just smaller than it does on TV but also a little pathetic.\n\nI’ll be covering Trump’s hush-money trial in New York beginning Monday for Times Opinion. It won’t be televised, but the comparisons between the two cases and two men are already so common that The Los Angeles Times made a typo — or Freudian slip — on Thursday, referring to Trump when the obit writer meant Simpson.\n\nYes, both cases are media circuses revolving around shameless and manipulative antiheroes who have exploited race for their advantage. Both tap into the weakness Americans have for toxic celebrities who play victim as they stick it to the man. Both lead millions to despair over whether justice can ever prevail.\n\nBut the similarities can be misleading and not just because the Simpson trial was for murder and the Trump case is about falsifying business records.\n\nWhile murder is obviously more serious legally and morally, the fate of a former president of the United States indicted on 88 counts across four criminal cases in four jurisdictions is more serious and important historically than the fate of a former N.F.L. star who did TV ads for Hertz.\n\nSimpson’s epic journey — with its mix of fame, race and violence — was a quintessentially American story. The Trump saga has all of that plus immense political stakes, but the fundamental question remains: Is he un-American or in the American grain?\n\nTrump’s shocking victory in 2016 did not settle the matter. We will learn in this trial what almost every political consultant in both parties agrees on: that Trump would have lost that year and been reduced to a footnote if Stormy Daniels had told her story on the heels of the “Access Hollywood” debacle, which sent his campaign reeling. He won only because the 2016 election ended with the focus on Hillary Clinton’s emails.\n\nSo beyond legal culpability and political maneuvering, what’s at stake in this trial and this election is whether Trump is an aberration or the embodiment of a new, darker American identity.\n\nBoth Simpson and Trump are mirrors reflecting two images of America — one Black, one white, in Simpson’s case; one Democratic, one Republican, in Trump’s. All of the mirrors are cracked and coming apart, with the shards sharp enough to puncture any remaining illusions we have about ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 12, 2024, 10:34 a.m. ET\n\nMy, oh my. Look who’s getting unhitched.\n\nIt turns out Gerry Turner, the first and much-ballyhooed Golden Bachelor, didn’t find his soul mate in Theresa Nist after all. After just three months of wedded bliss, the couple is getting divorced, according to People magazine.\n\nWho could have predicted that one?\n\nAnswer: everyone.\n\nAdmission: I hate reality TV. And I really hate the “Bachelor” franchise. But I found myself mesmerized by this particular variation, with its focus on matchmaking among the over-60 set. The whole display, with the contestants desperate to convey their eternal youthfulness even as they lamented the challenges of growing older, perfectly captured America’s — and especially the boomers’ — awkward relationship with aging.\n\nAlas, not even the wisdom of their years could save Gerry and Theresa from the fundamental phoniness of reality TV. But, hey, at least they got a glam wedding — televised, even! — and some cool gifts out of it. And my faith in the fundamental grossness of the franchise has been fortified.\n\nApril 12, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nThe case of Julian Assange must rank among the most bizarre in the annals of legal wrangling. The founder of WikiLeaks, a site dedicated to publishing leaked information, Assange has spent five years in a high-security British prison and, before that, almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, all without ever going on trial. Basically, he has sacrificed those 12 years of his life to avoid having to face espionage charges in the United States.\n\nWith a ruling by a British high court on extraditing him to the United States finally imminent, the case has taken two turns. One was a request by Australia, where Assange is from, to drop the prosecution and let him go home. The other was President Biden saying, “We’re considering it.”\n\nThe president should grant Australia’s request.\n\nNot because Assange is innocent or noble. He was originally wanted in Sweden in connection with a sexual assault investigation that was subsequently dropped, and he has demonstrated a distinct preference for authoritarian regimes over democracies. The deed for which the United States is after him, the publication of an enormous trove of classified documents supplied by a U.S. Army private, Chelsea Manning, was carried out without any of the precautions news organizations normally take to protect individuals or information that could imperil national security.\n\nThe case should be dropped, first of all, because the charge of espionage brought by the Trump administration poses a serious threat to the First Amendment and to the fundamental role of a free press in keeping tabs on government, via whistle-blowers and leakers, if need be. President Barack Obama decided against an espionage charge for that reason and charged Assange only with assisting Manning in breaking into government computer systems in 2010, a crime that falls outside the standards of journalism.\n\nBut Donald Trump, who famously branded the free press as “the enemy of the people,” had no such compunction and set the stage for a trial that could challenge the distinction between exposing abuse of power and helping foreign adversaries harm the United States.\n\nThis is not a case the Biden administration should be prosecuting. Given the time Assange has already been in effective detention — far more than the nearly seven years Manning served before her 35-year sentence was commuted by Obama as “very disproportionate relative to what other leakers have received” — the president can legitimately argue that Assange has been amply punished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 11, 2024, 6:12 p.m. ET\n\nHear that? It’s the sound of Republican politicians smacking their foreheads as yet another abortion-related development complicates their 2024 election landscape.\n\nThis time, it’s Arizona at the eye of the storm. Tuesday’s decision by the State Supreme Court to uphold a near-total abortion ban from 1864 — well before the state was even a state — is not going to do the party any favors. No exceptions for rape and incest? Tossing doctors in prison? Yeah. That ought to win over some hearts and minds.\n\nIt also throws a wrench in Donald Trump’s weak efforts this week to defuse the abortion issue by insisting he wants it left up to the states. I mean, with state laws like these …\n\nSupporters of reproductive rights are aiming to put a measure on the Arizona ballot in November that would enshrine abortion access in the state Constitution. Organizers say they already have more than enough signatures to qualify. This promises to put Arizona in a position very similar to the one in which Florida finds itself.\n\nBut politically speaking, Arizona ain’t Florida. It is swingier, more purple. More than a third of its voters are not registered with any political party, and the electorate prides itself on being mavericky. With the proper care and attention, this abortion dust-up could cause Republicans up and down the state ballot some serious heartburn.\n\nAlready, Kari Lake, the MAGA front-runner in the Republican Senate primary, has been compelled to execute an awkward flip-flop. Having proclaimed the 1864 ban a “great law” during her 2022 run for governor, she is now running away from it as fast as she can. Like Trump, Lake isn’t so much anti-abortion as she is politically shameless.\n\nAnd what of the presidential race? For months, Trump has been running an average of four to five points ahead of President Biden in the state. Despite the requisite acknowledgment that November is still four or five political eternities away, those aren’t comforting numbers for Democrats, especially with the border crisis, a rather urgent concern for Arizonans, shaping up to be a prime campaign cudgel for Republicans.\n\nThe state’s abortion developments will not fix the border mess — or erase the general disappointment many voters feel toward Biden. But they could stick in the craws of plenty of Arizona mavericks, making them think twice about giving the guy who boasts of killing Roe v. Wade another four years to run amok.\n\nHere’s hoping.\n\nApril 11, 2024, 6:00 p.m. ET\n\nO.J. Simpson will be remembered not for his athletic ability, but as a spectacle.\n\nMost people tend to think the O.J. story started when the Los Angeles police chased a white Ford Bronco down a deserted highway. But for Black America, the O.J. spectacle began on March 3, 1991, when Los Angeles police officers viciously beat Rodney King. Even though the beating was captured on videotape, the officers were acquitted and the city went up in flames. The O.J. Simpson legend began when the nation decided that King must have done something to deserve his beating.\n\nEvery generation of Black people has a moment when this nation betrays them: Emmett Till, the bombing of American citizens in Philadelphia, white racist violence in Tulsa, Okla., the executions of Malcolm X and, later, Trayvon Martin. Rodney King was my generation’s; his beating showed me that a new day had not dawned in this country for Black opportunity and acceptance. Simpson’s legal team was able to paint a story in which he symbolized Black martyrdom to Black America because of such betrayals.\n\nWhen the Simpson verdict was announced in 1995, I was standing in the student union of my historically Black college. My peers collectively sighed in relief when he was acquitted. But, if the King verdict was the moment when my generation fell out of love with our country, Black America’s relief at the Simpson verdict was the moment that white America fell out of love with the promise of diversity.\n\nSadly, a woman paid the ultimate price for the O.J. Simpson legend. By many accounts, O.J. abused Nicole Simpson for years. He got away with it through a kind of carte blanche usually reserved for powerful white men, because his public mythology erased his private abuses. For Simpson, that must have felt like a certain type of moving on up.\n\nIn a remarkable ESPN documentary, “O.J.: Made in America,” Harry Edwards, a sociologist and activist, remembers when Simpson declined to join a group of Black athletes who were campaigning for civil rights, saying “I’m not Black, I’m O.J.” That line captures the essence of O.J. Simpson, the man and the public figure.\n\nHe wanted to be above the rules not because of what he was but because of who he was. It’s the height of karmic irony, then, that what ultimately made Simpson special was the way his Blackness — that socially constructed distance from the white acceptance he so clearly craved — will forever define his legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 11, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET\n\nSoon after the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, the Israeli defense minister vowed to impose a “complete siege” on Gaza: “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into the territory.\n\nSince then, Israel has allowed some food and other supplies into Gaza, with tight restrictions. As a result, aid organizations have reported starvation, particularly in northern Gaza. Now this appears to have resulted in actual famine, according to Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nIn testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Power said that reports that famine was imminent in northern Gaza were credible. Then she was asked directly by Representative Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, “So famine is already occurring there?”\n\n“That is — yes,” she replied.\n\nThe official arbiter of famines, an international group of specialists, has not yet designated a famine underway in Gaza using its technical criteria, but the official declarations are based on lagging indicators. So Power’s statement should be taken mostly as a sign of the general seriousness of the food crisis and the risks of widespread death if it continues.\n\nMalnutrition is already killing children in Gaza; 28 deaths have been officially reported so far. When an area is teetering on the edge of famine, deaths can escalate very rapidly.\n\nFamines primarily kill children under the age of 5. I’ve covered hunger crises around the world, and the scenes are horrible to witness. Dying children are passive, expressionless, silent, not crying — because the body is using every calorie to keep the major organs functioning.\n\nConflicts in poor countries often kill far more people through hunger and disease than through bombs and bullets. What is unusual about Gaza is this hunger crisis is unfolding in a small, accessible area where 3,000 to 7,000 trucks are reportedly waiting at the border with food. Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly denied that it obstructs aid. But in the past few days, after a threat by President Biden to put conditions on arms transfers, Israel has allowed far more trucks to enter Gaza. That aid also needs to be distributed, which requires a well-functioning infrastructure that is not now in place.\n\nThe importance of the word “famine” is that it can light a fire under international officials and groups to act urgently to save children’s lives. The test of Power’s warning is whether, for America and Israel alike, this actually leads to steps on the ground.\n\nApril 11, 2024, 1:09 p.m. ET\n\nIn 1995, when O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, The New York Times ran dueling photos on its front page.\n\nOne showed white people aghast: a man with his mouth agape, a woman with one hand on her head and the other hugging her own body. The other photo showed three Black people embracing in celebration, one of them, Sylvia Woods, an owner of a popular restaurant in Harlem, seeming to yell, with her arms stretched wide and fists clenched.\n\nThese images captured the way the trial and its verdict sharply divided the country by race. Many white people saw it as a straightforward case in which the victims, suspect and evidence were clearly defined. For them, the celebration of the verdict by Black people was perverse, an extreme case of racial tribalism and a disregard for basic humanity.\n\nMany Black people, however, saw it quite differently. O.J. Simpson — who died on Thursday at 76 — was no paragon of Blackness; in fact, he wanted to transcend racial categories. He told The Times in 1994 that his biggest accomplishment was being seen as a man first, not a Black man.\n\nIt’s not that most Black people thought him innocent or another Rosa Parks. For them, it was the system itself that was on trial. The question wasn’t whether the justice system would work equally in the service of justice but whether its inherent and inveterate injustices would also be applied equally.\n\nThe Simpson trial came in the shadow of the trial of the police officers who savagely beat Rodney King and were still found not guilty. Los Angeles exploded in riots. Scores of people were killed. Buildings were reduced to ashes. It was one of the costliest riots, in terms of property damage, in American history.\n\nPeople had exhaled their frustration in a language of death and destruction, but the violence was ultimately injurious to their own communities, and it brought no gesture or symbol of rectitude from the justice system itself.\n\nThe Simpson trial, in a strange way, held promise of closure in the ancient eye-for-an-eye sense. Could a Black man, with evidence stacked against him, be acquitted in the same way that those white men, with evidence stacked against them, were?\n\nThe answer was yes.\n\nParadoxically and, quite frankly, depressingly, the verdict proved that injustice was an equal opportunity offender, at least in this rarest of cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 11, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET\n\nIn 2019, I waited for hours in the Tokyo heat, in a crowd of thousands, for a glimpse of royalty. The crowd snapped photos and waved flags as Naruhito stood high above us, behind glass in his first public appearance as Japan’s emperor. He waved. I think he also smiled. Sweat dripped down my neck.\n\nIt was all a bit underwhelming, much like the imperial family’s first social media account, on Instagram, which went public last week. It is, expectedly, a bore: No selfies or phone snaps here, few flickers of personality.\n\nIt’s not surprising that a 2019 poll found that a bit more than half of 18-to-29-year-olds in Japan have little or no interest in the imperial household. Even creating an Instagram account seems like an acknowledgment by the monarchy that it’s straining to connect with its people and fighting for relevance in a shifting world.\n\nBut if you look hard enough at the page, there are glimpses through the veil: The royals stand before bonsai trees and seem to smile. They kneel in front of earthquake survivors — a symbolic gesture with decades of precedent. The institution has never been much for outsize personalities, so this may be all we get. But it is progress.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency, the family’s keeper, has tightly controlled its image for decades. In 1990 a photographer caught an informal, if not endearing, moment at a royal wedding: The bride smiled as she brushed aside the hair of the groom. That was too much. The agency reportedly reprimanded the offending photographer.\n\nDoes the Instagram page signal a real loosening up of this old institution? Probably not. But seven years ago, Naruhito, then the crown prince, promised change, which seems possible as the first emperor to study abroad. (He spent two years at Oxford and has said he loved the experience.) His father, Akihito, redefined the role over three decades of rule; perhaps Naruhito can do the same.\n\nI am a little doubtful that the monarchy can reach a younger crowd. The family appears too buttoned up on Instagram, much like the institution itself. Still, in a little more than a week, the page has gotten almost a million followers. Perhaps this is a turning point, when the institution begins to transform its image, drawing in a new, younger swath of people.\n\nApril 10, 2024, 6:19 p.m. ET\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party was in full-scale meltdown Wednesday afternoon after the state’s highest court banned virtually all forms of abortion there. If the issue weren’t so serious, it would be comical to watch Republican leaders scurrying away from one of their most fervently held positions once they realized how devastating the ruling could be to their political prospects, and particularly to Donald Trump’s chances of winning the crucial swing state in November.\n\nThere were chaotic scenes on the floor of the Arizona House as Republican legislators argued with one another over whether to repeal the 1864 abortion ban that was upheld by the state Supreme Court the day before. At one point, according to The Arizona Republic, Representative Matt Gress, a Phoenix Republican, brought up a bill to repeal the law, but Democratic lawmakers ran over and reminded him that he had sponsored fetal personhood bills. “Do not fall for it,” yelled one Democrat, in a video taken on the House floor. Without a plan, Republicans, who control the chamber, were so shaken that they quickly recessed the House for a week, preventing a repeal vote.\n\nThe party’s panic was led, naturally, by Trump, who is most vulnerable to the anger by virtue of his appointment of three anti-abortion justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, leading to the repeal of Roe v. Wade and thus the re-imposition of old state bans like Arizona’s. On Wednesday, Trump said the Arizona ban went too far, and he predicted the state would fix it. But the hypocrisy of state leaders was, if anything, even more egregious. Kari Lake, a Trump acolyte and U.S. Senate candidate, quickly denounced the court ruling, though she had said less than two years ago that the ban was a “great law.”\n\nJuan Ciscomani, a Republican congressman from the state, who had supported a 15-week abortion ban and has repeatedly voted to restrict abortion access, called the court ruling “a disaster.” His Arizona colleague David Schweikert, who has an A+ rating from anti-abortion groups, said the issue shouldn’t be “legislated from the bench” and demanded the legislature take action.\n\nBut Democrats — and hopefully state voters — aren’t going to let Republicans run away from their own records. As a beautifully made Biden campaign ad on the terrible dangers of abortion bans said this week, “Donald Trump did this.” And so did his party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 10, 2024, 2:27 p.m. ET\n\nYesterday marked the release of the long-awaited Cass Report, a four-year review of the National Health Service’s gender medicine program for minors in England.\n\nAs a result of this review, conducted by Hilary Cass, an independent pediatrician, the health service will no longer offer puberty-blocking drugs except for patients enrolled in clinical trials and will offer cross-sex hormones to children only with extreme caution. This makes England the fifth country in Europe to restrict the medical treatment of gender dysphoria in minors, or part of what proponents refer to as “gender-affirming care.”\n\nAccording to the report, there is no good evidence that these treatments — specifically, the use of puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones — have significant positive impact on physical or mental well-being. And the risk of long-term harms remains largely unknown.\n\nFor those who have followed the medical research, and for parents concerned about the quality of care for their children, this was overdue and welcome news. Parents and caregivers have been frustrated by activists and a compliant medical establishment that insist medically and surgically altering their kids’ bodies and brains, sometimes primarily based on a child’s self-diagnosis, was the proper course of treatment. And that to raise any questions was akin to child abuse and transphobia.\n\nTo quote from the review: “There are few other areas of health care where professionals are so afraid to openly discuss their views.” The vilification and bullying, it said, “must stop.”\n\nFortunately, England has recognized the problem. But the American Academy of Pediatrics has dug in its heels. Last summer, despite finally ceding to a systematic review (with no results yet), it reaffirmed its commitment to “gender-affirming care,” describing such treatment as essential.\n\nWhy has the United States remained so stubbornly behind?\n\nOne reason is that American medical institutions have largely relied on sporadic studies conducted in the United States or on the guidelines of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, an organization whose mission, based on criticism and leaked files, has slipped from transgender medical care into advocacy.\n\nInstead of demanding strong, evidence-based medicine, the Biden administration and the medical establishment have left a vacuum for ideologues, activists and politicians to dictate protocols. Republican lawmakers have stepped in with bans of gender medicine in ways that have also threatened rights and protections for transgender adults. Instead of a dispassionate assessment of evidence, we have a partisan culture war.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine any other childhood condition, illness or disorder being treated with such cavalier indifference to the human beings in question. Children deserve progress and proven health care, not political gamesmanship.\n\nApril 10, 2024, 12:05 p.m. ET\n\nThe surprisingly hot inflation numbers that the government put out Wednesday show, once again, how little we understand what makes prices go up (and sometimes down).\n\nBy “we,” I mean everyone, including officials of the Federal Reserve, which is trying, without complete success, to get inflation back down to its target rate of 2 percent annually.\n\n“As is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies,” Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, said at the annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in March from February, above the 0.3 percent that many economists had predicted. Monthly core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also 0.4 percent. Over the past year, the index for all items rose 3.5 percent.\n\nEach inflation report is fresh fodder for the argument between economists who worry that inflation will persist at well above the Fed’s target and those who expect it to resume its downward trend soon.\n\nNervous investors may be overreacting to Wednesday’s data, according to David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, based in Toronto. In a client note, he wrote that “the report showed plenty of deflationary thumbprints where it matters — in demand-sensitive areas.” Prices of sporting goods, toys, appliances and vehicles fell in March, he noted.\n\nThere’s always a lot of noise in the monthly data. Over the longer term, the mystery isn’t why inflation is high but the opposite: why it fell so much from its pandemic peak, even though labor markets have remained tight. Conventional wisdom is that when workers are scarce, they use their bargaining power to demand higher wages, which fuels inflation. That hasn’t happened much.\n\nServaas Storm, a senior lecturer of economics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, wrote this week in an article for the Institute for New Economic Thinking that the behavior of inflation has discredited conventional New Keynesian theories about why prices rise and fall.\n\nStorm wrote that central bankers such as Powell “are clear that standard macro models are of little use to them in the current macroeconomic environment.”\n\nThat’s a strong claim — perhaps too strong — but it does fit with Powell’s Jackson Hole metaphor about navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. Inflation remains poorly understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 10, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nWednesday is the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the beginning of jubilant Eid al-Fitr celebrations around the world. After 30 days of fasting and prayer, Muslims put on their best clothes, prepare their best foods and spend time with friends and family.\n\nBut this Eid is more somber than any other in recent memory. The war in Gaza is now more than six months old. Reports of famine-like conditions appear as often as images of Palestinians performing janaza, Islamic funeral prayers, over their relatives’ bodies.\n\nNot all Palestinians are Muslim, but the plight of the Palestinians is tied intrinsically to the ummah, or Muslim community. Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is the third-holiest site in our religion. For decades, as wars erupted in the region, imams would tell their congregations to witness the injustice Palestinians experienced there. Whether you grew up in Jakarta or Cairo or, as I did, in Carmel, Ind., solidarity with Palestinians was part of being Muslim.\n\nAs the war in Gaza roiled communities across the United States, this year’s Ramadan gave Muslims an opportunity to gather at mosques or at iftar dinners when we broke our fasts. If the rest of the world felt hostile, there we could openly share our anguish and talk about how we have navigated our workplaces and social lives. I almost didn’t realize how often I had my guard up until I walked into these spaces.\n\nI’ve seen American Muslim spaces become a refuge this way before. During the height of the war on terrorism, when our faith felt so fundamentally misunderstood by the country we lived in, our community felt like a place of respite. I’ve thought about those days often during this war. As much as I cherish the ability of Muslims to come together in times of conflict, I also remember how the hostility of those years led many Muslims to retreat into tradition and community rather than engage with the outside world.\n\nI don’t see the same shift happening this Ramadan. While Islam offers me community, it also has given me the strength to engage with those who aren’t like me.\n\nSo often, we’re made to remember how we are different from others. But Islam teaches us not just how to be Muslim among other Muslims but also how to live and engage with the world outside the ummah. My hope for this Eid is that other Muslims — and non-Muslims — take this lesson with them.\n\nApril 9, 2024, 6:08 p.m. ET\n\nThere’s no more important relationship in the world than the one between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies. And yet not enough Americans know about the history of confrontations — and human connections — between those superpowers that have brought us to the current level of political tension and economic cooperation.\n\nAmericans who got outraged about China’s spy balloon in 2023 should know about the long history of American spying on China. Those who hope to avoid military conflict with China in the future ought to consider how one was avoided when a Chinese fighter pilot confronted — and then collided with — a U.S. military spy plane in 2001.\n\nAs China grows more powerful, we had better get far more familiar with the events that have shaped how we are viewed by friends and adversaries alike.\n\nOne useful guide to the subject is Jane Perlez, a former New York Times Beijing bureau chief, who has spent much of her time in recent years producing podcasts about the hidden history that has led to the current moment.\n\nIn 2022, Perlez created “The Great Wager,” a five-part podcast series from NPR about President Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 trip to China. And on Tuesday, she dropped a new eight-part series called “Face-Off: U.S. vs China,” available on Apple and Spotify.\n\nWant to know how China managed to uncover a network of American spies in 2010, and the ramifications that reverberate to this day? Ever wondered about the personal chemistry (or lack thereof) between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping? Or how one of the most important companies in the United States — Apple — came to rely so heavily on the Chinese Communist Party? The podcast has you covered.\n\nI’ve known Perlez since my days as an unpaid intern in the Nairobi bureau of The Times in the 1990s, and there are few people I consider more knowledgeable about China. An old-school reporter, Perlez avoids inserting her own opinion into her podcasts, but her devotion to unearthing hidden gems from this rapidly evolving relationship reveals a point of view that is rarely heard in Washington these days: History matters, and Americans ought to get far more familiar with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 9, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\n\nIn the early 1940s, the British scientist Joseph Needham roamed the Chinese countryside. After his travels, he wrote a book series asking why China didn’t beat Europe to the scientific revolution, since China was so inventive throughout its history.\n\nThis Needham question, long debated by historians, gets an update in Netflix’s “3 Body Problem,” which adapts the Chinese author Liu Cixin’s book for a Western audience. In the story, aliens known as San-Ti are bound to conquer Earth in 400 years. They’re light-years ahead technologically, having mastered quantum computing, artificial intelligence and space travel. Humanity’s only chance to mount a planetary defense is to dive headfirst into technological development at an exponential pace.\n\nAs many book readers and series viewers have pointed out, the impending alien invasion is a fitting allegory for U.S.-China competition. There’s a looming conflict against a technologically adept superpower, and it will take rapid scientific innovation to survive. Who the aliens represent depends on which side of the Pacific you’re on.\n\nThis is the new Needham question: Which country is poised to beat the other to the next scientific revolution of computing, A.I. and space travel?\n\nThe San-Ti launch subatomic supercomputers at Earth to keep Earth’s technology stunted; the Biden administration has a similar strategy to keep China’s semiconductors several generations behind those of the United States. The Netflix series’s imagery of a hidden but all-seeing alien supercomputer conjures fears of Chinese surveillance infiltrating Western research institutions.\n\nHowever, the most important conflict in the story unfolds between the two rival human approaches to defeating the aliens. The first camp is ruthless, willing to sacrifice the few for the perceived benefit of the many. The second camp represents a more humanistic approach, seeing value in all human life.\n\nIn Liu’s telling, the ruthless rationalists win out. The story has become a popular text among Chinese nationalists who revel in authoritarianism as a justification for scientific development. The Netflix show has not taken a firm side in this debate, though it has been more sympathetic to the humanists.\n\nUrsula Le Guin has framed science fiction as a thought experiment better suited to describing the present than to forecasting. But what does Liu, a shrewd engineer-turned-novelist, make of bleak moral and geopolitical interpretations of his work? His first edition’s postscript offers a clue. He wrote, “It’s just science fiction, no need to take it seriously. :)”\n\nApril 9, 2024, 11:26 a.m. ET\n\nA joint investigation by Russian, American and German reporters has produced evidence that is chilling and plausible, albeit not conclusive, that Havana syndrome — painful and debilitating medical episodes experienced by scores of American diplomats and intelligence officers over the past decade — is the work of a special Russian spy unit dedicated to assassination and mayhem.\n\nThe reporting by The Insider, a Russia-focused investigative news outlet, in collaboration with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and CBS’s “60 Minutes,” sharply challenges earlier assertions by U.S. intelligence agencies that what they called anomalous health incidents were very unlikely to be the work of a foreign power.\n\nIn typical cases, victims reported sudden and acute pain, usually to one side of the head, followed by prolonged bouts of headaches and dizziness. The Biden administration and Congress have nonetheless enacted legislation providing compensation to victims, some of whom have been unable to continue work.\n\nDrawing on interviews with victims and an impressive mastery of online snooping, the investigative reporters found various links between the attacks and Unit 29155, a division of the Russian military intelligence agency G.R.U., known to U.S. intelligence agencies for conducting lethal operations and sabotage the world over. Operatives of Unit 29155 were placed at sites of several anomalous health incidents; more damningly, the reporters discovered that senior members of the unit had received awards for work on “nonlethal acoustic weapons,” which in Russia refers to directed-energy devices based on sound or radio frequencies.\n\nOne of the key pieces in the puzzle was supplied by the wife of an official at the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, who was struck with acute pain in her head while doing laundry at home. Spotting a car on the house’s security camera, she managed to get to the street in time to see a tall, thin man and to photograph his car. She subsequently identified a photograph of Albert Averyanov, an operative of Unit 29155 and the son of the founding commander of the unit, Gen. Andrei Averyanov.\n\nThe pattern of the attacks suggested the targeted American intelligence officers and diplomats were working or had worked on Russia matters, including C.I.A. officers who worked with Ukraine.\n\nThe full report of The Insider is a gripping read. The question it leaves unanswered is whether the U.S. government knew what the reporters discovered and, if so, whether the government was hiding it. Either way, the victims, many still suffering, deserve a thorough investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 9, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s hard to wrap your mind around the television ratings for Caitlin Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the women’s college basketball tournament. Her Elite Eight game against her rival Angel Reese and Louisiana State University was the highest-rated college basketball game in ESPN history. More than 12 million people tuned in, and the audience peaked at 16.1 million. Then, days later, Clark’s team broke the record again. This time more than 14 million people watched, and the audience peaked at 17 million.\n\nThe ratings for Sunday night’s final were even more impressive. An incredible 18.7 million people watched. The game was the most-watched basketball game in America — N.C.A.A. or N.B.A. — since the 2019 men’s N.C.A.A. final.\n\nThere is a lesson in those ratings, one that goes beyond Clark’s generational talent. If she’d been a man, she’d have had one good year in college, perhaps enjoyed a decent tournament run, and then dashed off to the N.B.A. Fans wouldn’t know they’d witnessed greatness.\n\nThat’s the nature of the one-and-done men’s college game. Transcendent talents don’t stay, and teams with longstanding rosters don’t have transcendent talents. And so you’re left with a sport that both lacks stars and (relatedly) puts an inferior product on the court.\n\nThere are obvious economic reasons for the current reality. Young men have immediate access to huge professional salaries. The average N.B.A. salary is more than $10 million. The W.N.B.A. average barely tops $100,000. It’s financially irrational for a young man to stay in the N.C.A.A. when vast wealth awaits him for turning pro. But the cost to the N.C.A.A. and the N.B.A. is real. If players stayed, college ball would benefit from having better play on the court, and pro ball would benefit from drafting players who are already household names and bring a fan base with them into the league.\n\nWith the advent of compensation for name, image and likeness, one wonders: Can the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A. recreate that Caitlin Clark magic, but for men? Let’s have the players stay in college longer, compensate them fairly while they’re in school, and then let them loose on the N.B.A. after they’ve built their game and their name. The women have shown the way.\n\nApril 8, 2024, 7:27 p.m. ET\n\n“How Far Can You Go?” is the title of a novel by David Lodge, published in 1980 and portraying the lives of young English Catholics from the 1950s through the Second Vatican Council and its aftermath. The titular question refers to both sex and faith — what kinds of intimacy are allowed to Catholic couples before marriage, and what remains of belief after a period of dramatic religious change?\n\nLodge’s title could also usefully refer to the pontificate of Pope Francis, whose style has been to consistently push at the boundaries of his office, testing how far a pope can go in altering Catholic teaching.\n\nCan divorced and remarried Catholics receive communion without an annulment? Sometimes, maybe, no: It depends on how you interpret a papal footnote. Is the death penalty intrinsically immoral? Almost certainly, but with just a tiny bit of wiggle room to preserve continuity with the church’s past teachings. Can same-sex couples receive a blessing? Well, you see, it depends on the meaning of “blessing” and “couple”….\n\nIn the first two cases, divorce and the death penalty, the pope’s pushing and prodding mostly survived objections from the church’s conservatives. In the third case, the recent document that maybe, sort-of allowed for blessings of gay couples, his fingers got burned; there was a conspicuous revolt by bishops worldwide (not just his reliable foils among American conservatives), a hasty attempt at clarification and water-calming, and a sense that the pope had gone too far.\n\nThat’s the background for the Vatican document issued on Monday on human dignity, Dignitas Infinita, apparently many years in the making but probably not coincidentally timed to the current moment in the Francis papacy. The document is prolix enough to contain multitudes, but it comes across as an unusually sharp condemnation of transgender identity, surrogacy and abortion, a clearer-than-usual line against developments in progressive thought and culture.\n\nIt’s still very much a Francis-era document: His condemnation of the death penalty is especially emphasized, his rhetoric of inclusion and critiques of anti-gay discrimination are still present. But the fact that it’s attracted more praise from conservative-leaning theologians and more disappointment or “whiplash” from groups seeking changes around issues of sexuality is pretty clearly an intended outcome.\n\nFrancis has spent years balancing between conservatives and progressives but favoring the latter. This document puts a limit to that favoritism, a this-far-no-further, at least when it comes what the Vatican teaches. What it will tolerate, from the more liberal branches of the church especially, is the key question that remainder of his pontificate will answer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 8, 2024, 5:47 p.m. ET\n\nSix years as a space reporter taught me that chaos reigns supreme. I have watched enough go wrong to know no mission or any view of a celestial event is ever truly promised to us terrestrial observers.\n\nSo when my mother and I decided to drive out to Erie, Pa., to see Monday’s solar eclipse within the path of totality, I knew this would be a trip of two clashing attitudes. I’d be pessimistic about the weather and convinced we’d be victims of the randomness that governs the world; my mom would have strong faith that order would triumph and the skies would let us glimpse an eclipse like this for the first time in our lives. I told her not to count on the universe for this one; she told me she wouldn’t count on anything else.\n\nI was once again humbled into a lesson I’ve learned time and time again: Mama knows best. Erie’s forecast this morning was looking abysmal, but by the time first contact began a little after 2 p.m., the clouds over the city’s bay front began to disperse. The pale yellow sun under the eclipse lenses rapidly crested, concentrating into a fierce orange glow.\n\nTotality struck at 3:16 p.m. A thin white glow pierced out from the edge of a clean black circle. The colors of the sunset eerily bloomed in the distance. Clamoring sea gulls took a haphazard flight. I could spot solar prominences (regions of intense magnetism) jutting from the sides of the sun in tiny hints of bright red and pink. Jupiter and Venus made cameos. It felt like bearing witness to something close to a miracle.\n\nFour minutes later, totality ended. The sun brightened again. And the clouds returned with a vengeance, swallowing up the moon and the sun and sky in gray. But for four incredible minutes, the universe seems to have made good on a promise to my mother.\n\nApril 8, 2024, 3:48 p.m. ET\n\nI remember fairly little of the celestial details of my first total solar eclipse, which I saw with my mother and brother. Even so, my memory of that day is indelible.\n\nMy brother and I had some qualms about making the trip. My mother’s alcoholism wasn’t stable at all — she could be all smiles, charming and funny, and she’d disappear for three minutes and chug vodka straight out of the bottle. But somehow, the day of the eclipse went beautifully. It was the last time I saw my mother when she was happy, with family, outdoors and sober.\n\nAll that got overshadowed when just one week later there was a major earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, near a town I had spent many years in as a child. I traveled to the region and spent two weeks pulling people from the rubble. Tens of thousands had died.\n\nJust three months later, my mother was found dead. I rushed back to Istanbul to comfort my grandmother and for the funeral. While I was in my mother’s flat, I felt another rumble. It turned out to be a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Duzce, Turkey. I went there too, but I didn’t stay long.\n\nNow whenever I see photos of rubble or pancaked buildings from an earthquake, I smell the unmistakable stench of corpses trapped in the wreckage, rotting in the summer sun. A hallucination, but of smell.\n\nLast Friday, amid preparations for another trip to see the eclipse, again with my family, I felt another rumble. An unexpected earthquake, this time in New York City, my home.\n\nThere are many theories and superstitions about eclipses and earthquakes that geologists don’t put much stock in, but in my case, there had been a very personal triad of eclipse, earthquake and death. I was rattled.\n\nLater, I made tea and spinach pastries, an afternoon ritual that reminds me of my grandmother. Then it hit me. I was trying to clear one association in my head — the eclipse-earthquake-tragedy triad — with another one, my grandmother’s love.\n\nWhat else is life but building good associations to chase away the bad?\n\nIt’s corny but it’s true: It’s not the events themselves that matter but who we are with to share the wonder of how the sun and the moon align to cast an enchanting shadow on our miraculous planet full of life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 8, 2024, 2:21 p.m. ET\n\nDonald Trump now says he wants to leave abortion up to the states. People, would you say this is:\n\nA. His third position on abortion\n\nB. His fifth position on abortion\n\nC. Somewhere from fifth to 47th.\n\nYeah, definitely in the whole-bunch arena. Back in the day, he thought it was a woman’s right. “I’m very pro-choice,” he said in 1999. He wouldn’t even denounce those late-term, “partial birth” abortions that people were yelling about at the time. “I hate the concept of abortion,” he said, “but still, I just believe in choice.”\n\nHe did, like almost all the folks he’d hung out with in his New York celebrity-keen prepolitics life. But once he started running for president, Trump seemed to notice that people at right-wing political gatherings put ending abortion very, very high on their priority lists.\n\nSuddenly he was a believer; he bragged that his Supreme Court nominations were going to turn the law around. And gee whiz, they did.\n\nThanks to Trump, there’s no national protection of a woman’s right to choose. The states have started to do their own things, and as abortion access dwindled, Trump discovered that — new surprise! — Republicans were losing elections over the issue. It’s arguably one of the top reasons the House of Representatives, which was supposed to get a big influx of Republicans in 2022, wound up split almost down the middle. Trump’s party now has a majority thinning faster than his hair.\n\nHe was reportedly considering a national abortion ban as recently as February and hasn’t ruled out signing one. What else could he do now? How about … try to push the whole issue onto the state legislatures?\n\nThink about this. Maybe, like many Trump Republicans, you believe that human life has to be protected from the moment of conception. Maybe, like many, many other Americans, you believe a decision about continuing or ending pregnancy should be a woman’s personal, private issue.\n\nOr maybe you believe it should all boil down to the state representative from East Kumquat, who chairs one particular subcommittee.\n\nNot that one? Tell it to Donald. I’m sure he’s open to a mind change.\n\nApril 8, 2024, 12:25 p.m. ET\n\nSusan and Martin Cherry were perfectly placed to cash in on Monday’s eclipse. Their Cherry House Bed and Breakfast in St. Johnsbury, Vt., is in the zone of totality. They’ve known an eclipse was coming since 2017. When people started inquiring years ago about reservations for April 7 and 8, 2024, they knew exactly why.\n\nSo they raised their rates … not a penny.\n\n“Not a bit. Not even a little,” Susan Cherry told me. “We don’t think we should make anybody else pay extra for something that’s going to be absolutely phenomenal.”\n\nJournalists have collected lots of stories about crazy-high rates for lodging in the zone of totality. The Times reported last week on a Super 8 in Grayville, Ill., that was advertising a room for $949 a night for Sunday to Tuesday, 10 times the usual nightly rate.\n\nBut it turns out the Cherrys aren’t so unusual in failing to exploit the profit opportunity that fell from the sky into their laps. According to AirDNA, which tracks the posted rates by property owners on Airbnb and VRBO, as of last week the average daily rate for bookings for the eclipse was up only 20.5 percent from the same time a year ago, adjusting for time of week.\n\nI asked Jamie Lane, AirDNA’s chief economist, why lodging owners are leaving $100 bills on the sidewalk. Nothing new, he said: “Most people don’t adjust their rates a lot in response to changes in demand.”\n\nI asked him whether some lodging owners filled up their rooms at the standard rate before they realized why April 7 and April 8 were so popular. Lane said that explanation makes sense to him. “Something as obscure as a celestial event I think caught people off guard,” he said.\n\nThat doesn’t explain the Cherrys’ pricing decision, though, since they did know about the eclipse. Maybe, then, the explanation is altruism, or something else that economics doesn’t account for very well. “It’s a personal thing,” Susan Cherry told me. “We want to be affordable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nApril 8, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nEvery Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:\n\nCongress is back in session after a two-week Easter break, with a bunch of issues that I think, if played correctly, will help President Biden more than Donald Trump in the 2024 race. Why? Most swing voters and independents ultimately prefer leaders who act like adults, not children, and who pursue America’s long-term interests, not short-term partisan politics. That should benefit Biden if he and his team can get swing voters to listen to them and to see Capitol Hill Republicans as focused on silly sideshows rather than serious statesmanship.\n\nHouse Republicans may have to deal with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, just six months after a few conservatives toppled the party’s last speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Many Republicans dismiss Greene’s attempt as an empty threat, but that’s what some people said at first about Representative Matt Gaetz’s efforts to remove McCarthy. Even if Greene stands down this week, she could revive her threat to Johnson (Gaetz gave McCarthy heartburn for months), letting Biden appear to be the adult in D.C.\n\nOn Wednesday the House will send articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate, and Democrats will probably dismiss it quickly, defusing the spectacle. Biden’s team will frame Republicans as more interested in the sideshow, though he will still be vulnerable to any rise in illegal crossings and security chaos at the border this summer.\n\nThe House and Senate will soon have to sort out military assistance to Ukraine and Israel. Biden has positioned himself as a one-man American bulwark for democracy against Vladimir Putin. I think Biden has a more appealing pitch to independents and swing voters as the man who stood with Ukraine than Trump will have as the man who … stood with Putin? I’ve interviewed a lot of independent voters in my five presidential races; all but surrendering Ukraine to Putin is not a winning message with most of them.\n\nAs we pass the six-month mark since Oct. 7, Israel is the big challenge for Biden. Whatever Congress does on military aid to Israel will matter less, I think, than whether Biden pauses, stops or puts conditions on the 2,000-pound bombs, F-15 fighter jets and other munitions that the United States is transferring to Israel.\n\nIn last week’s tipsheet, I asked whether swing voters had stopped listening to Biden. I think more of them will listen to him if Capitol Hill Republicans prove to be, in the words of Logan Roy, “not serious people.”\n\nSpeaking of which: Trump will have his final pre-criminal-trial campaign rally on Saturday night in Schnecksville, Pa., outside Allentown. More on that next Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"
