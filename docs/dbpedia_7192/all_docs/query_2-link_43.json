        "text": "The idea of VCE English assessments can sometimes be a bit daunting. Always so much you want to write, never as much time as you need and they always seem to come around sooner than you think. But there is never as much cause for alarm as you think and Iâm willing to guarantee that almost everyone reading this is so much better than they think at English.Â\n\nYouâve already come so far from where you started in your high school English journey. Iâd like to challenge anyone reading this to go and find the earliest English essay youâve got tucked away somewhere. Iâve done this myself and, if yours is anything like mine, youâll be almost disgusted by what you find. Year-7-me just loved to retell the story, cling to my rigid TEEL formulas and leave my quotes just dangling, write the same basic paragraph three times and call it a complete essay. Not a pretty read and Iâm sure a couple of you can relate. But, this exercise does at least prove a very valuable point: you are capable of improving at English.\n\nSo letâs start thinking about that essay youâve got coming up again. Youâve just given yourself a nice confidence booster with that walk down memory lane, reminding yourself that you are a more-than-capable English student these days. But all you now want to do is your very best for this next essay. But how do you keep improving between now and then? After all, if you knew what you had to do to improve your English, youâd already be doing it, right? So what weâre going to do now is to have a look at what taking your essays to that next level really looks like; how you can improve your writing between now and then, whenever that might be.Â\n\nSo to do this, weâre going to take an already good paragraph and improve it together. Take this one, one that I conveniently prepared earlier to a Station Eleven prompt that has to do with the theme of memory/history.\n\nPart 1: The Good Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating such an enduring legacy for a character who believes in the power of such legacies - 'theyâre all immortal to me' - Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment by preserving these legacies. Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of legacies to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Even though Mirandaâs life is left incomplete by her sudden death, the beauty in the scene of her death suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters: 'its extravagant sunsets and its indigo sea'. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the value of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nLetâs call this our good paragraph. Iâve modelled this off of an essay I found from my Year 10 self, as happy as Year-10-me would have been with this performance, itâs far from perfect. But, it is a very functional paragraph that does all that a paragraph really needs to do. It introduces an idea, justifies it with evidence, links back at the end and doesnât waste too much time retelling the story. So now we get to the fun bit: weâre going to take this already good paragraph, and turn it into a better paragraph.\n\nSo how do we make a good paragraph better?Â\n\nWell, for a start, we can integrate our quotes so that the paragraph reads better. Youâll see in just a second how much of a difference this can make. This is something I learnt to do between Years 10 and 11. Other improvements that could be made include answering the prompt more directly and using some of the language of the prompt within our answers. So letâs change this and see now what these small differences do to our paragraph.\n\nPart 2: The Better Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies that allow others to remember the individuals who came before. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating this symbolic memorial for a character who believes that such legacies can allow individuals such as actors to become 'immortal', Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment through their legacies. Furthermore, Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy through oneâs art to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nThere we have it. The paragraph has been rewritten based on the ones I wrote in Year 11 and we have the first signs of improvement. The topic sentence now references the âremembering the pastâ aspect of the prompt. The linking sentence now uses the âimportanceâ part of the prompt. All of the same quotes are used but are now integrated (check out How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss if you need more help with this).Â\n\nWeâve made sure not to have more than one sentence starting with Mandel (a small nitpick but still a nice addition). It flows better. It answers the prompt more directly and suddenly we have a better paragraph. Year-11-me has shown improvement and with this comes better scores and more confidence: something thatâs very important for success in English. If youâre confident and proud of what youâre writing, then youâll have higher marks and, even better, more fun!\n\nWe havenât changed much and the paragraph is already better. But itâs not my best paragraph. Between Years 11 and 12, I learnt even more things. I was taught to write about not only the world of the text but also the world around us that we and Mandel live in: youâll notice that this better paragraph talks more about âcharactersâ that live âin the textâ whereas my best paragraph would talk more about the text in the context of the world you and I live in. I learnt to make my topic sentences more abstract and broad so that they relate more to our own world and less to the world of the text and remind whoeverâs assessing that my ideas apply to everyone and not just within the texts. I learnt to respond more directly to different types of prompts (Discuss, To what extent is this true?, How does Mandelâ¦ and others) and I learnt to be more direct in discussing the views and values of Mandel (what she likes, what she doesnât like, what she wants to see more of in the world)\n\nSo letâs apply some final changes, and see what our paragraph looks after two more years of refining English. This final paragraph is almost exactly the same as one I wrote in timed conditions before my final exam.\n\nThe Final Part: The Best Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: Mandel explores the importance of legacies, not only as sources of meaning for their creators, but also for their roles in allowing others to remember the roles of those who came before. Such an idea is explored through the naming of Jeevanâs son, securing the legacy of Frank. By affording such a permeating influence to an individual who writes of and appreciates the 'immortal[ity]' of long-dead actors, Mandel implies that an appreciation of the inherent value in a legacy and its ability to influence future events is a key quality in individuals. Furthermore, Mandel uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy that outlives oneself to provide meaning. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, Mandel suggests that the meaning in Mirandaâs life comes from the legacy that is the art she makes in her 'independent' life that continues to influence events and allow others to remember the past long after her death. Mandel provides contrast through her exploration of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, reinforcing Mandelâs view that individuals who forfeit control of their own legacies, as Arthur does, lead far less completed and fulfilled lives. Therefore, Mandel highlights the immense importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past and encourages greater appreciation of the value of legacies in contemporary society.\n\nSo, two years later, and weâve got what is still essentially the same paragraph, just brushed up to an even better, or best, standard. So if weâre using the same evidence, exploring the same characters and introducing the same ideas, why is this paragraph better than the last two?Â\n\nWell, if you study the topic and linking sentences, they discuss the concept of a legacy being a means of allowing others to remember the past and the importance of such a thing and everything in-between links this concept to the text. 'Mandel highlights the immense importance' represents a subtle but nice nod to the wording of the prompt by giving an âextentâ to which Mandel âshowsâ or highlights. Every piece of evidence is discussed in reference to what Mandel believes about the world around us and how individuals should act in modern society.Â\n\nAnd thereâs something very nice that we can now reflect on. This paragraph has gone from good to much better without having to introduce any new ideas. There are no overly complex interpretations of the text, weâve just taken the same skeleton of a paragraph and made it look better without changing its real substance.Â\n\nAnd one of the wonderful things about making efforts to improve the quality of your writing is all the confidence that comes with this, whether this be from getting better at discussing views and values, learning to integrate your quotes or any achievement like this. I know that my confidence surged as my English got better and, as I got more confidence in my writing, I got more confidence in what I wrote about. My interpretations of the text became more and more obscure and a bit whacky at times and I had fun writing about these things. If you improve your writing, youâll improve what youâre writing about which will mean youâll have more fun writing and the cycle of improvement will just continue.Â\n\nSo to cap off, I thought it might be nice to have a checklist of sorts that you might be able to put against your own writing.\n\nWhatâs the next step I could take in improving my English?\n\nAre all my quotes properly integrated? (Hint: if the sentence doesnât make sense without quotation marks, the answer is no)\n\nHave I got more than a couple of sentences starting the same way or could I vary my sentence structure a bit more?\n\nHave I explicitly used some parts of the prompt in my own writing so that I can directly answer the question in my essays?\n\nAm I writing about both the world of the text and the world we live in outside of the text instead of just the characters and relationships within the text?\n\nAre my topic and linking sentences describing a concept that relates to the prompt with everything in-between relating this concept to the text? (I found this a very useful way of thinking of paragraphs)\n\nIs all of my evidence being discussed in relation to the views of the author?\n\nDoes my essay/paragraph explain what the author would like to see more of/less of in modern society based on what is explored in the text?\n\nIs my essay/paragraph specific to the exact wording and type of prompt?\n\nAnd these are just some of the improvements that could be made. Iâm sure each of you could ask teachers and past students and find many, many more tips on improvement. Just as long as youâre thinking about what the next step in your English might be, then youâre already headed in the right direction. So good luck and happy writing!\n\nUpdated on 15/12/2020.\n\nContents\n\nSummary: A Brief Snapshot\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nThemes\n\nSymbolism\n\nStage Directions\n\nEssay Topics\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nResources\n\nExtinction is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Summary: A Brief Snapshot\n\nAt the heart of innovative technology and products lies exceptional human creativity. Our brains are practically wired to create and innovate newness. Naturally, the influx of products enteringÂ the market createsÂ a consumer frenzy. Suddenly, everything is a commodified entity with a dollar-sign attached to it. Its inherent value lies in how much consumers covet the item.Â\n\nLetâs take the iPhone for example! An idea of a communication device - both sleek in its functionality and aesthetic - is mass produced, consumed by millions and the cycle perpetuates itself. It is an item so coveted and desired, a 17-year-old boy from China sold a kidney to buy the iPad and iPhone. This phenomenon of consumerism is symptomatic of a contemporary worldâs obsession with vanity and aesthetic. Our fixation on the surface-level and glossy facades is similarly echoed by Extinctionâs main protagonist, Professor Heather Dixon-Brown, who criticises the âcharismatic fauna pushâ where we are âmaking celebrities out of pandas and polar bearsâ. While those campaigns are successful in raising better awareness and positivity in the realm of conservation, they do not change the ways in which we live and consume.\n\nHow we live today is inflicting a deep ecological impact on planet earth. Furthermore, as urban landscapes inevitably expand, we continue to encroach on the territory of the natural world.\n\nThese are the kind of thoughts that popped into my mind after reading Extinction. Hannie Raysonâs provocative play delves deep into the central question of what it means to uphold a personal conviction in the face of self-interest and necessity. Casual flings, extinguishing of life and the friction between âideological purityâ and functionality threatens to unhinge even seemingly robust characters such as Heather Dixon-Brown, an ecologist who preaches that she âuses her head, not her heartâ. Raysonâs literary work endeavours to capture how the human character is, in fact, multidimensional and never static! As the passionate environmentalists and pragmatic ecologists are entangled in ethical quandaries, the playwright also illustrates how divorcing your mindset from emotion is a universal struggle. Furthermore, she explores how moral conviction is consistently at odds with the demands of the personal and professional domains we inhabit.\n\nThroughout the drama encapsulating mining magnates, environmentalists and ecologists, Rayson combines their fictional voices to echo a cautionary tale of how self-interest and misconception about âthe otherâ may distort rationality. When the CEO of Powerhouse mining, Harry Jewell, bursts into a wildlife rescue centre in Cape Otway, holding a critically injured and endangered tiger quoll, he inadvertently catalyses a conflict that will draw out the prejudices withheld by the trio of environmentalists.\n\nI encourage you to think about the lessons embedded in the play. What are the take-home messages YOU have discovered?\n\nGuiding Questions:\n\nWhat is the message the playwright is attempting to deliver to her audiences?\n\nWhen you finished the play, what feelings were you left with?\n\nWhich characters did you find likeable? Who aggravated you the most? And most importantly, provide evidence for why you felt that way! Was it because of their problematic ways of dealing with an ideological crisis? Or their fierce passion towards upholding moral conviction?\n\n2. Character Analysis\n\nLet's take a look at these deeply flawed human beings:\n\nProfessor Heather Dixon-Brownâ\n\nDirector of the CAPE instituteÂ\n\nInterested in only saving species that are âstatistically saveable'.\n\nBureaucrat with the realism to match.\n\n'I am an ecologist, not an environmentalist. I use my head, not my heart.'\n\n'Species are like commoditiesâ¦I just donât approve of this âcharismatic faunaâ push - making celebrities out of pandas and polar bears.' (p. 99)Â\n\n'You want me to close the CAPE. Is that what you want? Then we can bask in ideological purityâ¦' (p. 120)\n\nThe never-ending struggle between heart and mind is central theme in the play.\n\nHarry Jewell\n\nAn idealist with the knack for alluring women to fall for him.\n\n'You donât serve your cause by being indifferent to the interest of working people.'Â\n\n'I know his type: the kind of greenie whoâs always saying no. No dams. No mines. No roads.' (p. 114)\n\n'I am not some multinational corporation devouring the Amazon. Iâm just a bloke whoâs come back home.' (p. 114)\n\nPiper Rossâ\n\nZoologist from San Diego Zoo (temporarily transferred)Â\n\nAndy Dixonâs girlfriendÂ\n\nGets entangled in a romp with Harry Jewell aka Mr. Evil\n\n'They are all 'worth saving''. (p. 83)\n\nAndy Dixon\n\nA vet who is extremely pragmatic in his mindset towards his work and personal life\n\nSlight aversion to technology\n\nThe inevitability of technology supplanting certain occupationsÂ\n\nTechnological evolution? (Is it the kind of evolution we want?)\n\n'â¦the great advocate for our native flora and faunaâ¦' (p. 118)\n\n'You should see this dairy farm. Itâs all computerised. Theyâve got one bloke managing a thousand cows. No human supervision of the milking. No-one to check the udders. Iâm just there, doing the rounds. Like a robot.' (p. 82)\n\n3. Themes\n\nLogic vs. Emotion (Pragmatism vs. Ideological Purity)\n\nTo divorce your emotions from affecting your decision-making capacity is a universal struggle aptly captured by Raysonâs depiction of Dixon-Brownâs gradual inclination towards the tiger quoll project funded by a coal company. In this case, we can argue that her objectivity and âher headâ is seemingly beguiled by the charms of Harry Jewell.Â\n\nEarly in the play, Professor Dixon-Brown is anchored to her desk, filing applications and paperwork instead of âgetting back to her own researchâ. This prospect changes when Harry - big coal - offers 'two million dollars on the table' to fund the tiger quoll campaign. Nonetheless, we see the two unexpected collaborators setting a dangerous precedent where one can simply equate a speciesâ livelihood to âcommoditiesâ and âa good returnâ of profit.\n\nWhat is compelling about Harryâs character is that he combines both pragmatism and ideological purity. Firstly, Harry has the means and business acuity to manoeuvre a board of directors bent on exploring coal âright on the edge of the national parkâ. However, âMr Evilâ is also inspired by nostalgia and sentimentality over a childhood memory where a tiger quoll steals his drumstick.\n\nConversely, Andy Dixon-Brownâs stance against the mining industry and automated dairy farms is admirable considering how technology has become a central cornerstone of modern-day life. His partner Piper Ross, a zoologist, echoes similar distaste for mining companies, however, her passion for âsavingâ all animals eclipses her own presumptions towards âMr Evilâ. She is eventually persuaded to head the tiger quoll project.\n\nWhereas, Professor Dixon-Brown enjoys the uncomplicatedness of numbers and statistics. However, her carefully crafted algorithm fails to differentiate between the diversity of animals within the ecosphere. Instead, it filters out populations of 5000 and above to collate only the âstatistically saveableâ.\n\nIn this respect, Harryâs actions showcase how a striking a balance between pragmatism and emotion is important.\n\nUnity in a Socially Divisive World\n\nIn this play, the âus vs. themâ mentality pervades the minds of the protagonists. Through the heated dialogue between environmentalists, ecologists and mining moguls, Hannie Rayson delivers the message that as a society we should not be so reliant on simplifying individuals based on age-old presumptions and surface-level characteristics. Harry Jewell echoes a similar sentiment as he discusses his companyâs plans to Piper: 'Whoâs this âweâ? You donât serve your cause by being indifferent to the interests of the working people.' (p. 92)\n\nZooming in: Andy &Â Harry: Let's explore the volatile dynamic between the two males\n\nAndyâs indignant stance against collaborating with the mining industry showcases his resilience in sticking to his moral code. One can argue that his immediate demonisation of Harry Jewell, as evidenced by the nickname âMr. Evilâ, is a symptom of Andyâs oversimplified thinking. It is through Andyâs inflammatory and infantile language towards the Mining CEO that Rayson articulates how the politics of conservation is in shades of grey. Conversely, Harryâs admits that he knew Andy was âthe type of greenie whoâs always saying no [from the moment he came through that door]â. In highlighting the binary oppositions of the two men working in different fields, the play acknowledges how prejudice inhibits potential collaborations.\n\nHarry and Andy showcase how our own misconceptions about âthe otherâ detract from our own moral causes - such as in this case, saving the forest. Both men are committed to the same cause. However, Andyâs antagonistic approach towards Harry undercuts his own integrity as he willingly allows prejudice to cloud his thinking simply because it is the more convenient thing to do, as opposed to collaborating and accommodating each otherâs interests.\n\nCategorising strangers into convenient stereotypes is pure laziness.\n\nAndy: 'Hope he didnât damage that cruise missile heâs got out there?' (p. 73)\n\nHarry: 'I know the type - knew him the moment he came through that door. Heâs the kind of greenie whoâs always saying no. No dams. No mines. No roads.' (p. 114)\n\nRomanticism vs. Reality\n\nAgainst the backdrop of familial arguments and budding romances, Extinctionâs Professor Dixon-Brownâs blunt dialogue about conservation reveals its politicised nature. Her heated dialogue with Piper echoes her frustration at âwriting [Stuart Deckerâs] applications so he can get âa sun tanâ conducting research on The Great Barrier Reef and win accolades for it'. Furthermore, she satirically exclaims that â[the institute] needs to defend its territoryâ. Her mocking of the vice-chancellor who acted like they were in a âWhite House Situation Roomâ implicitly demonstrates her growing disdain towards the tenuous politics of her workplace. Essentially, Heatherâs realist approach exposes what lies beneath the glossy exterior of conservation efforts.\n\nIâve seen quite a few videos of baby pandas circulating on my Facebook feed, most of them are part of a conservation effort or campaign. The comment section of these videos is like a medley of heart-eyes and exclamations of âHow cute!!â This relatively harmless sentiment is dismissed by Professor Dixon-Brown when she states that she is completely disengaged with âcharismatic faunaâ (p. 99) push - making celebrities out of pandas and polar bearsâ. Our overwhelmingly positive reactions towards such campaigns is based on a societal gravitation towards the aesthetically pleasing which bleeds into the next thematic idea revolving around our fixation on appearance (surface-level).\n\nEssentially, in the context of this play, the preferential treatment of endangered animals reflects our own biased thinking.\n\nVanity and Our Obsession With Appearance\n\nThe idea of vanity also pervades the sub-consciousness of both male and female protagonists. Against the backdrop of environmental conservation dilemmas, Hannie Rayson manages to entwine a secondary story strand which captures the insecurities peppering the female experience in this contemporary age. The audience learns that Heather Dixon-Brown spends $267 on hair removal every five weeks. Interestingly, her brother,Â âa screaming heterosexualâ (p. 95), likens the hair removal process to âgetting a tree loppedâ. The destructive and almost violent imagery of chopping down a tree echoes the crippling pressure for Heather to âsculptâ herself into a particular ideal of femininity.\n\nIt is in this way that Rayson articulates a broader thematic idea that womanhood is still being defined in terms of attractiveness and perseveration of youth. Heatherâs internalised insecurities resurface in her heated confrontation with Harry. She accuses him of âprefer[ing] a younger womanâ and having ânever been with a woman with pubic hairâ. Both of which Harry indignantly refutes. Through this heated dialogue, audiences gain an insight into Heatherâs vulnerability as a divorcee-to-be and interestingly, we are exposed to her assertiveness as she questions 'canât [you] stomach a woman who stands up to you?'\n\nHer conflicting ideologies on womanhood are best exemplified through Harry who almost admonishes her for embodying âsome nineteen-fifties idea of relationshipsâ where âsex with someoneâ does not necessarily entail âa lifelong commitmentâ. ThisÂ is also the central conflict faced by all the characters who engage in seemingly non-committal relationships and false expectation. It is through these failed trysts that Rayson disapproves of uninhibited sexual impulses and by extension, criticises the increasing promiscuity in contemporary times. Essentially, Raysonâs fixation on causal sexual relationships mirrors her own opinion that there has been a paradigm shift in how we govern our sexuality and bodies since the 1950s.\n\nConservation in a World of Destruction\n\nYou can define conservation in terms of âpreservation ofâ¦Â â, âsustainingâ¦â.\n\nIn the personal domain, Piper maintains that she and Harry âslept in separate tentsâ to her boss Professor Dixon-Brown who also doubles as her potential sister-in-law. Conversely, Professor Dixon-Brown is forced to make an ethical compromise to prevent a career besmirching orchestrated by a mass-email insinuating a sordid romance between her and her newest collaborator, Harry Jewell. Her reputation as CAPEâs director is nearly tarnished by the vengeful force of a flingâs ex-wife.\n\nDo I preserve my moral compass or my professional reputation?\n\nOther thematic ideas that relate to this umbrella phrase include: misuse of authority and ethics of the digital world.Â\n\nDeleting emails is tantamount to rewording/reworking history. Professor Dixon-Brownâs attempt at salvaging/restoring her pristine moral code of âusing her head, not her heartâ is encapsulated in her desperate dash to the IT servers at 1am in the morning to delete the incriminating email detailing her illicit relationship with Harry Jewell. This, undoubtedly, compromises bothÂ of their careers as professionals. Furthermore, their intimate fling casts Dixon-brown as a seducer/a woman who is easily compromised, which is untrue. However, it is the facades that count in the play.\n\n4. Symbolism\n\nEuthanising the Female Tiger Quoll\n\nIn this case, by virtue of being female, we can assume the tiger quoll âwith a crushed spineâ has reproductive capabilities. The injured tiger quoll was a life-giving entity. Technically, if she recovered fully, the tiger quoll could be the solution to its endangered status.Â\n\nAndyâs swift decision to euthanise the animal in great pain could be in reference to his own desire to âmake [his life] overâ. He has inadvertently projected his own fears and anxieties over his GSS diagnosis onto the critically injured creature. Essentially, in the moment of mutual pain, Andy could resonate with the tiger quoll.Â\n\nOne-Night Stands/Casual Sex/Non-Committed Relationships\n\nMy theory is that the images of casual sex serve as an ironic layer to a play titled Extinction. Both Piper and Heather unwittingly develop sexual relations with Jewell on a casual basis which symbolises how intercourse is no longer purely valued as a means for continuing the species. These âeffortsâ for reproduction are fruitless.Â\n\n1. They show how mankind is centred on pleasure and instant gratification, prioritising the self above all matters.Â\n\n2. They demonstrate how modern living expectations, consumerism and the perpetuation of gluttony have led to a plateau in human evolution.\n\nReal-life Amanda -> Tutor comment translation:\n\nAs I was reading the text, a recurring question kept nagging at me: Why are there intimate scenes sandwiched between the layers of ideological conflict and tension?\n\nTutor -> real-life Amanda translation:\n\nOh my goodness, are these characters THAT sexually frustrated? Someoneâs heart is going to get broken and then we will have to analyse that in our essays. Ughhhhhh.\n\n5. Stage Directions\n\nWeather Transitions\n\n1. The opening scene showcases how vets and environmentalists alike are surprised by the first sighting of a tiger quoll in a decade. Their surprise at this unprecedented occurrence is reinforced by the âwet and windyâ conditions. Typically, stormy weather is symbolic of chaos and unpredictability.Â\n\n2. During a particularly heated exchange between Andy and Piper, the interjection of âthunderâ intensifies rising temperament in both characters. (p. 73)\n\n3. When Andy discovers who âHarry bloody Jewellâ is, his growing disbelief and rising temperament are complemented by the off-stage sound of âthe roar of the motorbikeâ. The audiological stage cue characterises Jewell as an unwanted presence of chaos and noise. As the motorbikeâs roar is a sound incongruent with the natural environment encapsulating Harry.\n\nThe Meaning of Fire\n\nIn Act Two: Scene One, the secretiveness of Harry and Piperâs tryst is underlined by the âvast blacknessâ and their figures âin silhouetteâ. Furthermore, its fragile and tenuous connection is symbolically related to how both counterparts repeatedly âpoke[] the fireâ to ensure its longevity through the night. Perhaps, this imagery is referring to how all temptation and sexual energy need to be moderated, which complements Piperâs reluctance to continue their budding relationship.\n\n6.

Put simply, the book was conceived of journalism and born of a novelist.Â\n\nâ¢ The novel is a product of years of extensive research by Capote and his friend and fellow author Harper Lee, who followed the trails of the Kansas criminals across numerous US states. In Cold Blood revolutionised the American ideals of journalism and literature, blurring the lines between these labels.\n\nâ¢ A notable technique Capote employed in order to access classified information was becoming personally acquainted with the criminals of the case. For example, Capote became extremely close to Perry Smith, one of the main murderers in the case, which gave him exclusive information on the personal motives of the killers.Â\n\nâ¢ In Cold Blood reflects this relationship with the murderer through Capoteâs narration of the book as an objective bystander. On page 23, we see the almost endearing way that Capote describes Perry; âhis voice was both gentle and primâ a voice that, though soft, manufactured each word exactly, ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parsonâs mouth.â As such, Capoteâs friendship with Perry allows him to present the killer to the audience with a certain humanity and empathy, showcasing a broader picture of criminals than just a merciless murderer.\n\nTrue facts of the Case\n\nâ¢ On the 15th of November, 1959, all four members of the small farming Clutter family were brutally murdered, including Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie Clutter and their two teenage children, Nancy and Kenyon.\n\nâ¢ The family was discovered bound and shot in the head. Herbâs throat had also been slashed. After ransacking the entire house, the criminals had left without finding any cash, carrying with them no more than fifty dollars, a pair of binoculars and a transistor radio.\n\nâ¢ Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene âDickâ Hickock were convicted of the crime. The two men had become acquainted during serving time at the Kansas State Penitentiary, and soon confessed to the crime, claiming that that they had heard from another prisoner that Herb Clutter was extremely wealthy, and kept his money in an easy-to-reach safe in his house.\n\nâ¢ After the confession, the two murderers were flown from Nevada to Garden City, where they stood trial for their crimes. On 29 March, 1960, they received a guilty verdict, and were sentenced to the death penalty. For the following five years, Smith and Hickock lived on death row in Leavenworth, Kansas and were executed by hanging on the 14th of April, 1965.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nPerry Edward Smith\n\nOne of the two murderers of the Clutter case, Smith is portrayed as a sensitive and artistic man haunted by his turbulent and lonely childhood. Described by Capote as a man of âactorishâ good looks, he disfigured both of his legs due to a motorcycle accident, which gave him chronic pain and an addiction to aspirin. His criminal actions are often directly linked to his childhood, described as âno bed of roses but pitiful, an ugly and lonely progress toward one mirage and then anotherâ. Smithâs father was extremely abusive towards his wife, Flo Buckskin, and his four children, and so Buckskin later divorced him, taking the children with her. However, on her own she became an alcoholic and died by choking on her own vomit when Smith was only thirteen years old. He was then transferred to a Catholic orphanage, where he suffered from psychological, sexual and physical abuse from the nuns, one of whom attempted to drown him. Smithâs father and two of his siblings committed suicide during his time on death row. Smith eventually befriended Capote through their extensive interviews, and is believed to have shared personal information with him, believing him to be a true friend.\n\nRichard Eugene âDickâ Hickock\n\nThe second murderer of the Clutter case. Having grown up in Kansas, Hickock was a popular football player before turning to a life of crime after realising that he could not afford to go to college. During the course of the Clutter murder investigations, Hickock persistently blamed all of the murders on his partner in crime, Smith, claiming that âPerry Smith killed the Cluttersâ¦. It was Perry. I couldnât stop him. He killed them all.â Capote later states that during the murder, Smith was the one who stopped Hickock from raping the 16-year-old Nancy Clutter, as Hickock harboured pedophilic tendencies.\n\nHerbert Clutter\n\nA well-liked and kind-hearted wheat farmer in Holcomb, Kansas. Proprietor of the large River Valley Farm, Herb is described as a hardworking and valued citizen before his murder, who lead a relatively quiet life other than a troubled marriage with his wife due to her chronic depression.\n\nBonnie Clutter\n\nDescribed as an âanxious womanâ, it is revealed that Bonnie has a history of numerous mental illnesses, one of which is postpartum depression. Capote states that she and Herb had not slept in the same bed for many years.\n\nNancy Clutter\n\nDescribed as the âdarling of the townâ - the class president and future prom queen Nancy was the 16 year old daughter of the Clutters.\n\nKenyon Clutter\n\nAthletic but introverted, Kenyon was the 15 year old son of Herbert and Bonnie Clutter.\n\nAlvin Dewey\n\nA personal friend of the Clutters, Dewey was the primary investigator in the Clutter murder case and worked for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThemes and Motifs\n\nThe American Dream\n\nThe novel is Capoteâs reflection upon the American Dream, as he portrays both the lives of those who epitomise it and those who are tragically out of its reach. Herb Clutterâs position as an upstanding American citizen with a prosperous farm elicits the readerâs interpretation of his character as the rags-to-riches ideal. In stark contrast with this, the rootless and criminal Dick Hancock and Perry Smith are presented as individuals for whom the Dream is perpetually unattainable. Their attempt to finally become ârichâ materialises through their attempt to rob the Cluttersâ home, the failure of which ironically results in their brutal murders of the people who successfully represented the American Dream.\n\nNormality\n\nIn accordance with the American Dream, In Cold Blood also explores the concept of what is considered ânormalâ in America, and what can be revealed as the darker underbelly of its white picket fence ideal. Dick asserts throughout the novel that he is ânormalâ, but from an external, objective perspective, he is clearly far from such; he has distorted physical features and has committed a terrible, vicious murder. Capote also explores the idea of normal mental health, as Bonnie Clutter seems to have the perfect marriage and life with Herb, and yet suffers from extreme bouts of ânervousnessâ and chronic depression which result in her hospitalisation.\n\nEvil\n\nWhat is evil is primarily explored through the character of Perry, who has conflicting ideals about what can be considered truly âevilâ. The more feminine and gentler of the two murderers, Perry possesses conflicting morals, as despite being a ruthless murderer, he does feel remorse and is affected by what he has done. He even thinks to himself that Herb Clutter is a âvery nice gentlemanâ even in the midst of slitting his throat. Capote in the novel reveals that there are numerous facets to the meaning of true âevilâ, and the blurred borders that exist between each of these.\n\nMasculinity\n\nSymbolising the idea of dominance and power, Dick and Perry, who have a complementary and polarised gender relationship, feed off each other in order to boost their own masculinity. Described as âaggressively heterosexualâ, Dick is evidently the more stereotypically masculine counterpart, having had numerous relations with women. Perry, on the other hand, is more feminine and submissive, as Dick often calls him names such as âsugarâ and âhoneyâ. Both men in the novel utilise the other in order to make themselves feel more masculine in their highly restrictive and conservative society â while Dick emphasises Perryâs feminine qualities, Perry admires Dick and craves his words of affirmation that he, too, is masculine.\n\nEssay Writing for In Cold Blood\n\nBelow are some possible prompts for In Cold Blood, and possible ideas to begin writing an essay.\n\nTheme-based Essay Prompt\n\n\"I think it is a hell of a thing that a life has to be taken in this manner. I say this especially because there's a great deal I could have offered society. I certainly think capital punishment is legally and morally wrong.â\n\nIs In Cold Blood merely a novelistic argument against the death penalty? Discuss.\n\nTo learn more about LSGâs Five Types of essay prompts, Iâd highly recommend checking out this blog post. Itâs a super unique strategy developed by the founder of LSG, Lisa Tran. The Five Types method, outlined in the top-rated How To Write A Killer Text Response eBook, takes the stress of students and gives them easy to follow rules and tips so that they know how to approach every essay topic, every time.\n\nâ¢ The best way to approach any essay prompt is to recognise the limiting and/or important words of the essay question. In this thematic prompt these words are: âlegally and morallyâ, and âmerelyâ.\n\nâ¢ Secondly, for prompts which incorporate a quote, it is helpful to understand the context of the quote. In this case, the quote was said by Perry as his last words before his execution by hanging. Consider the importance of this; these words are especially more meaningful as they symbolise the last direct influence he leaves upon society. They are remorseful words of a murderer reproaching the justice system, which begs the question - does Capote position the reader to agree with the murdererâs view?\n\nâ¢ Planning this essay can be structured along three arguments...\n\n1. Capote argues against capital punishment through eliciting pathos for the murderers and portraying them as more than mere monsters.\n\nâ¢ Evidence for this argument could be based mostly on the descriptive elements of Capoteâs writing, or his emotional attachment to the murderers, particularly Perry.\n\nâ¢ Capote paints Perry particularly sympathetically, highlighting his sensitivity as well as his broken and abusive childhood. Quotations from the novel make it clear that his character is romanticised to an extent, such as âIt was a changeling's face, and mirror-guided experiments had taught him how to ring the changes, how to look now ominous, now impish, now soulful; a tilt of the head, a twist of the lips, and the corrupt gypsy became the gentle romantic.â\n\n2. In Cold Blood supports the anti-death penalty argument through its structure and organisation.\n\nâ¢ The epigraph of the novel is a verse of the poem, âBallade des pendusâ by Francois Villon, that he composed whilst on death row in 1463. Villonâs criminal circumstances were strikingly similar with Dick and Perryâs, as he murdered a priest and stole from his strongbox before being arrested and sentenced to death. Despite this, Villon was ultimately charged with a 10 year banishment from Paris, whereas the Clutter family murderers are hanged - a strikingly different outcome. Thus, Capote employs this poetic epigraph to strengthen his argument against the unjust executions of Perry and Dick.\n\nâ¢ In addition to this, the structure of the novel is also used to argue against capital punishment. Although Part One focuses on the lives of both the Clutter family members and Dick and Perry preceding the murder, Part Two skips over the actual murders themselves and recounts the aftermath of its events. This allows Capote to further develop Dick and Perry into real, complex people rather than merely cold blooded murderers; people who do not deserve such a cruel fate. Â\n\n3. However, Capote does ostensibly condemn the cruelty of the murders and presents the opposing argument that capital punishment is not, in fact, âlegally and morally wrongâ.\n\nâ¢ The brutality of the Clutter murders are emphasised through the novel, as Larry Hendricks, who discovers the bodies along with the police, provides the gruesome details of the bodies - âeach tied up and shot in the head, one with a slit throatâ.\n\nâ¢ As Perry later admits to the murder in his extended confession, Dewey highlights the fact that the Clutters âhad sufferedâ due to the âprolonged terror' inflicted by the murderers, and orders them, as such, to be âhanged back to backâ.\n\nâ¢ The argument for capital punishment in In Cold Blood is also supported by religious beliefs. As a small and predominantly Christian town, Kansas and its residents can be perceived interpreting the words of the Bible literally; at the end Dick and Perryâs trial, the prosecuting attorney Logan Green reads an excerpt from Genesis in the Holy Bible: âWhoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.â Rejecting the notion that Christianity preaches forgiveness, Green strives to punish the killers for failing to abide by the laws and prophecies of the Old Testament.\n\nCharacter essay prompt\n\nPerry Smith, despite Capoteâs authorial sympathy towards him, is really a cold and merciless monster. Discuss.\n\nWhen approaching character-based prompts, you must depart slightly from examining the holistic messages of the author, as you would in a theme-based prompt, but rather analyse how the specific character develops this authorial message. The above essay question could be brainstormed in the following way:\n\n1. Capoteâs description of Perry shows that he is far from a âmonsterâ, but a human being of great sensitivity and emotion.\n\nâ¢ During his confession of the Clutter murders, Perryâs comment, âThere's got to be something wrong with somebody who'd do a thing like that,â shows that he, to some extent, understands the gravity of his actions and regrets them.\n\nâ¢ Perry is also described by his sister as âgentleâ, and someone who âused to cry because he thought the sunset was so beautifulâ. Likewise, even in moments of cruelty, he often shows mercy and a wide moral compass, even stopping Dick from raping Nancy Clutter during their murder spree.\n\n2. Perry is also depicted as someone âweakenedâ by the tragic events of his past and his own insecurities, rather than an inherently âcold and mercilessâ person.\n\nâ¢ Capote often links Perryâs violent tendencies with his childhood, described as âno bed of roses but pitiful, an ugly and lonely progress toward one mirage and then anotherâ, as he was raised âwith no rule or discipline, or anyone to show [him] right from wrongâ.\n\nâ¢ In addition to this, Perry can be perceived to be the more insecure and submissive of the two killers, as while Dick often calls him stereotypically feminine names such as âsugarâ and honeyâ, Perry admires his âaggressiveâ masculinity and craves his words of affirmation in order to feel as masculine and strong as his counterpart.\n\n3. Despite this, Capote does not entirely erase the murderous aspects of Perryâs character.\n\nâ¢ Due to the prompt and seemingly nonchalant way in which he kills the clutters, Dick becomes convinced that Perry is that rarity of a person,\"a natural killer.â\n\nâ¢ Thus, Capote, despite his empathetic portrayal of Perry, never allows the reader to forget the Â extent of his criminality, and how easily he was able to fire those âfour shotgun blasts that, all told, ended six human lives.â\n\nThe White Girl is usually studied under the Text Response component of the Australian curriculum. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nIn The White Girl, author Tony Birch introduces a new generation of young readers to the lived experiences of countless Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australiaâs racist and colonial history. The novel (which documents the perils, hardships and injustices of life for Aboriginal people in the 1960s) champions the values of pride, resistance, compassion and love, all while condemning the legacy of systemic oppression and subjugation which continue to stain Australiaâs national identity to this day.\n\nTo better understand the key ideas at the heart of the text, weâll be breaking down the historical and cultural context surrounding the novel and introducing some of its more tricky concepts.Â\n\nContents\n\nInstitutional Racism and Oppression - What Is It?\n\nColonisation and Dispossession\n\nForced Removals and The Stolen Generation\n\nLaw and Justice\n\nInstitutional Racism and Oppression - What Is It?Â\n\nVirtually every conflict that the protagonists of The White Girl confront is in some way or another a manifestation of the pervasive racism which underlies Australian history. At its core, the novel is a response to an enduring legacy of racial inequality and the resultant trauma that Aboriginal people continue to suffer.\n\nThere are certainly many instances throughout the novel where characters demonstrate overt acts of what is often called individual or interpersonal racism. This is what students often imagine when they hear the word racism, and it refers to individual interactions in which one person might harass, abuse or intimidate others based on their race. You might remember, for example, the school children who paint Henry Lambâs face black while shouting racial slurs, or Bill Sheaâs sister who throws stones at Odette. However, this isnât the only kind of racism that exists, and for the most part, itâs not the main focus of The White Girl. Beyond just individual acts, Birch directs us to consider a more insidious, wide-scale and deeply embedded type of discrimination: that is, institutional or systemic racism. In an article for the National Indigenous Television Channel at SBS, Indigenous journalist Bronte Charles defines the term as follows:Â\n\nInstitutional racism, also known as systemic racism, describes the existence of racism in the structures that make up modern society. It manifests when institutions, organisations and governments directly or indirectly discriminate against an ethnic group. It systematically disadvantages those groups and further marginalises them within society.Â\n\nIn speaking to contemporary readers, it is clear that Birch wants us to redefine our understanding of racism beyond the bounds of individual beliefs and actions, and instead consider the ways in which societal and cultural systems of authority systematically oppress people based on their race, leading to far more devastating and long-lasting impacts. In The White Girl, these authorities can be seen in the federal government, the Aborigines Welfare Board, the police and the Church - all of whom represent either a direct threat to Odette and Sissyâs continued happiness or play some role in the broader historic injustices perpetrated against Aboriginal Australians. Systemic racism and its effects play out in several significant ways throughout the text, some of which we will explore below.Â\n\nBut first, some context: how did we get here in the first place?\n\nColonisation and DispossessionÂ in The White Girl\n\nAs you might have learned in History class, Australia was first invaded by British settlers in 1788, beginning a long history in which the invaders captured and occupied Aboriginal lands to establish colonies, appropriated natural resources and killed many Indigenous peoples, either directly or indirectly (for example, through the introduction of new diseases). This process was justified by the racist assumption that Aboriginal people and their culture were inferior to the British, therefore permitting the British to do what they wished without consequence. Today, we refer to the process by which these colonists seized control as colonisation and use the word dispossession to refer to the fact that Aboriginal people had their lands systematically stolen from them.\n\nAs with all modern Australian history, the events of The White Girl play out in the wake of these brutal processes, and their effects can be felt throughout. As early as the first page of the novel, Birch establishes that even in the 1960s, the legacies of colonisation and dispossession continue in and around Deane, fundamentally shaping the environment in which Odette and Sissy have lived their entire lives. For example, letâs consider the following quote:\n\n[Odette] watched as the kite hovered above Deaneâs Line, a narrow red dirt track skirting the western boundary of town. The Line, as the track was commonly known, had been named in honour of the early squatter and land speculator, Eli Deane. Deane carried the blood of so many Aboriginal people on his hands it could never be scrubbed away, not from the man himself or the town that carried his name. The Line had been drawn a century earlier to separate the Aboriginal people incarcerated on the nearby mission from the good white settlers of Deane. A government regulation deemed that any Aboriginal person living west of Deaneâs Line was a resident on an Aboriginal reserve. (p. 1)\n\nThis quote immediately illustrates the deep and fundamental chasm which separates (in this case, literally) the lives and experiences of Aboriginal and white Australians, both in terms of their rights and treatment by the government, and how they are framed in the public consciousness. Not only do the white residents of the area possess freedoms that their Aboriginal neighbours are denied, but they are also viewed as deserving of this unjust privilege. Notice Birchâs use of sarcasm, as he refers with italics (formatted in bold on this blog) to the âgood white settlersâ of the area. We know from this passage that Deane was âsettledâ through violence and the unjust incarceration of the local indigenous people and yet, as becomes clear throughout the novel, these injustices are rarely acknowledged or condemned. Instead, again and again, the violence and subjugation exacted by white perpetrators and institutions of authority against Aboriginal people is normalised, excused and sanctioned. This is echoed in the words âgood white settlersâ, which satirise the way that many people in power have historically utilised language to minimise the violent harm that these same âsettlersâ committed.\n\nThe various inequalities referred to in this passage are examples of both systemic racism in action and continuations of the same racist beliefs that justified Australiaâs colonisation. In fact, Deane itself, with its legacy of violence and inequality, can be considered a symbol of this same deeply rooted racism throughout the country. Just as Deane is marked by the stains of its foundersâ violence, the various systems of authority and control which Odette and Sissy must navigate throughout the novel (most notably, the police and the welfare system) have also been built upon racist ideology; they, too, have blood on their hands.Â\n\nThe White Girl also considers the impact of land dispossession from an Aboriginal perspective, as in the quote below, where Odette reflects on the loss of the native lands around Deane.\n\n[â¦] Sissy stopped to look down at the riverbed. âI wish there was water in this river, Nanna,â she said. âWhen the weather is warm I could swim the same as you used to do in the old days.â\n\nâOh, I wish you could too. That water here was once the clearest you would ever see,â Odette lamented. âThe fish and eels would be swimming with us. The old people, they knew the river and its stories from the time it had run free. All along this way the water overflowed into the old billabongs. Now all we have is the muddy bottom and the frogs,â Odette said. âThereâs hardly a drop of water left for them.â\n\nâWhat happened to all the water?â Sissy asked. âTell me that story.â\n\nâThereâs not much to tell. White people got even greedier than we thought possible. Thatâs what happened.â Over the years Odette had witnessed local government officials seizing more and more land and then filling in old billabongs and covering the muddy ground with screening from the mine before selling off the land.\n\nâBetween the farmers and the politicians we were left with nothing. Our people have been hurting since, [â¦] Because the river, all the rivers, we need them. And they need us.[â¦]â (pp. 51-52)\n\nBirch suggests that the harm that colonisation has wrought on both the land and First Nations people is inherently intertwined, drawing a link between land dispossession and widespread trauma. For Aboriginal Australians, connection to Country is deeply cultural, spiritual and personal, and this quote reflects both how this connection once flourished in âthe old daysâ and how its forced severance has left great scars on Odetteâs people and the land itself. Without the wisdom and respect of its traditional caretakers, the land has starved and wasted away under the greed of the white authorities. This decay mirrors the suffering and trauma of Indigenous peoples, who have been similarly controlled, brutalised and commodified under colonialism.Â\n\nNow that weâve considered the background behind the novel, letâs take a look at some of the main forms of institutional racism it tackles within its pages.Â Â\n\nForced Removals and The Stolen Generation in The White Girl\n\nBy far the biggest source of tension throughout the text is the ever-present threat of Sissyâs forced removal from Odette. From the mid-1800s to the 1970s, both federal and state governments forcibly removed thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and communities, resulting in what we now call the Stolen Generation. It is estimated today that during this time, between one in ten and one in three Aboriginal children were stolen. In particular, mixed-race children like Sissy who had some white ancestry, often referred to as âhalf-castesâ, were disproportionately targeted and often placed in white families where it was hoped that they might be assimilated into white society. These removals were predicated on racist assumptions and beliefs about the supposed superiority of white society and culture and further marginalised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across the country.Â\n\nThis process was naturally deeply traumatising to all affected, and its effects still live on to this day. Child victims of the Stolen Generation were culturally dispossessed, losing connection to not only their families and communities but also to Country and their culture, spirituality, language and identity. This has resulted in a long legacy of alienation and isolation for not just the stolen children, but their descendants, many of whom deal with intergenerational trauma as a result of the policies. The families and relatives of the stolen children also experienced significant trauma at the loss of their loved ones, with many never recovering after their children were taken. Overall, the effects of these policies have touched virtually every Aboriginal Australian, leaving an indelible scar. Birch himself is quoted as saying, âIâve never met an Aboriginal person who doesnât have a story of that sort of loss [through the stolen generations] somewhere in their family. No Aboriginal person I know is completely intact because of thatâ¦Everyone is missing someone, and someone in that family has got to carry that repository of memory.â (Daley, 2019).Â\n\nIndeed, in The White Girl, the impacts of the Stolen Generation are visible around every corner, and the threat of Sissyâs removal drives the central narrative. In the course of Odette and Sissyâs journey, Birch presents us with various victims of the policy, all of whom display the scars of their ordeal.Â\n\nOne example of such a character is Delores Reed, the mother whom Odette meets at a church in Gatlin. Deloresâ two daughters are stolen from her and placed first in a church in Gatlin, and then in white families. Their removal causes their mother significant psychological distress, leading her first to a period of hospitalisation and later to suicide, as we can see in the following quotes.Â\n\nOdette observed Delores gripping the edge of the table with both hands, her eyes sharp and her cheeks reddening.\n\nâThe first time the Welfare lady set eyes on my babies,â Delores said, âI knew I had no hope of keeping them.â She took one hand away from the edge of the table and slammed it against her chest, alarming Odette. âFrom that day on, that bitch followed us around like a bloodhound. My eldest girl, Colleen, she was the first to go. [â¦]â (p. 80)\n\nâ[â¦] After Iris was taken away I was put into one of those hospitals. You know? For sick people? And by then I was mad.â Delores had exhausted herself. She could hardly look at Odette. (pp. 81-82)\n\nâThe church authorities, about eight years ago, they decided to move a group of the girls away, including Mrs Reedâs daughters.â [â¦] âShe wasnât told what had happened to them until after theyâd gone. It was more than a week after when the priest came to her. It was too late by then. There was nothing she could do.â\n\nâTaken? Where to?â Odette asked.\n\nâTo the city. A long way to travel for a woman without means.â [â¦] âShe lay in the room there for days on end, unable to move. It broke her, what they did to her.â\n\nOdette dreaded her next question, but had to ask. âWhat happened to Delores?â\n\nRobert looked up to the sturdy limb above his head. âDelores took her own life.â (p. 85)\n\nAlong with other characters like Wanda and Jimmy Brown, Delores demonstrates the human cost of systemic racism, representing the untold damage that the Stolen Generation wreaked upon countless Aboriginal families. In many ways, she is also a narrative foil to Odette, representing what could befall her if Sissy were to be successfully taken by the authorities.Â\n\nSpeaking of authority, â¦\n\nLaw and JusticeÂ in The White Girl\n\nThroughout the novel, Birch makes it clear that in 1960s Australia, the law and legal system were designed to marginalise and control Aboriginal Australians while upholding the pre-existing systems of power that benefit white citizens. In other words, law and justice - and the authorities who enforce them - represent institutional racism over order and protection.Â\n\nThe White Girl demonstrates that the law denies even basic rights and freedoms on the basis of race: not only are Aboriginal Australians not considered citizens, but under the Aborigines Protection Act, they are unable to move freely from place to place and are denied legal custody of their children. Instead, this custody is afforded to the Aborigines Welfare Board and to guardians like Sargeant Lowe, who could at any time threaten to remove children from their families without consent. To even be considered for an exemption from these rules, Aboriginal residents must in some ways give up even more of their freedoms and subject themselves to often humiliating and degrading conditions, as we can see in the following conversation between Jack and Odette:Â\n\nâ[â¦] This is a certificate of exemption. It means that I can go anywhere I like, when I like. Even across the border. With some rules, of course,â he offered as a cautionary note.\n\n[â¦]\n\nJack listed the orders he was subject to, counting on his fingers as he went.Â\n\nâTo start with, to get the certificate I needed to provide testimonials to the Welfare Board from reputable people. White people. I can live where I want and I can have a drink,â he added, winking at the smiling Sissy. âBut I canât give grog to a blackfella. Thatâs rule number one, just about. And ...â Jack hesitated and looked at Sissy.\n\nâAnd what?â Odette prompted him.\n\nââAnd ... I canât fraternise with Aboriginal people,â he said, lowering his voice. âUnlawful association, they call it.â He looked away, unable to hide his sudden shame. (p. 138)\n\nAlthough an exemption from the Act ultimately helps Odette save Sissy, the exchange above demonstrates that even this exemption is built upon certain restrictions which function to further dispossess and disconnect Aboriginal people from their communities and identities. In a fundamentally unjust and unequal society, the law punishes marginalised people, even when it claims to help them.Â\n\nThe police are another clear example of this point throughout the novel. Both Sargeant Lowe and Bill Shea demonstrate the policeâs systemic failure to protect and serve Aboriginal Australians, either through active persecution or neglect. Although Lowe is the far more obvious antagonist of the two, Birch is careful to demonstrate that the threat he poses is representative of a far larger systemic issue in wider society. As the following quotes indicate, it is his steadfast commitment to doing his job properly that makes him so dangerous:Â\n\nHeâd been in Deane for only a week, and with little to distract him heâd had time to examine the information on each Aboriginal person under his control, young and old. The station records revealed that in the decades following the townâs foundation, the blacks had been kept on a tight rein. The log book for the police cells indicated that a week rarely passed without an inmate from the nearby mission being locked up, from a period of twelve hours to several weeks, and for matters including trespassing, drunkenness, absconding and co-habitation with those of a superior caste.\n\nLowe also noted that in recent years the cells had rarely been used, and punishment more generally was almost non-existent. He had little idea of how Officer Shea spent his working day, but he was clearly not concerned with policing. Lowe was determined to bring about change. He would begin with auditing each of the Aboriginal children under his guardianship, with a view to deciding the best outcome for their future welfare. (p. 28)\n\nLowe straightened his back. âAs the representative of the state, and as there is no longer a Justice of the Peace serving this district, all Aboriginal children come under my direct care. I am their guardian. It would be negligent of me to allow the child to travel outside the district.â He leaned across the desk. âIâve been meaning to talk to you about the ongoing welfare of the child. In fact, I will be speaking with all remaining coloured people under my control.â Lowe glanced across at Bill Shea. âThe whole business of native welfare has been neglected in this district for many years. I will not allow it to continue. Your people need certainty, just as we do, as officers of the Crown. (p. 104)\n\nAlthough Odette, Sissy and the other Indigenous characters face hardship and adversity in many forms, ultimately the most consistent barriers to their freedom, self-determination and happiness are the very culture, systems and institutions of control in which they find themselves embedded. Through their stories, Birch paints a powerful picture of the harm that colonisation and continued widespread systemic racism have wreaked upon Aboriginal Australians and illustrates the importance of challenging systems that uphold inequality and marginalisation, even today.Â\n\nFurther Reading for The White Girl\n\nIf youâd like to read more about some of the topics discussed in this blog, here are some of the resources I referenced and/or used to deepen my own understanding of the text:\n\nBringing them home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families.Â\n\nInstitutional racism is at work in Australia. How does it affect Indigenous People?\n\nâTony Birch on The White Girl: âNo Aboriginal person I know is intactâ\n\nHow Do I Do Well if I HATE the English Texts That I Am Studying?\n\nI know that exact feeling; the feeling of giving up before it has even started. Some lucky students fall in love at first sight with their texts while some unfortunate students dread having to spend a whole year analysing their texts. If you resonate with the latter, you have probably already given up on English, or maybe youâre trying your best to stay optimistic. English is hard, but what makes it harder is when you know you hate the texts that you are studying, so how can I do well in English if I hate the texts that I have to study? Whether you hate reading and analysing texts or you just hate the specific text that you have to study, here is a guide on how to make studying and reading your texts more enjoyable!\n\nReading Texts\n\nWeâve all said it before, âIâll just read it laterâ or âIâll read it right before school startsâ and in the end, it all leads to the same conclusion of us never actually reading the text and by the time our SACs roll around, we âstudyâ by reading summaries of our texts and try memorising the most popular quotes.Â\n\nDo I Really Have To Read the Text?\n\nThe bad news is yes, it is highly recommended that you read your texts! (I know it can be tempting to just read chapter summaries but trust me, I have tried writing an essay without reading the text and it went very badly). However, the good news is using LSGâs ideal approach to your English texts, you may only need to read your texts a minimum of three times. In fact, if you make use of your first reading, you probably wonât have to personally read the text again! During this first reading, take your time, donât try to binge read the entire text in a night as there is a high chance that you will not be following the plot and youâre just reading for the sake of finishing the text. Thereâs no need to start annotating the text during this first reading as you will most likely have a collective second reading in class where your teacher will go over the whole text in more detail by highlighting significant sections of your text. This first reading is simply for you to familiarise yourself with the text and what you will be handling during the year. However, if you still have trouble understanding your texts, LSG has a plethora of resources such as free text-specific blogs and affordable text guides that you can check out!\n\nHow Do I Find the Motivation To Read My Texts?\n\nSome common reasons why we might procrastinate reading our texts are the sheer volume of pages we need to read; having a short attention span and; being a more visual learner. If this is the case, there are many ways to increase your motivation to read or watch your texts!\n\nIf the text is a play (e.g. The Crucible by Arthur Miller), watch the play while reading the script. Not only will this help you understand the stage directions in the script, but it can also help with understanding the plot if you are a more visual learner.Â\n\nIf the text has a film adaptation (e.g. In Cold Blood by Truman Capote or The Dressmaker by Rosalie Ham), watch the film adaptation first! Knowing major plot twists and spoilers can make reading your text feel faster as you already know what is going to happen. Watching film adaptations can also help allow you to picture the plot easily and help immerse yourself into the setting and the world of the text (however, do take care when doing this as you are only analysing the text you have been allocated, not the adaptations!)\n\nIf the text is a film (e.g. Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock), try to find a trailer of the film or find short clips from the film rather than watching the entire movie in one sitting; watching these cuts and suspenseful scenes may spark your curiosity which is likely to increase your interest towards wanting to watch the movie. Scheduling a movie night with friends and family is also a great way to make watching the film more fun.Â\n\nIf the text is a collection of poems (e.g. William Wordsworth Poems selected by Seamus Heaney by William Wordsworth), listen to the poem while reading the poem. Not only will this help you to embody the poetâs mind, but it can also help you recognise the rhyming schemes and rhythm patterns that may not be noticeable at first glance.\n\nCheck out How To Recharge Your Motivation Over the School Holidays for more tips!!\n\nHow Do I Make Reading My Texts More Enjoyable?\n\nCreate goals: Space it out, we do not want to get burnt out! Organise goals and do not attempt to read the book all within a night! For example, you could aim to read one chapter a day. Not only will this hold you accountable, but it will also make reading less daunting and overwhelming.\n\nRewards: Who doesnât love rewards? Reward yourself after reaching your reading goals, this could be as simple as taking a break after reading or reading a book that you like.Â\n\nAudiobooks: When you donât feel like physically reading, download audiobooks of your texts and listen to them while youâre commuting or while youâre doing your chores.\n\nEnvironment: Create the perfect reading atmosphere! This is quite subjective, however, if youâre struggling to find this niche, here is a step-by-step guide to âromanticiseâ reading:\n\nPut your devices away! If youâre opting to read an ebook, you can also turn your notifications off. We do not want to be distracted and procrastinate!\n\nFind a comfortable place to sit with good lighting.\n\nIf youâre in the mood for a sensory experience, light a scented candle or make your favourite beverage to sip along while you are reading.Â\n\nIf it helps, you can pretend that youâre reading at an aesthetic library, or your favourite cafÃ©, or a serene parkâ¦the options are endless.Â\n\nStudying Texts\n\nIt can be even harder to find the motivation to study for the texts that you hate as youâre probably looking for ways to limit the amount of physical contact you make with the text or ways to save time and study less for English but still do well in the subject.\n\nHow Do I Save Time When Reviewing and Writing Notes on My Texts?\n\nTip 1: Write Notes Based on Themes, Writing Style & Characters Instead of ChronologicallyÂ\n\nOften, students will take notes chronologically based on each chapter, however, this is not helpful at all. In your SACs and exam, you will not be writing paragraphs based on each chapter, instead, you will likely be given one of the five types of essay prompts that require an in-depth understanding of the themes, writing style (such as symbols and motifs) and characters of the text. Therefore, I recommend writing down notes and quotes based on themes, specific writing techniques and characters.Â\n\nFor example, before class, you could create a separate notes page on each prominent theme of the text. When your teacher highlights significant sections of the text, you could then write down these notes into the relative theme document. For comparative texts, you can also create a comparison table based on overlapping themes which will allow you to view the comparisons more easily. If youâre a visual learner, colour coding your notes according to different themes or characters can make it easier to find later on when reviewing your notes. If you do this from the start, you will spend less time re-reading the text and organising your notes which will hopefully reduce the amount of time you spend studying.Â\n\nTip 2: Write Down Page Numbers Next to Quotes and Notes\n\nNo, you do not have to memorise page numbers for your final exam or SACs, however, writing down page numbers will help you save time when reviewing your notes as you can just flip over to the page rather than having to re-read the text to find the specific quote or notes. It may seem rather annoying having to write down the page numbers all the time, however, your future self will thank you!\n\nHow Can I Find the Motivation To Write on the Text That I Hate?\n\nTip 1: Find Out What You Hate and Like About the Text\n\nWe all experience writerâs block, especially when we have no passion for the text we are studying. However, assuming you have read the text, you would probably have unique opinions on the text. Firstly, find out what you hate about the text.Â\n\nDo you hate a specific character in the text? Why do you hate this character?\n\nDo you hate the writing style? What is it about the writing style that you hate?\n\nIs there a specific theme you felt the text did not address properly?\n\nWas there a specific scene or part of the text that frustrated you?\n\nOnce you find out what you hate about the text, find an essay prompt related to the topic you hate and practice writing an essay about it! Use this as a chance to lowkey rant, discuss or debate about the topic. Not only will this help you develop your inner author voice, but it will also provide you with inspiration to write. On the other hand, you can also find out what you like about the text (hopefully, you donât hate everything about the text) and practice writing on a topic related to this. For example, I hated studying The Crucible due to the portrayal of women in the text. However, when analysing the text, I realised that the portrayal of women in the text was simply a reflection of the conservative and insular society of Salem which became a theme that I liked discussing.Â\n\nTip 2: Put the Text in Context\n\nKeep in mind that the texts that you have been allocated all have a specific aim and purpose such as serving political commentary about a significant historical event, critiquing a specific characteristic of conservative communities or simply a discussion about human nature. Throughout the text, there will be many literary techniques, characters and events that will be used to bring these significant themes to life. Therefore, regardless of whether you like the plot of the text or not, the themes that you will be studying may be more of interest to you. If this is the case, researching the background and the world of the text may help you gain a deeper understanding of these themes which is likely to increase your motivation to write as you will be able to apply your knowledge about the text such as quotes, characters and events to these themes.Â\n\nTip 3: Utilise Your Strengths\n\nBy focusing on your strengths, you are likely to increase your confidence and consequently, your motivation to write! Therefore, if you are an expert at analysing literary techniques, or if you have mastered writing about characters, use these strengths when you are writing. Not only will playing at your strengths make writing less difficult, it may also help overshadow your weaknesses.Â\n\nOverall, whether writing essays is your strong suit or not, LSG has many general essay writing tips (for example, check out this guide on essay planning).

Endure the pain now and you'll be finished before you know it!\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you, like me, grew up Asian in Australia, you might think you already know a thing or two about, well, growing up Asian in Australia. Our stories can be pretty similarâjust have a scroll through the âsubtle asian traitsâ Facebook group, or have a conversation with literally any Asian Australian about their parents.\n\nAt the same time, itâs also important to recognise that everyoneâs experiences are diverse, especially given how broad an identity âAsianâ can be. Also important is to recognise how broad and intersectional identity can be in generalâintersectional meaning that race isnât the only thing that defines any one of us. Things like gender, socio-economic status, ability, sexual orientation and religion can also be really central, for example. Each of these things can impact the way we navigate the world.\n\nCovering a broad range of these stories is Alice Pungâs anthology, Growing Up Asian In Australia. Some of the contributors in this volume include Sunil Badami, Matt Huynh, Bon-Wai Chou, Diana Nguyen, Michelle and Benjamin Law, and Shaun Tan, and already this cross-section is fairly diverse in nature. You can also click on their names to find out a bit more about each of their work. I think this is worth a few minutes, just to get acquainted with the sheer range of Asian-Australian creatives who are represented in this book, and to locate their work within the themes they write aboutâin other words, having a think about the ways that cultural heritage, or experiences with family, or economic hardship permeate their work, both in the anthology and in their lives outside it.\n\nThe anthology is (perhaps quite helpfully) divided into sections which revolve around key themes, which is also going to inform the structure of this guide. Iâll be using this guide to go through an exercise that I found really helpful when learning the text, which involves:\n\ntaking two stories per section and drawing up some dot-point similarities and differences\n\ntranslating two of those points into paragraphs, a bit like a âmini-essayâ\n\nWeâll go through some an example of what this might look like, and why itâs a helpful exercise to try.\n\nBefore we start diving into Growing Up Asian in Australia, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nStrine (Badami & Tseng)\n\nStrine is whatâs called a syncope, a shortened way of pronouncing Australian (a bit like âStrayaâ)âit refers to Australian English as itâs spoken by locals. This section of the book is all about language, and about the difficulties of juggling two languages growing up, and Badami and Tsengâs stories are great examples of this.\n\n1. Similarity: connections to oneâs mother tongue fade over time. Tseng recounts how, one by one, she and her sisters stopped learning Chinese as they progressed through their Australian education. Badami on the other hand compromises his name which stood out as too Indian when he âjust wanted to fit in.â\n\n2. Similarity: for âthird-culture kidsâ, losing knowledge of their language also strains their relationship with their forebears. Badamiâs mother is shocked to hear the anglicisation of his name despite the significance it carrie for her (âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringyâ), and Tseng describes the experience of communicating with her father in âChinglishâ so that they can both understand each other.\n\n3. Difference: language can be an internalised, personal experience, or a highly exposed and interpersonal one. While Tseng feels her loss of her language as a âsense of shame, a vague uneaseâ, Badami is almost bullied into changing his name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â\n\nThe Clan (Law & Chau)\n\nThis section delves into the complex ties that hold migrant families together. Chauâs poems are starkly different to Lawâs story, so itâll be interesting to compare how these different narrative forms work to explore those ideas.\n\n1. Similarity: it can take at least one generation for migrant families to dig their roots into their new home. While Lawâs parents are proud tourists at Queensland theme parks, he and his siblings âgroanâ at their comportment. Chauâs poem âThe Firstbornâ traces his ancestry forward until he arrived, âan ABCâ and his son âby amniotic seaâ, both of them born into Australia.\n\n2. Similarity: family dynamics are still traditional and therefore gendered. Law notes how his motherâs health suffered when divorcing his father, and Chau notes that the women members of his family were âcast offâ the family tree âas if they were never born.\n\n3. Difference: family history and heritage can vary in importance. Chauâs family traces back âtwenty-eight generationsâ of history, whereas Lawâs family very much lives in the present, the only tie to older generations being his âMa-Maâ, or grandma.\n\n4. Difference: families show their love in different ways. Whether itâs dedicating a poem to his son about his life as one of âten thousand riversâ of Chinese diaspora into the Australian sea, or taking the kids to theme parks on weekends, all sorts of affection can hold families together.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo Iâve tried to choose two sections (and four stories) that are all a bit different to try and mix it up and get some rich comparative discussion out of these. You might be studying this text alone, but even as one text, remember that thereâs a lot of diverse experiences being represented in it, so discussing how stories connect, compare and contrast is just as important as discussing the content of individual stories themselves.\n\nIf we do a mini-essay, we might as well go about it properly and pick some sort of contention. Without a fixed prompt though, it might be easier to start with those dot points and pick which ones we want to write out and string together. Letâs pick twoâconnections to mother tongue fading over time (Strine similarity 1) and digging roots into Australia over time (The Clan similarity 1). A contention covering these points might look like:\n\nWhile second generation migrants may struggle with loss of culture, they also constitute a unique and significant part of the diaspora.\n\nAn example\n\nMany migrants lose connections to their heritage over time, and these connections are often in the form of language. Particularly for Asian migrants, there is not as strong a need to preserve their mother tongue in the English-speaking Australia, and as such their knowledge of those languages can be easily lost. Ivy Tseng, for instance, recalls how she was never able to âgrasp the significanceâ of learning Chinese as a child, and eventually she and her sisters would prioritise âstudyâ and other academic pursuits over learning Chinese. Because tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language. These compromises can come from other factors as well, particularly the group dynamics of being in white-dominated Australia. Bullying is a frequent culprit, and Badami for example is indeed peer-pressured into resentingâand ultimately anglicisingâhis name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â More generally speaking, a sense of shame for oneâs difference is a common part of the migrant experienceâLaw experiences it as well at theme parks, where he and his siblings attempt to âset [them]selves apartâ from the faux-pas of their parents. Not always an intentional goal, but a general willingness to compromise connections to heritage underscores many Asian Australian migrant stories, particularly of second-generation migrants.\n\nHowever, the extent to which migrants feel socially integrated in society shifts generationally and over time as well. Second generation migrants are thus unique in that they have the closest connection to their heritage while also initiating this process of integration. Law and his siblings exemplify this, with their âAustralian accentsâ and âproper grammar and syntax.â While some loss of their native Cantonese takes place, they are also the first in their family to sound Australian, one step closer to being Australian. They constitute part of the distinct, third culture of âABCââAustralian-born Chineseâto which Chau alludes in his poem, âThe Firstbornâ. Distinct from first-generation migrants, ABCs are a product of diaspora and spend their formative years immersed in the Australian way of life. Chauâs poem goes on to highlight how sizeable this demographic now isââthe sea is awash with the unfathomable Chinese sons.â Thus, we can see how ABCs, or second generation Asian migrants, represent a unique and significant social group exemplified by great compromise, but also great change.\n\nWhy is this useful?/How can I apply this?\n\nI like this exercise because it gets you thinking creatively about the key implications of the stories. Within a section or theme, you want to identify similarities in how both stories contribute to our understanding of that theme. You also want to identify differences to explore how stories can be unique and nuanced, which will provide your essay with more depth when you ultimately need it. Then, putting it all together helps you synthesise new connections between themes.\n\nFor an analytical study of this text, youâd flesh out those ideas until they become paragraphs, introducing relevant evidence and mixing it up with explanatory sentences as you go. Explanatory sentences keep you analysing rather than story-telling, and they usually donât have any quotesâan example from above might be âbecause tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language.â\n\nFor a creative study, youâd take away those ideas and look at how else you might explore them in other stories. Feel free to challenge yourself for this; I remember falling back on more personal writing when studying this creatively, but donât neglect other genres or forms! If second generation migrants are in fact more on their way to belonging, write a speculative story about how an apocalypse tests those connections to white Australians. I dunno, but donât be afraid to really push the boundaries here and test the implications you draw from the stories.\n\nGive it a go\n\nTry it for some of these:\n\nUnAustralian? (Loewald & Law) and Leaving Home (Diana Nguyen & Paul Nguyen)\n\nBattlers (Dac & Law/Huynh) and Mates (Phommavanh & Ahmed)\n\nThe Folks (Lazaroo & Tran) and Homecoming (Beeby & Larkin)\n\nGrowing Up Asian in Australia Essay Prompt Breakdown\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is short and sweet;\n\nTo belong is to sacrifice. Discuss.Â\n\nThe key terms are evidently âto belongâ and âto sacrificeâ, so these are the words and definitions that weâll have to interrogate.Â\n\nBelonging is a feeling of being accepted by someone or being a member of something, so weâd have to ask who is doing the accepting, and what are the writers seeking to be members of. On the other hand, sacrifice is loss, itâs giving something upâitâs implied that seeking belonging means you may have to navigate compromises to what you have, how you live, or maybe, who you are. Have a think about what sacrifices are made by whom, and why.\n\nWith that in mind, letâs brainstorm a contention. We usually want to avoid going fully agree or fully disagree to create a bit more âgritâ for the essayâand in this case, the prompt is pretty deterministic or absolute; itâs saying that belonging is all about sacrifice.Â\n\nIâd probably argue that belonging is sometimes about sacrifice, and for migrant children they often give up some of their culture or heritage for Western lifestyle or values. That being said, belonging in these cases is probably more about synthesis than sacrificeâitâs about being able to negotiate and bring heritage into increasingly Australian ways of life.\n\nThe brainstorming section of writing a killer essay is where my THINK and EXECUTE strategy comes in. If you havenât heard of it before, essentially, itâs a method of essay writing that emphasises the importance of really thinking about all aspects of a prompt and exploring all the different avenues you can go down. To be able to EXECUTE a well-reasoned, coherent and articulate essay that contains enough nitty-gritty analysis, you have to do enough THINKing to get some meat on the essayâs skeleton, so to speak. To learn more, check out my top selling eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nIn paragraphs, we could start by looking at some of the sacrifices people make in order to belong. The poem, âBe Good, Little Migrantsâ has a more of a cynical take on this, suggesting that migrant groups are expected to sacrifice economic mobility and even personal dignity in order to gain favour with locals: âgive us your faithful serviceâ, âdisplay your gratitude but donât be heard, donât be seen.âÂ\n\nEconomic sacrifices are seen across many stories, from the working class âdecent enough incomeâ in âFamily Lifeâ to the failing business in âABC Supermarketâ. Other forms of sacrifice might be less materialâfor example Benjamin Lawâs sacrifice of his Mariah Carey cassettes in an attempt to fit in at school from the story âTowards Manhoodâ. This example is interesting because it isnât a cultural sacrifice, but a gendered oneâitâs a good reminder that identity is always multi-layered.Â\n\nFor migrant children though, the sacrifices usually revolve around their race and culture. Diana Nguyen for example notes language as a key sacrifice: she quits Vietnamese school because she didnât feel like she belonged with the grade ones in her class, and her ultimate âlack of interest in learning [Vietnamese] created a lasting barrierâ between her mother and her. In Sunil Badamiâs story, âSticks and Stones and Such-Likeâ, the sacrifice is his name, as he Anglicises it to Neil. When his mother finds out, âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow.â The common denominator here is that Asians growing up in Australia often have to navigate sacrificing some of their heritage in order to belong in western society.Â\n\nHowever, the challenges faced by the Asian diaspora growing up abroad are more complex and more nuanced than just sacrifice. More often than not, theyâre required to synthesise a âthird cultureâ identity that balances their heritage with western values and lifestyles.Â\n\nDiana Nguyen goes on to discuss her career trajectory in becoming a âworking actorâ in Melbourneâs entertainment industry, carving out a path for herself in spite of her parentsâ disapproval, and going on to represent a new generation of Asian Australians in the media. The story âWei-Lei and Meâ also points to this shifting demographic in Australia, as Gouvernel and her best friend stave off a racist primary school bully only to see their home change for the better as they grew up, with new restaurants from their home cuisines opening up. At the same time, they âhad become what [they] thought [they] could never be: Australian,â describing a way of life in Canberra that is unmistakably Australian.Â\n\nSo, belonging isnât necessarily all about sacrificeâit doesnât mean you canât pursue your passions or become âAustralianâ. Sure, sometimes sacrifice is necessary, but âthird culture kidsâ synthesise conflicting identities in order to belong.Â\n\nHaving arrived at the contention, letâs just have another think about the takeaway message - being able to bring other themes into an essay topic that only really raises one theme. To answer this topic fully, a good essay wouldnât just discuss belonging and sacrifice, but it would also bring in discussion about family, friends, careers and cultures, just to name a few. Hopefully this is something you can translate into your own future work!\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowing Up Asian In Australia is an anthology with a lot to unpack, but there are plenty of unique stories with plenty of interesting links to be made. However youâre learning this text, being able to draw conclusions from stories and extrapolate them into your writing is a really important skill.\n\nAs you go, ask yourself about the implications: âso what?â and âwhy?â. These sorts of questions will help you get richer insights and write about the anthology in a more interesting way.\n\nMeasure for Measure is currently studied in VCE English under Area of Study 1 - Text Resp"
