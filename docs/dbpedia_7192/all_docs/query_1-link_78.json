        "text": "Whether it's about baseball, basketball, football or even roller derby, there is something electric about the best sports movies. While they can be cheesy and overly sentimental, they also capture the ecstasy of victory and the sting of defeat. The greatest sports movies aren’t really even about sports; they are about human will and achievement… well, sometimes they are. Sometimes, they are gross-out comedies about playing dodgeball. There are over 200 internationally recognized sports (and according to the World Sports Encyclopedia, there are over 8,000 indigenous sports). Just like sports themselves, there are hundreds of sports movies, and this list seeks to compile the MVPs of the genre.\n\nTop Sports Movies\n\nFrom comedies to coming-of-age films to dramatic biopics, the genre of “sports movies” is as diverse as the range of sports they cover. This list includes films covering 18 sports, including baseball, soccer, judo, rugby, ski jumping and many more. Many famous directors have tackled the sports film genre, including Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Clint Eastwood, Richard Linklater and Darren Aronofsky.\n\nThis list notably omits billiards, auto racing, aviation, caving and darts. However, cases have been made for their inclusion. It also features scripted films from 1942 to 2024 but does not rank documentaries (as sports documentaries could be their own separate list). This list also tries to avoid movies with one or two sports scenes like Twilight, Ferris Buller’s Day Off or Naked Gun. And all the films on this list need to be tens across the board, a real slam dunk, and a home run.\n\n42. 42 (2013)\n\n42 plays it a little safe for a movie about one of the most influential sports players of all time, Jackie Robinson. This film is mostly worth watching for the late Chadwick Boseman’s performance as Robinson.\n\n42 isn’t the first film about Robinson's life. The first was 1950’s The Jackie Robinson Story, in which Robinson played himself. 42 stars Boseman, Harrison Ford, Nicole Beharie, Christopher Meloni and André Holland. Boseman spoke with Robinson’s widow, Rachel Robinson, before playing the role. He recalled, “I asked her were there any physical things that he did that stood out. We sat down for hours and talked about his personality and what his tendencies were.” The film is available to stream on Max.\n\n41. Hard Ball (2001)\n\nHard Ball isn’t a perfect film. It struggles with a bit of a white savior narrative and an underwhelming b-plot about gambling. However, where this film really shines is in its heart and performances. The film follows a down-on-his-luck gambler as he steps in as a coach for an inner-city Chicago little league team.\n\nHard Ball is often considered “the saddest movie ever” for many millennial boys. The film stars Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane, and also features a pre-The Wire Michael B. Jordan in his first principal film role. Surprisingly (given all the players are children) the actual gameplay depicted in the film is better than many other baseball films. Hard ball is available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n40. Angels in the Outfield (1951)\n\nWhile many millennial and Gen-Z viewers will remember the 1990s remake, the original 1950s Angels in the Outfield is a better-made film. The movie follows the heartless manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates and a young reporter who blames him for the team’s losing streak; the manager then starts to hear the voice of an angel.\n\nThe film was President Dwight D. Eisenhower's favorite movie—it stars Paul Douglas and Janet Leigh. The original and the remake of this movie are pretty different from each other. One of the most significant changes is that in the 1951 film, the angels aren’t really shown; their presence is far more alluded to. Angels in the Outfield is available to purchase on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n39. Eddie the Eagle (2016)\n\nEddie the Eagle should be a bigger sports film. The movie tells the story of Michael “Eddie the Eagle” Edwards, who, in 1988, became the first competitor to represent Britain in Olympic ski jumping since 1928.\n\nA true underdog story, “Eddie” had to overcome walking difficulties, self-train and fight for inclusion in the Olympics. The film is a little sentimental and schmaltzy, but that isn’t always a bad thing; it delivers on heart. Eddie the Eagle stars Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman, Christopher Walken and Iris Berben. It is available to stream on Max.\n\n38. The Sandlot (1993)\n\nMany sports films are not exactly great but hit on a specific type of nostalgia that makes them feel classic: Space Jam, The Mighty Ducks and AirBud, to name a few. However, The Sandlot is probably the top of the pack. Roger Ebert even said of the film in 1993, “I realized I didn't have a mitt, and it was then I also realized how completely this movie had seduced me with its memories of what really matters when you are 12\".\n\nThe Sandlot follows Scott Smalls and the summer that he tries to make friends through playing backyard baseball. The Sandlot gang are at first terrified of Mr. Mertle, played by James Earl Jones, and his large dog, “the beast,” but have to confront their fears after the beast eats a Babe Ruth-signed baseball. Many parts of the film do not age well, and it has received criticism for consent issues especially. However, the film is, in many ways, an ode to childhood. It is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\n37. Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004)\n\nDodgeball isn’t the first sport that most sports fans think of. However, Dodgeball has all the trappings of a classic sports comedy: a team of lovable underdogs, a David and Goliath championship game and an iconic training montage.\n\nDodgeball stars Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor and Rip Torn. The movie is crass and pretty profane, but it delivers some great jokes. The goofiness of Dodgeball is kind of the point. Dodgeball is available to stream on Hulu.\n\n36. Miracle (2004)\n\nMiracle doesn’t break any molds when it comes to sports films. Still, it is a competently made, enjoyable and surprisingly accurate look at the 1980 Winter Olympics men’s ice hockey and the “Miracle on Ice.” In the film, the American ice hockey team beats the highly favored Soviet team to take home the gold.\n\nThe film stars Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich. Russell was especially praised for his performance. Surprisingly understated for being a classic underdog film, it also won the ESPY for Best Sports Movie in 2004. Miracle is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\n35. Happy Gilmore (1996)\n\nAdam Sandler comedies are crass, loud and sometimes kind of stupid. Happy Gilmore is no exception, but it all works. The film follows a struggling Ice Hockey player who transitions to playing golf keep his grandma’s house.\n\nThe film stars Sandler, Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay and Carl Weathers. Happy Gilmore did well at the box office but recieved poor reviews from critics. However, it has gained a cult status, especially amongst golfers. Some professional golfers have attempted the “Happy Gilmore” swing for fun and even training. The film also won an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight for the film’s famous fight scene between Sandler and Bob Barker. In May of 2024, Netflix announced that a sequel to the film is in the works. The original is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n34. Better Off Dead (1985)\n\nBetter Off Dead is a black comedy that combines coming-of-age themes with skiing. This film comes with a content warning since much of the first act is about suicide. However, the second and third acts are mostly about getting the girl and winning the big ski race in true 1980s sports fashion.\n\nThe film also features drag racing and surprisingly accurate Howard Cosell impressions. Not everything ages perfectly in the movie, but it still stands as an inventive and unique sports comedy. Better Off Dead stars John Cusack, David Ogden Stiers, Diane Franklin and Kim Darby. The film ends with a kiss at home plate at Dodger Stadium, and what could be more sports romcom than that? It is available for rental on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n33. Challengers (2024)\n\nThere may be some recency bias here. However, Challengers is one of the most inventive sports films of recent years. Slight spoilers ahead, but the film breaks almost every sports movie convention. In the end, to misquote Oscar Wild, everything is about sex except sex. Sex is about tennis, or maybe everything is about tennis except tennis.\n\nChallengers explores doubles, singles, love and winning over the career of three young tennis players. The film is a little “millennial tennis Bull Durham” without the jokes, but that isn’t a bad thing. Part of what makes it a great sports film is how the tennis is filmed. Between whip pans and inventive angles, the pace of the game radiates through the screen. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, the film stars Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist. Challengers premiered in theaters and is now available online for digital purchase.\n\n32. Invictus (2009)\n\nOne of two films on this list directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Morgan Freeman, Invictus is based on the 2008 John Carlin book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. The film follows the events of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the Springboks Rugby team in their first season post-apartheid.\n\nThe film also stars Matt Damon. Damon and Freeman's roles earned them Oscar nominations. The film explores the overlap between sports and politics and the meaning of national pride. Invictus is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n31. Uncut Gems (2019)\n\nUncut Gems isn’t higher on this list because it’s not really a sports movie. If you are looking for an Adam Sandler lead sports movie that is more about basketball, try 2022’s Hustle (or Eight Crazy Nights… though that one isn’t very good; he has been in a lot of sports films more generally as well.) However, Uncut Gems is a sports gambling film, and in the 2020s, what is more current about sports than the rise of sports gambling?\n\nThe film, directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, stars Sandler, LaKeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, Idina Menzel and real-life basketballer Kevin Garnett. The film has the frenetic pace of a heart attack, making it uncomfortable to watch. However, it became a critical darling, and the film was nominated for four Golden Globes. Sandler was also nominated for the Golden Rassbery, Razzie Redeemer Award for his role in the movie. The movie is available to rent on YouTube, Amazon Prime, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n30. Coach Carter (2005)\n\nSome have called Coach Carter “predictable.” The story follows a tough coach who is brought in to shape up an inner-city High school basketball team, which is a familiar narrative when it comes to sports movies (the co-writer of the film, John Gatins, also wrote Hard Ball). However, this take isn’t entirely fair, given that it is based on the true story of Ken Carter, The Richmond, California Oilers and the 1998 season lockout, which made national news.\n\nIn the film and in real life, Ken Carter kept his undefeated basketball team from playing until they met an honor code and improved their grades. The decision was unpopular with the community but caught the eye of then-California Governor Gray Davis, who came to a game later in the season. The film was directed by Thomas Carter (no relation) and stars Samuel L. Jackson, Rick Gonzalez, Robert Brown, Antwon Tanner and Channing Tatum in his first film role. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n29. Field of Dreams (1989)\n\nIs Field of Dreams a little corny? Well, yes. But that’s kind of the point. The film follows a farmer who builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield. Ghosts of baseball legends are pulled to the field, including Shoeless Joe Jackson and Dr. Archibald \"Moonlight\" Graham.\n\nThe film stars Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster in his final film role. Upon reading the script, Costner felt the film was his generation’s It’s A Wonderful Life. Roger Ebert shared this feeling, writing, \"This is the kind of movie Frank Capra might have directed, and James Stewart might have starred in—a movie about dreams.\" The film was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Picture. In 2021, Major League Baseball held a \"MLB at Field of Dreams game\" which marked the first Major League game ever held at the fan-favorite movie location, as well as in the state of Iowa. It is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n28. Moneyball (2011)\n\nMoneyball is one of those movies where the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis is better. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t a great movie. The film follows the Oakland A’s 2002 season and the sabermetric strategy their manager, Billy Beane, used to identify undervalued talent to scout.\n\nThe film stars Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Moneyball was directed by Bennett Miller with a script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards. Art Howe (played by Hoffman in the film) was upset by his portrayal, and Bay Area locals and critics noted several significant historical inaccuracies in the film. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n27. Shaolin Soccer (2004)\n\nShaolin Soccer might be the wackiest film on this list. The movie follows former monks as they use their superhuman martial arts skills to play soccer. Part soccer, part martial arts, part comedy film, Shaolin Soccer was written, directed by and starred Stephen Chow. The film also features Zhao Wei, Ng Man-tat, Patrick Tse and Danny Chan Kwok-kwan.\n\nShaolin Soccer was initially banned in China but did well at the Hong Kong box office. Edgar Wright named Shaolin Soccer as an influence for his film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and the co-creator of Avatar: The Last Airbender, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, named it amongst their favorite movies and that it inspired how elemental bending could look on the show. The film is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n26. Remember the Titans (2000)\n\nRemember the Titans might not be the best sports movie of all time, but it might be the “most sports movie.” It has everything you want from a sports movie: an underdog story, a devoted coach thrown into a new situation days away from being fired, the love of football, being based on a true story and even an inspirational training montage. However, Remember the Titans adds the backdrop of 1970s segregated Virginia.\n\nThe film stars Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Donald Faison and Nicole Ari Parker. It received mixed but lightly favorable reviews. Washington also won a BET and NAACP award for his performance. Remember the Titans is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\n25. King Richard (2021)\n\nKing Richard tells the story of Richard Williams, the father of Serena and Venus Williams, as they begin their tennis careers. The Williams sisters both signed on as executive producers after seeing the film and praised its accuracy.\n\nThe film stars Will Smith as well as Aunjanue Ellis and Saniyya Sidney. King Richard earned Smith the Best Actor Oscar and was nominated for five others. The film received some mild criticism for diminishing the accomplishments of the Williams sisters and shifting the focus to their father. However, Smith’s performance makes this film more than worth a watch. Serena Williams said of the film, “I think it was a great opportunity to see how amazing African-American fathers are. A lot of black men aren't seen in that light.” It is currently streaming on Netflix and Max.\n\n24. The Pride of the Yankees (1942)\n\nWhile there have been movies about sports (and especially baseball) since the late 1800s, The Pride of the Yankees was one of the first sports movies to win an Academy Award. The film is based on the real-life story of Lou Gehrig, a legendary Yankees’ first baseman who passed a year before the film’s release at the age of 37 of “Lou Gehrig’s disease” or ALS.\n\nGary Cooper portrays Gehrig, while several of his teammates, including Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig and Bill Dickey, play themselves. The film is a loving epitaph that focuses more on Gehrig’s life than his baseball career. It was nominated for ten Oscars. The film's theatrical release was paired with the premiere of an animated short from Walt Disney Animation Studios called How to Play Baseball, featuring Goofy demonstrating how to play America’s pastime. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV, Peacock and Amazon Prime.\n\n23. Caddyshack (1980)\n\nThe second cult comedy about golf on this list, Caddyshack, is perfectly 1980s. Directed by Harold Ramis, the film follows a caddie vying for a scholarship who becomes embroiled in a feud between old money and new money at the club.\n\nCaddyshack stars Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Michael O'Keefe and Bill Murray. It was originally met with tepid reviews, but it has gained a loyal following. ESPN called It “perhaps the funniest sports movie ever made.” It is currently streaming on Philo.\n\n22. Sanshiro Sugata (1943)\n\nAkira Kurosawa's directorial debut, Sanshiro Sugata, follows a young man in the 1880s who travels to the city to learn Jujutsu and instead discovers the newly invented Judo. Unfortunately, seven minutes of the film were cut and lost due to Japanese wartime censorship.\n\nThe film isn’t usually noted among Kurosawa’s best work, but it has a gritty realness and moments of directorial interest scattered throughout. It has been remade several times in Japan, and Kurosawa also directed a sequel to 1945’s Sanshiro Sugata Part II. Sanshiro Sugata is currently streaming for free on Plex.\n\n21. Major League (1989)\n\nWhen a new owner inherits a team from her husband, she decides to try to run it into the ground. No, this isn’t Ted Lasso; it’s Major League. Starring Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Bob Uecker and Rene Russo, Major League follows the, unfortunately named, Cleveland Indians and their struggle to keep attendance high enough so the team won’t move to Miami.\n\nThe film is beloved amongst baseball fans and is often referenced by professional baseball players and announcers. The film also features appearances from real players like Pete Vuckovich, Willie Mueller and Steve Yeager. The gameplay in the movie is also surprisingly accurate. Sheen was a former high school pitcher, and during filming, he had an 88-mile-per-hour fastball. However, years later, he admitted that he had to take steroids for two months to get into athletic shape for filming. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n20. He Got Game (1998)\n\nJesus Shuttlesworth has an important choice. As the top high school basketball player, he has to choose between a college program and the NBA. His choice is complicated after his incarcerated father, Jake, tries to convince him to go to “Big State” because it will take some time off of Jake’s sentence.\n\nSpike Lee’s He Got Game stars real-life basketballer Ray Allen and actor Denzel Washington. The movie didn’t do well at the box office and received mixed reviews at release. However, there is something wholly creative about it. It doesn’t fall into a lot of the tropes of sports movies. Journalist and professor Lawrence Ware said of the film, “Looking back on the film 25 years later, I now see that it is not a perfect film, but it is a prescient one.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n19. Sugar (2008)\n\nSugar is a real hidden gem. The film takes a sensitive look at Miguel \"Sugar\" Santos, a baseball player from the Dominican Republic, as he comes to play for a minor league team in Iowa. While the story is fictional, many Dominican players have come to the Major League through a similar process, and the film was obviously well-researched (especially when it comes to how the league uses foreign talent and farm teams.)\n\nThe film currently holds a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film stars Algenis Perez Soto, Karl Bury and Michael Gaston. The film isn’t an average sports movie. Roger Ebert noted in his review, “I thought I could guess the story. But I couldn't. There isn't a single scene in this film where it really matters which side wins a game, and it doesn't end with a no-hitter.” Sugar is available for purchase on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n18. Whip It (2009)\n\nDrew Barrymore’s directorial debut about roller derby, Whip It, is somewhat of a deep cut. The coming-of-age comedy follows a teenager longing to break out of rural Texas beauty pageant culture and into the world of roller derby in Austin.\n\nWhip It stars Elliot Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Alia Shawkat, Kristen Wiig, Barrymore, Juliette Lewis and Eve. The film didn’t perform well at the box office, but it received generally favorable reviews, even though many thought it was predictable. Whip It deserves another look; some have even called it “criminally overlooked.” Whip It serves up great comedy, heart and a look into peak 2000s alt-girl power. It is currently streaming on Paramount+.\n\n17. Love & Basketball (2000)\n\nLove & Basketball is about passion both in interpersonal relationships and for the game itself. The film follows two young ballplayers turned lovers who share the dream of getting to the NBA.\n\nWritten and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, the film stars Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. It has become a cult classic, especially in the Black community. When it came out, Love & Basketball got generally positive reviews. However, many have revisited the film. Jenni Miller wrote for the A.V. Club in 2015, “Love & Basketball is a nearly perfect modern romantic drama,” even if Quincy was kind of a jerk to Monica. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n16. The Iron Claw (2023)\n\nThe Iron Claw is as much about professional wrestling as it is about familial pressure, the bonds of brotherhood and generational curses. The film follows the real-life story of the Von Erich brothers and the World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW).\n\nThe film was produced and promoted during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike after being given special dispensation due to A24’s relationship with the Union. It stars Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and Lily James. Efron was especially lauded for his performance. Many thought that the film and Efron were snubbed at the Oscars. The Iron Claw is available to stream on Max.\n\n15. White Men Can’t Jump (1992)\n\nOne of two films on this list from Ron Shelton, White Men Can’t Jump, is still funny and even poignant after 30 years. The film stars Woody Harrelson as a former college basketball player who teams up with a streetballer, Wesley Snipes, to hustle games to pay off a gambling debt to the mob. The film also stars Rosie Perez as Harrelson’s live-in girlfriend.\n\nPerez is a scene-stealer in many ways. In his 1992 review, Roger Ebert called her performance “Oscar-caliber supporting work” and noted her chemistry with Harrelson. While the film did well at the box office, it has also become a cult classic, inspiring a video game, Nike collab and a 2023 remake. The original is currently streaming on Max.\n\n14. Creed (2015)\n\nCreed is part of the Rocky canon, but it’s not quite a reboot or a sequel. It feels like it stands on its own while still enjoying the nostalgia of America’s favorite boxing movie franchise. Creed follows Adonis, the son of Apollo Creed, as he is trained by Rocky Balboa, a friend of his late father.\n\nThe film was directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson and Phylicia Rashad. A.V. Wire's Herman Dhaliwal wrote, \"I will say the film was everything I could have ever wanted and then some. It's a film that could have gone so wrong in so many ways so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired.” The film is currently streaming on Philo.\n\n13. Bring It On (2000)\n\nBring It On is a cult and sleepover classic for a reason. Even Roger Ebert revisited the film after an originally negative review called it “Citizen Kane of cheerleader movies.\" The film follows two rival high school cheer teams preparing for nationals.\n\nBring It On stars Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. While the film prompted several direct-to-video sequels and a 2011 stage musical (with music by Lin-Manuel Miranda), its real legacy might be in its themes. The film addresses issues of systemic inequality, cultural appropriation and intersectional feminism. Katie Barnes wrote for ESPN.com, “The entire film is an exploration of appropriation and the way whiteness works in our culture. It tackles race, gender and sexuality in stunning ways. Somehow within 98 minutes, queer politics gets addressed too. It's a breakneck cultural mirror.” The film is currently available for streaming on Starz.\n\n12. The Karate Kid (1984)\n\nWhile The Karate Kid is now a franchise, you can’t beat the original. Upon the release of the 2010 remake, film critic Dana Stevens wrote that the original “may have seemed like a standard-issue inspirational sports picture at the time, but… a generation of remove reveals what a well-crafted movie it actually was.”\n\nThe film follows a bullied kid as he learns karate from his apartment’s handyman, Mr. Miyagi. While The Karate Kid may be remembered for its wax-on-wax-off training montage and sweeping the leg, it also looks at the growth of unlikely friendship, the stain of Japanese internment in America and impressive fight choreography. The film stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, William Zabka and Elisabeth Shue. Morita received an Oscar nomination for his role as Mr. Miyagi. The film is available to stream on Starz.\n\n11. Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)\n\nRichard Linklater’s love letter to the 1980s, Everybody Wants Some!!, maybe shouldn’t qualify as a sports film. While it follows a freshman pitcher’s introduction to a college baseball team, it is as much about baseball as it is about partying, hitting on girls and coming of age. However, the baseball scenes and the team's interactions make this feel like a sports movie.\n\nThe film didn’t perform well at the box office but received positive reviews, with an 87% on Rotten Tomatoes for its humor and heart. Reviewer Sheila O'Malley said of the film, “'Everybody Wants Some!!' is a corrective to the tired, false “dumb jock” stereotype.\" Everybody Wants Some!! also features excellent performances from Blake Jenner, Zoey Deutch, Ryan Guzman, Tyler Hoechlin, Glen Powell and Wyatt Russell. The film is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n10. Chariots of Fire (1981)\n\nWith one of the most iconic scores in movie history, Chariots of Fire is “the story of two men who run, not to run, but to prove something to the world.” The film follows a Jewish runner and a Scottish Christian runner as they represent Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe film stars Ben Cross and Ian Charleson. Chariots of Fire was met with near-universal acclaim and was nominated for seven Oscars, winning four. The BFI has since ranked it among the Top 100 British films. While the film is very loosely based on the 1924 Olympics, it is not historically accurate and was not meant to be. Chariots of Fire is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n9. Offside (2006)\n\nOffside is truly a hidden gem that captures the love of soccer so many feel. The film follows a group of girls who try to sneak into the World Cup qualifying match in Iran. Due to a law against women in football stadiums, the girls wear drag and costumes to try to sneak by the guards.\n\nThe film was inspired by director Jafar Panahi’s daughter, who attended a game. Offside was shot in Iran but couldn’t be screened there due to a ban. The sports-comedy satire won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and was also selected for the New York and Toronto International Film Festivals. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n8. Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nMillion Dollar Baby follows an amateur female boxer and her trainer as they try to make a name for themselves in professional boxing. While it might sound uplifting, it is more tragic than many other rags-to-riches boxing stories.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby was directed, co-produced, scored by and starred Clint Eastwood. It also stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Million Dollar Baby won four Oscars, including Best Picture. The film currently holds a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n7. The Wrestler (2008)\n\nDarren Aronofsky’s gritty tale of an aging wrestler is about getting back in the ring. The film also served as a comeback for star Mickey Rouke, who earned an Oscar for the role.\n\nThe Wrestler also stars Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. The film was met with universal acclaim and currently holds a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. Tom Ward wrote in a 15 year retrospective for Esquire, “Despite its abrasive (and bloody) subject matter, there is much beauty in The Wrestler. Shot on 16mm film, winter-time New Jersey is suitably melancholy. And, for a film about the most bombastic of sports, Aronofsky tells an incredibly subdued story.” It is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\n6. I, Tonya (2017)\n\nDid Tonya Harding orchestrate the 1994 assault on her figure skating rival Nancy Kerrigan? I, Tonya is less interested in answering for sure than bringing the watcher into the difficult life of skating’s most controversial olympian. The film features unreliable narrators in a story that is self-professed: \"contradictory\" and \"totally true.”\n\nStarring Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Paul Walter Hauser and Bobby Cannavale, I, Tonya isn’t your average sports film. However, it delivers humor, tragedy, emotional resonance and an unexpected look at the place of class in competitive sports. The film earned Robbie her first Academy Award nomination. Janney won the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG and BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n5. Raging Bull (1980)\n\nMartin Scorsese has made many great movies. However, Raging Bull is among his best. The film follows the life of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta and is based on his memoir Raging Bull: My Story. The film stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty and Nicholas Colasanto.\n\nScorsese initially didn’t want to make the film. However, after a collapse made him connect with LaMotta's story, he decided to work with De Niro. Raging Bull was nominated for eight Oscars and currently has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to stream for free on Tubi, Pluto TV and the Roku Channel. It is also available on MGM+ with a subscription.\n\n4. Bull Durham (1988)\n\nPart romcom, part Baseball film, Bull Durham is simply delightful. The film follows a minor league veteran catcher as he trains a hopeful minor league rookie pitcher. Directed by White Men Can’t Jump’s Ron Shelton, the film stars Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. Bull Durham is in many ways is a love letter to the minor leagues, partially because the film believes in the “Church of Baseball.”\n\nThe film earned Shelton an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Sports Illustrated ranked it as their #1 Greatest Sports Movie of all time in 2003. The film currently boasts a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Bull Durham delivers on sexy love triangles, quippy dialogue and, most importantly, a reverence for the game. The film is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n3. Bend It Like Beckham (2002)\n\nBend It Like Beckham follows Jesminder \"Jess\" Bhamra, a British Punjabi Sikh, as she tries to turn her soccer dreams into a reality. Bend It Like Beckham balances humor with culture, sports and changing attitudes.\n\nDirected by Gurinder Chadha, the film stars Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Both Nagra and Knightley completed three months of soccer training before the film and did all their own playing. The film was a box office smash, earning over $76.5 million against a $6 million budget. Bend It Like Beckham also received an ESPY Award for Best Sports Movie and a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film. It is currently streaming for free on The Roku Channel or with subscription on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n2. A League of Their Own (1992)\n\n\"There's no crying in baseball!\" Based on the true story of the All-American Girls League, A League of Their Own follows a fictionalized women’s baseball team, The Rockford Peaches, as World War II shuts down men’s major league baseball. Directed by Penny Marshall, the film stars Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty, Rosie O’Donnell, Jon Lovitz, Garry Marshall and Bill Pullman.\n\nEvery woman who auditioned for the film had to be able to play baseball. Davis especially had some natural talent, and learning to play for the movie led her to tap into a love for sports and eventually make it to the Olympic trials for archery. In 2012, A League of Their Own was chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry. It is still the highest-grossing baseball movie of all time, beating out the Jackie Robinson biopic, 42. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n1. Rocky (1976)\n\nIt is tempting to put several Rocky movies on this list (remember when he won the Cold War by boxing?), but you can’t beat the original. Rocky follows a small-time Philly boxer and his unlikely rise to the world heavyweight championship. It was written by and stars Sylvester Stallone, who wrote the script in three days.\n\nHis work on the film made him the third actor to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor in the same year. The film won two Oscars for John G. Avildsen’s directing and Best Picture. Rocky is also often credited with popularizing the “rags to riches” sports film in America. However, the first Rocky film doesn’t lead audiences to care about the outcome of the fight. The film also features an iconic score and training montage, which have become part of the American cinematic vocabulary. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation for being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” in the Library of Congress. It is currently streaming on AMC+ and Philo.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe greatest sports films capture the nature of sports. They show crushing defeats, unlikely wins and the excitement and momentum that real games bring fans. From baseball to boxing, great sports films make the audience care about the game and its players. Is this ranking even really a competition, or are they all winners here?"
