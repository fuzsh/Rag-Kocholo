        "text": "All-Time (Domestic) Box-Office Hits and Top Films By Decade and Year:\n\nBox-office earnings have often been a great predictor of the feature-length films that have been the most favorite, successful, and popular. However, they do not necessarily reflect the best (or greatest) films of the year or decade. They also provide a window into the era when the film was originally released. Although box-office records are often contradictory, spotty, unreliable and sometimes non-existent (the further you go back in cinematic history), it has been possible to compile listings of the top domestic hits all the way back to 1913 - both by decade (beginning with the silents and the 1920s) and by individual year, up to the present year.\n\nRankings of the top US feature-length films by decade (based on unadjusted domestic gross revenue) are presented below. Also, rankings of the top films by year are included. In earlier days stretching from the 1920s to the 1940s, exact dollar grosses for films at the box-office were often tallied differently, and therefore remain somewhat unreliable. Examples of sources for this information include: The Numbers, Box-Office Mojo, IMDb, or IMDbPro (subscription), Stats-A-Mania, Wikipedia, Ultimate Movie Rankings, and a Business Insider article (examples of links available at present time). Discrepancies between each of these sources presented a challenge to select the top domestic-grossing film of each year. In most cases, the top-earning domestic film was the one with the most mentions as the highest-grossing film.\n\nNote: Complications in determining accurate box-office totals include the fact that many films have had multiple releases (such as Disney animated feature films), re-issues or re-releases, special editions, director's cuts, and subsequent 3-D and IMAX releases - a situation that can have a significant impact on standings. For some films, there are two figures: domestic gross revenue and lifetime domestic gross revenue."
