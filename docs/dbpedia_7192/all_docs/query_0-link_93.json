        "text": "01 of 20\n\nAnother Round (2020)\n\nWe’ve seen numerous movies explore male midlife crises, but this Oscar-winning dramedy from writer-director Thomas Vinterberg provides a fresh perspective. The Danish film follows four teacher friends who add flavor to their listless lives with an odd experiment: try to maintain a blood alcohol level of 0.05% at all times for maximum creativity and relaxation. While the colleagues commit to the same drinking schedule, the results vary as one of them develops a troubling addiction. EW’s critic calls Another Round “an intoxicated tale of midlife angst and catharsis,” anchored by Mads Mikkelsen in one of his best performances. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Another Round: Tubi\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Thomas Vinterberg\n\nCast: Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe\n\n02 of 20\n\nBram Stoker's Dracula (1992)\n\nThe story of Dracula has been told countless times on the big and small screen, but rarely with such style as this '90s favorite. Directed with impeccable visual flair by Francis Ford Coppola, Bram Stoker's Dracula is not, in fact, an entirely faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's story, but the changes made are fascinating nonetheless. Gary Oldman stars as the vampiric Count Dracula, who falls in love with his solicitor Jonathan Harker's (Keanu Reeves) fiancée, Mina (Winona Ryder). Deviating from the source material, Mina falls in love with Dracula in return; meanwhile, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called upon to help fight the increasingly powerful Dracula. \"There’s nothing remotely old-fashioned about Coppola's movie,\" writes EW's critic. \"His Dracula is less a filmed novel than an explosion of lava-hot imagery.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Bram Stoker's Dracula: Tubi\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves\n\n03 of 20\n\nBringing Up Baby (1938)\n\nBased on the initial response to Bringing Up Baby, few guessed that it would become the screwball classic it is today. Critics praised the zippy comedy, but audiences all but rejected it, making it a box office bomb. The film concerns the misadventures of paleontologist David (Cary Grant) and free-spirited heiress Susan (Katharine Hepburn), whom he meets the day before his wedding. Susan enlists him to help her transport a leopard to her farm, and things naturally become complicated when she falls in love with him. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Bringing Up Baby: Tubi\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, May Robson, Walter Catlett, Fritz Feld\n\n04 of 20\n\nEve's Bayou (1997)\n\nKasi Lemmons' evocative directorial debut is a Southern gothic drama about family secrets and the trauma we carry. Ten-year-old Eve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett), a member of a well-to-do Louisiana family, is blessed with the gift of premonitions. One night, she catches her father cheating on her mother, putting a strain on their relationship as Eve struggles with how to proceed from there. Eve turns to the women in her community for guidance, leading to a fateful action that will change everyone's lives forever. Mysterious and moving, Eve's Bayou \"covers a tremendous amount of emotional territory with the lightest and most graceful of steps,\" writes EW's critic. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Eve's Bayou: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Kasi Lemmons\n\nCast: Jurnee Smollett, Samuel L. Jackson, Lynn Whitfield, Debbi Morgan, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Branford Marsalis, Lisa Nicole Carson, Meagan Good, Diahann Carroll\n\n05 of 20\n\nHeathers (1989)\n\nThe OG razor-sharp teen comedy, Heathers is the poisoned apple tree from which films like Clueless (1995), Jawbreaker (1999), and Mean Girls (2004) would later blossom. Winona Ryder stars as Veronica, one of the popular girls at a suburban high school where suicide has suddenly become the hottest new fad. Originally a box-office flop, this 1987 comedy has since become a cult classic. “To be honest, I have no clue how a satire as delightfully mean-spirited as Heathers ever got greenlit,” EW’s critic writes. “All I know is, [Lindsay] Lohan and [Emma] Stone should be thankful it did.” —Katie Rife\n\nWhere to watch Heathers: Tubi\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Lehmann\n\nCast: Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty\n\n06 of 20\n\nKlute (1971)\n\nThis absorbing psychological thriller brilliantly evokes the paranoia of 1970s America. Donald Sutherland plays John Klute, a private detective hired to solve the disappearance of an executive. His only lead is Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda), a high-priced sex worker who has been receiving obscene phone calls and letters. Klute and Bree develop a complex relationship that becomes fraught when they fear she may be targeted next. Tense and nervy, Klute is a fascinating time capsule that also serves as a marvelous showcase for Fonda, who won her first Best Actress Oscar for the role. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Klute: Tubi\n\nDirector: Alan J. Pakula\n\nCast: Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Charles Cioffi, Nathan George, Dorothy Tristan, Roy Scheider, Rita Gam\n\n07 of 20\n\nMemento (2001)\n\nOscar-winning director Christopher Nolan burst onto the scene with his intricate, intellectual style already fully developed in Memento, his second feature film. Guy Pearce stars as Leonard, a broken man out for revenge for the murder of his wife — a mission that’s made more difficult by the fact that he has an untreatable condition that resets his short-term memory every 15 minutes. “Memento has a spooky repetitive urgency that takes on the clarity of a dream,” writes EW’s critic. “It’s like an Oliver Sacks case study played as malevolent film noir.” —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Memento: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nCast: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano\n\n08 of 20\n\nMoonstruck (1987)\n\nCher won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as an Italian American woman torn between a fiancé she likes but doesn’t love and a passionate affair with her soon-to-be brother-in-law. Nicolas Cage costars in this romantic classic as the inconvenient sibling in question, a baker missing a hand from an industrial accident who woos Cher’s character with puppy-dog charm. The writing and acting in the film are both top-notch, making for a magical movie-watching experience. —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Moonstruck: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Norman Jewison\n\nCast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia, Olympia Dukakis, Danny Aiello\n\n09 of 20\n\nThe Night of the Hunter (1955)\n\nThis disturbing thriller classic follows the exploits of Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a serial killer posing as a preacher. After learning about a brother and sister who have inherited a large cash sum, he methodically woos their widowed mother and does everything in his power to obtain the money. Oscar-winning actor Charles Laughton’s lone directorial venture, The Night of the Hunter is a masterful film noir and an unsettling descent into darkness that was decades ahead of its time. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Night of the Hunter: Tubi\n\nDirector: Charles Laughton\n\nCast: Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish\n\n10 of 20\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nWe have Night of the Living Dead to thank for our modern idea of zombies and the many tropes attached to the subgenre. Legendary director George Romero was inspired by the 1954 novel I Am Legend for this independent horror classic, which centers the action on a farmhouse overrun by ravenous, undead “ghouls.” The film’s allusions to then-current events (as EW’s critic writes, “flesh-eating zombies as a Vietnam-era metaphor for America devouring itself”) just make it all the more resonant. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Night of the Living Dead: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: George Romero\n\nCast: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Judith Ridley, Keith Wayne, Kyra Schon\n\n11 of 20\n\nPaprika (2006)\n\nThis dizzying mind-bender from Satoshi Kon pushes past the limits of what animation can be. Dr. Atsuko Chiba is a psychiatrist who utilizes innovative technology to enter people’s dreams via her colorful alter ego, Paprika. After the device is stolen, Atsuko/Paprika tries to find the person responsible as the line between dreams and the real world begins to blur. To enjoy Paprika is to give yourself over to its surrealistic logic rather than try to puzzle it out. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Paprika: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Satoshi Kon\n\nCast: Megumi Hayashibara, Tōru Emori, Katsunosuke Hori, Tōru Furuya, Akio Ōtsuka, Kōichi Yamadera, Hideyuki Tanaka\n\n12 of 20\n\nRashomon (1950)\n\nA film so influential it spawned a namesake cinematic technique, Rashomon centers on the unreliability of human perception and ego. The death of a samurai in the woods leads to multiple contradictory accounts from those involved. A bandit — the No. 1 suspect — says he killed the samurai in a duel. The samurai’s wife claims she fainted during the encounter and awoke to find him dead, but a medium communicates an entirely different story from the perspective of the dead samurai. It’s unclear where the truth lies, and master director Akira Kurosawa expertly delivers an engaging mystery that makes the audience an active participant. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Rashomon: Tubi\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nCast: Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyō, Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Minoru Chiaki\n\n13 of 20\n\nSecretary (2002)\n\nThis BDSM-themed rom-com stars Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee, an emotionally unbalanced young woman who finds her purpose when she takes a job as a secretary for Mr. Grey (James Spader), a strict and demanding attorney. What starts as sexual tension soon turns into an elaborate, kinky roleplaying game that consumes both boss and assistant. Could true love be far behind? —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Secretary: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Steven Shainberg\n\nCast: James Spader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jeremy Davies, Patrick Bauchau, Stephen McHattie, Lesley Ann Warren\n\n14 of 20\n\nShort Term 12 (2013)\n\nDestin Daniel Cretton’s acclaimed indie drama is among the most significant launching pads for future 21st-century movie stars. The film, about the residents and staff of a group home for troubled teenagers, marked the feature debuts of LaKeith Stanfield (Sorry to Bother You) and Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), as well as early roles for Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart) and Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody, Mr. Robot). It was also the first lead movie role for future Captain Marvel Brie Larson, who reunited with the director in a mid-credits scene in 2021’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Short Term 12: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Destin Daniel Cretton\n\nCast: Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Rami Malek, LaKeith Stanfield, Kevin Hernandez, Melora Walters, Stephanie Beatriz\n\n15 of 20\n\nSnowpiercer (2014)\n\nAdapted from the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Snowpiercer tells the high-stakes story of a self-sustaining train circling the planet in the wake of a climate disaster that ushered in a new Ice Age. The passengers are segregated according to class, which leads to a revolt as those at the tail-end attempt to make their way to the front of the train to confront those in charge. Featuring the kinds of memorable visuals, thrilling plot twists, and cultural commentary we've come to expect from director Bong Joon Ho, Snowpiercer is one of the most audacious sci-fi action films of the modern age. As EW's critic writes, \"It leaves you with the all too rare sensation that you've just witnessed something you've never seen before… and need to see again and again.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Snowpiercer: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Bong Joon Ho\n\nCast: Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Ewen Bremner, Go Ah-sung, John Hurt, Ed Harris\n\n16 of 20\n\nTickled (2016)\n\nLots of documentaries describe themselves as “stranger than fiction,” but Tickled makes them all look downright tame. New Zealand journalist David Farrier serves as the deadpan narrator of this bizarre tale, which starts as a quirky human-interest story about “competitive endurance tickling” before descending into an online conspiracy headed by a sinister figure who’s much more dangerous than one would ever expect the head of a tickling racket to be. —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Tickled: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: David Farrier and Dylan Reeve\n\n17 of 20\n\nTrain to Busan (2016)\n\nFrom Parasite to Squid Game, South Korean entertainment is making waves across the globe, and the high-voltage thrills of Train to Busan are among the best the country has to offer. Set on a high-speed locomotive during a zombie outbreak, the film speeds forward like, well, a runaway train, blending equal parts intense post-apocalyptic horror, exhilarating action, and engaging family melodrama. Between its sequels, prequels, and a planned American remake, its status as a modern horror classic is set. —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch Train to Busan: Tubi\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Yeon Sang-ho\n\nCast: Gong Yoo, Jung Yu-mi, Ma Dong-seok, Kim Su-an, Choi Woo-shik, Ahn So-hee, Kim Eui-sung\n\n18 of 20\n\nThe Visitor (2007)\n\nRichard Jenkins gives the performance of a lifetime in this small, unassuming drama as an economics professor who discovers an immigrant couple (Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira) squatting in his little-used NYC apartment. Rather than evicting them, he befriends them, bearing witness to the harsh inequalities of post-9/11 America when one of them is arrested and detained on immigration charges. What follows is a touching drama anchored by its leading man, whom EW’s critic describes as “an artist who inhabits, rather than visits, the characters he plays.” —K.R.\n\nWhere to watch The Visitor: Tubi\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Tom McCarthy\n\nCast: Richard Jenkins, Hiam Abbass, Haaz Sleiman, Danai Gurira\n\n19 of 20\n\nWhale Rider (2003)\n\nA tween Māori girl tries to prove her destiny as her tribe's leader in this inspiring indie drama. Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes in her film debut) is a 12-year-old who faces sexist traditions within her tribe, as elders believe only a male descendant of their beloved ancestor can take up the mantle of Chief. Over and over again, Paikea proves herself to be the most worthy, particularly when she demonstrates her innate connection to the local whales. Sensitively directed by Niki Caro, Whale Rider is a fascinating look at customs and traditions led by Castle-Hughes in a remarkably lived-in performance that earned her an Oscar nomination. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Whale Rider: Tubi\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Niki Caro\n\nCast: Keisha Castle-Hughes, Rawiri Paratene, Vicky Haughton, Cliff Curtis\n\n20 of 20\n\nWhat's Up, Doc? (1972)\n\nPeter Bogdanovich evoked the screwball comedies of the Golden Age of Hollywood with this farcical delight. Ryan O'Neal stars as a frequently befuddled musicologist who heads west with his nagging fiancée, Eunice (Madeline Kahn, hilarious in her film debut) for a potential research grant. At the hotel, he meets Judy (Barbra Streisand), an agent of chaos who takes a liking to him. Several switched suitcases and hilarious set pieces later, they all eventually find themselves on a high-speed chase through the streets of San Francisco. With a plot that grows more absurd with each passing scene, plus committed performances from O’Neal and Streisand at their comedic best, What’s Up, Doc? is a total gem. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch What’s Up, Doc?: Tubi\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Peter Bogdanovich\n\nCast: Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal, Kenneth Mars, Austin Pendleton, Sorrell Booke, Michael Murphy, Madeline Kahn"
