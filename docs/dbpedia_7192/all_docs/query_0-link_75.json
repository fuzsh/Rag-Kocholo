But behind all this, the circus is a massive machine whose very life depends on discipline and motion and speed. A mechanized army on wheels, that rolls over any obstacle in its path, that meets calamity again and again, but always comes up smiling. A place where disaster and tragedy stalk the big top, haunt the backyard, and ride the circus train. Where death is constantly watching for one frayed rope, one weak link, or one trace of fear. A fierce, primitive fighting force that smashes relentlessly forward against impossible odds. That is the circus. And this is the story of the biggest of the big tops, and of the men and women who fight to make it 'The Greatest Show on Earth.'\"\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952)\n\nPlay clip (excerpt):\n\n- \"Clowns are funny people, they only love once.\"\n\n- \"All men aren't that way, even if they act like clowns.\"\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952)\n\nPlay clip (excerpt):\n\n- \"It's no good.
