Elson’s tally six seconds into the extra frame was the fastest goal to start any period in Griffins history, for or against. Grand Rapids pushed its home point streak to seven games against the Stars (6-0-1-0). Ryan Murphy tied the team’s longest assist streak this year (4), joining Kyle Criscuolo and Jonatan Berggren. Elson (1-1—2), Dennis Yan (1-1—2), Josh Dickinson (1-2—3), and Dominik Shine (1-1—2) all registered multi-point outings. Elson recorded overtime winners in back-to-back games for the first time in his career. Recap | Highlights\n\nFriday vs. Texas (2-4 L) - Four different Stars scored to help lift Texas over Grand Rapids 4-2 at Van Andel Arena. The loss snapped the Griffins’ seven-game point streak in West Michigan against the Stars (6-1-1-0). Turner Elson recorded his fifth goal in just as many games, which is the longest goal streak of the season by any Griffin. Brian Lashoff skated in his 700th game as a pro while Elson recorded his 200th point in the AHL. Riley Barber registered a multi-point game with helpers on both tallies. Elson extended his point streak to five games (5-2—7). Victor Brattstrom tied his season-high for saves with 36. Dominik Shine bagged a goal for the second consecutive game while Kyle Criscuolo recorded his 100th assist in the AHL. Recap | Highlights\n\nSaturday at Rockford (1-5 L) - Rockford’s three-goal middle frame lifted the IceHogs past the Griffins 5-1 at the BMO Harris Bank Center. Grand Rapids suffered just its second lost in seven games against Rockford this season (5-2-0-0). The Griffins avoided a shutout when Tyler Spezia notched his 13th goal of the campaign in the third period. Dominik Shine extended his point streak (2-2—4) to three games with a helper. Turner Elson saw his career-high five-game goal streak come to an end. Dan Renouf skated in his 350th game as a professional while Luke Witkowski and Jonatan Berggren returned to the lineup. Calvin Pickard saw his three-game win streak come to a close. Recap | Highlights\n\nOvertime Magic: Turner Elson rattled off a career-high five-game goal streak from March 9-18, which is the longest goal streak this season by a Griffin. The 29-year-old recorded overtime winners in two straight outings from March 13-16, joining Filip Hronek as the only Griffins to score overtime goals in consecutive games. After registering zero overtime tallies in his first 233 regular-season games as a Griffin, Elson scored consecutive overtime goals from March 13-16 and in three of his last 45 contests. With three OT tallies apiece, Elson and Jonatan Berggren have tied Grand Rapids’ single-season record (Andy Miele in 2014-15 and Kevin Miller in 2003-04) and along with Brian Lashoff sit one shy of the career mark shared by Miele and Jiri Hudler. Grand Rapids’ five road overtime wins this season (5-1) are a franchise record. The Griffins’ four home overtime losses this campaign (2-4) tie the franchise record set in 2014-15.\n\nTrade Deadline Moves: On Monday, the Detroit Red Wings traded defensemen Nick Leddy and Luke Witkowski to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for defenseman Jake Walman, center Oskar Sundqvist and a second-round pick in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft. In addition, the Red Wings sent center Vladislav Namestnikov to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft. Detroit now holds 18 selections in the next two NHL Entry Drafts. In 44 games with the Griffins, Witkowski logged seven points (3-4—7), 62 penalty minutes and a plus-six rating. Sundqvist, 27, has skated in 41 games with the Blues this season, recording 15 points (4-11-15), 12 penalty minutes and a plus-four rating. Walman, 26, has suited up in 32 contests for St. Louis this campaign, tallying six points (3-3-6), six penalty minutes and a plus-three rating. Both Sundqvust (selected 81st overall by Pittsburgh in 2012) and Walman (selected 82nd overall by St. Louis in 2014) were drafted in the third round of the NHL Entry Draft.\n\nRoad Trip!: The Griffins have set off on their season-high five-game road trip. Grand Rapids began the stretch with a 5-1 defeat at Rockford on Saturday. The Griffins will now head west to California for two games apiece against Bakersfield and Ontario. Grand Rapids went on a four-game trip earlier in the season and finished with a 2-2 mark. The Griffins are 12-12-1-1 this season away from West Michigan while they are 14-13-4-1 at home. Grand Rapids will play 12 of its remaining 18 games on foreign ice."
