        "text": "After eight seasons as a member of the Carolina Hurricanes, Justin Faulk joined the St. Louis Blues on September 24 before the start of the 2019-20 season. The Blues received Faulk In exchange for Joel Edmundson, Dominik Bokk, and a seventh-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft –a significant price for St. Louis. General manager Doug Armstrong saw a need to reinforce his blue line, so the sum for Faulk was one he was willing to pay. Armstrong promptly signed Faulk to a seven-year, $45.5 million contract extension, and, over halfway through the season, Faulk continues to prove his worth.\n\nA native of South St. Paul, Minnesota, Faulk played for the United States National Team Development Program for two seasons before joining the University of Minnesota Duluth for one season. Drafted 37th overall by the Hurricanes, he made the immediate jump to the NHL in the 2011-12 season, suiting up for 66 games. He held the blue line consistently in the Hurricanes’ sweater for eight seasons, serving as one of their top defensemen who could play in all situations.\n\nIt was this experience and steadiness that made Faulk an appealing and valuable addition to the Blues. “Justin comes with a very deep and strong resume, a player that’s played in the League for a number of years…a skater, someone that can transport and move the puck, touches both ends of special teams and has logged a lot of minutes over the years,” said GM Armstrong.\n\nOver halfway through the regular season, it would seem that Armstrong’s vision for Faulk has panned out. A solid force on the back-end, Faulk has played in all 59 games this season, averaging over 20 minutes of ice time per game. He plays in all situations, even strength, power play, and penalty kill. While some were worried about adding another right-shot defenseman to the defensive group, Faulk has played alongside different partners throughout the season, including right-handed captain Alex Pietrangelo, demonstrating he can handle playing his off-side. Faulk has provided the Blues coaching staff with options, making the defensive core more versatile.\n\nFaulk has also taken pressure off the Blues’ top defensemen by eating up ice time and shutting down opponents’ best forwards. Rather than requiring top defensemen like Pietrangelo, Colton Parayko, or Jay Bouwmeester to play an exhaustive amount, Faulk easily plays 20+ minutes, alleviating some burden from the Blues’ defenders. Dispersing the strain across multiple, reliable defensemen strengthens the Blues overall. Faulk has also created the space for younger players like budding-star Vince Dunn and rookie Niko Mikkola to gain experience and learn from veterans.\n\nNow, more than ever, Faulk’s value shines through. Veteran defenseman Bouwmeester suffered a scary cardiac episode last Tuesday versus the Anaheim Ducks. The 36-year-old returned to St. Louis after remaining in Anaheim for a successful heart procedure to regulate his heart’s rhythm. Bouwmeester averaged over 21 minutes and played in every game this season. Those numbers are not easily made up, but the addition of Faulk has certainly made Bouwmeester’s departure more manageable.\n\nOffensively, Faulk has not produced to the same degree as he did in Carolina. With four goals and 10 assists, he is on pace for 19 points this season, well below his average of 32. This offensive drop is expected. The Blues are known more for their shutdown defense rather than their run and gun offense. Also, after playing on the same team for eight seasons, it will take time to adjust to new systems. While offensively there remains production to be desired, Faulk has contributed significantly in less apparent ways.\n\nThe exciting news is that Justin Faulk will remain in St. Louis for seven years following this season. He turns 28 next month, meaning that he will spend prime years of his career on the Blues’ blue line. Furthermore, Faulk’s play this season indicates that his trajectory aims upward. He has demonstrated his ability to serve as key component of the Blues’ defense, logging minutes against high-end forwards. The offensive production will come. For now, his value lies in adding versatility and depth to the St. Louis Blues’ lineup. With the postseason fast approaching, Faulk’s role will only increase in importance as the Blues make another run for the Stanley Cup."
