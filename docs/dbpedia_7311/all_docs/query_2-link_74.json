        "text": "At the tail end of an hour-long conversation with The Athletic early this offseason, Blues general manager Doug Armstrong was asked one final question: “No matter what you do, there are many fans who will come to the conclusion: ‘In Army I trust!’ What do you think when you hear that?”\n\nSitting up in his chair at a St. Louis-area coffee shop, Armstrong replied, “Well, obviously, I’m thankful for it. But you can’t have it both ways. You can’t believe when they say, ‘In Army we trust,’ and then not believe it when they say, ‘Army’s an a–hole!'”\n\nThe 58-year-old GM’s cheeks creased up as he laughed out loud.\n\n“You’ve got to just take it for what it is,” he added. “I think it was (former NFL coach) Marv Levy who had one of my favorite quotes: ‘Once you start thinking like a fan, you will be a fan.’ So I appreciate the support, but the support they give me, they’re giving the players. This truly is a player-based business, and any success that we’ve had is on the backs of the players.”\n\nWell if that’s the case, Armstrong still does deserve a good amount of the credit, because he has brought a lot of good players to St. Louis since taking over for Larry Pleau in 2010. In the past 13 seasons, the Blues have a record of 558-331-106, with the fifth-most wins and points (1,222) in the NHL. They’ve made the playoffs in 10 of those 13 seasons and, of course, brought the city its first Stanley Cup victory four years ago today.\n\nIt’s been a decade-plus of sustained success under the man who is now the longest-tenured GM in the league.\n\nTo chronicle it, The Athletic went back and reviewed each season with Armstrong — getting into all of the significant signings, trades, hirings and firings. There were bold decisions, lessons learned and a few trends.\n\nThis three-part series will cover 2010 to 2016 in part 1, 2017 to 2022 in part 2, and then we’ll hear from former Blues players and coaches about the impact Armstrong has had on the organization in part 3.\n\nWith the NHL Draft on June 28 and 29 and free agency following on July 1, revisiting this history should give us a guide for how Armstrong and the Blues will approach their next phase.\n\nIn 2008, then-Blues president of hockey operations John Davidson was looking for a GM to succeed Pleau. The candidates included Armstrong, who had recently been fired in Dallas, and Dave Nonis, who had likewise been let go in Vancouver.\n\n“J.D. called me, and I came and stayed at his house,” Armstrong recalled. “His wife (Diana) was unreal. They treated me so well, and it just felt like a really good place. There were some teams calling, and I wanted to be selfish at that point. I had a son (Blake) in Grade 9 and a daughter (Kayla) in Grade 7, and I wanted to put them in an environment where they could flourish. My goal when I signed here was to get both of my kids through high school. That was my priority, quite honestly, and then it was to pick the best team.”\n\nArmstrong felt the Blues had already been through the pain. They finished last in the NHL standings in 2005-06, which got them Erik Johnson as the No. 1 pick in the 2006 draft. They also moved veterans Keith Tkachuk and Bill Guerin in 2007, giving them three first-round picks that summer.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, with the horizon looking bright, Armstrong was hired as the “GM in waiting.” The arrangement had him taking over full-time for Pleau in 2010, which gave Armstrong two years to become familiar with the organization and begin to lay out his blueprint.\n\n“They were coming off an unreal run by Larry and their group — 25 straight years in the playoffs — and the fans didn’t know how to react,” Armstrong said. “The attendance had dropped down, and they were looking for something they could believe in.\n\n“(Former amateur scouting director) Jarmo Kekalainen and his staff did an unreal job getting the players. Accumulating assets is important, but knowing what to do with the assets at the right time is (the key). Every player you draft can’t play for you, but every player you draft, if they’re good enough, is an asset.”\n\nOn that line of thinking, Armstrong was behind the Blues’ trade of 2007 first-round pick Lars Eller to Montreal for goalie Jaroslav Halak on June 17, 2010. A week later at the draft, he dealt first-round pick David Rundblad to Ottawa for the No. 16 pick, which the club used on Vladimir Tarasenko.\n\n“I look at the Tarasenko trade as a prime example,” Armstrong said. “I remember saying to Jarmo, ‘You took Erik Johnson, then Alex Pietrangelo, then Rundblad (in 2009) — three skilled right-handed defensemen. So a year later, we were able to turn Rundblad into Tarasenko. If you don’t take a player that has value to other organizations, you can’t make that trade.”\n\nThen came the big one, on Feb. 19, 2011 — Johnson and a first-round pick to Colorado for Chris Stewart and Kevin Shattenkirk.\n\nJohnson had been involved in the golf cart accident that required knee surgery and caused him to miss the 2008-09 season, so his shine had worn off a bit. But at the time, the move was still shocking to many in St. Louis and spoke volumes about Armstrong’s backbone.\n\n“I don’t really look at the reaction to trades,” he said. “Once it’s done, it’s done. I learned quite early in Dallas, working under Bob Gainey with highly competitive teams, that decisions are made and half the people are going to be happy and half the people are unhappy. I just felt that’s that what we needed to do to move our group forward.\n\n“We had Pietrangelo, and Shattenkirk was a different defenseman, and we wanted the power forward in (Chris) Stewart, who was coming off a great year. Again, it was trying to build a team more than just accumulate as many assets as you could.”\n\nThe Blues didn’t qualify for the playoffs in Armstrong’s first year at the helm. He felt they needed something — not something that would get them into the postseason quicker, but something that would help build the culture.\n\n“I think the greatest thing as a GM is to know what you don’t have, and at that time, it was bringing in people that had won before, bringing in captains,” said Armstrong. So he signed veterans Jamie Langenbrunner and Jason Arnott on the same day — July 6, 2011.\n\n“Arnott scored a Stanley Cup-winning goal for New Jersey (in 2000) when I was in Dallas, and then Langenbrunner, he was captain of Team USA at the Olympics and a two-time Stanley Cup winner,” Armstrong said. “That stuff doesn’t happen by accident, so when they walk in the room, they walk in with credibility. I thought that was really important for our group.”\n\nMeanwhile, Armstrong was also keeping an eye on the Blues’ coaching. Davis Payne had taken over for Andy Murray in 2010, and at age 41, he was beginning just his second full season behind the bench in 2011-12. The team’s start that year would be important, and when they opened with a record of 6-7, a decision was made to replace Payne with Ken Hitchcock.\n\n“Davis was a young coach and we had young players, and we needed an experienced leader,” Armstrong said. “It was tongue-in-cheek, but I said, ‘It’s awful getting off the bus (on the road) and no one knows where the locker room is.’ We were all learning at the same time.\n\n“I felt like we needed a leader in our locker room, and I also think bringing in Ken gave the players an understanding about who I felt should be the leader, and it was the coach. He believes if you do the journey correctly, the results will follow. We needed someone that really enjoyed the journey, and that was Hitch.”\n\nIt worked. The Blues went 43-15-11 under Hitchcock the rest of the regular season for 109 points, earning him the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s coach of the year. The Blues returned to the playoffs, winning a first-round series against San Jose, but they weren’t there yet, getting swept by Los Angeles in the second round. It was only slightly comforting that the Kings went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\n“I think when Ken came in, you could trick yourself into thinking you’re closer than you were,” Armstrong said. “We got slapped in the face pretty quick by L.A. We looked like we were really coming, but we had no scars, no battle-tested wounds.”\n\nBut before the Blues added more scars, they parted with their president. The club and Davidson agreed to go in different directions, and a year later, Armstrong, while already making all of the hockey decisions, was officially given the dual title of president of hockey operations and GM.\n\n“It was difficult to see J.D. go, but you knew he’s going to land on his feet real quick,” Armstrong said. “I was really impressed that he got back in that saddle as the president of hockey operations (in Columbus). The easiest thing for his life would have been just to move back into television. He would have gone back as the No. 1 color guy in our game, but he had that drive to keep going.”\n\nThis was now Armstrong’s baby, and he would continue making moves to try to get the Blues closer. Late in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, he made the trade with Calgary for defenseman Jay Bouwmeester, hoping to give Pietrangelo a more stable defensive partner.\n\n“I thought Petro, if not a star at that time, was very close to being a star,” Armstrong said. “It just seemed like a no-brainer to acquire someone you could see a vision where he and your best defenseman could form a bond and the partnership.”\n\nThat season ended in another playoff loss to L.A., but the Blues re-signed Bouwmeester to a five-year, $27 million contract extension.\n\nBack to a full 82-game schedule in 2013-14, the Blues put together a regular season with the most wins in franchise history (52) and most points (111) since 1999-00. Once again, though, Armstrong was hoping to get them over the postseason hump.\n\nSo on Feb. 28, 2014, he traded for Buffalo goalie Ryan Miller. The 33-year-old netminder, who had backstopped Team USA to a silver medal in 2010, was swapped in a package that included Halak.\n\nAfter a good start for Miller in St. Louis, though, the move backfired. In a first-round playoff series loss to Chicago, he went 2-4 with a 2.70 goals-against average and an .897 save percentage.\n\n“I may have overthought that one, quite honestly,” Armstrong said. “When you’re in the moment, we had good goaltending, but we didn’t have a star. I didn’t really see another area that I could bring a player in and show the players how much we believed in them. I thought Miller, coming off the Olympics, what he’d accomplished, he could give us that shot of adrenaline down the stretch that, ‘Wow, this organization believes this is the year.’\n\n“You do get wrapped up into (the fact that) the organization hadn’t been in the semifinals in a long time. I just thought that was the perfect player at the right time, and for whatever reason, it didn’t work for him here. Who knows what would’ve happened if we did nothing, lost in the first round, and Ryan Miller goes somewhere else and wins a Cup. I’d be kicking myself.”\n\nInstead, the end result would impact the GM’s decision-making process in the future when considering deadline roster additions.\n\n“I learned to make sure you’re filling a need and you’re not just doing something to be on TSN,” Armstrong said.\n\nSome may recall that in 2019, Armstrong’s only addition to what looked like a Stanley Cup-contending team was defenseman Michael Del Zotto. He knew from the Miller experience that standing pat could pay off, and it did.\n\nFive years earlier, in 2014-15, though, the Blues still weren’t as close as they thought to winning a Cup. They had a 51-win, 109-point regular season and were favored in their first-round playoff series against Minnesota but got beat in six games.\n\n“That was disappointing because we brought in two Hall of Fame top 100 people in Bob Gainey and Marty Brodeur to our group,” Armstrong said. “I believe strongly in your inner circle. I’ve been in hockey my whole life, but I’ve never played one shift in the NHL. So when I can say something to a player, I think they respect it. But when it comes from a guy that’s one of the top 100 players of all time, it just has a different feel to it.\n\n“I remember having those guys talk to the players. We were trying to un-turn every stone at that point because I thought that was our time to start winning Cups. It was very painful because I had thought we got hardened in the Chicago series. I thought we got hardened in the L.A. series. And then in that series, it felt like we weren’t learning our lessons quickly enough.”\n\nThat summer, the Blues went looking to make a trade. They were close to a deal that would have sent Oshie and Shattenkirk to San Jose for Tomas Hertl and the No. 9 pick in the 2015 draft (which became Timo Meier), according to league sources at the time, but the Sharks backed out.\n\n“There’s a ton of trades that people don’t know about that could or couldn’t have happened,” Armstrong said. “Some come to fruition and some don’t. I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about them.”\n\nOn July 2, 2015, the Blues sent Oshie to Washington for veteran forward Troy Brouwer and goalie Pheonix Copley. There was talk they were trying to break up the “country club” atmosphere in the locker room, which Oshie was thought to be part of, but Armstrong says that there was a lot more to it.\n\n“We weren’t having success the way we were going, so it was twofold,” he said. “Oshie certainly wasn’t the problem, but he hadn’t been part of the solution, either. He was one of 50 guys in hockey operations who were not part of the solution. It just felt like the definition of insanity — like, just bang your head, keep doing the same thing over and over again and think that’s going to change.\n\n“It had a lot to do with the business side, too. We had young players coming up for contracts like (Jaden) Schwartz and (Vladimir) Tarasenko, and the cap was only going up so much. We also wanted to bring in a player in Brouwer that we thought could make a difference for us — a different style of player, a proven winner, a Stanley Cup winner.”\n\nBrouwer did make a difference, scoring the clinching goal in Game 7 of the Blues’ first-round series against Chicago in 2015-16. That propelled them to the second round against Dallas, which they also beat in seven games, and onto the Western Conference final against San Jose.\n\nIt was the Blues’ first trip to a conference final since 2001, and optimism was high that they’d be headed back to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1970. But the team looked tired toward the end of the series against the Sharks and lost in six games.\n\nAside from the anguish of losing, the visual from that night was Blues captain David Backes, a free agent that offseason, sobbing as he spoke to the media afterward. He knew it could be his last game with the organization, and that turned out to be the case.\n\nArmstrong, keeping emotion out of the negotiations, initially offered Backes a three-year contract term and eventually went to four, but he wouldn’t go any longer. So the 31-year-old forward went to free agency and got a five-year, $30 million deal in Boston.\n\nIt turned out to be a wise decision by the Blues, as Backes’ physical style of play led to a precipitous decline in his game and eventually led to the Bruins trading him to Anaheim before the fifth year of the deal.\n\n“These were months-long discussions, and you get to a point where you know (Backes) thinks it’s not right for him and we think it’s not right for the franchise, and you agree to disagree,” Armstrong said. “But it’s something that within the organization has been vetted, discussed, vetted, discussed.\n\n“I learned from watching the NFL that in a pre-cap system, you can have ‘thank you’ contracts (paying players for past performance). In a cap system, it’s very difficult to do. (In 2019, when the Blues won the Cup), you might give another year or two on a contract because you’re rewarding what that group did. But when you haven’t had the ultimate success (like in 2015-16), you’re really questioning what you’re rewarding.”\n\nA theme throughout the first six years of Armstrong’s construction of the Blues was making difficult decisions and always keeping an eye on the future. In addition to letting Backes walk that summer, he traded goalie Brian Elliott to Calgary for a second-round pick, which was used to take Jordan Kyrou.\n\n“I know a lot of people thought we were crazy not re-signing Backes and trading Elliott, but Backes turns into cap space to do different things and Elliott turns into Kyrou,” Armstrong said. “Sometimes you have to take a longer-term vision, and it’s painful, but that’s what I think is the responsibility of the manager.”\n\n(Top photo: Jeff Roberson / Associated Press)"
