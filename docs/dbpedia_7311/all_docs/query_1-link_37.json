        "text": "Two OJHL players, Matthew Cairns (pictured at 2016 NHL Draft after being selected by the Edmonton Oilers - photo credit: Dan Hickling/Hickling Images) and Patrick Kudla, lead a charge of 73 OJHL Alumni that are chasing their NHL dreams by attending NHL Development Camps this summer.\n\nMatthew Cairns - Toronto Patriots/Georgetown Raiders, 2014-16\n\nEdmonton Oilers - 3rd Round, 84th overall - 2016 NHL Draft\n\nThe 18-year old joined the Raiders this season after capturing an OJHL Championship as a rookie with the Toronto Patriots last season. Standing at 6'2\", while also possessing speed and mobility, has made the scouts take notice and Cairns has continued to add to his hockey repertoire throughout his sophomore campaign.\n\n\"Matthew is an offensive puck-moving defenceman who possesses good size and is a strong, mobile skater,\" said Director of NHL Central Scouting Dan Marr. \"He has good offensive instincts and a good first pass game; totaled 24 assists this year. Cairns makes good decisions under pressure and is a very good size/strength and one-on-one defender. Capable to play in any situation and can pass and shoot with authority. He has used his time in the OJHL to develop his overall game and prepare himself for the next stage of his hockey career.\"\n\nCairns' championship experience was counted on by the Raiders in all situations this season as he more than tripled his career offensive-highs with 9 goals, 24 assists and 33 points in 46 games played to lead the club's defensive corps in scoring, as well as rank 12th, 16th and 18th respectively among all league rearguards. Manning the point for Georgetown on both special teams units, Cairns led all OJHL defencemen with two shorthanded goals and registered 15 power play points to rank third on the Raiders, while also notching two game-winning goals during the season. His play helped the club captured the OJHL West Division and South-West Conference Regular Season title this season.\n\nOther highlights of Cairns' impressive sophomore campaign included being named a member of Team OJHL Nieuwendyk for the 2015 Eastern Canada Cup All-Star Challenge that was held in Cornwall, Ontario. His efforts throughout the season and the All-Star tournament ultimately helped him also earn a spot on Team Canada East at the 2015 World Junior 'A' Challenge that was held in Cobourg and Whitby, Ontario. In January, Cairns received another pair of accolades as he was first listed tops among OJHL players, 93rd overall among North American skaters, by NHL Central Scouting in their Mid-Term Rankings for the 2016 NHL Draft, and then was named to Team East for the 2016 CJHL Prospects Game held in Surrey, B.C. Cairns is committed to join the Cornell University Raiders beginning with the 2017-18 ECAC season.\n\nPatrick Kudla - Wellington Dukes/Oakville Blades - 2013/14, 2015/16\n\nArizona Coyotes - 6th Round, 158th overall - 2016 NHL Draft\n\nKudla led all OJHL rearguards with 66 points on the season, which was the 14th best total by a defenceman in league history.\n\nReturning to the OJHL in 2015-16 after last playing for the Wellington Dukes in 2013-14, Kudla spearheaded a Blades' offensive attack that saw the club finish third in the OJHL with 231 goals scored, as well as with the third best power play unit, firing at a 23.39% success rate. The club's offensive prowess helped capture the South Division regular season crown; the Blades’ first since winning the West Division title in 2007-08.\n\nThe Guelph, Ontario native played in all key situations for the Blades this season, getting off to a hot start by being named the OJHL Gongshow Gear South-West Conference Player-of-the-Month for October, and never looked back leading all defencemen in scoring during the season with 53 assists and 66 points in 50 games played, which was the 14th best total in league history. Kudla's 53 assists also topped all OJHL players this season, four more than scoring champion Luc Brown; and was the tenth best total by a defenceman in league history. Tied for seventh in the overall league scoring race, also third on the Blades, the OJHL 1st Team All-Star commanded the league's third best power play and again led all players with 25 power play assists, while finishing second with 29 power play points. Not one to shy away from the physical aspect of the game, Kudla also led Oakville and tied for 14th in the OJHL with 86 penalty minutes.\n\nKudla's early season play and Player-of-the-Month Award earned him a spot on Team OJHL Hawerchuk at the 2015 Eastern Canada Cup All-Star Challenge that took place in Cornwall, Ontario, where he registered two points in four games played. Originally selected by the Plymouth Whalers in the 11th round, 221st overall of the 2012 OHL Priority Selection, Kudla confirmed his commitment earlier in the year to join the NCAA Division I, Arizona State University Sun Devils (currently independent) beginning with the 2017-18 season.\n\nJoining Cairns and Kudla in taking part in NHL Development Camps this summer are 73 OJHL Alumni.\n\nLeading the way is the Georgetown Raiders and Toronto Patriots, who each have 8 players attending NHL Camps this summer. The two clubs are followed closely by the St. Michael's Buzzers with 7 players and the Aurora Tigers, Cobourg Cougars and Oakville Blades, who each have 6 players attending camps.\n\nFrom an NHL perspective, the Florida Panthers top the charts with 8 OJHL Alumni attending their development camp. The Panthers are followed by the Columbus Blue Jackets, Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs, who each have 5 former OJHLers attending.\n\nBelow is the full list of OJHL Alumni at summer NHL Development Camps:\n\nAnaheim Ducks\n\nT.J.
