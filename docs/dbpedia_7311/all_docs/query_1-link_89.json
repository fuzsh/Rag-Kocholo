        "text": "With the Christmas roster freeze now in the rearview mirror, we’re starting to see some activity as General Managers tweak their lineups for the playoff run.\n\n****UPDATE***\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers made a baffling trade today…sending Mark Arcobello to the Nashville Predators for Derek Roy.\n\nOn the surface it seems like a slight upgrade at centre but, if you look a little deeper, it’s just squandering another asset.\n\nRoy was PPG+ player with the Buffalo Sabres 7 seasons ago but his best season in the last 5 was in 2011/12 when he scored 17 goals and 44 points. It’s been all downhill since then.\n\nRoy spent the following 3 seasons bouncing around from the Dallas Stars to the Vancouver Canucks (where he was invisible) to the St. Louis Blues and now to the Predators. In 26 games this season he has scored ONE goal and 10 points.\n\nArcobello has scored SEVEN goals and 12 points this season so there is very little reason to believe Roy will do much of anything to kick start the Oilers moribund offence.\n\nRoy is UFA at the end of the season and I highly doubt he’ll re-sign with the Oilers so MacTavish is basically sending away an asset for 3 months of blah.\n\nNow, some are arguing that the Oilers did the right thing to get a contract off their 50 man list but that’s only a factor if the team is expecting to add a few more bodies during this season.\n\nThis pretty is much the definition of re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic and is likely meant to indicate the Oilers are “doing something” to appease the fan base.\n\nBut it does nothing to improve the hockey team.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers also picked Matt Fraser off the waiver wire this morning after the Boston Bruins waived him to make room for the callup of Jordan Caron.\n\nMeanwhile, the St. Louis Blues have given up trying to find an NHL player in Magnus Paajarvi after the former Oilers’ 10th overall pick was a healthy scratch in 25 games this season and managed to score only 1 point in the 10 games he did play.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks also placed Dany Heatley on waivers which likely spells the end of his NHL career. Heatley only played 6 games for the Ducks and it’s apparent that the speed of the game has passed him by.\n\nThe big news of the days however is reports from multiple sources that Colorado Avalanche centre Ryan O’Reilly is being shopped.\n\nThe split between center Ryan O’Reilly and theColorado Avalanche is inevitable. Too much vitriol under the bridge in previous contract squabbles.He’s signed through 2016 at a pretty good clip; after that, it’s UFA status and Denver in the rearview mirror.\n\nSo with the Avs nine points out of a playoff spot and desperately needing a blueline upgrade (seriously, their firmware is like two years out of date), perhaps the Ryan O’Reilly trade window is opening for the rest of the NHL.\n\nAt least that’s what former Denver Post writer Adrian Dater is reporting:\n\nO’Reilly being offered around the league for a good D-man. Florida and Winnipeg. Pondering, Toronto and Montreal too\n\n— Adrian Dater (@adater) December 28, 2014\n\nPeople might publicly deny it, but O’Reilly is definitely in play again on the market\n\n— Adrian Dater (@adater) December 28, 2014\n\nThinking about possible destinations for O’Reilly, I believe that Toronto might be a good fit.\n\nThere are persistent rumours that the Leafs are thinking about trading Jake Gardiner or Cody Franson and that James Reimer could also be on the move.\n\nO’Reilly is an Ontario native and is precisely what the Leafs need and, if acquired, the Leafs would be in a position to trade Nazem Kadri for additional help.\n\nThe Avalanche, meanwhile, add a defenseman, a reliable backup goaltender and free themselves from O’Reilly’s $6 million cap hit.\n\nMore later in the day….."
