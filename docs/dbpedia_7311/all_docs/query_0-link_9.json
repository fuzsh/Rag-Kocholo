        "text": "June 17, 2024 Elliott is joining the Blues as a scout and development coach, officially marking the end of his NHL playing career. - Elliott spent 16 years in the NHL with five of those as a Blue. He also played for Ottawa, Philadelphia, Colorado, Calgary and, most recently, Tampa Bay. The 39-year-old went 279-167-54 with a .909 save percentage and a 2.57 GAA in 543 career appearances. Elliott ended his career with a 32-save shutout against Detroit on April 13, 2023. None April 13, 2023 Per Gabby Shirley of Bally Sports Florida, Elliott was the first goalie off the ice at morning skate, putting him on track to guard the home goal versus the Red Wings on Thursday. - Elliott has struggled over the past week, going 0-2-0 while posting an unsightly 6.06 GAA and .852 save percentage. He'll try to snap his personal three-game losing streak in a home matchup with a struggling Detroit team that's lost four straight contests. None April 8, 2023 Elliott was the first goalie off the ice at the morning skate, Gabby Shirley of Bally Sports Florida reports, indicating he will start in Ottawa on Saturday. - Elliott has surrendered six goals in each of his past two outings, including a 7-2 loss to the Senators on March 23. He has posted a record of 11-7-2 this season with a 3.43 GAA and an .888 save percentage in 20 appearances. Ottawa ranks 19th in the league this campaign with 3.11 goals per game. None April 6, 2023 Elliott made 36 saves in a 6-1 loss to the Islanders on Thursday. - Bolts' coach Jon Cooper didn't mince words after the game, talking about his team putting in its second straight embarrassing performance. Elliott tried to do his part, but it's hard to be the only guy on his team that shows up. The Bolts have just three games left this season -- Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday -- to get their game together. It remains to be seen if Andrei Vasilevskiy will get all three or if Elliott perhaps starts one. None April 5, 2023 Elliott will be between the road pipes versus the Islanders on Thursday, Dan Rosen of NHL.com reports. - With the Lightning heading into their final back-to-back of the season, this could be the last start for Elliott this season. The veteran netminder is sporting an 11-6-2 record with a 3.30 GAA, .891 save percentage and one shutout in 19 appearances. Once the postseason kicks off, Andrei Vasilevskiy will be the preferred choice in the crease for coach Jon Cooper. None March 23, 2023 Elliott is expected to start on the road against Ottawa on Thursday, per TSN 1200 Ottawa. - Elliott has won his last two contests, saving 40 of 44 shots in that span. He has an 11-5-2 record, 3.15 GAA and .895 save percentage in 18 appearances this season. Ottawa has been struggling, losing five of its last six to drop to 34-32-5. None March 18, 2023 Elliott will get the home crease versus Montreal on Saturday, Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site reports. - Elliott picked up his first win in five starts March 11, stopping 22 shots in a 3-1 victory over Chicago. He is 10-5-2 with a 3.16 GAA and .896 save percentage. Elliott faces the Canadiens, who are 28th in NHL scoring, averaging 2.77 goals per contest. None March 11, 2023 Elliott was the first goaltender off the ice at practice Saturday, indicating he will be the starter versus Chicago, Gabby Shirley of Bally Sports Florida reports. - Elliott has been on the bench the last three games following a performance in which he gave up five goals on 34 shots in a 5-3 loss to Buffalo. Elliott is 9-5-2 with a 3.29 GAA and .894 save percentage this season. He will face the Blackhawks, who are the lowest scoring team in the NHL, averaging 2.49 goals per game. None March 4, 2023 Elliott made 29 saves in Saturday's 5-3 loss to Buffalo. - The Lightning grabbed a 1-0 lead midway through the first period but then watched the Sabres score five straight times, with two of the tallies coming on Buffalo power plays. Elliott hasn't won a game in over a month, going 0-2-2 over his last four starts, and on the season the veteran netminder carries a shaky 3.29 GAA and .894 save percentage. None Feb. 26, 2023 Elliott will defend the road net Sunday against Pittsburgh, Penguins radio play-by-play announcer Josh Getzoff reports. - Elliott has a 9-3-2 record this season with a 2.90 GAA and a .904 save percentage. He will get the second half of Tampa Bay's back-to-back after Andrei Vasilevskiy played in Saturday's 3-0 win over Detroit. The Penguins sit 15th in the league this campaign with 3.17 goals per game. None Feb. 15, 2023 Elliott recorded a 26-save shutout but took a 1-0 shootout loss to the Coyotes on Wednesday. - A battle of the backups turned into a goaltending duel, as Elliott and Connor Ingram (47 saves) kept the puck away from the twine for 65 minutes. While it came in a shootout loss, this was Elliott's first shutout of the season -- he has at least one in each of the last 13 campaigns. The 37-year-old veteran is now at 9-3-2 with a 2.90 GAA and a .904 save percentage through 14 appearances this season. Only four of his starts have come outside of back-to-back situations, so it's safe to assume Elliott's playing time will remain sparse as long as Andrei Vasilevskiy is healthy. None Feb. 7, 2023 Elliott will guard the home goal in Tuesday's game versus the Sharks, Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site reports. - This will be Elliott's first action since Jan. 18. The Lightning took a significant 7-1 loss to the Panthers on Monday in their first game back from the break, but Elliott should have a good chance at a win since he's facing an opponent that's averaged 3.06 goals per game this season, ranking 20th in the league. None Jan. 18, 2023 Elliott is expected to start on the road against Vancouver, Eduardo A. Encina of the Tampa Bay Times reports. - Elliott has an 8-3-0 record, 3.17 GAA and .897 save percentage in 11 contests this season. He last played Jan. 4 when he stopped 28 of 32 shots in a 5-1 loss to Minnesota. The Canucks have the eighth-ranked offense with 3.40 goals per game. None Jan. 4, 2023 Elliott will guard the road goal Wednesday versus the Wild, Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site reports. - The Lightning previously confirmed Andrei Vasilevskiy as the starting goalie in a since-deleted Tweet. Elliott allowed one goal on 26 shots in a 4-1 win over the Blackhawks on Tuesday. It's still odd to see him start on back-to-back nights, which suggests something may be off with Vasilevskiy. This will be a tougher matchup for Elliott, especially given the quick turnaround between appearances. None Jan. 3, 2023 Elliott will guard the road goal Tuesday versus the Blackhawks, Eduardo A. Encina of the Tampa Bay Times reports. - Elliott will start the first half of a back-to-back set, and he'll get the easier opponent Tuesday rather than facing the Wild on Wednesday. The 37-year-old has gone 7-2-0 with a 3.31 GAA and an .894 save percentage, and this is one of the best matchups he could get, so he'll be a solid streaming option Tuesday. None Dec. 21, 2022 Elliott is expected to guard the road net against Detroit on Wednesday, per Eduardo A. Encina of the Tampa Bay Times. - Elliott has a 7-1-0 record, 3.10 GAA and .902 save percentage in eight contests this season. He's saved 58 of 61 shots over his last two games. The Red Wings have lost their last six contests, which has brought them down to 13-11-7 this season. None Dec. 16, 2022 Elliott made 24 saves in Thursday's 4-1 win over the Blue Jackets. - Aside from a Kirill Marchenko tally in the second period, Elliott had an answer for everything Columbus threw at him in a fairly comfortable victory. Since taking the loss in his first start of the season Elliott has won seven straight, posting a 2.82 GAA and .905 save percentage over that stretch, but the 37-year-old poses little threat to Andrei Vasilevskiy's spot as the Lightning's No. 1 goalie. None Dec. 15, 2022 Elliott will be between the pipes against Columbus at home Thursday, Gabby Shirley of Bally Sports Florida reports. - Elliott will be making his eighth appearance of the season, having gone 6-1-0 with a 3.39 GAA in his previous seven contests. Despite a less-than-stellar GAA and save percentage (.895), the backup netminder continues to rack up victories for the club. Still, regardless of how well he plays, Elliott won't challenge starter Andrei Vasilevskiy for the No. 1 job. None Dec. 8, 2022 Elliott was the first goaltender off the ice and will get the start at home versus Nashville on Thursday, Erik Erlendsson of LightningInsider.com reports. - Elliott has been a winner this season, although his peripherals leave a lot to be desired thus far. Elliott is 5-1-0 with a 3.62 GAA and an .886 save percentage. He will face the Predators, who found the back of the net only 63 times in 23 games this season. None Nov. 28, 2022 Elliott will guard the road goal Monday against Buffalo, Eduardo A. Encina of the Tampa Bay Times reports. - Elliott has won his past four outings, including a 28-save effort in 5-4 overtime win over Dallas on Nov. 15 during his last appearance. He has a 4-1-0 record this season with a 3.37 GAA and an .891 save percentage. Elliott will get the first half of Tampa Bay's back-to-back, which likely sets up Andrei Vasilevskiy to face Boston on Tuesday. None Nov. 15, 2022 Elliot will be between the pipes when the Lightning host the Stars on Tuesday, per Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site. - It'll be Elliot's first start since Nov. 5 as he continues to backup Andrei Vasilevskiy. The veteran netminder is 3-1-0 on the season, picking up wins in his last three outings, with a .895 save percentage. None Nov. 5, 2022 Elliott will guard the home cage against Buffalo on Saturday, according to Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site. - Elliott will get his first start in four games as Andrei Vasilevskiy gets the night off. Elliott is 2-1-0 this season, having given up 10 goals on 100 shots. He'll face the Sabres, who have been surprisingly good this year, going 7-4-0 while averaging 4.18 goals per game. None Oct. 26, 2022 Elliot is expected to start against Anaheim on Wednesday, per Ducks PA Announcer Phil Hulett. - Elliot was the first Lightning goalie out for the pregame warmups. He's firmly in the backup role, but Tampa Bay is sending him out because Andrei Vasilevskiy started in Tuesday's 4-2 loss to Los Angeles. Anaheim has gotten off to a rough 1-4-1 start, so Elliot has a good chance of coming out ahead Wednesday night. None Oct. 22, 2022 Elliott will play between the pipes Saturday against the Islanders, per Andrew Gross of Newsday. - Elliott led the Lightning out for the pregame warmups. With Andrei Vasilevskiy as the team's No. 1 option, Elliott's starts are naturally going to be few and far between. The Islanders aren't a great offensive team though and Tampa Bay does have the home ice advantage, so at least Elliott's been given an opponent he has a good chance of standing tall against. None Oct. 14, 2022 Elliott is slated to guard the road goal Saturday when the Lightning face the Penguins, according to Chris Krenn of the Lightning's official site. - Andrei Vasilevskiy is playing Friday against the Blue Jackets. That should put Elliott between the pipes for his first start of the season in the back half of back-to-back contests. Elliott went 11-4-3 with a 2.43 GAA and a .912 save percentage for Tampa Bay last season. It won't be easy for Elliott on Saturday, as he'll be facing a Penguins team that scored six goals Thursday in an easy win over the Coyotes. None Sept. 29, 2022 Elliott will start Thursday's preseason game versus the Predators, Gabby Shirley of Bally Sports Florida reports. - Elliott enters the 2022-23 campaign as the presumptive backup to superstar goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. While Elliott's role is secure, he's likely to see only 20-25 games during the season, so he's not on the season-long fantasy radar except as a streaming option when he starts. None April 28, 2022 Elliott made 30 saves in a 5-2 loss to the Blue Jackets on Thursday night. - He's now 12-11-4 with a 2.43 GAA and .912 save percentage this season. Elliott just couldn't bail out the poor defensive play of his teammates -- they simply gave up too many high danger chances. The postseason net belongs to Andrei Vasilevskiy, and Elliott will simply wear the dad cap at the end of the bench. None April 23, 2022 Elliott led the Lightning onto the ice, indicating he'll start Saturday's home game versus the Predators, Eduardo A. Encina of the Tampa Bay Times reports. - Elliott will draw a start in the first half of a back-to-back. He's won his last three appearances, allowing only four goals on 59 shots in that span. None April 16, 2022 Elliott will defend the blue paint during Saturday's home game versus the Jets, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott has been unstoppable recently, picking up back-to-back shutout victories over the Sabres and the Ducks. He'll look to keep rolling in a home matchup with a Winnipeg team that's averaging 2.74 goals per game on the road this year, 22nd in the NHL. None April 15, 2022 Elliott signed a one-year, $900,000 extension with the Lightning on Friday, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott has been excellent for Tampa Bay this season, going 9-3-3 while posting an admirable 2.23 GAA and .921 save percentage. He'll likely once again make around 20 starts as the Lightning's No. 2 option behind Andrei Vasilevskiy in 2022-23. None April 14, 2022 Elliott was perfect in relief with 13 saves in Thursday's 4-3 overtime win over the Ducks. - He replaced starter Andrei Vasilevskiy in the second period after the wheels came off for the Bolts. Elliott stabilized the team and they eventually roared back to get the win. He's been solid of late and could see a bit more action before season's end as Vasilevskiy works out some of the kinks in his game. None April 2, 2022 Elliott will guard the home goal during Saturday's matchup with Montreal, Renaud Lavoie of TVA Sports reports. - Elliott was excellent in his last start last Saturday versus Detroit, stopping 26 of 27 shots en route to a 2-1 win. He'll try to pick up his eighth victory of the year in a highly favorable home matchup with a Canadiens squad that's 8-20-7 on the road this year. None April 1, 2022 Elliott (illness) is dressing as the backup for Friday's tilt with Chicago, per the NHL's media site. - Elliott missed Thursday's practice with a minor illness but he'll be ready for his usual role Friday. The Lightning will be right back in action Saturday against Montreal and the 36-year-old could get the starting nod. None March 31, 2022 Elliott is dealing with a non-COVID illness and was unable to practice Thursday, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - With the Lightning heading into a back-to-back versus Chicago and Montreal on Friday and Saturday, respectively, Elliott's potential absence would certainly complicate things for the Bolts. If he can get back to 100 percent, it seems likely Elliott would take the second game to give him some more time but no starters have been announced yet. If the veteran does need some time off, Max Lagace or Alexei Melnichuk would need to be called up from the minors. None March 27, 2022 Elliott turned aside 26 shots in Saturday's 2-1 overtime win over the Red Wings. - It was a goaltending duel between two unlikely netminders, as neither Elliott nor Alex Nedeljkovic allowed a goal until the third period, but Tampa Bay's power play proved to be the difference. Elliott doesn't get much work behind Andrei Vasilevskiy, but he's been sharp when called upon, going 4-1-0 over five starts so far in 2022 with a 1.80 GAA and .938 save percentage. None March 26, 2022 Elliott will tend the twine for Saturday's road clash with the Red Wings, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott will make just his fifth appearance for the Lightning since the calendar turned to 2022. In his previous four outings, the veteran netminder went 3-1-0 with a 2.01 GAA. Starter Andrei Vasilevskiy figures to continue seeing a heavy workload heading into the final weeks of the season with Elliott likely limited to the back-to-backs. None March 12, 2022 Elliott will guard the road cage during Saturday's matchup with the Oilers, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott was excellent in his last start March 4 versus Detroit, stopping 22 of 23 shots en route to a 3-1 win. He'll try to pick up his seventh victory of the year in a home matchup with an Edmonton team that's averaging 3.15 goals per game at home this season, 15th in the NHL. None March 4, 2022 Elliott will be stationed between the pipes for Friday's home clash with Detroit, Erik Erlendsson of LightningInsider.com reports. - Elliott will make a rare appearance after Andrei Vasilevskiy coughed up five goals in Thursday's loss to Pittsburgh. The veteran backup is 5-2-2 with a 2.62 GAA and a .902 save percentage through 10 games this season. Friday's start will be just his fourth game since Christmas. None Feb. 11, 2022 Elliott will be stationed between the pipes for Friday's tilt in Arizona, Erik Erlendsson of LightningInsider.com reports. - Elliott will make his 10th appearance of the season and his second since the start of January. He's 4-2-2 with a solid 2.57 GAA and .907 save percentage on the year. His starts will continue to be few and far between barring an Andrei Vasilevskiy injury. None Jan. 21, 2022 Elliot will start between the pipes in San Jose on Saturday, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott will make his first start of 2022 Saturday. He took the Rangers to a shootout in his last outing, stopping 20 of 23 shots on net en route to a 4-3 loss. The 36-year-old has posted a 3-2-2 record with a 2.79 GAA and an .889 save percentage over eight appearances in 2021-22. San Jose has gone 11-8-2 at home this season, alongside an average of 31.9 shots on goal and 2.71 goals for per game. None Dec. 31, 2021 Elliott allowed three goals on 23 shots in Friday's 4-3 shootout loss to the Rangers. - Elliott kept things close enough for the Lightning to bounce back from a couple of deficits, but he allowed the only tally in the shootout to Mika Zibanejad. The 36-year-old Elliott dropped to 3-2-2 with a 2.79 GAA and an .899 save percentage. He'd likely get another start against the Rangers on Sunday if Andrei Vasilevskiy isn't ready to return from the COVID-19 protocols by that game. None Dec. 26, 2021 Elliott has landed in the COVID-19 protocols Sunday, according to Joe Smith of The Athletic. - Elliott is one of four Tampa Bay players that has landed in the COVID-19 list Sunday, with the others being defenseman Mikhail Sergachev, center Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, as well as assistant coach Rob Zettler. The loss of Elliott is particularly important since Vasilevskiy is also in the COVID-19 protocols. As of right now, it's uncertain who will start between the pipes Tuesday against Montreal. None Dec. 11, 2021 Elliott will patrol the crease during Saturday's road matchup with the Senators, Bryan Burns of the Lightning's official site reports. - Elliott was razor sharp in his last start Sunday against the Flyers, turning aside 38 of 39 shots en route to a 7-1 victory. The 36-year-old vet will try to secure a second straight win in a favorable road matchup with an Ottawa team that's 4-9-0 at home this year. None Dec. 5, 2021 Elliott will start between the pipes in Sunday's road game versus Philadelphia, Adam Kimelman of NHL.com reports. - Elliott was decent in his last start Tuesday against the Blues, stopping 30 of 33 shots, but he was ultimately stuck with his second loss of the year due to insufficient goal support from his teammates. The 36-year-old vet will try to secure his third win of the campaign in a road matchup with a slumping Flyers team that's lost three straight contests. None Dec. 1, 2021 Elliott stopped 30 of 33 shots through overtime in Tuesday's 4-3 shootout loss to St. Louis. - Elliott was spotted a 3-0 lead just 5:29 into the contest, but the Blues then tilted the ice the other way. By the end of overtime, both Elliott and Jordan Binnington had saved 30 of 33 shots. Elliott denied two of three attempts in the shootout, but Ryan O'Reilly got one past him, while Binnington was perfect in the skills challenge to win it for the Blues. Andrei Vasilevskiy's backup is consistent if nothing else, having allowed three goals three times and four goals once en route to a 2-1-1 record. None Nov. 30, 2021 Elliott will guard the road goal during Tuesday's matchup with the Blues, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott was a little shaky in his last start Nov. 21 versus Minnesota, surrendering four goals on 32 shots, but he was ultimately able to come away with a win thanks to strong goal support from his teammates. The 36-year-old vet will try to secure his third victory of the year in a road matchup with a St. Louis squad that's averaging 3.80 goals per game at home this campaign, fifth in the NHL. None Nov. 21, 2021 Elliott stopped 28 shots in regulation and overtime and all three shootout attempts he faced in Sunday's 5-4 win over the Wild. - The veteran netminder seemed comfortably headed for his second win over the season until he coughed up two goals in the final three minutes of the third period, sending the game to overtime. Fortunately for Elliott and the Bolts, he kept his cool and Steven Stamkos bailed him out with the only tally in the shootout. Elliott has only made three appearances so far for Tampa Bay, not a surprising workload for Andrei Vasilevskiy's backup, and his 3.30 GAA and .878 save percentage represent another step back from his mediocre performance during his last two seasons with the Flyers. None Nov. 20, 2021 Elliott will patrol the crease during Sunday's home matchup with Minnesota, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports. - Elliott was a little shaky in his last start Nov. 6 against Ottawa, surrendering three goals on just 27 shots, but he was still able to come away with a win thanks to strong goal support from his teammates. The 36-year-old vet will try to secure his second win of the year in a home matchup with a Devils team that's averaging just 2.00 goals per game on the road this season, 30th in the NHL. None Nov. 6, 2021 Elliott stopped 24 shots in Saturday's 5-3 win over the Senators. - The two teams traded goals through two periods, but the Bolts pulled away in the third while Elliott held firm. The veteran netminder picked up his first win of the season in his second start, and playing time will remain hard to come by behind Andrei Vasilevskiy even if Elliott improves on his 3.08 GAA and .880 save percentage. None May 10, 2021 Brian Elliott stopped 23 of 25 shots in the Flyers' 4-2 win over the Devils on Monday. The victory pushed him to 15-9-2 on the season with a 3.06 GAA and .889 save percentage. None May 7, 2021 Brian Elliott stopped 28 of 30 shots in the Flyers' 4-2 win over the Capitals on Friday. The victory pushed him to 14-9-2 on the season with a 3.10 GAA and .888 save percentage. None May 4, 2021 Brian Elliott stopped 24 of 30 shots in the Flyers' 7-3 loss to the Penguins on Tuesday. The defeat dropped him to 13-9-2 on the season with a 3.15 GAA and .886 save percentage. None May 1, 2021 Brian Elliott stopped 17 of 21 shots in the Flyers' 4-1 loss to the Devils on Saturday. The defeat dropped him to 13-8-2 on the season with a 3.02 GAA and .890 save percentage. None April 27, 2021 Brian Elliott stopped 21 of 26 shots in the Flyers' 6-4 loss to the Devils on Tuesday. The defeat dropped him to 13-7-2 on the season with a 2.98 GAA and .892 save percentage.

Dec. 12, 2017 Elliott made 20 saves to win his fourth straight start and help the Flyers to Tuesday's 4-2 victory over Toronto. Up and down all season, Elliott is on quite a roll at the moment. The veteran has yielded two goals or less in each of those wins, compiling a 1.75 goals-against average and a .946 save percentage during the streak. Dec. 8, 2017 Elliott made 36 saves for his 200th NHL victory as the Flyers beat the Canucks 4-1 on Thursday night. &quot;Reaching milestones like that means a lot and hopefully I can go for another hundred,'' said Elliott, who was playing his second game in as many nights. He's won three consecutive starts, yielding five goals, after losing eight straight. Dec. 7, 2017 Elliott made 24 saves as the Flyers beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-2 on Wednesday night for their second straight victory after losing 10 in a row. Elliott has allowed two goals in winning the last two games for the Flyers, but with the team in Vancouver on Thursday, Elliott seems unlikely to be between the pipes in the second half of a back-to-back. Dec. 5, 2017 Elliott made 43 saves in Monday's 5-2 win in Calgary as the Flyers halted a 10-game losing streak. This was a badly needed source of encouragement for Elliott, who defeated his former team to end a personal eight-game skid. He had posted a 4.36 GAA and an .882 save percentage in his previous five starts. Nov. 17, 2017 Elliott stopped 31 shots in a 3-2 shootout loss to the Jets on Thursday. Elliott has dropped three straight starts, but has a 1.40 goals-against average while going 1-3-1 this month. Philadelphia has totaled five goals and been shut out three times in those five fixtures. Nov. 15, 2017 Elliott stopped 17 of the 18 shots he faced in Tuesday's 3-0 loss to the Wild. Elliott gave up a goal 12 seconds into the game but didn't give up a thing after that, with Minnesota scoring a pair of empty-netters after he was pulled. Elliott has given up four goals in his last four starts but has lost three of them because the Flyers didn't score. Nov. 11, 2017 Elliott made 26 saves in a 1-0 loss to the Wild on Saturday. Elliott has been solid over his last three starts, stopping 96 of 100 shots, but Philadelphia has been blanked twice. In his previous three, he allowed 12 goals on 89 shots. Nov. 9, 2017 Elliott made 38 saves to beat the Blackhawks 3-1 on Thursday. Elliott has been better over his last two starts, stopping 70 of 73 shots. In his previous three, he allowed 12 goals on 89 shots. Nov. 2, 2017 Elliott turned aside 32 of 34 shots in Wednesday's 3-0 loss at Chicago. Though this was a strong performance, Elliott continues to be very hit-or-miss. Over his last four starts, he allowed two goals in two of them and surrendered a combined 10 in the other two. Oct. 30, 2017 Elliott stopped 30 shots Monday in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Coyotes, who came in 0-10-1 on the season. Elliott has been inconsistent in his first season with the Flyers. He's allowed four or more goals in three of his eight starts and has an overall 3.23 GAA and an .884 save percentage while going 5-2-1. Oct. 28, 2017 Elliott made 28 saves in a 4-2 win at Toronto on Saturday. He bounced back after giving up six goals on 25 shots in a loss to the Ducks on Tuesday. Oct. 25, 2017 Elliott stopped just 19 of 25 shots in Tuesday's loss to the Ducks. It was the second time in four starts that Elliott allowed six goals. He surrendered a total of three in the other two. That kind of inconsistency - along with the fact backup Michael Neuvirth has played very well - make Elliott a candidate to be dropped in season-long fantasy leagues. Oct. 21, 2017 Elliott made 23 saves in Saturday's 2-1 win over the Oilers. Though this performance has to be encouraging for Elliott, Edmonton hasn't been scoring much against anyone lately. Elliott had given way to Michael Neuvirth in the previous two games, and he allowed one goal in each. Elliott has a mediocre .897 save percentage on the season. Oct. 15, 2017 Elliott finished with 21 saves in the Flyers' 8-2 rout of Washington on Saturday. Elliott wasn't tested much in a game the Flyers dominated over the final two periods, though it still rates as a nice bounce-back performance after he gave up six goals on 31 shots in Tuesday's loss at Nashville. The offseason addition has been solid in his three other starts this season. Oct. 10, 2017 Elliott surrendered six goals on 31 shots as the Flyers blew a late lead in Tuesday's loss at Nashville. Elliott had been pretty solid in his first two appearances in a Flyers uniform, stopping 53 of 58 chances in back-to-back wins to begin the season, and would have had a better line in this one if not for two costly Philadelphia penalties that led to late Nashville goals. He's slated to make his home debut Saturday, though it comes against Alex Ovechkin and the high-scoring Capitals. Oct. 8, 2017 Elliott made 21 saves in the Flyers' 3-2 OT win over the Ducks on Saturday. Elliott has opened the season with consecutive wins after stopping 32 of 35 shots at San Jose on Wednesday. April 18, 2017 Elliott stopped just 22 shots in Monday's 5-4 overtime loss to the Ducks as Calgary fell into a 3-0 deficit in its first-round series. Elliott has a dreadful .887 save percentage in the series, surrendering 11 goals. He has lost to the Ducks five times overall this month, posting a 3.68 GAA, and has a 12-game losing streak against them which goes back to 2011. April 16, 2017 Elliott finished with 26 saves in the Flames' 3-2 loss at Anaheim in Game 2 of the Western Conference quarterfinals. Elliott, who stopped 38 of 41 shots in the opener, hasn't been bad in this series, but has been outplayed by John Gibson as Anaheim has jumped out to a 2-0 lead. Games 3 and 4 will be held at the Saddledome, where Elliott recorded a 2.25 goals-against average in the regular season. The veteran netminder had a 2.86 GAA and an .897 save percentage on the road. April 9, 2017 Elliott stopped 15 of 17 shots before being removed after two periods in the Flames' 3-1 loss at San Jose in Saturday's regular-season finale. Though Elliott figures to start the Flames' opening-round playoff series, he'll enter having recorded a shaky 3.52 goals-against average and an .871 save percentage over a three-game losing streak. The veteran was solid during St. Louis' run to last year's Western Conference finals, though, compiling a 2.44 GAA and a .921 save percentage in 18 starts. April 5, 2017 Elliott stopped just 16 of 19 shots in Tuesday's 3-1 loss at Anaheim after replacing an injured Chad Johnson just 5:19 into the first period. The injury to Johnson likely ensures Elliott will start Calgary's final two regular-season games, but he has a mediocre .905 save percentage in his last seven games. April 3, 2017 Elliott stopped 30 of 34 shots in Sunday's 4-3 loss to Anaheim. Elliott surrendered four goals for the third time in six starts and continues to have problems with the Ducks. He's 1-6-2 with a 3.38 GAA in nine career starts against them, and Calgary's next game is a rematch in Anaheim on Wednesday. April 1, 2017 Elliott made 36 saves in Friday's 5-2 win over the Sharks as Calgary clinched a playoff berth. Elliott has surrendered two goals or fewer in 12 of his last 15 starts, winning 13 of them. March 30, 2017 Elliott stopped just 29 of 33 shots in the Flames' loss to Los Angeles on Wednesday. Elliott hasn't had many subpar performances lately, as he entered the contest 13-1-0 with a 1.90 goals-against average and a .936 save percentage over his previous 14 starts. He'll likely get a chance to bounce back when the Flames host San Jose on Friday. March 28, 2017 Elliott made 24 saves in Monday's 4-2 win over the Avalanche. It was Elliott's 25th win of the season and 14th in his past 16 games. He's won nine straight starts at home while posting a 1.53 GAA, and Calgary just began a four-game homestand Monday. March 22, 2017 Elliott stopped 36 shots Tuesday night but let four slip past him in a 4-2 loss to the Capitals that snapped his franchise-record winning streak at 11 games. Elliott still has a ridiculously good .949 save percentage over his last 10 starts. March 20, 2017 Elliott made 19 saves Sunday for his 11th straight win to tie a club record set by Mike Vernon in the 1988-89 season. Elliott has allowed two goals or fewer in two of his 11 games during the streak. March 15, 2017 Elliott returned Friday after missing one game due to the flu, and he came within 6:39 of his third shutout in four games as he made 24 saves in a 3-1 win over Dallas. Elliott has won 10 straight starts, and he's 14-1-1 in his last 16 with a 1.87 goals-against average and a .936 save percentage. March 12, 2017 The Flames blanked the Winnipeg Jets 3-0 Saturday night with Brian Elliott's second straight shutout, stretching their winning streak to nine games. Elliott's second shutout of the season, and 36th of his career, followed up Thursday's 24 saves in a 5-0 win over Montreal on Thursday. March 10, 2017 Elliott had 24 saves for his first shutout of the season in Thursday's 5-0 win over Montreal. Elliott, playing his finest hockey of the season, is 11-1-1 with a .931 save percentage in his last 13 starts. He's won seven in a row and has allowed no more than two goals in six straight. March 5, 2017 Elliott won his sixth straight start with Sunday's 33-save effort in the red-hot Flames' 5-2 win over the Islanders. Elliott has been a major contributor to Calgary's seven-game win streak and has turned his season around by going 7-0-1 with a sparkling 1.98 goals-against average and .934 save percentage over his last eight starts. The offseason addition has yielded two goals or less in seven of those outings. March 4, 2017 Elliott finished with 35 saves in Friday's 3-2 win over Detroit. Elliott has gone 6-0-1 with a 1.97 goals-against average over his last seven starts. March 1, 2017 Elliott continued his hot play of late in Tuesday's 2-1 win over the Kings, making his 10th start in the last 13 games. Elliott's most important save came with less than 10 seconds remaining in the game, when Muzzin's shot deflected sharply off the skate of Giordano and nearly went in. Elliott finished with 28 saves and is 8-1-1 in his last 10 starts. Feb. 27, 2017 Elliott stopped 34 shots in Sunday's 3-1 win at Carolina. Elliott has won three straight starts and is 6-1-1 with a 2.40 GAA this month. The Flames host the Kings on Tuesday, and Elliott allowed five goals on 39 shots in his only start of the season against LA back in November. Feb. 24, 2017 Elliott stopped 23 shots in Tuesday's 3-2 win in Tampa. Elliott is 6-1-1 in his last eight starts despite a mediocre .910 save percentage. Feb. 16, 2017 Elliott finished with 33 saves in Wednesday's 3-1 win over Philadelphia. Elliott has won four of his last five starts and was excellent all night. The veteran improved to 12-13-2 on the season. Feb. 2, 2017 Elliott made 28 saves in Wednesday's 5-1 win over the Wild. The Flames have now gotten back-to-back strong starts from Elliott, who has struggled in his first season in Calgary after coming over from St. Louis in a summertime trade. He had nine wins in 24 games coming in to the night with a 2.88 goals-against-average and unseemly .892 save percentage, but he beat Ottawa right before the All-star break and then was solid against the Wild. Jan. 27, 2017 Elliott made 25 saves to halt a personal four-game losing streak and help the Flames to Thursday's 3-2 overtime win at Ottawa. The offseason addition ends a disappointing first half on a positive note. Elliott recorded a 3.06 goals-against average and an .872 save percentage during the losing streak, and his overall numbers (2.88 GAA, .892 save pct.) are only slightly better. Jan. 7, 2017 It was a rough night Friday for Elliott, who stopped nine shots in a 4-2 loss to the Canucks as the Flames outshot Vancouver 46-13. Elliot had won his previous five starts behind a 1.80 GAA and .922 save percentage. Jan. 1, 2017 Elliott had 27 stops and the Flames beat the Coyotes 4-2 on Saturday night. Elliott has won his last four starts after going over seven weeks without a win. The Flames are off until facing the Avalanche on Wednesday, and Elliott had 25 saves in a 6-3 win at Colorado last Tuesday. Dec. 28, 2016 Elliott had 25 saves and the Flames beat the Avalanche 6-3 on Tuesday night. Elliott has posted a 2.00 GAA in winning his last three starts after going 0-6-1 with a 3.43 GAA in his previous eight outings. He's started the last two games for the Flames and is making a case to be their No. 1 goaltender as Chad Johnson has a 4.50 GAA in losing his last three starts. Dec. 20, 2016 Elliott, starting for the first time since Nov. 28, made 25 saves in the Flames' 4-2 win over the Coyotes on Monday. Elliott is just 4-9-1 with an .889 save percentage, but perhaps this performance will earn him some more time. Nov. 13, 2016 Elliott had another rough outing Saturday, stopping just 24 of 28 shots in a loss to the Rangers. Elliott is finding success to be considerably more difficult in Calgary than in St. Louis, where he posted an outstanding 2.07 goals-against average last season behind one of the league's better defenses. Now playing behind one of the worst, he's lost five straight starts and allowed 16 goals over his last four to raise his GAA to 3.36. Nov. 6, 2016 Elliott made 34 saves Saturday, but the Flames lost 5-0 to Los Angeles. Elliott has dropped his last three starts and yielded nine goals in the last two. Nov. 2, 2016 Elliott stopped just 17 of 21 shots in Tuesday's loss to Chicago. It was a big step backward for Elliott, who had recovered from a rough start to the season by allowing seven goals in his final four starts of October with a .941 save percentage. Oct. 29, 2016 Elliot made 31 saves in Friday's 5-2 win over Ottawa. Elliott has a 1.63 goals-against average during a three-game winning streak. Oct. 26, 2016 Elliott was excellent in his return to St. Louis, coming through with 23 saves to help Calgary to a 4-1 victory in his first appearance against the Blues since being traded to the Flames in June. Elliott's tenure in Calgary didn't start off well, as he surrendered 14 goals in losing his first three starts. He's yielded just three in consecutive road wins over Chicago and St. Louis, so he appears to be back to his reliable self. Oct. 24, 2016 Elliott had his best game for the Flames on Monday, stopping 32 shots in regulation and overtime and another seven in the shootout in a 3-2 win at Chicago. Elliott had surrendered 14 goals while posting an .839 save percentage in losing his first three starts for Calgary. The Flames are in St. Louis on Tuesday, and Elliott got the night off when Calgary hosted his former team just last Saturday, a 6-4 loss. Oct. 21, 2016 Elliott's brutal start to his first season with Calgary continued Thursday, allowing four goals on 32 shots in a loss to previously winless Carolina. Elliott has lost all three of his starts, surrendering 14 goals and posting an .839 save percentage. ''It's slight breakdowns here and there and it starts with me. I've got to make a save here and there too, to keep us in it,'' the 32-year-old said. Oct. 13, 2016 Elliott's Calgary debut did not go well, as the veteran netminder was torched for six goals on 27 shots in Wednesday's season opener at Edmonton. Playing behind a much leakier defense than he worked with in St. Louis, Elliott will be hard-pressed to match the 2.01 GAA and .925 save percentage he averaged over five seasons with the Blues. He'll get another crack at the talented Oilers at home on Friday. May 24, 2016 The St. Louis Blues are going back to Elliott for Game 6 of the Western Conference finals against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday night. Jake Allen has started the last two games and made 21 saves in a 6-3 Game 5 loss that included two empty-net goals. The Sharks have a 3-2 series lead and are seeking their first trip to the Stanley Cup finals. The Blues are in the conference finals for the first time since 2001. Elliott started every game of the playoffs before Hitchcock switched to Allen for Game 4. The two split duties during the season. May 11, 2016 Elliott will start in goal for the St. Louis Blues in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night. Coach Ken Hitchcock held off naming a starter until after the morning skate, several hours ahead of the pivotal game. Jake Allen relieved Elliott in Game 6 after the Stars scored three goals on seven shots. Before that, Elliott had been in goal the entire postseason for St. Louis, seeking its first trip to the conference finals since 2001. Hitchcock said it was a &quot;no brainer&quot; after he spoke with Elliott and the goalie showed up at the rink Tuesday ready to see some pucks. Hitchcock said Elliott earned the right to start. May 10, 2016 Elliott turned in a dud in Monday's Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, allowing three goals on seven shots before being pulled in the first period of a loss to Dallas. Elliott was outstanding in Saturday's Game 6 to help give the Blues a 3-2 series lead but simply didn't have it on this night. Fortunately for St. Louis fans, he's posted a 1.90 GAA in the series' three matchups in Dallas, where Game 7 takes place Wednesday. May 8, 2016 Elliott put the Blues a win away from the Western Conference finals with 27 saves in Saturday's 4-1 Game 5 win over Dallas. He continues to be a big reason why the Blues on the verge of advancing. In 12 starts this postseason, Elliott owns a 2.20 GAA and a very solid .932 save percentage. April 26, 2016 Elliott helped the Blues advance to the Western Conference semifinals with 31 saves in Monday's Game 7 win over Chicago. Elliott caps a solid series in which he posted a 2.40 GAA and .929 save percentage. April 22, 2016 Elliott made 31 saves but took the loss in Thursday's 4-3 double-overtime loss to Chicago. He was strong late until Patrick Kane poked in his own rebound early in the second overtime. The Blues still lead the series 3-2. April 8, 2016 Elliott finished with 24 saves in Thursday's 2-1 overtime win over Chicago. Elliott has gone 11-0-0 with a 1.84 goals-against average in his last 13 starts. March 26, 2016 Elliott made 15 saves in Friday's 4-0 win over Vancouver for his third straight shutout since returning from injury. Two of them have come against the Canucks. Elliott has stopped all 71 shots he has faced against Vancouver and San Jose after missing nearly four weeks with a knee injury suffered in a loss to the Sharks last month. He is 9-0-1 with a .950 save percentage and 1.45 goals-against average his last 11 starts. March 23, 2016 Elliott made 37 saves in his second straight shutout since returning from an injury and the Blues withstood some tense moments late after taking a pair of penalties to beat the San Jose Sharks 1-0 on Tuesday night. Elliott has stopped all 56 shots he has faced against Vancouver and San Jose after missing nearly four weeks with a knee injury suffered in a loss to the Sharks last month. He's 8-0-1 with a 1.61 GAA and .948 save percentage over his last 10 games. Feb. 22, 2016 Elliott made 19 saves in his return from injury and the St. Louis Blues handed the Vancouver Canucks their second straight shutout loss, 3-0 on Saturday night. This was Elliott's first game since Feb. 22, when he went down with a lower-body injury. Saturday was his second shutout this season and 32nd of his career. Feb. 21, 2016 Elliott made 18 saves in Saturday's win. Elliott has a 1.99 GAA in a five-game win streak. Feb. 19, 2016 Elliott was outstanding again Thursday against Los Angeles. He stopped 34 shots in the Blues' 2-1 overtime victory, his fourth consecutive win. Elliott owns a 1.52 GAA over his last 13 starts and has yielded one goal or less in five of his past six. Feb. 17, 2016 Elliott needed to make only 17 saves in Tuesday's 2-1 victory over Dallas in overtime. He has a 1.37 goals-against average during a 4-0-1 stretch. Feb. 15, 2016 Elliott stopped 37 shots in a 2-1 victory at Tampa Bay on Sunday night. The St. Louis Blues netminder is 3-0-1 with a 1.47 goals-against average in his last four games. Feb. 10, 2016 Elliott made 32 saves in regulation and overtime for the Blues on Tuesday. Elliott has allowed one or fewer goals in five of his last seven starts with a 1.27 goals-against average and .958 save percentage. But his record is just 3-2-2 in that stretch. Feb. 7, 2016 Elliott made 38 saves in Saturday's 4-1 win over Minnesota. Elliot has a 1.43 goals-against average during a 4-2-1 stretch. Feb. 3, 2016 Elliott maintained his excellent recent play with a 16-save shutout Tuesday in Nashville. Elliott is 4-1-1 with a 1.48 GAA and a .955 save percentage over his last six starts. With Jake Allen still sidelined with a lower-body injury, Elliott will continue to handle the bulk of the work in the Blues' crease. Jan. 23, 2016 In Friday's 2-1 shootout loss to Colorado, Elliott allowed a late goal in the third period for a second straight contest. Elliot, though, has a 1.86 goals-against average during a 5-1-1 starting stretch. Jan. 21, 2016 Elliott came within less than 2 1/2 minutes of handing Detroit its first shutout in 69 games, Dmitri Jaskin scored a key third-period goal, and the Blues beat the Red Wings 2-1 Wednesday night. Elliott made 29 saves to win his third straight start. Jan. 17, 2016 Elliott was on his game in Saturday's overtime win over Montreal. Elliott faced a career-high 49 shots and stopped 46.

Jan. 8, 2014 Elliott was the master of the crease yet again in Tuesday's 5-2 win over Edmonton. Elliott made 16 saves and is 12-0-0 with a 2.05 GAA in his last 12 starts so he is red-hot.
