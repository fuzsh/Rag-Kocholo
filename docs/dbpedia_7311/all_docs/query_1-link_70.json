        "text": "Curtis Carr was named an Assistant Coach of the Bowling Green Falcon Hockey program prior to the fall of 2019, entering his fifth season on the BGSU staff in 2023-24. Carr came to Bowling Green after spending the previous eight seasons as an Assistant and Associate Head Coach at Merrimack College.\n\n\"We couldn't be happier to add Curtis Carr and his family to the Falcon hockey family,\" first-year head coach Ty Eigner said. \"Curtis checks all the boxes and then some. He has a proven track record of coaching and recruiting success. Most importantly, he's an incredible person.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be joining Bowling Green State University and such a historic hockey program,\" said Carr. \"I'm honored to work with Coach Eigner and to help continue the standard of BG hockey. Margaret and I are excited to have our family be part of the Bowling Green community.\"\n\nIn 2022-23, BGSU finished third in the CCHA and ended the season with the nation's 10th-best penalty kill percentage (84.4). The Falcons netted seven shorthanded goals, tying for fourth in the NCAA. Bowling Green also set a program record for blocked shots per game at 12.72. Freshman defenseman Dalton Norris earned CCHA All-Rookie honors, Carr's fourth consecutive season mentoring a blue-liner to an all-conference selection. Additionally, Anton Malmstrom signed an NHL entry-level contract with the St. Louis Blues, while Max Coyle and Zach Vinnell each signed with the ECHL's Indy Fuel. All three professional Falcons posted a career-best point total in 2022-23.\n\nIn Carr's third season (2021-22), the Falcons finished 15-19-3, with a 11-14-1 mark in conference play. The Falcons played in the reestablished Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), finishing sixth. Bowling Green's penalty kill unit ranked fourth in the conference, limiting opponents to a 20.1% conversion rate. The Orange and Brown also saw individual successes from their defensemen. Eric Parker was named to the All-CCHA Rookie Team, with Gabriel Chicoine and Ben Wozney each earning CCHA Defensman of the Week once. Chicoine tied for the team lead in multi-assist efforts with four and tied for second on the team in assists with 18. Parker and T.J. Lloyd tied for fifth on the team with 12 assists.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 season, Carr assisted the Falcons in capturing yet another 20-win season for the program with a 20-10-1 record, being the seventh consecutive 20-win season, the second longest streak in program history. The Falcons also broke the program record most consecutive road wins with 12 dating back to the 2019-20 season. The season also saw the Falcons ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation.\n\nIn his first season with the Falcons, Carr helped Bowling Green to a 21-13-4 record, marking the team's sixth consecutive 20-win season, tied for the second longest streak in program history. The Falcons advanced past the first round of the playoffs, marking the 10th consecutive sesaon the Orange and Brown won a best-of-three series, but the season was cut short there due to the coronavirus outbreak. At the time the season ended, the Falcons concluded the season as the hottest team in the nation, riding a 10-game unbeaten streak as well as a six-game win streak. The Falcons also led the nation in power play goals on the season, netting 45 scores with the man advantage.\n\nPrior to the 2011-12 season, Carr served as Assistant Coach for three seasons before his promotion to associate head coach in August of 2014. He has taken over a major role in recruiting since then and has helped matriculate many top Hockey East players to Merrimack, including Hockey East Third Team All-Stars Collin Delia, who signed a professional contract with the Chicago Blackhawks in the summer of 2017 and debuted with the Blackhawks in 2018, as well as Brett Seney, a 2015 National Hockey League (NHL) Draft fifth round selection by the New Jersey Devils. Carr also recruited defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic, one of the top young defensemen in Hockey East who was drafted in the third round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nIn each of the last seven seasons, Carr has overseen Merrimack's penalty kill unit, and his presence has certainly been felt. The Warriors have boasted some of the stingiest defenses over the last seven years. In 2015-16, Merrimack started the season 20-for-20 on the penalty kill and did not allow a power play goal until its sixth game. Merrimack finished seventh in Hockey East and 39th nationally on the PK in 2016-17 and were once again competitive throughout the year on special teams in 2017-18, owning a 76.4-percent kill rate.\n\nCarr perhaps produced his best work with the penalty kill in 2014-15, when Merrimack led Hockey East and ranked fifth nationally with an 88.2-percent success rate. In fact, since taking over the unit, Merrimack has ranked third or better in Hockey East in three out of those seven years. Merrimack boasted an 85.1-percent success rate in 2012-13 after killing off 84.5 percent of penalties in 2011-12. Merrimack fended off 81.5 percent of opponents' power plays in 2013-14.\n\nPrior to Merrimack, Carr spent five years with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He guided Youngstown to a 23-30-7 record in 2010-11 in his first season as Head Coach and General Manager. During his tenure with the Phantoms, he also served as Associate Head Coach and Director of Player Development in 2009-10.\n\nCarr was named Interim Head Coach at Youngstown on February 16, 2010, but had the interim tag removed on April 1, 2010, with just two games remaining in the Phantoms' inaugural season at the Tier I USHL level.\n\nPrior to moving to Youngstown, Carr spent three seasons as the Assistant Coach and Director of Player Personnel for the NAHL's Mahoning Valley Phantoms, during which the team posted a 142-61-11 record. Mahoning won a regular season title, two North Division titles, qualified for the National Tournament in all three seasons, and finished as the National Champion runner-up twice.\n\nUnder Carr's tutelage, 60 players from Youngstown and Mahoning have secured NCAA scholarships.\n\nA native of Georgetown, Ontario, Carr spent seven seasons as a player and coach for Kent State University and was a three-time ACHA All-American. Upon graduation in 2003, he was hired as an assistant coach for 2003-04 before being promoted to head coach, where he was an ACHA Coach of the Year finalist after leading the Golden Flashes to the ACHA National Tournament. In his first season at Kent State, Carr inherited a 9-30 team and produced a 21-18 record.\n\nCarr is also actively involved with USA Hockey's Select and Developmental camps and serves as a presenter for the USA Hockey's Coaching Education Program. He earned a bachelor's degree in physical education with a teacher certification and a master's in sports administration and recreation management from Kent State.\n\nCarr is joined by his wife, Margaret, and their three daughters, Emma, Sarah and Molly, and their son, Lucas."
