        "text": "\"Trust me, Alex, we tried to re-sign him,\" Armstrong said Friday. \"... The contract I think is well-documented that was out there that was offered, we used every tool under the CBA to ensure that we could get something done and it just didn't work out. There's no good or bad person in this. It's just the business side of it. Alex is a great guy and we had a great conversation (Thursday) night.\n\n\"I look back on it, and I'm not really sure why (a Pietrangelo contract wasn't completed). I was hoping to get something done. He has great representation from Newport Sports. We talked a lot, we exchanged offers during the season, during the pandemic, multiple offers post-pandemic. We couldn't find something that made everyone comfortable. It's not the first time and it won't be the last time this happens in the NHL. You just wish it didn't happen because of the desire and the respect we had to keep Alex here.\""
