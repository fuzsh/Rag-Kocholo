        "text": "The Blues are expecting to begin their 2011-12 season without David Perron, who's been suffering from post-concussion symptoms since last November when he was hit by San Jose's Joe Thornton.\n\n\"David has shown improvement,\" Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said this morning. \"But it's not to the point where he's ready to come in and work out and start training yet. The improvement took a big jump a few months ago, but it's been slow and steady now.\n\n\"We're going to continue down the course we're at right now. But where we're at now, in the summer and with training camp, we've decided to just move forward with the idea that David won't be ready for training camp ... he'll just continue to progress and when he is ready, whatever time he is ready, he'll jump back in and start his training to resume his career. But we're not expecting him at training camp.\"\n\nThe decision came earlier this week, when Armstrong spoke with Perron, Perron's agent Allan Walsh and the Blues' medical staff on a conference call. Armstrong said that with training camp beginning Sept. 16, approximately six weeks away, it was important for the club to make a definitive decision and move forward.\n\nThe Blues open the regular season Oct. 8.\n\n\"David, as we get closer, he doesn't want to answer these questions,\" Armstrong said. \"He just wants to focus on getting ready. I think it's just better for David, for the coaches, for everyone to realize that he is progressing but we're not expecting him to be ready at training camp.\n\n\"But as much as this is to clear the air for everybody, I think it's important to let David just continue going at his own pace. He'll let us know when he's ready. Nobody wants David to play like David wants to play.\"\n\nArmstrong indicated that Perron's improvement took \"a big jump\" a few months ago. At that point, Perron attempted basic exercises to see how his body would respond.\n\n\"He did some light, light workouts - never got his heart-rate too high - and some of the symptoms, a little fatigue, set in,\" Armstrong said.\n\nSince then, Perron's symptoms have been steady.\n\n\"As I've said, the signs are all improving,\" Armstrong said. \"He's seen numerous doctors and we think he's getting excellent advice and excellent care. The injury he has, you just have to wait ... your body and your mind will tell you when you're ready to go.\"\n\nNeither the Blues, Perron nor his doctors know if that will be in November, January or March. The club will wait until Perron is medically cleared to start training again and then wait until he works his way back into game shape. He hasn't skated since the incident with Thorton Nov. 4, and the only time he's put on a pair of skates was for the team photo last year.\n\n\"He hasn't lifted weight yet or trained since the injury,\" Armstrong said. \"Not only is he going to have to get his skating legs back, he's going to have to get his body back in NHL shape. With that is going to come his puck skills, his hands and timing. There's going to be a process that he's going to have to go through once he does get medically cleared to do the physical training.\n\n\"Everyone is different, but we're not going to put David in a position to fail. We're going to put him in there when he's ready.\"\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
