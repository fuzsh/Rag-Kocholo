        "text": "The National Hockey League has been suspended been since March 12, and that means St. Louis Blues fans have been without Blue Note hockey for well over one week. NHL officials have stated optimistically they hope to resume play. But, with a second Ottawa Senators player testing positive for COVID-19, and increasingly stringent restrictions being implemented at all levels of government, it is difficult to picture how that will happen. The pause in action, nevertheless, presents an opportunity to reflect on the health of NHL organizations, particularly concerning prospects. For St. Louis Blues fans, there is one name that should instill confidence and shine bright as a potential contributor to a deep team: Scott Perunovich.\n\nSt. Louis drafted Perunovich –a native of Hibbing, Minnesota– 45th overall in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft, and he has played at the University of Minnesota-Duluth for the past three seasons. At only 5’10”, 175 lbs., what Perunovich lacks in size, he makes up for in skating ability, on-ice intelligence, and scoring ability. His productivity at UMD has increased his value within the St. Louis Blues’ organization, making his selection in the second round look like a steal.\n\nIn Perunovich’s freshman season, he notched an impressive 36 points (11 goals, 25 assists) in 42 games. This monster production established him as UMD’s leading scorer, becoming the second defenseman to accomplish that feat in school history. He claimed the Tim Taylor Award, awarded annually to the most outstanding freshman in NCAA Division 1 hockey. Also, he logged an impressive plus-22 rating. These numbers should garner more attention when considering he was only 18 years old playing against older, more seasoned college veterans. His smaller stature and age were anything but a hindrance in his rookie season.\n\nHis productivity decreased overall in his sophomore season, but he, by all means, avoided the infamous sophomore slump. He notched 29 points (three goals, 26 assists) in 39 games. He continued his strong play defensively, logging a plus-10 rating. This solid outing earned him the NCHC Offensive Defenseman Award for the second straight season alongside achieving All-American status, also for the second consecutive season. He became the first UMD Bulldog to secure this accomplishment in over 30 years. Perunovich’s blazing pace and history-making were not limited to his first season, demonstrating his developmental potential.\n\nPerunovich’s third season at UMD has seen him flourish both offensively and defensively. He has secured over a point-per-game pace, notching 40 in 34 games (six goals, 34 assists). With this total, he sits tied for 10th place in the list of top NCAA scorers. His production speaks volumes when it is noted that eight of the 10 spots are occupied by forwards. He earned the NCHC Player of the Month honor for February when he posted two goals and eight assists in seven games. His defensive play has not faltered with all of this success, as he has maintained a plus/minus ratio of plus-18.\n\nMore impressively, Perunovich’s stellar season has earned him a nomination for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top NCAA player. He has been named a candidate alongside nine other players, and the list will eventually be narrowed down to three before the recipient is announced on April 10. He would be the first Bulldog to receive the prestigious award since Jack Connolly after the 2011-12 season.\n\nUnfortunately, Perunovich will not have the opportunity to showcase his talent for the remainder of the season. Following the lead of so many professional organizations, the NCAA canceled all year-end tournaments, including the NCHC’s Frozen Faceoff games. Luckily, as a Junior, he has one final year of eligibility remaining at UMD. Should he elect to finish his four years in college, he will have a chance to capture a national championship next season.\n\nScott Perunovich has carved out an incredible college hockey career to date, amassing 105 points in 115 games. His size, like any smaller player, will raise eyebrows, but the stigma against smaller players has been alleviated by players like Johnny Gaudreau. The Blues’ own Justin Faulk and Vince Dunn clock in at six-feet tall, not that much more than Perunovich. Regardless, he has established himself as one of the brightest young prospects in the St. Louis Blues’ pipeline. While it is not certain when he will debut, his success has made it appear inevitable. No success is guaranteed in the NHL, but if any defenseman has positioned himself to develop and thrive, it is Perunovich."
