        "text": "Jordan Binnington (born on July 11, 1993 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who currently plays for the St. Louis Blues of the NHL.\n\nBinnington was drafted in the 3rd round (88th overall) by the Blues in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPlaying Career[]\n\nEarly Playing Career[]\n\nJordan played major junior hockey for the Owen Sound Attack in the Ontario Hockey League from 2009 to 2013. He had a very strong 2010–11 OHL season posting a 27–12–5 throughout 46 games.\n\nDuring the 2011 OHL Playoffs, Binnington led the Attack past the London Knights, the Plymouth Whalers, and the Windsor Spitfires to end up in the J. Ross Robertson Cup final versus the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors.\n\nThe seven-game series was won by the Attack, with Jarrod Maidens scoring the series clinching goal in overtime. The Owen Sound Attack also competed in the 2011 Memorial Cup tournament as OHL champions.\n\nProfessional[]\n\nRanked as the OHL's top 2011 NHL Entry Draft eligible goaltender (NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Final Rankings), Jordan was selected with the 88th overall pick in the third round by the St. Louis Blues. He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Blues on May 29, 2012.\n\nPlaying one AHL game in 2011–12, he returned to Owen Sound for most of that season and also played with Owen Sound for 2012–13.\n\nOn November 26, 2014, he was called up from the Kalamazoo Wings of the East Coast Hockey League, under emergency conditions, following the injury to Blues goaltender Brian Elliott.\n\nOn January 14, 2016, Jordan made his in-game debut against the Carolina Hurricanes, coming in to relieve starter Elliott in a 4–1 loss. On July 15, 2016, he signed a one-year, two-way contract with the St. Louis Blues.\n\nWith the Blues playing the 2017–18 season without an AHL affiliate, Jordan was reassigned on loan to the Providence Bruins on October 9, 2017. He was not recalled to the NHL during the 2017–18 season, finishing with 17 wins in 28 games for the Bruins. He was named to the 2018 AHL All-Star Classic alongside teammate Austin Czarnik.\n\nDuring the offseason before the 2018–19 season, Jordan signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Blues on July 6, 2018. He was assigned to the St. Louis Blues AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage, to begin the 2018–19 season.\n\nHe was recalled by the Blues to the NHL on December 9, 2018. The team had the worst record in the NHL on January 2. Five days later, he made his first NHL start, making 25 saves in a 3–0 win over the Philadelphia Flyers and becoming the 35th NHL goaltender to earn a shutout in his first start.\n\nOn February 11, Jordan was named the NHL First Star of the Week after going 3–0–0 to help the Blues to win six straight games and move into a Western Conference wild card spot.[16] He was named the NHL Rookie of the Month in February and March 2019.\n\nOn April 4, 2019, a 7–3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers gave him his 23rd win of the season, a record for a Blues rookie goaltender. On April 10, 2020, he played in his first NHL playoff game, stopping 25 of 26 shots against the Winnipeg Jets in a 2–1 victory.\n\nOn April 27, 2019, Jordan was announced as a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy. After knocking out Winnipeg in six games, the Blues defeated the Dallas Stars in a seven-game conference semi-final series.\n\nOn May 19, 2019, he became the first St. Louis Blues rookie goaltender to record a shutout in the Stanley Cup playoffs, a 5–0 win against the San Jose Sharks, which gave the Blues a team-record 11 playoff victories.\n\nThe Blues defeated the Sharks in six games to advance to the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals where they met the Boston Bruins, the Eastern Conference champions.\n\nOn June 12, 2019, the Blues defeated the Bruins in game seven to win the Stanley Cup, St. Louis' first in their 52-year franchise history. Jordan started every playoff game. With the Stanley Cup win, he set a record for most playoffs wins by a rookie goaltender in NHL history with his 16th win.\n\nIn his Day with the Cup on July 12, 2020, Jordan brought the Stanley Cup to his hometown of Richmond Hill. The next day, the Blues re-signed him to a two-year, $8.8 million contract extension.\n\nCareer Statistics[]\n\nRegular season and playoffs[]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP W L T/OT MIN GA SO GAA SV% GP W L MIN GA SO GAA SV% 2008–09 Toronto Dixie Beehives OJHL 1 0 1 0 59 3 0 3.04 .923 — — — — — — — — 2009–10 Owen Sound Attack OHL 22 6 10 2 1068 79 0 4.44 .888 — — — — — — — — 2010–11 Owen Sound Attack OHL 46 27 12 5 2596 132 1 3.05 .899 7 4 2 355 19 0 3.21 .894 2011–12 Owen Sound Attack OHL 39 21 17 1 2304 115 1 2.99 .906 2 0 2 120 10 0 5.00 .863 2011–12 Peoria Rivermen AHL 1 0 1 0 60 3 0 3.02 .921 — — — — — — — — 2012–13 Owen Sound Attack OHL 50 32 12 6 3011 109 7 2.17 .932 12 6 6 705 33 0 2.81 .916 2013–14 Kalamazoo Wings ECHL 40 23 13 3 2398 94 1 2.35 .922 3 1 1 223 7 0 1.89 .946 2013–14 Chicago Wolves AHL 1 1 0 0 65 3 0 2.78 .912 — — — — — — — — 2014–15 Chicago Wolves AHL 45 25 15 4 2555 100 3 2.35 .916 5 2 3 333 12 0 2.16 .938 2015–16 Chicago Wolves AHL 41 17 18 5 2340 111 1 2.85 .907 — — — — — — — — 2015–16 St. Louis Blues NHL 1 0 0 0 13 1 0 4.69 .750 — — — — — — — — 2016–17 Chicago Wolves AHL 32 16 7 8 1879 85 2 2.71 .911 2 0 0 65 2 0 1.86 .950 2017–18 Providence Bruins AHL 28 17 9 1 1606 55 1 2.05 .926 3 1 1 137 10 0 4.39 .865 2018–19 San Antonio Rampage AHL 16 11 4 0 922 32 3 2.08 .927 — — — — — — — — 2018–19 St. Louis Blues NHL 32 24 5 1 1876 59 5 1.89 .927 26 16 10 1560 64 1 2.46 .914 2019–20 St. Louis Blues NHL 50 30 13 7 2848 126 3 2.56 .912 NHL totals 83 54 18 8 4,837 186 8 2.31 .917 26 16 10 1,560 64 1 2.46 .914\n\nAccolades[]"
