        "text": "Goalies are the unsung heroes of hockey. A goalie is responsible for stopping the puck, and they do it with the most important tool in their arsenal: their body. An effective goalie must be able to read plays well, anticipate what comes next, and react accordingly. He’s not necessarily just looking at the play as it happens.\n\nBecause of the long careers of some of these old-timer goalies, they have learned how to minimize the risk of injury by using their minds more than their bodies.\n\nThey’ve been playing at the highest level of hockey for so long that they’re used to dealing with the physical demands of their profession and can anticipate what’s coming next.\n\nWith that being said, this article will introduce you to the list of the oldest active NHL goalies as of early 2023.\n\n13.
