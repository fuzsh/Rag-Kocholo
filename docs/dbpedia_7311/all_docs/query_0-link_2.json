        "text": "Canadian ice hockey player (born 1985)\n\nThis article is about the hockey player. For the Australian academic, see Brian Elliott (writer). For the social entrepreneur, see Brian Elliot. For the speedway rider, see Bryan Elliott.\n\nIce hockey player\n\nBrian Elliott (born April 9, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played parts of 16 seasons in the National Hockey League. He was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in the ninth round, 291st overall, of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. A two-time NHL All-Star in 2012 and 2015, Elliott played in the NHL for the Senators, Colorado Avalanche, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames, Philadelphia Flyers, and Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nJunior\n\n[edit]\n\nElliott grew up in Newmarket, Ontario, playing minor hockey for the Newmarket Redmen AA and the York-Simcoe Express AAA teams in the Ontario Minor Hockey Association. Elliott was not drafted by an Ontario Hockey League (OHL) team in 2001 and returned to York-Simcoe for Major Midget the following season. After a solid season in the Eastern AAA Hockey League, Elliott was signed by the Ajax Axemen of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League in 2002–03.\n\nNCAA\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a standout season with the Ajax Axemen in 2002–03, Elliott was drafted in the ninth round, 291st overall, in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. The second-last player selected in the draft, Elliott was not expected to progress to the NHL. After being drafted, he would spend four seasons with the University of Wisconsin–Madison, serving as a backup for his first two seasons before securing the starting goaltender position in the 2005–06 season. For his efforts, he was selected as a finalist for the 2005–06 Hobey Baker Memorial Award,[1] collecting eight shutouts in 33 appearances, and leading the Badgers to the 2006 NCAA National Championship. He was then signed by the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Binghamton Senators – an affiliate of the Ottawa Senators – on March 23, 2007, and played in eight games with Binghamton near the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\nProfessional\n\n[edit]\n\nOttawa Senators\n\n[edit]\n\nElliott was invited to the Ottawa Senators' 2007–08 training camp, but was ultimately assigned to Binghamton on September 25, 2007. He was recalled to Ottawa four days later to back up Martin Gerber, as starting goaltender Ray Emery was recovering from wrist surgery. On October 10, Elliott played in his first NHL game and earned the win against the Atlanta Thrashers. Upon Emery's return, Elliott was sent back to Binghamton, where he played in 44 games that season.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, Elliott was recalled by Ottawa after being named the AHL's Goalie of the Month for December.[2] He had been a standout in Binghamton, posting an 18–8–1 record with a 2.31 goals against average (GAA) and .926 save percentage. His play earned him the starting position for the Canadian team in the 2009 AHL All-Star Game.\n\nElliott made an immediate impact in Ottawa. The team had struggled all season, with inconsistent goaltending being an issue. Craig Hartsburg, Ottawa's head coach at the time, said of the move, \"We need some saves, some big saves, and he's done it down there [in Binghamton].\"[3] Elliott would finish the season in Ottawa, sharing goaltending duties with veteran Alex Auld. Elliott's emergence effectively made Martin Gerber expendable to the team, and he would later be claimed on waivers by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nElliott was nominated for the NHL's Rookie of the Month award for March 2009, though he would lose out to St. Louis Blues forward T. J. Oshie.[4] In January 2010, he was awarded the NHL's First Star of the Week for January 18–24, and named the League's Second Star of the Week for January 25–31.\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the trade deadline of the 2010–11 season, Elliott was traded as a part of Ottawa's rebuilding process to the Colorado Avalanche on February 18, 2011, in exchange for goaltender Craig Anderson.[5]\n\nAfter winning just two of his 12 starts with the Avalanche, combined with a sub-par 3.83 GAA, Elliott was released as a free agent after Colorado declined his qualifying offer.[6]\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\n[edit]\n\nElliott signed a one-year contract worth $600,000 with the St. Louis Blues on July 1, 2011.[7] Forming a formidable goaltending tandem with Jaroslav Halák, Elliott revitalized his career, posting a 23–10–4 record while sporting a 1.56 GAA. He was also chosen to participate in the 2012 NHL All-Star Game in Ottawa.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, Elliott signed a two-year contract extension with the Blues. The deal carried an average annual value of $1.8 million. Elliott reportedly earned $1.7 million in 2012–13 and $1.9 million in 2013–14. After taking over for the injured Halák during the first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Elliott led the Blues to a series victory over the San Jose Sharks before ultimately being swept in round two by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nOn May 19, 2014, Elliott signed a three-year contract extension to remain in St. Louis. The deal has an average annual value of $2.5 million.[8] On January 22, 2015, Elliott was named to the 2015 NHL All-Star Game in Columbus, replacing Columbus Blue Jackets' goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, who pulled out due to injury.[9]\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Elliott tied Jaroslav Halák for the Blues' franchise record in shutouts.[10] Five days later, on March 17, Elliott surpassed Halák for the Blues' shutout franchise record.\n\nA 23–8–6 record during the 2015–16 NHL season earned Elliott the starting role for the Blues for the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. He led the Blues to a first round victory over the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He made 31 saves in the deciding Game 7 victory on April 25. Elliott and the Blues would then move on to face the Western Conference's top overall team, the Dallas Stars. Again, the Blues prevailed in seven games. Elliott's only faltering occurred in Game 6 of the series, when he was pulled in favor of Jake Allen after allowing three goals on seven shots. He rebounded the next game, making 31 saves in a decisive 6–1 victory that propelled St. Louis to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2001 where they lost to the San Jose Sharks.[11] Elliott started in all but two games in the 2016 playoffs (games 4 and 5 of the Western Conference Finals).[citation needed]\n\nCalgary Flames\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, Elliott was traded by the Blues to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a 2016 second-round pick (Jordan Kyrou) and a 2018 conditional third-round pick on June 24, 2016. On October 24, 2016, he won his first game as a Flame against Chicago in a shootout.[12] However, he struggled with the team early, prompting them to switch to Chad Johnson as the team's regular starter. Elliott regained the starting job after starting the season off 3–9–1 with a 3.31 GAA and a save percentage of .885. On June 17, 2017, GM Brad Treliving informed Elliott that he will not be returning to the team for the 2017–18 season.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 1, 2017, Elliott officially signed a two-year, $5.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers.[13] During the 2017–18 season, Elliott was named the third star of the week for the week of December 17 after he helped the Flyers earn six consecutive wins following a losing streak of 10 games.[14][15] Despite missing a few months due to injury, the Flyers qualified for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs.[16] Elliott was replaced during their series against the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Flyers lost in the first round 4 games to 2.\n\nOn June 26, 2019, Elliott re-signed with the Flyers, signing a one-year contract worth $2 million.[17]\n\nOn October 3, 2020, the Flyers re-signed Elliott to a one-year contract extension worth $1.5 million.[18]\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Elliott played his 500th game in the NHL, the 77th goaltender to do so.[19]\n\nTampa Bay Lightning\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 28, 2021, Elliott was signed as a free agent to a one-year, $900,000 contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.[20]\n\nThe Lightning placed Elliott and Andrei Vasilevskiy, their two regular goalies, into the NHL Covid protocol on December 26, 2021.[21] Elliott was the first one eligible to exit the Covid-protocol on December 31. He played that night against the New York Rangers, his third start of the season.[22] He allowed 3 goals on 23 shots, and the game eventually went into a shootout. Elliott gave up the only goal in the shootout to Mika Zibanejad, which was enough to earn New York a 4–3 win.\n\nPost-playing career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter spending the 2023–24 season unsigned, Elliott returned to the St. Louis Blues as a goaltending scout and development coach on June 17, 2024, marking the end of his playing career.[23]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile attending Newmarket High School, he took the school's boys hockey team to the championship, winning it in 2000. He also attended Newmarket High School with former Blues teammate B. J. Crombeen.\n\nElliott's father, Bill, is a television director who has worked on numerous Canadian television programs, including The Red Green Show.[24] He resides in Wisconsin during the off-season. Elliott has one brother named Dan.\n\nElliott was taught the art of moose calling by the late Owen Scott, a champion moose caller. He paid tribute to Scott with a moose painted on the back of his goaltender mask.[25][26] Due to this, his nickname among teammates is \"Moose.\"[25][27] Elliott also had Casey Jones from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles painted on his mask.\n\nDuring the 2015–16 NHL season, Elliott began wearing all blue pads as a tribute to former Blues goaltender Curtis Joseph, and also had his mask painted with the same design that Joseph wore.[28]\n\nElliott's wife, Amanda, enrolled in the University of Wisconsin's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) before commissioning as an intelligence officer in the United States Air Force.[29] The couple have three sons together.[30][31]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP W L T OTL MIN GA SO GAA SV% GP W L MIN GA SO GAA SV% 2002–03 Ajax Axemen OPJHL 39 — — — — 2097 135 0 3.86 .903 4 — — — — — 3.62 — 2003–04 University of Wisconsin–Madison WCHA 6 3 3 0 — 336 12 0 2.14 .912 — — — — — — — — 2004–05 University of Wisconsin–Madison WCHA 9 6 2 1 — 467 9 3 1.16 .945 — — — — — — — — 2005–06 University of Wisconsin–Madison WCHA 33 25 5 3 — 2008 52 8 1.55 .938 — — — — — — — — 2006–07 University of Wisconsin–Madison WCHA 36 15 17 2 — 2053 72 5 2.10 .923 — — — — — — — — 2006–07 Binghamton Senators AHL 8 3 4 — 0 425 30 0 4.24 .886 — — — — — — — — 2007–08 Ottawa Senators NHL 1 1 0 — 0 60 1 0 1.01 .966 — — — — — — — — 2007–08 Binghamton Senators AHL 44 18 19 — 1 2394 112 2 2.81 .915 — — — — — — — — 2008–09 Binghamton Senators AHL 30 18 8 — 1 1691 65 2 2.31 .926 — — — — — — — — 2008–09 Ottawa Senators NHL 31 16 8 — 3 1667 77 1 2.77 .902 — — — — — — — — 2009–10 Ottawa Senators NHL 55 29 18 — 4 3038 130 5 2.57 .909 4 1 2 203 14 0 4.14 .853 2010–11 Ottawa Senators NHL 43 13 19 — 8 2293 122 3 3.19 .894 — — — — — — — — 2010–11 Colorado Avalanche NHL 12 2 8 — 1 690 44 0 3.83 .891 — — — — — — — — 2011–12 St. Louis Blues NHL 38 23 10 — 4 2235 58 9 1.56 .940 8 3 4 455 18 0 2.37 .904 2012–13 St. Louis Blues NHL 24 14 8 — 1 1292 49 3 2.28 .907 6 2 4 378 12 0 1.90 .919 2012–13 Peoria Rivermen AHL 2 1 1 — 0 119 3 1 1.51 .946 — — — — — — — — 2013–14 St. Louis Blues NHL 31 18 6 — 2 1624 53 4 1.96 .922 — — — — — — — — 2014–15 St. Louis Blues NHL 46 26 14 — 3 2546 96 5 2.26 .917 1 0 0 26 1 0 2.31 .857 2015–16 St. Louis Blues NHL 42 23 8 — 6 2263 78 4 2.07 .930 18 9 9 1058 43 1 2.44 .921 2016–17 Calgary Flames NHL 49 26 18 — 3 2845 121 2 2.55 .910 4 0 3 185 12 0 3.89 .880 2017–18 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 43 23 11 — 7 2522 112 1 2.66 .909 4 1 3 178 14 0 4.75 .856 2018–19 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 26 11 11 — 1 1397 69 1 2.96 .907 — — — — — — — — 2018–19 Lehigh Valley Phantoms AHL 2 1 1 — 0 121 7 0 3.47 .877 — — — — — — — — 2019–20 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 31 16 7 — 4 1674 80 2 2.87 .899 3 1 1 140 5 0 2.15 .911 2020–21 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 30 15 9 — 2 1608 82 2 3.06 .889 — — — — — — — — 2021–22 Tampa Bay Lightning NHL 19 11 4 — 3 1064 43 1 2.43 .912 — — — — — — — — 2022–23 Tampa Bay Lightning NHL 22 12 8 — 2 1325 75 2 3.40 .891 — — — — — — — — NHL totals 543 279 167 — 54 30,141 1,290 45 2.57 .909 48 17 26 2,622 119 1 2.72 .904\n\nAwards and achievements\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year College All-WCHA Second Team 2005–06 AHCA West First-Team All-American 2005–06 All-NCAA All-Tournament Team 2006 [32] All-WCHA Second Team 2006–07 NHL William M.
