        "text": "[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n\nJoin stand-up star Al Murray the Pub Landlord and a selection of outspoken friends for a night of top comedy in support of international freedom of expression charity Index on Censorship.\n\nOff the back of a sell-out show in 2015, Stand Up for Satire returns with a stellar line-up, with guests including Al Murray, Tim Key, Felicity Ward, Dane Baptiste, Kerry Godliman, Deborah Frances-White, host of the hit podcast The Guilty Feminist, and actor Simon Callow.\n\n“It’s great to be doing Stand Up For Satire again, being able to take the mickey, send politicians up, or just flick V’s at the powerful in general is something we take for granted sometimes in the UK. Satire is the thin end of the wedge, and it needs taking care of. And now I sound this pompous, I hope someone takes the piss out of me!” — Al Murray\n\n“Affectionate, double-edged satire that feels as fresh as ever.”\n\nThe Telegraph on Al Murray\n\n“Daring, innovative and ridiculously funny.”\n\nTime Out on Tim Key\n\n“Dizzyingly hilarious”\n\nThe Guardian on Dane Baptiste\n\n“Gutbustingly funny.”\n\nEvening Standard on Felicity Ward\n\n“Goes for the jugular, quick wit, frank and engaging.”\n\nThe Independent on Kerry Godliman\n\nIndex on Censorship has long championed comedians, cartoonists and others facing threats of persecution, violence and even death. Index provides a platform for the censored to be read, seen and heard – promoting and defending the right to free speech globally. All proceeds from the event will go to support this work.\n\nNote: This line-up is subject to change.\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=”1/3″][/vc_column][vc_column width=”1/3″][vc_btn title=”BUY TICKETS HERE” color=”danger” link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fstore.unionchapel.org.uk%2Fevents%2F2017-07-04-stand-up-for-satire-union-chapel||target:%20_blank|”][/vc_column][vc_column width=”1/3″][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_column_text]Stand Up for Satire is supported by: [/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=”1/3″][vc_single_image image=”91464″ img_size=”full” alignment=”center” onclick=”custom_link” link=”https://www.theguardian.com/uk”][vc_single_image image=”91468″ img_size=”full” alignment=”center” onclick=”custom_link” link=”http://www.standard.co.uk/”][/vc_column][vc_column width=”1/3″][vc_single_image image=”91465″ alignment=”center” onclick=”custom_link” link=”https://www.twitter.com”][/vc_column][vc_column width=”1/3″][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n\nStand Up for Satire 2015:\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n\nWhen: Tuesday 4 July 2017, 7:30-9:30pm (doors at 6:30pm)\n\nWhere: Union Chapel, Islington, London (map)\n\nTickets: £25 general, £15 concession\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]"
