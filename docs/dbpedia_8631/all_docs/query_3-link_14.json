        "text": "In the late seventies, I used to take the train from New Haven to New York on Saturdays, to spend afternoons with Albert Murray at Books & Company, on Madison Avenue. We would roam—often joined by the artist Romare Bearden—through fiction, criticism, philosophy, music. Murray always seemed to wind up fingering densely printed paperbacks by Joyce, Mann, Proust, or Faulkner; Bearden, typically, would pick up a copy of something daunting like Rilke’s “Letters on Cézanne” and then insist that I read it on the train home that night.\n\nIn those days, Murray was writing Count Basie’s autobiography—a project that he didn’t finish until 1985. (“For years,” he has remarked more than once, “when I wrote the word ‘I,’ it meant Basie.”) But he had already published most of the books that would secure his reputation as a cultural critic—perhaps most notably, his début collection, “The Omni-Americans” (1970), which brought together his ferocious attacks on black separatism, on protest literature, and on what he called “the social science-fiction monster.” Commanding as he could be on the page, Murray was an equally impressive figure in the flesh: a lithe and dapper man with an astonishing gift of verbal fluency, by turns grandiloquent and earthy. I loved to listen to his voice—grave but insinuating, with more than a hint of a jazz singer’s rasp. Murray had been a schoolmate of the novelist Ralph Ellison at the Tuskegee Institute, and the friendship of the two men over the years seemed a focal point of black literary culture in the ensuing decades. Ellison’s one novel, “Invisible Man,” was among the few unequivocal masterpieces of American literature in the postwar era, satirizing with equal aplomb Garveyites, Communists, and white racists in both their Southern-agrarian and their Northern-liberal guises. Murray’s works of critique and cultural exploration seemed wholly in the same spirit. Both men were militant integrationists, and they shared an almost messianic view of the importance of art. In their ardent belief that Negro culture was a constitutive part of American culture, they had defied an entrenched literary mainstream, which preferred to regard black culture as so much exotica—amusing, perhaps, but eminently dispensable. Now they were also defying a new black vanguard, which regarded authentic black culture as separate from the rest of American culture—something that was created, and could be appreciated, in splendid isolation. While many of their peers liked to speak of wrath and resistance, Murray and Ellison liked to speak of complexity and craft, and for that reason they championed the art of Romare Bearden.\n\nIn terms of both critical regard and artistic fecundity, these were good days for Bearden, a large, light-skinned man with a basketball roundness to his head. (I could never get over how much he looked like Nikita Khrushchev.) He, like Murray, was working at the height of his powers—he was completing his famous “Jazz” series of collages—and his stature and influence were greater than those which any other African-American artist had so far enjoyed. The collages combined the visual conventions of black American folk culture with the techniques of modernism—fulfilling what Murray called “the vernacular imperative” to transmute tradition into art.\n\nAfter a couple of hours at the bookstore, we’d go next door to the Madison Cafe, where Romie, as Murray called him, always ordered the same item: the largest fruit salad that I had ever seen in public. He claimed that he chose the fruit salad because he was watching his weight, but I was convinced that he chose it in order to devour the colors, like an artist dipping his brush into his palette. He’d start laying the ground with the off-white of the apples and the bananas, and follow them with the pinkish orange of the grapefruit, the red of strawberries, the speckled green of kiwifruit; the blueberries and purple grapes he’d save for last. While Romie was consuming his colors, Murray would talk almost non-stop, his marvellous ternary sentences punctuated only by the occasional bite of a B.L.T. or a tuna fish on rye. Murray was then, as now, a man with definite preoccupations, and among the touchstones of his conversation were terms like “discipline,” “craft,” “tradition,” “the aesthetic,” and “the Negro idiom.” And names like Thomas Mann, André Malraux, Kenneth Burke, and Lord Raglan. There was also another name—a name that never weighed more heavily than when it was unspoken—which sometimes took longer to come up.\n\n“Heard from Ralph lately?” Bearden would almost whisper as the waitress brought the check.\n\n“Still grieving, I guess,” Murray would rasp back, shaking his head slowly. He was referring to the fire, about a decade earlier, that had destroyed Ellison’s Massachusetts farmhouse and, with it, many months of revisions on his long-awaited second novel. “That fire was a terrible thing.” Then Murray, who was so rarely at a loss for words, would fall silent.\n\nLater, when Bearden and I were alone in his Canal Street loft, he’d return to the subject in hushed tones: “Ralph is mad at Al. No one seems to know why. And it’s killing Al. He’s not sure what he did.”\n\nThe rift, or whatever it amounted to, used to vex and puzzle me. It was a great mistake to regard Murray simply as Ellison’s sidekick, the way many people did, but he was without question the most fervent and articulate champion of Ellison’s art. The two were, in a sense, part of a single project: few figures on the scene shared as many presuppositions and preoccupations as they did. Theirs was a sect far too small for schismatics. At the very least, the rift made things awkward for would-be postulants like me.\n\nWhen “The Omni-Americans” came out, in 1970, I was in college, majoring in history but pursuing extracurricular studies in how to be black. Those were days when the Black Power movement smoldered, when militancy was the mode and rage de rigueur. Just two years before, the poets Larry Neal and Amiri Baraka had edited “Black Fire,” the book that launched the so-called Black Arts movement—in effect, the cultural wing of the Black Power movement. Maybe it was hard to hold a pen with a clenched fist, but you did what you could: the revolution wasn’t about niceties of style anyway. On the occasions when Ralph Ellison, an avatar of elegance, was invited to college campuses, blacks invariably denounced him for his failure to involve himself in the civil-rights struggle, for his evident disdain of the posturings of Black Power. For me, though, the era was epitomized by a reading that the poet Nikki Giovanni gave in a university lecture hall, to a standing-room-only crowd—a sea of colorful dashikis and planetary Afros. Her words seemed incandescent with racial rage, and each poem was greeted with a Black Power salute. “Right on! Right on!” we shouted, in the deepest voices we could manage, each time Giovanni made another grand claim about the blackness of blackness. Those were days when violence (or, anyway, talk of violence) had acquired a Fanonist glamour; when the black bourgeoisie—kulaks of color, nothing more—was reviled as an obstacle on the road to revolution; when the arts were seen as merely an instrumentality for a larger cause.\n\nSuch was the milieu in which Murray published “The Omni-Americans,” and you couldn’t imagine a more foolhardy act. This was a book in which the very language of the black nationalists was subjected to a strip search. Ever since Malcolm X, for instance, the epithet “house Negro” had been a staple of militant invective; yet here was Murray arguing that if only we got our history straight we’d realize that those house Negroes were practically race patriots. (“The house slave seems to have brought infinitely more tactical information from the big house to the cabins than any information about subversive plans he ever took back.”) And while radicals mocked their bourgeois brethren as “black Anglo-Saxons,” Murray defiantly declared, “Not only is it the so-called middle class Negro who challenges the status quo in schools, housing, voting practices, and so on, he is also the one who is most likely to challenge total social structures and value systems.” Celebrated chroniclers of black America, including Claude Brown, Gordon Parks, and James Baldwin, were shown by Murray to be tainted by the ethnographic fallacy, the pretense that one writer’s peculiar experiences can represent a social genus. “This whole thing about somebody revealing what it is really like to be black has long since gotten out of hand anyway,” he wrote. “Does anybody actually believe that, say, Mary McCarthy reveals what it is really like to be a U.S. white woman, or even a Vassar girl?” But he reserved his heaviest artillery for the whole social-science approach to black life, whether in the hands of the psychologist Kenneth Clark (of Brown v. Board of Education fame) or in those of the novelist Richard Wright, who had spent too much time reading his sociologist friends. What was needed wasn’t more sociological inquiry, Murray declared; what was needed was cultural creativity, nourished by the folkways and traditions of black America but transcending them. And the work of literature that best met that challenge, he said, was Ellison’s “Invisible Man.”\n\nThe contrarian held his own simply by matching outrage with outrage—by writing a book that was so pissed-off, jaw-jutting, and unapologetic that it demanded to be taken seriously. Nobody had to tell this veteran about black fire: in Murray the bullies of blackness had met their most formidable opponent. And a great many blacks—who, suborned by “solidarity,” had trained themselves to suppress any heretical thoughts—found Murray’s book oddly thrilling: it had the transgressive frisson of samizdat under Stalinism. You’d read it greedily, though you just might want to switch dust jackets with “The Wretched of the Earth” before wandering around with it in public. “Very early on, he was saying stuff that could get him killed,” the African-American novelist David Bradley says. “And he did not seem to care.” The power of his example lingers. “One February, I had just delivered the usual black-history line, and I was beginning to feel that I was selling snake oil,” Bradley recalls. “And right here was this man who has said this stuff. And I’m thinking, Well, he ain’t dead yet.”\n\nAs if to remove any doubts, Murray has just published two books simultaneously, both with Pantheon. One, “The Seven League Boots,” is his third novel, and completes a trilogy about a bright young fellow named Scooter, his fictional alter ego; the other, “The Blue Devils of Nada,” is a collection of critical essays, analyzing some favorite artists (Ellington, Hemingway, Bearden) and expatiating upon some favorite tenets (the “blues idiom” as an aesthetic substrate, the essentially fluid nature of American culture). Both are books that will be discussed and debated for years to come; both are vintage Murray.\n\nThe most outrageous theorist of American culture lives, as he has lived for three decades, in a modest apartment in Lenox Terrace, in Harlem. When I visit him there, everything is pretty much as I remembered it. The public rooms look like yet another Harlem branch of the New York Public Library. Legal pads and magnifying glasses perch beside his two or three favorite chairs, along with numerous ball-point pens, his weapons of choice. His shelves record a lifetime of enthusiasms; James, Tolstoy, Hemingway, Proust, and Faulkner are among the authors most heavily represented. Close at hand are volumes by favored explicants, such as Joseph Campbell, Kenneth Burke, Carl Jung, Rudolph Arnheim, Bruno Bettelheim, Constance Rourke. On his writing desk sits a more intimate canon. There’s Thomas Mann’s four-volume “Joseph and his Brothers”—the saga, after all, of a slave who gains the power to decide the fate of a people. There’s André Malraux’s “Man’s Fate,” which represented for Ellison and Murray a more rarefied mode of engagé writing than anything their compeers had to offer. There’s Joel Chandler Harris’s “The Complete Tales of Uncle Remus,” a mother lode of African-American folklore. One wall is filled with his famously compendious collection of jazz recordings; a matte-black CD-player was a gift from his protégé Wynton Marsalis. You will not, however, see the sort of framed awards that festooned Ellison’s apartment. “I have received few of those honors,” he says, pulling on his arthritic right leg. “No American Academy, few honorary degrees.”\n\nA quarter of a century has passed since Murray’s literary début, and time has mellowed him not at all. His arthritis may have worsened over the past few years, and there is always an aluminum walker close by, but as he talks he sprouts wings. Murray likes to elaborate on his points and elaborate on his elaborations, until you find that you have circumnavigated the globe and raced through the whole of post-Homeric literary history—and this is what he calls “vamping till ready.” In his conversation, outrages alternate with insights, and often the insights are the outrages. Every literary culture has its superego and its id; Albert Murray has the odd distinction of being both. The contradictions of human nature are, fittingly, a favorite topic of Murray’s. He talks about how Thomas Jefferson was a slaveholder but how he also helped to establish a country whose founding creed was liberty. “Every time I think about it,” he says, “I want to wake him up and give him ten more slaves.” He’s less indulgent of the conflicting impulses of Malcolm X. Dr. King’s strategy of nonviolence was “one of the most magnificent things that anybody ever invented in the civil-rights movement,” he maintains. “And this guy came up and started thumbing his nose at it, and, to my utter amazement, he’s treated as if he were a civil-rights leader. He didn’t lead anything. He was in Selma laughing at these guys. God damn, nigger!”\n\nAlbert Murray is a teacher by temperament, and as he explains a point he’ll often say that he wants to be sure to “work it into your consciousness.” The twentieth century has worked a great deal into Murray’s consciousness. He was fifteen when the Scottsboro trial began, twenty-two when Marian Anderson sang at the Lincoln Memorial. He joined the Air Force when it was segregated and rejoined shortly after it had been desegregated. He was in his late thirties when Brown v. Board of Education was decided, when the conflict in Korea was concluded, when Rosa Parks was arrested. He was in his forties when the Civil Rights Act was passed, when S.N.C.C. was founded, when John F. Kennedy was killed. And he was in his fifties when the Black Panther Party was formed, when King was shot, when Black Power was proclaimed. Such are the lineaments of public history—the sort of grainy national drama that newsreels used to record. For him, though, the figures of history are as vivid as drinking companions, and, on the whole, no more sacrosanct.\n\nHe is equally unabashed about taking on contemporary figures of veneration, even in the presence of a venerator. Thus, about the novelist Toni Morrison, we agree to disagree. “I do think it’s tainted with do-goodism,” he says of her Nobel Prize, rejecting what he considers the special pleading of contemporary feminism. “I think it’s redressing wrongs. You don’t have to condescend to no goddam Jane Austen. Or the Brontës, or George Eliot and George Sand. These chicks are tough. You think you’ll get your fastball by Jane Austen? So we don’t need special pleading for anything. And the same goes for blackness.” He bridles at the phenomenon of Terry McMillan, the best-selling author of “Waiting to Exhale”—or, more precisely, at the nature of the attention she has received. “I think it’s a mistake to try to read some profound political significance into everything, like as soon as a Negro writes it’s got to be some civil-rights thing,” he says. “It’s just Jackie Collins stuff.”\n\nAt times, his pans somehow edge into panegyrics, the result being what might be called a backhanded insult. About Maya Angelou’s much discussed Inaugural poem he says, “It’s like the reaction to ‘Porgy and Bess.’ Man, you put a bunch of brown-skinned people onstage, with footlights and curtains, and they make anything work. White people have no resistance to Negro performers: they charm the pants off anything. Black people make you listen up. They’re singing ‘Old Man River’—‘Tote that barge, lift that bale’? What the fuck is that? Everybody responded like ‘This is great.’ That type of fantastic charm means that black performers can redeem almost any type of pop fare.”\n\nSince discipline and craft are his bywords, however, he distrusts staged spontaneity. “He plays the same note that he perfected twenty-five years ago, and he acts like he’s got to sweat to get the note out of the goddam guitar,” Murray says of the contemporary blues musician B. B. King. “He’s got to shake his head and frown, and it’s just going to be the same goddam note he already played twenty-five years ago.” Murray himself doesn’t mind returning to notes he played twenty-five years ago—his nonfiction books explore the same set of issues, and can be read as chapters of a single ongoing opus. Indeed, from all accounts the fashioning of this particular cultural hero began long before the start of his writing career.\n\nIn Murray’s case, heroism was a matter both of circumstance and of will. Certainly he has long been an avid student of the subject. Lord Raglan’s classic “The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama” (1936) is among the books most frequently cited in his writing, and it remains a part of his personal canon. Moreover, the mythic patterns that Lord Raglan parsed turn out to have had resonances for Murray beyond the strictly literary. According to Raglan’s exhaustively researched generalizations, the hero is highborn, but “the circumstances of his conception are unusual,” and he is “spirited away” to be “reared by foster-parents in a far country.” Then, “on reaching manhood,” he “returns or goes to his future kingdom,” confronts and defeats the king, or a dragon, or some such, and starts being heroic in earnest. So it was, more or less, with Oedipus, Theseus, Romulus, Joseph, Moses, Siegfried, Arthur, Robin Hood, and—oh, yes—Albert Murray.\n\nMurray was born in 1916 and grew up in Magazine Point, a hamlet not far from Mobile, Alabama. His mother was a housewife, and his father, Murray says, was a “common laborer,” who sometimes helped lay railroad tracks as a cross-tie cutter and at other times harvested timber in the Turpentine woods. “As far as the Murrays were concerned, it was a fantastic thing that I finished the ninth grade,” he recalls, “or that I could read the newspaper.” But he had already decided that he was bound for college. Everyone in the village knew that there was something special about him. And he knew it, too.\n\nHe had known it ever since an all-night wake—he was around eleven at the time—when he had fallen asleep in the living room, his head cradled in his mother’s lap. At one point, he surfaced to hear himself being discussed, but, with a child’s cunning, he pretended he was still asleep.\n\n“Tell me something,” a relative was saying. “Is it true that Miss Graham is really his mama?”\n\n“She’s the one brought him into the world,” Mrs. Murray replied. “But I’m his mama. She gave him to me when he was no bigger than a minute, and he was so little I had to put him on a pillow to take him home. I didn’t think he was going to make it. I laid him out for God to take him two or three times. And I said, ‘Lord, this child is here for something, so I’m going to feed this child and he’s going to make it.’ ” It was a moment that Al Murray likens to finding out the truth about Santa Claus.\n\nMurray’s birth parents were, as he slowly learned, well educated and securely middle class—people who belonged to an entirely different social stratum from that of his adoptive parents. His natural father, John Young, came from a well-established family in town. His natural mother had been attending Tuskegee as a boarding student and working part time for John Young’s aunt and uncle, who were in the real-estate business. When she learned that a close encounter with John Young had left her pregnant, she had to leave town—“because of the disgrace,” Murray explains. As luck would have it, a cousin of hers knew a married woman who, unable to bear a child of her own, was interested in adopting one. Murray doesn’t have to be prodded to make the fairy-tale connection. “It’s just like the prince left among the paupers,” he says cheerfully. (In “The Omni-Americans” he wrote, apropos of the 1965 Moynihan report on the breakdown of the black-family structure, “How many epic heroes issue from conventional families?”)\n\nAs a freshman at the Tuskegee Institute—the ancestral kingdom he was fated to enter—Murray became aware of a junior whose reading habits were alarmingly similar to his. He was a music major from Oklahoma named Ralph Waldo Ellison, and what first impressed Murray about him was his wardrobe. “Joe College, right out of Esquire—he had fine contrasting slacks, gray tweed jacket. He would be wearing bow ties and two-tone shoes,” Murray recalls. “In those days, when you checked out a book from the library you had a little slip in the back where you would write your name, and then they would stamp the due date.” Consequently, when Murray took out a book by, say, T. S. Eliot or Robinson Jeffers, he could see who had previously borrowed the book. Time and again, it was that music major with the two-tone shoes.\n\nEllison left Tuskegee for New York before completing his senior year: his absence was meant to be temporary, a means of saving some money, but he never went back. Murray earned his B.A. at Tuskegee in 1939, and stayed on to teach. In 1941, he married Mozelle Menefee, who was a student there. He spent the last two years of the Second World War on active duty in the Air Force. “I was just hoping I’d live long enough for Thomas Mann to finish the last volume of ‘Joseph and His Brothers,’ ” he says. Two years after his discharge, he moved to New York, where, on the G.I. bill, he got a master’s degree in literature from New York University. It was also in New York that the friendship between him and Ellison took off. Ellison read passages to Murray from a manuscript that would turn into “Invisible Man.” The two men explored the streets and the sounds of Harlem together; over meals and over drinks, they hashed out ideas about improvisation, the blues, and literary modernism. Even then, Murray had a reputation as a “great explainer.”\n\nThe prominent black religious and literary scholar Nathan A. Scott, who was a graduate student in New York in the forties and had become a friend of Ellison’s, tells about being in the Gotham Book Mart one day and noticing another black man there. “I was somewhat surprised to find this slight, dark man there, because I’d never bumped into a Negro there,” Scott recounts. “And some young white chap came in and they knew each other and immediately plunged into a spirited conversation, and at a certain point I overheard this chap say to the black man, ‘Well, what are you working on these days?’ To which the black chap replied, ‘Oh, I am doing an essay in self-definition.’ ” (And Scott laughs loudly.) Later, at a dinner at Ellison’s apartment, Ellison introduced Scott to his friend Albert Murray: “Immediately, I thought, By God, here is the chap who was doing that essay in self-definition! Inwardly, I laughed all over again.”\n\nIf it was clear that the young man was interested in trying to write, it wasn’t so clear what the results were. In the early fifties, Saul Bellow and Ralph Ellison shared a house in Dutchess County, and Bellow recalls seeing Murray from time to time down in the city. “I think he agreed with Ralph, in simply assuming that they were deeply installed in the whole American picture,” Bellow says. He adds that Ellison talked about Murray’s writing in those days, but that he himself never saw any of it. In 1952, Ellison published “Invisible Man.” The book was a best-seller for several months, and garnered some of the most enthusiastic critical responses anyone could remember. It was soon a classroom staple, the subject of books and dissertations. It was read and reread. Ellison, in short, had become an immortal. And Murray? With a wife and a daughter to support, he was pursuing a more conventional career—in the Air Force, which he rejoined in 1951.\n\nAs a military officer, Murray taught courses in geopolitics in the Air Force R.O.T.C. program at Tuskegee, where he was based for much of the fifties, and he oversaw the administration of large-scale technical operations both in North Africa and in the United States. While his military career has remained oddly isolated from his creative work—a matter of regret, in the opinion of some of his friends—the experience would leave him impatient with the pretensions of the by-any-means-necessary brigade. He says, in that distinctively Murrayesque tone of zestful exasperation, “Let’s talk about ‘the fire next time.’ You know damn well they can put out the fire by Wednesday.”\n\nWhen Murray retired from the military, in 1962, he moved to New York, and soon his articles began to appear in periodicals (Life, The New Leader) and collections (“Anger, and Beyond”). In 1964, Ellison wrote a letter about his old friend to one Jacob Cohen, who was planning to start a magazine. “Actually I find it very difficult to write about him,” the letter began. “I suppose because I have known him since our days at Tuskegee, and because our contacts since that time have been so constant and our assumptions about so many matters in such close agreement that I really don’t have the proper sense of perspective.” Ellison went on to say of Murray, “He has the imagination which allows him to project himself into the centers of power, and he uses his imagination to deal with serious problems seriously and as though he were a responsible participant in the affairs of our nation and our time.” The following year, a panel of book critics, authors, and editors found “Invisible Man” to be the most widely admired novel published since the Second World War. Meanwhile, Albert Murray, then two years out of the Air Force, was scarcely known outside the circle of his acquaintances.\n\nHowever asymmetric the public stature of the pair, people who spent time with Murray and Ellison in those days were impressed by the ease and intimacy of their friendship. In the late sixties, Willie Morris, then the editor of Harper’s, eagerly sought their company: they provided him with a refreshing contrast to what he found a suffocating literary climate. He recalls, “In every way, they were like brothers—you know, soul brothers and fellow-writers—but Ellison’s star was so bright, and Al was just really getting started.” Soul brothers they may have been; they were also brothers-in-arms. When Murray rose to do battle with the rising ranks of black nationalism, he knew he shared a foxhole with Ralph Ellison, and there must have been comfort in that.\n\nIt may seem ironic that the person who first urged “The Omni-Americans” on me was Larry Neal, one of the Black Arts founders. But Neal was a man of far greater subtlety than the movement he spawned, and he understood Albert Murray’s larger enterprise—the one that he shared with Ellison—better than most. People who may not read Murray but like the idea of him reflexively label him an “integrationist”; seldom do they take in the term’s full complexity. In Murray’s hands, integration wasn’t an act of accommodation but an act of introjection. Indeed, at the heart of Murray and Ellison’s joint enterprise was perhaps the most breathtaking act of cultural chutzpah this land had witnessed since Columbus blithely claimed it all for Isabella.\n\nIn its bluntest form, their assertion was that the truest Americans were black Americans. For much of what was truly distinctive about America’s “national character” was rooted in the improvisatory prehistory of the blues. The very sound of American English “is derived from the timbre of the African voice and the listening habits of the African ear,” Ellison maintained. “If there is such a thing as a Yale accent, there is a Negro wail in it.” This is the lesson that the protagonist of Ellison’s novel learns while working at a paint factory: the whitest white is made by adding a drop of black. For generations, the word “American” had tacitly connoted “white.” Murray inverted the cultural assumptions and the verbal conventions: in his discourse, “American,” roughly speaking, means “black.” So, even as the clenched-fist crowd was scrambling for cultural crumbs, Murray was declaring the entire harvest board of American civilization to be his birthright. In a sense, Murray was the ultimate black nationalist. And the fact that people so easily mistook his vision for its opposite proved how radical it was.\n\nBut why stop with matters American? What did the European savants of Existentialism understand about la condition humaine that Ma Rainey did not? In later works, most notably “Stomping the Blues” (1976), Murray took the blues to places undreamed-of by its originators. It has long been a commonplace that the achievements of black music have far outstripped those of black literature—that no black writer has produced work of an aesthetic complexity comparable to Duke Ellington’s, Count Basie’s, or Charlie Parker’s. This much, for Murray, was a point of departure: he sought to process the blues into a self-conscious aesthetic, to translate the deep structure of the black vernacular into prose. Arguably, LeRoi Jones attempted something similar in his celebrated “Blues People” (1963), but there sociology gained the upper hand over art. (Ellison, writing in The New York Review of Books, complained that Jones’s approach was enough to “give even the blues the blues.”) To Murray, the blues stood in opposition to all such reductionism. “What it all represents is an attitude toward the nature of human experience (and the alternatives of human adjustment) that is both elemental and comprehensive,” he wrote in “Stomping the Blues,” and he continued:\n\nIt is a statement about confronting the complexities inherent in the human situation and about improvising or experimenting or riffing or otherwise playing with (or even gambling with) such possibilities as are also inherent in the obstacles, the disjunctures, and the jeopardy. It is also a statement about perseverance and about resilience and thus also about the maintenance of equilibrium despite precarious circumstances and about achieving elegance in the very process of coping with the rudiments of subsistence.\n\nThough Murray’s salvific conception of the blues may seem fantastical, it represented precisely the alternative that Larry Neal and others were searching for. In truth, you could no more capture the sublimity of music in earthbound prose than you could trap the moon’s silvery reflection in a barrel of rainwater, but there was heroism, surely, in the effort.\n\nNor was it only literature that could be revivified by jazz and the blues. That was where Bearden came in, and that was why his friendship with Murray had to be understood also as an artistic alliance. Bearden’s mixed-media works could serve as a cultural paradigm for the kind of bricolage and hybridity that Murray favored.\n\nIn recent stanzas entitled “Omni-Albert Murray” the young African-American poet Elizabeth Alexander writes, “In my mind and in his I think a painting is a poem / A tambourine’s a hip shake and train whistle a guitar.” Certainly Murray proved an authoritative exponent of Bearden’s works, the titles of which were frequently of his devising. The literary scholar Robert O’Meally remembers being with Bearden and Murray in Books & Company when the two were trying to decide on a name for whatever picture Bearden had brought along that day. O’Meally recalls, “It might be that Al Murray’s eye was caught by the figure of a woman in one corner of the image. And he’d say, ‘Who’s that?’ And Bearden would be looking embarrassed, because the woman in question had been an old girlfriend of his. Maybe Bearden would say, ‘Oh, she’s just a woman I once knew from North Carolina.’ And then Murray would say, ‘I’ve got it. Let’s call it “Red-Headed Woman from North Carolina.” ’ Or, ‘I know, call it “Red-Headed Woman from North Carolina with Rooster.” ’ And Bearden would go and write that on the back of his painting.”\n\nMurray stood ready to assist in other ways, too. When, in 1978, I asked Bearden if he would conduct a seminar on Afro-American art at Yale, where I was teaching, his immediate response was “Why don’t you ask Al?” But this particular appointment called for an artist, and Bearden finally did accept, though with genuine reluctance and vehement protestations of pedagogic incompetence. So reluctant was he that I was astonished by the remarkably well-organized and cogent weekly lectures he had prepared—always neatly double-spaced and fifty minutes in duration, the precise length of the academic lecturer’s hour. Comprehension soon dawned. Bearden, taking matters into his own hands, had found a way to bring Murray along to New Haven: the critic had ghostwritten Professor Bearden’s erudite lectures.\n\nBut did Murray have debts of his own to acknowledge—in particular, to his Tuskegee schoolmate? The very similarity of their preoccupations proved a source of friction. Now it was Murray—here, there, and everywhere—spreading the glad word about the literary theorist Kenneth Burke, about Lord Raglan, about the luminous blending of craft and metaphysics represented by André Malraux and by Thomas Mann. Ellison’s claim, at least to Kenneth Burke and Lord Raglan, seems clear: they were part of the swirl of ideas at Bennington College in the early fifties, when Ellison was living nearby and socializing with the faculty. One writer who had been friendly with both Murray and Ellison since the forties assures me that he has no doubt as to who was the exegete and who the originator: “This is not to say that Al was simply some sort of epigone. But all the fundamental ideas that are part of ‘The Omni-Americans’ came from Ellison. Al made his own music out of those ideas, but I know where they came from. The course of thought that Murray began to follow in the sixties was a result of Ralph’s influence, I think there is no doubt about this at all.”\n\nThat has become something of a consensus view. In a recent appreciation of Murray, the jazz critic Gene Seymour writes that on such subjects as improvisation, discipline, and tradition Murray (and, by extension, disciples of his like Stanley Crouch and Wynton Marsalis) sounds “like an echo.” He maintains that the recently published volume of Ellison’s collected essays “makes clear [that] Ellison was the wellspring for the ideals advanced by Murray, Crouch, and Marsalis.”\n\nIt’s a thorny subject. At one point, Murray tells me about V. S. Naipaul’s visit with him in the late eighties—a visit that was recorded in Naipaul’s “A Turn in the South.” Naipaul wrote, “He was a man of enthusiasms, easy to be with, easy to listen to. His life seemed to have been a series of happy discoveries.” At the same time, Naipaul identified Murray as a writer who “was, or had been, a protégé of Ralph Ellison’s.” Murray makes it clear that this gloss does not sit well with him. He counters by quoting something that Robert Bone, a pioneering scholar of African-American literature, told him: “I’ve been trying to figure out who is the protégé of whom.”\n\nBone, an acquaintance of both principals, suggests beginning with a different set of premises. “On Murray’s part, it must have been a terribly difficult thing for him to have been overshadowed by Ralph in terms of the timing of their two careers,” he says. “In a way, they started out together at Tuskegee, and then they cemented that friendship in New York, but Murray got such a later start in his career as a writer. So when he came on the scene Ralph was, of course, a celebrity.” What escapes us, Bone says, is that many of the positions with which Ellison was associated were ones the two had mulled over together and corresponded about—especially “the link between Afro-American writing and Afro-American music.” Reverse all your assumptions, though, and one thing remains constant: “Murray, I think, naturally must have felt a good deal of envy and resentment.” Where others see Darwin and Huxley, Bone sees Watson and Crick. Of Ellison and Murray he says, “There was a time when they were both young and aspiring writers, and they shared these ideas and they worked on them together, but Ralph got into print with them first, by a kind of accident.” Speaking like a true literary historian, he adds, “I think these matters will be resolved when Murray leaves his papers—he has a box full of correspondence with Ellison. I think that that correspondence is going to bring out the mutuality of these explorations and discoveries.”\n\nIt’s clear that, beneath Ellison’s unfailingly courtly demeanor, his own internal struggles may have taken their toll. The fire, in the fall of 1967, is often mentioned as a watershed moment for him, one whose symbolic freight would only increase over the years. He had been busy that summer in his Massachusetts farmhouse, making extensive revisions on his novel in progress—Murray recalls seeing a manuscript thick with interlinear emendations during a visit there. At times, Ellison had called Murray to read him some of the new material. The fire occurred on the very evening that the Ellisons had decided to return to New York. Murray says, “He packed up all his stuff and got everything together, put it all in the hallway leading out, with some of his cameras and some of his shooting equipment. Then they went out to dinner with Richard Wilbur. On the way home, when they got to a certain point, they saw this fire reflection on the skyline, and, the nearer they got, the more it seemed like it was their place. And as they turned in, they saw their house going up in flames.” Ellison had a copy of the manuscript in New York, but the rewriting and rethinking that had occupied him for months were lost. “So he went into shock, really. He just closed off from everybody.” Murray didn’t hear from him until Christmas. In the months that followed, Ellison would sometimes call Murray up and read him passages—trying to jog Murray’s memory so that he would jog Ellison’s. “It took him years to recover,” Murray says. Meanwhile, Murray’s career was following an opposite trajectory. As if making up for lost time, he spent the first half of the seventies averaging a book a year; during the same period, Ellison’s block as a novelist had grown to mythic proportions. Bellow says, “Ralph was suffering very deeply from his hangup, and it was very hard to have any connection with him. He got into a very strange state, I think.”\n\nDid Ellison feel betrayed? It seems clear that he did. (“Romie used to call it ‘Oklahoma paranoia,’ ” Murray says, musing on the froideur that settled between them.) Did Ellison have reason to? That’s harder to answer. The African-American poet Michael S. Harper, an Ellison stalwart, says, “The most important word I ever heard Ralph say was the word ‘honor.’ I happen to know some of the difficulties they went through when Albert was in a phase of making appearances in white literary salons, and reports came back from various people.” Theories of the estrangement abound. One writer acquainted with the two men says that Ellison had learned that Murray was bad-mouthing him; another suggests that Ellison simply felt crowded, that Murray was presenting himself as Ellison’s confidant—“as the man to see if you want to know”—in a way that Ellison found unseemly. The chill could make things awkward for acquaintances. One of them says, “I remember on one occasion Ralph and I were lunching at the Century Club, when Al saw me in the downstairs lobby. He came up immediately and we chatted briefly, and as we were talking to each other Ralph walked away and would have nothing to do with Al. Theirs had become a difficult relationship.”\n\nMurray, for his part, is inclined to see the matter in almost anthropological terms, as falling into the behavior patterns of out-group representatives amid an in-group: “Here’s a guy who figures that he’s got his white folks over here, and he got them all hoodwinked, so he don’t want anybody coming in messing things up.” In anthropological terms, the native informant never relishes competition. “Hell, it was probably inevitable,” Willie Morris says of the estrangement.\n\nFor all their similarities in background, education, sensibility, even dress (they shared a tailor, Charlie Davidson, himself something of a legend in sartorial circles), the two men inclined toward rather contrasting styles of public presentation. A private man who in later years grew intensely aware of being a public figure, Ellison had contrived a persona designed to defeat white expectations of black brutishness. Hence the same words come up again and again when people try to write about him—words like “patrician,” “formal,” “aristocratic,” “mandarin,” “civilized,” “dignified.” James Baldwin once observed, shrewdly, that Ellison was “as angry as anybody can be and still live.” It was this banked anger that kept his back so straight in public settings, his manners so impeccable; even his spoken sentences wore spats and suspenders. Murray, who enjoyed verbal sparring as much as anybody, lacked that gift of anger, and as a conversationalist he had always taken delight in the saltier idioms of the street. (Imagine Redd Foxx with a graduate degree in literature.) The writer Reynolds Price, a friend of both Ellison and Murray, says, “Ralph had a kind of saturnine, slightly bemused quality. I thought Al always seemed the more buoyant person.”\n\nWriting is at once a solitary and a sociable act, and literary relationships are similarly compounded of opposites. So it was with Ellison and Murray, two country cousins. Many people speak of Ellison’s eightieth-birthday party—to which Murray had been invited and at which he delivered a moving tribute to his old schoolmate—as a significant moment of reconciliation. “I think it was Ellison’s way of reaching out to Murray,” a friend of Ellison’s says.\n\nThen, too, for all his companionability, Murray’s literary inclinations ran strongly toward the paternal. He takes deep satisfaction in that role, and there are many who can attest to his capacity for nurturance. James Alan McPherson, one of the fiction writers who have most often been likened to Ellison, recalls a time in the late seventies when he was in Rhode Island with Michael Harper, the poet, and Ernest J. Gaines, whose novels include “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.” In a moment of mad enthusiasm, they hit on the idea of going to New York and letting Ellison know how much they admired him. When they phoned him, he told them, to their unbounded joy, that they should come right down. And so, after an almost mythic trek, these young black writers arrived at Riverside Drive to pay a visit to their hero.\n\n“Mr. Ellison can’t see you,” they were told at the door. “He’s busy working.”\n\nThey were crushed. They were also adrift: with the destination of their pilgrimage closed to them, they had no place to go. “So we called Al Murray, and he picked up the slack,” McPherson recounts. “He brought us to his apartment, where he had some apples and some bourbon and some fancy French cheese. And he said, ‘Have you ever met Duke Ellington’s sister?’ We said no, so he took us over to meet Duke Ellington’s sister. And he said, ‘Do you want to see the Bearden retrospective?’ ” He took them to the Brooklyn Museum and on to the Cordier and Ekstrom gallery, where Bearden was then showing his work. “And I’ll always remember Al for that,” McPherson says. (Murray tells me, “Most guys forget that I’m just two years younger than Ralph, but they feel closer to me because I’m more accessible. They kid with me all the time.”) Perhaps, in the end, Ellison was the better student of Lord Raglan: he knew that patricide, or some variant of it, was a staple of heroic literature. McPherson says, quietly, “Ellison didn’t want any sons.”\n\nFor McPherson, what crystallized things was a ceremony that City College held in 1984 to honor Ellison. McPherson and Harper were both there to give tributes. At the luncheon, Harper tapped on his glass and handed Ellison a wrapped box, saying, “Ralph, here’s a gift from your sons.”\n\n“Then you’d better open it yourself,” Ellison replied dryly. “I’m afraid it might explode.”\n\nAlbert Murray has now reached the age where his progeny have progeny, two of the most prominent in his line being, of course, Stanley Crouch and Wynton Marsalis. Both are frequent guests at Lenox Terrace, and Marsalis tells me of dinner-table conversations that roam from Homer to Galileo, from the commedia dell’arte to Faulkner and Neruda. “Murray has given me a first-class education,” he says. And he speaks eloquently about the impact that “Stomping the Blues,” and Murray’s very notion of jazz as an art form, had on him; he speaks about tradition, blues idioms, a poetics of inclusion. As he puts it, “I’m a Murrayite.” Crouch, whose writing has brilliantly championed Murray’s difficult aesthetic and emulated his pugnacious style of critique, says, “I think he’s one of the foremost thinkers to appear in American letters over the last twenty-five years.” (He also suggests that Murray would have been a far worthier candidate for a Nobel Prize than Toni Morrison.) “The last of the giants,” McPherson calls him.\n\nThere is much to be said for having descendants. They spread the insights you have given them. They worry about why you are not better known. (Crouch has a simple explanation for Murray’s relative obscurity: “It’s because he spent all that time on the Basie book—there was that very long silence. I think what happened was that his career lost momentum.”) They remind you, fetchingly, of your own callow youth. And they take inspiration from your fearless style of analysis and critique, and apply it to your own work—though this can be a mixed blessing.\n\nNo doubt it’s the ultimate tribute to Murray’s legacy of combative candor that his most fervid admirers are quite free in expressing their critical reservations—notably with regard to the new novel. “The Seven League Boots” has the distinction of being the least autobiographical of Murray’s three novels: its protagonist leaves Alabama with his bass and joins up with a legendary jazz band—one not unlike Ellington’s. The band is blissfully free of quarrels and petty jealousies, and Murray’s alter ego, Scooter, inspires only affection in those he encounters. Indeed, this is, in no small part, a novel about friendships, about literary and intellectual conversations and correspondences, including those between Scooter and his old college roommate. On a trip across the Mississippi River Bridge, Scooter finds himself thinking about\n\nmy old roommate again. But this time the writer he brought to mind was not Rilke but Walt Whitman, about whom he had said in response to my letter about joining the band for a while. . . . According to my old roommate, old Walt Whitman, barnstorming troubadour par excellence that he was, could only have been completely delighted with the interplay of aesthetic and pragmatic considerations evidenced in the maps and mileage charts and always tentative itineraries. . . . It was Ralph Waldo Emerson who spoke of “melodies that ascend and leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time,” my roommate also wrote, which, by the way, would make a very fine blurb for a Louis Armstrong solo such as the one on “Potato Head Blues.”\n\nIn the next few pages, there are allusions to, among others, Melville, James Joyce, Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Constance Rourke, Frederick Douglass, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Antonin Dvorak. Perhaps the critic’s library overstocks his novelistic imagination. In the Times Book Review, the novelist and critic Charles Johnson—who must be counted among Murray’s heirs, and is certainly among his most heartfelt admirers—described it as “a novel without tension.” It may well be that the pleasures this novel affords are more discursive than dramatic, more essayistic than narrative. Murray tells me, “I write hoping that the most sophisticated readers of my time will think that I’m worth reading.” They do, and he is.\n\nThe poet Elizabeth Alexander writes:\n\nAlbert Murray do they call you Al"
