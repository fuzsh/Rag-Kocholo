        "text": "Beer-drinking-bigot and UKIP leader Nigel Farage has some new election competition, in the form of Al Murray's comedy character, the Pub Landord.\n\nYep, the famous comedian has officially confirmed that his Pub Landlord persona has created his own political party - the Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP) - and he will be standing for a seat in the same Kent constituency as Farage.\n\nBecause - in the Pub Landlord's own words - \"It seems to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around offering common sense solutions.\" And that we are, which is why we think it's bloody brilliant that he's going to show Nigel Farage up on his home turf.\n\nIn the Youtube video launching his intentions for parliament, the leader of FUKP (whose Twitter page can be viewed here) did issue a proviso. But we must admit, we do appreciate his optimistic honesty, which is something that we can all agree is somewhat lacking in our previous politicians.\n\n\"Let it be known, that like many of the parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is. But did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No.\" he says. Point well made, Pub Landlord.\n\nSo here is the Pub Landlord's common sense manifesto, via Twitter, proving that this man truly understands the needs and desires of the 21st century:\n\n6 THINGS WE WANT FROM THIS YEAR'S ELECTION"
