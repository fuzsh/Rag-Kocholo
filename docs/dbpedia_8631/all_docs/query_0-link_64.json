Tickets are now on sale from https://www.thephoenixtheatre.co.uk/shows/idiots-assemble-spitting-image-the-musical.\n\nIntroduced by Master of Ceremonies Sir Ian McKellen, the musical features a stellar line-up of over 100 puppets of the great and the not so good. Tom Cruise is tasked by His Majesty The King to create the UK’s very own ‘Magnificent Seven’ of celebrity misfits – Tom Cruise, Greta Thunberg, Meghan Markle, Tyson Fury, RuPaul, Angela Rayner and Idris Elba – to save the nation from a cabal of dark forces seeking to destroy it – that’s all the usual suspects. And James Corden. They are joined by: Ant & Dec, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Keir Starmer, Stormzy, Vladimir Putin, The Tory Party Cabinet and many many many many many more.\n\n‘When Spitting Image first appeared on British TV it blew people’s minds,’ said Al Murray ‘Now it’s going to do it all over again in the West End. All the elements the show was famed for: outrageous depictions of the great and the not so good, catchy songs, famous faces saying the things you’ve always wanted to hear them say, all reinvented for the stage. You won’t know where to look!’\n\nMatt Forde commented: ‘Nothing can prepare you for what you’re about to see, it’s the wildest show in the West End. I don’t want to give anything away, but you’ll never look at Suella Braverman in the same way again.’\n\nSean Foley added: ‘I’m thrilled that Spitting Image The Musical is set to transfer to the West End. Audiences at Birmingham Rep, where the show premiered, loved the classic Spitting Image mix of political satire, celebrity send up and Royal family soap opera. With Rishi Sunak and Angela Rayner battling it out, Tom Cruise making his theatrical debut and Adele singing her heart out, I hope this uniquely anarchic musical will continue to make people laugh.’\n\nphoto at the Birmingham Rep by: Mark Senior\n\nThe full creative team is: Director Sean Foley, writers Al Murray, Matt Forde andSean Foley, Caricaturist Supremo Roger Law, Set Designer, Alice Power, Video Designer Nina Dunn for Pixel Lux, Lighting Designer Tim Mitchell, Puppet Master Scott Brooker, Costume Designer Lotte Collet, Choreographer Lizzi Gee, Incidental Music Composer and Musical Director Alexander S.
