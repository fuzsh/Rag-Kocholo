        "text": "Anna Sonny, 16 January 2015\n\nBritish comedian Al Murray has announced that he will stand for MP, against UKIP leader Nigel Farage in South Thanet, Kent at the general election in May this year. Murray will stand as his character Pub Landlord, for his newly formed Free the United Kingdom Party, which shortens, somewhat conveniently, to FUKP. In his campaign video, the comedian poses with a pint in a clear parody of Farage, who is often seen with a pint in his hand.\n\nMurray’s unexpected decision follows on from an unexpected year for British politics. Last year UKIP’s promised political earthquake appeared to take effect, occurring along the fault lines of division in the Conservative Party over the thorny issue of Europe; UKIP gained two MPs and welcomed a fair few defectors. As though this year’s general election were not unpredictable enough, with no party looking set to gain a majority at the polls, Murray’s decision to stand could add some more uncertainty into the mix, deflecting some of Farage’s anticipated votes.\n\nLast year, comedian Russell Brand also waded into the political forum – but without the comedy, and without much action. Brand talked (a lot) about a revolution, but was accused of being unrealistic in trying to represent people who cannot relate to his wealth, and was criticised for not really doing anything at all, except talking. Murray is clever to do this under the guise of the Pub Landlord; his persona gives him the distance and ammunition needed to mock the idea of personality winning votes; or more specifically, personality with a nonsense policy disguised as ‘common sense’.\n\nIn the midst of his common sense policies, which include valuing the pound at £1.10 and offering 1p pints, Murray hits on something important: ‘The reason I’m standing is because the system is broken. We all know it is.’\n\nMurray has been criticised by UKIP MEP David Coburn for making fun of South Thanet voters, and has been accused of hijacking the democratic process for a publicity stunt.\n\nBut hopefully Murray’s campaign might succeed in turning the political debate away from the endlessly rotating axis of Europe and immigration, which has been the cornerstone of Ukip’s success, and into a more reflective stance on the British political scene at the moment. Many voters complain that it is hard to distinguish between the major political parties at the moment; at least Murray has given us an easily discernible character and may add some much needed humour to the campaigns."
