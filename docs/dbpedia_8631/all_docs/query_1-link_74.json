        "text": "Al Murray has signed a book deal to unleash the Pub Landlord's political manifesto.\n\nLet's Re-Great Britain will be released on April Fools' Day, a month before he intends to stand for election in Nigel Farage's constituency.\n\nThe Pub Landlord plans to stand for his own Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP) in the constituency of South Thanet in May.\n\n\"There is room in the bland world of British politics for someone who isn't afraid of standing up being an actual character,\" he said. \"A character not afraid to cut through the waffle of modern politics, not afraid to tell you the things he reckons you want to hear.\"\n\nThe book will include FUKP's full plans, such as its proposed Cabinet, including 'Charlie off of Casualty' as Secretary of State for Health and Jimmy Carr as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nHe will also list inspirational 'Great Britons' who have helped shape his political journey, including 'Sralan Lord Sugar' and 'Dame Katie Hopkins'.\n\nThe manifesto includes making Â£1 now worth Â£1.10, and appointing former SNP leader Alex Salmond the first minister for Norwich.\n\nOn May 7, the people of South Thanet will have the option of voting for him to be their representative in parliament."
