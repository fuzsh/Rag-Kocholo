        "text": "Shopping With Keith Lemon, Evil Genius With Russell Kane and Al Murray's Why Does Everyone Hate have all been dropped by their broadcasters.\n\nThe Keith Lemon show launched on ITV2 in 2019 and featured Leigh Francis’s character interviewing celebrities as they shop. Jimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Katherine Ryan and Judi Love were among those who took part in the 34 episodes.\n\nAn ITV spokesperson said: ‘There are no current plans for a new series but the show will continue to have a regular presence across both ITV2 and ITVX with repeat programming.’\n\nThe news comes two years after Keith Lemon’s Celebrity Juice was axed by ITV2.\n\nMeanwhile ,Sky History has dropped its two comedian-fronted shows. A spokesperson for the channel told the British Comedy Guide: ‘We don't currently have a plan to recommission those shows’.\n\nEvil Genius – an adaptation of Kane's long-running Radio 4 podcast reassessing the reputations of historical figures – ran for just five episodes late last year.\n\nAnd Murray made three series of his Why Does Everyone Hate…: Why Does Everyone Hate The English? in 2018 followed by Why Do The Brits Win Every War? and Why Does Everyone Hate The British Empire?\n\nAny money you contribute will directly fund more reviews, interviews and features – the sort of in-depth coverage that is increasingly difficult to fund from ever-squeezed advertising income, but which we think the UK’s vibrant comedy scene deserves."
