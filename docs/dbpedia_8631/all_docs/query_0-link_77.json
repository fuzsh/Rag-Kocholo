        "text": "“I’m looking forward to people saying, ‘Why do you hate our country, you traitor?’” says Al Murray. The 55-year-old comedian and writer’s new series, Why Does Everyone Hate the British Empire?, is a jovial yet nuanced look at the history and legacy of Britain’s colonial rule. He already predicts it will be a bit too jovial and nuanced for some. “I’m also gonna have people going, ‘Why are you an apologist for Imperialism?’” He smiles at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\nSuch is modern online discourse: Murray thinks he’s damned if he does, damned if he doesn’t. “Comedians keep being told that we’re supposed to talk about difficult things, that we’re supposed to tackle the difficult stuff, right? And then when we do, we get told to shut up,” he says, exasperated. “So, which is it?”\n\nMurray is on video call from his home in Chiswick, wet London, wearing a neat moustache thanks to his current role as Charles II in The Crown Jewels, a play about the heist on the king’s jewellery – surrounded by guitars and an expensive-looking drum kit (he’s a semi-pro drummer and fan of prog rock).\n\nHe is of course best known for his brilliant comic creation The Pub Landlord, the patriotic, ale-drinking, straight-talking Little Englander sticking up for good old-fashioned British values and prejudices (“We need a war every 10 years so we can stay match-fit in case the Germans try again”). The act remains popular; Murray tours as The Pub Landlord next year.\n\nBut Murray’s true passion could well be history, particularly of the military kind. Born in Buckinghamshire, he was privately educated at Bedford School before studying history at Oxford, though his interest is in part familial: his dad was a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Engineers.\n\nHe’s now considered something of an authority on the subject: his podcast on the Second World War with historian James Holland, We Have Ways of Making You Talk, is so popular it has spawned its own festival; Murray’s most recent book Command details how the Allied forces eventually secured victory over Germany; his new series is the third similarly themed programme for Sky History after 2018’s Why Does Everyone Hate the English? and Why Do the British Win Every War? (2020). I find that once he gets talking about this stuff, he’s hard to rein in.\n\nBut Murray knows the British Empire is an altogether more contentious subject. He says he’s not in the business of changing minds – “I’ve always been of the view that when you read history you should make your own mind up about it” – but instead wants to offer an overlooked context, and differing viewpoints. “I think what’s very often missing from the debate about empire in the UK is people from Jamaica, people from Australia, South Africans, Indians,” he says. “And that in a way strikes me as quite colonial – ‘Who cares what the people there think?’”\n\nIn the series, Murray does a good job of giving indigenous people a voice. For each episode, he travels to four of the Empire’s former colonies with a local comedian Anuvab Pal in India, Loyiso Gola in South Africa, Kevin Kropinyeri in Australia and Chris Daley in Jamaica – to discuss with other local historians and experts the origin and legacy of British rule.\n\nComedians being comedians, there are plenty of jokes – Murray even uses The Pub Landlord to humorously recap events “as a kind of drawbridge” between topics – but it treats the subject with the requisite seriousness. The Empire’s atrocities are discussed: slavery in Jamaica, the displacement of Aboriginal people in Australia, the invention of concentration camps in South Africa.\n\nBut in the series, and in conversation, Murray is careful not to give away his own opinion too much. He does the same with The Pub Landlord. “I’ve always tried to make sure that no one knows if I think any of what he says or not. I’ve never tried to take sides.”\n\nSo while he’s critical of many aspects of empire, he is also even-handed discussing the context. He points out to me that empire wasn’t a singularly British invention (“Empire seems to be a political direction of travel which is not an unusual expression of human nature and politics”); that you have to take into account this was a long time ago (“They did have different standards at the time, and you do need to bear that in mind”); and that some legacies – the railways in India, the rum industry in Jamaica – have been of benefit to shaping these modern societies.\n\n“You can’t unscramble the eggs. You can’t unscramble the legacy of slavery. Rum is a cool thing out of Jamaica. But you just have to look where it came from.”\n\nYet on potential reparations for countries and communities wronged by empire, he says: “You come away thinking it’s not such a bad idea. But good luck getting it out of the current British political culture. No political party in this country will agree to that. And newspapers would hang so much shit if any British government would try and do that.”\n\nEmpire is indeed a hot rod political issue emblematic of the culture wars: a thing to be either be ashamed of, or celebrate. As if to prove the point, in the run up to our interview Scottish Liberal Democrats MSP Wille Rennie said that Scotland, and Glasgow in particular, needs to better acknowledge its colonial past (Murray actually talks of Scotland’s involvement in the slave trade in Jamaica in the series; by 1800 Scotland owned 32 per cent of enslaved people.)\n\n“’Needs’ is a very interesting word, isn’t it?” Murray says. “Needs to what end?” He says that while many in the UK think “we really ought to be bothered about the things we did 300 years ago, you go to one of those countries and the people are going, ‘It’s not relevant. We’ve got much more immediate problems’.”\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Jacob Rees-Mogg recently said (to no great surprise) that empire was something to be proud of. “Well, if he’s cherry picked the bits that make him proud, I’m sure it is. I mean, you’ve got to really look. You need a big, high tall cherry picker to go off and get them cherries.” Rees-Mogg also tubthumped about the Empire’s ability to get things done compared to the modern-day civil servants in Whitehall. “Just whatever,” says Murray. “Let him have his fun.”\n\nBut is there not a wider point here about the damaging hold empire has on the mindset of some people in this country, who ignore its wrongs and see it as aspirational? “It’s very, very powerful,” he agrees. “Again, he [Rees-Mogg] is a politician, so what’s he looking for? He’s looking for votes. He’s looking for people thinking he’s a solid fellow. So he’s saying the ‘right thing’. I don’t know what he [really] thinks. But I know what I think of what he’s saying – ‘Oh, stroll on mate’.”\n\nMurray is no stranger to politics. For one, The Pub Landlord has, as Murray puts it, been “turbocharged by topicality” as the attitudes that led some people to vote for Brexit became mainstream.\n\nWhen he started The Pub Landlord in the 90s at the height of Blairism, people would say to him: “Why are you doing this mad patriot obsessed with the EU? That’s out of date.”\n\n“And I was like: ‘Are you mad? This is still there.’ The rise in our politics and discourse of the bloke who ‘tells it like it is’ has been amazing fuel.”\n\nIn the 2015 general election, as The Pub Landlord, Murray famously ran as a candidate in South Thanet against one such bloke, then-Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The Pub Landlord formed the Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP) and ran on a “common-sense” manifesto revealed on the back of a fag packet (“make more stuff, sell it for profit”, “build new houses for people who make stuff to live in”).\n\nHe won 318 votes, but it was pitch-perfect satire. On results night, he and Farage had a brief conversation. “He said” – he adopts a pretty good impression – “‘Have you won?’ I said, ‘That depends what you mean by winning, Nigel?’ ‘Yes, good point’.”\n\nMurray’s purpose was not to win – that was never a possibility – but to encourage people to take part in the democratic process: again, he wasn’t taking sides. His Twitter profile says he is a “culture war conchie” – a conscientious objector – which sums up his general attitude.\n\n“In the Second World War, The Royal Army Medical Corps was full of conscientious objectors who would get the wounded off the battlefield. So that’s how I see myself.” With his new series, there might be a few more casualties yet."
