        "text": "Addressing the issues of Brexit and the nuances of home nation relations through his tongue-in-cheek pub landlord persona aching with 'Britishness' and satire which entertained and enthralled an audience of all ages.\n\nFrom the four different types of Scottish men, the Geordie whale song to how the Liverpudlian accent served as the downfall for German radio communication in the second World War- few topics remained untouched by Murrary's razor sharp wit.\n\nFilled with audience participation, interaction and repartee, laughs echoed round Latitude's Comedy Arena as the 'Guv'nor' gave his patriotic, sometimes misinformed, views on topical issues.\n\nMurray's performance culminated with a sing-a-long rendition of the 'beautiful ancient song of our forefathers'- Itsy Bitsy Spider as a mass of audience limbs participated in the song's accompanying hand actions described by the landlord as 'the ancient ceremonial Haka we forgot'.\n\nPouring a pint and raising it to the crowd, Murray said 'It has been quite beautiful drinking with you thank you,' a sentiment greeted by applause from his patrons who clearly agreed."
