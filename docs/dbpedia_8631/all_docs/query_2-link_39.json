        "text": "I was sad to read in Esquire that Alec Baldwin may quit doing his Trump impression on Saturday Night Live. Not only is it really good, it is also really important. Satire is one of the checks and balances in a democracy and the more self-important and self-convinced a political leader becomes, the more they need to be satirised.\n\nAfter winning a battle, Roman Generals rode into Rome for a Triumph. It is said that they rode with a slave standing behind them whispering “you are only mortal!” to stop them thinking they had become gods. A modern day equivalent could be seen in Baldwin satirising Trump as he becomes the most powerful man on earth. Satire is the modern version of that Roman slave and today’s powerful leaders also need to be reminded that they are only human. The more they lose sight of that fact, the more important satire becomes. In Trump’s case, his attacks back at SNL suggests they are doing their job well."
