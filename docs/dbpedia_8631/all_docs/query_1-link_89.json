        "text": "Funnyman Al Murray has revealed Donald Trump has comedians across the world quaking in their boots.\n\nAl, aka the Pub Landlord, admits that while everyone else is fretting about the president’s racist remarks and extremist policies, comics are worrying about how they will be able to compete with his bizarre stand-up routines.\n\nThe 48-year-old dad of two is one of the stars of the Glasgow Live International Comedy Festival next month.\n\nHe said: “The trouble with Trump is that he is a better stand-up than most comedians so we are all going to have to try a lot harder to get bigger laughs than him.\n\n“I keep waiting for him to break character but it hasn’t happened yet.\n\n“He just comes out, creates as much mayhem as he can and then leaves. I suppose we can only be grateful that he hasn’t ended the world just yet.”\n\nAl, who will be performing his Let’s Go Backwards Together show in Glasgow, admits it’s a tough but interesting time to be a comedian.\n\nHe said: “In the last 12 months, so much has happened on the national and global stage. Everything we knew before has been blown out of the water.\n\n“You have to be on the ball and keep moving everything forward. From Trump to Brexit, there’s just so much to talk about.\n\n“We live in troubling times. Europe. The NHS. Whatever the hell is going on in the Middle East. The gathering storm of fortnightly bin collections? Who knows where it will all end?”\n\nIt can be tough to get the balance right when audiences are coming to gigs to escape the news.\n\nAl added: “My new show does tackle all the issues with lots of light-hearted relief thrown in for good measure. I’m looking forward to seeing what the audience makes of it, especially in Scotland.”\n\nIn 2014, Murray was one of 200 artists, authors, historians and musicians who penned an open letter to Scots asking them to stay in the Union before the vote on Scottish independence.\n\nHe took a lot of stick for it on social media.\n\nAl said: “I got trolled on Twitter with all sorts of people threatening to come to my Scottish gigs and punch me in the face.\n\n“It was a bit of a disappointment when it didn’t happen as it would have made my shows very interesting.”\n\nAlthough he admires Nicola Sturgeon, he wishes she would stop going on about a second independence referendum.\n\nHe said: “She’s like a broken record. Yes we get it love, you want another referendum.\n\n“I had a mate who loved Duran Duran and that’s all he would play in the car. I used to say, ‘Dave there are other bands.’\n\n“That’s what I would like to say to Nicola but I don’t think it would make any difference.\n\n“She’s like, ‘Yes Brexit, a trigger for another indy referendum,’ ‘It’s foggy today, another trigger,’ ‘Why it’s nice today, time for a new referendum.’ Any excuse. I admire her dogged determination but folk down this end of the country do find it funny.”\n\nAl’s alter ego The Pub Landlord had a foray into politics during the 2015 General Election when he stood against former Ukip leader Nigel Farage.\n\nOxford-educated Al said: “It was an eye opener. Most people took it in the spirit of jest it was intended and others were up in arms about it. You think clever people would suss out what I was doing.\n\n“I stood as my other half the Pub Landlord. Never in a million years would I go into politics as myself.\n\n“As the Pub Landlord people aren’t alarmed by my extremist views and expect them.\n\n“It’s like an armour that allows me to become a different person without me having to bare my soul and give my own opinions.\n\n“Doing stand-up is my way of talking about life’s biggest stories without having to give too much of myself away.”\n\nBorn and brought up in Buckinghamshire, Al is as English as pint of bitter but his alter ego is a Scot.\n\nHe said: “The Pub Landlord was born in Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Harry Hill and I were doing a show in 1994.\n\n“On opening night with minutes to spare, I came up with the idea that the compere hadn’t turned up but the guy who works in the bar would go on to fill the gap.\n\n“In 1996, I came back with a full hour of material and haven’t looked back since.”\n\nHe’d love to share a stage with the Big Yin.\n\nAl said: “My perfect gig would involve sharing a pint of Tennent’s with Billy Connolly in Glasgow or Edinburgh. He is the king, the godfather of stand-up. No one has ever come close. It’s thanks to him we have alternative comedy.\n\n“Scotland will always hold a special place in my heart. It’s where I cut my teeth and got my s*** together as a comedian.”\n\n● The Pub Landlord: Let’s Go Backwards Together is at Glasgow’s King Theatre on Saturday, March 25 at 7.30pm.
