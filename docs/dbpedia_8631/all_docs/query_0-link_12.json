        "text": "Al Murray is not a pub landlord. He does not run a pub, he is not a leering, xenophobe fantasist-fabulist with a sketchy grasp of facts. He is a 48-year-old, very successful comedian who routinely uses a knitted tea cosy and lives in a huge house in Chiswick with his two teenage daughters, a whirring wine fridge, some ancestral portraits (William Makepeace Thackeray was his great-great-great-grandfather) and a collection of Action Man-style dolls of historical figures like Saddam Hussein and Winston Churchill. And yet there are ways in which the real world and the character Murray created 22 years ago do intersect. When on stage, Murray inhabits the persona of the (nameless) landlord with such ease that audience members do seem to sometimes get confused between fiction and reality; and then, last year, the landlord burst through the fourth wall and stood against Nigel Farage in the by-election for South Thanet, representing the Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP). He lost, getting only 318 votes, but some of his electoral pledges seem scarily prescient, like that on immigration:\n\n'Of course, the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. Look no further. However, in the meantime we brick up the Channel Tunnel. With British bricks. Probably have to get some Poles in to do it. Common sense.'\n\nBecause the clever thing about the Pub Landlord is how he converges with the current reality. The Landlord's latest show is called 'Let's Go Backwards Together'. It examines our 'post-fact', post-referendum world and has been acclaimed by some critics as perhaps the Landlord's finest incarnation yet. And apparently, the Landlord would be 'amazed and delighted' to be talked about in Tatler. 'He would have heard of it,' says Murray.\n\n'He'll have a notion that it exists. It would make him bow, scrape and cringe. And flick Vs, all at once. I mean traditional British Vs. He wouldn't be giving anyone the middle finger. He's a traditionalist. They might respect that.'\n\nThat Al Murray himself should actually appear in Tatler is less of a surprise. Look him up and you will see that he has some very grand ancestors - in addition to Thackeray on his maternal side, there is the 3rd Duke of Atholl, who was his father's great-great- great-grandfather; there is also a bishop, an ambassador and a lady called Baroness Strange floating around his family tree. All of which, combined with Bedford School (where he was briefly head boy) and Oxford University have led to questions as to whether a posh boy could really ever know what it is like to be in the head of a salt-of-the-earth pub landlord. Murray says he doesn't get pissed off when people call him posh. 'I think that what some people don't realise is that there are gradations of posh. I have cousins who went to Eton. I think [people who went to] Eton, Harrow, they're properly posh. But my Dad worked for British Rail for 40 years, my mother worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau in Milton Keynes. We're resolutely downwardly mobile. With showbusiness, you can be as posh as you like, but if you're not delivering, then you won't get on. So I don't get annoyed, I'm just exasperated that\n\nit's supposed to say anything about me at all. I went to private school because my grandfather left some money for a grandson. I do accept that I am from a privileged background. I was lucky I went to private school. I know all those things. But I don't think they explain anything about me at all. There's an interesting idea about art right now - \"you're not allowed to imagine\" seems to be the argument. So I'm not allowed to imagine what people might think, or send up how other people might think. That's an argument against art. That's an argument against creativity.'\n\nWhat Al Murray does with his comedy is to imagine what it is like to be a bigot. 'The interesting thing about bigotry is that you have to imagine stuff about people. It's a hallucinative state to imagine that groups of people act in a certain way. Because of course they don't. A bigot imagines reasons why the world is like it is, rather than actually bothering to figure it out.'\n\nAl Murray is most definitely not a bigot - he is learned and articulate, with wide-ranging interests. He did a degree in modern history, has made a television series about the Second World War and a documentary about Germany, and has given a TEDx talk about the political process, as well as publishing a memoir, Watching War Films With My Dad. He is obsessed with the war, and interested in dissecting the way we have turned something horrific into something heroic to be celebrated by little boys and their dads. He recognises that his own fascination with war is connected to a nostalgia for his childhood, when it seemed like a far less complex subject.\n\n'I grew up in the pomp of Airfix models, Action Man figures, British\n\nwar films on the telly - The Great Escape, A Bridge Too Far, The Eagle Has Landed... all that. My father was a TA soldier. He used to parachute, I remember going to see him when I was little. So I grew up with that British expression of post-war culture, which was to give us toy soldiers and toy Spitfires. The way the UK processed the war was obviously part and parcel of the imperial downsizing that we underwent at the same time.'\n\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, his house is full of military memorabilia - toy tanks,\n\na pint-sized Viscount Montgomery of Alamein on a black charger. Most notably, there is 'The Brown Suite', otherwise known as the downstairs loo, replete with military gear.\n\n'I'm fascinated by it. I mean, every so often I think: \"I've got to read about something else. For Christ's sake!\" I have a lot of [war] books. I've also got lots of books about other things. But it's culturally magnetic. Certainly for my generation. Hopefully, it's passing. Because we need to let go of its grip on our culture.'\n\nAl Murray and his father created an enclave of war-film-watching masculinity in what was essentially a feminine home; in addition to his two sisters and his mother, there were lots of great-aunts. 'My mother's father died at Dunkirk, so his three sisters were very involved in her upbringing.' One of them still had Thackeray's sofa and various other items of Thackerayana. Murray has some first editions, an inkwell and a portrait, but he is not a man for ancestor worship. 'It was a bit like the elephant in the room, all the Thackeray stuff on that side of the family. I have half a dozen Thackeray nuggets and then I run out.'\n\nAt home, Murray was an extrovert, putting on joke shows with his cousin John, but at school he was less confident, loathing boarding school - which he started aged nine - for the first few years. 'I was a very self-conscious kid. At every assembly someone would have to hand in the register in front of 600 children. And I remember doing it once, but getting up at the wrong moment, feeling like everyone was looking at me. And the thing is, if you think about it, if you are aware that everyone is watching you, then you might as well treat it as a performance. So you take your self-consciousness and turn it around. You think, \"All right, I'll act this moment. I will decide how to walk up and how to walk back.\" You can flip it over.'\n\nAs a boy, Al Murray wanted to act, partly as a result of an excellent drama teacher, partly because of his acute self-consciousness and his desire to challenge this. He acted at school, but once he started university (after a year out spent sweeping floors in factories in Milton Keynes and playing drums in a band), he decided that his ego couldn't really take being rejected or directed by his peers. 'I knew that going for an audition with a director who was basically my contemporary would be just too difficult to deal with as a performing ego.'\n\nFortunately for the nascent theatre directors of Oxford, on Al Murray's first day at\n\nSt Edmund Hall he went to the music room to find a drum kit and instead found Stewart\n\nLee and Richard Herring, both in the year above, and both involved in the student comedy scene, of which Armando Iannucci was the star at the time. Murray set up his own sketch group. 'We had a sketch about Wilfred Owen, the war poet. There's a war-poet battalion and he's called in by his tutor and told his poems aren't good enough. It was like, \"What's this shit?! You can do better than this.\"'\n\nOne of the things that appealed to Murray about stand-up comedy was that it challenged his inner conformist. 'At school, I very much tried to behave, to conform, to get it right. It was my instinct. It was how I felt about things. So I didn't have as much fun as I could have had. And I still have that - it's a very strong urge in me, to behave. And I think that's why I've ended up doing what I'm doing. When I figured out that that was part of my nature, I realised I had to do something about it. Articulating it makes it sound more pathological than it is. It's not quite that - it's just that thing of pushing yourself, being a comic and also doing an act that is open to misinterpretation, that has mischief built into it. Comics need to be mischievous. They are supposed to want to break things. It's not in my nature, but it is good for me. Because [that conforming side] is still at least half of my personality.'\n\nThe Pub Landlord came into being in 1994 at the Edinburgh Festival. Murray was doing a show with Harry Hill, and when they realised that they didn't have a comp√®re, 'I said, \"Why don't we say the barman's filling in?\" and he said, \"Yeah, all right, whatever.\" We did a run in Edinburgh and then we went on tour, and by the end of the tour I had an act. Just like that.' It is an act that has spawned DVDs, books and TV shows, as well as gruelling tours that take Murray all around the country for months. He seems a little beleaguered by his self-imposed schedule. His daughters, from his second marriage (there have been two divorces) are now 13 and 17. 'I want them to be lawyers or accountants or something sensible where someone else pays their tax for them and they know that they're going to work at nine o'clock on Monday morning. Because there are times when I wish work was normal. The problem with talking about\n\nthis is that you end up sounding like you are complaining. I have an amazing job, it's so much fun, and I'm doing what I want to do, but there is something crap about being away a lot.' He is friends with other comics and chefs who have a similarly antisocial schedule, and Monday tends to be their party day.\n\nBut Murray does enjoy the fruits of two decades as a headline comedian. He loves to eat out at smart restaurants like J Sheekey. 'Mark Sargeant is a pal of mine - I went to Claridge's a lot when he ran the restaurant there because I could sit at the chef's table and he'd bring me nice things.' His other extravagance is his drum kit, a prototype made by a master drum-maker. So obsessed is he that he has set up a drum-manufacturing company, the British Drum Company.\n\nHe is also connected with a number of charities, including Grief Encounter, which helps young people deal with the death of someone close to them. Supporting more than 3,000 people annually, they offer one-on-one counselling, residential camps and family fun days. Murray is an ambassador for the charity. 'I have had no proper experience of grief,\n\nbut I have children and I can imagine, and my kids have been through a divorce and that was hard enough.'\n\nIn the future, he would like to do some more acting, particularly Shakespeare - 'It would be interesting not to have to come up with the words' - and he is also considering developing another act: 'Something as me, about history, maybe, or politics.' Perhaps next time he could enter a by-election as himself, conquer his inner conformist, really shake things up...\n\nFor more information about Grief Encounter, visit griefencounter.org.uk"
