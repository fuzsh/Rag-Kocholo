        "text": "By James Colville\n\nIn a typically British tradition of mixing politics and comedy, the award winning comedian Al Murray will be standing for election in the constituency of South Thanet this May. One can only assume that by campaigning under the guise of his über-nationalist, xenophobic and bigoted alter-ego The Pub Landlord, the highly intelligent Murray is attempting to hold a satirical mirror towards the other joker standing for South Thanet, Nigel Farage.\n\nWith policies that include “bricking up the channel tunnel with British bricks” (although possibly having to get some Poles in to carry out the actual labour), Murray’s Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP) appears to have an even tougher stance on immigration than UKIP. But what about more local issues? What will life in Durham be like with the Guv’nor at the helm of British Gov’norment?\n\nIn honouring a key pledge, the price of a pint will be slashed to one penny, so the cost of your Friday night out will depend largely on what size pizza you pick up on the way back, and the brand of cigarettes you choose to smoke in line with the “smoking in pubs to be made compulsory” policy. In any case you will have a lot more money in your pocket as the pound will have been revalued at £1.10. You won’t have to worry too much about the queue at the bar, as most of Durham’s population will either be locked up on the charge of being unemployed, interred at a footballing concentration camp in an attempt to win the next world cup, or be forced to carry out National Service on the basis that they didn’t want to do it in the first place.\n\nIt’s all a bit of a laugh of course, an unwritten but time honoured British tradition stating that any constituency election must contain at least one novelty act from, as described in Blackadder, the “Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party”. As is always the case with the Monster Raving Looney Party or the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (whatever happened to them?), I’m sure the Publican will score a few crosses next to his name from the odd nutter who genuinely believes that a good example of foreign policy is “fight Germany if they’re up for it”. I’m not so sure, however, he’s going to steal any votes from under the nose of “Mr Farridge”.\n\nThe problem with Al Murray’s little joke is that it’s unclear who or what is at the butt end of it. If it’s the character himself then the whole FUKP campaign is just a clever marketing strategy to sell DVD’s and pack out arenas. If it’s British politics then the joke is old and tired and if it’s Ol’ Nige himself, then it’s just not that funny. UKIP has grown in support rapidly over the last few years and in South Thanet in particular, an area steeped in economic difficulties, the chances of securing a seat for the hard-right is a very real one. Waving a pint around, dreaming up some farcical policies involving Spitfires and then believing you are somehow ridiculing a legitimate political party isn’t just naïve, it’s highly risky.\n\nIf Al Murray gets a considerable number of votes then it’s going to be protest votes from people who are disillusioned with the three main parties but tolerant, open-minded and informed enough not to vote for the hard-right. Tempting though it is to assume, UKIP supporters are not all racist homophobes and they are certainly not all idiots. I cannot see how many will swayed by some light hearted lampooning. Many hardworking people are genuinely afraid of the disadvantages unchecked immigration is perceived to bring; such as wage compression, overcrowded schools and a shortage of social housing. The key word in that last sentence is perceived. The truth is irrelevant, people still feel they are either ignored by the Conservatives, overlooked by the Lib Dems or misrepresented by Labour.\n\nAl Murray is an Oxbridge and public school educated individual of aristocratic descent; very far removed from the comic persona he portrays but not all that distant from a disproportionate number of successfully elected Parliamentary representatives. South Thanet doesn’t need a comically confusing novelty candidate to split the vote any more than it already is. If Mr Murray was serious about leading the country away from the perils of a hard-right government, maybe instead of placing The Pub Landlord in the voting line he should stand proud as himself – Alastair James Hay Murray.\n\nPhotograph: Wikimedia Commons"
