        "text": "Science fiction is the most visible and influential contemporary form of futurist imagination and thinking in the modern world. Science fiction is so popular because, in narrative form, it speaks to the whole person—intellect, imagination, emotion, and the senses; the cosmic, social, and personal; the natural and technological; the secular and the spiritual; and human values and modes of behavior—stimulating and enhancing holistic future consciousness. (See my articles on “future consciousness” for an explanation of this concept.) Indeed, science fiction, for many people in contemporary times, has become a total way of life—a way of experiencing reality and the future.\n\nAlthough we may associate the concept of myth with ideas derivative from the past, or stories of fantasy rather than truth, I propose that science fiction is the “evolutionary mythology of the future,” providing ever-evolving dramatic narratives that inform us and both frighten and inspire us about the future. Science fiction, similar to the great myths of the past, provides imaginatively rich scenarios and stories that excite, educate, empower, and enlighten us. Yet science fiction provides plausible and credible new mythic narratives that are resonant with contemporary thought and issues of modern life.\n\nScience fiction, indeed, is not an escape from reality, but following Arthur C. Clarke, it is the most penetrating form of inquiry and exploration into reality. Science fiction expands and deepens our understanding of how humanity fits into the vast cosmic reaches of space and time; it illuminates the present as well as the future. Further, science fiction is not just about the future of science and technology; it is about the future of everything—it is about the possibility space of existence.\n\nThe science fiction novel, in particular, draws the reader into a full-blown adventure of the imagination and the intellect, creating a rich, in-depth, and enthralling experience that both transcends and illuminates our everyday world. We journey to a different land, a different reality, and are able to realize a broadening of our perspective on the cosmos and humankind.\n\nThe following ranked list is my considered judgment of the best science fiction novels of all time. On the top of the list is Olaf Stapledon’s Star Maker, his cosmic and philosophical epoch that extends billions of years into the future, and then, in its mystical conclusion, transcends the life of our universe. Second on the list is Dan Simmons’ Hyperion, the great literary, mythic, archetypal, and poetic masterpiece of contemporary science fiction. Such novels, and many others that follow on this list, have unequivocally and deeply expanded my consciousness of reality—past, present, and future.\n\nMy criteria for determining this ranking include:\n\nScope and originality of imagination (creativity)\n\nLiterary quality\n\nReader engagement – Joy/pleasure in reading\n\nQuality of plot\n\nCoherence and orchestration of ideas/events\n\nUniqueness\n\nScientific/technological/philosophical intelligence\n\nEmotional and personal impact\n\nRichness of scenarios and characters\n\nMemorability\n\nIneffable beyond-ness (the fudge factor)\n\nThe list is continually evolving; in fact, it has been updated numerous times over the last dozen or so years. Although I have been reading science fiction for over fifty years, I know that there are still many important science fiction novels that I have not yet read, as well as an ongoing flow of new novels being published every year. My intent is that I will continue to read more older classics, as well as new noteworthy novels that come out in the future. The list will keep growing and probably re-arranging itself.\n\nFor a complete ranked list of classics, based on number of awards and nominations for awards, see Worlds Without End. As I have read most of the novels on this list, my own ranking below is based on a fairly comprehensive reading of science fiction literature. However, in my view, the WWE list is skewed toward the middle-range past, with more recent novels and very early classics either too low or missing in the ranking. Conversely, other lists I’ve encountered on other websites, in my opinion, are too skewed relative to the present, with classic science fiction ranked too low or ignored. Hopefully, in my list I have achieved a balance of the old, the middle-aged, and the new.\n\nAside from a balance of older classics with contemporary works, there is also a balance within my list of techie (hard) science fiction and humanistic and personal tales. There are space operas and dystopias; adventures, satires, allegories, comedies, and tragedies; human stories and alien stories; alternate histories and alternate universes; love stories, horror stories, and stories of madness. And there are tales that fold time and/or journey to the beginning and/or the end of time. To get a sense of outstanding works within each of the diverse array of themes and territories covered in science fiction, I recommend the website The Best Sci-Fi Book Lists in which the best science fiction novels are listed by sub-genre.\n\nSee my essays on “science fiction as the mythology of the future” and “science fiction as the evolutionary mythology of the future“ , which examine many of the novels and authors on my evolving list. The essays provide historical sketches of the evolution of science fiction from its beginnings in classical myth through the Golden and Silver Ages, the New Wave, Cyberpunk, and the great contemporary efflorescence of humanistic and cosmic science fiction. In these essays I look at both science fiction literature and science fiction film (See my best science fiction movies), and I consider how science fiction has both influenced and been influenced by the evolution of modern society over the last two centuries.\n\nThe essays are also in evolution; I have expanded the content of the essays into a full length college course, a weekend workshop, and an extensive webinar series. A brief introductory three part video is available: Science Fiction: The Mythology of the Future. The webinar series (covering over 60 hours of recorded videos) is available for viewing at: The Evolution of Science Fiction Webinar Series.\n\nThe most detailed and comprehensive discussion of science fiction novels that I have created covering ancient times up through Olaf Stapledon’s novels can be found in the three volumes of my book series Science Fiction: The Evolutionary Mythology of the Future. See thebook page on this website for descriptions of these books, as well as links for purchasing the books.\n\nThis list was last updated in June 9, 2024."
