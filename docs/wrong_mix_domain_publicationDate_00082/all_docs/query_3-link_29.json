I sat down with Phil LaMarche, a SUNY Canton professor and published author, to discuss dystopian and apocalyptic societies in literature for a lively conversation about books, recommendations and reality.\n\nWe heard from some young readers at Canton Central School, and Peggy Kerfien, the Director of the Ogdensburg Free Library in Ogdensburg, NY. So many people emailed recommendations, and we had some great suggestions on the phone, too.\n\nThe next episode of North Country Bookmarks will be Friday, February 7 at noon, and I’ll be joined by Meg McGovern, a former English Teacher from Canton Central School, where we will discuss what we read growing up, and how it still resonates. As always, feel free to email your submissions in advance to me (jessica@ncpr.org). Thank you for listening!\n\nJessica LawrenceDystopian and apocalyptic worlds edition\n\nRecommended Books\n\nHost Jessica Lawrence\n\nThe Power, Naomi Alderman. Alderman was mentored by famed author Margaret Atwood, and in this novel, instead of men having the power, it is women who do. Women develop the ability to send jolts from their fingers, which in turns make them extremely powerful- and the dominant gender. The novel follows several characters, many female, who ultimately become high ranking in society across the world. The shift is dynamic, the story is captivating, and it really does showcase how things would be vastly different in this alternate reality.\n\nThe Water Cure, Sophie Mackintosh. This post-apocalyptic story follows three sisters and their parents who reside on a tiny island after a catastrophe turns the main land into a toxic place. The girls are lead to believe that emotions are toxic and they shouldn’t have them. They are only save with each other. After their father (known as “King”) goes missing, three men are found on the shore of their island. The feelings they go through, as well as the rituals to keep themselves “pure” are shocking. It was one that stuck with me after closing the book.\n\nPhil LaMarche, SUNY Canton\n\nThe Handmaids Tale, Margaret Atwood\n\nThe Testaments, Margaret Atwood\n\nThe Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, David Troyer\n\nThe Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History, Elizabeth Kolbert\n\nA listener in Norfolk, NY\n\nThe Greatest Man in the World, James Thurber\n\nMitch Edelstein, Raquette Lake, via email\n\nAlas, Babylon, Pat Frank\n\nLucifers Hammer, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz, Walter Miller Jr.\n\nOne Second After, William Forstchen\n\nHeather Shively, Canton, NY via email\n\nWheel of Time, Robert Jordan\n\nSelection, Kiera Cass\n\nMary Thill, Keene, NY via email\n\nThe End of the Dream, Phillip Wylie\n\nJudy Ross, via email\n\nBroken Earth(series), N.K.
