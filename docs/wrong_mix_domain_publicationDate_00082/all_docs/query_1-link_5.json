        "text": "I’m fascinated by how books get remembered. Most writers hope their books will be good enough to pass through a series of milestones:\n\nGood enough to sell to a publisher\n\nGood enough to get printed and widely distributed\n\nGood enough to get positive reviews\n\nGood enough to become best sellers\n\nGood enough to be remembered on best of the year lists\n\nGood enough to win awards\n\nGood enough to stay in print\n\nGood enough to get on fan polls of all time favorite books\n\nGood enough to be recognized as a classic\n\nMost novels that are written are never published. Of those published, only a tiny percent, sell enough to earn royalties over the author’s advance, or get reprinted. And then even a smaller number to go on to become even moderately successful. The odds of writing a best seller is like those of winning a million dollar lottery. Writing a classic is like the odds of winning one of those hundred million dollar lotto games. Millions of books get published ever year, but few are remembered.\n\nEventually, most all books will be forgotten. How many 19th century novels can you list from memory in ten minutes? Every book has a lifetime, and I find it fascinating to think about why a book is remembered, and then why it is forgotten. And it’s particularly interesting to think about the history of science fiction stories and novels, because they present ideas about the future that all too often become dated.\n\nI thought it would be enlightening to see if I can find a series of fan polls that asked readers to vote for their favorite SF books, and see how those popular books change over time. To save myself a lot of typing, I’m just going to use the Top Ten books from each list.\n\nFor the first five lists I’m grateful to The SF Book of Lists by Maxim Jakubowski and Malcolm Edwards. I wish someone would update this wonderful 1983 book. I will use bullets when there are ties – but I will type them in the order listed. Votes, if available with be in parenthesis. Ties might bring the list to more than 10.\n\n1949 – August Derleth polled twelve writers, editors and critics\n\nSeven Famous Novels – H. G. Wells (9)\n\nBrave New World – Aldous Huxley (7)\n\nLast and First Men – Olaf Stapledon (7)\n\nAdventures in Time and Space – Healy and McComas (6)\n\nSlan – A. E. Van Vogt (6)\n\nShort Stories of H. G. Wells – H. G. Wells (6)\n\nStrange Ports of Call – August Derleth (5)\n\nThe World Below – S. Fowler Wright (5)\n\nThe Lost World – A. Conan Doyle (4)\n\nTo Walk the Night – William F. Sloane (4)\n\nSirius – Olaf Stapledon (4)\n\nGladiator – Philip Wylie (4)\n\n1952 – Reader Survey Astounding Science Fiction\n\nAdventures in Space and Time – Healy and McComas editors\n\nSlan – A. E. Van Vogt\n\nSeven Famous Novels – H. G. Wells\n\nThe Man Who Sold the Moon – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nWho Goes There? – John W. Campbell\n\nThe Best of Science Fiction – Groff Conklin editor\n\nThe Martian Chronicles – Ray Bradbury\n\nThe Green Hills of Earth – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nThe Science Fiction Omnibus – Bleiler and Dikty editors\n\nThe Illustrated Man – Ray Bradbury\n\nAlready we see a number of books and authors drop from the list. Science fiction was seldom published in book form before the 1950s, and in the early 1950s, most science fiction, much of what we considered classics of the era were published by small specialty publishers. It’s also interesting that by 1952 Heinlein and Bradbury have emerged as favorite writers.\n\n1956 – Reader Survey Astounding Science Fiction\n\nAdventures in Space and Time – Healy and McComas editors (51)\n\nCity – Clifford Simak (50)\n\nThe Martian Chronicles – Ray Bradbury (48)\n\nMore than Human – Theodore Sturgeon (48)\n\nSlan – A. E. Van Vogt (44)\n\nThe Man Who Sold the Moon – Robert A. Heinlein (40)\n\nThe Demolished Man – Alfred Bester (39)\n\nAstounding Science Fiction Anthology – John W. Campbell editor (37)\n\nChildhood’s End – Arthur C. Clarke (35)\n\n1984 – George Orwell (35)\n\nThe World of Null A – A. E. Van Vogt (35)\n\nSome of the books from the 1952 list stayed on the 1956 list, but fell lower, like Who Goes There? and The Green Hills of Earth. It’s interesting that Slan and Adventures in Time and Space are on all three lists. So did Seven Famous Novels, but it fell out of the top ten.\n\n1966 – Reader Survey Analog Science Fiction & Fact\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov (67.4%)\n\nSeven Famous Novels – H. G. Wells (59.4%)\n\nSlan – A. E. Van Vogt (50.5%)\n\nThe Rest of the Robots – Isaac Asimov (45.7%)\n\nThe Demolished Man – Alfred Bester (44.2%)\n\nChildhood’s End – Arthur C. Clarke (42.2%)\n\nThe City and the Stars – Arthur C. Clarke (40.6%)\n\nThe Martian Chronicles – Ray Bradbury (38.9%)\n\nCity – Clifford Simak (38.6%)\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz – Walter M. Miller, Jr. (38.1%)\n\nSlan is hanging in there. It’s hard to compare overlap because new books are coming out after each list. So where’s Heinlein? If he was the most popular writer of the times why isn’t he on the list. He had five books lower down on this list. Heinlein always competed with himself in these polls, so often his books didn’t make it to the top of the list. This 1966 list was the first that covers times I remember, and I probably read it in the magazine when it came out. These are the great books of my childhood.\n\n1975 – Locus Poll – full list here\n\nDune – Frank Herbert (104)\n\nChildhood’s End – Arthur C. Clarke (97)\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness – Ursula K. Le Guin (90)\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein (63)\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz – Walter M. Miller, Jr. (57)\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov (53)\n\nThe Stars My Destination – Alfred Bester (50)\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress – Robert A. Heinlein (41)\n\nMore Than Human – Theodore Sturgeon (40)\n\nLord of Light – Roger Zelazny (35)\n\nAlready it’s possible to see how time affects the memory of books. Newer books push out older books. By 1975 Slan falls from memory after being so well remembered. 1976 also marks the first time a woman writer shows up, at all, not just for the top of the list. 1975 also represents an interesting switch. Fans did pick The Demolished Man by Bester, but from now on they pick The Stars My Destination.\n\n1987 – Locus Poll Best All-Time Novel – full list here\n\nDune – Frank Herbert\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness – Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nChildhood’s End – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz – Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n\nGateway – Frederik Pohl\n\nRingworld – Larry Niven\n\nThe Stars My Destination – Alfred Bester\n\nIt seems Dune is becoming the Citizen Kane of the science fiction book world.\n\n1998 – Locus Best SF Novels of All-Time (before 1990) – full list here\n\nDune – Frank Herbert\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness – Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nThe Stars My Destination – Alfred Bester\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz – Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n\nChildhood’s End – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nEnder’s Game – Orson Scott Card\n\nHyperion – Dan Simmons\n\nEach list is now switching out a couple of new titles but is pretty much keeping the usual suspects.\n\n2011 – NPR Top 100 Science Fiction/Fantasy Books – full list here\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams\n\nEnder’s Game – Orson Scott Card\n\nThe Dune Chronicles – Frank Herbert\n\n1984 – George Orwell\n\nFahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov\n\nBrave New World – Aldous Huxley\n\nNeuromancer – William Gibson\n\nI, Robot – Isaac Asimov\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nI filtered out the fantasy novels. For example, The Lord of the Rings came in number one. More than 5,000 books were nominated, and over 60,000 people voted. This is a huge poll. Many of the novels from the earlier lists are on it. It’s a poll from outside of the genre, yet it remains consistent.\n\n2012 – Locus All-Time Novel Results – see full list\n\nDune – Frank Herbert (256)\n\nEnder’s Game – Orson Scott Card (154)\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov (143)\n\nHyperion – Dan Simmons (131)\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness – Ursula K. Le Guin (120)\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams (113)\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four – George Orwell (105)\n\nNeuromancer – William Gibson (100)\n\nThe Stars My Destination – Alfred Bester (91)\n\nFahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury (91)\n\n2014 – Worlds Without End – Most Read – see full list\n\nEnder’s Game – Orson Scott Card\n\nDune – Frank Herbert\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams\n\nNeuromancer – William Gibson\n\nThe Forever War – Joe Haldeman\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four – George Orwell\n\nRendezvous with Rama – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nFahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – Philip K. Dick\n\nAgain, I filtered out the fantasy. This was not a poll, but the books that were most read in the WWEnd database. It’s interesting to see how commonly read books are consistent with books showing up on the fan polls.\n\n2014 – Sci-Fi Lists Top 100 Sci-Fi Books – see full list\n\nDune – Frank Herbert\n\nEnder’s Game – Orson Scott Card\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy – Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four – George Orwell\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nFahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury\n\nNeuromancer – William Gibson\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – Philip K. Dick\n\nSci-Fi Lists is an online poll that is constantly updated. These two lists overlap almost perfectly, with 8 books on both lists, and they share 6 books with the 2012 poll, and 7 with the 2011 poll. Also, all of these books are fairly old, at least 30 years. It finally seems certain long term favorites are emerging.\n\nWhat’s sad is only one woman writer appears on all these lists, and for the same book, The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin. Read the wonderful blog Mistressworks, or Ian Sales compilation list to see what these fans are missing. Now, some of these books by women are making the polls and lists, but lower down from the top ten.\n\nIf you look at cross tabulated lists like Worlds Without End and The Classics of Science Fiction, you’ll see more women on the complete lists, but it’s so disappointing not to see more. I think if SF fans would read more books like those reviewed on the Mistressworks site this would change.\n\nThere are dozens, if not hundreds of all-time great science fiction book lists, but they are often compiled by one person, or a group of editors. I’ve picked popular polls that had the goal of finding the best all-time favorite SF books, and not just current ones. I’ve also ignored some British lists because they only confuse the issue at hand.\n\nEven though we’re seeing a good deal of consistent favorites in recent years, I believe if we could jump ahead 25 years, many of those books will be forgotten. Dune really is entrenched, and I think we’ll see it in 25 years. But I don’t know about Stranger in a Strange Land, that’s from the same era as Dune. I doubt Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? would be remembered at all if it wasn’t for Blade Runner. One good movie adaptation and a book’s memory is boosted for decades. I’ve recently reread Nineteen Eighty-Four and it is a true masterpiece.\n\nThere are lots of sentimental favorites from my childhood that I wish would make a comeback, like City by Clifford Simak, and my all-time favorite science fiction novel, Have Space Suit-Will Travel by Robert A. Heinlein never makes these lists at all. I guess some books die when all their fans die."
