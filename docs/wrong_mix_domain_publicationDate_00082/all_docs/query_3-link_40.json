        "text": "I’ve been working through a list of SciFi/Fantasy books, which is a merging of three “top 50” lists that I’ve found over the years. I just finished reading Hothouse, by Brian Aldiss.\n\nIt was … weird, and ok. I guess I can see how some people would enjoy it. It follows the travels of group of primitive people around a post-civilization world where vegetation is the dominant life form.\n\nI found it unsatisfying. Not much happens, and the people in the story are largely uninteresting, or, at least, Aldiss doesn’t tell us very much about them. So it’s more of a travelogue than a novel.\n\nAnyways, on to the next book. I’ve included the list below, if you want to follow along. Stared books are those that I’ve already read – many of them before I encountered the list. I’m only on #3 of the ones that I hadn’t read yet when i started. Give me a few more years …"
