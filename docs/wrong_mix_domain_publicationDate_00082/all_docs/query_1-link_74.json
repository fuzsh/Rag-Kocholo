        "text": "My science fiction romantic comedy novella Time Signature debuts tomorrow, May 10, available wherever fine ebooks are sold. In honor of the occasion, I’m going to say a few words about one of the interesting aspects of writing this piece—the challenge of building a story in a world someone else has created.\n\nOrigin Story\n\nThe Wild Rose Press likes to develop series of books based on a common setting or theme. The common element is announced, and authors are invited to submit stories to fit. The stories may be of different kinds: contemporary romance, historical romance, romantic suspense, paranormal romance, and so forth. But the common thread ties them together.\n\nA couple of years ago, TWRP announced the Deerbourne Inn series. The creators placed a charming old inn in a small town in Vermont. They described the layout of the inn and the town, the surrounding landscape, a set of inhabitants, noteworthy events, and the like. Then they turned the writers loose. At this point, I count no fewer than twenty-six books set in the Deerbourne Inn locale. This small town, in other words, is crawling with lovers seeking their happy endings.\n\nIn a Wild Rose chat, I asked whether, among all these varieties, a science fiction (rather than fantasy) story might also fit. Sure, why not, was the response. And, having raised the question, I thought of an angle: a chance to play around with the classic time travel romance tropes and, perhaps, turn them around in unexpected ways. I ran the concept by Nikki Andrews, who was at that time my TWRP editor. She thought it might be fun. And thus Time Signature was born.\n\nThe Shared World\n\nThe idea of a shared world has a long history, especially in science fiction. Back in the 1980s, Harlan Ellison recruited a band of noted SF writers to place stories in a setting referred to as “Harlan’s World.” Later in the ’80s, Jerry Pournelle opened up a planet in his CoDominium future history to other authors under the series title “War World.” Larry Niven, a frequent collaborator with Pournelle, performed a similar evolution based on an event in his Known Space future history, the “Man-Kzin Wars.” More recently, Eric Flint’s 2000 novel 1632 has spawned an extensive cottage industry of alternate-history stories in the “Ring of Fire series.”\n\nA storyline inhabited by different authors can also develop almost accidentally. I’ve remarked on the roles of different writers in stories about the “Fuzzies” created by H. Beam Piper. A set of follow-up books to James Schmitz’s classic The Witches of Karres brought three additional authors into play.\n\nThe advantage of spreading out the efforts of exotic worldbuilding make science fiction a natural venue for shared worlds. But even in more mundane settings, there are advantages to be gained. A standalone non-fantastic contemporary novel must still stand up a set of characters, places, companies, and the like to populate the story. A writer who’s invented such a panoply of features for a set of tales (like Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County) has to put a lot of work into developing these details. Bringing in a whole corps of authors to help in that enterprise can create a richness of detail that would be hard for a single writer to achieve. (We can’t all be J.R.R. Tolkien.)\n\nThus, before I put electrons to screen in Time Signature, I already had a range of details to draw upon. The inn and its staff were “already there.” If my characters wanted to have dinner at a restaurant in town, I had a selection of eateries available. More important, my main character Trina Kellander, a musician, could perform in town at the “Mad River Garden Party,” a summertime event already defined in the Deerbourne Inn corpus.\n\nThe Joys and Tribulations of Consistency\n\nThe flip side of these advantages is the need for consistency. Nothing throws a reader out of a story faster than some blatant discrepancy in the details. If it takes 39 minutes to get from Willow Springs to Montpelier, it’s unlikely the return trip will take three hours—barring traffic jams, severe weather, or the like. (And if Trina makes the trip in fair weather, we can’t have another character suffering a torrential downpour in the same location at the same time.)\n\nAchieving the consistency needed for a successful suspension of disbelief is hard enough for one author. For a whole herd of authors, it’s a major issue. How do we maintain the coherence that makes the shared world seem real?\n\nBeth Overmyer’s recent guest post on writing a series mentioned the notion of a “bible”—reference notes that record details, from a character’s appearance to the theory of magic. The bible is essential to a shared universe. It’s the only way writers can stay consistent on key details without bogging down in endless inter-author consultations.\n\nThe Deerbourne Inn bible establishes the location of the fictional town of Willow Springs (which actually coincides with a real small town on the Vermont map—allowing me to use Google Maps to determine the travel time to Montpelier). It lays out the structure of the inn, its history, the owner and staff, a bevy of secondary characters at the inn and in the town, the shops and facilities in Willow Springs (right down to the high school mascot), and special events. Characters introduced in the individual stories, up to the last update to the bible, are also listed. The bible is accompanied by a street map of the town, making it easier to visualize geographical relationships. (We’ve not yet progressed to the level of having a GIS layer for an electronic map. But that innovation’s probably not too far away.)\n\nHowever, it’s impractical to include all possible details in the bible—especially when 26 different books are involved. This makes it harder to be sure whether a given fact has been established somewhere, or whether one is free to invent it. My ebook copies of the Deerbourne Inn stories I read while writing TS are festooned with blue highlights to indicate facts that I might have to take into account at some point. And still it’s not easy to tell.\n\nCase in point: My characters take a hike up into the nearby hills, and stop to look back down at the inn. What color is the façade? I couldn’t find a reference on that particular point. If I were writing a standalone story, I would simply have made up a color on the spot (and, of course, carefully notated it back into my background notes for later reference). But I was reluctant to do that here; someone else might have made a passing reference to the color in a story I hadn’t read. I dodged the issue by simply not mentioning a color—often the simplest solution to a consistency problem.\n\nAt the same time, meshing your story smoothly into an existing framework has a joy of its own. I enjoyed doing my best to meld TS seamlessly into the continuity of the locale and the stories.\n\nCharacter Camaraderie\n\nThe greatest fun, however, came in the opportunity to integrate other authors’ characters and locales into the story as it developed.\n\nMy heroine Trina needed a best-friend-forever in town—someone she could talk to as the plot developed. It occurred to me that a secondary character in Amber Daulton’s Lyrical Embrace, the sister of her hero, would make a fine confidante. Like Trina, Ruby Haynes is a musician; that created a natural connection and explained a shared history. And Ruby’s breezy good cheer made her a perfect foil.\n\nI had a great time consulting with Amber and making sure my portrayal of Ruby was consistent with the original. What kind of drinks would they share? What would Ruby name a baby? The circle was completed when the baby I’d named turned up again in Amber’s subsequent Deerbourne novel Harmony’s Embrace. Like a volley in tennis, passing these story elements back and forth is a satisfying experience.\n\nIn a similar way, I found a way to make use of a specific location created by Tena Stetler for her novel Mystic Maples. I checked with Tena to make sure my description meshed correctly with her conception of the locale, and wrote it into TS as part of the already-existing background.\n\nThe Draw of a Shared World\n\nThere’s a unique charm to finding connections and crossovers in the stories we like. As with Easter eggs in a movie or a game, we delight in discovering an unexpected convergence. Over and above the heightened realism of a universe in which consistent features recur, it’s just fun to see the web of connections grow. Time Signature gave me the opportunity to weave a new layer into the tapestry of the Deerbourne Inn world; I hope that will please readers as much as it does me.\n\nConflict and Challenge\n\nThe “conflict” we expect in a story can take many forms. External, internal; protagonists against themselves, against other people, against nature, against society. If you grew up on adventure stories, as I did, you may tend to focus on showy external struggles—wars and battles. (Explosions!!) Even more so if your formative reading included comic books: the first question for a new issue was always, who is Spider-Man fighting this month?—even if there might be more long-term interest in the issue’s developments regarding Spidey’s love life or character development.\n\nBut in some stories, or parts of stories, the focus is on building or making something, rather than fighting something. The underlying engine of such a story might better be called challenge than “conflict”—a struggle to achieve some definite end product, rather than to defeat an adversary. It’s a sort of engineering story, rather than a crisis—although there may be crises along the way.\n\nBob the Builder\n\nAlmost every possible kind of conflict can be found in Dennis Taylor’s “Bobiverse” science fiction novels: We are Legion (We are Bob), For We Are Many, All These Worlds (2016-2017). (Looking them up, I’m pleased to see a new sequel, Heaven’s River, is now out in audiobook form.) The series touches on a whole range of SF tropes, from first contact to space war to ecological catastrophe.\n\nBob Johansson, software magnate, dies in the 21st century and wakes up a hundred years later as a sapient computer program, intended to be the guiding intelligence of an interstellar probe, like a computerized version of Jerome Corbell in Niven’s A World Out of Time. Once under way, however, Bob strikes out on his own, becoming involved with rival probes from another country, the evacuation of a failing Earth, and (eventually) honest-to-goodness aliens. His probe is equipped with 3-D printers and other gear that allows him to “clone” himself—build new ships run by copies of the Bob program. Each Bob instance takes a new name and, once running independently, develops a slightly different personality. Hence the book titles: we eventually have a whole armada of Bob spaceships, single-handedly—if that’s the right description—planting new human colonies and conducting interstellar wars.\n\nBut you don’t bootstrap your way into an armada overnight. A good bit of the story, especially in the early parts, requires Bob to balance multiple demands. How much of his productive capacity should be directed to manufacturing new Bobs, and how much to hunting down dangerous opponents? Or transporting human refugees to new worlds? To make matters more interesting, some of the Bobs specialize in research, coming up with new scientific discoveries that need to be engineered and adapted for others’ use—as time, transport, and communications permit.\n\nPart of the fascination involves how Bob gradually builds up a sort of interstellar network of cooperating AI ships. (Of course they cooperate; they’re all Bob. Sort of.) How he does this, what difficulties and complications he runs into, is as intriguing as the more exotic or action-oriented sequences. It’s very cool to see one lone intelligent probe gradually develop into an entire star-spanning civilization.\n\nBuilding Ships and Planets\n\nF.M. Busby’s Rissa Kerguelen books (1976)—published in various combinations—are the saga of a young woman who starts out as an enslaved orphan under a vicious tyranny on Earth, and ends by bringing back a space fleet to overthrow the tyranny. She allies herself (both militarily and maritally) with the equally formidable Bran Tregare and the Hulzein family, who share that goal.\n\nWhen I say “space fleet,” I’m not talking about thousands of massive ships. This is a bunch of modest-sized spacecraft manned by an assemblage of quirky, anarchic individuals—more like a Star Wars rebel fleet than an Honor Harrington space navy. Much of the middle section of the story is taken up with the long-term preparations needed for the eventual battles. Rissa and Tregare redesign and refit their stolen spaceships for combat; pull together the aforesaid individualists into a functional fighting group; and gradually, cautiously, get to know and love each other, after a battleground marriage for political purposes. That simultaneous slow build of machinery, financing, and relationships is as engrossing as Rissa’s initial escape from the “Total Welfare” system or the ultimate invasion of Earth. Even the engineering problems, solved in the context of these budding relationships, hold my interest throughout.\n\nOr take Heinlein’s juvenile novel Farmer in the Sky (1950). Teenaged Bill Lermer emigrates with his family to Ganymede, which is being terraformed into a habitable site for Earthly settlers. The big moon is completely barren, devoid of life. The “terraforming” involves not just big technology, like the atmosphere plant and heat trap, but also the creation of soil suitable for farming, inch by inch. Rock has to be ground into soil, then seeded with Terrestrial microbes, earthworms, and the like, before the first crop can be planted. This process, which Bill sees at ground level—he’s a farmer-to-be, not a planner or engineer—is endlessly fascinating, though no doubt the details would differ if the book were written today, with seventy years’ more knowledge about the solar system. It left me with an abiding sense of how complex the web of geological and biological factors really is, underlying something so seemingly simple as dirt farming.\n\nBuilding a Business\n\nNot that you have to go to Ganymede to find a narrative about constructing something new. I recently mentioned R.F. Delderfield’s “Swann saga.” The hero (and the heroine) here are building up something apparently mundane: a trucking business, using the newfangled horseless carriages, to connect the railroad network to the small towns and hamlets of Victorian England. The characters tumble in and out of various conflicts, but the underlying thrust of the story is about the growth of a business. We see its material factors—vehicles, storehouses, roadways, Adam Swann’s unique organizational planning gizmo—but, more importantly, the varied people whose talents and peculiarities contribute to the success of the whole operation. Building a business enterprise can be as rewarding as building a spaceship—or a planet.\n\nOccasionally this kind of constructive work also crops up in a modern corporate context. My catalogue of movie favorites contains only two stories I can think of that convey some of the excitement—the romance (in both senses of the word)—of big business. The Secret of My Success (1987), with Michael J. Fox and Helen Slater, is mostly a knockabout farce, but we do respond to the infectious enthusiasm of Fox’s character. What makes him more engaging than the other “suits” is that he’s excited about the idea of serving customers and making a productive business grow. Similarly, in Working Girl (1988), we’re mostly taken up in the plucky struggles of Melanie Griffith’s Tess McGill to break the glass ceiling of the secretarial pool; but we can also admire the artistry and accomplishment of the radio broadcasting merger deal she puts together.\n\nCastaways and Escapes\n\nConstruction in the midst of a crisis can become an epic in itself. In Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer’s When Worlds Collide (1933), much of the story is taken up with the desperate challenges the protagonists must overcome as they race against time to build the spaceship that will enable them to escape Earth’s destruction. (Pay no attention to the 1951 movie version, which is a catastrophe in its own right.)\n\nThe oncoming disaster adds dramatic tension to an effort that would be heroic even if it were undertaken without that threat in view. We see the thousand dedicated people of Cole Hendron’s “cantonment” working on the massive project; striving to obtain the necessary resources as civilization begins to crumble around them; making the scientific breakthrough they need to control atomic energy for their engines; defending the ship against attacks by mobs reverted to barbarism; and rejoicing in immense relief when they find they can construct a second ship that will allow all of them, not just a fraction, to escape Earth’s doom. Even the momentary pauses to describe the design of the ship, or the careful preparations to take along the necessary plants, animals, and knowledge to recreate Earthly life on the new world, are engrossing in the context of the mighty achievement. In fact, after all this build-up, the actual brief space-flight is almost an anticlimax.\n\nThe whole subgenre of castaway or “desert island” stories almost automatically incorporates themes of making and building, often by ingenious improvisation. In an earlier post I mentioned Jules Verne’s The Mysterious Island (1874), a childhood favorite of mine, and Heinlein’s Tunnel in the Sky (1955). Disney fans may recall the impressive treehouse of the Swiss Family Robinson movie (1960), faithfully re-created at Disney parks. In more modern renditions such as Eric Flint and Ryk Spoor’s Castaway Planet series, the main characters are similarly involved in carving out a place to live in an otherwise uninhabited locale.\n\nResources and Technology\n\nThe interest of stories like these is akin to the way we enjoy playing certain kinds of games, those with a “resource management” feature. I am, for example, perpetually fascinated with Sid Meier’s famous Civilization games. In managing a selected civilization throughout its history, we can get into wars with other “civs,” whether they are run by the computer or (in some versions) by another human player. But war is not essential to winning the game, as it is in chess. Exploration, the founding of new cities, and scientific development are vital, and offer other ways to win. While the danger of war with other cultures adds an important spice to the game, I find I’m more interested in discovering new places and developing a well-functioning culture.\n\nSimilar features can be found in other popular video games—Starcraft, Warcraft (but not World of Warcraft, which is a role-playing game), Settlers of Catan. Even the venerable Monopoly fits this description to some extent. To the extent to which these games are focused on winning, we do engage in a conflict; we seek a higher score than our competitors achieve. But sometimes it’s a relief to play a game that doesn’t directly involve fighting.\n\nI mentioned scientific development in connection with Civilization. Researching how to make new sorts of units and improvements is crucial to that game. (By contrast, in Monopoly all we need to build houses and hotels is money, and monopolies.) Stories about building frequently involve playing out the consequences of a new technology, if only because new tech opens new opportunities and hence new fields for development.\n\nOld-time space operas sometimes touched on this factor, but tended to short-cut the extensive work of implementing a new technology in favor of getting directly to the action. E.E. Smith’s Skylark Duquesne (1965), last of the Skylark tetralogy, alludes briefly in chapter 8 to the impact on Earthly industry of the fantastic scientific advances in the previous volumes. But those changes hardly have an impact on the story. We see a slightly more gradual and plausible development in a couple of books from Roger MacBride Allen, The Ring of Charon (1990) and The Shattered Sphere (1994), where a newly discovered artificial gravity technique gets put to use in progressively more advanced ways. Even the Delderfield Swann series mentioned above is based on the new opportunities created in the 19th Century by railroads and the internal-combustion engine.\n\nBlessed are the Peaceful Makers\n\nThe peculiar enjoyment of stories about building comes, I think, partly from the sense we share with the characters of accomplishing something. The action of the story is constructive rather than destructive.\n\nGranted, we’re perfectly willing to applaud destruction too, in a good cause. (Take that, Death Star!) And stories of violent conflict are perfectly suited to give us edge-of-the-seat thrills that are harder to come by in narratives of making. Still, we don’t always want an adrenaline rush all the time. It can be quietly satisfying when we don’t have to focus on winning a war, or on the danger of losing something dear to us and the desperation of defending it.\n\nThe satisfaction of successful making came up in a post last Christmas about the appeal of concreteness, whether in baking cookies or in building ships (as in the denouement of Pretty Woman). Both construction and destruction are sometimes necessary: “A time to build up, a time to break down.” But building responds to a different facet of our humanity than destroying. A good story may speak to one or the other, or to both.\n\nThis week we have a guest post from Peggy Jaeger, a fellow author at the Wild Rose Press. She’s got a new romance series going, “A Pride of Brothers.” Since the name of the first book’s hero is Rick, she’s obviously setting off on the right foot.\n\nIn today’s post, she talks about moving into writing for a new subgenre. Over to you, Peggy!\n\nA Pride of Brothers: Rick\n\nFor most of my fiction writing career (all 5 years if it!) I’ve written contemporary romance novels and RomComs, or romantic comedies. Since these are my favorite romance books to read, it stands to reason they’d be my favorite to write.\n\nThe publication of my newest book, though, A Pride of Brothers: Rick, is a bit of a departure for me, writing-structure-wise. With this book and the two others planned for the series, I’m delving into the romantic suspense lite genre. I’ll explain the “lite” portion in a bit, but first . . .\n\nWriting romance isn’t easy, but there are some tried and true rules you must follow to have a book classified as a romance in any of the subgenres.\n\nYou must have a central love interest in the story. It can be between a man and a woman, two men, a woman and a shape-shifting dragon . . . you get the idea. As long as there is a central love story within the book, you have a qualified romance.\n\nYou must have a happily ever after (HEA) ending, or at least a final happy for now (HFN) one. The obvious definition of the first is the classic, And they lived happily ever after, where a marriage and an emotional commitment is solidified at the end of the book. This used to mean marriage and only marriage. Nowadays, a romance can have a happy for now ending and still be qualified as a romantic read as long as the people involved in the central love story are committed to one another. The hope of a lifetime commitment is there, written as a promise, but not explicitly divulged on the page. Get the difference?\n\nTaboo subjects you must never include as the central theme in a romance are rape, incest, child abuse, sexual abuse—really, abuse of any kind—cruelty, and bestiality.\n\nIf you follow these rules you can write a romance.\n\nThe structure of writing a romantic suspense is a bit different.\n\nYes, you must still have a love interest within the plot, and yes, it still needs to have an HEA or a HFN ending. Rule number 3 applies to every book, so I don’t need to reiterate it here.\n\nThe difference in this subgenre that is apparent, though, is in the name: romantic suspense.\n\nThe definition of this subgenre varies a bit, but basically it is any romance novel in which suspense, mystery or thriller elements constitute an integral part of the plot, or one that features a prominent mystery, suspense or thriller story line.\n\nWhen I was a teenager in the ‘80s this type of book was called a WOMAN IN JEOPARDY story because the plot centered around a woman who had some kind of danger in her life like an abusive ex-beau, or a stalker. The implication of the tag line was that a woman needed a man to help her out of the bad situation (the “jeopardy”), and in so doing, they’d fall in love.\n\nNowadays, that sexist and archaic description is gone, replaced with “Romantic Suspense,” and it’s not only the gals who need help with a problem any longer. There are plenty of bad-ass female bounty hunters, cops, etc., out there who help the hero with an issue.\n\nWelcome to the 21st century, folks.\n\nSo, I promised an explanation of the term romantic suspense lite with regards to my writing.\n\nI didn’t set out to write a romantic suspense when I came up with the story line for the first Pride of Brothers book. I wanted to tell a frenemies-to-lovers story about two strong and opposite personalities who wound up falling in love. That’s the romance aspect of the tale. I had to make them foils, and the plot needed to revolve around something where one of them would need to help the other out of a situation.\n\nWhat I came up with was a story about a lawyer who fights for disenfranchised women and their children, and a man who was the definition of disenfranchised as a child. When the husband of a client threatens the lawyer and then subsequently tries to murder his wife and kidnap his son, the hero vows to protect the heroine from danger. She isn’t convinced she is in danger, but a series of events unfolds that proves she is. That’s the suspense part. It’s the hero’s job to keep her safe, even though she can do that on her own.\n\nThe reason I dub it a lite romantic suspense is that more than 60% of the tale is the evolving romance between the two protagonists, with about 40% steeped in the actual thriller/suspense part of it. There is a forced proximity aspect to the storyline, which is a classic romsusp factor, along with knife fights, guns, and kidnapping—all elements you don’t find in your everyday regular small town romance novel.\n\nI am hopeful I’ve done the subgenre proud with the release of this book. It was an absolute blast to write and I can only hope it is enjoyable to readers as well.\n\nLook for book two, A PRIDE OF BROTHERS: DYLAN early in 2021.\n\nUntil next time ~ Peg\n\nA Pride of Brothers: Rick at\n\nAmazon ~ Barnes & Noble ~ Apple Books ~Books-A-Million\n\nHugo Material\n\nScience fiction writer Becky Chambers is up for a Hugo award (SF’s equivalent of the Oscars or Pulitzer Prize) this year—twice. Her 2018 novel Record of a Spaceborn Few has been nominated for best novel. The Wayfarers series, of which Record is the third book, is also in the running for best series this year.\n\nThe series as a whole, and especially the most recent book, highlight a facet of SF that can sometimes be neglected in the shadow of the world-shaking blockbuster epics: stories that are concerned more with what happens to individuals and small groups than with the Fate of the World. I’m going to tag this subcategory “domestic SF.”\n\nI don’t mean to imply that Chambers’ tales are concerned with cosy traditional family life. On the contrary, some of her characters’ situations are decidedly nonconventional. This is science fiction, after all. But family and home do play a central role.\n\nHigh Stakes\n\nWhen we think of science fiction—especially early modern SF, from about 1920-1940—we tend to think of adventure stories: space opera, “planetary romances” like Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter stories, or the modern revival in Star Trek and Star Wars. In these tales, conflict was a must, and often on a grand scale. We were Saving the World, or even the galaxy, the universe; or at least (for instance) the beloved city of Helium, as John Carter was wont to do.\n\nMany of these early epics had to do with exploration. We were ‘going where no one had gone before’ in the Jules Verne Voyages Extraordinaires, or in H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds (though in the latter case one might say instead that ‘where no one had gone before’ was coming to us). The heroes were frequently achieving the first of something, a momentous event: first spaceflight, first interstellar flight, first contact with nonhuman intelligence, or (when spaceflight had become routine) first landing on some particularly odd sort of planet. Whatever they were doing, it was a big deal.\n\nOf course this was never all of science fiction; but it made up a major part of modern SF. And this tendency continued into the mid-20th century. Even a scenario that initially seemed purely local and personal often turned out to have grand-scale implications.\n\nIn Heinlein’s The Star Beast (1954), for example, the Everyboy teenage hero is unusual only in having a pet that was puppy-sized when his great-grandfather brought it back from an interstellar trip, but has gradually grown to the scale of a medium-sized dinosaur. The story opens with “Lummox” getting into trouble by eating a neighbor’s roses, plowing straight through a set of greenhouses, and so forth—the kind of domestic turmoil that might turn up in any situation comedy. (At least in science fiction.) But it eventually turns out that Lummox is actually a mere child from a fearsomely intelligent and pugnacious extraterrestrial species that lives for centuries. When her relatives come calling, it requires a major diplomatic effort to head off an interstellar war. What started out as a neighborhood squabble has become a planetary crisis.\n\nWe see something of the same development, but with a different twist, in the movie E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The first part of the story focuses mainly on the friendship that develops between E.T. and young Elliott. The situation grows into an adult-level crisis in the second part. But Spielberg has a different take: even at the end, the story remains centered on that personal relationship between the two main characters. The trail of candies Elliott lays out for E.T. leads to a momentous first-contact moment; but it isn’t clear at the end whether Elliott’s contact will lead to some kind of new era for humanity, or whether things will return to normal once the alien spacecraft departs.\n\nE.T. shows that what’s at stake in SF doesn’t have to be world-shaking. The whole story may simply revolve around the lives of a few main characters. And that’s what I mean by ‘domestic SF.’\n\nThe Wayfarers Books\n\nChambers’ first novel, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (2014), opens when a young woman named Rosemary Harper joins the motley crew of an aging spaceship-for-hire called the Wayfarer. Her relationships with the varied personalities (and species) of the crew draw her out of herself and allow her to develop her potential in classic bildungsroman fashion. As the plot thickens, Wayfarer does get involved in major diplomatic affairs, in a small way. But, as with E.T., the focus stays on the characters and their interactions. We’re much more concerned about whether (for instance) the ship’s AI, Lovelace, will succeed in being downloaded into a human body at the urging of her human beloved, than in galactic politics. Wikipedia puts it concisely: “The novel concerns itself with character development rather than adventure.”\n\nThis tendency is even more pronounced in the second story. A Closed and Common Orbit (2016) leaves behind most of the characters of the first book to follow the distinct, newborn AI that ended up occupying the human body in question at the end of The Long Way. Orbit entirely eschews the grand scale in favor of personal relationships, as the main character tries to decide how to manage this strange new life in the flesh while making friends with a woman who herself had an extremely odd childhood. One review correctly observed that Orbit is even “more intimate than its predecessor.”\n\nThe third story, Record of a Spaceborn Few, takes place in the same universe but, again, mobilizes an entirely different cast of characters. Chambers is not writing a cumulative single story on the model of, say, the Star Wars movies. Rather, each book is complete in itself, although they share a common background and characters occasionally cross over. This in itself indicates that we are not building up to a single galaxy-spanning climax. The author’s interests lie elsewhere.\n\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few\n\nThe most recent book builds on the backstory of which we’ve seen glimpses in the prior volumes. In Chambers’ future history, humanity, having ruined its home planet, sets out en masse to search for new homes in slower-than-light generation ships, the “Exodus fleet.” It’s only when the are discovered by more advanced nonhuman species that they gain limited access, as impoverished refugees, to higher technologies and faster-than-light travel. By the time of the stories, people from the Fleet have spread out to live among other species on numerous other worlds; some have even returned to their own solar system to colonize Mars. But a substantial number of humans still remain aboard the immense ships that had been their ancestors’ homes for so long, which have now been put in permanent orbits around a star loaned to them by another species.\n\nRecord explores possible options for choosing to live one’s life in these circumstances. Some of the “Exodans,” like young Kip, pine for the wider horizons of a planet, yet end up opting for a place within the Fleet—after spending some time going to college “abroad,” onplanet. Others, like Tessa and her family, do take on the new experience of living in the open, on a planet. Meanwhile, some of the dispersed humans born on planets come to decide they’d rather live aboard the Fleet, whose close-knit culture has its attractions despite the shabby and relatively modest conditions aboard; and some of the Exodans choose to create a “cultural education” center to train these returnees so they can fit into that culture.\n\nA friendly alien observer, visiting the Fleet to gain material for a study and staying with one of the main characters, provides an external viewpoint to place these various life decisions in context. But the core of the story is how each individual or family chooses among the different possible ways of life. There’s no great crisis or climax, and the story doesn’t come down on the side of one lifestyle or another. It simply lays out the possibilities.\n\nFamily Life Out There\n\nChambers’ stories, then, seem to be moving more and more in the direction of ‘domestic’ or small-scale concerns. There’s a continuing theme of belonging to a family group, or something like one—even when the “family” in question, as in Orbit, consists of both ordinary embodied humans and “sessile” AIs that never leave the home they operate (giving a whole new meaning to the term “homemaker”).\n\nWith Chambers as the bellwether, so to speak, we can trace similar kinds of stories back through the history of SF. For example, another Heinlein “juvenile” novel, The Rolling Stones (1952), really is a domestic story: the Stone family, bored with their comfortable life on the quietly citified Moon, buys a spaceship and sets off to visit Mars and then the asteroid belt, getting into various scrapes and small-scale adventures as they go.\n\nThese “adventures” can be as mundane as the teenage twins’ run-in with bureaucracy and the law when they try to import bicycles to Mars without first researching the customs duties—or as serious as a life-endangering spacecraft malfunction. But there are no grander events or interplanetary crises involved. (Incidentally, the book has nothing at all to do with the band The Rolling Stones, not even if you try to compare the “rocks” of the asteroid belt with—no, even I’m not going to go there.)\n\nAnother perennial favorite of mine is Zenna Henderson’s tales of the People, refugees from a far-off world who are scattered across the Earth when they must escape in “life-slips” as their spacecraft breaks up on entering our atmosphere. These short stories each center on different individuals or families of characters, built around a common theme of finding the lost and bringing them back to their own people. The unusual powers of the People often evoke xenophobic hostility in the Earthlings among whom they are hiding—but just as often bring out compassion and kindness from the people who take them in and help them. The array of short stories does not really build to any climax or conclusion. Rather, each person’s fate is a story in itself—though it is intimately bound up with those of others.\n\nWhole subgenres of SF are inherently oriented toward the small and personal. There’s a significant category of science fiction murder mysteries—Isaac Asimov was famous for these—which by definition revolve around a particular individual’s death, which may or may not have cosmic ramifications. Similarly, a SF romance necessarily focuses on a particular couple; and again, while their relationship may have broad-scale importance, the story is just as sound if what matters is only the two of them.\n\nOn the Big Screen\n\nMy impression is that SF movies, even more than books, have tended to concentrate on big crises and broad scope; perhaps a visual medium evokes a particular fascination with spectacle. (Explosions, give me lots of explosions.) But that’s not always the case. Now that we’ve shown we can do believably spectacular stories along the Star Wars lines, moviemakers may be turning back toward more personal-level tales.\n\nA good example is the teenage SF romance The Space Between Us (2017). I’m fond of this film, though it didn’t do well as the box office and was disliked by critics. The movie fits our survey here because it’s all about the particular pair and the other people involved with them. There’s a base or colony on Mars, but that’s just the background that sets up the essential premise of the story—how a boy born and raised in a scientific station on Mars is determined to visit the home planet and to meet the girl he’s been corresponding with there.\n\nI’m tempted also to cite the Chris Pratt-Jennifer Lawrence film Passengers (2016). It’s all about the two principal characters (who are the only characters for much of the story). The stakes do rise at least to “save the ship” level when the main characters have to perform death-defying acts to prevent the destruction of the sleeper ship they’re on. But, as a romance, it does maintain a focus on the fates of those two people—in a way that is rather poignantly realized at the end.\n\nConclusion\n\nBecky Chambers’ Hugo nominees thus illustrate that aspect of SF that deals with the personal and local rather than the grand and spectacular. I’m all for more of this. Once we get over the initial amazement at space travel and other scientific advances, we can settle down to telling the small individual stories that these advances make possible—without giving up the grand-scale tales as well, of course. In a literary realm, eating our cake and still having it is a consummation devoutly to be wished."
