        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nIn court at Venice, Shylock demands that the terms of his bond be fulfilled. Portia enters as a doctor of laws, with a letter of introduction from Dr. Bellario. She saves Antonio by determining that the bond allows Shylock no more than a pound of Antonio’s flesh and not a drop of his blood. She also finds Shylock guilty of plotting the death of a Venetian and subject to the penalty of forfeiting his estate and suffering execution. Antonio intercedes with the Duke to reduce the penalty. A defeated Shylock agrees to the proposed terms.\n\nBassanio offers the disguised Portia the three thousand ducats that he brought to give to Shylock, but Portia demands the ring that she herself gave Bassanio. When he refuses, she departs as if insulted. When Antonio asks Bassanio to give the ring, Bassanio sends Gratiano after her with it.\n\nEnter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio,\n\n⌜Salerio,⌝ and Gratiano, ⌜with Attendants.⌝\n\nDUKE 1910 What, is Antonio here?\n\nANTONIO 1911 Ready, so please your Grace.\n\nDUKE\n\n1912 I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answer\n\n1913 A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\n\n1914 5 Uncapable of pity, void and empty\n\n1915 From any dram of mercy.\n\nANTONIO 1916 I have heard\n\n1917 Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify\n\n1918 His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\n\n1919 10 And that no lawful means can carry me\n\n1920 Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose\n\n1921 My patience to his fury, and am armed\n\n1922 To suffer with a quietness of spirit\n\n1923 The very tyranny and rage of his.\n\nDUKE\n\n1924 15 Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.\n\nSALERIO\n\n1925 He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.\n\nEnter Shylock.\n\nDUKE\n\n1926 Make room, and let him stand before our face.—\n\np. 143\n\n1927 Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\n\n1928 That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice\n\n1929 20 To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,\n\n1930 Thou ’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange\n\n1931 Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;\n\n1932 And where thou now exacts the penalty,\n\n1933 Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,\n\n1934 25 Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\n\n1935 But, touched with humane gentleness and love,\n\n1936 Forgive a moi’ty of the principal,\n\n1937 Glancing an eye of pity on his losses\n\n1938 That have of late so huddled on his back,\n\n1939 30 Enow to press a royal merchant down\n\n1940 And pluck commiseration of ⌜his state⌝\n\n1941 From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of ⌜flint,⌝\n\n1942 From stubborn Turks, and Tartars never trained\n\n1943 To offices of tender courtesy.\n\n1944 35 We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1945 I have possessed your Grace of what I purpose,\n\n1946 And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\n\n1947 To have the due and forfeit of my bond.\n\n1948 If you deny it, let the danger light\n\n1949 40 Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!\n\n1950 You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have\n\n1951 A weight of carrion flesh than to receive\n\n1952 Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,\n\n1953 But say it is my humor. Is it answered?\n\n1954 45 What if my house be troubled with a rat,\n\n1955 And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats\n\n1956 To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?\n\n1957 Some men there are love not a gaping pig,\n\n1958 Some that are mad if they behold a cat,\n\n1959 50 And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,\n\n1960 Cannot contain their urine; for affection\n\n1961 Masters ⌜oft⌝ passion, sways it to the mood\n\np. 145\n\n1962 Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:\n\n1963 As there is no firm reason to be rendered\n\n1964 55 Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,\n\n1965 Why he a harmless necessary cat,\n\n1966 Why he a woolen bagpipe, but of force\n\n1967 Must yield to such inevitable shame\n\n1968 As to offend, himself being offended,\n\n1969 60 So can I give no reason, nor I will not,\n\n1970 More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing\n\n1971 I bear Antonio, that I follow thus\n\n1972 A losing suit against him. Are you answered?\n\nBASSANIO\n\n1973 This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\n\n1974 65 To excuse the current of thy cruelty.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1975 I am not bound to please thee with my answers.\n\nBASSANIO\n\n1976 Do all men kill the things they do not love?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1977 Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\n\nBASSANIO\n\n1978 Every offence is not a hate at first.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1979 70 What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\n\nANTONIO, ⌜to Bassanio⌝\n\n1980 I pray you, think you question with the Jew.\n\n1981 You may as well go stand upon the beach\n\n1982 And bid the main flood bate his usual height;\n\n1983 You may as well use question with the wolf\n\n1984 75 Why he hath made the ewe ⌜bleat⌝ for the lamb;\n\n1985 You may as well forbid the mountain pines\n\n1986 To wag their high tops and to make no noise\n\n1987 When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\n\n1988 You may as well do anything most hard\n\n1989 80 As seek to soften that than which what’s harder?—\n\n1990 His Jewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you\n\np. 147\n\n1991 Make no more offers, use no farther means,\n\n1992 But with all brief and plain conveniency\n\n1993 Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.\n\nBASSANIO\n\n1994 85 For thy three thousand ducats here is six.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1995 If every ducat in six thousand ducats\n\n1996 Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,\n\n1997 I would not draw them. I would have my bond.\n\nDUKE\n\n1998 How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n1999 90 What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\n\n2000 You have among you many a purchased slave,\n\n2001 Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\n\n2002 You use in abject and in slavish parts\n\n2003 Because you bought them. Shall I say to you\n\n2004 95 “Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!\n\n2005 Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\n\n2006 Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates\n\n2007 Be seasoned with such viands”? You will answer\n\n2008 “The slaves are ours!” So do I answer you:\n\n2009 100 The pound of flesh which I demand of him\n\n2010 Is dearly bought; ⌜’tis⌝ mine and I will have it.\n\n2011 If you deny me, fie upon your law:\n\n2012 There is no force in the decrees of Venice.\n\n2013 I stand for judgment. Answer: shall I have it?\n\nDUKE\n\n2014 105 Upon my power I may dismiss this court\n\n2015 Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor\n\n2016 Whom I have sent for to determine this,\n\n2017 Come here today.\n\nSALERIO 2018 My lord, here stays without\n\n2019 110 A messenger with letters from the doctor,\n\n2020 New come from Padua.\n\np. 149\n\nDUKE\n\n2021 Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.\n\nBASSANIO\n\n2022 Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\n\n2023 The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all\n\n2024 115 Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood!\n\nANTONIO\n\n2025 I am a tainted wether of the flock,\n\n2026 Meetest for death. The weakest kind of fruit\n\n2027 Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.\n\n2028 You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,\n\n2029 120 Than to live still and write mine epitaph.\n\nEnter Nerissa, ⌜disguised as a lawyer’s clerk.⌝\n\nDUKE\n\n2030 Came you from Padua, from Bellario?\n\nNERISSA, ⌜as Clerk⌝\n\n2031 From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.\n\n⌜Handing him a paper, which he reads, aside, while\n\nShylock sharpens his knife on the sole of his shoe.⌝\n\nBASSANIO\n\n2032 Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2033 To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there.\n\nGRATIANO\n\n2034 125 Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\n\n2035 Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,\n\n2036 No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness\n\n2037 Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2038 No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\n\nGRATIANO\n\n2039 130 O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog,\n\n2040 And for thy life let justice be accused;\n\n2041 Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,\n\n2042 To hold opinion with Pythagoras\n\np. 151\n\n2043 That souls of animals infuse themselves\n\n2044 135 Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit\n\n2045 Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,\n\n2046 Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\n\n2047 And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,\n\n2048 Infused itself in thee, for thy desires\n\n2049 140 Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2050 Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\n\n2051 Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.\n\n2052 Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\n\n2053 To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\n\nDUKE\n\n2054 145 This letter from Bellario doth commend\n\n2055 A young and learnèd doctor to our court.\n\n2056 Where is he?\n\nNERISSA, ⌜as Clerk⌝ 2057 He attendeth here hard by\n\n2058 To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.\n\nDUKE\n\n2059 150 With all my heart.—Some three or four of you\n\n2060 Go give him courteous conduct to this place.\n\n⌜Attendants exit.⌝\n\n2061 Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.\n\n⌜He reads.⌝\n\n2062 Your Grace shall understand that, at the receipt of\n\n2063 your letter, I am very sick, but in the instant that your\n\n2064 155 messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a\n\n2065 young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\n\n2066 acquainted him with the cause in controversy between\n\n2067 the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o’er\n\n2068 many books together. He is furnished with my opinion,\n\n2069 160 which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness\n\n2070 whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with\n\n2071 him at my importunity to fill up your Grace’s request\n\n2072 in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\n\n2073 impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I\n\np. 153\n\n2074 165 never knew so young a body with so old a head. I\n\n2075 leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\n\n2076 shall better publish his commendation.\n\n2077 You hear the learnèd Bellario what he writes.\n\nEnter Portia for Balthazar, ⌜disguised as a doctor of\n\nlaws, with Attendants.⌝\n\n2078 And here I take it is the doctor come.—\n\n2079 170 Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2080 I did, my lord.\n\nDUKE 2081 You are welcome. Take your place.\n\n2082 Are you acquainted with the difference\n\n2083 That holds this present question in the court?\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2084 175 I am informèd throughly of the cause.\n\n2085 Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\n\nDUKE\n\n2086 Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2087 Is your name Shylock?\n\nSHYLOCK 2088 Shylock is my name.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2089 180 Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,\n\n2090 Yet in such rule that the Venetian law\n\n2091 Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.\n\n2092 ⌜To Antonio.⌝ You stand within his danger, do you\n\n2093 not?\n\nANTONIO\n\n2094 185 Ay, so he says.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝ 2095 Do you confess the bond?\n\nANTONIO\n\n2096 I do.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝ 2097 Then must the Jew be merciful.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2098 On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\n\np. 155\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2099 190 The quality of mercy is not strained.\n\n2100 It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\n\n2101 Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:\n\n2102 It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\n\n2103 ’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\n\n2104 195 The thronèd monarch better than his crown.\n\n2105 His scepter shows the force of temporal power,\n\n2106 The attribute to awe and majesty\n\n2107 Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\n\n2108 But mercy is above this sceptered sway.\n\n2109 200 It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings;\n\n2110 It is an attribute to God Himself;\n\n2111 And earthly power doth then show likest God’s\n\n2112 When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\n\n2113 Though justice be thy plea, consider this:\n\n2114 205 That in the course of justice none of us\n\n2115 Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\n\n2116 And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\n\n2117 The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\n\n2118 To mitigate the justice of thy plea,\n\n2119 210 Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\n\n2120 Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant\n\n2121 there.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2122 My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\n\n2123 The penalty and forfeit of my bond.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2124 215 Is he not able to discharge the money?\n\nBASSANIO\n\n2125 Yes. Here I tender it for him in the court,\n\n2126 Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,\n\n2127 I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er\n\n2128 On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\n\n2129 220 If this will not suffice, it must appear\n\np. 157\n\n2130 That malice bears down truth. ⌜To the Duke.⌝ And I\n\n2131 beseech you,\n\n2132 Wrest once the law to your authority.\n\n2133 To do a great right, do a little wrong,\n\n2134 225 And curb this cruel devil of his will.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2135 It must not be. There is no power in Venice\n\n2136 Can alter a decree establishèd;\n\n2137 ’Twill be recorded for a precedent\n\n2138 And many an error by the same example\n\n2139 230 Will rush into the state. It cannot be.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2140 A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel.\n\n2141 O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2142 I pray you let me look upon the bond.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2143 Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\n\n⌜Handing Portia a paper.⌝\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2144 235 Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2145 An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven!\n\n2146 Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?\n\n2147 ⌜No,⌝ not for Venice!\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝ 2148 Why, this bond is forfeit,\n\n2149 240 And lawfully by this the Jew may claim\n\n2150 A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\n\n2151 Nearest the merchant’s heart.—Be merciful;\n\n2152 Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2153 When it is paid according to the tenor.\n\n2154 245 It doth appear you are a worthy judge;\n\n2155 You know the law; your exposition\n\n2156 Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\n\n2157 Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\n\np. 159\n\n2158 Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\n\n2159 250 There is no power in the tongue of man\n\n2160 To alter me. I stay here on my bond.\n\nANTONIO\n\n2161 Most heartily I do beseech the court\n\n2162 To give the judgment.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝ 2163 Why, then, thus it is:\n\n2164 255 You must prepare your bosom for his knife—\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2165 O noble judge! O excellent young man!\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2166 For the intent and purpose of the law\n\n2167 Hath full relation to the penalty,\n\n2168 Which here appeareth due upon the bond.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2169 260 ’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\n\n2170 How much more elder art thou than thy looks!\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar, to Antonio⌝\n\n2171 Therefore lay bare your bosom—\n\nSHYLOCK 2172 Ay, his breast!\n\n2173 So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\n\n2174 265 “Nearest his heart.” Those are the very words.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2175 It is so.\n\n2176 Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?\n\nSHYLOCK 2177 I have them ready.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2178 Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\n\n2179 270 To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2180 Is it so nominated in the bond?\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2181 It is not so expressed, but what of that?\n\n2182 ’Twere good you do so much for charity.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2183 I cannot find it. ’Tis not in the bond.\n\np. 161\n\nPORTIA, ⌜as Balthazar⌝\n\n2184 275 You, merchant, have you anything to say?\n\nANTONIO\n\n2185 But little. I am armed and well prepared.—\n\n2186 Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well.\n\n2187 Grieve not that I am fall’n to this for you,\n\n2188 For herein Fortune shows herself more kind\n\n2189 280 Than is her custom: it is still her use\n\n2190 To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\n\n2191 To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\n\n2192 An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance\n\n2193 Of such misery doth she cut me off.\n\n2194 285 Commend me to your honorable wife,\n\n2195 Tell her the process of Antonio’s end,\n\n2196 Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death,\n\n2197 And when the tale is told, bid her be judge\n\n2198 Whether Bassanio had not once a love.\n\n2199 290 Repent but you that you shall lose your friend\n\n2200 And he repents not that he pays your debt.\n\n2201 For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\n\n2202 I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\n\nBASSANIO\n\n2203 Antonio, I am married to a wife\n\n2204 295 Which is as dear to me as life itself,\n\n2205 But life itself, my wife, and all the world\n\n2206 Are not with me esteemed above thy life.\n\n2207 I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\n\n2208 Here to this devil, to deliver you.\n\nPORTIA, ⌜aside⌝\n\n2209 300 Your wife would give you little thanks for that\n\n2210 If she were by to hear you make the offer.\n\nGRATIANO\n\n2211 I have a wife who I protest I love.\n\n2212 I would she were in heaven, so she could\n\n2213 Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.\n\np. 163\n\nNERISSA, ⌜aside⌝\n\n2214 305 ’Tis well you offer it behind her back.\n\n2215 The wish would make else an unquiet house.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\n2216 These be the Christian husbands! I have a\n\n2217 daughter—\n\n2218 Would any of the stock of Barabbas\n\n2219 310 Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!\n\n2220 We trifle time.
