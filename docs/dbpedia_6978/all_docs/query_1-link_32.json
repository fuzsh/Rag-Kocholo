        "text": "Scene 1\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAdriana finds Antipholus (of Syracuse) with his sword drawn and orders that he and Dromio be bound. The Syracusans escape into a nearby priory. The Abbess of the priory refuses to make them come out. The Duke enters, bringing Egeon to execution. Adriana begs the Duke to remove Antipholus from the priory. When Antipholus and Dromio (of Ephesus) enter, having escaped from Dr. Pinch, the Duke listens to conflicting accounts of what Antipholus and Dromio have done. Egeon says that Antipholus is his son, but Antipholus denies knowing him. The Abbess enters with Antipholus and Dromio (of Syracuse). The day’s confusions are explained when the two sets of twins are seen side by side. Antipholus (of Syracuse) declares again his love for Luciana. The Abbess recognizes Egeon as her lost husband and the twin Antipholuses as her lost sons.\n\nEnter the ⌜Second⌝ Merchant and ⌜Angelo⌝ the\n\nGoldsmith.\n\nANGELO\n\n1458 I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,\n\n1459 But I protest he had the chain of me,\n\n1460 Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1461 How is the man esteemed here in the city?\n\nANGELO\n\n1462 5 Of very reverend reputation, sir,\n\n1463 Of credit infinite, highly beloved,\n\n1464 Second to none that lives here in the city.\n\n1465 His word might bear my wealth at any time.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1466 Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.\n\nEnter Antipholus and Dromio ⌜of Syracuse⌝ again,\n\n⌜Antipholus wearing the chain.⌝\n\nANGELO\n\n1467 10 ’Tis so, and that self chain about his neck\n\n1468 Which he forswore most monstrously to have.\n\n1469 Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.—\n\n1470 Signior Antipholus, I wonder much\n\n1471 That you would put me to this shame and trouble,\n\n1472 15 And not without some scandal to yourself,\n\np. 131\n\n1473 With circumstance and oaths so to deny\n\n1474 This chain, which now you wear so openly.\n\n1475 Besides the charge, the shame, imprisonment,\n\n1476 You have done wrong to this my honest friend,\n\n1477 20 Who, but for staying on our controversy,\n\n1478 Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.\n\n1479 This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?\n\nANTIPHOLUS ⌜OF SYRACUSE⌝\n\n1480 I think I had. I never did deny it.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1481 Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.\n\nANTIPHOLUS ⌜OF SYRACUSE⌝\n\n1482 25 Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1483 These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee.\n\n1484 Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st\n\n1485 To walk where any honest men resort.\n\nANTIPHOLUS ⌜OF SYRACUSE⌝\n\n1486 Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.\n\n1487 30 I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty\n\n1488 Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1489 I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.They draw.\n\nEnter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and others.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1490 Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.—\n\n1491 Some get within him; take his sword away.\n\n1492 35 Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house!\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\n1493 Run, master, run. For God’s sake, take a house.\n\n1494 This is some priory.

Wherefore throng you hither?\n\nADRIANA\n\n1496 To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.\n\n1497 40 Let us come in, that we may bind him fast\n\n1498 And bear him home for his recovery.\n\nANGELO\n\n1499 I knew he was not in his perfect wits.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1500 I am sorry now that I did draw on him.\n\nABBESS\n\n1501 How long hath this possession held the man?\n\nADRIANA\n\n1502 45 This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\n\n1503 And much different from the man he was.\n\n1504 But till this afternoon his passion\n\n1505 Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.\n\nABBESS\n\n1506 Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?\n\n1507 50 Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye\n\n1508 Strayed his affection in unlawful love,\n\n1509 A sin prevailing much in youthful men\n\n1510 Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?\n\n1511 Which of these sorrows is he subject to?\n\nADRIANA\n\n1512 55 To none of these, except it be the last,\n\n1513 Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.\n\nABBESS\n\n1514 You should for that have reprehended him.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1515 Why, so I did.\n\nABBESS 1516 Ay, but not rough enough.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1517 60 As roughly as my modesty would let me.\n\nABBESS\n\n1518 Haply in private.\n\np. 135\n\nADRIANA 1519 And in assemblies too.\n\nABBESS 1520 Ay, but not enough.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1521 It was the copy of our conference.\n\n1522 65 In bed he slept not for my urging it;\n\n1523 At board he fed not for my urging it.\n\n1524 Alone, it was the subject of my theme;\n\n1525 In company I often glancèd it.\n\n1526 Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.\n\nABBESS\n\n1527 70 And thereof came it that the man was mad.\n\n1528 The venom clamors of a jealous woman\n\n1529 Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.\n\n1530 It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing,\n\n1531 And thereof comes it that his head is light.\n\n1532 75 Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy\n\n1533 upbraidings.\n\n1534 Unquiet meals make ill digestions.\n\n1535 Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,\n\n1536 And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?\n\n1537 80 Thou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls.\n\n1538 Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue\n\n1539 But moody and dull melancholy,\n\n1540 Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n\n1541 And at her heels a huge infectious troop\n\n1542 85 Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?\n\n1543 In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest\n\n1544 To be disturbed would mad or man or beast.\n\n1545 The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits\n\n1546 Hath scared thy husband from the use of wits.\n\nLUCIANA\n\n1547 90 She never reprehended him but mildly\n\n1548 When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and\n\n1549 wildly.—\n\n1550 Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?\n\np. 137\n\nADRIANA\n\n1551 She did betray me to my own reproof.—\n\n1552 95 Good people, enter and lay hold on him.\n\nABBESS\n\n1553 No, not a creature enters in my house.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1554 Then let your servants bring my husband forth.\n\nABBESS\n\n1555 Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,\n\n1556 And it shall privilege him from your hands\n\n1557 100 Till I have brought him to his wits again\n\n1558 Or lose my labor in assaying it.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1559 I will attend my husband, be his nurse,\n\n1560 Diet his sickness, for it is my office\n\n1561 And will have no attorney but myself;\n\n1562 105 And therefore let me have him home with me.\n\nABBESS\n\n1563 Be patient, for I will not let him stir\n\n1564 Till I have used the approvèd means I have,\n\n1565 With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,\n\n1566 To make of him a formal man again.\n\n1567 110 It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,\n\n1568 A charitable duty of my order.\n\n1569 Therefore depart and leave him here with me.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1570 I will not hence and leave my husband here;\n\n1571 And ill it doth beseem your holiness\n\n1572 115 To separate the husband and the wife.\n\nABBESS\n\n1573 Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him.\n\n⌜She exits.⌝\n\nLUCIANA, ⌜to Adriana⌝\n\n1574 Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1575 Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet\n\n1576 And never rise until my tears and prayers\n\np. 139\n\n1577 120 Have won his grace to come in person hither\n\n1578 And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1579 By this, I think, the dial points at five.\n\n1580 Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person\n\n1581 Comes this way to the melancholy vale,\n\n1582 125 The place of ⌜death⌝ and sorry execution\n\n1583 Behind the ditches of the abbey here.\n\nANGELO 1584 Upon what cause?\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ MERCHANT\n\n1585 To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,\n\n1586 Who put unluckily into this bay\n\n1587 130 Against the laws and statutes of this town,\n\n1588 Beheaded publicly for his offense.\n\nANGELO\n\n1589 See where they come. We will behold his death.\n\nLUCIANA, ⌜to Adriana⌝\n\n1590 Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.\n\nEnter the Duke of Ephesus, and ⌜Egeon⌝ the Merchant\n\nof Syracuse, bare head, with the Headsman\n\nand other Officers.\n\nDUKE\n\n1591 Yet once again proclaim it publicly,\n\n1592 135 If any friend will pay the sum for him,\n\n1593 He shall not die; so much we tender him.\n\nADRIANA, ⌜kneeling⌝\n\n1594 Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.\n\nDUKE\n\n1595 She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.\n\n1596 It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1597 140 May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,\n\n1598 Who I made lord of me and all I had\n\n1599 At your important letters, this ill day\n\n1600 A most outrageous fit of madness took him,\n\np. 141\n\n1601 That desp’rately he hurried through the street,\n\n1602 145 With him his bondman, all as mad as he,\n\n1603 Doing displeasure to the citizens\n\n1604 By rushing in their houses, bearing thence\n\n1605 Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.\n\n1606 Once did I get him bound and sent him home\n\n1607 150 Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went\n\n1608 That here and there his fury had committed.\n\n1609 Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,\n\n1610 He broke from those that had the guard of him,\n\n1611 And with his mad attendant and himself,\n\n1612 155 Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,\n\n1613 Met us again and, madly bent on us,\n\n1614 Chased us away, till raising of more aid,\n\n1615 We came again to bind them. Then they fled\n\n1616 Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,\n\n1617 160 And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us\n\n1618 And will not suffer us to fetch him out,\n\n1619 Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.\n\n1620 Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command\n\n1621 Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\n\nDUKE\n\n1622 165 Long since, thy husband served me in my wars,\n\n1623 And I to thee engaged a prince’s word,\n\n1624 When thou didst make him master of thy bed,\n\n1625 To do him all the grace and good I could.\n\n1626 Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,\n\n1627 170 And bid the Lady Abbess come to me.\n\n1628 I will determine this before I stir.⌜Adriana rises.⌝\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\n⌜MESSENGER⌝\n\n1629 O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself.\n\n1630 My master and his man are both broke loose,\n\n1631 Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,\n\np. 143\n\n1632 175 Whose beard they have singed off with brands of\n\n1633 fire,\n\n1634 And ever as it blazed they threw on him\n\n1635 Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.\n\n1636 My master preaches patience to him, and the while\n\n1637 180 His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;\n\n1638 And sure, unless you send some present help,\n\n1639 Between them they will kill the conjurer.\n\nADRIANA\n\n1640 Peace, fool.

In the street I met him,\n\n1689 And in his company that gentleman.\n\n⌜He points to Second Merchant.⌝\n\n1690 There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down\n\n1691 That I this day of him received the chain,\n\n1692 235 Which, God He knows, I saw not; for the which\n\n1693 He did arrest me with an officer.\n\n1694 I did obey and sent my peasant home\n\n1695 For certain ducats. He with none returned.\n\n1696 Then fairly I bespoke the officer\n\n1697 240 To go in person with me to my house.\n\n1698 By th’ way we met\n\n1699 My wife, her sister, and a rabble more\n\n1700 Of vile confederates. Along with them\n\n1701 They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced\n\n1702 245 villain,\n\n1703 A mere anatomy, a mountebank,\n\n1704 A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,\n\n1705 A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,\n\n1706 A living dead man. This pernicious slave,\n\n1707 250 Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\n\n1708 And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\n\n1709 And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,\n\n1710 Cries out I was possessed.
