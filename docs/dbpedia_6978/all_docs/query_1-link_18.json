        "text": "In the abundant landscape of comedians, Sierra Katow emerges as a versatile, petite powerhouse with her debut special, “Funt,” a spectacular display of wit, charm, and unabashed self-deprecation. From the moment she steps onto the stage, standing tall at a whopping 5 foot 1, Katow commands our attention with a mischievous grin that outshines her neon yellow top. But don’t be fooled by her diminutive stature; Katow is no flashy comic reliant on gimmicks or trending topics, nor is she a wannabe philosopher obsessed with highbrow metacommentary.\n\n“Funt” is simply an hour of comedy that’s easy to watch, at times exploring life through the lens of an Asian American woman (and the importance of flat-ass representation) without feeling like it’s only for a niche audience. Katow dives into a myriad of topics, from the absurdity of persuasive abortion ads to the awkwardness of being hit on by teenage boys (yes, she’s still got it). Each playful anecdote is a gem, delivered with a punchline that lands like a well-aimed dart.\n\nFearless authenticity\n\nBut what sets Katow apart is her ability to blend her cheeky authenticity with a casual relatability. As she pokes fun at herself for her career choices (did you know her “backup” is a computer science degree from Harvard University?), she invites us to sit back and relax alongside her family in the crowd. I was equally impressed and shocked by her fearlessness in talking about her handjob abilities and on-screen nudity, bracing myself when the cameras cut to her parent’s reaction only to find them shaking their heads with laughter. A career in stand-up comedy is unequivocally rare, particularly amongst Asian American families who often feel pressured to uphold the model minority image.\n\n“They had a full front row to all the shenanigans,” Katow laughs. “When I started, I was 16 and didn’t have a driver’s license, living under their roof. Open mics were like my extracurricular thing that they would come and see, like my basketball games. Especially at the beginning, they saw almost every show.”\n\nKatow’s talent extends far beyond the stage. From writing for hit TV shows like “Close Enough” and “Earth to Ned” to gracing the screen in “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” she’s proven herself to be a versatile force in the entertainment industry.\n\n“I was really interested in all of it. When I learned [TV writing] was a job, I was interested in that lifestyle too. In stand-up, you’re on the road a lot. Touring is amazing at a certain level, but until you get to that high point in your career … It is very difficult. I also like to be in one place and really build relationships with my coworkers,” Katow reflects. “[Writing, stand-up, acting,] they all just kind of feed into each other.”\n\nDespite her impressive and diverse resume, Katow remains refreshingly down-to-earth. She gleefully riffs on her “training bra” phase of life, endlessly scrolling through mean comments and having a “comedy bod.”\n\nRelatable humor key to connection\n\nHer charisma and laid-back cadence are central to her connection to the audience. Katow effortlessly draws us into her world with every quotidian observation, like feeling inferior to Shiba Inu influencers on Instagram because seriously, why is a dog living a better life than me? It’s no wonder she’s been able to weather the storms of showbiz with grace and well-practiced nonchalance, proving that sometimes the best punchline is just being yourself.\n\n“It’s a great way to really evaluate [myself],” Katow explains. “At the same time, I’ve been through the battles of self-loathing because you’re reviewing yourself so much … It can be unhealthy. [Sometimes] I need to just let go or find the grace. Over time, it’s helped feed into my own life, growing up and gaining more confidence.”\n\nNo stranger to online criticism, Katow has learned to navigate the choppy waters of internet hate.\n\n“I remember when I was younger, and YouTube was the [only] way to get your videos online. I would read a lot of the comments and sometimes it would be pretty negative. There’s obviously always going to be just malicious people, especially for people of color, or women, or queer people, there’s always going to be hatefulness,” she muses. “Learning to ignore the online stuff … what is actually something worth evaluating … and trying to move on in a peaceful way.”\n\nMore room means more stories\n\nIn “Funt,” Katow humorously addresses the topic of representation in comedy, recounting a conversation with a male comic, identified by first name only, about the pressure she may feel due to the perceived scarcity of space for Asian Americans in the industry. After all, how many Jimmys are there with their own late-night talk show?\n\nYet, the current abundance of talented Asian American comedians, writers, and entertainers only serves to showcase our community’s exponential growth and potential. Whether it’s Katow opening for Joe Wong this summer at “Netflix Is a Joke” or Ali Wong directing Sheng Wang’s latest comedy special “Sweet and Juicy,” we are undeniably in a favorable era with plenty of room.\n\nRegarding the intersection of women and Asian Americans in entertainment, Katow remains highly optimistic.\n\n“It’s so exciting! So many more stories, not even just comedy [are coming forward]. It’s cool to see that the audience has also become more involved, [Asian American content, Youtube, and Hollywood] audiences have merged a little bit and voices are being heard more … You get the benefit of people having more of a say, more power and focus. It’s really awesome to see.”\n\nEntertainment is a powerful medium that can move the needle on social issues and shape minds, and fortunately now, more than ever, there is more space being made for more voices.\n\n“It’s a risky career, but it seems like everything is now,” Katow admits. “It sounds cliche but it’s true, if you’re going into this industry, everybody has to believe in themselves … You have to fight to get seen.”\n\nSierra Katow’s “Funt” is a joyous experience that feels familiar, like laughing with a friend over brunch. With her razor-sharp wit and infectious charm, Katow reminds us that “Funt” is just one example of her illustrious and versatile career. So do yourself a favor and grab a front-row seat to the hilarity; you won’t regret it.\n\nWatch “Funt” on Amazon Prime, follow her on Instagram @sierrakatow, or check out her podcast “Top Chef Fantasy League.”\n\nCover: Still of Sierra Katow by Eliot Xavier, Image courtesy of Comedy Dynamics"
