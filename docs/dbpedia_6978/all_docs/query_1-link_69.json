        "text": "Tired of being invisible and overlooked at team meetings? Shock and awe with a deimatic display that would make a frilled-neck lizard proud. Stare unblinkingly until your co-workers finally listen to you.\n\nEmbrace your inner vulture to become the ultimate scavenger of catered meeting leftovers. Train your senses to smell cold cuts from twenty workstations away. Then, slowly circle your co-workers at the lunch table, waiting for an opportunity to swoop in and grab their half-eaten tuna fish sandwich.\n\nAre you unfairly assigned office housework that’s outside the scope of your job? When you hear the boss squawking for someone to order a team lunch or plan a party, disappear into your surroundings.\n\nClaim your cubicle by sprinkling it with the dusty remnants of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. The pungent, moldy odor of your favorite snack will deter trespassers. If Fred from accounting tries to steal your TI-84 graphing calculator again, he will be caught red-handed.\n\nAre your coworkers overstaying their welcome in the conference room that you reserved? With the grace of a gazelle, leap in the air repeatedly to intimidate colleagues so they’ll scatter. No one will dare challenge your Big Kick Energy.\n\nBe warned, a new teammate may swagger in and steal your thunder. Prove you’re the alpha chimp by air squatting for hours on end; you don’t need a chair to do that spreadsheet! Your booming keystrokes will command respect.\n\nIf your manager grabs you to work overtime on a Friday, create a diversion. Just as a gecko sheds its tail to distract predators, release whatever you have at hand — a quarterly report, your coffee mug, a prized lanyard — into the air and quickly scurry away.\n\nWhen HR approaches to discuss your animalistic behavior, flop to the ground and play possum. Hope that they empathize and grant you medical leave."
