        "text": "There are star-studded movies, and then there’s Mona Lisa Smile. The 2003 drama about a Wellesley College art history professor in 1953 and her crop of bright, complicated young students featured Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Ginnifer Goodwin, among others, composing (in our opinion, at least) one of the most exciting casts of the 2000s. But if it’s been a while since you last saw this talented group on-screen (or if you’ve never seen the movie at all), it’s the perfect time to give Mona Lisa Smile a watch, as this month marks the beloved film’s 20th anniversary.\n\nSure, Mona Lisa Smile may not have been a massive blockbuster or earned the best reviews from critics upon its release two decades ago. But in the time since, the movie has earned legions of fans for its inspiring story, gorgeous costumes, stellar soundtrack, and of course, that amazing cast. Want a refresher? Stream the film on Hulu, and check out our roundup of behind-the-scenes trivia about Mona Lisa Smile below that will make the viewing experience even more special.\n\nChloë Sevigny and Melanie Lynskey Almost Starred\n\nThere’s no question that everyone from Julia Roberts to Marcia Gay Harden is perfectly cast in Mona Lisa Smile. But the ensemble might’ve looked a lot different if two well-known actresses had been chosen for the roles they auditioned for. Chloë Sevigny, then coming off an Oscar nomination for Boys Don’t Cry, reportedly tried out for the free-spirited Giselle (the role eventually played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) and told El Pais earlier this year that she regrets not getting the part. Meanwhile, Yellowjackets star Melanie Lynskey unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of serious Connie (which would go to Ginnifer Goodwin), before director Mike Newell suggested she audition for Giselle instead. Although Lynskey didn’t get the part, she told The Independent this year that she’s grateful for the opportunity because it allowed her to show a different side of herself than she’d previously depicted on camera.\n\nAnd Future Stars of The Bear and American Horror Story Had Bit Parts\n\nIn addition to all the already-big-name actors who appeared in Mona Lisa Smile, a number of then-little-known future stars had blink-and-you-miss-it roles in the film. Krysten Ritter and Lily Rabe, who’d go on to star in Jessica Jones and American Horror Story, respectively, both played art history students, while Ebon Moss-Bachrach of The Bear had a more sizable part as Connie’s boyfriend.\n\nTori Amos Played the Wedding Singer\n\nAt the wedding of Betty (Kirsten Dunst) and Spencer (Jordan Bridges), a wedding singer entertains the guests with big-band hits — and if you were wondering why she sounds so good, it’s because she was played by none other than Tori Amos. The acclaimed singer-songwriter took on her first acting gig for this movie, and you can watch her regale the crowd here.\n\nJulia Roberts Earned More Money for Her Role Than Any Other Actress Previously\n\nBy 2003, it was no secret that Julia Roberts could command a screen like no one else. So, it was only fitting that she was paid a whopping $25 million for her role as Professor Katherine Watson, which was the highest salary ever paid to an actress for a role in a movie. That record has been broken since by stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina Jolie, but at the time, it was a groundbreaking achievement for women in film.\n\nAnd Roberts’ Then-New Husband Helped Direct Her Love Scenes\n\nWhen Roberts began filming Mona Lisa Smile, she’d been married to filmmaker Daniel Moder for only a few months — which understandably made it a bit awkward when Moder, the second-unit director of photography on the film, had to help film her sex scenes with Dominic West (who played Italian professor Bill Dunbar). Roberts told Oprah in a 2003 interview that having Moder on set made her “really, really nervous,” while West put it more bluntly in a 2008 chat with The Guardian: “You can’t really relax in a sex scene when the husband is staring right at you.”\n\nThe Cast Went to Finishing School to Prep for the Movie\n\nTo prepare for their roles as refined, educated young women of the 1950s, some of Mona Lisa Smile’s younger cast members took elocution lessons and dialect coaching, in addition to going to an actual finishing school. Maggie Gyllenhaal told Entertainment Weekly in 2002 that she, Dunst, and Stiles (then all in their early 20s) were readying for a two-week stint at a Manhattan etiquette school, saying that “you learn to fox-trot and put your napkin on your lap” and that “it sounds like fun.” Gyllenhaal added that Julia Roberts wasn’t joining them, though, as she’d “already finished” her own (presumably real-life) training.\n\nJulia Roberts Was Intimidated by Julia Stiles\n\nAlthough Julia Stiles was only 22 when she filmed her role as Joan in Mona Lisa Smile, she came with an impressive résumé (including 10 Things I Hate About You) and a scene-stealing presence that impressed even superstar Roberts. “I find her slightly intimidating,” Roberts said about her co-star in a 2003 interview with IGN, adding that she found Stiles to be “remarkable” and “breathtaking.” Not the worst feedback to get from an Oscar winner!\n\nTopher Grace Had to Take Lessons to Dance With Roberts\n\nTopher Grace, who played Joan’s fiancé Tommy, has a scene in the film where he dances with Roberts’ Katherine — requiring both actors to take ballroom dancing lessons. In a 2022 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Grace revealed that he was “so scared” of messing up in front of Roberts and ended up stepping on her toes a few times during class. Thankfully, the actress was “very cool” about his mistakes, and Grace ended up getting good enough to convincingly ballroom dance with Roberts across the floor.\n\nRoberts Taught the Cast How to Knit\n\nIn a 2016 career retrospective with HuffPost, Stiles shared that Roberts taught the cast of Mona Lisa Smile how to knit during filming. “In these lecture halls [at Wellesley] in between takes, everyone was taking out knitting needles,” recalled Stiles, adding, “She’s obviously very influential. I was terrible at knitting. It did not stick with me.”\n\nThe Movie Garnered Major Backlash From Wellesley College\n\nWhile Mona Lisa Smile’s depiction of a quaint liberal arts college stuck in its traditional ways may make for a good story, it’s not exactly reality. Many students and faculty at the real Wellesley College took issue with the movie after its release, accusing it of being historically inaccurate and giving the school a bad name. Actual Wellesley students of the ’50s, they said, wore jeans rather than aprons, felt free to pursue their interests, and were far less conservative than the film implied. As The New York Times reported in 2003, Mona Lisa Smile’s release garnered “sheer embarrassment” from those who knew Wellesley was far less stifling than the movie portrayed.\n\nWellesley Even Had to Issue an Apology to Students\n\nThe backlash to the film’s version of Wellesley was so strong that a few months after its release, the college’s then-president wrote a letter to alumni addressing their concerns and apologizing for the situation. “The movie is unlikely to do us any lasting damage, whatever we may think of it. I do very much regret, however, the distress it has caused many alumnae, and especially alumnae who were students in the Fifties,” Diana Chapman Walsh wrote. Yeesh.\n\nBut the Movie Still Hit Home With Viewers\n\nDespite the controversy (or perhaps because of it), Mona Lisa Smile was a solid box office success, earning $141 million worldwide over the course of its run. Twenty years later, the movie is still striking a chord with new and old viewers alike drawn to its timeless themes of empowerment, sisterhood, and mentorship — not to mention that killer cast.\n\nRachel Simon is a writer with work in The New York Times, Glamour, NBC News, Marie Claire, and many other outlets.
