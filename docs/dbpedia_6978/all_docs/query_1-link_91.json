        "text": "When the United States went into lockdown in the spring of 2020, Sydnee Washington joined millions of others in panicking. “I thought: I don’t cook, I don’t clean, and I’m not married,” said the New York-based comedian and podcaster. “I don’t know how I’m going to survive this pandemic when all the things you need to do, I don’t do.”\n\nBeyond her personal life being turned upside down, Washington’s professional life was also affected. She’s a standup comedian who feels most at home in a club, on a stage. “I don’t do TikTok, I can’t cut stuff up,” she said. “I respect it, but that ain’t me.” But just like restaurants all over the country swapped out menus for QR codes, Washington adapted.\n\nShortly after lockdown, she grativated to the social platform that felt most like a stage, Instagram Live, where she launched “Syd Can Cook” — a series broadcasted from her kitchen, in which she invited friends and fellow comedians to poke fun at the personal ineptitude that sent her into spiraling in the first place. (In one live stream, comedian Mitra Jouhari coaches Washington on how to make strawberry shortcake for her birthday; 20 minutes in, she’s only cut the strawberries.) Many episodes were viewed over 15,000 times. Before Washington retired the series in February, she said she received countless DMs from strangers telling her it made them look forward to Sundays.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThroughout 2020, comedy shifted wholly online. Many professional comedians, like Washington, did interactive live streams on Instagram Live while others made short videos for TikTok or Twitter. There were no shortage of ticketed comedy shows held over Zoom, and there were full comedy specials posted to YouTube, like Cole Escola’s one actor, ten-plus character show, “Help! I’m Stuck.” The hour-long show, which the Search Party actor has performed in clubs and theaters since 2017, was adapted for the pandemic era, filmed entirely in their apartment, and lauded as “perfect comedy for quarantine.” The YouTube comments show a fascination and appreciation with the manic, unsettled tone Escola projects through their skits. One asks, “Why am I laughing at your clear pain and suffering between the sketches?”\n\nWhile comedy took on new and diverse forms through lockdown, a lot of the content shared similar DNA: coping with a crippling global pandemic.\n\nThree of the funniest people we know to talk about escaping Hollywood and post-COVID comedy.\n\nPeter McGraw is a cognitive scientist, author, and expert on the psychology of humor. He says that much of humor can be explained by what he calls the benign violation theory, which states, “We laugh at things that are wrong yet okay, things that don’t make sense but make sense, things that are threatening but safe — what we call benign violations.” Washington’s bits about her cooking failures fall into a category McGraw calls “humorous complaining,” a form of the benign violation theory that explains many of the pandemic’s viral jokes. It was much easier and more comforting to hear jokes about being a bad cook than to take a FaceTime from a friend in tears worried that the grocery store would run out of food.\n\nThe benign violation theory explains why so many seemed to enjoy watching queer comics making light of specific aspects of daily pandemic life, like isolating and working from home; they were framing a collectively draining and anxiety-inducing experience as something harmless and funny.\n\nGiven the reopening of many venues throughout the summer, I wondered if a year spent off stage would change how comedians approached comedy and also if lockdown affected how audiences perceived it. Were we so ready to laugh again that we’d laugh at anything?\n\nLast Friday, Escola and Washington joined nine other performers at Fagchella, a comedy festival held outdoors at 3 Dollar Bill, a queer nightclub in East Williamsburg. Throughout the evening, hosts Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp, who at one point donned crop-tops inspired by Beyoncé’s 2018 Coachella performance, continually made references to the annual music fest in between sets. In one bit, they brought an audience member on stage for a game where they played an audio clip and asked if it was Coachella’s first solo female headliner, Björk, or a goat; it was surprisingly difficult.\n\nNick Laughlin, who produced Fagchella, said the initial goal was to sell 100 tickets and list 50 people. The first release of 300 tickets sold out in less than five minutes, and another 200 were gone in less than one minute. Laughlin was shocked. “I started to get all these complaints about the ticket link not working, and I thought there was a problem with 3DB’s new website.” Clearly, the appetite for queer humor hadn’t waned during quarantine.\n\nOn the hot and humid August night, the Fagchella crowd was warmed up by go-go dancers and a juggler tossing hot pink dildos in the air. Washington was second to take the stage. Her act was among the most traditional, in that there was no song or dance and limited interaction with the audience. She was also one of the only acts to explicitly reference the pandemic, which she did when comparing the state of her apartment to those on the A&E show Hoarders. She quipped that, on the reality series, everyone always answers the door in shock that the crew is there for them, while she would answer in full makeup, “Did I book?”\n\nThe rest of the evening was more experimental. Escola, after a couple of bits, closed out their act by throwing all of their energy into a performance of “Rose's Turn” and “Everything's Coming Up Roses” from the 1959 musical Gypsy in full. Several folks in the front gave Escola a standing ovation. River Ramirez opened their act by impersonating an older, homophobic woman looking for her gay son in the audience. After concluding the bit that got only a few laughs, they thanked the audience for letting them get out some anger by impersonating their ex’s mom. Everyone cheered.\n\nLater, Sam Taggart performed two original songs, including one about “randos” crashing a Fire Island share. His singing was accompanied by frenetic dancing that sometimes made it difficult to make out the lyrics. While it didn’t get many laughs, it was met with rapturous applause. Overall, the Fagchella audience seemed down for anything and supportive of comedians for taking risks and expanding past traditional standup and the pandemic-related humor that has dominated the internet for the last year.\n\nRB Butcher, a comedian who is currently appearing on the TV series Good Trouble, spoke profoundly about how the pandemic has changed their relationship to comedy and how material is delivered and perceived. “Even if I’m not getting the explosive reaction that I want, we have all been through and continue to go through this global experience together, and so I feel like my job is less about results and more about experience,” they said.\n\nThey describe a pre-pandemic era where audiences were less forgiving and comedians were harsher on themselves. “If you’d go to a show and hear a comic get into a serious subject and it didn’t go the way they wanted, the throw away line if you missed the bit you just did was, ‘Thanks for coming to my TED talk!’ And I feel like that’s out the window now,” Butcher explains. “I don’t care. If I’m on stage saying what I want to say, saying it how I want to say it, there is no bombing. There is no, ‘They didn’t like it.’ That’s a freedom I got out of the pandemic.”\n\nWashington echoes Butcher’s sentiments. After a very serious year, she’s taking things less seriously. “The pandemic made me realize that you just have to have fun. [Developing your act] shouldn’t be like studying for the bar.”\n\nLooking at Fagchella as a microcosm, audiences are ready to embrace the weird, the wild, and even a year and a half into it, they appreciate a good pandemic joke. Washington says before last year, “People were like, ‘You have to prove to me that you’re funny,’ but now it’s like, ‘I’m out, I’m being entertained, I should be more thankful.’” McGraw says that cognitive psychology supports this. “People who can laugh in the face of tragedy are easier to rally around and support.”\n\nThat seems especially true when it comes to queer audiences. Butcher described his first live show post-lockdown in June, which he performed for a queer audience in Washington D.C. “I had all these ideas in my head about how loud it was going to be, but the reality was everyone was still pretty scared and asking themselves, ‘Is this OK?’ It gave me the opportunity to slow down and really connect with the audience. It was very fun and joyful. It was a collaboration; I was in a conversation with the audience and that grew over the four shows I performed that weekend.”\n\nNick Laughin spoke to that same sense of connection between the audience at Fagchella. “I’ve been to a lot of straight comedy shows, and the queer community is so much more supportive,” he says. “There’s something so beautiful about everyone in their seats showing up for everyone on the stage.”\n\nHe’s already thinking about the next one. “We want to do Fagchella every year.” If the state of queer comedy is any indication, they’re going to need an even bigger venue.\n\nGet the best of what’s queer.
