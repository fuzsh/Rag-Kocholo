        "text": "ANGELO\n\n'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have. Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.— Signior Antipholus, I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble, And not without some scandal to yourself, With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain, which now you wear so openly. Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, You have done wrong to this my honest friend, Who, but for staying on our controversy, Had hoisted sail and put to sea today. This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?\n\nANGELO\n\nThat's him. He's wearing the same chain around his neck that he swore he didn't have, the villain. Good sir, come close to me. I'll speak to him.\n\n[To Antipholus of Syracuse] Antipholus, sir, I'm dumbfounded that you would put me to all this shame and trouble, and scandalize yourself in the process, swearing up and down that you didn't have the chain which you're wearing so openly. Besides the cost, the shame, and getting sent to prison, you've done wrong to my honest friend here, who was supposed to set sail today if it weren't for your shenanigans. You got this chain from me. Can you deny it?\n\nABBESS\n\nAnd thereof came it that the man was mad. The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth. It seems his sleeps were hinder’d by thy railing, And therefore comes it that his head is light. Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings. Unquiet meals make ill digestions. Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what’s a fever but a fit of madness? Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls. Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast. The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.\n\nABBESS\n\nAnd that's how the man went mad. The venom of a jealous woman's nagging has more poison in it than a mad dog's tooth. It sounds like he couldn't sleep because of your railing at him, so he went crazy. You say you poured your scoldings on his dinner like meat sauce. Meals accompanied by fighting lead to bad digestion. That's how he got this raging fever, and aren't fevers and fits of madness one and the same? You say all his relaxation time was ruined by your fights. Without time for sweet recreation, what's going to happen but moody and dull melancholy, which leads to grim and comfortless despair, and right after that a whole army of illnesses and humoral imbalances that put his life in danger. Any man or animal would go mad if he was disturbed while he was eating, sporting, and trying to get his much-needed sleep. The consequence is that your jealous fits have cost your husband his sanity.\n\nADRIANA\n\nMay it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband, Whom I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters, this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him, That desp'rately he hurried through the street, With him his bondman, all as mad as he, Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses, bearing thence Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him, And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, Met us again and, madly bent on us, Chased us away, till, raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them, And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\n\nADRIANA\n\nYour Grace, I married my husband Antipholus and gave everything I had to him on your instructions, and, this sad day, he's been overcome by a terrible fit of madness. He ran desperately through the street, with his servant, equally mad, upsetting all the citizens by rushing into their houses, stealing rings, jewels, anything that caught his crazed fancy. I had him tied up and sent home while I went to deal with all the wrongs he'd committed in his fury. I don't know how he then escaped, but he broke away from the men that were guarding him, and he and his mad servant, both of them furiously wielding swords, ran into us again and, charging right at us, chased us away until we found reinforcements and came back to tie them up. Then they fled into this abbey, where we pursued them, and now the Abbess has shut the gates on us and won't let us fetch him out or send him out herself that we can take him away. Therefore, most gracious Duke, command that he brought out of the abbey and taken away for help.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nMy liege, I am advisèd what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman locked me out this day from dinner. That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together. Our dinner done and he not coming thither, I went to seek him. In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman. [points to the SECOND MERCHANT ] There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain, Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home For certain ducats. He with none returned. Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house. By th' way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A living dead man. This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me, Cries out I was possessed. Then all together They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together, Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gained my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nMy lord, I am sure in what I say, neither intoxicated nor mad, provoked with fury, although what's been done to me might make a wiser man go insane. This woman locked me out today from dinner. That goldsmith there, if he wasn't in cahoots with her, could attest to it, since he was with me then. He parted with me to go fetch a chain, promising to bring it to the Porpentine, where I dined with Balthasar. After our dinner, the goldsmith hadn't come yet so I went to seek him. In the street I met him, and he was with this gentleman. [Points to the SECOND MERCHANT] There, this lying goldsmith swore that I took the chain from him, which, God knows, I never saw. With this accusation, he arrested me with an officer. I obeyed and sent my servant home for money. He came back with nothing. Then I calmly told the officer to come with me to my house. On the way, we met my wife, her sister, and a crowd of their vile friends. Along with them they brought someone named Pinch, a hungry, thin villain, a mere skeleton, a quack doctor, a poor magician, and a fortune-teller, a hollow-eyed, gaunt wretch, a living dead man. This awful rascal pretended to be a conjurer, gazed in my eyes, felt my pulse, and, with his thin face looking into mine, cried out I was possessed. Then all together they fell upon me, tied me up, took me away, and in a dark and foul cell at home left me and my servant, tied together, till I'd gnawed the ropes apart with my teeth, gaining my freedom. I immediately ran here to your Grace, whom I plead will deliver justice to me for these deep shames and great indignities.\n\nEGEON\n\nNot know my voice! Oh, time's extremity, have you so damaged and split my poor tongue in seven short years that my only son here doesn't recognize my feeble voice badly singing its woes? Though this wrinkled face of mine is hidden in my white beard and all my veins have frozen, even in my final days, I still have some memory, my wavering eyes can still see a fading glimmer, and my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little. All these old witnesses—they don't deceive me—tell me the you are my son Antipholus.\n\nABBESS\n\nRenownèd duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes, And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction.— Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er deliverèd.— The Duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me. After so long grief, such nativity!\n\nABBESS\n\nGreat duke, will you be so good as to go with us into the abbey and hear all our stories told, along with everyone assembled here that has suffered from the confusions today? Come, keep us company, and we'll figure out everything. Thirty-three years have I been grieving for you, my sons, and till this hour I never found freedom from that pain. The Duke, my husband, my two sons, and you, who share their birthday, come to a celebration, and come with me. After so long a grief, such rebirth!"
