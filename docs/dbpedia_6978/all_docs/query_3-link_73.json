        "text": "DUKE\n\nMake room, and let him stand before our face.— Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act, and then ’tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty, And where thou now exacts the penalty— Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh— Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But—touched with human gentleness and love,— Forgive a moiety of the principal, Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Eno' to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained To offices of tender courtesy. We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\n\nDUKE\n\nMake room, so that he can stand right in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I agree—that you're just putting on a show of such malice until the very last minute, and then you will at last show some mercy and remorse, something maybe even more shocking to see from you than your cruelty. It is widely thought that you will not only forget about the penalty, a pound of this poor merchant's flesh, but will even let some of the money go, touched by human gentleness and love, out of pity for the losses that recently have come to weigh upon Antonio, which were enough to ruin a royal merchant, enough to make even the stone-hearted feel bad for him, enough to make even the stubborn Turks and Tartars, who aren't used to showing any courtesy, take pity on him. We all expect a gentle reply to this from you, Jew.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nI have possessed your grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond. If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom. You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour. Is it answered? What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned? What, are you answered yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig, Some that are mad if they behold a cat, And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, Cannot contain their urine. For affection, Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: As there is no firm reason to be rendered Why he cannot abide a gaping pig; Why he, a harmless necessary cat; Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend, himself being offended— So can I give no reason, nor I will not (More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio), that I follow thus A losing suit against him. Are you answered?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nYour grace, I have told you what my intention is, and I have sworn by the holy Sabbath to take what is owed to me by our legal contract. If you deny me this rightful penalty, it will reflect poorly upon your city and its freedom. I'm sure you're going to ask me why I would choose to have a pound of flesh rather than the three thousand ducats I've been offered. I won't give you any answer other than to say I just feel like it. Is that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it killed? Is that enough of an answer for you? Some men dislike pigs, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can't help but urinate when they hear the bagpipes. People's likes and dislikes are fickle and depend on a person's mood. Now, as for your answer: just as a man who dislikes pigs, or who dislikes a harmless cat, or who can't help but embarrassingly urinate at the sound of bagpipes, has no real reason for this, so I can give no reason, and won't give one (aside from my long-standing hate and loathing for Antonio), for following through on our agreement. Is that enough of an answer for you?\n\nANTONIO\n\n[to BASSANIO] I pray you, think you question with the Jew? You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height. You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb. You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven. You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?— His Jewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you Make no more offers, use no farther means, But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.\n\nANTONIO\n\n[To BASSANIO] Please, are you trying to reason with the Jew? You might as well go stand on the beach and ask the tide not to come in as high as is its custom. You might as well ask the wolf why he makes the ewe cry by eating the lamb. You might as well forbid the mountain pines from swaying with their high tops and tell them to make no noise when gusts of wind blow through them. You might as well do anything impossible as try to soften his Jewish heart—is there anything harder than his heart? Therefore I ask you to make no more offers and use no more strategies to persuade him. Rather, let judgment be passed on me and let the Jew have his way without any more delay.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchased slave, Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules— You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them. Shall I say to you, “Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs! Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands”? You will answer, “The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you. The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought. 'Tis mine and I will have it. If you deny me, fie upon your law— There is no force in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment. Answer, shall I have it?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nWhy should I worry about mercy when I've done nothing wrong? You have among you many purchased slaves that you use horribly like donkeys, dogs, or mules because you bought them. Should I tell you to free them and marry them to your heirs? Why do you make them sweat doing work? Why not let their beds be as soft as yours and let them eat the same fine foods as you? If I said that, you'd tell me that the slaves are yours. I give you the same answer. I have bought the pound of flesh that I demand from him. It is mine and I will have it. If you deny me, your laws mean nothing and there's no power to legal agreements in Venice. What's your opinion of that? Tell me what your response is.\n\nGRATIANO\n\nOh, damn you, you relentless dog! I hope justice comes to you! You almost make me change my mind and agree with Pythagoras that the souls of animals enter the bodies of men. You have the spirit of a dog, of a wolf that was killed for killing a human, but even as it was being killed its soul left its body and entered you while you were in your mother's pregnant belly. Your desires are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.\n\nDUKE\n\nWith all my heart.—Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.— Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter. [reads] “Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that yourmessenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between theJew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o'er many bookstogether. He is furnished with my opinion, which—bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend—comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment tolet him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew soyoung a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.”\n\nDUKE\n\nWith all my heart, I'll let him in. Three or four of you go and courteously bring him here. In the meantime, the court will hear Bellario's letter.\n\n[He reads the letter aloud] \"Your grace should understand that at the time you are reading this I am very sick, but when your messenger came to me I happened to have a young lawyer from Rome visiting. His name is Balthazar. I told him about the controversial case between the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We consulted many law books together. He knows my opinion on the matter, which has been enriched by his own intelligence, which I can't speak of highly enough, and he brings my opinion to you in my place. I beg you, don't let his young age make you underestimate him. I have never seen a young man with so much wisdom. I hope you will welcome him graciously, and you will see how worthy of my recommendation he is.\"\n\nPORTIA\n\nThe quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown. His scepter shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings, But mercy is above this sceptered sway. It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings. It is an attribute to God himself. And earthly power doth then show likest God’s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this— That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\n\nPORTIA\n\nMercy is not something that one is forced to practice. It falls easily like gentle rain from the sky. It is a doubly blessed thing: it blesses both the person showing mercy and the person receiving mercy. Mercy is most admirable in the mightiest men. It looks better on a king than his crown. A king's scepter is a symbol of his earthly power, a source of awe and majesty, which makes people respect and fear him. But mercy is above the power of the scepter. It dwells in the hearts of kings. It is an attribute of God himself. And earthly power resembles God's power when justice is mixed with mercy. Therefore, Jew, although you are seeking justice, consider this: if God sought justice against all of us with no mercy, we would all go to hell. We pray to God for mercy, and that same prayer should teach us all to show mercy to others. This is what I have to say against your desire to seek justice and make the strict court of Venice carry out the merchant's punishment.\n\nBASSANIO\n\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court— Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth.— [to DUKE] And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will.\n\nBASSANIO\n\nYes, here, I have the money for him in the court, even twice the sum. If that is not enough, I will pay ten times the sum of money, or else give up my hands, my head, my heart. If none of this is enough, then Shylock's malice overwhelms his honesty.\n\n[To the DUKE] And I beg you, bend the law to your authority. Violate the law a little to do the right thing, and stop this cruel devil from getting what he wants.\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nYou can tear it up after the debt has been paid. It seems that you are a worthy judge. You know the law. Your interpretation has been correct. I order you by the law, which you must obey, to go on and make judgment. By my soul I swear that nothing anyone can say can change my mind. I am here to get what is owed to me in the contract.\n\nANTONIO\n\nBut little. I am armed and well prepared.— Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well. Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom. It is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty— from which lingering penance Of such misery doth she cut me off. Commend me to your honorable wife. Tell her the process of Antonio’s end. Say how I loved you. Speak me fair in death. And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend, And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.\n\nANTONIO\n\nJust a little. I am ready and well prepared. Give me your hand, Bassanio. Farewell. Don't grieve because I have fallen into this misfortune on your behalf, for even in this situation Fortune has shown herself to be kinder than she usually is. She usually makes a wretched man outlive his wealth, so that when he is old and has a wrinkled brow he looks on his own poverty. She at least cuts me off from this lingering misery. Speak well of me to your honorable wife. Tell her how I met my end. Tell her how I loved you. Speak well of me after I die. And after you tell her, let her be the judge as to whether you have ever had a loving friend. Only regret that you are losing a friend, and know that your friend does not regret paying your debt for you. If the Jew cuts deeply enough, I'll gladly pay the debt with my own heart.\n\nPORTIA\n\nTherefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh. If thou takest more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple— nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\n\nPORTIA\n\nSo get ready to cut off the flesh. Don't shed any blood, and don't cut any more or less than exactly one pound of flesh. If you take more or less than a pound, even if it's just a twentieth lighter or heavier than the tiniest measure—in fact, if the scale is off by so much as a hair—you will be sentenced to death and all your goods will be confiscated.\n\nPORTIA\n\nTarry, Jew. The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods. The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state, And the offender’s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice. In which predicament I say thou stand’st, For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly—and directly too— Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant, and thou hast incurred The danger formerly by me rehearsed. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.\n\nANTONIO\n\nSo please my lord the duke and all the court, To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter. Two things provided more: that for this favor He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift Here in the court, of all he dies possessed, Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.\n\nANTONIO\n\nIf it pleases my lord the Duke and the rest of the court, I am content to give up the half of his goods owed to me, as long as he gives me the other half of his wealth so that I can invest it and, upon his death, give it to the gentleman that recently eloped with his daughter. And I want two more things: that he converts to Christianity, and that he makes a will here in this court in which he leaves everything upon his death to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter."
