        "text": "When prompted (and sometimes not), I love telling folks about one of my favorite movies, I SEE A DARK STRANGER (‘46), released as The Adventuress in America. The little-remembered British flick stars Scottish actress Deborah Kerr as a headstrong Irish lass who grew up hating the British so much that she accidentally ends up a German spy during WWII.\n\nYes, it’s a comedy. And a thriller. And a romance.\n\nYou’d think a British film about a girl filled with such hatred towards the Brits that she works with the Germans against them would be a tad hard to swallow after the war, right? The comic liberty taken with the subject is one reason I’ve always admired I SEE A DARK STRANGER. Upon watching it again recently, I was also rather startled to find how contemporary it is—particularly the fact that the main character, Bridie (Kerr), blindly hates an entire group of people for no legitimate reason.\n\nFilmmaking team Frank Launder (writer/director/producer) and Sidney Gilliat (writer/producer), authors of Alfred Hitchcock’s THE LADY VANISHES (‘38), wrote I SEE A DARK STRANGER near the end of WWII. Filming in Ireland and England took place for several months throughout the latter half of 1945, with the picture debuting in the UK in 1946 and the US in 1947. As Bruce Babington observes in his book Launder and Gilliat, that post-war release allowed the writers to make light of tense subjects despite being less than two years removed from the action. In fact, most reviews domestically and abroad lauded I SEE A DARK STRANGER, and curiously, few English critics voiced an issue with Bridie; most focused instead on the film’s comedic angles.\n\nOne reason for the picture’s positive notices is the precarious balance Launder and Gilliat pulled off, particularly in the film’s tone and Bridie’s character. Jerry Vermilye commented in The Great British Films that the movie “could hardly have emerged the winningly offbeat lark it remains—so cleverly skating the thin ice of Anglo-Irish satire and the seriousness of wartime espionage—without the teamwork of Launder and Gilliat.” The writers maintained an equilibrium between those tense spy segments and the story’s sardonic humor, smartly restraining the seriousness of Bridie’s actions… until she realizes their potential consequences, which keeps her sympathetic.\n\nIndeed, Bridie’s intentions remain squarely anti-British as opposed to pro-Nazi, and the comical bits generally arise from her surroundings and misplaced patriotism. For instance, a particularly entertaining early scene finds Bridie sharing a train compartment with a nice-looking gentleman. Her inner musings of him flow from intrigue to attraction to doubt to hatred when she detects his English surname. Game over, for now, because he just so happens to be her Nazi recruiter. Kerr, top billed for the first time, displays impressive range and command of her role, balancing Bridie’s headstrong naïveté and her youthful impulsiveness with the severity of the events occurring around her. (Kerr won the New York Film Critics Circle Award jointly for this picture and 1947’s BLACK NARCISSUS.) Babington emphasized that Bridie’s “composite of wilful (sic) child and resourceful heroine, winsome sweetness and transgressive boundary crosser” is “essential to the film’s strategies.” It’s hard to believe Launder and Gilliat aimed to generate sympathy for a German spy, easily an objectionable notion for Brits, but Kerr’s candor, unsophisticated charisma and dry humor cause you to root for a happy ending—for her and the British!\n\nOne scene that finds Kerr amusingly oscillating, in this case between brusque anger and inexperienced flirtation, involves British officer David Baynes (Trevor Howard), whom she’s tasked to detain while other spies break a prisoner out of jail. When given her orders, she balks; as a Brit, Baynes is automatically the enemy. It’s a riotous scene watching Bridie try to suppress her aversion as she feebly attempts to keep Baynes occupied with her feminine wiles. How he sticks by her is beyond me!\n\nThat raging, blind hatred Bridie shows feels very relevant today. Her gullibility and baseless revulsion for another ethnicity fuels her actions and ensnarls her in something that she eventually (thankfully) realizes can hurt her own people; in fact, that animosity is the basis for this entire film. And to think: All of it started with misinformation passed down by her father. Without proper education or access to the facts, Bridie almost got herself, and many others, killed. If it weren’t for the clearly satirical slant of her character, Bridie could truly be a terrifying soul.\n\nBut as it goes, Launder and Gilliat took a potentially provocative subject and characters and turned them on their head during a time when many were in desperate need of laughter. If you’re in the mood for a quirky gem filled with witty dialogue and colorful characters, I highly suggest seeking out I SEE A DARK STRANGER."
