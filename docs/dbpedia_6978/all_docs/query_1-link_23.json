        "text": "What do people want from Tyler Perry?\n\nThis post is a transcript of this video.\n\nThe man who has gifted us with the comedy of the year and the fantasy film of the year (fantasy because you have to suspend belief), A Fall from Grace. The man has been a blessing unto all of us because he has gifted us with this comedy we didn’t even realize we wanted and needed in our lives. I mean, also he is a humanitarian. We’re talking about climate change, so he somehow went and found wayward straw in random landfills and made wigs from them. He is a genius! Tyler Perry is a resourceful human being.\n\nWhy should he have a writer’s room full of feedback and good opinions and ideas that are varying and a lot of logic? Why should this man do this? He doesn’t owe us that. I mean yes, he could employ more black people by not being the writer, director, arranger of music, producer, costume designer of his things. Sure, that’s an option. But who needs that? Really, why should he spend the millions of dollars that Netflix gave him to pay other people to do what they’re amazing at? What do we want from Tyler Perry, honestly? We are just asking for too much.\n\nWhy should we want excellence or even slightly good? Why? Everything does not have to be excellent. Even terrible is okay. We’re just asking for too much and we need to stop. Tyler is doing his absolute unbest to make sure that he creates art of whatever lackluster quality that he feels like, and that is his prerogative. We’re asking for too much. Okay?\n\nTyler Perry is a beacon of the black community who has built an empire, which he has. Why should we care if his empire is built creating substandard product? It is not our business and we need to face our front. Why would we want his characters to actually make sense as fully developed human beings? Why should we want somebody who plays an attorney in a movie of his to actually say she went to undergrad, not community college? Because apparently in the fantasy world of Tyler Perry Studios, you can go from community college to law school. Why should we want continuity? Why don’t you want to see a boom mic in a shot? Who needs extras that don’t look into the camera and break the fourth wall or drink air?\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nYou better act sir!! Drink that imaginary water and chew that food that’s not in your mouth ????????????#FallFromGrace\n\nA post shared by Kevon Carter (@kevoncarter) on Jan 18, 2020 at 8:55pm PST\n\nI don’t understand what people are complaining about. Why wouldn’t you shoot a movie in five days? Who has time? Six days? Who has time for that? I need to take the weekend off, and then the weekend after that, and the weeks after that. Why would I use more than five days to shoot a feature film? I think that’s overrated and I don’t see the point of it. Why should wigs ever make sense? Why would I not have a character who looks like he learned from Jermaine Jackson and that hair of tar? Why do hair hats have to make sense?\n\nWhy are we asking for so much of Tyler, this one singular man who has all the money in the world to create really good work? Why should we ask him to not do good stuff? Why should his audience, who he considers low brow, apparently, expect unlazy work? You know what? It’s our fault. It is our fault because we are clearly hyper critical of Tyler Perry. We’re asking this man to create films that show his growth as an artist since he’s been at this for over 20 years. We’re asking him to consider the idea that maybe him being his entire writer’s room is not okay.\n\nWe’re also asking him to maybe consider possibly not showing black women as bitter shrews and black men as cartoon villains, but why? Why should we do that? We’re asking too much of Tyler Perry, you guys. It’s our own fault, because that man has blessed us. He has blessed upon all of us the funniest film that you will see in 2020. I’ll tell you, I laughed so hard because A Fall from Grace was a comedy of errors. SO GOOD. By good, I mean so bad! I don’t even know why we’re complaining. Why are we complaining, when Tyler has blessed us with art of the lowest degree? We should be thankful. We should be grateful. We should just show him gratitude.\n\nDo I recommend you watch A Fall From Grace? Absolutely. You might yell at the screen a couple of times. It’s considered a thriller, but I don’t understand because I already figured out the plot 20 minutes in, but it’s fine. It’s really fun to watch it with somebody who’s also going to laugh with you. It’s also fun to watch it yourself, but you need somebody to be like, did you just see this? It’s a good time.\n\nWe need more joy in these times, with impeachment stuff happening. Why not watch a film that is actually going to make you laugh until you cry? A film that at times, will confuse you with how little it tries to make sense. A film that takes itself so serious in spite of its commitment to nonsensical shenanigans. Bless it. Go watch it and be inspired that you’re being too hard on yourself.\n\nAnd then come back and tell me how many questions you walked away with.\n\nShoutout to everyone who’s currently judging their FB friends who thought “that film” on Netflix was good. Now you can’t trust their taste on anything ever again. ????\n\nBelow are LuvvNation’s thoughts on this film and I have been HOWLING for a whole day over them:\n\nKofo: The BIGGEST question I have is “WHY DID THE LADY GET IN THE SHOWER WITH HER WIG?” sis, we all see that wig on your head, ????\n\nShannon: you can watch it or you can enjoy two hours, but you can’t do both. ????‍♀️\n\nBrenda: chiiiiiiilllle! The hair was terrible! All that money he got, and he couldn’t hire a better wigologist? I mean dayum!\n\nKim H.: I quit watching because of the hair. I didn’t possess that much self discipline.\n\nTawanda: Go back and watch only the first minutes and the last 18 and I promise you won’t feel like you missed a thing..????????‍♀️\n\nLuvvie: Making a film in 5 days means this wasn’t something done with care and purpose. They Jagged Edged a film. “We ain’t getting no younger we might as well film this.”=\n\nJalia: music ???? Meet us up on stage two in that bad wig. Let’s just film this! ????\n\nAlex Lynne: you just made Jagged Edge into a verb and I hatechu ????\n\nAnitra: Tyler looking at all this noise talmbout “challenge accepted!” And fitna release a 24 hour written, practiced, filmed and edited version for Easter. Chile.\n\nLaShelle: It was exactly like those african films in the braid shop ????????\n\nKari W.: The courtroom scene with fade-ins to the lawyer lady shouting general legal phrases. “I object!” “Grounds for dismissal!” “Overruled!” “Leading the witness!”. Better writing could have occured if TP just binged watched a Law and Order marathon with the rest of us. Jesus please be a writer’s room…\n\nChesty: And I wish people would stop acting like we can’t root for TP and employing Black actors while simultaneously laughing at this film. I’m doing both!! ???????????? Mechad Brooks had a flat top. ???????????? I also have to keep remembering that these are stage actors crossing over to film. I still chuckled.\n\nDeVon: I’m definitely doing both. Go TP! Also: sitcho ass down TP! ????????\n\nMeena: The whole thing was upsetting. I’m still mad that I hate watched that damn movie. Also: ???????????? Jane Pittman and Claire Huxtable deserve better!\n\nShemika: I watched so I could participate in the conversation. I have PTSD now.\n\nLaToya: I watched an interview TP did about his lack of writer’s room for his productions. I can only imagine the arguments when he had a writers’ room, which he described as “the worst time in his life.” I assume they wanted to write something good and he fought them on it bc he only has one story to tell over and over.\n\nCrystal: Just because a movie can be made in 5 days doesn’t mean it SHOULD.\n\nAnitra: I’m an Judge Judy, judge Hatchett and Justice Ginsberg on my timeline. The audacity of the whole written in a feverish, night sweaty dream and then filmed and edited and released in less than a fortnight of it all!!! Hmmmph!!\n\nDaniell: And we don’t need the it’s sad black folks can’t support yapping…. Hush we did support! Sat through this wig apocalypse with glee and merriment!\n\nDawn W: This movie was shot last month. It’s like he got the deal from Netflix, forgot about it, then was like, “oh shit!”, made a few quick calls, and shot the film. This screams last minute science project.\n\nAdenike: Yup! When you have until 11:59pm to turn that 12 page paper in that you knew about the first week of class. ????\n\nDeidre: That Bobby Brown Don’t Be Cruel wig was the death of hope.\n\nKristin: I was entertained. But then, I also watch My 600lb Life…soooo I don’t think my vote counts. Also, I was up all night wondering “how in theee entire EFFFF did the deed get notarized??”\n\nIlyce: HOW DID SHE HAVE HIM ON VIDEO GOING TO THE BANK AND FORGING HER NAME AND NOT CALL THE POLICE??? How Sway, how???\n\nTamara: I watch “My 600-LB Life” too and the bathroom scenes and gastric bypass surgeries are better than this film.\n\nDeVon: What year was it supposed to be in that film?? The clothes, hair. Then the late model SUV she was driving. Pick a struggle TP! Our ancestors didn’t die for this ????And why wasn’t she wearing a shower cap over her scarf in the shower scene?\n\nIlyce: I thought that same thing when he walked up to her in the gallery. Like oh, is this in the 80s?\n\nShawanda: I was wondering too. Like why does he look like a member of Cameo. ????\n\nLK: Didn’t I ask the same shit about the year? Is high top fades back in or is this 1993?\n\nPaula: And why was it curly before she got in the shower and straight when she got in??? #sloppy\n\nJocelyn: I just watched it and need to watch Pootie Tang, The Last Dragon, The Blair Witch Project, and Django right now to feel better about life.\n\nIlyce: Can some of y’all be my friends? So many on my friend’s list were cheering this movie. Obviously, my friends list is broken. I’ve never made a movie but I’m certain I could write and produce something better.\n\nDelisa: Why was the wig budget $5.00 tho??\n\nDenise B: Zero dollars and zero cents (sense)! ????????\n\nFranchesca: How can Tyler Perry Studios have a team that produced such a grand gala and another team responsible for such terrible wigs? Make it make sense Mr. Perry. This has to be an intentional on going gag.\n\nHope C.: I knew that movie was gonna be bad for the simple fact the writing was so simple in the first 10 mins. At the art gallery, the woman who introduced him said something very close to “welcome to this museum. I want to introduce the artist who painted all of these paintings…”\n\nMe: ???????????? “WTF?! Like…. DUHH”\n\nJameelah: and the handcuffed man who just slowly stood up and backed away from the car, like he was fading into the background and we wouldn’t see him ????\n\nVanessa: I just need someone to do a super cut of all the movie flubs and upload to YouTube. I’d watch that.\n\nAshley: When she got in the shower, with that wig and AND IT WAS A DIFFERENT WIG THAN THE ONE SHE CAME IN THE HOUSE WITH. I was done. I legit threw a sock at the TV. I’m so sick of Tyler playing these bald head games in our faces!\n\nShantel RM: It was a good “Made for TV movie” circa 1985\n\nJannita: I honestly feel like he made that film to cause us mental and emotional harm.\n\nTamara Nichele: And we inflicted self-harm by watching it.\n\nPhillip B: What you say girl? *Stares at nobody in my writer’s room*\n\nTamara Nichele: It’s a new film genre called “Misogynoir”\n\nRoxanne O.: Someone said TP fans are people who call Harry Potter “devil films” and consider Clinton to be the first black president ????\n\nEbony: Well, now the people who paid to watch CATS on purpose are off the hook for questionable decisions…Sorta\n\nJalia: My mom wanted to show it to my grandma but couldn’t get it to come up.
