Since then, many years of research, journeys to German and U.S. archives, and helping hands of colleagues, friends, and strangers facilitated my original study of Erich Pommer, written in 1989 at the University of Iowa. To them, especially Professors Dudley Andrew, Rudolf Kuenzli, Richard Dyer MacCann, Franklin Miller, and Patrice Petro, the committee members guiding me through the writing of the dissertation, my sincere gratitude. This book in no way resembles my original study, which covered only a portion of Pommer’s career. This is especially true for the biographical aspects I omitted before. Since completing the dissertation, I have been fortunate to have had access to many of Pommer’s personal papers graciously provided by the Pommer family. My gratitude for completing the book therefore goes to Pommer’s son John and his wife Heidi, without whose generosity I could not have written about a life and career as complex and embattled as Pommer’s. Their hospitality toward a stranger from Iowa in the late 1980s and their continued trust and support have given me insight I could not have gained elsewhere. The many conversations and letters between us conveyed to me a personal side of Pommer that guided me throughout the writing process. They were a crucial bridge between the past and the present. My gratitude also goes to Sylvia Robison for conscientiously reading the manuscript. Her language skills and constructive criticism were largely responsible for making the stylistic transition form dissertation to book; to Heide Fehrenbach, who graciously made her book manuscript on postwar Germany under the occupation powers available to me before publication; and to Professor Winfried Lerg of the University of Münster, Germany, who, like no one else, encouraged me to undertake the original study and its publication. I deeply regret that he did not live to see it in print.\n\n0 Prelims.cam\n\n1/21/09\n\n12:22 PM\n\nPage viii\n\nEric Pommer in RKO Studios Office in 1940\n\n00 Intro\n\n1/21/09\n\n11:47 AM\n\nPage 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nB During a show of “This Is Your Life” on American television in 1957, Hollywood star Maureen O’Hara falls to her knees before a wheelchair in which a frail, distinguished-looking man welcomes her embrace and kiss with open arms. “I owe my whole career to Mr. Pommer,” she explains, visibly moved by his surprise visit.1 The man in the wheelchair was Eric Pommer, appearing in public for the last time before retirement. His long career in the film industries of two continents had come to an end. He had known triumph and defeat on the European side of the Atlantic, success and disillusionment on the other. Born Erich Pommer in Hildesheim, Germany, on 20 July 1889, he was one of Germany’s pioneer producers who came to dominate, albeit with interruptions, the film industry of his native country for half a century. As a Jewish émigré after 1933, he fought a valiant battle to establish himself professionally in the United States, which he and his family adopted as home. Between 1907, when he entered the film business in Germany, and 1966, when he died in California, he not only survived the two bloody wars the world’s superpowers fought on various fronts, but he also weathered numerous bloodless yet fierce “wars” that national film industries fought on the international battleground. As a result, Pommer fell victim to intrigues, prejudice, and envy, as much as he triumphed in times of power and glory. 1. Das Cabinet des Erich Pommer: Ein Produzent macht Filmgeschichte.

They first erupted among Germans in the Great War during which the chase for dominance in the Balkans pitted the economic interests of German heavy industry against the propaganda strategies of the German military. Assigned military duty in the region, Pommer soon felt the impact of the heated chauvinism between Germans and Romanians, while the German military outmaneuvered its industrial rivals in 1917 in Berlin with the foundation of Ufa, the first film conglomerate on a large scale in Germany. Far from becoming the propaganda apparatus as was first envisioned, Ufa soon placed itself exclusively at the service of entertainment, thus paving the way for its triumphant march to international recognition during the Weimar Republic. The man who was largely responsible for Ufa’s ascendence was Erich Pommer, creating movies that were recognized as the “highest achievements in international film art” and “worthy of debate in foreign countries.”2 Once recognized as an economic power to be reckoned with internationally, triggered by such artistically acclaimed exports as Caligari, produced by Pommer in 1919, and Madame Dubarry, produced by Paul Davidson the same year, the German film industry was soon drawn into a long-standing trans-Atlantic war over dominance of its market. As production chief and export executive of Ufa, the German film industry’s most powerful representative, Pommer was at the forefront. In the early and mid-1920s his strategy of promoting film art was as groundbreaking for Ufa’s and the German cinema’s international reputation as his policies regulating import and export were crucial for domestic protection. At the height of the German-U.S. film wars, Ufa was on the brink of losing out, partially blaming its financial collapse on production policies “single-handedly” executed by Pommer. The threat of bankruptcy necessitated crippling trade agreements with several major U.S. film companies until total sell-out to the Americans was prevented by the extreme right-wing media czar Alfred Hugenberg. His take-over once again revived the futile contest between propaganda and entertainment, a strife not even Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels was able to settle to his satisfaction. The German-American film war was rekindled in all its intensity immediately after the Second World War, under the Allies’ occupation of Germany. Pommer, as film control officer of the U.S. military 2. “Erich Pommer zurückgetreten,” Film-Kurier, 22 January 1926.

Pommer’s hard-won victory, however, has long since been reversed. As the history of German cinema has shown, the U.S. film industry of fifty years ago hardly needed to engage in such relentless competition. American films followed their own course overseas, determined by such basic commercial laws as supply and demand. The result is that today, in the mid1990s, American films are an inextricable part of German life. As German critic and film director Hans-Christoph Blumenberg assessed Germany’s first hundred years of filmmaking: The German market, in this anniversary year, is more firmly in Hollywood’s grip than ever. The battle which the glorious Ufa in Babelsberg had to lead against the aggressive Californian movie giants as early as the 1920s seems finally to be lost. . . Only about one in every ten movie tickets in Germany is bought for entrance to a German film.3\n\nBut no longer aimed at Germany alone, the film war has escalated to take on the entire European Union. The stakes are much higher now in light of hugely inflated film budgets. With the average production cost in the United States in excess of $50 million per studio picture, few U.S. films are able to recoup their cost from the domestic market alone. For the Americans rescue has to come from the foreign market where, in 1994, theatrical revenues for the first time eclipsed revenues at home.4 The alarming recognition that Hollywood now “supplies some 80 percent of the full-length films and as much as 60 percent of the television films seen in Europe” was a wake-up call for Europe, especially France, prompting rigid counterattacks to strengthen Europe’s own industry while keeping the Americans at bay.5 In light of such international battles, Pommer’s life and career go far beyond the context of Germany’s film industry. Not existing in isolation, this industry was and still is embedded in international 3.

Pommer doubted that many film industry experts recognized how much the cultural, commercial, and political entanglements of nations affected their film industries.6 Though German-born, he was an international film producer, trained through his association with the German, French, American and British film industries. His role as a German producer was developed and always maintained from his perspective of international expertise, and his work for Germany was consistently guided by its film industry’s need to expand and participate in world markets. As Stuart Schulberg, son of U.S. producer B.P. Schulberg of Paramount, remarked in 1953, it seemed that Pommer’s participation as producer in the film industries of four nations had prevented any of these nations from claiming him as its own.7 Given Pommer’s embattled career, it is not surprising that a comprehensive account of his work does not exist. The price he paid was high, especially for his invaluable postwar reconstruction work that gained him more enemies than friends. As German journalist Paul Marcus (Pem) stated: “It is his personal tragedy that Pommer, the prominent representative of the German cinema, [once] went to war against Hollywood, the only rival and competitor, only to return as representative of the American cinema after the collapse of the Third Reich.”8 But such irony alone hardly explains why Pommer, one of the German cinema’s founding fathers and historically its most outstanding producer, was not publicly acknowledged until 1989, the hundredth anniversary of his birth.9 Undoubtedly, Pommer made professional decisions affecting the course of his life and career and, ultimately, his image in German film history. But while personal misjudgment and political prejudice against him were decisive factors, inherent bias in film scholarship resulting in a total disregard for producers has been 6. Letter from E.

Apart from producing Germany’s silent masterpieces, he was – after all – also the first to produce and perfect the German film operetta, Ufa’s entertainment genre par excellence. By also advocating the slick and glamorous “Ufa style,” Pommer generated commercial success for the company, but little to endear himself to film analysts and historians. As a producer, Pommer fostered the most splendid and largest number of German “classic” silent films produced in the “golden twenties.” That fact is undisputed. Compared with his predecessor at Ufa, Paul Davidson, he channeled the company’s art house production (often mistakenly referred to exclusively as “expressionist”) into the more serious and Teutonic mode he had successfully explored and perfected at his companies Decla and DeclaBioscop. One of Pommer’s most creative scriptwriters from the Caligari period, Carl Mayer, explained: Film production in Germany was largely a matter of big-scale historical pictures. [Ernst] Lubitsch was making Anne Boleyn and Dubarry, [Dimitri] Buchowetzki Danton and Peter the Great. Such films were really in the tradition of the Italian spectacle films like Cabiria and Quo Vadis? [Emil] Jannings, [Werner] Krauss, [Conrad] Veidt and Pola Negri were all playing pretentious historical roles. Caligari was something completely new and it is to Pommer’s credit that he backed it.10\n\nPommer’s position at Ufa uniquely situated him between art and commerce, in a film industry backed by substantial private capital, and in a culture abounding with intellectual and creative talent. His artistic judgment and intuition, especially in his choice of, confidence in, and fierce protection of filmmakers such as Ludwig Berger, Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, and Robert Wiene, or in his well calculated acceptance of risky film scripts like Caligari, were coupled with an astute business sense. Such combination of personal and professional attributes enabled him to mediate between the artistic visions and demands of his film directors and writers on the one hand, and the economic caution and business judgments of Ufa’s senior management on the other. Without his exemplary supervision, advocacy, and intervention, films like F.W. Murnau’s Der letzte Mann (The Last Laugh, 1924), Tartüff (The Gilded Hypocrite, 1925), and Faust (1926); Fritz Lang’s Nibelungen (1924) and Metropolis (1925); E.A. Dupont’s Varieté (1924); Carl-Theodor Dreyer’s 10.

That also is an undisputed fact. Pommer’s critically acclaimed films are presented and studied today at educational institutions almost exclusively as the creation of each individual film director, the auteur. Such an auteur approach to film analysis has dominated film studies for decades and has consistently obstructed the exploration of other forces that determined film production – producers, studio histories, and economic conditions. As film scholar Richard Dyer MacCann found, “writers and teachers of motion picture history tend to forget about these strong production bosses when they attribute the art of particular films to particular directors.”11 The flood of research conducted on German cinema, especially on Weimar cinema, conspicuously draws attention to the absence of the man without whom the objects of these studies would most likely not exist. Film historians have written extensively about Weimar Germany’s film directors and most prominent scriptwriters, whose creative influence on filmmaking is more easily discerned. Conversely, no study exists of Paul Davidson, Erich Pommer, David Melamerson, and Seymour Nebenzahl, to name some of the pioneers in German film production. Not surprisingly, Lotte H. Eisner, film critic, historian, and author of a thorough and pioneering study of German silent cinema, The Haunted Screen,12 admitted to me her omission of Pommer’s role, choosing to emphasize film styles and directors.13 And yet, she wrote about Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau, two filmmakers whose careers were generously fostered by Pommer. If film analysis is tantamount to film “art” analysis, and if film art and film industry are seen as mutually exclusive, as film scholar Edward Buscombe contends,14 directors and producers find themselves in conflictingly divided camps. While an artistically acclaimed film director is showered with praise, the producer is thought to be associated with financing and “mere” film manufacturing and is 11.

Aware of the film director’s preeminence even in the 1920s, Pommer allegedly once complained to F.W. Murnau that he was only the prestige film manufacturer (Hersteller), while Murnau was celebrated as a “prestige figure.”15 The role of the producer is difficult to define. As John Baxter so pointedly expressed: On some levels, it means somebody who finds the money and pays the bills. On another, his creative contribution to a film can be as important as that of the director. In general, the two aspects, commercial and artistic, of film production are widely separated, though it was in Hollywood during the Thirties that the techniques of creative production were worked out. There had been producers like this in the European cinema – Erich Pommer, Alexander Korda – but they were rare.16\n\nThe assumption that producers contribute nothing to the artistic but everything to the business side of a movie can certainly not be applied to Pommer. More than any other producer in Weimar Germany, he produced “art films,” thereby providing a strong trump card for Ufa on the international market. He represented characteristics U.S. producer Steven Kovacs considers as absolutely mandatory for his profession, “sufficient respect for the art and craft of filmmaking to do everything in his power to permit the director to achieve his vision.”17 The difficulty, however, lies in the fact that such creative participation in film production can never be accurately determined. When Kovacs discussed the producer’s role in Sight and Sound in 1985, he adroitly entitled his article “What Is a Producer, Anyway?” In light of the myriad tasks involved in production, he explained, “the producer credits differ from all others on a picture.” While other titles – film director, scriptwriter, cinematographer, set designer, to name just a few from the “jungle of titles” in the credits – specifically state the function that each individual performed, this is not the case when titles refer to producers. According to Kovacs: The producers’ responsibilities are so great, however, cover so many areas, extend from the seed of an idea through production to the negotiation of distribution and release of the picture, that no 15.

Producer credits are the trophies left after the battles for possession of the picture have been fought. . . As a result, producer credits are the least precise, most confusing credits that can be found on a picture.18\n\nThis leaves the film historian as detective, hunting for facts that permit insight into conditions that enabled a producer like Pommer, and his teams, to set unprecedented production standards in the German cinema. Unfortunately, neither Pommer nor his peers have left a collection of authentic documents typified by scripts, set and costume design drawings, posters, stills, and budgets; they do not exist for the early industry.19 They created no Cahiers du Cinéma, no film school, and no body of theoretical writings.20 A film historian therefore often relies for clarification on information supplied by those who witnessed the producer at work. “Many of the most stubborn artistic personalities give great credit to the strong executive figures of those days,” Richard Dyer MacCann observed; this statement is assuredly applicable to Pommer.21Pommer’s son, John E. Pommer, who followed his father’s professional footsteps, choosing a career in production, recalls numerous instances in which the creative components of a movie were arrived at by chance, during informal gatherings of film team members at his family’s home (See Appendix A).22 This was especially the case for writing film music, as many of the songs Marlene Dietrich sang in Der blaue Engel (The Blue Angel, 1930), for instance, were composed in the Pommers’ living room. Such a creative contribution arrived at accidentally is hardly reflected in producer credits. Besides, until the late 1920s, producer credits did not exist on German screens, a fact that makes the compilation of a comprehensive filmography of Pommer’s work impossible. Aware of his controversial standing in Germany and in the United States, Pommer refused to leave his own authoritative statement about his career. In California in the 1960s, he collaborated with Siegfried Kyser, son of Ufa scriptwriter Hans Kyser, to 18. Ibid., 91. 19. The beginnings of a film museum can be seen in the Ufa Lehrschau, implemented at Ufa by Hans Traub. The most thorough records allowing insight into film production are the minutes of Ufa’s senior management (Vorstand) meetings, beginning in 1927.

Aware of his inaccurate and inconclusive portrayal in the press and in scholarly writing, he elected to remain silent: The important facts which I could say about myself have already been published, sometimes accurately, but for the most part incorrectly, by those who were well informed and, unfortunately and more often than not, by those who were not. Often these facts have been reported falsely, with or without intention. Seen in this light, my image sways in film history, and that’s how I’d like things to remain. I could correct a lot, and not only in cases where I was unjustly attacked, but also in those where I was undeservedly showered with praise.26\n\nDespite Pommer’s missing autobiographical statement, he created his own persona, his own “biographical legend,” as film scholar David Bordwell called such a biography while writing about Danish film director Carl-Theodor Dreyer.27 “However subjective,” Bordwell contends, “even self-centered, such a legend may appear, that legend has an objective function in a historical situation.”28 An autobiography’s absence, or its intended absence, 23. In 1964, two years before Pommer’s death, Siegfried Kyser, the son of one of Pommer’s scriptwriters at Ufa, Hans Kyser (Faust, 1926), began to prepare a Pommer biography. He compiled an extensive inventory of the content of Pommer’s Nachlaß (his personal papers, photographs, audio cassette tapes, and a list of books and articles with references to Pommer). He also began to tape informal interviews with Pommer conducted in German and English. This material, including the audio cassettes, are part of the Eric Pommer Collection, USC. 24.

Pommer’s own memory, as reflected in interviews and public statements, is both supported, and at times distorted or contradicted, by friends, relatives, film professionals, and the press. This also constitutes and illuminates his legend. By refusing to justify his actions or correct historical falsifications, he willfully allowed this legend to grow and flower. Unlike Siegfried Kracauer whose reactive concern about his legacy caused Theodor W. Adorno to once accuse him “of trying to manipulate his image for posterity,”29 Pommer intentionally elected to abstain from setting the record straight. But this cannot satisfy film historians compelled to find and connect the puzzle pieces, although such a puzzle may never be complete. “Take everything you’ve heard … everything you’ve ever heard … and multiply it about a hundred times – and you still won’t have a picture of John Ford,” actor James Stewart once said of the film director.30 The same is undoubtedly true about Erich Pommer.\n\n29.

This achievement may be denied to other persons, as well as to the same person at a different time. Thus every birth can be imagined as set into play on two wheels of fortune, one governing the allotment of its temperament, and the other ruling its entrance into a sequence. George Kubler, The Shape of Time\n\nThe French Connection: Berlin and Vienna In Berlin’s Wintergarten on 1 November 1895, the German brothers Max and Emil Skladanowsky showed the ﬁrst moving pictures to a paying audience, and the cinema was born. This, of course, is the German claim. Defendable perhaps against the French whose Lumière brothers also presented their invention in the winter of 1895, the German claim most assuredly does not hold up against the Americans whose Thomas Alva Edison beat both Germany and France. Erich Pommer was then a six-year-old schoolboy a few hundred miles away in his native Hildesheim, and so his future career falls into the second generation of ﬁlm producers in Germany. That ﬁrst generation, the Skladanowsky brothers, Oskar Messter, and Paul Davidson, were all born a quarter century before Pommer. While Messter alone is recognized as the “father”\n\n01:01\n\n4/14/10\n\n12:03 PM\n\nPage 12\n\n12 | From Caligari to California\n\nof German cinema today, he shares credit for the technological innovation with the Skladanowskys and other pioneers. By the time Pommer’s career began, Davidson had established a solid reputation as father of the movie palace and owner of Germany’s largest chain of movie houses. Davidson had a keen eye for the international market as well. He ﬁrst imported Asta Nielsen, a mesmerizing actress from Denmark, then collaborated with director Ernst Lubitsch and the captivating Pola Negri from Poland. By the time of Pommer’s ascent to power in Berlin after the First World War, Davidson had become the most artistically savvy entrepreneur in the young German ﬁlm industry. But luck and time were on the younger man’s side, giving Pommer the chance to leave his unique mark on German cinema. In the ﬁrst decade of the century, Berlin quickly became the major center of film activity in Germany, attracting business entrepreneurs and artists from all over the country and beyond its borders. And while other cities in Germany, Munich for instance, also developed ﬁlm productivity, they never equalled the capital in importance: “All attempts in the cinema’s infancy to become active outside Berlin failed or led already existing companies … to move to Berlin.”1 The city of Frankfurt/Main, where Davidson had originally set up his theater company in 1906, fared no better. By 1912 Davidson, too, moved to Berlin. Of all the businessmen settling here around the turn of the century, Oskar Messter was by far the most industrious. A year after the Skladanowsky brothers’ history-making event in the Wintergarten, moving pictures were shown all over Berlin, but Messter was the ﬁrst to install one of these exhibition places with state-of-the art equipment, giving Berlin’s prominent boulevard Unter den Linden a professionally run, permanent movie theater.2 He was also the ﬁrst to produce, as he called it, “acceptable footage” of daily events, working from a production studio on Berlin’s Friedrichstraße which soon became the address of choice for aspiring ﬁlm businesses. A decade later, he founded Messter-Projektion and set up his business on Berlin’s Blücherstraße. If ever the term “ﬁlm factory” (Filmfabrik), as the early ﬁlm businesses were called in Germany, could accurately be applied to a ﬁlm enterprise at the time, it was to Messter’s. He 1.

He was clearly setting the earliest example of combined hardware and software production under one roof.3 Soon other German “ﬁlm factories” came into being. In 1897 Deutsche Bioscop began operation on Berlin’s Chausseestraße and later built important studio facilities in Berlin-Neubabelsberg that would come under Pommer’s control. Duskes Kinematographen and Filmfabrikations-GmbH operated studios in Berlin-Tempelhof. The Deutsche Mutoskop- and Biographgesellschaft, formed in 1898 in conjunction with the American Biograph Company, settled in Berlin-Lankwitz. Heinrich Bolten-Baeckers’s company, the BB-Filmgesellschaft, ﬂourished in the southern part of Berlin and set the ﬁrst example of German-French cooperation when it shared production sites with the French company Gaumont.4 Filmmakers and actors, including Wanda Treumann, Viggo Larsen, Stuart Webbs, and Fern Andra, also operated their own studios in Berlin.5 Such a cluster of companies involved in the various aspects of ﬁlmmaking may paint a deceptively rich and productive picture of an emerging industry well on its way to success. However, German beginnings were modest indeed, measured against the state of ﬁlm production and exhibition in France, Italy, Denmark, or the United States. While the problem was primarily economic, it also had deep-rooted cultural causes. Financial backers in Germany were hesitant to invest in a business that showed no clear sign of potential proﬁt and was snubbed by the upper classes. In its early stages, the movie industry, unlike other German arts, did not bear the mark of bourgeois respectability, an attitude actually still apparent in Germany today. The director of a movie theater from those years recalled: Ridicule was the worst enemy of the movies. It was considered entertainment for the common and the lowest of men. One tended to laugh at the thought that a cinematographic show could be taken 3. Oskar Messter, Mein Weg mit dem Film (Berlin-Schöneberg: Max Hesses Verlag, 1936), 56–58.

He pinpointed his relationship to the movie theater as follows: I am not embarrassed to enter it, but I am embarrassed to emerge from it after the show.6\n\nNo one could assess this ﬁnancial struggle better than entrepreneur and producer Paul Davidson: We all, Mr. Messter and Alfred Duskes, started too small, we – against Pathé and Gaumont. Our banks and our press were much too clever to help us little people get going on the right foot. In the beginning, there was the gigantic ﬂood of foreign ﬁlms. I believe I had the right intuition that we had to go along internationally, or simply die.7\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that ﬁlm production companies from outside Germany, especially France, quickly established representatives or subsidiaries in Berlin, which “was not only the seat of foreign ﬁlm companies, but also – next to its own production studios – the seat of all organizations in the ﬁlm industry that existed at the time.”8 All three main French companies produced or distributed here, eventually under German names, Pathé under “Literaria,” Gaumont under “Deutsche Gaumont-Gesellschaft,” and Eclair under “Deutsche Eclair-Film.” They operated independently in Germany, guided by French business principles and ﬁnanced with French capital.9 Unrestricted by government regulations in prewar Germany, these companies produced at relatively low cost the movies the German market depended on for its growing number of movie theaters. To the public the national origin of a movie was irrelevant; the silent ﬁlm language was universal. By 1911, six Filmfabrikanten constituted the staple of the Berlin film industry: Messter-Projektion, Mutoskop-Biograph (Germany’s oldest company, ﬁnanced by the chocolate factory Hartwig & Vogel), Vitaskop, Continental-Firma, Deutsche BioscopGesellschaft, and Duskes, which later merged with Pathé. 10 Davidson, who added his Frankfurt-based Union-Film (PAGU) a year later, had already made his presence known in the capital by 6.

But until the First World War, German ﬁlm production failed to overcome its small trade image. Even Messter, Germany’s most proliﬁc producer, was as little able to compete with Pathé, Gaumont, and the other foreign companies in Germany (Alberini, Olsen, and Magnussen) as his female star, Henny Porten, was able to compete with Italian and Danish divas.11 The power of these non-German companies is evident in the following ﬁnancial comparison: Pathé lists its capital in 1907 at 6 million francs [$1.16 million], in 1912 at 30 million [$5.78 million]. Gaumont, the second largest French company, shows 2.5 million [$482,000] in 1906, 3 million [$578,400] in 1912. The largest northern production company, Nordisk, shows 2 million Kronen [$535,000] in 1912, the Italian company Cines shows 3.75 million lire [$712,125] the same year. The German company PAGU [Paul Davidson’s Union-Film] shows a capital of 0.25 million marks [$59,475] in 1911, 1 million [$237,900] in 1912, and 2 million [$475,800] in 1917.12\n\nIt was ﬁgures like these that proved to German banks that an investment in the ﬁlm business could potentially be proﬁtable.13 But it was the war with its private and government propaganda efforts that brought profound changes to the organization, productivity, and economics of the ﬁlm industry. Until then, ﬁlm exhibition in Germany had meant, to a large degree, the exhibition of international ﬁlms, many of which were produced in Berlin. Fully 80 percent of the ﬁlms shown in Germany were foreign-made, mainly by French companies, some by American and Italian ones. Some years this ﬁgure rose to 90 percent,14 or even higher.15 And so it is not surprising that Pommer began his long ﬁlm career in the French companies Gaumont and Eclair. When Pommer’s father moved his family, then living in Göttingen, to Berlin in 1905, it was for reasons unrelated to Berlin’s 11.

But the young Pommers, Grete, Erich, and Albert, soon became eager participants in Berlin’s new industry. As an adolescent growing up in a German middle class Jewish family, Erich had at times considered becoming a physician. Such dreams were unrealistic given his attitude toward formal learning and his less than perfect academic record. He failed to obtain the diploma (Abitur) of his secondary school in Göttingen, a necessary qualiﬁcation for university studies. He twice had to repeat a grade and ﬁnally left school for good in 1905, the year his family moved to Berlin. At least in his French class, his lack of motivation was not surprising, for as a friend later reminded Pommer: Our teacher Weselmann, who taught us French, lived across the street from you. Most of the time he came to class in the afternoon with liquor on his breath, sat down in the back of the room, hid behind a newspaper, and announced: “If you turn around, I will have you stay after class.”16\n\nDespite Pommer’s voracious appetite for books, his compulsive interest in the theater, and his curiosity and enthusiasm for the movies, he ﬁrst became an apprentice at Machol & Lewin, a Berlin clothing store specializing in men’s fashions. In that respect, his background parallels that of many prominent U.S. ﬁlm producers with roots in European Jewish family traditions who spent their early years in the clothing business. Pommer’s ﬁlm career began by chance rather than by choice. He was still undecided about professional goals when his sister Grete became a secretary at Gaumont in Berlin in 1906. A year later the eighteen-year-old Pommer was initiated into the ﬁlm business, hired as a salesman by Georges Grasset, Gaumont’s director in Berlin.17 About his initial exposure, Pommer said: It was here that I ﬁrst laid eyes on those boxes holding ﬁlms of 300 meter length. They were then sold to fairground people who showed them while traveling from place to place. I believe I contracted a very special bug at the time, a bug I was never able to get out of my system. Even today, the smell of ﬁlmstrip draws me like a magnet when I ﬁnd myself in editing rooms. That was the reason why medicine lost a candidate and Georges Grasset, director of the 16.

The word ﬁlm hardly existed at the time, at least not in Göttingen. Here we only knew peep booths. . . Entering them gave us a slight shudder because it was not condoned. However, the attraction was too big [to resist].19\n\nPommer had found his professional calling, learning the trade from the bottom up. Throughout his life he insisted that it was neither speciﬁc abilities nor ambition, but pure accident that led to his involvement with the ﬁlm industry.20 He was simply in the right place at the right time, witnessing the unfolding of an industry that established itself internationally from the beginning. Pommer was indeed fortunate to experience what George Kubler calls a “favorable entry.” At Gaumont from 1907 on, he was eager to try his hand at anything the company offered, from acting to ﬁlm projecting, advertising, news editing, and sales. His early sales experiences were often unpleasant but not discouraging. To his customers, many of whom were owners and managers of local fair exhibition booths, neither he nor his product was necessarily welcome: Many fair booth operators were among my customers. It was not difﬁcult to sell movies of 300 meter length, the equivalent of one reel. However, complications started when Gaumont began to produce lengthy dramas, two to four reels long. The innkeepers and booth operators had no interest in such long programs, and there were times during these business trips when I found myself kicked out by some of my customers.21\n\nLearning the hard way, he soon was known at Gaumont as a shrewd young salesman who beat his customers’ ploys to cheat the company out of money. Since it was customary to send, rather than 18. Frank, “30 ans de cinéma.” Translated by Frauke Ramin. 19. Letter from Bremer to E. Pommer. 20. Frank, “30 ans de cinéma.” 21.

Gaumont’s success rate increased dramatically when Pommer decided to deliver ﬁlm reels in person. And his employment enabled him to learn French, which he mastered with a degree of enthusiasm he would have considered impossible during his school years. Most likely he was inﬂuenced by his fellow worker and friend, Erich Morawsky, who had learned French while working in Paris.22 Given the international nature of ﬁlm in Germany at the time, he was surely aware of the advantages that a foreign language like French would bring him; in his ﬁeld it was a necessity. But most importantly for his later career, he was introduced to production when Georges Grasset began making movies. In Grasset, Pommer said, he was fortunate to have found an excellent teacher who quickly made him familiar with all the cinema secrets of the time.23 The modesty of Grasset’s early production attempts is evident in Pommer’s recollections: His wife was the director, and I remember that a professional actor, Lyon de Beret, played in our ﬁrst ﬁlm. The other actors were employees of the house, who played their roles in beautiful costumes and without [receiving] ﬁlm credit. Between two business trips, I often played the part of an angel, but my career as actor did not last long.24\n\nOne of the most valuable experiences of his apprenticeship years at Gaumont was the exposure to company policy. Competition between businesses and nations was the daily menu. When interviewed in 1937, he recalled: “You have to remember that Pathé produced in Paris, the Nordisk company in the Scandinavian countries, the Italians had begun to produce, while Bioscop had just started in Berlin.”25 The national origin of individual companies in Germany seems to have been irrelevant. Each company fought for its own survival, and in this struggle Gaumont fought against both its German and its French competitors. In the ﬁrst decade of the new century, Pommer witnessed both the business 22.

Working in such an internationally competitive climate, Pommer evolved early as an entrepreneur whose perspective was always, by necessity, international. Had he ever written his autobiography, he once said, it would have mirrored the history of the “international ﬁlm.”26 In 1910 Pommer became director of Gaumont’s branch in Vienna, with accountability to Gaumont headquarters in Berlin and responsibility for ﬁlm sales in the entire Austro-Hungarian territory. One year later he was drafted for his compulsory year of military duty. After his discharge as private he could have returned to Gaumont in Vienna, but opted for the director post at Eclair, which planned to establish a branch in Vienna. Pommer’s move seems surprising considering that Eclair was less successful in Berlin than its rivals Pathé and Gaumont. But Eclair had begun to expand in 1908, with distribution outlets in Germany, Austria, and Middle-Europe – even in the United States. In 1911 Eclair had severed ties with an unsatisfactory German agent in Berlin, establishing a subsidiary instead. When Pommer became available in 1912, Eclair had just lost its distribution agent in Vienna and was seeking an opportunity to form an Austrian subsidiary.27 This chance was Pommer, with whom Marcel Vandal, the director and founder of Eclair in Paris, was close friends. Pommer enabled Eclair to build a successful business in Vienna, and Vandal, knowing what to expect of his friend, jumped at this chance when Pommer was eager to leave Gaumont. Vandal also granted Pommer’s wish to report directly to company headquarters in Paris, not to the Berlin branch, as was the case at Gaumont. In addition to establishing Pommer’s direct contact with France, the nation that produced, to his knowledge, the best ﬁlms for the European market, the move to Eclair also assured a close working relationship with his friend Vandal.28 And here his future place in the industry came into clear focus for Pommer: 26.

Rudolph Schulz as head when Marcel Vandal and Charles Jourjon formed a subsidiary in Berlin in 1911. In Vienna Eclair was represented by an agent, Alexander Ortony, until 1912. Vandal and Jourjon formed a subsidiary in Vienna in 1913, with Pommer as head. See Lenk, “Lichtblitze,” Kintop 1. 28.

Vienna was the city from which I conducted the distribution of our movies throughout Middle-Europe. I initiated the construction of ﬁlm studios in Vienna, which are the Sascha Studios today. I created the Eclair Journal and began to produce movies. The “bug” I had caught, escalated and, from then on, I thought of nothing but ﬁlm production, with some very precise ideas.30\n\nAs director of Eclair, Pommer jumped at his ﬁrst chance to produce, aided by Vandal who began to join him for production in Vienna in 1913.31 The result was nine ﬁlms, including a few documentaries, which they released under the company name Wiener Autoren Film, apparently Pommer and Vandal’s production arm of Eclair in Vienna.32 Despite Vandal’s close collaboration, or perhaps precisely because of his presence in Vienna, this company name seems to indicate relative independence from Eclair’s headquarter dictates in Paris. This was especially true for Pommer’s success in securing production assignments from outside the company. Apparently the move from Gaumont to Eclair was paying off, as Pommer was able to create a niche in which he felt free from artistic and commercial constraints.33 As head of Eclair he oversaw the newsreel production of the Eclair Journal, as it was called in Vienna, and at times stood behind the camera himself.34 He also represented Eclair in the Scandinavian countries and the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, extending into Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania where he built up the distribution of Eclair ﬁlms at Volta-Film, Eclair’s Romanian distribution 29. Correct spelling is Jourjon. Together with Marcel Vandal (both of them Paris lawyers) and Ambroise-François Parnaland, he founded Eclair (Société Française des Films et Cinématographes Eclair) in Paris in 1907 with a starting capital of 150,000 francs.

Looking back at his formative prewar years at French companies in Berlin and Vienna, especially at Eclair in Vienna, Pommer concluded during an interview in 1937: The French ﬁlms before the First World War were my most valuable experience, and I will never forget how much I owe to Marcel Vandal. The French cinema was then the only reputable cinema in the world. For everything worthwhile I accomplished in the cinema, I am indebted to the French cinema during my early career.36\n\nBy August 1914, the Central Powers, Germany and AustriaHungary, were at war with France and its Allies, Belgium, Great Britain, Russia, and Serbia. The recently married Pommer was inducted immediately and sent to the French front,37 but the impression he had made during his short involvement in the ﬁlm industry still echoed in the trade press. The German trade journal Lichtbild-Bühne, for instance, published one of his letters from the front in 1914 in which he described the events leading to receiving the Iron Cross, a high military honor for bravery in battle. The journal referred to him as a well-known ﬁgure in Viennese and Berlin ﬁlm circles, who was extraordinarily popular and respected far beyond Eclair’s large circle of business associates and friends.38 Although the war pitted Germany against France, it apparently failed to diminish Pommer’s close ties to Marcel Vandal. He was known to warn his fellow soldiers at the French front not to shoot should they encounter an unusually tall Frenchman: “That one is my friend [Marcel Vandal].”39 The war brought signiﬁcant changes for the ﬁlm industry in Germany. In September 1914, the German police conﬁscated foreign 35. Jacobsen, Erich Pommer, 14. 36. Frank, “30 ans de cinéma.” 37.

He was immediately stationed at the French front line and received the military medal of honor, das Eiserne Kreuz, in October. He is promoted to petty ofﬁcer. He is wounded in 1915, and the bullet which hit him remains lodged in his leg for the remainder of his life.” 38. “Das Eiserne Kreuz,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 24 October 1914. 39.

The French companies in Berlin, Pathé (Literaria), Deutsche Gaumont, and Eclair, the latter by then operating as Deutsche Eclair and managed by Pommer’s British friend Joseph [Joe] Powell, were no longer allowed to function under French capital in Germany.40 Their subsidiaries in Germany and Austria-Hungary were placed under military administration.41 Overnight the German and Austro-Hungarian markets were ofﬁcially cleared of French ﬁlms, although unofﬁcially these measures failed to have the overall effect intended by the German government. Apparently the international intertwinement on the German ﬁlm market was so complete that Gaumont’s and Pathé’s ﬁlms were able to enter via harmless-sounding companies routed through neutral foreign nations.42 Much to the chagrin of German ﬁlm entrepreneurs, the Danish company Nordisk remained unaffected by wartime restrictions. On the whole, the war’s impact on the German ﬁlm business was immense. By temporarily providing a nominal market monopoly, it gave birth to a boom in production. Germany was forced to explore and rely on its own resources: Overnight the foreign ﬁlm industry was eliminated as competitor. A few years earlier this would have meant the end of our cinema because we did not have any notable production of our own. But in 1914, a number of studios had just been completed, especially the very large facilities in Tempelhof. Our young ﬁlm production was about to require effective import regulations, and now the erupted war was much more effective by completely severing the connection with foreign countries. Our ﬁlm production was suddenly facing 40. The 1914 production data in Gerhard Lamprecht’s silent ﬁlm catalogues, for instance, reveal abrupt changes in the latter part of the year. Deutsche Gaumont (also called Targa-Film before WWI) disappears from production records, whereas the BB-Film studios, hitherto used by Gaumont, are now used exclusively by “BBFilm.” The company “Literaria,” actually the production company Pathé, ceases to exist under this name, while the Literaria studios in Berlin-Tempelhof are subsequently used by the newly founded “National-Film” whose ﬁrst ﬁlm features are all, characteristically, army burlesques. French distribution companies are cut off as well. There are no production references to Eclair or Deutsche Eclair, but the company is listed for the ﬁrst time in 1915 under the name “Film-Gesellschaft Holz & Co.” in Berlin. The company’s ﬁrst ﬁlm, Der Glaube siegt (Victory of Faith), is listed with a probable release date of April 1915. Gerhard Lamprecht, Deutsche Stummﬁlme 1903–1931, 11 vols.

No wonder this favorable situation invigorated our ﬁlm production.43\n\nFollowing Pommer’s departure for military duty, Eclair in Vienna was in the hands of Pommer’s deputy Kurt Hubert who was apparently spared military duty. But at stake was Eclair in Berlin, whose British director, Joe Powell, had no chance of remaining in a nation at war with his homeland.44 When he was interned in late 1914, the former colleagues, Pommer and Hubert, became rivals in the struggle to acquire the rights to the conﬁscated Berlin company from its government-appointed administrator.45 Pommer emerged as the successful bidder, aided in his victory by a prewar business association with Fritz Holz, a distributor and owner of movie theaters in Berlin. Holz had contributed ﬁnancially to Eclair’s Berlin subsidiary and was naturally concerned about losing his investment. Holz’s ﬁnancial and Pommer’s professional investment in this company were an advantage, supported by the fact that Pommer was favored, over Hubert, for his patriotic service in the military. They emerged as victors. In February 1915, during Pommer’s absence, the Decla Filmgesellschaft Holz und Co. came into being; the new company name displayed the afﬁnity to Deutsche Eclair whose assets were subsequently transferred to Decla. Holz and Pommer became coowners.46 Pommer’s former friend at Gaumont, Erich Morawsky, since 1913 at Eclair in Berlin, remained with the company, and Pommer’s brother Albert joined as executive. The company occupied the ofﬁces of the former Deutsche Eclair, which continued to exist on paper until its ﬁnal liquidation in 1917.47 The events surrounding the end of the former French subsidiary and the beginning of Decla were conﬁrmed by Pommer’s son as follows: The founding of Decla, as best I know, initially was to preserve the Eclair assets, not to usurp them.

The war seems to have been blamed on England rather than France. My father’s other best friend, Powell, was English. He worked for Eclair and Decla in Berlin and was interned. He remained in Berlin after the war. . . As to Decla, obviously it remained German and the French Eclair had nothing to do with it after 1914. So, the use of the name Deutsche Eclair may have had the purpose of maintaining the goodwill created by the French organization which had been managed by my father.48\n\nUpon Holz’s resignation from Decla in mid-1915, Pommer remained the sole owner, and Hubert, his short-term rival over Eclair in Berlin, became a business associate again, now at Decla.49 The company began its road to fame in its studio facilities in Weißensee outside Berlin, while its chief executive officer was on war duty.50 Pommer’s son believes, that his mother was not the acting CEO but corresponded daily with her husband about company business.51 He is certain, however, that she not only related her husband’s instructions but also gave independent opinions when she thought necessary, and that these opinions 48. Letter from J. Pommer to author, 24 March 1987. With the end of its German and Austrian business ventures, Eclair also ceased commercial ﬁlm production (except the Eclair Journal) in France, renting out its studios at Epinay-sur-Seine, and concentrating on camera equipment and ﬁlm processing instead.

Kurt and Grace Hubert survived the Second World War in Berlin; they committed suicide after she was raped by Russian soldiers during the occupation of Berlin. Letter from J. Pommer to author, 5 April 1995. 50. In his letter to the author of 11 May 1985, J. Pommer explains: “In February 1915 my mother wrote a letter on its [Decla’s] new stationery, which read: ‘DeclaFilm-Gesellschaft, Berlin SW. 48, Friedrichstraße No. 22, Fabrikation [manufacture=production] und Vertrieb [distribution] von Decla-Films und Carl-WilhelmFilms.’ The stationery uses the [plural] term ‘Films’, not ‘Filme’. Carl Wilhelm was a director and possibly also producer.” 51. Letter from J. Pommer to Jacobsen, 9 July 1986. The question of Decla’s management during Pommer’s absence remains unclear. Pommer’s son hypothesizes that Carl Wilhelm, who directed several ﬁlms at Decla, may in effect have been the guiding creative personality in the ﬁrst years. Herbert G. Luft claims that “Mrs. Pommer managed it till the war ended,” in his article, “Erich Pommer: Germany’s Greatest Film Producer Became Such Through Charm and Assiduity,” in Films in Review 10: 8 (October 1959): 459. However, this is unfounded. The closest to support such a claim is a remark in the third business report from Decla to Pommer, 10 August 1915. While discussing censorship difﬁculties of a speciﬁc ﬁlm, Der Herr ohne Wohnung (The Gentleman without an Apartment), the report contains the remark: “Till now no deﬁnitive decision has been reached despite your wife’s special plea (Eingabe). Nevertheless, there is no great chance to free the ﬁlm for Berlin.”\n\n01:01\n\n4/14/10\n\n12:03 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nInternational Beginnings | 25\n\nwere given serious consideration.52 Apparently Pommer had input into his company while away from Berlin; he was well informed through regular business reports. For instance, a report dated 10 August 1915, marked as “report number 3,” discussed personnel issues, the latest films in production, censorship problems, sales in and outside Germany (Austria-Hungary and Romania), the domestic market, and foreign competition.53 By the summer of 1916, Lichtbild-Bühne praised the absent Pommer for his production company’s rapid and successful development and commented favorably on Decla’s new status as distribution company. Following in the footsteps of Pathé, Gaumont, Nordische, and Messter, Decla was now the second German Filmfabrik to begin selling its product directly to theaters, focusing primarily on Berlin and vicinity and eastern Europe.54\n\nThe Balkans For the German government the war created urgent propaganda needs, and it became painfully obvious that Germany had wasted valuable time that had been used wisely for propaganda by the Allies. German efforts to establish efﬁcient and effective propaganda tools were impeded by much more than inexperience in visual propaganda techniques. Political tension between the military and German industries operating in the Balkan and Asia Minor territories for commercial expansion further complicated propaganda. It was here that Germany’s heavy industry of the Rhine-Ruhr area competed heavily with the economic interests of the large ship owners and the chemical and electronics industries, all of which were backed by Germany’s largest bank, the Deutsche Bank.55 It was here also that some of the most powerful and inﬂuential players in the future German ﬁlm industry made their ﬁrst 52.

Klitzsch, the publisher of export magazines and of the Leipziger Illustrirte at the publishing house of J.J. Weber, was astutely aware of international market strategies employed by enemy nations, especially through the exploitation of ﬁlm. He argued repeatedly for intensiﬁed German ﬁlm propaganda. In the spring of 1916, Ludwig Klitzsch suggested to representatives of trade, industry, and transportation a strategy for utilizing ﬁlm to win the sympathies and secure the support of foreign markets. His call to immediate action did not gain ﬁnancial support. But Klitzsch’s ideas coincided with the politically shrewd Hugenberg, chairman of the steel giant Krupp’s board of directors, who authorized him to found and head the Deutsche Lichtbild-Gesellschaft (DLG; Deulig as of 1920). With ﬁnancing now provided by German heavy industry, Klitzsch apparently found at least the modest fulﬁllment of his envisioned centralized, large-scale propaganda institution, hoping that this company might be the future umbrella for all German ﬁlm businesses. But it was inevitable that the ensuing success of the DLG in the Balkans and Asia Minor caught the wrath of Germany’s other industrial capitalists whose ﬁnancial backer, the Deutsche Bank, pursued similar expansion policies in this area. The bank’s director, Emil Georg von Stauß, found unexpected support in his campaign against the DLG in General Ludendorff. Like Klitzsch, Ludendorff envisioned a large-scale propaganda machine in the Reich. While the former’s dreams revolved around the DLG, the latter hoped to realize his plans with the Bild- und Filmamt (Bufa), a still picture and ﬁlm agency established by the military in Berlin in early 1917.56 With a staff of 450, including its own production facilities, it provided a ﬁrst link between the young ﬁlm industry and the military by facilitating and sanctioning eye-witness reportage from the front and film propaganda at home and abroad.57 Both the DLG and Bufa operated in the Balkans, allegedly representing opposing interests – the DLG seeking primarily economic, and Bufa propaganda goals. The combined forces of the Deutsche Bank, Emil Georg von Stauß, and General Ludendorff, 56. H.H. Wollenberg, Fifty Years of German Film (London: The Falcon Press Limited, 1948), 12. 57.

In 1921 the company that was intended as the “national” ﬁlm enterprise for the economic and propaganda needs of all parties involved, was privatized when the Reich withdrew its ﬁnancial share.60 Erich Pommer, too, would play a crucial role at Ufa in the years to come. By the spring of 1916, he had been wounded twice, once on the French, and a second time on the Russian front where he was shot in the leg. He barely escaped death when another bullet pierced the left breast pocket of his uniform but was stopped by a small German-Polish-Russian dictionary and a notebook he carried there.61 After physicians decided against removing the bullet lodged in his leg, he was released from the Berlin hospital in the summer of 1916 and immediately given new assignments. Following several months of training recruits in Berlin, he was assigned to the newly founded Bufa, which quickly utilized experts from the ﬁlm industry. This transfer probably came about 58. Accordingly, two scenarios explaining Ufa’s foundation, developed after WWII, as Jan-Christopher Horak points out in his M.S. thesis on Ernst Lubitsch: “The ﬁrst version, based on ﬁlm histories by Oskar Kalbus, [Hans] Traub, and Siegfried Kracauer, accepted the view that the government initiated the creation of Ufa for propaganda purposes. The second version (appearing in a number of East and West German sources) postulated a theory whereby the Ufa was founded as a result of a corporate power struggle between the reactionary Krupp steel industries and North German banking interests.” Horak, “Ernst Lubitsch and the Rise of Ufa 1917–1922,” M.S. thesis, Boston Univ., 1973, 39. 59. Besides the Danish Nordisk, the German companies were Messter-Film and Union (Pagu). The various production, distribution (domestic and international), and exhibition branches associated with these ﬁrms are too numerous to list here. Messter alone owned Messter-Film, Autor-Film, Hansa-Film Distribution, and one of Berlin’s leading ﬁlm theaters, the Mozartsaal.

But Bufa also distributed ﬁlms in territories that were occupied by Germany, and in the summer of 1917 Pommer was transferred to Romania where he remained a sergeant in the German army (“out of uniform,” as he claims) until he was released from Bufa in November 1918. Romania was known territory to Pommer who had sold ﬁlms there for Gaumont and Eclair during a time of lively ﬁlm exchange before the war.62 But in the year 1915 Romania had ended its alliance with the Central Powers, joined forces with the Allies, and fallen just a few months before Pommer arrived. He was to oversee the ﬁlm sector of the censorship board of the military administration and to supervise the legitimate stage in Bucharest. The latter had been closed by the military, leaving many artists without work or income. When he reopened the theater on 16 July 1917, the singers and actors thanked him enthusiastically with a letter addressed to “the Honorable Erich Pommer, Director of the Balkan-Orient-Film-Gesellschaft.”63 This letter reveals Pommer’s involvement with a ﬁlm company in the Balkans. Apparently the Balkan-Orient-Film-Gesellschaft had been founded in December 1916 as a military outlet to promote German propaganda. In 1917, the DLG took command of Balkan-Orient-Film, thus further aggravating the already existing tension with the German government. If the government had initially accepted the DLG’s inﬂuence in the Balkans, it renounced it in 1917, charging that the DLG did little to further the interests of the German government. Sergeant Erich Pommer, the military’s representative in Romania, it was claimed, was the only one doing good work in the area.64 When Pommer left Romania in late 1918, the Balkan-Orient-Film-Gesellschaft had undergone two name changes, ﬁrst to “Balkan-Orient-Gesellschaft E. Pommer” and subsequently to “Soarele.”65 It is unclear whether the names reﬂected legitimate transfer of ownership to Pommer or a strategy to hide 62. E. Pommer, interviewed by Kadiev and Kyser. 63.

The military nature of Pommer’s assignment in Romania would seem to preclude private ownership. It is more likely that Pommer took it upon himself to save the company in the face of mounting hostility toward the occupying Germans, by arranging a ﬁctitious sale to a Romanian citizen. 66 The correspondence between Pommer and his appointed trustee of Soarele reﬂects the enormous difﬁculties that arose through repeated and vindictive political pursuit of Soarele following the retreat of the German troops from Romania. German ﬁlm distribution came to a halt, exhibition in Soarele’s own and rented movie theaters was prohibited, and the company’s ﬁlms were conﬁscated. Soarele was black-listed and business came to a standstill.67 Pommer’s success in Romania backﬁred. Since the exhibition and distribution of German ﬁlms ran smoothly, especially in Bucharest, Pommer’s company was pursued more heavily than others that had also been founded and managed with German funds: This pursuit was especially aimed at Soarele because it was not only considered an economic enterprise of the Germans, but – to a much larger extent – a political organ. All ﬁlm theater owners in competition [with Soarele] applied any available method to be reimbursed for the fact that they were hindered, and in part ruined, by Pommer’s company. Reports were sent to the Romanian Ministry of War that Pommer had been involved in political propaganda and that he had been an organ of the political Department of the Military in order to assure the effectiveness of his propaganda via ﬁlm. Furthermore, these statements alleged he had proceeded without scruples against all those afﬁliated with ﬁlm and ﬁlm theaters he considered a German enemy. The ﬁnancial strength of Soarele was merely a further incitement to take retaliatory action for all economic damages, even in those cases where Pommer had not been responsible.68\n\nNotwithstanding the complexity of the company ownership issue, the correspondence between Pommer and the Soarele trustee leaves no doubt that Pommer retained tight ﬁnancial control over 66.

In May 1919, Ufa enlisted his judgment for determining the validity of claims brought by various businessmen purporting to own the company.69 In May 1922, with Pommer already at Ufa, Ufa transferred all Soarele rights to a private businessman. Pommer’s involvement in Gaumont, Eclair, Bufa, and BalkanOrient-Film/Soarele laid the groundwork for his career as company head, export specialist, ﬁlm politician, and producer. His ﬁrst decade in the ﬁlm business was characterized by international coexistence and competition, with domestic and international politics at center stage, in peace- and wartime alike. His early experiences should have prepared him for life-long battles in which national ﬁlm industries, the government, the military, and local and world politics would continue to return as principal players. Undaunted by wartime intrigues, Pommer transferred his market strategies to peacetime Berlin, where his inﬂuence and power continued to grow. His assignment in Romania had given Pommer the opportunity for early contacts with the newly founded Ufa company in Berlin, thereby preparing the path for his future career.\n\n69.

His top priority was Decla’s adjustment to postwar market conditions. For a while peacetime gave Germany’s film enterprises a virtual monopoly over the domestic market. This war-induced isolation was soon challenged from outside, this time from the United States rather than France. As Filmfabrikant at the helm of his company, be it as policy maker or head of production,1 he was soon forced to focus on the international market. While the international 1. The reported dates when Pommer was in charge of production at Decla differ. Decla’s set designer Hermann Warm maintains that Pommer was Decla’s production head until mid-1919 when actor/director Rudolf Meinert took over. Pommer resumed this function again in the fall of 1920. See Hermann Warm, “Gegen die\n\n02\n\n1/21/09\n\n11:48 AM\n\nPage 32\n\n32 | From Caligari to California\n\ncompanies coexisting in Berlin before the war had not engaged in overt national chauvinism, postwar competition between German and American companies was at times hostile. German companies saw the opening of Germany’s borders to companies abroad with great apprehension. Aggressive business strategies became the defensive mode involving all branches of the industry from production to distribution and exhibition. The consolidation of smaller companies into powerful business combines (Konzerne) affected Decla as it did the entire German film industry. On the production level, formulas and strategies most conducive to export, and concepts such as “national” and “international” film, had to be defined. On the distribution and exhibition levels, import issues, which the war years had preempted so effectively and conveniently to the advantage of the German Reich, moved to center stage. These issues provided the testing ground on which Pommer’s early experiences in an internationally entwined film industry were to serve him well. He emerged as a prominent industry figure when the confrontation with foreign film industries, especially the Americans, called for action. Peacetime began in Germany with 145 film companies, producing a total of 1,317 films. Some companies produced no more than two films, and others folded quickly. Production data from mid1919 reveal the major postwar players: Ufa, in its first full year in business, outshone all others with a total of 269 films, contributing one-fifth of all films shown in Germany that year. But Ufa, of course, was none other than the various companies it had amassed under its umbrella when it was founded in December 1917. Of these, Messter-Film contributed 75 films, Nordisk-Film 76, Oliver-Film 50, and Union-Film 27. Decla was one of five companies outside the Ufa umbrella producing more than 30 films that year; its share was 33, nine more than the previous year.2 The DLG released 129, EikoFilm 92, Bufa – in its last year of business – 75, and Bioscop 31.3 The latter was to merge with Pommer’s Decla in the following year.

According to Decla’s press release to Lichtbild-Bühne in early December, Pommer succeeded Meinert, who took David Oliver’s place in Decla’s senior management (Vorstand). “Olivers Rücktritt: Die Umgruppierung im Vorstand der Decla-Bioscop,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 4 December 1920.

But whereas Ufa’s amassing of power in 1917 was primarily motivated by wartime propaganda, peacetime expansion was governed by business principles aimed exclusively at competition, prestige, and, ultimately, profit. In 1919 Decla merged with two companies, Meinert-Film and Oliver-Film, after the latter freed itself from the Ufa umbrella. Both company heads, Rudolf Meinert and David Oliver, became Pommer’s coexecutives.

The postwar period was marked by accumulations of large movie theaters despite the fact that a wartime government decree of 15 January 1918 prohibited the erection of luxury buildings. See Lichtbild-Bühne, 11 October 1919. Nevertheless, Ufa relinquished smaller theaters in order to concentrate exclusively on larger buildings. See Lichtbild-Bühne, 1 March 1919. Decla organized its theater acquisition by forming a separate company in August 1919, the Decla-LichtspielGmbH, with a capital of 20,000 marks. See Lichtbild-Bühne, 23 and 30 August 1919. For other Decla theater acquisitions see, among others, “Weitere Theatergründungen der ‘Decla’,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 14 June 1919; “Die ‘Decla’ Lichtspiele,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 4 October 1919; and “Der ständig wachsende Theaterbesitz der ‘Decla’,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 8 November 1919. These real estate transactions continued to take place despite a debate in the Prussian State Assembly (Landesversammlung) that had, in the summer of 1919, upheld the prohibition of using construction material for luxury buildings, under which movie theaters fell. The absence of penalty reinforcement in the past was no doubt due to the recognition that movie theaters were the only places where people could keep warm in winter.

But criticism of unwise business strategies was laid to rest with the conviction that “Direktor Pommer is known as a cautious and reserved businessman who would not engage in excessive expansion politics without a sufficient financial basis.”10 Several business agreements in the city of Hamburg followed, one with the Hagenbeck Zoo and another with the Ethnographical Museum founded by Heinrich Umlauff, a relative of the Hagenbeck family. Both were invaluable resources for production, as the vast zoo terrain offered immense possibilities for outdoor shooting, while the museum made its collection available for historical settings.11 Bioscop, Decla’s future partner, pursued equally aggressive expansion strategies. While Decla expanded into Hamburg, Bioscop merged with the company of producer/director Richard Oswald, who brought in a capital of 30 million marks.12 With its excellent distribution system and a vast theater circuit (Theaterpark) Bioscop would have been comparable to Ufa, were it not for its weaknesses in production, as Lichtbild-Bühne was quick to point out: The potential for marketing foreign films is guaranteed through a large chain of theaters. This will also provide support for production, which is scheduled to be enlarged. It is important how well the new company will succeed in obtaining first-rate films of quality for its distribution system. Ufa and Decla represent a strong market share of quality products. There will be a heated battle over whatever percentage is left.13 8. “Oliver bei Decla,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 31 May 1919. 9. “Kommanditgesellschaft Decla,” Film-Kurier, 30 September 1919. 10. “Der Decla-Konzern: Commandit-Gesellschaft [sic] mit 15 Millionen Kapital,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 27 September 1919. 11. “Die Expansion der ‘Decla’,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 11 October 1919.

Decla was strong in production but lacked Bioscop’s strength in distribution and exhibition. Despite Decla’s business strides, there were still shortcomings. As Pommer admitted openly, the company obviously suffered from the absence of key theaters capable of propagating these kinds of quality films in appropriate and necessary fashion. It also lacked a modern, technically well equipped studio. The Decla studios in Weißensee, which were being used till now, had become too small and outdated.14\n\nBy merging with Bioscop, Decla would obtain access to Bioscop’s forty movie theaters and its gigantic new studio facilities in BerlinNeubabelsberg, which had been modernized as much as postwar conditions would allow.15 But Decla still had one crucial advantage over Bioscop, and this was its company head Pommer. When the trade press speculated on Bioscop’s new chances in the German film industry, it put its finger precisely on Bioscop’s lack of leadership: In the final analysis, the decisive factor depends on who is in charge of business politics at the new company. A gigantic, complex enterprise is not the same as an enterprise which consists of a factory [Fabrik] and distribution alone. A gigantic business of these dimensions demands a generous disposition, a quick decision making capacity, and an almost super-human farsightedness undaunted by the unclear situation of our industry. If the new company has men at its disposal who see the world market clearly and who know how to combine domestic considerations and foreign calculations, it will prosper.16\n\nIn short, Bioscop needed Pommer. In April 1920 Decla and Bioscop merged.17 Richard Oswald pulled his company out of this newly formed Konzern and resumed film production on his own.18\n\n14. Pommer, Eibel-Manuscript. 15.

Pommer took no risks when reorganizing the new company. As seen by the press, “[t]he former [Bioscop] company leadership resigns; almost all their positions will be occupied by Decla representatives, especially by the gentlemen Oliver, E. Pommer, Meinert, Baruch, [and] Saklikower.”20 Commenting on Decla’s foreign distribution department (Auslandsabteilung), Lichtbild-Bühne reported: “It goes without saying that an experienced and competent expert belongs at the top of foreign distribution. This position is, quite fortunately, taken by Erich Pommer.”21 In the final analysis, Pommer’s company, though merged with Bioscop, remained Decla.22 The capital then available to Decla-Bioscop was estimated at 50 million marks.23 Decla had taken such organizational strides that Pommer felt compelled to defend his expansion policy publicly. He turned to the weekly journal Das Tage-Buch to explain “the significance of Konzerne in the film industry” as a necessary safeguard for the entire German cinema and not for the promotion of one single entrepreneur. For the same reason, he explained, he eschewed competition with other German companies in favor of a solid front against foreign competition. Without a strong and united German film industry, he argued, foreign market domination of Germany would be easy. He felt that the massive accumulation of capital in the hands of a few privileged film enterprises or, if need be, one single company, was the most effective way to protect Germany’s interests: 19. “Der Decla-Bioscop-Konzern,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 27 March 1920. The journal proclaims only David Oliver and Erich Pommer as experts (Nur-Fachleute). 20. “Decla-Bioscop-Konzern,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 27 March 1920.

It is not uncommon to find references to Bioscop as the “future Decla,” as in Asta Nielsen’s recollection of her early association with Bioscop. See Renate Seydel and Allan Hagedorff, eds., Asta Nielsen: Ihr Leben in Fotodokumenten, Selbstzeugnissen und zeitgenössischen Betrachtungen (Munich: Universitas, 1981), 38. Fritz Lang, for instance, forgets about Bioscop altogether and speaks of the merger of Decla with Ufa in 1921, in Fritz Lang: Choix de textes établi par Alfred Eibel (Paris: Présence du Cinéma, 1964), 11. 23. “Decla-Bioscop-Konzern,” Lichtbild-Bühne, 27 March 1920.\n\n02\n\n1/21/09\n\n11:48 AM\n\nPage 37\n\nBerlin: Pommer’s Decla | 37\n\nWithout the concentration of German capital, foreign countries would be in a position to arbitrarily govern the entire German film industry. They would be able to flood us with their own products and make our competition impossible. Only farseeing policies have enabled the large German companies today to have a decisive voice in all these issues and to exert pressure on the foreign countries. This should not be underestimated. These countries now face a situation that differs entirely from prewar times. They are now forced to take Germany into account, a consideration they would never have imagined, were it not for Germany’s large companies. If the German film industry today would still consist of only small individual companies, England, America, France, and Italy would, by virtue of their strength, erase these small splinter groups in the German economy … If benevolent, they would purchase the most valuable ones. But in any case, they would force them under their control.24\n\nThus, when Decla-Bioscop resumed transactions in the Balkans, this move toward the east was simply welcomed and justified in the press as “recapturing lost territory.”25 It was an entirely different matter, of course, when foreign nations seeking business in Germany put forth similar claims. The cinema’s short history of a quarter century showed that peacetime tended to create international battlefields for national film industries while wartime produced conditions of relative domestic stability and growth. Inevitably, Germany became an attractive target for international, especially American, film companies. Under the headline, “German-American Film War,” the political weekly journal Die Weltbühne astutely proclaimed that the “German-American peace has been declared and the GermanAmerican film war has begun.”26 Echoing the prewar entanglement in Germany of French, Danish, Italian, and American film companies, Germany’s postwar film industry again erupted in an international “battle,” but a much fiercer one than before. The trade journals reported this economic tug of war in the strongest military language and metaphor. Articles ranged from Germany’s paranoia of drowning in foreign films to self-aggrandizing visions of posing a threat to other countries.
