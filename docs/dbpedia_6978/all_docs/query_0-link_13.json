        "text": "Das Dreimäderlhaus (1918)\n\nThe German silent film Das Dreimäderlhaus/The House of Three Girls (Richard Oswald, 1918) tells with about a love affair of the young composer Franz Schubert in Vienna in 1826 and his attempts to assert himself as a composer. Das Dreimäderlhaus was based on a homonymous operetta, first performed in 1916 and using Schubert's music. The film is now considered as lost.\n\nGerman postcard by Rotophot in the Film Sterne series, no. 536/3. Photo: Richard-Oswald-Film.

The woman could be Sybille Binder, who plays Schubert's love interest Hannerl.\n\nThree love affairs and a misunderstanding\n\nDas Dreimäderlhaus/The House of Three Girls (Richard Oswald, 1918) was based on a homonymous operetta, first performed in 1916 and using Franz Schubert's music. Successful English-language operetta adaptations were made such as 'Chanson d'amour' (1921), 'Blossom Time' (1921) and 'Lilac Time' (1922)\n\nThe story deals with the love affairs of the three daughters of court glassmaker Christian Tschöll with Franz Schubert (Julius Spielmann) and two of his friends. One of them is the painter Moritz von Schwind (Eynor Ingesson).\n\nUnder the lilac tree Tschöll (Wilhelm Diegelmann) agrees to the marriage of his three daughters with the three young men, but while Schubert's friends marry, a misunderstanding prevents marriage between Schubert and Hannerl (Sybille Binder).\n\nSchubert's circle of friends includes also the young Baron Franz von Schober (Conrad Veidt), against whose maneuvers his girlfriend Grisi (Anita Berber) warns Hannerl. Hannerl instead thinks Grisi warns her against Schubert, so she marries Schober instead, and Schubert is left alone.\n\nIn 1958, a new film version was made, Das Dreimäderlhaus (Ernst Marischka, 1958) with Karlheinz Böhm as Franz Schubert\n\nGerman postcard by Rotophot in the Film Sterne series, no. 536/5.

Foto: Ebany.\n\nThe Prince Consort\n\nConrad Nagel was born in 1897 in Keokuk, Iowa, USA as John Conrad Nagel. Conrad was the son of a musician father, Frank Nagel, and a mother, Frances (née Murphy), who was a locally praised singer. Nagel's mother died early in his life, and he always attributed his artistic inclination to growing up in a family environment that encouraged self-expression. His father became dean of the music conservatory at Highland Park College and when Nagel was three, the family moved to Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nAfter graduating from Highland Park College at Des Moines, Nagel left for California to pursue a career in the relatively new medium of motion pictures where he garnered instant attention from the Hollywood studio executives. He made his film debut in Little Women (Harley Knoles, 1918), the second film adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott story. Nagel got favourable reviews for his role as Laurie.\n\nFrom 1918 to 1962, Nagel was also active on Broadway. His breakout role came in the film The Fighting Chance (Charles Maigne, 1920), opposite Swedish actress Anna Q. Nilsson.\n\nDuring the 1920s, he became a popular matinee idol thanks to such films as Cecil B. DeMille's Fool's Paradise (1921) and Saturday Night (1922) with Leatrice Joy. He showed an unpretentious all-American charm. Nagel was nicknamed 'the Prince Consort', because of his numerous romantic leads opposite stars like Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels and Pola Negri.\n\nIn 1927, Nagel starred alongside Lon Chaney Sr., Marceline Day, Henry B. Walthall and Polly Moran in the now lost horror film, London After Midnight (Tod Browning, 1927). Among his best known films are The Mysterious Lady (Fred Niblo, 1928) and The Kiss (Jacques Feyder, 1929), in which he appeared opposite Greta Garbo.\n\nNagel' career was waning, but he became invaluable to MGM and Warner Bros. by assisting them on passing judgement on their contract players regarding the suitability of their voices for the film microphone. He was an expert thanks to his stage background, and his diction was superb. His salary was raised to $2500 a week and he was loaned out to other studios for a sum of $30,000 for his services in aiding the transition to 'talkies'.\n\nFrench postcard in the Les Vedettes de Cinéma series by A.N., Paris, no. 218.

He was also a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).\n\nIn his study 'Silent Players', Anthony Slide writes: \"He probably deserves more praise for founding the Academy and as a spokesman for Actors' Equity than as an actor, for he was a decidedly bland performer, so innocuous as to almost blend in with the sets of many of his features.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s, he appeared in little known productions as the action films The Ship from Shanghai (Charles Brabin, 1930), and Kongo (William J. Cowen, 1932) with Walter Huston. He spent the next several decades in high-profile films as a character actor.\n\nNagel hosted the Academy Awards in 1930, 1932 and again in 1953, this time alongside Bob Hope. He was awarded a Special Oscar in 1947 for his work on the Motion Picture relief Fund. Towards the end of his film career, Nagel acted as host for radio and TV shows.\n\nConrad Nagel died in 1970 in his Manhattan apartment in New York. He was married to Ruth Helms, actress Lynn Merrick and Michael Coulson Smith. All marriages ended in a divorce. He had two children, Ruth Margaret (1920) with first wife, Ruth) and Michael (late 1950s) with third wife Michael.\n\nThe last of his 109 feature films had been A Stranger in My Arms (Helmut Käutner, 1959). Anthony Slide: \"Curiously, despite the length of his career, the number of features in which he appeared, and the major studios for which he worked, Conrad Nagel did not appear in one film that might be regarded as a classic.\"\n\nFrench postcard by Editions Cinémagazine, no. 232.\n\nBritish postcard, no. 6 of a fifth series of 25 cinema stars issued with Sarony Cigarettes.

She became one of the top female dancers in the golden era of the musical. Her films include Singin' in the Rain (1952), The Band Wagon (1953), Brigadoon (1954) and Silk Stockings (1957). She was one of the few actresses to have danced with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.\n\nDutch postcard. Photo: M.G.M.

Moorlag, Heerlen, sort. 1/8.\n\nA Girl Called Sid\n\nCyd Charisse was born Tula Ellice Finklea in 1921 (some sources say 1922) in Amarillo, Texas. Her Baptist jeweller father encouraged her to begin her ballet lessons for health reasons. She was frail and sickly at the time and had a bout with polio.\n\nDuring a family vacation in Los Angeles when she was 12, her parents enrolled her in ballet classes at a school in Hollywood. One of her teachers was a handsome young dancer and dance instructor, named Nico Charisse.\n\nShe joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at age 13 and became a member of the corps de ballet at age 14. With the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, she toured the United States and Europe, adopting the name Felia Sidorova.\n\nIn Paris, Nico and Cyd married when she was 18. After World War II broke out the company disbanded and the Charisse couple moved to Hollywood. In 1942, they had a son, Nicky.\n\nCharisse got her start in Hollywood when Ballet Russe star David Lichine was hired by Columbia for a ballet sequence in the musical film Something to Shout About (Gregory Ratoff, 1943). She was billed now as Lily Norwood. The same year, she played a Russian dancer in Mission to Moscow (1943), directed by Michael Curtiz.\n\nIn 1945, she was hired to dance with Fred Astaire in Ziegfeld Follies (Vincente Minelli a.o., 1945), and that uncredited appearance got her a seven-year contract with MGM. Producer Arthur Freed preferred the name Charisse to Norwood and changed the spelling of her nickname Sid to Cyd. The nickname originated from her little brother. Initially, he could not say sister and called her Sid.\n\nHer first speaking part was supporting Judy Garland in The Harvey Girls (George Sidney, 1946). Her dark looks initially had her cast as ethnic beauties. She was cast as Ricardo Montalban's fiancee in the film Fiesta (Richard Thorpe, 1947), and as a Polynesian in the Esther Williams' musical On an Island with You (Richard Thorpe, 1948).\n\nIn 1947, Charisse’s marriage to Nico Charisse ended in divorce. She married singer Tony Martin in 1948.\n\nSpanish postcard by Ediciones J.R.N., no. 35/7.\n\nItalian postcard by Bromostampa, Torino/Milano.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, no. 422.

She appeared in only one of the film’s many indelible dance sequences, but one was enough, and she was both sultry vamp and diaphanous dream girl. Written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, the film established her as one of Hollywood’s most glamorous and seductive talents.\n\nA year later followed her great performance in The Band Wagon (Vincente Minnelli, 1953), where she danced with Fred Astaire in the acclaimed Dancing in the Dark number. I was her first starring role. Robert Berkvist in The New York Times: \"Astaire played a fading Hollywood song-and-dance man hoping to make a comeback on Broadway and who finds himself cast in a show opposite a snooty ballerina (Ms. Charisse). The couple do not see eye-to-eye until they take a nighttime carriage ride through a moonlit Central Park and wind up embracing languorously to the strains of ”Dancing in the Dark.” One of the most famous sequences from the film, if not in the history of dance on film, is 'The Girl Hunt Ballet,' in which Ms. Charisse plays the vamp to Astaire’s private-eye stage character.\"\n\nIn Brigadoon (Vincente Minnelli, 1954), adapted from the 1947 Broadway show by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, Gene Kelly and Van Johnson played American tourists who stumble on a mysterious Scottish village that materialises only once every 100 years. Kelly falls hard for a beautiful villager, Fiona (Charisse). She co-starred again with Kelly in It's Always Fair Weather (Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen, 1956).\n\nIn 1957 she rejoined Astaire in the film version of Silk Stockings (Rouben Mamoulian, 1957), a musical remake of Ninotchka (Ernst Lubitsch, 1939), with Charisse taking over Greta Garbo's role. She had a slightly unusual serious acting role in Party Girl (Nicholas Ray, 1958), where she played a showgirl who became involved with gangsters and a crooked lawyer.\n\nAs the 1960s dawned, musicals faded from the screen, as did her career. She made appearances on television and performed in a nightclub revue with her second husband, Tony Martin. At 70, she made her Broadway debut in Grand Hotel. Her last film appearance was in That's Entertainment! III (Bud Friedgen, Michael J. Sheridan, 1994) as one of the onscreen narrators of a tribute to the great MGM musical films.\n\nCyd Charisse died at age 87 of a heart attack in 2008 in Los Angeles, California. She had two sons: Nicholas Charisse (1942) and Tony Martin Jr. (1950).\n\nBelgian postcard. Photo: M.G.M.

She is best known for Luchino Visconti's crime drama Rocco e i suoi fratelli/Rocco and His Brothers (1960).\n\nItalian postcard by Bromofoto, Milano, no. 1649. Photo: G.B. Poletto / Titanus.

Panaro began her film career in 1954 with Il barcaiole di Amalfi/The boatman of Amalfi (Mino Roli, 1954) starring Mario Vitale.\n\nOne of her next films was the Italian drama Gli innamorati/Wild Love (1955) directed by Mauro Bolognini. The film, starring Antonella Lualdi and Franco Interlenghi, was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn a considerable number of romantic comedies she played the young love interest. Examples are the big hit Poveri ma belli/Girl in a Bikini (1956) and the sequels Belle ma povere/ Poor Girl, Pretty Girl (1957) and Poveri milionari (1959). All were directed by Dino Risi and starred Marisa Allasio, Maurizio Arena, Renato Salvatori, Lorella De Luca and Panaro.\n\nOn TV she co-hosted with Lorella De Luca the show Il Musichiere/The musicians in 1957. In 1957 she also played the leading role in the comedy Lazzarella by Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia, a film based on a popular song written by Domenico Modugno and Riccardo Pazzaglia.\n\nShe played Totò’s daughter in the satire Totò, Peppino e le fanatiche/Toto, Peppino and the Fanatics (Mario Mattoli, 1958) with Peppino De Filippo. And she played Nora, the girlfriend of Bruno (Mario Girotti - the future Terence Hill) in the film Cerasella (Raffaello Matarazzo, 1959) featuring Claudia Mori.\n\nItalian postcard by Casa Edit.

Set in Milan, it tells the story of an immigrant family from the South, led to the industrial North by the matriarch (Katina Paxinou).\n\nPresented in five distinct sections, the film weaves the story of Vincenzo (Spiros Fócas), Simone (Renato Salvatori), Rocco (Alain Delon), Ciro (Max Cartier) and Luca (Rocco Vidolazzi) as they struggle to adapt to life in the large and impersonal city of Milan.\n\nIn typical fashion for a director known for helping build Italian neo-realism, the film ends with no substantive resolution, but with clouds of doom hanging over the family. Panaro played Ciro’s fiancee Franca.\n\nElbert Ventura at AllMovie: “Painted with bold strokes and marked by inflamed passions, Rocco and His Brothers holds you in rapt attention despite its sprawling story. Visconti punctuates the Parondis' struggles with two harrowing scenes of ritualized violence that profoundly change the family and underscore the operatic determinism of Visconti's vision.\n\nThe movie's visceral intensity is matched only by the elegance and intelligence of the mise-en-scène, with its fine compositions, graceful camera moves, and evocative black-and-white cinematography. A work of overpowering power and stark beauty, Rocco and His Brothers stands as a vivid masterpiece from one of cinema's great artists.”\n\nItalian postcard, no. 464.\n\nItalian postcard by Rotalfoto, Milano, no. 746.\n\nItalian postcard by Rotalphoto, Milano, no. 723.\n\nBeautiful virgin Queen\n\nDuring the golden age of the European genre film, Alessandra Panaro played roles in each popular genre. She often used the more American sounding pseudonym Topsy Collins.\n\nShe co-starred in Peplums – the Italian sword-and-sandal adventure films - like Le Baccanti/The Bacchantes (Giorgio Ferroni, 1960) with Pierre Brice, and Ulisse contro Ercole/Ulysses Against Hercules (Mario Caiano, 1962) starring Georges Marchal. She played the beautiful virgin Queen Medea, Gordon Scott's heroic Prince Glaucus' love interest, in Ercole contro Molock/Hercules Against Moloch (Giorgio Ferroni, 1963).\n\nIn Germany she appeared in the Karl May Western Der Schatz der Azteken/The Treasure of the Aztecs (Robert Siodmak, 1965) with Lex Barker. One of her last films was the Spaghetti Western 30 Winchester per El Diablo/30 Winchesters for El Diablo (Gianfranco Baldanello, 1965) starring Carl Möhner.\n\nAfter finishing her film career she returned to the screen with her old colleague Lorella de Luca in the film comedy La madama/The Madam (Duccio Tessari, 1976) starring Christian De Sica and Carole André.\n\n33 years later she made another guest appearance in an episode of the Brazilian TV series A Grande Família/The Large Family (2009). Her final screen appearance was in the Italian film La notte è piccola per noi/The Night is Small for us (Gianfrancesco Lazotti, 2016) with Cristiana Capotondi and Philippe Leroy.\n\nPanaro was married twice, first to Italian-Egyptian banker Jean-Pierre Sabet who died in 1983, and then to actor Giancarlo Sbragia, who died in 1994.

From 1917 through to the end of the Nazi era, Ufa produced and distributed hundreds of films. Ufa has recorded unsurpassed artistic successes with silent films such as Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926) and Frau im Mond/Woman in the Moon (1929) and Joe May's Asphalt (1929). In 1930, the company enjoyed worldwide success with Der blaue Engel/The Blue Angel, directed by Joseph von Sternberg, and starring Emil Jannings and Marlene Dietrich. In 1942, as a result of the Nazi policy of 'forcible coordination' known as 'the Gleichschaltung', Ufa and all of its competitors, including Tobis, Terra, and Bavaria Film, were bundled together with foreign film production companies Nazi-controlled to form the super-corporation UFA-Film GmbH (UFI), with headquarters in Berlin.\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, Berlin, no. 675/2, ca. 1924.

Ufa was founded by a consortium headed by Emil Georg von Stauß, a former Deutsche Bank board member.\n\nAn early step towards the founding of UFA was taken on 13 January 1917 with the creation of the Bild- und Filmamt (Bufa) by Germany's Supreme Army Command. Formed as a reaction to the perceived advantage of Germany's enemies in the realm of film propaganda, Bufa's task was to make use of film for the purposes of psychological warfare.\n\nHowever, the plans envisaged by the German General Staff – especially those of Erich Ludendorff– went far beyond the creation of Bufa. Ludendorff foresaw a large-scale, state-controlled film corporation that would serve national interests. In this spirit, Universum-Film AG (Ufa) was founded as a consolidation of private film companies on 18 December 1917 in Berlin. The company's starting capital amounted to 25 million Reichsmark: among the contributors were the German government, the War Ministry and Deutsche Bank.\n\nPrior to establishing the company, the General Staff had initially considered taking over the Deutsche Lichtbild-Gesellschaft (DLG), which had been founded in 1916. This agency, however, was far too much under the influence of heavy industry and, in particular, of Alfred Hugenberg, chairman of Krupp. Hugenberg would later take over Ufa in 1927.\n\nThree main film companies formed the nucleus of UFA from the end of 1917: Messter Film, owned by Oskar Messter, a dominant German producer; PAGU (Projektions Union), originally formed by Paul Davidson in Frankfurt, with the Tempelhof Studios in Oberlandstraße in Berlin-Tempelhof and in Weissensee; and the Union-Theater chain of some 50 cinemas; and the entire German operation of Nordisk Film (founded in 1906 by Ole Olsen) including Nordische Films, the production company Oliver-Film of German producer David Oliver, cinemas, and a distribution company, was bought by Ufa in 1918.\n\nSoon more companies joined Ufa: Joe May's May-Film company, with film duplicating plant and glass-house studios at Weissensee Studios (next door to PAGU); Greenbaum-Film (previously Vitascope), Deutsche Bioscope (founded by Greenbaum in 1902) wich had merged in March 1920 with Erich Pommer's German branch of Éclair (Deutsche Éclair) to form Decla-Bioscop, taken over by Ufa in October 1921.\n\nUfa continued to sign production agreements with various independent producers, including Deulig (previously Deutsche Lichtbild-Gesellschaft), Cserépy Film, founded by Arzén von Cserépy, merged with UFA in 1922: Gloria-Film AG, founded by Hanns Lippmann; Heinrich Bolten-Baeckers' BB-Film; Rex-Film, founded in 1917 by Lupu Pick, Fern-Andra Vertriebsgesellschaft, Ossi-Oswalda-Film contracted to UFA from 1925; and the distributor Hansa-Film\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, Berlin.

When the vain and arrogant Paul Richter refused to strip for this scene, Lang called in the not so pretty Rudolf Klein-Rogge (Etzel - Attila - in the film), who immediately undressed and played the scene, to the dismay of Richter, as people now would identify Klein-Rogge's behind as his.\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, Berlin, no. 671/8.

Germany had been – and continued to be – largely cut off from film imports due to the war.\n\nThe mission of Ufa at the time of its founding was the production of films – feature films, documentaries, cultural films and weekly headline (newsreel) films – designed to function as propaganda for Germany abroad. However, after mounting tensions between the company's founding members, Deutsche Bank was able to prevail and implement their approach to film production as a business rather than for military objectives. Instead of propaganda films, Ufa now produced elaborate entertainment films such as Sumurun (Ernst Lubitsch, 1920) with Paul Wegener and Pola Negri.\n\nIn addition to his turbulent comedies, Ernst Lubitsch staged a series of million-dollar historical films. His Madame DuBarry(Ernst Lubitsch, 1919) with Pola Negri, Emil Jannings and Harry Liedtke was celebrated in Europe and the United States exuberantly. When Lubitsch shot Anna Boleyn/Anne Boleyn (Ernst Lubitsch, 1920) with Jannings and Henny Porten in the Tempelhof studio in the fall of 1920, Reich President Friedrich Ebert paid his respects to the forex messenger: \"A prestige film to show foreign countries what the German film industry has made progress.\"\n\nIn 1921, Ufa was already producing the lion's share of German feature films, and in that same year it was privatised. Starting in 1922, large ateliers in Neubabelsberg (today's Babelsberg Studio) and on Oberlandstraße in Berlin-Tempelhof were made available for film production. In 1926, the facilities were expanded by means of the construction of the largest studio hall in Europe at the time.\n\nIn 1923, after Decla-Bioscop AG and others were taken over, Erich Pommer became head of all production operations and discovered and fostered many stars, including Emil Jannings, Pola Negri, Conrad Veidt and Lya de Putti. Ufa became a modern multi-national company and media conglomerate. Very aware of Hollywood, Ufa tried to emulate it, rival with it, or differentiate itself from it. Focused on principles of product differentiation and niche marketing, Ufa deliberately created an art cinema and super-productions for export (the latter specifically designed and budgeted to break into the American market), while it looked to domestic cinema based on popular genres and stars for its economic foundation.\n\nUfa thus became a leader in the time of the German Expressionism, experienced a further boom and emerged as a direct competitor to Hollywood with films such as Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari/The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Wiene, 1920) with Werner Krauss, Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler/Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (Fritz Lang, 1922) starring Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Die Nibelungen (Fritz Lang, 1924) with Paul Richter, and Varieté/Variety (E.A. Dupont, 1925).\n\nIn 1924, Erich Pommer created the most artistically fruitful partnership of the German silent film: director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, film poet Carl Mayer, cinematographer Karl Freund and the architects Robert Herlth and Walter Röhrig. Their first joint film was Der Lezte Mann/The Last Laugh (F.W. Murnau, 1924), with Emil Jannings in the lead role. \"Please invent something new, even if it should be crazy,\" Pommer had asked, and the film makers came up with the 'entfesselte Kamera' (unleashed camera), which was used here for the first time to develop a consistent cinematic narrative. Two years later, the same team created another masterpiece, Faust (F.W. Murnau, 1926) with Gösta Ekman and Camilla Horn.\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 697/2. Photo: Ufa.

The resulting concentration on a few large German film companies, which came together to unite production, distribution and presentation under one Ufa's managers made severe miscalculations with regard to two large-scale productions, Die Nibelungen (Fritz Lang, 1924) and Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1926).\n\nIn 1925, financial pressures compelled UFA to enter into distribution agreements with American studios Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form Parufamet. The joint distribution company was supposed to distribute 60 films a year in Germany, 20 each from Paramount, Ufa and MGM. However, the agreement brought just the opposite of salvation: the financial fiasco of Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1926) and the devastating company report for the years 1926/27 marked the low point of the Ufa Crisis.\n\nIn March 1927, with the company facing bankruptcy, Alfred Hugenberg– Chairman of the German National People's Party and owner of the Scherl-Gruppe, a powerful media corporation – bought the company. The new General Director was Ludwig Klitzsch; Hugenberg himself took over the chairmanship of the supervisory board; his deputy was banker Emil Georg von Stauß. At first, nothing changed in Ufa's production policy. In 1928, Erich Pommer was replaced as head of production by Ernst Hugo Correll, who led the company through the transition to sound film or 'talkies'.\n\nWithin two years Ludwig Klitzsch turned the wreck of the Ufa back into the flagship of the German film industry. In tough negotiations, Klitzsch managed to ease the barely-fulfillable conditions of the Parufamet contract, and he rehired Erich Pommer, restoring Ufa’s previous high standards to Babelsberg. Pommer returned to Berlin in 1928, but did not resume his old position but produced films as an independent within Ufa. Ufa gained an advantage over smaller companies in the realm of sound film production as a result of a contract with Tobis-Klangfilm, which simplified the licensing situation for Ufa.\n\nThe Ufa’s first 'one-hundred-percent' sound film, Melodie des HerzensMelody of the Heart (Hanns Schwarz, 1929), with Dita Parlo and Willy Fritsch, premiered on 16 December 1929, and shortly after that Der blaue Engel/The Blue Angel (Josef von Sternberg, 1930) marked an early highlight of Ufa’s sound film production. Emil Jannings, who had won the first Oscar in Hollywood in 1927, was supposed to be the star of the film — but the real star turned out to be the little-known Marlene Dietrich, who turned her back on Germany and Ufa the day after the premiere and absconded to Hollywood.\n\nLiebeswalzer/Waltzes of Love (Wilhelm Thiele, 1929), a form of film operetta with the celebrated 'Traumpaar' (dream couple) Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch, set the tone for Ufa’s early sound films. By letting the song and dance scenes develop out of the plot, he anticipated an important element of subsequent Hollywood musicals. With Wilhelm Thiele, the brothers Kurt and Robert Siodmak, the screenwriters Billy Wilder and Robert Liebmann, and the composers Werner Richard Heymann and Friedrich Hollaender, Erich Pommer had mustered a new team of young talents. All of them — of necessity — would soon be headed for careers in Hollywood.\n\nUfa produced in the following years many comedies and operettas, including Die Drei von der Tankstelle/The Three from the Filling Station (Wilhelm Thiele, 1930) with Willy Fritsch, Lilian Harvey and Oskar Karlweis, Einbrecher/Burglars (Hanns Schwarz, 1930), also with Fritsch and Harvey, Der Kongreß tanzt/The Congress dances (Erik Charell, 1931), again with Fritsch and Harvey, and Conrad Veidt, Der Mann, der seinen Mörder sucht/The Man in Search of His Murderer (Robert Siodmak, 1931) with Heinz Rühmann and Lien Deyers, Bomben auf Monte Carlo/Bombs on Monte Carlo (Hanns Schwarz, 1931) starring Hans Albers, Anna Sten and Heinz Rühmann, Meine Frau, die Hochstaplerin/My Wife, the Impostor (Kurt Gerron, 1931) with Rühmann and Käthe von Nagy, Es wird schon wieder besser/Things Are Getting Better Already (Kurt Gerron, 1932) with Dolly Haas, and Ich und die Kaiserin/The Empress and I (Friedrich Hollaender, 1933) with Lilian Harvey and Mady Christians.\n\nAmong the most successful Ufa directors in the silent era and early sound period were Ludwig Berger, Paul Czinner, Wilhelm Dieterle, Ewald André Dupont, Karl Grune, Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch, Joe May, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Arthur Robison, Hanns Schwarz, Paul L. Stein, and Wilhelm Thiele.\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, Berlin, no. 71/1. Photo: Ufa / Parufamet. Publicity still for Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927) with Brigitte Helm as the good Maria.

Willi Forst, Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch in the musical comedy Ein blonder Traum/Happy Ever After (Paul Martin, 1932).\n\nTransferred to the Nazi Party\n\nIn 1933, Alfred Hugenberg, transferred Ufa to the Nazi Party. He became Minister of the Economy, Agriculture and Nutrition in Hitler's cabinet. Ufa experienced a new commercial boom in the Nazi era, not least due to the government's protectionist measures, which freed the company from bothersome domestic and foreign competition, sometimes even incorporating their production facilities and staff. On top of that, by occupying almost all of Europe, the Nazi regime also provided Ufa with new sales markets, as well as placing distribution outlets in such 'neutral' countries as the United States.\n\nIn the spring of 1933, Ufa fired its Jewish employees ”due to the national revolution”. Erich Pommer was fired as well and emigrated to Paris in May. Ufa productions such as the patriotic submarine film Morgenrot/Dawn (Vernon Sewell, Gustav Ucicky, 1933) became a symbol of the 'new times' touted by the Nazi regime. In 1933, before open propaganda was increasingly replaced by sheer entertainment with ideological overtones, Goebbels celebrated the Ufa propaganda film Hitlerjunge Quex/Hitler Youth Quex (Hans Steinhoff, 1933) as a milestone.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1942, the following were house directors at Ufa: Carl Boese, Eduard von Borsody, Peter Paul Brauer, Karl Hartl, Georg Jacoby, Gerhard Lamprecht, Herbert Maisch, Paul Martin, Karl Ritter, Reinhold Schünzel (until 1936), Detlef Sierck a.k.a. Douglas Sirk (until 1937), Hans Steinhoff, Robert A. Stemmle, Viktor Tourjansky, Gustav Ucicky and Erich Waschneck.\n\nOne of the best known and most notorious films of this period was the Nazi propaganda film Triumph des Willens/Triumph of the Will (1935), directed, produced, edited, and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer. Riefenstahl's techniques—such as moving cameras, aerial photography, the use of long focus lenses to create a distorted perspective, and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography—have earned Triumph of the Will recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history.\n\nBy 1938, after taking over foreign film production facilities in France, Belgium and other countries, one third of Ufa's sales came from abroad. Ufa's economic boom made it possible to further expand the so-called 'star system,' which had already been developed in the silent film era. The highest paid Ufa stars in the Nazi era were Hans Albers and Zarah Leander. Veit Harlan was the highest-earning director.\n\nIn addition, as a result of the nationalist German spirit that already dominated the company, Ufa was perfectly suited to serve the goals of National Socialist propaganda in film. Hugenberg had made Ufa openly available for Joseph Goebbels' propaganda machine, even though Hugenberg was removed from his post as Minister shortly thereafter (June 1933) under pressure from Hitler. In an act of anticipatory obedience to the Nazi regime, Ufa management fired several Jewish employees on 29 March 1933. In the summer of 1933, the Nazi regime created the Film Chamber of the Reich, which adopted regulations officially excluding Jewish filmmakers from all German studios.\n\nIn 1936, Germany's first film institute was founded in the form of the Ufa-Lehrschau set up by Hans Traub at the Babelsberg Film Complex. Goebbels systematically brought Ufa and all other media companies under the control of his Propaganda Ministry.\n\nLeni Riefenstahl. German postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 4803/1, 1929-1930.

This move meant that Ufa was effectively nationalised.\n\nEmil Georg von Stauß was named Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Ludwig Klitzsch remained General Director, and Carl Opitz was named Press Officer. In May, an art committee headed by Carl Froelich– but in fact controlled by Goebbels – was founded. This committee proceeded to have a direct influence on Ufa's production planning; it also severely curtailed the work of production head Ernst Hugo Correll. In 1939, Correll was fired after refusing to join the Nazi Party.\n\nAt the time of its nationalisation, among the production facilities belonging to Ufa were 27 film studios, nine of which were in Neubabelsberg (Potsdam-Babelsberg), and seven of which were in Berlin-Tempelhof, including three that belonged to Carl Froelich-Film GmbH in name only. UFA also had two dubbing studios, a mixing studio, two animation studios, two ateliers for advertising films, one for cartoons and a small training atelier.\n\nThe release of the Technicolor film The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939) in the United States was a heavy influence for Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. By 1940 the German research laboratory Agfa was producing its own version of coloured film that had “caught up with the Americans in [colour cinematography]” according to Goebbels’ diary.\n\nThe first German feature film to be made in colour, and one of the most expensive films produced during the Third Reich was the musical comedy Frauen sind doch bessere Diplomaten/Women Are Better Diplomats (Georg Jacoby, 1941), starring Marika Rökk, Willy Fritsch and Aribert Wäscher. It was based on a novel by Hans Flemming. The film was among the most popular German films of the early war years.\n\nIn 1941, Goebbels ordered the production of another colour film, Münchhausen (Josef von Baky, 1943) starring Hans Albers, in order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Ufa. The Jubiläumsfilm, or anniversary film, was commissioned by Goebbels, and Reichsfilmdramaturg Fritz Hippler was chosen to oversee the film's production. Hippler hired author Erich Kästner for the screenplay, a decision met with controversy as several of Kästner's previous works such as Fabian were banned after 1933 when the Nazi party began heavy censorship of the arts.\n\nThe production of Münchhausen began in 1941 with an initial budget of over 4.5 million Reichsmarks that increased to over 6.5 million, after Goebbels’ intentions to “surpass the special effects and color artistry” of Alexander Korda's Technicolor film The Thief of Bagdad (Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell, Tim Whelan, 1940). The budget for the film allowed Von Báky and his production staff nearly limitless opportunities to display the superlative nature of Kästner's vision of Baron von Münchhausen. Münchhausen represented the pinnacle of the Volksfilm style of propaganda designed to entertain the masses and distract the population from the war, borrowing the Hollywood genre of large budget productions with extensive colourful visuals.\n\nOn 10 January 1942, Ufa officially became the subsidiary of UFA-Film GmbH (UFI), into which all German film production was merged. Other companies were dissolved or integrated into UFA at the time, including Bavaria Film, Berlin-Film, Terra Film and Tobis AG, which became additional production units. Film production in the captured nations was also brought under its aegis.\n\nAt this point, the UFA staff hierarchy was reorganized according to the Nazi Führer principle. The coordination of individual sub-groups of the UFI Corporation was the job of the newly appointed Reich Film Director-General. The production heads worked for the administrative director general and were responsible for the overall planning of annual programming and content design all the way up to the actual shooting of the film: these heads were also responsible for giving instructions to the film line producers and directors. It was subsequently fully nationalised in mid-1944.\n\nRemarkable films from these years are the comedy Die Feuerzangenbowle/The Punch Bowl (Helmut Weiss, 1944), starring Heinz Rühmann, and the perfidious propaganda film Kolberg (Veit Harlan, 1945), starring Kristina Söderbaum and Heinrich George. One of the last films of the Third Reich, it was intended as a Nazi propaganda piece to bolster the will of the German population to resist the Allies. It was the most expensive Ufa film of all times, costing 8.5 million marks, and premiered on 30 January 1945.\n\nThe poetic love story Unter den Brücken/Under the Bridges, filmed on the rivers around Potsdam, was directed by Helmut Käutner and starred Hannelore Schroth, Carl Raddatz and Gustav Knuth. The film drama uses poetic realism to portray the everyday lives and romances of two Havel boatmen. Unter den Brücken was shot in Berlin during the summer of 1944, but was not released until after the defeat of Nazi Germany. It premiered in Locarno in September 1946, and wasn't released in Germany until 1950. It is now seen as one of the maserpieces of the German war time cinema.\n\nMarika Rökk.

All activities in the film industry were placed under strict licensing regulations and all films were subject to censorship. The Soviet military government, which was in favour of a speedy reconstruction of the German film industry under Soviet supervision, incorporated the Babelsberg ateliers into DEFA, subsequently the GDR's state film studio, on 17 May 1946.\n\nIn contrast, the main film-policy goal of the Allied occupying forces, under American insistence, consisted in preventing any future accumulation of power in the German film industry. The Western powers also had more interest in opening up the German film market for their own products rather than in letting the national film industry regain its foothold. Thus the reorganisation of Germany's film industry outside the Soviet zone was very slow.\n\nAfter the privatisation of Bavaria and UFA in 1956 in West-Germany, the company was restructured to form Universum Film AG and taken over by a consortium of banks. In 1964, Bertelsmann's Chief Representative, Manfred Köhnlechner, acquired the entire Universum Film AG from Deutsche Bank, which had previously been the main UFA shareholder and which had determined the company's business policy as head of the shareholders' consortium.\n\nKöhnlechner bought UFA, which was strongly in debt, on behalf of Reinhard Mohn for roughly five million Deutschmarks. Köhnlechner: \"The question came up as to why not take the entire thing, it still had many gems.\" Only a few months later, Köhnlechner also acquired the UFA-Filmtheaterkette, a film theatre chain, for almost eleven million Deutschmarks.\n\nIn 1997, UFA and the Luxembourgish rival CLT established the joint venture CLT-UFA, which, following the takeover of British rival Pearson TV, was restructured as RTL Group in 2000. Today, UFA GmbH (UFA) works as a subsidiary of RTL Group's production division FremantleMedia, which had been formed out of Pearson TV, and is responsible for all production activities of Bertelsmann and FremantleMedia in Germany.\n\nUntil August 2013, eight subsidiaries operated under the UFA umbrella: UFA Fernsehproduktion, UFA Entertainment, Grundy UFA, Grundy Light Entertainment, UFA Cinema, Teamworx, Phoenix Film and UFA Brand Communication. In August 2013, UFA underwent an organisational restructuring that simplified the company down to three production divisions. From then on, UFA Fiction, UFA Serial Drama and UFA Show & Factual are the three units responsible for production. In February 2019, Universum (UFA) was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.\n\nTruus van Aalten. German postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 5321/1, 1930-1931. Photo: Ufa.\n\nElse Elster.

She was a major film presence for six decades, and turned herself from a Blonde Bombshell into a widely-respected actress who won two Oscars, for The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) and A Patch of Blue (1965). Less known, Winters also appeared in several European films, including Alfie (1966) and Roman Polanski's Le Locataire (1976).\n\nItalian postcard by Bromofoto, Milano, no. 273.\n\nItalian postcard by Bromofoto, Milano, no. 316.

Photo: Universal International.\n\nThe limitations of the Blonde Bombshell role\n\nShelley Winters was born Shirley Schrift in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1920. She was the daughter of Rose (née Winter), a singer with The Muny, and Jonas Schrift, a designer of men's clothing; her parents were Jewish immigrants. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was three years old.\n\nWinters studied at The New School in New York City, where she appeared in high school plays. Her first film was What a Woman! (Irving Cummings, 1943) starring Rosalind Russell. Throughout the 1940s, she mostly played bit roles and studied in the Hollywood Studio Club.\n\nIn the late 1940s, she shared an apartment with another newcomer, Marilyn Monroe. Winters achieved stardom with her breakout performance as the the party girl waitress who ends as the victim of insane actor Ronald Colman in A Double Life (George Cukor, 1947).\n\nShe quickly ascended in Hollywood with leading roles in The Great Gatsby (Elliott Nugent, 1949) with Alan Ladd, and Winchester 73 (Anthony Mann, 1950), opposite James Stewart. Universal Pictures built her up as a Blonde Bombshell but she quickly tired of the role's limitations.\n\nShe washed off her makeup and played against type to set up Elizabeth Taylor's beauty in A Place in the Sun (George Stevens, 1951), still a landmark American film. Her performance brought Winters acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Winters continued to star in films, including Meet Danny Wilson (Joseph Pevney, 1952) as Frank Sinatra's leading lady, and most notably in Charles Laughton's Night of the Hunter (1955), with Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish.\n\nIn Great Britain she played in the Christopher Isherwood adaptation I Am a Camera (Henry Cornelius, 1955) opposite Julie Harris and Laurence Harvey, and in Italy in Mambo (Robert Rossen, 1954) opposite Silvana Mangano and her second husband Vittorio Gassman.\n\nShe also returned to the stage on various occasions during this time, including a Broadway run in 'A Hatful of Rain' (1955–1956), opposite future, third husband Anthony Franciosa. Although she was now in demand as a character actress, Winters continued to study her craft. She attended Charles Laughton's Shakespeare classes and worked at the Actors Studio, both as student and teacher.\n\nBelgian collectors card by De Beukelaer, Anvers, no. A 7.

She donated her Oscar for The Diary of Anne Frank to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.\n\nNotable roles during the 1960s included her lauded performance as the man-hungry Charlotte Haze in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (Stanley Kubrick, 1962); starring opposite Michael Caine in Alfie (Lewis Gilbert, 1966), and as the fading, alcoholic former starlet Fay Estabrook in Harper (Jack Smight, 1966).\n\nThe following decade she could be seen in The Poseidon Adventure (Ronald Neame, 1972) as the ill-fated Belle Rosen (for which she received her final Oscar nomination), and in Next Stop, Greenwich Village (Paul Mazursky, 1976).\n\nWinters also starred in interesting European films like Roman Polanski’s thriller Le Locataire/The Tenant (1976) with Isabelle Adjani, and Mario Monicelli’s drama Un borghese piccolo piccolo/A Very Little Man (1977) with Alberto Sordi.\n\nShe also returned to the stage during the 1960s and 1970s, most notably in Tennessee Williams''Night of the Iguana'. She appeared in such cult films as Wild in the Streets (Barry Shear, 1968), Bloody Mama (Roger Corman, 1970) and Whoever Slew Auntie Roo? (Curtis Harrington, 1971). She also starred in the Broadway musical 'Minnie's Boys' (1970) as Minnie Marx, the mother of Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, and Gummo Marx.\n\nDuring her 50 years as a widely known personality, Winters was rarely out of the news. Her stormy marriages, her romances with famous stars, her forays into politics, and feminist causes kept her name before the public. She delighted in giving provocative interviews and seemed to have an opinion on everything.\n\nThat led to a second career as a writer. She recalled her conquests in her autobiographies, like 'Shelley Also Known As Shirley', and wrote of a yearly rendezvous she kept with William Holden, as well as her affairs with Sean Connery, Burt Lancaster, Errol Flynn, Farley Granger and Marlon Brando.\n\nWinters gained significant weight later in life, but lost much of it for (or before) an appearance at the 1998 Academy Awards telecast, which featured a tribute to Oscar winners past and present. In a recurring role in the 1990s, Winters played the title character's grandmother on the ABC sitcom Roseanne.\n\nHer final film roles were supporting ones: she played a restaurant owner and mother of an overweight cook in Heavy (James Mangold, 1995), with Liv Tyler and Debbie Harry, and as an aristocrat in The Portrait of a Lady (Jane Campion, 1996), starring Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich. Her final film was the Italian comedy La bomba (Giulio Base, 1999) with her former husband Vittorio Gassman (whose last film this was too) and his son Alessandro Gassman.\n\nWinters was married four times; her husbands were: Captain Mack Paul Mayer, whom she married on New Year's Day, 1942; they divorced in October 1948. Winters wore his wedding ring up until her death, and kept their relationship very private. In 1952, she married Vittorio Gassman. They divorced in 1954 and had one child, Vittoria (1953), a physician, who practices internal medicine at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut. She was Winters' only child. Later husbands were Anthony Franciosa (1957-1960) and long-time companion Gerry DeFord, whom she married hours before her death in 2006.\n\nShelley Winters died at the age of 85 on 14 January 2006, of heart failure at the Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills.\n\nBelgian collectors card by Kwatta, Bois-d'Haine, no.

She also performed the 'Can-can' at the legendary Parisian nightclub Bal Tabarin. In 1930, Viviane was elected Miss Paris, and caused a small scandal because she had a child.\n\nShe made her film debut with a cameo role in Paris-girls (Henry Roussell, 1929) with Fernand Fabre. She appeared in several films over the next few years, including La Chienne/The Bitch (Jean Renoir, 1931), Liliom (Fritz Lang, 1934), and Zouzou (Marc Allégret, 1934). Opposite Jean Gabin, she played in La Bandera/The Bandage (Julien Duvivier, 1935).\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam/Princess Tam Tam (Edmond T. Gréville, 1935) was a French adaptation of G.B. Shaw'sPygmalion with Josephine Baker as a beautiful native African woman, who is ‘westernised’ by a handsome writer and then introduced to high society as an exotic princess.\n\nViviane Romance made a strong impression in La belle équipe/The Good Crew (Julien Duvivier, 1936) as the sensual Gina who plots the destruction of Jean Gabin’s character because he refuses to make love to her. La belle équipe constituted a milestone in the French Cinema. From this time on Romance was regarded as one of France's leading film actresses and an insurance at the box office.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, no. 126.

She preferred to make films in her native France and many noted directors asked her to. However, she also resided for many years in Italy where she made several Italian language films in the 1950s.\n\nThroughout her career she played dozens of exotic femme fatales, courtesans, vamps and fallen women with hearts of gold. Among her best films during the occupation of France were Angélica/Blood Red Rose (Jean Choux, 1940), and the excellent melodrama Vénus aveugle/Blind Venus (Abel Gance, 1941). She also starred in the title role of Carmen (Christian-Jaque, 1944), a French-Italian version of the famous opera by Georges Bizet.\n\nAfter the war followed the dark thriller Panique/Panic (Julien Duvivier, 1946) based on a novel by Georges Siménon, Passion (Georges Lampin, 1951) and the anthology film Les Sept péchés capitaux/The Seven Deadly Sins (Yves Allégret, 1952). Her last film from this period was Pitié pour les vamps/Pity for the Vamps (Jean Josipovici, 1956).\n\nShe went into production with her then-husband Clément Duhour, but without much success. After 1956 her acting roles were few, and she suffered considerable financial hardship. In 1962, she starred with Jean Gabin in the suspenser Mélodie en sous-sol/Any Number Can Win (Henri Verneuil, 1962).\n\nEventually she re-appeared on television in the early 1970s. In 1973 she made one final film appearance in the thriller Nada/The Nada Gang (Claude Chabrol, 1974), answering a special request by director Claude Chabrol. It was her 65th film.\n\nShe published her memoirs, Romantique à mourir in 1986. Viviane Romance died of cancer in 1991 in Nice, France. She had married and divorced three times. Her spouses were actor Georges Flamant, actor Clément Duhour and director Jean Josipovici.\n\nFrench collectors card by Massilia. Photo: Paris Film Production.

Das Herz des Casanova/The Heart of Casanova (Erik Lund, 1919) was one of the silent films on which his fame as a heartthrob was based. Ross Verlag made a series of sepia postcards for the film, of which we show four below.\n\nBruno Kastner. erman postcard by Rotophot in the Film Sterne series, no. 181/2.

The actor on the right may be Karl Platen.\n\nSlim, good-looking, young - and unfit for military service\n\nBruno Kastner was discovered by Danish film diva Asta Nielsen. He made his film debut opposite her in the short comedy Engelein/Little Angel (Urban Gad, 1914), with Fred Immler and Hanns Kräly. He followed the success of this film with the sequel Engeleins Hochzeit/Little Angel's Wedding (Urban Gad, 1916).\n\nMost men of his age were in the war, the demand for actors was bigger than the offer. Bruno Kastner was slim, good-looking, young - and unfit for military service. During the First World War, Kastner quickly became a matinee idol in Germany, especially popular with female fans. His picture decorated many bedside tables.\n\nThe German press commented on Kastner's rise to stardom and how vexed postmen were having to transport love letters from fans to Kastner in laundry baskets. Kastner cemented his romantic image by appearing as the ardent suitor to such popular actresses Dorrit Weixler, Lotte Neumann and Mia May in a number of films of the era.\n\nMale filmgoers were less fond of Kastner's image of a handsome dandy and gave him the nickname 'Kleiderbügel' (coat hanger) - a reference to his slim build and fashionable wardrobe.\n\nBruno Kastner himself wrote the screenplay for Das Herz des Casanova, together with Erich Rennspies. It was one of the four films that he would star in and for which he would write the script. The others were Nur ein Diener/Only a Servant, Der letzte Sonnensohn/The Last Sun Son and Der Weltmeister/The World Champion. All were directed and produced by Erik Lund (pseudonym for director-producer Manfred Liebenau) for the Berlin-based firm Ring-Film and were released in 1919.\n\nHis co-stars in Das Herz des Casanova/The Heart of Casanova (Erik Lund, 1919) were Ria Jende, Rosa Lichtenstein and Karl Platen. Not much else is known about the film, except that the sets were created by Siegfried Wroblewsky and that Curt Courant was behind the camera.\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 622/4.

The ballets, 'The Red Shoes ballet' by Sir Robert Helpmann and 'The Shoemaker' by Leonide Massine, are magnificently staged. The glorious Technicolor cinematography by Jack Cardiff is tremendous. Moira Shearer with her red hair and peaches and cream skin projects a refined presence in the film that is hard to forget. Cinematography, music, acting and ballet combined make a timeless classic with a vivid look that 70 years after, still appears fresh and glamorous.\n\nMoira Shearer.

Moira Shearer and Robert Helpmann in The Red Shoes (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1948).\n\nTorn between Lermontov's demands and those of her heart\n\nThe Red Shoes (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1948) is basically a fairy tale loosely based on a Hans Christian Andersen story. Emeric Pressburger's story appears simple at first glance, but is a challenging study of the value and purpose of art, and of aestheticism as a creed.\n\nAt a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at Covent Garden Opera House, music student Julian Craster (Marius Goring) is in attendance to hear the ballet score 'Heart of Fire', composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page (Moira Shearer), a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As 'Heart of Fire' progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions.\n\nDuring the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking charismatic Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\n\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind Heart of Fire, but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter.\n\nLermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a répétiteur for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague. Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of 'Heart of Fire'.\n\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with Ballet Rambert in a matinee performance of Swan Lake at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, in a production with a company led by Marie Rambert (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and Monte Carlo. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, 'The Red Shoes', for which Julian is to provide the music.\n\nUnder the authoritarian rule of Lermontov, his proteges realise the full promise of their talents, but at a price: utter devotion to their art and complete loyalty to Lermontov himself. Under his near-obsessive guidance, Vicky is poised for superstardom, but earns Lermontov's scorn when she falls in love with Julian. Vicky leaves the company and marries Craster, but still finds herself torn between Lermontov's demands and those of her heart.\n\nAt the 21st Academy Awards, The Red Shoes won awards for Best Original Score and Best Art Direction. It also had nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.\n\nBritish postcard in the Picturegoer Series, London, no. W. 651. Photo: J. Arthur Rank Organisation Ltd.

Kim Basinger in Batman (Tim Burton, 1989).\n\nFinancial success came along with new found fame\n\nKimila Ann Basinger was born in 1953, in Athens, Georgia. She comes from an entertainment background. Her father was a musician, who played big-band jazz and her mother was a dancer, who had performed water ballet in several Esther Williams movies.\n\nAs a schoolgirl, she was very shy. To help her overcome this, her parents had Kim study ballet from an early age. At 16, Basinger branched out into beauty pageants. She won the title of Junior Miss Georgia and competed at the national Junior Miss event in New York City.\n\nWhile in New York, Basinger caught the eye of a modelling agent at the Ford Modeling Agency. She soon landed a contract and first gained fame as a model for Breck Shampoo. At the age of 20, Kim was a top model commanding $1,000 a day. Throughout the early 1970s, she appeared on dozens of magazine covers and in hundreds of ads.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Basinger moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. She landed a number of small parts at first, making guest appearances on such shows as Charlie's Angels. In 1978, Basinger starred in the TV movie Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold. She portrayed Lorene Rogers in the Miniseries From Here to Eternity (1979) and its short-lived spin-off series the following year.\n\nIn 1980, she married make-up artist Ron Snyder (they divorced in 1989). Basinger made her film debut in the Western drama Hard Country (David Greene, 1981) with Jan-Michael Vincent. Two years later, her career started to skyrocket with the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (Irvin Kershner, 1983) starring Sean Connery and with Basinger as the 'Bond girl'.\n\nMore major film projects soon followed, including The Natural (Barry Levinson, 1984) with Robert Redford, and the steamy romance 9 1/2 Weeks (Adrian Lyne, 1986) with Mickey Rourke. She played a small-town Texan beauty in Nadine (Robert Benton, 1987). Her breakout role was as photojournalist Vicki Vale in the blockbuster hit Batman (Tim Burton, 1989) with Michael Keaton.\n\nKim was a last-minute replacement for Sean Young. This took her to a career high. Financial success also came along with her new found fame. But Basinger became known for her unusual business decisions. In 1989, she and some other investors bought the town of Braselton, in her native Georgia, for $20 million. Basinger sought to make the community near Atlanta a tourist destination, but she ended up selling it five years later as she faced personal bankruptcy.\n\nVintage postcard, no. X 142.

The pair wed in 1993, becoming one of Hollywood's most attractive yet volatile couples. Basinger and Baldwin welcomed their only child together in 1995. They named their daughter Ireland. Kim took some time off to stay at home with her child.\n\nBasinger's career had floundered a bit. In 1993, she found herself in an intense legal battle after breaking a verbal agreement to appear in Jennifer Lynch's Boxing Helena (1993). The court sided with the film's producers, ordering the actress to pay millions for breach of contract. The case was later overturned on appeal.\n\nIn 1997, Basinger gave one of her greatest performances in L.A. Confidential (Curtis Hanson, 1997) opposite Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe. She starred as a high-end prostitute with an intentional resemblance to actress Veronica Lake in this 1950s crime drama. She won an Academy Award for her work on the film.\n\nDespite this acclaim, Basinger soon appeared in more headlines than film roles. She filed for divorce from her husband Alec Baldwin in 2001 and spent years locked in a bitter custody dispute over their daughter.\n\nAfter her divorce, Kim Basinger took on few acting roles. She reteamed with L.A. Confidential director Curtis Hanson for the rap drama 8 Mile (Curtis Hanson, 2002) in which she played the mother of Eminem. Two years later, she co-starred with Jeff Bridges in The Door in the Floor (Tod Williams, 2004) and with Chris Evans and Jason Statham in the thriller Cellular (David R. Ellis, 2004).\n\nBasinger's later films include Charlie St. Cloud (Burr Steers, 2010) with Zac Efron, and Grudge Match (Peter Segal, 2013) with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone. She has also made a return to modelling, signing with IMG Models in 2013.\n\nKim Basinger is a strict vegetarian, who devoted energy to animal rights issues and posed for anti-fur advertisements of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals).\n\nRecently, she appeared in the film The Nice Guys (Shane Black, 2016) with Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling and the Fifty Shades of Grey (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) sequels Fifty Shades Darker (James Foley, 2017) and Fifty Shades Freed (James Foley, 2018) with Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.\n\nFrench postcard by Sonis, no.

DEFA was an abbreviation for 'Deutsche Film AG' (German Film Corporation), reminiscent of the corporate name Ufa. It existed from 1946 to its liquidation in 1990 – nearly 45 years, longer than the GDR itself. The DEFA fostered a wide range of artistic developments. Alongside the ongoing production of light entertainment, it made films in the style of socialist realism, fairy tales and literary adaptations, staunchly antifascist films and Easterns (Indianerfilme) with a political subtext, as well as productions which took a critical view of contemporary social issues and provoked conflicts and bans.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, Berlin, no. 7/319. 1957.

She had her breakthrough in the first film released after World War II in East Germany, Die Mörder sind unter uns/The Murderers Are Among Us (Wolfgang Staudte, 1946), produced by the DEFA. Her powerful performance as a Holocaust survivor amid the ruins of postwar Berlin made her immediately a star. Over 4 million East-Germans went to the cinema to see it.\n\nGerman postcard by Starfoto Hasemann. Photo: DEFA. Publicity still for Freies Land/A Free Country (Milo Harbich, 1946).\n\nFritz Wagner (1915-1982) was a handsome German star in the European cinema of the 1940s and 1950s. From 1938 to 1976, he appeared in more than sixty films and TV productions. After the war, he played a leading role in the drama Freies Land/A Free Country (Milo Harbich, 1946) the second film of the newly founded DEFA studio in the Soviet occupation zone which later became East Germany. The propaganda film portrayed the effects of land reforms brought in by the Soviet authorities. It would be the only DEFA film until the mid-1950s that dealt with the hardships of East-Germany's rural life, and was heavily influenced by the Italian Neorealism of that time. Most people in the film weren't professional actors but farmers. The film proved to be very unsuccessful on its release. For the DEFA, he also played a leading role in the war drama Die Brücke/The Bridge (Arthur Pohl, 1949), and in Der Kahn der fröhlichen Leute/The boat of the happy people (Hans Heinrich, 1950) which sold more than 4,100,000 tickets.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Filmvertrieb, no. 620/64. Photo: DEFA / Neufeld. Publicity still for Figaros Hochzeit/The Marriage of Figaro (Georg Wildhagen, 1949).\n\nAustrian Angelika Hauff (1922–1983) played the lead in several post-war German and Austrian films. For the DEFA, she appeared in three films, including the box office hit Figaros Hochzeit/The Marriage of Figaro (Georg Wildhagen, 1949) with Willy Domgraf-Fassbaender and Sabine Peters. It was based on the opera 'The Marriage of Figaro' by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte, which was itself based on the play 'The Marriage of Figaro' by Pierre Beaumarchais. Hauff plays the chambermaid Susanna, around whom the men fight. The film was the first opera film made by DEFA and it was a huge success with 5,479,427 tickets sold.\n\nA primary means of re-educating the German populace\n\nThe DEFA was officially founded on 17 May 17, 1946 in the former Althoff Studios in Potsdam-Babelsberg, part of the Soviet Occupied Zone in eastern Germany. It was the first film production company in post-war Germany. While the other Allies, in their zones of occupation, viewed a rapid revival of a German film industry with suspicion, the Soviets valued the medium as a primary means of re-educating the German populace as it emerged from twelve years of Nazi rule. The Soviet Military Administration (SMAD) handed over the license to 'Filmaktiv', a group of committed filmmakers and German Communist Party (KPD) members.\n\nHowever, Wolfgang Staudte had already begun work on DEFA's first film, Die Mörder sind unter uns/The Murderers Are Among Us (1946) a few days days earlier. The first DEFA production was also Germany's very first post-war film. Staudte's film launched a long-term DEFA policy: in its style, content and ideology, it was a reaction against the propaganda films of Nazi Germany, a tactic which was to be especially successful in the DEFA's early classics. Stylistically, Die Mörder sind unter uns carried on the expressionist lighting tradition of the 1920s.\n\nIn Freies Land/Free Land (1946), Milo Harbich tried to synthesise stylistic elements of Soviet revolutionary film with didactic sermons on land reform. Kurt Maetzigs first feature film, Ehe im Schatten/Marriage in the Shadows (Kurt Maetzig, 1947), tells the story of married actors driven to suicide by the Nazis' anti-Semitic persecution, based on the fate of Joachim Gottschalk and his wife. The film was shown in all four occupation zones and drew more than ten million viewers in three years. Wolfgang Staudte's Rotation (1949) took a new approach to early 20th century German history by showing the lives of proletarian families, a contrast to the bourgeois perspective which had hitherto predominated.\n\nThe original board of directors consisted of Alfred Lindemann, Karl Hans Bergmann, and Herbert Volkmann, with Hans Klering as administrative Secretary. Klering, a former graphic designer, also designed DEFA's logo. On 13 August 1946, the company was officially registered as a joint-stock company (German: Aktiengesellschaft). By the end of the year, in addition to the Staudte film, it had completed two other feature films using the former Tobis studio facilities in Berlin and the Althoff Studios in Babelsberg. Subsequently, its principal studio was the Babelsberg Studio built by Ufa in the 1920s.\n\nThe DEFA was controlled by the Soviets. On 14 July 1947, the company officially moved its headquarters to the Babelsberg Studio, and on 13 November 1947, the company's 'stock' was taken over by the Socialist Unity Party or SED, which had originally capitalised DEFA, and pro-Soviet German individuals. Soviets Ilya Trauberg and Aleksandr Wolkenstein joined Lindemann, Bergmann and Volkmann on the board of directors, and a committee was established under the auspices of the Socialist Unity Party to review projects and screen rushes.\n\nIn July 1948, Lindemann was dismissed from the board of directors because of alleged 'financial irregularities' and replaced briefly by Walter Janka. In October 1948, the SED was instrumental in replacing Janka, Volkmann and Bergmann as corporate directors with official party members Wilhelm Meissner, Alexander Lösche and Grete Keilson. In December, the death of Trauberg and the resignation of Wolkenstein resulted in two more Soviets in their stead, Aleksandr Andriyevsky and Leonid Antonov.\n\nIn 1948, the division of Germany into zones controlled by the Soviet Union and by the Western Allies came into effect. The SED eventually became openly Communist, with a strong Stalinist orientation. On 23 May 1949, the Allies' Germany officially became the Federal Republic of Germany (commonly known as West Germany), and on 7 October 1949, the Soviet zone officially became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). All DEFA interests were incorporated into the new nation as its 'people's' film monopoly according to the strictures of Stalinist Communism and socialist realism, and effectively an arm of the government.\n\nIn 1949 director Kurt Maetzig and the writer Friedrich Wolf exposed the close connections between the Nazis and the giant chemical company IG Farben in the film Der Rat der Götter/The Council of the Gods (Kurt Maetzig, 1950). Wolfgang Staudte's Der Untertan/Man of Straw (1951) was a scathing satire of German philistinism based on the novel by Heinrich Mann. The film was banned in West Germany for years.\n\nThis era at the DEFA came to a close around 1950, when the cultured, more liberal Soviet film officers and inspectors left the country after the founding of the GDR. The DEFA was taken over by German Stalinists like hardliner Sepp Schwab, who was appointed director-general of DEFA on 23 June 1950.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, no. no. 4213/447, 1957.

The story, written by Anne Geelhaar, was based on a variation of 'Hurleburlebutz' by the Brothers Grimm. Bodenstein played a beautiful but selfish and haughty princess who rejects the proposal of a wealthy prince (Eckart Dux). After its release in East Germany, the film sold almost 6 million tickets in the country of about 17 million.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Filmvertrieb, no. 966, 1959.

He also became known in East-Germany as a jazz singer. In 1977, he returned to West-Germany, where he became a popular TV star.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Filmvertrieb, Berlin, no. 1329 F, 1960.

She worked with important directors like Frank Beyer, Heiner Carow and Kurt Maetzig. After the film Der Frühling braucht Zeit/Spring Takes Time (Günter Stahnke, 1965) was banned, the promising film career of the fresh and girly actress stalled.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, Berlin, no. 1649, 1961.

She became a superstar through her role as the young mother Paula in the cult classic Die Legende von Paul und Paula/The Legend of Paul and Paula (Heiner Carow, 1973).\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Filmvertrieb, Berlin, no. 1684, 1962.

She was famous for her work at Bertolt Brecht's theatre group, the Berliner Ensemble. She was a diseuse (singing actress) in the tradition established by Lotte Lenya and Marlene Dietrich, and expert interpreter of the work of Brecht, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Kurt Tucholsky, and Jacques Brel. She also appeared in several DEFA productions and a few international films.\n\nThe definition of desirable and acceptable themes for films becoming narrower\n\nHans Michael Bock at Filmportal.de: \"The DEFA was based on the kind of traditional studio structure used in the Ufa and in Hollywood of the 1930s, but with one crucial difference: in Hollywood and even in Nazi Germany a number of production companies existed in competition, while in the GDR there was only one, and it was controlled by state and party functionaries, with the Hauptverwaltung Film playing the crucial role from 1954 onward. The official policy was to hire no directors or screenwriters tainted by association with National Socialist propaganda films. However, those who had worked in a 'merely' technical capacity during that period were welcome.\"\n\nIn the tradition of all major studios, the DEFA Studios in Potsdam-Babelsberg (the former 'Ufa city') had professionals in nearly all branches of the film industry on its payroll: screenwriters, directors, scenographers, cameramen, technicians and even an ensemble of actors. The result was a high level of technical expertise, especially in the field of set design, where the old German tradition of masters and apprentices continued to flourish.\n\nOn the other hand, artistic freedom and risk-taking was limited. As Soviet-Communist-Stalinist influences took hold at DEFA, the definition of desirable and acceptable themes for films became narrower. In June 1947, a film writer's conference held in Potsdam produced general agreement that the 'new' German cinema would disavow both subjects and stylistic elements reminiscent of those seen on German screens during, and prior to, the Nazi era. By 1949, expectations for scripts were codified around a small number of topics, such as '[re-]distribution of land' or 'the two-year plan'. As in the Soviet Union, the excessive control placed by the state on authors of screenplays, as against other literary works, discouraged many competent writers from contributing to East German film.\n\nIn 1951, Das Beil von Wandsbek/The Axe of Wandsbek (Falk Harnack, 1951), based on Arnold Zweig's novel written in exile, was banned . The DEFA production was not released until 1962, heavily edited. Erwin Geschonneck's nuanced portrayal of a butcher who becomes a Nazi executioner was out of step with the official policy of depicting moral issues in black and white. With the ban on Das Beil von Wandsbek, a brief five-year period which had produced several classics of German cinema drew to a close.\n\nScreenwriters could find their efforts rejected for ideological reasons at any stage in script development, if not from the outset. The Cold War only made the Communist leaders tighten their grip on 'their' films. The DEFA's production reached an absolute statistical nadir in 1952 and 1953, with only five films produced in each year. As a result, between 1948 and 1953, when Stalin died, the entire film output for East Germany, excluding newsreels and non-theatrical educational films, amounted to fewer than 50 titles.\n\nThe best-known film made in this period was Kurt Maetzig's two-part Thälmann – Sohn seiner Klasse / Führer seiner Klasse/Thälmann – Son of His Class / Leader of His Class (1953-1955) – a propagandistic portrait of the German Communist leader who was active in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nEarly on the DEFA made a policy of presenting the GDR as heir to Germany's best cultural traditions. In this spirit it produced adaptations of familiar fairy tales and filmed German literary classics such as Emilia Galotti (1957), Kabale und Liebe/Intrigue and Love (1959), Die schwarze Galeere/The Black Galley (1962) and Minna von Barnhelm (1962), all by theatre director Martin Hellberg.\n\nThe popular fairy-tale films include Paul Verhoeven's Das kalte Herz/Heart of Stone/The Cold Heart (1950), DEFA's first colour film, Wolfgang Staudte's Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck/The Story of Little Mook (1953) and Das tapfere Schneiderlein/The Brave Little Tailor (Helmut Spieß, 1956). This tradition of fairy-tale and children's films was successfully carried on to the very end of the DEFA.\n\nIn the 1960s, DEFA produced the popular Eastern Die Söhne der großen Bärin/The Sons of Great Bear (Josef Mach, 1965), based on the novel by Lieselotte Welskopf-Henrich. It starred Serbian actor Gojko Mitić as the Sioux Tokei-itho. This spawned a number of sequels. The Eastern was the typical Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. It was notable for inverting Western cliches by portraying the native Americans as the 'good guys', and the American army as the 'baddies'\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, Berlin, no. 1910, 1963, Retail price: 0,20 DM.

At 50, he had to emigrate to West-Germany where he found work with such major film directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Later he had a successful career in Hollywood as well.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, no. 2265, 1965. Retail price: 0,15 MDN.

The handsome star played in numerous Westerns from East-Germany between 1966 and 1984. He also worked as a director, stuntman, and author.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, Berlin, no. 2.551, 1966. Retail price: 0,20 DM. Photo: Pathenheimer / DEFA.

She played the sister of the young Dakota Indian chief Tokei-ihto (Gojko Mitic). One of her other major films was the first film about the Berlin wall … Und deine Liebe auch/... And your love too (1962, Frank Vogel) with Armin Mueller-Stahl. After marrying Jürgen Frohriep, she gave up acting and studied psychology.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Film-Vertrieb, Berlin, no. 221/69. Photo: publicity still for Spur des Falken/Trail of the Falcon (Gottfried Kolditz, 1968).\n\nRolf Hoppe (1930) played villains in many ‘Osterns’ by the DEFA. An example is Spur des Falken/Trail of the Falcon (Gottfried Kolditz, 1968), starring Gojko Mitic as the Indian hero. Hoppe also appeared in other Mitic films, Weiße Wölfe/White Wolves (Konrad Petzold, Bosko Boskovic, 1969), one of the most popular DEFA films ever, and Tödlicher Irrtum/Fatal Error (Konrad Petzold, 1970), also with Armin Müller-Stahl. In 1971, Hoppe was awarded the National Prize of East Germany for artistic achievement.\n\nA large pool of outstanding actors\n\nDEFA is associated with a host of important and influential directors, including Frank Beyer, Wolfgang Staudte, Kurt Maetzig, Konrad Wolf, and Heiner Carow. Yet it was difficult to become a director without following a strictly predefined path which included attending the Babelsberg Film Academy, founded in 1954 as the Deutsche Hochschule für Filmkunst (German Academy for Film).\n\nAt the same time, the DEFA managed to get many of the country's major writers involved in film projects: Christa Wolf, Klaus Schlesinger, Fritz Rudolf Fries. Others like Günther Rücker and Jurek Becker worked as freelance or salaried screenwriters. With a large pool of outstanding actors at its disposal (most of them from East Berlin theatres), the DEFA produced first-rate film actors, some of whom – such as Manfred Krug,Armin Mueller-Stahl, Angelica Domröse and Jutta Hoffmann– became stars whose popularity endured even after their defection to the west.\n\nEast Germany's most popular star was Erwin Geschonneck. As a communist in Nazi Germany, he was forced to emigrate, only to be extradited to the Nazis by the USSR, after which he survived several years in a concentration camp. After the war he worked with Bertolt Brecht at the Berliner Ensemble. On several occasions he used his influence to lift the prohibition on blacklisted films (his own included).\n\nIn the 1980s the GDR opened its film market to western productions, one of the major factors leading to a crisis at the DEFA. Finally, the end came with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. In 1992, DEFA was officially dissolved and its combined studios sold to a French conglomerate, Compagnie Générale des Eaux, later Vivendi"
