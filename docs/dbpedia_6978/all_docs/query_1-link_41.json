A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.\n\nEnter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants\n\nAEGEON\n\nProceed, Solinus, to procure my fall\n\nAnd by the doom of death end woes and all.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nMerchant of Syracuse, plead no more;\n\nI am not partial to infringe our laws:\n\nThe enmity and discord which of late\n\nSprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke\n\nTo merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,\n\nWho wanting guilders to redeem their lives\n\nHave seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,\n\nExcludes all pity from our threatening looks.\n\nFor, since the mortal and intestine jars\n\n'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,\n\nIt hath in solemn synods been decreed\n\nBoth by the Syracusians and ourselves,\n\nTo admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,\n\nIf any born at Ephesus be seen\n\nAt any Syracusian marts and fairs;\n\nAgain: if any Syracusian born\n\nCome to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,\n\nHis goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,\n\nUnless a thousand marks be levied,\n\nTo quit the penalty and to ransom him.\n\nThy substance, valued at the highest rate,\n\nCannot amount unto a hundred marks;\n\nTherefore by law thou art condemned to die.\n\nAEGEON\n\nYet this my comfort: when your words are done,\n\nMy woes end likewise with the evening sun.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nWell, Syracusian, say in brief the cause\n\nWhy thou departed'st from thy native home\n\nAnd for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.\n\nAEGEON\n\nA heavier task could not have been imposed\n\nThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable:\n\nYet, that the world may witness that my end\n\nWas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,\n\nI'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.\n\nIn Syracusa was I born, and wed\n\nUnto a woman, happy but for me,\n\nAnd by me, had not our hap been bad.\n\nWith her I lived in joy; our wealth increased\n\nBy prosperous voyages I often made\n\nTo Epidamnum; till my factor's death\n\nAnd the great care of goods at random left\n\nDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse:\n\nFrom whom my absence was not six months old\n\nBefore herself, almost at fainting under\n\nThe pleasing punishment that women bear,\n\nHad made provision for her following me\n\nAnd soon and safe arrived where I was.\n\nThere had she not been long, but she became\n\nA joyful mother of two goodly sons;\n\nAnd, which was strange, the one so like the other,\n\nAs could not be distinguish'd but by names.\n\nThat very hour, and in the self-same inn,\n\nA meaner woman was delivered\n\nOf such a burden, male twins, both alike:\n\nThose,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--\n\nI bought and brought up to attend my sons.\n\nMy wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\n\nMade daily motions for our home return:\n\nUnwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,\n\nWe came aboard.\n\nA league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,\n\nBefore the always wind-obeying deep\n\nGave any tragic instance of our harm:\n\nBut longer did we not retain much hope;\n\nFor what obscured light the heavens did grant\n\nDid but convey unto our fearful minds\n\nA doubtful warrant of immediate death;\n\nWhich though myself would gladly have embraced,\n\nYet the incessant weepings of my wife,\n\nWeeping before for what she saw must come,\n\nAnd piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\n\nThat mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\n\nForced me to seek delays for them and me.\n\nAnd this it was, for other means was none:\n\nThe sailors sought for safety by our boat,\n\nAnd left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:\n\nMy wife, more careful for the latter-born,\n\nHad fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,\n\nSuch as seafaring men provide for storms;\n\nTo him one of the other twins was bound,\n\nWhilst I had been like heedful of the other:\n\nThe children thus disposed, my wife and I,\n\nFixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,\n\nFasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;\n\nAnd floating straight, obedient to the stream,\n\nWas carried towards Corinth, as we thought.\n\nAt length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\n\nDispersed those vapours that offended us;\n\nAnd by the benefit of his wished light,\n\nThe seas wax'd calm, and we discovered\n\nTwo ships from far making amain to us,\n\nOf Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:\n\nBut ere they came,--O, let me say no more!\n\nGather the sequel by that went before.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nNay, forward, old man; do not break off so;\n\nFor we may pity, though not pardon thee.\n\nAEGEON\n\nO, had the gods done so, I had not now\n\nWorthily term'd them merciless to us!\n\nFor, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\n\nWe were encounterd by a mighty rock;\n\nWhich being violently borne upon,\n\nOur helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\n\nSo that, in this unjust divorce of us,\n\nFortune had left to both of us alike\n\nWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.\n\nHer part, poor soul! seeming as burdened\n\nWith lesser weight but not with lesser woe,\n\nWas carried with more speed before the wind;\n\nAnd in our sight they three were taken up\n\nBy fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.\n\nAt length, another ship had seized on us;\n\nAnd, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\n\nGave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;\n\nAnd would have reft the fishers of their prey,\n\nHad not their bark been very slow of sail;\n\nAnd therefore homeward did they bend their course.\n\nThus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;\n\nThat by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,\n\nTo tell sad stories of my own mishaps.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,\n\nDo me the favour to dilate at full\n\nWhat hath befall'n of them and thee till now.\n\nAEGEON\n\nMy youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,\n\nAt eighteen years became inquisitive\n\nAfter his brother: and importuned me\n\nThat his attendant--so his case was like,\n\nReft of his brother, but retain'd his name--\n\nMight bear him company in the quest of him:\n\nWhom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,\n\nI hazarded the loss of whom I loved.\n\nFive summers have I spent in furthest Greece,\n\nRoaming clean through the bounds of Asia,\n\nAnd, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;\n\nHopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought\n\nOr that or any place that harbours men.\n\nBut here must end the story of my life;\n\nAnd happy were I in my timely death,\n\nCould all my travels warrant me they live.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nHapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd\n\nTo bear the extremity of dire mishap!\n\nNow, trust me, were it not against our laws,\n\nAgainst my crown, my oath, my dignity,\n\nWhich princes, would they, may not disannul,\n\nMy soul would sue as advocate for thee.\n\nBut, though thou art adjudged to the death\n\nAnd passed sentence may not be recall'd\n\nBut to our honour's great disparagement,\n\nYet I will favour thee in what I can.\n\nTherefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day\n\nTo seek thy life by beneficial help:\n\nTry all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;\n\nBeg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,\n\nAnd live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.\n\nGaoler, take him to thy custody.\n\nGaoler\n\nI will, my lord.\n\nAEGEON\n\nHopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,\n\nBut to procrastinate his lifeless end.\n\nExeunt\n\nSCENE II. The Mart.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant\n\nFirst Merchant\n\nTherefore give out you are of Epidamnum,\n\nLest that your goods too soon be confiscate.\n\nThis very day a Syracusian merchant\n\nIs apprehended for arrival here;\n\nAnd not being able to buy out his life\n\nAccording to the statute of the town,\n\nDies ere the weary sun set in the west.\n\nThere is your money that I had to keep.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nGo bear it to the Centaur, where we host,\n\nAnd stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.\n\nWithin this hour it will be dinner-time:\n\nTill that, I'll view the manners of the town,\n\nPeruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,\n\nAnd then return and sleep within mine inn,\n\nFor with long travel I am stiff and weary.\n\nGet thee away.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nMany a man would take you at your word,\n\nAnd go indeed, having so good a mean.\n\nExit\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nA trusty villain, sir, that very oft,\n\nWhen I am dull with care and melancholy,\n\nLightens my humour with his merry jests.\n\nWhat, will you walk with me about the town,\n\nAnd then go to my inn and dine with me?\n\nFirst Merchant\n\nI am invited, sir, to certain merchants,\n\nOf whom I hope to make much benefit;\n\nI crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,\n\nPlease you, I'll meet with you upon the mart\n\nAnd afterward consort you till bed-time:\n\nMy present business calls me from you now.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nFarewell till then: I will go lose myself\n\nAnd wander up and down to view the city.\n\nFirst Merchant\n\nSir, I commend you to your own content.\n\nExit\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nHe that commends me to mine own content\n\nCommends me to the thing I cannot get.\n\nI to the world am like a drop of water\n\nThat in the ocean seeks another drop,\n\nWho, falling there to find his fellow forth,\n\nUnseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:\n\nSo I, to find a mother and a brother,\n\nIn quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.\n\nEnter DROMIO of Ephesus\n\nHere comes the almanac of my true date.\n\nWhat now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nReturn'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:\n\nThe capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,\n\nThe clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;\n\nMy mistress made it one upon my cheek:\n\nShe is so hot because the meat is cold;\n\nThe meat is cold because you come not home;\n\nYou come not home because you have no stomach;\n\nYou have no stomach having broke your fast;\n\nBut we that know what 'tis to fast and pray\n\nAre penitent for your default to-day.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nStop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:\n\nWhere have you left the money that I gave you?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nO,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last\n\nTo pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?\n\nThe saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nI am not in a sportive humour now:\n\nTell me, and dally not, where is the money?\n\nWe being strangers here, how darest thou trust\n\nSo great a charge from thine own custody?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nI pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:\n\nI from my mistress come to you in post;\n\nIf I return, I shall be post indeed,\n\nFor she will score your fault upon my pate.\n\nMethinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,\n\nAnd strike you home without a messenger.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nCome, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;\n\nReserve them till a merrier hour than this.\n\nWhere is the gold I gave in charge to thee?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nTo me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nCome on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,\n\nAnd tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nMy charge was but to fetch you from the mart\n\nHome to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:\n\nMy mistress and her sister stays for you.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nIn what safe place you have bestow'd my money,\n\nOr I shall break that merry sconce of yours\n\nThat stands on tricks when I am undisposed:\n\nWhere is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nI have some marks of yours upon my pate,\n\nSome of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,\n\nBut not a thousand marks between you both.\n\nIf I should pay your worship those again,\n\nPerchance you will not bear them patiently.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nThy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nYour worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;\n\nShe that doth fast till you come home to dinner,\n\nAnd prays that you will hie you home to dinner.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nWhat, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,\n\nBeing forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nWhat mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!\n\nNay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.\n\nExit\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nUpon my life, by some device or other\n\nThe villain is o'er-raught of all my money.\n\nThey say this town is full of cozenage,\n\nAs, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,\n\nDark-working sorcerers that change the mind,\n\nSoul-killing witches that deform the body,\n\nDisguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,\n\nAnd many such-like liberties of sin:\n\nIf it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.\n\nI'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:\n\nI greatly fear my money is not safe.\n\nExit\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.\n\nEnter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n\nADRIANA\n\nNeither my husband nor the slave return'd,\n\nThat in such haste I sent to seek his master!\n\nSure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nPerhaps some merchant hath invited him,\n\nAnd from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.\n\nGood sister, let us dine and never fret:\n\nA man is master of his liberty:\n\nTime is their master, and, when they see time,\n\nThey'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.\n\nADRIANA\n\nWhy should their liberty than ours be more?\n\nLUCIANA\n\nBecause their business still lies out o' door.\n\nADRIANA\n\nLook, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nO, know he is the bridle of your will.\n\nADRIANA\n\nThere's none but asses will be bridled so.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nWhy, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.\n\nThere's nothing situate under heaven's eye\n\nBut hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:\n\nThe beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,\n\nAre their males' subjects and at their controls:\n\nMen, more divine, the masters of all these,\n\nLords of the wide world and wild watery seas,\n\nIndued with intellectual sense and souls,\n\nOf more preeminence than fish and fowls,\n\nAre masters to their females, and their lords:\n\nThen let your will attend on their accords.\n\nADRIANA\n\nThis servitude makes you to keep unwed.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nNot this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.\n\nADRIANA\n\nBut, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nEre I learn love, I'll practise to obey.\n\nADRIANA\n\nHow if your husband start some other where?\n\nLUCIANA\n\nTill he come home again, I would forbear.\n\nADRIANA\n\nPatience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;\n\nThey can be meek that have no other cause.\n\nA wretched soul, bruised with adversity,\n\nWe bid be quiet when we hear it cry;\n\nBut were we burdened with like weight of pain,\n\nAs much or more would we ourselves complain:\n\nSo thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,\n\nWith urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,\n\nBut, if thou live to see like right bereft,\n\nThis fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nWell, I will marry one day, but to try.\n\nHere comes your man; now is your husband nigh.\n\nEnter DROMIO of Ephesus\n\nADRIANA\n\nSay, is your tardy master now at hand?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nNay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears\n\ncan witness.\n\nADRIANA\n\nSay, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nAy, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:\n\nBeshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nSpake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nNay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his\n\nblows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce\n\nunderstand them.\n\nADRIANA\n\nBut say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he\n\nhath great care to please his wife.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nWhy, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.\n\nADRIANA\n\nHorn-mad, thou villain!\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nI mean not cuckold-mad;\n\nBut, sure, he is stark mad.\n\nWhen I desired him to come home to dinner,\n\nHe ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:\n\n''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;\n\n'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:\n\n'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.\n\n'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'\n\n'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:\n\n'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!\n\nI know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'\n\nLUCIANA\n\nQuoth who?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nQuoth my master:\n\n'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'\n\nSo that my errand, due unto my tongue,\n\nI thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;\n\nFor, in conclusion, he did beat me there.\n\nADRIANA\n\nGo back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nGo back again, and be new beaten home?\n\nFor God's sake, send some other messenger.\n\nADRIANA\n\nBack, slave, or I will break thy pate across.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nAnd he will bless that cross with other beating:\n\nBetween you I shall have a holy head.\n\nADRIANA\n\nHence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nAm I so round with you as you with me,\n\nThat like a football you do spurn me thus?\n\nYou spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:\n\nIf I last in this service, you must case me in leather.\n\nExit\n\nLUCIANA\n\nFie, how impatience loureth in your face!\n\nADRIANA\n\nHis company must do his minions grace,\n\nWhilst I at home starve for a merry look.\n\nHath homely age the alluring beauty took\n\nFrom my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:\n\nAre my discourses dull? barren my wit?\n\nIf voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,\n\nUnkindness blunts it more than marble hard:\n\nDo their gay vestments his affections bait?\n\nThat's not my fault: he's master of my state:\n\nWhat ruins are in me that can be found,\n\nBy him not ruin'd? then is he the ground\n\nOf my defeatures. My decayed fair\n\nA sunny look of his would soon repair\n\nBut, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale\n\nAnd feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nSelf-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!\n\nADRIANA\n\nUnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.\n\nI know his eye doth homage otherwhere,\n\nOr else what lets it but he would be here?\n\nSister, you know he promised me a chain;\n\nWould that alone, alone he would detain,\n\nSo he would keep fair quarter with his bed!\n\nI see the jewel best enamelled\n\nWill lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,\n\nThat others touch, and often touching will\n\nWear gold: and no man that hath a name,\n\nBy falsehood and corruption doth it shame.\n\nSince that my beauty cannot please his eye,\n\nI'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.\n\nLUCIANA\n\nHow many fond fools serve mad jealousy!\n\nExeunt\n\nSCENE II. A public place.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nThe gold I gave to Dromio is laid up\n\nSafe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave\n\nIs wander'd forth, in care to seek me out\n\nBy computation and mine host's report.\n\nI could not speak with Dromio since at first\n\nI sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.\n\nEnter DROMIO of Syracuse\n\nHow now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?\n\nAs you love strokes, so jest with me again.\n\nYou know no Centaur? you received no gold?\n\nYour mistress sent to have me home to dinner?\n\nMy house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,\n\nThat thus so madly thou didst answer me?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nWhat answer, sir? when spake I such a word?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nEven now, even here, not half an hour since.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nI did not see you since you sent me hence,\n\nHome to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nVillain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,\n\nAnd told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;\n\nFor which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nI am glad to see you in this merry vein:\n\nWhat means this jest?

Along with them\n\nThey brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,\n\nA mere anatomy, a mountebank,\n\nA threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,\n\nA needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,\n\nA dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,\n\nForsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\n\nAnd, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\n\nAnd with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,\n\nCries out, I was possess'd. Then all together\n\nThey fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence\n\nAnd in a dark and dankish vault at home\n\nThere left me and my man, both bound together;\n\nTill, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,\n\nI gain'd my freedom, and immediately\n\nRan hither to your grace; whom I beseech\n\nTo give me ample satisfaction\n\nFor these deep shames and great indignities.\n\nANGELO\n\nMy lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,\n\nThat he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nBut had he such a chain of thee or no?\n\nANGELO\n\nHe had, my lord: and when he ran in here,\n\nThese people saw the chain about his neck.\n\nSecond Merchant\n\nBesides, I will be sworn these ears of mine\n\nHeard you confess you had the chain of him\n\nAfter you first forswore it on the mart:\n\nAnd thereupon I drew my sword on you;\n\nAnd then you fled into this abbey here,\n\nFrom whence, I think, you are come by miracle.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nI never came within these abbey-walls,\n\nNor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:\n\nI never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!\n\nAnd this is false you burden me withal.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nWhy, what an intricate impeach is this!\n\nI think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.\n\nIf here you housed him, here he would have been;\n\nIf he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:\n\nYou say he dined at home; the goldsmith here\n\nDenies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nSir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.\n\nCourtezan\n\nHe did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\n'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nSaw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?\n\nCourtezan\n\nAs sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nWhy, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.\n\nI think you are all mated or stark mad.\n\nExit one to Abbess\n\nAEGEON\n\nMost mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:\n\nHaply I see a friend will save my life\n\nAnd pay the sum that may deliver me.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nSpeak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.\n\nAEGEON\n\nIs not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?\n\nAnd is not that your bondman, Dromio?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nWithin this hour I was his bondman sir,\n\nBut he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:\n\nNow am I Dromio and his man unbound.\n\nAEGEON\n\nI am sure you both of you remember me.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nOurselves we do remember, sir, by you;\n\nFor lately we were bound, as you are now\n\nYou are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?\n\nAEGEON\n\nWhy look you strange on me? you know me well.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nI never saw you in my life till now.\n\nAEGEON\n\nO, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,\n\nAnd careful hours with time's deformed hand\n\nHave written strange defeatures in my face:\n\nBut tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nNeither.\n\nAEGEON\n\nDromio, nor thou?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nNo, trust me, sir, nor I.\n\nAEGEON\n\nI am sure thou dost.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nAy, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a\n\nman denies, you are now bound to believe him.\n\nAEGEON\n\nNot know my voice! O time's extremity,\n\nHast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue\n\nIn seven short years, that here my only son\n\nKnows not my feeble key of untuned cares?\n\nThough now this grained face of mine be hid\n\nIn sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,\n\nAnd all the conduits of my blood froze up,\n\nYet hath my night of life some memory,\n\nMy wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,\n\nMy dull deaf ears a little use to hear:\n\nAll these old witnesses--I cannot err--\n\nTell me thou art my son Antipholus.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nI never saw my father in my life.\n\nAEGEON\n\nBut seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,\n\nThou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,\n\nThou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nThe duke and all that know me in the city\n\nCan witness with me that it is not so\n\nI ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nI tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years\n\nHave I been patron to Antipholus,\n\nDuring which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:\n\nI see thy age and dangers make thee dote.\n\nRe-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse\n\nAEMELIA ADRIANA\n\nI see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nOne of these men is Genius to the other;\n\nAnd so of these. Which is the natural man,\n\nAnd which the spirit? who deciphers them?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nI, sir, am Dromio; command him away.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nI, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nAEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nO, my old master! who hath bound him here?\n\nAEMELIA\n\nWhoever bound him, I will loose his bonds\n\nAnd gain a husband by his liberty.\n\nSpeak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man\n\nThat hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia\n\nThat bore thee at a burden two fair sons:\n\nO, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,\n\nAnd speak unto the same AEmilia!\n\nAEGEON\n\nIf I dream not, thou art AEmilia:\n\nIf thou art she, tell me where is that son\n\nThat floated with thee on the fatal raft?\n\nAEMELIA\n\nBy men of Epidamnum he and I\n\nAnd the twin Dromio all were taken up;\n\nBut by and by rude fishermen of Corinth\n\nBy force took Dromio and my son from them\n\nAnd me they left with those of Epidamnum.\n\nWhat then became of them I cannot tell\n\nI to this fortune that you see me in.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nWhy, here begins his morning story right;\n\nThese two Antipholuses, these two so like,\n\nAnd these two Dromios, one in semblance,--\n\nBesides her urging of her wreck at sea,--\n\nThese are the parents to these children,\n\nWhich accidentally are met together.\n\nAntipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nNo, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nStay, stand apart; I know not which is which.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nI came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nAnd I with him.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nBrought to this town by that most famous warrior,\n\nDuke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.\n\nADRIANA\n\nWhich of you two did dine with me to-day?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nI, gentle mistress.\n\nADRIANA\n\nAnd are not you my husband?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nNo; I say nay to that.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nAnd so do I; yet did she call me so:\n\nAnd this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,\n\nDid call me brother.\n\nTo Luciana\n\nWhat I told you then,\n\nI hope I shall have leisure to make good;\n\nIf this be not a dream I see and hear.\n\nANGELO\n\nThat is the chain, sir, which you had of me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nI think it be, sir; I deny it not.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nAnd you, sir, for this chain arrested me.\n\nANGELO\n\nI think I did, sir; I deny it not.\n\nADRIANA\n\nI sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\n\nBy Dromio; but I think he brought it not.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nNo, none by me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE\n\nThis purse of ducats I received from you,\n\nAnd Dromio, my man, did bring them me.\n\nI see we still did meet each other's man,\n\nAnd I was ta'en for him, and he for me,\n\nAnd thereupon these errors are arose.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nThese ducats pawn I for my father here.\n\nDUKE SOLINUS\n\nIt shall not need; thy father hath his life.\n\nCourtezan\n\nSir, I must have that diamond from you.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nThere, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.\n\nAEMELIA\n\nRenowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains\n\nTo go with us into the abbey here\n\nAnd hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:\n\nAnd all that are assembled in this place,\n\nThat by this sympathized one day's error\n\nHave suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,\n\nAnd we shall make full satisfaction.\n\nThirty-three years have I but gone in travail\n\nOf you, my sons; and till this present hour\n\nMy heavy burden ne'er delivered.\n\nThe duke, my husband and my children both,\n\nAnd you the calendars of their nativity,\n\nGo to a gossips' feast and go with me;\n\nAfter so long grief, such festivity!\n\nDUKE SOLINUS DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nMaster, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF EPHESUS\n\nDromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nYour goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.\n\nANTIPHOLUS\n\nOF SYRACUSE DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nThere is a fat friend at your master's house,\n\nThat kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:\n\nShe now shall be my sister, not my wife.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nMethinks you are my glass, and not my brother:\n\nI see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.\n\nWill you walk in to see their gossiping?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nNot I, sir; you are my elder.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nThat's a question: how shall we try it?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nWe'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS"
