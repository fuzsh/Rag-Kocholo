The result depended crucially, however, on their cooperation with non-Jewish German colleagues: notably the designers Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig, who drew on the example of Expressionist painters and graphic artists to fashion the look of the film, with its psychological and social implications; the cameraman Willy Hameister and his team of lighting experts; and a group of actors, notably Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt, who fitted their appearance and movement to the non-naturalistic décor with a sure feeling for the expressive possibilities of the early cinema. Much of the inspiration of the screenplay derived from experience of the war with its senseless killings, and from sinister encounters with doctors, psychiatrists and arrogant authority figures. It also mirrored the psychological disorientation of a defeated nation deprived of many of its younger men, and faced with foreign occupation, loss of colonies, excessive demands by the victors, and internal struggles about the political reorganisation of the new state. At the same time, however, Caligari, like many other films of the period, drew on that fascination with the dark and uncanny which had been a feature of German cultural expression ever since the Romantic movement, where it had found its most influential but by no means sole exponent in the tales of E.T.A. Hoffmann. The malevolent hypnotist and his somnambulistic victim are distinctly Hoffmannesque figures. These were social and cultural experiences Jews and non-Jews could share; but Jews could also bring to the film cultural experiences of their own along with memories of persecution, discrimination, suspicious ostracism, and inter-Jewish divisions, over many centuries. Caligari has been the subject of much debate, and many critics have pointed out how central its motif of the demonic fair is to the early German cinema. It reminds us, along with the associated motifs of magicians, hypnotists and montreurs d’ombres, of the fairground venues in which films were originally shown, of the fantastic magical tricks in movies made by\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nMéliès, and of the power exercised by those who could manipulate and control images. Here as elsewhere, German films are often self-reflexive. I have set out my own views on Caligari in two books named in the Bibliography of the present study, and won’t reiterate them here. I would, however, like to restate my conviction that it is a mistake to interpret everything said or shown before 1933 in the light of Nazi racism and genocide. There is no straight line that leads from Caligari to Hitler. What matters in my present context is that despite anti–Semitic snipings, the young film industry in Germany and Austria saw harmonious cooperation between Jewish and non-Jewish men and women, born in the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires and beyond, who worked in the last days of those Empires and in the Republics that succeeded them. Such cooperation and interplay I take to have been an essential part of the creative force which produced the distinctive forms German and Austrian cinema took before it was deprived of its Jewish talents by the catastrophic advent of a Nazi government. Within these parameters the present book seeks to concentrate attention on the involvement of men and women with Jewish ancestry in German and Austrian films before their expulsion. It will seek to show, with selected examples, some of the ways in which Jews participated in the manifold work needed to create a film: as producers, directors, writers, cinematographers, designers and actors – in harmony with non-Jewish colleagues amid a spattering of voices raised to discriminate between them, imputing commercially inspired sensationalism and alleged moral turpitude solely to Jewish influence. It will analyse films that treat problems of Jewish individuals and communities in different historic circumstances and in forms that range from satiric comedy to stark tragedy, while also showing gradations of Jewish attitudes and behaviour from religious orthodoxy and social separation to integration and acculturation in the social fabric of Berlin and Vienna. The play of inter-Jewish as well as Jewish–Gentile tensions and sympathies will come into view, alongside Jewish humour and self-irony; a Jewish sense of justice leading to battles against social and legal iniquities; and historical memories of persecution and discrimination resonating in later and apparently more enlightened days. For understandable commercial reasons most of the films treated in this book were made in German studios, even where the directors and other members of the team hailed from Austrian dominions, or the films were set in Austrian lands. Something needs therefore to be said, by way of introduction, about the distinctive nature of a film industry that began in the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and sent many of its finest artists to enrich the cinema of a wider world. Historians of the cinema in Austria have documented how interest in the new art came to rival traditional interests in opera and operetta; its beginnings with Saturn and Sascha Films; and the way directors, actors and scriptwriters commuted between Austria and Germany, or moved to\n\nPreface ix\n\nGermany entirely, since Berlin in particular offered greater studio and capital resources, as well as distributors who supplied a wider market. In our special context it is noteworthy that the Austro-Hungarian dominions were the birthplace of many Jewish directors who later achieved German, or world-wide, fame; they included such figures as Alexander Korda, Billy Wilder, Michael Curtiz, Josef von Sternberg and Otto Preminger. The Austrian Emperor Franz Josef was among the early customers of the Cinematograph in Vienna’s Kärtnerstrasse, and, like the German Emperor Wilhelm II (whose vacation journeys were captured in ‘living photographs’ by the Jewish entrepreneur Jules Greenbaum) he was glad to have himself and his entourage filmed by professional cinematographers. Count Alexander Kolowrat-Krokowski’s Sascha was soon succeeded by Wiener Kunstfilm (which became Vita Film in 1918), Vindobona Film and others; and historians have counted some three hundred feature films produced in Austria by the end of the First World War. Production rose to a peak between 1918 and 1922, where it averaged about one hundred twenty films a year, and reduced to some twenty-four films a year once soundfilms replaced the earlier ‘silents’. Genres particularly favoured were biographies of musicians, plots constructed around popular singers like Richard Tauber, Martha Eggerth and Jan Kiepura, operettas and revue films, and erotic and slightly world-weary stories, often in opulent settings, directed by – and often starring – Willi Forst. Forst commuted between Vienna and Berlin, as did other actors and directors; and many Wienfilme were made in German studios. These were not always set in affluent contemporary circles, like Fräulein Else, directed by Paul Czinner in 1929, or a romanticised and sentimentalised Vienna of the past, like Friedrich Hollaender’s Ich und die Kaiserin (1932–33) and Erik Charell’s Der Kongress tanzt (The Congress Dances, 1931). G.W. Pabst’s Die freudlose Gasse (The Joyless Street, 1925) was far from that sort of romanticisation: it showed a contemporary Austria in the grip of financial crisis and social deprivation, with panders and speculators profiting from widespread misery and impoverishment. Besides the Hungarian-born Paul Czinner and Alexander Korda (né Sandor Kellner), ethnically Jewish directors who made films in Vienna included Robert Wiene (Orlacs Hände/Hands of Orlac, 1925) and H.K. Breslauer, whose Die Stadt ohne Juden (The City without Jews, 1924) will be considered in detail in a later chapter. One such director, Richard Oswald, paid musical tribute to his native Vienna in Wien, du Stadt der Lieder (Vienna, City of Song, 1930) and Schuberts Frühlingstraum (Schubert’s Dream of Spring, 1930–31). Like Oswald, however, many other Jewish directors born in Austro-Hungary made films mainly in German studios: Joe May and Karl Grune, for instance; the same is true of Carl Mayer, whose importance for the diegeses of German art films during the ‘silent’ period can hardly be exaggerated; and such actors as Fritz Kortner, Elisabeth Bergner and Peter Lorre. The sharp-tongued, socially critical Viennese cabaret, like\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nits German equivalent, had many Jewish performers, some of whom appeared in Austrian films: Gisela Werbezirk, for instance, and Armin Berg, who specialised in Jewish comedy, can be seen in The City without Jews. Fritz Grünbaum, a famous conférencier and writer of satirical comedy monologues, was featured in Mädchen zum Heiraten (Girls Ripe for Marriage, 1932), and alongside Max Pallenberg in a German film with an Austrian setting, Der brave Sünder (The Virtuous Sinner, 1931), directed by Kortner – a work that will also be considered in some detail later in this book. After the Nazi takeover in Germany a handful of Jewish artists found limited scope for work in Viennese studios; but since Austrian films needed the German market to recoup their costs and make a profit, and Austrian production companies quietly adopted the rules and proscriptions of the controlling German film authority (Reichsfilmkammer), such opportunities soon dried up. It all ceased, in any case, when Austria became part of ‘Greater Germany’ after the Anschluss of 1938. Some of the producers, directors, scriptwriters, actors, composers and designers to be encountered in the following pages will have come from an orthodox Jewish background. Some will have arrived in Vienna or Berlin from Eastern Europe, some (like the Nebenzahl family) via the USA and Britain – but all of them conformed in dress and manner to an emancipated European bourgeoisie and felt themselves part of the society and profession to which they made distinctive contributions alongside Gentile fellow citizens. When the films featured Jewish protagonists, whether in leading or subsidiary parts, these too, despite many differences and gradations, were usually German or Austrian in dress, manner and speech. But the films also showed orthodox Jews, in traditional garb, and with a distinctive culture, in medieval ghettos, and East European towns and villages, or as immigrants living in specific areas of Western cities; often along with characters driven, by love, ambition or desire for secular learning and culture, to leave such sheltering and confining enclosures for the wider vistas offered by Europe or the USA. Both groups are generally presented with sympathy, and Jewish religious ceremonial is depicted with respect; but not all Jews working in the German and Austrian film industry reacted favourably towards encounters with traditionally garbed. Yiddish-speaking East European coreligionists. Fritz Kortner, the son of an assimilated Viennese jeweller, looked with little sympathy on the Moldavian Jews he saw during his service with the Austro-Hungarian army in the First World War: I did not overflow with the sympathy and brotherly feeling I had expected and thought to be my duty. I shied away from these medieval figures in their long caftans, with side-locks on both sides of their face (which seemed grotesque to me) and long beards – and also from their women who wore wigs to cover their own hair. I felt terror before dead Jews killed in a pogrom, and failed to feel kinship with the living. … Assimilation had distanced me\n\nPreface xi\n\ntoo far from them, made me feel a world away from the ghetto and its customs. I sought to further the beauty of the German language, shrank from its mutilation [in Yiddish], and felt frightened away from every absolute adherence to Judaism, including what was then its most modern form – the stirrings of Zionism … (1969: 110–11)\n\nWriting this in the 1950s, Kortner adds: ‘I have learnt to think differently since’ – as did many others after the shock of finding that Nazi racism made no distinction between the emancipated Jews of Berlin and Vienna, and their caftaned, bearded, side-locked and bewigged Eastern brothers and sisters. The inner and outer separation described by Kortner, which I myself came to know all too well in my Cologne childhood – along with the disparagement of that wonderfully expressive medium, the Yiddish language – finds its equivalent in some the films discussed below, where we will also encounter Jewish ‘dog eats dog’ behaviour in the struggle to make a living, and self-aggrandising pretence for the sake of social advancement, among Western Jews. Yet most of the films show traditional Jewish societies and groups without rancour, even though some amusement creeps in occasionally; and Western assimilated Jews who behave in ways that are less than admirable tend to be exhibited in the tongue-in-cheek, self-mocking spirit familiar from Jewish jokes. None of this should be mistaken for the much-touted ‘Jewish self-hatred’. The spirit of Lubitsch is worlds away from that of Otto Weininger. Before their legally sanctioned exclusion from the Volksgemeinschaft, the community of the German nation, it would have been invidious to isolate a ‘Jewish presence’ from Gentile ones in the way I have tried to do in this book. After that injustice, however, and the slanderous denigration that prepared for genocide, the memory of an earlier, fruitful collaboration deserves to be remembered. The loss to the German and Austrian cinema entailed by Nazi racism is paralleled by losses in other fields of the artistic and scientific culture of these countries; a loss painfully felt by many who tried to rebuild German and Austrian cultural life after the Second World War.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI have been a dedicated cinema-goer all my life, and have been able to supplement what I saw in the cinema, and in film-society showings in Germany, England, the USA, Austrialia and New Zealand, through the kindness of the curators and staff of the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek, Berlin (now Filmmuseum Berlin); the National Center for Jewish Film, Brandeis University; Filmarchiv Austria, Vienna; and the British Film Institute. These allowed me to view their holdings, some of which have had to be reconstructed from a number of incomplete versions. Increasingly, too, ‘silent’ and early sound films have been shown in the best available versions on television, and have become purchasable on VHS and DVD. I have made liberal use of all such sources. While basing my argument, wherever possible, on the close analysis of representative films, I have included conspective surveys of various kinds to set these into their social and film-specific contexts. I hope, finally, that my programmatic avoidance of film-theoretical jargon will be understood, not as wilful ignorance, but as a desire to appeal to readers whose interest in Jewish, German and Austrian affairs is not confined to the cinema. My book has profited most from the scrutiny and critiques of my friend and colleague Hans-Michael Bock. Beyond that I am deeply indebted to the writers of the books and essays listed in my Bibliography; to Kevin Brownlow, Horst Claus, Tom Kuhn and Margaret Dériaz; to Jill Hughes of the Taylorian Library; to the archives that provided illustrations and photocopies; and to the Provost and Fellows of The Queen’s College, Oxford, who have constantly supported my work during the many years I have had the privilege of belonging to that distinguished and hospitable company of scholars. For my errors and conclusions, and for uncredited translations from German text, I am alone responsible.\n\nChapter 1\n\nPREPARING THE GROUND\n\nDavidson My father’s fiduciary office had many Jewish clients in the 1920s and 1930s, and from one of them I first heard an anecdote which seems to have lived a wandering life as part of the mythology of cinema entrepreneurship. It tells of the wife of a Jewish shopkeeper who had a toothache and found a dentist willing to give her emergency treatment in a district remote from her own. When she returned, relieved of her toothache, she had some exciting news for her husband: she had seen a queue waiting outside a storefront whose window advertised motion pictures; and those going in handed over money without, as yet, having seen the goods they were paying for. Whether the couple in question actually gave up their shop in order to deal in this unusual type of merchandise – entertainment, enjoyment, dream fulfilment, thrills, experiences transcending the everyday – the anecdote does not say; but many Jews did so, at first as travelling showmen, but very soon as owners or renters of permanent premises, occasionally arranged in the way of cabarets, with tables around which patrons sat eating and drinking while watching the show, but more often with rows of seats arranged in the manner of more prestigious forms of entertainment: the theatre and opera-house. The owners of such ‘Kinematographen-Theater’, (affectionately known as ‘Kientopps’) – Leo Leipziger in Berlin, Rudolf Mosse in Frankfurt, Leo Preiss in Breslau, Albert Lobenstein in Dresden – at first bought rather than hired the short films they showed; but even when hiring became more usual, it was up to the owners to arrange the programmes into a ‘montage of attractions’, hiring a commentator, or pianist, or small instrumental ensemble as the necessary complement of films as yet devoid of sound-tracks. Some films, indeed, particularly the Tonbilder of the Messter Company, came with phonograph records synchronised to accompany the filmed image of a famous singer or actor. Messter himself, one of the most important pioneers of the technical as well as the producing, distributing and exhibiting branches of the early German cinema, was not Jewish; but he had Jewish\n\n2\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nmanagers and associates, including Maxim Galitzenstein who became a director of the Messter Company shortly before the First World War. Among Jewish businessmen fired with enthusiasm for the new opportunities opened up by the invention of the cinema was a traveller in curtain-materials, Paul Davidson, who began with a single shop-front cinema in Frankfurt am Main, but soon expanded his operations to include other German cities, founding a company to manage and control them: the Allgemeine Kinematographische Theatergesellschaft. It was this company which trumped the cinema Messter had built in Berlin in 1905 by opening the Prussian capital’s first ‘cinema-palace’, the Union-Theater on the Alexander-Platz, in 1908. ‘Union’ was also the short name generally given to the company he founded a year later: the Projektions AktienGesellschaft ‘Union’ or PAGU. The offices of this new company, dedicated to producing and distributing films as well as showing them in Davidsonowned and other cinemas, had its first offices in Frankfurt; but it soon became clear that the hub of activity in German cinema was Berlin, and Davidson therefore moved his headquarters there. He had built his first film-making studio on a Frankfurt roof-top; now, in Berlin-Tempelhof, he erected one of the ‘glass-houses’ that enabled early filmmakers to take advantage of natural light streaming in from the top and the sides. The majority of films shown in Germany before the First World War came from abroad – from France, Italy, the USA, and Denmark. Davidson soon realised that in order to compete he had to think and act internationally. He therefore linked up with a star who had already proved her potential for popular appeal in a Danish film – Asta Nielsen – and signed her up along with her director-husband Urban Gad, forming a company called Internationale Vertriebs-Gesellschaft (International Film Sales). Peter Lähn has well described how Davidson attempted, through his two companies, Union (or PAGU) and IVG, to ‘translate the quality formula of his film-theatres into the production sector’. Lähn quotes Davidson himself on the implications of this step, which marked the transition, once and for all, from the age of short films arranged into a ‘montage of attractions’ by individual cinema owners or mangers to that of the longer fiction film, often sold on star or genre value. As Davidson explained: I had not been thinking about film production. But then I saw the first Asta Nielsen film. I realised that the age of the short film was past. And above all I realised that his woman was the first artist in the medium of film. Asta Nielsen, I instantly felt could be a global success. It was ‘International Film Sales’ that provided ‘Union’ with eight Nielsen films per year. I built her a studio in Tempelhof, and set up a big production staff around her. This woman can carry it … . Let the films cost whatever they cost. I used every available means – and devised many new ones – in order to bring the Asta Nielsen films to the world. (Quoted in Elsaesser 1996: 84)\n\nLähn continues: ‘PAGU developed into the most prestigious production company in Germany. The contract with Asta Nielsen involved twenty-\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n3\n\nfour films, divided into annual series of eight. The first series met with huge acclaim and succeeded in setting the aesthetic standard that raised filmmaking to the status Davidson had aimed for’ (ibid.) Nielsen and Urban Gad made, in the end, some thirty films for PAGU and IVG between 1911 and 1915. Davidson saw to it that they had the service of fine cameramen (including Guido Seeber, Axel Graatkjaer and Karl Freund), excellent scene and costume designers, and the best possible studio conditions; he also left the choice of subjects largely to them, and gave the films wide and imaginative publicity – knowing that his star and her director had a sensitive feeling for the kind of plots, and the kind of central figures, that would appeal to contemporary audiences. Asta Nielsen’s many and varied performances earned her the soubriquet ‘the Duse of the Cinema’. Having established himself as a supplier of films with stars and plots that held appeal for audiences in cinemas across the country, as well as limited sales abroad, Davidson consolidated his position by making each film a ‘monopoly’ of its production company – enabling that company to make the hiring of a potentially very popular film dependent on hiring a number of others with somewhat less appeal: a process that would later be called ‘block booking’. The First World War helped to make this possible, for import restrictions dictated by the outbreak of hostilities made German exhibitors depend much more on native products and boosted the German film industry, particularly at the expense of the French. All these developments also lent force to ‘star value’: value attached particularly to the heroes and heroines appearing on the screen, but also to directors who consistently produced films that appealed to the increasing cinema-going public. After Urban Gad and his Asta Nielsen films the director who did most to further the fortunes of Davidson’s PAGU was Ernst Lubitsch, who not only starred in his own early works but also gathered together a repertory company that included the writer Hanns Kräly, the designer Kurt Richter, the cinematographer Theordor Sparkuhl, and the actress Ossi Oswalda. Lubitsch joined Davidson after a brief experiment with a company of his own, and eventually made thirty-nine films for PAGU – most of them before and some after it became one of four main units that merged into Ufa. Davidson enabled Lubitsch to assemble talented and congenial people around himself, and encouraged him, after the success of his early comedies, to try his hand at fantasy and history films. For Lubitsch’s first step in this new direction, Die Augen der Mumie Ma (The Eyes of the Mummy, 1918), Davidson secured the services of Emil Jannings and Pola Negri, who both went on to become international stars with Madame Dubarry (Passion, 1919) and Anna Boleyn (Deception, 1920), both directed by Lubitsch. This, however, belongs to a later chapter in the fortunes of PAGU, after it had united its forces with the biggest of all German production and distribution companies, Ufa.\n\n4\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nOne of Davidson’s less heralded but by no means unimportant achievements was to break the determination of a guild (Verband deutscher Bühnenschriftsteller) formed by German writers for the stage not to furnish materials for films. In 1912 he persuaded some important writers, including Gerhart Hauptmann in Germany and Arthur Schnitzler in Austria, to sign contracts with PAGU. Nothing ever came of this for Davidson; but such breaking of ranks did persuade the writers’ guild to accept the inevitable and withdraw its resolution against collaboration with the emergent cinema. In 1913 even the most prestigious theatre director of his day, Max Reinhardt, signed a contract with PAGU and subsequently delivered two films, made in Italy as a kind of holiday amusement with members of his theatre company: Eine Nacht in Venedig (A Night in Venice) and Die Insel der Seligen (The Isle of the Blest). With the latter Davidson sought to lend cultural prestige to his newly opened Berlin picture palace, U.T. am Kurfürstendamm, in 1913. Neither of the Reinhardt films was a success with the public; but their very existence did help to increase the reputation and ‘respectability’ of the cinema in Germany. By the time war broke out in 1914, Davidson had become a prestigious entrepreneur in the nascent German film industry, respected as a cinema owner, as a producer/distributor of films to be shown there, and as a man with an eye on the international market. He was therefore one of the first people approached by the General Command of the German Army when it decided, in 1916, to counter anti-German propaganda in French and American films with pro-German propaganda of its own. Davidson responded, in 1917, with Das Tagebuch des Dr Hart (Dr Hart’s Diary), directed by Paul Leni – a film about the activities of a wartime medical unit, made under the auspices of a Photo and Film Agency (Bild und Film Amt, BUFA) set up by the army. Davidson’s was in fact the only full-length feature film produced for BUFA, but encouraged by General Erich Ludenorff, a group of financiers, headed by Emil Georg von Stauss of the Deutsche Bank and including many Jewish members (Max von Wassermann, Paul Mamroth, Hermann Frenkel, Salomon Marx and others), formed a committee that consolidated Davidson’s PAGU and others into a giant production, distribution and exhibiting syndicate named Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft (Ufa). Founded in December 1917, with help from the Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions represented on the committee, Ufa brought PAGU together with the pioneering Messter company, the German branch of the Danish Nordisk under its Jewish director David Oliver, the Vitascope company, as well as a number of smaller fry, leaving one of the larger companies, Deulig, controlled by Alfred Hugenberg, outside the new conglomerate. Davidson’s PAGU or Union organisation continued to function as a division within Ufa, and he himself became a member of the central management committee and a salaried consultant on technical and organisational problems. PAGU brought to Ufa some of its most important assets: a good half of the studio complex at Berlin Tem-\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n5\n\npelhof, including a glass-house for filming and a film-processing plant, a chain of fifty-six cinemas throughout Germany, and writers, directors and actors including Hanns Kräly, Lubitsch, Emil Jannings, Nielsen, Negri, Oswalda, Harry Liedtke and Erna Morena. One of the first films Pola Negri made for Davidson’s unit within Ufa had as its theme Tsarist oppression of Jews: Der gelbe Schein (The Yellow Passport), directed by Victor Janson, first released in November 1918 – the same year as the two Grossfilme that were to establish Lubitsch and Negri as preeminent purveyors of prestigious films appealing to international as well as German audiences: The Eyes of the Mummy and Carmen. Like The Yellow Passport these too were made under the auspices of Davidson’ unit within Ufa. It cannot be denied, however, that despite the continued presence of PAGU as a production unit and his reputation as (to use a formulation by Stefan Grossmann) ‘the Pied Piper’ who lured the best talents of the German stage to seek their fortune in the motion picture industry, his importance within that industry declined after the foundation of Ufa. The fateful turning point came in 1922, when the great success of Passion and Deception (as Madame Dubarry and Anna Boleyn were retitled for English-speaking audiences) brought offers from the USA that neither Lubitsch nor Negri could refuse. Die Bergkatze (The Mountain Cat, 1921) was the last film these two made for Davidson; from 1923 onwards Lubitsch worked exclusively in America. When Alles für Geld (Everything for Money, retitled Fortune’s Fool in the USA), directed by Reinhold Schünzel and starring Emil Jannings, appeared in 1923, Davidson’s name appeared as director of production, but the production company was not PAGU or Union but EmilJannings-Film GmbH. By then, however, Davidson had made his most serious error of judgement. Irked by his ever more subordinate position at Ufa he had resigned his position there and allowed himself to be appointed as one of the presidents of a new organisation, the European Film Alliance (EFA). This was a company set up by the Hamilton Theatrical Corporation, which was linked to Adolph Zukor’s USA-based Famous Players. It was Zukor who had first suggested the founding of such a firm in order to penetrate European markets more effectively. The fortunes of EFA, however, were in the hands of the directors of the Hamilton Corporation, Samuel Rachman and Ben Blumenthal, with Rachman as the most disastrously active partner in Germany. Leopold Schwarzschild, the renowned German-Jewish editor of the journal Das Tagebuch (Diary), painted a vivid portrait of the personality and activities of a fellow-Jew whose family origins lay further east: Sami Rachman, who used to be an impressario of variety-shows somewhere in Galicia, arrives in Berlin alone but with self-glorifying letters of proxy, reserves a flight of rooms in the best hotel … He concludes new contracts, buys manuscripts, forbids Davidson and Lubitsch to enter their own offices, insults, bribes, berates, distributes sweeteners, quarrels with everyone, soon keeps seven barristers out of breath with civil and criminal proceedings,\n\n6\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nalleges slanders and libels, deliriously flings money around, breaks, finally, with his American colleagues, and is summoned back to the USA from the chaos he has created in Germany. Mr Blumenthal arrives in his place with his brother Ike, announcing that a period of sober activity is to begin. But by then little has been left to work on! (Quoted in Kreimeier 1992: 89)\n\nRealising what was happening, Davidson and Lubitsch travelled to the USA to dissociate their production unit from Rachman, but the damage was done. Their last film together, Das Weib des Pharao (retitled The Loves of Pharaoh in English-speaking countries), made in 1921, appeared as a product of Ernst Lubitsch Film GmbH, and the sole achievement of EFA, the firm that was to have renewed Davidson’s fortunes, was recutting and retitling a few previously made films for the American market. When Lubitsch, Negri and Jannings took themselves off to Hollywood, Davidson felt that there would be no place for him there. He tried to buy back his old firm, PAGU, from Ufa, but was rebutted – largely because it was thought that he was backed by American capital, and that selling out to him would give foreign producers a back-stairs way of penetrating the German film industry. Rejecting Davidson’s offer and an even bigger one from Blumenthal, which would have reinstated Davidson as head of production, Ufa parcelled up its PAGU holdings in a way that virtually ended their existence as a separate unit. The name Projektions A–G “Union”, PAGU, was now mainly used as that of a holding company to administer some real estate containing an Ufa picture-palace in Berlin, so that ‘what had begun as a movie-house company ended as a movie-house company’ (Bock and Töteberg 1992: 61). All this happened in 1922; two years later Davidson founded the Paul Davidson Aktiengesellschaft as an independent company to work in partnership with Ufa; but nothing came of that partnership, which was discontinued, by mutual agreement, in 1923. Davidson had been one of the great enablers of the German film industry. He had seen the possibility of combining cinema ownership with film production and distribution, at first in Frankfurt, then in Berlin. He had furthered the move from one- or two- reelers to longer fiction films, with star power, backed by skilful propaganda, and had provided the directors and actors who worked for his outfit with the best technical support money could buy. He had realised that in order to flourish German films would need to acquire an international reputation and international distribution, and had been able to break into the international market – especially that of the all-important USA – with the help of Ernst Lubitsch and the team Davidson had enabled Lubitsch to assemble around himself. In 1923, deserted by that team, cold-shouldered by the now all-powerful Ufa he had helped to bring into being, superseded in all departments by younger men whose energies had not been used up, Davidson fell into a deep depression and took his own life. The pioneering production firms founded, expanded and merged by Davidson were by no means the only ones started and run by Jewish entre-\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n7\n\npreneurs. Others in the same line, though never working on the same scale as Davidson, were Jules Greenbaum (born Julius Grünbaum, whose son Max became a distinguished cinematographer under his successive names of Mutz Greenbaum and Max Greene), Ludwig Gottschalk, Paul Oliver, Erich Morawsky, Siegmund Deutsch, H.R. Sokal (patron of the young Leni Riefenstahl), Julius Pinschewer (who pioneered animation and advertising shorts) and Romuel Rappaport. Heinrich Nebenzahl, who had moved from his native Kracow to New York, and thence to Berlin with his family, was one of the most successful of this group. After profitable ventures in the family-branch of the international egg-trade, he entered the German film industry in the second decade of the twentieth century. In 1917 he became business manager of Natur-Film Friedrich Müller; two years later he took over the Metro-Film GmbH, which issued films by the popular star of adventure and daring-do movies, Harry Piel, with whom he remained profitably allied through several other foundations. Among such foundations in which he had a hand was that of Nero-Film in 1925, in collaboration with the prolific and influential filmmaker Richard Oswald, and with a younger member of the Nebenzahl family. This was Heinrich’s son Seymour, born in New York, who had turned from apprenticeship in the family egg-trade in the English port of Hull to lucrative banking and stockbroking, and settled in Berlin. Initially Harry Piel was once again a central and profit-generating presence in the new firm; but it soon became the most important independent company outside Ufa through Seymour’s association with G.W. Pabst, whose Die Büchse der Pandora (Pandora’s Box), Westfront 1918, Kameradschaft (Comradeship), and Die 3-Groschen-Oper (The Threepenny Opera), all appeared under the Nero emblem. Fritz Lang too, after his break with Ufa, joined the Nero team, which issued his first sound films M and Das Testament des Dr Mabuse (The Testament of Dr Mabuse). A later chapter will consider the work of Heinrich’s nephews, Robert and Curt Siodmak. The careers of Heinrich and Seymour Nebenzahl, and that of Seymour’s son Harold, were celebrated in 2001 by a Congress and Retrospective in Hamburg, from which a richly informative publication resulted (3 X Nebenzahl. Eine deutsch–amerikanische Produzentenfamilie zwischen Europa und Hollywood, Hamburg, Cinegraph, 2001). We still await a similar congress celebrating and documenting the achievements of Paul Davidson.\n\nPommer Like his father before him, and like many other Jewish pioneers of the film industry in Europe and the USA, Erich Pommer had an early taste of the textile and fashion business. The father, Gustav Pommer, gave up his draper’s shop in provincial Hildesheim to lease a canning factory in Göttingen, before moving his business to Berlin in 1905 – the year in which his\n\n8\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nson, born in Hildesheim in 1889, concluded his secondary education and began an apprenticeship with a gentlemen’s outfitters, the Jewish-owned Machol and Lewin. His sister, however, secured a secretarial post with the Berlin branch of the French film company Gaumont, and this family connection led to an interest in the international movie business which was henceforward to determine the trajectory of Pommer’s career. In 1907 he was hired by the Berlin Gaumont first as a lowly ‘messenger’, then as an increasingly valued sales representative. Ursula Hardt, to whom we owe the most authoritative study of Pommer in English, quotes his own description of what happened to him in 1907: It was here that I first laid eyes on those boxes holding films of 300 meter length. They were then sold to fairground people who showed them while travelling from place to place. I believe I contracted a very special bug at the time, a bug I was never able to get out of my system. Even today, the smell of filmstrip draws me like a magnet when I find myself in editing rooms. That was the reason why medicine lost a candidate and Georges Grasset, director of the German branch of Gaumont, agreed to hire as a messenger the young boy I was at the time. (Hardt 1996: 16–17)\n\nAs a salesman for Gaumont Pommer began his inveterate habit of travelling in search of international contacts; here he met his future business partner Erich Morawsky, another Berlin Jew bitten by the film bug, and formed friendships with several of his later collaborators, including the great Jewish cameraman Karl Freund. Grasset soon promoted him to manage sales at the Vienna branch of Gaumont, from where he travelled throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and came to know the Balkans, which led to later association with Balkan-Orient-Film/Soarele. After brief service in the Prussian militia he was wooed away from Gaumont by another French firm, Eclair, and given responsibility for sales in Central and Eastern Europe and the Scandinavian countries. He soon set up a branch of Eclair based in Vienna, under a title which betrayed that his interest in film went beyond the merely selling part of the business: Wiener-Autoren-Film. Under this banner he began his career as a producer by sponsoring films of varying length with such alluring titles as Mystery of the Air, Between Two Fires, Off the Straight and Narrow. The outbreak of the First World War led to his conscription into the Prussian army; he served on the Western and Eastern Fronts, was wounded, and decorated after being mentioned in despatches, and became an army training officer before being assigned to the newly set up army film office, BUFA, in 1917. While still in the army, Pommer had used some of Eclair’s accumulated capital, frozen because Germany was at war with France, to found, in 1915, a Deutsche Eclair company, known as Decla, with a partner who soon sold out, giving way to Pommer’s brother Albert and to his old friend Erich Morawsky, who looked after the firm’s interests during Pommer’s war service. Even at that time, however, Pommer kept himself informed,\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n9\n\nthrough daily letters exchanged with his wife, of what was going on at Decla, and took a hand in recruiting authors, directors and actors for a sequence of thrillers, comedies, and other entertainment features – a busy native programme which flourished while the war largely cut out the foreign competition that had dominated the market before 1914. The directors recruited by Decla included Otto Rippert, Alwin Neuss, and the young Fritz Lang (who wrote scripts before directing Die Spinnen (Spiders) for Decla in 1918/19), the cameramen Carl Hoffmann, and the actors Harry Lambert-Paulsen, Werner Krauss, Lupu Pick (a later director), Ressel Orla, and – under her married name Martha Daghofer – Lil Dagover. While keeping an eye on all this Pommer produced newsreels and documentaries for the army, and served for a while on the military censorship board. Like many others in charge of the proliferating number of film-producing companies in Germany Pommer felt that while his firm was becoming a more and more significant player, the German film industry needed to consolidate if it wanted to prosper at home and abroad. He therefore initiated the first of several mergers in his career by fusing Decla with another film-production firm, the Rudolf-Meinert-Film-Gesellschaft, assigning Meinert the post of Chief of Production, while placing himself in charge of Export and Import. It was during this period that the newly merged company put itself – and Germany – on the international map with The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1919/20), while Davidson’s PAGU did the same thing with Madame Dubarry. Since nominally Meinert was in charge of production, Pommer’s part in the inception of Caligari has been much disputed; there can be no doubt, however, that it was he who was first approached by the film’s Jewish writers, Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz, and that he encouraged the gifted team that came together to make the film along their own lines. It is certainly a key film in Pommer’s career. A work of aesthetic merit, its style and story-line rooted in German Romanticism, Expressionism and Jugendstil, it proved to be his first international success; it fostered in him a belief that films of artistic quality with a distinctly German voice and style would appeal to discriminating audiences abroad and further the export chances of German films. It also brought him together with the greatest scriptwriter of the silent screen in Germany, Carl Mayer, and strengthened his belief in the importance of teamwork, such as that which had enabled the gifted designers, cameramen and actors to produce such a distinguished and distinctive film under Robert Wiene’s direction. Whether he reflected that key elements in this success were provided by two Jewish writers, a Jewish film director and a Jewish director of Decla, we cannot know. He was proud of being a German who had served his country well in peace and war, and wanted to serve it further by making German themes, styles and production qualities renowned throughout the world, bringing profit as well as honour to a country shaken by a lost war, financial crises, and the travails of a republic born amid resentments and competing ideologies.\n\n10\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nSeeking further alliances, Pommer concluded agreements with the publishing firm of Ullstein, which brought out novels that achieved wide popularity, often through serial prepublication in the firm’s newspapers and journals before being filmed under Decla auspices. He also set up an organisation called ‘Russo’, dealing with Russian literary themes. April 1920, however, saw a much more important event in Pommer’s career: the fusion of Decla with the rival firm Deutsche Bioscop to become Decla-Bioscop. Through this move Pommer’s firm acquired – among other human and real-estate resources – a set of studios in Berlin-Neubabelsberg which were to become central to German film production in subsequent years. The most fateful merger of all was in fact decided in a short period in which Pommer was ill and not in full control. Decla-Bioscop united its fortunes with Ufa, that Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft which was increasingly dominant in German film production, distribution and exhibition. This happened in 1921, without, however, sidelining Pommer in the way Davidson was increasingly sidelined. His company remained as a production unit, under his control, within Ufa; in the opening titles of the films that unit produced he was given full credit, as the unit was in many of the advertisements, on posters and in newspapers, which swallowed up a fair proportion of Ufa’s budget. Ever since the successful prepublication advertisement campaign for Caligari Pommer had been as convinced of the importance of advertising as he was of product differentiation, artistic quality, and the necessity to export in order to recoup the costs of highbudget films. The latter were known as Grossfilme, as opposed to the more modestly budgeted films in popular genres intended for the German market only. He attracted to his unit many of the most talented directors of the silent cinema: Murnau, Lang, Ludwig Berger and others, who valued the excellent professional team with which he surrounded them, his involvement in initial stages of their project, his generous funding and respect for their independent decisions once he had given them the go-ahead. ‘He proved himself,’ said Ludwig Berger, ‘an excellent teacher for me and others who directed films under his auspices. [He] knows and understands so much that even now … I sometimes still see myself as his apprentice…’ (Aurich and Jacobson 1998: 39–40). In 1923 Pommer was voted onto one of the central control boards of Ufa, remaining in charge of the Decla-Bioscop unit and taking over directorships of the Davidson and Messter units. By taking control of Davidson’s PAGU (‘Union’) company he effectively shut out Davidson himself, whose career never recovered its momentum after this. Pommer’s nichemarketing strategies, supplying popular low-budget films for one set of the German public, and a series of more generously budgeted prestige films that would be recognisably German yet would also appeal to audiences for fresh filmic voices abroad, impressed the members of the professional organisation of the German film industry, SPIO, so much that they made him their chairman. But while the 1920s saw Pommer at the peak of his power, they also prepared the first downward slide of his career. His\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n11\n\nexport strategies misfired; the all-important market for his expensive Grossfilme, the USA, never really fulfilled the hopes he had set on it. While American films were shown in important cinemas all over Germany, German ones failed to reach a wider public in the Americas. Even in relatively sophisticated New York German films tended to open not on Broadway and the streets leading off it in central Manhattan, but in Yorktown, a district inhabited by many people of German origin. An agreement with Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, named Parufamet and intended to benefit all three partners equally, proved far more advantageous to the Americans than to the Germans, and had to be abrogated by the disappointed party soon afterwards. The soaring costs of Pommer’s Grossfilme, particularly those directed by Fritz Lang, made Ufa slide more and more into the red and brought the firm to the very brink of bankruptcy. Pommer fell from grace; his contract was not renewed; and in 1926 Pommer took himself off to Hollywood, where he produced two films for Paramount (both starring Pola Negri), briefly worked for MGM, and produced one of Mauritz Stiller’s least regarded films, The Woman on Trial. None of the films he oversaw under these auspices had anything like the popular and artistic success of those he had made in his German heyday: Berger’s Cinderella (Der verlorene Schuh), Lang’s first two Mabuse films, Lang’s Destiny (Der müde Tod), Murnau’s Faust and The Last Laugh (Der letzte Mann) and, especially, that tribute to quintessential German mythology, Lang’s Die Nibelungen, scripted by Thea von Harbou and explicitly dedicated ‘To the German People’. It was, however, the Lang–Harbou Metropolis which did most to overstretch Ufa’s budget, and forced the departure of the producer who had sunk more and more of Ufa’s capital in a project which, however prestigious and artistically valuable it seemed to many, had no chance of recouping its extravagant cost in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, as Ufa slid deeper into bankruptcy, a rescuer appeared: the media-Tsar and right-wing politician Alfred Hugenberg. Hugenberg had always regarded Ufa as the most dangerous rival of his own film company, Deulig; he was now able to take it over, and put his own man, the efficient and sensible Ludwig Klitzsch, into overall control. One of Klitzsch’s first acts was to recall Pommer, with a brief that included the adoption of production and budgeting methods he had had a chance to observe during his work in Hollywood studios. He made him chief of production of a central unit (Erich Pommer Produktion der Ufa), in which he was to exercise stringent financial control and employ directors like Joe May and Hanns Schwarz, who were not likely to indulge in Metropolis-like extravaganzas while making films the German public would like to see and might also prove exportable. Whereas before his departure for the USA it had been said of Pommer that his dogged pursuit of cinematic quality had ‘snatched German films away from the perspective of housemaids’, he now declared that ideally films should appeal to all classes, including ‘Minna Schulze, the washerwoman’ (Das Ufa-Buch p. 90ff).\n\n12\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nThe most urgent problem that faced Pommer after taking up his new duties at Ufa in 1928 was that of overseeing the costly and complicated transition from ‘silent’ to sound film within his production unit. He decided early on that the cost of this could only be recouped if films were released abroad in multilingual versions, usually made simultaneously with the German one. These would export the star value of actors like Lilian Harvey, Emil Jannings and Conrad Veidt, who could function in languages other than German, exchanging those who could not for accomplished local stars like Henri Garat and Laurence Olivier. After early experiments, including one in which the leading man, Willy Fritsch, was required to repeat the few German sentences the script required him to speak in English, French and Hungarian, Pommer embarked on a prestige project with which his name will always be as indelibly associated as it is with Caligari, Die Nibelungen and Metropolis: Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel), directed by an Austro-American director imported from Hollywood, Josef von Sternberg. This starred Germany’s most internationally acclaimed actor, Emil Jannings, recently returned from his Oscar-winning career in Hollywood. Sternberg paired him with the hitherto only locally known Marlene Dietrich, whose international fame would soon eclipse that of Jannings himself. Sternberg directed both the German and the English version, though only the German one had the benefit of his final editorial supervision. Pommer gave him Ufa’s best technical team, from cameramen to sound experts, prestigious script writers, excellent scene designers, tried and proved supporting actors – and a cabaret-honed composer who worked closely with Sternberg on the all-important music that held the film together: Friedrich Hollaender. Gramophone recordings of that music, in the form of songs sung by Marlene Dietrich, proved extremely popular and increased Ufa’s profits considerably. The team Pommer had assembled for The Blue Angel, which included Hollaender, the script writer Robert Liebmann, the cameraman Günther Rittau, the scene designers Otto Hunte and Emil Hasler, and the sound technician Fritz Thiery, was soon augmented by other composers (notably W.R. Heymann) and other cameramen and technicians, and assigned directors with a feeling for the new art form in which Pommer showed an overriding interest: films integrating songs and musical set-pieces in an amusing, affecting or thrilling plot. The best-known and most popular of these, including Die Drei von der Tankstelle (Three Men from the Filling Station, known in its French version as Le Chemin du paradis) and Der Kongress tanzt (The Congress Dances), will be considered in a later chapter. The stars at the centre of most of these films set up by Pommer for his production unit within Ufa were the immensely popular Lilian Harvey and (in the German versions only) Willy Fritsch, whom Pommer surrounded with able supporting casts. Harvey and Fritsch, the ‘dream pair’ of German film in the early 1930s, were not Jewish; the directors, writers and composers of many of the movies Pommer set up after his recall to Ufa, how-\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n13\n\never, did have Jewish provenance – a fact that did not escape Josef Goebbels and the newspapers that supported the rising Nazi party, who forced Hugenberg and Klitzsch (right-wing nationalists, but not programmatically anti-semitic) into apologetic or face-saving statements. In 1933 the atmosphere changed radically. While trying to keep some of their Jewish employees for a time, the Ufa management readily accommodated itself to the anti-Jewish orientation of the Hitler government and dismissed a large number of its Jewish staff. Pommer was one of the first to have his employment terminated by reason of the new national policy. For a man who had steadfastly fought for the ‘Germanness’ of his films, and had wanted to make other nations appreciate the specifically German quality of those he exported, who had served with distinction in the German army and held the Iron Cross, who was anything but religiously observant, it was a terrible blow to be suddenly proscribed as a Jew. He was better off than many, however, because of the international contacts he had made in his many export drives; and at forty-four years of age he still had sufficient energy to try and rebuild his career elsewhere. He already had a contract with Fox, and emigrated to Paris to produce a number of films under the Fox Europe banner, mostly with fellow exiles, including Ophüls and Lang; and then, after a brief and unsatisfactory stay in Hollywood, he joined Alexander Korda in London, where he founded the Mayflower Picture Corporation with Charles Laughton. For Mayflower, whose name indicated Pommer’s ambition to appeal to American as well as British audiences, he made three films, one of which he directed himself after disagreements with the originally appointed director; all three starred Laughton, but none of them was commercially successful. The outbreak of war in 1939 found Pommer back in Hollywood; but serious illness disrupted his capacity to work and diminished his energies. He managed to set up a couple of films, one of them teaming Laughton (unhappily) with Carole Lombard, the other directed by one of the few female directors in Hollywood, Dorothy Arzner. Neither of these impressed the Hollywood moguls or fired audiences with enthusiasm. No more work in American films came his way after 1941, though he did become a US citizen and was known, henceforth, as Eric (not Erich) Pommer. Here the story might have ended – but Pommer’s history, unlike Davidson’s, did have a brief upturn. In 1946, a year after the end of the war, he returned to Germany, in American army uniform, and was given the task, by the occupying Western powers, of reorganising a film industry the Nazis had centralised, controlled and incorporated in their propaganda machine. Pommer’s endeavour to rebuild the industry while purging it of its most committed Nazis and preventing the formation of vast cartels, raised many German hackles – he was accused of ruining German competitiveness on the international market. At the same time he incurred American suspicions that he was ‘going native’: that he was all-too-vigor-\n\n14\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nously supporting German-made films at the expense of the imports with which the Hollywood studios were flooding a Germany starved, since the entry of America on the Allied side during the war, of popular American film-fare. Pommer endured this sniping from both sides for four years, returning to the USA a sadder and a wiser man. Though his health troubles increased, and despite his bad experiences as a control officer, Pommer was not yet ready to give up. He set up a company in Munich, significantly called Intercontinental Film GmbH, and shuttled between Germany and the USA as an independent producer, setting up a number of films, the most noteworthy of which was entitled Children, Mother, and a General (Kinder, Mütter, und ein General). This anti-war film, with memorable parts for Therese Giehse, Maximilian Schell and Klaus Kinski, was praised by critics but failed to arouse the enthusiasm of the German or the international public. Like many other exiles who chose to return after the war, Pommer had met much resentment and little willingness to help him achieve his previous eminence – handicapped as he was in any case, by increasing age and ever-increasing ill health. In 1956 he returned to California, disillusioned and sick. He died ten years later, at the age of seventyseven, with many unrealised plans and no further effective input into the industry he had loved so much. Erich, or Eric, Pommer never denied or abjured his Jewishness; but he thought of himself as a German patriot, whose international activities were devoted to making German films not only more profitable, but also more respected, in other countries. He cared passionately for German prestige. The films he sponsored were part of what he called his country’s ‘Niagara’: just as the Niagara Falls were a feature specific to America, which other countries need not try to reproduce, so each nation had something specific to contribute to world cinema which other nations could and should admire and want to see, in order to supplement and widen their own experiences. He had great organisational skills and an imaginative approach to diversification and expansion. His support for large projects likely to result in internationally respected works of art got him into trouble at the peak of his career; but he recovered from that and balanced his Grossfilme, prestige products, with more modest and less expensive fare that could appeal to tastes throughout the classes and income groups that constituted his audiences. He had great empathetic understanding of the needs of the many and diverse directors he engaged, and made sure that they had the best casts, writers, designers, cameramen and technicians Ufa could muster; a sensitive feeling for plot-lines that would make a good film, and a sure instinctive understanding of when it was necessary to stop interfering and let the teams he had put together, and the director he had put in charge, go their only partially predetermined way. It was his tragedy that the unique talents he had dedicated to the service of German film were scorned and rejected at what should have been the mid-point of his career. He made what he could of what he was given elsewhere, but\n\nPreparing the Ground\n\n15\n\nstarting all over again was difficult even for a man who had the international contacts Pommer had built up over many years; and when he returned to Germany he had to fight his way in a chaotic situation against resentment on the German side and suspicion on the occupying American side. Aging and ill health did the rest, ending a broken career that never quite recovered its early momentum after its sudden, cruel disruption. Thomas Elsaesser, in whose debt all serious students of German cinema necessarily find themselves, has admirably summed up Pommer’s achievement: The close contacts of the German film industry with Paris, London and Los Angeles were finally, to a degree not always recognized, due to the constant journeyings and extensive network of connections of a single man: Erich Pommer … If competition, co-operation and commerce are spurred on on the one side by the logic of capital, it was Erich Pommer, on the other, who acted as the motor that kept the wheel of ‘Filmbusiness’ in Germany turning – and he intervened often enough to give that wheel a spin of its own. (Schöning 1993: 27)\n\nWhat Elsaesser makes crystal clear is that, unlike Davidson, who had his sights firmly fixed on Germany, Pommer always saw German film in a wider, global, context. This did not mean, however, that he wanted to internationalise and homogenise the German and Austrian cinema. No one was more keenly aware than he that the cinema of every nation, with the aid of Jewish as well as non-Jewish contributors, added a distinctive voice to the great conversation of mankind.\n\nChapter 2\n\nDRAMAS AND MELODRAMAS OF THE ‘SILENT’ PERIOD\n\nDer Gelbe Schein (The Yellow Passport) In 1918 Paul Davidson’s PAGU, under the Ufa banner for the first time, brought out three films with Jewish themes. Two of these were comedies, directed by, and starring, Ernst Lubitsch: Der Rodelkavalier (The Tobogganing Cavalier), and Meyer aus Berlin. The third however, was a melodrama featuring a (non-Jewish) actress recently recruited from the Warsaw stage, Barbara Apolonia Chalupec, who had adopted the name Pola Negri in homage to an Italian actress whom she greatly admired. Pola Negri’s speciality, in the German films she subsequently made, was playing fascinating foreign women and various species of vamp – often, like the Lorelei figure in the work of the great Romantic poet Clemens Brentano, victims of their own attractiveness to men. The title of this early Negri vehicle, Der gelbe Schein, looked back to the infamous Tsarist regulation, recently rescinded by the October Revolution, that the only Jewish women allowed residence in St Petersburg without exceptional government dispensation had to have the yellow identity papers issued to prostitutes. The screenplay was provided by Hanns Kräly, who worked closely with Lubitsch during most of the latter’s career, and Hans Brennert; the film was directed by Victor Janson, one of the many actor-directors in the Weimar cinema, who also took one of the main parts, and Eugen Illés, who doubled as cinematographer. It starred Negri as Lea, whom we first meet as the ostensible daughter of an ailing Jewish shopkeeper and pawnbroker, Scholem Raab, played by Guido Herzfeld – the only Jewish member of the cast important enough to receive screen credit. The kindly, widowed, decrepit Scholem, looked after by Lea and by a servant (who looks and acts as though she had been recruited from one of the Yiddish theatre troupes that occasionally performed in Berlin) lives in a Polish town inhabited by Jews and non-Jews alike – partly recreated in the Ufa-Union studios, with exteriors filmed in occupied Poland. The early\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n17\n\nshtetl scenes have an authentic look and feel, showing streets crowded with bearded men, women carrying babies, and people standing or sitting outside houses and shops, one of which is clearly selling old clothes. There is also a brief authentic-looking anteroom filled with a minyan of men praying in the house of a dying man. For much of this, and for some Hebrew/Yiddish shop-signs more convincing than the tombstone inscriptions in the film’s studio-built cemetery set, the filmmakers went to a Jewish district in Warsaw, where they found the local colour they needed for their early scenes. In between ministering to Scholem’s needs and seeing to an occasional customer, Lea is shown poring over medical books, swaying like Bashevis Singer’s Yentl over the Talmud, in order, as the title proclaims, to relieve Scholem’s sufferings. She has a non-Jewish teacher, Ossip Storki, played by the film’s director, Victor Janson; but she soon loses him, for he is summoned away to become tutor to the son of the governor of a remote district. Before leaving, Ossip visits the dying Scholem, who hands him a document containing a great secret; Scholem dies soon afterwards, and Lea, although she has been told of the infamous ‘Yellow Passport’ regulation, sets out to pursue her medical studies in St Petersburg. Stock shots of a train leaving, and one of a train reaching, anonymous-looking station platforms, eked out by a postcard shot of a square in St Petersburg, bridge the gap between the early Polish and the later Russian scenes staged in the Tempelhof studios and a nearby forest. Rejected by lodging-house keepers because she has no residence permit, Lea is forced to apply for the yellow identity papers at a police station where she is manhandled and treated with contempt by Tsarist officials, and has to wait in a room in which (as an impressive tracking shot of unhappy or resigned women reveals) she is thrust into a company whose way of making a living we can easily surmise. One woman, however, is treated by the police officials in a more cheerful, welcoming, bantering way: the happy-go-lucky, flirtatious Vera, played by Marga Lind. After a long wait, Lea is ushered into the inner office, where a surly official issues the yellow passport; and when tired and despondent after these discouraging experiences, she sinks down in the street, she is accosted by Vera, who offers to find her lodgings where no awkward questions would be asked, and where no immediate rent would be demanded. It is no surprise, after that, to find that the accommodating landlady, played by the excellent Margarete Kupfer, is the proprietress of what is euphemistically described as a ‘dance palace’ (Ballhaus). She looks Lea over, likes what she sees – as well she might, for the black-haired, fiery-eyed Pola Negri is a very attractive lady – and suggests that she might occasionally attend some ‘parties’ arranged at her establishment. Left alone in her room, Lea unpacks her few belongings and comes across a book Ossip had given her before going away; a book that had belonged to his dead sister. And lo and behold – inside the book Lea finds the identity papers issued to that sister, Sofia Storki. Under that name Lea registers\n\n18\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nat the university, assuming a non-Jewish identity as she registers to attend the classes of Professor Schukowski, played by Adolf Edgar Licho, who appears to be teaching medicine by writing things on a board that the students, sitting in tiered rows of a lecture theatre, write into notebooks that he afterwards inspects. At these classes she meets a fellow-student, Dmitri, who is soon smitten and induces her to relax occasionally at student parties in which Cossack dances seem to figure largely. Dmitri is played by Harry Liedtke, whom German audiences of the day found unaccountably attractive, and who here begins a career of playing the Weimar film’s favourite jeune premier until Willy Fritsch supplanted him. Our heroine now lives a double life: as Lea Raab with the yellow passport in thrall to a procuring landlady, and as the brilliant student Sofia Storki with papers that do not call either her religion or her virtue into question. Inevitably, the two identities clash: an arrogant student whose drunken advances she had rejected at one of her landlady’s ‘parties’ drags Dmitri to one of these parties (which are, incidentally, very well staged, paced and photographed) where he sees her being forced to keep company with some coarse drunkards. He upbraids Lea as a hypocrite and deceiver, prompting her to attempt suicide. In these St Peterburg portions of the film Lea is the only apparently Jewish character we meet. But halt! What about the paper the dying Scholem had given to Ossip Storki? What it contains is played out in the film’s first crucial flashback. We see a Russian woman, dragging herself and a baby through the Polish streets and collapsing outside the house in which the childless Scholem and his wife live. They take her in, give her something to eat and put her and her baby to bed – only to find, the next morning, that the woman has disappeared, leaving a note to say that she is going to do away with herself and hopes they will look after her baby. They duly adopt the little girl and bring her up as their own, revealing the secret only to Ossip who, unaccountably, fails to pass it on to Lea. She is not Jewish at all, and need, by rights, never have had to have the yellow passport! But, I suppose, the paper handed over by a dying Jew would not have seemed sufficient proof of identity by the Russian authorities – so Kräly and Brennert have to pile up the coincidences to bring the film to its melodramatic conclusion. As Sofia Storki, Lea is honoured at the university with a prestigious prize, handed her by Professor Schukowski. A newspaper account of this reaches Ossip, who knows his sister to have died many years ago, and who is given leave by his employer to investigate the matter by going to St Petersburg. There the university authorities direct him to Professor Schukowski, on whose desk he sees a photograph he takes to be of Lea, but which in reality is that of the Professor’s long-lost sweetheart. A second flashback explains how that sweetheart, Lydia, became pregnant after a passionate encounter in the forest, how her lover promised to marry her but was summoned home, where his malevolent father detained him for a\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n19\n\nyear after falsely writing to Lydia that his son had married someone else, and how, when he returned to claim her, he found only a note to say that she and the baby had left, destination unknown. All this leads to the soapopera conclusion, heightened by colour-tinting in the copy I have seen: Lea has been found in the street after attempting suicide, and is taken to the hospital where Professor Schukowski is about to operate while a gallery of students look on. Lea’s case is considered so urgent that he must take it at once: he operates in a tensely staged scene – he seems to be performing a tracheotomy – and thus saves the life of his own child. Great emotion all round, as the film ends with the Professor on the right and Dmitri (bearing flowers) on the left of Lea’s bedside. The operation has been successful, and we surmise a wedding to come. All this nonsense is efficiently directed and excellently photographed. A scene like that which shows Lea dealing with a customer who has brought items to pawn, in the foreground of a dimly lit shop where miscellaneous pledges and goods for sale can be discerned, while the bright back room containing Scholem and Ossip is well in focus, speaks volumes for the efficiency of the lenses and the sensitivity of the film-stock PAGU and Ufa could muster at this early period. The scene in the operation room at the end, with a hanging lamp uniting the patient in the front and the physicians in the middle distance without obscuring the further distance in which we can see a crowd of students looking down eagerly from the viewing gallery (though cinematic purists might find it too reminiscent of theatre staging) is, in its context, equally effective; and the atmosphere of the café and place of assignation, with dancing couples, amorous drunkards, conspiratorial waiters inviting gentlemen to a party with charming girls in a back room, could not have been better conveyed. Above all, the camera lens is in love with the young Pola Negri, who appears constantly in attractive close-ups and two-shots. One of these shots, indeed, is a classic of early German cinematography, enshrining a key moment of Weimar film. Tortured by the complications arising from her dual identity as Lea and Sofia, to which another identity, as Schukowski’s daughter, will soon be added, our heroine contemplates suicide: a close-up shows her leaning against a mirror, in a two-shot with herself, which visualises that multiple identity in a striking, unforced, way. The Doppelgänger theme is compounded, in The Yellow Passport, by the fact that Pola Negri also plays Lydia, Lea’s natural mother – ensuring that the mystery can be cleared up when a photo of the mother is initially mistaken for that of the daughter. One aspect of the film makes it particularly valuable. Some of the opening sequences in Lea’s home town were shot in the Nalewski section of Warsaw, which was then – during the First World War – occupied by German troops, whose commanders saw anti-Tsarist propaganda value in Janson’s project. The Nalewski was a district almost entirely inhabited by Jews. Pola Negri, already a star of Polish films, was greatly moved by the experience of filming among a ‘bearded and bewigged’ population that\n\n20\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\ncould easily have ‘stepped out of drawings of life made there two hundred years ago’, and hoped that despite the prevailing anti-Jewish feelings of many of her fellow-Poles, the film she was making, on the eve of her departure for Germany and world stardom, would do something to spread tolerance and understanding. For us today these sequences have a documentary value that far transcends their narrative interest; for they allow us glimpses of the Warsaw Jewish quarter before its destruction in a later war, and of its inhabitants (some of whom seem to be curiously watching the filming going on their streets,) before they and their descendants were murdered during a later, far more malevolent, German occupation. Pleasure in the message of tolerance and understanding Negri ascribed to the film cannot, however, be unalloyed, for it obviously fudges the issues it ostensibly deals with. What presents itself as a film about a Jewish problem turns out to have a heroine at the nub of that problem who is not Jewish at all. In fact, there need not have been a problem if only someone had spoken out! I am reminded of a quip attributed to Ring Lardner, Jr. (among others) about the ‘moral’ some people had drawn from Gentleman’s Agreement, a Hollywood movie in which Gregory Peck, as a Gentile journalist, pretends to be Jewish in order to probe the extent of anti-Semitic prejudice and ‘restriction’ in the USA. What that film seems to teach, Lardner is reported to have said, is ‘that you should never be mean to a Jew because he might turn out to be a Gentile’. The plot device of an orphaned Gentile girl charitably adopted as his own by a Jew has, of course, a respectable ancestry in Lessing’s great play about religious and ethnic interrelationship and mutual respect, Nathan der Weise (Nathan the Wise, first published in 1779). In that central work of the German Enlightenment, however, the girl becomes a bridge between the benevolent Jew and a Christian of good will, a Templar who is himself related to the wise Muslim ruler in the medieval Palestine in which the play is set. It is the Jew, beset as he is by Christian zealots less enlightened than he is, who proclaims the equality of the three great religions that meet and clash in the play, and who therefore becomes a commanding figure in the way the doddering Scholem, Lea’s ostensible father, could never be. In this context it is interesting to remember that in 1922, when a Jewish director and producer, Manfred Noa and Erich Wagowski, made a silentfilm version of Lessing’s play for the Bavarian Emelka company, their work was greeted with protests, especially in Munich, because it was deemed to be too pro-Jewish. The Yellow Passport avoided such criticism – not least because the prospect of marriage held out by the fade-out was not interracial after all. The clichéd Jews of the first reel (pawnbroking! oldclothes dealing!) make a pseudo-exotic background for a safe melodrama about the inhumanity of a régime that had been at war with Germany and had recently been overthrown. With its story of multiple identities, prostitution, threatened violations, illegitimate childbirths, successful or\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n21\n\nattempted suicides, secrets improbably kept, tyrannical real and benevolent adopted fathers, a daughter lost and found, drunken men and light women in a less than respectable establishment, and a climactic hospital scene in which a father manages to save the life of his long-lost child, The Yellow Passport is cobbled together to make a vehicle for the studio’s latest asset, imported from Poland, who would soon go on to bigger things. Davidson paired her successfully with Lubitsch and co-starred her with Jannings in Die Augen der Mumie Ma (The Eyes of the Mummy), which played on superstitions about excavations and discoveries by contemporary Egyptologists in an uncanny tale that was forerunner of many ‘Mummy’ movies in other countries, with either supernatural or ‘explained supernatural’ elements. The same pairing ensured the success of Madame Dubarry, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, whose success in the USA, under the title Passion, sent Lubitsch, Jannings and Negri to Hollywood. Davidson remained behind, and his German career never recovered from the loss of his most important director and star. While Pola Negri, who became one of the great icons of Weimar cinema, began her career with a film that showed her character as not born Jewish, but brought up and acculturated within orthodox Judaism, another of the most popular stars of the time, Lilian Harvey, made her first film for a Viennese company founded by her Jewish director, Robert Land, as a girl born Jewish but in disharmony with her orthodox patriarchal East European shtetl environment. The firm was called Der Fluch (The Curse, 1924–25), and it told the story of an unmarried mother who drowns herself because her daughter, played by Harvey, conscious of her mother’s irregular status, leads an ‘immoral’ life and becomes subject of the ‘curse’ that forms the film’s title. The screenplay was written by Ernst Weizmann and Walter Reisch, and thus had Westernised, assimilated Jews looking with compassion, but also with distance, at a kind of Jewish life they themselves had either never known or had left behind. Harvey, who appeared raven-haired in this film, was to become the Weimar public’s blonde darling under the guidance of many other Jewish producers, directors, scriptwriters and musicians: notably, Erich Pommer, Wilhelm Thiele, Franz Schulz, Robert Liebmann, W.R. Heymann and Friedrich Hollaender. We will meet her again in a later chapter.\n\nDas Alte Gesetz (The Ancient Law) Ewald André Dupont wrote, and directed, films in many different genres before his German career was cut short by the Nazis; but he returned most often to the world of entertainment, theatre of various kinds, cabaret and variety – indeed, a film called Varieté, made in 1925 and starring Emil Jannings, Lya de Putti and Warwick Ward, is a classic for which he will always be remembered. One of his films is entitled Zwei Welten (Two Worlds): a\n\n22\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nprogrammatic title, for, himself of Jewish origin, he was perennially interested in the interplay of different worlds that obeyed strict, initially incompatible, rules. The Ancient Law, first shown in 1923, takes its viewers into the world of orthodox Judaism in a Galician shtetl, where the ambition to become a professional actor is regarded as little less than apostasy. It then introduces them to three different kinds of theatre: one within the Jewish realm, confined to one special day of rejoicing, and two in the Gentile world without. Dupont made the film for one of the many smaller production firms in Berlin that had not yet been caught in the Ufa conglomerate; it was called Comedia Films, and did not long survive The Ancient Law. The screenplay was by Paul Reno, who cites as one of his sources the reminiscences of Heinrich Laube, who, at the peak of a chequered career, had become a director of plays at the prestigious Burgtheater of Vienna, still a court theatre between 1849 and 1867, and subject to overall control by a courtappointed Intendant. A look at the passage in question will help us place the plot-lines of Dupont’s film. Laube is here talking about an actor called Bogumil Dawison, who had come to try his luck at the Burgtheater after experience with less prestigious theatre-troupes in Poland and Germany: I had just been appointed to my post at the Burgtheater when a young man appeared to give trial performances in character and juvenile parts. He was fairly successful with the public because of his lively, emotional acting, and his striving for effect at all costs, even if such effects were not always legitimate. The public urgently demanded to see new life in the Burgtheater; and though Bogumil Dawison, the actor in question, did not satisfy the more discriminating spectators, even these did not deny him a modest amount of applause. I now had to ask my chief [the Intendant, Count Lanckoronski] whether Dawison should be given a contract. I had the right to engage any actor for a year at a time, but did not think it proper to insist on this so soon after my appointment – especially in this case, since Dawison could give lively performances, but his lack of training ensured that he was incapable of conveying any kind of nobility. My chief did not like him at all. He called him coarse, graceless, and pushy. Perhaps because Dawison was a Jew? That may have played a small part. In essence, however, the Intendant rejected him because of his characteristic lack of corporeal grace, dignity, poise, and good manners … When I came to cast tragedies I ruled Dawison out categorically. He could not play tragic parts. Even when he worked his feelings up to their highest pitch, the effect was sentimental. This made for theatrical excitement; in favourable cases it could even be moving – but he was incapable of portraying the profound agony of a noble soul. (Laube 1882: 175–6, my italics)\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n23\n\nDawison never did get a permanent engagement at the Burgtheater: his virtuoso performances – exciting, but often criticised for vulgar exaggeration – were mostly given at Hamburg and Dresden, and on a tour of the USA. Shylock was his most famous part; but he also played Franz Moor (the evil brother) in Schiller’s Die Räuber, the no less unpleasant Moor Aaron in Die Verschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua (The Conspiracy of Fiesco at Genoa), as well as various parts in old and new comedies. Baruch Mayer, the central protagonist of The Ancient Law, is not identical with Dawison; but the mention of Laube’s reminiscences in the credits, the mid-nineteenth century era in which the story is set, and various parallels with Dawison’s origins and early adventures, suggest that Baruch is to some extent based on him. There are, however, important differences which will concern us later. Baruch Mayer, played by Ernst Deutsch, is first seen in a Galician shtetl, in a Jewish community whose spiritual head, the rabbi, is Baruch’s father. Rabbi Mayer, is played by the Polish-Jewish actor Avrom Morewski, who also acted as consultant for Jewish ritual, ensuring that the many scenes which featured Jewish worship and ceremony in the home and the synagogue have an authenticity that elsewhere is found mainly in the many Yiddish films in which such scenes were calculated to awaken warm memories of the Old Country even among those who had abandoned the piety of their East European home and were glad to live free from persecution and the constraints of strict orthodoxy. The rabbi is a figure of great dignity in this film, but he lives in a world so different from his wider surroundings that when he tries to fathom what kind of thing is weaning his son away from his religious studies and is given a copy of Hamlet, he tries to read it by opening it from the back – reminding us that Hebrew is not only read from right to left but that its pagination runs the opposite way from the pagination in books written in Western languages other than Yiddish. The shtetl types that surround the rabbi are portrayed with accuracy and sympathy: the man who wakes Jews for prayer in the morning, knocking at windows to make sure that the morning prayer is attended by at least ten adult men (a minyan); the shammes or beadle; a well-differentiated gathering of worshippers in the synagogue – and, above all, the all-important shnorrer, the beggar who enables better-off Jews, and poor ones as well, to practise the hospitality and the charity which is as much a religious duty as prayer, and who is also a welcome source of news as he goes from shtetl to shtetl, from large town to small town and village. In The Ancient Law he is brought vividly to life by the Jewish actor Robert Garrison. Garrison’s Ruben Pick unites due deference with a dignity born of wider experience; understanding and love of the ‘ancient law’ with respect for inborn talents and urges that can find no adequate outlet within it. With a firm place in the traditional world of Judaism he can bring news of a wider world into it; and when Baruch has broken away, partly fired by Ruben’s stories, the shnorrer’s wanderings make him a mediator able to bridge the geographi-\n\n24\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\ncal distance between shtetl family and metropolitan son, and something of the spiritual distance as well. Much of the appeal of this film resides in its recreations of Jewish ritual. It brings us glimpses of the inauguration of the Sabbath within the family, of Passover celebrations, the Kol Nidre service in the synagogue (with just a touch of exaggeration in the gestures of the congregants to remind us that for Dupont this is another type of theatre as well as a religious act). He also introduces a reading of the scroll of Esther at Purim, the Jewish Feast of Lots, with children making a licensed din with wooden rattles whenever the wicked Haman and his sons are mentioned – and focuses particularly on the Purim festivities outside the synagogue. These are the nearest traditional Judaism comes to the carnival atmosphere of the Christian world just before Ash Wednesday; they feature a jester who acts as master of ceremonies, and musicians, klezmorim, to heighten joy at the rescue of a Jewish community from threatened extermination in the days of Mordecai and Esther. These festivities traditionally include the performance of a Purimshpil in which amateur actors portray Esther, Mordecai, King Ahasuerus, and Haman, in home-made costumes, masks and false beards. The writer of this book has been both Ahasuerus and Haman in his time. In The Ancient Law, Baruch, impressive in robe and crown, has been cast as Ahasuerus; but his strict father thinks it beneath the dignity of a rabbi’s son to take part even in such permitted representations. When the rabbi interrupts the proceedings by pulling his son away, Ruben Pick intervenes; trying to calm the atmosphere, he recounts what he has heard of the delights of the Vienna Burgtheater and unwittingly points Baruch in the direction he wants to go. Baruch feels sad at leaving not only his family but also Esther, the girl he loves – but when Ruben Pick continues his wanderings, Baruch follows him into a wider world. There follows an encounter with a troupe of wandering players in comparison with whom the Vincent Crummles Company is the Old Vic. The director of this motley band, whose actresses increase the takings by being nice to gentlemen off the stage, is played by the portly Jakob Tiedtke as the very essence of sleaziness. The wealth of convincing detail of gesture, deportment and facial expression make his portrait of pomposity, greed, cringing deference, and willingness to pimp, as rounded and impressive as Robert Garrison’s portrayal of an indigent Jew’s decency, intelligence and helpfulness. The director – we never learn his name – sets Baruch to sweeping and shovelling horse-dung before letting him exchange the ghetto caftan for a motley costume in order to play Shakespeare’s Romeo to a superannuated floozy impersonating Juliet. The performance is watched by a courtly group that had grown bored with its partie de campagne and found a welcome diversion in this primitive spectacle. The gentlemen look for sexual favours afterwards, which the Juliet is anything but unwilling to grant; but one of the ladies, an Archduchess, sees possibilities in Baruch and advises him to try his luck at the Vienna Burgtheater. At this\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n25\n\npoint Baruch’s Jewishness becomes an obstacle; a courtier ridicules the director for casting a young man with Jewish sidelocks as Romeo, whereupon the director shows Baruch the door. Encouraged by the Archduchess, however, Baruch makes for Vienna. Germany’s most popular female film star of the day, Henny Porten, has now come into view. The Austrian Archduchess, whom she plays, has, it appears, fallen in love with young Baruch, makes secret (chaste) assignations with him, but is in the end mindful of the obligations of class and court protocol. At a sad, last interview, she resigns herself to renouncing the man she loves. She does, however, actively engage herself in furthering Baruch’s career, demanding, as her position at court allows her to do, that Laube auditions him. That leads to what became the most famous scene of the film when it was first shown. Known as ‘Laube’s breakfast scene’, it shows the Burgtheater director summoning Baruch in the early morning, and eating and drinking his breakfast while Ernst Deutsch, as Baruch, declaims in the style that made Deutsch so acceptable to Reinhardt and his Berlin public. The camera focuses on the face of the actor who plays the heavily bearded Laube (a Jewish actor, incidentally, called Hermann Vallentin) as he becomes more and more impressed by the young man and determined to give him a try on the Burgtheater stage. In a symbolic scene before an ornate mirror we see Baruch, not without hesitation, cut off his Jewish sidelocks – and that, it seems, was all it took to make him acceptable to the Viennese public. When we next meet him, he is an elegant cavalier and (without having received any kind of training in acting styles except an abortive Purim play and a ridiculously inadequate production of Romeo and Juliet in some Austrian barn) an affluent member of the cast of one of the most famous theatres in Europe. Dawison never had it that easy! And the real Heinrich Laube must have turned in his grave over what happens next. To advance the career of the man she loves even further, the Archduchess detains a star actor, whom Laube had envisaged as his Hamlet, beyond the time appointed for the first read-through of Shakespeare’s play; and Laube, annoyed at having been kept waiting, recasts the play and assigns the part of the Prince of Denmark to Baruch – who, of course, will be a complete success. But wait! It’s now Jazz Singer time. Baruch’s father has not reconciled himself to his son’s desertion, refuses to receive him when Ruben Pick persuades Baruch to visit his old home; his mother sadly follows suit, unlike Esther, who eventually follows him to Vienna and marries him. He has, we see, remained a good Jew at heart, and he has a great struggle within himself when the first night of the production of Hamlet, which will cement his reputation, is set (you guessed it) for the solemn eve of the Day of Atonement. No change is possible, Laube declares; and so we see Baruch sadly murmuring traditional prayers in his dressing-room before going out to give what we are meant to surmise will be the performance of his life.\n\n26\n\nBetween Two Worlds\n\nIf that, and the easy assumption of elegant Viennese life-style not only by Baruch but by Esther too, were not wish-dream enough, Ruben Pick, whom Baruch continues to receive as an honoured guest when he hits Vienna during his peregrinations, engineers a surprise visit of Baruch’s parents to Vienna, where the old rabbi is so enthused by his son’s assumption of the name part in Schiller’s Don Carlos that he forgives the desertion. In a final scene we see Baruch and his mother beside the plainly dying rabbi, in happily restored family unity, while Esther, deeply moved, stands tearfully nearby. It is astonishing to find the perpetrators of this exercise in having one’s cake and eating it naming Laube’s reminiscences as one of their sources. Once he has cut off his sidelocks, there are no anti-Semitic animadversions on the freshly baked gentleman-actor from Galicia, such as Dawison encountered throughout a career in which charges of vulgarity, milking of effects, and ungentlemanly conduct played a constant part until he died, from nervous exhaustion and with impaired wits, in 1872. What Laube really thought of the possibility of letting such a man play Hamlet we have already seen; his judgement was reiterated, some thirty years after his death, by the eminent historian of the nineteenth-century German and Austrian stage, Max Martersteig. Dawison’s playing, Martersteig declares, had something ‘inflated, affected, exaggerated; his nature lacked true artistry, and he substituted sensational effects for it …’ (1904: 453) Baruch has it far too easy: captivating Viennese theatre-goers, attracting the love of an Archduchess, fitting himself and his bride from deepest Galicia seamlessly into elegant society, and reconciling his orthodox father, for whom even taking part in a Purim play was anathema, to his son’s goyish mode of existence based on the art of the theatre which so many Eastern European rabbis denounced as ‘sitting in the seat of the scoffers’. Twentieth-century New York, the setting of The Jazz Singer, might offer such possibilities; but they were less easily resolved in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with its East European outposts, in which Laube and Dawison lived out their lives. It is right to be sceptical about these wish-dream transformations of Laube’s account and what we know of the historical situation, but The Ancient Law offers its viewers many compensations. Chief among them are the reenactmants of Jewish ritual, overseen by Avrom Morewski, who played the rabbi; excellent performances by Deutsch, Garrison, Tiedtke and Vallentin; well-differentiated stagings in shtetl streets and rooms at Purim and among barnstormers in provincial Austria, as well as a recreation of the Burgtheater; and memorable set-pieces like Laube’s breakfast scene. Lotte Eisner, the historian of the Weimar cinema, has spoken of the visual distinction Dupont and his cameraman, Theodor Sparkuhl, brought to their film, mentioning daguerreotypes that seem to come to life, crinolines sweeping across parquet floors or swishing over grass, light magically transfusing outdoor and indoor scenes. She praises particularly the subtle gradations of visual tones in a film that avoids the Scylla of ‘Ger-\n\nDramas and Melodramas of the ‘Silent’ Period\n\n27\n\nmanic immobility of ornamental form’ and the Charybdis of ‘decorative stylisation’: Using here a checked jacket or a piece of striped trimming, there a vase of flowers or a strip of tapestry, [Dupont] seeks to capture the fleeting quality of the chiaroscuro. He makes the interiors vibrate with the atmosphere appropriate to each situation, marrying the velvet of the darks to the tender silk of the lights. Without taking the premeditation too far, he places his actors with infinite elegance and sensibility, as when, for example, the girl in love with Baruch hides her head in despair on her bed in an attitude which brings out her fragility beneath the heavy folds of her dress. Again, Dupont composes an authentic Kammerspiel scene between Henny Porten and Ernst Deutsch, with the dull glow of a taffeta gown blending into the half-light of the silent drawing-room reflected in the window behind them. The period costumes stop looking like fancy dress … the richness of light in the blending impressions is magical. And even in the scenes of the dark-toned peasant ghetto, with what artistry he succeeds in avoiding brusque contrasts and forced highlights, maintaining, with the help of his cameraman, Theodor Sparkuhl, the vigour and sfumato of an etching of the school of Rembrandt! One need only compare these passages with scenes in Pabst’s Prozess, a film which is also set in a Jewish orthodox milieu, in order to appreciate the full extent of Dupont’s tact and extraordinary good taste. (Eisner 1973: 275–6)\n\nKarl Prümm, in an essay about G.W. Pabst’s post-Second World War film treating nineteenth-century accusations of ritual murder (Der Prozess [The Trial], 1948), has a welcome passage about the structural excellence of The Ancient Law, pointi"
