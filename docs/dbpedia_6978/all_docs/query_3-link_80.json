        "text": "Just a day after her San Diego Comic-Con panel, TrekMovie had a chance to have a lively conversation with Kate Mulgrew about the second season of Star Trek: Prodigy, where she chatted about Janeway’s past and future, the nature of her relationship with Chakotay, her thoughts about a live-action show, and the challenges of technobabble.\n\nYou’ve played so many different Janeways—on Voyager too, but in Prodigy, which is my very favorite of all the new Star Trek shows—\n\nI’m so glad to hear you say that. Tell me why.\n\nIt’s exactly what drew me into Star Trek in the first place. So it’s idealism, excitement, optimism… it believes in a better world. Even when the world is bad, it believes that there’s a better one.\n\nThat’s right. And it believes in a better world, in what way collective, the collective. If anything, it is teaching this new audience, a very young people, children, who are strangely solipsistic, they can think only within their own consciousness, and very seldom do children even understand that by embracing others, you can become a better person. This is what it’s teaching. Everybody’s falling down.\n\nAdults don’t understand that either. So it’s a very important message for everybody.\n\nBut I’m saying if you can get them while they’re young, this audience is quite young. And this audience is sitting next to their mother and their father who watched Voyager and the grandparents who watched Next Gen. And the message is going to be about the prime directive. How about how we’re all in this together? Searching for excellence in life? That’s the message and hope.\n\nIt is. And the thing about the show is that it’s been so entertaining, every scene and every moment along the way, which is why I wanted to ask you about playing all these different Janeways and how you approach it—specifically, season 1 Holo Janeway with the kids versus season 2 Holo Janeway marooned on a planet for ten years.\n\nWell, you think about it, you think about the circumstances, and then you add to your vocal barometer, whatever that emotional feeling would be. A slight depression, perhaps a kind of sadness, and then an invigoration of joy. And a renewed command, hologram though she may be. You know, it’s a thrill and a deep pleasure. Live-action is very exacting. I don’t know if you’re aware of that, or very tough, you’re on a soundstage, it’s action, you better hit your mark, you better know your 10-pages walk, it’s usually technobabble. It’s very, very challenging. But in the booth, I’m alone. And I’ve only got Danny and Kevin on the Zoom. And I’ve got the screen in front of me. So my imagination takes flight. And I can go wherever I want. And I can go [changing her voice with each description] near deeply with my voice, or I can go high, right? Or I can be stern. And with Chakotay, seeing him again, it can be quite emotional. It’s acting with voice, yes. But I know her very well. After all these years I can tap into her emotional content pretty easily.\n\nWe’re on the same page about how Chakotay and Janeway could not be in a relationship during Voyager. But that show implied that he was interested, and she was drawing a line. How do you feel about the way Prodigy approached that relationship? Do you like the way that they handled their history together as well as what we’re supposed to assume has or hasn’t happened since then?\n\nI think it was absolutely beautiful. I watched an episode yesterday [“Cracked Mirror”] for the first time that brought me to tears. This again is the Hagemans’ genius, the tenderness of this relationship, the possibility of this relationship, you see when they’re reunited, how deeply they love each other, how deeply they have missed each other. What Chakotay was prepared to do to save her, it’s quite extraordinary. So I think that the Hagesmans have taken it to a new level. And let’s just see.\n\nIt does make me think about 10 years of Chakotay and Holo Janeway being marooned, where they both think this is it, forever. They certainly related like a couple—did you feel or play it like they had become one, at least in that time?\n\nI don’t know if I went that far. But when I say tenderness, and when I say intimacy, and when I say complicity, I mean just that. I don’t know that they crossed that ultimate line. And I’m not sure they should. But something happened that deepened their already very, very profound relationship. And so I’d like to see that explored a little bit more, and perhaps we will.\n\nHave you talked to the Hagemans or thought yourself about if, if there’s more Prodigy, about where you’d like to see any of your Janeways going?\n\nWe talked at length the other night at dinner, but you know, these dinners that we have are always so ribald. They’re very funny. They’re very naughty. They’re full of mischief. So we always end up laughing and we have our martinis. And we’re talking about this about that. But I think the legacy characters coming in, could introduce an entirely new flavor into Prodigy. Also, I want to see what’s going to happen between Dal and Gwyn. Maybe even in a parallel fashion. But I never say never. The Hagemans are wide open. And once you embrace time travel, which, as you know, gives Janeway a headache, you can do anything with impunity with grace and with great joy. So I’m hoping that they do.\n\nMe too. And then there’s always talk of live-action Janeway; do you first of all, do you think Prodigy has increased the chance of that? And do you have any idea of how you see that happening?\n\nI just had dinner with Alex Kurtzman the other night, we talked about this. It would have to be impeccable. It would have to be without hubris. It would have to be authentic. And it would have to be so bloody good that I would in no way question any element of it. I mean, to come back after 25 years, into a character that was once, you know that I’m not only revered but by me, loved by me. I have to take care of my character. So I’ve just said to Alex, you know, I love her. She will never be misused, but she must be exalted. And the writing has to be somewhere from heaven. So we’ll keep this conversation alive. But so far, it’s a conversation.\n\nFor you, would it need to be Janeway as the lead?\n\n[Long pause, icy stare] Are you kidding? What do you mean?\n\nNow I’m realizing what a dumb question that was. [Kate laughs]\n\nShe would have to be central to whatever it is that she’s doing. Yes. Absolutely. Otherwise, why bother? She was central for seven years. Why should it change? Right?\n\nAgree. You mentioned you know, time travel headaches. Did you try to wrap your head around the whole time travel timey-wimeyness of it all, or did you just kind of play the scenes as they were written?\n\nWell, for the first season [of Voyager] I mean, I really had to throw up my hands. It was so challenging. I lost 25 pounds in a month. It was like trying to understand ALL of this technobabble, ALL of the Okuda bible, all of the scientific references, it was just dementing. And I was raising two young kids. And I was sleeping very little. And it was like being shot out of a cannon. And then I relaxed, and I took the Okuda bible, and I got every scientist I knew to explain to me what they thought this meant, or that meant, which led to an entirely new meaning to particularly Janeway’s relationship to whatever alien I was talking to on the green screen on the bridge, because usually it was just a green screen. And that’s where most of that technobabble happened. And I learned how to make it not only authentic, but deeply my own, feeling a certain way about certain coordinates, or nebulae, or a wormhole, a black hole versus a white hole, I mean, all of those discrepancies. I realized if I didn’t know what I was talking about, the audience wasn’t gonna buy it. So I spent a lot of time doing that. And when I finally relaxed, which was at the end of the first season, it started to come quite naturally. And that was thrilling.\n\nAnd then did you try to understand Prodigy’s complex time travel story?\n\nThere’s no understanding this. That’s why it gives Janeway a headache. And she’s a scientist, do you know what I’m saying? You have to sort of embrace time travel, and say, let the devil take the hindmost and throw yourself into it. But it sure is fun, isn’t it?\n\nIt really is. I know you didn’t watch Voyager for various reasons, have you seen all of Prodigy?\n\nNot all of Prodigy, but I’m about to go and meet my grandson for the first time today after my interview with you. And I will see my little granddaughter and we will watch together. What could be better than that?\n\nNothing! So Janeway had a very important legacy within Star Trek for so many years. What do you think Prodigy added to that legacy to make her even more relevant?\n\nWell, it broadened her. And it deepened her. And it puts her, as I’ve said several times in this interview, with an entirely new audience, in a new standing. She’s not patronizing these children. She’s treating them as equal. She’s teaching them the protocols of Starfleet, the prime directive in a way that allows them to learn it as only children can, you know, children are very discerning. So I think it in a way it really sort of elevates Janeway it certainly, I feel elevated, playing Janeway in Prodigy because I know that the audience is very smart. Five-year-olds are very, very smart. And let us not forget how absorbent they are. You know, they’re going to understand the tenets of time travel immediately in a way you and I would have to have 52 martinis to try to figure it out.\n\nAt the end of season 2, Janeway is fighting for Starfleet’s true mission in the face of this new world where they’re saying we’re gonna have to protect our borders, that kind of thing. What is the importance of that message to you, especially relating to the world around us?\n\nWell, you can well imagine, this harkens back to our original conversation about where we are politically, boundaries are extremely important. But they don’t matter at all without the protocols to support them. And I’m talking again about the Prime Directive and the decency of human beings to one another, the understanding of the collective working together to lift it up. I think that that’s why Prodigy at the end of season 2 is particularly electrifying. It’s very dangerous. It’s dangerous to go away from what it is that will in fact, lift you up. So that’s the final message.\n\nYou’re doing a lot of conventions, are you noticing now that a lot more kids are coming and approaching you?\n\nI am indeed with their little Prodigy merchandise and their little Prodigy questions. But you know, it’s still like this. [stares in a confused way] Because they’re having a hard time putting me together with what they’re seeing on the television. But yeah, it’s full of mothers and fathers with their kids who are watching Prodigy. And it’s so gratifying to see that. It’s wonderful. I’ve loved this whole thing. I’ve loved working with Dan and Kevin. I love the idea and the soul, as they call it the heart, of Prodigy and I would be quite disappointed and dispirited to see it not go on. It must go on.\n\nSo I talked to you a few years ago [about playing Janeway again] and at first you said, “Oh, it’s nothing. I’ve entertained.” This was quite a few years ago. And then later, you were like, “Oh, I think it would be delicious to play her again.” I’m just wondering that was you being coy, and stuff was happening, or if you were really just changing your thinking?\n\nI’m not coy. I change. But I will say this to you: What has been a little challenging for me. It’s my great respect for the original live-action Janeway. And what I did to make her as complete as I hope she was. So I’m entitled, I think, to tap into that sense of protectiveness of that character. And yet, in my mind, is still the longing to revisit her. So over time, things change, and they will change again, I can assure you of that.\n\nGood. We need change.\n\nWe do indeed.\n\nPre-order Prodigy on Blu-ray\n\nStar Trek: Prodigy season 2 was released on digital VOD on Monday and it is arriving on Blu-ray and DVD on November 12th.
