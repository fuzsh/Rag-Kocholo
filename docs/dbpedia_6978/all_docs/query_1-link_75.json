The Comedy of Errors · II i 79 · Verse\n\nAdriana\n\nHis company must do his minions grace\n\nHis company must do his minions grace,\n\nWhilst I at home starve for a merry look.\n\nHath homely age the alluring beauty took\n\nFrom my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it:\n\nAre my discourses dull? barren my wit?\n\nIf voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,\n\nUnkindness blunts it more than marble hard:\n\nDo their gay vestments his affections bait?\n\nThat's not my fault; he's master of my state:\n\nWhat ruins are in me that can be found\n\nBy him not ruin'd? then is he the ground\n\nOf my defeatures. My decayed fair\n\nA sunny look of his would soon repair;\n\nBut, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale\n\nAnd feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.\n\n[Luc.] Self-harming jealousy! fie! beat it hence.\n\nAdr. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.\n\nI know his eye doth homage otherwhere,\n\nOr else what lets it but he would be here?\n\nSister, you know he promis'd me a chain:\n\nWould that alone, alone he would detain,\n\nSo he would keep fair quarter with his bed!\n\nI see, the jewel best enamelled\n\nWill lose his beauty; and though gold bides still\n\nThat others touch, yet often touching will\n\nWear gold; and no man that hath a name,\n\nBy falsehood and corruption doth it shame.\n\nSince that my beauty cannot please his eye,\n\nI'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.\n\nThe Comedy of Errors · II ii 86 · Verse\n\nAdriana\n\nAy, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown\n\nAy, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:\n\nSome other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,\n\nI am not Adriana, nor thy wife.\n\nThe time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow\n\nThat never words were music to thine ear,\n\nThat never object pleasing in thine eye,\n\nThat never touch well welcome to thy hand,\n\nThat never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,\n\nUnless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.\n\nHow comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it,\n\nThat thou art thus estranged from thyself?\n\nThyself I call it, being strange to me,\n\nThat, undividable, incorporate,\n\nAm better than thy dear self's better part.\n\nAh! do not tear away thyself from me,\n\nFor know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall\n\nA drop of water in the breaking gulf,\n\nAnd take unmingled thence that drop again,\n\nWithout addition or diminishing,\n\nAs take from me thyself and not me too.\n\nHow dearly would it touch thee to the quick,\n\nShouldst thou but hear I were licentious,\n\nAnd that this body, consecrate to thee,\n\nBy ruffian lust should be contaminate!\n\nWouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,\n\nAnd hurl the name of husband in my face,\n\nAnd tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,\n\nAnd from my false hand cut the wedding-ring\n\nAnd break it with a deep-divorcing vow?\n\nI know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.\n\nI am possess'd with an adulterate blot;\n\nMy blood is mingled with the crime of lust:\n\nFor if we two be one and thou play false,\n\nI do digest the poison of thy flesh,\n\nBeing strumpeted by thy contagion.\n\nKeep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;\n\nI live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.\n\nThe Comedy of Errors · III ii 4 · Verse\n\nLuciana\n\nAnd may it be that you have quite forgot\n\nAnd may it be that you have quite forgot\n\nA husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,\n\nEven in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?\n\nShall love, in building, grow so ruinous?\n\nIf you did wed my sister for her wealth,\n\nThen, for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:\n\nOr, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;\n\nMuffle your false love with some show of blindness;\n\nLet not my sister read it in your eye;\n\nBe not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;\n\nLook sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;\n\nApparel vice like virtue's harbinger;\n\nBear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;\n\nTeach sin the carriage of a holy saint;\n\nBe secret-false: what need she be acquainted?\n\nWhat simple thief brags of his own attaint?\n\n'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,\n\nAnd let her read it in thy looks at board:\n\nShame hath a bastard fame, well managed;\n\nIll deeds are doubled with an evil word.\n\nAlas! poor women, make us but believe,\n\nBeing compact of credit, that you love us;\n\nThough others have the arm, show us the sleeve;\n\nWe in your motion turn, and you may move us.\n\nThen, gentle brother, get you in again;\n\nComfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:\n\n'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,\n\nWhen the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.\n\nThe Comedy of Errors · IV iii 56 · Verse\n\nCourtesan\n\nNow, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,\n\nNow, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,\n\nElse would he never so demean himself.\n\nA ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,\n\nAnd for the same he promis'd me a chain:\n\nBoth one and other he denies me now.\n\nThe reason that I gather he is mad,\n\nBesides this present instance of his rage,\n\nIs a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,\n\nOf his own doors being shut against his entrance.\n\nBelike his wife, acquainted with his fits,\n\nOn purpose shut the doors against his way.\n\nMy way is now to hie home to his house,\n\nAnd tell his wife, that, being lunatic,\n\nHe rush'd into my house, and took perforce\n\nMy ring away. This course I fittest choose,\n\nFor forty ducats is too much to lose.\n\nThe Comedy of Errors · V i 75 · Verse\n\nAbbess\n\nAnd thereof came it that the man was mad.\n\nAnd thereof came it that the man was mad:\n\nThe venom clamours of a jealous woman\n\nPoison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.\n\nIt seems, his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,\n\nAnd thereof comes it that his head is light.\n\nThou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy up-braidings:\n\nUnquiet meals make ill digestions;\n\nThereof the raging fire of fever bred:\n\nAnd what's a fever but a fit of madness?\n\nThou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:\n\nSweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue\n\nBut moody moping, and dull melancholy,\n\nKinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n\nAnd at her heels a huge infectious troop\n\nOf pale distemperatures and foes to life?\n\nIn food, in sport, and life-preserving rest\n\nTo be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:\n\nThe consequence is then, thy jealous fits\n\nHave scar'd thy husband from the use of wits."
