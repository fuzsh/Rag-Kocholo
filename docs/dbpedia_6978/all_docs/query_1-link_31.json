        "text": "The Invention of the Human\n\nBy HAROLD BLOOM\n\nRiverhead Books\n\nRead the Review\n\nTHE COMEDY OF ERRORS\n\nThe shortest and most unified of all Shakespeare's plays, The Comedy of Errors is regarded by many scholars as his very first, which I tend to doubt. It shows such skill, indeed mastery--in action, incipient character, and stagecraft--that it far outshines the three Henry VI plays and the rather lame comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is true that in comedy Shakespeare was free to be himself from the start, whereas the shadow of Marlowe darkens the early histories (Richard III included) and Titus Andronicus. Yet, even granted Shakespeare's comic genius, The Comedy of Errors does not read or play like apprentice work. It is a remarkably sophisticated elaboration of (and improvement upon) Plautus, the Roman comic dramatist whom most of our playgoers know through the musical adaptation A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Shakespeare himself was adapted splendidly by Rodgers and Hart, whose The Boys from Syracuse took The Comedy of Errors as their source, much as Cole Porter later was to utilize The Taming of the Shrew for his Kiss Me Kate.\n\nIn The Comedy of Errors, Shakespeare compounds Plautus's The Two Menaechmuses with hints from the same dramatist's Amphitryon, and gives us the wonderful absurdity of two sets of identical twins. We are in Greece, at Ephesus (where we will be again at the other end of Shakespeare's career, in Pericles), and we never go elsewhere, in this play so carefully confined in space and time (a single day). Antipholus of Syracuse arrives in Ephesus with his bondsman, Dromio. His twin brother, Antipholus of Ephesus, also has a bondsman named Dromio, identical twin to the first. The merchant of Syracuse and his servant have arrived in Ephesus not on a commercial mission but on a familial quest to find their missing brothers. This quest is also the purpose of the merchant Egeon of Syracuse, father of the two Antipholuses, who enters Ephesus only to be immediately arrested in the name of its Duke, who sentences the hapless Egeon to be beheaded at sundown. Syracuse and Ephesus are fierce enemies. That gives The Comedy of Errors a rather plangent opening, not at all Plautine:\n\nEgeon. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,\n\nAnd by the doom of death end woes and all.\n\nDuke Solinus regretfully but firmly assures Egeon that indeed it will be off with his head, unless a ransom of a hundred marks can be paid. In response to the Duke's questioning, Egeon tells us the fantastic, really outrageous yarn of a shipwreck some twenty-three years before, which divided his family in half, separating husband and one of each set of twins from the wife and the other infants. For the past five years, Egeon says, he has searched for the missing trio, and his anguish at not finding them informs his wretched readiness to be executed:\n\nYet this is my comfort; when your words are done,\n\nMy woes end likewise with the evening sun.\n\nThese scarcely are the accents of comedy, let alone of the knockabout farce soon to engulf us. But Shakespeare, who was to become the subtlest of all dramatists, already is very ambiguous in The Comedy of Errors. The twin Antipholuses are dead ringers but inwardly are very different. The Syracusan Antipholus has a quasi-metaphysical temperament:\n\nHe that commends me to mine own content\n\nCommends me to the thing I cannot get.\n\nI to the world am like a drop of water\n\nThat in the ocean seeks another drop,\n\nWho, falling there to find his fellow forth,\n\n(Unseen, inquisitive) confounds himself.\n\nSo I, to find a mother and a brother,\n\nIn quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.\n\n[I.ii.33-40]\n\nThese often-quoted lines belie our usual first impressions of The Comedy of Errors as a purely rambunctious farce, just as the laments of Egeon clearly transcend the expected situations of farce.\n\nThe Ephesian Antipholus is not a very interesting fellow, compared with his Syracusan twin, upon whom Shakespeare chooses to concentrate. Partly, the Antipholus of Syracuse benefits in our regard from what bewilders him: the strangeness of Ephesus. Since St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians makes reference to their \"curious arts,\" a Bible-aware audience would expect the town (though clearly Shakespeare's London) to seem a place of sorcery, a kind of fairyland where anything may happen, particularly to visitors. Antipholus of Syracuse, already lost to himself before entering Ephesus, very nearly loses his sense of self-identity as the play proceeds.\n\nPerhaps all farce is implicitly metaphysical; Shakespeare departs from Plautus in making the uneasiness overt. The Comedy of Errors moves toward madcap violence, in which, however, no one except the charlatan exorcist, Dr. Pinch, gets hurt. It is a play in which no one, even the audience, can be permitted to get matters right until the very end, when the two sets of twins stand side by side. Shakespeare gives the audience no hint that the Ephesian Abbess (presumably a priestess of Diana) is the lost mother of the Antipholuses until she chooses to declare herself. We can wonder, if we want to, why she bas been in Ephesus for twenty-three years without declaring herself to her son who dwells there, but that would be as irrelevant as wondering how and why the two sets of twins happen to be dressed identically on the day that the boys from Syracuse arrive. Such peculiarities are the given of The Comedy of Errors, where the demarcations between the improbable and the impossible become very ghostly.\n\nExuberant fun as it is and must be, this fierce little play is also one of the starting points for Shakespeare's reinvention of the human. A role in a farce hardly seems an arena for inwardness, but genre never confined Shakespeare, even at his origins, and Antipholus of Syracuse is a sketch for the abysses of self that are to come. Even when he contemplates sightseeing, the visiting twin remarks: \"I will go lose myself, / And wander up and down to view the city.\" You do not lose yourself to find yourself in The Comedy of Errors, which is hardly a Christian parable. At the play's close, the two Dromios are delighted with each other, but the mutual response of the two Antipholuses is left enigmatic, as we will see. Nothing could be more unlike the response of the Ephesian burgher, so indignant that his assured self-identity should ever be doubted, than the Syracusan quester's appeal to Luciana, sister-in-law to his brother:\n\nSweet mistress, what your name is else I know not,\n\nNor by what wonder you do hit of mine;\n\nLess in your knowledge and your grace you show not\n\nThan our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.\n\nTeach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;\n\nLay open to my earthy gross conceit,\n\nSmother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,\n\nThe folded meaning of your words' deceit.\n\nAgainst my soul's pure truth why labour you\n\nTo make it wander in an unknown field?\n\nAre you a god? would you create me new?\n\nTransform me then, and to your power I'll yield.\n\nBut if that I am I, then well I know\n\nYour weeping sister is no wife of mine,\n\nNor to her bed no homage do I owe;\n\nFar more, far more to you do I decline;\n\nO, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,\n\nTo drown me in thy sister's flood of tears;\n\nSing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;\n\nSpread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,\n\nAnd as a bed I'll take thee, and there lie,\n\nAnd in that glorious supposition think\n\nHe gains by death that hath such means to die;\n\nLet Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.\n\n[III.ii.29-52]\n\nThe poignance of this inheres partly in its desperation; Antipholus of Syracuse falls in love to refind himself, presaging the erotic pattern that will be amiably satirized in Love's Labour's Lost. There the wit Berowne audaciously secularizes the Christian paradox that Shakespeare evades in The Comedy of Errors:\n\nLet us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,\n\nOr else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.\n\nIt is religion to be thus forsworn;\n\nFor charity itself fulfils the law;\n\nAnd who can sever love from charity?\n\n[IV.iii.358-62]\n\nThat is not precisely what St. Paul meant by \"he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law,\" but Love's Labour's Lost is of course no more Pauline than is The Comedy of Errors. Antipholus of Syracuse loves Luciana not to fulfill the law, even of his own lost being, but to achieve transformation, to be created new. Shakespeare does not let us linger in this plangency, but moves us to hilarity in a dialogue between the Syracusan Antipholus and Dromio, concerning the kitchen wench, Nell, who has confused the visiting Dromio with her husband, Dromio of Ephesus. Nell is a wench of an admirable girth, provoking marvelous geographical surmises:\n\nSyr. Ant. Then she bears some breadth?\n\nSyr. Dro. No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip; she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.\n\nSyr. Ant. In what part of her body stands Ireland?\n\nSyr. Dro. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by the bogs.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where Scotland?\n\nSyr. Dro. I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where France?\n\nSyr. Dro. In her forehead, armed and reverted, making war against her heir.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where England?\n\nSyr. Dro. I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where Spain?\n\nSyr. Dro. Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where America, the Indies?\n\nSyr. Dro. Oh, sir, upon her nose, all o'er-embellished with rubies,\n\ncarbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath\n\nof Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carracks to be ballast at\n\nher nose.\n\nSyr. Ant. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?\n\nSyr. Dro. Oh, sir, I did not look so low.\n\n[III.ii.110-38]\n\nThis splendid tour de force is the epitome The Comedy of Errors, whose laughter is always benign. The recognition scene, Shakespeare's first in what would become an extraordinary procession, prompts the astonished Duke of Ephesus to the play's deepest reflection:\n\nOne of these men is genius to the other;\n\nAnd so of these, which is the natural man,\n\nAnd which the spirit? Who deciphers them?\n\n[V.i.332-34]\n\nThough Antipholus of Syracuse cannot be called his brother's daemon or attendant spirit, one possible answer to the Dukes questions might be that the discerning playgoer would locate the spirit in the outlander, and the natural man in the Ephesian merchant. Shakespeare, who will perfect the art of ellipsis, begins here by giving the two Antipholuses no affective reactions whatsoever to their reunion. The Syracusan Antipholus commands his Dromio: \"Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him,\" but then exits with his own brother, sans embraces or joy. Doubtless, Antipholus of Syracuse is considerably more interested in pursuing Luciana, just as Antipholus of Ephesus wishes to get back to his wife, house, and commodities. Still, the coldness or dispassionateness of the Antipholuses is striking in contrast to the charming reunion of the Dromios, with which Shakespeare sweetly ends his comedy:\n\nSyr. Dro. There is a fat friend at your master's house,\n\nThat kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;\n\nShe now shall be my sister, not my wife.\n\nEpb. Dro. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:\n\nI see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.\n\nWill you walk in to see their gossiping?\n\nSyr. Dro. Not I, sir, you are my elder.\n\nEpb. Dro. That's a question, how shall we try it?\n\nSyr. Dro. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then, lead thou first.\n\nEpb. Dro. Nay then, thus:\n\nWe came into the world like brother and brother,\n\nAnd now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.\n\nExeunt.\n\n[V.i.414-26]\n\nThese two long-suffering clowns have had to sustain numerous blows from the Antipholuses throughout the play, and the audience is heartened to see them go out in such high good humor. When the Ephesian Dromio remarks: \"I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth,\" we see it too, and the concluding couplet exudes a mutual affection clearly absent in the two Antipholuses. It would be absurd to burden The Comedy of Errors with sociopolitical or other current ideological concerns, and yet it remains touching that Shakespeare, from the start, prefers his clowns to his merchants.\n\nChapter Two\n\nTHE TAMING OF THE SHREW\n\nT he Taming of the Shrew begins with the very odd two scenes of the Induction, in which a noble practical joker gulls the drunken tinker, Christopher Sly, into the delusion that he is a great lord about to see a performance of Kate and Petruchio's drama. That makes their comedy, the rest of The Taming of the Shrew, a play-within-a-play, which does not seem at all appropriate to its representational effect upon an audience. Though skillfully written, the Induction would serve half a dozen other comedies by Shakespeare as well or as badly as it coheres with the Shrew. Critical ingenuity has proposed several schemes creating analogies between Christopher Sly and Petruchio, but I am one of the unpersuaded. And yet Shakespeare had some dramatic purpose in his Induction, even if we have not yet surmised it. Sly is not brought back at the conclusion of Shakespeare's Shrew, perhaps because his disenchantment necessarily would be cruel, and would disturb the mutual triumph of Kate and Petruchio, who rather clearly are going to be the happiest married couple in Shakespeare (short of the Macbeths, who end separately but each badly). Two points can be accepted as generally cogent about the Induction: it somewhat distances us from the performance of the Shrew, and it also hints that social dislocation is a form of madness. Sly, aspiring above his social station, becomes as insane as Malvolio in Twelfth Night.\n\nSince Kate and Petruchio are social equals, their own dislocation may be their shared, quite violent forms of expression, which Petruchio \"cures\" in Kate at the high cost of augmenting his own boisterousness to an extreme where it hardly can be distinguished from a paranoid mania. Who cures, and who is cured, remains a disturbing matter in this marriage, which doubtless will maintain itself against a cowed world by a common front of formidable pugnacity (much more cunning in Kate than in her roaring boy of a husband). We all know one or two marriages like theirs; we can admire what works, and we resolve also to keep away from a couple so closed in upon itself, so little concerned with others or with otherness.\n\nIt may be that Shakespeare, endlessly subtle, hints at an analogy between Christopher Sly and the happily married couple, each in a dream of its own from which we will not see Sly wake, and which Kate and Petruchio need never abandon. Their final shared reality is a kind of conspiracy against the rest of us: Petruchio gets to swagger, and Kate will rule him and the household, perpetually acting her role as the reformed shrew. Several feminist critics have asserted that Kate marries Petruchio against her will, which is simply untrue. Though you have to read carefully to see it, Petruchio is accurate when he insists that Kate fell in love with him at first sight. How could she not? Badgered into violence and vehemence by her dreadful father Baptista, who vastly prefers the authentic shrew, his insipid younger daughter Bianca, the high-spirited Kate desperately needs rescue. The swaggering Petruchio provokes a double reaction in her: outwardly furious, inwardly smitten. The perpetual popularity of the Shrew does not derive from male sadism in the audience but from the sexual excitation of women and men alike.\n\nThe Shrew is as much a romantic comedy as it is a farce. The mutual roughness of Kate and Petruchio makes a primal appeal, and yet the humor of their relationship is highly sophisticated. The amiable ruffian Petruchio is actually an ideal--that is to say an overdetermined--choice for Kate in her quest to free herself from a household situation far more maddening than Petruchio's antic zaniness. Roaring on the outside, Petruchio is something else within, as Kate gets to see, understand, and control, with his final approval. Their rhetorical war begins as mutual sexual provocation, which Petruchio replaces, after marriage, with his hyperbolical game of childish tantrums. It is surely worth remarking that Kate, whatever her initial sufferings as to food, costume, and so on, has only one true moment of agony, when Petruchio's deliberately tardy arrival for the wedding makes her fear she has been jilted:\n\nBap. Signor Lucentio, this is the pointed day\n\nThat Katharine and Petruchio should be married,\n\nAnd yet we hear not of our son-in-law.\n\nWhat will be said? What mockery will it be\n\nTo want the bridegroom when the priest attends\n\nTo speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!\n\nWhat says Lucentio to this shame of ours?\n\nKath. No shame but mine. I must forsooth be forc'd\n\nTo give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,\n\nUnto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,\n\nWho woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.\n\nI told you, I, he was a frantic fool,\n\nHiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour.\n\nAnd to be noted for a merry man\n\nHe'll woo a thousand, `point the day of marriage,\n\nMake feast, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,\n\nYet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.\n\nNow must the world point at poor Katharine,\n\nAnd say `Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,\n\nIf it would please him come and marry her.'\n\nTra. Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.\n\nUpon my life, Petruchio means but well,\n\nWhatever fortune stays him from his word.\n\nThough he be blunt, I know him passing wise;\n\nThough he be merry, yet withal he's honest.\n\nKath. Would Katharine had never seen him though.\n\nExit weeping [followed by Bianca and attendants].\n\n[III.ii.1-26]\n\nNo one enjoys being jilted, but this is not the anxiety of an unwilling bride. Kate, authentically in love, nevertheless is unnerved by the madcap Petruchio, lest he turn out to be an obsessive practical joker, betrothed to half of Italy. When, after the ceremony, Petruchio refuses to allow his bride to attend her own wedding feast, he crushes what she calls her \"spirit to resist\" with a possessive diatribe firmly founded upon the doubtless highly patriarchal Tenth Commandment:\n\nThey shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.\n\nObey the bride, you that attend on her.\n\nGo to the feast, revel and domineer,\n\nCarouse full measure to her maidenhead,\n\nBe mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.\n\nBut for my bonny Kate, she must with me.\n\nNay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;\n\nI will be master of what is mine own.\n\nShe is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,\n\nMy household stuff, my field, my barn,\n\nMy horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,\n\nAnd here she stands. Touch her whoever dare!\n\nI'll bring mine action on the proudest he\n\nThat stops my way in Padua. Grumio,\n\nDraw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves,\n\nRescue thy mistress if thou be a man.\n\nFear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate.\n\nI'll buckler thee against a million.\n\nExeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA [and GRUMIO].\n\n[III.ii.220-37]\n\nThis histrionic departure, with Petruchio and Grumio brandishing drawn swords, is a symbolic carrying-off, and begins Petruchio's almost phantasmagoric \"cure\" of poor Kate, which will continue until at last she discovers how to tame the swaggerer:\n\nPet. Come on, a God's name, once more toward our father's.\n\nGood Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!\n\nKath. The moon? the sun! It is not moonlight now.\n\nPet. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.\n\nKath. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.\n\nPet. Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,\n\nIt shall be moon, or star, or what I list,\n\nOr e'er I journey to your father's house.--\n\n[ To Servants.] Go on, and fetch our horses back again.--\n\nEvermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd\n\nHor. Say as he says, or we shall never go.\n\nKath. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,\n\nAnd be it moon, or sun, or what you please.\n\nAnd if you please to call it a rush-candle,\n\nHenceforth I vow it shall be so for me.\n\nPet. I say it is the moon.\n\nKath. I know it is the moon.\n\nPet. Nay, then you lie. It is the blessed sun.\n\nKath. Then, God be blest, it is the blessed sun.\n\nBut sun it is not, when you say it is not,\n\nAnd the moon changes even as your mind.\n\nWhat you will have it nam'd, even that it is,\n\nAnd so it shall be so for Katharine.\n\n[IV.v.1-22]\n\nFrom this moment on, Kate firmly rules while endlessly protesting her obedience to the delighted Petruchio, a marvelous Shakespearean reversal of Petruchio's earlier strategy of proclaiming Kate's mildness even as she raged on. There is no more charming a scene of married love in all Shakespeare than this little vignette on a street in Padua:\n\nKath. Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.\n\nPet. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.\n\nKath. What, in the midst of the street?\n\nPet. What, art thou ashamed of me?\n\nKath. No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.\n\nPet. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.\n\nKath. Nay, I will give thee a kiss. Now pray thee, love, stay.\n\nPet. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate.\n\nBetter once than never, for never too late.\n\nExeunt\n\n[V.i. 130-38]\n\nOne would have to be tone deaf (or ideologically crazed) not to hear in this a subtly exquisite music of marriage at its happiest. I myself always begin teaching the Shrew with this passage, because it is a powerful antidote to all received nonsense, old and new, concerning this play. (One recent edition of the play offers extracts from English Renaissance manuals on wife beating, from which one is edified to learn that, on the whole, such exercise was not recommended. Since Kate does hit Petruchio, and he does not retaliate--though he warns her not to repeat this exuberance--it is unclear to me why wife beating is invoked at all.) Even subtler is Kate's long and famous speech, her advice to women concerning their behavior toward their husbands, just before the play concludes. Again, one would have to be very literal-minded indeed not to hear the delicious irony that is Kate's undersong, centered on the great line \"I am asham'd that women are so simple.\" It requires a very good actress to deliver this set piece properly, and a better director than we tend to have now, if the actress is to be given her full chance, for she is advising women how to rule absolutely, while feigning obedience:\n\nFie, fie! Unknit that threatening unkind brow,\n\nAnd dart not scornful glances from those eyes,\n\nTo wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.\n\nIt blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,\n\nConfounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,\n\nAnd in no sense is meet or amiable.\n\nA woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,\n\nMuddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,\n\nAnd while it is so, none so dry or thirsty\n\nWill deign to sip or touch one drop of it.\n\nThy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\n\nThy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,\n\nAnd for thy maintenance; commits his body\n\nTo painful labour both by sea and land,\n\nTo watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\n\nWhilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\n\nAnd craves no other tribute at thy hands\n\nBut love, fair looks, and true obedience;\n\nToo little payment for so great a debt.\n\nSuch duty as the subject owes the prince\n\nEven such a woman oweth to her husband.\n\nAnd when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\n\nAnd not obedient to his honest will,\n\nWhat is she but a foul contending rebel,\n\nAnd graceless traitor to her loving lord?\n\nI am asham'd that women are so simple\n\nTo offer war where they should kneel for peace,\n\nOr seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,\n\nWhen they are bound to serve, love, and obey.\n\nWhy are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,\n\nUnapt to toil and trouble in the world,\n\nBut that our soft conditions and our hearts\n\nShould well agree with our external parts?\n\nCome, come, you froward and unable worms,\n\nMy mind hath been as big as one of yours,\n\nMy heart as great, my reason haply more,\n\nTo bandy word for word and frown for frown.\n\nBut now I see our lances are but straws,\n\nOur strength as weak, our weakness past compare,\n\nThat seeming to be most which we indeed least are.\n\nThen vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,\n\nAnd place your hands below your husband's foot.\n\nIn token of which duty, if he please,\n\nMy hand is ready, may it do him ease.\n\n[V.ii.137-80]\n\nI have quoted this complete precisely because its redundancy and hyperbolical submissiveness are critical to its nature as a secret language or code now fully shared by Kate and Petruchio. \"True obedience\" here is considerably less sincere than it purports to be, or even if sexual politics are to be invoked, it is as immemorial as the Garden of Eden. \"Strength\" and \"weakness\" interchange their meanings, as Kate teaches not ostensible subservience but the art of her own will, a will considerably more refined than it was at the play's start. The speech's meaning explodes into Petruchio's delighted (and overdetermined) response:\n\nWhy, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\n\nIf you want to hear this line as the culmination of a \"problem play,\" then perhaps you yourself are the problem. Kate does not need to be schooled in \"consciousness raising.\" Shakespeare, who clearly preferred his women characters to his men (always excepting Falstaff and Hamlet), enlarges the human, from the start, by subtly suggesting that women have the truer sense of reality."
