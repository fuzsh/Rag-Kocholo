        "text": "Two of this year’s theatrical releases have made their at-home debuts this week, and they bring along with them an original slasher movie, a found footage movie, and the feature debut of the filmmaker who’s about to make his mark on the Evil Dead film franchise.\n\nHere’s all the new horror releasing May 6 – May 12, 2024!\n\nFor daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar.\n\nLess than two months after releasing in theaters, where it has scared up $195.2 million at the box office, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is now available on Digital at home.\n\nYou can rent the film for $19.99 or purchase it for $24.99.\n\nIn Gil Kenan’s Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the Spengler family returns to where it all started – the iconic New York City firehouse – to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who’ve developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level.\n\nBut when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.\n\nThe cast includes Patton Oswalt, Kumail Nanjiani, James Acaster, and Emily Alyn Lind, alongside Bill Murray, Finn Wolfhard, Ernie Hudson, Mckenna Grace, Paul Rudd, Celeste O’Connor, Logan Kim, Annie Potts, Dan Aykroyd and Carrie Coon.\n\nJason Reitman, who directed Ghostbusters: Afterlife, is back to produce Frozen Empire.\n\nMeagan wrote in her review for Bloody Disgusting, “Frozen Empire offers familiar set pieces, references, and easter eggs aplenty, but the nostalgia tank is now running on empty.”\n\n“That may be enough for some, especially when Frozen Empire pulls out some deep-cut nods. But by the time the mid-credit scene kicks in, solely designed to inspire merchandising sales, it’s more likely to leave you ready for the Ghostbusters to retire in peace,” she adds.\n\nLess than one month after releasing in theaters, Universal’s ballerina vampire horror movie Abigail is also now available on Digital at home via Premium VOD rental or purchase.\n\nYou can purchase the film for $24.99 or rent it for $19.99.\n\nMeagan Navarro wrote in her positive review here on Bloody Disgusting, “Radio Silence’s ballerina vampire movie is a bloody blast.” Her review continued, “It’s savagely inventive in terms of its vampiric gore, offering a thrill ride with sharp, pointy teeth.”\n\nAnd yes, Abigail takes place in the same universe as Radio Silence’s Ready or Not!\n\nIn Abigail, “After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.”\n\nFrom Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not).\n\nAbigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail.\n\nAfter being released exclusively in movie theaters this past January, the tricentennial-themed slasher movie Founders Day is now available on Digital courtesy of Dark Sky Films.\n\nIn this “bold political slasher” from the Bloomquist Brothers, a small town is shaken by a series of ominous killings in the days leading up to a heated mayoral election.\n\nAs accusations fly and the threat of a masked killer darkens every street corner, the residents must race to uncover the truth before fear consumes the town.\n\n“We’re very happy to be partnering with the team at Dark Sky who know and love the power of genre cinema like we do,” said the Bloomquist brothers. “As the chaos of modern politics rages, The Founder is primed and ready to be unleashed on American audiences.”\n\nErik Bloomquist directed Founders Day, written by Erik and Carson Bloomquist.\n\nDevin Druid (13 Reasons Why), Emilia McCarthy (SkyMed), Amy Hargreaves (13 Reasons Why), Catherine Curtin (Stranger Things), William Russ (Boy Meets World), Naomi Grace (NCIS), Olivia Nikkanen (The Society), Jayce Bartok (When They See Us), Andrew Stewart Jones (Gotham), Tyler James White (The Villains of Valley View), Erik Bloomquist (Weekenders), Adam Weppler (Long Lost), Kate Edmonds (The Third Saturday in October), Dylan Slade, and Arun Cameron Storrs star.\n\nA yoga influencer discovers just how flexible fear can be in Mind Body Spirit, a new found footage horror movie that Welcome Villain Films has brought to the table this week.\n\nMind Body Spirit is now available on VOD outlets.\n\nMatt Donato raved in his 4-star review, “Mind Body Spirit is a knockout horror session for the livestream era, which has me desperately waiting to see what its creators and stars do next.”\n\nIn Mind Body Spirit, “Anya, an aspiring yoga influencer, embarks on a ritual practice left behind by her estranged grandmother. She documents the practice on her YouTube channel for the world to watch, allowing her audience intimate access to her journey.\n\n“But what starts as a spiritual self-help guide evolves into something much more sinister. As Anya becomes obsessed with the mysterious power of the practice, she unwittingly unleashes an otherworldly entity that begins to take control of her life – and her videos. Now Anya must race to unlock the truth, before her descent into madness threatens to consume her mind, body and spirit. By the time she reveals the true nature of the ritual, will it be too late?”\n\nMind Body Spirit was written and directed by Alex Henes & Matthew Merenda.\n\nThe new horror film stars Sarah J. Bartholomew, Madi Bready, KJ Flahive, Anna Knigge, and Kristi Noory, and was produced by Dan Asma and Jesse McClung.\n\nThe feature directorial debut of Francis Galluppi, Western thriller The Last Stop in Yuma County arrives this Friday, May 10 from Well Go USA in select theaters and VOD.\n\nWhile it’s not purely a horror movie, horror fans will undoubtedly want to check out The Last Stop in Yuma County because it’s the film that landed Galluppi the next Evil Dead movie!\n\nIn The Last Stop in Yuma County, “While awaiting the next fuel truck at a middle-of-nowhere Arizona rest stop, a traveling young knife salesman is thrust into a high-stakes hostage situation by the arrival of two similarly stranded bank robbers with no qualms about using cruelty—or cold, hard steel—to protect their bloodstained, ill-begotten fortune.”\n\nJocelin Donahue and Barbara Crampton star alongside Jim Cummings, Richard Brake, Faizon Love, Alex Essoe, Michael Abbott Jr., Sierra McCormick, Nicholas Logan, Sam Huntington, Connor Paolo, Robin Bartlett, Jon Proudstar, Ryan Masson, and Gene Jones."
