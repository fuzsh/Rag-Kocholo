        "text": "Presented by Ipswich Civic Centre\n\nSupported by Sit Down Comedy Club\n\nSit Down Comedy Club brings comedy to Ipswich in the monthly Stitch in the ‘swich series.\n\nLooking for some laughter with a bit of variety? We’ve got just the thing! On Friday 26 July come join us for an unforgettable Comedy Variety Night that you won’t want to miss. Come join Mercedes DeLuca-Jones, Emi Grace, Nick Carr, Steve Allison & Christopher Wayne for a night full of comedy, music, magic & more!\n\nMercedes DeLuca-Jones –\n\nShe’s just an average girl… but with better shoes! Mercedes DeLuca-Jones is in a rut. Her BFF (and top fashion designer) Richie, has just passed away leaving a void in her heart and wardrobe… and voices in her head. Her husband’s eyes (and other bits) are straying; not that she really minds, she’s been trying to get rid of him for years. Her children have both left home and travelled to Nepal to ‘give something back’ (she still doesn’t know what) and her body is starting to do things that frankly she finds hideous. So, when ‘The Real Housewives Of’ franchise open auditions for a Gold Coast reality show, Mercedes realises it’s her destiny! Marvel as Mercedes DeLuca-Jones explores every avenue of her abundant assets to become the next Really Real House Wife of Surfers Paradise.\n\nEmi Grace –\n\nEmi Grace is a stand-up comedian with a musical flair. Emi has a knack for fingering your funny bone. Born an albino and proud of it, she is part Tim Minchin, part Sarah Silverman, part White Walker. She is a three-time RAW semi-finalist and regular headliner in Brisbane and surrounds. When Emi Grace is not on stage, you can find her as a music teacher, artist, and mother – usually hiding from the sun.\n\nNick Carr –\n\nAfter only doing stand-up for 10 months, Nick Carr was a state finalist in this year’s RAW Comedy competition. Since then he’s supported Kinne live, hosted a strip-club’s 3rd birthday and performed at the Koh Samui International Podcast Festival Gala, but not all at the same time. He’s a familiar face on Brisbane’s stand-up scene, performing regularly at the Sit Down Comedy Club, and brings a passion about comedy that he’s more than willing to share with the world.\n\nChristopher Wayne –\n\nChristopher Wayne is the creator and co-star of the most successful magic show in Australian history, “The Naked Magicians”. Forming alongside his naked co-star Mike in 2014, The Naked Magicians have played in over 320 cities around the world – including a season on London’s West End, New York, and a residency at MGM Grand in Las Vegas. As a magician, Christopher has appeared on TV shows including Entertainment Tonight, E! News, and America’s Got Talent. In 2022, Christopher became one of Big Brother’s housemate alumni, going in as a housemate that season.\n\nSteve Allison –\n\nSteve Allison knows how to make people laugh, and as soon as Steve picks up the microphone, it’s obvious. He commands attention, and laughter is the best way to get it. With a cool and casual approach, hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed his clever style of comedy. The confidence and experience earned from performing over a thousand live shows is clear. He is funny! With a natural sense of humour and quick wit, Steve’s show is a well crafted mix of snappy one-liners, hilarious stories, funny home truths and current topics. It’s Aussie humour at its best. Steve Allison is regarded by his industry peers as the best undiscovered comic in Australia. Over the years, Steve has travelled over a million kilometres on the comedy circuit honing his craft. His clever, laid back, friendly style of comedy has a polish and delivery that guarantees laughs.\n\nIpswich City Council has transformed the historic Old Baptist Church into the intimate, well renowned performing arts venue, Studio 188. Offering a year-round program of art, culture and entertainment in the heart of Ipswich, Studio 188 boasts a flexible space, regular live music gigs, artist residencies and creative development workshops where big ideas are hatched and people come together in ways that connect and inspire.\n\nStudio 188 is the home for local artists and community folk to foster industry connections, gain exposure and develop new works, with regular free workshops and programs.\n\nStudio 188.\n\nPerform. Promote. Produce."
