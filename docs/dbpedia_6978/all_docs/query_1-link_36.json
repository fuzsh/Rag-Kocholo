        "text": "This year, a sweet little comedy called opened the . The film stars 94-year-old June Squibb, the recipient of SIFF's 2024 Golden Space Needle Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cinema. This role, in particular, is one that showcases Squibb's unmatched humor and comedic timing; it also harnesses her uncanny ability to project the goodwill and tidings of great compassion that she, as an actor, so obviously harbors for the experience of being human. (Although to watch someone of her age commit the physical comedy that this project required of her, there is not a zero percent chance she's an alien life form.)\n\nFirst-time feature film writer-director Josh Margolin was inspired by a real news story about an elderly person who was swindled by scammers over the phone. He also used his own grandmother for inspiration. The result is the most surprising comedy of the year, a genre-bending satire that is earnest about its intentions to uplift and entertain, but that also makes sure the punchline isn't at anyone's expense.\n\nThough Thelma (Squibb) is our fierce heroine disguised as a non-threatening, widowed nonagenarian, her generation is not the only one under the microscope. Margolin has a grand time poking fun at Gen X, portrayed by Parker Posey as Thelma's daughter and Clark Gregg as her son-in-law. Fred Hechinger stars as Thelma's grandson Danny, your somewhat cliche Gen Z/Millennial, who is spiraling post break-up and seemingly incapable of finding a big boy job to support himself. His parents, in true fashion, can't understand his listlessness, nor his lack of motivation, which is why Danny is drawn to his grandmother and chooses, instead, to spend much of his time acting as her caretaker.\n\nBut he isn't there all the time, and when a male voice on the other end of the phone line convinces Thelma that Danny has been arrested and will only be released if she sends $10,000 in the mail to a P.O. Box in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, she does not hesitate and fulfills their request. When it's revealed to be a scam, Thelma is not only embarrassed - and perturbed by the infantilizing by her family - she's mad as heck. It doesn't help that she already feels like she is treated less than because of her age. Instead of wallowing, Thelma takes action, acting as a sleuth to track down her money and hold the con artists responsible.\n\nWhat ensues is perhaps the most darling, 90-some-minute film noir thriller comedy to ever grace the screen. It makes a strong, heartfelt statement: don't judge a book by its aged cover. Thelma employs the techie help of her much younger and hip grandson, as well as a scooter rental from her friend Ben (the original Shaft himself, Richard Roundtree, who passed last year), to zip through the Valley and track down the package of cash.\n\nMargolin's vision is certainly influenced by the films of old. Film noirs like \"The Maltese Falcon\" can be seen through squinted eyes in the lighting and camera angles and in the shot choices and subtleties written into the script hilariously juxtaposed with the silly mission at the film's core. Margolin creates a heightened sense of risk as Thelma creeps up the stairs in a friend's house to retrieve a gun; her friend (Bunny Levine) is suffering from dementia, and the risk is moot. He playfully pokes fun of the elderly, like their technology deficiency and their tendency to think they must know every person of their generation they see on the street. Squibb commits to these scenes with the same earnestness as she does the ones that require greater emotional revelations and exhibition of her human frailty. Her connections to every character feel real and authentic, and that is a testament to her acting prowess.\n\nIt's not uncommon for these niche comedies to hit hard with the jokes in the first act, then falter as the film requires the action to resolve. \"Thelma\" maintains an even-keeled stride, reserving its energy to support a level course of action that even manages a few shocking explosions - metaphorically and quite literally - in its third act. Squibb did many of her own stunts, which, to be transparent, mainly entailed rolling over sofas, but at 94 year of age, that is certainly an incredible feat. Her physical comedy matches her mental sharpness and comedic timing. She is in full command of her performance and of the film itself. There is no Thelma without June Squibb, and it is impossible not to fall in love with both.\n\n\"Thelma\" is in theaters now."
