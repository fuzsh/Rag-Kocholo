        "text": "Mr Cornwell\n\nI was first introduced to your \"Sharpe Series\" of books as a member of the US AIr Force when I was assigned to an RAF Base there, and have 20 of them on my book shelves. I recently discovered a friend of mine had the TV Series in his home collection and started getting hooked on those as well (I love seeing where they change things from the book to the movie). His collection ended with \"Sharpe's Peril\". I've looked on line and it appears the movie series ended with \"Peril\". Was the story line ever continued or are there plans to do so that you know of?? If it was continued, do you have any idea where I could get my hands on those movies?? I truly do thank you for all the magnificent books you have written over the years. As the reader I often find myself so drawn into your stories, I almost feel like I am there. Stay safe and take good care of yourself so I can be selfish and get to read, and enjoy, more of your books.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nHi Bernard\n\nNoticed from an earlier post that you have indicated that you are edging towards retirement. Would you consider a collaboration with another historical novelist, e.g. Conn iggulden, Simon Scarrow or one of my other favourite authors, Ben Kane?\n\nBest wishes, looking forward to Sharpe's Storm\n\nSteven\n\nDear Mr Cornwell,\n\nProbably like many a mid-millennial, I was introduced to Sharpe via the TV series. For me personally, this sparked a life-long interest in the Napoleonic Wars and, over the course of the past year, I have been gradually reading and listening my way through your superb novels (special shout out to Rupert Farley for his wonderful narration!).\n\nI have just finished Sharpe’s Command, which, the confusion over Mister Sharpe’s rank not withstanding, was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about ‘Daddy’ Hill after his previous appearance in Sharpe’s Havoc.\n\nAlas, being a native of the Medway Towns, Sharpe’s Trafalgar is my favourite (read it twice) but being only halfway through the series, it remains to be seen if any other of Mister Sharpe’s adventures will knock it off my personal top spot.\n\nI wanted to ask you, given the several mentions of Flanders throughout the series, do you plan to go further back than Sharpe’s Tiger to his earliest days in the ranks? Given the popular phenomenon of ‘origin stories’ that frequently grace book and screen, would you consider it?\n\nMuch obliged,\n\nSamuel\n\nHi Bernard,\n\nI love all the works that you have done, you are without doubt my favourite author. Recently I've had a bit of a reading spree of your books and have just finished the Starbuck Chronicles, I was wondering if you had considered pursuing the rest of the war? Or even how Nate fares in post war America?\n\nThank you\n\nKonur\n\nI’ve read quite a few of your series and enjoyed them very much. I’m curious whether you’ll be writing more Nate Starbuck books?\n\nMiriam Chernoff\n\nHello Sir,\n\nI have been a great fan of your work since 2012 when I was introduced to your work with The Archers Tale as a freshman in high school. After buzzing through the grill quest series, I was fascinated with your work and began to read. What is now been the most inspirational work I have ever read The Last Kingdom, and the Saxon Series. Uhtred was a perfectly flawed individual trying to make his way through life as an honorable man. Finnan is my favorite character in any fictional universe as he is the truest second in command, loyal to a fault, family man.\n\nA question I would ask you is if you have any plans for future adventures in the Middle Ages and if so, would you be able to release any details as far as timeline of release and general overview?\n\nThank your for your time, and God be with you.\n\nCase Baughman\n\nHi, Bernard -\n\nso looking forward to the publication of Sharpe's Storm later this year! However, where does this novel slot in to the series, please? Before Waterloo for sure but I just can't work out where it will come. I, therefore, thought it best to go straight to you....\n\nRegards, Alan\n\nDear Mr. Cornwell,\n\nI note on the Harper Collins website that a new book \"Sharpe's Storm\" is scheduled for release later this year. Can you please advise where this book will sit in the chronological order of events. Looking forward to its release.\n\nThank you\n\nBrian Clarke\n\nI notice there is a new Sharpe book coming out in the U.S. in December 2024 called Sharpe’s Storm. Would you please tell me where it will fit in the chronology? I plan on re-reading the Sharpe books in order (I have them all) and would like to accommodate your latest book in my plans.\n\nBill Thomlinson"
