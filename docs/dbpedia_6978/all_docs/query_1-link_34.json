        "text": "ABOUT\n\nThe 4th Annual Cannon Beach Comedy Festival brings a cavalcade of fabulous stand up comedians to the stunning Oregon coast, March 8th & 9th, 2024.\n\nThe festival is produced by the nonprofit Tolovana Arts Colony and made possible by a Tourism and Arts grant from the city of Cannon Beach.\n\nThanks to that support, tickets are super cheap: just $40 for the whole weekend, and there's no fine print--no drink minimums or junk ticket “convenience” fees. Plus you get to hang out in Oregon's best beach town, just 75 short miles from downtown Portland.\n\nIncredible, we know. We can't believe it either.\n\nGet your tickets today >>\n\nWe couldn’t be prouder to announce our first comedian: the astounding, acerbic Eddie Pepitone.\n\nNicknamed “The Bitter Buddha,” Eddie Pepitone is a master of the dark art of comedy. Eddie is hailed as a modern day cross between Jackie Gleason, Don Rickles and Eckart Tolle.\n\nOn stage, Eddie is a force of nature, switching between social rage and tender self-doubt. His shows are an energetic combo of calm and chaos, blue-collar angst and sardonic enlightenment. Few comedians working today channel the power of the rant better than Eddie Pepitone.\n\nEddie performs Friday, March 8.\n\nAnother heavy hitter joining us: Baron Vaughn!\n\nBaron Vaughn is a force to be reckoned with in the world of entertainment. With a career that spans live comedy, acting, and directing, Baron's talent knows no bounds. As an actor, he's best known as “Bud”, sharing the screen with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin on the longest-running hit Netflix series, Grace & Frankie. Baron lends his voice as \"Tom Servo\" in the recent seasons of cult-hit, Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nAs a stand-up comedian, Baron has been entertaining audiences for more than 20 years. He has two influential comedy recordings, Raised by Cable and Blaxistential Crisis, both available for streaming on all platforms.\n\nBaron performs Saturday, March 9.\n\nWe’re welcoming Denver’s finest: Adam Cayton-Holland!\n\nAdam Cayton-Holland is a national touring comic who has appeared on CONAN, WTF with Marc Maron, Comedy Central Presents, The Late Late Show with James Corden, @midnight, The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail, and more. He has been named one of Esquire magazine’s “25 Comics to Watch” and one of “10 Comics to Watch” by Variety.\n\nAlong with his cohorts in The Grawlix, he created, wrote, and starred in “Those Who Can’t,” which aired for three seasons on truTV. The Grawlix also host a podcast, “The Grawlix Saves the World,” which is available everywhere.\n\nAdam performs Saturday, March 9.\n\nAll the way from New York, the esteemed Chole Radcliffe will be joining us!\n\nChloe is a NYC-based standup comic, actor, and writer. She starred in COMMAND Z from Steven Soderbergh. Her Comedy Central: Featuring set debuted in 2022. She staffed on the sketch writing team for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon from 2019-2020.\n\nShe was named a TBS Comic To Watch at the New York Comedy Festival, has been seen on Epix, and was selected for NBC’s 2019 Late Night Writers Workshop. She produces Minneapolis’ 10,000 Laughs Comedy Festival.\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Chloe balances annoyance with delight, and draws from her experience of having a huge birthmark on her cheek (she doesn’t talk about it too much. Or, just enough? Whatever’s correct).\n\nChloe performs Friday, March 8."
