The department is a member of the FDLP Content Partnerships Program and an Affiliated Archive of the National Archives.\n\nThe Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commissions (also known as the BRAC Commissions) were established by Congress to review and analyze Department of Defense recommendations for reorganizing U.S. military base structure \"to more efficiently and effectively support our forces, increase operational readiness and facilitate new ways of doing business.\" This collection includes reports, documents, data, correspondence, and public comments from both the 1995 and 2005 Commissions."
