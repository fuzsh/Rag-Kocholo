        "text": "Ray Hayworth, a longtime catcher who was the last surviving teammate of Ty Cobb on the Detroit Tigers and the oldest living former major league player, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Salisbury, N.C. He was 98.\n\nWhen Hayworth made his debut in the major leagues, Calvin Coolidge was president and Charles Lindbergh was 11 months from flying over the Atlantic.\n\nIt was the summer of 1926 and Cobb, who was managing the Tigers and was in his 22nd and final season as a Detroit outfielder, summoned Hayworth after being impressed by him at spring training.\n\n''In July of that season, the regular Detroit catcher broke his leg and Cobb sent for me,'' Hayworth recalled in a 1998 interview in The Denver Post. ''He put me in the game the next day as a pinch-hitter. I hit the ball pretty darn good, but didn't get a hit.''\n\nHayworth became known for his defensive skills during his 15 years in the major leagues. He set an American League record for consecutive chances without an error by a catcher when he handled 439 flawlessly from September 1931 to August 1932.\n\nHe became a backup when the Tigers obtained the future Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane as their manager and catcher, but Hayworth played on the Tigers' pennant winners of 1934 and on the World Series champions of 1935.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
