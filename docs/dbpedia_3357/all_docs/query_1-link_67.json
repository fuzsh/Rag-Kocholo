The gist of both releases was that Snow is a great pick.\n\nThe releases quoted a variety of Democrats, conservatives and journalists praising…\n\nTennessee Senate: Three’s Company\n\nby Nathan L. Gonzales\n\nSenator Harold Ford. Those might be the three words Republicans fear the most on Election Night. If Democrats can successfully takeover the open Tennessee Senate seat being vacated by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R), they could well win a Senate majority in November.\n\nDemocratic hopes are riding…\n\nArizona 5: Turning Up the Heat\n\nby Nathan L. Gonzales\n\nRepublican Cong. J.D. Hayworth is no stranger on the cable television circuit, but he isn’t used to seeing his name on Democratic target lists. Now, former state Sen. Harry Mitchell (D) is in the race and is looking to give the congressman his toughest race in a decade.\n\nMitchell is a well-known…\n\nNew Print Edition: Tennessee Senate & Arizona 5\n\nThe new May 3, 2006 print edition of the Rothenberg Political Report is on its way to subscribers.

Those might be the three words Republicans fear the most on Election Night. If…\n\nTony Snow and the Deteriorating Media\n\nPresident Bush’s new White House Press Secretary is all the rage. But unfortunately, Tony Snow’s appointment will only feed the media’s craving for personal recognition and attention.\n\nOne of the major problems with the media today is too much focus on the “personality” delivering the…\n\nRoad Trip Along the Ohio River: Nine Races to Watch\n\nby Stuart Rothenberg\n\nThe fight for the House of Representatives could be determined in nine adjacent districts in four states, stretching from West Virginia to Indiana. It’s an easy car trip, stretching fewer than 500 miles. Just follow the Ohio River.\n\nThe races are a diverse bunch, with contests involving veteran…\n\nRI Senate: Chafee’s Challenge Remains Unchanged\n\nSecretary of State Matt Brown’s (D) exit from the Rhode Island senate race is not all that surprising and does little to change the fundamental landscape of the race. A couple of serious missteps early were the undoing of Brown’s underdog run.\n\nBrown’s decision to spend virtually all of his campaign…\n\nRI Senate: Chafee’s Challenge Remains Unchanged\n\nBy Nathan L.

First, Democrats seem poised to make significant gains — the kind of gains that, even if they fall short of winning 51 seats later this year, should leave the party well positioned for 2008.\n\nSecond, the…\n\nSwimming Upstream: GOP Opportunities in the House\n\nPlenty of ink has been spilled about the Democrats, their recruiting, and their quest to net the fifteen seats necessary to gain the majority in the House.
