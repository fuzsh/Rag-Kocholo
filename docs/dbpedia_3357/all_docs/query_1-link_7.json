Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1995 to Dec 2006, Hayworth missed 95 of 7,172 roll call votes, which is 1.3%. This is better than the median of 2.9% among the lifetime records of representatives serving in Dec 2006. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the numbers...\n\nTime Period Votes Eligible Missed Votes Percent Percentile 1995 Jan-Mar 279 2 0.7% 39th 1995 Apr-Jun 189 0 0.0% 0th 1995 Jul-Sep 232 0 0.0% 0th 1995 Oct-Dec 185 0 0.0% 0th 1996 Jan-Mar 110 0 0.0% 0th 1996 Apr-Jun 182 0 0.0% 0th 1996 Jul-Sep 163 0 0.0% 0th 1997 Jan-Mar 71 0 0.0% 0th 1997 Apr-Jun 174 0 0.0% 0th 1997 Jul-Sep 232 2 0.9% 28th 1997 Oct-Nov 163 0 0.0% 0th 1998 Jan-Mar 89 0 0.0% 0th 1998 Apr-Jun 185 3 1.6% 44th 1998 Jul-Sep 199 0 0.0% 0th 1998 Oct-Dec 74 0 0.0% 0th 1999 Jan-Mar 77 0 0.0% 0th 1999 Apr-Jun 184 1 0.5% 16th 1999 Jul-Sep 204 0 0.0% 0th 1999 Oct-Nov 146 3 2.1% 42nd 2000 Jan-Mar 95 0 0.0% 0th 2000 Apr-Jun 277 1 0.4% 12th 2000 Jul-Sep 130 8 6.2% 80th 2000 Oct-Dec 101 0 0.0% 0th 2001 Jan-Mar 75 1 1.3% 34th 2001 Apr-Jun 135 2 1.5% 34th 2001 Jul-Sep 149 2 1.3% 37th 2001 Oct-Dec 153 0 0.0% 0th 2002 Jan-Mar 79 1 1.3% 32nd 2002 Apr-Jun 203 12 5.9% 77th 2002 Jul-Sep 141 0 0.0% 0th 2002 Oct-Nov 61 0 0.0% 0th 2003 Jan-Mar 94 4 4.3% 71st 2003 Apr-Jun 239 6 2.5% 54th 2003 Jul-Sep 193 11 5.7% 78th 2003 Oct-Dec 151 7 4.6% 63rd 2004 Jan-Mar 104 4 3.8% 49th 2004 Apr-Jun 221 13 5.9% 77th 2004 Jul-Sep 161 0 0.0% 0th 2004 Oct-Dec 58 0 0.0% 0th 2005 Jan-Mar 90 0 0.0% 0th 2005 Apr-Jun 272 0 0.0% 0th 2005 Jul-Sep 146 0 0.0% 0th 2005 Oct-Dec 163 3 1.8% 36th 2006 Jan-Mar 81 0 0.0% 0th 2006 Apr-Jun 276 9 3.3% 63rd 2006 Jul-Sep 159 0 0.0% 0th 2006 Nov-Dec 27 0 0.0% 0th"
