Hayworth could get a gig at Fox News Channel, rather than run for Congress again next year, according to the Business Journal of Phoenix. Hayworth dismissed the rumors, and so did a Fox News spokesperson, who told TVNewser: “There have been no discussions with J.D. Hayworth whatsoever and there’s no truth to this rumor.”\n\n> An industry insider added that Heyward is a “publicity hound who likely put the rumor out there himself to test the waters, but there’s no interest on Fox’s end.”\n\nAdvertisement"
