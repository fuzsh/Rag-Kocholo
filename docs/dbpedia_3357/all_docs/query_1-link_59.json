        "text": "J.D. Hayworth believes a John McCain supporter has called for his assassination:\n\nHayworth also took issue with a quote in the article from former GOP state Attorney General Grant Woods — a McCain supporter — who said of Hayworth, “Someone needs to drive a wooden stake through this guy’s heart.”\n\n“This cavalier death threat that he issued is over the top,” Hayworth said.\n\n“If Grant Woods had a shred of decency he would apologize for what amounts to a death threat,” he said. “For Mr. Woods to issue a death threat in a national magazine like Newsweek is way beyond the pale.”\n\nI'm pretty sure that was a metaphor. You see, Mr. Hayworth, in the popular culture, there's this evil figure called \"Dracula.\" He can only be killed by driving a stake through his heart. Generally speaking, driving a stake through the heart is not considered an efficient way of killing regular people."
