        "text": "Senator John McCain of Arizona has been transformed again, now back to the moderation he was famous for until he had a contested primary for re-election from former Congressman J. D. Hayworth in the midterm elections of 2010.\n\nHighly critical of President Obama over the past two years, and generally very cranky and irritable, as well as mean spirited, and denying he had ever been a maverick, even though he called himself that for years, suddenly McCain is smiling and supportive in many ways of President Obama.\n\nNow he feels that President Obama handled the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson masterfully, and also feels he has handled the Egyptian Revolution situation in am excellent manner. He has consulted recently with Obama, and suddenly, he is back to his old self that made him more appealing than most Republicans over the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans, particularly many of those thinking of running for President, are finding fault with the approach of Obama, including Sarah Palin, Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann, Donald Trump, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, John Bolton, and others.\n\nIsn’t it amazing how when campaigning for advancement politically, candidates will conjure up criticism and be hypocritical, while when the pressure is off, such as with John McCain in 2011, suddenly a charming, smiling, supportive politician recognizes accomplishment when it occurs! 🙂\n\nArizona Senator John McCain, the GOP Presidential nominee in 2008, has successfully won his party’s nomination for a fifth term, overcoming Tea Party favorite, former Congressman and talk show host J. D. Hayworth by an overwhelming margin!\n\nMcCain spent more than $20 million in his renomination campaign, but in the process he lost his dignity and his principles! 🙁\n\nMcCain, always seen as an independent type maverick, had stood for campaign finance reform, for a fair immigration reform, and for climate change legislation, among other areas of courageous policy stands over the years! He was proud to call himself a maverick, and loved defying the establishment Republicans much of the time!\n\nBut he totally abandoned everything he had ever promoted, in the heat of the renomination contest, and became a shell of his old self! 🙁\n\nIn the process, he disillusioned many people who had seen him as unique and special, and now realize he has no principles except his own ego being stroked by holding a Senate seat at an age when he well might have decided to retire and spend time with his family!\n\nThe image of Senator John McCain has been damaged for good, and even if he reverts back to his old self as a maverick, which J. D. Hayworth has predicted, and is certainly possible, he will never be seen in the same light again!\n\nAmbition and ego have won out over dignity and principle, and that is a sad commentary on the American political system! 🙁\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona faces a tough renomination and reelection battle in Arizona, and he is therefore giving up all his principles that made him highly regarded during his Senate career, and led to his reputation as a maverick! 🙁\n\nMcCain was one of the sponsors of an immigration reform bill with Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2007, and was very proud to speak up on the need to merge the illegal immigrants in this country into the mainstream!\n\nNow, he has condemned President Obama for initiating a lawsuit yesterday against the Arizona immigration legislation, and has come out in a nasty way, calling for the removal of millions of people, who have not been involved in criminal activity, and live in fear of families bring broken up by immigration raids!\n\nThe reality is that John McCain, once open minded and tolerant on the issue of immigration, has become a nativist in the worst manner possible–all this because his ambition to remain in the Senate outdoes his conscience! 🙁\n\nBut then, he has also lied openly about his lifetime of political stands, declaring in the past few months that he is not, and never has been, a maverick, even though his memoir has it in the title, he has used that term himself in past speeches over the years, and Sarah Palin called him that during the 2008 election season, as well as recently, when she campaigned for him in Arizona!\n\nWhile it would be terrible if J. D. Hayworth, his GOP opponent, defeated him in the primary, it would actually be proper justice and punishment for a man who has lost his soul and his conscience, all for another six years in office!\n\nThis is another case of the unwillingness of many politicians at advanced ages to realize that it is time to retire, have some private life with their families, and allow someone else to serve their constituents!\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona is a very admirable person in many ways.\n\nHe has been often seen as a man of principle and independence, and even if one has disagreed with him at various times in his 28 years in Congress, one can always admire him for his courage, his convictions, and his decency.\n\nBut now that he is seeking another term in the Senate, and is facing a conservative revolt led by former Congressman J. D. Hayworth, he is conducting his campaign in a way that is causing him to lose his dignity and good sense!\n\nFirst, as reported earlier, he claims that he is not now, and never has been a “maverick”, despite his regular use of that term over the years, and the reality that he has written his own memoir of earlier years with the word “maverick” in the title. Additionally, Sarah Palin called him a “maverick” when campaigning for him a few weeks ago, and this was constantly emphasized during his 2008 Presidential campaign!\n\nNow, McCain is suggesting that the danger of Iran requires that we “pull the trigger” and go to war with that nation, to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons!\n\nWhile Iran is certainly a worrisome situation, how can Senator McCain suggest we go into a third war when we cannot deal with the dual wars of Iraq and Afghanistan? And the likelihood is that if we were to go to war with Iran without being provoked, China and Russia, who are considering going along with sanctions on Iran, would likely condemn us and back Iran politically if we invaded that country. Plus we would turn off the large number of Iranians who don’t like their government, but do not wish to be bombed and invaded by any other nation. This is what we call the power of nationalism!\n\nSo McCain is making one wonder about his sanity and stability, something always worried about regarding him, because of the torture and imprisonment he experienced long ago during the Vietnam War.\n\nJohn McCain may be a hero, but he may be showing evidence that he is no longer fit to serve in the Senate, based on his trying to revamp his image in ways that are troublesome! 🙁 It is really a very sad situation regarding Senator McCain! 🙁\n\nArizona Senator John McCain has been in the Senate now for 24 years, and has long had a reputation as a “maverick”.\n\nBut now he is denying this reality, even though he has often called himself that, said so in his memoirs, and emphasized it in his 2008 Presidential campaign.\n\nAnd to top it off, his Vice Presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, came to Arizona to campaign for him, and called him a maverick just ten days ago!\n\nBut McCain is running scared, as he faces a right wing challenge from former Congressman J. D. Hayworth in the GOP primary, and is opposed by Tea Party activists.\n\nSo McCain is trying to change his image, but in the process he is repudiating much of what he believed in and advocated for the past 24 years!\n\nHe has always been someone who people respected, even if they did not agree with him. But now he just looks like a typical image of a politician–untrustworthy, dishonorable, unprincipled! Really, he has become a shell of his old self, and that is truly sad! 🙁\n\nThe likelihood is that he will lose his Senate nomination nevertheless, but even if he wins the nomination and defeats his Democratic opponent in November, how would he be able to restore the dignity and stature that he once had? 🙁\n\nMcCain is selling out for another term as a United States Senator! Is being reelected that important, that he is willing to destroy everything he ever believed in? 🙁 What a sad state of affairs, much to be regretted! 🙁"
