        "text": "Former Congressman J.D. Hayworth, in his bid to beat out Senator John McCain as the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, is pulling out all the stops when it comes to fundraising. And now one of his supporters is using the name of a fundraising campaign that raises money for breast-cancer research to raise money for the former congressman..\n\nYou may have raced for the cure, but have you ever raced for the American cure?\n\nApparently, one of Hayworth's supporters considers the ousted congressman as the cure for all things ailing America at the moment, and, next month, J.D.'s fans will have a chance to put their money where their mouths are.\n\nHayworth supporter Renee Cannon will be \"in-line speed skating\" in a 26.2-mile race she's dubbed the \"Race for the American Cure\" on June 6, in Napa Valley, California.\n\nCannon hopes to raise $1,000 for each mile she skates and plans to donate the money to Hayworth's campaign in her attempt to \"fight social liberalism.\"\n\nCannon says on her Web site, \"We all must work hard and make sacrifices to take back our country from those radicals who refuse to listen to the American people.\"\n\nNaming a political fundraising event after a race for cancer research may seem on the over-dramatically tacky side, so we called Cannon for an explanation.\n\n\"It's just a name I came up with,\" Cannon tells New Times. \"I guess [Race for the Cure] was in the back of my mind, I don't know, I didn't really think about it much.\"\n\nFor more info on the \"Race for the American Cure,\" click here. For info on the other Race for the Cure -- the one that raises money for cancer research -- click here."
