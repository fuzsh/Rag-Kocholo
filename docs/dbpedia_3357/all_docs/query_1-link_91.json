        "text": "We need your help.\n\nUnlike most news outlets, the Tucson Sentinel publishes our stories without a paywall. We believe a healthy community depends on everyone having access to quality independent journalism, whether they can afford to pay or not. As a nonprofit organization, we're committed to providing real reporting to everyone in Southern Arizona.\n\nBut a single story can cost us thousands of dollars to report â some take months and months of dogged digging, others require paying for tall stacks of records that officials don't want to provide. Some mean driving to remote corners of Pima County, and some see our reporters sitting through endless government meetings to make sure they get the whole story and not just a quick headline. Our award-winning newsroom has some of the best reporters, photographers & editors in the state, and we're dedicated to getting the story right.\n\nOur pioneering effort to rebuild local news will only work if enough people join our Watchdog Club community of paying members. Please join today for as little as $15/month.\n\nFor those who can't afford to contribute right now, please sign up for one of our free Watchdog Update newsletters, and help the spread word about the Sentinel to your friends, family, neighbors & co-workers. Your contributions help the Sentinel sustain & grow our nonprofit newsroom & bolster our commitment to delivering the important independent news our community needs to thrive.\n\nA smarter Tucson is a better Tucson â and the Sentinel shines a light on this town because we love it. Please join with us today.â\n\nYes!\n\nI want to help TucsonSentinel.com offer a real news alternative!\n\nThe Tucson Sentinel is published by Tucson Investigative Reporting Center Inc., an Arizona nonprofit organization. Your contribution is tax-deductible."
