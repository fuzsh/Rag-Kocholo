        "text": "PHOENIX — Former U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth on Monday kicked off a campaign challenging John McCain, setting up a showdown between well-known Republicans that promises to be the Arizona senator’s toughest re-election battle.\n\nHayworth, a conservative talk-radio host, held a rally before several dozen supporters in Phoenix and was set to start a three-day statewide tour.\n\n“Arizona needs strong, reliable, conservative leadership . . . to stand up to the Democrats’ leftist agenda and offer the conservative solutions we need to get our country moving again,” Hayworth said."
