        "text": "Editor's note: This is the last of an 18-chapter profile of Sen. John McCain, portions of which originally were published in October 1999 and March 2007. It has been updated and expanded. Read more about this project: John McCain’s American Story.\n\n“He’s not a war hero. He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, OK? I hate to tell you.\"\n\nThe speaker disparaging Sen. John McCain's Vietnam War record was not one of the Arizona Republican's far-right critics, who had for years tried to smear him over the five years he spent as a prisoner of war. It was Donald Trump, addressing the July 18, 2015, Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, a regular stop for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nThe celebrity billionaire developer and former host of NBC's \"The Apprentice\" had emerged as the surprise 2016 GOP front-runner.\n\nMcCain was seeking a sixth U.S. Senate term at the time — not challenging Trump for the presidency — but he had gotten crosswise with Trump, who responded in his bombastic and sometimes-offensive manner.\n\nTrump, whose \"bone spurs\" earned him a deferment from serving in Vietnam, a couple of days earlier had attacked McCain on Twitter — Trump's social-media soapbox of choice — as a \"dummy\" who \"graduated last in his class at Annapolis\" and should be defeated in his primary.\n\nThose exchanges marked the beginning of a bitter on-again, off-again feud between Trump and McCain that would drag on for more than two years and, ultimately, reawaken McCain's \"maverick\" impulses even as a health crisis threatened his life.\n\nHow did McCain find himself in this new predicament?\n\n'Gang of Eight'\n\nFive years had passed since McCain faced a conservative primary challenge from former six-term Rep. J.D. Hayworth, whom he systematically dismantled. For a moment, it appeared his fifth Senate term would be his last.\n\nIn May 2012, McCain used $9 million of unspent campaign donations from his 2008 presidential campaign to start the McCain Institute of International Leadership at Arizona State University. It was clearly done with an eye toward his legacy: The think tank's mission was to forge McCain-style leaders and to study and debate the sort of national-security and foreign-policy issues that the defense hawk McCain had focused on throughout his long career on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd despite his tougher border-security rhetoric during the 2010 brawl with Hayworth — etched into the public consciousness due to his \"Complete the Danged Fence\" television ad — McCain returned to bipartisan negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nIn 2013, McCain became the senior GOP negotiator in the \"Gang of Eight,\" four Republicans and four Democrats who came to terms on landmark legislation that, with a wide-reaching package of reforms, aimed to balance border security with a 13-year pathway to citizenship for most of the estimated 12 million immigrants who had settled in the United States without authorization and a modernized visa program for foreign workers.\n\nThe Republicans involved with writing the measure were McCain and Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona. The Democrats were Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado.\n\nAs passed by the Democrat-controlled Senate on a bipartisan 68-32 vote, the Gang of Eight bill would have made an unprecedented investment in the border: $46.3 billion. It once again was not sufficient for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which at the time was led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. House Republicans gave lip service to passing various aspects of immigration reform in a piecemeal fashion, rather than the Senate's comprehensive approach, but nothing ever came of it despite apparently sincere efforts by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and others to find a compromise.\n\nMcCain's new attempt to find consensus to overhaul the nation's long-broken immigration system could have been seen as a signal that he was no longer worried about re-election pressure from his anti-\"amnesty\" critics on the right.\n\nThe anti-McCain wing of the Arizona Republican Party voiced its displeasure.\n\nIn January 2014, party activists formally censured McCain for being too liberal on immigration and other issues such as gun control. The story became a national headline, and it was something of an embarrassment for McCain.\n\nEven though McCain had long had a small, if vocal, group of enemies in his party, they were getting more determined and better organized. They talked about closing the Republican primary to independents, as allowed under a 1998 voter-passed ballot proposition, at least partly because they saw independents as helpful to McCain. The anti-McCain sentiment was far from representative of the party as a whole, but it did seem that, even among Arizona Republicans who weren't die-hard McCain haters, more and more Republicans were receptive to the idea that fresh blood was needed in the Senate.\n\nIf the goal of the censure was to pressure McCain to retire, the rebuke may have had the opposite effect. While he acknowledged that the censure stung, McCain was unbowed. His allies and supporters reasserted their influence in party meetings and ran slates of candidates for local party posts such as precinct committeeman, in some cases ousting anti-McCain activists who called it a \"civil war\" and a \"purge.\"\n\nTimothy Schwartz, who authored the state GOP and Maricopa County GOP resolutions censuring McCain, was dumped as Legislative District 30 GOP chairman in December 2014.\n\n\"This was the epitome of a grass-roots effort, but the censure of the incumbent senior Republican senator absolutely was a factor,\" Gary Hirsch, Schwartz's successful opponent for the position, told The Arizona Republic. \"It was in the poorest of taste and not helpful, in my view, to the overall welfare of the party.\"\n\nOn April 7, 2015, at the age of 78, McCain announced he would run again in 2016, when he would be 80 on Election Day.\n\nMcCain said there was still more that he could do for Arizona and the country. His clout had risen on Capitol Hill. After Republicans recaptured the Senate in the 2014 elections, McCain became chairman of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee, his dream job (after president, of course).\n\n\"I think that, obviously, getting out your vote is still the key to victory,\" McCain told The Republic. \"I know there are many people in the Republican Party who do not want me to stay there. I understand that. For me to think that everybody loves me is a degree of narcissism and delusion that I am not capable of.\"\n\nThe hunt had been on for a McCain primary challenger for several months.\n\nThe New York Times reported Nov. 25, 2014, that national \"tea party\" leaders considered Sarah Palin, McCain's 2008 running mate, \"their fantasy candidate\" to run against McCain. Palin, the former Alaska governor who McCain had plucked from obscurity and made a conservative star, had bought a home in north Scottsdale and was a part-time Arizona resident. However, Palin remained fiercely loyal to McCain and so the idea was a non-starter.\n\n\"I know that they will do everything they can to recruit somebody, but I can promise you it's not Sarah Palin,\" McCain said.\n\nMcCain wound up getting lucky.\n\nReps. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., and David Schweikert, R-Ariz., were both courted by tea-party-aligned organizations such as FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth, but both passed on challenging him.\n\nInstead, his main primary opponent would be a little-known state legislator from Lake Havasu City in western Arizona named Kelli Ward. She would not get the financial backing of groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund that could have helped her compete against McCain.\n\nFor the first time since at least 1992, Democrats fielded a serious contender for his seat. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff was in her third term representing a sprawling rural Arizona congressional district. She was first elected in 2008, lost her seat in the tea-party backlash of 2010, won it back in 2012 and was re-elected in 2014.\n\nBut Trump would become a bigger threat to McCain's sixth term than either Ward or Kirkpatrick.\n\n'He fired up the crazies'\n\nTrump, a Republican, announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015, with a widely panned speech at Trump Tower in New York City.\n\nHe was not taken particularly seriously, but was denounced for abrasive comments about Mexican immigrants.\n\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump said in his remarks. \"... They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\n\nWhile many in the GOP establishment looked at Trump as a joke — a major miscalculation — his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration struck a chord with the same anti-\"amnesty\" conservative base that had it in for McCain.\n\nTrump's combativeness rocketed him to the top of the polls, a lead he would sustain over formidable rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the brother and son of former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, respectively; Rubio, the rising-star senator from Florida; Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; Ben Carson, a conservative retired neurosurgeon; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky; and several others.\n\nAs the 2008 Republican nominee, McCain was asked his opinion of Trump. His criticism of Trump started out mildly, after he first said he hadn't paid much attention to Trump.\n\n\"I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans,\" McCain told The Republic after a June 30, 2015, appearance at Mesa's Falcon Field airport.\n\nThe next month, Trump decided to come to Phoenix for a rally that he later would cite as crucial to the rise of his nascent bid for the White House.\n\nTrump campaign sources subsequently confirmed Trump was aware of a July 10, 2015, Arizona Republic article that quoted McCain again criticizing Trump's comments about Mexicans. The story's headline noted McCain wanted \"no part of Trump's Phoenix rally.\"\n\n\"I just think that it is offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry, but other citizenry, but he's entitled to say what he wants to say,\" McCain said in remarks on MSNBC that were quoted in the Republic article. \"But I guarantee you the overwhelming majority (in Arizona) ... do not agree with his attitude, that he has displayed, toward our Hispanic citizens. We love them.\"\n\nTrump struck back at McCain during the raucous July 11, 2015, rally at the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\n\"We have incompetent politicians, not only the president,\" Trump said. \"I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain.\"\n\nTrump also raised the prospect of a McCain loss in the 2016 primary.\n\n\"I've supported John McCain, but he's very weak on immigration,\" Trump told reporters after the rally. \"... If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.\"\n\nMcCain inflamed the situation with comments about the rally to the New Yorker.\n\n“This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,” McCain told the magazine. “Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.”\n\nThe \"crazies\" insult set off Trump, who demanded that McCain apologize to the \"amazing Americans\" at his rally. Trump also called McCain a \"dummy\" and advocated for his defeat in the Senate primary.\n\nThen came Trump's mocking of McCain for getting captured after he was shot down over North Vietnam on Oct. 26, 1967. Organizations such as the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Concerned Veterans for America, and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America defended McCain and blasted Trump.\n\nTrump's GOP competitors, including Bush, Cruz, Paul, Christie and Walker, also rushed to defend McCain's POW record and military service. So did Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's former Secretary of State. So did McCain's Republican and Democratic challengers Ward and Kirkpatrick.\n\nTrump never would apologize to McCain.\n\nPressure to dump Trump\n\nBut in a way Trump's attacks did McCain a favor because, in the end, even casual voters realized that Trump and McCain could not stand each other. Polls had indicated a potentially close race between McCain and Kirkpatrick, and Democrats sought to tether McCain to Trump, who made one controversial statement after another about women, Muslims, a Gold Star father and others. Ultimately, the Democrats' strategy would not work.\n\nMcCain was in a sensitive spot: He already had problems with conservative voters in Arizona and continuing to bash Trump would only further alienate them. However, he committed early to endorsing whoever Republican voters nominated for president in 2016, and as it increasingly looked like that would be Trump, McCain would come under pressure from Democrats and the media to denounce him. Observations that McCain no longer was a GOP maverick came fast and furious.\n\nIn the primary, Ward did not turn out to be much of a threat despite McCain's vulnerability.\n\nWard, a doctor, did not have a long record in the Arizona Legislature, but the McCain campaign seized on a 2014 meeting that she had held in Kingman to discuss \"community concerns about chemtrails.\" The meeting had gotten some notoriety at the time because the claim that airplanes are spreading dangerous chemicals into the sky through contrails is a fringe conspiracy theory spread by anti-government activists. Ward emphatically denied ever believing in \"chemtrails\" herself, but the McCain campaign argued that she pandered to the conspiracy theory's adherents by not explicitly debunking it to the audience when she had the opportunity. She also brought state environmental officials to the hearing, which McCain's team argued was a waste of taxpayer resources.\n\n\"The people who are concerned about this, I did describe you as relentless,\" Ward said at the 2014 \"chemtrails\" meeting. \"That is not a bad thing to be. It's not a good thing for me as an elected representative ... to ignore what many people in my district are concerned about.\"\n\nWard also appeared on the radio show of conspiracy-monger Alex Jones, who at one point warned her of possible assassination by McCain. \"I just want you to watch your back because that guy is just such a gangster,\" Jones told Ward.\n\n\"Yes, you know, I've had people who tell me, you know, to get an auto-starter on my car, that I should never be starting my own car,\" Ward replied. \"But we are very cautious, and I always have, you know, people around me who are providing security.\"\n\nMcCain's campaign ran online ads branding Ward as \"Chemtrail Kelli,\" a term Ward's campaign called a \"cynical and sexist\" character attack and a sign that McCain was \"running scared silly.\" The nickname stuck and would follow Ward into the 2018 Senate race.\n\nIn another blow to Ward, Trump grudgingly endorsed McCain on Aug. 5, 2016, even though McCain had skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland the month before.\n\n\"I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office,\" Trump said at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. \"And I fully support and endorse his re-election.\"\n\nWard got attention by calling McCain \"weak\" and \"old\" and speculating that he might not live long enough to finish another six-year Senate term. McCain was turning 80 on the day before Arizona's Aug. 30, 2016, primary.\n\nThe Washington Post called Ward's denigration of McCain's health \"one of the nastiest political attacks you’ll ever see.\"\n\n\"So she's saying he's going to die in office? ... Wow,\" Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" said. \"I mean, that's sick. Someone needs to take her diagnosis.\"\n\nMcCain comfortably won renomination in his primary, though some observers said his 51.2 percent of the GOP vote was not that impressive for a former Republican Party presidential candidate. Ward got 39.9 percent and two other less-known GOP candidates split the rest.\n\nAfter the primary, McCain opened a large lead over Kirkpatrick, whom he hammered with ads criticizing her 2010 vote for Obama's Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare.\" She continued to point out that McCain had publicly expressed support for Trump more than 60 times.\n\nMcCain finally withdrew his endorsement of Trump on Oct. 8, 2016, after a vulgar 2005 recording of Trump surfaced. What became known as the \"Access Hollywood\" tape shook the race. It revealed Trump crudely talking about women and even seeming to trivialize sexually groping them.\n\nTrump apologized and downplayed the X-rated conversation as \"locker-room\" talk.\n\nMcCain maintained he had spoken out against Trump when necessary but that he felt an obligation to the Republican voters who chose Trump.\n\n\"When Mr. Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,\" McCain said a couple of days later in his only televised debate with Kirkpatrick. \"It's not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party; he won the nomination fair and square. But I have daughters. I have friends. I have so many wonderful people on my staff. They cannot be degraded and demeaned in that fashion.\"\n\nTrump fumed about McCain's about-face, writing on Twitter, \"The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!\"\n\nThe battling Trump and McCain would both win on Election Day. Trump won the White House in a surprise Electoral College upset over Clinton, whom many had expected to become the first female president in U.S. history.\n\nMcCain easily defeated Kirkpatrick, 53.7 percent to 40.7 percent. Trump also carried Arizona, but McCain dramatically outperformed him. Trump edged Clinton in the state by just 3.5 percentage points, a weak showing by a Republican in a traditional red state.\n\nThe 'maverick' returns\n\nMcCain, as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, was set to be a Republican check on Trump as he took office, particularly on foreign policy. He was one of the few Republicans on Capitol Hill with the stature to do it.\n\n\"I am not a rubber stamp,\" McCain told The Republic in the aftermath of the 2016 election. \"There are maybe 100 Department of Defense positions that require Senate confirmation. I believe that the Constitution requires advice and consent (of the Senate).\"\n\nTrump and McCain had serious disagreements over NATO, Russia and the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n\nMcCain got caught up briefly in the intrigue over a dossier of salacious but unverified research on Trump and his alleged Russian ties. It eventually came out that McCain had gotten a copy of the report and turned it over to the FBI, and that revelation further angered Trump supporters.\n\nThe McCain vs. Trump skirmishes continued. They clashed over Trump's temporary ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations, over an anti-terror raid in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL was killed and over Trump's nominee for White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nIn May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, McCain said the scandals and controversies swirling around the young Trump administration were approaching \"Watergate size and scale.\"\n\nDespite continued hostility between Trump and McCain, it largely remained business as usual in Washington's new era.\n\nThat changed in the summer.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, a sluggish McCain delivered a distracted and garbled line of questioning to Comey, who was giving dramatic testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closely-watched hearing. There was a moment when McCain referred to Comey as \"President Comey.\"\n\nThe reason for McCain's poor performance that day would never be totally clear.\n\nFor his part, McCain would give two explanations. Initially, he said he had stayed up too late the night before watching the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game; months later, McCain would tell Esquire that he had been trying to recite from memory a question for Comey that his friend Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had suggested and he couldn't do it.\n\nThe next month, on July 14, 2017, McCain underwent an emergency craniotomy for a blood clot above his left eye. The medical procedure, performed at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, involved a surgical opening into his skull.\n\nFive days later, McCain's office disclosed that the blood clot was associated with glioblastoma, the aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer that had killed McCain's colleague, Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, in 2009.\n\nThe news hit the political world like an atomic bomb.\n\n\"Senator John McCain has always been a fighter,\" Trump said in a written statement. \"Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon.\"\n\nObama, who defeated McCain in the 2008 race for the Oval Office, praised McCain on Twitter as \"an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known.\"\n\n\"Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John,\" Obama tweeted.\n\nAgainst the advice of his doctors in Arizona, McCain decided to quickly return to the Senate, where his Republican colleagues were readying an effort to dump Obamacare.\n\nGetting rid of the Affordable Care Act was a priority of McCain's. He had campaigned the year before on a promise to repeal and replace it. It also was a top priority of Trump's. However, he had already said he wanted to make sure the new legislation didn't hurt Arizona, which had expanded Medicaid under \"Obamacare.\" He also hadn't been allowed to provide input as the plan was drafted behind closed doors, outside the normal committee process.\n\nWhen he got back to Capitol Hill, the ailing McCain, with a surgical incision visible above his eye, took to the Senate floor. His colleagues watched as he passionately called for the Senate to rise above its partisan gridlock and return to its traditional spirit of civility and bipartisanship.\n\nMcCain talked about the \"true statesmen, giants of American politics\" who had served in the Senate.\n\n\"They came from both parties and from various backgrounds. Their ambitions were frequently in conflict,\" McCain said in his July 25, 2017, speech. \"They held different views on the issues of the day. And they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest.\n\n“But they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively,\" he continued.\n\nMcCain implored his fellow senators to trust each, return to regular order and try to find common ground on issues that require reaching across the aisle.\n\n\"Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet,\" McCain said. \"To hell with them. They don’t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.\"\n\nMcCain reminded the lawmakers that they are not the president's subordinates, but his equal.\n\nMcCain's speech earned cheers from the Democrats and liberals who wanted to save the Affordable Care Act. Then McCain almost immediately got jeers and insults from them after he sided with Republicans to proceed with the GOP effort to gut Obamacare. He was accused of hypocrisy, given that the health-care push was not following regular order.\n\nAs the week wore on and opposition to what critics called \"Trumpcare\" intensified, Senate Republicans scaled back their ambitions, eventually settling on a bill that would largely leave the Obamacare system intact. The so-called \"skinny repeal\" would have ended only the Affordable Care Act's individual and employer insurance mandates and medical-device tax for three years and made other limited changes. Arizona's Medicaid funding, one of the chief concerns of McCain and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, was no longer threatened.\n\nThe situation was tense in the early morning hours of July 28, 2017. Republicans controlled the Senate with a 52-member majority, meaning they and Vice President Mike Pence, the tiebreaker, could only spare two GOP \"no\" votes. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had already signaled opposition to the Republican plan. And word was that McCain was in a bad mood.\n\nTrump and Pence lobbied for McCain's vote. Ducey let McCain know he was fine with the skinny bill, support that assumed it could be improved later in the legislative process.\n\nFlake didn't want Republicans to miss this opportunity to get rid of Obamacare and voted for the skinny repeal.\n\nAnd McCain, in dramatic fashion, strode onto the Senate floor and literally gave the health-care bill the thumbs-down.\n\nThe legislation was dead.\n\nMany saw his vote as settling years of back-and-forth over whether McCain was or was not a maverick.\n\n“I’ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of 'Obamacare' was that it was rammed through Congress by Democrats on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote,\" McCain said in a written statement issued after the vote. \"We should not make the mistakes of the past that has led to Obamacare’s collapse, including in my home state of Arizona where premiums are skyrocketing and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace.\"\n\nMcCain called for a return to \"the correct way of legislating,\" where a health-care bill could be debated in the proper committees, with public hearings and input from both parties and from governors.\n\n\"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve,\" McCain said.\n\nWhile that was McCain's official explanation, speculation abounded about what really motivated him to sink Trumpcare. Some said McCain just wanted to stick it to Trump for the POW slight and everything else that had come up in their feud. It's also likely that, given the brain cancer threat, McCain had been pondering his legacy — and all those Senate statesmen and stateswomen who preceded him — and wanted to cast a vote he felt good about.\n\nA couple of months later, McCain would also help stop a subsequent GOP approach to roll back Obamacare.\n\nMcCain's defiance infuriated Trump, reigniting their feud.\n\nCelebrating 'a life well-lived'\n\nMcCain insisted he held no particular grudge against Trump, including for ridiculing his POW record in 2015.\n\n\"He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both on television as well as Miss America and others,\" McCain said during a September 2017 interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"I was raised in a military family,\" he continued. \"I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day.\"\n\nUpon receiving the National Constitution Center's prestigious Medal of Freedom, McCain delivered an emotional Oct. 16 speech that suggested the United States was forgetting the lessons of history.\n\nIn his remarks, McCain decried the \"half-baked, spurious nationalism\" and slide toward isolationism that seemed to characterize the Trump worldview.\n\nMcCain drew applause when he said:\n\n\"To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain 'the last, best hope of earth' for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.\"\n\nMcCain in August had started chemotherapy and radiation treatment for his brain cancer. He returned to work in the Senate after Labor Day and never let up on his active schedule of chairing Armed Services Committee hearings, keeping tabs on world affairs, and giving speeches.\n\nGiven McCain's grim diagnosis, it also was a time for reflection.\n\nJuly 29, 2017, marked the 50th anniversary of the USS Forrestal disaster that killed 134 people and nearly killed McCain.\n\nOct. 26, 2017, was the 50th anniversary of McCain's getting shot down over North Vietnam and becoming a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain observed this milestone without his former POW cellmate and longtime friend and political supporter, George \"Bud\" Day, a Medal of Honor recipient who had died. He paid tribute to Day and the other POWs.\n\n\"The benefit of hindsight is important, but uppermost on my mind on a day like the 50th anniversary is the incredible honor of serving with people like Bud Day and being in the company of heroes,\" McCain told The Republic. \"I would not have been able to perform as I did had it not been for the leadership and example of those leaders.\"\n\nOn Nov, 21, 2017, two days before Thanksgiving, his daughter Meghan McCain married Ben Domenech, a conservative writer and publisher of the Federalist website. Meghan McCain had become a popular national TV personality on Fox News Channel's \"Outnumbered\" and on ABC's \"The View.\"\n\nThe couple's wedding was at the McCain family cabin in Cornville, near Sedona.\n\nThe elder McCain's health played a role in the timing, Meghan McCain said in announcing her engagement on \"The View.\"\n\n\"Well, we were at Mayo Clinic and my father had his scan, and we got engaged because we decided to sort of celebrate life and celebrate being alive,\" she said.\n\nThe Phoenix City Council in December paid McCain an honor by unanimously voting to name Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's Terminal 3 after him. The airport's Terminal 4 is named for McCain's Senate predecessor, Barry Goldwater.\n\nMeanwhile, McCain's physical condition generated concerns. Weakened by chemotherapy, he was seen on Capitol Hill in a wheelchair. Prior to Christmas 2017, he was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., for a viral infection and for side effects of his chemo and radiation treatments.\n\nHe returned to Arizona on Dec. 17, 2017, and signaled that he intended to return to Washington in January. He missed that goal and was still getting physical therapy at his Cornville home as of March 2018.\n\nJohn McCain acknowledged to \"60 Minutes\" that his doctors had given him a poor prognosis for surviving the brain cancer. He vowed to keep fighting, but also wanted to \"celebrate, with gratitude, a life well-lived\" as he battled the disease.\n\n\"I have feelings, sometimes of fear, of what happens,\" McCain said on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"But as soon as I get that, I say, 'Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You've been around a long time, old man. You've had a great life. You've had a great experience.' \"\n\nNowicki is The Republic's national political reporter.
