        "text": "By JONATHAN J. COOPER\n\nAssociated Press Writer\n\nPHOENIX - Former congressman J.D. Hayworth on Monday kicked off a campaign challenging John McCain, setting up a showdown between well-known Republicans that promises to be the Arizona senator's toughest re-election battle.\n\nHayworth, a conservative talk-radio host, held a rally before several dozen supporters in the parking lot outside his campaign headquarters in Phoenix and was set to start a three-day statewide tour.\n\n\"Arizona needs strong, reliable, conservative leadership ... to stand up to the Democrats' leftist agenda and offer the conservative solutions we need to get our country moving again,\" Hayworth said, as he positions himself as the race's reliable conservative.\n\nConservatives in Arizona have long been skeptical of McCain, in part, for working with Democrats on such issues as campaign finance reform and immigration. McCain has however evaded political threats from the right and lately has staked out solidly conservative positions.\n\nMcCain took a swipe at his challenger at his own campaign event in nearby Tempe around the same time as Hayworth's, reminding listeners of questions that were raised about the former congressman's dealings with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\nReferring to Hayworth's alignment with the Tea Party movement, McCain praised it as a powerful initiative with strong supporters who \"fought against these earmark projects that Mr. Hayworth so proudly proclaimed that he would get for his congressional district.\n\n\"Unfortunately that practice led to corruption, people like Abramoff and other members of Congress who went to jail,\" McCain said.\n\nAs a congressman, Hayworth co-chaired the Congressional Native American Caucus and received more than $150,000 from Indian tribes once represented by Abramoff, who pleaded guilty in a 2006 public corruption investigation.\n\nHayworth donated to charity $2,250 he got from Abramoff but kept the money he received from Abramoff's lobbying clients.\n\nAt his rally, Hayworth pointed to a series of McCain flip-flops as evidence that conservatives can't trust the four-term senator, calling his positions today \"campaign-year conversions\" on issues including gays in the military, climate change, campaign finance and immigration.\n\n\"There are two John McCains,\" he said. \"The one who campaigns like a conservative and the one who legislates like a liberal.\"\n\nMcCain is the clear front-runner, well-known after two presidential campaigns and almost three decades representing Arizona in Congress. He has more than $5 million in the bank, not including the $2.5 million he's already spent, according to campaign finance records.\n\nMcCain has aligned a list of prominent conservative backers, including his former running mate Sarah Palin and recently elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, both of whom will campaign for McCain in Arizona next month.\n\nAt his event, McCain touted the endorsement of a bipartisan group of mayors from small and large Arizona cities.\n\nHayworth, who said last week his campaign is approaching $100,000 in contributions, gained an endorsement on Monday.\n\nA co-founder of the anti-illegal immigration Minuteman group who already had been running against McCain dropped out of the race. Chris Simcox said the name on the ballot matters less than the candidate's message.\n\nHayworth also has big-name conservative backers including Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough policies targeting illegal immigration, and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.\n\nA former television sportscaster, Hayworth was among a wave of Republicans elected to the U.S. House in 1994. Democrat Harry Mitchell defeated him in 2006, winning amid a rough national climate for Republicans and questions about Hayworth and Abramoff.\n\n---\n\nAssociated Press writer Bob Christie in Tempe, Ariz., contributed to this report."
