        "text": "Emerging news for veteran-owned small businesses in the current House draft of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. This draft bill would first require DOD to establish a VOSB prime contracting goal no less than the governmentwide SDVOSB goal (currently 5 percent); second authorize DOD to use VOSB set-asides and sole source contracts to reach this goal. At this time , VA is the only agency with authority to issue VOSB set-aside and sole source contracts (as opposed to SDVOSB). While this is a significant move, it is still a long way to go before becoming law. I recommend VOSB entities monitor the progress for the foreseeable future. #VOSB #SDVOSB #SBA #FederalContracting #businesscoach\n\nOne conversation I continue to have with clients is how TFSA's and RRSP's can benefit their financial plan, depending on their income and goals. This year the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) was added to the options. With all these choices, it's better to have some more information on how to use the \"3 Amigos\": https://lnkd.in/gm_c5uTa\n\nüì¢ ATTENTION Pilot Cities in Just STREETS. Here is the chance to share your story. Not the finished project. But the CHALLENGES to get STARTED. This years CIVITAS #CF2024 calls for speakers, especially cities. Deadline is 30 of May 2024. The conference is in Parma, Italy, in October. Share with other cities and technical partners, how YOUR CITY üñç struggles to get a suitable team together üñçchooses among various issues and locations üñçdiscusses with politicians üñçlearns to work interdisciplinary üñçidentifies potential (new) stakeholders üñçlearns the first steps towards co-creation üñç addresses co-benefits of planned interventions üñçand even maybe has to reshuffel everything and gets back to the start. You don't have to show beautiful results. Rather tell how hard and complicated it is to find a suitable street intervention, bureaucratic, political, regulatory and social hurdles. Because that's reality! Let's give it a try. We are excited to hear your story how to get started. https://lnkd.in/g32uKjs5\n\nWhat does the FAA‚Äôs implementation of the new BABA and EO 14005 requirements mean for contractors? In his latest article, Joey Haughney explains how compliance with these new domestic preference requirements will likely result in higher prices for the use of domestic products and services and increased administrative costs for FAA contractors. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/dUGtYtvi #govcon #federalcontractors #governmentcontracting #baba #smithcurrieoles\n\nToday, I add my voice to #FightingForFairness and call on the Government to give Canadian industry the opportunity to compete in a fair and open #CMMA bidding process. Regardless of who the contract goes to, what matters is transparency and fair competition. Learn more by visiting Fighting for Fairness: https://lnkd.in/dA6t8SG4"
