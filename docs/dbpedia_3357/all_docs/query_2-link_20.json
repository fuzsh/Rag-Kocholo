        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 18 - The announcement by two senators last week that they would return $217,000 in contributions linked to the indicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff has produced calls for other members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, to follow suit or risk being tainted by the money in next year's elections.\n\nMr. Abramoff, a major Republican Party fund-raiser who is the focus of a federal corruption investigation in Washington involving gifts to lawmakers, was long among the most generous lobbyists in the capital in directing political contributions to lawmakers who could help his clients.\n\nThe money, most of it from Mr. Abramoff's Indian tribe clients and their lucrative casino operations, was eagerly accepted by members of Congress until this year.\n\nBut no more. Political strategists working for likely challengers in several 2006 Congressional races have said they intend to publicize the donations, arguing for the ouster of incumbents tied to Mr. Abramoff and his clients.\n\nIn announcing last week that they would return money from Mr. Abramoff's clients and his lobbying partners, Senators Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, made clear that they were trying to distance themselves from accusations that they had done favors for Mr. Abramoff in exchange for the donations.\n\nMr. Burns, who is facing a difficult re-election fight next year in part because of news coverage back home about his links to Mr. Abramoff, called for other lawmakers to return donations from the lobbyist, who is also under indictment in Florida on unrelated fraud charges. \"This is an important step that all public officials should take in order to renew the faith\" of voters, he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
