No, even though I'm in Phoenix, which local people angry about illegal immigration (ie, almost all of them) have started (questionably) to call the second-placed kidnap capital of the world. I'm here to write about John McCain's's primary battle against J.D. Hayworth, whom I caught up with last night at a Tea Party Patriots' meeting at a down-at-heel Ramada in Peoria. I have to say, having been now to many tea-party meetings, that those (who may or may not include the leadership of the NAACP) calling the tea-party people racists do not know whereof they speak. Though I don't share their politics, tea-partiers are mostly decent folk legitimately alarmed by what is happening to the economy and therefore to their own lives. Here in Arizona that includes a sudden collapse in the value of their homes in a state that has gone through a grotesque property-fuelled boom and bust."
