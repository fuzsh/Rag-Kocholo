I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that “JD Hayworth” can refer to two personalities: John David Hayworth Jr. (born in 1958), an American politician, or Jeri Lynn Mooney, known as JD Hayworth (born in 1960 ), an American radio and television personality. Since I don’t have enough information to determine who you are referring to, I will provide a brief genealogy of both. To begin with, John David Hayworth Jr. was born on July 12, 1958, in High Point, North Carolina.

Unfortunately, I do not have any information regarding his genealogy or family lineage. On the other hand, Jeri Lynn Mooney, known as JD Hayworth, was born on July 15, 1960, in High Point, North Carolina. Again, I do not have detailed information on his genealogy or his ancestors. It is possible that these two personalities are related, but without specific information, it is impossible to confirm. I hope this information will still be useful to you.
