        "text": "Logitech's \"Great Wall of G810s\" goes down as one of the most ingenious and impressive spectacles in PAX East history.\n\nAt this year's PAX East show, Logitech built a massive colorful wall of out of 18,400 keyboard LEDs to simulate old-school arcade games. The wall used 160 of Logitech's new G810 RGB mechanical keyboards, and was made possible thanks to custom laser-etched keycaps to make every key simulate a colored pixel. The huge LED wall drew lots of attention at the show, and reportedly took six months of planning to orchestrate.\n\n\"I'm a dork, I'm a nerd, I grew up playing Pac Man, Space Invaders, Asteroids...so I thought 'how cool would it be if we built a huge wall out of our keyboards and we programmed a video game on it,\" Logitech's Vice President and General Manager Ujesh Desai told Gamers Nexus.\n\nWe're only weeks away from the official unveiling of AMD's next-gen Polaris 10 GPU, with new reports from a recent event hosted by the company in Taiwan about Polaris.\n\nThe event doubled as a way of showcasing their next-gen Polaris architecture, as well as the new dual Fiji video card, the Radeon Pro Duo. The upcoming Polaris 10 has a TDP of 175W, but will \"actually consume much less than that\", reports WCCFTech.\n\nThe Polaris 10 reportedly hits around 4000 points in 3DMark FireStrike Ultra, compared to the R9 Fury X and GeForce GTX 980 Ti which also hit around 4000 points. All AMD will have to do is hit the $300 (or so) price point on the Polaris 10, and it would be a winner if it consumes less than 175W, and cranks out GTX 980 Ti like performance.\n\nThe Electronics Sports League has banned YouPorn's sponsored eSports team.\n\nYouPorn's official eSports team Team YP is no longer permitted to compete in sanctioned ESL tournaments. The ESL's regulation isn't new, and it prohibits any sponsors of \"widely known for pornographic ... or other adult/mature themes and product\" from entering teams in ESL events, thus Team YP--and any teams like it--are barred from ESL competitions. An ESL representative reached out to us to clarify that Team YP has been asked by the ESL to change its name or risk being disqualified from events.\n\n\"Advertising pornography is not legal in the markets we operate in, and the vast majority of partners we're working with have strict \"no drugs, no alcohol, no pornography\" rules that we've contractually taken on board. These aren't new rules, but ones that have been in our rulebooks for a long time. We have spoken to Team YP manager earlier this year and in that conversation we've explained the situation and rules in detail, and offered to look for potential alternatives in a bigger group. At the same time, we're consulting with our legal teams about this. We will inform the team and the management as soon as we have any updates,\" reads a statement provided to TweakTown by the ESL.\n\nWhat would it be like to play Fallout 4 and never leave Sanctuary Hills, desperately scrounging for resources and relying on settlers to bring fresh materials in? Is it even possible to have fun, or even actually play like this? One Fallout 4 player proves that you can indeed accomplish such a feat, but it'll turn you into a cruel, reigning despot.\n\nA Redditor named Sloth-King decided to test out the social dynamics of Fallout 4's settlement system and play the game never leaving Sanctuary. Surprisingly, he was quite successful--but it changed him into a horrible tyrant. Sloth-King chronicles his journey as a Wasteland king in a massive Imgurl gallery, displaying what it's like to play Fallout 4 in this manner...and it's pretty eye-opening.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty interesting, and I never thought about trying to do such a thing before--being on PC I tend to just use console commands to instantly zap in anything I'd ever need. Sloth-King's adventure proves just how impressive Bethesda's settlement system is, and how far you can push it.\n\nWe all know the iPhone doesn't have expandable storage, but that doesn't stop companies like SanDisk thinking outside of the square with its new iXpand Flash Drive.\n\nSanDisk's new iXpand Flash Drive is a flash drive that will ensure you'll never run out of space on your iPhone. It's a small, great looking dongle that expands the storage on your iPhone. It does this by featuring a flexible, fold-out Lightning port that will fit into \"most\" hard and soft cases.\n\nWhen used with the SanDisk iXpand Drive app, which has been \"completely redesigned\" from feedback, pictures and videos you take on your iPhone will be saved to the iXpand by default, instead of your iPhone. SanDisk has also included a USB 3.0 connector to transfer your pictures, videos or music to your PC - which also lets you do things you can't do on your iPhone normally, like cut/copy/paste/deleting files onto your SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive.\n\nVR is all the rage right now, with Square Enix wanting to jump right into the deep end, teasing Hitman GO in VR at PAX East 2016 over the weekend.\n\nDestructoid were on site, reporting that all of the levels \"are the same as they were in the original game, but the camera can now be rotated with analog sticks, and you can zoom in with the controller or by leaning your body forward to take a closer peak at GO's diorama-like environments\".\n\nSquare Enix has said that Hitman GO VR will be exclusive to Oculus, which means it'll only work on the Rift and Gear VR (Oculus collaborated with Samsung on Gear VR). Hitman GO VR won't hit the PlayStation VR, or the HTC Vive. The company is hoping you'll reach deeper into your wallet to buy the potentially fourth version of the same game, something you might already own on mobile, consoles, and the PC - and now, VR.\n\nMirror's Edge Catalyst looks like utter crap on the Xbox One, but on the PC? It looks pretty damn good, especially cranked up to 4K, thanks to some screenshots from DSOGaming.\n\nThe site ran the closed beta of Mirror's Edge Catalyst at 4K, where they note that VRAM limitations happen at 4K, with the game requiring more than 6GB of framebuffer. At 1080p, the site reports that they were hitting a minimum framerate of 70FPS on Ultra settings on their GeForce GTX 690.\n\nMirror's Edge Catalyst is using more of our CPU cores too, thanks to the Frostbite 3 engine scaling across multiple CPU threads more efficiently. There aren't many graphics options to tweak according to DSOGaming, with distance textures \"kind of low-res\". To finish, the site says that Mirror's Edge Catalyst \"looks and play beautifully on the PC, even in its current beta state\".\n\nAMD is days away from pushing its Radeon Pro Duo into the wild, its first dual-GPU video card since the infamous Radeon R9 295X2. The press slides are now out - even before I received them (thanks, AMD...) and now we know the official specs - even though we kinda knew that from the constant flow of leaks on the Radeon Pro Duo.\n\nThe Radeon Pro Duo features 2 x Fiji XT cores built on the 28nm process, the same GPU powering the Radeon R9 Fury X. We have 4096 stream processors, so with two GPUs we have a total of 8192 stream processors on the Radeon Pro Duo. This is joined by 256 TMUs per GPU (512 TMUs in total) and 64 ROPs per GPU (128 ROPs total). This provides the dual-GPU video card with an insane 16.4 TFLOPs of performance, which is a huge jump on the 8.6 TFLOPs of compute performance from the R9 Fury X.\n\nThe GPUs are clocked at 1GHz, while the 4GB of HBM1 per GPU (8GB HBM1 total) is clocked at 500MHz, and with its 4096-bit memory bus, we have 1024GB/sec of memory bandwidth. There's a 350W TDP on the card, which is not too bad at all considering the R9 Fury X has a 275W TDP, while the price is a huge $1499. This isn't a card for gamers wanting to hit 1080p 60FPS, or even 4K gamers - this is a card for the serious, insane enthusiasts who want 4K 60FPS constant, or multi-monitor/VR gamers.\n\nThe researchers at CERN have just released an insane 300TB of data from the Large Hadron Collider, with the data itself from 2011.\n\nA physicist who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid detector, Kati Lassila-Perini explains: \"Once we've exhausted our exploration of the data, we see no reason not to make them available publicly. The benefits are numerous, from inspiring high school students to the training of the particle physicists of tomorrow. And personally, as CMS's data preservation coordinator, this is a crucial part of ensuring the long-term availability of our research data\".\n\nThe raw data from the detectors, as well as the \"derived\" data sets can be used with tools released by CERN. There's even an entire CERN Linux environment, where you can boot up a virtual machine and start playing with scripts and apps.\n\nWe have been all over DOOM news for the last few months, with our recent stories like the PC version of DOOM being neglected, and the game having the 'trademark id Tech texture streaming issues' on consoles. I don't know how Bethesda and id Software let this happen, but all developers are doing it these days.\n\nWell, on the /r/pcmasterrace subreddit, user 'alkavan' asked \"Hey, seriously, can someone actually explain to me what's wrong with the new DOOM? I pre-ordered it but for nice price with b-day discount voucher on GMG. And of-course I would never per-order any game now days, but in 1993 when I actually met a computer DOOM, then DOOM II were one of the few, first games I ever saw on PC. I just had to as a tribute. So am I gonna get lots of COD crap here? fuck (Will mention, I never actually played any modern COD game except first and second one)\".\n\n'Laxcc' replied with a golden reply, saying: \"People expected fast skillful classic arena multiplayer shooter for PC, they got slow generic console multiplayer shooter clone with grind shit like loadouts etc..\". '8oD' replied, adding \"You level up, FFS\" which is an obviously gameplay trait in today's games. 'Laxcc' replied back, adding: \"Leveling/Unlocking etc. in shooters is a shitty feature. If game is good it does not need it. Its a shi**y crutch for nolifers to gain advantage just because they farmed first days by playing 3 days stright without sleep so they can stomp people without requiring player skill or training\"."
