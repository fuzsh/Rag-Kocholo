        "text": "Easily Create Org Charts to Map Your Company\n\nAn org chart is a simple, graphical representation of the people in your company (or other organization) and the relationships between them. An up-to-date org chart helps you find out where to go for the information you need.\n\nChart your organisation\n\nAn org chart consists of boxes that represent individuals and their roles and connectors that represent the relationships between them. In most organizations, this is represented by the president or CEO at the top, branching down through layers of direct reports.\n\nA good org chart may also include other helpful information, like contact details, links to departmental pages or sites, and more.\n\nBelow is a few examples of how org charts used:\n\nBusiness group org charts show manager and employee relationships\n\nHR org charts show employee details\n\nDepartmental org charts show relationships between corporate divisions, regardless of personnel shifts\n\nReorg org charts help employees understand how business group alignments have changed\n\nGovernment org chart shows chain of command\n\nHospital org charts show departmental responsibility\n\nIT org charts show how separate groups deliver a single service to the business\n\nPut down the PowerPoint\n\nIn the old days, org charts were often shared by PowerPoint or PDF, which meant that the entire organization was reliant on one individual who had that file stored on his or her hard drive. And that usually led to charts that were outdated and hard to find. With Gliffy, your org chart is live, ongoing, and collaborative, so everyone can pitch in to make sure it is always correct and up-to-date. And because Gliffy is online, you can even add interactive elements, like page and email links.\n\nEven better, our full shape library and drag-and-drop editor make it easy to create clear, visually interesting org charts, whether you have and org chart design experience or not. You can even upload images for a photo org chart, so you will always be able to put a face with the name.\n\nPlot your status and share your goals with Gliffy’s SWOT analysis\n\nA SWOT analysis is a structured planning method used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats involved in a project or in a business venture. A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a product, place, industry or person\n\nGliffy’s online SWOT analysis tools and templates are a simple, organized way to approach complicated goal-setting.\n\nMap your goals\n\nInternally, you have Strengths and Weaknesses . Externally, you are faced with Opportunities and Threats. A SWOT analysis lets you look at these complicated factors in a simple, four-square diagram that gives you more insight on strategies that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nBusinesses, nonprofits, and governments use SWOT diagrams to successfully navigate and solve a wide array of problems. Some of the problems are listed below:\n\nCompetitive analyses\n\nProduct line expansions\n\nGo-to-market strategies\n\nCrisis remediation\n\nFund-raising tactics\n\nCommunicate and share\n\nGliffy Online offers templates, shapes, and formatting tools that make it easy to build quick-and-dirty SWOTs to resolve immediate issues, or more professional diagrams for presentations and long-term projects. You can keep your diagram private, share with just a few collaborators, or publish it to a blog or Web site.\n\nAny organisation especially these days due to recession use this application to evaluate any task before actually executing it.\n\nDrag and drop shapes from the library\n\nUse of different shapes to explain concepts enhances understanding. One of the benefits of using Gliffy is that it has a lot of resources which you can use from its library. You can find any shape you want to use on the sidebar.Just drag the shape you want to use onto the page.\n\nFrom the above diagram, the sidebar has all different shapes which you can drag and use. You can use squares, triangles or even circles depending on your choice. Sometimes shapes are more effective to use than simple text.\n\nDraw connectors between shapes\n\nGliffy has a connector tool which basically links the shapes you would have used in your diagram.This connector tool is so easy to use.Switch to the connector tool, then drag a connector between any two connection points on any two shapes.\n\nType to add text\n\nYou can add text to your shape simply by just selecting any shape or line and start typing.The benefit of that it gives more information and detail to your diagrams which you might have used.\n\nChange colours, fonts and shadows\n\nOne of the other many advantages of using Gliffy is that you can select any symbol or line and open the style menu to customize the object’s appearance, change text properties or add hyperlinks. If you want to highlight some important text, you can easily do that using resources in Gliffy.Use of different colours and fonts help in emphasizing important text.\n\nCustomize your connectors\n\nConnectors are very important when you are using diagrams because they show you the relationship between the shapes.Use of arrows show which way to follow or stages or steps to follow. You can change the line style, weight, and color, and modify the line type. You can use a bold line with bright colours for emphasis to arrows that point to the main concepts of your topic when you are presenting. Arrows are handy in diagrams because they show you the flow of content\n\nWhat is Gliffy?\n\nGliffy is one of the software applications which is handy enough for use especially with people who are in third level institutions particularly computing students.Gliffy is an online application that makes it easy for you to create, share, and collaborate with diagrams. It looks and feels like a desktop application, but it works through your web browser, so there is nothing to install or maintain.\n\nYou can Use Gliffy As\n\nNetwork diagram software\n\nFlow chart software\n\nFloor plan software\n\norg chart software\n\nSWOT analysis\n\nWireframe software\n\nSite map software\n\nUML software\n\nBusiness process modelling software\n\nVenn diagram software\n\nProducts From Gliffy\n\nGliffy Online\n\nGliffy Confluence Plugin\n\nGliffy JIRA Plugin\n\nCreate a Flowchart\n\nYou can use flowcharts to clarify and document complex relationships between people, processes and sets of data by breaking them down to their component parts and expressing them visually. Sometimes they are also used for fun.\n\nCreate a Network Diagram\n\nA network diagram which is also known as a network map shows the way different components of a computer network interact with each other. It can be used to keep track of, troubleshoot or plan home or professional networks. A network diagram can be used to show common network components which might include servers, routers, nodes and hubs.\n\nUse Gliffy Network Diagram Software To\n\nPlan out a home or organisation computer network\n\nTroubleshoot, report and share network issues\n\nKeep track of all network components\n\nClearly see how different components interact\n\nGliffy Is Easy to Use\n\nGliffy works in all modern web-browsers like Google and features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

Everything is available online and that is why there is no need to download anything.\n\nUbuntu’s stunning first release smartphone.\n\nThe first Ubuntu-powered phone has gone on sale in Europe. It arrives at a time when the market is so extremely competitive. It was finally launched two years after failing to generate crowdfunding. Rectangular-shaped and stylised like most of the smartphones, it comes with a promise of a different experience.\n\nThe company behind Ubuntu is Canonical. It runs one of the largest and most popular distributions of the open-source operating system Linux. Ubuntu phone runs on an operating system used in desktops, laptops and servers.\n\nAquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition\n\nThe phone is officially called the Aquaris E45.5 Ubuntu Edition, from Spanish firm BQ and like most of the projects based on open-source ideas (such as Android) keeps the needs of developers in mind. This isn’t a bad idea, considering that Ubuntu is starting from scratch in this market and must build up an ecosystem around its phone. The phone itself is limited in terms of the number of apps available compared to Apple and Android phone users, only a small fraction are compatible with Ubuntu – at launch and these include Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Time Out, Yelp, and the Cut the Rope puzzle game. Ubuntu plays also to the mind-set of open-source developers, suggesting that consumer content and services become integral to the core phone experience. The company aims to creating a tight ecosystem of consumers and developers that can interact with each other through a collaborative platform build with both their needs in mind, encouraging them to develop apps and other software for the phone.\n\nUbuntu’s approach to information\n\nUbuntu comes into the phone market with a more radical approach to how the information is shared. Most phone users are not developers, and the question is why would an open-source approach encourage customers to buy the phone? Here Canonical is bringing something rather more radical to the table, what it calls scope.\n\nScopes is a technology which aims to please content developers and content consumers. With names such as NearBy, Today, Music and News, they are an interface that draws together content from many sources into a single customisable screen. For example, Today brings together data from weather, calendar and contacts sources. NearBy brings data from services such as Foursquare, Yelp, and Time Out to find recommendations for bars or restaurants. Photos pulls in images taken with the phone and those on Facebook, Flickr, or Instagram.\n\nFor content developers, scopes provides visibility and a dedicated space to display their content to users. In this way scopes actually do away with the need for apps in the sense that they exist on current phone platforms. Built from straightforward HTML5, scopes pages can be easily edited and are cross-platform compatible. This is a neat business model for content providers, although whether customers will find this a more appealing and intuitive method than the phone-plus-apps model they’ve become accustomed to remains to be seen.\n\nThe Ubuntu phone is reasonable prized costing around €169.90 in Europe. The phone’s hardware specs are relatively modest– a quad-core ARM Cortex A7 1.3 GHz processor and Mali 400 GPU from MediaTek, 1Gb RAM, 8Gb of internal storage and a 540×960 (qHD) screen. It also comes with an 8-megapixel rear camera and boasts a better-than-average quality 5-megapixel front camera with which it can generate full HD video for improved videocalling, Skype, and selfies. In any case, it is cheaper than many other competing smartphones by hundreds of pounds.\n\nThis low price point is important to encourage buyers to experiment with it. Not a bad tactic – if it does not also convey a message of a substandard product to potential customers. We have only to look to early secondary adoption of-open-source software to see how products that cost less can also be misunderstood to be of lesser quality.\n\nIt’s too early to tell if Canonical will attract users to the Ubuntu phone – but the phone’s first limited release sold out on its first day on sale. It has innovative new technology, a simple and loosely controlled collaborative platform, a low price and an eager developer base on its side. This is all part of Canonical’s strategy of convergence across platforms of a single operating system and approach.\n\nIt is difficult to see iPhone users moving to Ubuntu, but it may take a chunk out of Android’s user base. Will this help or hinder the growth of an open-source approach and products in a market where Apple is the most entrenched player? Do we need yet another platform? Does this lead to fragmentation of platforms at a more abstract level? Shuttleworth, the owner of Ubuntu has played his hand; now we must see how others react."
