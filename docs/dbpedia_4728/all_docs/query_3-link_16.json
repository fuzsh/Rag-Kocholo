If you have experience in porting code to Android devices or are generally knowledgeable in terms of porting, working with the Kernel and other core bits and pieces of a distribution, this might be interesting to you.\n\nMoreover, there's really no way to tell which future devices people will choose to work on, however there is a working list of devices that the community is working to enable here:\n\nhttps://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/\n\nRelease Notes in the blog\n\nBe sure to check for Known Issues before you proceed.\n\nAnd Device Specific Issues as well.\n\nApplications Available\n\nThe Developer Preview comes with the following functioning applications:\n\nGallery\n\nPhone (Dialler, SMS, Address Book)\n\nCamera\n\nBrowser\n\nMedia Player\n\nNotepad\n\nMusic app\n\nCalculator\n\nWeather app\n\nInstalling Applications\n\nDownload application from store. Supported Application can be found in App-Store!\n\nOr you can use The SDK to create an application of your own.\n\nOnly for Evaluation\n\nQuoting from Ubuntu Wiki (obsolete URL removed!):\n\nThe Touch Developer Preview project provides the open source code for enthusiasts and developers, to familiarise themselves with Ubuntu's phone and tablet experience and develop applications on spare devices.\n\nIt is currently work in progress and intended for enthusiasts who want to contribute testing and building the platform.\n\nFurther quoting from their Install page (obsolete URL removed!):\n\nIt does not provide all the features and services of a retail phone and cannot replace your current handset.\n\nThis process will delete all data from the device. Restoring Android will not restore this data.\n\nSo be sure to do a complete backup before venturing out.\n\nFlashing the device\n\nHead here for instructions on flashing your device.\n\nWhat to expect after flashing\n\nShell and core applications\n\nConnection to the GSM network (on Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4)\n\nPhone calls and SMS (on Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4)\n\nNetworking via Wi-Fi\n\nFunctional camera (front and back)\n\nDevice accessible through the Android Developer Bridge tool (adb)\n\nDaily use of the phone\n\nAdvanced usage\n\nMore Ubuntu Touch Documentation\n\nNOTE: This answer was quite old, with many obsolete URLs! Many of them are migrated and that data not available on newer portal, I have tried to keep original answer as it is with this edit. Help this answer to serve better!\n\nIt's certainly not slated as a supported hardware and I would say it's unlikely to ever officially become such. The only two tablets supported are the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. Phone support is again only slated for Nexus devices (Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus).\n\nYou may be able to hack it on but given the differing hardware, you'd have to do quite a bit of work.\n\nAs of tomorow (02-21-2013) there should be downloadable images available that will work on the Google Nexus (by Samsung), Nexus 4, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10.\n\nThey will only work on those 4 devices cause they've been specifically compiled for that hardware.\n\nSince the code will be published online it is to be expected that over the coming weeks and month many other devices will get ports – either officially from Canonical or from independent developers – that will allow you to flash it on your specific hardware.\n\nGood places to look for future information regarding 'Ubuntu for Tablets/Phones' (and especially ports) would probably be OMG! Ubuntu! , Phoronix or ubuntu-news\n\nUpdate:\n\nSee this page for more official information of porting Ubuntu touch Ubuntu Wiki as of tomorow (02-22-2013) it will have detailed information of what needs to be done to port to other devices.\n\nOn OMG!Ubuntu → http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-phone-download-will-be-ready-late-february. Source of Ubuntu Phone OS (UPOS) will be aviaible. But that is build for Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4, don't Nokia.\n\n.IMG file - probably.\n\nN9 is great phone, and UPOS can be installed... also, hardware is same as lot of phones, one of that is Galaxy Nexus, phone where UPOS is presented.\n\nIf developers can build Android for N9, developers can build UPOS for N9. Wait, and N9 will be on UPOS support list in future.\n\nAlso, Android drivers can be used for UPOS. Android drivers for N9 exist. Android drivers + Nexus UPOS build = N9 UPOS build. That's my mind.\n\nWill Ubuntu for phone run well on a Samsung Galaxy Tab2 with 3G?\n\nSome background:\n\nThe Ubuntu for Phone build is for phones.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab2 (7\" or 10.1\") is a tablet.\n\nA tablet with 3G has mobile 'broadband' data capabilities.\n\nSo, with a 3G-capable tablet you can use VoIP, but not make 'mobile' phone calls. (Unless you add some add-on 'device' to the tablet.) That equally applies regardless of what OS is present on the tablet.\n\nA different question (which you did not ask) is whether there will be a version of Ubuntu that will work on the Galaxy Tab2.\n\nI think you can use any Hardware/Device in as much it meets the following requirements.\n\nThe hardware requirements are quite acceptable. The Entry level Ubuntu smartphone needs to have at least a 1Ghz Cortex A9 (single core as the bare minimum), 512MB or 1GB memory, a 4-8GB eMMC + SD for storage, and Multi-touch capability.\n\nThe high-end Ubuntu \"superphone\" is a little more demanding and will need at least Quad-core A9 or Intel Atom processors, minimum 1GB for memory, minimum 32GB eMMC + SD for storage, and Multi-touch.*\n\nI don't know if it support tablet because of screen resolution. it will be awesome though on tablet.\n\nSources: Click Here\n\nI think the XDA site should also be mentioned here. For a lot of phones and tablets this is a good place where development is done. There is no support, or at least not from Ubuntu or canonical, but there is a large community trying to get it to work. Here they have a list of phones on which development is going on to get Ubuntu touch on it. Be sure to read trough the forums to see whether everything you need works.\n\nWhat most people overlook is that Ubuntu Touch as it has been running on the officially supported devices until now runs almost two Operating Systems at the same time, not one.\n\nYou have Ubuntu Touch running the device and being your interface and you have a LXC container providing Android services. While the LXC container is not a full fledged Android with a UI, this setup consumes a bit more resources and complicates porting for non-Android devices."
