There has not been much activity on the former, but UBPorts has recently announced the first OTA-1 stable release for supported devices, minus Nexus 4 and 5 for now.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThis release brings bug fixes, experimental AGPS support, he UBports Welcome app, the OpenStore, and the Terminal and File Browser are preinstalled. It should work on OnePlus One, FairPhone 2, Optimus L90, BQ Aquaris M10 HD / FHD, and possibly some other models.\n\nThey also mentioned work on Halium – a project aiming to standardize the Android hardware compatibility layer between many Linux distributions – has been progressing nicely, and it can now boot both Ubuntu Touch and Plasma Mobile. Convergence still needs some work, but one of the developers demoed it on a Nexus 5 here. Anbox support is also planned in order to support Android apps in Ubuntu, but it’s a low priority for now.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about future releases, or helping fix bugs, you can do so on the Milestones page.\n\nTweet Canonical may have stopped working on Unity, Mobile & Convergence for Ubuntu last April, but since then, at least two teams have worked on Unity and mobile convergence alive…\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMarvell 88W8987xA Wireless SoC Supports 802.11ac & 802.11p WiFi, Bluetooth 5 for V2X & IVI Automotive Applications\n\nMarvell has introduced the new 88W8987xA wireless chip with 802.11ac, 802.11p and Bluetooth 5 Connectivity for V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) and IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment) automotive applications such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems, and secure wireless Gateway systems.\n\nKey features of Marvell 88W8987xA family:\n\nConnectivity\n\nWiFI – IEEE 802.11ac (wave2) up to 433 Mbps / IEEE 802.11p WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) / 1609.x\n\nBluetooth 5 including Bluetooth Low Energy Angle of Arrival and Departure (AoA/AoD)\n\n2x antenna configuration for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence\n\nHost Interfaces – SDIO 3.0 interface (4-bit SDIO and 1-bit SDIO) @ up to 208 MHz; high-Speed UART interface (for Bluetooth only)\n\nAudio Interfaces – Digital audio interfaces (PCM)\n\nTemperature Range – -40°C to +105°C (AEC-Q100 Grade 2 Qualification)\n\nPackage – pin 8×8 mm QFN with wettable flanks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe family now includes three pin-to-pin compatible SoCs:\n\n88W8987A with 802.11ac + Qualified Bluetooth 5 Functionality\n\n88W8987PA with 802.11p + Qualified Bluetooth 5 Functionality\n\n88W8987SA with switchable 802.11ac/802.11p + Qualified Bluetooth 5 Functionality\n\nThe first time I read the SoC supported 802.11p, I though it might be a typo, but it’s just another WiFi standard specifically designed for automotive applications operating in the 5.9GHz range as explained on Wikipedia:\n\nIEEE 802.11p is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard to add wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), a vehicular communication system. It defines enhancements to 802.11 (the basis of products marketed as Wi-Fi) required to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. This includes data exchange between high-speed vehicles and between the vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, so called V2X communication, in the licensed ITS band of 5.9 GHz (5.85-5.925 GHz). IEEE 1609 is a higher layer standard based on the IEEE 802.11p.[1] It is also the base of a European standard for vehicular communication known as ETSI ITS-G5.\n\n88W8987xA drivers are readily available for the Android, Linux and QNX drivers are available for 88W8987xA, and the family of SoC is sampling today, with mass production starting in Q4 2017.\n\nVia eeNews Europe\n\nTweet Marvell has introduced the new 88W8987xA wireless chip with 802.11ac, 802.11p and Bluetooth 5 Connectivity for V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) and IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment) automotive applications such as Dedicated Short Range…\n\n↧\n\n$249 Pico Goblin All-in-One VR Headset is Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Processor\n\nVR headset prices range from just a few dollars for cardboard ones used with your smartphone to close to a thousand dollars for the most advanced models. The large price differences are because some models rely on your smartphone, while others leverage your computer’s processing processor, and the rest include all the electronics and display needed to work without external hardware. Companies started to launch Android All-in-One VR headset last year, but they were either rather expensive, or not quite good enough for anything except watching videos. Pico may have found the right balance between performance and price with their Goblin Virtual Reality Headset with a 5.5″ display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor couple with 3GB of RAM, and a $249 price tag.\n\nPico Goblin specifications:\n\nSoC – Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (or 821?)

The specifications are not quite complete, as the company did not mention any information about the lenses, IPD adjustment or weight.\n\nThere’s not a single mention of “android” or “operating system” either on the company’s website, but it’s most certainly running some version of Android like Nibiru. It’s also unclear whether Google DayDream is supported.\n\nPico claims 50 games will be supported at launch, and you’ll get 5 premium games when you purchase the headset. As mentioned in the introduction the price is $249 for a limited time after which it will cost $269, and includes worldwide shipping.

People have been doing this for a while, but elliotboney’s solution looks neater than most with a 3D printed part that’s attached on top of the power supply.\n\nOnce you have printed the part, which may need to be adapted to to your power supply, you just need a few banana jacks, and a power switch before connecting with the cables:\n\nI basically kept 3 wires of each voltage, a 3 black wires for each ground. So 3 yellow for 12V, 3 Red for 5V and 3 Orange for 3V. Any extra wires I cut as close to the board as possible and put a little piece of heat shrink over the cut wires just to prevent shorts.\n\nFor the switch, you’ll use the green wire and a ground. Internally, you’ll want to connect the gray wire and an extra 5V (red) wire.

That’s until today, and I found out about HD3S TV box running Android 6.0 on Amlogic S905X processor.\n\nHD3S specifications:\n\nSoC – Amlogic S905X quad core ARM Cortex-A53 @ up to 1.5GHz with a penta-core Mali-450MP GPU\n\nSystem Memory – 1GB DDR3\n\nStorage – 8GB eMMC flash + micro SD card slot up to 64GB\n\nVideo Output – HDMI 2.0a up to 4K @ 60 Hz, and AV port (composite video)\n\nAudio – Output via HDMI, and AV port (stereo audio); dual speaker and built-in dual microphone (up to 3 meters range)\n\nVideo Codecs – 4K VP9 @ 60 fps, 4K 10-bit H.265 @ 60 fps, 4K H.264 up to 30 fps\n\nWebcam – 1.0 MP webcam up to 720p (Omnivision OV9712 sensor)\n\nConnectivity – 10/100M Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz only), and Bluetooth 4.0\n\nUSB – 2x USB 2.0 ports\n\nMisc – Power button, IR receiver, WiFi and camera status LED\n\nPower Supply – 5V/2A\n\nDimensions- 210 mm (L) x 52 mm (D) x 54 mm (thickness)\n\nThe box ships with an AC adapter, a HDMI cable, an IR remote control, and a user guide.\n\nHD23S can be purchased on Aliexpress for $119.99 including shipping. The price is quite steep considering you could achieve pretty much the same with a low-end Amlogic S905X TV box (<$30), and a USB webcam ($5). Having said that, there are sometimes compatibility issues with Skype and Hangout in TV boxes, and we’d hope those would have been tested in HD23S.

Both solutions share most of the same specifications:\n\nMCU -STMicro STM32F4 ARM CORTEX-M4 MCU @ 168 MHz with 192 kB RAM, 1 MB Flash\n\nExternal Storage – 1x micro SD slot\n\nUSB – 1x USB 2.0 host port with 1A charging capability; 1x micro USB port for debugging and programming via FTDI chip\n\nExpansion Headers\n\nhRPi expansion header for\n\nCORE2-ROS – a single board computer Raspberry Pi 3 or ASUS Tinker Board\n\nCORE2 – an ESP32 based Wi-Fi module\n\n2x motor headers (hMot) with\n\n4x DC motor outputs with built-in H-bridges\n\n4x quadrature encoder inputs 1 A cont./ 2 A max. current per output (2 A/4 A current when paralleled)\n\n6x servo ports with selectable supply voltage (5 / 6 / 7.4 / 8.6 V) 3 A cont./4.5 A max. current for all servos together\n\n6x 6-pin hSens sensor ports with GPIOs, ADC/ext. interrupt, I2C/UART, 5 V out\n\n1x hExt extension port with 12x GPIO, 7x ADC, SPI, I2C, UART, 2 x external interrupts\n\n1x CAN interface with onboard transceiver\n\nDebugging – DBG SWD (Serial Wire Debug) STM32F4 debug port; micro USB port for serial console\n\nMisc – 5x LEDs, 2x buttons\n\nPower Supply – 6 to 16V DC with built-in overcurrent, overvoltage, and reverse polarity protection\n\nDimensions – 94 x 85 mm\n\nOn the software side, Husarion provide a set of open source libraries for robots as part of their hFramework, using DMA channels and interrupts internally to handle communication interfaces. The company has also prepared tutorials dealing with ROS introduction, creating nodes, simple kinematics for mobile robot, visual object recognition, running ROS on multiple machines, and SLAM navigation. CORE2 board can also be programming using the Arduino IDE, and finally Husarion Cloud allows you to securely create a web user interface to control the robot, and even program the robot firmware from a web browser.\n\nThat means you can program your robot using either the Web IDE, or offline with an SDK plus Visual Studio Code and the Husarion extension. The development work flow is summarized above.\n\nCORE2 boards can be used for a variety of projects such as robotic arms, telepresense robots, 3D printers, education robots, drones, exoskeletons, and so on. If you want to learn about robots, but don’t have LEGO Mindstorms and don’t feel comfortable making your own mechanical parts yet, ROSbot might be a good way to start with CORE2-ROS board, LiDAR, a camera, four DC motors with encoders, an orientation sensor (MPU9250), four distance sensors, a Li-Ion battery (3 x 18650 batteries) and a charger, as well as aluminum mechanics. It also happens to be the platform they use for their tutorials.\n\nROSbot\n\nYou’ll find all those items, and some extra add-on boards, on the CrowdSupply campaign, starting at $89 for CORE2 board with ESP32 module, $99 for CORE2-ROS board without SBC, and going up to $1,290 for the complete ROSbot with ASUS Tinker Board. Shipping is free to the US, and $8 to $20 depending on the selected rewards, with delivery scheduled for September 2017, except for ROSbot that’s planned for mid-October 2017.\n\n[embedded content]\n\nTweet Husarion CORE2 is a board designed to make robotics projects simpler and faster to complete with pre-configured software and online management.

The good news is that the board is now finally available for $8.80 plus shipping on Aliexpress ($12.19 in total in my case)\n\nOrange Pi i96 specifications:\n\nSoC – RDA Micro 8810PL ARM Cortex A5 processor @ up to 1.0 GHz with 2Gbit (256 MB) on-chip LPDDR2 RAM, 4Gbit (512 MB) on-chip SLC NAND flash , 256KB L2 cache, and Vivante GC860 3D GPU\n\nExternal Storage – micro SD slot\n\nConnectivity – WiFi 802.11 b/g/n + Bluetooth 2.1/EDR module (RDA5991)\n\nCamera – MIPI CSI-2 connector for camera sensor up to 5MP\n\nVideo – 1080p30 H.264 encoding\n\nUSB – 1x USB host port, 1x micro USB OTG port\n\nExpansion – 40-pin GPIO header with SPI, I2C, GPIOs, etc…\n\nDebugging – 3x pin UART for serial console\n\nMisc – 8 selection jumpers, power button, power LED, boot selection header\n\nPower Supply – 5V via micro USB port; optional support for battery power\n\nDimensions – 60 x 30 mm as per 96Boards IoT Edition specification\n\nCertifications – CE and FCC based on the silkscreen\n\nThe hardware is a cost-down version of Orange Pi 2G-IoT board without 2G / GSM support, no display interface, no heaphone jack, and a smaller PCB (60×30 mm vs 68×42 mm). The company claims the board supports Android 4.4, Ubuntu, and Debian, and we already have Android SDK with Linux and u-boot source code. Note that the board is not listed on 96Boards IE page yet, and I’d like to remind readers that while 96Boards specifications target both hardware and software, many companies do not comply with the software part of the specifications, and having a 96Boards compliant board does not mean Linaro engineers themselves are working on it. RDA Micro 8810PL processor on development boards is also pretty new, so you can’t expect everything to mostly work out of the box, like you would on Allwinner H3 boards, and for example booting Linux from NAND (Android is OK), and controlling GPIOs may still be an issue at this stage.\n\nNevertheless, the price, features, and dimensions of this Linux board could make it an alternative to ESP32 boards such as Wemo LoLin32 for some IoT projects, especially where the RAM and storage might be tight. The board could also be interesting for connected camera applications.\n\nThanks to theguyuk for the tip.\n\nTweet Orange Pi i96 board was first unveiled at Linaro Connect US 2016 in September of that year, as one of the first boards compliant with 96Boards IoT Edition specification,…\n\n↧\n\nThe First Amlogic S912 Development Board is Coming Soon with Khadas VIM2\n\nWe have a decent choice of Amlogic S905 development boards like ODROID-C2 or NanoPi K2, but I was recently asked whether I knew of any Amlogic S912 development boards. I’m sure Amlogic has one for internal development, but those are hard to get, and probably expensive, and while you could probably get an S912 TV box board those lack I/Os, and software support may truly be a challenge. So I’m pleased to announce that Shenzhen Wesion will soon provide an update to their Khadas VIM Pro board with Khadas VIM2 powered by Amlogic S912 octa-core processor.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe company will actually offer three variants of Khadas VIM2 boards (Basic/Pro/Max) specifications with highlights in bold showing differences with Khadas VIM Pro board:\n\nSoC – Amlogic S912 octa core ARM Cortex-A53 @ up to 1.5 GHz with ARM Mali-820MP GPU\n\nSystem Memory\n\nBasic – 2 GB DDR4\n\nPro/Max – 3 GB DDR4\n\nStorage\n\nmicro SD card and 2MP SPI flash\n\neMMC Flash – Basic: 16GB; Pro: 32GB; Max: 64GB\n\nVideo & Audio Output – HDMI 2.0a up to 4K @ 60 Hz with CEC support\n\nConnectivity\n\nBasic – Gigabit Ethernet with WoL support, 802.11 b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.1 via Ampak AP6356S module\n\nPro/Max – Gigabit Ethernet with WoL support, 802.11 b/g/n/ac with RSDB and Bluetooth 4.2 via Ampak AP6359SA module\n\nUSB – 2x USB 2.0 host ports supporting 900mA and 500mA loads, 1x USB 2.0 type C port supporting power and data only\n\nExpansion header\n\n40-pin 2.54mm pitch header with USB, UART, I2C, ADC, PWM, I2S, SPDIF, and ISO7816\n\n10-pin FPC connector with I2C and IOs\n\n8 “pin” pogo pads array with USB, I2C, DVB bus, and I/Os\n\nMisc – Blue LED, white LED, dual channel IR, power/function/reset buttons, header for RTC battery, fan header\n\nPower Supply – 5V to 9V via USB type C, 4-pin VIN 1.25mm pitch header, or pogo pads for VIN (5V recommended for better efficiency); programmable current limit switch up to 4A (Set to 3A by default)\n\nDimensions – 82.0 x 57.5 x 11.5 mm (4x M2 mounting holes)\n\nWe can see that it’s not just a processor update with many new features added to the new boards. If like me, you’ve never heard about RSDB, it stands for Real Simultaneous Dual Band, and allows to use both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz at the same time, while for most dual band modules only one frequency can be used at a given time. That’s a clear advantage if you’re going to use the board as an access point.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe company will provide Android 7.1 Nougat and Ubuntu 16.04 or greater operating systems and SDKs for the board, and work on UEFI support is in progress. The board will be launched last that month, and for now, the only VIM2 specific documentation provided is Amlogic S912 datasheet, but you can be sure there will be a lot more on Khadas Docs page at launch, although I expect many of the instructions available for Khadas VIM (Pro) will still work on VIM2 board.\n\nYou’ll find more details on the announcement forum post, such as Linux hardware video decoding not working natively, i.e. without libhybris and Android libraries, and the board has been designed with micro servers in mind with features like WoL and SPI flash for network boot, as well as UEFI support.\n\nThanks to Geokon for the tip.\n\nTweet We have a decent choice of Amlogic S905 development boards like ODROID-C2 or NanoPi K2, but I was recently asked whether I knew of any Amlogic S912 development boards….\n\n↧\n\nHDFury Vertex is a High-End HDMI 2.0 Splitter, Scaler, and Diagnostic Tool\n\nMost people won’t need this, but if you are working on HDMI, HDFury Vertex HDMI 2.0b splitter and scaler could be a very useful product.
