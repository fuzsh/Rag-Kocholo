The, operating system which is the newest progeny of a diverse and storied lineage has been released in other form factors, such as wearable devices and cameras, but its release as handset operating system has been repeatedly delayed.\n\nWhile Tizen was initially scheduled to debut in 2012, the repeated delays sees Tizen entering a very different market place than initially expected. While Tizen was originally expected to debut on premium or \"flagship\" level hardware, the newly available Samsung Z1 is significantly more modest approach. The Z1 sells for the equivalent of 92 USD in India and its specifications are in line with that \"budget\" price point targeted by other phone such as those offered under the Android One program (105 USD).\n\n800×480 4.0\" LCD (233 ppi)\n\nOSTizen 2.3\n\nCPU1.2GHz dual-core Spreadtrum SC7727S (Cortex-A7)\n\nRAM768MB\n\nGPUMail 400\n\nStorage4GB internal, MicroSD card slot\n\nNetworking802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, FM Radio\n\nPortsMicro USB 2.0, headphones\n\nCamera3.15MP rear camera, 0.3MP front camera\n\nSize120.4mm x 63.2mm x 9.7mm\n\nWeight112g\n\nBatteryRemovable 1500 mAh\n\nSim CardDual SIM slots\n\nArstechnica published a lengthy review based on its experiences using Tizen on the Z1. Arstechnica's ultimate conclusion on the OS was that although K1 offers a functional smart phone at an affordable price \"Tizen doesn't offer any innovative ideas. It's just Android with worse design, no direction, no hardware support, and no apps.\"\n\nA recent [blog post][] from Samsung indicates that the chief value of Tizen from the company's perspective is its ability to run on relatively few system resources. As Samsung puts it:\n\nThe benefits of Tizen are very simple: Tizen is \"lighter\" than other operating systems. In other words, Tizen requires less processing power and memory, thereby ensuring faster device speeds while consuming less energy. As a result, consumers will benefit from a smoother user experience through the likes of shorter boot time, faster web browsing and seamless multitasking, all the while enjoying longer battery life.\n\nBecause it is lightweight, Tizen is optimal for use across a wide spectrum of smart connected devices in the IoT space. While devices with high demand for computing power, such as smartphones and TVs, are part of the IoT, so are devices that require relatively less computing power, such as wearables, vacuum cleaners and washing machines, which need an operating system like Tizen that is lightweight enough to run the devices without burning through processing power, memory and overall device performance.\n\nWhile the future of Tizen at Samsung or elsewhere is still quite uncertain it seems most likely that Tizen's application will be in powering the coming generation of smart appliances and accessories. First Ubuntu for Phone Handset Goes on Sale\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/mobiles/Worlds-first-Ubuntu-phone-set-to-go-on-sale/articleshow/46155946.cms http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/the-first-ubuntu-phone-will-finally-go-on-sale-next-week/ https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/02/06/bqs-new-aquaris-e4-5-ubuntu-edition-the-smartphone-that-puts-content-and-services-at-your-fingertips/ http://www.webupd8.org/2015/02/ubuntu-phone-review-bq-aquaris-e45.html http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/02/96735\n\nCanonical, the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution has also released its first commercial handset running its newly developed Ubuntu Phone operating system. Ubuntu partnered with Spanish manufacturer BQ to sell a special Ubuntu edition of BQ's typically Android 4.4 powered Aquaris E4.5. This special edition which runs the new operating system is being sold through a series of limited flash sales announced via Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.\n\nThe Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition sells for 192 USD and the limited supply is available exclusively in Europe.\n\nAquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition Specifications\n\nScreen540 x 960 4.5\" IPS\n\nCPUQuad Core Cortex A7 up to 1.3 GHz MediaTek\n\nGPUMali 400 up to 500 MHz\n\nRAM1 GB\n\nStorage8 GB internal, MicroSD card slot\n\nNetworkingWi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, FM Radio\n\nPortsMicro-USB, Headphones\n\nCamera8MP rear camera (Dual-flash and autofocus), 5Mpx front camera\n\nSize137 x 67 x 9 mm\n\nWeight123g\n\nBattery2150 mAh\n\nSim CardDual SIM slots\n\nAlthough the Aquaris E4.5 hardware is rather mundane, a version of the Meizu MX4 running Ubuntu Phone is also expected to introduce and higher-end ubuntu phone alternative within the coming weeks. The first round flash sale for the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition on February 11th received 12,000 orders per minute: Enough to crash BQ's servers.\n\nInitial reviews indicate that features, design and usability of the admittedly immature Ubuntu Phone operating system. Early feedback indicated a positive response to the operating system's edge-interactions based user experience and the \"Scopes\" feature. Scopes, according to Canonical, are ... a reinvention of the mobile UI, presenting a new way to rapidly and visually access the most important digital life services –- music, social, web, local services, photos etc -- directly on the home screen. The richness and unfragmented experience delivered by Ubuntu Scopes are a world away from burying content and services inside multiple apps in an icon grid –- reversing the industry’s hackneyed status quo.\n\nUbuntu Phone still lacks many of the features and broad support that the major mobile operating systems enjoy but it seems that its emphasis on user experience and low-barriers to entry may give it some advantage in gaining a small foothold in this competitive market. Samsung Faces Criticism Over Smart TV Privacy\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2015/2/8/8001687/samsungs-smart-tv-privacy-policy-george-orwell http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/08/telescreen/ https://twitter.com/xor/status/564356757007261696 http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-changes-smarttv-privacy-policy-in-wake-of-spying-fears/ http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/samsung-smart-tvs-inserting-ads-into-third-party-apps/ http://mashable.com/2015/02/11/samsung-tvs-insert-ads-into-movies/ http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/8017771/samsung-smart-tvs-inserting-unwanted-ads\n\nA pair of issues surrounding Samsung smart TVs flared up in the news in February. The first issues was the discovery that a Samsung Privacy Policy for its Smart TV services included the following language:\n\nSamsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\n\nSome commentators went so far to compare this policy with the infamous telescreen from George Orwell's 1984. Samsung has since revised this section of its privacy but some question whether Samsung has made a change to its data collection or merely restated the same policy using less objectionable language. The incident has raised discussions about important issues for connected devices such as data security, third-party data sharing and most importantly maintaining the trust of users.\n\nUnfortunately for Samsung, complaints about second aspect of its Smart TVs have also been in the February's news headlines. Specifically, customers allege that Samsung Smart TVs have been displaying unwanted pop-ads and, in some cases, displaying advertisements which interrupt playback of users' locally stored video content such as movies and TV. It is unclear whether these ads were displayed as a result of faulty software or were simply a poor design decision. The Verge expressed what is likely on the minds of many consumers at the moment:\n\nThe internet has given consumers more control than ever before over what TV they watch and when, and adding this connectivity to the biggest screen in the house certainly makes sense on paper. However, companies like Samsung and LG have proven time and time again that smart TVs aren't about giving more control to consumers — they're about taking it away; with obtrusive privacy policies, clunky software, and adverts, adverts, adverts. So much for the future: perhaps it's time to bring back the dumb TV."
