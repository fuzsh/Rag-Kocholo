        "text": "During the transition period, when GNOME Shell and Unity were pretty rough around the edges and slow to respond, 3rd party app launchers were a big deal. Overtime the newer desktop environments improved and became fast, reliable and predictable, reducing the need for a alternate app launchers.\n\nAs a result, many third-party app launchers have either slowed down development or simply seized to exist. Ulauncher seems to be the only one to have bucked the trend so far. Synpase and Kupfer on the other hand, though old and not as actively developed anymore, still pack a punch. Since Kupfer is too old school, we'll only be discussing Synapse and Ulauncher here.\n\nSynapse\n\nI still remember the excitement when I first reviewed Synapse more than 8 years ago. Back then, Synapse was something very unique to Linux and Ubuntu, and it still is in many ways. Though Synapse is not an active project that it used to be, the launcher still works great even in brand new Ubuntu 19.04.\n\nNo need to meddle with PPAs and DEBs, Synapse is available in Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nCLICK HERE to directly find and install Synapse from Ubuntu Software Center, or simply search 'Synapse' in USC. Launch the app afterwards. Once launched, you can trigger Synapse with Ctrl+Space keyboard shortcut.\n\nUlauncher\n\nThe new kid in the block apparently. But new doesn't mean it is lacking in any way. What makes Ulauncher quite unique are its extensions. And there is plenty to choose from.\n\nFrom an extension that lets you control your Spotify desktop app, to generic unit converters or simply timers, Ulauncher extesions has got you covered.\n\nLet's install the app first. Download the DEB file for Debian/Ubuntu users and double-click the downloaded file to install it. To complete the installation via Terminal instead, do this:\n\nOR\n\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/ulauncher_4.3.2.r8_all.deb\n\nChange filename/location if they are different in your case. And if the command reports dependency errors, make a force install using the command below.\n\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nDone. Post install, launch the app from your app-list and you're good to go. Once started, Ulauncher will sit in your system tray by default. And just like Synapse, Ctrl+Space will trigger Ulauncher.\n\nInstalling extensions in Ulauncher is pretty straight forward too.\n\nFind the extensions you want from Ulauncher Extensions page. Trigger a Ulauncher instance with Ctrl+Space and go to Settings > Extensions > Add extension. Provide the URL from the extension page and let the app do the rest.\n\nSnap apps are a godsend. ElectronPlayer is an Electron based app available on Snapstore that doubles up as a standalone media player for video streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, Floatplane etc.\n\nAnd it works great on Ubuntu 19.04 \"disco dingo\". From what we've tested, Netflix works like a charm, so does YouTube. ElectronPlayer also has a picture-in-picture mode that let it run above desktop and full screen applications.\n\nFor me, this is great because I can free-up tabs on my Firefox window which are almost never clutter-free.\n\nDownload ElectronPlayer from Snapstore.\n\nOR\n\nUse the command below to install ElectronPlayer directly from Snapstore. Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t) and copy:\n\nsudo snap install electronplayer\n\nPress ENTER and give password when asked.\n\nAfter the process is complete, search for ElectronPlayer in you App list. Sign in to your favorite video streaming services and you are good to go. Let us know your feedback in the comments.\n\nAs most of you should know already, Ubuntu 19.04 \"disco dingo\" has been released. A lot of things have changed, see our comprehensive list of improvements in Ubuntu 19.04. Though it is not really necessary to make the jump, I'm sure many here would prefer to have the latest and greatest from Ubuntu. Here's how you upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 from Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nUpgrading to Ubuntu 19.04 from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is tricky. There is no way you can make the jump from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS directly to Ubuntu 19.04. For that, you need to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.10 first. Pretty disappointing, I know. But when upgrading an entire OS, you can't be too careful.\n\nAnd the process itself is not as tedious or time consuming à la Windows. And also unlike Windows, the upgrades are not forced upon you while you're in middle of something.\n\nIf you wonder how the dock in the above screenshot rest at the bottom of Ubuntu desktop, it's called dash-to-dock GNOME Shell extension. That and more Ubuntu 19.04 tips and tricks here.\n\nUpgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 from Ubuntu 18.10\n\nDisclaimer: PLEASE backup your critical data before starting the upgrade process.\n\nLet's start with the assumption that you're on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nRead our step-by-step guide to upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to Ubuntu 18.10\n\nAfter running the upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS from Ubuntu 18.10, the prompt will ask for a full system reboot. Please do that, and make sure everything is running smoothly afterwards. Now you have clean new Ubuntu 18.10 up and running. Let's begin the Ubuntu 19.04 upgrade process.\n\nMake sure your laptop is plugged-in, this is going to take time. Stable Internet connection is a must too.\n\nRun your Software Updater app, and install all the updates available.\n\nPost the update, you should be prompted with an \"Ubuntu 19.04 is available\" window. It will guide you through the required steps without much hassle.\n\nIf not, fire up Software & Updates app and check for updates.\n\nIf both these didn't work in your case, there's always the commandline option to make the force upgarde. Open Terminal app (keyboard shortcut: CTRL+ALT+T), and run the command below.\n\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nType the password when prompted. Don't let the simplicity of the command fool you, this is just the start of a long and complicated process. do-release command will check for available upgrades and then give you an estimated time and bandwidth required to complete the process.\n\nRead the instructions carefully and proceed. The process only takes about an hour or less for me. It entirely depends on your internet speed and system resources.\n\nSo, how did it go? Was the upgrade process smooth as it should be? And what do you think about new Ubuntu 19.04 \"disco dingo\"? Let us know in the comments.\n\nUbuntu 19.04, codenamed \"Disco Dingo\", has been released (and upgrading is easier than you think). I've been on Ubuntu 19.04 since its first Alpha, and this has been a rock solid release as far I'm concerned. Changes in Ubuntu 19.04 are more evolutionary though, but availability of the latest Linux Kernel version 5.0 is significant.\n\nUnity is long gone and Ubuntu 19.04 is indistinguishably GNOME 3.x now, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Yes, I know, there are many who still swear by the simplicity of Unity desktop. But I'm an outlier here, I liked both Unity and GNOME 3.x even in their very early avatars. When I wrote this review of GNOME Shell desktop almost 8 years ago, I knew it was destined for greatness. Ubuntu 19.04 \"Disco Dingo\" runs GNOME 3.32.0.\n\nWe'll discuss more about GNOME 3.x and Ubuntu 19.04 in the official review. Let's get down to brass tacks. A step-by-step guide into things I did after installing Ubuntu 19.04 \"Disco Dingo\".\n\n1. Make sure your system is up-to-date\n\nDo a full system update. Fire up your Software Updater and check for updates.\n\nOR\n\nvia Terminal, this is my preferred way to update Ubuntu. Just one command.\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade\n\nEnter password when prompted and let the system do the rest.\n\n2. Install GNOME Tweaks\n\nGNOME Tweaks is non-negotiable.\n\nGNOME Tweaks is an app the lets you tweak little things in GNOME based OSes that are otherwise hidden behind menus. If you are on Ubuntu 19.04, Tweaks is a must. Honestly, I don't remember if it was installed as a default. But here you install it anyway, Apt-URL will prompt you if the app already exists.\n\nSearch for Gnome Tweaks in Ubuntu Software Center. OR simply CLICK HERE to go straight to the app in Software Center. OR even better, copy-paste this command in Terminal (keyboard shortcut: CTRL+ALT+T).\n\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\n\n3. Enable MP3/MP4/AVI Playback, Adobe Flash etc.\n\nYou do have an option to install most of the 'restricted-extras' while installing the OS itself now, but if you are not-sure you've ticked all the right boxes, just run the following command in Terminal.\n\nsudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nOR\n\nYou can install it straight from the Ubuntu Software Center by CLICKING HERE.\n\n4. Display Date/Battery Percentage on Top Panel\n\nThe screenshot, I hope, is self explanatory.\n\nIf you have GNOME Tweaks installed, this is easily done. Open GNOME tweaks, goto 'Top Bar' sidemenu and enable/disable what you need.\n\n5. Enable 'Click to Minimize' on Ubuntu Dock\n\nHonestly, I don't have a clue why this is disabled by default. You intuitively expect the apps shortcuts on Ubuntu dock to 'minimize' when you click on it (at least I do).\n\nIn fact, the feature is already there, all you need to do is to switch it ON. Do this is Terminal.\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action 'minimize'\n\nThat's it. Now if you didn't find the 'click to minimize' feature useful, you can always revert Dock settings back to its original state, by copy-pasting the following command in Terminal app.\n\ngsettings reset org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action\n\n6. Pin/Unpin Apps from Launcher\n\nThere are a bunch of apps that are pinned to your Ubuntu launcher by default.\n\nFor example, I almost never use the 'Help' app or the 'Amazon' shortcut preloaded on launcher. But I would prefer a shortcut to Terminal app instead. Right-click on your preferred app on the launcher, and add-to/remove-from favorites as you please.\n\n7. Enable GNOME Shell Exetensions Support\n\nExtensions are an integral part of GNOME desktop.\n\nIt's a real shame that one has to go through all these for such a basic yet important feature. From the default Firefox browser, when you visit GNOME Extensions page, you will notice the warning message on top describing the unavailability of Extensions support.\n\nIf you are on Firefox, Install GNOME Shell integration Add-on.\n\nFor Google Chrome/Chromium users, Install GNOME Shell integration plugin.\n\nNow for the second part, you need to install the host connector on Ubuntu.\n\nDownload and Install Chrome GNOME Shell from Software Center\n\nOR you can do the same via Terminal. Just copy-paste this command to Terminal.\n\nsudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell\n\nDone. Don't mind the \"chrome\" in 'chrome-gnome-shell', it works with all major browsers, provided you've the correct browser add-on installed.\n\nYou can now visit GNOME Extensions page and install extensions as you wish with ease. (if it didn't work immediately, a system restart will clear things up).\n\nExtensions are such an integral part of GNOME Desktop experience, can't understand why this is not a system default in Ubuntu 19.04. Hope future releases of Ubuntu will have this figured out.\n\n8. My Favourite 5 GNOME Shell Extensions for Ubuntu 19.04\n\nOpenWeather: Weather information.\n\nDash to Dock: Transforms the default launcher into a configurable dock.\n\nPlaces Status Indicator: Adds a menu on your top panel for quickly navigating places.\n\nStatus Area Horizontal Spacing: Correct the uneven spacing between icons on top-right panel area.\n\nExtensions: Enable/disable gnome shell extensions from a menu in the top panel. A must-have.\n\n9. Remove Trash Icon from Desktop\n\nAnnoyed by the permanent presence of Home and Trash icons in the desktop? You are not alone. Luckily, there's an extension for that!\n\nDesktop Icons: lets you add/remove icons from desktop.\n\nDone. Now, access the settings and enable/disable icons as you please.\n\nExtension settings can be accessed directly from the extension home page (notice the small wrench icon near the ON/OFF toggle). OR you can use the Extensions addon like in the screenshot above.\n\n10. Enable/Disable Two Finger Scrolling\n\nAs you must've noticed, two-finger scrolling is a system default for sometime now.\n\nOne of my laptops act strangely when two-finger scrolling is on. You can easily disable two-finger scrolling and enable old school edge-scrolling in 'Settings'. Settings > Mouse and Touchpad\n\nQuicktip: You can go straight to submenus by simply searching for it in GNOME's universal search bar.\n\nTake for example the screenshot above, where I triggered the GNOME menu by hitting Super(Windows) key, and simply searched for 'mouse' settings. The first result will take me directly to the 'Settings' submenu for 'Mouse and Touchpad' that we saw earlier. Easy right? More examples will follow.\n\n11. Nightlight Mode ON\n\nWhen you're glued to your laptop/PC screen for a large amount of time everyday, it is advisable that you enable the automatic nightlight mode for the sake of your eyes. Be it the laptop or my phone, this has become an essential feature. The sight of a LED display without nightlight ON during lowlight conditions immediately gives me a headache these days. Easily one of my favourite in-built features on GNOME.\n\nSettings > Devices > Display > Night Light ON/OFF\n\nOR as before, Hit superkey > search for 'night light'. It will take you straight to the submenu under Devices > Display. Guess you wouldn't need anymore examples on that.\n\n12. Privacy on Ubuntu 19.04\n\nGuess I don't need to lecture you on the importance of privacy in the post-PRISM era.\n\nUbuntu remembers your usage & history to recommend you frequently used apps and such. And this is never shared over the network. But if you're not comfortable with this, you can always disable and delete your usage history on Ubuntu. Settings > Privacy > Usage & History\n\n13. Perhaps a New Look & Feel?\n\nAs you might have noticed, I'm not using the default Ubuntu theme here.\n\nRight now I'm using System 76's Pop OS GTK theme and icon sets. They look pretty neat I think. Just three commands to install it in your Ubuntu 19.04.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76/pop sudo apt-get update sudo apt install pop-icon-theme pop-gtk-theme pop-gnome-shell-theme sudo apt install pop-wallpapers\n\nExecute last command if you want Pop OS wallpapers as well. To enable the newly installed theme and icon sets, launch GNOME Tweaks > Appearance (see screenshot). I will be making separate posts on themes, icon sets and GNOME shell extensions. So stay subscribed.\n\n14. Disable Error Reporting\n\nIf you find the \"application closed unexpectedly\" popups annoying, and would like to disable error reporting altogether, this is what you need to do.\n\nSettings > Privacy > Problem Reporting and switch it off.\n\n15. Liberate vertical space on Firefox by disabling Title Bar\n\nThis is not an Ubuntu specific tweak.\n\nFirefox > Settings > Customize. Notice the \"Title Bar\" at the bottom left? Untick to disable.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nA \"Disco Dingo\" themed wallpaper was already there. But the latest update bring a bunch of new wallpapers as system defaults on Ubuntu 19.04.\n\nPretty right? Here's the older one for comparison.\n\nThe newer wallpaper is definitely cleaner, more professional looking with better colors. I won't bother tinkering with wallpapers anymore, the new default on Ubuntu 19.04 is just perfect.\n\nToo funky for my taste. But I'm sure there will be many who will prefer this darker, edgier, wallpaper over the others. As we said earlier, the new \"disco dingo\" mascot calls for infinite wallpaper variations.\n\nApart from theme and artwork updates, Ubuntu 19.04 has the latest Linux Kernel version 5.0 (5.0.0.8 to be precise). You can read more about Ubuntu 19.04 features and updates here.\n\nUbuntu 19.04 hit beta a few days ago. Though it is a pretty stable release already for a beta, I'd recommend to wait for another 15 days or so until the final release. If all you care are the wallpapers, you can download the new Ubuntu 19.04 wallpapers here. It's a DEB file, just do a double click post download.\n\nUEFI has a pretty bad reputation among many in the Linux community. UEFI unnecessarily complicated Linux installation and distro-hopping in Windows pre-installed machines, for example. Linux Boot project by Linux Foundation aims to replace some firmware functionality like the UEFI DXE phase with Linux components.\n\nWhat is UEFI?\n\nUEFI is a standard or a specification that replaced legacy BIOS firmware, which was the industry standard for decades. Essentially, UEFI defines the software components between operating system and platform firmware.\n\nUEFI boot has three phases: SEC, PEI and DXE. Driver eXecution Environment or DXE Phase in short: this is where UEFI system loads drivers for configured devices. LinuxBoot will replaces specific firmware functionality like the UEFI DXE phase with a Linux kernel and runtime.\n\nLinuxBoot and the Future of System Startup\n\n\"Firmware has always had a simple purpose: to boot the OS. Achieving that has become much more difficult due to increasing complexity of both hardware and deployment. Firmware often must set up many components in the system, interface with more varieties of boot media, including high-speed storage and networking interfaces, and support advanced protocols and security features.\" writes Linux Foundation.\n\nLinuxBoot will replace this slow and often error-prone code with a Linux Kernel. This alone should significantly improve system startup performance.\n\nOn top of that, LinuxBoot intends to achieve increased boot reliability and boot-time performance by removing unnecessary code and by using reliable Linux drivers instead of lightly tested firmware drivers. LinuxBoot claims that these improvements could potentially help make the system startup process as much as 20 times faster.\n\nIn fact, this \"Linux to boot Linux\" technique has been fairly common place in supercomputers, consumer electronics, and military applications, for decades. LinuxBoot looks to take this proven technique and improve on it so that it can be deployed and used more widely by individual users and companies.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nLinuxBoot is not as obscure or far-fetched as, say, lowRISC (open-source, Linux capable, SoC) or even OpenPilot. At FOSDEM 2019 summit, Facebook engineers revealed that their company is actively integrating and finetuning LinuxBoot to their needs for freeing hardware down to the lowest levels.\n\nFacebook and Google are deeply involved in LinuxBoot project. Being large data companies, where even small improvements in system startup speed and reliability can bring major advantages, their involvement is not a surprise. To put this in perspective, a large data center run by Google or Facebook can have tens of thousands of servers. Other companies involved include Horizon Computing, Two Sigma and 9elements Cyber Security.\n\nThe worldwide phenomenon that is Uber needs no introduction. Uber is an immensely popular ride sharing, ride hailing, company that is valued in billions. Uber is so disruptive and controversial that many cities and even countries are putting up barriers to protect the interests of local taxi drivers.\n\nEnough about Uber as a company. To those among you who regularly use Uber app for booking a cab, Uber CLI could be a useful companion.\n\nUber CLI can be a great tool for the easily distracted. This unique command line application allows you to look up Uber cab's time and price estimates without ever taking your eyes off the laptop screen.\n\nInstall Uber-CLI using NPM\n\nYou need to have NPM first to install Uber-CLI on Ubuntu. npm, short for Node.js package manager, is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. npm has a command line based client and its own repository of packages.\n\nThis is how to install npm on Ubuntu 19.04, and Ubuntu 18.10. And thereafter, using npm, install Uber-CLI. Fire up the Terminal and run the following.\n\nsudo apt update sudo apt install nodejs npm npm install uber-cli -g\n\nAnd you're done. Uber CLI is a command line based application, here are a few examples of how it works in Terminal. Also, since Uber is not available where I live, I couldn't vouch for its accuracy.\n\nUber-CLI has just two use cases.\n\nuber time 'pickup address here'\n\nuber price -s 'start address' -e 'end address'\n\nEasy right? I did some testing with places and addresses I'm familiar with, where Uber cabs are fairly common. And I found the results to be fairly accurate. Do test and leave feedback. Uber CLI github page for more info.\n\nEven as someone who bought into the Ubuntu Touch hype very early, I was not expecting much from UBports to be honest. But to my pleasent surprise, UBports Installer turned my 4 year old BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition hardware into a slick, clean, and usable phone again.\n\nUBports Installer and Ubuntu Touch\n\nAs many of you know already, Ubuntu Touch was Canonical's failed attempt to deliver a competent mobile operating system based on its desktop version. The first Ubuntu Touch installed smartphone was released in 2015 by BQ, a Spanish smartphone manufacturer. And in April 2016, the world's first Ubuntu Touch based tablet, the BQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition, was released.\n\nThough initial response was quite promising, Ubuntu Touch failed to make a significant enough splash in the smartphone space. In fact, Ubuntu Touch was not alone, many other mobile OS projects like Firefox OS or even Samsung owned Tizen OS for that matter failed to capture a sizable market-share from Android/iOS duopoly.\n\nTo the disappointment of Ubuntu enthusiasts, Mark Shuttleworth announced the termination of Ubuntu Touch development in April, 2017.\n\nRise of UBports and revival of Ubuntu Touch Project\n\nFor all its inadequacies, Ubuntu Touch was one unique OS. It looked and felt different from most other mobile operating systems. And Ubuntu Touch enthusiasts was not ready to give up on it so easily. Enter UBports.\n\nUBports turned Ubuntu Touch into a community-driven project. Passionate people from around the world now contribute to the development of Ubuntu Touch. In August 2018, UBPorts released its OTA-4, upgrading the Ubuntu Touch's base from the Canonical's starting Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) to the nearest, current long-term support version Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\nThey actively test the OS on a number of legacy smartphone hardware and help people install Ubuntu Touch on their smartphones using an incredibly capable, cross-platform, installer.\n\nUbuntu Touch Installer on Ubuntu 19.04\n\nThough I knew about UBports project before, I was never motivated enough to try the new OS on my Aquaris E4.5, until yesterday. By sheer stroke of luck, I stumbled upon UBports Installer in Ubuntu Software Center. I was curious to find out if it really worked as it claimed on the page.\n\nI fired up the app on my Ubuntu 19.04 and plugged in my Aquaris E4.5. Voila! the installer detected my phone in a jiffy. Since there wasn't much data on my BQ, I proceeded with Ubuntu Touch installation.\n\nThe instructions were pretty straight forward and it took probably 15 minutes to download, restart, and install, 16.04 LTS based Ubuntu Touch on my 4 year old hardware.\n\nIn my experience, even flashing an Android was never this easy! My Ubuntu phone is usable again without all the unnecessary bloat that made it clunky. This post is a tribute to the UBports community for the amazing work they've been doing with Ubuntu Touch. Here's also a list of smartphone hardware that can run Ubuntu Touch.\n\nWe've featured cool-retro-term before. It is a wonderful little terminal emulator app on Ubuntu (and Linux) that adorns this cool retro look of the old CRT displays.\n\nLet the pictures speak for themselves.\n\nPretty cool right? Not only does it look cool, it functions just like a normal Terminal app. You don't lose out on any features normally associated with a regular Terminal emulator. cool-retro-term comes with a bunch of themes and customisations that takes its retro cool appeal a few notches higher.\n\nEnough now, let's find out how you install this retro looking Terminal emulator on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 18.10. Fire up your Terminal app, and run these commands one after the other.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vantuz/cool-retro-term sudo apt update sudo apt install cool-retro-term\n\nDone. The above PPA supports Ubuntu Artful, Bionic and Cosmic releases (Ubuntu 17.10, 18.04 LTS, 18.10). cool-retro-term is now installed and ready to go.\n\nSince I don't have Artful or Bionic installations in any of my computers, I couldn't test the PPA on those releases. Do let me know if you faced any issues while installing the app.\n\nAnd as some of you might have noticed, I'm running cool-retro-term from an AppImage. This is because I'm on Ubuntu 19.04 \"disco dingo\", and obviously the app doesn't support an unreleased OS (well, duh!).\n\nThis is how it looks on fullscreen mode. If you are a non-Ubuntu user, you can find various download options here. If you are on Fedora or distros based on it, cool-retro-term is available in the official repositories.\n\nUnless you live under a rock, you must've been inundated with nonstop news about Google's high-octane launch ceremony yesterday where they unveiled the much hyped game streaming platform called Stadia.\n\nStadia, or Project Stream as it was earlier called, is a cloud gaming service where the games themselves are hosted on Google's servers, while the visual feedback from the game is streamed to the player's device through Google Chrome. If this technology catches on, and if it works just as good as showed in the demos, Stadia could be what the future of gaming might look like.\n\nStadia, Powered by Linux\n\nIt is a fairly common knowledge that Google data centers use Linux rather extensively. So it is not really surprising that Google would use Linux to power its cloud based Stadia gaming service.\n\nStadia's architecture is built on Google data center network which has extensive presence across the planet. With Google Stadia, Google is offering a virtual platform where processing resources can be scaled up to match your gaming needs without the end user ever spending a dime more on hardware.\n\nAnd since Google data centers mostly runs on Linux, the games on Stadia will run on Linux too, through the Vulkan API. This is great news for gaming on Linux. Even if Stadia doesn't directly result in more games on Linux, it could potentially make gaming a platform agnostic cloud based service, like Netflix.\n\nWith Stadia, \"the data center is your platform,\" claims Majd Bakar, head of engineering at Stadia. Stadia is not constrained by limitations of traditional console systems, he adds. Stadia is a \"truly flexible, scalable, and modern platform\" that takes into account the future requirements of the gaming ecosystem. When launched later this year, Stadia will be able to stream at 4K HDR and 60fps with surround sound.\n\nWatch the full presentation here. Tell us what you think about Stadia in the comments.\n\nUbuntu 19.04 is scheduled to arrive in another 30 days has been released. I've been using it for the past week or so, and even as a pre-beta, the OS is pretty stable and not buggy at all. Here are a bunch of things you should know about the yet to be officially released Ubuntu 19.04.\n\n1. Codename: \"Disco Dingo\"\n\nHow about that! As most of you know already, Canonical names its semiannual Ubuntu releases using an adjective and an animal with the same first letter (Intrepid Ibex, Feisty Fawn, or Maverick Meerkat, for example, were some of my favourites). And the upcoming Ubuntu 19.04 is codenamed \"Disco Dingo\", has to be one of the coolest codenames ever for an OS.\n\n2. Ubuntu 19.04 Theme Updates\n\nA new cleaner, crisper looking Ubuntu is coming your way. Can you notice the subtle changes to the default Ubuntu theme in screenshot below? Like the new deep-black top panel and launcher? Very tastefully done.\n\nTo be sure, this is now looking more and more like vanilla GNOME and less like Unity, which is not a bad thing.\n\nThere are changes to the icons too. That hideous blue Trash icon is gone. Others include a new Update Manager icon, Ubuntu Software Center icon and Settings Icon.\n\n3. Ubuntu 19.04 Official Mascot\n\nGIFs speaks louder that words. Meet the official \"Disco Dingo\" mascot.\n\nPretty awesome, right? \"Disco Dingo\" mascot calls for infinite wallpaper variations.\n\n4. The New Default Wallpaper\n\nThe new \"Disco Dingo\" themed wallpaper is so sweet: very Ubuntu-ish yet unique. A gray scale version of the same wallpaper is a system default too.\n\nUPDATE: There's a entire suit of newer and better wallpapers on Ubuntu 19.04!\n\n5. Linux Kernel 5.0 Support\n\nUbuntu 19.04 \"Disco Dingo\" will officially support the recently released Linux Kernel version 5.0. Among other things, Linux Kernel 5.0 comes with AMD FreeSync display support which is awesome news to users of high-end AMD Radeon graphics cards.\n\nAlso important to note is the added support for Adiantum Data Encryption and Raspberry Pi touchscreens. Apart from that, Kernel 5.0 has regular CPU performance improvements and improved hardware support.\n\n6. Livepatch is ON\n\nUbuntu 19.04's 'Software and Updates' app has a new default tab called Livepatch. This new feature should ideally help you to apply critical kernel patches without rebooting.\n\nLivepatch may not mean much to a normal user who regularly powerdowns his or her computer, but can be very useful for enterprise users where any downtime is simply not acceptable.\n\nCanonical introduced this feature in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but was later removed when Ubuntu 18.10 was released. The Livepatch feature is disabled on my Ubuntu 19.04 installation though, with a \"Livepatch is not available for this system\" warning. Not exactly sure what that means. Will update.\n\n7. Ubuntu 19.04 Release Schedule\n\nThe beta freeze is scheduled to happen on March 28th and final release on April 18th.\n\nNormally, post the beta release, it is a safe to install Ubuntu 19.04 for normal everyday use in my opinion, but ONLY if you are inclined to give it a spin before everyone else of course. I'd never recommend a pre-release OS on production machines. Ubuntu 19.04 Daily Build Download.\n\nMy biggest disappointment though is the supposed Ubuntu Software Center revamp which is now confirmed to not make it to this release. Subscribe us on Twitter and Facebook for more Ubuntu 19.04 release updates.\n\nRecommended read: Top things to do after installing Ubuntu 19.04"
