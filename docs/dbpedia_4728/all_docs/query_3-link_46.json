H e's back! Fear not programmers. Our Python series (and Greg) has returned. As ever the LibreOffice series continues, and to complete the trinity we have a piece on LaTeX. For those of you who like the idea of Dropbox, but don't trust it (for whatever reason) we have an article on Syncthing. It looks quite like BitTorrent Sync which I wrote about a while back. Last month the big news was, of course, the Ubuntu Phone. Unfortunately, those of you who purchased one of said phones had to wait almost six weeks for it. While I applaud Canonical and BQ for bringing an Ubuntu phone to the market having a flash sale but only saying at the end of the sale that the buyer has to wait almost a month for the unit is not the done thing. If the stock wasn't there then BQ should say so up front before the buyer can even hit a 'buy' button. I hope that by the time you read this you'll have your phone. If you do have it, send me an email telling me what you think about it. I'm keen to hear what other folks have to say about it. If you want my thoughts on it, head over and read my review of it. Kevin O'Brien returns this month to give us an intro, and the basics, on SSH. While it's not something I've used, I know many of you are fans of SSH.

Maarten Ectors, vice president of connected devices for Canonical, says the challenge with IoT these days is that rather than being an actual platform for developing applications, the IoT as developers see it as more akin to the Internet of isolated things. To address that issue, Canonical has created Ubuntu Core, an implementation of Linux for embedded systems that makes it possible not only to run multiple IoT applications on the same device, but also to continuously update them. As part of that effort, both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft have agreed to publish their cloud APIs on Ubuntu Core. Ectors says Canonical is trying to extend the presence that Ubuntu has into the cloud out to IoT devices. About 70% of the servers running inside the AWS cloud, for example, are running Ubuntu Linux, says Ectors. In addition, 62% of the implementations of the open source OpenStack cloud management framework are running on Ubuntu Linux, he adds.

First, full disclosure: I'm an advocate of open source software, so I've seen proof that a community of shared ideas and projects that can be modified, improved, and distributed freely can be a better way to develop technology. Being able to see the code, learn from it, ask questions, and offer improvements is the open source way. While it might seem counterintuitive, open does not mean less secure. In fact, the opposite is often true. Because the development process is collaborative, bugs, flaws, and vulnerabilities can be found sooner, and more often, and fixed more quickly. By granting access to the code, more people can work to solve issues. It's been said about open source that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\" More eyes and greater transparency can lead to fewer vulnerabilities and greater security.

If the Raspberry Pi is connected to a monitor or TV and is running a graphical desktop, the connected user can see exactly what a user sitting in front of the Pi would see - to support generic remote access and also good for sharing a screen with a friend, for instance.

Years went by and the Software Freedom Conservancy, a non-profit organization that promotes open- source software, claims to have negotiated with VMware for the company to release ESX's code, and its successor ESXi. That way, argued the Software Freedom Conservancy, these programs would legally comply with Linux's Gnu General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). VMware refused in 2014. Now, Hellweg and the Software Freedom Conservancy are sueing VMware in the district court of Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany. The group explains that they see this as a \"regretful but necessary next step in both Hellwig and Conservancy's ongoing effort to convince VMware to comply properly with the terms of the GPLv2, the license of Linux and many other Open Source and Free Software included in VMware's ESXi products.\" What's surprising about VMware's stubbornness is that there's never been much question that VMware had used Linux in ESX and ESXi. As Hellwig wrote in 2007, \"VMware uses a badly hacked 2.4 kernel with a big binary blob hooked into it, giving a derived work of the Linux kernel that's not legally redistributable.\" Source: http://www.zdnet.com/article/vm ware-sued-for-failure-to-complv- with-linuxs-license/ Submitted by: Arnfried Walbrecht management tool a key part of Ubuntu Linux. On Monday, March 9, the Ubuntu maintainers will reconfigure code base for the forthcoming version of the OS so that it uses the much-debated systemd suite of tools to handle core initialization tasks and manage system daemons. That means that when Ubuntu 1 5.04 ships (presumably in April), all new Ubuntu installs will be running systemd by default. It's a move that's sure to annoy some. When the Debian Project announced that it was switching to systemd last year, it sparked an angry protest by old-school admins who wanted Debian to stick with the familiar Unix System V-style init software to handle its startup and management chores. style init; it uses an alternative called upstart. But that won't prevent a few grumbles from those who'd rather just leave things as they are - to say nothing of those who just plain don't want systemd.

This makes it more controversial than projects like Linux Mint's Cinnamon desktop, which takes modern code and try to make it behave more like a traditional desktop, instead of bringing the old GNOME 2 code forward. GNOME 3 now also offers a Classic Mode to appeal to users who want a more traditional desktop experience. But never mind the competitors, and never mind which project will have the easiest time coping with new technology in the future. The MATE desktop works well today. If you don't want to play with new stuff, if you're comfortable with GNOME 2, or if modern desktops just seem too unwieldy, it's a great option. This is a core strength of Linux: When users don't like desktop changes, they can bring the old desktop forward. Windows users are stuck with however Microsoft wants the desktop to work this year.

Over the years, there has been one conflict after another in the heart of the the Linux development community, the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML). Now, in order to make the LKML more peaceful, the group has adopted a Code of Conduct. There's no question that Linux is the most successful operating system and open-system project. But it's also true that if you watch it closely, you'll see a lot of conflict within the community. In particular, Linus Torvalds, Linux's founder, doesn't suffer fools gladly, and he's never afraid to let other developers know when he thinks they're wrong. full circle magazine #95 4 There's nothing new about this, but recently, Lennart Poettering, a Red Hat engineer and one of the creators of the controversial systemd system and service replacement for Unix and Linux's sysvinit daemon, called out Torvalds publicly.

And it is true, simultaneously, that many organizations rely on the flexibility and security that Linux workstations offer over commercial solutions such as Microsoft Windows. It is, therefore, a good news for companies, that VMWare, the world-famous virtualization solution, is bringing its latest offering, Horizon 6, to Linux. According to a recent official announcement, VMWare will soon be porting Horizon 6 (released around a year ago) to official Linux repositories. Although advanced users choose SSH (Secure Shell) for remotely working on their machines over networks, newcomers to Linux, especially in the corporate sector, will find this move incredibly effective. This is partly due to the ease of use that VMWare offers, in the form of GUI solutions over conventional, CLI- based approaches in Linux, which often baffles new users. Already, VMWare has released a test version of its virtualization suite, that is available to install and test on Redhat and Ubuntu based servers.

Most users, who chose Linux over Windows or Mac as their primary workstations, relied on secondary OSes or platforms for satisfying their gaming needs. Of course, Linux has prestigious and open-source titles, including Warzone2100 and Battle for Wesnoth; but PCs dominated the market when it came to games. Thankfully, now those days are history. Steam for Linux has recently crosses the '1,000 games' mark, offering more than 2,000 items in total (including demos, videos, etc). Although the number is still less than that offered to Windows and Mac users (4,814 and 1,613 respectively), this can be easily seen, and regarded, as a major milestone in the history of Linux. Quality differences between the same games, when run on Direct3D and OpenGL in Windows and Linux OSes respectively, were quite notable at the beginning. But slowly, that is starting to minimize, as more developers devote time to make games specifically targeting the Linux users, rather than simply porting existing titles to the platform. Things are going to improve, even more, once the developers turn to Steam's next- generation Vulcan API.

This involves activity among larger companies and numerous start-ups in developing platforms. The good news is that many of these platforms are using some common standards, noted Ian Skerrett, vice president of marketing and ecosystem at the Eclipse Foundation. Technology wars are predictable. Every new wave of gadgetry brings a fight over who will be the next king of the software hill. The next big battle is brewing over control of the Internet of Things marketplace. The IoT is quietly gaining momentum as companies develop software to connect all sorts of consumer products to the Internet. Consumers see only convenience and extensions to their always-on mobile devices. Product makers see a pathway to streaming data that can be monetized from buyers' connections. Could history be ripe for repeating itself as open source begins to take on the current, yet unsustainable, walled-garden core of the IoT? Based on the victories in some early skirmishes, innovations developed by open source start-ups may be the David in the here-again fight against proprietary Goliaths.

And it is this trait of his above all else that has spawned the wonderful world of free and open source software, a world that was barely hinted at when he wrote the first document about his intentions. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools, a venerable technology publication that shut shop in December last year after 38 years of publishing. But Stallman's manifesto remains. It encapsulated a desire to create a free operating system, for use by all, one that the users could control. This desire grew out of the fact that UNIX source code was not being released after A. T. & T. was broken up and the the anti- trust decree under which it was operating became void. Stallman was not inspired by the path proprietary software development was taking. He was working at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT when he wrote the manifesto. \"GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it. Several other volunteers are helping me.

AngularJS, which is all client-side, and Meteor - which can be both client-side and server-side. After all this focus on content management systems, I felt it was necessary to mention a few smaller tools which can help add features to static web pages, without having to use a CMS, or creating massive amounts of custom code. NodeJS is a framework that acts both as a server, as well as a web application in general. This means many things are possible in both systems, but NodeJS won't integrate into a normal static HTML page. As AngularJS is included into a web page in the normal fashion (with a <script> tag), it can be added into any web project. Where can I start LEARNING ANGULARJS? What is AngularJS? AngularJS is a framework designed to make the creation of client-side web applications easier. It integrates into HTML by adding to its syntax. It allows things such as replacing content without reloading a page, simplifying testing, and offering optimizations to how JavaScript is loaded. What is the difference between AngularJS and SOMETHING LIKE NODEJS? AngularJS is included in Code School's list of courses. For anyone who doesn't know Code School - it's a website that offers videos and exercises for learning programming languages. As everything is done in the browser in real-time (including the programming exercises), you're able to easily check your work, or re-watch sections of the videos to better understand concepts. The AngularJS course is free, and an excellent introduction. For those of you who learn best by doing, you can follow along with the AngularJS & Meteor videos in a text editor, and then simply answer the exercises once you reach that stage. Why mention Meteor then? Meteor is an open source system for creating web and apps in pure JavaScript, and offers libraries to make designing the application faster and more efficient. The main difference is that Meteor also offers a Node.JS- based server for running your code, which is integrated with other applications to make deploying a production system easier, among other things. Why choose one or the OTHER? It depends on the scope and aim of the project. If you have a static HTML page, and want to simply add some modern features to it (no refresh, or making certain content dynamic), then AngularJS is best. This is because it can be added into the existing HTML page, and is relatively lightweight. If you're writing an entire application from scratch, and need systems in place on both the server and the client side, you'll be better suited to Meteor. The same is true if you're deploying a web application on various devices (phones, tablets, desktops), and it will be more than just an HTML page with some dynamic content. Lastly, it boils down to personal choice. If both AngularJS and Meteor can do the things you need, pick the one that you like the look of best. If the extra features of Meteor appeal to you, use it. What about a CMS? As AngularJS is not a server- based framework, however, there are some CMS that integrate it into their systems. As AngularJS integrates easily into existing webpages, you could technically use it with any CMS you may already know. In the case of Meteor, there are some CMS that full circle magazine #95 contents ~ COMMAND & CONQUER I've seen: OrionJS, Meteor-Admin, or Azimuth. I have not used any of them, and they seem to vary in size and complexity. Depending on the size of the project, and on what features of a CMS you may need, simply creating a custom system in Meteor may be easier and faster. Will you write a tutorial ON EITHER ANGULARJS OR Meteor in a C&C article? As AngularJS is featured in Code School, I feel an article focused on this would be a duplication of effort. However, if there are specific questions, I will be happy to answer them. Also, if there is enough interest in an article on Meteor, I will happily write that too. Hopefully this has enthused some readers to give AngularJS and Meteor a shot in some of their existing (and/or future) projects.

Walters irst, let me thank all the readers who sent me emails of hope and wishes for a quick recovery. They were very kind and helpful. I also want to thank Ronnie, our wonderful editor, for his support and patience during that painful period. I still have issues with sitting for long periods of time, so this is being done over the course of a number of days, so I hope the continuity that I'm trying for works. Now on with \"the show\"... Not too long ago, I was walking to the time clock and the General Manager of my \"day job\" called me into his office. Hoping it was just a \"how's it going\" talk, I went in and sat down. He then started the meeting with \"I'm having a problem with my spreadsheet program, and was hoping you could help me\". As my vision darkened and the three-note ominous orchestral string hits \"Da Da DAAAAAAAAA\" that we all know from the horror flicks of the 70's and 80's rang through my mind, rather than running screaming from the room, I innocently asked what was wrong. He responded that there was something wrong with one of the macros and \"the thing just quits in the middle of the calculations\". As I whipped out my white cowboy hat, I said in my best hero voice \"Don't worry citizen. We'll have you up and running in no time.\" Within a short while, I discovered the reason the spreadsheet was unceremoniously crashing was that one cell in one of 35 workbooks was getting a divide by zero error due to an expected value not being entered in another cell in yet another one of the 35 workbooks. Let me make this perfectly clear, it was not my boss's fault. All he had asked for was a simple way to get the higher-up values from the data. (The previous two sentences have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my boss may read this article! Or maybe it does.) As I walked back to my work area, brushing the spurious bits of computer code from my white hat, I realized that this would be an excellent teaching moment. So, here we are. But first, let's revert back to 1979 when Apple introduced Visicalc. That was the first \"Free Form Calculation type system\" to really make a hit in the marketplace. While there were many bugs in the software, the world loved the idea and clones (bugs and all) began to pop up on other computer systems, like the Commodore Pet and other Apple competitors (including Microsoft in 1981 with a program called Multiplan). Finally, in 1983, a company called Lotus Development Corp. introduced Lotus 1-2-3. While very close to Visicalc in many aspects, including the menu structure, it was written completely in x86 assembly language, which made it very fast, and many of the bugs of Visicalc were fixed. Lotus 1-2-3 was so popular that it became a common benchmark to test a machine for \"PC Compatibility\". The advent of the Free Form Calculation systems, allowed the \"normal\" person to deal with numbers in a way that previously was in the realm of the programmer. Almost anyone could, in a few hours or so, make sense of numbers, create charts and graphs, and share that information with coworkers. Shortly after that, the ability to automate some portions of the spreadsheet through Macros and Basic-like embedded languages gave these non- programmer users even more power over their destiny. They could get the answers themselves, and pretty charts and graphs as well, without having to wait in the queue for I.T. assistance. However, as we all learned from Peter Parker's uncle Ben... With great power, comes GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. Soon the spreadsheet was taken into areas that were better suited for databases than spreadsheets. We now had workbooks upon workbooks that relied on other workbooks, and if one little number along the way didn't happen to get updated... well, we had the old \"house of cards\" effect. contents ~ full circle magazine #95 15 HOWTO - PYTHON While I don't think that every spreadsheet is evil, there are some (read this to say 'many') that should have been converted to databases many years ago. They just became too large and unwieldy for their own good. If someone had just sat down with the programmers and said, \"Please help”, the world would be a kinder, gentler place. Now as I step down from my soapbox, we come to the real reason for this month's article. Every good Python programmer should have a way to deal with spreadsheets in their arsenal of tools. You never know when you will be called upon to pull data from a spreadsheet and manipulate it. While there are many ways to get data from spreadsheets like using CSV files, which has its own drawbacks, sometimes you need to read and write directly from and to a 'live' spreadsheet. After looking around, I settled on a very nice library to access my boss's problematical spreadsheet. We will be adding the library called XLRD, which one might imagine stands for eXceL ReaD. This library allows us to easily read data from Excel files (.xls , .xlsx and .xlsm) from versions 2.0 onward. Let's create an excel spreadsheet that we can use to examine the functionality of XLRD. Either open excel, or openoffice or libreoffice calc. In the first column (A), enter the numbers 1 to 5 going down. In the next column (B), enter 6 to 10. It should look something like this: A B 1 1 6 2 2 7 3 3 8 4 4 9 5 5 10 Now save the spreadsheet as \"example1.xls\" in the folder you will use to save the test code. This way, we won't have to worry about paths. Now download and install XLRD (https://pvpi.pvthon.org/pvpi/xlrd) . We can use it like is shown below. Save the file as examplel .py in the same folder as the spreadsheet. Since the code is so short, we will simply discuss it here. Of course, the first line imports the library. Then we create a function called OpenFile and pass the name (and path if needed) of the spreadsheet to the function. Now we call the open_workbook method and get back a 'book' object. Then we use the nsheets attribute to return the number of ACTIVE workbooks. We can also get the name of the workbooks. In this case, they are the default. We use the if name == M main M : path = \"examplel . xls” OpenFile (path) sheet_by_index method to get Sheetl into the first_sheet object. Now we can start getting data. We get the information from the cell at position (1,1) which translates to cell position B2 (it's Zero based, so cell A1 would be (0,0)). We print the data from there, both what the cell contains and the value, so we could use it in a calculation if we wish. That was really easy, wasn't it? Now, let's do something a bit more useful. Enter the code shown on the next page (top right) and save it as 'example2.py'. This example will print out the contents of the workbook. Since we already used the first four lines of code in the first import xlrd def OpenFile (path) : # Open and read excel file book = xlrd. open_workbook (path) # Get number of active workbooks print \"Number of workbooks : \" , book . nsheets # Get the names of those workbooks print \"Workbook names : \" , book . sheet_names ( ) f irst_sheet = book . sheet_by_index (0) cell = first_sheet . cell (1, 1) print \"Cell at 1,1: \" , cell print \"Cell Value at 1,1: \", cell . value full circle magazine #95 16 contents ^ HOWTO - PYTHON example, we'll skip them. By using the 'sheet.nrows' and 'sheet.ncols' attributes, we get the number of rows and columns. This can be helpful, not only so we know what we are dealing with; we can write \"generic\" routines that use those values in our calculations as you will see. In fact, we use 'rows' in a for loop to obtain each row's information. Notice the line that has 'first_sheet.row_slice'. This gets a block of cells of a given row. The syntax is as follows: x = f irst_sheet . row_slice (RowInQu est ion , Start_Column , End_Column) So we have used the number of rows and the number of columns in calculations. The output from our program should look something like this... There are 5 rows in this workbook . There are 2 cols in this workbook . [number : 1 . 0 , number : 6 . 0 ] [number : 2 . 0 , number : 7 . 0 ] [number : 3 . 0 , number : 8 . 0 ] [number : 4 . 0 , number : 9 . 0 ] [number: 5.0, number: 10.0] Press any key to continue . . import xlrd def OpenFile (path) : book = xlrd. open_workbook (path) f irst_sheet = book . sheet_by_index ( 0 ) # Get the number of rows in this workbook rows = f irst_sheet . nrows # get the number of columns in this workbook cols = f irst_sheet . ncols print \"There are %d rows in this workbook.\" % rows print \"There are %d cols in this workbook.\" % cols for r in r ange ( 0 , r ows ) : cells = first_sheet . row_slice (rowx=r, start_colx=0 , end_colx=cols) print cells if name == \" main \" : path = \"examplel.xls\" OpenFile (path) We'll do one more example before we end this month's article. Go to the spreadsheet and in column C put some dates. Here's what my spreadsheet looks like now: 1 6 1/10/2014 2 7 4/15/2015 3 a 6/24/1986 4 9 9/30/1963 5 10 3/3/2000 You can use any dates you like. Now let's re-run our example2.py program. Here is the output from mine. There are 5 rows in this workbook . There are 3 cols in this workbook . [number : 1 . 0 , number : 6 . 0 , xldate: 41649.0] [number : 2 . 0 , number : 7 . 0 , xldate: 42109.0] [number : 3 . 0 , number : 8 . 0 , xldate: 31587.0] [number : 4 . 0 , number : 9 . 0 , xldate: 23284.0] [number : 5 . 0 , number : 10 . 0 , xldate : 36588 . 0] Press any key to continue . . . Well, that's not what we expected. It seems that excel holds dates as a value that is simply formatted for whatever we ask it to. This might be helpful for sorting and calculations, but, for showing the actual data, this won't do. Luckily, the writers of the library already thought of this. Delete the line that says \"print cells\" and replace it with the code shown below. for c in cells : if c.ctype == xlrd . XL_CELL_DATE : date_value = xlrd. xldate_as_tuple (c. value, book. datemode) dt = str (date_value [1] ) + \"/\" + str (date_value [2] ) + \"/\" + str (date_value [0] ) print dt else : print c . value full circle magazine #95 17 contents ~ HOWTO - PYTHON Here, we go through each cell in the cells list and check the type of the cell to see if it is considered a XL_CELL_DATE. If it is, then we convert it to a tuple. It is stored as YYYY,MM,DD. We simply pretty it up to print it as MM/DD/YYYY. Here is the output of our new program... There are 5 rows in this workbook . There are 3 cols in this workbook . 1.0 6.0 1/10/2014 2.0 7.0 4/15/2015 3.0 8.0 6/24/1986 4.0 9.0 9/30/1963 5.0 10.0 3/3/2000 Press any key to continue . . . Just for your information, there is a library from the same wonderful people called XLWT, which allows you to write to excel files. There is a wonderful tutorial and documentation on these two libraries at http://www.python- excel.org/ . The source code for example3.py is on pastebin at http://pastebin.com/bWz7beBw .

The web is a great resource for data and much of that data is dynamic. You may even want to collect this data into a spreadsheet and make the spreadsheet mirror the dynamic nature of the web data. Calc allows us to link to external data sources, including web pages, and it will surprise you how easy it is. Many people trade stocks. Trading requires diligently tracking the stocks. In the past, I have shown this done manually, but today, I am going to show you a way to use a Calc spreadsheet to track the top 1 00 stocks as compiled by the web site barchart.com. LibreOffice Pt.47 - Linking To The Web you want. You will import the web page using the Web Page Query filter. Once imported, you can examine the elements of the page to find the data you want to extract. You will then create your sheet of 100 stocks by pulling from your imported source file. Setting Up the Source Sheet When you import the source using the Web Page Query filter, you are not actually working with a local copy, but a link to the page on the Internet. You will not save this import (but you could). Instead, you are using it as a reference to the actual page on the barchart.com web site. different file types recognized by LibreOffice are listed here. Scroll through and find the filter named \"Web Page Query (Calc)\". This will help you create your link to the web page. In the \"File name\" text box, enter (or copy and paste) the following URL: http://www.barchart.com/stocks/si qnals/toplOO Click the Open button. Calc will take a few seconds then come up with the Import Options dialog. The Automatic option will import the web page \"as is.\" Custom allows you to select another language for importing the page. I recommend using Automatic as it has the greatest chance for proper interpretation. The \"Detect special numbers (such as dates)\" checkbox does what you think it does. When checked, it will detect dates, times, etc, and format them appropriately in the sheet. We do not have special numbers we are concerned about, so we don't need it. Click OK to accept the options. Depending on your Internet connection, computer speed and memory, Calc will take a few seconds to import the web page. Notice that it imports the entire web page minus the images. NOTE: This is a link to the actual web page. Nothing has been saved on your local computer at this point. Like so many things, there is more than one way to do this. I'm going to show the method I feel is the easiest for discovering and getting exactly the information From the menus, File > Open. In the Open dialog, you will find the file type filter drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog.

The Navigator shows you the elements and structure of a document and changes depending on the type of document you have open. Not only is it good for our purposes here, but for navigating and manipulating a document, especially a large document. Currently, there are four ways to open the Navigator: • Press F5 on your keyboard • View > Navigator • Navigator tab on the sidebar • Navigator button on the standard toolbar Examine the Source When a web page is imported, several range-names are created, as well as importing named tables on the web page. The prefix HTML_ is added to any names imported from the page. The filter creates two special ranges, HTML_all and HTML_tables. HTML_all allows you to select the entire document. HTML_tables allows you to select all the tables. The problem you run up against is the creator of the web page probably wasn't thinking about you importing his page into Calc. Imported table names were for the creator's reference not yours. If you open the Navigator using one of the methods listed above, in our source document, you will discover a list of names under the \"Range-names\" item in the Navigator. Double-click on a range- name to highlight it in the document. As you go through the list, you soon discover that the names HTML_4 and HTML_dt1 both contain the table with our stock data. You will use one of these to create your stocks document. Import Table to New Sheet Now that you know what range- name to import for the stocks data, it's time to create the sheet you want to save and keep. You will import from the source document into a new document. Remember that your source document is just a link to the actual web page, nothing has been saved to your local computer yet. llntitledl (active) Active Winder □ m n H * | V V Insert as Hyperlink insert as Link insert as Copy II _ From the menus, File > New > Spreadsheet. Use any of the four methods discussed above to open the Navigator. From the documents list at the bottom of the Navigator window/panel, select the source document, topi 00. Click on the drag-mode icon in the Navigator toolbar and change the setting to \"Insert as link.\" Expand the entries under the \"Range names.\" Select either HTML_4 or HTML_dt1, drag it to cell A1 in the new document, and release. After a few seconds, depending on your internet and computer speeds, the stocks data will appear in your new sheet. Save the new document. You can now close the source document. There is no need to save it. Your new document is actually linked to the page on the web site and not the source document. full circle magazine #95 20 contents ~ HOWTO -LIBREOFFICE You can close your new document, and when you open it, you are prompted about whether to update the links in the File. If you answer Yes, Calc will retrieve a fresh version of the page and update the data in your sheet. You can set the file to update periodically when it is opened. In the menus, Edit > Links brings up the Edit Links dialog. With the link selected, click on the Modify button to bring up the External Data dialog. Check the \"Update every...\" check box, and fill in the number of seconds between every update. For example, every five minutes is 300 seconds, ten minutes is 600 seconds, and an hour is 3,600 seconds. Click OK to save your changes and Close to close the Edit Link dialog. Importing dynamic data from a web page in Calc is pretty simple. Use the Web Page Query filter to link the page to a sheet. With the Navigator, you can examine the page to determine which range- name contains the data you need. Once you know the range you need to use, you use the Navigator to drag the range-name into a new sheet and save the new document. The new document will prompt you to update every time you open the document or periodically, should you assign an update period to it. Elmer Perry's history of working, and programming, computers involves an Apple ][E, adding some Amiga, a generous helping of DOS and Windows, a dash of Unix, and blend well with Linux and Ubuntu. He blogs at h ttp://e eDerrv.wordpre ss.co m full circle magazine #95 ra 21 A contents Use LaTeX HOW-TO Written by John Edie Kerr L aTeX (pronounced laytech) is an enhancement of the Tex document creation software. Tex is the creation of Donald Knuth who is a computer programmer. TeX was released in 1978 and later Tex was improved upon by Leslie Lamport in 1 984. That is why it is called LaTeX. LaTeX has been around for a long time, and I call LaTeX the Great Grandma of desktop publishing. LaTeX is more structured than modern desktop publishing applications. There are many editor applications for creating LaTeX documents, and it can be easy to call LaTeX a word processing program. Nothing is further from the truth - LaTeX is a language and it is a language that has to be learned in order to be successful at creating documents. LaTeX has a steep learning curve, and some people claim that it is so much faster and easier to use a word processor. Except that: \"Many people discover LaTeX after years of struggling with word processors and desktop publishing systems, and are amazed to find that TeX has been around for nearly 25 [+] years and they hadn't heard of it. \"It's not a conspiracy, just a well-kept secret known only to a few million people\", as one anonymous user put it . \" - Peter Flynn People who have had enough of the problems encountered with word processors, especially Microsoft Word, have found LaTeX to be much easier to use, and a more productive, stable method. At the same time that I am writing this, two researchers from Germany published a paper comparing Latex to Microsoft Word. Their findings favoured Microsoft Word for efficiency, but not only that: the two authors of the paper suggested that researchers at universities be prevented from using Latex. Many scholars weighed in on this strange conclusion and found the study to be flawed, if not manipulated, to favour Word. As you can imagine, there was a firestorm over this one; I thought that this was one of the best comments: I've shown people LaTeX documents of mine, the content of which they are completely ignorant, and they always remark how pretty it looks. I've never gotten a compliment like that about a Word document! - David Kotschessa, University of South Florida, Tampa. See this site if you want to read more about this debate: htt p:// lemir e .me / b l o q/ ar c hi v es / 20 15 / 01 / 1 4 / k n au f f-and-nejasmic- reco m mend-banninq - latex/#comments (the site has a link to the original article). Forty years ago when I was at university, I would have thought I had died and gone to heaven if I had LaTeX to write my papers with. Over the years, I have taken some stabs at LaTeX but it was after I completed a beamer slide project using LaTeX on my Raspberry Pi that I realised that LaTeX has a lot of power with very little overhead. Now I use LaTeX as often as I can, almost abandoning LibreOffice entirely. I have to admit that there are some things that are very easy to do in LibreOffice compared to LaTeX, but the end product from LaTeX is so much better. The Latex community is a good example of what the free software movement is all about. It has, in a way, made this article difficult to write as there is so much good help out there on the Internet. Why Bother to Learn Latex? • There is no Meta-data in a Latex file. In some work environments, that can be critical. • I have seen many testimonials in favour of LaTeX by students who, after years of using MS Word, switched to LaTeX to write their thesis at university. • Forget Powerpoint; the Beamer class of document in LaTeX creates excellent slides. Save as a PDF document and present it anywhere. I have seen enough Powerpoint presentations get messed up by the presenter not really knowing how to use the application. • Latex can be run on very limited hardware. You can run Latex on an old XP laptop with 500 megs of RAM or on a Raspberry Pi fl contents ~ full circle magazine #95 22 HOWTO - USE LATEX computer. • It is a new skill, probably much more valuable to a young person's life than top scores playing computer games. Give a young person a \"LaTeX challenge\" to improve their knowledge and get them off of the joystick for a change. • It is so cool that we can create all kinds of fancy stuff with an ASCII file. Getting Started Anyone who has done coding in HTML will be able to pick up on LaTeX much easier than someone who has not, or has created HTML only in a WYSIWYG editor. The best method to install would be to go to the Ubuntu Software Centre and install TeX Live. If you want to be on the cutting edge of Tex, you could install TeX Live from the Tex Users Group. Either way will give you the files required. The instructions are here: https://help.ubuntu.com/communi tv/LaTeX . Selecting An Editor It is necessary to select a LaTeX text editor for creating LaTeX documents. There are lots to choose from within Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Centre and recommending one is the stuff that flame wars can be made of. I prefer any editor that has pull- down menus listed in a logical way - the formating code required to create documents. Latex is a huge environment with lots of code out there. As we are learning, it is helpful to be able to see the code we need. It is also helpful to have a built-in viewer to display our document as it will be printed. There are three LaTeX editors that I have liked: LaTexila, TexMaker, and the text editor Geany with LaTeX extensions. LaTeXila would be a good choice to get your feet wet as it looks like many text editors that you have used before. TexMaker looks confusing and complicated, but after you get adjusted to the wide selection of buttons and menus, it is an easy program to use as well. Geany worked well on my Raspberry Pi. You may have to install \"latexmk\" to get LaTeXzila to run. After you have downloaded the software, I would recommend watching this video: 'Learn Latex in Five minutes' https://www.voutube.com/watch7v =Y-kXtWditmw - now I have let the cat out of the bag! You can now see that there are lots of Latex HowTo videos on YouTube. Before you write your first LaTeX document, one initial bit of advice: always create a folder for the document that you are working on and keep all of the files related to the document in it. This will serve you well when you try more complex documents. Go get your feet wet, and we will come back to this next issue. At least now you are in on one of the world's well kept secrets. fa John Eddie Kerr is a Law Librarian at a county law library in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.

It's a handy trick for creating a collection of similar-but-not- identical objects, such as a crowd of characters with differently colored hair or clothes. You can use this same mechanism with the Tiled Clones dialog to produce arrays of clones whose colors differ from the parent object either in subtle drifts of shade and hue, or in big, bold steps. As usual, we'll start by drawing a simple parent shape - our familiar round-cornered square. But, rather than fill it with color, we'll unset it either by using the \"?\" button in the Fill tab of the Fill & Stroke dialog, or by right-clicking on the color swatch in the bottom- left of Inkscape's status bar and selecting \"Unset fill\". We'll also use the Reset button at the bottom of the Tiled Clones dialog to get back to a sensible set of defaults, regardless of your experimentations as a result of the previous two articles. With all the preparations in place, let's take a look at the \"Colour\" tab (in my British English installation) of the Tiled Clones dialog. The general layout of this should be familiar by now, but the details differ a little when compared to the tabs we've looked at previously. The first change is the addition of the \"Initial colour\" field at the top. Clicking the swatch there opens a color picker from which to choose the initial color that your clones will take. It's \"initial\" because the rest of the fields can subsequently change the color quite drastically. With everything else in this tab set to zero, clicking the Create button will produce an array of clones, all taking on that initial color. The visual effect will be no different to cloning a solid-colored parent object, so, in this case, we end up with an array of red squares. I've moved the parent out from under the first clone a little, so you can see that its own color remains unset. The remaining fields in the tab allow us to change H (Hue), S (Saturation) and L (Lightness) for each row and column, with the usual options for randomise and alternate. If you're not very familiar with the HSL color model, it's perhaps best explained by looking at the \"Wheel\" tab on any of Inkscape's color pickers. Yes, there's also a dedicated HSL tab, but although I find it to be the more useful for day-to-day use, the wheel view is a better explanatory tool. Hue, the first of our three values, represents a position on the outside circle. You might expect a value from 0° to 360° - or full circle magazine #95 25 ft contents HOWTO -INKSCAPE the equivalent in radians if you're more mathematically inclined - but that would be too sensible. Instead the range of values available varies in different parts of the Inkscape interface. Within the HSL tab, for example, the numbers run from 0 to 255. Within the Tiled Clones dialog, however, they run from 0% to 1 00%. In either case, 0 represents pure red with increasing numbers progressing anti-clockwise through yellow, green, blue and purple before the end of the scale brings you back around to red. Having picked a base Hue, the triangle in the center is used to select a combination of the Saturation and Lightness values. With the hue set at 0 (pure red), the triangle is oriented as shown in the screenshot. Now imagine a pair of axes, one running from the pure colored corner of the triangle to its opposite edge (a horizontal line in this case) and another running along this edge between the two other corners (a vertical line). Saturation is the position along the first line, and defines the amount of the pure color that's present in the final swatch - how \"washed out\" it appears. Lightness is the position on the second line, representing how dark or light the color is. When Saturation is zero there is none of the pure color present, so the result is a shade of gray that can run from pure black (when Lightness is zero) to pure white (when Lightness is at its maximum). The ranges for Saturation and Lightness also run from 0 to 255 on the HSL tab, or 0% to 100% in the Tiled Clones dialog. The important thing to realize is that the Hue can wrap round - a value of 50% gives you exactly the same pure cyan as 1 50% or 250%. Saturation and Lightness don't wrap: values above 100% won't suddenly wrap round to lower values, but neither will they result in extra saturation or extra lightness. Values less than 0% behave similarly. With all that in mind, let's put a value of 25% in the Per Column \"H\" field. We've got four columns, so the colors will be picked from our color wheel at positions of 0, 25%, 50% and 75%, working anti- clockwise from your selected Initial Color - pure red in this example. It should be easy to see that this gives us red, green, cyan and purple for the columns of our clones. Can you work out what will happen if we change the number of columns to 8? Remember that the Hue value can wrap round. How about if we use a value of 33.3%, 50% or something else entirely? Now try putting a value of -50% into the Per Row \"S\" field. With each row you'll get less and less of the pure color included. Given that our starting color is already pure red at 100% saturation, this gives us values for our three rows of 100%, 50% and 0%, resulting in rows that are pure colors, washed out colors, and completely gray. Given that the Saturation value doesn't wrap, can you guess what the result would be for more than three rows? Also try picking an initial color with low saturation and then putting a positive value in the field instead. Finally, let's reset our initial color to pure red, and play with the Per Row \"L\" field. You might expect that putting -50% in here would have a similar effect to the Saturation, giving values of 100%, 50% and 0% for rows that are bright, dark, then black. Instead you get this: The issue is that the Lightness scale runs from 0% (black) to 100% (white) - pure red, of course, has neither too much white nor too much black, so its value is actually 50%. Thinking of Lightness as running along a vertical line in the earlier color wheel image, it's easy to see that the red corner of the triangle lies 50% of the way up. Checking the HSL tab will also show that your pure red color has a Lightness of 1 28 (out of 255). Now you should be able to see that a fl contents ~ full circle magazine #95 26 HOWTO -INKSCAPE value of -50% in the field leads to rows of 50%, 0%, 0% (Lightness doesn't wrap either). -25% will give us the expected outcome. Try creating a larger array of clones with small values in the fields to get gently sweeping changes in color or tone. Or use bigger values - especially in the \"H\" field - to get bold differences between the clones. Finally, try drawing a simple leaf with veins but an unset fill. Group the parts, then use the tiled clones dialog to create an array of them. With a little use of the Random fields in each of the tabs we've discussed so far - plus some negative offsets in the Shift tab to pull everything together a little - you can quickly and easily create an autumnal forest floor background. You may recall that it's possible to unset the stroke of a parent object as well as its fill. This also works with the Tiled Clones dialog, but, as there is only one Colour tab, there's no way to use different generated colors for the fill and stroke: you can unset the fill color, the stroke color, or both, but anything that's unset will be given the same generated color. There's also no way to set any of the other stroke parameters through this dialog - although you can manually set them on each clone afterwards. This means that the Tiled Clones dialog isn't a great help if you want to create hundreds of clones whose stroke width or line style varies. In this final example, I've cloned a yellow rounded square with an unset stroke, but the different widths and dash styles of the strokes all had to be manually set afterwards via the Fill and Stroke dialog. I had promised to cover the Trace tab in this instalment, but the Color tab ended up being a more nuanced topic than I had previously expected, so the Trace tab has been postponed until next time.

I got them from Banggood for a couple of pounds/dollars each. One was a Nokia 5110 style screen, the other was a 1.8\" Color TFT screen which does 160 x 128 pixels: http://www.banqqood.eom/1 8- Inch-Serial-SPI-TFT-LCD-Displav- Module-With-Power-IC-SD-Socket- p-909802.html scoured around Banggood comments, and on Google, I eventually managed to find the right library, adjustments, and code, to get my screen to work. First, the libraries. You can grab them (and some documentation) from: http://devacron.com/ODtech TFT1 80A S6D02A1 %20LCD%20Module. It's the color screen I'd like to discuss this month. Coming from cheapo sellers such as Banggood (or if you use some eBay/Amazon sellers), most stuff has scant information. Having To install the libraries: go to the Arduino programming interface; in the menu, go to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library; and point it to the ZIP file that you downloaded. If you go to File > Examples > TFT > Arduino, you'll see some example code. Some screens that I've bought in the past (such as the Nokia 5110) come with the header pins (the pins you stick into the breadboard) as a separate piece that you need to solder on. This isn't much of a problem, but this color screen came with the header pins attached. So, plug the screen into your breadboard, wire up your Arduino 5V and GND pins to the relevant strips on your breadboard, and let's get the screen on. First, the important part that's not mentioned in most documentation: you must use 1 K resistors on all the data lines. In other words, all but the 5V, BL, and GND. You also need to connect the BL pin to the 5V line. Now, with it all wired up, we need some code. This code I'm going to show you is really for next month (where I'll add an ultrasonic sensor), but it is still a good foundation of how to get the screen to show you something. Code is at: http://pastebin.com/UYOe58xB m m oooooo< This is the TFT screen. It has eight pins. full circle magazine #95 28 <0^ contents ^ ARDUINO A couple of quick pointers and notes on the code: • You can ignore the <NewPing.h> - that's for next month. Also ignore the #define lines and the NewPing line below them. • The commented lines (beginning with //) are the pinouts for the screen. • The extern lines are for the font(s) used on the screen. SmallFont() is about the best, but you can chop and change between it and, say, BigFont() in the code. The setup() is exclusively for the screen. All commands with myGLCD are for the screen. Let's look at a couple of them: We begin by initialising the screen: myGLCD . InitLCD ( ) ; Telling it we want to use the small font: myGLCD . setFont (SmallFont) ; Next, we clear the screen: myGLCD . clrScr ( ) ; Pick a color to use in the next command: myGLCD . setColor (255, 255, 255) ; A very important thing to note here is with the color values. Normally you would use RGB, but this screen uses BGR. Using 255,0,0 won't get you red, it'll get you blue. Then we print 'Distance in cm:' one pixel down and in the center of the screen. myGLCD . print ( \"Distance in cm:\", CENTER, 1) ; The rest of the code is mainly for the sonar ping and displaying the distance, but we'll get to that next month. For now, feel free to read through the PDF's in the ZIP you downloaded. It has some interesting commands in there that will let you draw shapes and even set the screen display to landscape/portrait mode. Ronnie is the founder and (still!) editor of Full Circle.

What is the Cloud? It is not pretty clear. By the way, for home users, the most common meaning of the Cloud is file synchronization between devices, like Dropbox, Google Drive, and so on If you don't trust these solutions, e.g. you have to store sensitive data, or if you need to sync files only inside your network (you don't need these files to be accessible from the Internet), and also while achieving better network performance, or you want as much storage space as possible without spending a cent, then you have to install some software on your own, on your own home machines. An interesting and pretty new software to perform file synchronization is Syncthing (http://svncthinq.net/) . It is fully Open Source. It is pretty simple to install and easy to use. It is a very promising piece of software, useful to share and replicate your files between your devices using a P2P architecture, and since it is multi platform, you can synchronize your files among Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, Raspberry-Pi, Solaris and openBSD. It doesn't require any dependency, so you don't have to install and configure Apache, PHP and MySQL like you have to do with Owncloud or Seafile. On the other hand, Syncthing doesn't provide a plethora of features like those programs: it simply synchronizes files between your machines. How TO INSTALL SYNCTHING ON Ubuntu Installing and configuring Syncthing on Ubuntu is pretty straightforward. Go to https://qithub.com/svncthinq/svnc thinq/releases and download the release suitable for your architecture (32 or 64 bits). cd /var/tmp/ wget https : //github . com/ syncthing/ syncthing/releases/download/v 0.10. 21/syncthing-linux- amd64-v0 .10.21 .tar .gz tar xzvf syncthing-linux- amd64-v0 .10.21. tar . gz cd syncthing-linux-amd64- v0.10.21/ In this directory, you can find some documentation (FAQ and Getting started PDF documents), and some sample startup scripts. There is not a default place where to put the executable file. But in order to perform automatic full circle magazine #95 32 Syncthing updates, the directory (and the executable itself) should be writable by the user running the service. Yes, the service is not something system wide. The Syncthing process is related to a single user. So, potentially, if your PC is shared between multiple users, every user should run a separate instance (or copy) of the service. But, here, let's suppose that you are the only user of your PC. sudo mkdir /opt /syncthing sudo chown youruser / opt / syncthing cp syncthing /opt /syncthing Once that is done, you can delete the TAR file and the directory in /var/tmp. Now, in order to start the Syncthing process at every reboot, you need to configure some Linux initialization script: systemd, runit, rc.local. You can find various examples on the Syncthing forum (https://discourse.syncthinq.net) . Here below I will show you how contents ^ LINUX LAB description \"Syncthing service for user youruser\" start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo) stop on runlevel [ ! 2345 ] env STNORESTART=yes env HOME=/home/youruser setuid \"youruser” setgid \"youruser\" exec / opt / syncthing/ syncthing re spawn to configure the default init daemon on Ubuntu 14.04.

Please use your username, your home directory, and the path where you have placed the syncthing executable. Then start the service: sudo initctl start syncthing To configure it, Syncthing offers a clear and clever web GUI. You can eventually find the configuration files in the following directory: /home/youruser/.config/syncthing/ So open a web browser and connect to http://1 27.0.0.1:8080 Delete the default shared folder. Then add a new one: give it a Folder ID (it should be the same on every node), and select a path; if it doesn't exist it will be automatically created. Here you can enable file versioning, and you can decide if the folder will be shared as read- only to the other nodes. Now click Save, then click on restart. At this point you should change some settings. Click on the gear wheel in the upper right corner, then select \"Settings\". $ Settings EH Show ID (!)

If you enable such options, even if you are on a private network, it is a good thing to set up authentication (User and Password) and HTTPS. Then you can define some bandwidth limits related to this device (Upload and Download rate limit).

When requested, click again on the restart button. Now it is time to install Syncthing on another node. Follow the same steps also on the other PC in your network (if they run Ubuntu Linux), otherwise download and install the Windows package, or the Mac one. Delete the default shared folder and stop here. OK. Now, click on \"Show ID\". 151 Device identical ion — sync£ Here you will see an ID and a QR-Code.

On the other node web GUI, you should see a request that the first node wants to connect and that it wants to share a folder. Click on \"Add\" and then specify the folder path.

Put a file on the shared folder on one of the two nodes and magically it will be replicated on the other one. Following the above instructions, at this point you can add as many nodes as you want. And you can share a folder between some nodes, but not with others: for instance, if it is not necessary to have a folder shared with a specific node, you can prevent useless bandwidth wasting. What's next Well. We have looked at the hard way; now we can look to the unofficial Syncthing PPA repository: https://taunchpad.net/~vtvwldAt-ar chive/ubuntu/syncthinq And you can try the GTK GUI that you can find here https://qithub.com/svncthinq/svnc thinq-qtk (also in this case there is a PPA repository).

Multi platform As said, Syncthing is multi platform: Windows, Mac, Solaris (and derivatives, like SmartOS), openBSD. There is also a version for Linux on ARM platforms, so you can install it on devices like the Raspberry Pi. And on the Google Play (or on the FOSS F-Droid market) you can find an app for Android. There is not an iOS app right now. Conclusion As you have seen, Syncthing is very simple to install and configure. With this software you can only share and replicate files among your devices, a job that it performs pretty well. On the other hand, other than the configuration web page, there is not a web interface that allows you to access and manage files via the web: so you can't access or upload your files from a web browser, like with Dropbox, Google Drive or Seafile and Owncloud. And you don't have other facilities, like the ones you can find on products like Owncloud: shared calendar, address book, task scheduler, and so on. But if all that you need is to share your documents and pictures between all your devices (and eventually share files with your friend without relying on a third party infrastructure), Syncthing is what you need.

So many questions! I'll try to answer as many as I can throughout the review, and I'm hoping I can get an interview with someone from Canonical to answer the more technical questions. I'm purposely going to skim through the obligatory first switch on and basic usage as these things are mentioned in almost every review. I want to get to the real meat of things which is what you folks have asked. Turned On The first thing to do with the phone is to insert a SIM card. This is the first unusual thing about the Ubuntu Phone; it can take two SIM cards. Also, since many of you asked, yes, it is unlocked. When you first switch on the phone, don't panic about the long boot time, it's much faster thereafter. You are asked to sign in using Ubuntu One. That confused me.

Swiping Since using Ubuntu on a phone is different from Android and iOS, you're greeted with a tutorial that tells you all about the swiping. Ubuntu Phones use swiping from all sides of the screen and can have either a short swipe, or a long swipe. For example: a swipe for a short distance from the left to the right will bring in the side menu, but swiping longer will wipe away the current screen and return you to the Today scope. A short swipe from the left will switch to the previous app, a longer swipe will show a carousel of previously run apps to switch to. Scopes? Speaking of scopes. Scopes are effectively screens that you can swipe between. There's no desktop on Ubuntu Phones so you're greeted with the Today scope which shows you basic info such as weather, missed calls, news, etc. It's known as an aggregated scope as it pulls its info from elsewhere. Swipe right to left and you'll see the next scope, and so on.

Just remember though: most of these scopes are really just links to their mobile website in a pretty webapp. The Apps The phone comes with apps for phone calls, SMS, contacts, camera, gallery, playing media, reminders, tasks, but also webapps for Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Twitter. It even comes with Cut The Rope, the first well known title to get an Ubuntu edition. For messaging, a Jot of you asked about WhatsApp. While there's no version, as of writing; the phone does have Telegram which lets you message in a similar vein to WhatsApp, but it does require that your friends also have Telegram installed. Regarding contacts. While I did add my Google accounts, it didn't sync my contacts across. It did say something about syncing, but my contacts were (and still are) empty. You do need to enable access to G+, Gmail and Contacts in the account settings. Even with them on, I got no contacts. What about you, travellers... does it have maps to stop you contents ^ full circle magazine #95 38 REVIEW - BQ AQUARIS E4.5 from getting lost? Yes it does. It uses HERE Maps by default. Of course, you can install a Google Maps webapp if you like. HERE (from Nokia) has similar functionality to Google Maps - with satellite imagery and navigation. You can have map/satellite views - with public transport and live traffic layers if required. Navigation can be via car, walking or public transport. Adding Apps In the Apps scope, at the bottom, there's a nice big red button to take you to the Ubuntu Store. It's from here that you install new apps. Initially you see an 'app of the week'; then scrolling down you see top apps, game of the week, etc. At the top is a drop- down menu with categories, or you can press the magnifying glass icon to search for apps. < Ubuntu Store InFo Map qF the night Renders Che night sky based on y&ur Location on Earth's surface. Find stars* planed pr constellations and learn more about our universe. Having found your app (reviews and ratings are shown on the app page), you simply click the 'Install' button and wait for your app to install. Easy as that. Many of you asked about Google apps. Well, the good news is that there are apps to get you Gmail, Maps, Drive, and the like. One particularly handy app is simply called Gmail (the app is by Canonical), and it's a webapp that grants you access to Gmail, G+, YouTube, et al, and lets you sign in with multiple accounts and so on. Very handy. There's even an app for Google Drive. You can't edit documents with it, but you can view them. Speaking of cloud storage. Dropbox? Yes, there's an app for that too. Several of you asked about OneDrive. Yes, there's one for that too, and, while on the subject of Microsoft, there's also a webapp for Outlook. As the creator JoshStrobl says: any missing functionality is the fault of Microsoft. These webapps are, again, mobile web pages. What you get here is what you get in a mobile web browser. @ <& III ^ 4 'it S> 17:49 ph-ablc tflu hunt u phablct:-$ | (o) (D CTRL.+R CTRL+C CTRL+A CTRL+: 1 i J i 5 & q w e r t y u i o p a s d f g h j k l 4 z x c v b n m « ?123 © , Several of you crazy people asked about the availability of a terminal within the Ubuntu Phone. I'm happy to report that there is a terminal app that can be installed. Now, I'm no expert (not by any means) at the terminal, so I tried only some basic listing and directory commands, but they all worked as they would in Ubuntu (desktop). I typed apt-get and it ft contents ^ PublHher/Cneatur: Dennis Q’Fteherty Setter: Website: full circle magazine #95 39 REVIEW -BQ AQUARIS I gave me the help for it. Same with ssh. So it would seem that it's a fully functioning terminal. I've yet to find a document viewer app that will display .DOC or .ODT files, but there are several text and PDF viewers that work just fine and at least one app that lets you create markdown documents in ODT/PDF. If you're curious about what's in the Ubuntu Store, there's an unofficial site here: https://appstore.bhdouglass.co m/apps which shows the apps available. Settings System Settings > Network This lets you turn on/off WiFi and, of course, connect. Mobile lets you turn on/off mobile data and roaming. It's here that you see the first mention of 2G/3G. That's right. No 4G. But that doesn't worry me as I have no 4G reception where I live. Bluetooth. This is where it's a L5 bit odd. It seems that while the Bluetooth is, technically, functioning, it won't accept incoming files/connections. I got it to recognise my Nexus 5, but it wouldn't accept anything I sent over. Looking at the specs, it says (and I quote): \"software not currently integrated\". I can only hope they integrate it soon. I hardly use Bluetooth (if ever) but it seems a lot of you like it. System Settings > Personal In here, you can change the default background and set your sounds for ringtone and messages. There are pages of languages to choose from. I'm pretty sure you're covered here. Accounts is where you add your Facebook/Google/UbuntuOne, and notifications is where you can turn on/off popups from Telegram, Gmail, Twitter, etc. System Settings > System Pressing the Battery icon gives you a nice graph of your battery usage while Brightness lets you alter just that"
