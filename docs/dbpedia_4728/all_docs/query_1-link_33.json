To answer all these questions, I am writing this article to summarize the specification, release date, pricing and availability of the first Ubuntu Phone. This page will be continually updated with latest information.\n\nUbuntu Phone release date\n\nI know that Ubuntu Phone release date has been postponed for almost a year. It was rumored that Chinese manufacturer Meizu will be launching the first Ubuntu Phone earlier this year. It never happened. But good news is that we have another release date which is (hopefully) confirmed this time.\n\nSpanish company BQ will be launching the first Ubuntu Phone on 9th of February 2015, for European market. The device will be available from bq website through a series of flash sales. The model is bq Aquaris E4.5 which also has an Android version.\n\nIn some European countries, it will be available through telecom providers. As of now 3 Sweden, amena.com, giffgaff, and Portugal Telecom are all offering SIM bundles at purchase.\n\nUbuntu Phone Specifications\n\nBQ will launch its Aquaris model as the first Ubuntu Phone. It is supposed to have the following specifications:\n\nDimensions\n\nDimensions: 132 x 67 x 10.25 mm\n\nWeight: 150 g\n\nScreen\n\nSize: 4.5”\n\nTechnology: 5 points IPS capacitive multi-touch screen\n\nResolution: qHD 540 x 960 px. 240 HDPI\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9\n\nViewing angle: 178º\n\nMemory\n\n36 GB of memory (4 GB eMMC + 32 GB microSD™ card class 10)\n\nProcessor\n\nCPU: ARM Dual Core Cortex A9 1GHz\n\nGPU: PowerVR™ SGX531 up to 522 MHz\n\nRAM memory: 1 GB\n\nBattery\n\n1600 mAh Li-ion battery\n\nConnectivity\n\nWi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n\n\nmicro-USB\n\nBluetooth\n\n3G+ connectivity\n\nHSDPA: 7,2\n\nHSUPA: 5,76\n\nGPS\n\nConnections\n\nDual SIM card slot\n\n5V – 1A input\n\nJack 3.5 mm TRRS for earphones (OMTP)\n\nmicroSD™ slot\n\nSupported bands\n\nGSM: 850, 900, 1800 and 1900\n\nUMTS: 900 and 2100\n\nFunctions\n\nFrontal camera: VGA (640 x 480)\n\nRear camera: 8 Mp (3,264 x 2,448) with flash and autofocus\n\nLight sensor\n\nProximity sensor\n\nThe specifications are not very impressive when compared to other high end phones in the market but with moderate specifications comes reasonable price as well.\n\nUbuntu Phone price\n\nAlright, this has not been confirmed yet and there is no official words on it. But Canonical had hinted that the it will have a moderate price of 149 Euro (same as the Android version of Aquaris) 169.9 Euro.\n\nAvailability\n\nAs BQ is a Spanish brand, its first market would be European market. It is going to be released on 9th Feb 2015. There are no words on its release in US market though. We’ll have to wait for more information on it.
