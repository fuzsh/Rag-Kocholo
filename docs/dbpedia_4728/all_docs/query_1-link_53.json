        "text": "We stopped by the Ubuntu stand to play with the Meizu MX4 running the novel OS. Meizu had been building up to the MWC by teasing the new edition of the MX4, which happens to be only the second smartphone booting Ubuntu, after the entry-level BQ Aquaris E4.5.\n\nWhen it comes to hardware, the MX4 is the exact same device we reviewed a few months ago in its Android flavor. It sports a 5.36-inch display of 1152 x 1920 pixel resolution, a Mediatek chipset with an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM. It’s a distinctly better equipped device than the BQ Aquaris E4.5, and one that can be a more widely recognizable ambassador to the emerging OS platform.

With a Galaxy Note Edge and a Apple iPhone 6 on hand we snapped a couple of shots.\n\nThe idea is simple – a dark box with two holes just big enough to poke the camera of a phone. Read more »\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress fair grounds in Barcelona we ran into Carl Pei, Global Director of OnePlus Global, and he shared some interesting information with us. OnePlus is preparing an entrance into a new product category.\n\nSadly, he didn’t specify which one it is, but he said what it isn’t – a smartwatch or a tablet. Does that mean the rumors of a OnePlus smartwatch are dead. Read more »\n\nWiko announced two new smartphones yesterday and we have the hands-on impressions for you now. The Highway Star 4G and Highway Pure 4G are are both quite the lookers but also boast impressive specs.\n\nThe higher end of the duo is the Highway Star 4G and rocks a matte aluminum unibody with flat front glass. It also comes in various color options like Silver, Gold, Grey and Bleen (the cyan one). Read more »\n\nJust moments ago BlackBerry announced a brand new device ant it MWC 2015 press talk. The BlackBerry Leap, as it is called, comes with a 5-inch HD screen and is powered by what the company refers to as “mid-range” hardware.\n\nThe phone is equipped with a quite dated Snapdragon S4 Plus chip and comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage. Battery life should be pretty good thanks to the 2800 mAh battery pack, but it does come at a price, as the device is quite thick at 9.5mm and weighs 170g. Read more »\n\nToday at its MWC 2015 press event, Microsoft demonstrated the Project Spartan web browser running on a Lumia 930 and also mentioned that the upcoming Windows 10 Preview build will ship with the latest browser as well.\n\nProject Spartan will replace Internet Explorer as the default web browser in Windows 10 and early benchmarks show it to be really fast. Read more »\n\nMost of you surely remember project Loom – Google’s amazing effort to bring internet connectivity to remote locations, through specialized balloons. This is just one of the company’s numerous projects that aim to revolutionize the modern world and it is already making astounding progress. However, as it turns out, the tech giant has yet another ongoing endeavor, which could potentially hold the key to seamless internet access worldwide.\n\nBack in 2014 Google acquired an Albuquerque-based company, called “Titan Aerospace”, which specializes in designing and manufacturing unmanned aircrafts. Allegedly, the deal was sealed to snatch the company away from Facebook, which had set its sights on the business, but since then Google has definitely been making the most of its investment. Read more »\n\nAmidst all the commotion and announcements of mobile tech we often forget to mention some of the other tech innovation that debuts at the MWC. One item in particular grabbed our attention, mostly for its odd and interesting appearance.\n\nTP-Link’s brand new Touch 5 router is the perfect combination of geeky awesomeness and useless over-accessorizing. It is a powerful, high-bandwidth wireless router, complete with its very own, built-in touchscreen. As you might have guessed, this screen is dedicated to settings and accessing various features, which sound convenient enough, but honestly, how often do you need to change your router setting to actually justify a separate screen control. Read more »\n\nZTE Grand S3 went official just yesterday as the company’s latest flagship, which introduces Eyeprint ID biometric security service. ZTE is indeed the first manufacturer to implement this kind of technology into a mobile phone.\n\nThe ZTE Grand S3 packs a 5.5″ 1080p display and runs on the Snapdragon 801 chip with quad-core Krait 400 CPU at 2.5GHz, Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM. It also offers 16GB expandable storage, 16MP rear camera with dual-LED flash and an 8MP front selfie snapper. There is also LTE connectivity, Wi-Fi ac, Dolby Sound and a 3,100 mAh battery.\n\nWe went to see the smartphone at ZTE’s booth and we found it to be quite pretty with slightly curved glass on its front. Read more »\n\nAfter Microsoft took over Nokia’s devices business we felt we’d never hold another Nokia device again. But as it turned out the company wasn’t done. It’s not exactly clear how much of Nokia there is in the Nokia N1 but after handling it we feel reassured that this is indeed a product of the quality-driven Finish brand we know and love.\n\nThe Nokia N1 launched in China solely while the rest of the world is aching to see the low-cost high-end slate launch elsewhere. However the Nokia rep we talked to assures us that the Nokia N1 is coming to Europe – so here goes a sneak peak at what to expect. Read more »\n\nMost of you surely remember Google’s project ARA – the ingenious modular phone concept, that started out as “Phoneblocks”, way back in 2013. Well, it is pretty much alive today it seems to be coming up quite nicely.\n\nProject Are has drawn so much attention that there have been numerous conferences on the subject, as well as an official Project Ara Module Developers Kit and even a few actual Project Ara prototypes.\n\nWhile roaming around the MWC yesterday we stumbled upon Yezz Mobile’s take on a Project Ara phone. But before you get overly excited as well, it was not a functioning unit, but rather a model, showcasing what the first Ara devices should look like, once they become a reality, hopefully some time later this year. Read more »\n\nWhen we first heard about the Saygus V2, we immediately warmed up to the idea of a smartphone with a duo of microSD card slots and wondered why anyone haven’t done this before. Having insufficient storage on a smartphone is right next to the issue of small batteries for us and the Saygus V2 could easily become a trendsetter.\n\nThe two microSD card slots can hold up to 128GB memory cards each. Combine this with the 64GB internal storage and you get a maximum of 320GB total space. But the Saygus V2 isn’t just storage and has a lot more going for it. Read more »\n\nWe have to confess we had never heard of Oaxis before our meeting at the Pepcom event in Barcelona. The fitness tracking accessories have grown exponentially throughout the last year and we’ve already lost track.\n\nWell, that’s why industry events such as the MWC are so important. It turns out, the Oaxis Star.21 is an innovative fitness band, while the Oaxis O2 is more advanced tracker with display and heart-rate monitor. Read more »\n\nThe Moto E was one of the best phones you can buy on a budget, but now we have its successor in our hands. The Motorola Moto E (2015) has grown in size and we like the design better than the original. Plus, it’s more customizable, like a simple DIY Motomaker.\n\nWith increased competition from Microsoft and Chinese Androids, Motorola has to stay on top of its game if it wants to remain popular in the entry-level segment.
