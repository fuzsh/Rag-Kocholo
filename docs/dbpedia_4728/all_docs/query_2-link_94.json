        "text": "Episode 1\n\nIntro. Cold Wake-up Call\n\nJanuary, 2015. Las Rosas, industrial area of Madrid. H.Q. of bq.\n\n20-minute car ride. 10-minute Ducati ride.\n\nThe CEO of the company for which I humbly serve blows us away with news of the following kind:\n\n“Guys, your group in Russia showed really outstanding performance on the desktop 3-D printer market in 2014. We want to trust you with a serious job: bq’s release of Android and Ubuntu smartphones on the Russian market. Here are a few devices for a test-drive. Take them, use them, get to know the product.\n\nBy the end of the year we need to have sold 1,000,000 of them…\n\nYou can do it for sure.”\n\nNow what can you say here? A complete misunderstanding, right!?\n\nThe good news is: we’re into difficult jobs.\n\nThe bad news is: in order for us to effectively distribute any kind of products, we should LIKE them.\n\nAnd here we have just one tiny, little hitch.\n\nOr to be specific, whenever I get ANY Android in my hands, the feeling I experience could be described as something like:\n\nUuuuuuuuuuuuuugh…..\n\nOn January 19, 2015, I understood that I was going to have to work with products that I openly find unattractive. After all, I am hopelessly an AppleDude; and sure, all you guys who’re crazy about the Android can go ahead now and tell me to my face EVERYTHING you think about my deficient brainpower. I can take it.\n\nSo Android and some kind of marginal Ubuntu; was this really going to be how I would open the next chapter of my life?\n\n“Go hungry or savor… the fruits of one’s labor!” said I, putting myself at ease.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nThey Won’t Become Astronauts\n\nApril 16, 2015. On an airplane from Moscow to New York, Flight UN-1111.\n\nMy right eye is half-way open, while the left sleeps. I am randomly reading corporate emails, when I come across a conversation between my guys and someone from the retail chain well-known all over the World.\n\nWhen my brain, drifting in and out of stand-by, finally sees meaning behind the black letters of the email, the right eye suddenly bulges and the left flares open. I recognize my body’s usual reaction to… testosterone.\n\nThe text blaring from the screen of my tablet that drew up such a turbulent biological reaction inside my body was:\n\n“To put it bluntly: Ubuntu is a dead end.\n\nbq - is just another no-name brand sold at astronomical prices with no clarity to its price-list…\n\nThe Ubuntu smartphone is useful to a total of three-and-a-half loyal customers from Linux forums…”\n\nEpisode 3\n\nGeek Sneakers\n\nList of Characters:\n\nBrother 1 — experienced peddler\n\nBrother 2 — TOP-manager in game development company\n\n— Bro, hey, bro, you gotta help me! (First line of the play)\n\n— Huh?!\n\n— I mean, you’re in the GameDev Industry. You make games for tablets and smartphones…\n\n— Yeah, so what?!\n\n— Well, they put us in charge of releasing Ubuntu Mobile on the Russian market. So tell me, what’s WITH this Ubuntu? Is it cool or lame?\n\n— Gimme a sec… (Brother leaves the stage, a quiet conversation is heard behind the curtains of a loft, where there are 50 programmers, sitting. 10 minutes go by, and he returns. The expression on his face has changed from one of indifference to that of light perplexity and carefully concealed curiosity.)\n\n— I found out.\n\n— Well, quit stalling! Am I going to be happy or not?\n\n— From the 20 people I surveyed on the team, 14 of them have Ubuntu on their PCs. The opinions of the desktop version are highly positive.\n\n— So what about Ubuntu as a phone?\n\n— EVERYBODY was interested. Everybody wants to do some probing.\n\nBut that’s NOT the funniest part…\n\n— Quit messing around, this is no joke. What’s funny?\n\n— I have this coder from the lower class. It’s his third month out on probation. He gets paid less than minimum wage. He’s been wearing the same sneakers for 8 years, cause he’s got no money change ‘em. And he even thinks that way. It doesn’t even enter his head.\n\n— Very interesting (answered Brother 1 with sarcasm). I know how you love to exploit people. But you’re the only one who’s having fun here.\n\n— I didn’t finish! When I asked the guys about Ubuntu, he took off his headphones and for the first time in three months he started TALKING to us. By himself, of his own initiative. He’s got a speech impediment — I guess it’s once in a blue moon that he uses his voice at all — but something that was definitely clear is that he “s-s-s-sends” 50 dollars to Ubuntu every two months. 50 dollars every two months, think about it! He’s got no money to switch out his sneakers, but for that…\n\nCurtain…\n\nA voice from backstage:\n\nBrother 1. So what’ve we got? Our demographic for the Ubuntu smartphone is made up of insignificant, crazy coders from the lower class? How many of those can there be Russia? 457 total? Do they even have money?\n\nWhat a disaster…\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nWe pick it up…\n\nI don’t want to spend a lot of time on the packaging, as the rules of this genre do not permit me to. But I will say to those who remember the impression they got from the iPhone box — a feeling of the unordinary, even from what the standards call for, and at the same time one of harmony and balance — well, as far as bq’s Ubuntu goes, the packaging is competitive in this strength to move a user who is yearning for products from the AppleDudes. Without a doubt.\n\nThis isn’t important. But it certainly is pleasant.\n\nIt’s not Commie. It’s not Chinese. It’s no farce.\n\nI get quickly to the smartphone itself and tear off the plastic shipping film.\n\nTurn it on. “HI! Welcome to your UBUNTU Phone.”\n\nIt’s actually a little strange that, apart from the keys for power and volume, there are no physical buttons at all. The brain starts pulsating anxiously, “How will I ever survive without the HOME key!?” I quickly go through the first settings for initiation.\n\nThe telephone boots up.\n\nI open the door and go in…\n\nI click, flip, press, drag, open, close, tap, pull, let go, brush, return…\n\nAgain in a new order, I open, pull, click, drag up and down, down and up, drag from the edge with a long hold, from the edge with a short hold, close out, return…\n\nI listen to my inner voice.\n\n1. This is not an iPhone\n\n2. It’s not an Android\n\n3. Definitely not Windows\n\n4. Most importantly for me, I’m NOT GETTING SICK… It doesn’t make me siiiiiiiiiiiick!!\n\nAnd… I don’t even need that physical HOME key, let alone BACK.\n\nMagic. How did they do that?\n\nInterface / Ambiance\n\n(the cherry on top)\n\nBy the stylistic rules of this genre, I should save most interesting thing for last: I should keep the reader on the edge of their seat, waiting to exhale. But let’s throw away the laws of tradition, and I’ll now write about the thing that got me, an AppleDude, more excited than anything.\n\nI liked it inside there. It was something unordinary for me and definitely un-nauseating, even though I expected it to be…\n\nI’d like to note that the atmosphere you find yourself in is a kind of very calm design composition that doesn’t pierce your brain with bright colors.\n\nIt’s a kind of calm, harmonious atmosphere, free from all the “buy-buy” and “look-look” appeal.\n\nAnd now for something a little more detailed, without ambiguous descriptions of its characteristics.\n\nTo warm-up:\n\nSwipes\n\nUbuntu is the first smartphone in my life that can be activated by swipes from all edges. And it’s sensitive, but not overly sensitive.\n\nSwipe from the left, and you see the Launcher (Ubuntu menu).\n\nSwipe from the right, and you see all the open applications, or Scopes (more on them later).\n\nThe action of Swiping from the bottom depends on the content in display at the moment.\n\nBy default, swiping from the bottom lets you see the following controls (look the photo).\n\nSwiping from the top allows access to shortcuts:\n\nPhone Settings / Block Device Rotation / Files / GPS / BlueTooth / Network / Sound / Battery Status / Date and Time\n\nNow that we’re warmed up:\n\nScopes\n\nBecause this article was originally written in Russian, I spent some time thinking about how to reach the Russian-speaking audience with the sense of this word, “Scopes”.\n\nThat is to say, the meaning of the word “Scope” in English fails to capture the full essence of THAT, which this thing actually IS in the eco-atmosphere of Ubuntu and THAT which I feel I’ve been missing on my iPhone, even with its 140 apps already installed.\n\nThe closest thing my nontechnical mind could come up with for a definition that would capture the feeling I got from working inside this interface is: “МИРЫ” or “WORLDS”.\n\nThese are really thematic worlds that you can easily flip through, navigating with the thumb of your right hand. Scopes are page content aggregators that gather content from several different applications relative to the task/theme of the given world.\n\nThe Scopes that are most indicative of this feature are Today and NearBy.\n\nThe first one shows EVERYTHING you need to know about the current day.\n\nThe second one shows EVERYTHING you need to know, relative to where you’re currently located. Below there are three print screens, which were taken while scrolling this scope down:\n\nNearBy became a real lifesaver for me during my last trip to the States.\n\nBecause this customizable Scope-aggregator pulls content from various application sources, you no longer need to open Foursquare to find a place to eat, no longer need to open Yelp to find out what attractions are nearby, and no longer need to visit Wikipedia to read about the part of town you’re in. I stayed in New Jersey, where there was a view of Manhattan. Lovers of visuals no longer need to open Flicker or Instagram to steal a beautiful picture of the place or even to find a spot nearby where they can catch a nice angle of the city.\n\nYou have everything on one page, in one world, inside of one SCOPE.\n\nIt’s possible that I’m getting a little technical with my storytelling, but there are immediate feelings brought about by this kind of content organization (content that automatically changes according to where you are). It significantly frees up the time usually spent on manipulating a gadget, and well, just makes life easier. #TheWayOf Living.\n\nTo compare, look at the very same Scope in Moscow (no longer set for New York):\n\nNo unnecessary strains.\n\nFor a pocket that hops from one end of the planet to another, this is a feature of magic.\n\nNo kidding, this is totally a must-have and… customizable.\n\nLook the photo on the right side.\n\nYou could change the list and order of the content providers for my adored NearBy scope.\n\nIt works!\n\nI cannot get over Scopes. They are the very backbone of the interface, if you will, and for me personally the most exciting part.\n\nAttention: These developers at Ubuntu understand the possibilities in developing not just applications, but their very own worlds (Scopes). More information to come about these guys, these pioneers. Beyond any kind of doubt, if this paradigm appeals to the coherent group of smartphone users on this OS, then the emergence of new developments will be exponential.\n\nBelow you could see some examples of Scopes in Ububtu Touch:\n\nThe Film Trailers / Online Shopping / LEGO’s competitor Scope\n\nSpeed\n\nOur dear Ubuntouchka — yes, once again this is a place where we can use the diminutive form — does not posses premium horsepower.\n\nI am not a technically minded person, but word formations like “Dual-Core Processor”, “Quad-Core” and “RAM” do carry meaning for me. Everything is really, very modest in our case. For those who want to check it out, here’s the site.\n\nNevertheless, this Ubuntouchka soars in the sky… In almost three months of use, I didn’t notice any significant slowing down of processing. And I have to note that not once did the device go 100% choleric or psycho. That is, the phone never lost its mind. I would assume this is was the goal of the operations developers, rather than the device’s horsepower. But I could be wrong, so I won’t put money on it.\n\nOn a pass/fail, processing speed is a pass.\n\nAnd you know what application came in FIRST among the most popular?\n\nTake a look at Terminal on the right side photo!\n\nAppleDudes won’t understand this, but thanks to my age I know what it is, and I know that working with this thing, guys can do miracles. According to some unconfirmed rumors, this app is also a key to installe some Android apps. WhatsApp, for example…\n\nBut just rumors, calm down, Guys :)\n\nSo basically if this smartphone was distributed to both physicists and poets, then the first group would know a whole lot more about WHAT to do with the device, than the second (lyrics) group.\n\nAll the same, I don’t think the poets would be disappointed.\n\nAfter all, I’m one of them… :)\n\nNow shake it! Dont be bored!\n\nWe’re almost to the trapeze finale. The performers are on their way. On with desert.\n\nI saved all the most serious stuff for last.\n\nGet ready, cause this is not another experiment from Bill Nye the Science Guy…\n\nRead the title below, take a deep breath, suck in that gut, and … Go!\n\nSecurity / Privacy\n\nWho could win a railway pusher?\n\nThey say a train is the safest form of transportation. Only if you were cryogenically frozen in a vault could you be safer.\n\nAt least that’s the theory.\n\nThus, I introduce the selling point — not just for you dudes out there, but for any thinking person, who REALLY DOES care that information about themselves and their activities does not leak via smartphone or PC.\n\nOn your mark. Get set.\n\nExact figures are coming.\n\nThe UK Federal Department, CESG, responsible for providing security on software that is used throughout the Kingdom lead extensive research on OS users and came up with the following information:\n\nWho is working in IT there? Definitely not a beginner. And you don’t need to possess perfect English to understand who’s results came out on top in this British agency’s study (even though their main goal wasn’t even to find a winner). For those who’d like to see more, you may want to read the string of comments on Ubuntu’s forum where a detailed conversation is lead by end users.\n\nTake that one in. Take your time.\n\nUbuntu.\n\nConvergent solution.\n\nTo sum up, I’m about to write something that I myself don’t even fully comprehend, but the value of which I think will show itself through first-hand experience with the device.\n\nUbuntu on PCs, smartphones and tablets, as well as on its ecosystem, “Internet Things”, are NOT all different doors under the same shop-sign (as is the case with Mac’s OS and iOS on mobile devices, for example). It is literally all one Operating System.\n\nSo what does that actually mean?\n\nWell it MEANS that if you connect something like an external keyboard to a tablet running on Ubuntu, then you can use that tablet as if it were the full-fledged PC version of Ubuntu, and it absolutely goes the same way for a smartphone having been connected to an external monitor.\n\nCool? Sounds great?\n\nIt sounds inspirational, but being a guy who has no head for science, I still have to understand how practical this kind of architecture will be.\n\nThat it’s something new is indisputable — and not just because it’s fresh or kitsch or some kind of pathetic copy of something else, but because it is, in reality, an Operating System that contains new core senses, meanings.\n\nIn Place of a Conclusion\n\nHaving stopped a moment and set our gaze to the sky, let’s turn our mind’s eye back to the stories at the beginning of our narrative.\n\na serious job: bq’s release of Android and Ubuntu smartphones on the market.\n\n“To put it bluntly: Ubuntu is a dead end.\n\nThe Ubuntu smartphone is useful to a total of three-and-a-half loyal customers from Linux forums…”\n\nThe coder and his worn-out sneakers… every two months he “s-s-s-sends” 50 dollars to Ubuntu.\n\nGuys, lay it out straight.\n\nIf an everyday dude who was born blind, when it comes to technology was able to see THIS MUCH in Ubuntu, does it stand a chance in the world, for that matter?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWho’s right?\n\nCanonical?\n\nSome second-rate geek?\n\nThe honestly excited, though biased me?\n\nManagers of the federal network?\n\nWhat does the Future hold?\n\nIs there any room in it for Ubuntu?"
