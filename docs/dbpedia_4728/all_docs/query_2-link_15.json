        "text": "Hello UbPort People:\n\nI bought a nice BQ tablet with Ubuntu on it quite a few years ago. The idea seemed to have died, and I have not used the device in an ice age!\n\nHowever, I got it out today, and realized how nice it is... and wondered how I could update it and make it do more Ubuntu-like things.\n\nIs this the right form for this discussion???\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nDaryl, from Daryl's Rural Roadside Honor System Produce and Occasionally Dairy Stand\n\nRural, USA\n\n@daryl said in New \"Old\" BQ Aquaris M10 FHD for Ubuntu: how to update, and add other features?:\n\nHowever, I got it out today, and realized how nice it is... and wondered how I could update it and make it do more Ubuntu-like things.\n\nThis is indeed a very nice tablet. Thin, light, crisp screen. Works great with Ubuntu Touch. Unfortunately, unless a kind soul adopts this tablet to port it to 20.04, it will be left behind on Xenial while development focus moves to Focal.\n\nI am curious though, what Ubuntu-like things were you thinking about?\n\nHi @daryl\n\nI bet you still have a Canonical build on this tablet.\n\nYou can update it to the latest release with the UBports installer ; more information there: https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/device/frieza\n\nAlso be aware of @arubislander 's warning about end-of-life for this device.\n\nBut until then you'll have OTA 24 and 25 which is coming sooner than later\n\nNote: if you're the one who stole mine all those years ago: go to hell\n\n@applee Hi AppLee:\n\nNope, I wasn't the one who stole your Ubuntu tablet. I would feel the same way you seem to feel. Its a very nice machine, and it is unsettling to get robbed. I've never been robbed, but I've been cheated enough to be smarter than I used to be.\n\nAppLee, I've wondered if upgrading is worth it, and wondered what I'd gain from upgrading.\n\nI hope you will please advise me on that.\n\nFor the most part, I just want to have a vpn, and use it to surf, read online news, maybe a map app for travel, play music with a larger capacity sd chip, and just enjoy it.\n\nI might entertain trying to back it up onto my pi that has alot of storage using rsync over ssh.\n\nI\"m not doing any heavy crunching on this beautiful tablet.\n\nCould you advise me on whether I should bother, and if so, what I'll gain, and where I should start, please?\n\nI'm on your side. I didn't take your tablet.\n\nThank you,\n\nDaryl\n\n@daryl said in New \"Old\" BQ Aquaris M10 FHD for Ubuntu: how to update, and add other features?:\n\nFor the most part, I just want to have a vpn, and use it to surf, read online news, maybe a map app for travel, play music with a larger capacity sd chip, and just enjoy it.\n\nDepending on what protocol your VPN uses this can be done for sure. I have successfully gotten OpenVPN configurations imported and working via the command line. PPP might also work.\n\nI might entertain trying to back it up onto my pi that has alot of storage using rsync over ssh.\n\nMight I suggest Syncthing for that? It is what I use, to keep my books, OTPT's and allowed keys synced on all my Ubuntu Touch devices.\n\nHi @daryl\n\nI knew you did not steal my tablet ; I think it ended up in a garbage when they realized it was not android...\n\nSorry for the joke\n\nWell by upgrading to UBports OTA 24 you'll gain access to the latest apps in the open store.\n\nYo can check out the apps you're interested in there https://open-store.io/ and check on your tablet if you can install them without updating.\n\nYou'll also gain a better compatibility with more recent website while your browser may be fine it is outdated and maybe not tolerated by newer sites.\n\nBetter bluetooth compatibility ; it's still an issue but it used to be worse.\n\nOn the GPS side, I'd recommend Pure Maps it is an alternative to uNav and is very lovely to use.\n\nBut note also that you'll loose some feature that people loved about Ubuntu Touch. There are no more scopes.\n\nI would update just to get a better support and help from other users. I think it would be easier to configure your VPN on a recent build. I don't remember if it was easier or event doable back in Canonical era.\n\nI hope this is a bit helpful. Enjoy your tablet, I miss it very much."
