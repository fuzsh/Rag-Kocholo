For example, results for an image search would work best as large thumbnails in a carousel for browsing, while news snippets are more useful in list view, with a wider content area to display text.”\n\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/02/canonical-ubuntu-scopes-technology\n\n8 Things We Expect from Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)\n\nJun Auza of Tech Source writes about \"8 Things We Expect from Ubuntu 14/.04 Tristy Tahr\" since many people are expecting a lot of new features from the release.
