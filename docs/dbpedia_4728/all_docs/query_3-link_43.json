        "text": "On a Mac\n\n(August 19, 2024 at 4:42 AM CEST) SDon't worry. I only have turned on my Apple PowerBook G4 (a machine which was made when that company was named the \"Apple Computers\") and I'm now writing (and reading the gopherspace) on it. I think I didn't booted it for 6or so months! Read more...\n\nMNT Pocket Reform progress\n\n(July 29, 2024 at 4:42 AM CEST) There have been some changes both on the hardware and the software side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU module has a WiFi chip without any cooling. As the CPU is relatively hod (at least for the ARM) the WiFi part is hot, too - and it seems to work bad when hot. So the quick fix is to add a small thermal pad (about 2 mm thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term solution would be to use a cooler CPU. Read more...\n\nPocket Reform in use\n\n(June 13, 2024 at 4:42 AM CEST) My position at work have been changed from June 3 to a more challenging one. Thus the frequency of my posts might decrease even more. Read more...\n\nBritish OSes?\n\n(June 13, 2024 at 4:42 AM CEST) Logout 1 (the creator of the Bongusta, you know) wrote two nice posts about the operating systems from the Great Britain. While the RiscOS is known to me (I'm not saying I'm able to use it!) the OS of the Sinclair QL is something I never saw on a real hardware. Read more...\n\nMNT Pocket Reform\n\n(May 31, 2024 at 4:42 AM CEST) I think this is my last \"new\" computer for a long time. It arrived two days ago and now is (mostly) ready for use. The machine is new (from the batch of the first 18 machines shipped to customers) and still are some software details what need to be polished - suspend does not work in default setup (she suspend script refuses to work with the installed CPU and I didn't dare to try suspend it directly, yet; the NVME migration script does strange things). Read more...\n\nDesk changes\n\n(April 23, 2024 at 4:40 AM CEST) I have decided to re-organise my desk.For a few years (~5) I had one shared keyboard for \"all\" my machines but two LCDs - one for most of systems and one just for the SGI O2 (the O2 works best with the special SGI 1600SW screen - a special 17\" 1600x1024 device with a non-standard connector). Read more...\n\nremint (for remind)\n\n(April 18, 2024 at 4:40 AM CEST) Just a short note: the \"remint\" 1 is a nice too which makes use of the Remind calendar system (\"remind\") 2. Somewhat easier. Read more...\n\nThat's the end...\n\n(March 15, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) No, I'm not quitting the gopher (yet). But I have noticed than a few things changed. The Google finally killed their plain HTML Gmail interface. I used it a lot not only because if was WAY faster but also easier for me. It's not a big problem, anyway. I wasn't able to use the Gmail on my old machines for years because of: a) IMAP does now work, b) SSL+Firefox issues. So my SGI O2 was without the Gmail even when I used it for all other tasks. Read more...\n\nOld tech\n\n(March 10, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) The author of the phlog 1 asked about the oldest piece of technology people actually use. Well, I don't know what is my old obsolete thing. Well, probably one of my bikes. My current Moulton is from 1963. My Velamos bike includes even older parts for sure but don't use it often. Read more...\n\nFedora 38 (finally)\n\n(March 4, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) My Blackbird stopped to run X yesterday. The problem was the full disk. It was easy to solve but when I was cleaning unnecessary files I also have decided to finally do the update (I was running the Fedora 36 ppc64le till yesteday!). Read more...\n\nTangara\n\n(March 1, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) There is an interesting open hardware project - the Tangara music player 1. It seems to be something visually and functionally similar to the old Apple's music players from early 2000s but made from zero with use of modern components. Read more...\n\nAnalog stuff, mostly\n\n(March 1, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) It seems I prefer to be off the computer as much as I can. I think that this year I have spent more time using the gramophone than doing something interesting on the computer. Read more...\n\nWeather\n\n(February 12, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) The first third of February was quite warm here. It means nothing as we can get some serious snow as late as in April. We will see. At least there was time (I even used my summer hat at Saturday because it was hot here... well, it was about 15C) for some hiking and biking. Read more...\n\nGemini PDA sans camera\n\n(February 9, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) In the middle of the last year I have noticed that my Gamini PDA is not detecting it main camera. It wasn't a big issue as I use the Gemini rarely (it's Android 7 cannot be upgraded and many apps cannot be installed on this device at all) and the camera was quite bad. Read more...\n\nUsual situation\n\n(February 6, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) During years I noticed a strange phenomena: if I have became used to something then it suddenly changes or ceases to exist. The obvious examples are the Psion PDA (they decided to quit teh PDA market just after I bought the Series 5), the PowerPC at the Apple (well, they released the OS Tiger just after I finally familiarised withthe Jaguar and they announced their switch to the Intel just a feew weeks after I finally decided to get the iMac), then Palm (I so much wanted the WebPad!), the Linux version of the Intel Compute stick or the nVidia Shield tablets (I'm sorry but I had two). Read more...\n\nOn the SGI now\n\n(February 6, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) The frequency of use of my once the main desktop (the SGI O2, 2005-2019) was terrible in the 2023 and it wasn't better in this January. This is not good because this machine this easier to use than almost anything, prevents distraction caused by social networks, an e-mail and even by the most of WWW pages (nothing of that stuff works here these days). Read more...\n\nComputing in 2023\n\n(February 5, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) Logout asked on his Czech blog (he does it every year) about current computing environment of people. Read more...\n\nAlive\n\n(February 5, 2024 at 4:40 AM CET) At least sort of. It seems January 2024 is the first month without any post since I have use the gopher. Read more...\n\nMaking 3D stuff\n\n(December 28, 2023 at 6:58 PM CET) My wife requested re-creation of a small parts which broke on something. Just a part of handle assembly. The shape was quite simple so I have decided to try to make a 3D model. Read more...\n\nCycling in snow, 2023 edition\n\n(December 9, 2023 at 4:40 AM CET) There was no cold autumn this year. Temperatures were unusually moderate - ~5 degrees of Celsius and definitely over zero. Then in the last week of the November it have started to snow. Read more...\n\nArduino robot adventures (1)\n\n(December 9, 2023 at 4:40 AM CET) I have started - for practical reasons of course - to play with an Arduino-based 3D-printed robot. I decided to use the SMARS 1, It is not \"free hardware\" but it's freely available for personal use and it is rather simple to print and assemble. Read more...\n\nSGI, BASIC, OPL and so\n\n(November 14, 2023 at 4:40 AM CET) I'm running my SGI O2 once more. This is what I am doing rather randomly since I have got the POWER9 machine for a desktop and the ARM-based MNT-reform for as a laptop. Read more...\n\n(November 9, 2023 at 4:40 AM CET) Some time ago I decided to update RAM on my main machine - the Raptor Engineering Blackbird. This OpenPOWER workstation has \"just\" 4-core CPU (16 threads) which is still OK for most of tasks. But these 32 GB of RAM are not enough for some tasks. I occasionally need to generate some larger data sets and typical size is about 39 GB. This is OK but it means swapping to the disk. Not only swapping is not ideal for a SSD but it also greatly slows things down. Read more...\n\nState of my computing: October 2023\n\n(October 24, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) It seems I didn't write anything here for a long time. Perhaps a shift of interests but certainly a lack of time. In practice it means that I use computers for www browsing, office work and such stuff instead of fun/hobby things. Read more...\n\nBiking\n\n(October 24, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) So far I have just over 3000 km in 2023 (I rode 4000 km in total during 2022). It might sound like huge number but I'm commuting daily on my bike (~6 km per day, and usually 18 km once a week). Read more...\n\nTetgen, admeshview on ppc64le\n\n(September 26, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) The tetgen 1 on my Fedora on the ppc64le (the OpenPOWER) does not work. It starts and it can print help. But it fail on almost every STL file. No help from the admesh 2 (\"..core dumped..\"). Read more...\n\nSSH on Mac OS 10.4\n\n(September 26, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) Thanks to the Wayne Sadler I now have working ssh/scp client on my iMac G5. Obviously, it's the DropBear 1 2. Installation eas easy except two details: \"remote login\" service must be allowed in the System Preferences. Otherwise the installation will fail without a word of explanation. This is already described in comment at the 1. On my G5 the installation script failed to do the \"ln -s dbclient ssh\" operation so the old ssh binary was not touched. I have had to correct it manually (the \"scp\" was installed correctly). Read more...\n\nRISC-V on MNT closer than expected?\n\n(September 9, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) There was some discussion on social networks about the MilkV 1 board. It's a board which is physically compatible with the RapsberryPi Compute Module. Thus (in the ideal case) can be used with the MNT's CM4 adapter board 2. Nobody have tried it (yet) as the MilkV is only in an pre-order phase. There can be surprises and performance will be probably worse than performance of the MNT's original CPU board bud one never know. The CPU is similar to the SiFive 2's 3 one thus one can expect similar performance. Read more...\n\niMac G5 WiFi\n\n(September 8, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) In the past I tried several times to get the AirPort cart for my iMac G5 (1st generation machine with 17\" screen). I was never successful - every time I bought one on-line (no matter where) the seller always wrote to me that the offered product no longer works. So I gave up. Read more...\n\nBrakes! What brakes?\n\n(August 6, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) At Wednesday I was on a bicycle trip. Some 130 km in relatively flat terrain (the middle parts was in Nizky Jesenik mountain so ther e were some hills). A very nice trip except the strong headwind. Read more...\n\nModern WWW browsing on IRIX\n\n(August 2, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) You know, the SGI IRIX is dead at last from 2006 so there are almost no new apps. Definitely there is no \"current\" WWW browser (people have been trying hard but it seems to be impossible). The latest one is the Firefox 3.0.19 with ages old SSL suppurt (so almsot no https://). Read more...\n\nForgot to replace batteries\n\n(August 2, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) Some devices have very long battery live. So long so I usually forget that they are batteries at all. This time it was the PSION MC600. Read more...\n\nSpeed of computers\n\n(July 28, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I was in the Prague last week. I had only the GPD Pocket with me (an Item Atom-based machine). I did some light computing here (some FEA) and found that speed on my unoptimised software is still rather acceptable here. After return I tried to do the same on the MNT Reform. As expected the MNT was about 2 times slower (it has an industrial ARM CPU which is wasn't the fastest even when it was new). Read more...\n\nNew SIM, new phone\n\n(July 25, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) My Palm Centro decided to die. So I have had to replace it. Things have not been so easy because my old full-sized SIM (trimmed to the microSIM format anyway) do not fit any modern (or semi-modern) phone. Read more...\n\nWorking late\n\n(July 14, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) Well,it's summer and I am not able to do any creative work in my office where the lowest temperature is over 30 C. So I am working now at 22:00. Read more...\n\nSinclair A-Bike\n\n(July 12, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I once owned this thing 1. It was around 2008, I think. It was the second, updated model with larger (inflatable to 90 psi) wheels. Read more...\n\n(No) Old Computer Challenge\n\n(July 12, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I just have spent a nice half of hour by reading of other people' Old Computer Challenge Entries 1. Pretty interesting but some computer - while really old by today standards - dot's seem to be old to me. Read more...\n\nAgfa Click II\n\n(July 6, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I have got this old film camera. It wasn't expensive. Actually it is an interesting piece of German engineering. It's fairly simple, it's made mainly from plastic materials (including its faux leather case) yet if produces relatively nice images 1. Read more...\n\nStatus report\n\n(July 5, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I am actually writing this in July. Read more...\n\nAnalog challenge\n\n(July 5, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) Now I have to use a smartphone more often (as a remote control for some home equipment) so I have decided for a small challenge. Read more...\n\nStatus report\n\n(May 22, 2023 at 4:40 AM CEST) I have been a bit inactive here. There are several reasons: work (it is not going to improve, unfortunately), some personal stuff (we have been replacing the old heating system with a bit more modern one) and some illness. Read more...\n\n(April 18, 2023 at 4:41 AM CEST) I often save directories in *.tar.gz files. For some purposes I add the current date to the file name: Read more...\n\nSummer time again\n\n(March 30, 2023 at 4:41 AM CEST) Recently there was another time shift. This time it was from a winter time to the summer time (oops, too much mentions of \"time\" in just one sentence!) so we lost one hour of sleep. Read more...\n\nGave up TWTXT\n\n(March 27, 2023 at 4:41 AM CEST) After some time of trying I have decided that TWTXT is not for me. In its current form it shares many negatives of other social networks while almost nothing to offer (for me). Unlike the Gopher, it's useless on older computers (SSL is required for most people's files). Read more...\n\nNo computing on Sunday\n\n(March 20, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Almost, because this text is being written on a computer. Read more...\n\nNetBSD and SC\n\n(March 17, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) It seems that the NetBSD 9.3 has a modern (7.16) version of the sc(1), the console-only spreadsheet calculator. I was used to the older (6.22) release which was traditionally available in many \"classic\" UNIX systems like the IRIX (as was included in many linux distros, too). Read more...\n\nMNT Pocket Reform\n\n(March 17, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I noticed that the MNT Pocket Reform crowdfunding has been running for a few days 1. It already reached the funding goal but they are still open for further support. Read more...\n\nStuff changes\n\n(March 14, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) As I wrote some time ago I didn't planned to change or update by workflow nor my tools. But plans are usually not related to the reality. My Punkt MP01 ceased to work and I also have got the MNT Reform 2 laptop (which I thought it never arrive). Read more...\n\nLynx\n\n(March 14, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I am a bit curious who still uses the Lynx browser 1? I don't call it a \"WWW browser\" because it can do also the Gopher protocol (and does it very well). Read more...\n\nFilm Cameras\n\n(March 14, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Readers of my phlog probably know that I like to take pictures with strange old devices (like the Kodak PalmPix camera connected to my Palm III). Read more...\n\nSpring is here!\n\n(March 10, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Formally is is still winter (night temperatures are still often under zero degrees) but during daytime temperatures are going over 10C here and my spring allergy is back once more. Read more...\n\nDebian + Arduino IDE + Inkplate\n\n(March 7, 2023 at 4:25 PM CET) I wanted to be able to program my Inkplate 1 board from my MNT Reform. I have been using the GPD Pocket for this task but I have decided that my \"main laboratory device\" should be able to do the same. Read more...\n\nMNT Reform 2 summary (after few weeks)\n\n(February 19, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) The good Read more...\n\niMac G5 on WiFi\n\n(February 6, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I think I sometimes wrote here that I have had no luck with the Apple Airport cards. I ordered such thing several times but never received one. So I gave up. It is not a problem for most of my Apple machines as the PowerBook has such card from the beginning, the PowerCD don't need one and the Power Macintosh 6100 cannot accept one. Read more...\n\n(February 6, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I have decided that I want the battery status in the Waybar (a bar on the top of the screen). It wasn't that easy on the MNT: the battery status is controlled by the system controller (that thing which also communicates with you through the small OLED screen at the top of keyboard) and to be able to read the data inside the operating system a kernel driver is needed. Read more...\n\nMNT Reform 2 once more: RTC battery\n\n(January 24, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) My machine had some strange issues - it didn't remembered time after being powered off. This is a bit strange for a notebook which have also main battery but it worked this way. Read more...\n\nI use smartfone now!\n\n(January 24, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Readers of this phlog/blog probably know that I dislike smartphones. I used the Punks MP01 feature phone from 2017. Read more...\n\nMNT Reform 2, nm-tui and EDUROAM\n\n(January 20, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) The default OS of the Reform uses the \"nm-tui\" curses-based user interface for the NetworkManager. It makes sense because one can easily configure network access no matter if GUI (the Wayland) is running, working or installed at all. Read more...\n\nThinkpad longevity\n\n(January 18, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I just finished reading a post of The Sysops Tale Phlog 1. It's about upgrades of an old Thinkpad R60. I must say I like the old Thinkpad machines much. In my opinion the 60/61 line are the last machines which still have a strong IBM spirit. They are sturdy, practical machines with great keyboards. Still easily upgradable by today's standards (batteries are easy to remove, CPU/RAM/HDD relatively easy to replace and there are bays for swap-on drives/batteries in most of devices). Read more...\n\nMNT Reform: third round of impressions\n\n(January 18, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Well, the SSD drive died. I am not first with such issues so it might be just a bad serie of drives. Maybe some sort of incompatibility with the device. I have no idea. Read more...\n\nMNT Reform: second round of impressions\n\n(January 12, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) I have update the OS and the suspend no longer works. It seems to be a known problem (if I understand the matters there ware some changes in Linux kernel broke something - but it is not known what exactly was that something). Read more...\n\nFor first time in 2023\n\n(January 12, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) Today I did several thing for the first time in 2023: Read more...\n\nHardware overview 2022\n\n(January 5, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) What hardware I used in 2022? Read more...\n\nMNT Reform 2: first impressions\n\n(January 4, 2023 at 4:41 AM CET) After pretty long waiting and a lot of confusion I finally have got my MNT Reform 2 (youn know, the MNT Reform 1 was only a limited run of prototype machines). Read more...\n\nSharp Zaurus SL-C3200\n\n(December 25, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) These tiny notebooks are cute! I am writing this text on its keyboard. While the keyboard looks like a calculator one it is actually quite comfortable. Read more...\n\nDOS emulation on old UNIX systems\n\n(December 21, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I briefly noticed somewhere (I think it was on the RetroComputingForum 1) information about a very small ISP implementation which run even on the 8086 systems (among others) 2. Read more...\n\nOn Fedora 36\n\n(December 20, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) The Fedora 37 is already available, of course. Bu I was running the Fedora 35 until today. Read more...\n\nSGI Indigo R3k back in bussiness\n\n(December 18, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) There was a big surprise yesterday: a courier service delivered the new Tadiran-labelled 1 battery for my IRIS Indigo 2! The battery, of course, come from the Far East and not from the country you can expect from its name. Read more...\n\nFull POWER\n\n(December 18, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) AS you may know my main desktop workstation since about end of the 2019 is the Raptor Engineering Blackbird machine. The POWER9 (ppc64le) monster. It is obvous that I often don't need all its power (it's four-core, thus 16-thread machine with 32 GB of RAM). Read more...\n\nOvereaf + Git\n\n(December 15, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I am not a fan of on-line editors but they have some nice features. Concurrent work of several people, availability on devices where it is not easy to install the real thing and so on. Read more...\n\nBack to normal\n\n(December 15, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) A sort of... Read more...\n\nEnd of season\n\n(December 14, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) We have snow here (in Ostrava, Czechia). Actually a lot of snow after all these snow-less winters! I don't remember when there was snow before Christmas. Maybe around 2006? Read more...\n\nMore on social networks\n\n(December 3, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) As I wrote here last time, I deleted my Mastodon account. Some nice people 1 have invited me to try the twtxt 2. But I am not sure if I actually want to join an another such network. Even if it is decentralized and far from overcrowded. Read more...\n\nMastodon account deleted\n\n(December 1, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I have deleted my Mastodon account at 1. Read more...\n\nUbuntu Touch OTA-24\n\n(November 30, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) The update is here, it installs without issues and seems to work well on both the Aqyaris E4.5 phone and the Aqyaris M10 tablet (both were from the late BQ company). Read more...\n\nGopher and social networks\n\n(November 30, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) As many people noticed there has been influx of Mastodon users because they have been leaving some other so called social network. This has several consequences. Some of them are positive and some of them negative. Read more...\n\nFolding bicycles\n\n(November 30, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Just finished reading of guofu's post about the Strida. I must say that it is very interesting. I never used such thing but the post is inspiring. Read more...\n\n(November 24, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I have updated my wannabe work machine (the Lenovo x61s which now serves as my only Linux box at work because the work machine is Windows-only). It runs Ubuntu LTS for ages. I upgraded it to the latest LTS with naive hopes that it solves some of its minor issues. Read more...\n\nOn the IRIX again\n\n(October 26, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) After somewhat long pause I am sitting a front of my SGI O2. There has been a chain of works in our house which is not finished, yet. So a lot of stuff was carefully covered and put to safe places and thus it has been unavailable. Read more...\n\nBatteries, again\n\n(October 26, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I finally have found and installed my 9V battery charger again. Almost all of my Organiser IIs are out of juice so I am going to retun them to life. Read more...\n\nBQ Aquaris battery\n\n(October 19, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have received and installed the new battery into my BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition. This is a relatively old device (for a smartphone). It was released in early 2015, I think. Mine was somewhat damaged by the swelling battery (at least it's my theory which should explain why the touchscreen has some issues). Read more...\n\nSmartphone vs card vs paper\n\n(October 13, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I travelled by train today. I had the ticket in 3 forms: as a printed ticked, as a plastic card (which should be paired with my account) and as a smartphone app. Read more...\n\nROOPHLOCH failure\n\n(September 30, 2022 at 4:44 AM CEST) Well, I almost forgot about the RROOPHLOCH 1! Today is September 29th so it is one of the last days to do something. Read more...\n\nWhere thing works\n\n(September 21, 2022 at 4:43 AM CEST) After the summer break (caused by travelling and then some works at home) I am finally able to turn on my SGI O2. This was my main desktop for many years and I still feel home here. No matter that my Blackbird (the OpenPOWER machine from 2018) is many times faster. I still thing that my FVWM environment and the IRIX tools are more comfy.

It is of the \"HSABAT\" brand (I have no idea what company it is but it seems they made many types of batteries for many niche devices). Read more...\n\nTrain journey with smartphone only\n\n(August 31, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I was in the France last week. There was a work related event (a conference). I \"normally\" travel by plane to those events. Actually, I have not travelled by plane from 2019 and actually I flew 4 four times in last 10 years. Read more...\n\nMakefile and .SUFFIXES\n\n(August 16, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) For some reasons I never tried to use the .SUFFIXES directive of the make(1). I also thought that it is a GNU extension which may not exist in other make implementations. Read more...\n\nGPD Pocket battery continued\n\n(August 16, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) The battery cover popped up yesterdays. Actually, I was trying if the GPD works on a more powerful power supply (on the GPD-branded one). It did until this accident happened. Read more...\n\nVacation\n\n(August 13, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I was on vacation in the first fart of August. It was in relative remote region of the nearby country and I had no actual computer with me so there was no phlog post for some time. Read more...\n\nTeX, LaTeX, tool and compatibility\n\n(August 13, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Some 20 years ago it was advertised to me that one of the main advantages of the LaTeX is its backward compatibility. It was in times when MS office package documents broke after transfer between different computers and new file format versions introduced new problems. Actually, I was the Linux/UNIX user from about 1998 so the DOC/XLS/PPT documents were almost useless for me anyway. Read more...\n\nComputers, workflow, calendars\n\n(August 13, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I am thinking about updating my current computer setup. I don't mean that I need newer/faster/cooler stuff but a better compatibility between my devices cannot hurt. Also, there have been some issues with my devices which I should address. Read more...\n\nJuly report\n\n(August 1, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) This July was a bit strange. I had some health problems at the end of June and they continued in the first half of July. I thing it was mostly related to my overworking during the May/June period at my work Read more...\n\nSlow Phone\n\n(July 9, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) The Free Thinker managed managed to disassemble the phone 1 to find out if it is actually slower than my early 1990s SGI IRIS Indigo workstation 2. I really recommend the post 1 to all interested readers - it's very interesting. Read more...\n\nSunday mix of texts (health, bikes, computers)\n\n(July 5, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Inevitable happened: combination of hot weather, stress at work before the end of June and other minor things have derailed me. I am exhausted, experiencing some minor health problems and so. Read more...\n\nTelnet, DISPLAY and other 1990s memories\n\n(June 16, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have played with my Apple IIe Enhanced today. The machine is (among others) equipped with the Uthernet board so it can be connected to a computer network. I did some stuff here but then I have realised I need to do some work on my SGI O2 (because no one can run OpenGL programs on the Apple II). So I have turned on my SGI O2 and have decided to use the Apple IIe as a remote console for some moments. Read more...\n\nStrange stuff (UC-2000)\n\n(June 16, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I wrote recently here 1 that I have got the Seiko DATA 2000 smartwatch. This thing is very interesting and quite useful, too. Anyway, just one alarm and no way to sync data with ane desktop computer (except for re-typing of them manually) have made me curious if there is anything more enhanced. Read more...\n\nSeiko DATA-2000\n\n(June 8, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) After long decision process I finally have got the DATA-2000 smartwatch (just like these ones 1, sans the manual). Well, it's a device from 1980s so they are not as \"smart\" as modern things called \"smartwatch\". Read more...\n\nUbuntu Touch, GPRS, HotSpot\n\n(June 1, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) As I don't have the regular internet connection now (and this situation seems to remain unchanged for some time) a wanted to try a setup for situations when some sort of such connections will be necessary. You know, sometimes it is needed to send an e-mail or two and so on. Read more...\n\nNew bike (another one)\n\n(June 1, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have found an interesting bike at one of popular social networks. The Velamos MTB from 1989. A solid, steel, bike with combination of original eastern (Czechoslovak) parts and some Western components (the derraileurs, for example). The color is an odd combination of a metallic blue and white. But it was probably fashionable color scheme in late 1980s. These were crazy times, you remember... Read more...\n\nOff-line once more\n\n(May 31, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Our home internet connection is dead again. This time it seems to be a more serious issue: our provider was bought by an another company. Read more...\n\nMC400 or MC600\n\n(May 31, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Note: this post was written some time ago. I just forgot to upload it. Read more...\n\nSGI, demos and such\n\n(May 19, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have started something that I call \"no-POWER challenge\". That is, I am have been trying not to turn on my main home computer at all. It's the OpenPOWER machine thus \"no-POWER\" is what I am have been trying to accomplish. Read more...\n\nPocket Gopher\n\n(May 11, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) How do you read gopher posts on your favorite pocked device? I (sometimes) use the BQ Aquaris E4.5 phone (with the UbPorts/Ubuntu Touch) which has a ge,ini/gopher client. It's somewhat slower but it mostly works. Read more...\n\nNostalgia?\n\n(April 30, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) There are many people who like to use (and thus repair or enhance) old computers. I am doing so, by the way. But it seems that people generally like other old things, too. Read more...\n\nOn Indigo again\n\n(April 25, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I am running my Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo R3000 once again. There was some failure in the past so today it is a sort of test. Read more...\n\nHolidays biking\n\n(April 23, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) We decided to spent Easters time in a quiet spot in mountains. We selected a place at the edge of Jeseniky mountains in anticipation that there will be limited amount of other tourists. Read more...\n\nPalm IIIx battery saga continues\n\n(April 11, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I tried to replace the batteries yesterday. As you might know this machine behaves unusually during this operation. So I was curious what will happen this time. Read more...\n\nBatteries (Org II)\n\n(April 11, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I may be mistaken but it seems to me that I have to re-charge the battery in my Organiser II too often. It seems that the battery life of this device is now less than month of light use! Just two alarms every day and few minutes of use two or three times per week. Read more...\n\n100km per week\n\n(April 11, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) For the first time this year - and probably for the first time in years - I was able to cycle more than 100 km in one week. It is not much, I know. There were times when I was able to do over 180 km in one day (including climbing to the highest mountain in local area) but these times are long gone. For many years I was able to cycle 100-300 km PER YEAR. In 2021 it was under 2000 km. Read more...\n\na2ps\n\n(April 1, 2022 at 4:43 AM CEST) Anyone still use the a2ps(1) utility? I was in need to print some formatted C source codes and tried to find some hard ways to go. Then I have remembered that there must me something simple which I used in the dark past. Read more...\n\nNo Esc on keyboard\n\n(March 31, 2022 at 4:42 AM CEST) I (well, just sometimes) use my Ubuntu Touch Tablet (the BQ Aquaris M10) wit a BOOX keyboard. This keyboard is not bad: its keys have some mechanical feedback, the labels are well readable and it even has a stand compatible with the M10. So I can use these two devices in a laptop-like setup. Read more...\n\nWinter/summer time change again\n\n(March 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Just a list of my device which can manage it by themselves (and which cannot): Read more...\n\nPortable Digital Assistants\n\n(March 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) Now I am in situation when I use desktop computer both at home and at work and all my work-related moves are in the line between those two places. There are little meetings and so. Read more...\n\nOn SGI again\n\n(March 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have been using my SGI machines so infrequently so every time I boot one I also wrote a phlog post... Read more...\n\nLinux @work\n\n(March 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) After many years long break I have started to use the Linux at work. I use the Lenovo x61s connected to the 24\" screen and to the shared keyboard and mouse (I have got a modern 12-core AMD box as my main computer recently, it has to run Windows, of course). Read more...\n\nLa Rosta\n\n(March 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CEST) As a result of of my purchases at the BandCamp I was once contacted by this group. They offered me that I can support them at an Italian crowdfunding portal. For some reasons which are unclear even for me, I did. Read more...\n\nNot enough RAM\n\n(March 17, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Just experienced the OOM Killer at work. On my OpenPOWER with 342 GB of RAM and 16 GB of swap space. My own program (a 16 years old C code designed with small data sets in mind) ate all that space. It seems that it is rather due its poor design that there is actually so high demand for data space... Read more...\n\nSGI O2 in 2022\n\n(March 10, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I am still using my SGI O2. But not often. Once it was my main home workstation (2005-2018) but now I have an OpenPOWER workstation (the Raptor Blackbird) for most of tasks. Read more...\n\nNight cycling\n\n(March 8, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I was in Prague last week for work reasons. Read more...\n\nClosed\n\n(March 1, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Just a notice: I closed my Twitter account @jurabr6. At the moment I think that the Mastodon account is more than enough. Read more...\n\nBiking uphill\n\n(February 28, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I have decided that I have to start to cycle more and especially I have to have improve my abilities to cycle uphill. There is a relatively nice road from my office to the nearest hill. The cycle.travel 1 says that one way is 4.4 km with 150 m of ascent (max 11.5%; the main part of such ascent is on the last 1 km) and some 50 m of descend. The way back is easier of course. I should repeat is at least once a week until I will able to reach the top of the hill without any stops... Read more...\n\nPalm IIIx batteries change\n\n(February 17, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) As I mentioned before I have returned to use of my Palm IIIx. Everything goes well except one thing. When I replace batteries for the first time (I use a pair of AAA rechargeable ones) then the device shut down and emtied its RAM completely. I had to use my backup to restore it. Read more...\n\nApple IIe adventures\n\n(February 17, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) You might know that I am not an Apple fan. I have no problem with closed systems - I have been an SGI user for ages. Anyway I have not found too much parts of Apple philosophy too bad for me. Read more...\n\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS\n\n(February 16, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I was a bit unsure if I want to use a slowly expiring release of the Ubuntu (10.04 - it's 2022 already) so I have decided to upgrade in to 20.04 as it should provide two more years of support. Read more...\n\ntodo.txt\n\n(February 15, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I still use this thing. But recently I have realised that I have the common To Do issue - I have been accumulating tasks to do without actual will to do them. Read more...\n\nWeekend without computing\n\n(February 15, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) At Saturday we did a short trip in mountains to test our new snow shoes. These are great things! They make possible to move so easily in sloped snowy terrain! Read more...\n\nUbuntu 18.04\n\n(February 9, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Today I updated one of my work machines to the Ubunt 18.04 LTS. Most probably I will have to update it to the 20.04 at least but Ubuntu updates have to be done in steps. Read more...\n\nHeadwind\n\n(February 7, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Today I sort of repaired my old roadster bike. The single-speed Czechoslovak bike made by the Velamos company in the second half of the 20th century. It is well used and I already replaced many parts. Read more...\n\nNew screen for IIe\n\n(February 5, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Just have got the ReActiveMicro 1 LCD o Apple II computers. Nothing fancy - it is a basic 12\" LCD with many inputs. But it is tuned to work well with Apple II machines. It is much better than my generic LCD TV. Read more...\n\nPalm IIIx revival\n\n(January 22, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Once more I have started to use my old good Palm IIIx on semi-regular basis. I have better devices but I have some strange issues when doing backups on my TRGpro so I have decided to use the IIIx instead. I still use the TrĂŠo 90 at work but not so often. Read more...\n\nOne Palm is enough\n\n(January 22, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I decided I should simplify my setup. I use 4 (four!) now: the IIIx, the TRGpro, the Treo 90 and the Centro. The initial idea was to have one Palm III for home use, one Palm use at work and the Centro as an outdoor phone (with possibility to work as a spare PDA/camera). Read more...\n\nDynamo, finally\n\n(January 22, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Today I finished installation of dynamo light on my Favorit bike. Cable routing is not as nice as I wished but I wasn't able to do it better. Read more...\n\nDynamo lighting\n\n(January 8, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I have been using battery-based lights since my return to cycling (in 2003, i think). Yes, my first bike ever (the Czechoslovak Sobi 20) had the dynamo. But if was in the 1980 and I was a child in these times. When I got my first \"real\" bike the dynamos were out of fashion. Read more...\n\nWWW browser for 8086\n\n(January 5, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) This sounds as a crazy idea but such thing 1 really exists! It has been written for Intel 8088-compatible machines. If you remember, the NEC 8088-compatible CPUs were quite common in portable and handheld computers of early 1990s (the HP 95LX to the 200LX, for example). Read more...\n\nYear 2021: geocaching\n\n(January 3, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) I found 5 (five) geocaches. It is really not that much but it is better than the 2020 (just 3).

In the \"camera\" role I used these device (in this order): Read more...\n\nCleanup\n\n(January 3, 2022 at 4:41 AM CET) Well, no really. I have been trying to tidy my desk but with little success. Read more...\n\nSGI in use\n\n(December 22, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) I have been cleaning/updating and organising my PDAs. I have found that I have not backed up my (once primary) Palm IIIx! So I have been setting it up in the proper way, loading current data and saving it on the SGI O2. Read more...\n\nShared bikes\n\n(December 11, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) I have found that these shared bikes are not for me. They are not available where (and when) I need them. They require a smartphone with a dedicated app to use them. Moreover, data connection is required (they tend to place bikes in areas with no free WiFi nor the EDUROAM). Read more...\n\nOff-line\n\n(December 11, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) At home I am now off-line. At the moment I don/t know the problem but my Internet connection just do not work. It might be a problem with current snow situation or something else. I will wait for a few days and then will urge my provider (it usually helps not to be to angry..). Read more...\n\nOld SSH troubles\n\n(December 6, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) I just have noticed that after the SDF updated their SSH servers (which is a good thing as security is important these days) I am no longer able to connect from my OS X Leopard notebook. It should be OK as the Leopard is old and most of software for it is old, too. Read more...\n\nFlat batteries\n\n(December 6, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) For the third time in four weeks I forgot to replace batteries (a pair of AAA rechargeables) in my TRGpro Palm handheld. So I have had to restore it in backup for the third time. You know, this device has just RAM so loss of power means loss of everything. Read more...\n\nMNT Reform keyboard\n\n(December 3, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) I have bought the MNT Reform keyboard 1. I might got the MNT Reform laptop itself so I have wanted to be prepared. Read more...\n\nChanging habits\n\n(December 3, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) I have noticed that I started to use a bike for my daily commuting (instead of walking), almost have ceased to used a Palm and stopped to use a SGI on weekends. That's strange. Read more...\n\nNoViCoGE on IIe\n\n(November 23, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) As Logout proposed I am now writing his post on my Apple IIe. Actually, I am connected to the Gopher telnet with us of IP65 telnet program. Read more...\n\nSSL again\n\n(November 15, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) More and more sites tends to cot of older algorithms in SSL. So my Links on the SGI O2 is able to open less and less web sites. Read more...\n\nFrom 33 to 35\n\n(November 9, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) Just upgraded my Fedora/ppc64le from 33 to the 35. So far so good (I noticed no changes except higher version numbers, actually). Read more...\n\nNot so NoViCoGE\n\n(October 31, 2021 at 4:41 AM CET) After reading Logout's post 1 I have decided to write a gopher post on my SGI O2. So I have connected to the SDF server, have fired up the Vim and now I am writing this text. Read more...\n\nPSIONs talking\n\n(October 20, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have the PSION Organiser II (actually, more than one as the reader might know). I also have the PSION MC600. The MC600 is a nice old-school laptop which runs MS-DOS 3.3. Thus it can be used - among others - for development of OPL codes to Organisers II. This is actually one of main reasons why I keep this machine ready with charged batteries. Read more...\n\nSo long TenFourFox\n\n(October 18, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) So the TenFourFox is (almost) gone 1. I will never understand how Cameron was able to develop it so long. But he did. And the TenFourFox was always unbelievably fast (I used other ports and clones of Firefox on other older platforms and they were always much more slower. Actually, it's still my main WWW browser on my Powerbook G4 (a machine I use when I don't wan to turn on any of my workstations). It still work in most of situations. Read more...\n\nSCSI troubles\n\n(October 18, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have bought a new external floppy drive. The one in the SGI granite case. It has the 50-pin SCSI connectors, of course. So I thought taht it will be easy to connect it to my SGI workstation... Read more...\n\nNew CommsLink cable\n\n(October 7, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have bought a new communication cable for my PSION Organiser II. It seems to be a custom-made thing: it has very short elastic part and the PC end is the 9-pin serial connector (usual cables have 25-pin ones). Read more...\n\n(October 7, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) Weather was still good at Saturday so I was able to do a short (14 km) ride. I decided to use my single-speed Velamos bike (a 1960s thing). It has updated recently: I have replaced the Brooks B17 saddle with the more matching Stadion one (a Czechoslovak leather saddle without springs). The B17 will be used with a more modern bike. I also replaced the chain, fixed the pedals and so. However, I did not have new 635-40 tyres so there still have been installed the old good Barum ones of the Czechoslovak vintage. They are at least 40 years old now. As they already caused some inner tubes defects they are going to be replaced. But until the new ones (of the Czech brand Mitas) arrive I have to use the old ones. Read more...\n\nO2 RAM upgrade\n\n(September 27, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) I am in the middle of testing of my RAM moduli the Silicon Graphics O2 system. Once I had the whole 1 GB of RAM in my O2 (8 x 128MB). Then something failed and I ended with just 256MB (2x 128MB). Read more...\n\nNo POWER today\n\n(September 27, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) I have decided that I will not torture my Raptor Blackbird system this weekend. I have had no plan to do any serious stuff so I have seen no point in running a 3GHz POWER9 system just to run the Firefox. Read more...\n\nSinclair\n\n(September 20, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) Just read that Sir Clive passed away. So I turned on my Cambridge Z88 to commemorate one of his last achievements (it is his last computer, isn't it?). Read more...\n\nBQ\n\n(September 20, 2021 at 4:41 AM CEST) The BQ is gone 1. That's the company which made the Ubuntu Touch devices (a couple of phones and a tablet). There are already old and abandoned (the Canonical ceased the Ubuntu Touch years ago) but the devices have been well-done, durable and useful. They were a bit expensive for their specs but it was not a problem as there were almost no other Ubuntu Touch devices. When the Ubuntu Touch was ended the BQ continued to made Android phones. I assume that they were not competitive as a small European company (even if it made their phones in China) was not able to offer attractive prices. Read more...\n\nSGI O2 in August\n\n(September 1, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) Yes, I still use it. After some problems I have a machine with just 256 MB of RAM but with working clock chip. Among others I use it for file exchange with the PSION MC600. Read more...\n\nPSIONs: MC600 and Org2\n\n(September 1, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) The MC 600 is a nice laptop with a passive LCD and a great keyboard. IT also runs the MS DOS 3.3. It means that it can run PSION's ORG2 IDE (that is, the integrated development environment for the Organiser II with a debugger and the emulator). Read more...\n\nKermit and 200LX\n\n(September 1, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) For very long I have known that the old DOS-bast HP palmtops can use the Kermit 1 protocol. But I never tried to use it before. I have had several computers with serial port and I also have had the serial cable for 95/100/1000/200LX machines (with an adapter for some HP calculators). Read more...\n\nHolidays\n\n(September 1, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) This year I made no progress in my computing. I have installed the new Corona app on my Ubuntu touch devices (it is much better than the official Czech one). This is a sort of big progress because it is for the first time when I do not need an Android device for government e-services. Read more...\n\nDOS vs SIBO\n\n(September 1, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) My Psion SSD disk (a RAM-type one) had some issues. The RAM one uses a backup battery (the CR1620) and it died so all data on the disk were lost. Read more...\n\n[Testing the \"new\" PSION MC400 |20210821-0240_Testing_the_new_PSION_MC400]\n\n(August 21, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Note: I wrote this text mostly during my testing of the new MC400 keyboard. So it might made no sense - there are just some rando0m words and sentences... Read more...\n\nPSION Series 3 Spell Checker\n\n(August 21, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Yesterday I have got a parcel with a \"Spell Checker and Thesaurus for PSION Series 3\" on a PSION SSD card. It also have included the manual. Read more...\n\nRunning O2\n\n(July 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) As my Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo 1 have had power supply issues I have had to return to my SGI O2 2. There is still the RAM issue to be solved (at the moment I had only some 256 MB of RAM available; I had 1024 MB before the failure) so some things are somewhat constrained for now. Especially the Links web browser uses too much RAM if WWW pages have images. And the Firefox uses too much RAM all the time. Read more...\n\n[\"New\" PSION MC400 |20210726-0240_New_PSION_MC400]\n\n(July 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) The MC400 arrived today. It seems to be just slightly used. Of course, the battery block has the lock piece teared off (as it is common on these devices) and the handle/stand thing is missing. Aside o that the only things which I can comply about are two or three darker places on the LCD (they look like thumb traces). Read more...\n\nGemini PDA (re:RPoD)\n\n(July 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) I just read the RPoD Phlog 1 about his Gemini PDA device. I also have this thing but I use it very infrequently. In general it is better than the old PSION geeks think but it is not as good as I need. The screen is excellent and the keyboard is not bad but the hinges are terrible (the whole thing moves when I type on the keyboard and I am not able to accustom to it). Also the original Gemini PDA (especially my WiFi-only model) is long abandoned by the producer. Yes, they still sell it but they don't update nor patch its Android system. In theory I can replace it by the SailFish OS but it would mean loss of ability to run Android program (the SailFish for the Gemini PDA does not have this feature). Also the rear camera is terrible. It produces ugly pictures and it has problems with QR code reading (the QR codes are the main reason why I have installed such thing on my Gemini - it looks much better without the rear camera).

One of the exception is the Doom. I was actually able to finish the demo WAD but never wanted to continue.

But it seems that it is a rather nice music player with a clean interface. It also supports many file formats. It is already available in some Linux distros (including the Fedora/ppc64le!).

Well, surfing the WWW and reading e-mails in an browser-based client, too. And I'm going to connect my PSION MC600 via serial port to transfer files which I created on that laptop. Read more...\n\nBikes\n\n(July 16, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) After long, dark, years I have been starting to use bicycles a bit. This year I have bought the Brompton folding bikes (the 6-speed models) for both me and my wife. It have made possible for us to reach relatively distant places (like shops in 9 km distance) without use of car or of some sort of public transport. We even made some longer trips in the Krusberk dam area (a remote and deserted area by local standards). OF course, I have been using the Brompton to commute to work. Read more...\n\n.plan\n\n(July 6, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) Just out of curiosity I have tried to \"finger\" all on-line S.D.F. users. It seems that I am the only one who uses (or exposes to public) the .plan file. Read more...\n\nToo much e-mails\n\n(July 6, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) Today I have found eigh unread e-mails in my S.D.F. 1 mailbox. Well, I'm used to get some 100+ work e-mails daily. But this is a different case: in the S.D.F. mailbox there are no spams, no scams, no reports, reviews, requests nor any other headache-making stuff. If there is a single e-mail per week it means that my mailbox is pretty busy. I use the mail(1) client here because it is fully sufficient for this intensity of use. Read more...\n\nSummary of June\n\n(July 6, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) There was too much work in June. I'm working at an university and there were exams from mid-May to the first days of July. In the COVID times there were on-line sessions: 30 minutes per student, 12 students per day. All in temperatures over 30 degrees of Celsius (our modern building is hot even when outside temperature is quite moderate). In the days without exams I was trying to do the rest of work. In short, I was (and still I am) too exhausted to do anything else. Read more...\n\nXTerm: Shift+Insert\n\n(June 21, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) There is always something which I don't know. For example, I never realised that I can paste stuff to the X Terminal Emulator by using something different than middle button of my mouse. Read more...\n\nNothing special to report\n\n(June 14, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Nothing special happened from the time of my previous post. I have got a pair of old Handspring Treo devices (a 90 and the 180) but I had not time to familiarise with them. The only thing I can say is that both somewhat work (no one is in perfect condition, of course). The plan is to stop taking my TRGpro here and there and use the Treo 90 instead. The precise TRG should be used at home and go outside only on special occasions (that means when I will be in mood to take pictures with the snap-on KODAK PalmPix camera). But this still just a plan. Read more...\n\nBlackBird usage during lockdown\n\n(June 14, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Many people have had to change their modes of work during the lockdown and the \"home office preferred\" time. Actually, I was in my office near as often as I should be normally because I wasn't able to to a lot of things remotely. Anyway, I have found that I have been working at home (thus I have been working more hours than before - but I don;t thing that I has been more productive). Read more...\n\nX11 degradation\n\n(June 1, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) I remember times when I was able to run complex X11 applications (including a commercial FEA package) remotely on my Linux or IRIX desktop. The IRIX case was quite insane one: my old Linux laptop (a Pentium at 90MHz with small RAM and with the XFree86) was connected via SSH and VPN to the remote server and the IRIX box (for a long time it was the SGI Indy with R4400 CPU at 175 MHz) was connected via SSH to that laptop. But that worked. Read more...\n\nWhy I have to keep i386\n\n(June 1, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) As you may know I don't use x86 if it is not necessary. My PDA is the m68k, my desktop was the MIPS and now it has the POWER. But I always have had to at least one x86-compatible box. For a long time it was my Toshiba 110CT laptop then there ware other boxes and now it's the GPD Pocket.

I still have them and they are in working condition (except the N810 which died few years ago). I have bought the 770 as a new device but the others are second (third?) hand devices.

That box (the PDP-11/84) runs a Gopher server (written in BASIC!) and offers an anonymous Telnet access to its RT-11 environment. I already have seen a working RT-1 box (albeit at has been a stripped-down Russian clone one - the UKNC school computer) but this German site runs the real thing with FOUR Megabytes of RAM (my tiny UKNC has 65 kB). Thus the PDP runs the multi-user version of the RT-11 with many advanced features available.

It is now very cheap and available everywhere (the 1 has it for too big amount of money, just search for other sellers to see how cheap it actually is). I think that iPad users found it to be too ugly for their devices so only a few people actually got it. Yes, its white-gray plastics with some transparent parts and its shape makes it look as a thing from dark past (aesthetically it fits to mid 1990s I think).

It was the SL-C3200 (that fat one with the real HDD). While it is the most powerful Zaurus in existence it is also the heaviest one and its HDD (while offering benefits like large spece for files and the swap area) has obvious impact on battery life. My device also has loose screen hinges which makes its use less comfortable.

But from time to time I need to write an article with some references. Thus I need to use something like the BibTeX. And I have been thinking that a possibility to download the pre-generated BibTeX files from major (commercial) services like the Scopus or the ScienceDirect is a great help. Read more...\n\nFloppy on Mac\n\n(May 3, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) At the moment I am copying some files from my Apple PowerBook G4 to the 3.5\" floppy media. I use an external USB floppy drive (it is labelled as the \"SONY\" but it identifies as something strange; it work very well anyway). The OS X shows nice diskette icon for this device (the IRIX icon is better, though). Read more...\n\nZ88 to PC\n\n(May 2, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) The Cambridge Z88 has a (normal, 9-pin) serial port thus communication with it should be easy. It is not. It is quite easy to use its Import/Export functionality against a good terminal program like the Minicom. In such case one is limited to plain text files (no formatting, no PipeDream files and so on). Read more...\n\nBrompton bikes\n\n(May 2, 2021 at 2:41 AM CEST) After a string of unfortunate issues we finally have a pair of the Brompton folding bikes (one for my wife and one for me). I exchanged my black one (which was not available because of a COVID, the Brexit and so on) for a black edition (so even more black) one. It looks great with the Brooks leather saddle and the pair of matching (but locally produced) grips. But I was told that the saddle is obviously too uncomfortable ;-) I have no problem with it, by the way. I was a bit shocked how my tyres look. For my wife I have got the basic Schwalbe Marathon ones. They are actually fine and work well. But for my one I selected the more expensive Schwalbe Kojak. They are actually great, especially on roads but they really look as the head of Inspector Kojak...

I also tried to review the devices I use (less or more) actively. Among others there were Psion Organiser II devices.

There are some non-trivial dependencies: the Gtk+ 1.2, the GtkGLArea and so on. These things are not so easy to set up on the IRIX 5.x but finally it works. Read more...\n\nSome BASIC programming\n\n(April 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) I have learned that I need to de some simple computation very often. I have a programmable calculator but I decided to write them in BASIC. Read more...\n\nOutage\n\n(April 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Well, not really. Just a break enforced by my health. Posts will be limited until the end of this month (at least). It looks like the lockdown combined with bad weather and with a lot of work was too much for me. Read more...\n\nElektronika UKNC\n\n(April 26, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) Note: This post was written some time ago (it is actually older than my recent UKNC-related posts 1 and 2).

I have not tried this S.D.F. PiDP-8 2, yet. But it seems to be very interesting. Read more...\n\nSaturday\n\n(April 19, 2021 at 2:40 AM CEST) The first trip after the lockdown.

My tea (I am glad it ran out and I have had to drink a \"Russian\" one again - even if its from the same Sri Lanka as the British one). The Z88 and the Psion II. The umbrella (\"designed in Britain ... made in PRC\". And the bike is from London (a Brompton folding bike), too. This is a little too much for the EU citizen, isn't it?

Simplicity is (sometimes) the ultimate sophistication, you know. For example: to add a new item to the main menu (a link to a custom OPL program or to a notes file) it is enough to press a <Mode> key a enter tits name (and then to press the <Enter>, of course).

Thus I already added a Brompton back light (there was none), have got a compatible Metro backpack (can be attached to the front holder), added a leather tool bag under the seat, installed some protectors and so on. Nox I am searching for an opiginal front light (unlike the bask one, which exists in AA-powered version the front one has build-in battery). But if its build quality will be similar to that back one then it would make sense to use it instead of the cheap light which we use for now...

Cameron plans to made some TenFourFox security updates for some time but the Classilla is finished.

With the QuickEdit program (of the SpellMaster package) it is quite good for English texts (it has a spell-checker build in). Yes, I am aware of the PipeDream but this program is lighter and easier to use. I of course, use the PipeDream for tables and computations. But for writing of Gopher posts a lighter application is more appropriate.Then only issue is that the spell checker is turned off by default and I often forgot to turn it on. I still have to fix the syncing of the Z88 with my desktop: i still use the sent/receive functionality and the minicom on the Linux which is very limiting (no binary files upload/download).

It is my wife's bike but I'm have been using if, too (at least until by own Brompton will arrive from the UK). We have decided to buy a basic (non-titanium, non-electric) version of the bike because of cost and serviceability concerns.Thus at the moment we have a H6R one in the \"Papyrus White/Black\" color combination. It looks good (much better than I expected from product pictures, actually). I have added some lights here (a Brompton back light and a cheap front one - it will be here until I will get a better one) and some small protectors. We also have decided that it will be nice to have a main frame protection so have got a leather cover for the main tube from the Souma 2. Well, it have had to be knitted!But we finished this procedure on Saturday (it was easier than I anticipated and the Souma provided us with a link to video manual). Read more...\n\nCSTUG Saturdays\n\n(March 26, 2021 at 3:41 AM CET) I attended a CSTUG (the Czech-Slovak TeX User Group) meeting some time ago. It was on-line for the first time so it was easy to attend. There was a presentation about the Czech Mathematics Library 1 but many other interesting things were also mentioned. I was aware that there is a thing called the Overleaf 2 which is the on-line LaTeX editor/compiler. It allows several people to collaborate on a document just as other office packages do. The difference is that this one uses the LaTeX. Of course, this is a paid service (some $100 for one-year access with github storage and other add-on functions) but for small projects there is a limited access. Read more...\n\nIndigo + floppy\n\n(March 24, 2021 at 3:41 AM CET) One of the important technologies of early (and is some countries also late) 1990s was the 3.5\" floppy drive. It was a technology from second half of 1980s. For me it was the only way to move data between computers for very long time (I ceased to use it as a main media for file transfer somewhat between 2003 and 2005). I even made my slides for lectures with use of the LaTeX and the XFig because vector images (EPS files produced by the XFig) were very small and the final document produced by the LaTeX was small, too. Each of my presentations from that time (1999-2005) was under 1.4 MB just because I needed to put in on a floppy disk (I had a ZIP drive from 2004, too but I still wanted to hae small files - just for the case).

SO I still cannot install the TeX, the GNu Octave and so on.

Not only it is possible to install some X11 apps and use them (still with some limitations and glitches) but it is also possible to run normal command-line stuff in the default terminal (so no problems with virtual keyboard for X11 apps, no strange UI crashes, just the old good terminal).

In the dark past (in 1990 or 1991) I had a Czechoslovak MATO home computer. A Sinclair clone, I think. I had no memory device during that time so I had little use for it. After that I had no such thing. My computers have been alt least 16-bit. Read more...\n\nFirst bike ride this year\n\n(March 13, 2021 at 3:41 AM CET) I have got a new bicycle: the Brompton H6R.

When attached the bag is very stable. There are no vibration nor other similar problems.

The same stuff can be used on a smartphone. But was there something like that available during late 1980s? It was. For example, there was a spreadsheet and the word processor for the PSION Organiser II. They were called the PSION Spreadsheet and the AutoScribe Plus. They were quite powerful for their time.

I have removed an (almost unused) card from the lower PCIe slot to make more space around graphics card heatsink and to assure better air flow. The difference is small (gfx card temperature is now 65 degrees of Celsius for most of time; if was abou 67-68 in idle before).

The pre-boot diagnostics does not see that device (a SSD). The second SSD (with data) and the DVD drive are both visible. It happened just before I came home. I turned off the computer and then remembered that I forgot to do something. So I turned it on and this thing happened. No tech support was available at that time.

I decided to use the SGI Indigo instead of my BlackBird or the PowerBook or of some of tablets which are lying around. It seems that it was good decision: I was able to read much more than usually. The machine ran some crazy computations in background and I was reading...

Read more...\n\nBlackbird upgrade\n\n(December 22, 2020 at 3:41 AM CET) I have upgraded my Raptor CS BlackBird workstation (that OpenPOWER thing, you know). I have installed a second-hand AMD Radeon HD 5450 graphics board. Read more...\n\nTemperature conversion\n\n(December 20, 2020 at 3:41 AM CET) American people tend to use Fahrenheits in online recipes. Our owen, however, uses degrees of Celsius. So my wife often asks me to convert these units QUICKLY. And as you may know the units(1) does not include this particular conversion. Read more...\n\nDowntime\n\n(December 20, 2020 at 3:41 AM CET) It seems that I didnt't started my PowerBook G4 for more than two week! The battery was on 84% (not bat for the cheap replacement battery, I think) but the RSS reader shows tens of unread articles.. Read more...\n\n9front KerTeX\n\n(December 15, 2020 at 3:41 AM CET) Just installing on my native 9front... It's MUCH faster than it was in the QEMU. Read more...\n\nreMarkable 2 in use\n\n(December 14, 2020 at 3:41 AM CET) I have started to use the reMarkable e-paper tablet on regular basis. I use it to read documents, atricles and books in PDF and to prepare article review because I can easily highlight errors and make notes to the documents. Read more...\n\nNew round of Apple IIe attempts\n\n(December 13, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) Long story short: I read somewhere that if something does not work on the Apple computer then it is always recommended to get a new one. I am an Apple user so I followed the recommendation. And it worked. Read more...\n\n9front audio\n\n(December 9, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) An another level was reached: my x60 can play music! Read more...\n\n9front on bare metal\n\n(December 8, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I decided to cease my QEMU experiments and to try the 9front 1 on the real thing. My wife's old Lenovo x60 has been collecting dust for years so I have decided to use is as a Plan 9 system. The installation was ... easy. Just as with some Linuxes: I inserted the CD and then had to press the Enter many times to accept default option in most of cases (the 9front book was very useful). Read more...\n\nIt's December\n\n(December 7, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) It's December. This year is special (you know, the 2020 is crazy) but in principle everything will be as usual: the first part of December (until 23rd) will be hectic (all these deadlines accompanied by usual chaos and masses of hysteric people) and then everything will be very slow. Read more...\n\n9front\n\n(November 30, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I have installed the 9front 1 it a QEMU virtual machine. It's a Plan 9 fork which is actively developed, you know.

But it has the DVD drive. Read more...\n\nreMarkable and WWW\n\n(November 19, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I still don't understand such things: the reMarkable 1 they developed a Chrome add-on which makes possible to save WWW pages to PDF (and possibly to upload them to the reMarkable tablet wrough their cloud and tablet's WiFi). Read more...\n\nGPUbench\n\n(November 19, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I finally compiled Swarm's \"gpubench\" GPU benchmark program 1 for my old SGI Indigo(s). He is shipping a SGI binary but it is not compatible with the IRIX 5.x so I was not able to run it. I have had to compile my own one with the SGI's cc. Read more...\n\nBackups on Palm\n\n(November 17, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I have little luck with my Palms recently. The Tungsten W seems to be dead (I think that its battery died and will try to find a replacement). Some time ago I wrote here how I lost all my Palm IIIx data because I forgot to replace the batteries. Read more...\n\nPrinting\n\n(November 16, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) The long-term home office requires printer. One needs to print some documents to be able to use them without computer (we both are people who canoe effectively read and correct documents on computer screen) and sometimes also print, sign and sent them to some places.

So I wasn't sure how good the device will be for me. Read more...\n\nRAM erased\n\n(November 6, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) Today I wanted to re-charge my Palm Tungsten W. So I connected it to the wall charger (and original Palm one, of course). It didn't respond at all. So I had to reset it. To my surprise it did a full reset. Read more...\n\nEnd of year\n\n(November 6, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) The end of year is approaching, there have been many delays during the year (COVID lockdowns, re-scheduling of many events and so on) but deadlines dit not move. So I'm in shortage of time now. Read more...\n\nNew pen (actual one)\n\n(November 5, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I never liked ink-based pens. But many people around me are using them. Even my father and my sister have been using these things for years. Read more...\n\nIRIX, MP3 and so on\n\n(November 3, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) At Saturday I had an opportunity to play with my SGI Indigo which is hidden in our village house.

I was responsible for its organisation so I has been exhausted. It ended at Friday noon, fortunately. Read more...\n\nConferencing on a PowerBook?\n\n(October 27, 2020 at 3:40 AM CET) I briefly tried if it is possible to use the PoweBook G4 with the TenFourFox for (video) conferences. No success. Obviously, there is no native application and all services I have tried (the MS Teams, the Google Meet as so) refuse to recognize my TenFourFox as a supported browser.

Read more...\n\nUGREEN\n\n(October 12, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) Anyone know this company? They are Chinese and they are making various adapters and other computer accessories. They are fairly priced, sometimes they are look cheap (plastics, PU leather parts) but they always work well. Their USC-C hub with the HDMI port is the only adapter that works without issues with the GPD Pocket (including the HDMI output - after testing of several other adapters it was unbelievable for me that this thing always works and that it always works properly).

So it always run at 1280x1024. Read more...\n\nWeek Log\n\n(September 29, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) We have started to teach almost online-only. Individual visits of students are possible but lectures have to be on-line (via the Moodle). It seems to be possible. It even seems to be doable on the ppc64le Linux. Read more...\n\nSiEd testing\n\n(September 26, 2020 at 2:41 AM CEST) If you use an old-school Palm PDA (one with screen and stylus but without any sort of keyboard) then you probably use (or wish to use) some alternative text input method. An actual hardware keyboard is probably the best (if not only) one. Read more...\n\nConference week\n\n(September 22, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) Since 2006 with only a few exceptions I was on a conference in the first or the second week of September. Often the conferences were held near the sea. So there were days in air-conditioned rooms with evenings near the sea, in pine forests and so on.

Read more...\n\nWeek Log\n\n(September 14, 2020 at 2:41 AM CEST) There was too little interesting events during last week. Our university is preparing for the new semester so there were come councils and meetings and so. Thus the GPD Pocket was in full action. Students have been coming, too. We will see at is develops because there are many student from other countries and it is possible that borders will close soon...

It seems that I have been using the (much) older SGI Indigo much more frequently. Read more...\n\nROOPHLOCH 2020 failure\n\n(September 7, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) I climbed to 1000 meters over sea (Bear's Hill, Jeseniky mountains, Czechia) yesterday.

I don't need it too much but it still will be better to test software on a real thing than on any sort of emulator. Read more...\n\nAlphaSmart stuff\n\n(August 25, 2020 at 2:41 AM CEST) Last week I played with my AlphaSmart Pro. I found several half-finished phlog post here.

It works as expected. I have not measured transfer speed but even on a 64nit 100MHz machine it seems to be fast enough. Read more...\n\nSCSI2SD v5.5\n\n(August 21, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) I'm still improving my new computer room. One of the most important issues is data exchange. I don't have a floppy or other removable media here so I have got a SCSI2SD card (version 5.5 with the DB25 connector and with a nice translucent box). Read more...\n\nNew (old) camera\n\n(August 13, 2020 at 2:41 AM CEST) Two weeks ago we broke our digital camera (a SONY DSLR A200) during a trip. I have tried to repair it (it have seemed that just the LCD screen is destroyed) but I was not successful. The device less or more works but there is not possible to configure it and some minor functions also seem to be unavailable or buggy. I counted the necessary costs to repair the device and it seems to be cheaper to buy a new one.

It has the IRIX 5.3 OS (it is not the best or the newest that it can run but it is the best compromise between speed and features).

But no such software is available for the old IRIX 5.3 which I use here for speed and space reasons.

As I wrote here some time ago my wife's computer (the GPD Pocket 2) have stopped to work with the external display. It has been a problem because its 7\" screen is no good for desktop use. I have tried several solutions but so far I have not found anything usable.

Read more...\n\nSun Ultra 20 reborn\n\n(July 21, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) I have replaced the original mainboard of the Sun Ultra 20 with the Tyan Tomcat K8E one. The Sun's one is a customised version of the Tomcat, actually. The Sun added some stuff (a FireWire controller and connectors and probably an audio port) but also removed part of connectors (a serial port, both PS/2 ports and the second Ethernet port). Read more...\n\nSun Ultra 20 R.I.P.\n\n(July 16, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) I have had the Sun Ultra 20 workstation. It's not too exciting because it's just the Tyan Tomcat motherboard with the original Opteron cased into nice metal box with the \"Sun Microsystems\" label. I bought is as new (it was said that it was the first Ultra 20 in the Czech Republic) and upgraded it few times (added a graphics board and replaced it twice, replaced the original 1.8GHz Opteron with the 2.2Ghz dual core one, expanded the RAM from 512MG to 4GB and replaced the original 80GB SATA HDD with a pair of 320GB ones) .

It's a problem because her computer (GPD Pocket 2) has no other option for an external video output.

Logout adviced me to try the Apple PoweBook G4 with OS X. It was better but I had issues with sending of files from the Centro. I will have to investigate this because it should work. Read more...\n\n10-4-Fox\n\n(July 13, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) I have to say once more that Cameron 1 is doing an excellent job. Yesterday I opened the Twitter (because the head of local administration likes to use this platform for communication) and it worked perfectly! After mixed experiences on other non-mainstream platforms I didn't expected that it will work so well.

The T|W keyboard is bigger and MUCH easier to use. But keyboard support in GUI is much better on the Centro, of course. On the T|W I have had to use stylus again and again because there are many features which are not reachable from the keyboard. Read more...\n\nCentro Progress\n\n(July 8, 2020 at 2:41 AM CEST) I have installed most of the stuff which I expect I will need on my new Palm Centro.

I gave got it because of my current nostalgic mood. Read more...\n\nMade in Japan\n\n(July 1, 2020 at 2:40 AM CEST) Just got a \"new\" SHARP calculator (more about it later). There were batteries inside (2xAA). They are labelled \"Jade in Japan\" and their production date is 06/1986. They are dead now, of course (it's 2020, after all) but they look intact: no shape changes, no leakages, even case color seems to be still same. Someone forgot them inside and they made no damage to the calculator (it works great with a new set of AAs.

OF course there are several Linux-like or BSD-like packaging systems. But if the Lynx it one's only need is the Lynx itself then it might be better to use an installer in a DMG package.

So I turned on the Nokia N800 and it worked fine (I charged the device before some months and then kept it off - the battery was still almost full and the system time was OK). The page still looks well here, by the way.

I keeps its time locally (its RTC chip is supported by a Tadiran battery which is soldered in). I do not have any type of clock on the desktop nor in the terminal so I normally don't care about time here. So I never noticed how is the clock precision.
