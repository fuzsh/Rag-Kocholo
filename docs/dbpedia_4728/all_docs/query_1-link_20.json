For the complete Aquaris E4.5 specs, see THIS page.\n\nIt's important to mention that the phone targets early adopters and if you just want WhatsApp or Skype, Ubuntu phone isn't for you just yet, as these services won't be available at launch.\n\nThe exact date, time and URL of the flash sales will be announced on the Ubuntu and BQ Twitter accounts as well as the Ubuntu Facebook and Google+ pages next week, so keep an eye on them if you want to be among the first to get an Ubuntu phone."
