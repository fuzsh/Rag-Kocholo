        "text": "DuckDuckGo announced they hit a milestone yesterday, surpassing the 10 million daily query mark on June 22, 2015.\n\nDuckDuckGo saw 10,218,617 queries on June 22nd alone. The company gives credit to that surge in users based on them being a privacy focused search engine. Gabriel Weinberg wrote, “we’re proud to be helping so many people take back their privacy.”\n\nAs a promotion, DuckDuckGo said they will give out 10,000 t-shirts to those who can help promote their search engine to three additional searchers.\n\nMore at Search Engine Land\n\nDuckDuckGo just crossed ten million searches a day for the first time ever! We’re proud to be helping so many people take back their privacy. In celebration, we’re giving away ten thousand DuckDuckGo t-shirts to enthusiasts who help their friends and family take back their privacy as well.\n\nPEW recently reported results validating that people care deeply about online privacy. For example, “40% [of Americans] think that their search engine provider shouldn’t retain information about their activity.” We’ve grown 600% since NSA surveillance news broke two years ago. And yet only a few percent of people have even heard of DuckDuckGo and other private alternatives. Getting the word out is our biggest challenge and we could really use your help. Every conversation helps.\n\nAlthough there are many ways you’re tracked online, there are a few solutions that provide significant protection. First, switch your search engine, email and other major services where your personal information is heavily tracked to good private alternatives . Second, add EFF’s HTTPS Everywhere plugin to your browser, which will encrypt web site connections where possible. Third, add EFF’s Privacy Badger plugin to your browser, which blocks third-party trackers. These three simple changes will pretty seamlessly and significantly reduce your digital footprint.\n\nMore at DuckDuckGo Blog\n\nIturnedintoanewt: “Using their searches for a while. Not always right on the spot, but they have vastly improved. If some search is way off, I have google as a second option just a click away.”\n\nDont_Reddit_Me: “Friendly reminder that the owner of DuckDuckGo previously owned a company in which, in order to register, you had to enter 3 friends’ email addresses, which he later sold to ad-based companies. And with that money, he funded DuckDuckGo. So, don’t trust them more than Google or Yahoo.”\n\nEpistaxis: “I’ll remember that when DuckDuckGo asks for my e-mail address and those of my friends.”\n\nLordAlbertson: “Been supporting them for awhile. I have a duck duck go tshirt that went on sale for a pretty reasonable price awhile ago. It’s nice to see competition to google that isn’t bing.”\n\nEwood87: “I switched over to DDG a few months ago as my first stop for searches. Found that it pulls up the right thing 90% of the time. For the other 10% I just use !g”\n\nMore at Reddit\n\nIf you are looking for an operating system that doesn’t resemble what has been done so far, then Ubuntu is what you want. It’s an OS that uses swipes from edges for most of the tasks, and it doesn’t rely on buttons. The OS is easy to use and pick up, and there are already quite a few apps for it, although not as many as you might expect. In any case, here are the phones, from the cheapest to the most expensive.\n\nThe Bq Aquaris e4.5 Ubuntu Edition was the first to make an appearance and it’s the cheapest of them all. This is an unlocked dual-sim phone with a 1.3 GHz MediaTek Quad-Core Cortex A7 processor, 1GB RAM, an 8MP back camera with flash and a front-facing 5MP camera. The display is 4.5 inches.\n\nBq Aquaris e5 Ubuntu Edition has a 5-inch IPS HD display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels (380 cd/m2), a MediaTek quad-core Cortex A7 CPU at 1.3 GHz, 1GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal storage. It’s also packed with a 13MP BSI sensor on the back and a 5MP camera on the front.\n\nThe phone that’s launching tomorrow in Europe, on June 25, Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition, is the latest one to join the fold. It comes with a MediaTek 6595 CPU with eight cores (customized by Meizu), and it’s separated into an A17 2.2GHz processor and an A7 1.7GHz processor.\n\nMore at Softpedia\n\nAfter launching a version of Office for Android tablets in January, Microsoft’s productivity suite is now out of preview and widely available for Android smartphones. As before, the app is nearly identical to its attractive iOS counterpart, letting the user get quick drafts and edits done on their phone.\n\nWhile full-featured, the app suite still isn’t meant handle your entire workload. Rather, it allows for simple edits to documents, tables, and presentations. Word, Excel, and Powerpoint’s mobile versions all also feature full Dropbox and OneDrive support for storing files. Android users who spend most of their time using Office as opposed to Google Docs would do well to upgrade now.\n\nMore at The Verge"
