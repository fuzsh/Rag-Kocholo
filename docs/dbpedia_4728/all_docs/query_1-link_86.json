        "text": "Dropbox has updated its official Windows Phone app to version 1.1. The update brings along the ability to create and manage Shared Folders within the app, as well as some bug fixes.\n\nThe update is relatively minor, although the ability to manage Shared Folders, which are ideal for groups of people who would like to collaborate on the same files together, is definitely useful.

Appropriately dubbed YouTube Kids, the free app will initially be available for Android devices only, and will be released on February 23.\n\nAs one would expect, the app contains kids-friendly interface with big, bulbous icons and minimal scrolling. Its home screen features eight large tiles, each focusing on a popular kid-friendly video series, as well as five icons at the top that’ll take kids to TV shows, music, educational programming, and top-ranking videos.

Dubbed UberEATS, the service will get you the best meals from the best local restaurants in under 10 minutes, the company claims.\n\nThe announcement marks the first time that the San Francisco-based company has launched a meal delivery service outside of its home country – the service is already available in Los Angeles, but under the name UberFRESH.

The manufacturer of the original Pebble and the Pebble Steel has updated its homepage with a countdown timer, which is set to expire in a tad less than five days.\n\nAn email sign-up sheet is also available from Pebble for the overly curious.

But starting today, it’s made its way to many more places.\n\nFor starters, you can now use Inbox by Gmail on your iPad or Android tablet. Additionally, if you want to access the inbox.google.com interface from a Web browser, you get two more options.

Sony would have you believe that microSD cards can produce better sound if they are made from the right materials and tuned just right to minimize electric noise coming from the card while it’s working.\n\nSo, for the best sound on the go you need a 64GB microSD card with the “for Premium Sound” label. Read more »\n\nCloud storage has become so widely spread and popular that most users rarely think about what service they are using and who is giving them all of the free online space. This of course is the desired effect with major players like Google Drive and Dropbox integrating their platforms so seamlessly with other applications that using them is as natural as your own hard drive. Microsoft is also big on the cloud storage scene, but oddly enough is generating far less hype, yet if you are on a recent Windows PC or a Lumia device, chances are that you already have a OneDrive account.\n\nJust like the aforementioned Google service, Microsoft also offers 15GB of free storage out of the box. And while you may be thinking that you really don’t need another service to do the same the fact of the matter is that its client is already integrated in Windows 8 and newer version and puts you one click away from synching your files to the cloud. Microsoft has a limited time promotion through the Bing Awards program that can significantly sweeten the storage deal with 100 GB of free storage for two years.

The company says that new models include encryption, while older devices will get it as an update.

Rick Osterloh, the CEO of Motorola has hit back at the Cupertino-based company, describing iPhone prices as “outrageous.”\n\n“We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you’ve got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices. We think that’s not the future,” Motorola president Rick Osterloh said. Read more »"
