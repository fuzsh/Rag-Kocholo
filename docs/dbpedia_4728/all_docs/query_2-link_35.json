        "text": "After being in talks for two years, the first Ubuntu phone will go on a series of flash sales in Europe next week. The Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition is built by a little-known Spanish company named BQ and it will be selling for 169.90 Euros which comes to approximately Rs 12,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sale model is one of its kind and only followers of Twitter accounts @ubuntu and @bqreaders will be the first people to be alerted when the Aquaris E4.5 will be ready to be bought.\n\nThe Aquaris E4.5 is expected to come with basic specifications which includes a 4.5-inch qHD display (960 x 540 pixel resolution), a MediaTek SoC with 1.3GHz quad-core processor and onboard storage of 8GB. You will be able to expand the storage space using the microSD card slot. It will come with a dual microSIM slot. The Aquaris E4.5 comes with a 5MP front facing camera.\n\nAccording√Ç Canonical, the company which owns Ubuntu, the unique selling point of the Aquaris E4.5 will be the concept of Scopes , which breaks away from the app-based interaction model. Instead the Ubuntu phone provides you a new UI method to deliver content and services to directly categorised home screens giving users a seamless experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Aquaris E4.5 will feature Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Time Out, Yelp and Cut the Rope among its starting partners along with Spotify, SoundCloud and Grooveshark integrated using their web APIs. The phone will support HTML 5.\n\nAccording to Canonical, there will not be any retail sales of Aquaris E4.5 but it will follow sporadic flash sales model."
