New Delhi: After years of false starts and broken promises, the world's first Ubuntu phone – the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition – will be available across Europe from BQ.com through a series of Flash Sales over the coming weeks.

The device comes with a 4.5-inch QHD display, a quad-core MediaTek Cortex A7 processor clocked at 1.3GHz and 1GB of RAM. It features a 5-megapixel front camera and has an 8-megapixel rear camera.

The highlight of Ubuntu Phone is the integration of content and services through "Scopes"– the visually-rich panels the phone uses to display information to users. These are also customizable by handset makers and operators, thereby making the platform more attractive. Scopes.

For instance, the NearBy scope will aggregate local services centred around where you are and what you're doing, giving you reviews of local restaurants nearby, as well as the weather in your area. This means that you don't have to open up separate apps or web pages to view all of this information.

“The launch of the first Ubuntu smartphones is a significant milestone. The new experience we deliver for users, as well as the opportunities for differentiation for manufacturers and operators, are a compelling and much-needed change from what is available today. We're excited that a rising star like BQ has recognised this opportunity and is helping us make it a reality,” said Jane Silber, CEO at Canonical.

It will go on sale exclusively across Europe for 169.90 (around £127, $194, AU$249) on Monday 9 February in a flash sale. The website for the sale and the exact time the virtual doors will open will be revealed on @Ubuntu and @bqreaders on Twitter.
