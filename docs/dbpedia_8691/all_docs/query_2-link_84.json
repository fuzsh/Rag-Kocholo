        "text": "With record-breaking hits like 'Avatar,' 'Titanic,' and 'The Terminator,' James Cameron, a famous Canadian filmmaker, has carved a niche for himself in the science fiction genre. As a college dropout, he learnt the nitty-gritties of special effects by himself, and began his career with a short film of 10 minutes titled 'Xenogenesis.' After working in a few projects as a special effect manager and assistant director, he got his big break with the movie 'The Terminator.' Though he had a great idea in the form of ‘The Terminator,’ he faced initial hurdles as no one gave him a chance to prove himself. However, with determination and an innovative screenplay, he found a producer who agreed to bankroll the movie. The movie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a robot-killer, became an instant hit. From then on, there was no looking back for this talented filmmaker. He went on to make path-breaking films like 'Aliens,' 'The Abyss,' 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' 'True Lies,' 'Titanic,' and 'Avatar.' With the release of ‘Avatar,’ he became one of the most successful filmmakers in the world. This director is not only interested in movies, but also shows a deep concern for environmental issues like the pollution of oceans due to oil spills. Apart from that, he is passionate about science, which is apparent in his movies. He also serves on the 'NASA Advisory Council.'"
