        "meta_description": "With record-breaking hits like 'Avatar,' 'Titanic,' and 'The Terminator,' James Cameron, a famous Canadian filmmaker, has carved a niche for himself in the science fiction genre. As a college dropout, he learnt the nitty-gritties of special effects by himself, and began his career with a short film of 10 minutes titled 'Xenogenesis.' After working in a few projects as a special effect manager and assistant director, he got his big break with the movie 'The Terminator.' Though he had a great idea in the form of ‘The Terminator,’ he faced initial hurdles as no one gave him a chance to prove himself. However, with determination and an innovative screenplay, he found a producer who agreed to bankroll the movie. The movie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a robot-killer, became an instant hit. From then on, there was no looking back for this talented filmmaker. He went on to make path-breaking films like 'Aliens,' 'The Abyss,' 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' 'True Lies,' 'Titanic,' and 'Avatar.' With the release of ‘Avatar,’ he became one of the most successful filmmakers in the world. This director is not only interested in movies, but also shows a deep concern for environmental issues like the pollution of oceans due to oil spills. Apart from that, he is passionate about science, which is apparent in his movies. He also serves on the 'NASA Advisory Council.'",

        "text": "In 1978, James Cameron was inspired by 'Screenplay,' a book by American screenwriter Syd Field, and wrote the script for a movie titled 'Xenogenesis.' The script, which was shot in 35mm reel, was a ten-minute sci-fi film. Soon, he was hired by 'Roger Corman Studios' to make miniature models for low-investment films. He was later appointed as the art director for the 1980 movie 'Battle Beyond the Stars.' The next two years, he worked on science fictions films like 'Escape from New York,' 'Galaxy of Terror,' and 'Android.' During this time, he also began working on 'Piranha II: The Spawning,' a sequel to the earlier scifi horror movie ‘Piranha.’ He first worked as the special effects in-charge, and later as the director. While shooting the film, he failed to capture a close-up shot of Carole Davis, and was fired. However, he stayed back to help producer Ovidio Assonitis as an assistant director. In 1984, James' first major project 'The Terminator' was released under 'Pacific Western Productions,' owned by his former colleague Gale Anne Hurd. The movie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was made with a budget of $6.5 million, but went on to earn more than $78 million. Cameron wrote the screenplay for 'Rambo: First Blood Part II.' Released in 1985, the film was later edited by Sylvester Stallone. The movie, directed by George P. Cosmatos, proved to be extremely successful at the box-office. In 1986, James came up with 'Aliens,' a sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 film ‘Alien.’ The movie was a hit, grossing millions of dollars. It also received several 'Academy Award' nominations. The 1989 film 'The Abyss' was Cameron's next movie, where he cast actors Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in lead roles. The movie, which boasted of real underwater shooting, was made on an expensive budget of $41 million. In 1991, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' was released, where Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprised their respective roles from the previous movie. The film went on to gross more than $500 million, and won four 'Oscars' for 'Best Visual Effects,' 'Best Makeup,' 'Best Sound Mixing,' and 'Best Sound Effects Editing.' In 1993, the director teamed up with special effects experts Scott Ross and Stan Winston to establish a firm named 'Digital Domain.' The company, located in California, is known for creating spectacular special effects for movies. During 1994-95, films like 'True Lies,' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 'Strange Days,' starring Ralph Fiennes in the lead, were released. Both the movies were well-received by critics. While the former enjoyed success at the box-office, the latter did poorly in terms of collecting money. 1997 saw the release of the cult movie 'Titanic' which had Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in lead roles. Made on a high budget of $200 million, it failed to generate enough revenue in the first few weeks. However, it soon impressed the audiences, becoming the highest earning movie of all time, and grossing $600.8 million. It accumulated a whopping $2 billion worldwide. From 2000-02, the famous director made a shift to television series, and created the sci-fi show 'Dark Angel' with Jessica Alba in the lead. For the next few years, he also concentrated on making documentary films under his banner, 'Earthship Productions.' The remarkable director made documentaries, such as 'Expedition: Bismarck,' 'Ghosts of the Abyss,' 'Aliens of the Deep,' and 'The Lost Tomb of Jesus.' He also produced the movie 'Solaris,' starring George Clooney in the lead. The movie was directed by Steven Soderbergh. In 2009, the film 'Avatar' was released in 3D. Starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver, the film was a technical marvel. It was directed, co-produced, and written by Cameron, and its technicalities proved to be ground-breaking in the world of cinema. The film earned $1 billion and broke Titanic's record of being the highest grossing film. Two years later, the gifted director worked as the executive producer in an Australian 3D movie titled 'Sanctum.'"
