I'd go down to the USC library and pull any ideas that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or I’d transfers, anything that related to film technology…if they'd let me photocopy it, I would. If not, I'd make notes.\" As the future filmmaker continued to educate himself in the techniques, he landed a job as a miniature model maker at the Roger Corman Studios. Making fast, low-budget productions, Cameron was able to pick up the pace efficiently and effectively, moving up his ranking within the studio, soon working as an art director in the sci-fi movie Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), Cameron finally got his big break in 1981 when he got his first shot at directing a film entitled Piranha II: The Spawning\n\n5 *~True Lies-1994 *~The Terminator 2-1991 - Judgment Day ~Abyss-1989 ~Aliens-1986 *~The Terminator-1984 Piranha Part Two-1982 -The Spawning\n\n6 Aliens of the Deep (2005) Ghosts of the Abyss (2004) ~Most Famous Film~ Titanic (1997) Won best director for\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 Strong female characters.
