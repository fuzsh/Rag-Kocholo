        "text": "James Cameron is a Canadian filmmaker, known for directing epic, high-budget action films. He got his start working in special effects departments on films before transitioning to making his own films. His films have been exceptionally lucrative and successful at the box office throughout his career. Since starting to make films, he has also become an active environmentalist.\n\nBorn in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, Cameron moved with his family to California when he was 17. After dropping out of college, he taught himself about special effects, and was inspired to work in the film world after seeing George Lucas' Star Wars in 1977. He was an assistant on several films, before beginning work designing miniatures for Roger Corman's Studios. Next, he worked as the special effects director on Piranha and Piranha II. Cameron's first film as director was The Terminator, which he also wrote. He then wrote the sequel to Alien (Aliens), which was a huge success and earned numerous award nominations. In 1989, he directed and wrote The Abyss.\n\nIn the 1990s, Cameron directed Terminator 2: Judgment Day and True Lies, both starring Arnold Schwartzenegger, as well as co-writing Strange Days with Kathryn Bigelow. His biggest breakthrough came with Titanic in 1997, which Cameron directed and wrote. The film was a romance that took place on the doomed voyage of the RMS Titanic in 1912, and starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. It was a smash success, holding the number 1 box office spot for months, and won 11 Academy Awards.\n\nAfter Titanic, Cameron directed Dark Angel for television, and then a number of documentaries in the early 2000s. In 2009, he directed Avatar, a science fiction epic that had a budget of over 300 million dollars. The film broke many box office records and was nominated for 9 Academy Awards. He has since announced plans to release 3 sequels to Avatar."
