        "text": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nAll communications between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Hollywood director/producer James Cameron (born James Francis Cameron on August 16, 1954, in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada) within the 20-year record retention schedule for such records (as specified on p. 202 of the May 2022 DoD document titled \"Records Disposition Schedules,\" Record Group 303). Such communications may include, but should not be limited to, emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls.\n\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrett Carollo"
