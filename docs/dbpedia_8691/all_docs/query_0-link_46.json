        "text": "The Sundance Kids\n\nWithin moments of arriving at Sundance, Eric lands a lunch with studio bigwig--and gets an offer for Vince that might be too good to refuse. Ari advises him to play it safe, and Vince wants to roll the dice. Turtle and Drama don't want to share.\n\nThe Bat Mitzvah\n\nVince gets up-front about his feelings for Aquagirl, sending everyone into a panic. Meanwhile, Ari's partner Terrance resurfaces, Eric splurges on an 'investment' suit, and Drama and Turtle have high hopes for Little Miss Ari's Bat Mitzvah.\n\nAquamom\n\nSeason Three premiere. When Vince's plan to bring a 'premiere-worthy' date to the 'Aquaman' premiere fails, Eric bails him out with a Plan B. Turtle and Drama's attempt to get two extra tickets for a couple of 'video ho's' incites the ire of Vince's co-star. And, with money tight, Ari adjusts to his new digs.\n\nThe Abyss\n\nIn the Season Two finale, Vince's despondent mood forces Eric to consider fending for himself. Meanwhile, Ari has meetings at a coffee shop and Drama and Turtle make a vow of silence."
