        "text": "James Cameron is one of the most successful film directors of his generation, with plenty of achievements under his belt, but there is probably a lot about him that many fans might not be aware of.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJames Cameron was born August 16th, 1954, in Ontario, Canada. His father earned a living as an electrical engineer, while his mother was an artist and a nurse. He was the eldest of five children, and his heritage is originally from Scotland. In his childhood, he would spend a lot of time on his grandfather’s farm in Ontario. When he was aged 17, the family moved to California. Later on, after school, he would attend a community college, where he studied physics.\n\nTop Movies\n\nAlthough most commonly known as a director, James Cameron is also a well-known movie writer too. In fact, one of the earliest writing credits to his name is The Terminator, back in 1984. That movie went on to become one of the most successful of all time, so that was a pretty strong start to his career! He has also written a wide range of other movies as well, many of which are extremely popular and famous.\n\nWhether in the guise of a writer or director, Cameron has been involved in so many amazing and well-received movies over the years, including the Terminator series, Aliens, Titanic, Avatar and many more. It is fair to say he is easily one of the most commercially successful and well-regarded movie directors in history, with some of these being the best grossing films of all time.\n\nCameron is arguably best known for Titanic, which was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010 – when another move of his, Avatar, overtook it. Titanic was initially nominated for 14 Academy awards, and ultimately won a grand total of 11, one of the best showings for any movie in the history of the Oscars. It also received many other plaudits besides, and it was the first movie to make over a billion dollars overall.\n\nMore than a Director\n\nIt has to be said that James Cameron is easily one of the most influential movie directors of all time. In fact, this has been recognized in the past in various forms. Most notably perhaps is the fact that he was named by Time as one of the one hundred most influential people in the world in 2010, the year of Avatar’s release.\n\nIt’s not just movies that Cameron is involved in, however. He is also widely known for the various sustainability businesses that he runs. On top of that, he gives talks regularly, and is known as something of an explorer, including having visited the site of the wreckage of the real Titanic. As such a well-regarded and experienced individual, it’s easy to see why he is so popular, not only by those who love his movies but many others as well."
