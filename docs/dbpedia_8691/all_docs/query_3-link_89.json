        "text": "Gemma Walsh, a research radiographer at City St George’s (CSG), has been recognised as an exceptional talent in WeAreTheCity’s Rising Star Awards 2024.\n\nCelebrated for her outstanding contributions to the field of radiography and her innovative work on radiographer workforce development, Gemma was named in the 'Digital' category for her vision and efforts towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into radiography.\n\nRecognising radiography excellence\n\nBesides her work at CSG, Gemma is a CT/MRI lead radiographer at Whittington Health NHS Trust’s Wood Green NHS Community Diagnostic Centre. Her recent accolade from WeAreTheCity highlights her exceptional contributions and passion for advancing the role of radiographers in the digital age.\n\nGemma’s nomination and subsequent award underscore her excellent work in exploring how radiographers can become future leaders in AI. This endeavour aims to ensure the safe and effective implementation of AI across healthcare, a field that is rapidly evolving and holds significant promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care.\n\nReflecting on her achievement, Gemma expressed her gratitude and surprise: “It was a lovely surprise to be nominated, but to win was an even nicer surprise! I am grateful to have won this award and be recognised for the work I am doing, but equally pleased to bring awareness of the radiography profession into a space outside the radiography community.”"
