        "text": "As The Gentlemen hits small screens, straight out of Guy Ritchie’s testosterone-fuelled world, Theo James is securing his status as one of the nation’s most popular – and handsomely sculpted – rising stars.\n\nNeedless to say, James isn’t all high cheekbones and olive skin. The actor of The White Lotus fame has led an interesting and varied life, spending time working in the NHS and proving his other talents by singing in a band, Shere Khan. One of the standout things about James is his privacy – he has managed to build a hot-shot career in modern TV and Film without being a devoted influencer, frittering time drumming up a social media following. Instead, James has opted for the quieter approach. He was married in 2020 and already has two children, leading a relatively quiet life – but still managing to bag some of the top roles around. What more could you want? And just how has he done it? Read on.\n\nJames was born in leafy High Wycombe, a town within firing distance of London. He was raised, however, in Askett, a picturesque hamlet in Buckinghamshire, in the Parish of Princes Risborough. His father Philip Taptiklis is a business consultant, while his mother Jane Martin worked for the NHS. Theo’s full name is, in fact, Theodore Peter James Kinnaird Taptiklis. (So there was plenty of choice for the stage name.) The Scottish and Greek credentials also prove strong – though as far as his stage name went, he seems to have opted for neither Kinnaird nor Tapitklis. James is also one of five children, with two sisters and two brothers, so is no doubt used to having to push to get what he wants.\n\nAs a young man, James studied at Aylesbury Grammar School, before taking a degree in Philosophy at Nottingham University. After graduating, he went to train at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, in the vibrant southwest of England. It was at the Old Vic that James met his future wife, Ruth Kearney, an Irish actress who was also training there. Training alongside one another, in what was no doubt a charged social environment, Kearney and James grew close quickly – though it would be some time before they would marry. They also went on to appear together in theatre productions, such as Man of Mode.\n\nRead More\n\nFrom Badminton House to Loseley Park, Tatler provides a glimpse into the stunning stately locations featured in The Gentlemen\n\nAs far as its locations are concerned, The Gentlemen truly lives up to its title, with a number of exquisitely beautiful country houses and old-world locations forming up the repertoire\n\nAccording to L’Officiel, James worked as a bartender and lifeguard before becoming a fully fledged professional actor. As everyone knows, it ain’t so easy to make it! One of James’s grislier jobs in his early career was clearing out the houses of the deceased on behalf of the NHS.\n\nDuring the early period of his life, James also proved he had plenty of musicianship and stage presence at his fingertips, performing in the enigmaticaally named Shere Khan, a band he formed with local friends. You can see from early videos that James had some trademark hand gestures as lead singer, wafting his hands around in a kind of shamanistic routine. The music is not unimpressive and one detects traces of Bombay Bicycle Club, Foals and other 2010s influences.\n\nJames’s TV breakthrough came with two episodes of A Passionate Woman in 2010. He quickly followed up with the role of Kemal Pamuk, a Turkish diplomat in the first season of Downton Abbey. James’s Greek heritage and olive Mediterranean skin (he seems not to have inherited the Scottish look so much) made him an apt piece of casting. One of the things James began to prove at this stage was his mastery of range; playing characters from around the globe in his early career and deftly deploying Turkish, American, Irish and Scottish accents.\n\nRead More\n\nDuke and disorderly: As new Netflix series The Gentlemen puts the spotlight on Badminton House, the Duke of Beaufort opens the doors to his palatial home\n\nTo celebrate the release of The Gentlemen, revisit Tatler’s interview with the self-styled rock god and his wife, the Duchess of Beaufort from the January issue\n\nIn 2012 James appeared in the trashy teenage classic, The Inbetweeners Movie, a piece of British popular culture which has aged exceedingly poorly. Film credits then began to stack up, including You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger and Underworld: Awakening. James cracked America, breaking into several roles including in the crime series, Golden Boy. But his true global breakthrough came with Divergent, in which he played Tobias ‘Four’ Eaton.\n\nDivergent is a young adult classic, based on a series of books written by Veronica Roth while she was studying at Northwestern University. It depicts a rigid dystopian society in which people are organised into five concrete factions by society. James’s character, Tobias Eaton, is an instructor in the universe, responsible for inducting initiates into the ‘Dauntless’ faction. He is a traumatised but attractive character who becomes caught up in a romantic relationship with Tris Prior, another of the lead roles.\n\nJames appeared in the Divergent follow-ups throughout the late 2010s and was known for performing his own stunts in the films. In an interview with Today, he once remarked, ‘Being an actor, sometimes you hang around on set a lot, and you're waiting around in the trailer, so when you can do a bit of running and sweating, it can be good.’\n\nAs he became a firm fixture in the film industry, James began to show that he could do more than just act. He has brought stories together as a producer on a number of occasions, including Backstabbing for Beginners, the Jane Austen period piece, Sanditon, and 2019’s Lying and Stealing. In that same year, James launched his own production company, Untapped.\n\nIf you had to put a date on the moment James broke into the mainstream, it was almost certainly with the immediately-iconic second season of The White Lotus, HBO’s dark-satire-comedy series, which offers razor-sharp takes on the lives of the wealthy and careless. The anthology revolves around a chain of luxury hotels called The White Lotus and was devised during the pandemic, in response to the need to film an entire series in one enclosed location.\n\nThe last Sicily-based series has left viewers thirstily waiting for the next. James played the philandering investments manager, Cameron Sullivan, who finds himself in very hot water on the Italian island, after cheating on his wife. Viewers may remember James for certain moments of full bodily exposure – but there can be no doubt that it was an excellent performance too. James once reflected in an interview on the difference between talent and hard work: ‘I know I often get a job because of how I look. I hope that I keep the job because of how I act.’ It looks like he did more than enough on this occasion as he seems only to have gone from strength to strength.\n\nSince marrying Ruth Kearney in 2020, the couple have lived a transatlantic existence, splitting time between Venice Beach, California, and North London. They have a daughter who was born in 2021 and another baby who was born in September 2023. James has always been careful to maintain a degree of privacy. He does not have social media and has avoided leaning on constant influencership to boost his career. In a 2015 interview with The Cut, he said of his approach to life in the spotlight, ‘Even though I'm an actor, I don't love sharing everything about myself. It's always good to keep a little bit for yourself.’\n\nAs The Gentlemen hits small screens, James will appear as Eddie, who finds himself in the surprising position of inheriting his father’s titles and estate. Don’t worry Guy Ritchie fans: there are plenty of guns. And drugs and sex too. For those of a more genteel disposition, there is also a whole gamut of stately homes on display, thanks to the high-society setting of the story.\n\nAs far as Eddie is concerned, it looks like a role Theo James was born to play."
