Ninety-year-old Rhoda Levine, an opera director legendary to those in that world, has remained largely unknown –and unheralded–outside that sphere. An unassuming breaker of the glass-ceiling, she was an iconoclast who not only shaped the careers of countless singers but also championed American opera, leaving it firmly planted in the canon. The film captures the essence of the impact on that art form and touches on the compromises, the challenges, the accolades and, also, the regrets of a life in the arts. Especially one behind the scenes. The documentary cements her legacy, bringing it out into the open and capturing the essence of a unique artist. An Uncommon Woman.
