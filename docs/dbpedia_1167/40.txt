Three Ladies Beside the Sea was commissioned by Sarasa, a period instrument ensemble based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for their 20th anniversary season. The text is a slightly abridged setting of a 1963 childrenâ€™s book of the same name by Rhoda Levine, a notable opera director, and a great friend for over thirty years. The original book had illustrations by Edward Gorey. Rhoda has now retired, and as we never collaborated on the stage, this was the next best thing.
