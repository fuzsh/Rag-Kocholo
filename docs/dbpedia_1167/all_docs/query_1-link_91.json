        "text": "Like all of contemporary music, American opera has many currents and tributaries, and any blanket assertions about it will quickly draw shouts of contradiction. But an important school of thought about this repertory, rooted to some extent in a Germanic and Russian conception of opera, holds that American opera will resonate most strongly if it is linked to American literature. This philosophy was eventually supplanted by one in which recent news events attained primacy as operatic subject matter, but between the 1940's and the 70's, several works were based on American novels, plays and short stories.\n\nOne of them, Carlisle Floyd's setting of the John Steinbeck novel ''Of Mice and Men,'' returned to the New York City Opera repertory on Saturday evening after a 15-year absence in a persuasive new production by Rhoda Levine. Ms. Levine's production, which occupies spare naturalistic sets by John Conklin, was first staged at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997.\n\nSteinbeck's story of itinerant farm workers has ample operatic potential. Its main characters, the feebleminded Lennie and his companion and protector, George, fantasize about buying a small farm of their own, thereby breaking the cycle of wandering the countryside, taking low-paying harvesting jobs and getting chased out when Lennie lands them in trouble. They nearly achieve this dream when Candy, another worker, offers to put his substantial savings at their disposal if he can join them.\n\nThere is ample foreshadowing to warn us that this plan will go awry, as well as a near tragedy when Lennie ends up in a brawl with Curley, the boss. Lennie's passion for petting soft things, but doing it so hard that he destroys them (coupled with a tendency to panic under pressure), leads him to inadvertently kill Curley's Wife."
