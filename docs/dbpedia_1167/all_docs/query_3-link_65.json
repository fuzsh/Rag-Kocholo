        "text": "Rabbi Richard A. Levine, who served as the spiritual leader of Burlington County’s only Reform synagogue for 41 years, died Feb 28 at Virtua Hospital, Voorhees, following a long illness. Rabbi Levine was a well-known, influential and beloved Jewish advocate in South Jersey, Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. He was 75.\n\nRabbi Emeritus of Adath Emanu-El in Mount Laurel since his 2005 retirement, the Voorhees resident continued to teach adult courses there — the school wing is named for him — and to contribute to special events and services.\n\n“If life is a tapestry, then Dad was content to labor from the back, fixing up the loose ends, confident in the knowledge that his work would create something of incredible beauty and meaning,” said his oldest son Ari Levine, adding that his tapestry included his work with the synagogue, Jewish youth, and relations with his blended family.\n\nRabbi Levine was the first full-time rabbi to serve Temple Emanu-El of Willingboro, as the congregation was known when he arrived shortly after his ordination in 1964. At that time, his son noted, the congregation had fewer than 50 families, was meeting in a private home, and had just acquired the land for its first synagogue building.\n\nUnder Rabbi Levine’s leadership, the congregation grew to over 500 families, but after demographics changed and membership declined, he led the procession from Willingboro to the temple’s new home in Mount Laurel in 1997. There, he fastened the mezuzah to doorposts leading to the sanctuary of what by then was known as Adath Emanu-El. In Mount Laurel, membership again swelled to more than 500 families.\n\nHe was born on July 14, 1938 in Brooklyn, N.Y., the youngest of Julius and Theresa Levine’s three children.\n\nRabbi Levine graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s degree in economics, with the thought of following his father and brother into the family accounting business. He enjoyed his years at Penn, particularly his time on the track team. In later years, he would proudly display a college yearbook photo that featured him and a perhaps more-famous member of the team, Oscarnominated actor Bruce Dern. But he felt a higher calling.\n\nHe was ordained as a Reform rabbi at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City in 1964.\n\nThe rabbi’s passion for sports continued throughout his lifetime. “Generations of bar mitzvah boys still remember his challenging them to one-on-one basketball games as an inducement to further study,” Ari Levine said. During the 1980s and ’90s, Rabbi Levine coanchored a Philadelphia Eagles’ television pregame show called “A Higher Power,” which blended enthusiasm for his Eagles with humor and theology.\n\nRabbi Levine’s other great passion, besides his family, was Israel and its place in the hearts of all Jews. His first trip to Israel was on a Young Judaea trip in 1955. He remained passionate about Israel throughout his life, making more than 25 trips — and leading 11 congregational trips — to the Holy Land.\n\nHe was an ardent supporter of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), and led Adath Emanu-El to plant more trees in Israel than any other New Jersey congregation, an accomplishment that resulted in his name being placed on the JNF Roll of Honor in Jerusalem.\n\nEarly in his career, Rabbi Levine was tapped to help lead the song and Israeli dance program at Camp Kutz, the Reform Movement’s youth leadership training institute in Warwick, N.Y. “My father gave license to a new generation of voices such as the late (singer-songwriter) Debbie Friedman, Cantor Jeff Klepper and Rabbi Daniel Freelander, and they in turn helped to change the way Jews relate to one another and to God,” Ari said. Whenever a congregation sings a Debbie Friedman or a Jeff Klepper song, an echo of my father’s teaching can be heard.”\n\nDebbie Friedman wrote her first song, “And Thou Shalt Love,” while living with Rabbi Levine and his family in Willingboro.\n\nRabbi Levine is survived by his wife of 28 years, Judith Chaikin Levine; children Ari (the late William Monnich Jr.) Levine, Ron (Kim) Levine, Brian (Iris Caesar) Golder, Jason (Lisa) Chaikin, Deborah (Chealsea Nather) Golder, Matthew Chaikin, Samantha (David Halpern) Chaikin, Yael (Doug) Emenecker and Shira (Lior) Keet; his sister, Rhoda (the late Dr. Jack) Cohen; his brother, Robert (Helen) Levine, and 13 grandchildren. His first marriage, to Judith Gittelsohn, ended in divorce; his second, to Lois Golder, ended with her death.\n\nContributions may be made to the Rabbi Richard Levine Good Works Fund, c/o Adath Emanu-El, 205 Elbo Lane, Mount Laurel, N.J. 08054. Contributions will be divided among his favorite charities, including Adath Emanu-El, the Jewish National Fund and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. ."
