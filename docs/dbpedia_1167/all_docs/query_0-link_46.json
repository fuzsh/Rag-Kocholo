        "text": "Joseph H. Levine, 57, of Amherst, died suddenly, on November 11, 2014 at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester. He was born in Boston, MA on February 24, 1957 the son of Bernard Levine and Rhoda (Sherman) Levine.\n\nJoseph grew up in Canton, MA. He attended Canton schools and graduated from Northeastern University with his Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering. He married his devoted wife, Deborah (Zubris) Levine in 1984. After starting a family in Brockton, MA, they moved to Amherst, NH in 1998 where they raised their two children.\n\nJoseph enjoyed discussing politics and watching the Boston sports teams win. He loved spending time with his dogs, taking his loving wife out on “date nights” and making people laugh. His wonderful sense of humor will be deeply missed by all those who knew him.\n\nIn addition to his mother, Joseph is survived by his wife Deborah Levine and his children David Levine of Nashua and Rachael Levine of Amherst. He will also be missed by his brother Robert Levine of Norwood, MA and his long time and good friend Mark Estra of CT.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family suggests that memorial contributions be made in Joseph’s name to The Wounded Warrior Project at www.wounded\n\nwarriorproject.org."
