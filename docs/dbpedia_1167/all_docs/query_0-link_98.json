        "text": "The bye round, in which some players twiddle their thumbs while others are fighting at the card table, is always an unsatisfactory method of organizing a knockout team event. It has been generally abandoned, but the alternative, involving three-way matches, cannot be used for a small number of teams.\n\nThe mixed blessing of a bye was presented last week, at the Albany half of the Albany-Secaucus, N.J., Split Regional, to a foursome that had come a long way and was eager to play: Paul and Abby Heitner of Toronto, David Beer of New York and Howard Lawrence of Hartford.\n\nThey were happy for a free road into the next round but lamented the fact that they would have four wasted hours. Finding an unemployed but less-experienced foursome, they sat down and played an unofficial match - and lost. Thus the Heitner team had the unique experience of losing their bye round but, thanks no doubt to the practice, winning the event.\n\nOn the diagramed deal, which aided the winners in their semifinal match, Paul Heitner, using a strong club system, made a natural opening bid of two clubs. He landed in five clubs, and East contributed a greedy double.\n\nThree rounds of spades were led, and South ruffed in dummy and cashed the club king. The bad trump split was no surprise, and he had a long-term plan to deal with it. He took a trump finesse, cashed two heart winners, throwing the diamond king, and led the third heart winner. He ruffed this, a trump-reducing play with the fancy name of ''grand coup,'' and led to the diamond jack to arrive at this position:\n\nA heart was ruffed and the diamond queen was led to the ace, leaving East's trumps trapped and giving Heitner his doubled game contract.\n\nWinners of the novice Swiss teams in Albany were Rhoda Levine and Joe Margules of Albany and Sandra and Lewis Rosewater of Delmar, N.Y."
