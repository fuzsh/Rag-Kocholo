        "text": "How big and elegant?\n\nThe University Club is an old-money building. We were in a ballroom on the seventh floor, but there were more above. Look at those wooden walls! I'd say walnut, but it might be mahogany. Wow!\n\nAgain... How big and elegant?\n\nIf you look up, here's what you see on the ceiling.\n\nThey had set out a nice buffet, with chicken and salmon dishes and tasty choices in veggies.That's Simon Fenster, Joel Raphael, Richard Woronoff, and Bob Diamond helping themselves.\n\nLaura Barbanel, Rachelle Both, Ruth Hefter, Elizabeth Scoledes\n\nSusan Gilbert Levine photo\n\nClockwise from left: Bob Diamond, Simon Fenster, Joel Raphael, Maria Sardina, Bernie Paul, Richard Woronoff, Carol Glicksman\n\nThis was my table; I'm not in the picture because I'm behind the camera.\n\nStan Seltzer and Louisa Jacobs spend their first time together since they went to the Senior Prom.\n\nSusan Gilbert Levine photo\n\nMary Repole, Joel Garrelick, Jordan James Levine, Sandra Garrelick"
