        "text": "\"I had the pleasure of many years of friendship with David Caron, as well as the honour of sitting with him as a Judge. He was that rare man who was a distinguished international lawyer but who wore his distinction lightly, never taking himself too seriously. He will be missed as a lawyer, a judge, a teacher and a great friend to so many of us.\"\n\nSir Christopher Greenwood, Former Judge, International Court of Justice\n\n\"...an undoubted giant in the fields of international law and dispute resolution and should have had a long time before him to contribute even more to its development...\"\n\nThe Honourable Charles N. Brower, Arbitrator\n\n\"David was a professional giant among the California redwoods whom I knew and greatly admired throughout most of his brilliant career of teaching, scholarship and other service. I was a beneficiary of several community-building workshops on issues of international law that he hosted in Berkeley for West Coast colleagues. His hospitality, often music-oriented, capped those occasions, may I say, beautifully.\"\n\nJames A.R. Nafziger, Willamette University College of Law\n\n\"As David became more and more involved in the governance of the American Society of International Law, we worked together closely. And we did so during his presidency of the Society when he took so much time away from his teaching and scholarship to ensure the Society's continued success. His presidency was a model of energy and ideas for his successors to follow...\"\n\nPeter Trooboff, Covington & Burling LLP\n\nView more tributes here."
