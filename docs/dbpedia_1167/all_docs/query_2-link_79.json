        "text": "The Caribbean(s) Redefined (1997)\n\nIntroduction\n\nCultural identities come from somewhere, have histories. But, like everything which is historical, they undergo constant transformation. Far from being eternally fixed in some essentialized past, they are subject to the continuous ‘play’ of history, culture and power.\n\nStuart Hall\n\nThe Caribbean, as a social space, has become a palimpsest of multiple writings and rewritings over the last five centuries. After Christopher Columbus’ founding text, which, for the first time, mapped out the territory for the Europeans, a series of chroniclers’ rewritings followed. They were the documents written by Las Casas, Oviedo and Pané, to name just a few. Each one of these rewritings apparently cancelled out the previous ones, although never completely since spiritual traces were always left which, by juxtaposing themselves, established what in Freudian terms is called the archi-writing, that is, those texts that are “hidden” or partially obscured but never totally erased.\n\nThe chroniclers’ multiple rewritings have been recovered by successive historiographical, essentialist, sociological, ethnocentric, resistant or reductionist new writings. Each one of these texts does violence to the previous one, but none of them cancels each other out. Just as in Borges’ “Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote,” the traces of the old writings change their meaning when they are read against the juxtaposition of other rewritings.\n\nThis issue of Latin American Issues has as its main goal the textual redefinition of the Caribbean(s) from a multiplicity of perspectives that bespeak the cultural diversity of this multifaceted social space. In his essay, Erik Camayd-Freixas analyzes the upsurge of the urban cult to the goddess Mita in Puerto Rico. Mary Ann Gosser Esquilín proposes in her essay a redefinition of Caribbean identities from the viewpoint of the region’s new female voices. From a philosophical angle, Holger Henke sets out to explore the possibilities of an ontology of Caribbean existence. Camille Hernández-Ramdwar’s work studies the multiracial identities in Trinidad and Guyana. Jaume Martí-Olivella articulates the historical and narratological subject of the post-colonial tourist in the Caribbean. Through the analysis of “merengue,” the most popular music in the Dominican Republic, Gus Puleo studies the conflicts surrounding identity and national politics in that Caribbean country. Finally, Fernando Valerio-Holguín analyzes the problematics of the Caribbean diaspora to the United States as they are represented in a story by Ana Lydia Vega. Each one of the essays included in this issue contributes a new, highly particularized, rewriting to the palimpsest of the Caribbean cultures.\n\nEditorial Board:\n\nJaume Martí-Olivella\n\nFernando Valerio-Holguín\n\nGiles Wayland-Smith\n\nArticle I\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nCamayd-Freixas, E.

Floral Park was then an affluent middle class subdivision which had been upper middle class over twenty years earlier, when the grand Catholic church building of the Holy Spirit was established in its midst. On the margin, one street over from my house, began the poor neighborhood of Cantera (Quarry), itself on the outskirts of Barrio Obrero(Workers’ Town). Three blocks in was the Temple of Mita, an old and humble two-story house converted for worship and always freshly painted. Most of the little houses on the way bore the word “MITA” in small block letters over the front door, their dwellers always wearing white from their hat to their shoes.\n\nIt came to pass that the immortal Mita died in 1970 after a long illness. She had become so prominent that the island’s Senate suspended its sessions for three days in her honor (Javariz and Krüger). She was buried with great pomp and ceremony after she failed to rise on the third day as some had expected (Reguero and Rojas). The Catholic side rubbed it in with a triumphant “You see!”, writing off her cult as dead as well. Six years later, I, like other Floral Park kids, was bound for a U.S. college. My family, like others, moved to the newer suburbs of San Juan. When I recently returned to my old school and neighborhood twenty years later, Floral Park had aged indeed. The church of the Holy Spirit was still there, somehow less grand than it once seemed. On the way to Barrio Obrero, the little houses, as humble and neatly kept as ever, now read “MITA en AARÓN” over their doors. The small temple, though still standing, showed little activity. But down the street, in stark contrast with its surroundings, rose an ultra-modern, multi-story, marble and glass building, bearing large M’s in golden calligraphy over its many doors. It was the new temple of a “Congregation” which now has chapters in major U.S. cities, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic; it also owns furniture and cinder block factories, cattle ranches, farms, stores, supermarkets, credit unions, and a lot of real estate. From its own cable TV program, the prophet Aarón, Mita’s heir, preaches fire twice a week into the hearts of thousands. Since financial independence, they no longer accept donations during services (an issue they proudly point out to the Catholic side), but instead give housing and jobs, and pay dividends to their members, as collective owners of their profitable business ventures.\n\nBehind this success story, is the fascinating personal history of Mita herself, and a simple but compelling theology. Born Juanita García Peraza in 1897, “Mita” was raised a Catholic in a small town. Facing impending death from incurable ulcers, the 8-year-old was visited by a saintly old woman who nurtured her back to health through prayer, and ushered her into the charismatic Pentecostal church. Later, a wife and a mother of four, Juanita was visited by the Holy Spirit, who announced to her that her body was needed to carry out God’s work on earth. She accepted and was given the choice of persecution or illness as a life trial. She chose the latter. Shortly after, she was looking out of her bedroom window at a clear starry night, asking why she had been chosen, when a shooting star moving in the distance suddenly approached her and landed on her forehead, filling the room with light (Cruz). She had become the living incarnation of the Holy Spirit, who at that moment revealed to her the name of God in this new era: “MITA” or “Spirit of Life.” For it had been prophesied in Revelation 2.17 that “He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches: To him who overcomes, I will give… a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives it.”1 Thereafter, she began to “speak in tongues” and perform healings.\n\nAs she became more outspoken, problems arose with the Pentecostal leaders. One day, in a rapture, the Holy Spirit, acting through her, anointed a young boy as the First Prophet of God in the new era. Teófilo Vargas Seín, renamed “Aarón,” was to become thirty years later Mita’s heir and is still today, at age 75, the spiritual and material leader of the congregation. But back then, a woman taking on the authority to anoint and passing judgment upon the patriarchal elders brought her a trial for blasphemy in front of the whole Pentecostal assembly, whereupon the Holy Spirit began to speak through her and led her out of that church with eleven followers (herself being the twelfth apostle), to found in 1940 a small congregation initially named “The Free Church.” A subsequent series of visions signaled the spot, in the middle of metropolitan San Juan, for the “Temple of Mita” that was to become, in 1949, the seat of the growing cult (the near-by Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit being only a coincidence).\n\nA unique theology would set the Mita apart from Christian sects, as a new religious movement.2 Following an ancient church dogma regarding the Trinity, Mita theology divides universal history in three eras: that of Jehovah, God the Father, acting through His prophets; that of Christ, God the Son, acting through Jesus of Nazareth; and that of the Holy Spirit, God the Mother, whose newly revealed name is “Mita,” acting through the person of Mita (Juanita García) and, lately, through her prophet Aarón. As “Christ” was the revealed name of God acting through the person of Jesus of Nazareth, the faithful distinguish between “Mita” (God, Spirit of Life) and the “person of Mita” (the woman born in 1897, deceased in 1970). Indeed, after the person of Mita died, the faithful were stricken by fears that the congregation might fragment or dissolve. Then Aarón, anointed 30 years earlier, became infused with the Holy Spirit and spoke thus after their return from the funeral: “It is I, Mita. I have not forsaken you.” Mita is said to live in Aarón much like Jehovah lived in his prophets and Christ in Jesus. Hence, the mystery ciphered in the phrase “Mita en Aarón” which marks the doors of the chosen.\n\nThus, while Jehovah created the world in an act of love, and Christ’s redemption brought freedom from sin, the work of Mita, the Holy Spirit on earth, is to gather the herd, the dispersed children of God. Hence, the three pillars of the Mita religion: Love, Freedom, and Unity. “The Mita” (as they call themselves) do recognize the divinity and teachings of Christ, for they hold that Christ, the God of Abraham, and Mita are all the same person, “Mita” being only the last revealed name for the ultimate dispensation in God’s universal plan. Much like Christ superseded Jehovah, the Mita, nonetheless, see the teachings of Christ as pertaining to a bygone era of human history. They constitute, so to speak, a “post-Christian” religion. Purportedly, a new era has begun –by coincidence or not– on the eve of a new millennium.\n\nThis positively hopeful idea of a new beginning distinguishes the Mita from the many charismatic sects which share the apocalyptic view that the end is near, that these are times of reckoning with the impending second coming of Christ and Judgment Day. For Mita’s followers, the work of the Holy Spirit on earth has just begun. Yet, this is different from the Adventist belief in the Millennium of righteousness promised in Revelation, which some believe will precede, and others that it will follow, the second coming of Christ (Miller). For the Mita, the second coming has already occurred, precisely, in Mita herself. They claim that traditional Christians have misread the Scriptures, that Christ did say he would return, but not in the same form, not in the person of Jesus. They quote John 14-16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask my Father, and he will give you another Comforter to be with you forever” (14.16); “But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom my Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of everything which I tell you” (14.26); “It is better for you that I should go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I should go, I will send him to you (16.7); “I have many other things to tell you, but you cannot grasp them now. But when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak from himself, but what he hears he will speak; and he will make known to you all that is to come” (16.12,13). The Mita find evidence that God would in fact return in the form of a woman, in verses such as Revelation 12.1,2: “And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.” That woman is interpreted as the person of Mita, in her role as God the Mother.\n\nThe Virgin Mary, who enjoys a preeminent role as an advocate in the Catholic tradition, plays no part among the Mita, who consider her an instrument of God whose role was fulfilled in the times of Christ. They pray to Mita herself, with no advocates or mediation. When they heard Mita speak, as when they hear Aarón today, the faithful hear the Holy Spirit directly, not just an interpreter of the Scriptures who urges them to believe in deeds that happened over two millennia ago. This sense of immediacy, of the sheer presence of God today before them, is difficult to overestimate as a most powerful allure of the Mita cult. The thousands who knew her feel as spiritually fulfilled as if they had shaken hands with the Virgin or with Jesus himself, both of whom have in a sense been replaced with the presence of Mita, in the spiritual imaginary of the people. The same sense of immediacy is reflected in every aspect of their cult. Their temples bear no images, no saints, no cross, except the photographs of Mita and Aarón. They practice no symbolic rituals or sacraments. Baptism has been long discontinued, since they believe that the faithful are baptized by hearing the living word, which is also their Communion. Even marriage is seen as a civil institution left to a justice of the peace, after which the newly-weds come to Aarón for a blessing.3 Large numbers of believers have come to Mita through an immediate personal vision or revelation they call “life experiences,” or through miraculous healings from AIDS, leukemia, and other infirmities. Of their three weekly services offered from 7:00 to 9:30 pm, Tuesdays are devoted to the youth, Thursdays to testimonials of such “life experiences” brought forth by dozens from the audience, while on Saturdays Aarón speaks prophecy and performs acts of healing. The age of miracle and wonder continues today as in Biblical times, for the Mita live and interpret their daily lives, as well as world events, in constant parallels to the ancient deeds and prophecies of the Scriptures.\n\n“Social scientists, following assumptions rooted in Marx and Durkheim, tend to study religion solely in terms of its fulfilling a certain social function. In so doing, they neglect its popular and informal expressions outside the mainstream” (Peterson 237). While I will consider the congregation’s socio-economic structure, I first wish to look at its cultural function, in terms of what it contributes to the individual and what it tells us about its host society, the popular classes of Latin America and the Caribbean. If one thing has become evident to me in my study of the Mita, it is its spontaneous popular character. This is not a phenomenon that can be replicated at will, but one which is “naturally” born out of specific cultural circumstances, which it at once reflects. Thus, the Mita cult offers a unique opportunity to study the origins and growth of a religion which is both recent and mostly home-spun. While it maintains traits of its Pentecostal origins, it owes nothing to the wave of Latin American Protestant missions issuing from the United States in recent years. The Mita call themselves “the only truly Puerto Rican religion,” while at the same time affirming its universal character among Latin Americans and U.S. Hispanics. Within these cultural parameters, I am particularly interested in two things: the matriarchal origins of the cult and the utopian underpinnings of its current social mission.\n\nThe motherly aspect of the Goddess Mita undoubtedly exercises a powerful attraction. Women have reason to feel vindicated in a society often portrayed as machista, where both Catholic and Protestant traditions have equally denied them a place in the hierarchy. But men too have gained something, as both genders learn to relate to the divinity as mother. This relationship calls to mind Octavio Paz’ cultural analysis in The Labyrinth of Solitude (1950), where he observes that a sense of orphanhood, of having been torn from the origin, from the divine womb, is the preeminent existential condition of modern man, and particularly of the poor and the colonized, twice torn: first from their indigenous gods and, after Independence, from the tutelage of Catholic Spain, the mother country, by the empty promises of the civil state.\n\nCertainly, the figure of Mita has parallels in the non-Western tradition of the Caribbean, such as with the Taino Indian matron, Anacaona, or with the neo-African water deity, Yemayá, variously represented in syncretic Western symbols as a mermaid and as the Virgin. Regardless of its origin and explanation, matriarchal spiritual authority, acting overtly or latently under a patriarchal material structure, has a strong prevalence in Latin American societies. The figure of Mita taps into this cultural source, the religious substrate of its host communities being its only link to indigenous and neo-African traditions.4 Theologically, however, the cult of Mita issues entirely from the Judeo-Christian biblical tradition, and its closest analog remains the (displaced) figure of the Virgin Mary. Hence the parallels: the distinctive “M” anagram, the annunciation of the Holy Spirit, the shooting star reminiscent of Bethlehem, and the expectant woman with the moon under her feet from the Revelation of Saint John which traditionally belonged to the Catholic iconography of the Virgin.\n\nIndeed, Mita’s immediate precursor was the enigmatic Catholic figure of Mother Elenita, a beautiful young woman who appeared in the mountains of Puerto Rico when the person of Mita was only a child. Hundreds of disciples affirmed that Mother Elenita was the Virgen del Carmen, patroness of Puerto Rico. But this was no plain apparition, for Elenita actually lived in the mountains for 10 years, between 1899 and 1909, preaching and performing miracles of healing. She initially lived as a hermit under a rock; then in a hut built for her by neighbors. Memorial chapels were later erected near the site. Her origin, family, and real name are unknown. Some claimed that she washed ashore on a wooden plank after the San Ciriaco hurricane devastated the island in 1899, although I suspect this may be an assimilation of the Yoruba water deity, Yemayá, since there were several families of former coffee plantation slaves who lived around Elenita’s “holy mountain.” The young woman died of “weakness” (probably malnutrition) and was buried in 1909. Toward her final days she distributed locks of hair and other relics to the faithful. Years later, an ecclesiastical investigation attempting to exhume her remains found that her body had disappeared (Reyes).\n\nElenita identified herself as “Thy Mother Redeemer” –a daring title which anticipated the personal revelations received by Maria Valtorta in Italy during the 1940’s. Accordingly, the Virgin Mary is said to be the co-Redeemer and, perhaps, even the agent of the second coming (Valtorta). But the roots of these Puerto Rican phenomena go way back. Mariolatry, the “divinization” of the Virgin, has been a notorious trait of folk Catholicism in Spain since the Middle Ages, sanctioned at times by the official church (Miller). In the Spanish colonies, Mariolatry was strengthened not only by syncretism with indigenous and neo-African female deities. Spanish settlers experienced a severe absence of white women with which to establish a European descendance (and, hence, their very legitimacy) in the New World. This led to a fetishization of woman in her role as mother, which –sublimated from a genetic to a spiritual plane– served to reinforce the cult of Mary. The legitimacy for Spanish colonial rule continued to rest solely on this spiritual claim, the conversion of the heathen. Unable to provide them genetically with a white mother, the Spaniards did so symbolically and spiritually, by instilling in the “orphan” Indians and mestizos the veneration for the Virgin Mother which, after all, ran so deep within Spanish religiosity. In time, a syncretic iconography would develop, as in the cult of the mestizo Virgen de Guadalupe, revered in Mexico since the 16th Century, and honored in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where a cathedral was erected in her name.\n\nAgain, regardless of origin and explanation, the “divinization” of the Virgin is a fact of folk Catholicism repudiated by Protestant sects. Thus, the arrival of Pentecostalism to Catholic Latin America, as experienced by the person of Mita herself, signified for the converts a new orphanhood: the loss of the quasi-divine mother figure of the Virgin they had been raised to revere. It is this void that the figure of Mita has filled and perfected, by replacing the symbol with the person, the advocate with the judge, and the “unlawful” worship of the woman with the “legitimate” worship of the goddess. For the rest, Mita, the Mother, supplied that important dimension in the anthropomorphic conception of God, which had been missing in the Judeo-Christian patriarchal tradition, completing the Father-Son-Mother triangulation suggested in the hypostatic union of the Trinity.\n\nSignificantly, if one follows Octavio Paz’ concept of historical orphanhood, Mita’s birth (1897) and Elenita’s apparition (1899) coincide with Puerto Rico’s loss of her mother country in the Spanish-American war of 1898. The orphan island’s relationship with her North American stepmother, not always a smooth one, need not be recounted here. It suffices to say that adapting to the tutelage of a predominantly Protestant foreign power, its culture and language, meant a certain loss and confusion of identity. The transition years were marked by social anarchy, as administrative control proved slow and ineffectual beyond the capital city. The ministry of Catholic priests, who traditionally had come from Spain, declined sharply after political ties were severed and administrative support from the church became increasingly difficult. Thus, as her biographers point out, Mother Elenita appeared at a time when the Puerto Rican countryside had been “spiritually abandoned” to moral anarchy (Santaella, Reyes). The island needed a spiritual mother, its very own Virgen del Carmen, but Elenita’s holiness was never recognized by the Roman Catholic church. Her cult virtually died with her. In turn, Mita prevailed as redeemer from social and spiritual orphanhood. Far from a hermit, she was a gifted organizer who recognized early on the importance of moving to the capital city and, later, of expanding to New York, following the Puerto Rican diaspora.\n\nThus, while Protestantism spread in the island’s countryside and Catholic parishes retreated to city affluence, Mita, rather masterfully, found a niche among the urban working class. As I walked now through my old neighborhood, the familiar landmarks became icons, vessels of time, in a semiotic map which told a story all too easy to read. Behind the outline of the old Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit, one can see the skyline of the nearby Hato Rey banking district which once flourished alongside Floral Park. In the opposite direction, after two blocks of aging houses, one finds my old Catholic school of the Holy Spirit, now completely fenced-in, “bunkerized” against inner city elements. Another two blocks and one arrives at the old boundary, América Street, my old street; then, on the other side, as a sort of mirror image, come the smaller houses of the Mita, leading to the new magnificent temple, surrounded by congregation businesses and the Mita school. To the right, the oldest section of Cantera, small turn-of-the-century dwellings of what was then the middle class, now fit only for the poor. Down across Barbosa Avenue, yet another layer of poverty: the tenements of squatters who eventually received property deeds from the government under one of those amnesties which were common near election time. How these layers came to be is the subject of René Marqués’ famous play, The Oxcart: as San Juan began to embody the promise of modernity, the peasants left the fields and began to swell the city slums. First came the landless, then the dispossessed who could not pay their taxes, then the hungry who sold cheap to both native and foreign opportunists. Many stayed in the slums, many went to Spanish Harlem, but many rose to the fast-growing San Juan working class, from which Mita drew her constituency. For some, the Mita congregation was a way out of poverty.\n\nMita arrived in San Juan in 1949, with the wheels of change: growth, industrialization, modernity, and rural exodus. The U. S. military occupation of the first quarter century had led to the Platt Amendment protectorate in the second quarter, with its bizarre form of limited colonial democracy, and a political stability which primed the island for economic growth after the Great Depression. But the 1940’s saw the formation of the Commonwealth, the modern Puerto Rican “Free Associated State,” a political middle ground between independence and full statehood, which made possible an attractive economic formula: no federal taxes and full state tax exemption for industry. It was during this time that Floral Park became established and that a Catholic mission from the U.S. came to develop the parish church and school of the Holy Spirit. In the meantime, the turn-of-the-century middle class moved to newer and bigger homes, making space for some newcomers. The Mita congregation grew with the working class, and became an echelon in the social layers that went from the countryside, to the tenements, to Cantera, to Floral Park, and beyond. Mita had become such a prominent figure, that the founder of the modern Commonwealth and long-time governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, often came to visit her and seek her advice.\n\nAs Floral Park aged and became more affordable for the prosperous Mita, the old boundary began to break down. Today, several houses with the distinctive “M” on the door can be seen spotting the semiotic map on the Catholic side. This is not merely an economic crossover. Traditionally, the Puerto Rican working class had been much closer to the poor, separated from the middle and upper classes by a sharper boundary that was not only economic, but cultural, racial, educational, and even religious. Many factors of modernity have since made this boundary less rigid; but in any case, the Mita crossover can be considered a social one, in the broadest sense. While the congregation remains anchored in the working class, it now has members from all walks of life.\n\nAs soon as Mita found her niche among the urban working class, she quickly addressed the material needs of the community. Social activism has been common among Pentecostal and other religious communities in Latin America (Boudewijnse et al.; Levine; Haynes; Loreto). Yet, Mita went a step further, organizing her followers socio-economically into a cooperative. This mixture of religion and business is often criticized by Catholics. The once politically powerful Catholic Church, excluded from state business since the 19th Century, has maintained a policy of limited socio-economic involvement in parish life. Latin American liberation theology, which has had to wage a philosophical battle with the Catholic Church for decades in order to justify its social activism, has never taken solid root in Puerto Rico (Silva). Yet, the Mita congregation takes care of both worldly and spiritual affairs in a parallel and pragmatic fashion, allowing a time and a place for each. As long as business, politics, and other “facts of life” remain outside the temple, they see no contradiction. They do not preach a liberation theology nor any social reform beyond their own community. They do not even criticize the social system nor support “in block” any political party or particular agenda. Thus, they feel no need to reconcile the eternal and temporal aspects of salvation or to justify their involvement in both. Aarón has continued this philosophy and led the congregation through 25 years of impressive growth. His international ministry operates through a non-hierarchical network of anointed pastors, sharing the same rank and significantly called “workers,” all of whom hold regular jobs whether in congregation businesses or in society at large. Even Aarón himself has a dual role: when he is not ministering as a prophet, he is presiding over the board of directors of Congregación Mita, Inc., the holding company for a diversified array of cooperative ventures.\n\nA look at the types of businesses the congregation has established through the years shows a long-term planning whose strategy is clearly that of community self-sufficiency. Their inland farms and cattle ranches supplement the name brands in the congregation’s supermarket, drugstore, and community restaurant. Their cinder block factory, hardware store, and furniture outlet–plus residential real estate holdings which include a modern apartment building and dozens of single family homes– address construction and housing needs. Shoe and garment workshops supply the congregation’s own department store, which also handles uniforms and school supplies. The rank and file, who began by putting their paychecks together, now share in the profits. They have access to congregation housing, jobs, and dividends, as well as financing, venture capital, and insurance through their own credit union. Their community outreach center is staffed with professional nurses and social workers from their own ranks, providing primary health and counseling services to the community, including programs against drugs, alcohol, and smoking, all of which are outlawed by the Mita. An “orientation office” coordinates social, educational, and charitable events, as well as public relations. Indeed, the congregation provides a lifetime of services and ties to the community, from a modern school for the children to a high-rise nursing home for the elderly. The diverse array of stores, offices, and buildings, surrounding the Temple along Duarte and Los Mitas Streets, gives the community a sense of cohesion and autonomy. Yet, these are only the more visible signs of a socio-economic fabric in which a myriad of goods and services are exchanged informally as well, in the marketplace, through flyers, advertisements, bulletin boards, and personal contacts.\n\nThis unique congregation, intent on carrying out God’s work on earth, does not segregate itself from society as utopian communities do. Instead, it has succeeded in forming a semi-autonomous network in a modern urban setting, remaining spiritually, socially, and economically integrated, and yet with no visible boundaries of its own (except, perhaps, the all-white dress code still adhered to during services by the more devout). There are no fences, no “bunkerization” of public buildings; rather, volunteer guards in plain civilian clothes patrol the neighborhood. The neatness of the buildings, the meticulous upkeep, the evident communal pride for what they have built out of very humble origins, mark the only true physical separation from the neighboring neglect of the adjacent streets and congested thoroughfares of this poorer section of metropolitan San Juan. Their social organization may indeed be described as a non-insular utopian cluster, one which has clearly empowered a formerly disenfranchised community.\n\nThe word on the Catholic side is now: “As soon as they join the Mita, you see them prosper” –a comment suggesting they join for the money, not the soul. The Mita simply claim they endeavor to live like primitive Christians. There is, however, nothing primitive in their strategies. Their original San Juan community serves as a developmental model for the newer congregations abroad which, in turn, communicate with the center through all modern media. Active members have swollen to over 30,000 world-wide. The new San Juan temple alone seats 6,000; but actually the largest following is in Colombia, which has now surpassed Puerto Rico as a whole; the Dominican Republic ranks third, with 65 congregations.\n\nIn the face of increasing institutionalization, it remains to be seen what will happen to the cult’s allure: the sense of immediacy and hopeful new beginnings, the mother figure’s deliverance from orphanhood, the empowerment of the poor –and, of course, the issue of Aarón’s succession.5 I posed these questions to minister-worker Ramón Díaz Reyes in a two-hour meeting. He said that, man or woman –for the Holy Spirit of God has no gender– Mita’s next heir would not be picked by a council, a bureaucracy, or other human institution, but by a sign of divine revelation. It seems, however, that just like religious fervor has been good for business, fostering loyalty and spurring productivity, so will the sheer material force of their socio-economic fabric ensure the spiritual cohesion and continuity of their cult. Brother Ramón simplified it for me: “We are a simple, happy people. We live in plenitude and face the new millennium without fear.”\n\nNotes\n\nThe Mita subscribe to a version of the Bible based on ancient Eastern manuscripts in Spanish translation. All biblical quotations in this paper have been adapted from the corresponding English edition by G. M. Lamsa. The Mita’s only written account of their own history and doctrines is a book independently produced by Carmín Cruz, a member of the congregation. Besides this, they have produced no official body of writings; rather, they continue to rely on the leader’s inspiration and the preaching of the “living” word. return to text\n\nAside from its unique theology, the cult’s formative process resembles that of many Pentecostal congregations in Puerto Rico, in which a leader claiming divine inspiration interprets the Scriptures with great latitude and breaks away to form a new Pentecostal assembly based on personal charisma. The difference with Mita is that she claimed to be God herself, not just an inspired interpreter. This process suggests that the rapid growth of Pentecostalism throughout Latin America constitutes a fertile ground for what is technically referred to as new religious movements. return to text\n\nReactions to the Mita are strong among neighboring Catholics I interviewed. First of all, they consider blasphemous their dismissal of the Virgin Mary, and sacrilegious their lax attitude toward holy sacraments, particularly marriage. Claims of immorality range from criticism of Mita’s family life as a divorced woman opportunistically devoted to her cult while her own children grew astray, to rumors that Aarón sexually initiated maidens to be married. “God help them!” –says Sylvia Juarbe, Minister of the Eucharist for the Catholic parish. “Their whole creed is an apostasy. I pray for them.” return to text\n\nThe strongest connection with the autochthonous religious substrate may be found in the analogous beliefs of Mita’s and Aarón’s infusion by the Holy Spirit, and the Pentecostal tradition of “speaking in tongues,” inasmuch as these resemble the beliefs surrounding trance and possession in Afro-Caribbean cults, where deities are said to “come down upon” and “ride” an inspired or possessed faithful. The latter tradition may have been instrumental in lending popular credibility to Mita’s and Aarón’s personal agency for the Holy Spirit (cf. Beckmann). return to text\n\nIt is worth noting that, at age 75, Aarón is still associated with that young boy Mita anointed in the 1930’s. The faithful often refer to him as “Aaroncito” (Little Aarón), as though he was one more of Mita’s children. While the next Prophet has not yet been revealed, it is plausible that he or she will be similarly regarded, so as to preserve the matriarchal aspect of the cult. return to text\n\nArticle II\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nEsquilín, M.

Although the Prologue was written in 1949, others had already used similar terms to speak of the Caribbean2, but none met the fortune that Carpentier’s term would, perhaps because the immediate application of the theory was to be found in his novel. The term has become as artificial and clichéd as the stifled Surrealism the Cuban novelist was denouncing, and one hesitates to employ it when referring to today’s literary works from the Caribbean because their diversity and their scope do not allow for such reductionistic labels.\n\nIn Carpentier’s novel, Haitian reality as seen through the conflation of European rhetorical forms with Haitian folklore, créole, and religious beliefs, becomes a text obsessed with a historical accuracy constantly undermined by events which reason or logic alone cannot explain. Thanks to the novels of the boom and the post-boom, magical realism becomes an internationally acclaimed and hence accepted artistic means through which critics try to categorize Latin America’s problematic and complex representation of reality. To Carpentier’s concluding rhetorical question: “¿Pero qué es la historia de América toda sino una crónica de lo real-maravilloso?” (13) [But what is the history of all America if not a chronicle of magic realism], the works of two well-known novelists such as Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende seem to offer the obvious response: “America” as a text is based on historical events and remains as wondrous as when Christopher Columbus first described the Caribbean world to the Europeans–a chronicle of facts mixed with the fables of a Genovese.\n\nNo matter how much Caribbean authors try to shake off the chains of realism and veracity, with few exceptions, many seek a base or starting point which is verifiable, measurable, provable and not just probable: revolutions, invasions, American presence, human rights violations, slavery and its horrors, among other themes or situations. Some Caribbean writers still feel the duty of transmitting a teaching, (Horace’s utile), and, in the case of the mediocre ones, forget to focus on the enjoyment of the writing (Horace’s dulce). Their role is fraught with responsibilities because they are called to give a voice to the voiceless, denounce corruption, effect a change in the way people think, and establish a viable definition of the Caribbean in spite of the geographical, linguistic, and racial differences, just to mention some of the alienating factors. Who then reads the novels and decides that they are useful or didactic? Those who are capable of it: the educated, the literate, the elite, and those in exile. For the most part, our literature is still judged by standards set by readers and critics trained in an Aristotelian tradition whose criteria extoll mimesis or imitation and are based on tragedy. Our writers find themselves trying to capture the elusive essence of Caribbean identity and the coming together of various races and cultures within the rigid critical parameters of the “European Other.”\n\nIn the case of Caribbean authors, in whose works there is great linguistic and cultural diversity, there are some who defy these standards and redefine them, such as Marie (Vieux) Chauvet (Haiti), Myriam Warner-Vieyra (Guadeloupe), and Ana Lydia Vega (Puerto Rico), who attempt to transcend this “magico-realist” mode by undermining it or parodying by bringing to the forefront the fact that there is another important aspect at work that Édouard Glissant terms “natural” poetics, and which he defines as follows: “J’appelle poétique libre, ou naturelle, toute tension collective vers une expression, et qui ne s’oppose à elle-même ni au niveau de ce qu’elle veut exprimer ni au niveau du langage qu’elle met en œuvre” (236) [I define as a free or natural poetics any collective yearning for expression that is not opposed to itself either at the level of what it wishes to express or at the level of the language that it puts into practice]. This poetic is the counterweight of a “forced” poetics defined by him as follows: “J’appelle poétique forcée, ou contrainte, toute tension collective vers une expression qui, se posant, s’oppose du même coup le manque par quoi elle devient impossible, non tant que tension, toujours présente, mais en tant qu’expression, jamais accomplie” (236) [I define forced or constrained poetics as any collective desire for expression that, when it manifests itself, is negated at the same time because of the deficiency that stifles it, not at the level of desire, which never ceases, but at the level of the expression, which is never realized]. According to Glissant, Caribbean identity as presented in literary discourse is the result of the tension between “natural” and “forced” poetics. This tension is parallel to that which Carpentier felt between the “marvelous” and the “real.” Carpentier strives to maintain an equilibrium while conferring primacy to the “realist” or mimetic or forced; whereas Glissant advises writers to search for the fluidity, the heart-felt expression capable of eliciting an affective reaction from the reader, in a language closest to that spoken by the reader; in other words, the natural, the créole, the popular speech, or a non academic one. He therefore also advocates the notion of créolisation because for him, this concept alludes to a process and not a fait accompli. As Daniel Racine clarifies, Glissant’s “message is to invite [all Caribbean] people to take pride in and preserve the beauty of their country against any kind of mutilation, to enjoy the richness of their culture, to communicate in the language they have built together, to claim their right to difference based on their specificities, and to think in terms of unity and independence” (625).\n\nCorroborating Glissant’s emphasis on the lyrical/oral language as a distinctive component of Caribbean literature, comparative poetics theorist Earl Miner defines the effect of this literature on the reader as a crucial marker of an affective-expressive tradition which he traces through Japan and China but which one can just as well see at work in Caribbean literature together with the one proposed by Aristotle, to which it owes much. Miner “[has termed] this lyric-based poetics affective-expressive because they presume that a poet is moved by experience or observation to give expression in words, and that that expression is the cause of moving the listener or reader” (24-25). Miner explains that, on the one hand, there is a dominant tradition, the Aristotelian or mimetic, based on the hegemony of tragedy, which is unique in the world precisely for being the only one whose poetics is based on drama, and which of course is mostly Western. While, on the other hand, the rest of the world’s poetics stem from a lyrical production, its conceptualization, and its reception. Both poetics are certainly present in the Caribbean, yet critical approaches are often subsumed to the mimetic lexicon, i.e., reality, depiction, representation. This is contrary to the literary texts themselves which exploit the dichotomy with verve and oftentimes humor, precisely because of the incorporation of the various vernaculars, in turn moving the readers precisely because of the orality. As a reader of Caribbean works, one is best advised to avoid such rigid schematic polarities, however, at the critical offset it is perhaps appropriate to frame the discussion as a juxtaposition because of the vibrancy the tension bestows.\n\nClarification of the notion of “Caribbean identity” may be gained through the study of literary texts exploring these poetic configurations (the Aristotelian, the affective-expressive, and the Glissantian as the Caribbean synthesis of the two) because today’s Caribbean literature develops within the interstices of the tension between the natural or affective-expressive and the forced or mimetic Aristotelian. Focus on the interplay of the two poles is essential in the unraveling of this literary yarn for it will prove useful in how we figure out or redefine the place of Caribbean literature within world literature, taking into account the various degrees of tension which in turn generate a wide-ranging spectrum of identities, all of which are complementary and syncretic and not necessarily antagonistic. The study of the Caribbean’s literatures is often set at the periphery of either Latin American literature (in the case of the Spanish Caribbean); of the French as part of the “Francophone” (as in the case of Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe), or of the English (as part of “Commonwealth” literature).\n\nFollowing this reasoning, crucial to the redefinition of the Caribbean(s), this part of the analysis focuses on two novels, one by Marie (Vieux) Chauvet and the other by Myriam Warner-Vieyra, because theirs are texts which offer an embryonic attempt at denouncing and undoing a quasi-sacred and forced literary canon established by critics informed by the Aristotelian poetics. In order to redefine the notion of Caribbean, these authors desecrate some of the tenets respected by a critical literary tradition usually dominated by male voices. Glissant reminds us that to be an “Antillean” is not a demeaning condition but rather a fruitful process of synthesis. These two novelists contribute to the transformation which needs to occur. As “Antilleans” they have understood as well as Glissant has that the process of:\n\nla synthèse n’est pas l’opération d’abâtardissement qu’on [leur] disait, mais pratique féconde par quoi les composantes s’enrichissent. [Elles sont devenu]es antillais[es]. L’idée de l’unité antillaise est reconnue culturelle. Elle nous réinstalle dans la vérité de notre être, elle milite pour notre émancipation. C’est une idée qui ne peut pas être prise en compte pour nous, par d’autres: l’unité antillaise ne peut pas être téléguidée. (18)\n\nsynthesis is not a process of bastardization as he used to be told, but a productive activity through which each element is enriched. He has become Caribbean . . . The notion of Caribbean unity is a form of cultural self-discovery. It fixes us in the truth of our existence, it forms part of the struggle for self-liberation. It is a concept that cannot be managed for us by others: Caribbean unity cannot be guided by remote control.\n\nTo be an Antillean is a becoming, a process, the synthesis of diverse components, and Antillean unity can be considered as a cultural construct which will reach its culmination or evolution when we, the Antilleans, understand it as such. No one, except people from the Antilles, can attain this unity of thought. It cannot come from the outside imposed by others. It is not to be the vision of the Other, but of ourselves–and yes, indeed it includes the paradoxes brought about by the history of colonization. Glissant underscores the idea of process through aquatic figures whose fluidity and lack of fixed structure would fully represent this process of becoming Antillean [or what Leví Marrero, Cuban geographer and historian has baptized as “la antillanía” (228-29)]. Within this poetic process, then, one may ask what is the role of the woman novelist? How is she to reconcile the forced and the natural poetics if she faces the added dilemma of discrimination based on gender? What language should she employ to express a female “Antilleanness,” and how is such an epistemic notion determined? The forced poetics to which Glissant alludes is even more forced in the case of Caribbean women writers, who not only have to prove their ability at synthesizing but also allow their own reconfiguration of the canon to be understood. Women writers of the Caribbean used to be caught in a virtual literary no man’s land which many have since playfully and antonomastically understood to be a “woman’s land,” for so long has the colonized land been metaphorically interchangeable with a woman’s body. What better place then than Caribbean women’s writing to explore the synthesis and interplay of voices?\n\nPrecisely, in Caribbean writings, tension is apparent in the use of fragmented structures and languages which coexist in the same text. Dialogism in Caribbean literature is the epistemological result of the syncretism of such a heteroglossic world. Novels, for the most part, are the products of authors who desire to find through their writing the perfect representation of the much-sough-after rupture with their respective metropolis, on the one hand, and on the other with the négritude movement as Aimé Césaire preached it; and to which many Caribbean writers, critics, and intellectuals have been attracted. If all of this is true, then it is important for Caribbean women writers to penetrate that sacrosanct space of Caribbean male narrative in order to desecrate it. It is in women’s writings then that we often find the “natural” counter-poetic response contained in the forced one that male writers have imposed on women writers. The interplay of these voices “orchestrates . . . the totality of the world of objects and ideas depicted and expressed in [the novels], by means of the social diversity of speech types . . . and by the differing individual voices that flourish under such conditions” (263). Ana Lydia Vega adds her voice to the debate when she comments on the double standard imposed on women. The criticisms and concerns she voices for Puerto Rican women writers can be applied to Caribbean women writers in general: “además de Salvar la Patria, Afirmar la Cultura en Crisis y Acelerar el Advenimiento de la Gran Aurora Popular con la mayor originalidad y dentro de la mayor ortodoxia posible, se le pide también que a cada tacleteo de máquina denuncie la Vil Opresión Machista, variante algo risqué de la querida lucha de clases. ¡No, si hasta en la literatura nos persigue la doble tarea!” (“Sálvese” 86) [besides Saving the Country, Affirming the Culture in Crisis and accelerating the Advent of the Great Popular Dawn with the greatest originality and within the greatest possible orthodoxy, (women) are asked to denounce the Vile Machista Oppression with every key stroke of the typewriter, which is a risqué variation of the beloved class struggle. No, even in literature this double task pursues us!].\n\nUpon a first approach neither Chauvet’s nor Warner-Vieyra’s novels, offers the impression that either fragmentation or structural innovation are important to them, but as the reader is affected by the texts, these provide evidence that there is a careful and perspicacious infiltration and transformation of the forced male poetics through the consciousness of the protagonists of the novels, Amour (1968) and Juletane (1982) respectively. Manipulation of the reader’s notion of poetics subtly leads to a configuration of the Caribbean woman writer’s role in the redefinition of Caribbean identity.\n\nIn Chauvet’s case, Amour is the first novel of a tryptic whose complete title is Amour, Colère, Folie–three novels published by Gallimard in one volume, but which are independent of each other. Amour’s plot begins in 1939 and develops in a Haitian province under Sténio Vincent’s presidency, although all the allusions are to the dictatorial regime of François Duvalier and his tonton macoutes. The heroine, Claire, is the eldest of the three orphaned daughters of the Clamont couple. She is single and still a virgin at thirty-nine; lives with her sisters, Félicia, eight years younger and married to Jean Luze, a White Frenchman; and Annette, twenty-two years old, who ends up being Jean Luze’s lover. Claire’s name is ironic because, as other critics have noted (Dayan, Gouraige, and Hoffmann), she has the darkest skin, which explains why she is an old maid: her skin color reminds her “aristocratic” family that in spite of their fair skin, Black blood runs through their veins. Violence, deaths, and rapes for political reasons increase around them. But as people of a certain class, they pretend to see neither the U.S. exploitation perpetrated symbolically by Mr. Long (U.S. troops had occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934 and were there for economic reasons) nor the persecutions committed by the Black Commander Calédu (whose name in créole means “who hits hard”) to protect “national security.” In reality, these are retributions sought by a Black man to avenge all the sufferings he had experienced because he was poor and Black in Haiti. It is not a coincidence either that the story starts in 1939 because from the perspective of the late 60s (when it was published) an era punctuated by various revolutions–sexual, academic, Civil rights, Cuban–this date marks a sobering realization of the fragility of a world threatened by another world war whose tragic consequences force the intelligentsia of small countries to question the values proposed by the hegemony of an occidental culture which appears to disintegrate in front of their eyes and whose diplomacy or rhetoric did not solve misunderstandings or help generate tolerance to differences either in 1939 or at the present. One must not forget this when trying to understand what Chauvet rebels against. Even though Haiti is no longer a political colony of France, its literature continues to be partially indebted to it. Therefore, what is the place that Chauvet, a Haitian woman writer, is looking for in 1968? Perhaps the recognition of being a writer.\n\nThe novel is Claire’s first-person diary and describes how her conscience “clears” itself as she surmises the motives of the other characters from her bedroom, metonymic space of her mind. What she does not want to avow in public–that she desires her sister’s husband, transgressing all sorts of taboos–becomes evident every time Claire goes into her room and masturbates mentally. The intensity of the passion of her sexual urges incorporates the reader into this double textual/sexual game of voyeurs, making us feel as though she is actually masturbating. In that same bedroom, she plays with her doll as if it were a daughter and even tries to breast-feed her. She also amuses herself with pornographic postcards; according to her, she already knows about perfect coitus because she knows by heart Lady Chatterly’s Lover text; and as if this were not enough, she “rolls” in Félicia’s and Jean-Luze’s sheets to enjoy the semen and the sweat of their nights of love-making.\n\nWhat the reader wants to know is why this dark-skinned woman living in an old big house in a province in Haiti, meddling in the destinies of her sisters, would want to write a diary. What Claire describes at the onset of the novel is revealing of her state of mind when she puts pen to paper and writes:\n\nJ’assiste au drame, scène après scène, effacée comme une ombre . . . Je savoure en tout cas ma vengeance en silence. C’est mon silence, ma vengeance. . . . .Aux dires du Père Paul, je me suis empoisonné l’esprit en m’instruisant. Mon intelligence sommellait et je l’ai reveillée, voilà la vérité. De là l’idée de ce journal. Je me suis découvert des dons insoupçonnés. Je crois pouvoir écrire. Je crois pouvoir penser. Je suis devenue arrogante. J’ai pris conscience de moi. Réduire ma vie intérieure à la mesure de l’oeil, voilà mon but. La noble tâche! Y arriverai-je? Parler de moi c’est facile. Je n’ai qu’à mentir beaucoup tout en me persuadant que je note juste. Je vais m’essayer à la sincérité : la solitude m’a aigrie . . . Nous voilà contaminés par ce que l’on nomme civilisation. (9-11)\n\nI am present at the drama, scene after scene, hidden in the shadows . . . In any case, I savor my revenge in silence, it is my silence, my revenge . . . According to Father Paul, I have poisoned my spirit through my learning. My intelligence was dozing and I awoke it, that’s the truth. From there came the idea of the diary. I discovered I had an unsuspected gift. I believe I can write. I believe I can think. I have become arrogant. I have become aware of myself. Reducing my interior life to the measure of the eye, that’s my goal. A noble task! Will I complete it? Speaking about myself is easy. I only have to lie a lot while persuading myself that I got it right. I will try my hand at sincerity: solitude makes me bitter . . . We are contaminated by what is called civilization.\n\nIn the opening pages of her diary, Claire attacks the entire edifice of Western poetics. She begins at the base with the allusion to drama, nucleus of Aristotelian poetics, emphasizing the fact that for the time being she “assiste au drame”; she presents herself as a simple spectator/observer and as a woman she waits in silence to carry out her vengeance, because when she chooses to speak and stop being one of the spectators of the drama, and become one of its authors, she will occupy a place in the literary world and on a stage unimagined by Aristotle and those who espouse his views on literature. Moreover, “assister” in French has another connotation: “to help,” by which Claire may be implying that from her room she can help in the production of the drama. Chauvet’s character is no longer simply an actress or a spectator but is also an author and to heighten her role as an innovator, she authors a narrative fiction, a genre to which Aristotle does nor confer much critical importance in his Poetics and which to our day still generates debates among critics as to its place in the literary hierarchy. Because narrative is ironically still difficult to classify, Claire has great liberty to spool the yarn of the plot: she manipulates Annette and directs her to Jean Luze’s conquest. Claire will also be responsible for the “liberation” of her town. In the aforementioned quote, there is also mention of the Catholic church and the important role it plays in Haiti. The priest or “père” prefers ignorance to instruction in women and his name “Paul” resonates of the apostle Paul’s name, probably the most misogynist of the writers of the New Testament. Claire, as an author, faces undeterred two of the most formidable fathers of the Western Judeo-Christian tradition: Aristotle and Saint Paul.\n\nHer profanation of the canon continues with the veiled parody of French philosophical authors, namely Descartes and as Joan Dayan has pointed out: “in a Cartesian meditation, Claire is saying nothing less than ‘I write therefore I think therefore I am.’ The very constitution of self, however–her concrete ‘prise de conscience,’ to use Césaire’s formulation–depends upon learning to write, to be French” (235). According to her, Claire transformed the famous “Je pense, donc je suis” and is then empowered to become arrogant, because it is almost unthinkable that a woman of a small town in Haiti would even think of writing, thinking, or being.3 With a stroke of the pen, she eliminates another crucial text of the forced poetics to which Haitian writers worthy of that name have to acknowledge as part of their literary heritage. Chauvet forces her readers to take into account the poetic vision of an intelligent and educated bourgeois female character. She continues her redefinition of the West’s poetics by having Claire allude to Montaigne’s famous “moi” who in his essays pretends to elucidate his “I” and show it to his readers just as it is: “C’est icy un livre de bonne foy, lecteur . . . Je veus qu’on m’y voie en ma façon simple, naturelle et ordinaire, sans contention et artifice: car c’est moi que je peins” (3) [This is an honest book, reader . . . I want to be seen here in my simple, natural, ordinary fashion, without pose or artifice; for it is myself that I portray]. Claire believes she has a duty (tâche–which in French is a play on words with tache meaning stain) and that to speak of herself, a woman writing, without “staining” herself is feasible if she produces fiction (from the Latin fingere) and is convinced and convinces others that it is done in good faith and with a noble objective in mind. By reasoning this logically, she subverts Aristotle’s much admired mimetic principle of imitation of men and which Montaigne’s “Avis” echoes in order to find a space for women’s texts. Hence, the first-person woman narrator/author, while employing realist techniques, denounces its doctrines because so many of her compatriots have incessantly sought them in order to construct, explain, and justify a Haitian national identity, often without taking into account the women’s point of view.4 Is it possible to construct an identity on partial views? If what is real is that which is based on facts, then the more perspectives there are, the more one needs the voices of women to narrate another aspect of Haiti, and perhaps then there will be a possible redefinition of Haitian identity. Precisely because the notion of identity is best embodied by the fluidity and permeability of the writing process, numerous are the allusions to the act of writing. The last pages of the journal show the readers a Claire who seems to conform to the stereotype of a scorned lover who wants to assassinate her rival and ends up choosing suicide. However, all similarities to a traditional representation end there. Claire incorporates herself into the recreation of Haitian identity and unity when she decides to stab Calédu during an ambush. Jean Luze, when he realizes the brave act of “masculinity” of his sister-in-law, embraces her, but Claire is no longer interested in either his embraces or his warm breath in her ear. Her last words to Jean Luze are “Si tu savais comme je suis fatiguée!” (187) [If you only knew how tired I am]. Indicating that her fight transcends political assassinations, it is a vindication of her role in a male-dominated Caribbean world, and it is also true that the fight is tiring because it is constant and with no immediate resolution in sight. She returns to her bedroom where she locks her door with two locks and contemplates the blood of a man which stains her hand, her dress, and the knife. She concludes her diary noting the following: “les torches qui vacillent dans le vent. Les portes des maisons sont ouvertes et la ville entière, debout” (187) [the torches that flicker in the wind. The doors of the homes are open and the entire city, up]. Both the stabbing of the text and in the text convey the idea of the undoing of the repression: Claire liberates her people, on a literal level, from the oppressive authority of Calédu; she also metaphorically liberates them (as readers) from their awe of canonical texts. The doors of the houses–women’s domain– are wide open and the lights, although hesitant, appear. Calédu has tried to intimidate Claire with his deployment of force or rather his capacity to abuse power and authority, especially when it comes to raping women–in particular Claire’s neighbor–which leaves an indelible mark on Claire. Her diary is not that of a mad woman assassin. Her writing is that of someone consumed by an unbridled desire who opts for written expression capable of undermining literary models imposed on Haitian women which do not take into account the importance of all the voices needed to construct the Antillean unity discussed by theorists of the Caribbean and which one could understand as Bakhtin’s principle of heteroglossia so necessary in novels to generate a dialogic exercise among the characters and with the readers. It is difficult indeed to conjure an integral Caribbean without taking into account the linguistic aspects of a natural, lyric-based poetics to which women are certainly attuned. Poetics, as Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar have signaled in No Man’s Land for English and U.S. literatures, are not the exclusive domain of men writers. In Caribbean literature, the stakes are not higher but different because of the scarcity of feminist theoretical frameworks from the Caribbean within which to study its literary production.\n\nIn Warner-Vieyra’s case, the search for an Antillean identity takes her all the way to East Africa. Juletane serves as a frame to the title character’s journal; it is written in the first person and the framing story is told from a third-person narrator’s point of view as the stream of consciousness of the social worker Hélène. Both characters are women from the Caribbean (probably Guadeloupe) who are exiled in a country in East Africa (probably Senegal). Juletane’s journal begins on a Tuesday, August 22, 1961 at four in the afternoon and comes to an end on a Friday, September 8, 1961 at eight in the evening. Significantly there are only two days during which she does not write; both days are linked to deaths, and we therefore do not get to read her more immediate reactions to those events. They remain “opaque” or camouflaged.\n\nHélène is in Africa because she does not want to live in the closed and stifling space of a small island: she is a liberated and professional woman. She reads the journal a few months after Juletane’s death, who had arrived in Africa as Mamadou’s new wife. She had met this dashing young Muslim African in Paris a short time after her godmother’s death. Juletane, whose existence was carefully divided between working, studying, and visiting her godmother’s old friends, is dazzled by this African whose friends discuss their country’s independence, whereas she has never questioned the political identity of hers: a French Département d’Outre-Mer. Up until that moment, Juletane and her text reflect to perfection models which call for total and blind dependence. They get married and on the ship which takes them to Africa, they come across an old woman friend of Mamadou who asks him how did his first wife take the news of his second nuptials. For Juletane this revelation is a blow from which she never recovers. In order to endure this painful existence and the miscarriage of her baby boy (a creative process which does not come to a full term because the text obeys another need–the narratological one), she begins to write a cahier. The reader reads it at the same time that Hélène does, and we see how this reading transforms her and moves her, a woman who had surrounded her heart with blocks of ice. One is then called to ask what poetics is at play here and what are those models the text is probing and desecrating. Claire calls her diary a journal alluding to the fact that for her it was a daily and routine action–as a matter of fact, it is the same word used in French to talk about newspapers. Notwithstanding, Juletane describes how she reaches the process of writing according to the material at hand:\n\nL’idée d’écrire m’est venue ce matin [Tuesday, 22 August 1961] en feuilletant distraitement un cahier inachevé, glissé d’un cartable. Le cahier d’une petite fille qui aurait pu être ma fille, mon enfant. Hélas! Je n’ai ni parents, ni amis. Et même plus de nom. Peu importe, ce n’était qu’un nom d’emprunt et je crains l’avoir oublié. Mon vrai nom, je ne l’ai pas connu, il a été gommé sur le registre du temps. (13)\n\nThe idea of writing came to me this morning while distractedly leafing through an unfinished notebook, slipped into a bookbag. The notebook of a girl who could have been my daughter, my child. I have neither family nor friends. No longer even a name. It doesn’t matter, it was only an assumed name, which I’m afraid I may have forgotten. My real name, I never knew it, erased from the register of time.\n\nGiven how the official colonizers’ version of the history of slavery diminished the role their exploitation played in Afro-Caribbean history, many authors and critics have tried to bring it to the forefront and have sought to define Antillean identity by almost exclusively emphasizing African ancestry while excluding other racial components. In part, this extreme measure is due to Césaire’s négritude movement and the critical world’s long overdue recognition of the contributions of the African cultures to the formation of Caribbean identity. His most famous poetic text is titled Cahier d’un retour au pays natal (1939). So when Juletane and Hélène allude to the diary as if it were a cahier belonging to a little girl, they seem to imply that the new Antillean narrative ought to move away from any extreme oversimplified representation of identity, as Glissant beseeches us to do. Juletane firmly states that she will employ the term to overstep the boundaries of this anonymous writing form, because she has forgotten her name since it has been erased by others from historic registers. All of this implies that Antilleanness should not be limited to the Afro-Caribbean’s man vision of the Caribbean because women’s voices have been neglected. It further implies that the search for an origin would be based on fallacious grounds. And it finally calls for people in the Caribbean to perceive writing as a function which will provide them with “un ami, un confident” (18) [a friend, a confidant], not the simplistic postcolonial view of writing in a colonizer’s language as a legacy to be discarded. This woman character’s writings are not those of a demented being, and she is not an incomplete or frustrated human entity; on the contrary, she is wiser than those who prejudge her without finding out whether she is knowledgeable, or whether she is the reflection of the hypersensibility of a pure soul thrown into a real or imaginary vacuum (13). Juletane very lucidly perceives that a woman writing causes surprise and distrust, is not to be taken seriously, and no matter how hard she tries, clashes constantly with male ideas of the dogma of what should and ought to be written about. A woman’s writing is not always judged by its merits but by how it fits into the male canon. Juletane alludes to the fact that she left her native island when she was ten years old and as her mental capacities supposedly deteriorate, she misses her island in an inversely proportional way. Writing allows her to discover and describe herself: “Je n’avais jamais imaginé que coucher ma peine sur une feuille blanche pouvait m’aider à l’analyser, la dominer et enfin, peut-être, la supporter ou définitivement la refuser” (60) [I had never imagined that putting my suffering onto a blank page could help me to analyze it, to master it, and finally, perhaps, endure it or definitively reject it]. Literally, she writes of black over white because Hélène describes Juletane’s cahier as a “document noirci d’une écriture irréguliè re” (12) [document blackened by irregular writing]. This leads the reader to deduct that she is not constrained by rules and that the written text has no fixed form, that is she does not submit herself to rules pre-established by others. Thanks to the act of writing, she can analyze herself and can control the suffering of being the second wife of the only man she has ever loved, living in a country whose language she does not master, and to have to put up with the third wife who insults her, calls her crazy, and even slaps her. As in Claire’s case, the novel concludes in death: the three children of the first wife die mysteriously. Juletane, whose name we learn only at the end of the text, alludes to her possible responsibility vis-à-vis the crime; she does not remember what she did with her medicine drops, if she left them by mistake where the children might reach them, or if she emptied them in the water jug. She is also able to attain revenge against the odious third wife, Ndèye, by pouring hot oil over her face. After this, Juletane is placed in a mental asylum where she continues to write her journal. One of the African woman patients comments the following: that this business of writing is “une histoire de Blancs” (138) [for Whites]. We cannot forget that precisely part of the Caribbean’s cultural heritage is a product also of the white Westerners’ visions of history and literature. The patient’s comment indirectly points to a natural poetics free to combine dialogically an array of points of view. Juletane’s intended narratee is Mamadou, who after leaving her at the asylum dies in a car crash. The narratee ends up being Hélène, an Antillean woman who then begins to question her life and the fact that she is getting married at forty to a submissive African only to have a child. What lesson does she learn from Juletane? That she does not need to be a biological mother in order to create and that the answer to the questions related to Caribbean poetics will not necessarily be found in either the mythical Africa of her ancestors or in those of the Western poetics. Antillean poetics is indebted to both and it is a product of their synthesis.\n\nIt is precisely thanks to women writers such as Chauvet and Warner-Vieyra who from that traditional interior home space reserved for women, produce first-person narratives in the form of diaries of apparently demented women, who commit crimes, probe the process of writing, question the poetic tenets of the West and of the Caribbean writers, and advocate for a truly Antillean poetics flexible enough to promote without reifying or nullifying texts written by women. As Glissant reminds us: “L’imaginaire des Antilles nous libère de l’étouffement” (250) [The imaginary of the Antilles saves us from stifling]. And where else but in our own artistic expressions will we find the Antillean imaginary explored? It is thanks to those expressions that we can up to a certain extent breathe outside of the suffocation imposed by our geography, our history, and our complicated relationship with the West’s politics and poetics.\n\nAs more Caribbean women writers publish their works and are given the opportunity to contribute their ideas to the poetics debate, one finds that the lyrical imaginary increases. Ana Lydia Vega’s short story “Otra maldad de Pateco,” (from her collection Encancaranublado y otros cuentos de naufragio, 1987), will serve to illustrate this Caribbean tension stemming from the desire to be more ludic when establishing or redefining a Caribbean identity. To all of these factors one may attribute unparalleled innovativeness and vigor of the Caribbean’s literature today. The search for identity is central to Vega, but it is presented differently because it is done in a more humorous tone. She shares with Chauvet and Warner-Vieyra the geography, the history of sugar plantation societies, the diversity of colonizing powers, the smallness of the area, and the intertexts of male authors.\n\nVega’s story is deceivingly simple. A son is born to Don Felipe y Doña Amalia Montero, white sugar cane plantation owners. What makes this child unique is that he is born with a white body and a black head because Pateco Patadecabra, a sort of imp, intervenes with the African gods to have “another mischief” take place (as the title of the story implies). As the story goes, this baby is raised by a Black curandera, Mamá Ochú, who tells him his name will be José Clemente only when he has sufficient capacity to understand language. He is never to leave her humble house, where she keeps him in the dark and distracts him by telling him folkloric stories. He asks her why is she black whereas he is white, for there are no mirrors in the house, and he cannot see himself. She is forced to lie and tells him his eyes are blue like the water in the river and his hair is as blond as the sun. He, of course, now feels the urge to go outside and see these natural elements by himself. As it turns out, a window is opened by a mysterious gust of wind; he sees a beautiful young woman slave about to go into the river, who is scared when she sees this monster. José Clemente sees his reflection in the river, realizes his dilemma, and starts to cry. The myth of Narcissus is inverted, allowing for the redefinition of the classic Western tradition of beauty (in this case) to take place. A Caribbean character product of mixtures, up until recently, did not want to fall in love with his or her image, metaphorically cried in despair, but now after the revisions to the definition of Caribbean identity, is beginning to accept more readily the fact of being a product of various races and ethnicities, and sees the beauty and importance of the mixes when, as is presented in the story, the Afro-Caribbean god Ogún comes out of the water and orders him not to cry. Caribbeans are not exclusively the product of Western civilization, but also of African and the poetics of Caribbean expression ought to reflect that other “natural,” oral, and lyrical component at play. If the Caribbean person or scholar tries to express the Caribbean exclusively through Western models, the identity or the text will ring empty and will be void of Caribbean significance. The concept of oral literature and the interplay of voices with a poetical underpinning is decisive when discussing Caribbean literature.\n\nThe young man asks for his color back. The god gives him his machete and replies with a riddle. José Clemente is left to wander all day long and into the night. All of a sudden, a fire erupts in the midst of the plantation and threatens the white planters’ big house and the slaves’ barracks. When José Clemente sees the beautiful woman, María Laó, trying to free her father, he decides to break the chains of the slaves with the god’s machete and saves them first from the fire, while the house burns to the ground with only one pair of white arms visible. The slaves all run behind him, and upon reaching Mamá Ochú’s house, his body has recovered the black coloring Pateco had hidden in order to teach a lesson to the Monteros and to the readers.\n\nThe story is structured as an allegorical fable, and is marked by lyrical interruptions such as Pateco’s incantation to get the fabulous combination of colors for the newborn:\n\nTranco y saco\n\nSaco y tranco\n\nBlanco y negro\n\nNegro y blanco (108)\n\nand Ogún’s riddle: “Entre los tuyos está tu color / cuando seas uno ya no serás dos” (111) [Among your people is your color/ when you are one you will not be two anymore]. Implied in the text, as part of that natural, lyrical poetics, are the allusions to Mamá Ochú’s stories on Pateco (incorporating the generator of the story within the story itself in an Arabian Nights manner), and Calconte, la Gran Bestia, Juan Calalú (prende la vela y apaga la luz) [light the candle and turn out the light] y la Princesa Moriviví (all characters of Afro-Puerto Rican folklore), on the one hand, and teachings on deities of the African pantheon, such as Ogún, Changó, Orula, and Obatalá on the other.\n\nIn keeping with Glissant’s definition, the story is told by an irreverent and sassy omniscient Antillean third-person narrator. The narrator’s expressions closely reproduce the everyday language of the Puerto Rican “lower” and “darker” classes. Take, for example, the following commentaries alluding bitingly to racism. This passage refers to Doña Amalia’s rhetorical question when confronted with “ese monstruo” (monster): “¿Qué tenía que ver esta bestia bicolor con sus jinchísimas carnes, rubias melechas y azul sangre heredada de Castilla la Vieja?” (108) [What did this two-tone beast have to do with her pale flesh, straight blonde hair and the blue blood inherited from Old Castille]. Further on in the text, there is the following comment on the father’s reaction: “la obesa rata de la duda roía incansable el corazón de Don Felipe Montero” (108) [the obese rat of doubt was gnawing Don Felipe Montero’s tireless heart]. For him, Doña Amalia could have been unfaithful; to an affected reader, the metaphorical fat rat of doubt could also be nibbling at his own conscience: what if on Don Montero’s side there is African blood as we are sometimes wont to pretend not to know in Puerto Rico even to this day?\n\nAt other times the allusions and intertexts come from Luis Palés Matos, Puerto Rico’s foremost exponent of Afro-Puerto Rican poetry. When the beautiful slave appears by the river, the narrator exclaims: “acertó a pasar por allí, como por casualidad [as if the textual appearance is fortuitous and spontaneous and not a literary construct], una joven esclava de belleza bruja que hubiese hecho reventar de celos a Tembandumba de la Quimbamba” (110) [a bewitchingly beautiful young slave girl who would have made Tembandumba de la Quimbamba explode with jealousy, managed to pass by, as if by chance]. One of Palés Matos’s most famous poems, entitled “Majestad negra,” extols African beauty through a woman’s sensuality:\n\nPor la encendida calle antillana\n\nva Tembandumba de la Quimbamba\n\n–Rumba, macumba, candombe, bámbula–\n\nEntre dos filas de negras caras.\n\nAnte ella un congo–gongo y maraca–\n\nRitma una conga bomba que bamba.\n\nCulipandeando la Reina avanza,\n\nY de su inmensa grupa resbalan,\n\nMeneos cachondos que el gongo cuaja\n\nEn ríos de azúcar y de melaza.\n\nPrieto trapiche de sensual zafra,\n\nEl caderamen, masa con masa,\n\nExprime ritmos, suda que sangra,\n\nY la molienda culmina en danza. (49)\n\nThe desired effect is to make the young woman more attractive to José Clemente and the reader because she is even more beautiful, sweeter, and sensual than her Black majesty of the well-known poem.\n\nNonetheless, the poignant remarks do not end here. When faced with the problem of whom should José Clemente save first, the narrator uses a very telling simile: “la indecisión se le eñangotó al frente como una lavandera malhumorada” (112). The image is borrowed from the working-class domain, yet clearly establishes the idea of indecision as this immovable female mass in a bad mood not letting him go anywhere. The choice of the verb “eñangotarse” (a variation of “ñangotarse”) is not without intent either, for it has been established by our linguists as a word of African origin which means squatting. The seriousness of the decision is highlighted by the following commentary: “la cosa estaba más difícil que mondar lerenes” (112); once again an allusion to the Puerto Rican countryside with its tuber, the lerén, which is very hard to peel and which was probably a staple in the diet of the African slaves.\n\nThe tightness of the re-construction of this myth of the divided or split Puerto Rican extends to the careful selection of names. José Clemente, whose name exudes clemency, does not acquire a name until Mamá Ochú deems he can handle it. Therefore, it is implied that identity is not formed or to be found in the origin (when we as a people were composed of distinct and separate races–as the symbolism of José Clemente’s physical dichotomy suggests), but at a later stage when we are mature enough to understand our Caribbean condition. But when does that time come? Not in the adolescent years nor during young adulthood; it takes a brutal event, in this case the purifying fire, to make José grow up, stop lamenting his fate as a torn being, and realize who he really is: a descendant of Africans with nothing to be ashamed of because of the proud and brave lineage to which he can lay claim.\n\nThe concluding paragraph reads: “y así fue como José Clemente recuperó el color que Pateco le había escondido para escarmentar a la familia Montero, cuya hacienda y vieja molienda consumió el fuego de Ogún” (113) [and that is how Jose Clemente recovered the color that Pateco had hidden from him in order to teach a lesson to the Montero family, whose ranch and old sugarmill were consumed by Ogun’s fire]. Instead of maintaining the races separate, Vega constructs a protagonist whose existence is to prove that in literary texts, Caribbean identity ought not to just incorporate the neglected African element but to make it an equal figure in the literary game. The irony of the white head, not capable of using Cartesian reason to say something appropriate to the Black beauty other than: “¿Eres tú la Princesa Moriviví?” (110) [Are you Princess Morivivi?], adds to the Vegian project of making the Afro-Caribbean element supersede the European one, which is not only ridiculed but eliminated in the end. José Clemente’s “sonrisa cimarrona en los labios,” (113) [a runaway slave’s smile on his lips] clearly indicates the euphoria of the runaway slave: in his case he has been freed from the burden of the lack of color as he regains it in the end paired to the beautiful strong female slave, María Laó. For after all, as the epigraph reminds us\n\nEl negro José Clemente\n\nperdidamente se enamoró\n\nen el río de la Plata\n\nde la mulata María Laó. (107)\n\nThe story then comes full circle as a demonstration of how fiction can be generated from other fiction (in our case the song which serves as epigraph and the excerpt from another Palés Matos poem on Ogún). Lest we forget, let us recall the second epigraph:\n\nPapá Ogú n, dios de la guerra\n\nque tiene botas con betún\n\ny cuando anda tiembla la tierra… (107)\n\nwhich is taken from “Falsa canción de baquiné,” a false African death ceremonial song for a child offered to Ogún, god of war and which turns out to be a meeting to eat the white man’s meat. Could Vega be implying that realism is more important than African traditions deemed “false” because they always revert to magic? Or, on the contrary, that in the Caribbean, the natural poetics occupy a privileged space because of its inclusive lyrical aspects which take into account those of realism? The more daring of the contemporary works in the Caribbean, appear to adopt this stance of multiplicity and strong interplay of voices, voices that allude to the works of respected male authors such as Aristotle, Descartes, Montaigne, Césaire, Palés Matos in conjunction with the centrifugal voices of dark-skinned women, of seemingly demented ones, or of a jovial female narrator examining stratified and heteroglossic literary language. As long as the text moves a poet to write so as to affect a reader within the dictates of a natural and lyrical poetics, Caribbean literature will find a path other than magical realism to participate in the mythical reconstruction of today’s Caribbean identity through lyrical origins closely tied to women’s issues, African and popular folklore which are more and more recognized as vital and powerful components of Caribbean literary production.\n\nNotes\n\nThe translations of Edouard Glissant are from the English version by J.

This is particularly true for Caribbean peoples. This paper addresses the ambivalent existence of multiracial identities for Caribbean people in the regions of Trinidad and Guyana, two areas with particularly diverse populations including significant numbers of people who are of (East) Indian background, as well as (in Guyana) an indigenous Amerindian population. The current relevancy of this issue is highlighted by tensions between African and Indian populations in each area, following the elections of predominantly Indian-based governments in Guyana in 1992 (PPP) and Trinidad & Tobago in 1995 (UNC/NAR coalition). As racial terrains shift in the realms of power, people often resort to constructions of “pure” identities to support an “us” versus “them” agenda. An exploration into multiracial identity challenges this re-ordering of racial monoliths and homogeneous social organization; it provides an opening for discussion of similarities rather than differences, of interlinkages and a shared history of colonization.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, the term “multiracial” is intended to signify an identity which has arisen out of a colonial history. Prior to Columbus, any notion of “race” among the Amerindians would have differed considerably from that which was developed over time by the Europeans for very specific imperialist reasons. Multiracial Caribbean people are those who are descended from more than one racial group found in the Caribbean. The very notion of multiracial identity is only significant if importance, privilege, difference, or debasement has been accorded to particular racial groups over others during the course of Caribbean history.\n\nMy analysis of Caribbean multiracial identity is based on the works cited as well as a series of interviews I conducted with multiracial Caribbean and Caribbean-Canadian people during 1994-1995. It is a preliminary investigation of a subject area which requires much deeper study, a study which I hope to flesh out from this skeletal framework of initial inquiry. Caribbean scholarship has largely ignored and overlooked multiracial/mixed race identity with the exception of a few articles and papers (Khan, Puri, Reddock, and Shibata), and a rather significant body of work dealing with the Coloured/Mulatto/gens de couleur class and its historical/political significance (Braithwaite, Brathwaite, Brereton, Cohen & Green, Heuman, and Sio). In comparison, within the body of Caribbean literature there is an attempt to examine, however superficially, multiracial identity and its problematic/complex meaning beyond African/European bipolarity. This is mostly evident in the works of Edgar Mittelholzer, V.S. Naipaul, Jan Shinebourne, Lawrence Scott, and Merle Hodge. However, large gaps remain in the areas of theory and primary research examining how racially complex Caribbean people negotiate and navigate their identities in a social and political atmosphere which both exalts them (“All o’ we is one”, “One people, one nation, one destiny”, “Out of many, one people”) and denies them full recognition as a legitimate racial “group” in an arena where one’s racial allegiance purportedly informs community and political alliance, personal and business networks, state power and consequently, access to resources.\n\nI\n\n“Raceing” in Trinidad and Guyana: Historical Developments\n\nFrom the time the first Europeans invaded the Amerindian-inhabited Caribbean region, multiracial people have been a reality. As elsewhere in the world where colonialism left its indelible mark, children were born of sexual liaisons, forced or compliant, between colonizer and colonized. Over time, as the shape of Caribbean society was transformed by increasing migrations to the region (also forced or compliant), the potential for increasingly complex multiracial identity became evident. In areas such as Trinidad and Guyana, where a diverse melange of peoples existed at the advent of the twentieth century, complicated lineages could be discerned among a minority of the population (Croley Segal 83). Societies such as these were comprised of a racial/class hierarchy with the white group at the top, (mainly foreign Europeans and locally-born Creoles); and, in descending order, a Coloured group of African/European descent, (some of whom were quickly advancing into areas of influence); Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Portuguese immigrants who were aspiring to lower middle class positions; Venezuelan peons of mixed heritage (in Trinidad); Africans and Indians, who formed the majority of the population, and were in general economically and socially marginalized; and in Guyana, a sizeable and diverse population of Amerindian people who inhabited the country’s interior regions. Sprinkled amongst these racial/social classes were multiracial people of every description, who occupied no set position, and were in no way a cohesive group.\n\nAlthough these racial/ethnic/class divisions were evident, they were not impermeable nor rigid (Brereton, Social organization54). Interactions between all groups were inevitable, dependent on particular demographic variables such as relative isolation of a group or male/female ratios. It was out of these interactions that multiracial people arose. For example, some Chinese males who came as indentured labourers in the nineteenth century married into the Coloured class, thereby advancing themselves socially and economically (Brereton, Social organization 38). Africans and Indians, despite having historically been kept apart as a matter of colonial divide and rule politics, nevertheless interacted with one another (Reddock104). The popular term (in both Guyana and Trinidad) to describe such an African/Indian mixed race person is “dougla”. The offspring of African/Indian unions did not, however, form a cohesive community as for example elite Coloured people had done since the pre-Emancipation era.\n\nBecause of the extreme social and political relevance of race and colour in the society, it was generally the mixed people who claimed partial European ancestry, ie. more than “pure” African, Indian or Amerindian heritage, out of all mixed race people, who were able to gain a measure of privilege (Brereton, Society and culture 92). The working-class African and Indian groups, and, in Guyana, Amerindian people who still maintained their traditional ways of life, were the most marginalized in the societies. Some members of the Coloured middle class had already established their status generations previous through economic activities, education, and a consistent belief in their inherent right to rule the colonies due to their mixed – racial and cultural – inheritance. It was because of this mixed heritage that they were able to assert an “authentically Caribbean” identity. Other mixed race people, dependent on racial heritage, appearance, colour, and class, were in certain cases able to advance themselves socially as well. However, because Caribbean scholarship has largely ignored the many people who did not or were not able to move from a marginalized status into a more privileged position despite multiracial ancestry, (both from the Coloured group and those of other multiracial ancestries)2 it is uncertain how they defined themselves in the society and with whom they would align themselves. Because not all multiracial people were capable of attaining a position of relative privilege, it must be assumed that multiracial lineage in itself did not automatically result in privilege, but rather that colour, phenotype and white association (familial or fraternal) would result in the possibility of advancement, combined with other factors such as income, class background, ethnicity and education. Three examples of such multiracial groups who remain marginalized despite, or because of, their mixed ancestry are “douglas” (Trinidad and Guyana), “cocoa panyols” (Trinidad) and “bovianders” (Guyana).\n\nII\n\n“Douglas”\n\nThe term “dougla” is seldom adopted in self-application by people of African/Indian ancestry themselves, due to its negative connotation and the stigma of illegitimacy surrounding it (Khan, Puri, Reddock, and Shibat, 5). The word itself comes from the Hindi term for “bastard” or “miscegenate”. “Dougla” identity is most often ascribed to individuals who are the offspring of one African and one Indian parent.3 It is considered a non-hereditary identification: the child of a dougla and a non-dougla individual would usually be ascribed another racial identity, largely based on appearance (Segal 97). It is almost impossible to estimate the number of “douglas” in Trinidad and Guyana as there is no official category on census forms or in other demographic data; rather “dougla” is incorporated within the much more diverse and ambiguous category “Mixed”. As well, not everyone who is actually “dougla” would choose to define as such, due to various pressures enacted on the individual from both African and Indian sides. In particular, rejection by Indian family members and acceptance into Afro-Caribbean communities has been most common. Rhoda Reddock clearly outlines the historical and cultural reasons for such rejection, stemming from Hindu beliefs in contamination, varna(colour) and caste endogamy, and contemporary fears of Indian racial extinction through the so-called corruption of Indian women (115-116). The social result of this rejection is that many “dougla” individuals are raised within the Afro-Caribbean/creole culture, (although, this does not necessarily result in self-identification or self-naming as “African”, as is seen with some other mixed groups).\n\nThe current position of “dougla” people in both Trinidad and Guyana has been exacerbated by the tensions between African and Indian groups, in the political arena as well as at the social, interpersonal level. In Trinidad, “dougla” identity has been appropriated by ambitious politicians and public figures and wielded as a political tool in the form of “douglarisation” politics; that is, a proposal for African/Indian unity/mixing, utilizing the “dougla” as the ultimate symbol of racial harmony. Seen as a threat by conservative and orthodox elements in the Indian population, (and by some fewer but equally orthodox Africanist factions), "
