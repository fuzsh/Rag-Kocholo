        "text": "Happy summer, Retrowatchers! At long last! I had my doubts as to it ever being warm again, but am writing this while wearing a sundress sporting a tan. Let’s all breathe a collective sigh of relief: Ahhh!\n\nWe’ve made it to the end of season three. And what a season it has been: Lou Grant bought a bar, had a bullet removed from an unmentionable area, and went on an awkward Man Date with Mary’s father. We finally met Mary’s parents and Rhoda’s dad. Rhoda won a beauty contest, pondered a move to New York, and (spoiler alert) opened her own store. Ted hired an agent and briefly dabbeled in commercials, became temporary BFF’s with Lou, and got a girlfriend. Phyllis, of all people, came out of the season the most progressive, encouraging Mary to go out for a promotion and hardly batted an eye when she found out her brother is gay. Murray…well…nothing much happens to our Murray. (Nothing ever happens to Murray.) As for Mary – she had quite a year as well. She finally got a raise, reconnected with her father, and nearly got engaged before realizing she’s not looking for Prince Charming. (Retrowatching HQ remains firmly #TeamDanWhitfield.) We met some new people – some good (Georgette, Walter Richards, Ben Sutherland, Philly); some not so good (the majority of Mary’s dates, most especially he-who-shall-not-be-mentioned-again, Warren Sturges.) The writers started to change structure a bit in season three, experimenting with subplots and comic runners. These mostly went to Ted; a few went to Rhoda. And speaking of writers, the question still remains: Who is this season’s MVP?\n\nThe answer will be revealed at the end of this post. First, let’s finish out season three. This time, we will discuss episodes 21-24, including:\n\nEpisode 21: Murray Faces Life\n\nEpisode 22: Remembrance of Things Past\n\nEpisode 23: Put On a Happy Face\n\nEpisode 24: Mary Richards and the Incredible Plant Lady\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHello, Retrowatchers! Are you enjoying the spring yet or living in fear of winter making one (more) last appearance? I’m a little bit in between. I want to believe, but can’t quite give myself over entirely.\n\nBefore we jump into this week’s episodes, I’d like to recommend a show I recently started watching, though it has been on my radar for a year: Orphan Black. Retrowatchers, this show is ANYTHING but retro; it is modern in every sense of the world. And boy is it fun. I don’t want to say too much as it has a rich mythology – episodes must be watched in order – but I cannot recommend it enough. Every episodes ends with a new twist. You will be surprised and delighted by its star, Tatiana Maslany. And last, the show manages to wonderfully walk the tightrope that many sci-fi shows stumble upon – incorporating its fantasy and mythology elements while still making the show accessible to non-science fiction geeks such as myself. (See also, Vampire Slayer, Buffy.)\n\nBut enough chat about current TV shows. Let’s jump into the latter part of Mary Tyler Moore’s third season. This week, we discuss episodes 17-20, including:\n\nEpisode 17: My Brother’s Keeper\n\nEpisode 18: The Georgette Story\n\nEpisode 19: Romeo and Mary\n\nEpisode 20: What Do You Do When the Boss Says I Love You?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHappy spring, Retrowatchers! Has this been the worst, most dragged out winter or what? It’s still not quite over – there are reports of more snow in the DC area next week. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I don’t think I have ever craved warm weather so strongly before, and I’m a beach bum who loves summer!\n\nIt’s still winter in Minneapolis as well, as this batch of episodes finishes out the year and brings us into 1973. What will the new year have in store for Mary and the gang? Let’s find out.\n\nThis week, we discuss episodes 13-16 of season three, including:\n\nEpisode 13: Operation: Lou\n\nEpisode 14: Rhoda Morgenstern: From Minneapolis to New York\n\nEpisode 15: The Courtship of Mary’s Father’s Daughter\n\nEpisode 16: Lou’s Place\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWell hello there, Retrowatchers! I hope some of you are still with me. Please forgive my unexpected extended absence. As I mentioned in the previous post, 2014 got off to an unexpectedly busy start! To give you an indication as to how busy: I actually watched the episodes we are about to discuss in January. Eesh! Fortunately I take very detailed notes and was able to refresh my memory.\n\nBefore delving in, may I say that after the endless winter we’ve been having, I now completely agree with Lou’s assessment of snow from “It’s Whether You Win or Lose?” This pretty much sums up my current feelings for this winter:\n\n“ I hate snow. I don’t like its color. I don’t like its shape. I don’t like its temperature. I don’t like how it feels or what it does. I don’t like it in snowballs. Or on hills. I don’t like anything about it. It’s a soft, wet, white, mushy melting freezing mess! I hate snow as much as I hate anything in the entire world!”\n\nWord, Lou! I always knew you were very wise.\n\nOkay, enough chitchat, let’s get to it. This week we discuss episodes 9-12 of season three, including:\n\nEpisode 9: Farmer Ted and the News\n\nEpisode 10: Have I Found the Guy For You\n\nEpisode 11: You’ve Got a Friend\n\nEpisode 12: It Was Fascination, I Know\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHappy 2014, Retrowatchers! I hope the new year is treating you well. Mine has been smashing thus far. This week, we will delve further into the third season of Mary Tyler Moore. But first, I have to address something. It’s been bothering me since the start of the season.\n\nI realize the ’70s was arguably the cruelest decade for fashion. Mistakes were made. The prints. The colors. The pants. None of it is good. Surprisingly though, I made it three seasons without being truly horrified by a fashion choice. Yes, there have been ridiculous dresses, intentionally and unintentionally. But even the frilliest, pinkest bridesmaid dress does not offend my senses more than Mary’s short, poofy haircut. I get that it was the style at the time, but still: WHY? It’s just wrong on every level.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s get back into season three. This week, we discuss episodes 5-8, including:\n\nEpisode 5: It’s Whether You Win or Lose\n\nEpisode 6: Rhoda the Beautiful\n\nEpisode 7: Just Around the Corner\n\nEpisode 8: But Seriously, Folks\n\nContinue reading →"
