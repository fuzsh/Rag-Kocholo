        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global health crisis of the 21st century. 1 Approximately 2.3% of the world’s population has now been infected by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), the novel coronavirus and etiologic agent of COVID-19, and more than 3.3 million people have died. 2 In addition, thousands of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 illness have been left with long-term complications – dubbed “long COVID-19” – and other chronic COVID-19 syndromes. 3\n\nCOVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in high-risk individuals, such as those with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, is substantial and current treatment options are limited.4 –6 Fortunately, with the global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, there is emerging evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines can reduce the severity of infection and prevent deaths. 7 Real world data emanating from a nationwide mass vaccination program in Israel, in an uncontrolled setting, have recently shown that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was effective for preventing symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe illness and death. 8\n\nGlobally, over 1.3 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered with about 4.1% of the population being fully vaccinated as of 10 May 2021. 9 However, a recent survey has shown that the potential acceptance of these vaccines varies from country to country, with over 80% acceptance in China, Singapore and South Korea to less than 55% in Russia. 10 Some of the main reasons for reporting non-intent to receive vaccine were concerns about vaccine side effects and safety and lack of trust in the vaccine development process.11,12\n\nIn Uganda, COVID-19 vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine was launched on 10 March 2021, with priority being given to healthcare workers and individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 and death. However, little is known about acceptance of receiving the vaccine among Ugandans, especially in the priority groups. Reports from the government of Uganda also indicate there is a slow uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country, with only about 400,000 people vaccinated by 10 May 2021. 13 Therefore, in this study, we assessed the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and associated factors among persons at high risk of severe COVID-19 attending a large tertiary health facility in Uganda.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we assessed for the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among persons at high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Uganda. About 70% of the study population was willing to receive the vaccine. Perceived risk of future COVID-19, extent of worrying about COVID-19, current perceived risk of COVID-19, perceived immunity to COVID-19 and perceived efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability.\n\nInterestingly, our recently concluded survey of over 600 medical students in Uganda showed that only 37.3% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 14 This might be due to lack of correct information regarding the vaccine among medical students, which could have been consolidated by the current wave of speculations on the safety, especially the reported incidence of blood clots in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. 15 Medical students in our recent study also reported low perceived risk as a major factor for lack of willingness to accept the vaccine. 14 However, our finding is consistent with a global COVID-19 vaccine acceptability survey in which over 72% of over 13,000 individuals from 19 countries across the world were willing to receive a proven, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. 10\n\nIn our study, male patients were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. This corroborates with our findings in the medical student population, where male students were up to two times more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Among healthcare workers in Democratic Republic of Congo, males were also more likely to receive the vaccine. 16 This trend has been observed in Kuwait, 17 the general population in the United States, 18 and their health workers. 19 It is not yet clear as to why this gender difference has been continually reported in previous studies as well. 20 Men have been reported to generally take more risks in life than women. With the ongoing infodemic of antivax messages, we postulate that men may be willing to take a risk and receive the vaccine, hence the difference in acceptability.\n\nOur study also demonstrated the impact of perceived immunity to the COVID-19 vaccine on its acceptability. Those who thought they had immunity towards COVID-19 were significantly less likely to accept the vaccine. This perception has been reported in the general population of Kuwait adults, 17 where self-perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, the self-perceived potential severity of their COVID-19 and perceptions on natural immunity towards COVID-19 affected acceptability in a similar trend. There is therefore need to provide clear information about development of immunity among patients who have previously had COVID-19, and intensifying risk communication to curb the reluctance observed in the general public in Uganda with regard to COVID-19 prevention.\n\nDespite the proven efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection might still occur despite a complete vaccination. 21 Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine recipients should be reminded to continue other personal preventive measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as masking and physical distancing when in public or around unvaccinated individuals who are at risk for severe COVID-19. 22\n\nThere is growing concern that vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination presence will dampen the uptake of the coronavirus vaccine. There are many cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Mercury content, autism association, concerns about vaccine side effects and safety, lack of trust in the process and vaccine danger have been commonly found in anti-vaccination messages. 23 In other studies, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has been associated with younger age (e.g. <60 years old), self-identification as Black race, lower levels of education, lack of health insurance, sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year.10 –12,14 In the present study, we noted that individuals who perceived to have some immunity to COVID-19 were less likely to accept the vaccine.\n\nOur study has some limitations. We had a small sample size and derived the study population from a single center. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to the general population of high-risk individuals in Uganda. However, our findings provide a useful information on potential strategies to optimize vaccine uptake among these high-risk populations. Future research work would be tailored at the actual uptake and completion of vaccination schedules in this population.\n\nIn conclusion, among high-risk individuals in Uganda, willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was high. Target health communications aimed at addressing barriers to vaccine uptake has to be prioritized in this population."
