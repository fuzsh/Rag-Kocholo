He studied at Sydney University, receiving a first class honours degree in 1948. Lawrie Johnson's abilities and interests were wide ranging. He is foremost known for his expertise on the eucalyptus genus.

However, he also knew much of rainforest botany, particularly the myrtle family. For instance his name is credited against Syzygium crebrinerve, Syzygium corynanthum, Choricarpia subargentea, Syzygium francisii, Syzygium moorei and others. Lawrie Johnson also collected the type material for the endangered Illawarra Socketwood, which was named in his honour, Daphnandra johnsonii. Many other plants were also named johnsonii after him.

(26 June 1925 â€“ 1 August 1997) known as Lawrie Johnson, was an Australian taxonomic botanist. He worked at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, for the whole of his professional career, as a botanist (1948-1972), Director (1972-1985) and Honorary Research Associate (1986-1997). (From Wikipedia)

Alone or in collaboration with colleagues, he distinguished and described four new families of vascular plants, 33 new genera, and new 286 species (including posthumous publications), and reclassified another 395 species. (From Wikipedia)
