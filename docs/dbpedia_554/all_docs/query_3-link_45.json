Flora of Australia. 45'\n\nYou will get suggestions as you type in your query, they tell you what your query will return, and you can select one for an exact match.\n\nThe query is not case sensitive.\n\nThis search uses an automatic wild card at the begining and end of the query to match all authors and volumes, unless you use a quoted search.\n\nThe query is an ordered set of search terms, so 'flora australia' will match 'Flora of Australia', 'Flora of south-east Australia' and and others.\n\nPutting double quotes around your entire query will cause it to be matched exactly (except case). e.g. \"%Flora of South Australia\" will match everything that ends in 'Flora of South Australia' (note the % wild card at the begining).\n\nYou can use a % as a wild card inside the search query e.g.flor% to match flore, flora, florae, florida etc.\n\nYou can use a + in place of a space to make the space match exactly. e.g. 'flora+of+australia.+28' will match everything in Flora of Australia volume 28 (1996)"
