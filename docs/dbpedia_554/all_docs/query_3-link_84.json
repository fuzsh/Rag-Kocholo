        "text": "Phylogenetic studies have highlighted incongruous generic placement and the usage of inappropriate names for species within tribe Myrteae (Myrtaceae). The genera affected are Calycolpus, Eugenia, Myrcia and Psidium. Eugenia aubletiana is legitimized by the designation of a lectotype and its usage proposed instead of Calycorectes bergii. Two generic transfers are proposed: Psidium sessiliflorum based on Calycolpus sessiliflorus and Myrcia neosericea, based on Eugenia neosericea. The re-instatement of Psidium cupreum, currently a synonym of Psidium rufum as an accepted species is proposed. Illustrations of the four affected species are furnished, as well as a map of occurrences of Psidium sessiliflorum. Tetramery associated to inflorescences reduced to 1(-3) flowers, an unusual combination of characters in Myrcia sect. Gomidesia, is identified in both Myrcia glaziovii and Myrcia neosericea, and a key to distinguish them is provided."
