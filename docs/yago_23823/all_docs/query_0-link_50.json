        "text": "WATCHING a film by the French master Henri-Georges Clouzot, you often feel as if the walls were closing in on you — even when there are no walls. “The Wages of Fear” (1953), the movie that opens the Museum of Modern Art’s Clouzot retrospective on Thursday, takes place almost entirely out of doors, yet it’s as claustrophobic as a stretch in solitary confinement. This picture, which was his first big international success, and which remains one of his most popular, tells the story of four men driving truckloads of nitroglycerine over some very poorly maintained South American roads.\n\nThe ill-shaven, understandably sweaty guys — two to a vehicle — spend a great deal of time shut up in the cabs of their trucks, staring out at the road ahead, toward what might, for each of them, be too literally the vanishing point of this unforgiving landscape: the end of everything could be just over the next rise, or closer. The vistas are wide, and the air is clear, but the world seems suffocatingly small.\n\nThat’s the Clouzot effect. It is perhaps fortunate, for the sanity of his viewers, that he managed to complete only 11 features between 1942, when his deceptively light-hearted “L’Assassin Habite au 21” (“The Murderer Lives at No. 21”) was released, and 1968, when his last movie, “La Prisonnière,” came out. (He died in 1977, at the age of 69.) All 11 will be screened before the series ends on Dec. 24, along with odds and ends like a couple of early-’40s pictures for which he supplied screenplays and a 2010 documentary, “Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Inferno,” directed by Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea, about his mid-’60s project, “L’Enfer,” which he was unable to complete after suffering a major heart attack during filming.\n\nClouzot’s health, which had always been fragile, may be the reason he understood so well the effect of gazing at walls, of feeling trapped. After his debut short, “La Terreur des Batignolles” (1931), he spent four years in a sanitarium, being treated for tuberculosis. And after “La Vérité” (1960), which starred Brigitte Bardot and was a commercial success, his various ailments, physical and emotional, allowed him to finish only one more feature before he died 17 years later. In most of Clouzot’s films what you remember are people in rooms, looking tense, fretful and often, like the twitchy truck drivers in “The Wages of Fear,” afraid for their lives. Quite a bit of the action in his most famous film, the clammy, ingenious 1955 thriller “Diabolique,” takes place on the damp grounds of a school where the headmaster’s wife and mistress plot, and later try to cover up, his murder. But the scenes that matter most are all interiors: especially the smallest rooms, the bathrooms where the movie’s most heart-seizing horrors occur.\n\nClouzot was known, for a while, as the French Hitchcock, largely on the strength of “Diabolique,” which Hitchcock himself had once considered filming. (He admired Clouzot’s version.) But, as the MoMA series demonstrates, most of Clouzot’s pictures weren’t really thrillers, and none of them much resembled “Diabolique.” The great mysteries he made early on, “Le Corbeau” (“The Raven,” 1943) and “Quai des Orfèvres” (1947), are very different, both from “Diabolique” and from each other.\n\n“Le Corbeau” is about a plague of poison-pen letters in a provincial town that has the effect of making the community seem even narrower and more oppressive: it closes in on itself. The movie, made during the Occupation under the auspices of the German-run film company Continental, is a bold condemnation of collaboration, but because both the occupiers and the occupied — each for their own reasons — disapproved, “Le Corbeau” resulted in another enforced absence from filmmaking for its director. In the frenzied national soul-cleansing after the war the French film industry branded Clouzot a collaborator and banned him for life. After the intervention of some irreproachable intellectuals, notably Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Cocteau, the sentence was reduced to a few years.\n\nAnd when Clouzot was released from this latest staring-at-walls isolation, he came back with one of the few films in his oeuvre that could almost be described as joyous, the tricky detective story “Quai des Orfèvres,” which is set in the milieu of Paris music halls and benefits mightily from that energy and spirit. The deeds are dark, and so are the rooms, but there is, in this ebullient movie, an occasional shaft of light, and an acceptance of human frailty that is rarely much in evidence elsewhere in Clouzot’s work. Although the world of “Quai des Orfèvres” is in some ways confining, as urban life tends to be, here there seems to be at least a faint possibility of release — a way out, if you can find it.\n\nThis slender ray of hope was short lived, though. After a couple of nonthrillers, the 1949 romantic drama “Manon” (an updated adaptation of an 18th-century novel “Manon Lescaut” by the Abbé Prévost) and the comedy “Miquette et sa Mère” (1950), neither of which was very successful, Clouzot retreated to his home ground of bleak fatalism — always more tolerable, somehow, in a suspense film than in other genres — in “The Wages of Fear,” his masterpiece, and “Diabolique.” These remain, along with his 1956 documentary “Le Mystère Picasso,” the only films of his still available on DVD in the United States. (The Criterion Collection, which distributes “The Wages of Fear” and “Diabolique,” issued editions of “Le Corbeau” and “Quai des Orfèvres” a few years ago but has since allowed both to go out of print.)\n\nBy the late 1950s Clouzot was an important enough personage in French film to be reviled by the fierce young critics of Cahiers du Cinema, some of whom — notably Jean-Luc Godard and Jacques Rivette — were soon to become luminaries of the Nouvelle Vague. For them Clouzot represented what they called, not admiringly, the Tradition of Quality: the older filmmakers whose classical, relatively impersonal approach to cinema seemed to the new generation stifling and inhospitable. Although Clouzot was certainly a classicist — his shooting style was, like Hitchcock’s, notoriously meticulous — his work is anything but impersonal: his pessimistic outlook pervades every movie, of every kind, he ever made. Even his Picasso film, radiant as it mostly is, ends in failure, as the artist, painting the same scene over and over, finally abandons his work, unable to fit whatever was in his eye and mind within the boundaries of the film’s frame.\n\nBut the Cahiers critics consigned Clouzot to the Tradition of Quality category anyway, and it must have seemed to him as if he had been condemned to yet another tiny room. His last two films, “La Vérité” and “La Prisonnière,” made after the New Wave had changed French film forever, are bitter, nervous, crabbed: the work of an inmate scratching pictures on the wall of his cell. But before those he indulged himself, just a little, in the nutty, Kafkaesque espionage movie “Les Espions” (1957), which, though a failure, contains one exchange that sums up his terrible vision of life. “Intelligence is a rattrap,” says one cynical spymaster. “To get in, the door is wide open, but to get out — closed!” An amateur agent protests, “There’s always a way out,” but it’s clear that Clouzot knows better. He was a prisoner of cinema, sometimes willingly, often not, and always in solitary."
