        "text": "In 1964, famed director Henri-Georges Clouzot (Wages of Fear, Diabolique) began work on what was to be his most ambitious film to date, Inferno, a thriller about jealousy and obsession akin to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.\n\nWhen the obsessive Clouzot was stricken by a heart attack 18 days into filming, the production ground to a halt. Tales of footage from this \"lost\" film tantalized film buffs for years. Then in 2005, archivist Serge Bromberg discovered 185 cans of film containing not only footage but amazing pre-production tests featuring ingenious use of color and camerawork that hint at the extraordinary film that would have resulted. Bromberg's documentary gives audiences a glimpse of the lost footage and brings together surviving crew members including Costa-Gavras (director of such films as Z and Missing), a production assistant on Inferno, to recount incredible tales from the film’s production. An archivist, director, writer, and more, Bromberg is the head of Lobster Films, an essential organization devoted to film preservation in France. (102 mins., 35mm)"
