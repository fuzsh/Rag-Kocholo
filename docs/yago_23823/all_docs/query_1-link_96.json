        "text": "La Vérité is a mystery of the best kind. A man is dead, and Dominique Marceau (Brigitte Bardot) is hauled up before a court. Henri-George Clouzot’s courtroom thriller not only refuses to give its audience the answers, but for quite a lot of time keeps the questions hidden. That Dominique pulled the trigger, it turns out, is not in question – what is in question is what exactly was the intent when that act occurred. As such, it’s not Dominique’s act that is on trial, but who she even is.\n\nThe film cuts back and forth cannily between the trial and the events that are under discussion. The trial itself is riveting, though in part because of an inexplicable French juridical system that is stacked against her from the start. There is satire at work here. Guérin (Charles Vanel), who represents Dominique, and Éparvier (Paul Meurisse), who represents the victim’s mother, are old chums, who greet one another happily either side of the trial, but fight tooth and nail while at work; they are professionals doing their job, and in that respect admirable, and yet the ease with which they check in and out of the case testifies to the cynicism of a court that leaves a young woman high and dry. Much worse is the bench, with Louise Seigner’s President of the Court in particular going heavily on the attack from the start, accusing Dominique of the worst kinds of immorality and refusing to believe anything she says in mitigation.\n\nThe court scenes are fantastically shot, with a variety of angles creating dynamic tension between the competing sides. But Clouzot saves his best work for the extended flashback sequences. The editing by Albert Jurgenson is particularly wonderful, capturing a Paris that flashes suddenly between different times and places; that captures long waits in the rain or a sudden passage of a period of prostitution; and that in one mesmerisingly scored sequence, choreographs a rush across town set to a piece of classical music that builds hope of a romantic reconciliation even as we can see she is running to the venue where her dying body will later be discovered.\n\nThe film achieves something extraordinary in making Dominique sympathetic, when she’s quite awful. She is mean and selfish towards her industrious sister Annie (Marie-José Nat); she is a slob who crosses boundaries and refuses to help her sister; she is reluctant to take a job or college course that requires her to get out of bed; and she shows a careless disregard for the feelings of others. Yet she is also representative of a new class of young people, interested in love and fun, music and chat, and falls in with a group of students, philosophers and ne’er-do-wells who, in the passionate testimony of would-be novelist Michel (Jean-Loup Reynold), speak a different language to the old people who are judging them. The class and generational conflict of France in the 60s become manifest in the synecdoche of the courtroom, where the puritanical judges simply cannot understand how a young woman could sleep with a man one day and it be over the next. Dominique is condemned as representative of her generation.\n\nWhile Dominique is cruel in certain respects, however, she is nothing to Gilbert Tellier (Sami Frey), one of the most horrific characters I recall seeing in film. Gilbert is Annie’s friend, a conductor in training, and he is fascinated by the bad girl he stumbles upon when he comes to visit Annie. Gilbert begins pursuing Dominique, and he is nothing short of creepy from the start. He is possessive and demanding, trying to get her into bed through guilt, pressure and attrition; she finally fucks him just to get it over with, only to find that she rather enjoys it. But once he has power over her, and she falls in love with him, he treats her abysmally – he hovers over her while she works as a cloakroom girl; he accuses her of affairs (on the basis of one one-night-stand); he refuses to support her financially. Their descent into mutual despair is painful to watch, but he goes on to become a famous composer while she finds herself trying to keep a brave face while homeless, even prostituting herself to a tourist for a few days to get a roof over her head."
