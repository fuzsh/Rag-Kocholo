        "text": "The other night I watched a classic I'd never seen before, Le Corbeau (1943), directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to make Quai des Orfevres (1947), Le Salaire de la Peur (The Wages of Fear) (1953), and Les Diabloliques (1955).\n\nIn the film, a doctor, Remy Germain (Pierre Fresnay), becomes the target, or the first target anyway, of poison-pen letters signed by \"Le Corbeau\" (The Raven), in which secrets are revealed and falsehoods spread. As more people in the village get these letters, as more unwanted information, true and false, winds up in the public sphere, distrust and anxiety mounts, and the village leaders will do anything to flush out Le Corbeau. It's both mystery and character study and village study, with sharp dialogue, beautiful black-and-white photography, and a gloriously ambiguous ending that, in a sense, makes us members of the village. Who do you trust? Who can you trust? How many people are involved anyway? It's seen as an indictment of the Gestapo in Vichy, France, but the indictment doesn't have to stop there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInteresting side note. At one point we see the good doctor reading one of the poison-pen letters and we get the following translation: \"I see all and I tell all.\" But if you look at the text it reads \"J'ai l'oeil americain et je dirai tout,\" which means, literally, \"I have the American eye and I will tell all.\"\n\nOne wonders: How did \"the American eye\" ever mean \"to see all\"?\n\nSo I did some quick Internet research. For a bottomless pit of information, there's not much out there and most of that's in French. From what I gather, though, the phrase related to the popularity, in France, of the early 19th-century novels of James Fenimore Cooper and his American Indian characters, who were far-seeing and eagle-eyed. Hawk-eyed, you might say. At one point, Madame Bovary even uses the phrase: \"J'ai vu Ã§a, moi, du premier coup, en entrant. J'ai l'oeil americain.\"\n\nHere's my question: Is the phrase still in use? One doubts it. America has come to mean something besides Indians in forests. More to the point, that American eye, in recent years, has become awfully myopic. It hasn't seen shit."
