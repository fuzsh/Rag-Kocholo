        "meta_description": "When a film shoot is in trouble, with actors dying on set, the heavens opening and other acts of God putting a spanner in the works, it’s usually a gigantic directorial ego which hauls the troubled production over the line. You think of Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate, of Coppola’s Apocalypse Now and above all Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, all films characterised by epic folie de grandeur and flirtation with insanity. But no film, surely, has ever been quite so divorced from reality, in almost every sense, as L'Enfer. For a start it was never made.",

        "text": "But no film, surely, has ever been quite so divorced from reality, in almost every sense, as L'Enfer. For a start it was never made. You can’t get a lot less real than that. Forty-five years on, Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno, part documentary, part reconstruction, attempts to explain why.\n\nClouzot is not to be confused with the hapless Inspector of almost the same name. Or at least I don’t think he is. In the Forties and Fifties he was one of France’s leading directors. By the time he came to make L’Enfer, he was in a position to extract from Columbia a limitless budget. He chose to make a film about a man who, domiciled in rural France with his delectable young wife, is unable to quell his irrational jealous rages. Eventually he murders her.\n\nIt sounds a modest enough idea for a film. It was shot in and around one lakeside location. And the cast was small, led by Romy Schneider, comely young starlet, as the wife, and Serge Reggiani as her slightly ugly older husband. But Clouzot’s ambition was to create a new cinematic language with which to convey the psychosis of his male character. This involved modernist distortions, weird trippy tricks with mirrors and lenses which must have been great fun to play around with in the lab. In the reels of film stock recently unearthed and forming the core of this documentary, they don’t do a whole lot to convince that Clouzot was onto something."
