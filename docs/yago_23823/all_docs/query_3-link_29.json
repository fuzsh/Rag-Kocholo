The doctor who is the primary target of the letters, Rémy Germain (Pierre Fresnay), struggles to deduce the identity of the anonymous rumormonger before still more dark secrets are revealed and the town destroys itself.\n\n“Propulsive and unsettling, the film offers more tense scenes of envelope opening than a lifetime’s worth of Oscar nights.” —Village Voice"
