        "text": "The Nazi Occupation of France is remembered as a golden age of French cinema. With over 200 films produced during the four years of the occupation, there was a 40 percent increase in movie attendance despite the virtual disappearance of all foreign films. British films had been banned, followed by American films, and few French had any interest in the German cinema being produced. French film had become more “French” than ever before. This development occurred, improbably, during a time of strict censorship by the occupying German and collaborating Vichy governments. Avoiding any overt political statements or representations of Occupation, filmmakers were now freed from the infrastructural and political disorganization of the 1930s. The Vichy government’s encouragement of “quality productions” and a collective commitment to aesthetic value gave rise to this “Cinema of Paradox”. Le Corbeau, the most controversial movie from the occupation and perhaps in French history, is not only an engrossing thriller, but a document of the paranoid fervor that defined life in France during the period. The film is emblematic of the paradoxes of the moment, while managing a radical depiction of the Occupation that has stood the test of time.\n\nLe Corbeau, released in 1943, is a mystery thriller directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. Set in a “small town, here or elsewhere” in rural France, the film depicts the paranoia and chaos caused by the mailing of a series of poison-pill letters. Signed under the pen name “Le Corbeau” (The Crow), the letters accuse various leaders of the community of impropriety ranging from adultery and corruption to, most seriously, the administration of abortion procedures by Rémy Germain (Pierre Fresnay), the town’s reclusive physician. The screenplay for the film, originally called L’oeil du serpent (The Eye of the Snake), was first written by Louis Chavance in 1937. It was based on a real-world instance of poison-pilled letters in the town of Tulle in 1917. A common phenomenon in France dating back to the latter days of the French monarchy, known as la delation, the mailing of anonymous accusations proliferated during World War II “at the urging of both the Germans and Vichy.” During the war, three million letters were sent “denouncing neighbors as Jews, Communists, resistance members, profiteers or petty criminals.” What was a relatively straightforward thriller in 1937 carried a newly charged reflection of contemporary France by the film’s release in 1943.\n\nClouzot had signed a long-term contract as a writer and later a writer-director with Continental Films, the German-controlled studio in Occupied France. Tasked with the mandate from the Nazi Party’s chief propagandist Joseph Goebbels to pacify the French population with sterile entertainment, most of Continental’s productions were “light comedies, costume dramas, fantasy films, love stories or thrillers.” Clouzot’s debut feature, L’assassin habite au 21, is a light-hearted detective story that falls into this category. Despite this, “Clouzot already sought to go beyond the superficiality of the studio formula; the film has several disorienting scenes of virtuoso cinematic paranoia.” With Le Corbeau, his second time behind the camera, Clouzot used the Continental formula to craft a darker tale, philosophical in nature, that belongs to the then-nascent French Film Noir genre. The film’s bitter outsider embroiled in a tangle of mysteries who is seduced by a femme fatale, as well atmospheric use of lighting and shadows, are recognizable staples of the genre. Clouzot had worked in Germany prior to the war and also took stylistic inspiration from German Expressionism, as seen in the canted shots of Marie (Héléna Manson) fleeing the mob.\n\nClouzot, “French cinema’s great misanthrope”, managed to offend all sides of the political sphere with Le Corbeau. The film performed well as a “succès de scandale.” The Vichy press was offended by Clouzot’s disregard for the ideals of the National Revolution; while Vichy cinema was to promote the family, rural and Catholic values of the revolution, Clouzot shone a light on the alienation, immorality, and distrust that existed in the provinces. The German censors decided it was too morbid to be shown in Germany. Critics in the French resistance, such as in L’Écran Francais, felt that Clouzot advanced a Nazi perspective that French towns were propagated with “degenerates, ripe for slavery.” Clouzot received a two-year ban from filmmaking following the liberation. This goes to show that Le Corbeau was seen as anything but apolitical.\n\nThe reputations of the filmmakers who stayed and worked either with Continental Films or under Vichy censorship were tarnished by association. The only real way to avoid a compromising position was to go abroad, which was a real possibility for artists and intellectuals with foreign connections. Various organizations had even been set up to help those wishing to flee, including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Emergency Rescue Committee. For some, though, fleeing meant abandoning France and surrendering the cultural landscape to the Germans. Clouzot, a man who had been fired from the German studio UFA for his association with Jewish producers, agreed to make films for the occupying force at a time when French artists were leaving the country. The ethical choice in such a scenario is unclear. This dilemma is reflected in Le Corbeau, which is largely a meditation on moral responsibility in times of social distrust.\n\nAt the center of the film are three competing moral codes expressed by the doctor Germain, the psychiatrist Vorzet (Pierre Larquey) and the grieving mother (Sylvie). Vorzet explains his belief in moral relativism with his analogy of the swinging light bulb. The line between darkness and the light that illuminates the globe is never clear, and Germain’s self-harming attempt to stop the swaying proves his point. To Vorzet, the letters don’t expose sin but rather a sense of guilt that is universal. Germain’s self-assured response to the uncertainty is a curt “I know myself.” The next morning, Germain speaks with the mother and learns of her plan to murder Le Corbeau, whom she holds responsible for her son’s death. Unlike Vorzet, her belief in right and wrong is principled and absolute, though she shocks Germain with her lack of faith in the social institutions of justice. Germain tells her she has no right to take the law into her own hands. “I’ll take the right,” she responds. The mother represents the revolutionary, whose moral certainty puts her at odds with the rule of law.\n\nThe conservative, the relativist, and the revolutionary are competing models for existence within a web of unjust systems. Clouzot doesn’t present a clear answer, though. In reality, he revels in the ambiguity of the text. Vorzet is vindicated by the hypocrisy of each and every town member. (Marie, who judges the actions of her sister, has in fact been trafficking morphine for Vorzet. Germain, based on Le Corbeau’s accusations, loses the business of the same woman who spies on the post box in an attempt to catch the crow.) The film also seems to prove Germain’s claim about the necessity of evil correct. Ultimately, the leaders of the community have acted unethically, and the importance of the rule of law is reified. Finally, the grieving mother receives the film’s empathy. Her actions are sympathetic and go unpunished. The final shot of her walking away leaves the filth of the crime scene in the hands of the viewer. With all the twists and turns of the plot, the audience is implicated in the antisocial behavior. Along for the ride, the viewer is just as reactionary as the townsfolk. The proliferation of letters, and the revelation of multiple crows, reveal that in order to feel safe, participation in a distrustful society becomes a race to the bottom. This isn’t treated as vindication, though. The sense of shame lingers, which explains the continued resentment towards the film even after liberation. In such a politically charged time, this embrace of ambiguity was in itself a radical gesture.\n\nCouched within a plausibly apolitical thriller that’s seeming misanthropy made it impossible to be claimed by any faction, the pathos of Clouzot’s masterpiece belongs to the grieving mother, a minor character whose arc is a rejection of the social forces that drive the self-destructive impulses of her community. Her loss places her outside the institutions that govern the behaviors of the villagers, and it’s her commitment and love for her son that is the only real emotion the film manages to hold on to. The “Cinema of Paradox” of the German Occupation is acutely expressed in Clouzot’s Le Corbeau. The movie’s intentions were difficult to pin down, angering most who saw it. Its ambiguity and cynicism made it non-threatening to the regime. Nonetheless, expressed within the film is a concern for those left in the wake of the anti-humanism that the fascist occupation exploited. Le Corbeau is a compelling portrait of its time and ageless in its nuanced exploration of human relations."
