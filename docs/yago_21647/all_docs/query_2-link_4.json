        "text": "Two roads along Delaware's northern border will close July 8, as Mark Ruffalo's HBO show, \"Task,\" takes over the mostly wooded area near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, for four days of shooting.\n\n\"Task\" is an upcoming spinoff of the popular HBO show \"Mare of Easttown,\" a detective procedural drama set in Pennsylvania's Chester and Delaware counties that held starring roles for both Kate Winslet and Wawa convenience stores.\n\nIn the new show, Mark Ruffalo will play an FBI agent, and so far it looks like \"Task\" will likewise be set in the scenic hills and glens of small-town Delaware Valley. Ruffalo has been spotted filming scenes all over the Delaware Valley for the upcoming series — though these road closures might mark the closest he's gotten to actual Delaware.\n\nSo what roads will close for Ruffalo's new series? And what's \"Task\" all about? And perhaps most important, will Mark Ruffalo be filming any scenes in Delaware? Here's what we know so far.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW PHOTO GALLERY\n\nMore: March Madness sheds light on 'Mare of Easttown' creator, whose brother coaches Blue Hens\n\nIn 2022: ‘Mare of Easttown’ would make Wawa lovers proud by bringing Delco a Golden Globe Award\n\nWhat Pennsylvania and Delaware roads will be closed to film the HBO series 'Task'?\n\nMotorists are advised of the following travel restrictions from Monday, July 8, through Thursday, July 11.\n\nBeaver Dam Road will be closed and detoured between Brandywine Creek Road and Beaver Valley Road, between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday, July 8 through 11. Detours will be to Brandywine Creek Road, Route 92 (Ramsey Road), and Beaver Valley Road.\n\nSmithbridge Road will be closed and detoured between Ridge Road and Heyburn Road during the same dates and times: Monday to Thursday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Vehicles will be detoured to Ridge Road and U.S. Route 202.\n\nWhat's Mark Ruffalo's new series, 'Task,' all about?\n\nThe limited series will be set in the same universe as the HBO series \"Mare of Easttown,\" the Kate Winslet murder drama set in the quiet real Chester County town of Eastttown. That show, from ChesCo-born creator Brad Inglesby, won a fistful of Emmys and helped turn Wawa into a household word for the parts of the country who didn't even know gas stations could also be a cult.\n\nInglesby's new follow-up mini-series, \"Task,\" will star Mark Ruffalo as a grizzled FBI agent in the same working-class collar counties of Philly. Ruffalo's character will try \"to put an end to a string of drug-house robberies led by an unsuspecting family man,\" according to the perplexingly worded summary on film site IMDB.\n\nJeremiah Zagar, who also directed the Philly-set, Adam Sandler basketball movie, \"Hustle,\" will direct.\n\nAnd as for Kate Winslet? Perhaps. But perhaps not. For those who miss \"Mare,\" Kate Winslet told Variety in a recent interview about a possible season 2 of \"Mare\" in which she would \"probably\" reprise that role. She then declined to specify quite what she meant by that.\n\nWhere has 'Task' been filmed so far, and has it crossed the Delaware border?\n\nSo far, Mark Ruffalo and the cast of \"Task\" have been spotted filming up and down the Delaware River, largely in Philadelphia's western suburbs.\n\nIn June, the Delaware County Council glowed that Mark Ruffalo had brought a \"slice of Hollywood to the Delaware County Government Center and Courthouse\" in Media, Pennsylvania, giving a few county employees the chance to pal around with Ruffalo and collect selfies.\n\nThe county website added that the \"Task\" crew had also been spotted \"in Ridley Township, Aston, Upper Chichester, Chadds Ford Township and Marcus Hook.\"\n\nIn May, \"Task\" shut down Philly's Italian Market. And the month before that, the show was in Newtown Square.\n\nBut as for Delaware? Well, the show has huddled at its borders before, at Chadds Ford and Marcus Hook. Per the PennDOT announcement this month, road closures for \"Task\" will indeed cross the line into the First State starting July 8.\n\nBut while the inconvenience of road detours will apparently cross into Delaware, it's unclear so far that filming for the Mark Ruffalo series will do the same.\n\nSeen Mark Ruffalo hanging out at Casapulla's or the Quoin?
