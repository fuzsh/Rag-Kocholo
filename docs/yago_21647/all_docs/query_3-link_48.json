        "text": "The 1930s\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAfter The Wolf Song and The Virginian, Fleming left Paramount and subsequently directed (with Fairbanks) the travelogue Around the World in 80 Minutes with Douglas Fairbanks (1931). Fleming signed at MGM in 1932 and quickly became one of the studio’s top directors. The Wet Parade (1932), a well-received adaptation of Upton Sinclair’s book about Prohibition, featured Huston and Myrna Loy. More popular was Red Dust (1932), arguably the best of several teamings of Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. A major box-office hit, the steamy jungle romance was filmed before censorship rules were tightened, and it featured teasing sexual banter that soon vanished from the screen. Fleming reteamed with Harlow on another success, Bombshell (1933), a satire of Hollywood, in which Lee Tracy was especially funny as an unscrupulous press agent.\n\nIn 1934 Fleming turned to family fare with Treasure Island, a solid adaptation of the oft-filmed Robert Louis Stevensonnovel; it starred Wallace Beery as Long John Silver and Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins. Reckless (1935), however, was one of Fleming’s rare misfires at MGM. The musical featured Harlow—though her dancing scenes were performed by doubles and her singing was dubbed—and it proved controversial for a plotline that seemed to draw on the 1932 suicide of her husband, Paul Bern. Fleming rebounded with the hugely successful Captains Courageous (1937). The family drama was a sentimental but affecting version of the Rudyard Kipling novel about a spoiled rich boy (played by Freddie Bartholomew) who learns about life after falling from an ocean liner and being rescued by fishermen. Spencer Tracy won his first Academy Award for his performance as the Portuguese fisherman who befriends the boy, and the film was also nominated for a best picture Oscar. The snappy Test Pilot (1938) was almost as good, with Gable, Loy, and Tracy forming an atypical but interesting romantic triangle.\n\nIn 1939 Fleming helped make two of Hollywood’s all-time classics—though neither began with him as the director. The Wizard of Oz, a musical based on L. Frank Baum’s novel, was initially directed by Richard Thorpe, but he was fired soon after filming began. Several directors subsequently worked on the production, though Fleming was the only one to receive credit; King Vidor was responsible for the black-and-white Kansas scenes. A box-office disappointment when first released, it later became a family classic and an icon of pop culture, with numerous memorable songs, quotes, and characters. It also made a star of Judy Garland."
