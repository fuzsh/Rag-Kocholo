        "text": "Our Daily Bread is a 1934 American drama film directed by King Vidor and starring Karen Morley, Tom Keene, and John Qualen. The film is a sequel to Vidor's silent classic The Crowd (1928), using the same characters although with different actors.\n\nA couple, down on their luck during the Great Depression, move to a farm to try to make a go of living off the land. They have no idea what to do at first, but soon find other downtrodden people to help them. Soon they have a collective of people, some from the big city, who work together on a farm. A severe drought is killing the crops. The people then dig a ditch by hand, almost two miles long, to divert water from a creek to irrigate the crops.\n\nFollow CUNY TV:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CUNYTV\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/cunytv\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cuny.tv/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@cunytv\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cunytv/\n\nFind more from CUNY TV at https://tv.cuny.edu\n\nRecording Date 04/19/2024 First Air Date 05/31/2024\n\nThe best in world cinema is showcased in City Cinematheque, CUNY TV's much-loved flagship weekend film series.
