        "text": "POSTCARD 1 (SOLD)\n\nPOSTCARD 2 (SOLD)\n\nPostcard 1 is a vintage real photo postcard featuring silent film actress Florence Vidor (1895-1977). Florence was born in Houston, Texas. She began working in silent films due to the influence of her husband, King Vidor. He was a film director, film producer, and screenwriter. The pair married in 1915. Her first film contract was with Vitagraph Studios in 1916. She became a well known actress after her appearance in “Hail the Woman” (1921). Florence was noted to be one of early Hollywood’s great beauties. During the 1920’s, she was a major star for Paramount Pictures. She was the leading lady to actors Sessue Hayakawa and “drag star”, Julian Eltinge. She also acted for director Cecil B. DeMille. Sound films brought about the end of her performing career. In fact, she had so much difficulty with sound films, that she retired from acting before finishing the movie in which she was appearing. Florence divorced her husband in 1924. She married the talented and popular classical violinist, Jascha Heifetz in 1928. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1945. This photo portrait postcard can be found in the collection of the National Museum of American History (Smithsonian Institute). This vintage postcard is uncommon. SOLD\n\nPostcard 2 was published by Alfred Noyer as part of a series (No.351). Note the logo for Paramount Films in the bottom right hand corner of the image. SOLD\n\nPOSTCARD 1"
