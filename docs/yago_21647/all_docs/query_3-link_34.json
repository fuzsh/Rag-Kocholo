        "text": "King Vidor (1894–1982) had the longest career of any Hollywood director, and his works include some of the most dramatic, sublime moments in the history of American cinema. Regarded by many film historians as one of the greatest of silent era filmmakers—especially for masterworks The Big Parade, The Crowd, and Show People—Vidor is nonetheless one of the most underrated of Hollywood’s “old masters” in terms of his overall career. His sound era films include Hallelujah, Street Scene, The Champ, The Stranger’s Return, Our Daily Bread, Stella Dallas, The Citadel, Northwest Passage, Duel in the Sun, Beyond the Forest, The Fountainhead, Ruby Gentry and War and Peace. He also helped to establish the Screen Directors Guild and served as its first president.\n\nThis book charts the ways in which Vidor’s vast, complex body of work ranges over diverse genres and styles while also expressing his recurring personal interests in spirituality (especially Christian Science), aesthetics, metaphysics, social realism, and the myth of America. The first book since 1988 to give a comprehensive view of Vidor’s career, it discusses his artistic evolution in a way that appeals to the general reader as well as to the film scholar.\n\nAcknowledgments vi\n\nPreface 1\n\nIntroduction: A Boy’s Love of Moving Images 5\n\nOne. 1913–1917: Missing Reels and First Films 11\n\nTwo. 1918–1919: The Turning Point 15\n\nBud’s Recruit (1918) 15\n\nThe Turn in the Road, Better Times, The Other Half, Poor Relations (All 1919) 18\n\nThree. 1920–1921: The Humanist Emerges 24\n\nThe Family Honor, The ­Jack-Knife Man, Mothercraft, The Sky Pilot, and Love Never Dies 24\n\nFour. 1922–1923: Rising and Falling Stars 37\n\nThe Woman of Bronze, Three Wise Fools, The Real Adventure, Dusk to Dawn, Conquering the Woman, and Peg O’ My Heart 37\n\nFive. 1924: Personality Crisis 46\n\nWild Oranges 46\n\nGulliver’s Travels, Happiness, Wine of Youth, His Hour, The Wife of the Centaur 51\n\nSix. 1925: Proud Flesh and The Big Parade 59\n\nProud Flesh 59\n\nThe Big Parade 61\n\nSeven. 1926: La Bohème and Bardelys the Magnificent 71\n\nLa Bohème 71\n\nBardelys the Magnificent 76\n\nEight. 1927–1928: The Crowd, The Patsy, and Show People 81\n\nThe Crowd (1928) 81\n\nThe Patsy (1928) 93\n\nShow People (1928) 97\n\nNine. 1929: Hallelujah 102\n\nTen. 1930: Not So Dumb and Billy the Kid 110\n\nNot So Dumb 110\n\nBilly the Kid 113\n\nEleven. 1931: Street Scene and The Champ 119\n\nStreet Scene 119\n\nThe Champ 122\n\nTwelve. 1932: Bird of Paradise and Cynara 128\n\nBird of Paradise 128\n\nCynara 132\n\nThirteen. 1933: The Stranger’s Return 136\n\nFourteen. 1934–1936: Our Daily Bread, So Red the Rose, The Wedding Night, and The Texas Rangers 147\n\nOur Daily Bread (1934) 147\n\nSo Red the Rose (1935) 152\n\nThe Wedding Night (1935) 157\n\nThe Texas Rangers (1936) 160\n\nFifteen. 1937: Stella Dallas 165\n\nSixteen. 1938–1939: The Citadel and The Wizard of Oz 173\n\nThe Citadel (1938) 173\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939) 182\n\nSeventeen. 1940: Comrade X and Northwest Passage 185\n\nComrade X 185\n\nNorthwest Passage 190\n\nEighteen. 1941–1944: H.M.

A first-rate book that should become the standard Vidor reference for years to come.”—Booklist"
