        "meta_description": "The Turn in the Road: Directed by King Vidor. With George Nichols, Lloyd Hughes, Winter Hall, Helen Jerome Eddy. Paul Perry, the son of Perryville's wealthiest citizen, marries Reverend Matthew Barker's younger daughter Evelyn, while her sister June, who disputes her father's sermons preaching that it is God's will that sends affliction, hides her own love for Paul. When Evelyn dies in childbirth, Paul nearly goes insane. His questions to Reverend Barker about God's role in Evelyn's death shake Barker's faith. Barker's new sermons, focusing on God's love, arouse his wealthy congregation to dismiss him. Meanwhile, Paul searches for God's truth but becomes a derelict in Chicago. June takes Paul's child Bob to Chicago, but returns after being fired for refusing her employer's advances. Paul's father Hamilton, who denies wage increases at his iron works, is about to be shot by his employees, when Bob, now six, visits with his six puppies. His lovable nature subdues the workers, and Hamilton, also softened, complies with their requests. After Paul returns and learns that Bob, whose philosophy of love has touched him, is his own son, his happiness returns.",
