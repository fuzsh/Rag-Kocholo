        "text": "Story\n\n13 August 2024\n\nA Commitment to Lesotho: UN’s High-Level Visit Aims to Boost Food Security\n\nLesotho, grappling with a severe food insecurity crisis exacerbated by prolonged drought and El Niño impacts, had more than 699,000 Basotho facing food insecurity by early July 2024. In response, Prime Minister Samuel Matekane declared a state of food disaster on 12 July 2024.A high-level delegation from three United Nations agencies: FAO, WFP and IFAD visited Lesotho from 4th to 6th August 2024 to address this urgent situation. The visit aimed to bolster agricultural investment and support efforts to improve food and nutrition security in the country.Invited by His Majesty King Letsie III, who serves as the FAO Special Goodwill Ambassador for Nutrition, the delegation included FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, WFP Assistant Executive Director for Programme and Policy Development Valerie Guarnieri, and IFAD Associate Vice-President for Programme Management Donald Brown. This visit underscored the UN’s commitment to tackling Lesotho’s pressing food insecurity issues.Lesotho has faced significant challenges in achieving self-sufficiency in food production, particularly in cereals, meat, and vegetables. Even in favourable years, the country heavily relied on food imports, primarily from South Africa. The ongoing drought, poor rainfall, and rising global food prices had further deteriorated the situation, increasing vulnerability and unemployment.Despite these challenges, Lesotho possesses substantial potential for expanding its horticulture, livestock, and dairy industries, with opportunities in trout farming and growing fruits and vegetables. However, only a small fraction of arable land was actively farmed, and even less was under irrigation.The agriculture sector, which employs around 38% of the population, is essential for poverty alleviation and rural development. There is a pressing need for investments in sustainable farming practices and green technologies to enhance resilience in Lesotho’s agricultural sector.The National Strategic Development Plan II (NSDP II) has recognized the importance of improving nutrition through enhanced agricultural production and resilience. It stresses the interdependence of agriculture and ecosystem health, aiming to reverse environmental degradation and adapt to climate change.During their visit, the UN delegation engaged in field visits, stakeholder meetings, and discussions with government officials, private sector representatives, women and youth groups, and people with disabilities. Key activities included:Sunday, 4th August: A joint field visit to Leribe Mahobong, attended by His Majesty King Letsie III and the Prime Minister. Monday, 5th August: A stakeholder meeting in Maseru, where representatives from FAO, WFP, IFAD, civil society, and beneficiaries discussed the state of food systems. Agriculture Market Day: An event showcasing local agricultural produce and innovations in Masianokeng, Maseru. Tuesday, 6th August: A high-level dialogue on food systems at Maseru Avani, followed by a press conference. During the High-Level Dialogue on Food Systems, His Majesty King Letsie III underscored the critical need to expand agricultural finance in Lesotho, stating, \"The cost of agriculture transformation is enormous; thus, access to finance is a catalyst for growth and it must be addressed urgently.\"King Letsie III highlighted the challenges faced by the agricultural sector, noting that financial institutions often minimized their exposure to agriculture due to perceived high-risk considerations. \"It is our belief and hope that beyond this gathering, issues regarding access to finance in the agriculture space will be addressed,\" he said.He remarked that while there were significant impediments to the growth of a high-value agro-food system in Lesotho, finance remained a crucial catalyst for transformation. \"To realize advancements in the agro-food value chain, it is essential to have innovative instruments designed by the private sector to mobilize additional resources, address market failures, and remove barriers,\" he added.The dialogue occurred against the backdrop of a severe food insecurity crisis in Lesotho. \"An alarming 700,000 Basotho—nearly one-third of the country’s population—faced severe food insecurity, a sharp increase from 582,000 last year. The resources required to meet this crisis surged from M1 billion in March 2023 to M3 billion last year and M3 billion this year,\" King Letsie III noted.In her address, Delekazi Mokebe, CEO of First National Bank Lesotho and spokesperson for the Bankers Association of Lesotho (BAL), addressed concerns about banks providing credit to farmers. She explained, “The question in the room is, ‘Do banks provide credit to farmers?’ And the answer is yes, of course they do.”FAO Director-General Dr. Qu Dongyu stressed the importance of coordination and timely delivery during the visit. \"The first step was to build strength, followed by finding innovative solutions and then swiftly taking action,\" he advised. He also outlined the three components of food security: food availability, food accessibility, and food affordability, noting their varying levels of challenges worldwide.Dr. Qu commended His Majesty for designating August as \"Food Month\" in Lesotho, reflecting the government’s prioritization of food security. He emphasized the critical need for agrifood systems transformation to achieve food security and support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), stating, “We all need to work together as one big team.”The visit represented a significant effort to strengthen cooperation between the government, the UN, and local and international partners to achieve food and nutrition security in Lesotho and ensure that future investments in the agricultural sector are impactful and sustainable.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n17 May 2024\n\nSeeds of Resilience: Transforming Lives in Ha Soai Village\n\nIn the heart of Thaba Tseka, nestled beneath the expansive African sky, lies Ha Soai village. On a crisp morning of March 20, 2024, a team comprising UNICEF and World Vision embarked on a poignant journey, eager to witness firsthand the transformative impact of their collaborative project. Their destination held promise: Ha Soai, where the spirit of community thrives despite challenges.Tales of change and progress unfolded as the team gathered with Chief Soai and 27 villagers. Through the The Ntlafatsa Bana Programme efforts, essential social services reached their doorstep, sparking empowerment and fostering a sense of belonging. Among the remarkable outcomes was the establishment of two nutrition clubs within the village, symbolizing newfound resilience.For ‘Mamolotsi Soai, a dedicated mother and active Ha Soai Nutrition Club member, the project has been a lifeline amid hardship. Balancing her husband's and three children's needs against the backdrop of drought and scarce resources is a daily struggle. Yet, within the solidarity of her community lies solace and strength.Through the nutrition club, Mmamolotsi has gained invaluable knowledge of homestead gardening, water conservation, and child protection. These skills sustain her family with diverse vegetables and cultivate resilience in adversity. As she tends to her modest garden, Mmamolotsi reflects on the profound impact of the project on her life and those around her.The nutrition club, offering services from immunization to cooking demonstrations, has become a lifeline for Ha Soai, illuminating a path towards a brighter future. In the face of the El Nino crisis of 2023-2024 and dwindling water sources, their resilience shines as a testament to Lesotho's communities' determination and strength.The Ntlafatsa Bana Programme, a UNICEF and EU co-funded initiative, seeks to enhance the well-being and development of children under five in beneficiary homes of the Child Grant Programme. Building on previous phases, this iteration aims to bridge the Child Grants Program with essential services, nurturing a brighter tomorrow for future generations.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n22 April 2024\n\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children Visits Lesotho: A Catalyst for Change\n\nFrom the 15th to the 17th of April 2024, Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, marked her first visit to Lesotho since the start of her appointment in 2019. This visit coincided with her attendance at the 43rd Ordinary Session of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child held in Maseru. Dr. M’jid's schedule was packed with not only her participation in the conference but also several important bilateral meetings aimed at addressing critical issues facing children in Lesotho.A Series of High-Profile MeetingsDr. M’jid’s engagements in Lesotho brought her face-to-face with a number of the nation’s most influential figures. Among them were Her Majesty, Queen Masenate Mohato Seeiso, Prime Minister Samuel Matekane, Dr. Ntoi Rapapa the Minister of Education, and Mpotjoane Lejone, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Relations. The United Nations Country Team in Lesotho, representatives from civil society organizations, and Dr. Mahlape Morai, the Acting Commissioner of Police, also held discussions with Dr. M’jid.The objective of these meetings was multifold: to raise awareness about the plight of children in Lesotho, to assess the progress and challenges in safeguarding children's rights, and to catalyze action across all sectors of society.Dr. M’jid commended Lesotho for its investments in education, acknowledging the steps the country has taken towards improving the lives of its youngest citizens. However, she also pointed out that despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. Issues such as child labor, child marriage, and violence against children persist. The discussions revealed a pressing need for the acceleration of laws and policies aimed at protecting children. Dr. M’jid emphasized, “In my engagements with the various stakeholders who work on children’s issues in Lesotho, I can say that there is progress, however, there are still many challenges. We need to work to ensure sustainable access for all children.”Recognizing the complexities of the issues at hand, Dr. M’jid advocated for practical, sustainable solutions. She highlighted the essential role of establishing a human rights commission aligned with the Paris Principles to guarantee the rights' enjoyment for everyone, particularly children. She pointed out the imperative of incorporating children in decision-making, financial, and development strategies that prioritize the safeguarding of children's rights as a foundation for their genuine rights enjoyment and protection. According to Dr. M’jid, children are not just beneficiaries but are part of the solution to the challenges they face such as violence and the negative influence of gang culture.Moving Forward: A Unified ApproachThe visit by Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid to Lesotho represents a pivotal moment in the country's ongoing efforts to protect and promote the rights of children. It highlights the international community's commitment to supporting Lesotho in its endeavors but also underlines the intrinsic challenges that remain.The government of Lesotho and stakeholders are now faced with the task of translating the discussions and recommendations from these meetings into tangible actions. This entails not only speeding up the implementation of protective laws and policies but also fostering an environment where children's voices are heard and considered in the formulation of those policies.Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid's visit to Lesotho serves as a catalyst for change, offering a unique opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to protect the country's most vulnerable population. By commending the progress already made and highlighting the areas that need further attention, Dr. M’jid has advocated for collective action. The ultimate goal is clear: to ensure that every child in Lesotho can grow up in a safe, supportive environment that nurtures their development and upholds their rights. As Lesotho moves forward, the hope is that this visit will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the country's commitment to its children, one characterized by renewed vision and collaborative effort towards lasting change.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n17 November 2023\n\nSEBABATSO’s Visionary Leap Forward for Lesotho's Youth\n\nA modern tale of transformation is being written in the Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho, where King Moshoeshoe I once wove a vision of inclusiveness and unity. In October 2023, s, a visionary Prime Minister’s vanguard initiative took flight, aimed at empowering the youth of Lesotho. This initiative is SEBABATSO, which translates to 'We Grow Together', a name resonating with the core principle of inclusivity it strives to uphold. SEBABATSO, inaugurated by The Right Honourable Prime Minister Samuel Ntsokoane Matekane on the 25th of October 2023, confronted an enormous adversary: the high rates of unemployment among the nation's youth, exacerbated by a challenging economic landscape. The initiative’s mission was bold and clear: to foster the growth of youth-led businesses, preparing them for investment on both national and international stages. It casts its net across vital sectors—agriculture, arts, science, technology, and tourism—employing entrepreneurship as the lever for economic transformation. Acknowledging this untapped potential in STEAM fields, where only 2% of Lesotho’s tertiary graduates currently venture, the initiative is boldly confronting the underrepresentation of women in these fields, striving to create an inclusive and equitable environment for innovation. The Prime Minister’s Initiative for Youth Empowerment is a visionary approach designed to overcome the economic challenges faced by young entrepreneurs, it incorporates a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy, involving collaboration with key Ministries, private sector stakeholders, civil society, and potential investors. On the launch day, over 600 hopeful young Basotho entrepreneurs convened, eager to shape their destinies. Among them was a resilient mother of three from Qacha's Nek, embodying the resolve that SEBABATSO sought to champion. This initiative, through its partnership with the United Nations in Lesotho, not only laid down a foundation for youth entrepreneurship but also held a mirror to the principle of leaving no one behind—asserting that dignity is fundamental and benefits of development should first reach those furthest behind. The three-day event at ’Manthabiseng Convention Centre was not just a conference; it was a catalyst for change, sparking a movement that aimed to elevate Lesotho’s youth to new heights. Teboho Semoli, a young entrepreneur and founder of a small dairy company, expressed his gratitude and enthusiasm for SEBABATSO: “Youth unemployment in Lesotho is extremely high. The government cannot employ all of us. This initiative is our lifeline, empowering us to start businesses, create jobs, and lift our communities out of poverty.” The Prime Minister’s call for action did not fall on deaf ears. Investors, local and international, from both public and private sectors, convened to discuss and pledge their support for Basotho youth-owned businesses. Mathabo Makoko, the Lesotho Revenue Services Commissioner, highlighted the significance of such partnerships: “We have incubated youth businesses and watched them flourish, creating jobs and contributing to our nation’s prosperity.” The SEBABATSO Initiative was not merely a response but a call to action to the youth of Lesotho, urging them to rise, innovate, and drive the nation's future. Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the UN Resident Coordinator, rightly put it, “Empowering our youth through entrepreneurship weaves a golden thread through every facet of our economy, creating jobs, boosting our GDP, and inspiring others to follow suit.” As discussions during the SEBABATSO conference sessions unfolded, it was apparent that revamping Lesotho’s education system is integral. By integrating critical life skills, emphasizing STEAM, and making subjects like agriculture, financial literacy, and emotional intelligence mandatory, the nation could equip its youth for the challenges of the 21st century. The conference explored challenges and opportunities in STEAM, fostering a dialogue that spanned across the African continent. It brought attention to the necessity of protecting Basotho innovations and called for a transformative approach to education, ensuring that the future generations of Lesotho are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive. SEBABATSO represents a significant step forward for Lesotho, as it works to unlock the potential of its youth and pave the way for a sustainable, prosperous future. Through this initiative, the Government of Lesotho is not just addressing the immediate issue of unemployment; it is investing in the nation's most valuable asset – its young people. As SEBABATSO gains momentum, it promises to be a beacon of hope, innovation, and economic transformation for Lesotho.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n20 October 2023\n\nEnding Gender-Based Violence in Lesotho and Beyond\n\nGender-Based Violence (GBV) is a pernicious issue in Southern Africa where prevalence is particularly high compared to the rest of the world - between half and two-thirds of all women state that they have experienced violence at some point in their lives compared to one third internationally. GBV is a complex and multifaceted issue that has a variety of root causes, including patriarchal social norms and cultural beliefs that reinforce traditional gender roles and place men in positions of power and often perpetuate the idea that men have a right to control women and their bodies, economic inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of access to education and resources, lack of legal protections and enforcement contributing to the impunity of GBV perpetrators, gender-based discrimination, but also substance abuse and mental health issues. These factors often interact with one another in complex ways, are highly intertwined and can vary depending on the context and culture. Addressing GBV requires a comprehensive approach that addresses all these underlying factors concomitantly, promotes gender equality, changes harmful social norms, protects women’s rights, strengthens women’s economic empowerment and ensures access to adequate services and resources for survivors. In the heart of Southern Africa, an alarming rise in gender-based violence (GBV), especially against women and girls, has sounded a clarion call. GBV is tearing apart the lives of women and girls, hindering development, and stifling progress. In the mountainous landscapes of Lesotho, over 86% of Basotho women and girls have experienced GBV at one point or another in their lives. Lesotho, under the leadership of its UN Resident Coordinator, Ms Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, decided it was time to take bold steps. The RCO Lesotho knew that this vision could not be achieved in isolation. It required a collective effort, a united front to combat GBV comprehensively. They reached out to UN Resident Coordinators in Botswana, Eswatini, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia, igniting a spark of collaboration for a transformative change. Recognizing this urgency, the United Nations, in collaboration with the Spotlight Initiative, has initiated a ground-breaking five-year program to combat GBV across six Southern African countries: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia. The RCO Lesotho has played the role of a catalyst, bridging gaps, facilitating dialogue, and ensuring that the collective efforts remained on course. They meticulously coordinated the development of a Sub-Regional Joint Programme on GBV, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at tackling GBV from all angles—prevention, response, and support. A High-level Partnership round-table was held with the participation of representatives from the six countries. The attendees included high-level officials from government, development partners, AU, SADC, private sector, civil society, and the UN. The Honorable Minister Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma – Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities graced the event and the Her Majesty Queen Masenate Mohato Seeiso of the Kingdom of Lesotho joining online. Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the UN Resident Coordinator for Lesotho, provided insights into the Lesotho-specific challenges and expectations. She touchingly remarked on the importance of peace as a precursor to a GBV-free society. For many women, peace remains an elusive concept, restricted not just to public spaces but their private sanctuaries. Additionally, Her Majesty the Queen of Lesotho, who virtually participated in the roundtable, lent her influential voice and support to the initiative, indicating the nation's commitment at the highest level. As part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, which unfortunately records some of Africa's highest rape cases, the challenge for Lesotho is twofold. Firstly, to address the immediate issue of GBV within its boundaries and secondly, to participate in a sub-regional approach ensuring that as a collective, the Southern African nations rise above this challenge. Collective Action and Collaboration The discussions, punctuated by contributions from various national representatives, emphasized the importance of a collaborative approach. As noted by UN Botswana Resident Coordinator, Zia Choudhury, ending GBV requires a collective effort, bringing together governments, NGOs, academia, private sector, and, importantly, survivors. Minister in the Presidency for South Africa responsible for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's message was clear - to end GBV, we need to empower women economically and educationally, reducing their dependency on men. The message was unmistakable; all the partners unanimously concurred that addressing gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative. What remains is the provision of the necessary resources, both in terms of technical expertise and financial support. Way Forward for Lesotho In line with the global Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 5 focusing on gender equality, Lesotho needs to strategize and implement policies that address the root causes of GBV. The nation has to invest in awareness campaigns, legislative changes, and most importantly, foster an environment where survivors feel safe to come forward. Substance abuse, often interlinked with GBV, requires attention, as pointed out by Dr. Dlamini Zuma in her closing remarks. Establishing rapid response teams at local levels, equipped to deal with reported GBV cases promptly, can be a game-changer for Lesotho. Furthermore, by amplifying the voices of women in the fight against GBV, Lesotho can create a robust and resilient narrative of strength, hope, and change. As Lesotho stands at the precipice of change, initiatives like these serve as a beacon of hope for the countless women and girls affected by GBV. Through collective regional efforts, backed by global partners, Lesotho has the opportunity to transform itself into a nation where every individual, regardless of gender, can live with dignity, free from fear. The journey might be arduous, but the resolve, as was showcased at the roundtable meeting, is unwavering. The hope is that in the not-too-distant future, every woman and girl in Lesotho and its neighboring countries can truly know what peace feels like. There can be no achievement of development without peace. Peace is not just a goal; it is a prerequisite for achieving development goals, and violence remains an obstacle to these objectives.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n08 July 2024\n\nThe Government of Japan, in collaboration with the Government of Lesotho and UNICEF Unveil Groundbreaking Community Health Information Systems\n\nThe project aims to enhance information systems by leveraging the essential role of community health workers in data collection and healthcare monitoring, including neighborhood-level immunization campaigns.The two community health information systems introduced are the Georeferenced Community Health Worker Master List and the Community Health Information System (Bophelo Ka Mosebeletsi, BKM) which leverages on a previously developed UNDP and ECONET tool. The master list stores and manages data on the employment history of Village Health Workers, facilitating strategic planning, training, deployment, payment, supply supervision, and monitoring. Further, the Bophelo Ka Mosebeletsi (BKM) system will assist Village Health Workers in collecting, storing, and managing service delivery data about the clients they serve, ensuring appropriate security standards for protecting personal patient information.The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need to standardize and digitalize surveillance and administrative data from communities. Previously, data captured by village healthcare workers were not consistently integrated into the national health management information system, hindering the Ministry of Health's ability to monitor and provide feedback on the COVID-19 vaccination rollout and maintain essential health services during the pandemic. The launch of the Community Health Worker Master List will go a long way in ensuring that surveillance and administrative data collected by Village Health Workers is digitalized and incorporated into the Health Management Information System (HMIS), which will in turn enhance decision-making and planning processes for primary healthcare services including vaccination, nutrition and other maternal neonatal and child health services.The Government of Japan has supported the Government of Lesotho with a total investment of USD 2.8 million to bolster Lesotho's emergency preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen community and health systems.UNICEF Lesotho Representative Mr. Deepak Bhaskaran expressed gratitude for Japan's generous support, underscoring the positive impact on Basotho children's health and well-being. “The Government of Japan has been supporting UNICEF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Basotho children’s health and well-being and to strengthen community and health systems to prepare and respond to public health emergencies in Lesotho.”Mr. Takuya Januma, the Second Secretary of the Embassy of Japan, on behalf of the Ambassador of Japan, H.E. Shigeru Ushio, reiterated Japan's commitment to the partnership. “Japan has been deeply committed to contributing to Lesotho’s priority areas such as health, education, agriculture, food security, climate change, border, and migration management through technical assistance, grant aid, and assistance for Grassroots Human Security projects. I look forward to further promoting our bilateral relations and contributing to the development of Lesotho.” END About UNICEFUNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children.

Under the national home-grown school feeding programme, WFP sources local produce from smallholder farmers to provide children nutritious mid-day meals on every school day. The programme links local farmers to the education sector by facilitating their access to the school feeding market. “We are grateful to the Principality of Monaco for this timely support at a critical time in the country,” says Aurore Rusiga, WFP’s Country Director in Lesotho. “The school feeding programme is a game changer. Its benefits are evident and manifold in the communities we work. The schools provide local farmers with a predictable outlet for their products, leading to a stable income, more investments and higher production. The children enjoy nutritious, diversified food, making it more likely that they will stay in school, be healthier, perform better thus improve their future prospects.”\n\nThrough this initiative which is implemented in partnership with both the Ministry of Education and Training and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, school children will have the opportunity to enhance their nutrition through provision of beans, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. “The Government of the Principality of Monaco is deeply convinced that school feeding programs, one of the Monegasque Cooperation’s flagship programmes, have direct and multiple benefits to the child – in terms of health, nutrition, access to education and learning”, says Bénédicte SCHUTZ, Special Representative for International Cooperation. “We are very pleased to work alongside WFP through this new partnership in Lesotho, with a mutual vision to help the most vulnerable in the fight against hunger and accessing their right to food.”\n\nWFP’s School Feeding programme supports the Ministry of Education’s development plan, which aims to educate all children, especially those from vulnerable families. Over the past decade, school feeding has helped ensure access to quality education by reduce the rate of dropping out as well as improve child nutrition and increase child enrolment in schools. In 2023, WFP and its partners provided nutritious meals to over 50,000 pre-school learners between the ages of 2 and 5 in 2,500 schools while more than 100 farmers sold their produce to schools.ENDS The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering\n\nfrom conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @wfp_media, @WFP_Africa & @aurorerusigawfp\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nMorongoe Masilo, WFP/Lesotho, Mob. +266 59912859 Email: morongoe.masilo@wfp.org\n\nMalehloa Letsie, WFP/ Lesotho, Mob. +266 50668018 Email: malehloa.letsie@wfp.org\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n09 December 2022\n\nHuman Rights Day Statement by the UN Resident Coordinator\n\nThe end of the 16 days of activism against gender based violence is a hard phenomenon to celebrate or commemorate. This is because of the need to advocate for an end to gender based violence is work we should do all year. This time coincides always with an important time when the world celebrates and commemorates Human Rights Day. This year’s Human Rights Day theme is celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) under the slogan “Dignity, Freedom and Justice for All”. In his message, Volker Türk the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has this year underlined that “On this Human Rights Day, we reiterate the need and relevance of human rights now as they were seventy-six years ago. Our hope is to increase knowledge of the UDHR as a foundational blueprint for taking concrete actions to stand up for human rights and tackle pressing global issues today”. To ensure that the ideals enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights become reality for Basotho, there is a role for everyone to play in ensuring respect, promotion and protection of human rights for all. The passing of The Persons with Disability Equity Act by the government of Lesotho has signified the commitment to ensure and safeguard the rights of people with disability in Lesotho. This Act now needs to be fully implemented to truly ensure that all Basotho with disabilities enjoy the full protection of and provision of their rights. Human rights start at the family level permeating to communities, schools, the workplace and to parliament. Indeed, as one of the lead drafters of the Universal Declaration Eleanor Roosevelt said in 1958: “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he/she lives in; the school or college he/she attends; the factory, farm, or office where he/she works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seek equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.” The UN commits to continue working with the Government of Lesotho towards strengthening a national human rights legislative, policy and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. One of the institutions that will strengthen the national protection framework for human rights is the Human Rights Commission whose establishment is still awaited. This year’s activities on the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence across the country have indicated a need for more engagement, more platforms and more importantly a need for a better coordinated and systematic approach to ending gender based violence in Lesotho. Throughout the several activities in commemoration of 16 Days of Activism, numerous stories were told of women and girls that have survived gender based violence and remembered with sadness those that have died and whose stories we can only tell. We heard from a sixteen-year-old girl who as a result of being raped by her father is now a young mother to her own sister. Of the many dreams she has, she shared how she would like to go back to school and be able to raise her child. Gender based violence does not only affect individuals through the violence in their bodies, but it also affects children born of such incidences, children that live through these circumstances, affects productivity and production thus the economy. It has a bearing on our health systems, affects development and truly impacts all aspects of our lives. The UN joins the people of Lesotho to advocate against gender based violence for 365 days. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is as relevant today as it was when it was adopted 75 years ago. It has withstood the tests of the passing years, and the advent of dramatic new technologies and social, political and economic developments that its drafters could not have foreseen. For instance, its provisions are so fundamental that they can be applied to every new dilemma including new phenomena like artificial intelligence, the digital world and countering the effects of climate change on people. Everyone is entitled to all the freedoms listed in the Universal Declaration \"without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\" Gender is a concept that is addressed in almost every clause of the Declaration. For its time, the document was remarkably lacking in sexist language. The document refers to \"everyone,\" \"all\" or \"no one\" throughout its 30 Articles. Indeed, for the first time in the history of international law-making, women played a prominent role in drafting the Universal Declaration. But, 75 years after its adoption, the work the Universal Declaration lays down for us to do is far from over, and it never will be. It is the duty of everyone to ensure that the provisions of the Universal Declaration and all the international and regional treaties to which Lesotho is party are turned into a reality for the people of Lesotho especially the most marginalised.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n07 December 2021\n\nLesotho: European Union continues to support those facing food insecurity through the World Food Programme\n\nThe funding, provided by the EU’s Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) will be used to reach families worst affected by the impacts of rising climate shocks, food prices and the prolonged effects of COVID-19 in the capital Maseru and Qacha’s Nek districts; including families badly affected by recent windstorms in Sehlaba-Thebe, Qacha`s Nek. Each household will receive the equivalent of € 54 in cash, per month, allowing them to buy food items from local markets. “The EU continues to support partners such as WFP in order to provide life-saving food assistance to the most vulnerable people suffering the effects of climate shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic” said Ms. Paola Amadei, EU Ambassador to Lesotho. “We are aware that people in urban and peri-urban areas who lost their jobs or businesses have been hit hard by climate shocks, and we want to contribute to alleviating their suffering as a consequence of the pandemic.\" The support from the EU comes at a crucial time, when hunger is peaking with over 470,000 of the population experiencing acute levels of food insecurity through March 2022. Food prices have increased, and households are still feeling the long-term impacts of COVID-19 control measures on their livelihoods such as loss of jobs and severe reduction in remittances, with many migrant workers returning to Lesotho after losing their jobs. “We thank the European Union for continuing their support, allowing WFP and the government to provide much-needed assistance to vulnerable people affected by COVID-19 and climate shocks”, said Ms. Aurore Rusiga, WFP Country Director and Representative in Lesotho. “This timely contribution will help WFP save lives by supporting those who are most at risk and change lives by improving the food security and nutrition of targeted people.” WFP will undertake Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) initiatives during cash distributions to provide information on basic hygiene for the prevention of COVID-19, as well as information on nutritional practices to enhance purchasing choices for households to meet their nutritional needs. The European Union is one of WFP’s main donors in Lesotho. The latest contribution brings the total contributions to € 7 million in the last five years.\n\n1 of 5"
