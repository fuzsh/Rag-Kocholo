        "text": "Who we are\n\nUNDP Lesotho works in the Kingdom of Lesotho helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help Lesotho to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.\n\nWhat we do\n\nUNDP in Lesotho supports Basotho to build resilience at every level to help achieve long-term Sustainable Development Goals. We provide assistance in the following focus areas: poverty reduction; promotion of transparent, accountable and effective governance at all levels; and managing environmental changes by adopting an integrated approach to sustainable management of natural resources. Our collaboration and support to the Government and people of Lesotho is governed by the Country Programme Document 2019 -2023; Lesotho United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF 2019 – 2023) based on the priority needs of the country expressed in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDPII 2018/19 – 2022/23.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish?\n\nWe are committed to building on and sharing experiences with our wide range of partners, to maximize the impact of development initiatives of the Government of Lesotho and other partners. Our work in Lesotho is in three focus areas:\n\nAcceleration of Economic Growth - The aim is to support the economy to be more resilient to external shocks and volatility through generation of inclusive employment. UNDP aims to facilitate private sector development and engagement with focus on growing medium-sized, small and micro enterprises based on access to technical and vocational skills as well as targeted financial products from micro finance institutions.\n\nSound Environmental Management for Sustainable Development - UNDP assistance emphasizes three inter-locking issues that will enable adaptation to climate change and increase resilience – a low-carbon economy, conservation of natural resources to secure livelihoods and production, and better management of risks related to natural disasters.\n\nGood Governance and Accountable Institutions – The aim is to boost institutional leadership, performance and accountability, citizen participation and mechanisms for maintaining social peace, targeting core democratic institutions such as the Independent Electoral Commission, Officer of the Ombudsman, Parliament, Human Rights Unit and Ministries critical to policy and institutional reform. The key principles of implementing UNDP Programmes are to ensure national ownership and leadership, build long-term capacities and collaborative approaches.\n\nWhat are our results?\n\nWe strive to document the achievements made by the Government of Lesotho and the strides the country is making in the fight against poverty, accelerating economic growth, safeguarding the environment, and strengthening democratic governance. Our accomplishments are reflected in efficient delivery of development results for the betterment of Basotho.\n\nOur Leadership\n\nResident Representative - UNDP Lesotho\n\nDr. Jacqueline Olweya - UNDP Resident Representative\n\nDr. Jacqueline Saline Olweya holds a Doctor of Philosophy Degree (Ph.D.) in Economics and Planning of Education from Kenyatta University, Kenya, and a Master of Philosophy Degree in the same discipline from Moi University, Kenya.
