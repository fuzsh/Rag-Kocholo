        "text": "The Kingdom of Lesotho literally translates to, \"the people who speak Sesotho\". Found landlocked in the middle of South Africa, it is the southernmost landlocked country in the world. Lesotho is also the southern most country in Africa to have its own ski resort. The country itself is at a minimum 1,400 metres above sea level, making its lowest point, the highest lowest point of any country in the world. Because of this is climate is a lot colder than that of other areas on the same latitude. Nearly 40% of people from Lesotho live under the poverty line, thei mean that 40% of Lesotho population live on less than US$1.25."
