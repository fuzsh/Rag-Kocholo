For an explanation on the share that is requested from each Member State towards the Environment Fund budget, please see below.\n\nWhat is each Member State's share of the Environment Fund budget?\n\nThe share that each member state is encouraged to contribute to the Environment Fund is represented by the Voluntary Indicative Scale of Contributions (VISC). This means that each contribution is determined using a tool that was agreed appropriate by the Member States themselves. Applying this tool means that it doesn’t matter if a country is high-income, low-income, or in-between – because each Member State is asked to contribute according to their capacity. Read more in the VISC Infographic and in the Environment Fund Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nEach contribution matters – for people and planet"
