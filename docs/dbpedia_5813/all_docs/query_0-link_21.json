        "text": "The list of fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) is released annually by the World Bank Group (WBG) and aims to inform strategic and operational decision-making within the WBG.\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe list functions primarily as a tool to help the WBG adapt its approaches, policies, and instruments in difficult and complex environments. The WBG also uses it for monitoring and accountability around its support for the most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\nSCOPE\n\nGiven the complexity of fragility and conflict, the list is not meant to be comprehensive— it does not include all countries affected, nor is it a ranking of countries.\n\nSOURCES/METHODOLOGY\n\nThe list is based on publicly available global indicators* followed by an internal review; and is updated every year on July 1st to reflect changes in country situations.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nThe list distinguishes between countries based on the nature of issues they face. The classification uses the following categories:\n\nCountries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions, and manifestations of fragility.\n\nCountries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population.\n\nFY25 FCS List\n\nClassification of Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations\n\nHistorical Overview: The WBG’s Classification of FCS since 2006\n\nFCS Lists from FY06 to FY24\n\nLast Updated: Jun 28, 2024"
