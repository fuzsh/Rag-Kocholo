        "text": "Key Findings 100 of 194 countries have published what they perceive as CI sectors. The CI sectors that countries most frequently mention are ­energy (96%), information and communications technology (ICT) (95%), transport (93%), economy and finance (89%), public services (84%), and health (83%). By far the least-mentioned categories worldwide are research and ­education (15%), national security (45%), food (51%), and water (76%). If it were only a numbers game, the most common CI could be ­included in a global definition. A more inclusive approach would name all the above sectors as CI at the UN. Many countries need further support in defining CI (see Appendix C). While almost all countries in Europe and North America define CI sectors, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania are far behind.\n\nThe online version of this Policy Brief doesn't contain footnotes.

In fact, there are at least 100 different national positions on the subject. Many countries lack lists of their CI or critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors, including two in Europe (Monaco and San Marino). Because 94 countries have still not defined their CI, the 2023 annual progress report of the Open-Ended Working Group on information and communication technologies (OEWG II) notes that “[s]tates also proposed to support developing countries and small States, in their identification of national CI and CII, where requested.”\n\nIt is crucial to establish a common global denominator as to what is or is not CI. States are bound under international law not to attack CI (in and outside cyberspace) and have also agreed on a voluntary, non-binding norm on refraining from malicious information and communications technology (ICT) activity against CI in cyberspace during peacetime. Thus, knowing what other states perceive as CI is important to reduce the likelihood of misperception and escalation. So how can countries agree on a global denominator?\n\nWhile all CI is off-limits for both cyber- and conventional attacks in peacetime according to international law, CI in cyberspace needs additional protection. In a previous paper, one author argued that specific CI sectors (electrical grid, early warning satellites, and nuclear command and control systems) need to be protected from all cyber operations. This means that not only attacks should be banned, but also espionage and the placement of logic bombs – malicious code in software triggered by certain conditions. These special protections are needed because those three sectors are the most important CI of all. Cyber operations against such entities could lead to disastrous misperceptions, i.e., countries (mis)perceiving that other countries are preparing for war.\n\nThis paper takes a complementary and broader approach to the previous paper, which focused exclusively on the cyber context and on deepening the UN norm on not attacking critical infrastructure. In contrast, this paper creates a global database with countries’ different definitions of sectors they perceive as CI. While not all countries have an official document laying out their CI sectors, 100 countries do. This allows us to analyze which sectors appear quite often and which do not. It also permits us to compare which sectors are perceived as CI in various regions of the world and, finally, to find similarities across countries.\n\nWhile this paper does speak to the cyber ­diplomacy community, which aims to protect CI from cyberattacks, it is not limited to this community. Having a global and common definition of CI is valuable for policy makers outside the cyber field, since the offline and online worlds have merged in recent years. There is no CI sector that is not connected in one way or another to the internet. The protection of CI from both cyber and conventional attacks must be tackled together. There has not yet been a serious attempt at UN cyber negotiations to agree on a comprehensive definition of CI. Current definitions at the UN OEWG on international cybersecurity have been quite arbitrary and have changed over time. They have also not striven to be comprehensive. So no process is in place yet that would try to assemble countries’ definitions of CI sectors. This may be because some countries fear that anything that falls outside their CI definition could become a target for cyber operations.\n\nHowever, this is misguided. This paper does not suggest that the Bahamas, Bolivia, or Madagascar should publish detailed lists of where critical water supply networks or industry facilities lie. This paper rather aims to nudge countries toward publicly naming broad lists of CI sectors that would be abstract and would not provide concrete targets.\n\nFurthermore, countries publicly listing their CI sectors have not been more frequently attacked than those that have not yet defined CI. To the contrary, countries that have codified CI sectors have been better at establishing measures to protect CI. The ­European Union’s NIS and NIS2 directives are examples of such regulations that improve CI protection. Without a definition of CI, protection is not possible.\n\nPast and current UN processes usually aim to find consensus on a certain topic by encouraging countries to submit their national views – e.g., on international law or progress in securing CI – to a UN platform or to voice them when diplomats gather for substantial sessions of UN working groups. In this vein, it took more than a decade to define a norm calling for countries to refrain from attacking CI via cyber means. This paper aims to speed up the process of arriving at a global and common understanding of critical infrastructure.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe study examines the CI sectors of 193 United ­Nations member states and Taiwan. These states are regionally categorized in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the United Nations Statistics Division.\n\nThe worldwide categorization of CI is based on extensive research. The authors analyzed official documents, including national security strategies, laws and ministry websites. The study draws exclusively on open-source data. Despite the considerable research effort, country classifications may have been overlooked or published after the authors concluded their evidence-gathering in November 2023. It is the authors’ aim to add missing data in future iterations of the dataset.\n\nThere is a lack of standardized terminology in designating CI and the sectors that fall into it. While the term critical infrastructure is commonly used, countries also use variations, such as “activities of vital importance” in France or “crucially important facilities” in Belarus. And there is a diverse spectrum of classifications for CI sectors such as public services, based on how individual countries define them. This encompasses everything from emergency services to administration, waste disposal, government, cultural heritage, and tourism. Other CI sectors are more straightforward. Energy and ICT are relatively easy to classify due to the extensive overlap of terminology in the countries examined.\n\nWhile compiling the dataset, the authors conducted a thorough analysis to identify the most frequently recurring categories of CI. They identified ten categories: energy, ICT, transport, health, food, water, public services, economy and finance, research and education, and national security.\n\nAdditionally, the authors listed some sectors several times. For example, Poland lists “health transport rescue” as a sector. They classified this both as transport and health. Another example is food and water, which appears in both food and water categories in this study, despite being considered a single category in some countries.\n\nWhat is more, numerous countries lack English versions of their public documents. In these cases, the translations were made by the researchers themselves or by using online translation tools.\n\nWhile this dataset is the first to provide an up-to-date and global overview, other repositories have been useful in this research. Those are the UNIDIR Cyber Policy Portal, which provides documents including cybersecurity policies and legal frameworks, and the OECD, which presents a list of member countries and their CI sectors.\n\nFindings\n\nThe Number of Countries Defining CI Varies Greatly by Region\n\nMore than half of the countries worldwide have an official list that defines national CI sectors. However, a closer look shows that the way CI sectors are described varies among regions. In Europe, 95% (42/44) of the countries studied have an established list. In North America, which includes Canada and the United States, 100% have such a list, while only 42% (14/33) of those in Latin America and the Caribbean do. Asia comes in at 49% (23/47) and Oceania at 29% (4/14). The region where the fewest countries have a list of definitions is Africa, with 28% (15/54).\n\nSeveral African countries have not yet defined their specific critical sectors and are aiming to do so in the coming years. Often these aims are part of the ­effort to draft and implement a national cybersecurity ­strategy. Mauritania is one such example.\n\nGlobal Alignment of Sectors\n\nAmong the countries with specified sectors, the category incorporated by nearly all is energy (96%). This is followed by ICT (95%) and transport (93%), while economy and finance, public services, and health also scored above 80%.\n\nIn Europe, all 42 countries listed energy as a critical sector. In Africa, among the fifteen countries that define CI sectors, all include ICT. For Asia, this was the case with energy and economy and finance. In Asia, Jordan did not include a public services sector. ICT and transport were left out by Qatar.\n\nCompared to other regions, Latin America stands out as the only place worldwide where energy holds the third position. As mentioned above, in all other regions, energy consistently occupies the top spot or shares it with another critical sector.\n\nFor this study, North America is comprised of only two countries. It is therefore a special case, as both the US and Canada cover 9 sectors, therefore a top three cannot be given. The only sector not considered critical by the US and Canada is research and education. It should be noted that the US does incorporate this category as a sub-sector, but this was not included in the overall analysis.\n\nThe least-mentioned category in all regions is research and education, named by only 15% of all countries. On the African continent, 27% of the countries included this category. This is significantly higher than Europe (12%) and Asia (13%). Other categories that scored low globally are national security (45%), food (51%), and water (76%).\n\nRegional Specificity:\n\nAsia: Globally, 51% of countries include food as a category in their CI lists. In Asia, however, out of the twenty-three countries with CI sectors, only five (22%) feature this category. Those are: Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAfrica: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria were the only African countries to list research and education as a category of CI.\n\nEurope: Russia includes “Russian legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who own information systems” and “Russian legal entities and/or individual entrepreneurs that ensure the interaction of these systems and networks” as critical sectors.\n\nNorth America: The United States lists the defense industrial base as critical, including overseas entities.\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean: Environmental elements are seen as essential components of critical infrastructure. Globally, this CI is mentioned only by very few countries. In the case of Brazil, a focus on biosafety and bioprotection stands out, reflecting a commitment to safeguarding biological resources. Likewise, Ecuador places significant importance on the preservation of its rich biodiversity and genetic patrimony.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe aim of this article was to shed light on what countries view as CI sectors. There are several main conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis.\n\nFirst, many countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, are still working on the categorization of their CI sectors (see Appendix C). While this trend shows a growing awareness of the importance of safeguarding vital systems, it also reflects that 94 countries still have not defined their CI sectors nor have response plans to protect them. It is the international community’s task to support those member states in defining and protecting their CI.\n\nSecond, the efforts of countries that have already defined their CI sectors can help foster a common global alignment. While each nation may have specific needs, the pursuit of a common global understanding of CI could result in significant benefits. Such an approach could lead to improved international cooperation, information sharing, and the development of best practices for protecting CI on a global scale.\n\nThis policy brief answered the “what” questions of CI: what countries define CI and what those definitions look like. This is especially useful to gain an understanding of what countries mean by broad terms such as ICT. Some countries say it is submarine ­cables, others satellite communication; for Russia it is ­Russian legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who own information systems; for others it is broadcast media or the digital economy. The variety of definitions captured in this paper is even broader when it comes to public services, encompassing everything from ­s­ensitive ­organizations to urban areas, national monuments and values. A key goal in writing this paper was to go beyond assumptions as to what CI is and to provide facts. Countries can use the global overview to add CI sectors they have omitted, but which other countries have on their lists, and exchange information with them as to how to best protect those sectors.\n\nBut there is more to studying CI than compiling what countries perceive as CI. There are many more “why and how” questions for future research. Why do countries publish CI lists at a certain point in time? Is it because they have been attacked recently and need to double down on CI protection? Australia, for instance, added telecommunications companies to its existing list of CI in 2023. This was a direct reaction to a large hack telecommunications companies in Australia suffered in 2022. Adding telecommunications companies to the list of CIs not only puts ink on paper, it also creates new rules with stricter security procedures for this CI sector, which will be enforced by the ­Australian government.\n\nWhy some countries and not others? While the ­authors chose not to study those that have not codified CI, one explanation for the lack of codification may be that many countries simply do not have the resources to establish CI regulation. It might also be that certain regional organizations have not been nudging countries in this direction, as for example the EU has done. Another question for future research is, for example, why certain countries include national security in their strategies and why others omit food or water.\n\nMany of these questions may be answered by further research. But alongside in-depth analyses by researchers, states themselves should also establish their own initiatives. Those that have published their lists of CI sectors should push for global standards regarding CI definitions and CI protection. As they have already set standards by publishing lists, they have a first mover advantage and could decisively shape global discussions on this issue.\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix A:\n\nAppendix B:\n\nDesignations Given to CI by Countries and Our Categorization of Them\n\n1.
