        "text": "B. Evaluating Lesotho’s Export Performance\n\n2. Lesotho’s growth in recent decades has relied on trade in few key export sectors. While the country has limited natural resources, several are of considerable economic value— diamonds, cotton, wool, and water—and have become key export commodities. However, Lesotho’s exports are dominated by the apparel sector (Figure 2), which accounts for about 10 percent of GDP. Compared to 2010, Lesotho's export basket did not change much, with apparel remaining the leading sector, accounting for over 40 percent of the total in 2019, followed closely by diamonds (just under 40 percent in 2019, compared to 26 percent in 2010).\n\nApparel. The largely foreign-owned textiles sector grew in the 1990s and early 2000s in large part due to the combination of cheap labor and the enactment in 2000 of the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) that attracted Taiwanese and Chinese investors to set up apparel factories in the country. Under AGOA, Lesotho has been highly successful in exporting apparel to the U.S. by utilizing the favorable rules of origin and duty-free and quota-free market access. Almost all of Lesotho’s exports to the U.S. (around 80–90 percent) take place in the apparel categories falling under Harmonized System (HS) Chapters 61 and 62 (70 percent of total apparel exports) (Figure 3). Moreover, the U.S. continues to remain a top destination market, with its share hovering around 30–40 percent in the past decade. Since then, the combined textile, apparel and footwear manufacturing industry has grown to become the Lesotho’s largest formal private sector employer with estimates in the range of 45,000 (mostly female) workers.\n\nDiamonds. After a difficult year when COVID-19 restrictions decimated consumer markets, paralyzed supply chains, and led to the closure of mines, the diamond mining sector has bounced back strongly in 2021, supported by higher diamond prices driven by supply shortages, increased consumer demand, and the recent war in Ukraine. Following closures in 2020, three mines have reopened and are currently operational: Gem Diamond’s Letšeng, Lucapa Diamond’s Mothae, and Namakwa’s Kao. Despite the challenges presented by travel restrictions, supply chain constraints, extreme weather conditions and recurrent power outages, the Letšeng mine recovered 14 percent more carats in 2021 (115,335, compared to 100,780 in 2020), with the average price at $1,835 per carat, which was 4 percent lower than in 2020, mainly due to fewer large and exceptional diamond recoveries. The Mothae mine has expanded its processing capacity by 45 percent in 2021, and continued its cutting and polishing partnership, which promises to move the sector up the diamond value chain. After over a year of inactivity, Firestone Diamonds’ Liqhobong mine was expected to restart its operations in the second half of 2021 but remains inactive due to ongoing debt restructuring negotiations. Two locally owned mines, Thaba-Telle and Qaqa, have been awarded diamond mining leases, but are not yet operational.\n\nWater. Lesotho is a net exporter of water. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), established through a bilateral treaty in 1986, comprises a system of dams and tunnels throughout Lesotho to deliver water to South Africa’s Gauteng region. The project transfers about 900 million cubic meters of water annually and generates 72-megawatt (MW) hydropower at the Muela Power Station. Annual royalties from water transfers have averaged LSL950 million over the last five fiscal years, or 2.8 percent of GDP. While the revenue potential is significant, ongoing delays—exacerbated most recently by the pandemic and adverse weather—continue to beset Phase II of the project.\n\n3. Textiles, clothing, and footwear exports were hit hard by the pandemic. Of the key export sectors, textiles, clothing, and footwear have contributed the most to growth over 2015–19. The containment measures imposed at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic (i) disrupted supply chains leading to limited availability of inputs; (ii) resulted in a decline in global demand for apparel, and (iii) caused labor shortages, all of which negatively impacted the sector. As a result, apparel exports declined from $485 million in 2018 to $385 million in 2020 (Figure 4).\n\n4. Lesotho is at risk of losing out to competitors in the apparel sector, both regional and global. The preferential access afforded by AGOA, coupled with a relatively low monthly wage of about $150, helped Lesotho remain moderately competitive in the past (Figure 5). In sub-Saharan Africa, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, and Mauritius also have large export-oriented apparel sectors, while global textile giants outside of China like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore also pose a challenge. However, the recent 14 percent minimum wage hike in the textile sector and the anticipated expiration of AGOA in 2025 are expected to erode Lesotho’s competitiveness in the global apparel industry.\n\n5. Historically, AGOA suspensions haves had a significant negative impact on the apparel exports of affected countries.3 For instance, Eswatini, another SACU member, with predominantly apparel exports to the US, was removed from the AGOA in January 2015. Pre-suspension, in 2014, Eswatini claimed AGOA benefits for $59 million of its exports to the US of which $57 million were apparel products (one-third of the country’s apparel exports). Eswatini’s apparel exports to the US dropped to $2.7 and $1 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and never recovered despite its redesignation as an AGOA beneficiary by end-2017. It takes three or more years for the lost exports to recover as countries divert exports to other existing destination markets. In case of Eswatini, apparel exports were entirely diverted to South Africa (Figure 6). Similarly, in case of Madagascar, they were predominantly diverted to EU, with the US regaining its market share after the AGOA benefits were reinstated. More recently, anecdotal evidence from Ethiopia, another apparel manufacturing hub benefitting from AGOA, suggests that the suspension of AGOA benefits has led to apparel manufacturers closing shops and moving elsewhere. The US tariff rates on apparel are quite high, ranging from 15 to 32 percent. Hence, the estimated tariff savings from AGOA are sizable—over $70 million (Table 1). The anticipated loss of preferential access will increase the pressure on the apparel sector in an increasingly competitive global market.\n\n6. While Lesotho’s export- and import-product concentrations are broadly comparable with the average for other SACU members, export- and import-market concentrations are the highest among SACU members. Lesotho exports about 700 products (out of the approximately 5,300 products), based on the HS6 classification, down from about 960 in 2010, significantly lower than SACU average of 2,500 products (Figure 7). Nevertheless, the export-product concentration index is comparable with the average for other SACU members, excluding Botswana. Imports are more diversified; the number of imported goods is much larger—about 3,000—and has been broadly stable, except for a dip in 2018. In terms of trading partners, Lesotho’s both exports and imports are highly concentrated—about 30-40 markets or source countries—significantly lower than the SACU average of 80, excluding South Africa. Over 85 percent of Lesotho’s imports come from South Africa."
