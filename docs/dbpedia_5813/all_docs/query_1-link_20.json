        "text": "The Kingdom of Lesotho, formerly known as Basutoland, gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. For the first two decades of the nations existence The Basuto National party was in power, until 1990 when King Moshoeshoe was exiled. In 1993 the Kingdom of Lesotho returned to a constitutional government after a seven-year period of military rule. In 1992 King Moshoeshoe returned to Lesotho and worked to regain power in 1995, he was then succeeded by his son King Letsie III in 1996. In 1998 protests broke out among civilians and the military following a disputed election necessitating intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the South African Development Community. After these incidents some constitutional reforms were reinstated and restored temporary stability. In May of 2012 elections for Prime Minister occurred, Minister Motsoahae Thomas Thabane replaced a 14-year incumbent in a peaceful transfer of power."
