        "text": "What Is the Third World?\n\nCertain nations were categorized as Third World countries in the last half of the 20th century. This is now considered an outdated and derogatory phrase used to describe nations that were economically underdeveloped and had little or no affiliation with major world powers.\n\nThe Third World countries occupied one of four segments that identified nations by their relative economic standing. Roughly, the major world powers and their economic and political allies were First World countries, allies of the Soviet Union were Second World countries, underdeveloped nations were Third World countries, and nations that were entirely isolated from global politics and economics were the Fourth World.\n\nToday, the preferred terminology categorizes a nation as a developing country, an underdeveloped country, or a low- and middle-income country (LMIC).\n\nDefining Developing Nations\n\nClassifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept that was created soon after the end of World War II in 1945 and used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nNations are often characterized by their economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, lack of sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.\n\nDeveloping nations are closely watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which provide grants and loans that help struggling nations improve their infrastructure and economic systems.\n\nBoth organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.\n\nDeveloping nations, or LMICs, are of particular interest to investors seeking to identify growth opportunities. Both their risks and their returns are relatively high. Developing countries are generally characterized as economic underperformers, but innovation and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.\n\nHistory of Developing Nations Classifications\n\nThe classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during the Cold War. First-world countries were known as highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and capitalism.\n\nSecond-world countries had communist systems and most were allied with the Soviet Union. These included the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe and some Asia nations.\n\nThird-world countries included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive.\n\nAlfred Sauvy Coined the Term\n\nAlfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy observed a group of countries, many of them former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism.\n\n\"Three worlds, one planet,\" wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in L'Observateur.\n\nDividing the World\n\nMost nations today fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The former world segmentations have been fit into these categories for the most part.\n\nThe developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economic indicators.\n\nFrontier Markets List\n\nMSCIâ€™s Frontier Markets Index can serve as a list of developing countries. The index includes the following countries:\n\nCroatia\n\nEstonia\n\nIceland\n\nLithuania\n\nKazakhstan\n\nRomania\n\nSerbia\n\nSlovenia\n\nKenya\n\nMauritius\n\nMorocco\n\nNigeria\n\nTunisia\n\nWAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union)\n\nBahrain\n\nJordan\n\nOman\n\nBangladesh\n\nPakistan\n\nSri Lanka\n\nVietnam\n\nOther Definitions of Developing Nations\n\nThe World Trade Organization provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though their statuses can be contested by other nations.\n\nEach WTO segregation comes with certain opportunities for the nations. WTO projects are designed to increase trading opportunities and improve infrastructure.\n\nThe Least Developed Countries List\n\nAs an offshoot of the WTO, the Human Development Index (HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on education, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the United Nations use Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators. This list is reassessed every few years.\n\nThe indicators are a combination of gross national income, human assets (nutrition, life expectancy, secondary school education, adult literacy), and economic vulnerability (population size, remoteness, merchandise export concentration, agriculture, exports, and natural disaster preparedness).\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAngola\n\nBangladesh\n\nBenin\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nBurundi\n\nCambodia\n\nCentral African Republic\n\nChad\n\nComoros\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nDjibouti\n\nEritrea\n\nEthiopia\n\nGambia\n\nGuinea\n\nGuinea-Bissau\n\nHaiti\n\nKiribati\n\nLao People's Democratic Republic\n\nLesotho\n\nLiberia\n\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMali\n\nMauritania\n\nMozambique\n\nMyanmar\n\nNepal\n\nNiger\n\nRwanda\n\nSao Tome and Principe\n\nSenegal\n\nSierra Leone\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nSomalia\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nSudan\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTogo\n\nTuvalu\n\nUganda\n\nUnited Republic of Tanzania\n\nYemen\n\nZambia\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe term Third World was coined in a very different time. In the wake of World War II, it seemed reasonable to classify nations as capitalist powers (the First World), communist countries (the Second World), and countries that are neither (the Third World).\n\nCurrent classifications will probably seem equally outdated in 70 years. But for now, there are developed nations, developing nations, and underdeveloped nations."
