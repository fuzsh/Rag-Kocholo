        "text": "Selected Literature\n\nSupporting countries in using evidence for policymaking is an objective shared by many organizations and initiatives. Under the KIX initiative for which UNESCO IICBA manages the KIX Africa 19 Hub and collaborates with KIX Africa 21, the focus is on six themes: (i) learning assessment systems (ii) early childhood education; (iii) teaching and learning (iv) the data challenge; (v) gender equality; and (vi) equity and inclusion. For each topic, a link is provided to the GPE-KIX Discussion paper written at the start of the initiative in 2019 and additional publications that could be useful for policy. By necessity, to keep this brief short, only a few resources can be mentioned, but additional resources can be accessed through digital repositories listed below. A brief note on UNESCO IICBA research is also provided.\n\nLearning Assessment Systems [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Learning assessment tools and systems are essential to gauge and improve learning outcomes for students. A primer on large scale assessments from the World Bank provides guidance on such assessments, as does a review of learning assessments in Africa from UNESCO IIEP. Among regional assessments, PASEC (Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems) for francophone countries in West and Central Arica and SEACMEQ (Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality) for anglophone countries in East and Southern Africa are the best known. These instruments target primary schools. Other tools that focus and assess the learning outcomes of young learners include the Early Grade Reading and Mathematics Assessments (EGRA/EGMA). Supported and funded primarily by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), these assessments are administered by different agencies such as the World Bank, RTI International and others across the continent. The West African Examinations Council also provides guidance on examinations and certificate accreditation in Anglophone countries of West Africa. Also interesting is PISA for development which is being piloted in secondary schools in a few African countries.\n\nLesotho participates in the SEACMEQ program. Assessments and examinations are managed by the Examinations Council of Lesotho (ECoL). ECoL administers Grade 7 End-of-Level Assessment, Grade 11 public examinations as well as conducting the biennial Lesotho National Assessment of Education Progress in Grades 4 and 6. In June 2021, the ECoL worked with UNESCO Institute for Statistics to set global benchmarks on the 2016 National Assessment of Educational Progress Survey (NAEP) at grade 6 in English and mathematics. . In 2009, the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) published the Curriculum and Assessment Policy which promotes formative assessments, monitoring of educational progress and summative assessments.\n\nImproving Teaching and Learning [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. How teachers and students interact and engage is key to improve learning outcomes. Cost-effective approaches pr ‘smart buys’ to improve learning in low-income countries are discussed in a World Bank report. Teaching is paramount, and therefore so are teacher policies to ensure that successful teachers make for successful students. Standards for the teaching profession were proposed by Education International and UNESCO with regional standards available from the Africa Union Commission, including a framework for standards and competencies.\n\nLesotho uses a 7-3-2-4 structure. Primary school is seven years long starting from age 6 followed by three years in lower secondary school. Upper secondary school is two years followed by four years of tertiary education. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, educational outcomes in Lesotho were already low. According to 2018 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, only 45% of students aged 7 to 14 could read proficiently in English or Sesotho, and only 15% had strong math skills. Researchers from the National University of Lesotho used semi-structured interviews to explore how primary school teachers in the country were engaging with the curriculum reforms brought by the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Framework of 2009 and recommended changes to teacher education to better prepare teachers to teach and assess students. On the topic of learning and language, one study from the National University of Lesotho found that educational practices that exhibit linguistic discrimination towards those whose mother language are considered minority languages can be reasonably correlated with subpar academic performance of students. The qualitative study used focus group discussions with 246 learners and 142 teachers in 23 districts to recommend that curricula and assessment tools should incorporate the linguistic background of learners.\n\nStrengthening Early Childhood Care and Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Experiences children undergo in early childhood can affect their entire life. Nurturing care is essential. Essential interventions in early childhood include pre-primary education. Yet less than half of young children in Africa benefit from pre-primary education according to the Global Education Monitoring report 2021. The Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) is a tool by UNICEF that can be used to measure the overall well-being of children aged 2-5. It does this by assessing their development in key areas such as literacy and numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development, and learning capacity. The ECDI is made up of a series of simple tasks that are designed to be age appropriate. The Office of Research at UNICEF maintains a webpage with useful links to organizations working on child-related themes organized by subject, including early childhood.\n\nIn Lesotho, 73% of children aged 3-4 are developmentally on track according to the ECDI. On a national scale, approximately 50 percent of children between the ages of 3 and 4 participate in ECE. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the ECE attendance rates between children whose mothers attended higher education (89%) and children whose mothers did not attend higher education (34%). Notably, children who attend ECE are more likely to be developmentally on track than those who do not attend, by a margin of 10 percentage points, according to a 2021 MICS-EAGLE report. Basic data on early childhood development are available from a nurturing care profile\n\nAchieving Gender Equality In and Through Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. The cost of gender inequality is massive, as is the cost of not educating girls, including in Africa. When girls lack education, this affects their earnings in adulthood, the number of children they will have and their health, as well as their agency, among others. When girls are not in school, they are also at higher risk of child marriage, with again high costs for them, their children, and society. In Africa, the African Union’s International Centre for the Education of Girls and Women in Africa supports member states on girls’ education.\n\nAccording to UNICEF MICS-EAGLE findings, girls finish primary school at a higher rate (92%) than boys (69%), but the gap narrows at upper secondary level with 37% of girls completing as compared to 27% of boys suggesting factors specific to girls that impede their education. A 2022 UNICEF report on Child Marriage in Eastern and Southern Africa estimates that 1 in 6 young women were first married or in union before the age of 18. 33% of women aged 20 to 24 years who were first married or in union before age 18 had no education as compared to 1% who had at least a secondary education.\n\nData Management Systems Strengthening [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Education management information systems (EMIS) are key for management. They can also support evidence-based policymaking. In Africa, the African Union’s Institute of Education for Development supports member states on EMIS. In addition to EMIS data, other data sources including household surveys, school surveys, student assessments, and impact evaluations of pilot interventions are essential to inform policy.\n\nLesotho's previous system for collecting education data was paper based. They have since moved to an OpenEMIS system according to a joint 2020 UNESCO and Global Partnership for Education report. In Lesotho, the Bureau of Statistics of the Ministry of Development Planning releases the country’s Education Statistical Report.\n\nEquity and Inclusion/Leaving No One Behind [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Equity and inclusion are major challenges for education systems. Gender, disability, ethnicity, indigenous status, poverty, displacement, and many other factors may all lead some children to lack access to education. In Africa especially, gaps in educational outcomes between groups may be large, as illustrated in the case of disability. Equity must be at the center of education policy on the continent. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are two major international frameworks related to disability-inclusive education exist.\n\nPrimary education is cost free and mandatory. The nation was on the brink of achieving near-universal primary education prior to the onset of COVID-19, with a net enrollment rate of 85 percent in primary education and a notable level of student retention until completion of primary schooling. However, children from rural areas and the poorest two wealth quintiles are disproportionately represented among those who are not learning. The proportion of children from the poorest two-fifths of the country's wealth distribution who do not have foundational numeracy skills (47%), or foundational reading skills (54%) is significantly higher than the proportion of children from other groups. according to MICS EAGLE (2020) findings.\n\nLesotho ratified the CRC in 1992 and ratified the CRPD in 2008. The 2018 Lesotho Inclusive Education Policy was designed to ensure that all learners and learning abilities were considered in schools. UNICEF and the Lesotho National Federation of Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (LNFOD) worked together to promote the Disability Equity Act, which was enacted in March 2021. This Act lays the groundwork for implementing the Inclusive Education Policy and the National Disability Mainstreaming Strategic Plan 2021–2025. According to MICS-EAGLE findings, 8% of children aged 5 to 17 across the country have at least one functional difficulty. Children without functional difficulties have a 1% higher attendance rate at the primary level (97% vs 96%) and a 13% higher attendance rate at the lower secondary level (57% vs 44%) than their peers with functional difficulties.\n\nNote on UNESCO IICBA Research. IICBA recently launched a new program of applied research on teacher and education issues in Africa. A total of 200 publications have been completed from January to September 2023, including studies, discussion papers, training guides, reports, knowledge briefs, event summaries, and interviews. Several of those publications focus on Lesotho. All publications are available on IICBA’s website.\n\nCountry Policies\n\nInformation on Lesotho’s education system and policies is available on the website of the Ministry of Education which covers basic and higher education as well as technical education and vocational training (TVET). The Education Sector Plan (2016-2026) is the flagship policy guiding the sector.\n\nLesotho does have a teaching service commission.\n\nA few organizations aim to capture education policies on specific themes across countries, including Lesotho. UNESCO’s Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER) covering the themes of the Global Education Monitoring reports, including: inclusion in education (2020 Report), non-state actors in education (2021/22 Report), technology in education (2023 Report) and leadership in education (2024/25 Report, forthcoming). PEER also covers additional topics on key SDG 4 issues, including financing for equity, climate change communication and education, and comprehensive sexuality education.\n\nKnowledge Repositories\n\nOnly a few links to the literature on education by theme for Lesotho, Africa, and globally were provided earlier to keep the brief short, but repositories of digital resources facilitate access to the literature. A few of those repositories are listed below by alphabetical order:\n\n3ie Development Evidence Portal (DEP): DEP is a repository of rigorous evidence on what works in international development, including in the area of education.\n\nAERD: The African Education Research Database hosted by the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge collates research by African scholars on education.\n\nAfrican Development Bank: The Bank has publications that cover a range of topics, including education. It also hosts ADEA which also has selected publications.\n\nGlobal Partnership for Education: GPE is one of the largest funders for education in Africa. It collaborates with Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to build and mobilize evidence on education through the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE KIX), which has a Library of research outputs.\n\nJ-PAL: The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab maintains a database of impact evaluations and policy publications, quite a few of which are about education.\n\nRePEc: Research Papers in Economics is a large archive of research on economics, including the economics of education. It can be searched through IDEAS.\n\nTeacher Task Force (TTF): The TTF is collaborative across many organizations hosted by UNESCO. It maintains a Knowledge Hub with resources on teacher policies.\n\nUNESCO HQ: UNESCO is the lead agency in the UN systems on education. Its Digital Library includes UNESCO Open Access which includes most UNESCO publications.\n\nUNESCO GEM: UNESCO publishes annually a Global Education Monitoring Report on a different theme each year with associated resources and background papers.\n\nUNESCO IICBA: IICBA is a Category 1 Institute at UNESCO. It conducts research on education in Africa with several publication series and maintains a digital repository.\n\nUNICEF: Publications can be found under Reports, the Office of Global Insight and Policy, and the Office of Research. Also of interest is the Data Must Speak initiative.\n\nWorld Bank: The Open Knowledge Repository provides access to the Bank’s research. It includes a section on Africa with country pages including for Lesotho.\n\nMany organizations maintain websites that include country pages with useful information. Examples include the GPE Lesotho Country Page; World Bank Lesotho Country Page; UNESCO IIEP Country Page. Many organizations also maintain blogs on education issues, often with stories on Africa. Examples include Education for All (Global Partnership for Education), Education for Global Development (World Bank), Education Plus Development (Brookings Institutions), and World Education Blog (UNESCO). Beyond blogs focusing on education, blogs on Africa more generally may also provide useful resources. This includes Africa Can End Poverty and Nasikiliza (the World Bank’s two blogs for sub-Saharan Africa ) and Arab Voices (the Bank’s blog for the Middle East and North Africa).\n\nData\n\nIt is often useful to download data for Lesotho and other countries from multi-country databases. The largest database on development, including education data, is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). The World Bank also maintain the Education Statistics (EdStats) database. Both World Bank databases rely in part for education on data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics. UNESCO also maintains the Global Education Observatory and the World Inequality Database in Education (WIDE), as well as a wide range of other databases. Specific estimates are occasionally maintained by other agencies. For example, UNICEF provides data on out-of-school rates, adjusted net attendance rates, completion rates, foundational learning skills, information communication technology skills, youth and adult literacy rates, and school-age digital connectivity. Another useful reference is StatCompiler which provides data at various levels of aggregation from Demographic and Health Surveys across countries and over time, including Lesotho. For comparison purposes, data from the OECD for member and partner countries (including South Africa) can be useful.\n\nReferences\n\nReferences are available through the links provided in this brief.
