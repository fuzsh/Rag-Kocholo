        "text": "A recent mission, conducted by the UN Nutrition Secretariat, provided an opportunity to cultivate relations with the different members. Analytical tools, such as the Nutrition Stakeholder and Action Mapping and the UN Nutrition Inventory, provide another entry point for joint action. For example, seven UN agencies (FAO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP and WHO) plus the World Bank are participating in the UN Nutrition Inventory exercise that is currently underway. Essentially, the exercise takes stock of which UN agencies are doing what for nutrition to help the UNCT obtain a holistic view, using a common framework. The colleagues plan to use the findings to shape how nutrition is reflected in Lesotho’s next United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), in concert with the common country analysis (CCA) and emerging ‘how to’ guidance for mainstreaming nutrition, developed by UN Nutrition.\n\nIn the meantime, the Inventory exercise has helped UN colleagues better understand the respective roles that the UN agencies play in nutrition. Lethola Mafisa, Community Support Adviser, at UNAIDS in Maseru explains that, “within the Joint UN Team on HIV and AIDS (JUNTA), we support and advocate for nutrition for people living with HIV, who are on treatment.” The UN Nutrition Inventory provided a platform to sensitize other UN colleagues about this aspect of JUNTA’s work, including its contributions to national nutrition guidelines to address the needs of people living with HIV. The exercise is also raising awareness among colleagues at UNFPA about how teenage pregnancy and narrow birth intervals are linked to stunting.\n\nThe analytical tools are likewise helping to identify gaps and overlaps with a view to further increasing the coherence and convergence of UN Nutrition support. The ongoing Inventory has triggered discussions about how UNFPA’s outreach to women, including adolescent girls, could be leveraged to help address the nutritional vulnerabilities of these groups. For example, how can UNFPA programmes be best complemented with technical guidance and assistance provided by other UN agencies such as FAO, UNICEF, WFP and WHO in areas like breastfeeding and dietary counseling?"
