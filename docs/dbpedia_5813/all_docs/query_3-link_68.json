There are a few ways to accomplish this. If this is a short-term project, you might filter features with a definition query or make a selection layer. However, for this project, you want to create copies of the data that you can edit without affecting the original data, so you will select the data you need and extract it to a new layer.\n\nThere are many options for defining a relationship between two layers. You could choose Within, since you want to select all the areas that are within the South Africa province polygons. However, there are several urban areas that cross provincial borders. These areas would not be selected by the Within relationship. They will be selected by the Intersect relationship.\n\nYou can read about each relations type at Select By Location graphic examples.\n\nThe urban areas within South Africa are selected.\n\nZoom and pan around the map to ensure that all of the urban areas within South Africa are selected and none of the ones outside are selected. It can be difficult to choose the correct relationship type in the Select By Location tool. A visual inspection is usually needed, and you may need to try a few relationship types before you find the best one for your situation.\n\nIn this case, one urban area outside of South Africa is selected: Maseru is the capital and largest city of Lesotho. It is selected because its edge coincides with the national border.\n\nInstead of reconfiguring the Select by Location parameters, you'll remove this one feature from your selection set."
