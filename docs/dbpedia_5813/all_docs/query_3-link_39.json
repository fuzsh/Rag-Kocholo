        "text": "The World Bank Group Country Opinion Survey Program systematically measures and tracks the perceptions of the World Bank's clients, partners, and other stakeholders across the globe in client countries. The Public Opinion Research Group surveyed 29 countries in FY2012 (July 2011-June 2012), 41 countries in FY2013 (July 2012-June 2013), 42 countries in FY2014 (July 2013-June 2014), 35 countries in FY2015 (July 2014-June 2015), 45 countries in FY2016 (July 2015-June 2016), and 35 countries in FY2017 (July 2016-June 2017). In FY2018, surveys were conducted in 39 countries. Nearly all of the World Bank Group's client countries are surveyed in every three year cycle.\n\nFrom March to May 2018, 342 stakeholders of the WBG in Lesotho were invited to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/ contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/ private banks; NGOs and community-based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations.\n\nThe results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey conducted in FY’14 (response rate was 75%, N=106). Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in both years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (Report, page 86) in the Related Materials."
