        "text": "Maseru, Lesotho – From June 24 to 27, 2024, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in collaboration with the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa and the Lesotho Directorate of Corruption and Economic Offences (DCEO), hosted two critical workshops aimed at bolstering the capabilities of financial crime investigators and prosecutors. These workshops were held by virtue of Lesotho’s membership in the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network of Southern Africa (ARINSA). Participants from various institutions, including the Lesotho Mounted Police, Lesotho Directorate on Corruption and Economic Offences, Botswana Police, Botswana Unified Revenue Services, Botswana Directorate of Public Prosecutions, Lesotho Directorate of Public Prosecutions, and Lesotho Financial Intelligence Unit, attended the workshops.\n\nThe two workshops, held within the context of the Investigator Placement Programme (IPP) and the Prosecutor Placement Programme (PPP), focused on providing specialized training to enhance skills in combating financial crimes and assets.\n\nSpeaking during the opening ceremony, Advocate Knorx Mollele, Director General of the DCEO, expressed gratitude to ARINSA and UNODC for organizing the workshops in a short period. He remarked, \"These workshops reflect the much-needed collaboration among agencies, countries, and nations. We all know the severe impact of corruption and transnational organized crime on our State's ability to render essential services to our communities, especially the vulnerable, including women and children who might not have the financial means to secure those services on their own.\"\n\nHe added, \"Lesotho, as a signatory of the UN Convention against Corruption[1] and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime[2], is indeed enjoined to implement a wide range of measures to prevent and combat corruption. The United Nations Convention against Corruption, among other conventions, calls for the capacitation of law enforcement and oversight bodies to ensure that necessary steps are taken to fight and prevent corruption. It is crucial to recognize that perhaps corruption cannot be won or fought by us alone.\""
