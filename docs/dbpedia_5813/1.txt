Lesotho has been a member of the ILO since 1971, and has demonstrated its commitment to labour standards by ratifying 26 Conventions, including all 10 of the ILO's Fundamental Conventions. Today, the ILO provides technical and financial support to the country to promote decent work, enhance worker's rights, and improve social protection systems. These efforts aim to support the countryâ€™s strides towards aligning national employment policies with international standards and in fostering an environment that upholds the rights and welfare of all workers. ILO activities in Lesotho are managed by the Country Office for South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini, based in Pretoria.
