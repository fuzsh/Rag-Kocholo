"Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran" is currently drawing crowds on both sides of the Atlantic, making a shining debut in Germany and hitting the million admissions mark in the USA.

Launched in Germany March 25 by the distributor Falcom Media, "Monsieur Ibrahim" is sitting pretty in 10th position in the weekly charts, reaping the benefit of its 73-screen release. In just 5 days, the film by François Dupeyron registered 56,000 admissions for €344,000, boasting the best per-screen average at the German box office. Its distributor has already announced a score of between 300,000 and 500,000 admissions, a spectacular result for a French film in Germany.

By coincidence, this film featuring a philosophical grocer played by Omar Sharif is also riding high on the other side of the Atlantic, taking $1 million at the US box office. The film has proved a winner for its distributor Sony Classics, who incidentally is coupling this release with another new French hit (see story on "Bon Voyage").

A veritable international star, "Monsieur Ibrahim" currently registers 600,000 admissions outside France, representing close to €3.5 million in receipts.

"Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran" by François Dupeyron was produced by ARP Diffusion (Laurent Pétin & Michèle Halberstadt). International sales are handled by ARP.
