        "text": "Location: The Polk Museum of Art, 800 E. Palmetto St. in Lakeland. (863) 688-7743.\n\nWhen: 2 p.m. Saturday.\n\nRun Time: 95 minutes.\n\nRating: R (For sexuality).\n\n'Monsieur Ibrahim' at Polk Museum of Art\n\nOn the Rue Bleue in a working-class Jewish neighborhood in Paris, people know each other and each other's business, and live and let live. That includes the streetwalkers who are a source of fascination to young Momo, who studies them from the window of his flat before preparing supper for his father. Momo's mother is dead, an older brother has left the scene, and his father is distant and cold with the young teenager. But his life is not lonely; there is Monsieur Ibrahim, who runs the shop across the street. And there is Sylvie, who provides Momo with his sexual initiation after the lad breaks open his piggy bank.\n\nMomo (Pierre Boulanger) finds inspiration in store owner Monsieur Ibrahim (Omar Sharif). The old man sees that the young one needs a friend and guidance, and he provides both, often quoting from his beloved Koran. He knows things about Momo's family that Momo does not know, and is discreet about Momo's friendship with the hookers. What Ibrahim dreams about is to return someday to the villages and mountains of his native land, to the bazaars and dervishes and the familiar smells of the food he grew up with. What Momo desires is a break from a home life that is barren and crushes his spirit.\n\nThe movie was directed by Francois Dupeyron, based on a book and play by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt. Its best scenes come as the characters are established and get to know one another. Sharif at 71 still has the fire in his eyes that we remember from \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" and is still a handsome presence, but he settles comfortably into Monsieur Ibrahim's shabby life and doesn't bore us with his philosophy. And young Boulanger, like Jean-Pierre Leaud all those years ago, has a quick, open face that lets us read his heart.\n\nAlso playing this week at the Polk Museum of Art.\n\niGulliver's Travels- French Stewart takes a turn at the wheel of the Gadgetmobile as Inspector Gadget, the fearless crime fighter with accessories galore. Joining the Inspector in his defense of Riverton, \"The Safest City in America,\" is loyal niece Penny (Caitlin Wachs) and G2 (Elaine Hendrix), Gadget's robotic love interest. The Claw (Tony Martin) is ever present as Gadget's scheming archnemesis. 10:30 a.m. Saturday - Rated PG\n\niSaalam Bombay- This first fiction film from Mira Nair (director of Monsoon Wedding, and Kama Sutra) won her the new director's award at Cannes in 1988. The wrenching story concerns a 10-year-old boy who's tossed out onto the streets of Bombay to find work. As he tries to earn enough money to return home, he finds it's hard enough just trying to stay alive in this lawless world. Nair hired many Bombay street kids for the film, and some scenes were filmed in an actual Hindi brothel. In Hindi. 2 p.m. Sunday- No Rating.\n\niMyra Breckinridge -\n\nGore Vidal's controversial, taboo-shattering, razor-sharp satirical novel became a movie many people didn't think was possible to film. Myron Breckinridge (film critic Rex Reed) travels to Europe to undergo a sex change and comes back to America as the sexy, man-hating Myra (Raquel Welch). Look fast for Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett in small roles. Also starring Mae West in her last film role. 2 p.m. Wednesday- Rated R."
