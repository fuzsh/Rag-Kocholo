        "text": "OMAR SHARIF is not one to glorify his own past. ''Most films I made were very bad,'' he said.\n\n''About four years ago, I stopped acting,'' he continued. ''I was turning down the same rubbish I had been doing for 25 years, because I decided that I wanted to keep some dignity in my old age. It's not easy to find foreigners' parts in good films. You find them in these terrible films -- 'Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves'; 'The Thief of Baghdad' -- that sort of thing.''\n\nMr. Sharif laughed, a throaty, chuckling laugh. It was late in the afternoon and he had just descended from the suite he inhabits at the fancy Hotel Royal Monceau, near the Champs-Élysées. Drinking coffee at the bar, as he does every afternoon after a marathon soak with the newspapers in his bath upstairs, he was trying as hard as he could to convey the impression that he was a grumpy old man. ''I am getting irascible,'' he warned.\n\nAt 71, he is indeed a changed figure from the man whose magnificent entrance from the swirling mists, swathed in black robes and exuding exotic appeal, stirred so many hearts in ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' But his regal bearing has remained, along with his big gap-toothed smile and his intense, glittering eyes. His hair is gray but full and thick, and he exudes old-fashioned, courtly charisma.\n\nEven though his retirement from movies was a brief one -- his latest film, ''Monsieur Ibrahim,'' opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles -- Mr. Sharif claims to have renounced most of his favorite activities. ''What I'm trying to do now is give up all forms of passion, except if I've got good parts to act,'' he said.\n\nThat means this famous gambler no longer goes to casinos, after an incident earlier this year in which he swore at a croupier, head-butted a police officer (''in plain clothes, though he had shown me his badge,'' he said) and received a month's suspended sentence. (''I wasn't drinking, unfortunately; then I could at least have said I was drunk,'' Mr. Sharif added.) A renowned international bridge player and syndicated columnist, Mr. Sharif no longer plays competitive bridge because, he said, ''I didn't want to end up as a mediocre old bridge player.''\n\nNo more women, either. ''I'm a sentimental person and I don't go for sleeping around,'' he said. ''It never really interested me. I have done some of it, of course. Sometimes you get into a situation where you can't get out of it.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
