There are certainly analyzes articulating this relationship which problematize the socio-political issues of racism and discrimination, but these works remain predominantly English-speaking and South American, as shown in particular by those of Bell Hooks and Paulo Freire. The rarity of French translations of most essential texts questions the dynamism and openness of French research in the philosophy of education but also of a social and political philosophy which is concerned with the transmission of knowledge, the conditions of this transmission and possibilities for doing things in common. However, the richness and diversity of work initiated by critical pedagogies, liberation ethics, decolonial and feminist studies, ecopedagogy, queer and intersectional pedagogies, the philosophy of emancipation and empowerment, etc., reveal varied educational needs which it is appropriate to confront.
