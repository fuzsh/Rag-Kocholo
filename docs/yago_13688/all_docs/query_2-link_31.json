        "text": "The legendary Paris Theater is the longest-running arthouse cinema in New York City. It is also Manhattan’s only remaining single-screen cinema, and the borough’s largest movie theater, with 571 seats. Built by the French distributor Pathé as a showcase for their films and opened on September 13, 1948, the elegant theater, with its distinctive Arte Moderne style, became a premier venue for the best films from around the world. Over the years, many hits such as A Man and a Woman, Romeo and Juliet, Monsoon Wedding, Metropolitan, A Room With a View, and Belle de Jour were introduced to the United States with a theatrical run at the Paris.\n\nSince opening an engagement of Marriage Story on November 6, 2019, Netflix now operates the theater, giving new life to a landmark of New York moviegoing. As the studio’s New York flagship theater, the Paris is the home for exclusive theatrical engagements, premieres, special events, retrospectives, and filmmaker appearances, and will be programmed year round with a wide range of screenings and discussions. The Paris is New York’s movie palace, and Netflix will honor the theater’s great history while offering the finest in contemporary cinema, introducing the theater to a new generation of film lovers."
