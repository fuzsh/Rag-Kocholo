        "text": "The working-class corner of 1960s Paris that serves as the setting for the lovely Monsieur Ibrahim is teeming: Pedestrians race along narrow sidewalks, drivers slow to survey the prostitutes propped against buildings, beckoning for business.\n\nFrom a window, 13-year-old Moïse (Pierre Boulanger), also known as Momo, watches the action. A solitary kid who shares a dark, book-lined apartment with his terse, depressed father, Moïse befriends the hookers, flirts awkwardly with the girl downstairs (he throws water at her), and strikes up a relationship with the proprietor of the dingy grocery store across the way.\n\nOmar Sharif, unshaven and eyes agleam, is the Koran-reading shopkeeper Ibrahim, an old man who appears to have the ability to read Moïse's mind. Director Francois Dupeyron's compelling character study, whisked with nostalgia and wisdom, takes the friendship between the young Jewish Parisian and the elderly Muslim from Turkey and uses it to explore themes of loss, yearning, and cultural and religious tolerance and understanding.\n\nAt the same time, Monsieur Ibrahim - adapted from a book, and play, by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt - captures some of the wistful innocence of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. The film also tips its hat (or beret) to Truffaut's new-wave compatriot, Jean-Luc Godard, with a scene in which Ibrahim and Moïse's street is taken over by a film crew. Yes, that actress sure looks like Brigitte Bardot (it's actually Isabelle Adjani in a platinum wig) doing a scene from Godard's '63 classic, Contempt.\n\nTender but never sappy, Monsieur Ibrahim brings two people of vastly different age and background together in ways that are touching, and telling. It's a small, glowing gem.\n\nContact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or srea@phillynews.com.\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim\n\n*** 1/2 (out of four stars)\n\nWritten and directed by Francois Dupeyron. With Omar Sharif and Pierre Boulanger. In French with English subtitles.\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 35 mins.\n\nParent's guide: R (sex, profanity, adult themes)\n\nPlaying at: Ritz Five and Ritz Sixteen/NJ"
