        "text": "This drama about a young French soldier horrifically wounded in the first world war is a gem of a movie by any standards, and compared to recent Anglophone attempts to show the emotional history of war - the bombastic silliness of Charlotte Gray, for example - it shines like a star. François Dupeyron's movie is superbly furnished, passionately acted, and exquisitely photographed and lit.\n\nFirst shown in Cannes last year, it is here presented in a slightly truncated form without the original coda. Adrien, a sensitive young lieutenant of good family, played by Eric Caravaca, prepares to depart for the front from the festive Gare de l'Est in August 1914. He has a passionate afternoon of love with Clémence (Géraldine Pailhas), a young woman he meets at the station, and goes off to war with one of her earrings as an accidental, treasured souvenir. Almost immediately he is horribly disfigured by a German shell and spends the remaining years of the war in hospital. But when he receives a \"Dear John\" letter from Clémence, on whose name he had made a prescient play on words (\"No clemency in wartime\"), he is agonisingly unsure whether to nurse his love for her or let it metamorphose into a terrible but invigorating hate.\n\nThis is a war movie, or more accurately an anti-war movie, which spends most of the time away from the trenches. A subsidiary, spiritual war is being endured in the officers' ward - from which all mirrors have tactfully been removed - among the men with shattered faces who stumble around like lost souls in hell. \"Why aren't we dead?\" they ask each other. The 80-year-old Guy Trejan (who died last year) plays a pompous minister who enters the ward to congratulate the cringing, disfigured Adrien and asks him breezily: \"Ready to get back to the front?\" This is a richly emotional and deeply considered film. No one with an interest in the Great War should miss it."
