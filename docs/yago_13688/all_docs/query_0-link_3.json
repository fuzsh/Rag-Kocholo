        "text": "“I am happy because I know my Koran,” repeats the Parisian grocer Monsieur Ibrahim.\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim, one of two central characters in the French-language film by the same name, does not have the volatile happiness of a terrorist martyr. Neither is his happiness the smug and holier-than-thou sort that often comes with devotion to the Koran ” or the Old Testament or the New Testament or any other holy book.\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim’s brand of happiness is the kind that would ideally come with religious belief. It is a happiness that he uses, in small but meaningful ways, in the service of mankind. It is a happiness that is manifested in generosity, kindness, compassion and forgiveness. It is a happiness that is not, at the moment, generally associated with religion. Which makes the sentiments voiced in “Monsieur Ibrahim” all the more vital and uplifting to hear now.\n\n“Monsieur Ibrahim,” directed by François Dupeyron and adapted from Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’s novel (titled “Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran,” or “Mr. Ibrahim and the flowers of the Koran”), is not set in these times. Instead, it is set in the early ’60s, in a grungy Paris neighborhood. The temporal movement is significant and effective. Framed against today’s headlines of “Islam versus the world,” the story would come off as preachy, obvious and less credible.\n\n“Monsieur Ibrahim” examines the relationship between Momo, a Jewish teenager, and Mr. Ibrahim, the elderly grocer played by Omar Sharif. Momo is headed for trouble, with no mother and a father who grows more and more distant until he is finally gone. To save money to afford the prostitute Sylvie who strolls the streets outside his apartment, Momo pockets the money his father gives him and steals from the neighborhood grocery.\n\nMomo’s thievery is easily discovered by Mr. Ibrahim. But instead of getting angry, Mr. Ibrahim sees an opportunity ” for forgiveness and friendship.\n\nSharif is outstanding as the good soul with the twinkling eyes. The newcomer Pierre Boulanger, as Momo, is every bit as impressive. Toward its end, the film takes a questionable twist in weaving a road-movie element into what had been a quiet drama set almost exclusively on one block of Paris. But that ending doesn’t detract much from the simple joy, and the important message, that “Monsieur Ibrahim” has to show us.\n\n‘Veronica Guerin’\n\n“Veronica Guerin” is based on the true story of a journalist investigating the drug lords who had a tight grip on Dublin in the mid-’90s. Guerin was a reporter for the Sunday Independent who earned something of a folk-hero status for her unrelenting exposure of the crimes and criminals.\n\nIn director Joel Schumacher’s version, Cate Blanchett’s portrayal of Guerin has consistently earned higher praise than the overall film."
