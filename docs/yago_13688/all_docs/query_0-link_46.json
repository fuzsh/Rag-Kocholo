He's friends with many of the local prostitutes and loses his virginity to one of them, Sylvie (Anne Suarez). He also catches glimpses of a famous movie star (Isabelle Adjani) filming in his neighborhood. But it's his friendship with a Muslim shopkeeper, Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), that's the most rewarding part of his life. Gradually, the older man becomes a surrogate father to Momo.",
