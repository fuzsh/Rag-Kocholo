        "text": "HamptonsFilm was founded in 1992 to celebrate the art of film and to introduce a unique and varied spectrum of international films and filmmakers to our audiences.\n\nA 501(c)3 non-profit organization with year-round screenings of global narrative and documentary films, a world-renowned annual film festival (HIFF) each October, a summer documentary program, a unique Screenwriters Lab, and extensive educational initiatives, HamptonsFilm offers programs that enlighten, educate, and provide invaluable exposure for filmmakers, while also providing the East End of Long Island with an educational and cultural experience that enriches the lives of its citizens and contributes to the local economy.\n\nHamptonsFilm also partners with numerous international and national organizations, including an educational initiative with the United Nations, a long-standing partnership with the New York Film Critics Circle (NYFCC), who serve on the jury and moderate Q&As, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), to bring industry titans to each year’s festival.\n\nThe annual film festival, the premier film event on New York State’s East End, and recently referred to by Variety as “one of America’s most glamorous displays of the best in cutting-edge cinema,” continues to play an important role during awards season, with a significant number of titles highlighted every year at the Academy Awards.\n\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival (HIFF) celebrated 30 years in 2022 as the tent-pole event of HamptonsFilm, is a premiere film event in New York State and an intimate showcase of some of the year’s best offerings in contemporary cinema from around the world.\n\nHIFF showcases independent film—long, short, narrative and documentary—and introduces a unique and varied spectrum of international films and filmmakers to our audiences. The festival is committed to exhibiting films that express fresh voices and differing global perspectives to enlighten audiences, educate, provide invaluable exposure for filmmakers, and present inspired entertainment.\n\nHIFF has awarded prizes to filmmakers in cash, goods and services of over $5 million over the past 31 years, with annual cash and in-kind prizes totaling more than $130,000. HamptonsFilm’s annual Film Festival hosts four distinct competitions, focused specifically on early-career filmmakers, bolstering their work at an important juncture.\n\nHIFF also presents numerous other awards, including the Peter Macgregor Scott Memorial Award, the Brizzolara Family Foundation Award for Films of Conflict & Resolution, the Zelda Penzel Giving Voice to the Voiceless Award, the Rabinowitz Award for Social Justice, the Dick Cavett Artistic Champion Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, and more!\n\nA program of HamptonsFilm, the Hamptons International Film Festival takes place annually in October. HIFF is the premier film event on New York State’s East End, and is an intimate showcase of some of the year’s best offerings in contemporary cinema. Recently referred to as “Telluride East” by Variety, the publication cited HIFF as “one of America’s most glamorous displays of the best in cutting-edge cinema.” Festival selections continue to play an important role during awards season, with a significant number of titles highlighted every year at the Academy Awards. 2021 marked the 12th time in a row that a film in the Festival has become the eventual Best Picture winner at the Oscars, making HIFF the only Festival in the world with such a distinction.\n\nFilms featured at the 2023 Festival received 43 Academy Award nominations, and overall, films in the last 16 editions have received a total of 570 Oscar nominations. In a recent article about HIFF, Variety noted, “The Festival has grown a reputation for being able to read the Academy voting tea leaves and routinely promotes Oscar race front-runners, but has also become the place to see emerging talent before they become marquee names.”\n\nHIFF31 was pleased to screen the following films in 2023: NYAD (East Coast Premiere), THE HOLDOVERS (East Coast Premiere), AMERICAN FICTION (East Coast Premiere), RUSTIN (East Coast Premiere), ANATOMY OF A FALL, MAESTRO, MAY DECEMBER, ALL OF US STRANGERS, THE TEACHER’S LOUNGE (East Coast Premiere), SOCIETY OF THE SNOW (North American Premiere), DREAM SCENARIO (New York Premiere), PAST LIVES, THE ZONE OF INTEREST, FOUR DAUGHTERS (Co-US Premiere), IN RESTLESS DREAMS: THE MUSIC OF PAUL SIMON (New York Premiere), and many more.\n\nAn Academy Award-qualifying festival, HIFF hosts multiple competitions focused specifically on early-career filmmakers, in the hopes of bolstering their work at an important juncture and helping develop a discussion around their films, both within the film community and beyond. The Festival also features four signature programs: Films of Conflict & Resolution; Compassion, Justice & Animal Rights; Air, Land & Sea; and Views From Long Island. With cash prizes handed out totaling more than $130,000, HIFF continues to attract some of the best films of the year. Past Audience Award winners include Academy Award®-winning THE WHITE HELMETS, LA LA LAND, ROOM, THE IMITATION GAME, THE ARTIST, THE KING’S SPEECH and Academy Award®-nominated BOBI WINE: THE PEOPLE’S PRESIDENT, I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO and PHILOMENA.\n\nRecent HIFF highlights include LIVING (East Coast Premiere), THE WHALE (East Coast Premiere), THE SON (East Coast Premiere), WOMEN TALKING, THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, SHE SAID, ALL THAT BREATHES, EO, AFTERSUN, TRIANGLE OF SADNESS, ALL THE BEAUTY AND THE BLOODSHED, THE POWER OF THE DOG, PARALLEL MOTHERS, THE LOST DAUGHTER, C’MON C’MON, CYRANO (East Coast Premiere), FLEE, DRIVE MY CAR, A HERO (East Coast Premiere), SPENCER (East Coast Premiere), MOTHERING SUNDAY (US Premiere), THE FRENCH DISPATCH, PASSING, THE RESCUE, NOMADLAND, MINARI, THE FATHER, PARASITE, THE IRISHMAN, MARRIAGE STORY, JOJO RABBIT (East Coast Premiere), THE TWO POPES (East Coast Premiere), CLEMENCY, FORD V FERRARI, WAVES (East Coast Premiere), KNIVES OUT (East Coast Premiere), JUST MERCY, GREEN BOOK, ROMA, THE FAVOURITE, CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?, COLD WAR, SHOPLIFTERS, FIRST MAN, THE SHAPE OF WATER (East Coast Premiere), THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI (US Premiere), DARKEST HOUR (East Coast Premiere), CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, GET OUT, I, TONYA (US Premiere), A FANTASTIC WOMAN (East Coast Premiere), ICARUS, STRONG ISLAND, THE FLORIDA PROJECT, MOONLIGHT, SPOTLIGHT (East Coast Premiere), CAROL, YOUTH (East Coast Premiere), BROOKLYN, BIRDMAN, STILL ALICE (US Premiere), THE IMITATION GAME, WILD (East Coast Premiere), NIGHTCRAWLER (East Coast Premiere), FOXCATCHER, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, HER, NEBRASKA, BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, ARGO (East Coast Premiere), AMOUR, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (East Coast Premiere), SEARCHING FOR SUGARMAN, THE DESCENDANTS, MELANCHOLIA, SHAME, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (East Coast Premiere), and BLACK SWAN (East Coast Premiere).\n\nHIFF has a continuing partnership with The New York Film Critics Circle, which sends their critics to attend the Festival every year.
