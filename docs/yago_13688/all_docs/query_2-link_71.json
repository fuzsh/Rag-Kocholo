        "text": "One more year Spain dresses up with the celebration of the 61 San Sebastian International Festival, the most important in the group of Spanish-speaking countries, and in this edition Spanish cinema is once again one of the protagonists. This year Zinemaldia has a great reception from the public, surpassing the number of entries from the last edition.\n\nIn addition, for the first time at the Festival, an animated film has opened the event, 'Foosball', out of competition, by Argentine filmmaker Juan José Campanella ('El secreto de tus ojos', Oscar 2010). And as in other years, it has a very varied jury such as director Todd Haynes, a reference in American independent cinema who has also gone on to television ('Mildred Pierce') and Cesc Gay ('VOS'), the musician David Byrne ('Talking Heads ') or the actor Diego Luna ('And your mom too').\n\nPresentation of the San Sebastian International Festival 2013\n\nAmong the candidates for the 'Golden Shell' in the Official Section of Zinemaldia we find renowned directors such as Atom Egoyan, Götz Spielmann and Jasmila Zbanic.

The 'Almodóvar girl' received the award very emotionally during the presentation of the Official Section, out of competition, of the latest film in which she has participated: 'The Witches of Zugarramundi', the new work by director Álex de la Iglesia.\n\nThe actress Carmen Maura with the Donostia Award\n\nThe closing of Zinemaldia features the world premiere of the film 'The young and prodigious TS Spivet (The extraordinary journey of TS Spivet), by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.\n\nFilms in competition for the 'Golden Shell'\n\n- Cannibal, by Manuel Martín Cuenca (Spain-Romania-Russia-France)\n\n- Sandwich club, by Fernando Eimbcke (Mexico)\n\n- Devil's Knot (Condemned), by Atom Egoyan (USA)\n\n- ENEMY, by Denis Villeneuve (Spain-Canada)\n\n- For those who can tell no such, by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia-Herzegovina)\n\n- The wound, by Fernando Franco (Spain)\n\n- My love for all my dreams, by François Dupeyron (France)\n\n- October November/October November, by Götz Spielmann (Austria)\n\n- quai d'orsay, by Bertrand Tavernier (France)\n\n- The railway man (A Long Journey), by Jonathan Teplitzky (UK-Australia)\n\n- Living is easy with closed eyes, by David Trueba (Spain)\n\n- The Weekend, by Roger Michell (United Kingdom)\n\nZinelmandia from Spain\n\nThe San Sebastian International Festival is one of the oldest and most prestigious in Europe. Its first edition was held on September 21, 1953. Throughout its history, it has been the scene of international premieres such as 'Vertigo' or the world premiere of 'Death on our heels', both films by Alfred Hitchcock, or the world premiere of the 'Star Wars' saga. Each edition brings together a selection of unpublished feature films from the world film production of the year that meets the conditions indicated by the Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF). Since its 55th edition, Zinemaldia has considered independent, Latin American (Horizontes Latinos section) and Spanish (Made in Spain section) films of international quality.\n\nThe official jury of the Festival will award the following prizes:\n\n- Golden Shell for Best Film (for the producer)\n\n- Silver Shell for the best director.\n\n- Silver Shell for best actress.\n\n- Silver Shell for best actor.\n\n- Jury Prize for best photography.\n\n- Jury Award for Best Screenplay.\n\nThe 'Golden Shell'\n\nPresence of Spanish cinema at the Festival\n\nIt has undoubtedly been the year of Spanish directors in the Official Selection at the Festival. Specifically, four directors have competed for the Golden Shell, three Spanish productions are present in the New Directors section, and eleven feature films premiere in other sections, and out of competition, the new work by Álex de la Iglesia has been presented ' The witches of Zugarramundi' that has been premiered to give the Donostia Award to Carmen Maura, where she performs.\n\nIn the Official Section two Spanish productions and two co-productions competed: David Trueba, with his film 'Vivir es fácil con los ojos cerrados', narrates the unforgettable friendship that arises between three characters who happen to meet in Almería (Javier Cámara); Fernando Franco presents his debut feature 'La herida', which deals with the difficulties of Ana, an ambulance driver, who finds it difficult to relate and who suffers from borderline personality disorder; Manuel Martín Cuenca with 'Cannibal', narrates the life of a prestigious tailor who is a shadow assassin and who has no remorse or guilt until Nina appears in his life; and Denis Villeneuve, with 'Enemy', a mysterious thriller that explores the psyche of a man in crisis (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nFrames from Spanish films: 'Enemy', 'Cannibal', 'Living is easy with your eyes closed' and 'La Herida'.\n\nOther young talents have competed in the New Directors section: Fran Araujo and Ernesto de Nova, with 'El Rayo'; Isabel Ayguavives, with 'The magnetic tree'; and Aarón Fernández, with 'The dead hours'.\n\nIn the Pearls Section, 'Gloria' by Sebastián Lelio, winner of the Zinemaldia Film in Progress Award last year, was screened.\n\nIn the Zabaltegi Section They have presented: 'Family tour', by Liliana Torres; Hotzanak, for your own safety', by Izibene Oñederra; 'Rabbit Woman', by Verónica Chen; The King of Canfranc, by Manuel Priede and José Antonio Blanco; 'Serrat and Sabina: the symbol and the friend', by Francesc Relea; I'm still (Kachkaniraqmi), by Javier Corcuera; 'Violet', by Luiso Berdejo; and Zela Trovke (Cutting Grass), by Asier Altuna.\n\nAnd in Horizontes Latinos Three Spanish co-productions have competed: 'La jaula de oro', by Diego Quemada-Díez; 'I thought there was going to be a party', by Victoria Galardi; and 'The German doctor-Wakolda', by Lucía Puenzo.\n\nThe film 'Zipi y Zape and the marble club', by Oskar Santos, was also released at the Velodrome."
