        "text": "But the city cleaned up its streets, activated the tourist trade, and\n\nthanks to much skilled restoration now looks even more colonial than it\n\nused to. The effect is of a visit to an elegant and bustling 18th\n\ncentury, updated by cars and discos and cellphones. And for one week of\n\nthe year at least, the time of its annual international film festival,\n\nnow in its ninth season, Morelia has glamour in addition to its old\n\ncharm: red carpets, parties, international directors and stars,\n\njournalists everywhere, lots of happy gawking crowds. A waitress asks me\n\ndiscreetly when Diego Luna is arriving. I can’t tell her, because I\n\ndon’t know; and I don’t tell the waitress I don’t know who Diego Luna\n\nis.\n\nThe festival has various premieres, retrospectives of the work of\n\nseveral directors, thematic cycles (the presence of Mexico in film noir,\n\nfor example), showcases for the films of special guests (in this case\n\nVolker Schlöndorff and Béla Tarr), and competitions for best Mexican\n\ndocumentary, feature film and short. Along with Mark Cousins and\n\nFrançois Dupeyron, I am a member of the jury for the best feature. Of\n\ncourse the chance to watch films you are not judging is one of the\n\nattractions of such a festival, and I thought of devoting this space to\n\nJacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past (1947),\n\nan inspired film noir I hadn’t seen before, where the ruthless,\n\ncalculating woman, in the shape of Jane Greer, may also really care for\n\nthe man she is framing and using, a very young Robert Mitchum. This\n\ncomplexity is not going to do her any good, because both the plot and\n\nMitchum believe in the simpler story of her murderous guile. But we are\n\nleft wondering if there isn’t some sort of baffled innocence lurking in\n\nher evildoings.\n\nThe festival programme also allows for riffs and sequences you couldn’t\n\nhave foreseen. I came to wonder, for instance, why new Mexican movies\n\nlinger so obsessively over lost or distressed figures whom ordinary,\n\nundamaged people can’t help, and indeed for whom normality itself has\n\nbecome a brutal, unforgiving enemy. There may be a link here to the use\n\nof black comedy to cope with unmanageable realities, and an accidental\n\nsequence of viewings brought this strongly to mind. One day I saw Luis\n\nGarcía Berlanga’s The Executioner\n\n(1963), in which a young man becomes a public executioner in Spain:\n\naccommodation is scarce, and this way he is entitled to a flat. His hope\n\nis that no one will be sentenced to death for a long time, and his plan\n\nis to resign as soon as it does happen, before he is required to act.\n\nHe isn’t opposed to capital punishment, just horrified by the thought of\n\nthe job and its unpopular social aura. The truly memorable moments of\n\nunlaughable comedy come when he finally has to take a man’s life. The\n\ncondemned criminal is sick, and is half-led, half-carried towards his\n\ndeath by a group of warders. Behind him the reluctant, still struggling\n\nexecutioner is dragged along by another group. In one shot these two\n\nclusters of figures in black, seen from behind in long shot, cross an\n\nempty courtyard within the prison, and vanish. This is as close as we\n\nget to the actual execution, but we feel we have seen some sort of\n\nparable about conformity and coercion, and how death’s servants will\n\nalways get the job done.\n\nThe Mexican movie I saw the day after, Kenya Márquez’s Expiration Date (Fecha\n\nde Caducidad; ‘Best Before Date’, or ‘Best Before’, would be a catchier\n\nand crueller translation) picks up this note, but is even darker. The\n\naudience was laughing out loud, but I felt its (irresistible) humour\n\ncalled for a more troubled reaction. It stars the well-known Mexican\n\nactor Damián Alcázar as an odd-job man who is delighted to find a\n\nbeat-up old Datsun abandoned on the wasteland where he lives. He is less\n\ndelighted to find a severed head beside the car, and much of the movie\n\nhas to do with his trying to dispose of it. There are two other stories –\n\nthat of a girl who has killed her abusive boyfriend and run away, and\n\nthat of a mother whose graceless grown-up son has disappeared – and the\n\nnarrative takes up the three different points of view in turn. One of\n\nthe beauties of the film is that each of the characters is forced to\n\ninvent a story for what is happening to them, and each set of lies fools\n\nsomeone else irremediably. The film’s combination of perfectly false\n\nstories and impeccably pitched grim jokes says a whole lot, it seems to\n\nme, about how one talks about the unspeakable.\n\nThe Iliad of Homer - University of Chicago Press"
