        "text": "Chantal Akerman then made a video of her sole attempt at filmed theatre, positioning her camera before and even on the stage, bringing Delphine and Coralie Seyrig together in an intimate huis clos. This is how she met Claire Atherton, with whom she would collaborate for more than thirty years.\n\n\"11 February 1963, Sylvia Plath, American poetess, 30 years old, married with two children, committed suicide. Up until that moment, she had been engaged in a long and detailed correspondence with her mother. Françoise Merle staged a show in 1984 around this correspondence, a cantata for two voices in which the voices of mother and daughter merged, dialogued, separated and sought each other. Chantal Akerman followed this path leading from madness to death, a path constantly charted by this exchange of fragile voices, recounting the difficulty of writing, the joys and suffering of life as a lover and a mother. As ever, Akerman worked first with time, and the time of madness is a material that is certainly difficult to grasp but extraordinarily motivating. The whole project can be summed up in one proposition: the pace of the film must follow the meanders of the heroine's mind. Between the euphoric periods and the ramped-up speed of words as they criss-cross each other, snapping at each other, there is more than one parallel: a veritable osmosis exists which the filming (made up entirely of reverse-angle shots) and editing (playing with the gracious or miraculous alternating slice of cuts) underscore to infinity.\n\nPreviously, for example, in her American films, Chantal Akerman had played preferably with the wealth of long durations; here, she adapts her vision and her ear to the instinctive words of an intensely lived correspondence. When Sylvia first discovers flirting, the whole film seems to take off in a transport of joy, the images surpass each other as they underscore the voracious smiles and sparkling eyes of a laughing face that is framed close-up with a speed that is rich in meaning. And when, on the contrary, anxiety raises its head, the dry mouth and gnawed nails set the tone of the images that swing into greenish hues and pallid skin. There is such intensity of vision in this video film, such a desire to exchange comforting words, and also such a will to bruise, that the intersecting sounds and images are finally painful. Out of these incessant intersections is born an emotion that is difficult to contain.\"\n\nAntoine de Baecque, Cahiers du cinéma, n°399, September 1987\n\nChantal Akerman, Letters Home, 1986, video, colour, sound, 104 min, Centre Pompidou collection\n\nWith Delphine Seyrig and Coralie Seyrig\n\nPhotography: Luc Benhamou, sound: Alix Compte, editor: Claire Atherton, soundtrack composed by: Chantal Akerman and Claire Atherton\n\nProjection followed by a discussion with Claire Atherton and Coralie Seyrig.\n\nClaire Atherton\n\nClaire Atherton is a film editor. She was born in San Francisco in 1963 and grew up in Paris.\n\nAttracted by Taoist philosophy and the visual aspect of ideograms, she studied Chinese language and civilization while working as a video technician, notably for the Centre Simone de Beauvoir. At the same time, she enrolled for professional training with the École Louis Lumière. She began by working on framing and lighting while also interested in recording soundtracks, but found her vocation in editing. In 1986 she edited Letters Home, by Chantal Akerman, with Coralie and Delphine Seyrig. It was the beginning of a thirty-year collaboration on the filmmaker's films and installations, up until her last film, No Home Movie, and her last installation, Now. She is currently in charge of designing and arranging the spatial organisation of Chantal Akerman's installations for exhibitions all over the world.\n\nClaire Atherton also works with many directors and artists from different horizons. Among them, Luc Decaster, Noëlle Pujol, Andreas Bolm, Emmanuelle Demoris, Elsa Quinette, Christophe Bisson, Éric Baudelaire and Maria Kourkouta. In 2013 her work was honoured by a retrospective at the Grenoble Cinematheque. In 2019, the Locarno International Film Festival awarded her the Ticinomoda Vision Award for her work during her career.\n\nCoralie Seyrig\n\nCoralie Seyrig is a French actor. After studying theatre in New York with Stella Adler in the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and in Paris with Andréas Voutsinas, Coralie Seyrig acted in many plays, notably Une minute encore (One More Minute, Théâtre 14) and Accents en Alsace (Accents in Alsace, Théâtre de Bobigny). In 2011, she was alone on stage in Madame de… Vilmorin, in which she again played with Christine Dejoux, with whom she had already worked for L’Écumeur (The Buccaneer, 2001). Coralie Seyrig also works in the world of film, playing in movies by Robert Enrico, Michel Drach, Chantal Akerman, Pascal Thomas, Brigitte Roüan, Nicole Garcia, and François Dupeyron"
