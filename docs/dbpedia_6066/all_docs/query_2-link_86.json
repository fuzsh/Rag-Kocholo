        "text": "Empirical Investigation of Parentification\n\nMost extant research has focused on the link between childhood parentification and difficulty in later adult relationships. Adults who retrospectively report experiencing this dynamic during childhood are likely to report feeling that they were treated unfairly and to express discontent with the quality of their homelife (Jurkovic, Thirkfield, & Morrell, 2001). Research has also linked parentification to shame and guilt (Wells & Jones, 2000), dependent behavior in adult relationships (Wells, Glickauf-Hughes, & Jones, 1999), poorer academic performance among college students (Chase, Deming, & Wells, 1998), higher levels of depression and anxiety in early adulthood (Hetherington, 1999), and difficulty in peer relationships (M. T. Martin, 1996). Notably, these findings consistently suggest that girls are at greater risk for parentification than boys. However, gender may moderate risk such that paternal parentification is more detrimental to boys, whereas maternal role reversal carries more adverse consequences for girls (Macfie, Houts, McElwain, & Cox, 2005).\n\nStudies of parentification and concurrent childhood adjustment also suggest this dynamic has harmful effects. Specifically, parentification has been linked to both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (Carlson, Jacobvitz, & Sroufe, 1995; Jacobvitz, Hazen, Curran, & Hitchens, 2004; Johnston, 1990; Stein, Riedel, & Rotheram-Borus, 1999) and to poorer social adjustment (Macfie et al., 2005). Notably, research with youth populations has focused primarily on toddlers and children; examination of the parentification dynamic in adolescent samples has been limited (e.g., Hetherington, 1999). This is striking given that emotional caregiving is likely to be especially problematic during adolescence, when the increasingly salient drive for independence competes with needs for closeness (Davies, 2002). Indeed, Cummings, Ballard, El-Sheikh, and Lake (1991) found that children’s tendencies to mediate in parents’ conflicts peaked in middle adolescence (i.e., 14 years of age). Given that this is a prime time for such behavior, one might also expect parentification to be at a high point in this period.\n\nSeveral other aspects of the parentification construct are in need of empirical scrutiny. First, although theory posits that the parent–child dynamic is a stable aspect of the family system (Macfie et al., 2005), its continuity during adolescence has yet to be established. Second, the mechanisms by which parentification works to undermine child well-being require elucidation, particularly with regard to the specific child or adult behaviors that may account for its harmful effects. In particular, it has yet to be established empirically that the parentification process draws children into marital conflict to the extent that they take steps to mediate or resolve it. In addition, differences in how parents and children view the dynamic must be examined, particularly in light of theories stipulating that parents may view the relationship as warm and supportive, whereas children may view it as lacking in these qualities (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Spark, 1984). Understanding disparities in how parents and children view the parentification dynamic is central to understanding the process by which it may influence child outcomes. Finally, distinctions between parentification and related constructs have yet to be examined empirically. This is particularly important given that parentification is one of myriad terms used to describe situations in which boundaries are violated and child autonomy is undermined. The concept of psychological control (Barber, Stolz, & Olsen, 2005), for example, addresses the extent to which parents use guilt induction and other control strategies to maintain closeness to their children. Distinguishing parentification from this concept is an important step toward validating the construct.\n\nApplying a multi-method, multi-informant approach that measures parentification in both mothers and fathers, in the present study we attempted to addresses these issues. We hypothesized that parentification, as measured via youth self-report, will be (a) stable over time, (b) more common among mothers and their daughters, (c) associated with higher levels of marital conflict and youth appraisals of threat, (d) linked to increased likelihood of adolescent attempts to intervene in marital conflict, (e) associated with adolescent report of lower levels of parental support but with increased parental perceptions of closeness and support, (f) associated with higher rates of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescents, and (g) predictive of adolescent adjustment problems above and beyond existing measures of parental psychological control.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we employed a multi-informant, multi-method approach to link adolescent self-report of parentification with specific youth and adult behaviors. Consistent with expectations, parentification ratings were stable over the 1-year period between study waves and were associated with marital conflict, higher levels of perceived threat for adolescents, and an increased tendency for youths to intervene in marital conflict. In addition, parentification was associated with youth perceptions of low warmth and support in the parent–child relationship and with youth reports of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.\n\nIn considering these findings, it is important to note that youths reported relatively low levels of parentification at both time points. Thus, stable ratings of parentification tended to indicate a consistent lack of enmeshed dynamics rather than a continuous presence of them. It may be the case that the subtle nature of this complex family dynamic was not adequately captured by the EPQ measure. However, it seems equally plausible that in a sample of primarily maritally intact families, parentification was a low base-rate occurrence. That is, in families in which both parents are present, there may be less of a need for parents to seek support from children or for children to assume peer status among adults. Regardless of its rate of occurrence, the stability of parentification ratings provides valuable insight into the continuity of affective family dynamics. Moreover, these findings shed light on parentification in community samples and suggest that the relevance of the construct may extend beyond high-risk or divorce samples.\n\nFrom a methodological standpoint, these findings extend M. T. Martin’s (1996) work on the EPQ measure and provide further evidence for its reliability. From a conceptual perspective, they suggest that the family dynamic captured by the EPQ may reflect a stable pattern of interaction rather than a transient response to stressful circumstances or life events. Certainly, this is in keeping with earlier work in the area (Sroufe, Jacobvitz, Magelsdorf, DeAngelo, & Ward, 1985) as well as a substantial body of literature on the continuity of dysfunctional parenting strategies (see Holden & Miller, 1999).\n\nThe present findings also shed light on the issue of who seeks support and who is called upon to provide it. Implicit in most conceptualizations of parentification is the idea that mothers may be more likely than fathers to seek emotional support from their children (Jurkovic, 1997). However, the present investigation is one of only a handful of studies to obtain parentification data on both mothers and fathers (Jacobvitz et al., 2004; Kerig, 2005; Rowa, Kerig, & Geller, 2001). Consistent with earlier findings, youths in this study perceived higher levels of emotional support seeking from their mothers versus fathers, and girls were more likely than boys to report parentification from their mothers (Jacobvitz et al., 2004; Macfie et al., 2005).\n\nThis study also attempted to link parentification to key parenting behaviors with which it is associated in the literature theoretically. Specifically, theories of parentification stipulate that emotional support seeking from parents is linked to a lack of sensitivity to child needs (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Spark, 1984). Moreover, parents and children are hypothesized to view parentification differently, with parents perceiving closeness and warmth and children viewing these qualities as lacking (Jurkovic, 1997). The present investigation provides empirical support for these ideas, demonstrating that mothers who were rated high in parentification were more likely to employ parenting strategies that their children viewed as low in warmth and support. Rather than viewing parental pulls for support as a sign of relationship closeness, youths may experience the dynamic as a detriment to their own support and nurturance. By contrast, parents rated high in parentification by their children did not tend to view the relationship as less warm or supportive.\n\nInterestingly, compromises in parenting may occur regardless of which parent does the support seeking. Indeed, maternal parentification was linked to youth perceptions of low warmth in mothers and fathers. Family systems theory suggests that the collective experience of the family unit has implications for individual dyadic relationships. Thus, in this regard, it makes sense that when mothers turn to their children for support, it may have consequences for how children view their fathers. Youths who are drawn into alliances with their mothers may naturally be inclined to view their fathers as less warm or supportive. Alternatively, the difficulties in the interparental subsystem that elicit maternal support seeking may be the very same stressors that cause both parents to be compromised in their parenting abilities.\n\nCritically, these findings suggest that parents and children do not view the parentification dynamic the same way. Although the hypothesis that parentification would be associated with parental perceptions of warmth in the parent–child relationship was not supported, it is clear that youths differ from their parents in their views of the parentification dynamic. Although parents may not view support seeking as a marker of closeness in the parent–child relationship, they may also fail to recognize it as an impediment to support and nurture in the same way that youths do.\n\nAs a step toward understanding the process underlying the parentification dynamic, in this study we also examined its links to marital conflict, youth perceptions of threat, and youth intervention in marital disputes. Theories of parentification suggest that parentification emerges in response to family stress (e.g., marital conflict) and that children are at risk because they feel responsible for their parents’ problems and make efforts to manage them. However, research on whether children feel threatened by parental disclosures is limited (Jurkovic et al., 2001), and the specific issue of whether parentification is tied to active efforts to intervene in marital conflict has yet to be addressed. The present findings indicate that for parents, parentification is linked to higher levels of marital conflict, and for youths, it is linked to greater perceptions of threat when conflict occurs. Moreover, they indicate that parentification is associated with an increased tendency for youths to intervene in interparental conflict, supporting the notion that the dynamic effectively engages children in adult problems. Viewed through the lens of the emotional security hypothesis (Cummings & Davies, 2002; Davies & Cummings, 1994; Davies, Cummings, & Winter, 2004), which suggests that youths act strategically to maintain a sense of safety, it is understandable that in situations in which parents share their distress directly with their children, youths may feel threatened and, in turn, all the more compelled to take action.\n\nThese findings also provide support for the idea that youths who experience parentification from their mothers may be likely to report behavior problems in both the internalizing and externalizing spectra. Extending earlier work in this area (Jacobvitz et al., 2004; Jurkovic et al., 2001) to adolescent populations, they provide the first evidence that parentification makes a unique contribution to behavior problems, above and beyond ratings of psychological control. Notably, the EPQ was not associated with most parent reports of youth adjustment problems, and it is important to recognize that the link between parentification and youth outcomes is modest. However, in some respects, this finding is not surprising; research suggests that parents and children often do not agree on such problems (Hawley & Weisz, 2003). Moreover, youth internalizing symptoms in particular are likely to be overlooked by adults, especially during adolescence (J. L. Martin, Ford, Dyer-Friedman, Tang, & Huffman, 2004; Yeh & Weisz, 2001). Finally, a number of studies suggest that stress in the family system, and maternal stress in particular, may be linked to parents’ failure to identify youth behavior problems (Briggs-Gowan, Carter, & Schwab-Stone, 1996; Youngstrom, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2000). To the extent that parentification reflects a particular response to maternal stress (as well as, potentially, a degree of self-centeredness), it seems plausible that mothers in this sample may have overlooked certain youth behavior problems. Alternatively, it may be the case that parents failed to endorse child adjustment problems because parentified youths appear outwardly competent and resilient. Indeed, Hetherington and Kelly (2002) reported that although parentified youths typically grew into high achieving and socially skilled adults, they tended to feel unsure of themselves and to be vulnerable to persistent symptoms of dysthymia.\n\nIn interpreting these findings, it is important to note several study limitations. First, the majority of aims in this investigation were addressed via cross-sectional, correlation analyses with a low-risk sample. As a result, it is difficult to parse apart the direction of effects or to make inferences about causality. In addition, it is difficult to ascertain the degree to which these findings hold for the high-risk samples cited in much of the theoretical literature on parentification. Second, the homogenous, high-functioning nature of this community sample of intact families may limit generalization of study findings. Reliance on a single self-report inventory to measure the central construct of interest in this study also constrains interpretation of findings. Finally, it is important to note that although efforts were made to reduce method variance by relying on multiple informants for key outcome measures, many central findings are likely inflated by youth report on both the predictor and criterion measures.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, the present investigation marks a step forward in empirical work with the parentification construct. This study provides evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the parentification dynamic, and it makes valuable strides in distinguishing it from related concepts such as psychological control. Prior work has demonstrated the potential harm that parentification may foster but has not addressed the process by which this damage occurs. Taken together, the results of this study take a small but critical step toward addressing this gap. They elucidate core aspects of the parentification construct and provide a much-needed empirical backbone for existing theories of this dynamic."
