        "text": "Back in August, my family of five had hit a pandemic wall. We had played every board game, read every book and baked all the chocolate desserts we could find. By October, we had even grown listless with our TV options.\n\nSo when my mom mentioned offhand that she and my father had been watching “Schitt’s Creek,” a sitcom about a formerly wealthy family that lost everything and was forced to relocate to a small town they had purchased as a joke, my interest was piqued. You might appreciate David, she said, who is one of network TV’s few pansexual main characters. She likened him in part to my middle child, 13, who is transgender, nonbinary and pansexual.\n\nWe were desperate for a new series and, keen to learn more about David, we gave the show a try, despite the fact it was a little mature for our two younger children, 10 and 13, because of language and sexual innuendo. Within a few weeks, our boredom was replaced with laughter, and we found that the sitcom had unexpectedly strengthened our family bond.\n\nDuring arguments, my kids started tossing their favorite lines from the show at each other — “Oh, burn, David! Oh my God, ew, David!” — to break up tension. After a poignant scene showing rare sibling affection between David and his younger sister, my typically reserved 17-year-old invited my 13-year-old — who was having a rough night — to sleep in her bedroom.\n\nJo-Ann Finkelstein, a clinical psychologist in Chicago, said that it’s understandable that parents might be allowing their children to watch TV shows or movies that are slightly more mature for their age during the pandemic. Parents are more available to supervise, and to provide insight and support. “And if you can stretch the age restriction so that the show actually holds interest for the parents, it provides commonality,” Dr. Finkelstein added, giving families “more to talk about” when there is so little happening day to day.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
