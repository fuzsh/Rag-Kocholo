        "text": "Chapter 2\n\nRR2.1: Marital Conflict and Children\n\nThis section provides research outlining the effect of one’s marriage on the quality of one’s parenting. Cummings and Davies have found that marital conflicts affect on children is not based on a one-time argument, but rather over a period of time. They wrote:\n\n…However, the risk factor operates over time and insidiously, by altering family and child functioning over time.[i]\n\nArguments that are repaired satisfactorily and amicably with both parents being happy with the outcome actually have a positive impact on the children because it models for them how conflicts should be resolved. These are called constructive conflicts. However, the types of arguments that will have a much more negative impact on the children are those that are left unresolved over long periods of time, repeated heated and aggressive type of conflicts, and conflicts where one parent is being subjugated by the other. These are called destructive conflicts.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes we are not the best judge of whether our conflicts with our spouse are constructive or destructive. Often we lack the awareness to know how we come across to our children. As parents we tend to underestimate the effect of our conflicts with our spouse. Cummings and Davies’ research found that the children’s evaluation and response to a conflict is the best way to determine whether a conflict is constructive or destructive. Children’s responses include their emotional reactions as well as their coping mechanisms. So if a conflict is producing more positive responses than negative responses, then it is fair to classify it as constructive. If it is producing more negative responses than positive responses, then it would fall in the category of a destructive conflict. Based on this research, the following kinds of conflict have been found to be destructive.[ii]\n\nPhysical aggression, involving swearing, insulting, throwing or smashing, or threatening to hit.\n\nVerbal hostility, which includes yelling as well as verbal threats.\n\nNon-verbal hostility, which includes withdrawal by husbands and/or wives, i.e., giving each other the silent treatment. This has been reported to have a negative effect on children’s behaviour and state of mind, including causing distress. One study showed that the children’s reactions to verbal conflict were similar to their reactions to non-verbal conflict. In fact, parents’ non-verbal reactions of fear caused more distress in the children than heated arguments.[iii]\n\nOne study showed that if apologies were accompanied by negative emotions, then it had a negative effect on the children.[iv] Another study found that children’s feelings of distress diminished when conflicts were resolved at an emotional level.[v] Another finding notes that conflicts which were not resolved but which were portrayed by parents to have been okay were found to have not been so beneficial to the children.[vi] Lastly, insecurity in children was caused equally by both a father and mother’s behaviour during conflict.[vii]\n\n[i] Cummings, E.

While it is true that babies do not know the content of the parents’ arguments, they are able to sense that something is wrong.[v]\n\nHetherington describes the first two years following a divorce as a time of serious disruptions to parent-child relationships. Divorce and conflicts leading up to a divorce can cause parents to be depressed, distracted and exhausted, which can prevent them from being effective disciplinarians.[vi] Difficulty controlling and monitoring children’s behaviour is the most sustained parenting problem faced by divorced mothers.\n\nPlease refer to the introduction of our marriage book, I Choose Us, for more information about the effects of marriage on parenting.[vii]\n\n[i] Cummings & Davies (2010), Marital conflict and children, 89.\n\n[ii] El-Sheikh, M., Buckhalt, J.

A shortage of safe, stable, nurturing relationships appears to most heavily burden older adolescents and children living in non-traditional family structures.[ii]\n\nResearch based on a nationally representative sample of over 2,000 children in the USA between ages 2-9 showed that emotional abuse and inconsistent or hostile parenting emerged as having the most powerful independent effects on child trauma symptoms.[iii]\n\nChildren who experience harsh, coercive, unpredictable or chaotic parenting and living arrangements are at increased risk for adverse developmental outcomes.[iv]\n\nIn one study reported in Live Science, the use of harsh verbal discipline with children at age 13 was associated with an increased risk of conduct problems and symptoms of depression at ages 13 and 14.[v]\n\n[i] Flaherty, E.G., Thompson, R., Dubowitz, H., Harvey, E.M., English, D.J., Proctor, L.J., and Runyan, D.K. 2013.

The stabilising relationships provide the support, scaffolding and protection that both buffer children from developmental disruptions and help build in important capabilities such as ability to plan, regulate behaviour, and adapt to changing circumstances, what is commonly known as “resilience”.[i]\n\nA study of over 3,300 students found that parenting characterised by warmth and structure positively predicts emotional creativity of students. Conversely, coercion and chaos in parenting has a negative effect. This study also reveals the importance of parents encouraging and providing autonomy in children as they age.[ii]\n\nWarm, responsive and consistent parenting is associated with positive life outcomes whereas harsh, coercive, abusive and neglectful parenting leads to poorer social, emotional and behavioural adjustment.[iii]\n\nWarm and responsive parenting predicts improvements in peer competence and relationships over time.[iv]\n\n[i] Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University.

A parenting style that offers support and acceptance of children’s feelings, by communicating about emotions in a helpful way, fosters children’s developing emotional skills; for example, by scaffolding the growth of competent flexible skills in emotional regulation. This association is apparent in young children and adolescents.[i]\n\nThe quality of Parent-child relationships affects the following:\n\nAggressive behaviour and delinquency (externalizing problems)\n\nDepression, anxiety and social withdrawal problems (internalizing problems)\n\nCognitive or academic outcome substantially\n\nQuality of peer and romantic relationships assessed many years later.\n\nConclusion: Parent-child relationship is important for all phases of life[ii]\n\nThe 2007 National Survey of Children’s Health focused on more than 64,000 respondents comprising children between the ages of 6 and 17 across various ethnic groups and families with different socio-economic status in America. Parents’ relationship quality was found to be consistently and positively associated with a range of child and family outcomes, such as child behaviour problems (externalizing), child social competence, child school engagement, child internalizing (depression), parent-child communication, and parental feelings of aggravation. This association was found across various subgroups: white, black and Hispanic couples; married and cohabiting couples; lower and higher income families; boys and girls, teens and younger children, immigrants and non-immigrants; and parents with post-secondary education, a high school education, and less than a high school education[iii]\n\nHigher quality of parent-adolescent relationship is associated with lower delinquency in adolescents[iv]\n\n[i] Thompson, Ross.

Beyond academics, teens whose parents are more involved and who feel they receive more support from their parents are more likely to participate in structured after-school activities that, in turn, are positively correlated with achievement and social competence.[i]\n\nResearchers from Penn State University (in 2005, using data from the Adolescent Health Survey) compared students from three generations of Asian, Hispanic and US born Caucasian families. Regardless of ethnicity, this study showed a significant but independent association between parenting styles and students’ grades, as well as positive relationships with others in the community. Thus youths who bonded with their parents and enjoyed good communication with them tended to have higher grades and better physical and emotional well-being.[ii]\n\nRR5.3: Connection and Acceptance Result in Healthy Functioning in Adulthood\n\nBased on Bowlby’s studies and his observations, the implication is that there is a correlation between a person’s attachment style as an adult and his or her childhood interactions with early caregivers.[iii] In other words, there is some degree of association between how secure people feel with their mothers and with their romantic partners in adulthood. According to Bowlby, the attachment system essentially explores on whether the attachment figure is in close proximity and is attentive, both of which provide security. If so, the child will feel loved, secure, and confident, and, behaviourally, is likely to explore his or her environment, be friendly and playful with others. On the other hand, if the child does not experience security and accessibility then the child will feel anxious and exhibit problematic behaviours during childhood. In addition, the effect will be seen in adulthood as well through their relationships with romantic partners.\n\nRR5.4: Fathers Contribution is as important as Mothers\n\nJohn’s research revealed that both fathers and mothers yielded almost the same effect sizes on the following measures:[iv]\n\nPersonality Assessment Questionnaire which measures seven personality disposition (Hostility / Aggression, Dependency, Negative Self-Esteem, Negative Self-Adequacy, Emotional Unresponsiveness, Emotional Instability, Negative Worldview);\n\nRyff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being which measures six facets of psychological well-being (Positive Relations with Others, Autonomy, Personal Growth, Environment Mastery, Purpose in Life, Self-Acceptance);\n\nDASS-21 which measures levels of Emotional Distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress);\n\nGratitude Questionnaire which measures current levels of gratitude; and Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S3); and\n\nYoung Positive Schema Questionnaire (YPSQ) which measures the current strength of 18 negative and 14 positive schemas respectively.\n\n[i] Kim, C.

It was also found that sexually abused girls had more partners than non-abused.[i]\n\nDealing with Sexual Abuse\n\nDo not be angry with your child or even surprised if they do not talk to you when they have been abused. The US-based National Center for Victims of Crime reports that there are many reasons why children are hesitant to disclose instances of abuse:[ii]\n\nChild Sexual Abuse Reporting\n\nChildren may resist reporting sexual abuse because they are afraid of angering the offender, they blame themselves for the abuse, or they feel guilty and ashamed. Children are more likely to reveal sexual abuse when talking to someone who appears to “already know” and is not judgmental, critical or threatening. They also tend to disclose when they believe continuation of the abuse will be unbearable, they are physically injured, or when they receive sexual abuse prevention information. Other reasons may be to protect another child or if pregnancy is a threat.[iii]\n\nOnce a child discloses the abuse, an appropriate response is extremely important to the child’s healing process. The adult being confided in should encourage the victim to talk freely, reassure the child that he or she is not to blame, and seek medical and psychological assistance. Family members may also benefit from mental health services.\n\nAdult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse\n\nSurvivors of child sexual abuse use coping mechanisms to deal with the horror of the abuse. One such mechanism known as protective denial entails repressing some or all of the abuse. This may cause significant memory gaps that can last months or even years. Victims also use dissociative coping mechanisms, such as becoming numb, to distance themselves from the psychological and physiological responses to the abuse. They may also turn to substance abuse, self-mutilation and eating disorders. In order to recover, adult survivors must adopt positive coping behaviours, forgive themselves, and relinquish their identities as survivors.[iv] The healing process can begin when the survivor acknowledges the abuse. When working with adult survivors of child sexual abuse, therapists should consider the survivor’s feeling of security and the personal and professional ramifications of disclosure, especially if the abuse involved a family member.\n\nSocietal influences play a big role in the recovery process. Although males may have been raised to “be tough” and shoulder responsibility for whatever happens to them, male victims need to understand that the victimization was not their fault. Only then can they begin to accept that they were not responsible for the abuse.[v]\n\nCycle of Violence\n\nChildren who are abused or neglected are more likely to become criminal offenders as adults. A National Institute of Justice study found “that childhood abuse increased the odds of future delinquency and adult criminality overall by 40 percent”.[vi] Child sexual abuse victims are also at risk of becoming ensnared in this cycle of violence. One expert estimates that 40% of sexual abusers were sexually abused as children. In addition, victims of child sexual abuse are almost 30 times more likely than non-victims to be arrested for prostitution as adults.[vii] Some victims become sexual abusers or prostitutes because they have a difficult time relating to others except on sexual terms.\n\nStopping the Cycle of Violence\n\nWith early detection and appropriate treatment, society can prevent some victimized children from becoming adult perpetrators. Parents must be on the alert, since abuse occurs at every socioeconomic level across ethnic and cultural lines within all religions and at all levels of education. Most importantly, in order to intervene early in abuse, parents should educate their children about appropriate sexual behaviour and how to feel comfortable saying “No”.[viii]\n\nAccording to the US based National Child Abuse Statistics in Childhelp, founded in 1959 by Sara O’Meara and Yvonne Fedderson:[ix]\n\nA report of child abuse is filed every ten seconds.\n\nMore than five children die every day as a result of child abuse.[x]\n\nApproximately 80% of children that die from abuse are under the age of four.[xi]\n\nIt is estimated that 50 to 60% of child fatalities due to maltreatment are not recorded as such on death certificates.[xii]\n\nMore than 90% of juvenile sexual abuse victims know their perpetrator in some way.[xiii]\n\nAbout 30% of abused and neglected children will later abuse their own children, continuing the horrible cycle of abuse.[xiv]\n\nAbout 80% of 21 year olds who were abused as children met the criteria for at least one psychological disorder.[xv]\n\nThe estimated cost of child abuse and neglect in the United States for 2008 was $124 billion.[xvi]\n\n14% of all men in prison in the USA were abused as children.[xvii]\n\n36% of all women in prison were abused as children.[xviii]\n\nA child who experiences child abuse and neglect is 59% more likely to be arrested as a juvenile, 28% more likely to be arrested as an adult, and 30% more likely to commit violent crime.[xix]\n\nAbused children are 25% more likely to experience teen pregnancy.[xx]\n\nAbused teens are less likely to practice safe sex, putting them at greater risk for STDs.[xxi]\n\nOne-third to two-thirds of child maltreatment cases involve substance abuse to some degree.[xxii]\n\nChildren whose parents abuse alcohol and other drugs are three times more likely to be abused and more than four times more likely to be neglected than children from non-abusing families.[xxiii]\n\nAs many as two-thirds of the people in treatment for drug abuse reported being abused or neglected as children.[xxiv]\n\n[i] Wong, M.

(Findings held up after statistical controls for household income, maternal employment, body mass index, physical activity, and other factors.)[iii]\n\nThe report also stated that conflicting schedules is the number one reason for not sharing a meal.[iv] Another study found that on days when adults felt hassled and stressed, they consumed more high fat/sugary snacks and spent fewer minutes having regular meals.[v] Given that more households are now two income households, less time is available to plan and cook healthy meals. Since meals at home are lower in calories and fat than meals in restaurants, the nutritional value of family meals has degraded.[vi] For example, kids’ menus usually offer hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, deep-fried meat dishes and sugar heavy desserts.\n\nThe environment of the mealtime is also a predictor of a child’s well-being, the report said. The absence of television is significantly related to the child’s well-being. When the family comes together at the table, there should be a certain expectation to serve, listen and give to each other, not just to eat. Families that communicate in a considerate, direct, and clear manner during mealtimes are also less likely to have children with internalizing symptoms, such as depression, worry, fear, self-injury, and social withdrawal.[vii]\n\nFinally the report revealed that parents giving attention to their children, responding to questions from their children, and keeping everyone’s behaviour at the table well regulated is associated with enriched language development and academic achievement.[viii] However, if either parent employs one or more of the various exasperation interactions, then the mealtime will serve as an example of an unhealthy parenting experience for their children, i.e. the process will backfire.\n\n[i] Fiese, B., & Schwartz, M.

She later invented an incubator that helped parents touch their new-born. The research that put Field and her organisation on the map showed that massage caused premature infants to gain more weight than their non-massaged peers—thereby improving the infants’ health and potentially saving millions of dollars each year in health-care costs. That study was published in 1988. Today, more than 100 studies and 350 medical journal articles later, Field is recognized as the premier expert in touch research and advocate for touch therapy.[i]\n\nRR8.2: Effects of Less Time Spent with Children\n\nThis section provides further research on the effects of a drastic decline in free time, playtime and unstructured outdoor activities that children experience during the past decade.\n\nIn a detailed article highlighting some very important trends related to the lack of connection that is all too common in America in recent years, the authors note the following:[ii]\n\n(Findings from national time diary surveys conducted in 1981 and 1997 by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.[iii] All findings reported below are from this study unless otherwise footnoted.)\n\nA major decline in the free time of children ages three to twelve between 1981 and 1997.\n\nFree time: A decline of twelve hours per week in overall free time for children\n\nPlay time: Decreased by three hours per week (a 25% drop from about sixteen hours to about thirteen hours for the whole group—less than nine hours per week for older children)\n\nUnstructured outdoor activities: Fell by 50% (includes activities such as walking, hiking or camping).\n\nA decline in family and religious participation time.\n\nHousehold conversations: Dropped by 100%, which means that in 1997 the average American family spent no time per week when talking altogether as a family was the primary activity. (The 1981 baseline was already low.) Overall, children in 1997 averaged about 45 minutes per week in conversation with anyone in the family, when the conversation was the primary activity.\n\nFamily mealtime: Declined by nearly an hour per week from 1981 to 1997, from about nine hours per week to about eight hours per week.\n\nFamily dinners: A 33% decrease over three decades in families who say they have dinner regularly. (This finding is from repeated annual surveys of American families.[iv] In a 1995 national poll, only one-third of U.S. families said they “usually have their evening meal together on a daily basis.”)[v]\n\nVacations: A 28% decrease over the past twenty years in the number of families taking a vacation (from annual surveys of American families).[vi]\n\nReligious participation: A decline of 40% in hours per week in children’s (ages three to twelve) religious participation time from 1981 to 1997[vii]; and a decline of 24% of high school students with weekly religious attendance (from 40% in 1981 to 31% in 1997, based on annual surveys of high school students).[viii]\n\nA major increase from 1981 to 1997 in children’s time spent on:\n\nStructured sports: Doubled from 2 hours and 20 minutes per week to 5 hours and 17 minutes per week. Boys and girls increased equally in structured sports time, but boys still spent twice as much time as girls in sports.\n\nPassive, spectator leisure (not counting television or other forms of “screen time”): A fivefold increase from a half hour per week to over three hours per week. This includes watching siblings play structured sports.\n\nStudying: Increased by almost 50% from 1981 to 1997.\n\nThe same research also highlighted the value of family time in raising well-adjusted children, which is shown below:\n\nMealtime: More mealtimes at home was the single strongest predictor of better achievement scores and fewer behavioural problems. Regular mealtimes were far more powerful than time spent in school or studying, at church, playing sports, and doing art activities. Results were statistically controlled for age and gender of child, race and ethnicity, education and age of the head of the family, family structure and employment, income, and family size.[ix]\n\nRegular family dinners and teen adjustment: The largest ever federally funded study of American teenagers found a strong association between regular family meals (five or more dinners per week with a parent) and academic success and psychological adjustment, as well as lower rates of alcohol use, drug use, early sexual behaviour, and suicidal risk. (After controlling for social class factors, results held for both one parent and two parent families.)[x]\n\nTeens’ concerns: In a national YMCA poll of a representative sample of American teens in 2000, 21% rated “not having enough time together with parents” as one of their top two concerns. (The other was “educational worries”.)[xi]\n\nRR8.3: Game Activities Trump Flashcards\n\nThis section provides positive findings on the effects that game activities and time dedicated to play has on a child’s skills and mental abilities.\n\nResearchers at Oregon State University have found that, rather than focusing on things like tuition classes, flashcards and math drills, playing typical childhood playground games may be the best way to help kids do better in school. A New York Times article, entitled “Simon Says Don’t Uses Flashcards”, states, “Variations on games like Freeze Tag and Simon Says require relatively high levels of executive function, testing a child’s ability to pay attention, remember rules, and exhibit self-control—qualities that also predict academic success.” Megan McClelland, who has led much of the research, says, “Play is one of the most cognitively stimulating things a child can do.” One study of 814 children between three and six showed that “children who do well in Simon Says-like games do better in math and reading. A smaller study of 65 preschool children found that those who started the school year with low levels of self-control showed improvement after playing games in class, including a version of Red Light, Green Light.” What makes the Oregon State study so exciting is that it was a longitudinal study that followed 430 subjects from preschool to the age of 25. “It turns out that a child’s ability at age 4 to pay attention and complete a task, the very skills learned in game play, were the greatest predictors of whether he or she finished college by age 25.”[xii]\n\nRR8.4: Don’t Hurry Your Child\n\nThis section provides research on the demoralising effects when a child is demanded to meet a higher standard of understanding than they are capable of.\n\nElkind frequently speaks up about how parents today are hurrying children to grow up too fast. One of the obvious ways is by making them plunge into the learning of mathematics and advanced reading that is not appropriate for their age. In The Hurried Child he states:\n\nAdvanced reading, like advanced number understanding, is quite different from beginners reading, although again our language provides no markers of the difference. We talk about children reading or not reading as if children either read or do not read. But there are many different levels of reading attainment. The young child who has memorized all of the words in a book has learned to sight read, but like learning the numbers two and three sight reading is a much easier mental activity than decoding new words using syntactic structure to infer meaning. That level of reading does not usually emerge until the age of six or seven. These levels of competence are often ignored when children are hurried…Mastering the basic skills means acquiring an enormous number of rules and learning to apply them appropriately. Hurrying children academically, therefore, ignores the enormity of the task that children face in acquiring basic math and reading skills. We need to appreciate how awesome an intellectual task learning the basics really is for children and give them the time they need to accomplish it well.[xiii]\n\n[i] Menehan, K. (2006).

Study results indicated that parental autonomy support and emotion-related self-regulation are both promotive factors for developing positive and academic competencies. Researchers proposed that the traditional Chinese values of guǎn (管), or safeguarding, and jiào xun (教訓), or demandingness of excellence, represent parental strictness-supervision, which when counterbalanced by autonomy support, could be considered the yin and yang in parenting that promotes adolescents’ academic success without harming their social-emotional or psychological well-being.[i]\n\nA four-phase study of Hong Kong Chinese adolescent-parent relationships (906 adolescents and 1,091 parents) revealed the following: (a) Adolescents and their parents differ in their perceptions of parenting style. (b) Autonomy is negatively associated with parents ‘perceived’ authoritative parenting style and school achievement. (c) Neither parenting style nor measures of parents’ beliefs in training their children[ii] are associated with self-reports of school achievement. However, (d) parents of students from the highest (Band 1) academically oriented schools in Hong Kong rated themselves as higher in healthier authoritative parenting styles and lower in unhealthy authoritarian styles than parents of adolescents from the lowest academically oriented (Band 5) schools.[iii]\n\n[i] Liew, J., Kwok, O., Chang, Y.-p., Chang, B.

And 20-30% of non-resident fathers have not seen their children in over a year.[ii] In the wake of divorce, it is common for the “leaving parent”—the one not getting basic custody, usually the father—to promise the children that he will always be there for them and will maintain a close relationship with them. Unfortunately, this promise is frequently not kept. Because of inconveniences arising from the divorce, and for other reasons, fathers often find it challenging to see their children. It should not come as a surprise then that many good intentions fall through on the part of both of the parents after the divorce. Generally speaking, the bond, especially between fathers and their children, deteriorates after a divorce.[iii]\n\nChildren in single-parent families receive about nine hours less from their mother per week than children from families where the parents were still married and living together.[iv]\n\nWhile no one sets out to get divorced, perhaps if parents knew the dire consequences of the alternative, they might take better care of their marriage!\n\nChildren learn from example, and imitate their parental role models more than parents realise. The lives of the parents provide a blueprint of how the children will probably lead their lives later on. Statistics show that the quality of the parents’ marriage affects the quality of the children’s relationships when they end up getting married. Our actions have consequences, the effects of which are felt in more than one generation.[v]\n\nSingle mothers are twice as likely as two-parent families to live in poverty.[vi]\n\nSingle mothers are also eight times as likely to be without jobs and twelve times as likely to be on some form of government support.[vii]\n\nDivorce causes the level of income for a middle-income family to decrease by 50%.[viii]\n\nSingle parents are also twice as likely to not have any savings.[ix]\n\nChildren in single-parent homes are 80% more likely to have health problems, such as pains, headaches, stomach symptoms, etc., than children from two-parent homes, even after taking into account economic hardship.[x]\n\nDivorce causes children to have more emotional distress and increases the risk of mental illness.[xi] These symptoms do not disappear quickly. They linger on, in some cases for years.\n\nChildren who live in a house with a stepfather, or a mother’s boyfriend, are more likely to be abused than those living with their father or with a mother only.[xii]\n\nLiving with a step-parent has turned out to be the most powerful predictor of severe child abuse yet.[xiii]\n\nYoung people are five times more likely to experience abuse if they grow up in a single home than if they grow up with parents whose marriages are still intact, according to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).[xiv]\n\nThe overwhelming evidence points conclusively to the fact that the state of marriages affects parenting, and has huge ramifications on children’s relationships with their parents, economic well-being, physical and psychological health, protection from domestic violence, and the likelihood that these children in turn will stay together later on in their marriages.\n\n[i] Louis, J.

It covered a whole array of media such as TV, computers, video games, music, print, cell phones and movies. We extracted some of their frightening findings:[i]\n\nFor purposes of comparison, young people were grouped into categories of heavy, moderate and light media users. Heavy users are those who consume more than 16 hours of media content in a typical day (21% of children from eight to eighteen); moderate users are those who consume from 3–16 hours of content (63%); light users are those who consume less than three hours of media in a typical day (17%).\n\nNearly half (47%) of all heavy media users say they usually get fair or poor grades (mostly C’s or lower), compared to 23% of light media users. Heavy media users are also more likely to say they get into trouble a lot, are often sad or unhappy, and say they are bored. Moreover, the relationships between media exposure and grades, and between media exposure and personal contentment, withstood controls for other possibly relevant factors such as age, gender, race, parent education, and single vs. two-parent households. This study could not establish whether there is a cause and effect relationship between media use and grades, or between media use and personal contentment. If there are such relationships, they could well run in both directions simultaneously.\n\nChildren who live in homes that limit media opportunities spend less time with media. For example, children whose parents do not put a TV in their bedroom, do not leave the TV on during meals or in the background when no one is watching, and do impose media-related rules spend substantially less time with media than do those who are not limited in the choices they make about screen time.\n\nOver the past five years, young people have increased the amount of time they spend consuming media by an hour and seventeen minutes daily, from an already worrying six hours and twenty-one minutes to a staggering seven hours and thirty-eight minutes! Considering that young people use media seven days a week instead of five, this means that they are spending 54 hours a week on media, more time than most adults spend at work!\n\nJust under half (45%) of all eight to eighteen-year-olds say they live in a home where the TV is left on most of the time, whether anyone is watching or not, and 64% say the TV is usually on in their household during meals. The percentage of young people reporting a TV on most of the time and a TV usually on during meals has remained relatively constant over the last decade.\n\nIn a typical day, 46% of eight to eighteen-year-olds report sending text messages on a cell phone. Those who do text estimate that they send an average of 118 messages in a typical day. On average, 7th–12th graders report spending about an hour and a half engaged in sending and receiving texts.\n\nThe gender difference in computer time only begins to appear in the teenage years. Boys and girls start out spending equal amounts of time on a computer, but a disparity develops over time. Among fifteen to eighteen-year-olds, there is a gap of about 40 minutes between the genders (two hours for boys, and roughly an hour and twenty minutes for girls). One clear reason for the disparity in this age group is that girls lose interest in computer games as they enter their teenage years, while boys do not. Girls go from an average of 12 minutes a day playing computer games when they are in the eight to ten-year-old group, to just three minutes a day by the time they are fifteen to eighteen years old; there is no such decrease among boys.\n\nOnly a relatively small proportion of eight to eighteen-year-olds say they have any rules about music listening: 26% say they have rules about what types of music they are allowed to listen to, and 10% say they have rules about how much time they can spend listening to music. The proportion with rules about which music they can listen to decreases substantially by age, going from nearly half (47%) of all eight to ten-year-olds to 27% of eleven to fourteen-year-olds to just 12% of all fifteen to eighteen-year-olds.\n\nAnother noteworthy study was conducted in Singapore, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2009), which found the strongest factor associated with early teenage sexual intercourse for male adolescents was viewing pornography between 14 and 19 years of age. This finding agreed with another study conducted in Sweden with boys between 17-21 years of age. In addition, of the boys who viewed pornography, 59% used computers, 19% used videos, and 14% made use of mobile phones.[ii]\n\nDangers of Excessive Media Exposure\n\nFrom a number of national (US-based) surveys, we found the following:\n\nParent Further, a search institute resource for families, warns of excessive computer and other media exposure.[iii] According to one study, nearly 1 in 10 young gamers displayed behavior patterns similar to addiction.[iv] According to A.C. Nielsen, the average American watches more than four hours of TV each day (or 28 hours per week, or two months of nonstop TV-watching per year). In a 65-year life, that person will have spent nine years glued to the tube.[v]\n\nBelow are some statistics compiled by TV-Free America:\n\nThe number of murders seen on TV by the time an average child finishes elementary school: 8,000\n\nThe number of violent acts seen on TV by age 18: 200,000\n\nThe percentage of Americans who believe TV violence helps precipitate real life mayhem: 79%\n\nIn his book, Take Back Your Kids, William Doherty wrote:\n\nDuring the 7-8pm time slot (once defined as family hour), 80% of television shows use four letter words, and 60% refer to sex.[vi] During all the prime time slots, 74% of all TV shows contain sexual content.[vii] Children are exposed to an estimated 10,000 food advertisements per year, mostly on TV.[viii]\n\nMedia Awareness Network, has this to say about the effects of Media on children:[ix]\n\nRowell Huesmann reviewed studies conducted in Australia, Finland, Poland, Israel, Netherlands and the United States. He reports, “The child most likely to be aggressive would be the one who (a) watches violent television programs most of the time, (b) believes that these shows portray life just as it is, [and] (c) identifies strongly with the aggressive characters in the shows.”[x]\n\nA study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2003 found that nearly half (47%) of parents with children between the ages of four and six report that their children have imitated aggressive behaviors from TV. However, it is interesting to note that children are more likely to mimic positive behaviors—87% of kids do so.[xi]\n\nRecent research is exploring the effect of new media on children’s behavior. Craig Anderson and Brad Bushman of Iowa State University reviewed dozens of studies of video gamers. In 2001, they reported that children and young people who play violent video games, even for short periods, are more likely to behave aggressively in the real world; and that both aggressive and non-aggressive children are negatively affected by playing.[xii]\n\nIn 2003, two Iowa State University researchers teamed up with the Texas Department of Human Services and reported that violent music lyrics increased aggressive thoughts and hostile feelings among 500 college students. They concluded, “There are now good theoretical and empirical reasons to expect effects of music lyrics on aggressive behavior to be similar to the well-studied effects of exposure to TV and movie violence and the more recent research efforts on violent video games.”[xiii]\n\nColumbia University professor Jeffrey Johnson has found that the effect is not limited to children who grew up watching violent shows. Johnson tracked 707 families in upstate New York for 17 years, starting in 1975. In 2002, he reported that children who watched one to three hours of any kind of television each day when they were 14 to 16 years old were 60% more likely to be involved in assaults and fights as adults than those who watched less TV.[xiv]\n\nResearchers have also pursued the link between media violence and real life aggression by examining communities before and after the introduction of television. In the mid-1970s, University of British Columbia professor Tannis McBeth Williams studied a remote village in British Columbia both before and after television was introduced. She found that two years after TV arrived, violent incidents had increased by 160%.[xv]\n\nUniversity of Washington Professor Brandon Centerwall noted that the sharp increase in the murder rate in North America in 1955 occurred eight years after television sets began to enter North American homes. To test his hypothesis that the two were related, he examined the murder rate in South Africa where, prior to 1975, television was banned by the government. He found that twelve years after the ban was lifted, murder rates skyrocketed.\n\nIn 1998, Professors Singer, Slovak, Frierson and York surveyed 2,000 Ohio students in grades three through eight. They report that the incidences of psychological trauma (including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress) increased in proportion to the number of hours of television watched each day.[xvi]\n\nA number of studies in the 1970’s showed that people who are repeatedly exposed to media violence tend to be less disturbed when they witness real world violence, and have less sympathy for its victims. For example, Professors V.B. Cline, R.G. Croft, and S. Courrier studied young boys over a two-year period. In 1973, they reported that boys who watch more than 25 hours of television per week are significantly less likely to be aroused by real world violence than those boys who watch four hours or less per week.[xvii]\n\nThe late George Gerbner conducted the longest running study of television violence that we know of. His seminal research found that frequent TV viewers tend to perceive the world in ways that are consistent with the images on TV. As viewers’ perceptions of the world come to conform with the depictions they see on TV, they become more passive, more anxious, and more fearful. Gerbner calls this the “Mean World Syndrome.” Gerbner’s research, published in 1994, found that those who watch greater amounts of television are more likely to overestimate their risk of being victimized by crime; believe their neighborhoods are unsafe; believe “fear of crime is a very serious personal problem”; and assume the crime rate is increasing, even when it is not.[xviii]\n\n[i] Rideout, V.

However, who or what do parents blame when their children underachieve? Usually the school, teachers, lack of tutors, and large class sizes. While these are important factors, parents should also look closer to home—perhaps they failed to teach their children to make wise choices, to sacrifice short-term pleasures for long-term gains, and to pay attention to rules and remember instructions.\n\nRR15.2: Research Outcomes from Studies on Resilience\n\nThis section provides research on how to further provide support for a child’s development of resilience.\n\nResearch shows that resilience in children is a result of a number of factors within and outside families. As far as parenting is concerned, factors clearly associated with resilience include providing enough protection (without being overprotective, which can backfire), being good role models, maintaining family rules and regulations, and helping children regulate their arousal and emotions.[ii]\n\nIn a large study of over 1,400 female twins assessed for severe childhood sexual abuse, parental warmth was associated with increased resilience.[iii]\n\nA study of over 900 African American adults showed that positive factors in childhood family environment are positively associated with higher levels of resilience, coping, and positive affect in adulthood, after controlling for childhood maltreatment, other trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder.[iv]\n\nA survey of 2063 individuals measured resilience and work outcomes in the following areas: stress, burnout, sleep problems, likelihood of depression, job satisfaction, intent to quit, absences, and productivity. Resilience had an independent, favourable association with all eight outcomes in this study.[v]\n\n[i] Duckworth, A. L., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2005).

The Wall Street Journal, on January 18, 2011, reported the following:[i]\n\nAccording to America’s National Sleep Foundation’s 2004 “Sleep in America poll” of 1,473 adults with children aged 10 and younger in the home, 13% of school-age children had difficulty falling asleep at bedtime and 26% of pre-schoolers seemed sleepy or overtired during the day, at least a few days a week. About 45% of adolescents aged 11 to 17 got less than eight hours of sleep a night.\n\nA 2010 study of 392 boys and girls in the US, published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, showed that those who had trouble sleeping at 12 to 14 years old were more than twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts at ages 15 to 17 as those who didn’t have sleep problems at the younger age.\n\nAnother study in the US of 1,037 children revealed that 46% of those who were considered to have a persistent sleep difficulty at age nine had an anxiety disorder at age 21 or 26. By comparison, of the children who didn’t have sleep problems at age 9, 33% had an anxiety disorder as young adults. This study was published in 2005 in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology.\n\nIn yet another study, published in 2010 by Science Translational Medicine, neurologists at Harvard Medical School highlighted that staying awake for 24 hours in a row is on par with legal intoxication with alcohol (in driving) in impairing performance. Sleeping only six hours per night for two weeks causes a similar level of impairment as staying awake for 24 hours.[ii]\n\nIn findings that strike close to home, The Straits Times of Singapore reported in the April 20, 2012 issue that Singaporean children get an average of two hours less sleep than their peers in Switzerland. Paediatricians from Singapore’s National University Hospital studied 372 children aged two to six. The doctors were disturbed to find that the children’s parents thought that their children’s sleep patterns were fine. One of the professors said, “My personal experience is that many children and teenagers (in Singapore) are quite sleep-deprived. They see me in the clinic for headaches, dizziness and poor attention in class.” He also said that after the children took his advice to get more sleep, many of their physical problems improved, and some of the children and teens showed “markedly improved academic ability.”[iii]\n\nRR18.2: Heavy Backpacks Cause Lasting Damage\n\nThis section details research on the damage inflicted on students who consistently carry heavy backpacks.\n\nThe Italian Backpack Study done in 1999 found that the average load students carried amounted to 22% of their body weight, thus exceeding the recommended 15%. They also found that 34.8% of students carried more than 30% of their normal body weight at least once during the week.[iv]\n\nResearchers in Hong Kong studied students’ lung volume. Scientists found that the average weight of school students’ backpacks was equivalent to 15% of their body weight. However, in the case of those who were carrying up to 20% of their body weight, their lung volume was significantly compromised.[v]\n\nAnother study compared the backpack weight of students in India with their counterparts in Houston, Texas. Almost 60% of students aged nine to 20 years old from both countries suffered from chronic back pain! And the percentage of students with back pain who carried backpack loads that constituted only 15% of their body weight regularly was drastically lower.[vi]\n\nRR18.3: Myopia Linked with Lack of Outdoor Light\n\nThis section outlines research that corelates the condition of myopia and the lack of outdoor activity.\n\nA study published in The Lancet in May 2012 revealed that myopia has emerged as a major health issue in parts of Asia, affecting 80–90% of graduating school children compared to 10–20% of those completing secondary schooling in other parts of the world: “The higher prevalence of myopia in east Asian cities seems to be associated with increasing educational pressures, combined with lifestyle changes, which have reduced the time children spend outside.”[vii]\n\nA BBC report also confirmed the findings of this research study: “According to the research, the problem is being caused by a combination of factors—a commitment to education and lack of outdoor light.”[viii] The researchers said children who spend two to three hours outdoors a day are “probably reasonably safe” from getting myopia. This could include time spent on the playground and walking to and from school.[ix]\n\n[i] Petersen, A. (2011, January 18). How much sleep do children and teenagers need?
