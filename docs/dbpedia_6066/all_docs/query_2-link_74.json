        "text": "Mothers experience challenges in life just like everyone else, and sometimes those challenges include living with symptoms of a personality disorder.\n\nNot everyone with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) experiences the same symptoms or symptoms with the same intensity. The same goes for a mother who may live with this condition.\n\nSome mothers may live with covert narcissism, for example, which may make narcissistic traits more difficult to identify.\n\nWhen you learn about some of the signs of covert narcissism, you may think that someone has a narcissistic personality, particularly if you’ve known them well for a long time. However, only a mental health professional can accurately diagnose the personality disorder.\n\nDetermining whether some of your mother’s behaviors point to symptoms of narcissism may be challenging if you don’t have professional training.\n\nKeep in mind that some of the signs you’ll learn here could be explained by other conditions or personal challenges.\n\nIn every case, NPD isn’t a personal choice. Most people with narcissistic personalities have diminished self-awareness and don’t realize that they live with the condition.\n\nIdentifying the signs of a narcissistic mother may not be as straightforward, especially if she lives with covert narcissism.\n\nThere are many ways someone may express the formal symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder or narcissistic traits. Everyone still has their own personality and individuality.\n\nBehaviors can also change based on a child’s age, cultural background, personal circumstances, and other external and internal factors.\n\nIn general, a narcissistic mother may have a hard time identifying or connecting to the needs of a young child, for example. They may tend to use manipulation or guilt-based tactics with older children or adults. They could also play the victim in some situations.\n\nHere are some indicators of a possible covert narcissistic mother:\n\nGuilt-tripping\n\nAccording to Sterlin Mosley, CEO of Empathy Architects and professional in human relations at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma, covert narcissistic mothers may use guilt trips with their children through the appearance of neediness.\n\n“They may appear emotionally bereft, overlooked, under-appreciated, overworked, or participate in martyring behaviors,” he says. “Some narcissistic mothers may try to top their children’s problems, and tend to evoke feelings of guilt in children who feel unsafe sharing their concerns or issues.”\n\nBlaming\n\nMothers living with covert narcissism may tend to shift blame. This means that they might have a hard time being accountable for their actions and emotions and put that responsibility on the child.\n\nFor example, they may say that they’re having a bad day because their child woke up late, or they may justify their outburst by saying it was caused by something the child did or said.\n\nSilvi Saxena, a clinical social worker in Philadelphia, explains that this type of blame-shifting can often result from the mother’s need to avoid being judged negatively by her social circle.\n\nMinimizing needs\n\nIf your mother lives with covert narcissism, you may feel like she persistently prioritizes her needs over yours.\n\nThis behavior can appear in many ways, particularly during early childhood. This may be, in part, due to the low ability to experience and express empathy that many people with NPD have.\n\nThis may lead them to not be aware of the child’s needs or not realize how their actions affect the little one. They may, for example, ignore a crying child or overlook their academic needs.\n\nNot every narcissistic mother will act this way, though. And in some instances, they may even act the opposite way in an attempt to show high status through their children.\n\nBeing excessively helpful\n\n“Covert narcissists, particularly those who are identified with being ‘nice’ or ‘good,’ can also appear gracious, kind, empathetic, or even generous,” explains Mosley.\n\nThat generosity and willingness to help, however, may sometimes be motivated by a need for praise and admiration. They may want to be portrayed as “perfect mothers” or admired for their many sacrifices and efforts.\n\n“Typically, underneath the image, they are seething with rage that people are not admiring them sufficiently,” he adds.\n\nCompeting attitudes\n\nIn some cases, mothers with covert narcissism may compete with their children. This could take many forms.\n\nFor example, they may always have a “bigger” problem or accomplishment than the one you’re talking about, or they may act in certain ways in public to redirect attention from you to them.\n\nHolding high expectations\n\nSometimes, covert narcissistic mothers may see you as an extension of themselves. In this case, your behaviors are a reflection of their own.\n\nBecause of this, they may hold extremely high standards that lead you to be perceived as successful, smart, beautiful, or special in some way. They might often take the credit for these accomplishments.\n\nSimilarly, if you face challenges, a narcissistic mother may seem intensely upset and excessively critical out of worry that you may shed a negative light on them."
