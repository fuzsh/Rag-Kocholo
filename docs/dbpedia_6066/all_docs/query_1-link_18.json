        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\n“Shame is a soul eating emotion” said Carl Jung. But isn’t it time for you to allow your self to stop reacting and start creating, for your sake? In this epic article I give you the definitive guide on shame, how to heal from it, and how you can harness that inner nuclear reactor for limitless creativity. You know, the dark power that got you to where you are that you are perhaps a little afraid of? It’s time to doubt your doubts and believe you are limitless. I will tell you how…\n\n“Soul, if you want to learn secrets,\n\nyour heart must forget about\n\nshame and dignity.\n\nYou are God’s lover,\n\nyet you worry\n\nwhat people\n\nare saying.”\n\n― Rumi\n\nRumi nails it yet again: Shame drives us to seek external validation and a state of emotional insobriety, the true source of our unhappiness, where our happiness is dependent on people, events, and things. Not the PET you always wanted, if you pardon the acronym. As Aristotle wrote “Happiness depends upon ourselves.”\n\nThe key is to find our true self and to love our selves (why the plural? — more on that later when we come to our adult self, our inner child, and inner critic who all reside within), and then from this place of serenity to help others. The Dalai Lama XIV said “Only the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.”\n\nShame is the birthplace of fear and pain; Trauma is the infancy of shame; Egocentric fear is the childhood of anxiety, depression and addiction; Shame is the adolescence of seeking external validation; External validation is the adulthood of unhappiness; Yet it is your birthright to love your self; Your birthright is wellbeing.\n\nThe scene for your life is set from a preverbal age. Shame is a response to trauma. More on this to follow.\n\nIt is in your hands to be happy, you just don’t know it yet. Ralph Waldo Emerson said “Most of the shadows in life are caused by standing in our own sunshine.” The default, innate, nature of all human beings is wellbeing. We are all born fundamentally connected to each other and to something supremely benevolent that powers all of life, a universal force. We arrive in this world perfectly healthy, full of the clarity and peace of mind we so often chase as adults, who were raised without unconditional love. So how did we stray off the path, and how can we return to it? Even as we grow up and feel like the connection has faded, it hasn’t. Because, essentially, it’s who we are, it can’t fade. Taking our own idle thinking at face value is the primary cause of all suffering. It’s so simple. We are all well. All is well. Always. There are no exceptions, caveats, conditions, or logical rules to remember, but we sometimes need a little reminding. That’s what this article is for. That’s my purpose. That’s why I had to break down, to break through, for you, to remind you of this. The way out is through. Follow me, I will be your guide, side by side, every step of the way.\n\nI have studied philosophy, positive psychology, medicine, spirituality, timeless truths, transformation, and spent the last two and a half years living all this, combined with my lived experience, in order unite all the concepts I have learned and provide clarity, so that I can guide you to find your purpose, lose your shame, ditch your inner critic, free your mind from your negative inner voice and thoughts, and ultimately to find bliss in this life. This will enthuse you to do the same for others. Touch one soul at a time.\n\nConfucius encapsulates it perfectly “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one.” Perhaps together we can save the world, one day at a time, and bring it back from the crisis that we appear to be in right now. I am not saying anything new that hasn’t been said since around 500BC when Siddhartha became enlightened as the Buddha and “The Bhagavad Gita” was written, at around the same time, via the Stoics, right through to modern day philosophers, psychologists, coaches, spiritual leaders, and those devoted to personal growth and transformation. What I have realised is that they all have the same message, and that the boundaries between the different disciplines are simply different ways of viewing the same concepts. For example Carl Jung was a philosopher, a psychologist, and a spiritual leader. They are all the same thing when they get close to the truth. So let’s get clarity on these timeless truths. You can’t argue with natural law: Scientists can bend the laws of physics, but no-one can break the natural laws, such as karma. We are all just voices, echoing these same truths for the current generation. For example Buddha said “Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.” Eckhart Tolle echoed “Realise deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary focus of your life.” There is nothing new to discover. Just clarity and simplicity. All is well, right now, in the present moment, as you read this, and just breathe. What’s so wonderful is that you are beginning to listen. You have stepped onto the right path. The possibilities are limitless…\n\nAre you sceptical? I am not surprised. I would have been too. If you are noticing that in this very moment you are most certainly not in touch with your innate wellbeing, I hear you. I really hear you. I see you. You are so forgivable. You are so worthy. Let me bring you home. Let me guide you to find your way home. If stress and mental chaos were home they would feel like home, right? Struggle and mental business go against your nature and that’s why you struggle to fix them. That’s why you strive to return home, to the wellness into which you were born. That is home. Home is inside you. You just need a little light to find your way back. Thats why I am here, and why I wrote this article for you.\n\nThose moments of supreme peace that you sometimes experience (maybe in nature, maybe when deeply connecting with those that you love, or when your life and purpose momentarily align) are who you naturally are. When you’re experiencing anything else, you’re simply in a fog of thought. Nothing can change your basic nature. Not age, culture, conditioning, abuse, a horrific childhood, unfit parents, anxiety, depression, fear, worry, obsession, or shame. Your innate wellbeing and serenity is always right there, only sometimes masked by mental chit-chat. So, quiet the mind, open the heart, and read on.\n\nShame is universal. Everyone battles with shame, which is extremely beneficial since we isolate ourselves so much when we believe it’s only us. Carl Rogers famously said: “The things that we feel most separate us from one another are actually the ones that we have most in common.”\n\nDr. Gabor Maté says “Shame is the deepest of the negative emotions, a feeling we will do anything to avoid. Unfortunately, our abiding fear of shame impairs our ability to see reality.” We feel shame because we are human, not because we are bad: Among the millions of animal species on the globe, our ability for shame is unique. Chimpanzees and bonobos, do sense some minor forms of guilt, embarrassment, and a desire to make amends, but nothing like humans. Shame pretends to serve as a cautionary signal: Shame is a warning from the brain that we might be rejected or cut off from the social group. Dale Carnegie said “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” Shame is the brain’s way of dealing with the threat of disconnection. The solution, then, is first of all to reconnect with our self, to remove the threat of the ‘Invisible Lion’ (we have an appropriate response to threat, but it is to a threat that no longer exists — hence the invisible lion), and from that place to reconnect with others with compassion. Its time to doubt your doubts and trust your intuition, with a little help from what has been written about shame. There are many elements and solutions to recovering from shame, not just compassion, which is oft-touted as the sole antidote. How can all these concepts be connected? Well, as Dr. Gabor Maté says, “Trauma is what you suffer alone.” Food for thought. Are you ready for clarity on shame? Let’s dive in and elucidate then….\n\nWhat is shame?\n\nShame haunts our soul and whispers in our ear at night saying “What if you are not enough?” Every day your shame voices are trying to convince you that you are less than human. Shame is the negative bias in our head that is meant to keep us alive by encouraging connection — be better and you will be loved. It relentlessly drives us to seek success to prove the inner voice, that forever present inner critic, wrong: But no-one told shame about the tall poppy syndrome.\n\nBrené Brown wrote in The Gifts of Imperfection “Shame works like the zoom lens on a camera. When we are feeling shame, the camera is zoomed in tight and all we see is our flawed selves, alone and struggling.” It is human nature to see our strengths minimised as if we were gazing the wrong way through a telescope, and our weaknesses magnified with the telescope the other way round.\n\nLeigh Bardugo wrote “We can endure all kinds of pain. It’s shame that eats men whole.” I am not being dramatic: I know. Brené Brown says “Shame is the deep and abiding belief or experience that I am flawed and defective and therefore unworthy of love or belonging… Shame is an epidemic in our culture.” You are not alone. Troy Love adds “Shame is anger turned inwards.” But anger against whom — your self? Yes, and the terrible consequence of this is that “Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change” (Brené Brown, I Thought It Was Just Me: Women Reclaiming Power and Courage in a Culture of Shame). It’s no surprise that with all this self-hatred that self-compassion has been widely described as the antidote to shame. Responding with compassion to our mistakes is a good place to start countering shame. Brené Brown says “If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment. If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can’t survive.” Empathy and compassion are very different. They are represented in different areas of the brain. With empathy, we share in the pain of others, but we don’t go so far as to genuinely help them. Compassion allows us to step back from the emotion of empathy and ask, “How can we help?” True compassion for others begins with genuine compassion for oneself. It’s impossible to aide people achieve their equilibrium if you’re overwhelmed and out of balance yourself. Getting enough sleep and taking pauses during the day are examples of self-compassion. So are mindfulness, meditation, yoga, eating healthily, all forms of self care, and keeping our life in balance, without overemphasis on any one part such as work. Self-compassion requires letting go of excessive self-criticism. We need to berating ourselves for what we could have done better or differently. Instead, we need to cultivate positive self-talk. After that, we need to reframe failures as a learning opportunity. FAIL means First Attempt In Learning (please pardon the acronyms — being a medical doctor I am rather fond of them!). Compassion is not the only antidote to shame — love and connection, amongst other approaches and concepts, are also important in recovery. Craig Thompson said “Shame is always easier to handle if you have someone to share it with.” This is why 12 step recovery groups have the aphorism ”The Fellowship loves you until you love your self.” Then you can love the people who matter deeply to you in your life. There are many more factors that may also help, and I will delineate these in this article, from personal experience and from a thorough literature review. I don’t think I have missed anything and please forgive me for the length of this article — its such an important topics in our mental wellbeing! I will publish much more bitesized, hopefully tasty, morsels soon. Let’s be inspired by philosophers, psychologists, and speakers on timeless truths. You will find that the message is pretty unified: Uniquely by those thinkers who have recovered from trauma and shame, and have lived to tell their story and to create.\n\nDr. Christopher Germer, psychologist, says “People come into therapy. They often feel defective. Shame is the glue or the stickiness that makes difficult emotions persist. Shame is an attack on the self, a core belief that I am not good enough in some way. That’s shame.” Shame has been referred to as “The swampland of the soul” by certain Jungian analysts. They’re alluding to the way we can get caught into and entrenched in our shame stories, which are often painful and untrue. We can begin to embrace our authentic selves and halt the shame spiral by digging into the mud and casting light on toxic shame and its origins. More on this below, but suffice it to say that shame is secondary to childhood trauma and abuse. This may be due to an unvalidated childhood, where there is an absence of unconditional love, or emotional deprivation, as well as other forms of abuse. Laura Davis wrote “Abuse manipulates and twists a child’s natural sense of trust and love. Her innocent feelings are belittled or mocked and she learns to ignore her feelings. She can’t afford to feel the full range of feelings in her body while she’s being abused — pain, outrage, hate, vengeance, confusion, arousal. So she short-circuits them and goes numb. For many children, any expression of feelings, even a single tear, is cause for more severe abuse. Again, the only recourse is to shut down. Feelings go underground.” Such children create a false self in an attempt to be accepted, so there is a rupture of the self. Imagine the younger version of you being literally fractured into different parts. That resonated with me. John Bradshaw, counsellor and personal growth author, wrote in his brilliant book Healing The Shame That Binds You “The agony of this chronic stage of being cannot be endured for long. At the deepest level, toxic shame triggers our basic automatic defensive cover-ups. Freud called these automatic cover-ups our primary ego defences. Once these defences are in place they function automatically and unconsciously, sending our true and authentic selves into hiding. We develop a false identity out of this basic core. We become master impersonators. We avoid our core agony and pain and over a period of years, we avoid our avoidance.” He continued “Children are natural Zen masters; their world is brand new in each and every moment.” John Bradshaw, like all best authors, writes from the heart, personal lived experience, vast expertise, and is a modern day philosopher. It takes a lot to overcome these Zen masters with a totally unvalidated childhood, but it is truly an epidemic of our disconnected times. Toxic shame is a fundamental belief that “I am bad. I am broken. I need to hide my authentic self from the world.” You may have heard about the negative effects of toxic shame from speakers like Brené Brown in her numerous Ted Talks and YouTube videos on the subject, but recognising when toxic shame enters our lives today and undermines our relationships, particularly with ourselves, can be difficult: Shame hides from the light. Our task is to shine a light on it.\n\nShame is such a hot topic, with educators and mental health specialists warning us about the dangers of toxic shame to our health and well-being. However, recognising toxic shame and how it affects our lives and relationships, especially our relationship with ourselves, can be challenging. Let’s try to overcome this by defining the different types of shame.\n\nWhat is toxic shame?\n\nToxic shame is what people mean by shame. Toxic shame is a feeling that you’re worthless. It occurs when you are treated badly by others as a child, even if you don’t remember it, and you internalise that treatment as a core belief about yourself. When severe, it can form the lens through which all self-evaluation is viewed.\n\nToxic shame describes false, pathological shame, a paralysing global assessment of oneself as a person, and John Bradshaw states that toxic shame is induced, inside children, by all forms of child abuse. Toxic shame can develop as a result of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse as well as neglect as a child. When a parent abuses them, whether emotionally or physically, a child may feel both perplexed and outraged at first. When a child is ignored, a lack of parental availability and presence might be misinterpreted as “I’m not deserving of love and care.” Emotional deprivation is a form of abuse. This gives you an unvalidated childhood. Is it any surprise that the consequence is to seek validation outside of your self, and the primary cure is to give your self validation from within? Toxic shame often induces what is known as complex trauma in children who cannot cope with toxic shaming as it occurs and who dissociate the shame until it is possible to cope with. John Bradshaw wrote “Since the earliest period of our life was preverbal, everything depended on emotional interaction. Without someone to reflect our emotions, we had no way of knowing who we were.” Shame is a result of being taught repeatedly that we are something bad, not that we did something bad. As a result, it may make us resistant to receiving favourable feedback from others or oneself. When we are in toxic shame, we can lose empathy for ourselves and others. We look at ourselves as inherently bad and at others with scepticism and doubt. Toxic shame convinces you that you are the problem rather than evaluating your actions and others’ reactions to them. You believe and feel you are not enough and do not deserve to have true intimacy or connection because there is something wrong with your true nature that you must hide from others.\n\nTo have shame as an identity means that you feel defective as a human being: It becomes toxic and dehumanising and it’s literally unbearable, to the point of suicide. Shame creates a false self as you feel that your true self is defective and flawed. Once one becomes a false self one ceases to exist psychologically according to John Bradshaw. Once you stop being an authentic human being in this way you need recovery, not punishment. As we hear in Dr Gabor Maté’s truly incisive film, “The Wisdom of trauma”, most of the world’s prison inmates are victims of victims — people who were abused as children, whose parents were most likely abused too, and so it goes on. Can institutions really go on pretending to solve the world’s problems using methods that replicate the cause of those problems? How ethical is that? Institutions as abusers? Really? Have we learned nothing from the vast tomes and personal accounts that have been published on this subject? Toxic shame leads to depression, most other forms of mental illness, as well as syndromes of false self. The layers of secrecy and cover up from being in this false self are the source of all suffering for human beings. The recovery of the true self is central to the solution. Toxic shame is cunning, baffling, and powerful and leads to addiction. Dr Gabor Maté says “Addiction is not a choice that anybody makes; it’s not a moral failure. What it actually is: It’s a response to human suffering.”\n\nJohn Bradshaw said “Hell, in my opinion, is never finding your true self and never living your own life or knowing who you are. Our healthy shame is essential as the foundation of our spirituality. By reminding us of our essential limitations, our healthy shame lets us know that we are not God. Our healthy shame points us in the direction of some larger meaning. Our healthy shame is the psychological ground of our humility. To be shame-bound means that whenever you feel any feeling, need or drive, you immediately feel ashamed. The dynamic core of your human life is grounded in your feelings, needs and drives. When these are bound by shame, you are shamed to the core.”\n\nWhat is the difference between healthy shame (guilt) and toxic shame (shame)?\n\nShame is not an action emotion, guilt is. What do I mean by that? Guilt is an action emotion — you have done something against your values. Shame is not an action emotion — you haven’t done anything wrong — you feel wrong as a human being. The emotion has been internalised. You always feel short of the mark and not good enough. Healthy shame is when you know your limitations as a human being and that you need help: You can’t do this alone.\n\nHealthy shame or guilt guides toward self-correction, making amends, and growth. Toxic shame, on the other hand, is a fundamental belief that “I am bad. I am broken. I need to hide my authentic self from the world.” Toxic shame can be very harmful psychologically. It’s deeply absorbed in the nervous system (meaning, you truly feel it in your gut as discombobulation, and in your chest, maybe as a relentless pressure). Toxic shame is self-punishing and lingers on.\n\nHealthy shame is the same as guilt; it’s the sense that tells us we’ve failed or damaged someone in our relational field. We begin to develop a healthy sense of guilt around the age of 15–30 months. We learn that we have disappointed someone we care about and rely on to meet our needs when a parent or caregiver scolds us around this age. Healthy shame, unlike toxic shame, can offer advice, teach us boundaries and safety, and assist us in conforming to societal norms. Consider a parent scolding a youngster behaving badly in a public area, such as a supermarket or restaurant. The message “That behaviour is not acceptable here” teaches the child about the social environment’s standards. Healthy shame teaches us how to meet family and societal standards. Shame based people attract other shame-based people and produce shame-based children.\n\nHurt people hurt people;\n\ntraumatised people traumatise people;\n\nloved people love people;\n\nhealed people heal people;\n\ntransformed people transform people\n\nWhat is guilt?\n\nPeople sometimes confuse shame (we are really talking about toxic shame) with guilt, a related but different emotion. Guilt is the same as healthy shame according to Brené Brown. Guilt is a feeling you get when you did something wrong, or perceived you did something wrong. Toxic shame is a feeling that your whole self is wrong, and it may not be related to a specific behaviour or event. Our moral compass and behaviour are shaped by healthy shame or guilt. They instruct us on what is incorrect or inappropriate in interpersonal relationships. Shame or remorse can be early warning indications that we’re about to betray another person’s confidence. They inspire us to take a breath, rethink our behaviour, and decide not to hurt another person with our rage, harsh words, or deeds.\n\nGuilt reminds us that making mistakes is an inevitable part of life’s path. We are imperfectly perfect and ‘only human’ in our flaws! Making mistakes also provides us with the opportunity to learn. When we say or do something insensitive or cruel to someone we care about (or even a stranger), we learn this lesson throughout our lives . We’ve crossed a sacred line, a boundary, as evidenced by their reaction. A boundary is like the wall around your garden. It is there to protect you and your neighbours. Traumatised children have no boundaries. They don’t even know that they exist, even though they are referred to even in Netflix box sets! Our healthy sense of shame and guilt tells us that we need to mend our relationship with this individual, which usually entails making a sincere apology, as you would with a neighbour.\n\nWe are usually willing to accept one another’s faults and apologies since we are made for connection. Those that don’t accept an apology were most likely traumatised children themselves. Like us, they are ‘spiritually sick’. When you are spiritually sick you don’t know it. Harriet Lerner and Brené Brown explain what makes a sincere apology and why it’s helpful to deliver one, even if the other person isn’t able or ready to take it, in the Unlocking Us podcast episode I’m Sorry: How to Apologize & Why It Matters. Regardless of the outcome, making an apology is vital for our development.\n\nWe expect that no one is flawless because we have all committed mistakes and relational breaches, but that just because we make a major blunder does not indicate the relationship is over. It, on the other hand, provides us with the opportunity to learn.\n\nHow does toxic shame happen?\n\nAttacks by parents, peers or partners during childhood development and adulthood can contribute to toxic shame. If it’s hysterical it’s historical: Childhood trauma sets the scene. Adulthood trauma is traumatic usually because we experienced trauma as children. We often internalise harmful statements (“You are stupid”; “You are worthless”; “You are a loser”) about us, believing they define us as people, and negative events that speak deeply and loudly to us. They reverberate us to the core. Statements like the ones above, as well as acts like withholding love, ignoring, or persistent criticism, can pierce our sense of self like a tunnelling machine, leaving a void filled with toxic shame about who we are fundamentally our core. We internalise the negative messages about ourselves and our personality until they become part of our identity. This is toxic shame. The logical mind may be able to distinguish between truth and the bombardment of negative messages, but our emotional mind will often begin repeating these words like a mantra, every minute of the day. This is why we can’t defeat shame with cognition and logic, we need an emotional approach that includes self-compassion and self-love, as well as modalities such as mindfulness that help us deal with intrusive thoughts.\n\nWhat happens with toxic shame?\n\nIt might be difficult to form connected, attuned long-term relationships when a deep sense of toxic shame develops. You may expect that a partner or friend will abandon you once they discover who you truly are. You may even self-isolate, avoid or sabotage relationships, resulting in loneliness that only affirms the negative self-talk: “I don’t deserve love.”\n\nToxic shame can result in negative or difficult emotions, such as:\n\nAnger toward yourself or others\n\nSelf-loathing or self-pity\n\nAnxiety and fear\n\nDepression, suicidality\n\nOrson Scott Card wrote in Ender’s Shadow:\n\n“In my view, suicide is not really a wish for life to end.’\n\nWhat is it then?’\n\nIt is the only way a powerless person can find to make everybody else look away from his shame. The wish is not to die, but to hide.”\n\nIn my view, in the context of toxic shame, suicide is a conscious wish for a rebirth, a new beginning as your true authentic self, to begin to live again in line with your purpose.\n\nToxic shame can also promote perfectionism as a means of proving to yourself and others that you are deserving. Perfectionism is frequently an attempt to “outdo” bad traits in order to look ambitious, accomplished, and motivated to others. As a strategy to develop or portray your ideal self, perfectionism can lead to workaholism, where you relentlessly try prove your worth with your CV and accomplishments. This is the path to emptiness, being unfulfilled, lacking meaning, mental illness, burnout and self-sabotage.\n\nShame and psychological disorders\n\nDr Ron Siegel psychologist says “I think shame runs through all the (mental health) issues basically in two ways. First, a huge overlay on almost all of our psychological suffering is feeling ashamed about the suffering. Anxious people are afraid that others will dismiss them or not take them seriously because they’re anxious. Depressed people are afraid that they’re toxic and nobody will want to be their friend. People with substance disorders or addictions are very ashamed of these and expect that people will reject them for that. Couples who are fighting are ashamed of that. Even folks who are struggling with psychosis are ashamed of being crazy and don’t want to be seen as being crazy. The first level of it is whatever we’re suffering from, we’re probably multiplying our misery by feeling ashamed about suffering from it.\n\nThe other side of it is that virtually all disorders involve some kind of feeling like others won’t like us. The flip side of this is a socially anxious person, why they’re socially anxious? Well, they’re afraid that they’re going to be seen as not lovable, afraid that they’re going to be seen as not interesting, so that’s why they’re socially anxious. Or the depressed person who feels, “I’m unworthy, other people aren’t going to care about us.” We could go through all of the disorders this way, even narcissism, which in many cases has, as its root, feeling ashamed of some perceived inadequacy so that we’re boasting and building ourselves up. We have this other side to it too, which is that the root, some of the motivational energy, if you will, behind a lot of these disorders is feeling shame or inadequate. I think this is why it’s so important that we’re looking at shame because it gets you coming and going. You’re ashamed of having the disorder and shame itself fuels the disorder.”\n\nToxic shame and harmful behaviours\n\nIt’s very difficult to feel horrible about ourselves all the time, for decades, and maintaining toxic shame’s “cover-up operation” may be so demanding, taking up all our energy, which is why people with toxic shame may develop unhealthy coping techniques such as:\n\nAddiction including behavioural addiction such as eating disorders, workaholism (for external validation of our worthiness), and substance abuse (to numb the pain)\n\nSelf-harm\n\n“Why are you drinking? demanded the little prince.\n\n“So that I may forget,” replied the tippler.\n\n“Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who was already sorry for him.\n\n“Forget that I am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head.\n\n“Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.\n\n“Ashamed of drinking!”\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince\n\nJohn Bradshaw wrote “A person with internalised shame believes he is inherently flawed, inferior and defective. Such a feeling is so painful that defending scripts (or strategies) are developed to cover it up. These scripts are the roots of violence, criminality, war, self-loathing, hatred of others, cruelty, violence, brutality, prejudice and all forms of destructive addictions. As an internalised identity, toxic shame is one of the major sources of the demonic in human life.” He continued “Toxically shamed people tend to become more and more stagnant as life goes on. They live in a guarded, secretive and defensive way. They try to be more than human (perfect and controlling) or less than human (losing interest in life or stagnated in some addictive behaviour).” Toxic shame stifles personal development by preventing self-awareness and healing by preserving the image you want the world to perceive, or by ‘numbing out’ from, and checking out of, the world.\n\nExternal shame\n\nExternal shame is how we believe we exist in the minds of others. People who suffer with external shame believe that if others got to know them or got too close to them, they would be disappointed with what they discovered. External shame can be healed by removing the need for external validation (by loving yourself and realising that you have intrinsic self-worth — you are lovable and worthy) and practising self-acceptance. Needing validation from others is the consequence of shame, and not getting it is the source of more shame. We need to break this cycle. The answer is to love our selves more.\n\nInternal shame\n\nInternal shame is more about what people believe to be true about themselves. So, the answer here too is to love our selves more. Internal shame is frequently accompanied by emotions of “not being good enough” and severe self-criticism. These are people who are self-conscious about themselves, regardless of how others perceive them. They have ‘emotional insobriety’ (see next section below). According to Dr Paul Gilbert, psychologist, external shame is often most relevant for people with social anxiety. Depressed people are more likely to have both internal and external shame. He says “Internal shame is much more to do with the things that you feel you should be doing better or things that you know about you. Even when (other) people know about these things, and they’re not critical, you are.” Deborah Lee, psychologist, says “That because shame is a warning signal, we don’t really want to get rid of it.” I have to respectfully disagree. Moving from shame to guilt to sadness is an advocated psychological approach — but not one that I agree with, from personal experience and from a philosophical approach. When we awaken spiritually we become intuitive in making the most ‘divinely’ inspired decision. This comes from our assertive, boundaried adult. We really don’t need shame or our inner critic! We absolutely want to rid our selves of shame! As we have said, shame underlies every mental disorder. Why would we want to keep it? And why would we want people to feel guilt — surely they should feel compassion? Forgiving oneself, while still taking responsibility, is critical to recovery. Whatever we’re going through, we’re definitely exacerbating our unhappiness by feeling shame or guilt about it. In step 4 of the 12 steps, the admin step, you dispassionately examine your role or part in harms, as though the events were captured on camera, and you are simply looking at the photographs of the events and people. So that you can understand it. Otherwise, it’s simply too painful to do as an adult traumatised inner child. You make amends in step 8 to those you have harmed. That is very real. Feeling guilty is not helpful to those suffering from mental illness. Feeling guilt and shame is the whole problem. With shame there is no growth. You can make amends through compassion, you don’t need guilt in your life. Compassion starts with your self: We are all victims of victims. The Dalai Lama VIX says “Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.” Would you agree that the human race is barely surviving right now? We need more love and compassion, not judgment, shame, and guilt. Brené Brown said “We cannot grow when we are in shame, and we can’t use shame to change ourselves or others.” Bennet reminds us that positive thoughts are key “It’s important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences. You have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too. Nurture your mind with positive thoughts: kindness, empathy, compassion, peace, love, joy, humility, generosity, etc. The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.” Buddha said “With our thoughts we make the world.” Norman Vincent Peale, a clergyman who wrote the book “The Power of positive Thinking,” said “Change your thoughts and you change your world.” Dr Gilbert continues “When most people think of guilt, they think of doing something bad along with the emotions of remorse and sadness.” But according to Gilbert, guilt is also related to compassion because the focus is not just on blame for the harm that one has caused, but also on the desire to repair it. You’re not getting at yourself blaming someone, you’re just thinking, “Oh dear, how can I repair that? How can I help that person who I’ve betrayed or hurt or unintentionally, whatever, how can I do something about that? How can I repair that damage? It’s focused more on your behaviour and so forth, but it’s a caring focus, not on my status, my standing, my self esteem, it’s not that. It’s not about you, it’s about the person that’s been harmed. So this is very important also when we begin to look at it in terms of working with the self. So when people begin to realise that some of the behaviours have caused them harm, such as eating or whatever, or drinking or cutting, or whatever it is, they could feel ashamed about that. But what you do as a therapist, is you move them into guilt so they can just experience the sadness and sorrow that they’re in such a state and they did that, and that’s something that they can now regret and feel sorry for, without attacking. It’s just, that is sad, right? Shame is unreliable, but to be able for them to begin to really feel sadness for what they’ve done, that is the beginning of change. So this ability to get this caring system activated is very important.” As someone who has recovered from toxic shame, and with great respect, I have to say I disagree with this approach entirely — being told to replace shame with guilt and then sadness is like being judged by a critical parent and is saturated with negativity and blame, and these are the problem in the first place! From my personal experience this is not the solution. People do not need to be criticised. One heals shame with compassion and love, not judgment. And most importantly it is our own judgement that we must shed. We cannot become of service to others by being ridden by guilt. Why can we not move to altruism instead of guilt? Being labelled a perpetrator is blaming, and keep people paradoxically in victim mode. Anyone who remains a victim is incapable of personal growth and change. The same is true of the other person. Everyone needs to be a compassionate creator.\n\nWe need to move from victim mode to become creators: This is the basis of the Drama Triangle by Karpman — moving from drama to presence.\n\nShame-based behaviours include compulsive behaviours, which all seek validation, such as workaholism, shopping, food related addictions, internet addiction, sex and love addiction, or substance-based addictions, to numb ourselves from the pain. Dr Gabor Maté asks, not why the addiction, but why the pain? He also says that 90% of people are addicts, and the rest are deluding themselves. We will feel ashamed if we join in with addictions: Shame is unavoidable. Addictive and other obsessive habits should be avoided because they will drown us in shame.\n\nOur past, and the brainwashing we may have had that imposed “original shame” upon us, may try to put further shame on us. This might happen whether we’re alone, walking through the supermarket, or simply going about our daily lives. Don’t think… Don’t feel. Don’t change or evolve... Don’t let yourself be alive... Don’t waste your time... Shame on you! Get rid of your shame. Go to war with your shame. Defeat shame. Learn to spot it and stay away from it like the plague. Drop it like a rock. Evict it. It serves no purpose at all, despite what some psychologists tell you\n\nToday, I’m going to make a conscious effort not to be caught up in the world’s guilt. If I can’t stop myself, I’ll experience it, accept it, and move on as swiftly as possible. I will remind my self that it’s alright to love yourself and to refuse to be shamed. If I stray from the path, I will be compassionate with myself, try to remember how to transform shame into remorse, repair my behaviour, and move on with my life in immediate self-love. Shame and blame do not work. Brené Brown wrote in The Gifts of Imperfection “Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows.” Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor, great Stoic philosopher, and author of the timeless inspirational book “Meditations,” wrote “It is not the actions of others which trouble us (for those actions are controlled by their governing part), but rather it is our own judgments. Therefore, remove those judgments and resolve to let go of your anger, and it will already be gone. How do you let go? By realising that such actions are not shameful to you.” Brené Brown said “You cannot shame or belittle people into changing their behaviours.” Amen to Marcus and Brené. We need compassionate leadership in our medical system, workplace, and institutions. What we should be saying to people suffering from toxic shame is “You are imperfect, you are wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging” (Brené Brown). As human beings we are all flawed individuals, who make mistakes, who are essentially worthy. Shame begets shame. Why would anyone advocate guilt over service through compassion? John Bradshaw wrote “Giving and receiving unconditional love is the most effective and powerful way to personal wholeness and happiness.” The keystone to a better world is to nurture ourselves and each other with compassion and love: Brené Brown wrote “Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them — we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.”\n\nShame, guilt, and sadness should never be a goal. Joy, optimism, hope, and positive thinking have been proven neuroscientifically to heal shame by laying down new neural networks. The more we participate in specific thoughts and behaviours, the more likely we are to have those thoughts. Such thoughts, in essence, become habits. While we may believe that our beliefs are ingrained in our personalities, we actually have more flexibility in our capacity to develop new thinking habits and, as a result, how we feel about ourselves. The term “plasticity” refers to the brain’s ability to change. Increase the quantity and strength of nerve connections in the brain by engaging in new thoughts and behaviours. This makes it more likely that you’ll have such ideas and act in such ways. Breaking through the shame bubble necessitates the growth of awareness, self-reflection, and a measure of optimism that, despite our thoughts, we can eventually remove their grip.\n\nJonathan Swift wrote “I never wonder to see men wicked, but I often wonder to see them not ashamed.” Chögyam Trungpa wrote “We do not have to be ashamed of what we are. As sentient beings we have wonderful backgrounds. These backgrounds may not be particularly enlightened or peaceful or intelligent. Nevertheless, we have soil good enough to cultivate; we can plant anything in it.” We should not judge other human beings writes Brené Brown “The biggest potential for helping us overcome shame is this: We are “those people.” The truth is…we are the others. Most of us are one paycheck, one divorce, one drug-addicted kid, one mental health illness, one sexual assault, one drinking binge, one night of unprotected sex, or one affair away from being “those people”–the ones we don’t trust, the ones we pity, the ones we don’t let our kids play with, the ones bad things happen to, the ones we don’t want living next door.” Jesus said in John 8:7 “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” True that! Hard to argue with the big man! Wilson Kanadi puts this so succinctly “Those who judge will never understand, and those who understand will never judge.”\n\nMindfulness moment: How the mind works\n\nIt works like this: You have on average around 60,000 thoughts per day: 90 percent of them are repetitive, and 80–90 percent are negative. That’s around 45,000 negative repetitive thoughts per day. You latch on to some of the thoughts, which become your ‘thinking’. These negative thoughts cause negative emotions, which are simply the body’s way of commenting on the quality of those thoughts. It is best to simply note the thoughts and the feelings and let them pass, like watching a wave pass as you ‘bob’ over it: This is the basis of meditation and mindfulness. Then you will feel bliss, which is your truth, the formless energy that you feel when you are aligned to your purpose, totally present, and when you are in nature — connection to pure potentially, without the fog of thinking. That energy is clean and is pure energy and truth. You have access to it any time and anywhere. Amy Johnson wrote in her brilliant book “Being Human” “Something truly magical happens when you deeply get that the thoughts that roll through your mind all day long are not yours. You aren’t the thinker of your thoughts.” When you become enlightened to this, which simply means waking up, you know that your happiness does not depend on people, places or things-it can’t. Awareness and enlightenment are very simple, they are “The art of knowing is knowing what to ignore” (Rumi). Sigmund Freud, neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis, said “You are not your thoughts.” “The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but thought about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral. It is as it is” (Eckhart Tolle).\n\nPresence — today is a gift: That’s why it’s called the present. We must learn to stay in the present moment. We must trust that we are at the right place, at the right time, with all the preparation we need to succeed, here and now. Fretting and negative thinking take our focus away from the moment and the rich invitation for personal involvement that it’s extending. Remember, it’s through the full interaction with the present that we are nurtured emotionally and spiritually and encouraged to attain our full potential, awareness, and enlightenment. Today I’ll remember that I am all I need to be. Nic Nolte, in The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, a movie inspired by true life events, plays the role of a guide named Socrates in a story about the path to healing and spiritual awakening: Following some very painful lessons, an athlete transforms from an ego-centric competitor to becoming a ‘peaceful warrior’. I totally identify with this story: My name Olly means ‘peaceful’ and Alexander means ‘defender of people.’ As the athlete tackles a seemingly impossible gymnastic sequence “Where are you, Dan?” “Here.” “What time is it?” “Now.” “What are You?” “This Moment.” World class athletes are coached to remain present. Every shot is the only shot, whether its Championship point at Wimbledon or the first point of the tournament. You must be present to win. The film director Federico Fellini said “There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the passion of life.” Johnny Cash summed it up: “You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past, don’t dwell on it. You don’t let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.” Even our children are being told this, so why do we forget?: “Yesterday is history, tomorrow is as mystery, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present” (Master Oogway, Kung Fu Panda). There is no fear in the present. Contemporary protagonist Tolle says “Realise deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary focus of your life… If not now, when?” Of course, such great thoughts always have their antecedents “Confine yourself to the present…. Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present” (Aurelius); Saint Charlotte said “Every day is a new day. No need to dwell on the past. Look straight ahead.” Jesus said “Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day’s own trouble be sufficient for the day.” “Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.” (Buddha). Tolle continues “Die to the past every moment. You don’t need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your presence… It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.” De Mello agrees “Eternity is in this moment”. Corrie ten Boom, author, wrote “Worrying is carrying tomorrow’s load with today’s strength — carrying two days at a once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow; it empties today of its strength.”\n\nAccept what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be. “If your mind carries a heavy burden of past, you will experience more of the same. The past perpetuates itself through lack of presence. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future.. the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfilment in whatever form. Both are illusions… Always say “yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to what already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you… All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry — all forms of fear — are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence… As soon as you honour the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love — even the most simple action” (Tolle).\n\nThe human condition, as Eckhart Tolle says, is to be lost in thought. Normally, we do what we want with little thought to how it might affect others, because we feel that we’re the centre of the universe, the only one that counts. This kind of thinking does not correspond to reality: it is selfish and brings unhappiness to ourselves and others. To become enlightened, we first need to start:\n\nRealising how everything actually exists, and so no longer let our projections fool us\n\nUnderstanding the effects of our behaviour on ourselves and others, and so refrain from acting destructively\n\nWhen we stop believing our mind’s projections, we also stop disturbing emotions like anger, hatred, greed and jealousy from arising based on that confusion. We will never again act compulsively on our negative feelings.\n\nAll of this requires:\n\nConcentration, to avoid distraction or dullness\n\nWisdom, to discriminate between what is helpful and harmful, and what is true and false\n\nEmotional balance, from cultivating positive qualities like love and compassion\n\nEthical self-discipline, with the strength to refrain from unwise behaviour\n\nAs a Buddha, we are also omniscient, but not omnipotent. We can’t eliminate others’ suffering, but we can show the way through teaching them and by being a living example. To travel the path all the way to enlightenment, we need to:\n\nBuild up an incredible store of positive force: selflessly benefiting others as best we can\n\nWork toward understanding reality: stop projecting nonsense onto the world\n\nWe all have the working materials — our physical bodies and basic human intelligence — to build up the causes for enlightenment. Like the sky, our minds and hearts are by their very nature unpolluted by emotional turmoil and disturbing thoughts. All we need to do is develop them so that they can reach their full potential.\n\nEnlightenment might seem like an almost impossible-to-reach goal, and it is very difficult to achieve — no one ever claimed it was easy! But, to aim in that direction gives incredible meaning to our lives. Understanding our interconnectedness with everyone, we protect ourselves from depression and anxiety. Our lives become full as we embark on the greatest adventure there is: attaining enlightenment for the benefit of all.\n\nIn his book “Awareness” Anthony De Mello states the powerful words “All is well. Everything is a mess. But all is well.” Happiness comes from within. So does misery.\n\nAmy Johnson continues “You are an open channel through which inner wisdom-that inextricably wise guidance to which we all have access-can and does pass.” The only thing that ever temporarily blocks that open channel is entertaining the negative thoughts that enter your mind, that are not your thoughts. Don’t identify or attach with thoughts as if they were “yours” — part of who you are. They are not, though by attaching to them, this makes up the experience of your life. Amy Johnson writes “One hundred percent of life comes from thought. Your experience of life is internally generated from within you-inside out. Quite inconveniently, life always appears as if it’s outside in; as if things outside of you directly impact your experience. They do not. Your consciousness brings your thinking to life like a film projector brings the images of film to life, resulting in your unique, thought based reality… The truth of the matter is that your entire experience of including all of your emotions, reactions, and feelings-are created from within you, via thought. Our perceptual system is designed such that it truly appears as if outside events directly affect us. And yet, it’s always your thinking about those things that creates your experience, not the circumstances themselves… If you doubt that thought is insignificant and effortlessly arising within you, watch a two year old. She doesn’t identify with or attach to thought, and so her thoughts and emotions flow freely and quickly, un-messed with… Given that your true nature is endless wellbeing, clarity, and peace of mind… and given that new thought is always showing up for you when you don’t interfere with the process by holding on to old thought… there’s simply nothing to do but understand the way the system works. When you have a deep appreciation for how your experience really works, you can rest in that understanding… You can’t think yourself back to clarity and you don’t have to. You are clarity, you occasionally covered with thought to which you are clinging. A return to your clear nature only requires that you withdraw your effort and energy, and wait.”\n\nSo you can access the bliss of enlightenment at any time? Yes. Try it. For more on this please read my blog post.\n\nEmotional sobriety\n\nAre you emotionally sober yet? Emotional sobriety is when your happiness and peace do not depend on people, places, or things: Without emotional sobriety you cannot become transformed. Buddha said “Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” Gandhi echoed “Each one has to find his peace from within. And for peace to be real it must be unaffected by outside circumstances.” Miyamoto Musashi, swordsman, philosopher, and writer, said “There is nothing outside of your self that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of your self.”\n\nAs Deepak Chopra says in The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success “Self referral means that the internal reference point is our own spirit. In object referral we constantly seek the approval of others: This is therefore fear-based. We also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for power. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality, which is true power. If you didn’t have fear you wouldn’t feel the need for control. In the latter the internal reference point is the ego. It is not who you are. It is your social mask. It is your social mask that wants approval. Your true self is not fearful of any challenge. Your true self feels that it is beneath no one. Yet it is humble. It draws people to you. It comes from being in the state of Grace.” Shame-based people reside in permanent egocentric fear.: I know this. Shame-based people come from object referral.\n\nBelieve in yourself. Love your self: Not in a Narcissistic way, but by accepting who you truly are. Narcissists hate themselves. Narcissists go to the gym because they hate their body. Spiritually well people go to the gym because we love our body — we practice self care, and self love. From there we have unlimited compassion for all human beings. We forgive everyone. Confucius said “Seek revenge and you should dig two graves, one for yourself.” Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said “He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love… I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.” Becoming emotionally sober is perhaps the greatest gift of all: Self love andf happiness doesn’t come from external people or circumstances. It comes from within. You are transformed. All is well. All will BE well. Believe in your new reality — success. Then you won’t self-sabotage — why would you hurt your self? You are limitless. You have changed your character — who you really are has already changed. By your action grace has changed your character. Realise you are worthy. How do you achieve emotional sobriety? The solutions are:\n\nMy Seven S’s of Emotional Sobriety (when your happiness and peace no longer depend on people, places, or things — this is key to awakening & enlightenment):\n\nSurrender — so give up control, accept help — be touched by grace — Your higher power is working 24 hours a day for emotional sobriety and change in character\n\nSelf love — from self hate to unconditional self-love, and realising that self-love can’t come from outside your self\n\nSilence your inner critic and inner conflict trying to hide yourself — realise everyone is light and dark — awakening increases the light and reduces the darkness — rigorous honesty is accepting everything that is you, right NOW! Carl Rogers, psychologist and founder of the Humanist approach — “When you accept yourself just as you are then you begin to change”\n\nSustained action to change your character — “Faith without works is dead” (James)\n\nSelf-observation without criticism — when others praise you or criticise you — feel I know you love me as I love me; your criticism is unjust as I love me — the new message becomes the only message\n\nSurvey the good things that you create in line with your core values and purpose\n\nService — Give to others without expectation of return what YOU want and need. Love others unconditionally. This will change your values and beliefs from egocentric to helping others through service. In the Bible, Corinthians the word love is translated as ‘charity’. Therefore giving love results in Karma, the great law of life: What you give is what you get. Therefore by saving others you will be saved. What goes around comes around: Every time. Emotional sobriety is above all the realisation that it is by giving that we receive. “For what you sow so shall you reap… Cast your bread upon the water and you will receive.” What you want for your self you must give to others; It is the giving that will return to you.\n\nFor an amazing speech about emotional sobriety the concept is best delineated by the famous 12 step recovery speaker Tom B:\n\nWhat are the benefits of losing our toxic shame?\n\nWe move from egocentricity to a life of service to others. Shannon Alder wrote “God whispered, “You endured a lot. For that I am truly sorry, but grateful. I needed you to struggle to help so many. Through that process you would grow into who you have now become. Didn’t you know that I gave all my struggles to my favourite children? One only needs to look at the struggles given to your older brother Jesus to know how important you have been to me.” It is not that God sends his strongest battles to his toughest soldiers, but that God creates his toughest soldiers by sending them into battle. Life loves you so much that it sends you difficulties to make you strong. Read that again.\n\nHumility\n\nGeneral Iroh “Pride is not the opposite of shame, but it’s source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.” Without shaming the general, his zealousness is admirable, humility is essential to recovery from shame, dropping one’s ego and discovering one’s true self and therefore purpose — which is to be of service to others. But there are many other facets to the cure for shame.\n\nThrough trauma comes transformation\n\nE.A. Bucchianeri said “It’s a shame there has to be a tragedy before the best in people will finally shine.” The psychologist Dr Steven Taylor says in his book, through trauma comes transformation that after trauma we drop the ego and find our self: Recovering after adversity is the road to enlightenment. In every English dictionary resilience is defined as the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties: the ability to be happy, and purposeful again after something difficult or bad has happened. It is NOT the resistance to being broken — that is rigidity, stiffness, or inflexibility. Those are not good character traits! Strength isn’t about how much you can handle before you break, it’s about how much you can endure after you’ve been broken. “We need never be hopeless because we can never be irreparably broken” (John Greene).\n\nEmmet Fox wrote “It is the law that any difficulties that can come to you at any time, must be exactly what you need most at the moment to enable you to take the next step forward by overcoming them… Suppose your whole world seems to rock on its foundations. Hold on steadily, let it rock, and when the rocking is over, the picture will have reassembled itself into something much nearer to your heart’s desire… Some day (when we have enough spiritual growth) we will come to see that the seemingly disjointed happenings, the apparent accidents, are really part of an orderly pattern.” Marcus Aurelius wrote “Whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time.” We can’t choose the cards we are dealt with, but we can choose how we play the game. Nietzsche famously said “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” “Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny“ (C.S. Lewis). It’s darkest before the dawn. There is no growth without adversity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote “Life begins on the other side of despair.” Buddha said “Even loss and betrayal can bring us awakening.” Jesus in John 3:3 “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Rumi wrote “The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” “Turn your wounds into wisdom” (Oprah Winfrey). Carl Jung wrote “In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order… There is no coming to consciousness without pain.”\n\n“Even in the midst of devastation, something within us always points the way to freedom” (Sharon Salzberg). When encountering enormous adversity, challenges, and trauma in life, as all of us will, the first reaction may be to withdraw and collapse. Chris Bradford said “Anyone can give up; it is the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone would expect you to fall apart, now that is true strength.” Aeschylus wrote “Wisdom comes alone through suffering.” Friedrich Nietzsche wrote “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.” “Only in the darkness can you see the stars.” (The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) In fact it is “Not until we are lost do we begin to find ourselves” (Henry David Thoreau). J.R.R. Tolkien wrote “From the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring; renewed shall be blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king.” Then you will be like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Audrey Hepburn said “Nothing is impossible. The word itself says ‘I’M POSSIBLE’!” “Life has to break you down so you could be rebuilt. Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you are meant to be on” (Robin Sharma). A breakdown can become your breakthrough. Ferguson mused “You have to break down before you can break through.” “The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places” (Ernest Hemingway).\n\nThe Dalai Lama said “ When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways — either by losing hope and falling into self destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength.” Carl Jung wrote “The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it.” He also said “There’s no coming to consciousness without pain… The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.” Stop trying to calm the storm: Calm your self, the storm will pass. Napoleon Bonaparte said “Victory is not always winning the battle… but rising every time you fall.” You are not the darkness you endured, you are the light that refused to surrender. “You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?” (Nietzsche).\n\nBuddha said “Like the lotus we have the ability to rise from the mud and bloom out of the darkness and radiate into the world.” “You can come out of the furnace of trouble two ways: if you let it consume you, you come out a cinder; but there is a kind of metal which refuses to be consumed and comes out a star” (Jean Church). “So long as you haven’t experienced this — to die and so to grow: You are only a troubled guest on the dark earth” (Goethe). “Some changes look negative on the surface but you will soon realise that space is being created in your life for something new to emerge” (Eckhart Tolle).\n\n“I don’t think of all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains” (Anne Frank). “Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.” (Robert H. Schuller). “When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it” (Henry Ford).\n\nSelf-pity is the thief of time. Being in victim mode does not allow growth. “Victims fall in love with excuses” (Robin Sharma). “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy” (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) “The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything” Bishop W.C. Magee.\n\n“Very good days are ahead. Turbulence is necessary for transformation. And things must fall apart for this to be built up in a greater way. The suffering will morph into strength. The wounds will grow into wisdom. The volatility will — eventually — yield a more decent humanity” (Robin Sharma). Joseph Campbell discussed personal transformation in the belly of the whale stage of the Hero’s Journey: The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero’s known world and self. By entering this stage, the person shows a willingness to undergo a metamorphosis. “By this, the dreamer crosses to the other shore. And by a like miracle, so will each whose work is the difficult, dangerous task of self-discovery and self-development, be portered across the ocean of life.” Scott Peck wrote “It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually. To proceed very far through the desert, you must be willing to meet existential suffering and work it through. In order to do this, the attitude toward pain has to change. This happens when we accept the fact that everything that happens to us has been designed for our spiritual growth. Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom; indeed, they create our courage and wisdom.”\n\nDr Steve Taylor, psychologist, explains in his book ‘Extraordinary Awakenings: When Trauma Leads to Transformation’ how trauma and adversity leads to a greater understanding of who we truly are:\n\nFor 15 years, he researched cases of spontaneous awakening that occurred in the midst of intense psychological trauma such as bereavement, severe depression, addiction, intense stress, and suffering. A miraculous transformation sometimes occurs: the death of an old identity and the birth of a new, spiritually awakened self. He explains what we can learn from the phenomenon and teach some principles that can apply to our own spiritual development and enlightenment. This process is due to the process of the disillusion of identity or ego, breaking down the sense of identity and ego, allowing for the emergence of a deeper essential self. So trauma can lead to new depths of spiritual awakening that most of us find difficult to imagine. Even during deep depression one can feel moments of elation walking in the woods feeling connected and uplifted — trees seem like sentient beings and the sky feels to have radiance a sense that all things are one and you are a part of this oneness. The world feels like harmony, clarity, and truth. The experience leaves you with a sense that life is more meaningful. One can finally understand and accept oneself through these spiritual journeys or awakening experiences — one feels more intensely and fully awake. When we return to normal consciousness, we carry them with us and gain a positivity about life. This is transformation through turmoil — going through a dramatic transformation into a higher functioning state, which is equivalent to permanent spiritual awakening. In addicts it may manifest itself as ‘addiction release’ — a sudden freedom from craving after hitting rock bottom. It also happens during depression and grief loss. People experience this shift as a new identity: a shift into a new and integrated self-system which is fundamentally different to their previous self-system. Steve Taylor says “It’s like there are two people — there’s a before and after.” People feel that “There’s no going back. I am a different person now, for the rest of my life… I’ve moved into another level of consciousness which I know is going to stay with me. It’s like the transformation of a caterpillar goes through during the chrysalis stage before emerging as a butterfly.” As long as you let go and step back from your predicament you can remain in an ongoing state of bliss and harmony.\n\nIn his study about activities and situations associated with awakening experiences (n=97) the most common trigger is psychological turmoil =37 (stress, depression, bereavement), followed by contact with nature =23, followed by spiritual practice = 21 (meditation, prayer, yoga), spiritual literature =15, love/sex =5, watching or listening to arts performances =3. It is almost that joy and despair are not opposites, but they are intertwined. These experiences can last days. In some cases, people undergo a permanent shift inside them almost as though they have taken on a new identity.\n\nAt rock bottom the false house of the ego collapses. The normal self and identity give way, and again there is an open space inside us. In some people this gives space for a latent higher self to emerge and fill, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. It has been waiting to arise. Why doesn’t everyone undergo this transformation? The person has to have a sense of openness and readiness to experience and empathy to the world. People with strong control or ego are less likely to let go and see this change. It’s a question of readiness — the ego is not ready to emerge. The main factor in transformation is acknowledgment and acceptance. People identify a moment where they stop fighting, surrender and open themselves, and embrace their situation rather than push it away. Drop into your suffering : Let go.\n\nDr Steve Taylor describes a 3-stage process to harnessing the transformational potential of adversity when crises occur in our lives:\n\n1. Acknowledgement — face the reality of your predicament/situation — remain open — don’t mentally push it away — acknowledge it — bring it to the forefront of your awareness. It means contemplating the effects on your life, accepting the consequences and acknowledging the effects on people in your life around you.\n\n2. Exploration — go inside yourself, enter your own being and bring the light of awareness and explore your own experience. Be aware of your negative feelings and the thoughts which accompany them. Even if the feelings are painful, the pain will diminish as you become aware of them. You will become aware of a space or distance from those thoughts or feelings. Allow that distance to grow wider and expand, through recovery. You will feel how the emotions or thoughts become less disturbing like ripples on a lake that fade away and settle until the surface of the lake becomes calm. The light of awareness takes away anxiety. We become one with our feelings and they become more benign and harmonious. Like you are simply sitting in stillness watch the river go by.\n\n3. Acceptance — the most important stage of this process — once you are aware of your resistance, you can make a conscious decision to let go of it. Instead, embrace and accept your predicament. Accept the predicament and the feelings and thoughts that accompany it. Let go and release. Imagine a bond or cord connecting you to the situation — you can feel the tension connecting you to the experience — now imagine that the cord dissolves and as it dissolves you feel release. You can do this with your outbreaths when meditating and let go of your connection to these emotions. Then you undergo a transformation — feeling wellbeing and release rather than conflict. The more present you become the richer the experience is. Look at your life from a panorama as though it’s a landscape — embrace the whole of the landscape just as it is right now in a mode of acceptance and openness.\n\nThe alchemy of acceptance: Trauma can leave your life in ruins, or it can transform you and give rise to the depths of your being and give structure, strength and a miraculous new self. Desire for a different life will no longer plague your mind. You will feel a constant flow of gratitude for the gifts you have. All these are the result of acceptance. Grief needs acceptance. Trauma needs acceptance. Addiction needs acceptance. When we resist any aspect of our life it creates discord, resentment, duality (always in opposition and conflict to something). If you accept it you become one with it and your life becomes harmonious. Let go of your resistance. There is an evolutionary aspect to these experiences. Spiritual awakening is part of the evolution of human consciousness to a higher functioning state.\n\nWhy are openness, vulnerability, and rigorous honesty so critical to recovery from shame?\n\nThere is an aphorism in recovery circles “You are only as sick as your secrets.” Brené Brown wrote in Daring Greatly “Shame derives its power from being unspeakable.” By being completely vulnerable and honest open and willing one loses shame. Also, by working the 12 step programme as people in the fellowship don’t judge. Truth gets rid of shame. Truth gives courage. Courage allows action. Action directed to service and one’s true purpose. Openness, rigorous honesty, and vulnerability are essential elements of healing. Dr Susan Pollak says “So we don’t get trapped in shame. So, hiding the shame is really what keeps it alive. Keeping silent is what keeps it alive. So basically, we’re afraid that if anyone finds out, we’ll be rejected, we’ll be shunned, we’ll be found to be defective. So, what we do to protect ourselves is we isolate.”\n\nBrené Brown wrote “Shame derives its power from being unspeakable.” She continues “Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy — the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light… We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honour the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.” Ellen Bass wrote “So often survivors have had their experiences denied, trivialised, or distorted. Writing is an important avenue for healing because it gives you the opportunity to define your own reality. You can say: This did happen to me. It was that bad. It was the fault & responsibility of the adult. I was — and am — innocent.” Brené Brown wrote in Daring Greatly “If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can’t survive.” Brené Brown wrote in The Gifts of Imperfection “Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It’s about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen.” She continued “If we share our shame story with the wrong person, they can easily become one more piece of flying debris in an already dangerous storm… Our stories are not meant for everyone. Hearing them is a privilege, and we should always ask ourselves this before we share: “Who has earned the right to hear my story?” If we have one or two people in our lives who can sit with us and hold space for our shame stories, and love us for our strengths and struggles, we are incredibly lucky. If we have a friend, or small group of friends, or family who embraces our imperfections, vulnerabilities, and power, and fills us with a sense of belonging, we are incredibly lucky.” Brené also wrote “I now see how owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we will ever do… Staying vulnerable is a risk we have to take if we want to experience connection.” Brené Brown wrote in Daring Greatly “Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen.” Brené Brown wrote in Daring Greatly “Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness.” She continued “Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.” Brené Brown wrote in Rising Strong “Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it’s having the courage to show up and be seen when we have no control over the outcome. Vulnerability is not weakness; it’s our greatest measure of courage.” Brené Brown wrote “Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.” She concludes “If you own this story you get to write the ending.” What more need I say on this?\n\nEmotions\n\nWe are afraid of our feelings because we were never taught it’s OK to have them and how to move through them. So we run from them, bury them, swallow them, carry them, suppress them, avoid them, distract ourselves and attempt to gain internal validation through external validation, which is impossible (with behavioural addictions such as work) or numb ourselves (substance and alcohol addictions). Emotions are buried alive, not dead. John Bradshaw says “Shame is internalised when one is abandoned. Abandonment is the precise term to describe how one loses one’s authentic self and ceases to exist psychologically.” To experience unprocessed toxic shame means that shame becomes not just your predominate all pervasive emotion, your identity, rather, you become shame. John Bradshaw wrote “When our instinctual life is shamed, the natural core of our life is bound up. It’s like an acorn going through excruciating agony for becoming an oak, or a flower feeling ashamed for blossoming… To be shame-bound means that whenever you feel any feeling, need or drive, you immediately feel ashamed. The dynamic core of your human life is grounded in your feelings, needs and drives. When these are bound by shame, you are shamed to the core.” He continues “When emotionally abandoned people describe their childhoods, it is always without feeling.\n\nAlexander Den Heijer wrote “When a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.” Worth pondering on. Just think of those prisons in “The Wisdom of Trauma” film by Dr Gabor Maté mentioned above.\n\nAlice Miller writes, “They recount their earliest memories without any sympathy for the child they once were. Very often they show disdain and irony, even derision and cynicism. In general, there is a complete absence of real emotional understanding or serious appreciation of their own childhood vicissitudes and no conception of their true need — beyond the need for achievement. The internalisation of the original drama has been so complete that the illusion of a good childhood can be maintained.” John Bradshaw wrote so beautifully “Emotions are a form of energy in motion. They signal us of a loss, a threat or a satiation. Sadness is about losing something we cherish. Anger and fear are signal of actual or impending threats to our well-being. Joy signals that we are fulfilled and satisfied. Whenever a child is shamed through some form of abandonment, feelings of anger, hurt and sadness arise. Since shame-based parents are shame bound in all their emotions, they cannot tolerate their children’s emotions. Therefore, they shame their children’s emotions. When their emotions are shamed, children numb out, so they don’t feel their emotions.”\n\nDr. Christopher Germer says: “Shame is an emotion and has a beginning, a middle and an end. As an emotion, it also has a mental component and it has a physical component. So, the mental component of shame is usually what we call a negative core belief.” I have to respectfully disagree: In my experience toxic shame has no end. Your whole being is shame.\n\nDr. Jack Kornfield says “You know, most all of therapy is about love. It’s how it works. People come in, and they have their struggles, and they have the ways that they get caught in their own mind, with their obsessions or their fears, you know? Their nightmares, their self-judgment and self-hatred, their reactivity to the world, and their delusions. And while we have many beautiful tools to work with the rewriting of stories, from unhealthy to healthy stories, with the opening of the body of fear that holds so much of past trauma, with the ways of allowing emotions to be released in present and not so frightening, that it’s possible to be with our human experience in a wiser, more spacious, less activated and frightened way with the whole of our life. In the end, along with those techniques, what really matters is love.” I wholeheartedly agree with this.\n\nShame is an multigenerational problem — time to break the chain of inheritance\n\nJohn Bradshaw writes “Shame-based families and multigenerational illness: One of the devastating aspects of toxic shame is that it is multigenerational. The secret and hidden aspects of toxic shame form the wellsprings of its multigenerational life. Since it is kept hidden, it cannot be worked out. Families are as sick as their toxic shame secrets… Family secrets can go back for generations. They can be about suicides, homicides, incest, abortions, addictions, public loss of face, financial disaster, etc. All the secrets get acted out. This is the power of toxic shame. The pain and suffering of shame generate automatic and unconscious defences. Freud called these defences by various names: denial, idealisation of parents, repression of emotions and dissociation from emotions. What is important to note is that we can’t know what we don’t know. Denial, idealisation, repression and dissociation are unconscious survival mechanisms. Because they are unconscious, we lose touch with the shame, hurt and pain they cover up. We cannot heal what we cannot feel. So without recovery, our toxic shame gets carried for generations.” He continues “If our primary caregivers are shame-based, they will act shameless and pass their toxic shame onto us. There is no way to teach self-value if one does not value oneself. Toxic shame is multigenerational. It is passed from one generation to the next. Shame-based people find other shame-based people and get married. As each member of a couple carries the shame from his or her own family system, their marriage will be grounded in their shame-core. The major outcome of this will be a lack of intimacy. It’s difficult to let someone get close to you if you feel defective and flawed as a human being. Shame-based couples maintain non-intimacy through poor communication, non-productive circular fighting, games, manipulation, vying for control, withdrawal, blaming and confluence. Confluence is the agreement never to disagree. Confluence creates pseudo-intimacy.” Again, I have nothing more to add.\n\nSigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis: The id, ego and superego explained\n\nThe idea that the human psyche (personality) has more than one aspect is perhaps Freud’s most persistent and essential idea.\n\nThe id, ego, and superego, according to Freud’s personality theory (1923), are three elements of the psyche that develop at different points in our lives. These are systems, not brain parts or physical structures.\n\nThe id: I view the id as the inner child. It is the most basic and instinctive aspect of one’s personality. The id is a component of the unconscious that houses all of one’s desires and impulses, which are employed for everything from survival instincts to art appreciation, creativity and joy. The id is the impulsive (and unconscious) component of our psyche that reacts to basic urges, needs, and desires in a direct and immediate manner. The newborn child’s personality is all id, and it is only later that an ego and super-ego emerge. Because it is not in touch with the outside world, the id’s function remains child-like throughout a person’s life and does not alter with time or experience. Because it functions in the unconscious region of the mind, the id is unaffected by reality, logic, or the everyday world. When a child is traumatised, the id is in charge of you as the adult in you does not show up. The pleasure principle (Freud, 1920) states that every wishful impulse should be realised as soon as possible, regardless of the consequences. When the id’s needs are met, we feel pleasure; when they are not, we feel ‘unpleasure’ or tension. This is the basis of addiction. The id engages in primitive, illogical, irrational, and fantasy-oriented primary process thinking. This type of process thinking is selfish and wishful in nature and has no understanding of objective reality.\n\nThe ego is ‘that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world.’ The ego is the only aspect of the conscious personality that is aware of itself. It’s what a person notices when they think about themselves, and it’s what they strive to reflect onto others. The ego grows in order to serve as a buffer between the unrealistic id and the external reality. It is the part of the personality that makes decisions. The ego, in its ideal state, is rational, intuitive, and assertive, whereas the id is chaotic and illogical. The ego follows the realism principle, figuring out realistic ways to meet the id’s desires, typically compromising or deferring fulfilment to avoid unfavourable societal consequences. When selecting how to act, the ego considers societal reality and standards, as well as etiquette and rules. Freud’s ego has no notion of right and wrong; anything is excellent if it accomplishes its goal of satisfaction without harming itself or the id. This is where I differ from Freud — your true self does know right from wrong. Spiritual law states this, and I am not sure why Freud departed from this position. However, I do agree with the following assumptions by Freud: Some sorts of atypical upbringing, according to Freudians (especially if there is a cold, rejecting unvalidating mother), might result in a weak and fragile ego, whose ability to contain the id’s demands is limited. This can result in the ego’s attempt to confine the id ‘breaking apart,’ leaving the id in complete control of the psyche. Thus, in traumatised children, the adult you — the ego, fails to show up, and allows the inner child to have unsupervised play — you become a ‘horse without a rider’. Further, when you are traumatised and therefore spiritually unwell, or asleep, the adult you, along with your inner child, are both driven by the need for external validation so they charge together towards unhappiness, as true happiness can only come from within. We need the adult you, the assertive ego, to wake up, and always show up.\n\nThe superego is made up of societal ideals and principles that one learns from one’s parents and guardians. These do not necessarily equate with spiritual law such as the law of karma, or those ideals that are in line with a utopian society. The superego appears between the ages of 3 and 5. Depending on which portion is activated, the superego is considered as the purveyor of rewards (feelings of pride and satisfaction) and punishments (feelings of shame and guilt). Remember, what we said about humility, there is pride before a fall. A traumatised child grows up with a superego that acts as their critical parent, boosting their feelings of unworthiness and toxic shame. The superego is a part of the unconscious and is the voice of self-criticism, your inner critic. The conscience and the ideal self are the two systems that make up the superego. Our conscience is our “inner voice” that warns us when we have made a mistake. The conscience can punish the ego by instilling remorse in it. If the ego gives in to the id’s demands (common in traumatised children when they become adults as the adult does not show up or is fragile), the superego, as the critical parent, may use shame to make the person feel shame to the core. The superego is also deceptive in that it will try to portray what it wants the individual to accomplish in grandiose, glowing terms, which Freud referred to as the ego-ideal, which comes from the person’s first major love relationship (usually a parent). The ideal self (or ego-ideal) is a fictional representation of how you should be, representing career goals, interpersonal relationships, and social behaviour. It is assumed that traumatised children raised by parent’s experience love conditionally (when they do something well), and that the child internalises these experiences as a succession of real or imagined judgemental judgments. This is the result of not being loved unconditionally. The superego may use guilt to penalise behaviour that falls short of the ideal self. When we behave ‘correctly,’ the super-ego can reward us by making us feel proud through the ideal self.\n\nBecause of the id’s impulses and drives, as well as the superego’s prohibitions and laws, shame is a prevalent problem in traumatised children (those who were not loved unconditionally). Defence mechanisms refer to the various methods in which an individual deals with shame — numbing out or seeking external validation through addictions for example.\n\nIf a person’s ideal self is set too high by their internal critical parent (a reflection of their own parenting) , then anything they do will be viewed as a failure by themselves. They will feel deeply unworthy and ashamed. The ideal self and conscience are mostly formed in childhood as a result of family beliefs and upbringing.\n\nJohn Bradshaw says “The job of parents is to model. Modelling includes how to be a man or woman; how to relate intimately to another person; how to acknowledge and express emotions; how to fight fairly; how to have physical, emotional and intellectual boundaries; how to communicate; how to cope and survive life’s unending problems; how to be self-disciplined; and how to love oneself and another. Shame-based parents cannot do any of these. They simply don’t know how.” He continues “The most paradoxical aspect of neurotic shame is that it is the core motivator of the superachieved and the underachieved, the star and the scapegoat, the righteous and the wretched, the powerful and the pathetic.” Shame based people become over achievers to hide their lack of self-worth: As they can never find solace in this as external validation can never be truly felt, they burn out or become severely depressed. I know as this was me. No number of degrees or a PhD or being at the top of my profession was enough to find fulfillment, meaning and purpose in line with divine goals. Healing involves understanding these parts of your self, reparenting your self, so that you become the source (the adult you) of the unconditional love that you never received as an unvalidated child. In this way the adult you always shows up, and has no need for their inner critical parent! This is the journey of self-discovery and how it helps heal shame. You no longer carry shame as your superego, or critical parent is no longer needed, your inner child no longer needs external validation, and the adult you always shows up. You have to accept that your inner child did the best they could, unparented and running the show in an adult world. When you show up as your inner child in an adult world you are constantly traumatised. When you show up in an adult world as your adult, you are fearless, boundaried, compassionate and loving. Brené Brown wrote in Daring Greatly “Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.” Spirituality has nothing to do with religion — it simply means looking inside. From that place where we love our inner child, ignore our critical parent, and fully embody our adult self, yet harness the ‘Shadow’ or the darkness of our inner child for their creativity and joy (which only they can provide so we must not put them in a cage — we let they play supervised) we can connect with others in a healthy way. Brené Brown wrote in The Gifts of Imperfection “The dark does not destroy the light; it defines it. It’s our fear of the dark that casts our joy into the shadows.” She continued “Spirituality is recognising and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion. Practicing spirituality brings a sense of perspective, meaning and purpose to our lives.” So, embracing our shame and finding our selves, and harnessing the nuclear reactor that is our inner child, while always showing up as our adult, turns out to be our superpower in this world. Toxic shame can make it difficult to be totally present with others and ourselves. This is understandable: it takes all our energy to protect ourselves from our vulnerability to feel consumed by shame. That energy is the source of drive in overachievers. Imagine making that energy available and releasing that energy in a creative way — you become limitless.\n\nHow does this relate to shame and guilt? Recall a time when you felt ashamed, whether it was as a result of someone else’s judgement or your own. You probably felt a great deal of discomfort, inadequacy and unworthiness, a need to hide, and wrath toward others or yourself. When people are ashamed, the focus of their evaluation is on the self or identity. Psychoanalyst Helen B. Lewis argued that, “The experience of shame is directly about the self, which is the focus of evaluation. In guilt, the self is not the central object of negative evaluation, but rather the thing done is the focus.”\n\nSimilarly, Fossum and Mason say in their book Facing Shame that “While guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one’s actions, shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person.”\n\nFollowing this line of reasoning, Psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman concludes that “Shame is an acutely self-conscious state in which the self is ‘split,’ imagining the self in the eyes of the other; by contrast, in guilt the self is unified.” This emphasises the need for our adult and inner child to unite, as Yin and Yang, to have integrity, which means to be whole again.\n\nThe inner child and the inner critic\n\nPsychologist Kristin Neff suggests that one should have compassion for the inner critic. Paul Gilbert, also a psychologist believes that it is very important to respond to the inner critic in a supportive and kind way. I have to say that this sits ill at ease with me. As we don’t need an inner critic, and they are so nasty, surely it would be better to assertively show them the door? This can be done without resentment. They are incapable of civilised communication. Kristen Neff suggests “Having compassion for the inner critic, thanking it, recognising what it’s doing”. Dr. Ruth Buczynski says “We work toward reducing shame by increasing self-acceptance, even for the parts of ourselves we don’t like.”\n\nI agree with Dr. Ron Siegel, who says “Telling ourselves that we should be nicer to ourselves doesn’t seem to help. It’s only once we can connect with the inner hurt that it gets better.” In recovery one does not need toxic people around you, let alone inside you. Gandhi said “I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.” I’m with Gandhi on this one! Self love does mean dropping resentment but it also means letting go of people who are toxic and vibrate at a different frequency to you. When you love your self you will not tolerate unkindness, although this is done without judgement. When you start to awaken, you realise how toxic certain people are very quickly. I feel very strongly from personal experience than rather than guilt, we want to transmute shame into self-acceptance, love, nurturing, and service to others.\n\nIt is very useful to have meditative coaching sessions where one role plays your compassionate adult self, forgiving your inner child and standing assertively against the inner critic. Walking away from your inner critic is not passive aggressive, it is an assertive act in my view.\n\nThe psychologist Carl Jung (1875–1961) is most commonly considered the first to have coined the term “inner child.” The divine child archetype is one among many defined by Jung, and is an inborn unconscious driver of our behaviour. the inner child archetype is akin to an unconscious subpersonality that consists of what a person learned and experienced in the earliest years of their life. This inner child personality is subordinate to the conscious mind, yet influences this mind. The influence manifests negatively if the inner child is traumatised, wounded or anxious. The role of Jungian psychotherapy is to heal this inner child. Through a process of conscious “reparenting”, psychotherapists assist their patients in recognising the inner child’s trauma and pain. The process of “reparenting” was first introduced by Dr. Lucia Capacchione in the 1970s through her art therapy. By compassionately working with this inner child to teach them new patterns of behaviour, the adult becomes free from the compulsion to act upon the whims of the unruly, subconscious child. We need to meet the needs of the child within us, not put them in a cage.\n\nRoberto Assagioli (1888–1974), founder of the term psycho-synthesis, the study of both personality and soul, inferred that while healing childhood trauma was essential to the healthy development of the ego, human growth was equally dependent on spiritual experience, and the goal of “self-realisation.” This is why recovery and Transformative Life Coaching (TLC) (both essentially based on with finding one’s true self) are essential elements in the 7 steps that I describe in this blog post to finding happiness. Assagioli’s concept of self-actualisation was later made famous by its place at the top of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. PHOTO Maslow’s theory was that once humans have satisfied their basic needs of food, water, and shelter, the actualisation of their full potential can begin to take place.\n\nThese 19th-century psychotherapists would have agreed that “self-actualisation,” the realisation of our full potentiality, also known as enlighte"
