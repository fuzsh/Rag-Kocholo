        "text": "In the movie, Wo Ai Ni Mommy demonstrated that Sadowsky used several ways to help her adopted daughters to appreciate the Chinese heritage. For example, Sadowsky brought Faith to a Chinese school and ask her to continue her Chinese class to keep learning the Chinese language. Also, she was able to meet some other children were Chinese and have adopted by American parents that also provided her a chance to expose other Chinese. In addition, the whole adopt family celebrated the Chinese festival such as Chinese New Year which helps her appreciated the Chinese tradition. Furthermore, Sadowsky let faith talked to her foster parents and foster sister once in a while, which gave her a better motivation to catch up her Chinese identity. In my point of view, Sadowsky let Faith talked to her foster family and greeted them during the Chinese New Year is the most helpful in maintaining Faith’s Chinese identity because it is a unique and meaningful event for Chinese culture. It is a time that all the family members went home for the celebration. It does not only carry the Chinese tradition but also represent Chinese cultural filial spirit. In my own family, we will kneel down and greet the elder people in my family and appreciate how much they did for the family to show our respect. We will practice this custom on the first day of the new year to show our highest esteem for our grandparent\n\nThe movie Dad is centered around a father and son pair, who are brought together and go on the journey of mending their dilapidated relationship.

We have the father and mother with marital disfigurations of attachments, and lack of attachment between themselves and the relationships involving their four adult children and grandchildren. Furthermore, in this paper a description of accepting the shift generational roles and Structural Theory is analyzed and discussed in an article moreover, the Buckman’s family members accept financial responsibility for self and their families. Lastly, the subsystem chosen for the analysis, speculation is Larry.\n\nWhile watching the movie “Parenthood” I took an interest in the character Gary Buckman. Gary is the youngest child to Helen Buckman who is Gil, the main characters, sister. Helen is a single mother who is still struggling with the fact that her ex-husband wants nothing to do with his children and is refusing to help raise them. Gary has an older sister, Julie, who, instead of worrying about SAT scores she is totally wrapped up in her boyfriend Todd, who is a race car wannabe that is not too much liked by Helen.\n\nParenthood (1989) is a movie that deals with family life and the stages of human development. Gil Buckman is the father of three children Kevin, Taylor and Justin Buckman. Also, the husband of Karen Buckman. He works at a firm where he thinks he is on the track for a partnership. He coaches Kevin team in baseball and wants to be a better father than his dad. Also, he cares a lot about what other people think. In this movie Gil goes through a couple of stages dealing with his career, family, household and marriage.\n\nPsychological disorders are very real and present in many people we come in contact with daily, however, are very rarely talked about. Learning about these disorders can help us to understand others and ourselves better by telling us why we do and think the things we do. One effective way that we can observe and learn about psychological disorders is through movies. “Mommie Dearest” was directed by Frank Perry. It is centered around the actress Joan Crawford, who suffered from various psychological disorders. Joan’s daughter, Christina, wrote a book about her mother and her many problems and it was later turned into a movie. It is very effective to use movie analysis as a way of learning, especially in psychology, because it provides a great way to observe without distractions. When you’re looking at disorders, it’s difficult to find a person who has many of these disorders and will allow you to observe them. Psychological disorders can be split into two major groups, personality disorders and mood disorders. Personality disorders are patterns of traits that can get in the way of your social or work life and may interrupt the individual’s normal lifestyle. Mood disorders are inconsistent and unreliable changes in mood by the affected individual. (Rathus, 1998). With all of this being said, it brings me to my point that I will be talking about for the rest of this essay. Joan Crawford demonstrates the personality disorders of histrionic, narcissism, and OCPD. When it comes to mood disorders, Joan demonstrates bipolar disorder.\n\n“Everybody loves babies”, a trademark quote from the documentary movie “Babies” features an insight on the many reasons babies are loved. Although many documentaries are narrated, director Thomas Balmès uses a different approach by eliminating a voiceover. By manifesting this film without narration, he focuses on a learning technique all babies go through in their early stages of life. Aiming for viewers to learn from observation, as babies do, we are left to focus on the babies, their environment and interactions. Through subtitles, this film reveals the different locations the footage of the four newborns are from. By viewing the babies different upbringings from different cultures, we learn how the various lifestyles of each culture impacts a child’s development. The babies are Hattie from California, Mari from Japan, Bayar from Mongolia, and Ponijao from Namibia.The film shows the infancy and toddlerhood period of the babies as well as their development physically, cognitively, and socially.\n\nGil Buckman, the main character, is a 35 year-old father of three living in a typical suburban setting. He works as a sales executive while his wife, Karen, is a stay-at-home mom, caring for their eldest son Kevin, daughter Taylor, and toddler son Justin. Gil is constantly struggling to find balance between his family and career. At work, his ethics are often overlooked and inner office politics seem to favor those with younger personalities over those who work hard. At home, he deals with the strains of parenthood and sometimes admits he sees himself as a failure of a father when they start having problems with his son Kevin. His main priority is to avoid being the type of father his dad was, unavailable and distant. Karen, meanwhile, tries to remain calm and supportive.\n\nIn the film Babies, 4 infants are being observed for the first two years of their lives. Each babies comes from different culture, which shows how the various customs can impact the child’s development. Ponijao is the youngest one in his family and lives in a village in Opuwo Namibia. Bayar lives in Bayanchandmachi, Mongolia. Mari is the first child of a couple who lives in Tokyo Japan, and Hattie lives in Sans Francisco California. The film shows the babies develop cognitively, physically and socially-emotionally, during the infancy and toddler years. The Infancy and toddlerhood period is from birth to 2 years. “This period brings dramatic changes in the body and brain that support the emergence of a wide array of motor, perceptual, and intellectual capacities” (Berk & Meyers, 2016, p.6).\n\n. In today’s society, certain stereotypes have been established towards a myriad of classifications. The separation of gender roles has affected the diplomatic expectation mothers face, whereas Bad Moms (SNX Entertainment), has depicted the standards of a mother in a comical stance. This trailer emphasizes the roles of woman in society during motherhood, moreover, by leaning towards the contrast of a “perfect” mother. Mila Kunis’s character, Amy, is a member of a society that houses the ideal perfect mother. In which, she struggles with following the guidelines that allude to a perfect family. Therefore, a group of friends and Amy liberate themselves from the stereotypical life of a mother after they become too stressed out. In the trailer Bad Moms, the director uses a sundry of visual, diction, and satirical devices to emphasize the overall message of motherhood into the premise of this trailer."
