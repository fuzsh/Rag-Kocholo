        "text": "Some lucky people are born into families they adore spending time with—their loving mutual bonds make holidays and multi-generational vacations a drama-free joy. But for others, simply seeing an incoming call from a parent triggers an anxiety that dates back to childhood, and they leave family gatherings feeling hurt, angry, or exhausted. Toxic family dynamics can have far-reaching impact on our lives as adults.\n\nAnd narcissistic parenting isn’t the only type of toxic family relationship. Fern Schumer Chapman, author of , says that this topic isn’t nearly as talked about. “There’s this expectation that siblings will have sustaining relationships for all of their lives,” she says. “So when you say that you don’t, there’s this question of, ‘is there something wrong with you?”’\n\nThe reality can be much more complicated. Chapman adds that typically, a toxic person is the product of a toxic environment themselves—so they often aren’t even aware of their own harmful patterns. “I always joke that if you have one toxic person in your family, you probably have ten,” she says. “Because that’s what was modeled.” Without intervention, it can be perpetuated further by marrying into other people’s dysfunctional families.\n\nIs someone who you're ideally supposed to be close to actually inspiring an instinct to protect yourself? Here are several signs of a toxic family member, and expert advice on dealing with toxic family—because “drink all of the wine” is not a sustainable plan.\n\nThey make cruelly critical remarks.\n\nNo one's known you longer than your family has, which means they've got a rich back catalog of personal failures to draw from when commenting on your life. Their blunt criticism can wound like a physical jab.\n\n\"Toxic parents exhibit a chronic lack of empathy towards their children,\" says Shannon Thomas, trauma therapist and author of . \"These behaviors can manifest through biting remarks about appearance, relationship status, mental or physical health, financial struggles, or career challenges.\"\n\nEven if they insist they're just teasing, those comments may (even subconsciously) be decimating by design. \"It's hard to imagine a parent intentionally taking cheap shots at their children, but it happens when they're toxic,\" Thomas adds.\n\nThey give you the silent treatment.\n\nYes, words can hurt—but so can their absence. If they refuse to speak to you for hours (or even days) following an argument, it's a form of manipulation. This is true regardless of the family member.\n\n\"Toxic family members are notorious for using silence as a form of punishment and emotional control,\" says Thomas. \"They find power in being pursued for a relationship.”\n\nThey lie—or deny.\n\nEven when it’s a lie that doesn’t involve or affect you directly, lack of clarity about the truth creates confusion and cultivates a distrust that leaves you wondering what else isn’t true—particularly when it happens repeatedly. “They may even cover a lie with another lie,” says Chapman. Denial may also take the form of (patently false) blanket statements like, “we don’t have secrets in this house.”\n\nThey generalize during disagreements.\n\n“Specific details can be debated, but vague accusations are a lot harder to dispute,” Chapman explains. The remarks might sound something like, “it never works out,” or “you always do this.”\n\nThey sow conflict with other family members.\n\nMaybe they flat-out ask you why you can't be more like the brother you've always felt competitive with, or they praise his successes in ways that emphasize where you fall short. Or, they might share something another family member said about you. \"Unhealthy parents will pit their children against one another, or against other members of the family,\" says Thomas. \"They set up scenarios where jealousy and resentment can flourish.\"\n\nThey change the subject to turn the tables on you.\n\nIn an argument, they might deflect attention by bringing up one of your flaws, instead. Chapman offers this example: You tell a loved one you’re concerned about their drug abuse, and they counter with unrelated claims that you’re a bad parent.\n\nThey make you feel bad about feeling bad.\n\nIt can be extremely painful when you’re trying to share your hurt over a grievance—or even abuse, enacted by them or another family member—only to be left feeling like you hurt them by bringing it up. They may cry or lash out with righteous anger. Or, they may say something like, “Why can’t you let that go?,” effectively minimizing your negative experiences.\n\nThey move the goal posts.\n\n“Manipulative people often shift the criteria that people have to meet in order to satisfy them,” says Chapman. “It’s very uncomfortable, because just when you think you’ve achieved what they wanted, it’s not good enough.”\n\nThey use threats, harsh language, or violence.\n\nThis may seem like the most obvious sign of a toxic relationship, but not if it's always been normalized as part of your family dynamic. There’s never any situation in which name-calling or physical intimidation and other forms of domestic violence are justified, and if you fear for your safety, help is available.\n\nThey’re a master of passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nThis can include guilt trips and backhanded compliments, Chapman says, along with nonverbal communication such as rolled eyes and sighs.\n\nThey make your business your great-aunt Lydia's business.\n\nA blossoming relationship just ended, and though you had no reason to feel embarrassed, you didn't want the whole world to know about your romantic disappointment. Enter your mother, who's spilled your tale as a way to bond (or worse, share a laugh) with someone else.\n\nAccording to Thomas, it's not uncommon for a toxic family member to breach your confidence. \"They'll often share personal information or life struggles with whoever they deem worthy of knowing, with little-to-no regard for how these breaches of trust impact their children's emotional well-being.\"\n\nThey gaslight you.\n\nA term inspired by the 1944 Ingrid Bergman film , gaslighting is a type of emotional abuse in which someone causes the victim to doubt their own understanding of reality. “They deny that the abuse is really happening,” says Chapman. “It’s confusing and overwhelming, because all the sudden you’re doubting that what you see and feel is real.”\n\nExamples she offers include a sibling insisting your childhood experiences weren’t as bad as you remember, or a family member point-blank saying something like, “that didn’t happen—you’re making things up, as usual.”\n\nThey ignore boundaries.\n\nSetting healthy boundaries is crucial in healthy relationships; these can range from “please don’t call me at work” to asking other family members to respect the rules that you set for your kids. If your wishes aren’t being respected by someone who doesn’t think the boundaries apply to them, it can make you feel like you’re not being respected.\n\nThey play the blame game.\n\nA parent, sibling, or other family member may often place blame for anything that’s wrong on someone else—possibly you, included. While their actions or behavior may not be the sole reason for a given issue, regularly refusing to take any accountability is a red flag.\n\nA toxic sibling may \"side with\" your parent.\n\nIn a well-adjusted family dynamic, there's usually no such thing as \"taking sides.\" But when someone learns poor relationship patterns from a parent, they may try to earn that parent's affection by replicating those patterns and thus normalizing harmful behavior.\n\n\"Toxic siblings often become a supporter of an equally toxic parent,\" Thomas says. \"They'll use similar critical language as the parent, and shame the targeted sibling regarding areas of life they might be feeling vulnerable about.\"\n\nFostering or playing into a competitive dynamic that's meant to make you feel bad is another type of toxic sibling behavior, as is conveniently forgetting your invite to family get-togethers. \"Their goal is to send the clear message that you're not included on purpose, and they'll often gloat about what a wonderful event it was,\" Thomas explains.\n\nBeware of repeating toxic patterns with others.\n\nYou didn’t choose the family you were raised in, but you can make sure you don't invite new toxic influences into your life by assuming the poor ways they treat you are acceptable. \"If one or both parents who raised you exhibited significantly unhealthy traits, your ability to assess red flags in the people you meet will be negatively impacted,\" says Thomas.\n\n\"Without true insight on how our family environment created relational blind spots, we run a high risk of repeating toxic patterns from childhood,\" she continues. \"These could include people-pleasing tendencies, difficulty controlling your anger, or being emotionally unavailable in adult relationships.\" Auditing your relationships' health through self-examination and the assistance of a mental health professional can help you avoid recreating the toxicity.\n\nBefore telling a toxic family member how they make you feel, try this.\n\nIf you don't feel that their behavior is extreme enough to warrant cutting off contact—or you’re simply not ready to take that extreme step—you may be tempted to call them out, in an effort to break the cycle. Just be sure to manage your expectations of the conversation: Definitely don't assume you'll get an outright apology, or a sudden improvement in your dynamic. In fact, they may wind up pushing your buttons harder than ever.\n\n\"The toxic individual will often attempt to bring a heightened level of emotions to the conversation,\" Thomas says. \"On the other side of the spectrum, they might refuse to discuss your concerns.\" To help keep your conversation even-keeled and on track, Thomas suggests making a list of the person's most hurtful offenses and sticking to your talking points.\n\nDetachment is crucial.\n\nYou have no control over someone else's behavior, but you can work on your own reaction to it. When going no-contact isn't an option that you're willing or able to choose, Thomas recommends forging an emotional boundary with what she calls \"detached contact.\"\n\n\"Detached contact centers on our ability to be physically present, but not emotionally wounded by the actions of a family member,\" Thomas explains. \"We consciously recognize the psychological games they're playing to get a reaction out of us, but we refuse to engage in the toxicity.\" Instead, she says, invest your energy in healthier family members who treat you with respect, and \"deflect all attempts by the toxic person to engage in an argument or drama.\" Placing distance between your emotions and their chaos-sowing tactics isn't simple, but it does get easier with practice.\n\nWant more stories to inspire you to live your best life?

It’s certainly not the sole option for every turbulent family bond (see the other possible paths above), nor is it the right option for everyone. It also doesn’t always have to be permanent; in her book, Chapman writes about the long road to successfully repairing her relationship with her own long-estranged brother.\n\nBut as Thomas points out, certain situations require it—especially when previous attempts to improve relations are unsuccessful. No-contact becomes an option to consider if the situation is significantly impacting your mental health. \"An increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, addictions, and mood instability are all signs of necessary distance from a toxic family member,\" Thomas says.\n\n\"It's an intensely painful experience to face the necessity of cutting a family member out of our lives,\" she continues. \"It's a figurative death with complex grief, because the family member is still living but emotionally unsafe.\"\n\nAnother reason people may choose to protect themselves with a no-contact rule is out of fear that their own children will be exposed to the same unacceptable behaviors or outright abuse. As Thomas notes, \"Toxic parents frequently become toxic grandparents.\""
