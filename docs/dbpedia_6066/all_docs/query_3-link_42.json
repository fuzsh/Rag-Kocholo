        "text": "I was around 6 years old when I first watched Disney's original animated “Mulan.”\n\nI was too young to realize how rare it would be to see part of my culture reflected in a mainstream movie. But as I grew up and saw less and less of myself portrayed in the media that I watched, “Mulan” was a film that I revisited and clung to as something that I could identify with.\n\nAs a Taiwanese-American who was born in America and raised in Singapore, I often struggled with defining my identity and balancing the values that came with each culture.\n\nI remember when I was young, I'd used a retort on my parents that I'd heard and found funny in an American TV show and received a scolding for being disrespectful. Implicit boundaries like this reminded me of the difference in cultures.\n\n\"Mulan” resonated with me, not only because it features a brave and self-reliant heroine from China, but because its themes of family, filial piety and responsibility were ones that were emphasized to me off-screen, in my own home.\n\nReview: No singing, more sword-swinging in Disney's new and improved 'Mulan'\n\nWho is Yifei Liu? Meet Disney's new 'Mulan'\n\nFilial piety has a deep history in Chinese culture: It's the belief that it’s the child’s duty to obey, respect and care for their parents because they have given them life and raised them. It played a large role in establishing order and hierarchy in traditional Chinese society and is still prevalent today, though less overtly.\n\nFor me, it manifested in how my parents raised me. Showing respect for my elders and listening to my parents was often an unspoken expectation, and in doing so, I was expressing my love for them.\n\nSo before watching the new adaptation on Disney+, I was nervous. I worried if this version of “Mulan” would still be something that I could connect to.\n\nTo my delight, the live-action remake places filial piety at the forefront of Mulan’s story, making it just as important of a value as bravery, loyalty and all the other virtues that make Mulan a heroine worth looking up to.\n\nIn place of songs like “Honor to Us All” and “Reflection” are real conversations with her family regarding their expectations of her, which echo conversations I’ve had with my own family.\n\nRanked: All the Disney live-action remakes (including 'Mulan')\n\n'I was tortured to death every day': How 'Mulan's Jason Scott Lee got ripped playing villain Böri Khan\n\nAs I watched Mulan forge her own path while struggling to balance her love for her family with her own identity, it was gratifying to see her be not only accepted, but celebrated, for being who she was without having to choose one or the other.\n\nIt made me believe that, like Mulan, I could prevail as an individual and stay true to myself while still respecting and upholding the values of my family.\n\nBoth versions of the movie greatly simplify filial piety. In the new film, it is sometimes used as an archaic and patriarchal tool to constrain Mulan into stereotypical roles of obedient daughter and dutiful wife.\n\nYet lines from the movie such as “They have failed to raise a good daughter” reflect the underlying pressures of family and the weight that words like “honor” and “shame” hold in a way that hit home and brought tears to my eyes regardless.\n\n'Mulan' on Disney+: How to watch it\n\nTwo scenes that bookend the movie stuck out to me the most: When her father tells a still-young Mulan, “Your job is to bring honor to the family,” and when, now older and a hero, she returns home and is honored for her filial piety in equal measure with her other merits.\n\nIt comes perfectly full circle in a way that a fairy tale should. And it's a fitting ending for the message that I so cherished growing up: Filial piety and individualism can exist side-by-side, and Mulan is far stronger and more admirable for having both."
