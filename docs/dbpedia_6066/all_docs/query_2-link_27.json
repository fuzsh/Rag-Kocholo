This idealized depiction of familial life was not intended to serve as an objective reflection of the majority of American families nor as a barometer of the potential dangers that awaited children in the real world. Instead, children's literature of the era—picture books, easy readers, chapter books, novels—was solely intended as escapist entertainment that occasionally reinforced simple moral lessons. At the height of this trend in the 1950s, the problems faced by the protagonist of a children's book were often no more intense than the threat posed by a bully, the sadness of a friend moving away, or at its worst, the death of a pet, all of which could be fixed by the calming presence of one's parents. Realistic social difficulties such as abandonment, divorce, separation, or the death of a parent were deemed inappropriate for children and reserved exclusively for the sphere of adults.\n\nAlthough the children's literature of mid-twentieth century America was largely characterized by these well-intentioned whitewashings of the family ideal, on the converse, the popular children's literature of the late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century featured numerous examples of unconventional families, particularly in regards to orphaned or near-orphaned children. The most notable of these works include Anne of Green Gables (1908) by L. M. Montgomery, Little Orphan Annie, a comic serial begun in 1924 by Harold Gray based on James Whitcomb Riley's poem, Heidi (1880) by Joanna Spyri, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1903) by Kate Douglas Wiggin, and Pollyanna (1913) by Eleanor H. Porter. The popularity of these stories have endured into the modern era, in part due to their elaborately positive depictions of children overcoming devastating loss in order to create new families from the mixed assortment of individuals now forced to care for them. The protagonists of these narratives rarely address the typical emotions of grief and loss experienced by real-life orphaned children and instead immediately begin working on happily and willfully breaking down their distant and aloof new guardians, helping them evolve into wise and nurturing parental figures. While the children's literature of the 1950s promoted nuclear families to an idealized extreme, such children's works as Heidi and Pollyana portrayed orphans and the death of a parent in a similarly exaggerated fashion.\n\nHowever, sparked by the social revolution of the 1960s, demand began to arise for new depictions of realistic family situations in juvenile and young adult literature. During this period, authors, many from nontraditional backgrounds themselves, realized that children were being underestimated in their capacity to grasp difficult concepts and unpleasant situations. But more importantly, writers of the era recognized that books could be used to help children understand that different, unconventional, or unusual family situations were often positive and more common than previously expected. There was a growing recognition that wholesale presentations of stereotypically nuclear families held the potential to inflict damage on the self-esteem of children raised by alternative families by reinforcing the belief that they were somehow different. To counter this sentiment and as a result of the burgeoning societal shift, a diversifying body of nontraditional children's works began to appear on the market. For example, in Lucille Clifton's picture book Some of the Days of Everett Anderson (1970), the title character has a happy, normal daily existence with one caveat—his father has passed away. Clifton does not draw negative attention to Everett's single-parent family, instead presenting his situation as completely normal. In picture books from this era aimed at pre-school and early-elementary audiences, there is a definite emphasis on showing that different and unconventional families can be just as good as any two-parent household. However, nontraditional families do have certain distinct family events that are unique to their situations, and many young adult novels of this period attempt to deal with these issues in an empathetic manner. Norma Klein's Mom, the Wolf Man, and Me (1972) relates the story of a single mother and her daughter, Scratcher, and their uncertainty over whether to allow the mom's new suitor—the Wolf Man, as Scratcher christens him—into their lives. Similarly, books attempting to cover the broad spectrum of family arrangements began to arise after the 1960s, from children living with their grandparents to stories of adoption and stepfamilies.\n\nAs they increased in availability and popularity, parents, even those in traditional two-parent homes, began to recognize the value of such books, realizing that these texts could be used to prepare children, particularly those reaching their teen years, for the difficult situations that may arise as they grow older. Mary Stoltz's The Edge of Next Year (1974), for instance, chronicles a family's grieving as they struggle with the sudden, unexpected death of their mother, leaving them functioning in a new environment as a single-parent household. Dear Mr. Henshaw (1983) by Beverly Cleary, a Newbery award-winning novel, relates Leigh Bott's eventual acceptance of his parent's divorce and the effects resulting from such a major adjustment. For the title character of The Great Gilly Hopkins (1978), Katherine Paterson's impassioned examination of a foster child, life has been terribly unfair. Abandoned by her flower-child mother, shuttled between three foster homes, and now moving against her wishes to live with her grandmother whom she does not know, Gilly has become an embittered and tough child. But in the spirit of the new realism, this near-orphan finds that life has no easy answers, and she resists anyone's attempts to truly love her—even rejecting Trotter, a rough-hewed foster mother who reaches out to her. Over the course of this sensitive treatment, Gilly meets her real mother—now herself beaten down by life—and eventually makes the first tentative steps towards accepting Trotter's affection, ultimately choosing to live with Trotter over her own grandmother.\n\nThe late seventies and early eighties saw a wave of new children's fiction where the teen protagonists are subjected to misunderstanding parents who themselves are capable of greatly disappointing their children. Paul Zindel's canon, particularly Confessions of a Teenage Baboon (1977) where a father suddenly deserts his family, is particularly evocative of this sense of adult failure, though Zindel is by no means alone in writing in this paradigmatic model. Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat (1989) features a set of separated parents unable to look past their own interests for the sake of their child or themselves, leading to an eventual drug overdose by the depressed father. Cynthia Voigt's Homecoming (1981) describes the travails of the four Tillerman children who find themselves homeless and living under a bridge when their mother abandons them. Almost single-handedly, the oldest—thirteen-year-old Dicey—leads her siblings to a happy ending, despite the attempted interference of adults whose threats to separate the children into different foster homes is one of the primary dangers of the narrative. Though some critics have decried the presumed devaluation of the adult presence in this variety of juvenile novel, others point to the fact that the books encourage and illustrate the personal strength apparent in the protagonists, as well as their ability to allow teenagers the necessary push to form identities separate from that of their parents. And ultimately, as undependable as most of the adults appear, the children do discover that role models and strong parental figures are still available and needed to navigate the real world.\n\nIn the 1990s and beyond, as family units have become even more diverse, children's novels have begun to reflect these new realities. Books featuring the extended family, the multi-racial family, the blended family, and families with a non-parent as the head of the household have appeared, depicting such lives as normal and happy, resembling the children's novels of the 1960s, but now suited to show the incredible diversity of modern society. Children's books representing gay and lesbian families, such as the seemingly ubiquitous and controversial Heather Has Two Mommies (1989) by Lesléa Newman, have become more prevalent as the issue has come to the forefront. While not generally regarded as a strong work of literature, Heather Has Two Mommies represents a new field in children's literature, and though the debate over gay families remains a point of contention, newer age-appropriate books where the idea is presented as a fundamental matter-of-fact, like Michael Wilhoit's Daddy's Roommate (1990) and Daddy's Wedding (1996), are becoming more and more commonplace in libraries and children's bookshelves.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE WORKS\n\nJanet Ahlberg\n\nStarting School [illustrations by Allan Ahlberg] (picture book) 1988\n\nFrancesca Lia Block\n\nWeetzie Bat (young adult novel) 1989\n\nJudy Blume\n\nIt's Not the End of the World (young adult novel) 1972\n\nSusanne Bösche\n\nJenny Lives with Eric and Martin (easy reader) 1983\n\nJudith Caseley\n\nWhen Grandpa Came to Stay (picture book) 1986\n\nBeverly Cleary\n\nDear Mr. Henshaw [illustrations by Paul O.

Columbus, Ohio: Merrill Publishing Company, 1987.\n\n[In the following excerpt, Norton compares and contrasts how writers have portrayed traditional, divorced, and single-parent families in children's literature.]\n\nFamily Life\n\nThe family stories of the late 1930s through the early 1960s depict some of the strongest, warmest family relationships in contemporary realistic fiction for children. Today's children still enjoy the warmth and humor represented by the families in Elizabeth Enright's Thimble Summer, Eleanor Estes's The Moffats, Sydney Taylor's All-of-a-Kind Family, and Madeleine L'Engle's Meet the Austins. The characters' actions suggest that security is gained by family members working together, that each member has responsibility to other members, that consideration for others is desirable, and that family unity and loyalty can overcome hard times and peer conflicts.\n\nSince the early 1960s, many changes have taken place in realistic fiction's characterization of the American family. Authors writing in the 1970s and 1980s have often focused on the need to overcome family disturbances, as children and adults adjust to new social realities. Death of one or both parents, foster families, single-parent families, children of unmarried females, the disruptions caused by divorce and remarriage, and child abuse are some of the issues related to children and their families that now appear in contemporary realistic fiction for children.\n\nThis literature may help children realize that many types of family units other than the traditional one are common and legitimate in our society today. Children may also see that problems often can be solved if family members work together. Even when depicting the most disturbing of relationships, authors of realistic fiction may show a family's strong need for unity and desire to keep at least some of its members together.\n\nAuthors of realistic stories about family disturbances use several literary techniques to create credible plots and characters. Often they focus on painful and potentially destructive situations and feelings that are common in society today. These situations are usually familiar to readers who may have experienced similar situations, who may have known someone who had such experiences, or who may fear that they will have similar experiences. Authors often tell these stories from the perspective of the child or children involved. First-person or limited omniscient point of view from a child's perspective can be very successful in depicting child characters' emotional and behavioral reactions as they first discover a problem, experience a wide range of personal difficulties and emotions as they try to change or understand the situation, and finally arrive at an acceptance of the situation. Characterization may portray the vulnerability of the characters, create sympathy for them, and describe how they handle the jolting disruptions and personal discoveries that affect their lives. Symbolism and allusion may emphasize a conflict and characterization. Authors often use characters' reactions to change, trouble, and new discoveries to trace the characters' development of better relationships with others or positive personal growth. Some authors, however—such as those trying to make a point about child abuse—use specific situations or discoveries to allow children to escape from all reality. A family member may be the antagonist in these realistic stories about family life, or the antagonist may be an outside force, such as death of a parent, divorce, or moving to a new location. To relieve the impact of painful situations, authors may add humor to characterization or plot development. Humor can make a situation bearable, create sympathy for a character, or clarify the nature of a confrontation.\n\nDivorce and Remarriage\n\nIn Peggy Mann's My Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel, Joey experiences a series of strong emotional reactions to his parents' divorce. First he believes the separation is his fault. Mann develops the strength of these feelings through Joey's actions: he makes out a list of promises he will keep if his father returns and delivers them to his father. When his promises have no effect on the situation, Joey's emotional reactions change; he goes through a period of hating his father and feeling very confused. Mann suggests that Joey accepts the change in his family life when he can enjoy being with his father during their Sunday visits.\n\nIn Dear Mr. Henshaw, Beverly Cleary effectively uses letters and diary entries written by her sixth-grade hero, Leigh Botts, to develop believable characterization and plot and to show changes in Leigh as he begins to accept the actuality of his parent's divorce. As a classroom assignment, Leigh sends his favorite author a list of ten questions. Mr. Henshaw answers Leigh's questions, but also sends Leigh a list of ten questions that he wants Leigh to answer about himself. At first Leigh refuses to answer the questions. Then his mother insists that because Mr. Henshaw answered Leigh's questions Leigh must answer Mr. Henshaw's questions. The answers to the questions allow Cleary an opportunity to provide important background information and to reveal Leigh's personal feelings about himself, his family, and his parents' divorce. Eventually Leigh begins to write a diary—both because Mr. Henshaw suggests it and because Leigh's mother refuses to fix the television. By midpoint in the book, the diary entries begin to change and Leigh realizes changes in his own character:\n\nI don't have to pretend to write to Mr. Henshaw anymore. I have learned to say what I think on a piece of paper. And I don't hate my father either. I can't hate him. Maybe things would be easier if I could.\n\n(p. 73)\n\nThe entries seem believable because Cleary includes both humorous and painful experiences that are important in Leigh's life.\n\nIn The Animal, the Vegetable, and John D. Jones, author Betsy Byars focuses on three children's reactions to painful changes in the family. Clara and Deanie's father asks the widow he loves and her son to share a summer vacation with him and his daughters. The two sisters, who had been experiencing sibling rivalry, now confront an outside antagonist in the person of a boy named John D. Byars describes him as a worthy opponent: he is bright, sophisticated, conceited, and writing a book of advice for his inferiors, who, incidentally, are all other children. John D. is also vulnerable, however, and perhaps sensitive; his book is about functioning in a hostile world. Byars describes a series of incidents that emphasize the parents' dilemma, imply their inability to handle the situation, and create sympathy for the characters. Whenever the adults plan a happy excursion something goes wrong: at a cookout the only edible hamburger falls in the sand; during a visit to an amusement park Clara escapes her family only to become sick after riding the Space Cyclone and then seeing John D. with a huge sundae. Although Byars's descriptions of these situations are humorous, the story contains some hostile undercurrents. Byars uses a near tragedy to focus the attention of all the characters on the importance of others. Their reactions indicate that they have learned a great deal about interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn Carol Lea Benjamin's The Wicked Stepdog, twelve-year-old Lou is afraid of losing her father's love when he presents her with a new stepmother and a new \"stepdog.\" Benjamin's first-person narrative from Lou's viewpoint emphasizes Lou's sometimes painful and sometimes humorous reactions to her changed family. Lou's changing responses to her stepmother's golden retriever symbolize her gradual acceptance of new circumstances. At first she hates to walk the dog, but by the end of the story, when she meets a boy who also walks a dog, stepdog-walking has become one of Lou's favorite pasttimes.\n\nSingle-Parent Families\n\nSingle-parent families have always existed, but recent realistic fiction for children portrays such families more often, and sometimes more candidly, than did most realistic fiction in the past. In contemporary novels for children, some of these families are doing quite well, while others face serious problems due to the lack of a mother's or a father's emotional and economic support.\n\nA family's struggle to survive without one parent is a popular plot in contemporary realistic fiction. Authors may suggest that the experience strengthens the children in the family or that the experience causes so many difficulties that the children find coping impossible. In Vera and Bill Cleaver's Where the Lilies Bloom, a fourteen-year-old girl experiences conflict between her desire to keep a promise she made her dying father and her developing realization that she must break that promise in order to ensure her family's survival. Although Mary Call's father dies quite early in the plot, the Cleavers characterize him plausibly as a person who lives by a strong moral and family code. He demands that his daughter take pride in the family name, instill that pride in her brothers and sisters, and hold the family together without accepting charity. Later, this promise becomes a crucial element of the plot and in Mary Call's character development. The authors develop a believable and interesting conflict as Mary Call tries to do as her father demanded, but gradually realizes that she must accept help if she is to gain the knowledge she needs and improve her family's welfare. This story lacks sentimentality; Mary Call recognizes her father's weaknesses and eventually realizes that his judgment about his oldest daughter and the despised neighbor, Kaiser Pease, was in error. The authors lighten the almost insurmountable odds against survival by adding touches of humor. This is especially true in the sequel, Trial Valley, as a more mature Mary Call copes with both family problems and expectant suitors. (Students of children's literature may find it interesting to compare the characteristics of this contemporary female protagonist with the Victorian female protagonist in Charlotte Yonge's The Daisy Chain.)\n\nIn Marilyn Sachs's The Bears' House, detailed portrayal of a harsh reality is crucial to give the plot and the protagonist's responses full credibility. Five children live a crowded apartment; their mother is emotionally disturbed, and their father deserts the family. The children's distrust of the adult world is expressed through their fear of being placed in foster homes and their need to lie to their social worker. Sachs contrasts the harsh reality of nine-year-old Fran Ellen's life with the beautiful make-believe place of her fantasies. When she sits in front of the dollhouse in her fourth-grade classroom, she can visit the Bear family and sit on Pappa Bear's lap when she feels unhappy. The conclusion of the story illustrates that contemporary realistic fiction may not have a \"happy ever after\" ending: Fran Ellen withdraws into her make-believe world, where she has found her own way to survive in frightening and bewildering circumstances.\n\nIn The Night Swimmers, Betsy Byars uses a painful and possibly destructive situation to highlight a young girl's personal and social development and her acceptance of difficult discoveries. Retta's mother has died. She and her younger brothers are being reared by their father, who works nights and is more concerned about developing his career as a singer/composer than about attending to his children. Byars chronicles Retta's personal growth by describing her feelings after her mother's death, the moment when she understands her father's career goals (in reaction to her mother's death he composed a hit song, but did not pay attention to the children), her changing feelings as she tries to be a mother to her two younger brothers, and her final realization that she must accept her father as he is, not as she would like him to be. Byars uses humor to highlight some of these situations and to focus on the painful moments: Retta discovers how a mother should act by observing mothers in the supermarket; she gains cooking skills by watching television commercials. Retta's and her younger brother Roy's reactions to their own final discoveries may be the most poignant moments in the book. Roy discovers that the Bowlwater Plant is not the enormous and wondrous vegetation of his imagination, but is a smelly and ugly chemical factory. Retta realizes that their father is so obsessed with stardom that he cannot relate to his children in the way Retta would like. Roy expresses their discoveries effectively when he compares swallowing a hard truth about life with Popeye swallowing his spinach: both experiences make you stronger.\n\nIn Mom, the Wolf Man, and Me, Norma Klein creates a close and somewhat offbeat relationship between a girl and her mother, a professional photographer. Eleven-year-old Brett accepts the fact that her mother and father never married, enjoys her unconventional life, accompanies her mother on peace marches, and has frank discussions with her. (Some parents react negatively to the frank discussions about premarital sex in this book.) Only when her mother meets the Wolf Man and considers marriage does Brett experience fear and confusion. She is afraid her happy life will change and unsuccessfully tries to convince her mother and the Wolf Man that they should not marry. Hila Colman creates a different mother-daughter relationship in Tell Me No Lies. When twelve-year-old Angela learns that her mother was unmarried when Angela was born, Angela hates her mother for lying and runs away to find her father. Colman uses this experience to create an atmosphere in which the girl can understand and forgive her mother. When she finds her father, she discovers he is not like her dreams; in fact, he cannot accept her as his daughter. This turning point in the novel allows Angela to return home with new understanding. Both of these stories depict changes from the realistic fiction of the 1950s. The family structures, life-styles, expressed values, and types of problems reflect contemporary concerns and issues.\n\nSuzanne Bunkers (essay date 1992)\n\nSOURCE: Bunkers, Suzanne. \"'We are Not the Cleavers': Images of Nontraditional Families in Children's Literature.\" Lion and the Unicorn 16, no. 1 (1992): 115-33.\n\n[In the following essay, Bunkers presents a critical appraisal of examples of unconventional families in children's literature, providing a bibliographical introduction to current fiction emphasizing nontraditional family structures.]\n\nI grew up in what many would call a traditional family; that is, one composed of two married, heterosexual parents and biological children.1 My mother did virtually all the housework and cared for the five children in our three-bedroom rambler, while my father worked as a rural mail carrier. In our town of 400 in rural Iowa, divorce was nonexistent, single parenthood occurred only through the death of one's spouse, \"illegitimacy\" was extremely shameful, and adoption took place as a last resort for those married couples whom God had not blessed with \"natural\" children.\n\nToday I live in a nontraditional family. I am the single parent of a six-year-old daughter, Rachel. Along with our three cats, we live in an older two-story house in a working-class neighborhood of Mankato, a town of about 45,000 in south-central Minnesota. Rachel's father and I never married; her primary home is with me, and she spends occasional weekends with her father in a nearby town.\n\nLike many of you, I grew up steeped in the adventures of Dick, Jane, Sally, Mother, Father, Spot, Puff, and Tim. Typical stories in readers like Helen Robinson et al.'s Fun Wherever We Are (1962), had titles like \"Come and Ride,\" \"Look in Here,\" \"Will Spot Run Away?\", and \"Do Something Funny.\"2 As a child, I quickly learned that a proper family had two married, heterosexual parents with clearly defined gender roles; children of both sexes; clean and docile pets; and money enough for a house in the suburbs, a late-model automobile, and family vacations. It never occurred to me to question this model until much later, when I discovered that not every family had two parents, that not all parents were heterosexual and/or married, that not all families were biologically constituted, and that not all children and pets were polite and obedient.\n\nThis discovery led to my search for children's books that depicted the wide variety of families that I knew existed.3 I will note at the outset that I have not undertaken a scientific search. Rather, I have sampled the children's books available in my community and university libraries as well as those carried by local and regional bookstores. In addition, I have sampled the children's books in our family library, with an awareness that those books reflect an interest in many kinds of family structures. My hypothesis is that images of nontraditional families in children's books have increased greatly in recent years, mirroring the greater visibility of nontraditional families in our culture, and that this development is a healthy one.\n\nBased on my analysis of approximately one hundred children's books, what observations can I make about images of nontraditional families in popular literature for children?4 First and most importantly, the families depicted in these books are decidedly not like that of June and Ward Cleaver. Many are single-parent families; some are stepfamilies; others are extended families including several generations; some are adoptive and foster families. Some recent stories portray a grandparent, aunt, or uncle who has sole responsibility for his or her grandchild, niece, or nephew. Children's books are beginning to acknowledge the fact that not all families are constituted heterosexually; lesbian and gay families figure in several of the books I've sampled. More books are being written about families in which physical, mental, and emotional challenges play a central role. Unemployment, poverty, sexual abuse, and the deaths of family members are all subjects dealt with in children's books published during the past ten to twenty years. In some families, individuals of all ages live together, unrelated biologically or adoptively. In other cases, older persons lovingly care for children who visit rather than live with them.\n\nIn contemporary children's books, parent figures are not always protective; children are not always nice; life is not always easy; difficulties are not always overcome. In short, children's books are breaking silences about subjects that were rarely, if ever, explored in depth in the popular literature of earlier days. Nineteenth-century favorites such as Susan Warner's The Wide, Wide World, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Louisa May Alcott's Little Women (all of which addressed family problems) were predicated on the model of the heterosexual, marital, nuclear family. Their structures followed the classic pattern: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. Story lines hinged on the problems resulting in adults' and childrens' lives when the \"model family\" broke down, and the resolutions of such stories depended on the restoration of that model. A \"happy ending\" necessarily meant that the reconstituted heterosexual, marital, nuclear family prevailed. Not so today.\n\nOne significant kind of children's book published during the past fifteen to twenty years deals with children's responses to divorce. Beth Goff's Where Is Daddy? The Story of a Divorce (1969) describes the reactions of a preschool girl, Janeydear, to her parents' divorce. Fears of abandonment, hostile outbursts, sorrow and grief—all are experienced by Janeydear, whose mother and father try, despite their own distress, to ease those feelings. Although the final line of the story is, \"Janeydear felt much better,\" readers young and old know how deeply her parents' divorce has shaken the little girl.\n\nMy Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel (1973), by Peggy Mann, How Does It Feel When Your Parents Get Divorced? (1977), by Terry Berger, and Mommy and Daddy Are Divorced (1978), by Patricia Perry all try to show, through children's eyes, the adjustments that family members must make when a divorce occurs. In all three stories, the father moves out of the family home, and the children are at first afraid and then angry. Photographs and illustrations are essential to each story; readers view the parents arguing, the children looking forlorn, and finally the family members regaining their ability to feel happy again. Statements like \"It didn't feel good to see Daddy go, but we knew that we would see him again soon\" (from Mommy and Daddy) and \"Although my parents no longer live together, their feelings for me are the same\" (from How Does It Feel) reinforce the primary message in each book: divorce does occur; shock, sadness, anger, and acceptance are normal; life goes on.\n\nTwo more recent books deal with additional complexities found in the divorced family. In Kathy Stinson's Mom and Dad Don't Live Together Any More (1984), the little girl who tells the story moves with her mother and brother to an apartment in the city and visits her father at the family's house in the country on weekends. During the course of the story, she learns that she cannot make her parents happy, despite her desire to, and that her parents both love her, but \"just not together.\" Michael Prokop's Divorce Happens to the Nicest Kids (1986), is a self-help book for children and adults. It attempts to dispel such myths as \"kids are the cause of the divorce,\" \"kids cannot be happy living with one parent,\" and \"kids can solve their parents' problems and save their parents' marriage.\" Along with illustrations, it provides a useful glossary of terms related to divorce (e.g., confusion, counselor, guilt, shame, tension). The increasing number of children's books that deal with the subject of divorce reflect our culture's need to provide guidance for children who must come to terms with families that split apart.\n\nBooks about stepfamilies, increasingly visible in American culture, raise intriguing questions about the roles of adults and children in what have been euphemistically called \"blended\" families. Several of these stories also incorporate variations on the stereo-types of the wicked stepmother and the tyrannical stepfather. Betty Ren Wright's My New Mom and Me (1981) traces the stages in a young Hispanic girl's adjustment to her mother's death and her father's remarriage. Of her new stepmother, the narrator says: \"The first day that Elena came to our apartment to live, she tried to hug me. I wouldn't let her.\" The family cat's disappearance and subsequent rescue by Elena convinces the girl that it's all right to love her stepmother: \"Then [Elena] put her arm around me, and I leaned against her. It felt good—better than I had expected.\" Significantly, the girl's mother has died, not divorced her father, and the implication is that Elena will now mother the girl rather than have to compete with the \"real\" mother for the daughter's love and attention. Nonetheless, My New Mom and Me attempts to deal candidly with the conflicting emotions a child feels when asked to accept a new parental figure.\n\nQuite a different scenario emerges in Happily Ever After … Almost (1982), by Judie Wolkoff. This adolescent novel is narrated by Kitty; her parents have divorced, and each has married someone else. The story centers on a Caucasian family in which sisters, half-sisters, half-brothers, and stepbrothers figure prominently. The novel chronicles the first year of Kitty's mother and stepfather's marriage. The opening lines of the story set its tone: \"Well, we made it! We survived our first year. We're alive and well—at least nobody's hospitalized at the moment.\" Central to the novel is Kitty and her sister Sarah's growing acceptance of R. J., their new stepbrother. While the story is basically upbeat, it does contain one unpleasant character: R. J.'s mother Kay, the wicked ex-wife (a variation on the wicked stepmother) who eventually relinquishes custody of her son to her ex-husband and moves to London. This is one of only a few stories depicting a custodial father; unfortunately, it reinforces the stereotype that a mother who relinquishes custody of her child must be a nasty person.\n\nNorma Klein's adolescent novel, Mom, the Wolf Man, and Me (1972), incorporates both the stepfamily and the single-parent motifs. Eleven-year-old Brett knows that her mother has never been married and states: \"The only part that I really mind about Mom not being married is when people ask questions. Otherwise we have a good time, better in some ways than lots of my friends who have mothers and fathers\" (16). Brett's first reaction to her mother's news that she will marry Theo (the Wolf Man) is \"I really felt horribly sick. I can't even describe it\" (149). Overwhelmed by all the changes that she knows will take place, Brett wonders at the end of the story what her \"new life\" will be like.\n\nBrett's perspective is far more somber and less optimistic than Kitty's; the two novels balance one another in their portrayals of adolescent girls' adjustments to becoming members of stepfamilies. Both novels, however, verify that stepfamily relationships are fragile and complex, and that no hard and fast rules exist for the way a stepfamily ought to function.5\n\nThis same theme runs throughout Barbara Seuling's What Kind of Family Is This? A Book about Stepfamilies (1985).6 The opening sentence of the story asks the reader to imagine what it might be like to become part of a stepfamily. The story follows the experiences of Jeff, whose mother has remarried and whose stepfather, Henry, brings two children, Samantha and Scott, to the newly \"blended\" family. Jeff is angry that he has to wait to use the bathroom. He and Scott argue over having to share a bedroom. Finally, Jeff screams at his mother: \"What kind of family is this? I don't have any privacy. I don't want to be here! Why do we have to live here anyway?\" His mother's reply, \"It takes time, but you'll get used to it,\" does little to satisfy Jeff. The rest of the story follows all five members of the stepfamily as they slowly learn how to live together.\n\nStories dealing with gay and lesbian families are not often found in bookstores or libraries. Apparently, few major publishing houses are willing to take the risk of publishing overtly gay and lesbian stories for children. Similarly, many bookstores and libraries are reluctant to stock such stories, fearing negative response from homophobic customers. Nonetheless, such stories provide a valuable perspective on nontraditional families in children's popular literature. Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin (1983), by Susan Bosche, involves a young girl growing up in her father and his lover's home. Jenny's mother lives nearby, and Jenny spends many days with her. This story centers on the surprise birthday party that Jenny, her mother, and her father plan for Eric. The book highlights the caring environment in which Jenny lives, and it subtly reminds readers that a gay home can be a happy home.\n\nJane Severance's Lots of Mommies (1983) tells the story of Emily, a little girl growing up in a home where she receives love and encouragement from several female caregivers. The women live cooperatively: Emily's mother, Jill, is her primary parent; Annie Jo helps Emily cook; Vickie takes her to the library; and Shadowoman teaches her sewing and gardening. Once again, a nontraditional family is shown to be a happy family, and readers are challenged to expand their perspective on what a healthy family is.\n\nExtended families are common in contemporary children's books, particularly families in which grandparent-grandchild relationships figure. Death and dying are central to many of these books. When Grandpa Came to Stay (1986), by Judith Caseley, focuses on a grandfather and grandson in a Jewish family. Grandfather Jacob Levy has come to live with the Golds (Benny, his mother, and his father) after the death of his wife, Sarah Levy. Young Benny is initially frightened by his grandfather's tears and sadness, but a special kinship develops between the two after they visit the cemetery to lay flowers on Sarah's grave.\n\nSimilarly, in Trudy Madler's Why Did Gramdma Die? (1980), a young Caucasian girl, Heidi, must come to terms with her beloved grandmother's death. Heidi wonders why she and her parents couldn't keep Grandma alive. Only after viewing her grandmother's body at her funeral and telling her goodbye is Heidi able to accept death as a part of life.\n\nGrandmama's Joy (1980), by Eloise Greenfield, deals with the reactions of a little African-American girl, Rhondy, as she comes to accept the deaths of her parents. Because they died when Rhondy was a baby, she has no memory of them, and she is puzzled by her grandmother's sadness. Rhondy, who has heard the story of her parents' deaths before, listens intently as her grandmother retells the story. Rhondy especially looks forward to the way her grandmother ends the story:\n\n\"You'll always be my joy,\" [Grandmama] said. Rhondy didn't have to lift her head to look at Grandmama's face to know that she was smiling a real smile and that the lines between her eyebrows had gone away…. She felt so happy inher grandmama's arms because as much as she was Grandmama's joy, Grandmama was her joy, too.\n\nThe impact of AIDS on family relationships is explored in MaryKaye Jordan's Losing Uncle Tim (1989). The story is told from the perspective of young Daniel, whose favorite uncle slowly wastes away and eventually dies. The story deals honestly with Daniel's growing understanding that he can't \"catch\" AIDS from Uncle Tim; in so doing, the book attempts to educate readers about the realities of HIV infection. In portraying Tim's death and Daniel's grief, the book does not gloss over the harsh realities of a beloved uncle's death from AIDS and its impact on those who survive.\n\nIn addition to these stories, several others highlight affectionate grandparent-grandchild relationships. In Matt's Grandfather (1970), by Max Lundgren, young Matt goes with his parents to the \"old people's home\" to help his grandfather, who is growing senile, celebrate his eighty-fifth birthday. The story gives children a realistic glimpse into what old age can be like. In so doing, it parallels other recent children's books such as Freddy My Grandfather (1979), by Nola Langner, and Jesse and Abe (1981), by Rachel Isadora.\n\nNorma Farber's How Does It Feel to Be Old? (1979) is one of our family's favorites. Told in the form of a poem, this story depicts the relationship between a grandmother and granddaughter. Trina Schart Hyman's sepia-tone line drawings are effective in super-imposing images from the grandmother's past on her present, creating a visual memory collage. The book portrays the difficulties inherent in growing old as well as the joys of passing on one's stories and memories to a beloved granddaughter. The story concludes with the grandmother's prophecy: \"Soon you'll be knowing / that Grandma has died / while you are still growing / in inches and pride.\"\n\nAnnie and the Old One (1971), by Miska Miles, centers on the Navajo world of young Annie and her aging grandmother, who shows Annie how to light a fire in the hogan, make fry bread, and weave traditional Navajo rugs. Weaving becomes Annie's means of preserving her matrilinear heritage and of facing her grandmother's approaching death. Annie and the Old One is poignant, yet it is also vibrantly alive with Annie's knowledge of belonging to her culture—a knowledge passed on to her by her grandmother.\n\nTwo novels by Hadley Irwin, What about Grandma? (1982) and The Lilith Summer (1979), present positive images of grandmother-granddaughter relationships for adolescent readers. In the first novel, sixteen-year-old Rhys, whose parents had divorced when she was a baby, travels with her mother Eve to visit Grandma Wyn for part of the summer. There family secrets are uncovered, and a close bond among grandmother, daughter, and granddaughter is cemented. In the second novel, reluctant twelve-year-old Ellen takes care of seventy-seven-year-old Lilith Adams, and the two become fast friends.\n\nGrandma Gets Grumpy (1988), by Anne Grossnickle Hines, depicts an overnight stay at Grandma's for Lassen and her four cousins. Although their grandmother is delighted to have her young guests, they try her patience, and eventually she \"gets grumpy,\" leading Lassen to whisper, \"She sounds just like my mom.\"\n\n\"You bet I do,\" Grandma replies. \"That's because I taught Lassen's mom, and Brian's mom and Casey's dad everything they know about being grumpy. And I'm older, so I've had more practice.\" As the five grandchildren watch Grandma's grumpiness pass and her tenderness toward them return, young readers learn about the realities of interacting with a grandparent who displays a normal range of emotions.\n\nAll of these grandparent-grandchild stories belie the myth of the generation gap and compassionately portray the difficulties as well as the delights of inter-generational relationships. Such stories are complemented by children's books that feature independent older people who are happy with their lives. Barbara Cooney's Miss Rumphius (1982) is perhaps the best-known example. Miss Rumphius, known as the Lupine Lady, lives in a seashore cottage. As a young woman named Alice, she had lived on her own, worked as a librarian, and traveled to faraway lands. Now, as an old woman, she sows lupine seeds each spring and encourages children like her great-niece, little Alice, to \"do something to make the world more beautiful.\"\n\nCharlotte Zolotow's I Know a Lady (1984) is narrated by a young girl named Sally who makes friends with an old woman on their block. Sally watches her plant flowers, feed the birds, and make Christmas cookies for the neighborhood children. Sally muses, \"I wonder what she was like when she was a little girl,\" and she concludes, \"If I was an old lady and she was a little girl, I would love her a lot the way I do now.\"\n\nLike these two stories, Wendy Kesselman's Emma (1980) and Quentin Blake's Mrs. Armitage on Wheels (1987) center on older women who have many talents. Seventy-two-year-old Emma takes up painting, surprising her children and grandchildren and curing her loneliness. Mrs. Armitage travels through the countryside on a bicycle which she has equipped with horns, umbrella, sails, and dog seat. When her bicycle crashes under its own weight, she calmly picks herself up and sets off again—this time on roller skates. By picturing older women who are energetic and enterprising, all four books help to dispel the myth of the fragile, helpless \"old lady.\"\n\nStill more children's books portray mutually supportive relationships between an adult and a child. Jeannette Caines's Just Us Women (1982) tells the story of a young African-American girl and her Aunt Martha as they embark on a car trip through North Carolina, stopping wherever and whenever they choose and thoroughly enjoying themselves. Another such story is My Dad Is Really Something (1983), by Lois Osborn, in which Harry George, a young Caucasian boy, befriends Ron, a new boy in the class who perpetually brags about his father. When Harry George learns that Ron's father has actually died years earlier, he offers to share his own father with Ron.\n\nAllen Morgan's Daddy-Care (1986) is a wish-fulfillment story that follows a day in the life of Danny and his dad as they exchange roles. Danny takes his father to \"Daddy-care,\" where he and his friends work on cars, eat lunch together, take naps on their cots, and argue while playing poker. The story concludes with Danny reading his dad a bedtime story, singing him a song, and turning out the light. In Daddy-Care readers see a loving, secure single-parent family. Morgan's story works well as a tongue-in-cheek look at the power dynamics of parent-child relationships.\n\nA Chair for My Mother (1982), by Vera B. Williams, portrays a working-class family of women (Grandma, Aunt Ida, Aunt Sally, Mama, and her young daughter Rosa) who join forces to save money for a new over-stuffed chair to replace the one destroyed when Mama and her daughter's house burned down. A Chair for My Mother is the first in a series of stories that focus on the same family; in each case, Williams's lush illustrations and text reinforce the idea that a multi-generational family is a loving, respectful environment in which a child can grow up.\n\nThe variety of stories about nontraditional families is not exhausted by those discussed thus far. Many books focus on the adoptive family. Adoption Is for Always (1986), by Linda Girard, goes much further than earlier books like Valentine Wasson's The Chosen Baby (1939, 1967) in discussing the role of the birthmother as well as that of the adoptive parents. InAdoption Is for Always, Celia fantasizes about her birthmother, Susan. Her adoptive mother and father reassure Celia that being adopted means being loved. Crossracial adoption is the subject of Chinese Eyes (1974), by Marjorie Ann Waybill, and We Don't Look Like Our Mom and Dad (1984), by Harriet Langsam Sobol. Both stories revolve around the adoption of Asian children by Caucasian heterosexual couples.7We Don't Look Like Our Mom and Dad concludes by expressing a theme common to stories about nontraditional families; no one family is typical, and each is a family because its members choose to be one.\n\nMama One, Mama Two (1982), by Patricia MacLachlan, is one of the first contemporary children's books to depict a young girl's life in foster care. Maudie's foster mother (\"Mama Two\") tells her a bedtime story about Maudie's mother (\"Mama One\"). The story reveals that, although Maudie's mother loves her very much, the family's poverty leads to her mother's depression and eventual hospitalization. Maudie goes to stay with Katherine, a foster mother who has a small baby. Tom, a social worker, visits Maudie and Katherine regularly, and they call the foster home Maudie's \"for-a-while\" home. Although Maudie's biological mother is not physically present in the story, her spirit is present; and the implication is that someday Maudie will return to Mama One, taking with her warm memories of Mama Two.\n\nMichele Maria Surat's Angel Child, Dragon Child (1983) emphasizes the strength of family ties across cultures. The book tells the story of Nguyen Hoa, a little girl who has come from Vietnam to the United States with her father and older sisters. Nguyen Hoa, called \"Ut\" (for \"smallest daughter\") by her family, longs for her mother, still far away in Vietnam. Ut remembers her mother's musical voice, telling her to \"Be my brave little Dragon,\" and she looks at the tiny photograph of her mother which she keeps in a matchbox. Although she feels like an outcast at school, Ut is eventually befriended by an American boy named Raymond, who helps her write stories about her life in Vietnam. On the last day of school in the spring, Ut and Raymond run to her home to greet her mother, who has just arrived. Colorful, detailed illustrations by Vo-Dinh Mai, a native of Vietnam, make this book especially realistic—and poignant. The author's note explains that Surat based the book (her first children's book) on a story told to her by a Vietnamese child and that Surat's goal was to \"create a story that would promote understanding between Vietnamese children and their American peers.\"\n\nMany contemporary children's books consider issues not often touched on in earlier children's books. My Daddy Don't Go to Work (1978), by Madeena Spray Nolan, and Tight Times (1979), by Barbara Shook Hazen, offer a child's perspective on a parent's unemployment. So does My Mother Lost Her Job Today (1980), by Judy Delton, which focuses on Barbara Anne, a little girl whose single-parent mother has just been laid off from work. The story portrays the fears of both mother and daughter as they talk about what they will do to get by until the mother can find another job. This book is especially good at showing that the loss of a job often has very little to do with competence or performance—and far more to do with economics.\n\nChild sexual abuse, a timely subject, figures prominently in several children's books. Recent statistics indicate that one girl in four and one boy in nine will be victims of childhood sexual abuse. This subject is central to Pamela Russell and Beth Stone's Do You Have a Secret? (1986) and Judith Jance's It's Not Your Fault (1985). Please Tell (1991), published by the Hazelden Foundation, tells Jessie's story in her own words, accompanied by her own crayon illustrations. Her story begins, \"Dear friends everywhere, I was hurt by someone I loved and trusted, when I was four. He was my uncle and my godfather.\" Jessie speaks to other children, emphasizing how important it is to \"Keep telling until someone helps you. You don't have to live in a bad dream anymore.\"\n\nAll three of these picture books make clear that sexual abuse does not always take the form of intercourse—that it can include inappropriate touching, language, and threats. These books also dispel the myth that perpetrators of sexual abuse are strangers; in actuality, the abuser is often a family member.8 The importance of children's breaking silences about forms of abuses is at the heart of each story—along with the importance of adults' believing those children and reporting allegations of sexual abuse to child protection authorities.\n\nOther children's books examine the dynamics of families whose children are differently abled. For instance, in Elizabeth Fanshawe's Rachel (1975), the title character, a young Caucasian girl, is in a wheelchair; in Margaret Walden Froelich's Hide Crawford Quick (1983), twelve-year-old Gracie Prayther, her parents, and siblings learn to deal with the fact that their new baby, Crawford, has been born with only one foot. My Sister Is Different (1981), by Betty Ren Wright, describes a boy's relationship with his older, retarded sister; while My Friend Jacob (1980), by Lucille Clifton, portrays an interracial friendship between young Sam, who is African-American, and his older retarded friend, Jacob, who is Caucasian.\n\nSome children's books poke gentle fun at traditional notions of what a family should be. Nancy Carlson's The Perfect Family (1985) has Louanne, a piglet who is bored with being an only child, spending the weekend with her friend, George, a bunny who lives next door with his mother, father, five sisters, and four brothers. Louanne has to struggle to get enough food to eat and a place to sleep in the overcrowded household. The story concludes with Louanne's grateful return to her own home and her avowal to her mother that \"you and Daddy are the perfect family for me.\" Your Family, My Family (1980), by Joan Drescher, and How We Live (1977), by Anita Harper, portray children living in diverse types of families ranging from biological nuclear families to adoptive families to extended families to stepfamilies to foster families to single-parent families. Both picture books imply that no one \"best\" type of family exists and that all types are just fine.\n\nFantasy books for children offer one of the most fruitful avenues for studying \"nontraditional\" families.9 Books about witches are particularly intriguing in terms of how they portray the notion of family. Several current books take issue with the stereotypes of the wicked witch. Norman Bridwell's The Witch Grows Up (1979) and Babette Cole's The Trouble with Mom (1983) feature benevolent witches in heterosexual nuclear families, making friends with neighborhood children and casting benevolent spells to rescue those in danger. Marc Brown's Witches Four (1980) is about four little girl witches who apparently live without benefit of parents in a purple and pink Victorian-style house. They \"brush their teeth with spider paste\" and \"eat bat-wing sandwiches. They like the taste!\" A Woggle of Witches (1971), by Adrienne Adams, describes the Halloween festivities of a charming \"woggle\" (or group) of witches who live in the forest, fly to the moon on their brooms, and get frightened by children in Halloween costumes.\n\nAnd not all witches are depicted as women. Donna Lugy Pape's Taffy Finds a Halloween Witch (1975) tells the story of an orange cat adopted on Halloween by a young boy dressed as a witch. Books about witches, like those about imaginary animals, utopian societies, and journeys to far-off worlds, serve an important function in the world of children's and adolescents' books. Such books present authors and readers with opportunities for imagining new types of family structures, ones where boundaries between parents' and children's traditional roles are blurred, if not done away with altogether, and ones where insights gained by reading can be applied to real-life families.\n\nAs all of the stories cited above illustrate, children's literature is increasingly demonstrating that families cannot so easily be dichotomized as \"traditional\" or \"nontraditional\" and that no one family is \"normal,\" \"typical,\" or representative of all families. In doing this study, my intention has been to be exploratory rather than dogmatic, selective rather than comprehensive. I have set out to celebrate the expanding boundaries of children's literature while making a personal and scholarly foray into uncharted territory. I believe that it is essential to our children's and our own development that we open the gate and walk beyond the tiny, fenced-in reading yard of the old Dick, Jane, and Sally stories.\n\nApparently, the editors of Penguin Books have realized this, too, for they have published Marc Gregory Gallant's \"all-new primer,\" More Fun with Dick and Jane (1986). Its intended audience includes \"the millions of people who readily recall that immortal line: 'See Spot Run.'\" The preface to this primer explains what happened to the title characters and their little sister Sally when they all grew up.10 Dick has become a systems engineer for a public utility; he's married to Susan, and they have three sons. Jane, who is divorced, lives with her two daughters in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. She works as a loan officer, selling Amway in her spare time. Sally has been married and divorced twice; child-free, she is public relations director for a large winery in Mill Valley, California. Father died in 1981, and Mother now lives in a retirement home outside Dayton. Puff and Puff are also deceased, and Spot's namesake lives with Dick, who never takes him for a walk without the indispensable pooper-scooper.\n\nStories in More Fun with Dick and Jane include \"A Good Guess\" (Dick, Susan, and their sons buy an Apple Macintosh) and \"Fair Trade\" (Dick's son Adam trades his G.I. Joe to Jane's daughter Jessica for her Barbie doll). Also included are \"Can You Guess?\" (Jessica spray-paints her hair green and becomes a punk rocker) and \"An Evening with Sally\" (Sally treats her significant other, Craig, to wild mushroom salad with radiccio and radish sprouts, followed by cold poached chicken with walnut and basil pesto). The tongue-in-cheek humor of More Fun with Dick and Jane will strike a chord with \"baby boomers\" who are ready and able to poke fun at themselves. Gallant's re-vision of the Dick and Jane stories effectively lays to rest the time-worn maxim, \"Some things never change.\"\n\nIn the world of popular literature for children, things are changing all the time, and portrayals of many family configurations are steadily increasing. These stories cross boundaries of race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, age, and bloodlines. In fact, children's literature strikes me as far more progressive in redefining the family and in reshaping cultural attitudes toward the family than the current crop of \"family films\" now in theaters (and video stores) everywhere. Like many kindergartners, my daughter Rachel loves movies that feature children, especially little girls. During the past two months, we have seen \"All I Want for Christmas,\" \"Curly Sue,\" \"Baby Boom,\" \"Three Men and a Baby,\" \"Three Men and a Little Lady,\" \"The Maid,\" and \"Trading Hearts.\" Each of these movies has a little girl as a central character, and each storyline initially features a single-parent family.11 But not for long. By the end of each movie, the little girl and her mother or father have invariably been matched up with another parent of the opposite gender. Together they dance, stroll, skip, or drive off into the proverbial sunset—\"happily,\" as they say, \"ever after.\"\n\n\"Mommy, does that always happen?\" Rachel asked, as we walked home after one such movie.\n\n\"No, honey,\" I shook my head. \"Most of those movies aren't like real life.\"\n\n\"Or else you just never see that they don't stay together after the movie ends,\" she concluded solemnly.\n\nI repeated this conversation to a good friend who is also a single parent. She chuckled, \"I wonder why kids catch on so fast and it takes us adults so much longer?\"\n\nI nodded. I think I've caught on. Given the tenor of our times and the current emphasis on a return to \"traditional family values,\" many filmmakers have a difficult time finding financial backing for their movies unless the storylines feature heterosexual, married (or soon-to-be-married) couples—with or without children. I know that financial exigency and market appeal are central factors in why many contemporary films take so limited a view of family life. Still, I can't help but wonder how it affects a child's sense of self to see his or her kind of family treated as though something is wrong with it that needs \"fixing. \"\n\nThat's one reason I spend a good deal of time searching for children's stories that feature diverse kinds of families—stories that don't always end in a rosy glow. I believe it's worthwhile for children to be exposed to more than one \"script\" for life's relationships. It isn't always easy to find children's books that feature diverse types of families, but it is well worth the effort. Now, if I go into a bookstore and observe that it doesn't carry children's books that portray many kinds of families, I recommend some titles to the manager. If I notice that a library's books offer a limited range of portrayals of families, I ask the children's librarian to look into ordering ones that do. After all, they are out there. And those of us who live in nontraditional families, as well as many of us who don't, are glad of it.\n\nNotes\n\nIronically, the concept of the traditional family—that is, the heterosexual, two-parent, marital, nuclear family with the mother caring for children at home and the father working outside the home—is itself a relatively recent phenomenon (Lamb 2-3). Extended, single-parent, lesbian, gay, adoptive, foster, and other types of families have existed through the ages. These types of families, however, have generally not been validated by Western societies and thus have remained invisible in official historical accounts.\n\nIn examining the axioms on which the superiority of the traditional family has been based, Lamb asserts not only that a \"diverse array of nontraditional family types\" does exist but also that the study of them can \"help to illustrate the complexities and potential variability of developmental processes\" (Lamb 10-11).\n\nFun Wherever We Are, the third Pre-Primer of the New Basic Reading Program, contains stories about the family at home, at the shopping center, and in the family car. The eighteen stories in this Pre-Primer use a total vocabulary of seventy-two words, and, as the authors state in the afterword, \"join to provide a book that encourages steady growth in interpretive abilities\"(78).\n\nInterestingly, the authors do not address the question of what kinds of interpretive abilities, in addition to those of plot structure and syntax, the stories encourage in young readers.\n\nI use the terms \"traditional\" and \"nontraditional\" advisedly because I do not believe that such an artificial and potentially harmful distinction can or should be made. Jean Belovich defines twelve different family structures which she sees operating in the United States today:\n\nThere is the traditional family, where Mom stays home and Dad goes to work; the Dad-stays-home-and-Mom-works family; the both-spouses-work family; the single-parent family; the remarried family; the homosexual family; the unwedteenager-with-child family; the nonmarital family; the foster care family; the interreligious family; the interracial family; and the communal family.\n\n(xv)\n\nAlthough Belovich explains that many more family structures might exist, she asserts that \"all families strive for similar goals: financial stability, cooperation, harmony, emotional support, trust, and unconditional love\" (xv).\n\nI would note that, while the majority of books in my sample are children's picture books, some juvenile and young adult novels are also included.

Its very existence is a product of death or divorce. No one forgets this; fear of its recurrence is part of the stepfamily's fragile foundation. This family faces a challenging task. Yet few people understand its special dynamics, and this lack of knowledge can lead unsuspecting stepfamilies into chaos.\n\n(xiii)\n\nIn a \"Note to Parents\" preceding the story, the editors explain that the purpose of the story is to \"show your child that he or she is not the only one who has worries or uncertainties about becoming part of a new family.\" The editors' note goes on to encourage readers to use the book as a starting point for discussion about fears involving the dynamics of the stepfamily.\n\nThe subject of crossracial adoption has become much more controversial in the years since these books were published. In Minnesota, for instance, the court now presumes that a child's best interests will be met by intraracial rather than interracial adoption. Children's books dealing with this aspect of adoption are yet to be published.\n\nMankato, Minnesota is in Blue Earth County. The 1991 statistics on sexual abuse in our county, compiled by Blue Earth County Sexual Assault Services, indicate that twenty-three cases involving sexual abuse (maltreatment) had been substantiated. Of these, 89 percent were perpetrated by males, 11 percent by females; 90 percent of the victims were female, 10 percent male. The most frequent perpetrators included stepfathers, brothers, uncles, friend/acquaintances, and babysitters.\n\nI would like to thank Natalie Rosinsky for bringing this idea to my attention.\n\nMore Fun with Dick and Jane is the first of the New Contemporary Reading Series, according to its publishers.

I envisioned that my family should be really nice and neat. You kind of get it in your head that that is the way it should be … like family life should be nice and perfect, things always get together in the end, and someday you will meet your prince and live happily ever after.\n\nInterview with Anna, age 17, Watauga High School, Boone, North Carolina November 2, 1991\n\nI want to be the all-American type family man. I don't want to end up like my father in any way. I want to be the artist; I want to get married; I want to have kids; … I want to spend time with my kid, which is something my father has never been able to do. That is why I will never be like him—never.\n\nInterview with Dan, age 17, Watauga High School, Boone, North Carolina September 7, 1990\n\nThe near hysteria in the last several years emanating from the term \"family values\" apparently won't go away. If we look at the phenomenon optimistically, we might infer that the American populace is coming to grips, in a groping fashion, with widespread social changes that have been furiously at work for some time, some would say since the end of the Vietnam war. As society bends and shifts to deal with divorce, varying sexual orientations and gender roles, home-lessness, child abuse, and teenage pregnancy, the concept of family changes. The results are startling. In 1970, 13 percent of US households were \"single-parent\" families; by 1990, the number had more than doubled to 28 percent, and 24 percent were headed by the female parent (Keene et al. 1991, 93-95). Divorce rates continue to be very high. Half of the US marriages of people in their thirties are likely to end in divorce, and three out of every five of those divorces will involve children (Glick 1990, 141). In 1990, over 40 percent of marriages were remarriages for one or both parents. Children who live with both parents are on their way to becoming a minority—in 1990, only 69 percent (Coleman and Ganong 1990,926). Clearly, the age of the nuclear family has given way to a new age of single-parent families, stepfamilies, cohabitating stepfamilies, and so many other variations that there is no one \"new\" family structure. Those affected most by these social upheavals are children.\n\nNearly all observers can note the widespread societal changes, but few (especially among our political leaders) can coherently deal with the complex forces at work and understand how those involved can deal with them. Maybe literature, by providing distance, can provide the answers. This essay argues that recent adolescent literature illustrates complex situations with illuminating humor and surprising wisdom. A look at the best of recent novels reveals that adolescent literature has evolved toward a new realism. This shift comes at an appropriate time, for as Frances Duncan suggests, \"Today's young adult novels are adapted by teenagers who want to know how others live at a time when people don't stay still long enough for them to observe\" (1980, 329).\n\nEven a brief look at contemporary YA novels tells us that adolescents in the 1990s face a fastpaced and bewildering culture. What is significant is the newfound power adolescents have discovered to change their worlds. No longer are protagonists asked to suffer in silence, as they so often did in the 1970s \"problem novel.\" Pivotal recent novels reveal a new breed of adolescent—one who adapts, survives, and sometimes even thrives in this chaotic society. These adolescents are wily, self-sufficient, and remarkably aware of the world around them. What is most important is that they actively work to construct a new community with or without the help of adults. The values these adolescents adopt suggest that hope might be more appropriate than hysteria as new generations confront our current malaise.\n\nThe primary challenge young adults face is establishing an individual identity—and then finding a place for this new self in a larger community. In contemporary novels protagonists understand that an individual vision is an essential end-product of listening and observing. But these young adults do more than listen, observe, and accept, for borrowed idealistic philosophies and easy choices are not allowed in their world. Like Will Neuton in Gary Paulsen's The Island (1988), and like pragmatic Huck Finn, characters must often reject the \"advice\" that they are given in their search for what works. Will knows he must carve out his precepts even as he listens to advice from all sides.\n\nEverybody is always looking for something for life to be like. One teacher told me once that life is like an onion, and you just kept peeling back layers and never really got to the middle of it…. And then came a whole bunch of things for life to be like—life was like a beach, life was like a treadmill, life was like a carnival…. I finally figured life isn't like anything. Life is just life.\n\n(69)\n\nBeyond simple acceptance or rejection is the awareness that dreams must be modified to fit a shifting, multifaceted culture. Nick, in Ron Koertge's The Boy in the Moon, must revise childhood dreams as he sees friends and family changing around him.\n\nI remembered when we were about ten and we thought of that—how when we grew up, we'd buy a house and live in it and stay friends forever. All that seemed like a thousand years ago, and I felt so much older and somehow taller, as if I was looking down on an idyllic, miniature town—the kind model railroaders build—with twinkling lights, spotless streets, and mirrored lake: Perfectville, where nothing ever changed.\n\nThen I caught myself. What kind of life was that? Worse than being a statue in a museum.\n\n(1990, 132)\n\nThough Nick hasn't worked out a blueprint for perfect living, he has learned that easy answers are not usually viable and that change is inevitable. By necessity he and other protagonists talk calmly about painful realities that accompany change. Choices are often made after observing, then rejecting, adult attempts to simplify complex issues. He has learned that it is healthy to share the pain (and the observation). He can help his friend Kevin deal with the outpourings of his father, a closed-minded evangelist who finds all the world \"ugly.\" What might crush them individually is digested wisely in a group. After witnessing Kevin's father preach his fire-and-brimstone explanation of world problems, Nick's girlfriend Frieda sums up the situation: \"It's all kind of sad and pitiful. He's so hurt…. Not that I likeit … and not that I want to listen to much more of it\" (135). In a world where flawed adults hold the reins of power, adolescents must band together to share talk and to provide a unified front. In a fragile world these relationships are precious.\n\nAs products of \"nontraditional\" families, most protagonists have experienced separation and divorce. In many cases they've witnessed a good deal more than simple break-ups in relationships. Drug abuse, depression, dislocation from family, job pressure, confusion over religious beliefs, and depression take their toll on adult relationships. Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat (1989) has seen her separated parents passively refuse to reach out even when life itself is on the line. When Weetzie finds her father dangerously depressed, she tells her mother, \"[Y]ou should call him.\" Her mother refuses to act. She simply states, \"It makes me too sad\" (74). Soon afterwards, Weetzie's father overdoses on pills.\n\nAlthough these protagonists function quite well in their chaotic settings, they still experience the alienation that is almost required of adolescence. Their alienation doesn't stem from rigid adult structures, however, as it did in earlier YA literature. The adult \"conspiracy\" so prevalent in Robert Cormier's I Am the Cheese (1977) and The Chocolate War (1974) is not alive in these contemporary novels. Rather, the adults simply choose to answer to their own needs first, regardless of the consequences for the children. In The Boy in the Moon Kevin's father sacrifices his sons' needs on the altar of a self-created theology. In Sue Ellen Bridgers' Permanent Connections Ellery's newly divorced mother announces she is \"finished with doing her duty … and with taking care of things she [hasn't] chosen herself\" (1987, 63).\n\nThese parental choices lead young adults to the conclusion that self-absorption is a primary characteristic of adulthood. But their frustration with this state of affairs leads not to despair but to actions which build a \"new world,\" providing support which parents cannot give. Far from being passive victims, they see through what the adults clearly hope is mysterious and indecipherable. Brock Cole's Celine (1989) knows the score. When her young friend Jake suggests that his recently divorced parents still love him and the breakup isn't his fault, she knows she is expected to agree. But she can't, for she knows \"the truth.\" \"His parents don't like their lives anymore, and they're willing to chop the kid up a bit to change things….\" (86)\n\nCeline and Weetzie find ironic humor in their positions. This sometimes shocking and funny ability to verbalize where they stand in relation to adults is the first step towards constructing their futures. Thus, Celine can fully explain the \"profound existential anguish\" her presence causes her stepmother.\n\nAfter all, no one told her when she was a young graduate student … that the French professor with whom she had fallen in love had secreted somewhere in Iowa a lumpy adolescent. I was an unlooked-for absurdity, a serpent in the bosom, a cloud before the sun, a shock.\n\n(13-14)\n\nA vital resource young adults use to construct their new worlds is the popular culture that surrounds them. Weetzie Bat, a filmmaker, and Celine, an artist, have grown up studying this culture; they use what they have experienced as a seedbed for their art. Weetzie takes the alliance with TV, films, fashion, and music to the limit—her wardrobe, her relationships, and her future goals are splashed liberally with the paint of mass culture. As an offspring of Hollywood parents, Weetzie flamboyantly brings together a hodgepodge of influences, borrowing more from talk shows than from Biblical injunction. Like other protagonists, she has learned that unconventional choices can work when she makes do with what is available.\n\nEven her daughter is planned by using the \"resources\" at hand. Duck, her gay male live-in friend, tells her how to solve the \"father\" problem. Characteristically, the solution is borrowed from TV: \"I saw it on a talk show once. These two gay guys and their best friend all slept together so no one would know for sure whose baby it was\" (44).\n\nThe result is Cherokee, who \"looked like a three-dad baby … like a girl love warrior who would grow up and wear feathers and run swift and silent through the L.A. canyons\" (54).\n\nSuch a unique blend of cultural \"borrowing\" provides much of a flavor found in Weetzie Bat, Celine, The Boy in the Moon, and Permanent Connections. In each case, at least for a time, traditional \"family\" values are overwhelmed by the neutral, color-rich world of TV, movies, and music. But ultimately the richness of popular media does not simply wash over these young adults. Each is a discerning borrower, adept at recognizing ill-conceived ideas. I see these same abilities in the young adults I face daily. After all, popular culture is a tool which they've been working with since childhood. If the ability of these fictional characters to critique \"the media\" reflects actual American adolescents, then William Bennett, Dan Quayle, and other critics have missed the mark in categorizing mass culture as a brainwashing bludgeon.\n\nThese protagonists can also teach us about the failures of schooling in the 1990s. Each assumes that the school is \"smaller\" and less relevant than the mass culture that swirls about them. When they do talk about formal education, they associate it with adult tendencies to make rigid class distinctions and categorize students in superficial ways. Particularly vulnerable are school-sanctioned groups. Cynthia Rylant's Soda Jerk feels that joining structured school groups would mean embracing a world of clichés. He has no trouble putting the most visible groups in their place:\n\nThese jocks have been dead\n\never since some guy\n\nshoved a ball into their hands as they were climbing\n\nout of the sandbox and just about to have\n\nan original thought.\n\n(1990, 37)\n\nLike most adolescents, he has been thoroughly socialized in school and thus has recognized social inequities linked to class, race, and gender:\n\n… [W]e watched year after year\n\nwhile the ones who got it—\n\nthe ones just made for a world\n\nof square pegs and square holes—\n\ncarried off little medals.\n\n(45)\n\nYet, he sees no salvation in conforming. In a world where new rules for survival must be formulated, mere clique-ish popularity and catering to adult standards is an anachronistic and futile exercise.\n\nThough these protagonists reject the primary mission of school as molding adolescents to adult expectations, they recognize pragmatically that they must understand the logic of schooling. For the ever-observant Celine, the contradictions she sees at school ultimately affect her performance. Her difficulties with writing about The Catcher in the Rye come from her problems accepting what her teacher wants:\n\n[I]t seems to me to be sort of a smash-and-grab for the high schools to start taking the book over. Because, unless we are going to start throwing up on the teacher every time he brings the subject up, we are going to have to pretend that he is really very wise and understanding and not at all like the adults in Catcher in the Rye….\n\n(24)\n\nIn Jerry Spinnelli's Maniac Magee (1990) the young hero refuses to attend school. Until he can satisfy his most pressing need—a home—, learning for learning's sake must wait.\n\nThe alienation these adolescents face appears to have deeper roots than simple frustration with adults. Often, the alienation, like the break-up of adult relationships, can be linked to the transitory, disconnected American landscape. The idyllic picture of childhood most adults cherish contains in-depth knowledge of place—a world of streets, creeks, neighborhoods explored time and again. But these adolescents move too often to know any world intimately, and as they move, the culture moves around them. Celine already has moved from mother to grandmother to father in three separate communities. Maniac, having lost his parents, moves first to relatives, then later, on his own, to a number of temporary homes within the city. Kevin shuffles between his father in Missouri and his mother in California.\n\nCut off from stable communities, and sometimes the land itself, they feel the void created when adults wrestle with the realization that discarded roots cannot easily be rebuilt. They face a future that promises more restless movement. In the chaos, they find that the land itself reflects the changing present more than it does the historical, stable past. Having seen the impermanence of family relationships, they wisely assume that little they currently prize will remain as is. Thus, like Weetzie, they are forced to \"create\" their own culture and history out of the transient present, but this is difficult when history is confined to the length of her memory. In the southern California flux Weetzie swims in, the past is characterized by \"Elvis Land,\" which she remembers from childhood. \"There had been a beat-up Cadillac, a picture of Elvis, and a giant love letter … on the lawn\" (40).\n\nWeetzie knows that place for many Americans is a choice, and not something assigned at birth. Where one chooses to live determines options. Thus, when she must choose between her father in New York and her mother in southern California, she chooses place over either of her parents. \"[S]he couldn't leave where it was hot and cold, glam and slam, rich and trashy, devils and angels, Los Angeles\" (19).\n\nNick, in The Boy in the Moon, must also make choices. The options are mirrored in the land itself. \"Out West in Kevinland the concrete had won, but not here\" (79). But even in the stability of the Midwest he sees evidence of failed adult dreams.\n\nOff to the left and right were narrower, weedier lanes, almost paths now—leading to ramshackle houses, to deserted ones, or to nothing at all. And I know that people had come here, to the heart of the heart of the country, with variations of the same dream that Kevin hoped would come true in California—to feel at home somewhere, to be happy and free.\n\n(130)\n\nThat's the dilemma faced by these young adults (and by many of my students)—not obtaining success, or money, or prestige, but discovering or sometimes creating \"home,\" happiness, and stability.\n\nWhat makes these novels interesting is how young adults solve these problems. Rob, in Permanent Connections, has advantages over other protagonists because his Appalachian roots are still accessible. His job is to reconcile his \"modern\" rock-and-roll persona with the \"old world\" his father had once found lacking. Unlike his father, he realizes that material success may not be enough to create a new home to replace the old. The rootlessness Rob has inherited has made him an expert in ways to evade emptiness—pretended indifference, marijuana, alcohol, sex, and loud music. But none of these \"New Jersey\" outlets work when he comes up against Ellery, another adolescent uprooted from home and family. Rob is able to find peace only when he realizes the power of an extended family. He learns he isn't now, and has never been, alone. \"The Dicksons, generations of them whose names he didn't even know, were there\"(250).\n\nFinding \"home\" for Rob means discovering an \"ace card\" he doesn't know he possesses. For other teenagers, this ace card no longer is accessible. Maniac, Celine, Weetzie, and Kevin must learn to construct extended families from the friends, parents, and lovers they have available. The result, especially in Maniac Magee and Weetzie Bat, is a colorful patchwork community comprised of individuals not typically thought of as compatible—gay males, African Americans, the homeless, the old, and the young. What holds these newly constructed families together is a surprising collection of \"traditional\" values (love, cooperation, respect, tolerance). The lure of home as a haven is the glue that holds the individuals together. Maniac sums up what they gain from their unconventional union—a \"private language of caring.\" \"Inside his house, a kid gets one name, but on the other side of the door it's whatever the rest of the world wants to call him\" (53).\n\nChaos threatens constantly to destroy their best efforts. But the passivity bred of fear they see mirrored in many adults is not an option. Action is the only recourse. Like Weetzie, they know that choices can lead either to the dark underbelly of despair or to a new community.\n\n[L]ove and disease are both like electricity…. They are always there—you can't see or smell or hear, touch, or taste them, but you know they are there like a current in the air…. We can choose… we can choose to plug into the love current.\n\n(88)\n\nThe stories these adolescents tell illustrate the dilemmas faced by many American families. Robert Bellah and others in Habits of the Heart (1985) document the lives of Americans caught between the often contradictory goals of striving to satisfy individual needs and building stable families and communities. Bellah, borrowing from de Tocqueville, suggests that the love of individualism has caused many Americans to \"forget their descendents.\" This \"makes the current widespread nostalgia for 'the family' all the more poignant\" (82).\n\nBellah and his co-authors describe what is missing.\n\nCommunities … have a history—in an important sense they are constituted by their past—and for this reason we can speak of a real community as a \"community of memory,\" one that does not forget its past. In order not to forget that past, a community is involved in retelling its story, its constitutive narrative…. These stories of collective history and exemplary individuals are an important part of the tradition that is so central to a community of memory.\n\n(153)\n\nAs our students read contemporary young-adult literature and write about their responses, they share their stories. From these stories will be formed the strange, and possibly wholesome, communities of the future. Some, like Nicole, have much to unravel.\n\nIn my own life, I've just realized, I have already experienced about five or six different kinds of family structures. I usually say \"my parents are divorced,\" but that label does not cover it all:\n\n1. I lived for 10 years with my sister and both my parents (nuclear family).\n\n2. I lived for two years with my parents, my sister, my parental grandmother, and my older half-brother (my father's son by his first marriage) (extended nuclear family).\n\n3. After the divorce, I lived for three or four years with my sister and my mother (single-parent family).\n\n4. Plus we spent summers with my father and his live-in girlfriend (de facto stepfamily #1).\n\n5. Then, my mother's boyfriend moved in and has lived with us for the past eight years (de facto stepfamily #2).\n\n6. Now my dad has remarried, and I lived for at least one full year with him and my new stepmother, six years older than me (stepfamily).\n\nSomewhere in all that confusion, new family forms are coalescing. When students like Nicole read adolescent fiction and respond through writing and sharing with peers, they inevitably compare their lives with those of both peers and fictional characters. Often the dilemmas students have faced and the decisions they've made are remarkably similar.\n\nKevin in The Boy in the Moon explains how observers come to construct the face of a man in the moon. \"It's all those flaws coming together to make a face\"(145). This is a powerful metaphor that brings many adolescents together. Rather than caving in to despair, they create new communities out of the flawed materials of the present. Though these new communities wouldn't be recognizable to many who have grown up in the \"old\" families, the values often remain the same. Each new family has begun the arduous task of collecting and weaving together the stories necessary to make the communities permanent. Each hopes to create a coherent face, a new nurturing nontraditional family, which can face the future with hope.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBellah, Robert N., and James L. Paul. 1985. Habits of the Heart.
