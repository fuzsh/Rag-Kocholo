        "text": "The comic crime adventure LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME stars Keenen Ivory Wayans as Andre Shame, a down-on-his-luck ex-DEA officer matching wits with a Mexican drug lord and finding love with Jada Pinkett. Fired by the DEA for fouling up the initial capture, Shame is offered another chance to catch the bad guy, but first he must locate the drug lord’s girlfriend and set her up in a witness protection program. The plot is complicated by the fact that the missing girlfriend is Shame’s old flame. Romantic friction ignites when his secretary does not like the old flame in the house. The whole affair is a setup, of course, and Shame shoots up the landscape before setting things right.\n\nLOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME suffers from structural and stylistic problems that lessen the overall impact. As director, Wayans relies on slow motion to convey the importance of a particular scene rather than relying on dialogue. Each romantic encounter is musically drowned by a 70’s-sounding bass line, further trivializing already weak scenes. The general effect is that of a poorly made and dated music video. The movie is plagued by violence, lots of foul language, shallow characterizations, preposterous action, and comes across as little more than a mediocre attempt at light comedy featuring revenge, theft and the worship of status items … overall, a real shame."
