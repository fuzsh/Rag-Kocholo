This document discusses dysfunctional families. It begins by defining a dysfunctional family as one that develops a sense of powerlessness and is unable to effectively cope with life's adversities. Some characteristics of dysfunctional families include having deficient, controlling, alcoholic, or abusive parents. Children in these families often feel inadequate, resentful, insecure, and angry. They may struggle with trust, emotional expression, intimacy, and addiction as adults due to the trauma experienced in their dysfunctional upbringings. The document examines the negative impacts of different types of parental deficiencies and abuse on children.",
