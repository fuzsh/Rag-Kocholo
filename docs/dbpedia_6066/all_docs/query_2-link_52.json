The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. … Jesus saith unto her, … True worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. … The woman then … went her way into the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. … And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. … And many more believed … and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.\n\nJacob 1:15; 2:23–28; 3:5 (also Mosiah 11:2, 4, 14; Ether 10:5)\n\nThe people of Nephi … began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat. … Thus saith the Lord: This people … seek to excuse themselves. … I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old. … For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. … This people shall keep my commandments. … Concubines they should have none.\n\nA home with a loving and loyal husband and wife is the supreme setting in which children can be reared in love and righteousness and in which the spiritual and physical needs of children can be met. Just as the unique characteristics of both males and females contribute to the completeness of a marriage relationship, so those same characteristics are vital to the rearing, nurturing, and teaching of children.\n\nElder David A. Bednar, “Marriage is Essential to His Eternal Plan” Ensign, June 2006.\n\n“The doctrine is clear—and is substantiated by years of research. We don’t need to return to the family laws of yesteryear, but if we could just care more about our children and their future, people would marry before becoming parents. They would sacrifice more, much more, to stay married. Children would be raised, whenever possible, by their biological parents. … Yet in principle, the 1995 proclamation on the family says it perfectly: “Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.”\n\nElder Bruce C. Hafen, from the address, “Marriage, Family Law, and the Temple,” delivered at the J. Reuben Clark Law Society Annual Fireside in Salt Lake City on January 31, 2014.\n\n[God’s] vision of marriage as a holy order based on enduring covenants, duties, and lifelong sacrifice stands in stark contrast to a modern secular concept of marriage. That worldly formulation has virtually nothing to do with losing your life in service to family or in self-sacrifice for spouse and children. …\n\n===\n\nNever has a global society placed so much emphasis on the fulfillment of romantic and sexual desires as the highest form of personal autonomy, freedom, and self-actualization. Society has elevated sexual fulfillment to an end in itself rather than as a means to a higher end. In this confusion, millions have lost the truth that God intended sexual desire to be a means to the divine ends of marital unity, the procreation of children, and strong families, not a selfish end in itself.\n\n====\n\nWe are losing the basic understanding that society has a unique and profound interest in marriage because of its power to form a male-female union that is the optimal setting for the bearing and rearing of children—ensuring to the greatest extent possible that every child has an opportunity to know and to be loved and cared for by the mother and father who brought him or her into the world.\n\nElder David A. Bednar, from an address, “The Divinely Designed Pattern of Marriage,” delivered at a colloquium on marriage in New York City, New York, USA, on March 9, 2017.\n\nReared by Father and Mother, Complimentarity of Genders\n\nEx. 20:12 (Deut. 5:16; Mosiah 13:20)\n\nHonour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\nProv. 1:7–8\n\nThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. … My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.\n\nProv. 6:20\n\nMy son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother.\n\nProv. 23:22–25\n\nHearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. … He that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.\n\nAlma 56:47\n\nThey never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.\n\nChildren need the emotional and personal strength that comes from being raised by two parents who are united in their marriage and their goals. As one who was raised by a widowed mother, I know firsthand that this cannot always be achieved, but it is the ideal to be sought whenever possible… We also need politicians, policy makers, and officials to increase their attention to what is best for children in contrast to the selfish interests of voters and vocal advocates of adult interests.\n\nElder Dallin H. Oaks, ”Protect the Children,” Ensign, November 2012.\n\n“A home with a loving and loyal husband and wife is the supreme setting in which children can be reared in love and righteousness and in which the spiritual and physical needs of children can be met. Just as the unique characteristics of both males and females contribute to the completeness of a marriage relationship, so those same characteristics are vital to the rearing, nurturing, and teaching of children.”\n\nElder David A Bednar, “Marriage is Essential to His Eternal Plan,” Ensign, June 2006.\n\nChildren are also victimized by marriages that do not occur. Few measures of the welfare of our rising generation are more disturbing than the recent report that 41 percent of all births in the U.S. were to women who were not married. Unmarried mothers have massive challenges, and the evidence is clear that their children are at a significant disadvantage when compared with children raised by married parents.\n\nElder Dallin H. Oaks, “Protect the Children,” General Conference, October 2012.\n\nMarital vows\n\nLifelong\n\nSee also paragraph 8, sentence A [Divorce].\n\nMatt. 19:4–9 (Mark 10:4–9)\n\nHave ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. … Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.\n\n1 Cor. 7:10, 27\n\nUnto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband. … Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed.\n\nRom. 7:2\n\nThe woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth.\n\nSuch a total union, such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman, can only come with the proximity and permanence afforded in a marriage covenant.\n\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Of Souls, Symbols and Sacraments,” BYU devotional, January 1988; condensed version in “Personal Purity,” General Conference April 1998.\n\n“The blessings of covenant belonging come when we follow the Lord’s prophet and rejoice in temple-covenant living, including in marriage. Covenant marriage becomes supernal and eternal as we daily choose the happiness of our spouse and family before our own. As “me” becomes “we,” we grow together. We grow old together; we grow young together. As we bless each other across a lifetime of forgetting ourselves, we find our hopes and joys sanctified in time and eternity.”\n\nElder Gerrit W. Gong, “Covenant Belonging,” General Conference, October 2019.\n\nFidelity\n\nEx. 20:14, 17 (Mosiah 13:22, 24; D&C 19:25)\n\nThou shalt not commit adultery. … Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife.\n\n1 Cor. 7:2\n\nTo avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.\n\nD&C 42:22–26 (D&C 63:16)\n\nThou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else. And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out. But he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive.\n\nD&C 59:6\n\nThou shalt not … commit adultery, … nor do anything like unto it.\n\nMatt. 5:27–28 (3 Ne. 12:27–28)\n\nIt was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n\nWhether we like it or not, so many of the difficulties which beset the family today stem from the breaking of the seventh commandment (see Ex. 20:14). Total chastity before marriage and total fidelity after are still the standard from which there can be no deviation without sin, misery, and unhappiness. The breaking of the seventh commandment usually means the breaking of one or more homes.\n\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball, “Families Can Be Eternal,” General Conference, 1980.\n\nSee also paragraph 4, sentence C [Sexual relations: Between husband and wife; Outside of Marriage].\n\nChildren within Matrimony\n\n“Marriage is linked to higher levels of health and happiness and lower levels of alcohol and drug abuse for both adults and teens. Marriage is a wealth-creating institution – married people earn more, save more, and build more wealth, compared to people who are single or living together. There is an inverse relationship between marriage and crime – in communities where marriage is common, crime is much less common. Marriage is our most pro-child institution. It is our society’s best arrangement for helping children to thrive.”\n\nInstitute for American Values, “What is America’s Most Serious Social Problem?” (2006). Retrieved from http://americanvalues.org/search/item.php?id=55\n\nMarriage strengthened the bonds between fathers and their children. Married men were more involved and had better relationships with their children than unwed or divorced fathers. In part, this was because married fathers shared the same residence with their children. But it was also because the role of husband encourages men to voluntarily take responsibility for their own children.\n\nSteven Nock, “Marriage in Men’s Lives” (NY: Oxford University Press, 1998); David Popenoe, Life without Father: Compelling New Evidence That Fatherhood and Marriage Are Indispensable for the Good of Children and Society (New York: The Free Press, 1996).\n\n“Relationships are more complex and less stable in families that are formed by unmarried parents. These families are much more likely to include children from other partnerships, and parents’ relationships are more fragile. Nearly half the cohabiting mothers (and nearly 80% of the non-cohabiting unmarried mothers) have ended their relationships with their child’s fathers by the time their children are 3 years old. Poverty rates and unemployment are also higher in unmarried-parent families. Sociological theory tells us that father absence reduces children’s access to social capital.”\n\nMcLanahan, S. (2004). Diverging Destinies: How Children Are Faring Under the Second Demographic Transition. Demography, 41(4), 607-627.\n\nThe biological child of cohabitants consistently received smaller investments from their fathers than a biological child of married parents, in both blended and nonblended households. …The differences persisted for biological children after controlling for other socioeconomic factors, even in blended families. … Marriage is differentiating the investments fathers make in\n\ntheir children. … What adults do in their relationships affects, feeds into, and impacts their relationships with children, even biological ones.\n\nWilson, R. F. (2005). Evaluating marriage: Does marriage matter to the nurturing of children? The San Diego Law Review, 42(3), 847.\n\n“Evidence shows the least safe of all environments for children is that in which the mother is living with someone other than the child’s biological father. This is the environment for the majority of children in cohabiting couple households.”\n\nDavid Popenoe and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, “Should We Live Together? What Young Couples Need to Know about Cohabitation Before Marriage,” National Marriage Project.\n\nUsing nationally representative data from the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to examine the association between family structure and child well-being … our findings showed that cohabiting parents were closer to single parent families than married parent families in terms of economic disadvantage. We also found that differences in economic resources accounted for much more of the disadvantage associated with non-traditional family structures than differences in parenting, especially differences between single parent families and married parent families.\n\nElizabeth Thomson, & Sara S. McLanahan. (2012). Reflections on “Family Structure and Child Well-Being: Economic Resources vs. Parental Socialization”. Social Forces, 91(1), 45-53.\n\n“The children of divorced or unwed parents have about three times as many serious behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems as children in two-parent families. By every measure of child well-being, these children are far worse off. And when children are dysfunctional, society becomes dysfunctional.”\n\nBruce C. Hafen, address from “Marriage, Family Law, and the Temple,” delivered at the J. Reuben Clark Law Society Annual Fireside in Salt Lake City on January 31, 2014.\n\nYoung girls who are reared by mothers with no single long-term partner tend to enter puberty earlier, become sexually active earlier, and have more sexual partners than girls coming from households having both mother and father. …\n\nEllis, McFadyen-Ketchum, Dodge, Pettit and Bates (1999) conducted a longitudinal study to test Belsky’s evolutionary model of menarcheal [onset of menstration/sexual maturation] timing. These researchers observed 173 girls and their families for eight years to determine if more negative-coercive family relationships in early childhood provoke earlier reproductive development in adolescence. It was found that the quality of a fathers’ investment in the family was the most important aspect of the proximal family environment relative to influencing a daughter’s pubertal timing. Girls reared in father-absent homes reached menarche several months earlier than their peers in father-present homes. The longer the paternal absence, the earlier was the onset of puberty. … The greater the time spent by fathers in child care and the greater the level of father- daughter affection, the more delayed was the onset of menarche.\n\nSee Ellis, Bruce J, McFadyen-Ketchum, Steven, Dodge, Kenneth A, Pettit, Gregory S, & Bates, John E. (1999). Quality of Early Family Relationships and Individual Differences in the Timing of Pubertal Maturation in Girls. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(2), 387-401.\n\nReared by Father and Mother\n\n“Nearly three decades of research evaluating the impact of family structure on the health and well-being of children demonstrates that children living with their married, biological parents consistently have better physical, emotional, and academic well-being. Pediatricians and society should promote the family structure that has the best chance of producing healthy children. The best scientific literature to date suggests that, with the exception of parents faced with unresolvable marital violence, children fare better when parents work at maintaining the marriage.\n\nThere are clearly negative long-term consequences of divorce—children, parents, and society all suffer. … Given these tremendous costs borne by all individuals affected by divorce, as well as the costs to society, it is the responsibility of physicians—especially pediatricians, who care for children in the context of their families—to advocate for public health policies that promote marriage and decrease the likelihood of divorce.”\n\nAnderson, J. (2014). The impact of family structure on the health of children: Effects of divorce. The Linacre Quarterly, 81(4), 378-387.\n\nFew propositions have more empirical support in the social sciences than this one: compared to all other family forms, families headed by married, biological parents are best for children.\n\nDavid Popenoe, “The Scholarly Consensus on Marriage,” Center for Marriage and Family at the Institute for American Values Fact Sheet #2, Feb 2006.\n\n“Longstanding research assert(s) the view that the ideal environment for raising children is a stable biological mother and father. The science on comparative parenting structures, especially the research on same-sex households, is relatively new. Therefore, a claim that another parenting structure provides the same level of benefit should be rigorously tested and based on sound methodologies and representative samples. … it is reasonable to conclude that a mother and father function as a complementary parenting unit and that each tends to contribute something unique and beneficial to child development … Current research on the psycho-social development of children continues to affirm that the complementarity of an intact family, with a mother and a father serving unique relational roles, is optimal for a child’s healthy development.”\n\n“Brief of Amicus Curiae Michigan Family Forum in Support of Defendants,” Alliance Defending Freedom, August 21, 2013, retrieved from http://www.adfmedia.org/files/SnyderAmicus.pdf.\n\nAndrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, has found that in communities where the crisis of fatherlessness is at its highest, the rate of abortion is startlingly high as well: “In Springfield, Massachusetts, for example, 70% of newborns come home from the hospital to a house without a father. The number of abortions in the city is similarly sky high. For every five live births in Springfield, two children are aborted. In 2017, that number of abortions was 2,143, and nearly 90% of the women who had those abortions were not married. These startling statistics reinforce the logical connection between marriage and fertility.”\n\nAndrew Beckwith, “No Dad, No Baby: Abortion in the Age of Fatherlessness,” New Boston Post, 14 Jun 2019.\n\n“The largest study to date—the National Health Interview Study which began with 1.6 million cases and yielded 512 same-sex parent families—debunks the idea that children with same-sex parents fare “no different” than children raised in the home of their married mother and father.”\n\nSee Sullins, D., “Emotional Problems among Children with Same-sex Parents: Difference by Definition,” British Journal of Education, Society & Behavioural Science 7:2 (2015), 99–120.\n\nTo be raised in an intact biological family presents clear advantages for children over other forms of parenting. In particular, the New Family Structures Survey (NFSS) provides evidence that previous generations of social scientists were unable to gather: that children from intact, biological families also out-perform peers who were raised in homes of a parent who had same-sex relationships. Therefore, these new peer-reviewed studies reaffirm—and strengthen—the conviction that the gold standard for raising children is still the intact, biological family.\n\nSamuel, A., The Kids Aren’t All Right: New Family Structures and the ‘No Differences’ Claim, ThePublicDiscourse.com, 24 Jun 2012.\n\n“Redefining marriage … further distance[s] marriage from the needs of children and would deny … the ideal that a child needs both a mom and a dad. Decades of social science, including the latest studies using large samples and robust research methods, show that children tend to do best when raised by a mother and a father.”\n\nAnderson, R. (2013). “Marriage: What it is, Why it Matters, and the Consequences of Redefining It.” The Heritage Foundation. Retrieved from https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/report/marriage-what-it-why-it-matters-and-the-consequences-redefining-it\n\nThe New Consensus that Marriage Matters. A large body of social science research indicates that healthy, married-parent families are an optimal environment for promoting the well-being of children. Children raised by both biological parents are less likely than children raised in single- or step-parent families to be poor, to drop out of school, to have difficulty finding a job, to become teen parents or to experience emotional or behavioral problems.\n\nInstitute for American Values, “What is America’s Most Serious Social Problem?” (2006). Retrieved from http://americanvalues.org/search/item.php?id=55\n\n“Adolescents in single-parent families are significantly more delinquent than their counterparts residing with two biological, married parents. … But the effects of family structure are largely mediated by family processes, such as parental monitoring, supervision, and closeness. … Parental closeness coupled with involvement, supervision, and monitoring, attenuate the effect of living in a single-parent (or step) family on delinquency. Given that a growing share of America’s youth spends some time in a single-parent family, it is imperative that parents (as well as families and communities more generally) strive to provide their children with a strong balance of nurture and control to minimize delinquent behavior, particularly the more serious forms to which adolescents in single-parent families appear to be especially susceptible.”\n\nDemuth, Stephen, & Brown, Susan L. (2016). Family Structure, Family Processes, and Adolescent Delinquency: The Significance of Parental Absence Versus Parental Gender. The Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 41(1), 58-81.\n\nDespite government spending over $22 trillion on anti-poverty programs since the 1960s War on Poverty began, the child poverty rate has barely decreased: from 20.7 percent in 1965 to 19.2 percent in 2015. The War on Poverty largely failed because it ignored the role of marriage in reducing poverty. Poverty is most prevalent in non-intact families. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-parent families are significantly more likely to fall into poverty than are married-couple families:\n\nOver 2 million children reside in single-parent families. Never married single mother families constitute the greatest portion of single parent families. While the share of divorced and separated single mothers has decreased in recent years (although the numbers are still high), the share of never married single mothers continues to rapidly rise. This trend is particularly alarming because, of all family structures, children of never married mothers are the most likely to experience poverty. In 2015, 49.8 percent of children under age 18 who lived with a never married mother were in poverty. It is also notable in the chart above that cohabitation seems to make little difference in lowering the poverty rate.\n\nThe risk of drug use, including problem use, is highest among adolescents in father-custody families (father-only and father-stepmother families), even after controlling for the effects of sex, age, race-ethnicity, family income, and residential mobility. The risk of drug use is lowest in mother-father families. … The confirmed relationship between family structure and a host of developmental outcomes, including educational achievement, sexual behavior, and drug use, demands that we not ignore the living arrangements of adolescents when developing and implementing prevention programs, treatment policies, and other activities designed to enhance adolescent development.\n\nJohn P.

Hodges, cite work in which “Sullins found that, while outcomes for children with opposite-sex parents improved if their parents were married, outcomes for children with same-sex parents were notably worse if their parents were married rather than unmarried.” In this latest study, using data from the congressionally mandated National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (the primary data source for the three best studies used to support the “no differences” theory), Dr. Sullins finds that children of reported married same-sex parents are more likely than those of unmarried same-sex parents, unmarried opposite-sex parents, or married opposite-sex parents to experience depressive symptoms, unhappiness, daily fear or crying, and anxiety.”\n\nHall, J., The Research on Same-Sex Parenting: ‘No Differences’ No More, Heritage Foundation, 23 Apr 2015.\n\nDr. Mark Regnerus, professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, addressed each of the three main problems with the earlier studies [suggesting no parenting difference between same-sex couples and heterosexual parents]. His research found that, similar to children from non-intact families, those children who at some point during their childhood lived with one parent and that parent’s same-sex partner fared, on average, significantly worse than children of married biological parents on a multitude of measures, including their educational progress as children and eventual employment and dependence on public assistance in adulthood. His study … seriously challenges the notion that the “no differences” conclusion is settled science.\n\nHall, J., “The Research on Same-Sex Parenting: ‘No Differences’ No More”, Heritage Foundation, 23 Apr 2015.\n\nMarital Vows\n\nLifelong\n\nSee also paragraph 8, sentence A [Divorce].\n\nMarriage benefits individuals, families, and society.

The gap in marriage is growing, especially in terms of childbearing. While marriage is struggling against cultural, social and economic headwinds in poorer communities, it is flourishing among affluent, well-educated Americans who are both more likely to marry and more likely to stay married:\n\nDespite the growing retreat from marriage in both Canada and the United States, cross-sectional studies clearly show that married individuals enjoy longer lives and are in better physical and mental health than their non-married counterparts. … Confirming what has been reported in other studies, we find that marriage continues to be beneficial for mental health. Specifically, we find that those who are married in 1994 and do not experience any transition in marital status over the course of the survey report significantly lower levels of distress relative to those who remain single, separated or divorced. Consistent with longitudinal studies that prospectively compare the mental health status of those who make a change in marital status with those who do not, we find that entry into marriage is associated with lower levels of distress and a transition out of marriage increases psychological distress.\n\nStrohschein, Lisa, McDonough, Peggy, Monette, Georges, & Shao, Qing.

This is the first generational overview of how Americans think about sexual fidelity online in the wake of the internet revolution and the first study of the links between sexual fidelity online and relationship quality among American men and women. … It included participants from Generation X and the millennial, baby boomer and silent/greatest generations.\n\n—-\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n—-\n\n• Although a clear majority of Americans in all generations express support for sexual fidelity in their relationships and report they are sexually faithful in real life, today’s young adults are markedly more likely to cross online boundaries related to sex and romance. For example, 18% of millennial participants engaged in sexual talk online with someone besides their partner, compared to 3% of greatest/silent generation participants, 6% of baby boomers, and 16% of Gen Xers.\n\n—\n\n• Several online behaviors are rated by most Americans (70% or more) as “unfaithful” or “cheating,” including having a secret emotional relationship or sexting with someone other than a partner/spouse without the partner’s/spouse’s knowledge and consent.\n\n—-\n\n• Married and cohabiting men and women who maintain strong boundaries online against potential sexual and romantic alternatives are more likely to be happy in their relationships.\n\nThose currently married or cohabiting who blur these boundaries online are significantly less happy, less committed and more likely to break up, while, conversely, those taking a more careful stance to attractive alternatives online are happier, more committed and less likely to separate.\n\nBromley, A.

Regular participation in worship services may reinforce religious plausibility structures and belief systems; thus, persons who internalize these religious values and norms may be dissuaded from indulging any temptation. …\n\n———–\n\nOur findings suggest that specific theological beliefs, specifically views about the Bible, are also directly related to infidelity. Persons who agree that the Bible is the literal word of God are less prone to engage in marital infidelity than their counterparts who ascribe no sacred significance to the Bible, and this relationship persists even with controls for religious affiliation and frequency of attendance at services. Likewise, persons who regard the Bible as the inspired (but not literal) word of God are also less inclined toward infidelity than nonbelievers. Our findings suggest that such biblical beliefs may translate into greater resistance to sexual temptation on the part of married persons. This suggests that doctrines of moral conservatism and restraint are associated with real differences in personal behavior rather than simply beliefs.\n\nBurdette, Amy & Ellison, Christopher & Sherkat, Darren & Gore, Kurt.

We don’t need to return to the family laws of yesteryear, but if we could just care more about our children and their future, people would marry before becoming parents. They would sacrifice more, much more, to stay married. Children would be raised, whenever possible, by their biological parents. … Yet in principle, the 1995 proclamation on the family says it perfectly: “Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.”\n\nElder Bruce C. Hafen, from the address, “Marriage, Family Law, and the Temple,” delivered at the J. Reuben Clark Law Society Annual Fireside in Salt Lake City on January 31, 2014.\n\n[God’s] vision of marriage as a holy order based on enduring covenants, duties, and lifelong sacrifice stands in stark contrast to a modern secular concept of marriage. That worldly formulation has virtually nothing to do with losing your life in service to family or in self-sacrifice for spouse and children. …\n\n===\n\nNever has a global society placed so much emphasis on the fulfillment of romantic and sexual desires as the highest form of personal autonomy, freedom, and self-actualization. Society has elevated sexual fulfillment to an end in itself rather than as a means to a higher end. In this confusion, millions have lost the truth that God intended sexual desire to be a means to the divine ends of marital unity, the procreation of children, and strong families, not a selfish end in itself.\n\n====\n\nWe are losing the basic understanding that society has a unique and profound interest in marriage because of its power to form a male-female union that is the optimal setting for the bearing and rearing of children—ensuring to the greatest extent possible that every child has an opportunity to know and to be loved and cared for by the mother and father who brought him or her into the world.\n\nElder David A.

As one who was raised by a widowed mother, I know firsthand that this cannot always be achieved, but it is the ideal to be sought whenever possible… We also need politicians, policy makers, and officials to increase their attention to what is best for children in contrast to the selfish interests of voters and vocal advocates of adult interests.\n\nElder Dallin H.

Married men were more involved and had better relationships with their children than unwed or divorced fathers. In part, this was because married fathers shared the same residence with their children.

These researchers observed 173 girls and their families for eight years to determine if more negative-coercive family relationships in early childhood provoke earlier reproductive development in adolescence. It was found that the quality of a fathers’ investment in the family was the most important aspect of the proximal family environment relative to influencing a daughter’s pubertal timing. Girls reared in father-absent homes reached menarche several months earlier than their peers in father-present homes. The longer the paternal absence, the earlier was the onset of puberty. … The greater the time spent by fathers in child care and the greater the level of father- daughter affection, the more delayed was the onset of menarche.\n\nSee Ellis, Bruce J, McFadyen-Ketchum, Steven, Dodge, Kenneth A, Pettit, Gregory S, & Bates, John E.

The number of abortions in the city is similarly sky high. For every five live births in Springfield, two children are aborted.

A large body of social science research indicates that healthy, married-parent families are an optimal environment for promoting the well-being of children.

Given that a growing share of America’s youth spends some time in a single-parent family, it is imperative that parents (as well as families and communities more generally) strive to provide their children with a strong balance of nurture and control to minimize delinquent behavior, particularly the more serious forms to which adolescents in single-parent families appear to be especially susceptible.”\n\nDemuth, Stephen, & Brown, Susan L.

The War on Poverty largely failed because it ignored the role of marriage in reducing poverty. Poverty is most prevalent in non-intact families. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-parent families are significantly more likely to fall into poverty than are married-couple families:\n\nOver 2 million children reside in single-parent families. Never married single mother families constitute the greatest portion of single parent families. While the share of divorced and separated single mothers has decreased in recent years (although the numbers are still high), the share of never married single mothers continues to rapidly rise. This trend is particularly alarming because, of all family structures, children of never married mothers are the most likely to experience poverty. In 2015, 49.8 percent of children under age 18 who lived with a never married mother were in poverty.

Hodges, cite work in which “Sullins found that, while outcomes for children with opposite-sex parents improved if their parents were married, outcomes for children with same-sex parents were notably worse if their parents were married rather than unmarried.” In this latest study, using data from the congressionally mandated National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (the primary data source for the three best studies used to support the “no differences” theory), Dr. Sullins finds that children of reported married same-sex parents are more likely than those of unmarried same-sex parents, unmarried opposite-sex parents, or married opposite-sex parents to experience depressive symptoms, unhappiness, daily fear or crying, and anxiety.”\n\nHall, J., The Research on Same-Sex Parenting: ‘No Differences’ No More, Heritage Foundation, 23 Apr 2015.\n\nDr. Mark Regnerus, professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, addressed each of the three main problems with the earlier studies [suggesting no parenting difference between same-sex couples and heterosexual parents]. His research found that, similar to children from non-intact families, those children who at some point during their childhood lived with one parent and that parent’s same-sex partner fared, on average, significantly worse than children of married biological parents on a multitude of measures, including their educational progress as children and eventual employment and dependence on public assistance in adulthood. His study … seriously challenges the notion that the “no differences” conclusion is settled science.\n\nHall, J., “The Research on Same-Sex Parenting: ‘No Differences’ No More”, Heritage Foundation, 23 Apr 2015.\n\nMarital Vows\n\nLifelong\n\nSee also paragraph 8, sentence A [Divorce].\n\nMarriage benefits individuals, families, and society.

The gap in marriage is growing, especially in terms of childbearing. While marriage is struggling against cultural, social and economic headwinds in poorer communities, it is flourishing among affluent, well-educated Americans who are both more likely to marry and more likely to stay married:\n\nDespite the growing retreat from marriage in both Canada and the United States, cross-sectional studies clearly show that married individuals enjoy longer lives and are in better physical and mental health than their non-married counterparts. … Confirming what has been reported in other studies, we find that marriage continues to be beneficial for mental health. Specifically, we find that those who are married in 1994 and do not experience any transition in marital status over the course of the survey report significantly lower levels of distress relative to those who remain single, separated or divorced. Consistent with longitudinal studies that prospectively compare the mental health status of those who make a change in marital status with those who do not, we find that entry into marriage is associated with lower levels of distress and a transition out of marriage increases psychological distress.\n\nStrohschein, Lisa, McDonough, Peggy, Monette, Georges, & Shao, Qing.

This is the first generational overview of how Americans think about sexual fidelity online in the wake of the internet revolution and the first study of the links between sexual fidelity online and relationship quality among American men and women. … It included participants from Generation X and the millennial, baby boomer and silent/greatest generations.\n\n—-\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n—-\n\n• Although a clear majority of Americans in all generations express support for sexual fidelity in their relationships and report they are sexually faithful in real life, today’s young adults are markedly more likely to cross online boundaries related to sex and romance. For example, 18% of millennial participants engaged in sexual talk online with someone besides their partner, compared to 3% of greatest/silent generation participants, 6% of baby boomers, and 16% of Gen Xers.\n\n—\n\n• Several online behaviors are rated by most Americans (70% or more) as “unfaithful” or “cheating,” including having a secret emotional relationship or sexting with someone other than a partner/spouse without the partner’s/spouse’s knowledge and consent.\n\n—-\n\n• Married and cohabiting men and women who maintain strong boundaries online against potential sexual and romantic alternatives are more likely to be happy in their relationships.\n\nThose currently married or cohabiting who blur these boundaries online are significantly less happy, less committed and more likely to break up, while, conversely, those taking a more careful stance to attractive alternatives online are happier, more committed and less likely to separate.\n\nBromley, A.

Regular participation in worship services may reinforce religious plausibility structures and belief systems; thus, persons who internalize these religious values and norms may be dissuaded from indulging any temptation. …\n\n———–\n\nOur findings suggest that specific theological beliefs, specifically views about the Bible, are also directly related to infidelity. Persons who agree that the Bible is the literal word of God are less prone to engage in marital infidelity than their counterparts who ascribe no sacred significance to the Bible, and this relationship persists even with controls for religious affiliation and frequency of attendance at services. Likewise, persons who regard the Bible as the inspired (but not literal) word of God are also less inclined toward infidelity than nonbelievers. Our findings suggest that such biblical beliefs may translate into greater resistance to sexual temptation on the part of married persons. This suggests that doctrines of moral conservatism and restraint are associated with real differences in personal behavior rather than simply beliefs.\n\nBurdette, Amy & Ellison, Christopher & Sherkat, Darren & Gore, Kurt.

In these cases, we urge the husband to do all in his power to allow his wife to remain in the home caring for the children while he continues to provide for his family the best he can, even though the job he is able to secure may not be ideal and family budgeting will have to be tighter.\n\nPresident Ezra Taft Benson, “To the Mothers in Zion,” Special worldwide address to parents, February 22 1987,\n\n“The great majority of Latter-day Saint mothers earnestly want to follow this counsel.

But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither. … He turned aside into the parts of Galilee.\n\nThe father is the protector of the home. He guards it against the intrusion of evil from without. Formerly he protected his home with weapons and shuttered windows. Today the task is more complex. Barred doors and windows protect only against the intrusion of a corporeal creature. It is not an easy thing to protect one’s family against intrusions of evil into the minds and spirits of family members. These influences can and do flow freely into the home. Satan can subtly beguile the children of men in ways we have already mentioned in this conference. He need not break down the door. Fathers, you will have to live close to the Lord.

Why wouldn’t he speak on that? I mean, he studies and speaks on it all the time, so it’s an obvious choice!” Well, let me tell you that it wasn’t so obvious to me. I didn’t want to default into a topic. The purpose of the devotional speaker is to be the Lord’s instrument to deliver the message He wants delivered.\n\nBecause I know that our Father knows and loves each of you perfectly, like the prophet Alma, I have studied and pondered and “fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself…” and to know what message the Lord would have me deliver to you.\n\nI tell you this because I know that every person who stands at this podium has done the very same thing as I have, and I hope today you’ll receive the personal epistle the Lord has for you.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAnd now a quick disclaimer: What I share today about the importance of fathers in no way minimizes or takes away from the vital and sacred role of mothers. There is too much in our world today that is trying “to stir up the hearts of men [and women] with anger, one against another.” This is certainly not the Lord’s way!\n\nWith that, I invite the Holy Ghost to be with each of us as we learn together today.\n\nTwo Suffocating Experiences\n\nWhen I was about six years old, I had two different experiences that, at the time, felt like near-death experiences. The first happened at school. We were outside at recess when the bell rang telling us it was time to head back to class. Unfortunately, a bunch of us reached the door at the same time and there became a terrible bottle neck. I happened to be in the front of this traffic jam that had tripped onto the floor. Then a huge doggy pile began as more and more children reached the door. It was getting harder and harder to breathe at the bottom of this pile. I remember looking up and seeing one girl joyfully pushing other children on top of the pile! I desperately looked for someone—anyone—to help pull me out. Other children in front of me just stared in both amusement and horror. (Useless little…) Well, I made it out, obviously, but that traumatic event left me a little more untrusting of my classmates.\n\nThe second experience took place at a small water park about 15 minutes from my home. I remember riding down a water slide, plunging into the pool at the bottom, and then noticing that my feet couldn’t reach the bottom of the pool. The current from the water slides made it difficult to tread water for a child my size, who also lacked swimming experience. I struggled to stay afloat as I went under, came up, went under, and came up again. Just as before, it was getting more and more difficult to breathe, and I really felt that I wasn’t going to make it. Just as I was about to go under again, my Dad appeared. I don’t remember whether he reached into the water or jumped in altogether, but he saved me from what felt like certain death.\n\nNow, in both instances I was being suffocated by my surroundings and was desperately looking for someone to rescue me. And even though I made it out alive, only at the water park did I experience comfort and assurance because my father was both near and attentive, presiding over my welfare, providing life-sustaining breath, and protecting me from a strong current.\n\nThe State of Boys, Men, and Fathers Today\n\nTragically, brothers and sisters, millions of children today are being suffocated by evil influences in this fallen world without a father near or attentive to protect them. Let me explain:\n\nBoys today are much more likely than girls to have discipline problems at school, to be misdiagnosed with ADHD, to dropout from high school and college, and to become addicted to video gaming, drugs, and pornography. Boys today are less likely than girls to graduate from college, earn a graduate degree, and own a home. Far fewer young men get married and stay married today than just a couple decades ago. Young adult men are more likely than young adult women to live with a parent than they are to live with a partner or spouse. Men are also more likely than women to commit suicide, break the law, and be in prison.\n\nYou can probably see how these trends are both a cause and an effect of fatherlessness. In the United States alone, over 40 percent of children are born to unwed mothers. And of the mothers that do marry, nearly half of those marriages will end in divorce, often resulting in a less involved or absent father. It is no wonder 24 million children in America, one out of three children, are growing up in biological father absent homes. If you think it has always been this way, think again! In 1960, 9 in 10 children resided with their two married parents. As I have reviewed the research on this, I have found that this absentee-dad epidemic is a social engine driving many of the serious problems in the world, including those previously mentioned regarding boys and young men. For example, there is evidence to suggest that fatherlessness is fueling poverty, abortion, child abuse, school dropouts, school shootings, obesity, cohabitation, divorce, and sexual exploitation, namely: pornography, sex trafficking, and prostitution (and I’m just getting started).\n\nTo make matters worse, the media that many of us consume often depicts men and fathers to be downright useless. Elder D. Todd Christofferson described it in these words:\n\nIn too many Hollywood films, TV and cable shows, and even commercials, men are portrayed as incompetent, immature, or self-absorbed. This cultural emasculation of males is having a damaging effect …. Some men and young men have taken the negative signals as an excuse to avoid responsibility and never really grow up.\n\nPerhaps after hearing all this, you too are feeling suffocated and overwhelmed. You should.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I testify to you that Satan—the father of contention and the father of all lies —has been behind this war on fathers for a long time. You had better believe that he and his followers know full well that “the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of [God’s] children.”\n\nAll is Well in Zion\n\nNow brethren, you may hear about the state of men and fathers today and think to yourself, “That’s too bad for the rest of the world, but I don’t plan on fathering children out of wedlock and becoming incarcerated, and I am planning on graduating from college and avoiding my parents’ basement,” to which I would respond, “Good for you— but not good enough.” This kind of attitude can lead to complacency. The prophet Nephi warned us of this very thing:\n\nAnd others will [Satan] pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell …. Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!\n\nAll is not well in Zion! We can’t believe that Latter-day Saints are immune to these problems. Not only is this belief false, it doesn’t invite us to look inward and examine ourselves to see where we can improve and what we are lacking. We can’t have the attitude like many parents watching the television show Supernanny, who derive comfort from the thought, “Well, at least I’m not as bad as those parents!” No, we cannot look to the world’s standards and trends and derive comfort from not being as bad. As the Lord has said, “For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation.”\n\nLet me address one more idea that can breed apathy and indifference: It is my observation that in the culture of the Church, some of the men have bought into the idea that their only hope for exaltation is to find a woman who will drag them to the celestial kingdom kicking and screaming. This attitude may stem from a belief that men and fathers are inferior to women and mothers. I know nothing in the words of ancient and modern prophets that teaches men are the lesser gender and that fathers are the inferior parent.\n\nNo, brethren—it is by divine design that “mothers and fathers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.” Do not let our different roles and capacities allow us to misinterpret our worth or capability. Men, you are to compliment and complete women, not just the other way around. Remember the second half of the Apostle Paul’s declaration: “Neither is… the woman without the man, in the Lord.”\n\nYes, responsible men and fathers are vital for both children and society. But to Latter-day Saints, fathers are much more. Again from Elder Christofferson:\n\nSome see the good of fatherhood in social terms, as something that obligates men to their offspring, impelling them to be good citizens and to think about the needs of others, supplementing “maternal investment in children with paternal investment in children.” . . . While these considerations are certainly true and important, we know that fatherhood is much more than a social construct or the product of evolution. The role of father is of divine origin, beginning with a Father in Heaven and, in this mortal sphere, with Father Adam. The perfect, divine expression of fatherhood is our Heavenly Father.\n\nYou Were Designed to be a Father\n\nIronically, sometimes I think that we Latter-day Saints speak of wanting to become like our Heavenly Father by developing His knowledge and perfect attributes, without focusing on becoming what He is: a parent—more specifically, a father. Men, our inherent mental, physical, and spiritual capacities are not simply for us to grow from boys to men.\n\nIn a manual produced by the Church titled A Parent’s Guide, we read this profound doctrinal statement:\n\n“Since a major purpose of our mortal existence is to become like our Heavenly Father…and since eternal life with our Father will be lived in family units, the ultimate goal of a man or boy is to become an effective husband and father….”\n\nThat is how men reach the full measure of their creation. I realize that in this fallen world, fatherhood won’t be a reality for all men for a variety of reasons. But that shouldn’t excuse us of working toward our eventual destiny whether in this life or the next. Brethren, if your goal is exaltation, your goal is fatherhood. As Elder Dyches taught us last week:\n\n“Never lose sight of your purpose on earth and your divine destiny.”\n\nPrepare for Fatherhood Now!\n\nWhen I started teaching at BYU-Idaho about seven years ago, I would occasionally play basketball at the I-Center with students. And, looking like a student myself back then, I more than once had a conversation that went something like this in between games when students would discover that I was a faculty member:\n\nStudent: “Whoa, I thought you were a student. What classes do you teach?”\n\nMe: “Parenting (and other classes). You should take the class.”\n\nStudent: [awkward pause] “Yeah, maybe I’ll worry about that when I have kids.”\n\nMe: “So you’re saying that you are willing to spend thousands of dollars and at least four years of your life learning to become the best _____ (fill in the blank) you can be, but when it comes to the most important work you’ll ever do and the purpose of your creation, you’re just going to wing it?”\n\nStudent: “Well…that’s not totally what I meant.”\n\nMe: “Well, that’s what it totally sounds like, dude!”\n\nBrethren, the time to start preparing for fatherhood was yesterday. But since that is not an option, how about today? Why not begin by seeing most everything you do in your life now as fatherhood preparation? This focus will give more purpose into the important things you are already doing such as your educational, professional, romantic, and other pursuits. A fatherhood focus will also provide both the wisdom and the strength to eliminate those things in your life that are unnecessary, distracting, or self-centered.\n\nOn the devotional discussion board, Lehi Estrada, a BYU-Idaho student from the Philippines put it this way:\n\nOne thing I had been experiencing lately is trying to set my priorities in order. As a college student, you can shift more of your focus on what class you are failing, or [your] calling or just “ resting” for a while. In setting priorities, I always remember…Him. Christ is a great example of what is the most important thing we could do today or tomorrow…. Setting priorities makes me accountable and prepares me to do impossible things.\n\nTo help with your preparation and priorities, I’d like to take you through a brief crash-course on fatherhood preparation. Did you know that the purpose of the Aaronic—or preparatory priesthood—was not simply to prepare you to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood? The oath and covenant and duties of the priesthood are to make us into righteous and capable fathers.\n\nIf you weren’t aware of that as a young man (as I was not), we can turn to “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” for a clear and concise description of what we should be preparing to be doing as fathers.\n\n“By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.” 13\n\nPreside. Provide. Protect. I’m sure we’ve all heard these three “Ps” before, but it’s not enough to know about them. We need to:\n\nObtain a deeper understanding of each of these three principles\n\nKnow what each principle looks like in fatherhood and how to prepare for it. Determine if our current thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors are impeding or promoting fatherhood preparation\n\nLet’s briefly explore each of these items in each of the three Ps. Now I know that we men have a tendency to compartmentalize things in life, and that is appropriate at times; however, it’s important to understand that presiding, providing, and protecting are not three discrete and disconnected principles. In fact, they appropriately overlap, promote, and reinforce each other. I encourage you to look for this overlap and these connections as we move through each principle.\n\nPreside\n\nIn a pamphlet produced by the church, it gives a terrific definition of what it means to preside:\n\nFatherhood is leadership, the most important kind of leadership. It has always been so; it always will be so.\n\nPresident Ezra Taft Benson further explained:\n\nAs the patriarch in your home, you…must help create a home where the Spirit of the Lord can abide. Your place is to give direction to all family life. You should take an active part in establishing family rules and discipline.\n\nYour homes should be havens of peace and joy for your family. Surely no child should fear his own father—especially a priesthood father. A father’s duty is to make his home a place of happiness and joy. He cannot do this when there is bickering, quarreling, contention, or unrighteous behavior. The powerful effect of righteous fathers in setting an example…is vital to the spiritual welfare of his children.\n\nFor a real-life example of how difficult this can be, let’s watch my own family in action. I recorded this video of my children about five years ago, and it was after a long day at the pool. Think about how you might preside in a situation like this.\n\n“There is beauty all around….” Notice that there was bickering, quarreling, and contention. Also notice that every child stated they were not ready for scripture study, including my son, Carter, who walked out of the room. So what is the proper response? If you think punishment, lecturing, or you’d just let your wife handle it, think again.\n\nBrethren, learn to deal with chaos and know how to respond rather than react. Learn to influence rather than control others through persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love. This can be practiced with those around you—especially with those whose opinions and personalities differ from your own. Unlike a video game, you won’t be able choose or manipulate your children’s personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, but you can choose how you see, respond to, and influence them. If you struggle with anger, taking the initiative, or learning from others, then perhaps picturing your future children will give you renewed purpose and strength to change.\n\nProvide\n\nThat brings us to providing the necessities of life. But what are the necessities? Temporally it might include food, water, clothing, a modest home, and a good education. This is a good start, but let us not forget the most universal human need: love. As President Dieter F. Uchtdorf has said, “In family relationships love is really spelled t-i- m-e, time.” When children of varying ages are asked what they appreciate most about their fathers, the most common response is “He spends time with me.” Regarding preparing to provide, Elder Christofferson said this:\n\nTo young men, recognizing the role you will have as provider and protector, we say, prepare now by being diligent in school and planning for postsecondary training. Education, whether in a university, technical school, apprenticeship, or similar program, is key to developing the skills and capabilities you will need. Take advantage of opportunities to associate with people of all ages, including children, and learn how to establish healthy and rewarding relationships.\n\nEven more important than this is providing for spiritual nourishment of your children. This includes leading your family in council, home evening, prayer, scripture study, and much more. If you struggle with offering your time and talents to better others or if you are not feeding your own spirit every day through scripture study and meaningful prayer, then perhaps picturing your future children will give you renewed purpose and strength to change.\n\nProtect\n\nElder A. Theodore Tuttle of the Seventy observed this about protecting our families:\n\nThe father is the protector of the home. He guards it against the intrusion of evil from without. Formerly he protected his home with weapons and shuttered windows. Today the task is more complex. Barred doors and windows protect only against the intrusion of a [physical] creature. It is not an easy thing to protect one’s family against intrusions of evil into the minds and spirits of family members. These influences can and do flow freely into the home. Satan can subtly beguile the children of men …. He need not break down the door.\n\nFathers, you will have to live close to the Lord. Develop a sensitivity to the impressions of the Spirit.\n\nThis was 1973, well before WiFi and mobile devices could allow for evil influences to flow freely into the home. Sadly, many men become desensitized to the immorality, violence, and foul language found in much of our media today long before they become fathers. When this happens, it can be quite difficult to both detect and eliminate virtual intruders in the home.\n\nThere is another protective factor in fatherhood. Daughters who are raised in a home with an involved father are far less likely to be sexually active as teens, less likely to struggle with self-worth, and much more likely to develop healthy relationships with men throughout her life. What a sacred protective power a father naturally wields!\n\nIn the scriptures we read of men who literally use a sword to defend their freedom, peace, wives, and children. However, your muscles—no matter how big they are—will not protect your child struggling with body image, drugs, depression, or testimony. Today we fathers are to wield the sword of truth to protect our peace, wives, and children, which requires the spiritual strength to do so. Brethren, if you struggle with protecting your own mind, body, and spirit from false, immoral, violent, and other evil influences then perhaps picturing your future children will give you renewed purpose and strength to change.\n\nIf you would like to view a great example of the three Ps in action, I encourage you to watch the Mormon Message titled “Earthly Father, Heavenly Father.”\n\nBrethren, just two more questions for your sincere pondering:\n\nIf your son had the same thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors as you have, would you be proud?\n\nIf other men thought about and interacted with your daughter the way you think about and interact with the women around you, would you be pleased?\n\nI truly hope this crash-course in fatherhood has inspired you to hasten your preparation to preside, provide, and protect. I encourage you to further your learning by taking advantage of learning from general conference talks, evidence-based books, parenting classes, the righteous fathers in your life, and our Heavenly Father’s parenting manual—the scriptures.\n\nI also encourage all single and married sisters to follow a similar pattern we have done here in regards to motherhood. You sisters can also use this talk as a guide to know what to look for and encourage in the men in your life.\n\nMen Are That They Might Have Joy…in Fatherhood\n\nMy fellow priesthood brethren, I know that changing diapers or staying up all night with a sick child or being sassed by a teenager doesn’t sound like much fun, but fun is not the purpose of our existence. When speaking to his sons who were struggling to grow up, the prophet Lehi taught: “ …men are, that they might have joy. ” In spite of all the difficulty and sacrifice fatherhood brings, a fullness of joy only comes to a man as he strives to fulfill the measure of his creation as a husband and father.\n\nPersonal Examples\n\nIf you’ll allow me, I’d like to close by giving you a small glimpse into the refinement and joy I have experienced a"
