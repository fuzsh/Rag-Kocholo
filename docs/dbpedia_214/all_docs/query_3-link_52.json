        "text": "Like MMJ, The Black Crowes chooswe some awesome material usually ecliup\n\nThis compilation needs no introduction. It’s 44 SBD recordings of every single cover that The Black Crowes played during their 2005-2006 tour (with Marc Ford on lead guitar). If you’ve ever wanted to dip your hand into a treasure chest of rock ‘n’ roll history and grab a random classic song, this is your mix.\n\nOnly reconstructed by The Black Crowes. Considering that the band is taking an extended break after the end of their lengthy upcoming tour, you might as well go ahead and grab this fantastic compilation (after the jump). The Black Crowes are truly one of the greatest American bands of our generation.\n\nTHE BLACK CROWES COVERS (2005-2006) – (SBDs)\n\n01. Don’t Do It (The Band)\n\n02. Got To Get Better In A Little While (Eric Clapton)\n\n03. Oh, The Rain (Traditional/Blind Willie Johnson)\n\n04. Space Captain (Mad Dogs & The Englishmen)\n\n05.

Polly (Traditional/Ray Davies)\n\nOne of the few groups that offer the complete shows for download or on cd. Nice!\n\nI was lucky when I saw them in '06 with Ford. It's such a crap shoot as to whether or not they're going to play \"your\" song and the night I saw them they played \"Wiser Time\" and \"Lay It All On Me\". Two of my absolute favorites. It was a great show and thanks to \"Instant Live\" I've got it on a 2 disc set. Love TBC!!\n\nI was at the Holmdel, NJ for the '06 show, a really good show, w/ Ford singing \"Alabama\" that night.\n\nThe show ended rather oddly, instead of the band coming together for its customary bow following the encore, the guys all just took off their instruments, stood by their setups, the backup singers came to the front with Chris, but none of them really acknowledged each other, waved to the crowd, and 1/2 of them went off in one direction ,and the other 1/2 in the other. I thought that was just very unusual.\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, Ford had left the band again.\n\nSadly, TBC are perhaps the least appreciated legendary band of the last twenty years.\n\nI saw them in L.A. during the '05 Tour (perhaps their best ever?) and Marc Ford and Company totally tore the lid off the joint. I was lucky enough to be there the night they did \"Dreams\" with Ben Harper sitting in on lap steal for the encore. Outrageous.\n\nIn terms of these being CD-R's, have no fear -- sound quality is EXCELLENT across the board. I own perhaps a dozen of these shows from that tour and the quality couldn't be better."
