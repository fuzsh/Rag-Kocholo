        "text": "While there’s little love between brothers Rich and Chris Robinson, there’s no shortage of adulation for their former band The Black Crowes. Fortunately, for fans who are still eager to hear Black Crowes music, there’s a new project in the works!\n\nRich Robinson has recruited former Black Crowes members guitarist/vocalist Marc Ford, keyboardist Eddie Harsch and bassist Sven Pipien for a new band called Magpie Salute, cleverly playing off the “crow” theme. Rich Robinson Band members Joe Magistro and Matt Slocum, as well as backing vocalists Adrien Reju and Katrine Ottosen, complete the lineup of this new ensemble.\n\nThe band will make their debut on January 19th in NYC’s Gramercy Theatre! Robinson talks about the band, saying “The name The Magpie Salute comes from a superstition based in the UK… There are many variations, but the version I’m drawn to is the belief that if you see a Magpie, you would do well to salute it ‘to ward off negativity, or to have a good day.’ The way you salute the Magpie, based on some traditions is to say ‘Good Mornin’ Captain.’ The reason we salute is to show we’re unarmed, or what I like to say is ‘we come in peace.’ The Magpie falls within the Crowe umbrella of species, figuratively and literally. Magpies can be black and white which represents the light and the dark. I figured all of these things touch on many aspects of my life and this experience.”\n\nCheck out a preview of the new band in the video below."
