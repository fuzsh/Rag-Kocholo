        "text": "The Black Crowes are one of the most influential rock bands of the past three decades. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide and have been praised for their authentic and soulful blend of blues, rock, and southern roots music. The band was formed in 1989 by brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, who shared a passion for classic rock artists like The Rolling Stones, The Faces, and The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nThe Black Crowes made their debut in 1990 with Shake Your Money Maker, which spawned four hit singles: “Jealous Again”, “She Talks to Angels”, “Hard to Handle”, and “Twice as Hard”. The album was certified five times platinum in the US and established the band as a force to be reckoned with in the rock scene. The band followed up with The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion in 1992, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and featured two more hits: “Remedy” and “Thorn in My Pride”.\n\nThe Black Crowes have released eight more studio albums since then, each showcasing their musical evolution and diversity. They have experimented with different styles, genres, and collaborators, such as Jimmy Page, Luther Dickinson, and Rich Robinson’s wife Kate Hudson. They have also endured several hiatuses, lineup changes, and personal conflicts, but have always managed to reunite and deliver electrifying live performances.\n\nIn 2023, the Black Crowes are set to perform at the Bourbon and Beyond festival in Louisville, Kentucky. The festival is a celebration of music, food, and bourbon, featuring some of the biggest names in rock, country, blues, and soul. The Black Crowes are expected to play a mix of their classic hits and new material from their upcoming album 1972, which is a tribute to their favorite songs from that year.\n\nThe Black Crowes are a band that has never compromised their artistic vision or integrity. They have stayed true to their roots and influences, while also exploring new musical horizons. They have influenced countless artists and fans with their raw and powerful sound. They are a band that deserves to be seen and heard live, especially at a festival like Bourbon and Beyond."
