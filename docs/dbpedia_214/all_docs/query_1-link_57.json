        "text": "After delivering a memorable performance at The Met Philly last night, The Black Crowes were back for another round in Philly, headlining NON-COMM night two with a high-volume set in an intimate setting.\n\nThe group started off strong with “No Speak No Slave” from The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. As Chris Robinson’s iconic vocals paired the group’s insane guitar riffs, complete with backup vocals, the sardine-packed audience was a sea of head-banging and rocking out. You know a show is good when the sound mixer is getting into it.\n\nFirst formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, the Black Crowes are an iconic hard rock band with country and soul influences. Over the past few decades they’ve worked in spurts, taking a hiatus between 2002 and ’05 and breaking up in 2015 but regrouping four years later. The current lineup includes Chris and Rich Robinson, bassist Sven Pipien, and newer members Nico Bereciartua on guitar, Cully Symington on the drums, and Erik Deutsch on keys.\n\nOn the World Cafe Live stage, the Crowes transitioned to a few songs from their newest album — Happiness Bastards, their first in 11 years, which dropped March 15th. “For that is what we are,” remarked Chris Robinson. “Wanting and Waiting” totally reflected that vibe, with the crowd chanting the refrain, “blood on fire!” Their latest single, “Wilted Rose,” was a soulful ballad that marks the Crowes’ first collaboration, with Lainey Wilson on the recorded version.\n\nThen it was time to get back to the classics. After all, what’s a Black Crowes show without their cover of Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle”? This rendition at World Cafe Live rendition rocked the house, followed by their iconic power ballad “She Talks To Angels.” ich Robinson absolutely killed his solo in “Jealous Again,” and the band ended the set with “Remedy,” sending the crowd into an absolute frenzy before throwing guitar picks to their audience and heading out. Mic drop."
