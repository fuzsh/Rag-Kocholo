        "text": "Photo Credit: Ross Halfin\n\nLegendary rock band The Black Crowes announce their hugely anticipated new album, Happiness Bastards, set for worldwide release March 15 via the band’s own Silver Arrow Records. Produced by GRAMMY Award-Winning producer Jay Joyce, the project is The Black Crowes’ tenth studio album and their first original music in 15 years.\n\nHappiness Bastards is a blistering record that is both fresh, yet quintessential rock n’ roll. The thrilling news is kicked off with the release of the riff-ripping lead single “Wanting and Waiting,” an exhilarating taste of what’s to come with the signature flair and attitude of one of the most vital rock bands of this generation.\n\n2024 marks 40 years since the inception of The Black Crowes, and the Robinson Brothers are claiming this momentous year as their own. Following decades marked by sex, drugs, fights, breakups, and divorce, they are leaving their bullshit behind. Serving as a salute to their past and a celebration of the present and future, the new album includes 10 original tracks, with a very special feature from GRAMMY-nominated superstar Lainey Wilson. While they have dealt with their share of differences over the years, they are now two happy bastards, with a triumphant album to show for it.\n\nThe Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson said, “Happiness Bastards is our love letter to rock n’ roll. Rich and I are always writing and creating music; that has never stopped for us, and it is always where we find harmony together. This record represents that,” Rich Robinson continued, “This album is a continuation of our story as a band. Our years of experience writing and making music and touring the world are represented in this record, and we were brilliantly guided by one of the best producers in the business, Jay Joyce. I am incredibly proud of what we put together.”\n\nIn celebration of the forthcoming new record, The Black Crowes will be returning to the road this Spring with tour dates set in North America, the U.K., and Europe. Additional details to be announced soon.\n\nThe Black Crowes are leaving the bullshit in the past. 15 years after their last album of original music, the Robinson Brothers present Happiness Bastards - their 10th studio album. Some may say the project has been several tumultuous years in the making, but we argue it's arriving at just the right time. Call it brotherly love or music destiny that brought them back together, the highly anticipated record consecrating the reunion of this legendary band just may be the thing that saves rock & roll. In a time where the art form is buried beneath the corporate sheen of its successors, The Black Crowes are biting back with the angst of words left unsaid penned on paper and electrified by guitar strings, revealing stripped, bare-boned rock & roll. No gloss, no glitter, just rhythm and blues at it's very best - gritty, loud, and in your face.\n\nSince The Black Crowes reunited in 2019, they've made a triumphant return to form with over 150 shows spanning 20 countries worldwide, celebrating the 30th anniversary of Shake Your Money Maker, the album that put them on the map. Upon their return from the road, they knew they needed something new to show for their lost time. The Robinson Brothers and longtime bassist Sven Pipien headed to the studio with producer Jay Joyce in early 2023 and the experiences of years past transcribed themself through the music as the band found their way back to their roots. And it's finally here - Happiness Bastards is out March 15, 2024.\n\nFOLLOW THE BLACK CROWES"
