        "text": "The Happiness Bastards Tour Rocks Ovens Auditorium\n\nIt’s been almost 35 years since The Black Crowes shook up the rock world with their eponymous debut album Shake Your Moneymaker and I’m happy to report that the band is still kicking ass and taking names. After years of turmoil in the relationship between brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, the two resolved their differences in 2019. They announced a planned tour in 2020 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their iconic debut record. Of course, we all know Covid shut down live music. Still, the tour would eventually roll on selling out arenas all over the U.S. This past March, the band released their ninth studio album and first new music in 15 years, Happiness Bastards, an outstanding collection of blues rock classics in the making.\n\nThe Crowes are out on tour in support of the new record and last week made a stop here in the Queen City bringing a rock and roll revival to Ovens Auditorium. The venue was already packed with fans when I arrived and the line for the merch stand wrapped around the staircase and all the way to the other side of the lobby. Clearly, fans were out in full force and ready for an incredible night of rock and roll.\n\nThe stage setup reflected a real old-time vibe with huge curtains tied off on each side and rows and stacks of vintage amplifiers lining the rear. At the center of the stage was a huge mirror surrounded by vanity-style light bulbs and at the top of the mirror was a riser for the drummer, keyboard player, and backup vocalists. A huge Happiness Bastards banner was hung across the front and strings of party lights cascaded across the stage from side to side making a very warm, homey feel.\n\nThe venue lights dimmed and a recording of AC/DC’s “It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ‘N’ Roll)” began to play. The band members made their way out taking their respective spots on the stage. Lastly, we had Rich Robinson and Chris Robinson, the heart and soul of the Crowes, head out as they kicked things off with “Bedside Manners” from the latest record. From the very first notes, The Black Crowes were on absolute fire. Chris was the consummate rock and roll showman, holding his mic stand over his head, and utilizing the mirror to dance, pout, and pose for the audience. His vocals were spot on with his signature bluesy rasp sounding better than ever. Rich was more low-key as usual sticking closer to his mic stand and letting his fingers do the talking.\n\nThis was a rock and roll show ladies and gentlemen and The Black Crowes put on a hell of a performance. Keeping things simple, with giant spotlights and an occasional wash of color, the focus was on the music and the music was heavenly. The band exudes everything there is to love about rock and roll with bluesy riffs, top-notch songs, and sing-along choruses. Add in the fantastic backing band and a little blues harp and what’s not to love?\n\nThe set list for the evening was a little different from their last tour. The focus was definitely on Happiness Bastards with a few rare gems thrown into the mix. I have to say that typically the new songs don’t get the same audience response as all the old hits, but that wasn’t the case tonight. The new music got a huge outpouring of love from the audience as they sang along, already knowing the lyrics and the songs inside and out. In my opinion, Happiness Bastards is one of the best records The Black Crowes has made and I would put it right up there with Shake Your Moneymaker and it was pure rock joy to hear these songs live. We also got to hear a few songs that normally might not make the setlist cut with “Greasy Grass River” from the Lions album and “Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution.” Of course, we still got a few Black Crowes’ classics with “She Talks To Angels” and their fabulous cover of Otis Redding’s “Hard To Handle” but I think my favorite of the night was “Wanting and Waiting” from the new record. The song brought a smile to my face as I danced and swayed.\n\nMusic fans everywhere were overjoyed when the Robinson brothers reconciled. They were both fantastic musicians in their own bands but when they are together in The Black Crowes it is something special. Tonight’s performance showed us a bit of that magic and left us with a renewed sense of rock and roll spirit.\n\nDon’t miss your chance to catch The Black Crowes when they bring their rock and roll revival to a city near you. There are only a few shows left on this run before the band heads overseas, but you’ll be able to catch them again here in the States this fall as they open up for Aerosmith’s Peace Out farewell tour.\n\nSee the Full Gallery of the Night Here!\n\nIf you captured any shots of the night, feel free to tag us on social media at Shutter 16 Magazine and throw in #Shutter16 and #TwitFromThePit for the world to see.\n\nClick Here for Tour Dates and Ticket Information!"
