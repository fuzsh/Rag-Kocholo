        "text": "The Black Crowes rock band is going on tour in support of their new album that will be released in March.\n\n“Happiness Bastards” is the band’s 10th studio album and the first in 15 years. The record by brothers Chris and Rich Robinson will be released on March 15, 2024.\n\n“Some may say the project has been several tumultuous years in the making, but we argue it’s arriving at just the right time.\n\n“Call it brotherly love or music destiny that brought them back together, the highly anticipated record consecrating the reunion of this legendary band just may be the thing that saves rock & roll.”\n\nThe “Happiness Bastards” tour includes two stops in Pennsylvania:\n\nFriday, May 3, 8 p.m., Wind Creek Event Center, Bethlehem\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats, SeatGeek\n\nTuesday, May 7, 8 p.m., The Met, Philadelphia\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats, SeatGeek\n\n“In a time where the art form is buried beneath the corporate sheen of its successors, The Black Crowes are biting back with the angst of words left unsaid penned on paper and electrified by guitar strings, revealing stripped, bare-boned rock & roll. No gloss, no glitter, just rhythm and blues at it’s very best – gritty, loud, and in your face,” The Black Crowes said on their website.\n\n“Since The Black Crowes reunited in 2019, they’ve made a triumphant return to form with over 150 shows spanning 20 countries worldwide, celebrating the 30th anniversary of ‘Shake Your Money Maker,’ the album that put them on the map. Upon their return from the road, they knew they needed something new to show for their lost time.\n\n“The Robinson Brothers and longtime bassist Sven Pipien headed to the studio with producer Jay Joyce in early 2023 and the experiences of years past transcribed themself through the music as the band found their way back to their roots.”\n\nOther stops on the tour include:\n\nApril 2 - Nashville, Tennessee\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 3 - Atlanta, Georgia\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 5 - Houston, Texas\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 6 - Irving, Texas\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 8 - Denver, Colorado\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 10 - Phoenix, Arizona\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 12 - Los Angeles, California\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 13 - Oakland, California\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 15 - Seattle, Washington\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 16 - Vancouver, Canada\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 19 - Chicago, Illinois\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 20 - Detroit, Michigan\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 23 - Montreal, Canada\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 24 - Toronto, Canada\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 27 - New York City, New York\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 28 - Boston, Massachusetts\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nApril 30 - Washington, D.C.\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nMay 1 - Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nMay 4 - Atlantic City, New Jersey\n\nTickets: Stubhub, Vivid Seats\n\nOn May 14, the band heads overseas to the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, Denmark and Spain through June 9."
