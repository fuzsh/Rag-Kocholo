        "text": "AN ICONIC nineties band have delighted fans after releasing their first album in more than a decade.\n\nThe bands most notable hits include Hard to Handle, She Talks to Angels, Remedy, Jealous Again, and Twice As Hard.\n\nThe Black Crowes, formed in 1984, have made a comeback today after releasing their album, Happiness B**tards.\n\nThe current lineup of the band includes the Robinson brothers, bassist Sven Pipien, and new members Nico Bereciartua (lead guitar), Cully Symington (drums) and Erik Deutsch (keyboards).\n\nRich, 54, and Chris Robinson, 57, have had several feuds over the years.\n\nFive years ago, they announced their “final” break-up after a disagreement over the band’s ownership.\n\nWhile many bands with siblings have experienced conflicts, the well-known feuding brothers in Oasis were astonished by the level of anger between Chris and Rich.\n\nDespite facing numerous conflicts, the Robinsons insisted they were able to reach a compromise when composing new material.\n\nOn the Howard Stern show Rich said: \"That was always where all that went away.\"\n\nChris said: \"You know what it was, too?, We didn't have anyone else around to f*ck with us.\n\n\"We didn't have anybody from management or the other guys in the band, or anyone with any sort of [agenda] to divide and conquer.\"\n\nRecalling the moment when Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis were surprised by the intensity of their conflict, Rich said: \"Chris was late to soundcheck and everybody was freaking out.\n\n\"So, he and I got into it and our tour manager walked outside, and Liam and Noel were outside the door going, 'Listen to that. Holy s*it'.\""
