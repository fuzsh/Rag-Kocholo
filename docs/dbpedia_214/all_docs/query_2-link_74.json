        "text": "Borderland Festival has unveiled the daily artist lineups for its 2024 event, which will return to East Aurora, N.Y.’s scenic and historic Knox Farm State Park for its annual summer send-off. From September 13-15, the festival will welcome premiere acts from the worlds of jam, rock, folk, bluegrass and more, plus a stunning array of West New York’s finest musicians, craftspeople and caterers, for an immersive celebration of the region. Today’s dispatch distributes the previously announced stacked bill across three days of programming, enshrining The Black Crowes, CAAMP and Marcus King as this year’s headliners.\n\nOn Friday, Borderland’s kick-off will be commanded by Southern rock vanguard The Black Crowes, which reunited with renewed zeal after a five-year hiatus in 2021 and released Happiness Bastards this year to widespread acclaim. This headline set will be primed by performances from The Sheepdogs, Eggy and funk and fusion ace guitarist Cory Wong, as well as Big Martha: an Allman Brothers Experience, Evan Jennison and more artists still to be announced.\n\nThe festival will reach full steam on Saturday, when the meteorically rising quartet CAAMP will command the stage with its fuzzy, insightful and tender brand of jam-friendly indie folk. Further performances will come from Houndmouth, Sierra Hull, The Dip and the renowned folk-rock trio The Wood Brothers. To round out the bill, the festival will feature Uncle Ben’s Remedy, Borderland Dead All Stars and more.\n\nTo close out its 2024 program, Borderland Festival will give its final headline slot to the trailblazing blues-rock singer-songwriter and guitarist King, who recently released his fifth solo studio album Mood Swings to widespread acclaim. Jam fans will rejoice at the earlier inclusion of the esteemed Grateful Dead cover ensemble Dark Star Orchestra, who join a lineup alongside Sumbuck, The Rumble and Bob Marley’s legendary backing band The Wailers, among others.\n\nBorderland’s second stage emphasizes local talent, with West New York up-and-comers like Handsome Jack and Annie In The Water showing off the region’s chops. One lucky band from this ilk will be selected as the winner of the Battle of the Borderland Band Contest, which returns for the first time in five years to present a rising artist on the Main Stage. Beyond the music, attendees can expect to enjoy locally-curated gourmet food and drink, a dazzling array of regional artisans and the wonder of the setting, which offers the perfect early autumnal celebration for Northeast concertgoers."
