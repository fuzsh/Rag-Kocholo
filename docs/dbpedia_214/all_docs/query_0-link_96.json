Your contributions are an investment in our election coverage – they help sustain our newsroom, help us plan, and could lead to an increase in freelance writers or photographers. If you value our work, please make a contribution today to help us reach our goal.\n\nContribute Now\n\nProgress to goal\n\n$14,500\n\n$4,100\n\nWhen the Black Crowes first went national, around 1990, the band became a walking/talking critical argument. Were Chris and Rich Robinson inspired revivalists, introducing rock and blues verities rendered with credibility and conviction to a new generation? Or were they figurative grave defilers, cynically cornholing the corpse of rock glories past for the entertainment of aging fans who loved claiming they dug a new band and didn't care that it didn't actually sound new? Back then, I sided with the latter line of reasoning, and in general, I still do. With so many fresh and exciting sounds to hear, why bother listening to a group that replicates timeworn ones? But those who prefer musical comfort food rather than unique flavors could do worse. The Crowes aren't dilettantes — they've devoted decades to favorite styles — and their latest album, Warpaint, is solid and substantial. I won't be at the Fillmore to see them, but I can understand why you might."
