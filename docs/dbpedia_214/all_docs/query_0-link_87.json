        "text": "Eddie Harsch, the accomplished rock-soul keyboardist best known for his work with the Black Crowes, died Friday in his native Toronto. He was 59. A cause of death has not been announced.\n\nHarsch was a longtime Detroit fixture before moving back to his hometown about a decade ago. He'd arrived in Detroit in the 1980s — drawn to the city's \"bohemian subculture\" as he told the Free Press in 1999 — and was often spotted hopping onstage to jam with local bands while more formally lending his services to groups such as the Detroit Cobras and Bulldog, the band he launched in 2003 with guitarist Kenny Tudrick.\n\nHis recording work in Detroit included albums such as Kid Rock's \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp\" in 1996.\n\nHarsch served with the Black Crowes from 1991 through 2002, rejoining the Southern rockers during their 2005-2006 reunion.\n\nAfter some time away from any high-profile music work, Harsch was set to return to action with former Crowes band mates Rich Robinson, Sven Pipien and Marc Ford as part of the just-formed Magpie Salute. The group has been scheduled to make its public debut with an Atlanta show later this month and a run of January dates in New York.\n\n\"It is with the saddest of hearts that we bid farewell to our dear friend Eddie Harsch,\" Robinson wrote in a statement on the band's website. \"Eddie was a brilliant musician, with a beautiful heart. We should remember Eddie for his music, his great sense of humor, and his positive outlook on life. We ask that everyone please respect the privacy of Eddie's family at this time. Let's honor him by celebrating his musical contributions to the world, and by sending positive thoughts and prayers to him and his family. Our hearts will forever remain with our musical brother.\"\n\nThe Free Press profiled Harsch in 1999 as the Black Crowes were riding high. That story is reproduced here:\n\nLOCAL KEYBOARDIST ENJOYS BEING A CROWE\n\n(Originally published Feb. 19, 1999)\n\nBy Brian McCollum\n\nDetroit Free Press Music Writer\n\nEddie Harsch thought it would last four months.\n\nA seasoned pianist-organist who'd made his name on the blues circuit with such acts as Albert Collins and James Cotton, the Detroit musician figured his 1991 residency with the Black Crowes was just that.\n\nThings were breaking big for the Crowes that January: \"Shake Your Money Maker\" had just been certified for one million sales when Harsch flew to Atlanta to audition between dates on the Crowes' first national tour. He'd been recommended by a mutual friend: veteran keyboardist Chuck Levelle, who'd performed on the album but didn't want to tour.\n\nHarsch got the job after a 10-minute jam on \"Hard to Handle\" and \"Jealous Again,\" the group's two recent radio smashes. \"OK, he knows the hits,\" shouted drummer Steve Gorman, hopping off the drum riser. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\nIn time, though, it became clear that Harsch wasn't going to be just a utility player in the Crowes' backing crew.\n\n\"We had the same musical background, listened to a lot of the same stuff,\" Harsch recalls. \"When we sat down and actually started talking, it was kind of remarkable how parallel it was. It's still that way.\"\n\nSinger Chris Robinson says Harsch's offbeat humor and chops made the perfect match for the Crowes.\n\n\"He's our resident alien,\" Robinson says with a laugh. \"But he's a genius player, man.\"\n\nMuch as you'd expect with a band that values artistic freedom, Harsch says he gets plenty of room to operate within the creative world of the songwriting Robinson brothers.\n\n\"Since Rich writes the body of the instrumental parts of the songs, he'll have a suggestion, but he'll also know just to feed me a couple of adjectives, and I'll come up with something based on that,\" Harsch says. \"They have enough faith in me to come up with something.\"\n\nHarsch, 39, was born in Toronto and lured here in the early '80s by Detroit's \"bohemian subculture.\" These days, he says, he lives out of his suitcase, spending only brief blocks of time at his rented house in the Cass Corridor.\n\nWhen he is in town, he's a common sight for local night owls, who catch him jamming onstage with the Howling Diablos, Johnnie Bassett and the Reefermen.\n\nHarsch has also contributed to albums by George Clinton, Kid Rock and Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise.\n\n\"His strengths are in blues-gospel,\" says Diablos vocalist Martin (Tino) Gross. \"Eddie is a musician -- he's not a rock star. He keeps it real.\"\n\nHarsch says he never envisioned he'd be gigging with the Crowes in 1999. But when that first tour wrapped up in April '91, he was offered a deal to permanently join the band. And he hasn't looked back.\n\n\"By that time,\" he says, \"I was having way too much fun to turn around and leave.\""
