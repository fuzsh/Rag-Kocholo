        "text": "By Mark Jordan\n\nSay one thing for The Black Crowes: They don't wear out their welcome.\n\nJust five years after regrouping, the Southern rock band known for such hits as \"Hard To Handle\" and \"Remedy\" is going on hiatus again. The group is in the midst of its swan song, the \"Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys Tour,\" which stops Sept. 30 at the Mud Island Amphitheater.\n\nThe planned break is very different from the last time The Black Crowes called it quits in January 2002. Back then, the band was worn down after more than a decade of solid touring and recording. What little strength they had was sapped by the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on Washington and New York City, where all the members of the band then resided.\n\nThis time, The Black Crowes are stepping away almost as a preventive measure.\n\n\"We've been on tour for five solid years, and it just seemed like a good time to stop,\" founding member and guitarist Rich Robinson says from a recent tour stop in Asheville, N.C. \"Three of us had babies in the past year, so it's good to spend time with our kids. The last time we pushed it too long. It was 11 solid years of touring and making records without taking a break.\"\n\nRobinson and his older brother, vocalist Chris Robinson, and drummer Steve Gorman first started The Black Crowes in the mid-1980s in their hometown of Atlanta. Inspired by Southern rock, American R&B and British bands of the '60s like the Rolling Stones and the Faces, they stood out in an era dominated by slick techno sounds and dance beats.\n\nThe band released its first record, Shake Your Money Maker, in 1990. It was an immediate smash thanks to singles like \"Twice As Hard,\" \"She Talks To Angels,\" Jealous Again\" and \"Hard To Handle,\" the Crowes' rock update of the Otis Redding classic. Six more albums followed through the 2001 release Lions, along with more hits like \"Thorn In My Pride,\" \"Wiser Time\" and \"Soul Singing.\"\n\nAll those songs can be heard on the band's new release, Croweology, a double disc of acoustic renditions of favorites from their first six records. According to Rich Robinson, the project was devised as a special way to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's record debut.\n\n\"We wanted to do something different,\" says Robinson, who says the germ of the idea came from a stripped-down show the band did a few years ago at New York's Town Hall. \"We thought, 'What about doing something like this and touching on what we've done over the past 20 years instead of re-releasing Shake Your Money Maker or something like that.'\"\n\nRobinson says the impending indefinite hiatus doesn't mean fans won't be hearing from the members of The Black Crowes, which also includes bassist Sven Pipien, keyboardist Steve MacDougall and Hernando, Miss., guitarist Luther Dickinson. Most notable, brother Chris, perhaps the best-known member of the group thanks to his tabloid-fodder marriage to actress Kate Hudson, is reportedly working on a solo album. Gorman always has numerous side projects going. As for Rich, he'd like to record a follow-up to his 2004 solo record, Paper. And he's interested in film soundtrack work like he did in last year's documentary \"The People Speak.\"\n\nOne project Robinson might revisit in his downtime is Circle Sound, the side band on which he first teamed with Dickinson back in 2007. Robinson had met the Mississippi guitar player when Dickinson's North Mississippi All Stars opened some shows for the Black Crowes, and their bond deepened when Robinson asked him to be a part of Circle Sound. In 2007, Dickinson was invited to join the Black Crowes, and he has played on the band's recent albums, including 2008's Warpaint, 2009's Before the Frost ... Until the Freeze, and Croweology.\n\n\"Luther brings himself to whatever's he playing,\" says Robinson, who expects Dickinson will still be a Black Crowe when this break is over. \"He's really fit in very well. He seems to share a really similar musical palette that we all have, growing up in the South and listening to very similar things. And Luther's such a talented guitar player, it was just so seamless to have him join the band.\"\n\n--------------------\n\nThe Black Crowes\n\n7:30 p.m. Sept. 30, Mud Island Amphitheater, 125 N.
