        "text": "There’s a difference between a cash grab and shaking your money maker. Anyone who watched Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson leave everything he had out on that stage last night would be hard pressed to call this Crowes tour a soulless commercial enterprise.\n\nRobinson and guitarist Rich Robinson, Chris’ brother, led a new supporting cast of musicians through a charged set at Oak Mountain Amphitheater in Pelham, Ala. a Birmingham suburb. The tour’s hook is the 30th anniversary of Black Crowes’ 1990 multi-platinum debut album “Shake Your Money Maker.” Originally plotted for 2020, the trek was delayed until this year because of the pandemic.\n\nAt Oak Mountain, Chris sang his still-skinny ass off on “Money Maker” hits like gloriously Stones-y “Jealous Again,” Aerosmith-ed Otis Redding cover “Hard to Handle” and heroin-girl acoustic ballad “She Talks To Angels.” He dug deeper on vintage R&B influenced ballad “Seeing Things.” Chris really was a soul singer on that one. And on some of the album’s deepest cuts less familiar to casual fans, like the stomping but lyrically indecipherable “Struttin’ Blues,” Chris put even more energy into his vocals and sassy stage moves, and made those songs connect.\n\nAfter performing the 10-tune “Money Maker” front-to-back, the Robinson brothers – backed by longtime latter era bassist Sven Pipien and a new lead guitarist, drummer, keyboardist and background singers – ran through an hour or so of other Crowes hits and classics. Second half highlights included jammed out versions of groovier tracks “Thorn In My Pride” from 1992 masterwork LP “Southern Harmony” and “Wiser Time” off trippier ‘94 release “Amorica.” The two-hour-ish show ended with a crunchy, mandolin-flecked encore cover of Led Zeppelin B-side “Hey Hey What Can I Do,” which the Crowes performed with Zep guitar god Jimmy Page on a circa-2000 live album and tour.\n\nWhat about Rich?\n\nUnlike his hyperactive brother, Rich Robinson is one of rock’s most dependably stoic stars. Generally, Rich lets his clever and subtle guitar playing do his talking. And instead of dramatic gestures onstage, Rich focuses on moving the crowd. The music’s awesome, but sometimes he can look like he’s in a legal deposition instead of a rock show.\n\nAll that said, Rich looked happier onstage Sunday than any of the 50 or so Crowes concerts I’ve seen over the decades, beginning with a 1991 UAB Arena gig opening for Zep singer Robert Plant. At Oak Mountain there were many subtle, knowing grins mid-song between Rich and other band members when things were really slamming. During the rhythmic section-focused breakdown on “Thorn In My Pride,” Rich even boogied for a few seconds as he held his guitar silently. I rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing things correctly. Rich Robinson … dancing? Good for him.\n\nThe new guys\n\nAs many rock writers have written, podcasters have podcasted and hardcore Crowes fans have bemoaned, besides the Robinsons this lineup contains no other classic Crowes. Most notably, bigfooted drummer Steve Gorman, the only musician besides Chris and Rich to appear on all eight Black Crowes studio albums, and guitarist Marc Ford, whose electrifying leads were a huge part of what made “Southern Harmony” magic and mid ‘90s Crowes tours bootleg-worthy, aren’t aboard.\n\nThe Robinsons have stated that, after the Oasis-level interband conflicts that have plagued the Crowes’ history, they wanted to start fresh with no baggage. (The brothers themselves reunited after several years of not even speaking to each other and barely knowing each other’s kids.)\n\nUnderstandable. But it’s also understandable that some dedicated fans who stuck with the Crowes post-“Amorica,” when the band seemed to lose half its audience with each new album, have no interest in a tour that doesn’t involve Gorman, who wrote an eyebrow raising 2019 tell-all memoir that got him permanently unfriended by the Robinsons.\n\nFor superfans, a band’s lineup matters because they’ve gotten to know those musicians’ playing and personalities, and what those shades add to the music, over several albums and tours. After other listeners moved on from the Crowes to alternative, electronica, pop-punk or rap-rock, these true-blues stuck around. So yeah, to them it matters who’s playing the drum intro to “Hard To Handle.”\n\nHonestly, I had some doubts going into the show, even after watching some impressive clips. But the new Crowes won me over. Sunday at Oak Mountain, lead guitarist Isiah Mitchell, a visual doppelganger for Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, had me from the first big bendy notes of his leads on show/album opener “Twice As Hard.” Wearing a feather punctuated black hat, Mitchell played fluid, exciting leads all night. At times, he stuck very close to album versions of solos, as on the lovely double-stop culminating lead on “Could I Have Been So Blind.” Other times he went a little more off script, as on a wilder approach to the “Hard To Handle” break.\n\nWhile Mitchell, keyboardist Joel Robinow and drummer Brian Griffin played well on the “Money Maker” songs, balancing history and now, they really killed it on the second half of the show. Which makes sense. “Shake Your Money Maker” is all about the singing and songs. But musicians in general vastly prefer the next two Crowes albums, “Southern Harmony” and “Amorica,” which the second set drew heavily from.\n\nOf any previous lead Black Crowes lead guitarist, Mitchell’s style is probably closest to Ford’s, which is great news for superfans. Mitchell tore it up on “Southern Harmony” boogie “Sting Me.” On “SYMM” material his Allman-esque slide elevated “She Talks To Angels.” The elongated guitar tangle between Mitchell and Rich Robinson on “Wiser Time” was transcendent.\n\nRobinow stood out on the song with the most pressure on the keyboardist: “Descending,” the stirring comedown ballad that closes “Amorica.” That track was a centerpiece for late great Crowe keyboardist Eddie Harsch’s blues-circuit honed chops. On both the “Descending’ intro and outro, Robinow’s emotive playing took Oak Mountain to church and earned applause onstage from Chris. The keyboards struggled at times to find bandwidth onstage during the “Shake Your Money Maker” songs, a notable exception being gospel-organ swells on “Seeing Things.”\n\nMitchell and Robinow both come from psychedelic-tinged backgrounds with bands like Howlin’ Rain and Once & Future Band, which fits Chris’ counterculture leanings. Those two musicians felt like logical Crowes candidates. Griffin’s a little different. The drummer’s worked previously with artists like pop songsmith Richard Marx. As such, Griffin’s a technically terrific drummer, although there were times Sunday the “Money Maker” songs missed the raw athleticism and air Gorman gave those beats. Still, Griffin’s grooves had fans at Oak Mountain grooving all night, and he was standout on “SYMM” closer “Stare It Cold.”\n\nThere’s more for background singers to do on post “Money Maker” material. And that’s when sanctified textures by Mackenzie Adams and Leslie Grant were indispensable, particularly on thunderous, strutting 1992 MTV staple “Remedy.”\n\nThe rhythmic anchor\n\nBringing back Sven Pipien was a crucial move for this Crowes tour. Formerly of Mary My Hope, a talented band from the Black Crowes’ hometown of Atlanta, Pipien first joined the Black Crowes circa 1997. With him on board, the band’s music finally swung. And onstage at Oak Mountain, Pipien totally brought the roll to the Black Crowes’ rock. His gospel walk up lines on “Stare It Cold” and river-flow groove on “Wiser Time” were brilliant. With his wiry frame, bushy hair and shy grin, Pipien was happy to just be laying it down in front of a big audience again, and letting the pin spotlights shine on Chris, Rich and Mitchell. Take Sven Pipien out and I’m not sure this lineup works.\n\nThe show’s opening and look\n\nLike many bands, The Black Crowes are the most enjoyable when they’re not taking themselves too serious. Rock & roll is just better when it’s, you know, actually fun instead of some deep artistic expression of darkness.\n\nEven before the Crowes’ set started, the tone was cast for a fun night. On stage right, there was a full bar set up, complete with a powder blue tux clad bartender. (The bartender stayed behind the bar all night.) As the lights hit the stage, the non-Robinson musicians and singers were seated at the bar carousing. Then a long tall tattooed lady with them walks over to an old school jukebox and plays the Elmore James blues jig “Shake Your Money Maker” got its name from.\n\nThe musicians sauntered to their band positions towards the center of the stage, and then all of a sudden Rich Robinson appeared stage left playing the guitar intro for “Twice As Hard.” Chris Robinson, who’d snuck out to the drum riser during the staged opening, got up and pranced around the front of the sage, carrying a Black Crowes emblazoned umbrella in the style of a New Orleans second-line parade, before grabbing his mic and tearing into his vocals. Honestly, the whole umbrella trip should be deleted. Chris’ vocal performance really zoomed after jettisoning that prop by the time “Jealous Again” started. The stage set and background evoked a patinaed juke joint.\n\nThe brothers\n\nUnlike some past Crowes tours when they sometimes avoided eye contact onstage, at Oak Mountain the Robinson brothers really seemed to be in it together. Their best interplay was cutting up time on “SYMM” boogie “Thick N’ Thin.” They were in close proximity onstage most of the night, sharing the same spotlight occasionally and often basking in the warmth of their music. At one point Chris jokingly backed into his brother, the rock version of a football touchdown celebration where teammates jump up and collide with each other midair.\n\nThe support act\n\nLos Angeles quartet Dirty Honey got the night started, performing early Guns N’ Roses inspired songs from a self-titled 2019 EP and 2021 LP. Singer Marc LaBelle and guitarist John Notto have a friendlier version of the Axl/Slash dynamic duo thing going. At one point during a guitar solo, LaBelle reached down and straightened Notto’s guitar cable out so Notto wouldn’t get tangled in it.\n\nHighlights from Dirty Honey’s set included Hendrix-dusted ballad “Another Last Time” and current single “The Wire.” The latter tune evoked AC/DC doing “Kashmir,” which rocked as awesomely as that description hints. Anchored by the curly haired rhythm section of drummer Corey Coverstone and bassist Justin Smolian, Dirty Honey had the crowd shimmying by set closers “When I’m Gone” and “Rolling 7s.”\n\nIf you love classic gimmick-free hard-rock, Dirty Honey is definitely a band to follow. Prowling the edge of the stage with poise from underneath his hat and shades, LaBelle nailed several “Whole Lotta Love” vocal pirouettes to end songs. Notto’s guitar solos sound like lightning looks. The band performed in front of a huge black banner with their iconic-looking orange lips logo, for a more Instagrammable visual than many opening acts exude. My only suggestion: Get a gong for Coverstone to bang at the end of the set. This is a gong-worthy band.\n\nThe scene\n\nThe Oak Mountain Amphitheatre’s capacity is 10,500 and it looked like the venue was somewhere between three-fourths and two-thirds full by the time the Crowes took the stage. The mix for Dirty Honey was crystalline. The Black Crowes’ sound was loud with a capital L and for a song or two muddled, but locked in soon.\n\nThe audience was a mix of gray bearded lifers, rocker couples, Peloton-toned yuppies, sweaty hippies, hot moms with hot daughters, and drunk bros partying like it was 1990. Chris Robinson is famously weed-positive, and in the crowd there were plumes of pungent smoke as well as the overripe aroma of draft beer.\n\nWhat band T-shirts fans decide to wear to a concert is always fascinating, part individual psyche sample and larger scale tribe DNA. At Oak Mountain, there were plenty of fans clad in Crowes tees from past tours. More than a few Dirty Honey shirts in the mix too. Other band tees spotted ranged from predictable (Rolling Stones, Allman Brothers, Soundgarden) to huh (Marilyn Manson, Anthrax).\n\nThe music played over the P.A. during the break between Dirty Honey and The Black Crowes included 13th Floor Elevators psych-rock, Iggy Pop proto-punk and arena anthems by The Who and Grand Funk Railroad.\n\nDirty Honey’s set had fans in lower sections closest to the stage rocking. The entire crowd was way into Black Crowes’ headlining performance and was standing through most of the show. The first mid-song beer line exodus/group sit-down didn’t occur until “Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution,” one of the best songs from the best late period Crowes album “Warpaint” … but also a reminder this band’s cultural clout falls off the table after “Amorica.”\n\nThe audience got out their camera phones out in particular for “She Talks To Angels,” “Hard To Handle,” “Remedy” and “Thorn In My Pride.” During Dirty Honey’s opening set, a cover of swampy Aerosmith classic “Last Child” turned fans into YouTube auteurs.\n\nIf you want to take a video home with you along with a ticket stub as a keepsake, cool, just as long as your phone doesn’t become a prolonged visual obstacle for other fans. But couples who walk up to the stage mid song to take a selfie in front of the band look like wankers.\n\nThe merch\n\nIn addition to retro “Shake Your Money Maker” tour tees ($40), the merch booth hawked a satin Crowes jacket ($175), vinyl box set ($90) and weed grinder ($30). Dirty Honey’s lips logo could be found on autographed LPs ($50), CDs ($20) and T-shirts ($40). A music industry insider I chatted with preshow noted opening bands are often required to price their T-shirts the same as headliners.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThis was the biggest concert I’ve been to since the pandemic began. It was amazing to be immersed gain in music powerful enough to move that many people in one place. That big electric communion.\n\nDirty Honey proved their talent can hang on a big stage. These rising rockers have a shot at one day making an album that, like “Shake Your Money Maker,” thousands of fans will pay to hear played in entirety.\n\nThe Black Crowes showed, that once again, a rock band’s legacy really comes down to three things: singer, songs and riffs. You have the guys responsible for those three facets in the lineup, your band’s a viable business enterprise. Of course, other musicians from a band’s different eras color and carve the story too. But as marriages and families often splinter, so do bands. Time goes on. Life moves on. Any legit concert review of this Crowes tour comes down to one question: Are The Black Crowes still a real band or are they just the two Robinson brothers? After last night, my answer is yes.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\nThe Black Crowes’ Rich Robinson on the secrets of ‘Shake Your Money Maker’\n\nPrince’s proteges, collaborators and muses: 15 essential tracks"
