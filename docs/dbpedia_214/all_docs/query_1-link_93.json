        "text": "Fan Reviews\n\nTaiko\n\nAugust 2nd 2024\n\nDer Sound war OK. Die Show hat mir sehr gut gefallen insbesondere weil alle meine Lieblings-Songs gespielt wurden wie z.B. Wanting and Waiting, Remedy, Rats and Clowns, Hard To Handle & She Talks To Angels. Was mir nicht gefallen hat ist die Location. Das zweite Konzert auf dem ich gar nix getrunken habe weil das Anstehen für ein Getränk einfach zu lange gedauert hat, trotzdem das Konzert nicht ausverkauft war. Die Verti Music Hall wird mich also nicht mehr sehen.\n\nBerlin, Germany@\n\nVerti Music Hall\n\nKevin\n\nApril 17th 2024\n\nThe Black Crowes were great playing songs from throughout there career. And the acoustic's in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre are wonderful...too bad the bar was closed by 9:30\n\nVancouver, BC@\n\nQueen Elizabeth Theatre\n\nChad\n\nApril 15th 2024\n\nAmazing, and good to have them back in the saddle again with such a well put together album! Not much good rock and roll around these days as well as musicians- but this band proves rock in roll is still alive!\n\nPhoenix, AZ@\n\nArizona Financial Theatre\n\nLawrence\n\nApril 14th 2024\n\nThe Black Crowes were amazing. The energy was fantastic and the music was phenomenal. The crowd sucked. Smoking inside, being incredibly rude, pushing and people so drunk they could hardly stand up. Truly disappointed in Fox Theater for allowing this to happen.\n\nOakland, CA@\n\nFox Theater\n\nBuellie\n\nApril 13th 2024\n\nSoooooo good!!! Wish they would tour L.A. more! Chris is the entertainer !!Only downfall was all the people talking during the show! Like are you here for a concert or for therapy? Leave your yapping for after the show no one cares about your problems! Idiots!\n\nLos Angeles, CA@\n\nThe Greek Theatre\n\nJacob\n\nApril 11th 2024\n\nFirst, the opener was very good. He was a throw back to the glam rock of the 70’s. Good choice. Now on to the Black Crowes. Aside from the merch being ridiculously high priced, I have nothing to complain about with this show. It’s been about 20 years since I’ve seen the band live and they were better than ever. Chris and Rich seemed to be getting along. The energy on stage was great. Loved it!\n\nPhoenix, AZ@\n\nArizona Financial Theatre\n\nRobert\n\nMay 8th 2023\n\n4 stars for playing a cover song as their encore. All in all Chris & Rich Robinson sound fantastic! Chris Robinson’s voice sounds as good and strong as it did 35 years ago. They did an amazing version of ‘Thorn In My Pride’ (my favorite song of theirs) and many hits but left a lot of their best stuff off the set list (imho) If you’re a fan and contemplating on going, don’t hesitate, this is an older but wiser Black Crowes, drama free and respectful of their fans and their music.\n\nLincoln, CA@\n\nThunder Valley Casino & Resort\n\nAlex\n\nOctober 18th 2022\n\nFantástico concierto el ofrecido en el Sant Jordi Club, devolviéndonos a los 90 y pudiendo disfrutar de una de las bandas que en su momento nos marcó sobretodo con sus dos primeros discos.\n\nBarcelona, Spain@\n\nSant Jordi Club\n\nSergio\n\nOctober 6th 2022\n\nMuy buena puesta en escena, excelente guión, tal vez único y mínimo reproche en el orden y la selección de los temas, duración muy correcta, fantástica acústica (wowww...el lugar es de lo mejor)...público entregado !!!! Top 9 !!!\n\nParis, France@\n\nL’Olympia\n\nRich\n\nAugust 31st 2022\n\nCrowes delivered, as always. The Texas Gentlemen, however, sucked beyond belief. Their music was incoherent, scattered and painful to endure. I hope to never have to endure such a pointless aural assault ever again.\n\nMorrison, CO@\n\nRed Rocks Amphitheatre\n\nMindy\n\nJuly 26th 2022\n\nI'm a bit conflicted leaving this review. I am more of a CRB (Chris Robinson Brotherhood) fan, which is a different vibe than the Black Crowes. I wanted to like this show, but I felt a real sense that the band (Chris & Rich in particular) were not at all into it. Chris was actually quite active strutting around like Mick Jagger on stage, but it felt so disingenuous - like a show for the fans. I truly think this tour is a cash grab for both of them. I gave it 3 stars because there is no denying that these guys are talented, but it's painfully obvious they are not there for their enjoyment. Sorry guys, just wasn't my jam.\n\nReno, NV@\n\nGrand Sierra Resort and Casino\n\nMatt\n\nJuly 23rd 2022\n\nGreat show high energy. I saw them 21 years ago and they still bring it. They played some songs they havent played since their very first tour. I highly recommend seeing them on this tour because you may not get to ever hear some of these songs played live ever again.\n\nReno, NV@\n\nGrand Sierra Resort and Casino\n\nGinger\n\nJuly 14th 2022\n\nGreat concert. Chris Robinson sounded fantastic and was so energetic and entertaining! Stone temple pilots was the opener and they did a great job too. Had a terrific time!\n\nHighland Park, IL@\n\nRavinia\n\nDoug\n\nJune 27th 2022\n\nThe 2022 Crowes are musically tight and focused on delivering a great show. Loved hearing ‘Moneymaker’ front to back, and there was plenty of variety in the second set of songs. Chris’s vocals were as solid as I’ve heard him. Fantastic experience!\n\nAlpharetta, GA@\n\nAmeris Bank Amphitheatre\n\nSuzi\n\nJune 27th 2022\n\nAmazing as always!! They’re pouring out all the rocking & rolling energy for us to soak in!! And it was awesome to hear “Shake Your Money Maker” from start to finish!!\n\nCanandaigua, NY@\n\nCMAC Performing Arts Center\n\nTracy\n\nJune 17th 2022\n\nThis was the second time I seen them I seen them in 2000 at UAB basketball gym they opened up for Jimmy Page and Robert plant it was awesome. Robinson came out on stage wearing yellow leather bell bottoms with green marijuana leaves all over them it being in the gym the sound was so good Page and plant played at least 10 Zeppelin songs and they were tuned in it was great this show last night was excellent Chris is still the entertainer he was from day one it seemed like everyone enjoyed the show if you can see him go see them\n\nHuntsville, AL@\n\nOrion Amphitheater\n\nJeronimo\n\nMay 28th 2022\n\nThe band sounded as good as ever and you could tell they don't use any backing tracks. All 100% live. Theater was bigger than I expected but there is not a bad seat in the place. Sounds was a little jangley on some vocals making it hard to understand what he was singing. Played everything you'd want to hear but did leave some fans disappointed by not playing hard to handle.\n\nHighland, CA@\n\nYaamava' Resort & Casino\n\nTom\n\nOctober 29th 2021\n\nI remember the band sounding great and the audience sounding flat. On second thought I don't remember hearing the crowd at all. Maybe they were just tired from dealing with their kids all week and used the concert to get away for some quality nap time.\n\nLos Angeles, CA@\n\nThe Forum\n\nDave\n\nAugust 23rd 2021\n\nMan. Wow. I am still blown away by their performance. I was front row, right in front of Richie and his amps. Loud AF. The Black Crowes put it all out there. A very impressive night. One that will never forget. Thanks Chris and Rich. Wish we could have talked more.\n\nConcord, CA@\n\nConcord Pavilion\n\nMike\n\nOctober 30th 2013\n\nWow! Their studio music is wonderful but seeing them live in concert is an experience all fans would appreciate. The band goes to a different place and takes you with them. Thank you and see you next time at The Riverside.\n\nMilwaukee, WI@\n\nRiverside Theatre\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nThe Black Crowes are leaving the bullshit in the past. 15 years after their last album of original music, the Robinson Brothers present Happiness Bastards- their 10th studio album. Some may say the project has been several tumultuous years in the making, but we argue it's arriving at just the right time. Call it brotherly love or music destiny that brought them back together, the highly anticipated record consecrating the reunion of this legendary band just may be the thing that saves rock & roll. In a time where the art form is buried beneath the corporate sheen of its successors, The Black Crowes are biting back with the angst of words left unsaid penned on paper and electrified by guitar strings, revealing stripped, bare-boned rock & roll. No gloss, no glitter, just rhythm and blues at it's very best - gritty, loud, and in your face.\n\nIt's finally here - Happiness Bastards is out March 15, 2024.\n\nShow More"
