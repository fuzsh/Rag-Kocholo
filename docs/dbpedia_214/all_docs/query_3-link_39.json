        "text": "Right from their debut single “Jealous Again” in 1990, the Black Crowes delivered some Southern grit with their bluesier rock repertoire.\n\nOff their triumphant debut Shake Your Money Maker and the aforementioned hit, along with classics “Hard to Handle” and “She Talks to Angels,” the Georgia rockers’ catalog was always led by brothers in arms, and lead co-writers Chris and Rich Robinson. The band’s hits continued on through 1992 follow-up The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, which shot to the top of the chart.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe band’s subsequent releases — Amorica (1994), Three Snakes and One Charm (1996), By Your Side (1999), and Lions (2001) — were all hefty offerings from the rockers before a hiatus. The Black Crowes returned with their seventh album, Warpaint, in 2006, which went to No. 5 on the Billboard 200, followed by the band’s 2009 release Before the Frost…Until the Freeze.\n\nThrough the Crowes’ many lineups and hiatuses over the years, the one constant has been the brothers Robinson since their first incarnation of the band, Mr. Crowe’s Garden, in 1984.\n\nThough the Black Crowes haven’t released an album of original material in nearly 15 years, their extensive catalog leaves plenty to choose from when picking some greats.\n\nHere’s a look at 10 of the band’s standout songs from 1990 through 2009.\n\n1. “Twice as Hard” (1990)\n\nThe Black Crowes scored four hits on their debut Shake Your Money Maker, including “She Talks to Angels,” “Jealous Again,” and the band’s cover of Otis Redding’s 1968 song “Hard To Handle.” Opening the album, “Twice as Hard,” which hit No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock chart, set the Crowes’ harder blues-rock bar of sound. The song is about how hard it is to leave someone … for a second time.\n\nYour sister always singing\n\nShe play the stepchild\n\nA broken little memory\n\nHer heart was never kind\n\nTell me I’m blind\n\n2. “She Talks to Angels” (1990)\n\nThe fourth single off Shake Your Money Maker, “She Talks to Angels” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. The song was loosely based on some of the characters Chris Robinson encountered during his earlier Atlanta club days, including one a goth girl who was on heroin. The line She paints her eyes as black as night came to Robinson, so he continued writing a fictitious story about her that turned into “She Talks to Angels.”\n\n“‘She Talks to Angels” is a funny song in that so many people resonate with it,” said Robinson. “The dark details like drugs and things like that would be a part of growing up and being in this world, but when I wrote that song I had no idea. I hadn’t done any of those things. I hadn’t lived that. Everything was in my imagination.”\n\nShe paints her eyes as black as night now\n\nShe pulls her shades down tight\n\nGirl, give a smile when the pain come\n\nPain, the only thing don’t make it alright\n\nSays she talks to angels\n\nSaid they call her out by her name\n\nOh well, she talks to angels\n\nAnd they call her out by her name\n\n3. “Thorn in My Pride” (1992)\n\nBringing even more musical and lyrical depth on their second album The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, “Thorn in My Pride” examines the healing that comes along with facing one’s inner demons.\n\nAre you wanting inspiration?\n\nYou spill your secrets on me\n\nThen you tell me with a whisper\n\nOf things that will never be\n\nDo you hear me breathing?\n\nDoes it make you want to scream\n\nDid you ever like a bad dream?\n\nHey, sometimes life is obscene\n\n4. “Remedy” (1992)\n\nAlso off The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, the Black Crowes’ hit No. 1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart in May 1992 with their rapturous “Remedy.” The single remained on the chart for 11 weeks.\n\n“’Remedy” is a song that essentially is about freedom,” said Chris Robinson. “We were into the whole idea that the ‘war on drugs’ was just silly. It was this asinine concept to me and millions of other people. So that song to me is about freedom, plain and simple—just put in a rock and roll framework.”\n\nI remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be\n\nSo desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe\n\nRight before my eyes, I saw that my heart, it came to life\n\nThis ain’t easy, it’s not meant to be\n\nEvery story has its scars\n\n5. “My Morning Song” (1992)\n\nThe penultimate, and second-longest track off The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (clocking in at 6:15 minutes), “My Morning Song” is a bluesier sermon on being intoxicated for an unending amount of time.\n\nDizzy found me last night\n\nSaw some kind of new light\n\nI woke up in a whirlwind\n\nJust you watch my head spin\n\nThe spectacle that made you cry\n\nIt’s a thrill a minute plane ride\n\nIt’s over time at ring side, no lie\n\n6. “A Conspiracy” (1994)\n\nOpening with a one-two punch of “Gone” and “A Conspiracy,” the Blacks Crowes shared more debaucherous tales on their third album Amorica. Chris Robinson said the album was “somewhere north of hell and south of heaven.”\n\nDid you ever hear\n\nThe one about last year\n\nIt was all a lie\n\nAin’t it funny how the time flies\n\nWhat we gonna do baby\n\nWhat is left for us to prove\n\nI’ve never stolen nothing, not a thing\n\nTried to stay away from this year’s\n\nBig thing\n\nAin’t as easy as it seems\n\nTo find a mutual dream\n\n7. “Wiser Time” (1994)\n\n“Wiser Time” is an ode to the rough and tumble times that come with life on the road, and learning to live the new “normal” over time. “It’s a song about constantly being in motion which has been happening to my brother and I for the last 30 years,” said Chris Robinson. “It’s a nice experience once you get used to it.”\n\nThe song peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.\n\nNo time left now for shame, horizon behind me, no more pain\n\nWindswept stars blink and smile, another song, another mile\n\nYou read the line every time, ask me about crime in my mind\n\nAsk me why another read song, funny but I bet you never left home\n\nOn a good day, it’s not every day,\n\nWe can part the sea\n\nAnd on a bad day, it’s not every day,\n\nGlory beyond our reach\n\n8. “Kickin’ My Heart Around” (1999)\n\nFollowing the band’s fourth album, Three Snakes and One Charm, the Black Crowes started working on their next release By Your Side. Recorded in New York City at Avatar Studios, the album was initially pieced together from songs off the band’s shelved 1997 album Band. Throughout the sessions with producer Kevin Shirley (Iron Maiden, Rush, Journey), the Black Crowes added new tracks, including “Kickin’ My Heart Around.”\n\nJust come out and say it\n\nSpit the words out of your mouth\n\nIt needs no explaining\n\nCause we both felt it go south\n\n9. “Oh, Josephine” (2008)\n\nOff the band’s seventh album, Warpaint, the chilled-out ballad of “Oh Josephine” is a song Rich Robinson called “my favorite song we’ve ever written.”\n\nOf the song’s final verse—It’s too late to play it safe / So let’s let it all ride—Chris Robinson added, “I wrote that verse in the studio. I felt that everybody knew what I was talking about – that it was about all of us. There’s nothing to think about anymore. There’s no hesitation. This is what we’ve been waiting for. This is what we do now. This is where we go. The only thing we have to deal with now is, do we want it to go away? Do we want to regress?”\n\nDiamonds hold mirrors and spoon it holds the stars\n\nIt’s been a long time baby since I’ve seen the sunrise like this\n\nMake a wish and call it maybe and give me one more kiss\n\nOoh, I like it like this, oh, I like it like this\n\nOh Josephine you’re dressed in black\n\nOh Josephine your eyes are blue\n\nAnd I know now there’s no turning back\n\nOh Josephine what will we do?\n\n10. “I Ain’t Hiding” (2009)\n\nThe Black Crowes’ eighth album, Before the Frost…Until the Freeze, was produced by longtime collaborator Paul Stacey, who had also worked with Oasis and Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds. The project was recorded over five nights in front of a live audience at the Woodstock, New York, barn/studio owned by the late drummer and vocalist of The Band, Levon Helm.\n\nThough a majority of the Crowes’ catalog was always written by both brothers, the countrified rocker “I Ain’t Hiding” was one Chris penned on his own.\n\nRust on my pickups\n\nAnd blood on the stage\n\nSeeds in the ashtray\n\nAnd coke on the blade\n\nN-Y-C delivers that’s a guarantee\n\nThe only thing that keep the day from me\n\nPhoto: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Live Nation"
