        "text": "Over the summer, one month after organizers of the poorly orchestrated Woodstock 50 finally admitted defeat and declared the affair kaput, Vice magazine uncovered a slew of internal documents about the event planned to celebrate the five-decade anniversary of the milestone 1969 festival, including the proposed three-day lineup.\n\nOne of the things Rock Music Menu noticed among the artists on the docket was a “TBD” slot for Saturday night which had listed, right between Kacey Musgraves and Kings of Leon, “The Black Crows.” Incorrect spelling aside, how exactly did the planners hope to land a group that hadn’t shared a stage in five years and involving two warring brothers slagging each other in the press as recently as that week? Surely it was just a wish list, right?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nIt’s starting to look like Woodstock 50 was set to be the big stage on which The Black Crowes returned but had to be postponed. Chatter has ramped up in the past week that siblings Chris and Rich Robinson are ready to launch a reunion tour in 2020, just in time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their 1990 debut, ‘Shake Your Moneymaker.’ While it would be great to see the brothers banging out classics like “Jealous Again” and “Remedy” onstage together once more, they’ve already got a rough road ahead of them before the first show is announced, as the pair are being accused of doing it solely for the money.\n\nThat’s nothing new in rock and roll; look no further than The Police or the Eagles, but the Crowes are allegedly not planning on including key members of the group, most notably drummer Steve Gorman, who just a few weeks ago released ‘Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes- A Memoir.’ More on that tome next month when the holiday gift guide starts up, but for now, the ex-Crowe who was with them the longest has been pretty vocal about the reasons for the Robinsons burying the hatchet, and why he won’t be asked to take part.\n\n“This reunion, I’ve heard from many sources for several months that this is happening,” he told Ultimate Classic Rock earlier this week. “This ain’t got nothin’ to do with trying to re-find a musical connection. This is a very different motivation and impetus, so the last thing that the brothers Robinson are going to do is involve someone who is going to take a chunk of the pie away from them.”\n\nGorman was with the Black Crowes from the very beginning, when the Atlanta outfit was still known as Mr. Crowe’s Garden in the late-80s. He went right up through their first hiatus in 2002, was coerced back in 2005 when they tried unsuccessfully to replace him and stayed until a final show in 2014. To hear him call the group out as being about nothing more than a cash grab is particularly disheartening.\n\nRecent years have seen Rich Robinson touring with the Magpie Salute, a tribute of sorts to the Black Crowes widely derided by his brother, that is until Chris started doing his own nod to his musical history in As the Crow Flies. While the two have been sniping at each other in the press, expect the reunion announcement to be peppered with the brothers reasoning that they’re both out on the road playing Crowes songs, so why not do it together? The fans will dig it and, unfortunately most importantly, the money will be right.\n\nVINYL OF THE WEEK\n\nKeep an eye on this spot as each week we’ll be looking at new or soon-to-be-released vinyl from a variety of artists. It might be a re-pressing of a landmark recording, special edition or new collection from a legendary artist. This week, it’s a trio from a legendary SoCal punk rock outfit.\n\nSOCIAL DISTORTION:\n\n‘MOMMY’S LITTLE MONSTER’\n\n‘MAINLINER (WRECKAGE FROM THE PAST)’\n\n‘SEX, LOVE AND ROCK ‘N’ ROLL’\n\nHaving spent the summer on the road celebrating their 40th anniversary, this fall sees three titles from Social Distortion’s back catalog getting released on vinyl. The LPs include the band’s 1983 debut, ‘Mommy’s Little Monster,’ their 2004 comeback album, ‘Sex, Love and Rock ‘n’ Roll’ and 1995’s ‘Mainliner (Wreckage from the Past),’ which compiles early singles and rare B-sides.\n\nLed by frontman Mike Ness and late guitarist Dennis Danell, Social D. brought a distinctive blend of punk and primitive rock ‘n’ roll to the punk scene with a twist by finding influences in the Ramones and the Clash as well as the early country music of Hank Williams and the classic blues of artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf.\n\n‘Mommy’s Little Monster’ was released on the band’s own label, 13th Floor Records, after being recorded in a single session at the tail end of 1982. Full of raw vocals, powerful guitar-driven hooks and plenty of attitude, the LP gained Social Distortion a national following and went on to inspire the likes of the Offspring and Rancid with standout tracks like “The Creeps” and “Another State of Mind.”\n\nThe much-anticipated ‘Sex, Love and Rock ‘n’ Roll’ marked the group’s first studio effort in eight years, seeing them refocus after the sudden death of Danell, who passed at just 38 years of age four years earlier in 2000. The album found a grieving Ness looking inward, but it also produced some of the band’s most acclaimed material like the opening track, “Reach for the Sky,” which became one of their biggest hits, as well as “Live Before You Die” and “Don’t Take Me for Granted.”\n\nThe final reissue, ‘Mainliner: Wreckage from the Past,’ offers Social D’s earliest singles and B-sides from 1981, the majority of which never appeared on any of the band’s full-length albums. The compilation gives fans a peek into the group’s creative development, when they were still teenagers, with fan favorites like “1945,” “All the Answers” and “Moral Threat,” plus a sloppy, tough as nails cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Under My Thumb.”\n\nFind all three Social Distortion reissues online and in stores from all respectable retailers who carry vinyl. Extremely limited-edition color variants are also available via the band’s official web store at socialdistortion.com"
