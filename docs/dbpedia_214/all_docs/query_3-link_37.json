        "text": "The Black Crows is a criminal organization of powerful magical users with the ability to strike at will. Their leadership consisted of five individuals, with Luó Vramzeraru often regarded as their commander. They operated under the jurisdiction of The Oblivion.\n\nIn 1495 DR, they were suspected as the perpetrators behind the Massacre at the Vorsaska Stronghold.\n\nOrganization[]\n\nHierarchy[]\n\nPlaceholder\n\nActivities[]\n\nPlaceholder\n\nKnown Members[]\n\nThere were a total of fifteen members within the Black Crows, organized under a leadership hierarchy consisting of five leaders. Some people considered Luó Vramzeraru as the actual leader.\n\nName Class Status Location Mattias Drolgoman Paladin Alive Living in Minerinsk in Lucilduun Luó Vramzeraru Sorcerer/Monk Alive Unknown Nothreni Alondas Paladin/Rogue Alive Occupying Thevelean in Sylcyne Gwynn Aleanarn Warlock Alive Occupying Thevelean in Sylcyne Izekel Sandeau Monk Alive Living in Minerinsk in Lucilduun Maledos Varcona Fighter Alive Living in Minerinsk in Lucilduun Shatari Varcona Rogue Alive Living in Minerinsk in Lucilduun Aylin Xieren Cleric/Rogue Alive Occupying Thevelean in Sylcyne Lai Fang Barbarian Alive Unknown Daeren Testannont Cleric Alive Occupying Kingsport in Iythos Kasavir Black Fighter Alive Occupying Kingsport in Iythos Renaer Mantleshard Wizard/Ranger Alive Hiding in Iythos Lusine Galivesteaux Sorcerer Alive Hiding in Iythos Alia Cleric Alive Unknown Indrasa Loxia Ranger Alive Unknown Carmin Loccisano Rogue Alive Unknown\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllegancies[]\n\nThe Oblivion[]\n\nThe hierarchy of the five organizations was The Oblivion. Occupying the lowest tier were the Black Crows, operating indirectly under The Oblivion and effectively under all the others as well. They had connections within the Order of Oblivion, with individuals like Zoya Xhoqaq being notable liaisons.\n\nEnemies[]\n\nKingdom of Agriosa[]\n\nThe Black Crows have been combating the Kingdom of Agriosa since their criminal activities in Iythos and Dacemia at large. The Council of Advisory has theorized a connection between them and the Phyrexian Dawn, yet remains entirely unaware of their specific actions.\n\nThe Runebreakers[]\n\nSimilar to the Kingdom of Agriosa, the Runebreakers have been closely pursuing the Black Crows since the start of their activities in Iythos. Driven by their sense of duty, the Runebreakers have consistently worked to extract information from the criminal organization. It is believed that this group of heroes is the sole organization cognizant of the origins of the Black Crows, yet remains unknown of their intentions.\n\nMariam Lazeena and Dorian Weaver have been the primary individuals within the Runebreakers intensely tracking down the Black Crows.\n\nHall of Sorcerers[]\n\nExclusive information confined within the Hall of Sorcerers and disclosed solely by Mariam Lazeena reveals the existence of individuals such as Loó Vramzeraru, the leader, who originally hailed from a female-only magical academy. Other members, including Alia, Aylin Xieren, Indrasa Loxia, and Carmin Loccisano, were once part of the same academy. The circumstances leading to their defection remain undisclosed, but it is confirmed that these women left the academy and formed the Black Crows. The Hall of Sorcerers deliberately withholds information on female identities to prevent discovery unless divulged by the individuals themselves, adding a layer of complexity for those seeking to uncover the truth."
