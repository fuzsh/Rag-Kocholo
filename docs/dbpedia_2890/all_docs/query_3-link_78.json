        "text": "Privilege Ibiza announces its Opening party Line-up. Launching at 11 pm on Friday May 25th\n\nPrivilege Ibiza 2018 Opening Party ushers in the club´s 25th season with an impressive host of DJ talent, delving deep into a plethora of genres and the countless shades of house and techno. After a successful 2017 season, Privilege Ibiza is gearing up for another year of musical bliss. The summer reawakening of the San Rafael giant begins with the Opening Party on Friday 25th May, showcasing some of the best names in the scene.\n\nMain Room Line up\n\nOne of the few places in the world which gives off a real festival vibe, albeit indoors, Privilege´s main dance floor is a sight to behold: a cavernous room of stadium-esque proportions, showcasing unparalleled production, a state of the art sound system and one enormous stage.\n\nThe Main Room line-up this year includes a headlining DJ set from dance royalty Faithless, joined by Grammy Award-winning American DJ and record producer David Morales, Spanish house and electro house sensation Danny Avila, White Island icon Dj Oliver, one of Ibiza’s most in demand duos, Lovely Laura and Ben Santiago, as well as AOY & Galfy\n\nFaithless (DJ Set)\n\nDavid Morales\n\nDanny Avila\n\nLovely Laura & Ben Santiago\n\nDj Oliver\n\nAOY & Galfy\n\nVista Club Line up\n\nWith floor to ceiling windows, Vista Club mixes a unique open terrace feeling and the intimacy of an indoors dance floor. But the real magic of Vista begins when nights turn into mornings, when the sunrise washes through its glass walls, illuminating a dance floor packed with hundreds of people and the beautiful scenery of an island that doesn´t go to sleep.\n\nVista will also welcome whopping headliners for the occasion, which includes a sunrise set from dance legend Sasha going back-to-back with Kölsch, joined by Do Not Sleep head-honcho Darius Syrossian, Guti´s live performance, and Nick Curly + Joshua. Expect an event of the highest calibre, thousands of hands in the air, music first and foremost, and an abundance of energy for Privilege Ibiza´s first night of the season."
