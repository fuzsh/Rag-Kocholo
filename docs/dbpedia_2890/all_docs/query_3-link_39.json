In this article, we delve into the current status of Privilege Ibiza, the recent developments surrounding its ownership, and the possibilities that lie ahead. As a trusted source for all things Ibiza, we aim to provide you with the most up-to-date information on whether Privilege Ibiza will reopen as a club in 2023.\n\nPhoto: Sean Alexander / Internet\n\nPhoto: Sean Alexander / Internet\n\nIbiza 2022: A Remarkable Success Season\n\nThe Ibiza 2022 season proved to be an overwhelming success, exceeding all expectations in terms of leisure, restaurants, and accommodation. Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, the island persevered, showcasing its resilience and ability to adapt. Ibiza had to reinvent itself, emphasizing its natural beauty, such as its breathtaking beaches and captivating outdoor spaces. While all the clubs on the island reopened their doors for summer fun, Privilege Ibiza remained the sole exception.\n\nYou may also be interested:\n\nThe Acquisition by Grupo Empresas Matutes\n\nSignificant changes unfolded when Grupo Empresas Matutes, a prominent company with diverse entertainment interests in Ibiza, acquired Privilege Ibiza. This transaction came about after the Supreme Court rectified a ruling by the Provincial Court, allowing Matutes to obtain 55% of Privilege’s shares previously held by Etxániz. Grupo Empresas Matutes made a public announcement, stating that Privilege Ibiza would not open its doors during the summer due to the need for necessary reforms and improvements.\n\nPhoto: Sean Alexander / Internet\n\nPrivilege Ibiza 2023: Speculations on the Future\n\nSince the announcement of Privilege Ibiza’s acquisition by Grupo Matutes in June, speculations have been rampant regarding the club’s future. Without an official statement from the company, we’ve considered numerous possibilities. One question looms large: Will Privilege Ibiza continue to hold its title as the biggest club in the world, or will it be transformed into a different establishment, such as a hotel or commercial space? Alternatively, could it face demolition, making way for potential real estate ventures?\n\nWatch Dwayne Muffin’s visit to the venue nowadays\n\nThe Case for Reform: Balancing Legacy and Vision\n\nPrivilege Ibiza’s history is not without its share of challenges. In 2013, a young Dutchman working at Armin Van Burren’s State Of Trance party narrowly escaped a life-threatening incident when a portion of the roof collapsed. This incident eerily mirrored the roof collapse that bankrupted Privilege’s original owners when it was known as KU in the early 1990s. The question arises: Will Grupo Matutes be willing to invest the necessary funds to address the structural concerns and restore the club to its former glory?\n\nPhoto: Sean Alexander / Internet\n\nDeals Deals Deals Deals Deals Deals…\n\nBooking.com\n\nGrupo Matutes: A Steward of Ibiza’s Success\n\nUnderstanding Grupo Matutes’ rich history sheds light on their track record as a reputable and responsible company with a significant presence on the island of Ibiza. Their deep understanding of the local landscape and commitment to the island’s well-being instill confidence that Privilege Ibiza will not be a disappointment in 2023. With their ownership of Ushuaïa, another tourist hotspot boasting unique entertainment concepts, Grupo Matutes has proven their ability to curate exceptional experiences for visitors.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza 2023: Exploring Potential Directions\n\nRumors have circulated regarding the potential resurrection of Privilege Ibiza in its original KU state, envisioning the removal of the roof to create a versatile space for a wide range of events, restaurants, and hotel rooms. However, it is important to note that Ushuaïa’s ownership by Grupo Matutes might prompt them to reconsider this option, as Ushuaïa’s prime location guarantees stunning views and a beachfront setting, unlike the site of Privilege Ibiza in Playa d’en Bossa.\n\nPhoto: Sean Alexander / Internet\n\nReclaiming the Beat: A New Era for Privilege Ibiza?º\n\nAfter three years of inactivity, the anticipation for Privilege Ibiza’s return is palpable. Facing a housing crisis, Privilege resides next to an industrial estate. Its location opens rezoning opportunities, supported by locals. This could revitalize Privilege Ibiza. A detailed cost-analysis will decide the club’s future, exploring remodeling for private or commercial use.\n\nAwaiting the Announcement: What Lies Ahead\n\nEagerly awaiting news from Grupo Matutes, the fate of Privilege Ibiza’s future remains uncertain and hangs in the balance. Grupo Matutes’ strategic decisions, reflecting their dedication to the island, will determine the iconic club’s future. Stay tuned for updates, as we anticipate that news regarding Privilege Ibiza’s future will be unveiled before March 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of Privilege Ibiza as a club in 2023 remains uncertain. While Grupo Empresas Matutes now owns the establishment, their plans for the club have yet to be officially announced. Relying on Grupo Matutes’ experience, commitment to Ibiza, and proven track record, we foresee Privilege Ibiza as an exciting hotspot for party enthusiasts. Keep an eye out for the latest updates, as the legacy of Privilege Ibiza continues to unfold.\n\nNote: The content provided is purely speculative and based on the information available at the time of writing.
