        "text": "Ibiza super club Privilege is one of five local tourist establishments to receive funding for renovations, Periódico de Ibiza y Formentera reports. The 10,000-capacity venue, which has been closed since 2019, has received €8.2 million from the local government towards improving its water system and solar energy. As part of special Covid-19 regulations in 2020, it was granted permission to increase its surface area by 15 percent, so as long as its height and capacity remained the same. The law also allowed for renovation and remodelling works without the need for a municipal building permit. The other establishments receiving funding include Palladium del Hotel Palmyra in San Antonio and Apartamentos Es Cantó in Playa d'en Bossa, which will both increase in star ratings as a result of the renovations. Originally opened in 1978 as Ku Club, Privilege is now under the ownership of Grupo Empresa Matutes via Bahía de San Antonio SA. In 2018, the hospitality juggernaut took full control of the super club after buying the remaining 55 percent of shares from former owner José María Extániz. It's unclear when the club will reopen. We'll report more on this story as it unfolds."
