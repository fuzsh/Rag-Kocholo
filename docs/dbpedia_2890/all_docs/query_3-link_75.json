        "text": "The biggest club in the world, Privilege Ibiza, and Black Hole Recordings present a fabulous double mixcompilation delivered by Cosmic Gate and Hardwell. Situated on Ibiza between Ibiza Town and San Antonio, you will find Privilege. Aptly named the world's biggest club, Privilege has become the most outstanding and influential club on the island that delivers a unique and breath taking experience; a must visit for all Ibiza visitors and party people. With world famous resident DJs such as TiÃ«sto, Robby Rivera and Mauro Picotto, Privilege will host thousands of guests during the summer of 2009; visitors who will all be a part of that once in a lifetime moment only to be found on Ibiza. To fully capture the extraordinary concept of the famous Ibiza venue, Black Hole Recordings and Privilege decided to join forces for the release of a double mix compilation that would perfectly represent the music and atmosphere of the club."
