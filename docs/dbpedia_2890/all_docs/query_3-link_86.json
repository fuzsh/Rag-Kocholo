        "text": "Ibiza partying\n\nManumission was a series of parties held in Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands of Spain. The events were created by Mike and Andy Manumission (or Mckay).[1]\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nThe event founders describe Manumission as a lifestyle. The word \"manumission\" means \"release from slavery\" and in the party, people were \"free to do whatever [they wanted] to do\".[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nManumission started in as a mixed gay event held at Club Equinox [2] in January 1994 in the Gay Village, Manchester, UK. It was forced to close due to gang warfare involving drug dealers[3] before moving to the Ku Nightclub, Ibiza later that year.[1] Ku changed its name to Privilege Nightclub in 1995. The events continued until in 2007, and were resumed at Amnesia the same year, before finally ending in 2008."
