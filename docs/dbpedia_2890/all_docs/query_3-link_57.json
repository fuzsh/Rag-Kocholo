        "text": "A true sanctuary of electronic music, Privilege´s history is closely linked to the development of nightlife in Ibiza and the culture of the DJ sound. A community swimming pool which decades later became the biggest club in the world, Privilege´s trajectory is the stuff of legends\n\nThe history of Privilege starts in the early 70s under the name Club San Rafael, a community swimming pool with a small bar where locals rubbed shoulders with cosmopolitan people of all sorts, a tranquil spot which gave no hint of the madness that was to follow. One of the greatest turning points in the history of the club as we know it , came in 1979 after the change of ownership to former “Real Sociedad” footballer and Basque entrepreneur Jose Antonio Santamaria who changed its name to KU, Europe´s greatest club during the 80´s. Extravagant and hedonistic, KU soon became Ibiza´s open-air version of New York´s Studio 54, with high fashion, debauchery and impromptu parties as the main entertainment ingredients. British TV Documentary “A Short Film about chilling” labelled KU as “the mirror of Ibiza” famous for bringing together international multimillionaires, pop-stars, artists and eccentric clubbers from all corners of the world. Roman Polanski, Grace Jones, Freddie Mercury, Valentino, Moschino and Gaultier are just a few of the public figures that experienced Ku´s nocturnal euphoria. Few places in Ibiza could compete with the fame that KU had garnered as one of the most reputed clubs in the world so much so that in 1987 Freddie Mercury and Montserrt Caballe filmed the video for 'Barcelona' there.\n\nThe booming of the dance music scene in Europe at the beginning of the 90s as well as changes in Spanish legislation brought about change. In order to comply with sound restrictions the owner was compelled by local authorities to put a roof on the building at around the same time that foreign promoters started invading the island. In the mid 90´s the club took its next big historical leap, under the new ownership of Basque entrepreneur Jose Maria Echaniz, which marked the beginning of Privilege as an indoors club and the end of the open-air clubbing experience that was KU\n\nFrom this point on the clubbing industry grew exponentially, the culture of the DJ sound appeared inevitably, and the profile of the savvy clubber emerged, however the hedonism and wild partying reminiscent of the KU era continued well into the late 90´s especially on the nights of the outrageously extravagant Manumission. The Manumission events in Privilege were a sight to behold: out of this world production and costumes, live sex shows, ingenious themes and the sun streaming through the huge windows of the Coco Loco and the Main Room as the party raged on till 9 or 10 am.\n\nThe spirit of KU is still alive and its fingerprints are everywhere in Privilege to this very day: the maze like layout, the Coco Loco and La Vaca now known as Vista Club, the lavish gardens and of course the statue of the ancient Hawaiian God - KU.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza is not just the biggest club in the world, but also one of the most iconic clubs on the island whose active participation in the shaping of the clubbing industry is undeniable. Privilege is famous for hosting some of the best attended and representative shows in Ibiza over the past 20 years. The previously mentioned Manumission, the glamorous & unprecedented SuperMartxé, the highly acclaimed BBC Radio 1, as well as the residencies of Tiesto and Armin van Buuren, helped shaping the identity of the club over the years and have become an integral part of its heritage. Its long and tumultuous history over the course of 23 years as Privilege and almost two decades as KU, makes it a unique place in the world and a must see if you´re in Ibiza.\n\nContinuous improvements and the constant dedication over these 23 years have made Privilege Ibiza one of the most popular clubs on the planet. The enthusiasm and passion invested in this project year after year, as well as the love and support of an extraordinary public gives the club the necessary push to exceed itself with the arrival of each new season."
