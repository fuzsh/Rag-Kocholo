For years, Privilege hosted thousands of fans and dozens of superstars through some memorable nights. Nowadays, the space has been forgotten and turned into a ghost venue. However, after being granted a permit to be refurbished, a new project is underway to make this the biggest venue in the entire world. With a capacity of 15,000 thousand people, Ibiza might welcome a new club into its scene very soon.

Privilege Ibiza: Part of the Islands History

The club known as Privilege opened in Ibiza in 1975 in a location close to the village of Sant Rafael de Sa Creu under the name Ku Club. 20 years later it went through some reformations and came back to life until its closing in 2020. For many years, it hosted stars the size of Madonna and Freddy Mercury. The latter would record the video for his track ‘Barcelona’ inside Privilege. Defined as a super club, it could fit 10,000 people inside its 6500 square meter venue.

Privilege Ibiza is set to become one of the biggest and most iconic clubs on the island where partying is almost a religion. With a main room the size of an aircraft hangar, there’s no doubt that Privilege will become one of the biggest spots in the scene sooner rather than later. The club has gone through its fair share of stages. It started as a restaurant with a swimming pool. Later, it became a popular gay club after being sold to a football player. One thing’s for sure. You will always find a good party when at Privilege.

As the Spanish entertainment scene recovers from the consequences of the pandemic, more and more places, projects and parties appear. It is not easy to compete in such a thriving scene. However, the return of one of the greats is always a welcome sight. Privilege is back!
