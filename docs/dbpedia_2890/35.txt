Privilege

Privilege, known as Ibiza’s biggest club, just outside Ibiza town toward San Rafael. Formerly known for its open air parties (70s and 80s) and Manumisson parties. All other clubs would roughly fit into this one, which is the size of a hangar. Privilege obviously attracts the biggest DJs and has unmatchable shows. Artists such as Snoop Dogg and Jamiroquai also come to perform here.
