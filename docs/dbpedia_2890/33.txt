Privilege Ibiza is the "world's largest nightclub" according to the Guinness Book of Records, with a capacity of 10,000 people. For fourteen years, Privilege hosted Manumission, one of the island's most famous events. After a dispute between the club owner and Manumission's organizers, the event moved to Amnesia.

Originally called Ku, Privilege was a restaurant in the 1970s. The main room is the size of an aircraft hangar with a 25-meter-high roof and a swimming pool[citation needed]. The building was also where the video to "Barcelona" by Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball√© was filmed in 1987.
