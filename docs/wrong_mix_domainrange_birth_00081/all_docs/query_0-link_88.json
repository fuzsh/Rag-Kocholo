Not only did he direct our music to exactly what we and our guests both wanted, he was a key player in the organization of the event as a whole. From the planning stages to the actual event, he was professional, quick, courteous, and above all, fun.\n\nI’d recommend your services to anyone who asks us!”\n\nJordan & Jenn D.\n\nAmazing Experience!\n\n“Hi Howie and Leko, I just wanted to reach out and personally thank the two of you, and your entire team for the hard work on Saturday. The room looked amazing (your set-up was a huge part of that), and the guests (and the family) had an amazing time! You truly kept the party going all night long, and I know the family was beyond happy with the entire event. I enjoyed working with you both to ensure a fantastic celebration. Thanks and again I really appreciate all your effort to make the night an amazing experience for the entire family! Looking forward to our next event together!” – Christine A.\n\nTruly The Best!\n\n“Words truly cannot express how happy we were with the lighting and music to the wedding planning! All of our family and friends are still talking about how much fun they had. It could not have been possible without your help. Thank you Howie, you are truly the best at what you do!!”\n\nReika & Ju C.\n\nOur Guests Raved!\n\n“We can’t say enough about how awesome NYX is! They provided DJ, MC, and day-of coordination services for our wedding in June. The DJ and our MC, kept the party going and kept the dance floor packed all night. Our guests raved about their professionalism and perfect song choices, catering to both the grandparents and our college friends.\n\nOur day was perfect and we owe it all to the NYX team.”\n\nAbsolutely Amazing!\n\n“NYX was absolutely amazing at our wedding! So amazing we had to write our review before we leave for our honeymoon! NYX got the party started off right and kept the party going. Our guests had a blast dancing the night away. All of our song requests were played and the band is extremely talented. NYX definitely played a huge part in making our wedding reception incredibly memorable. We couldn’t ask for a better band!”\n\nCouldn’t Be Happier!\n\n“I hired NYX Entertainment & Events to handle my music during the reception. They were so helpful and great to work with. They paired me up with Mario and let me tell you he was the best DJ I could have asked for! He met and exceeded my expectations and we had a blast at our wedding. My guests were pleased and hit the dance floor as soon as we started. Couldn’t be any more happier, my reception was exactly how I envisioned it. Mario did an excellent job bringing in the requested songs and more keeping up with the crowd vibe. I highly recommend them for your events, well worth the money, time and experience. Thank you so much!”\n\nThe Perfect Blend…\n\n“We received glowing compliments on the music and entertainment by the creative people of NYX. They made our wedding more fun than I could have imagined. I can’t recommend them highly enough. Their unique suggestions centered around making sure the guests were having the time of their lives. It was the perfect blend of dancing and entertainment for people of all ages. My mom had never danced before, but she was having such a good time that she eventually overcame her nervousness and danced with my dad!” -Arthur S.\n\nCelebrity Wedding!\n\n“I highly recommend NYX Entertainment. I had so many compliments from the guests regarding the music and the lighting. My favorite compliment was…’this was truly a celebrity wedding.’ Everything was so perfect and all thanks goes to NYX. The DJ was professional and had great music selection, the MC really hyped the crowd and got everyone dancing, the lighting added so much to the mood. I really could not have asked for more. I would recommend this company to any bride who wants the perfect wedding.”\n\nHighly Recommended!\n\n“My husband and I were MORE than happy with NYX. Everything was very easy before the wedding, as far as payment schedule and communication with the business side — and the DJs were fantastic. The owner, Howie, went out of his way to make our event exactly the way we wanted, and even when a scheduling issue arose the week of our wedding with our original DJ, he made it right and took care of everything personally. Highly recommend.”\n\nPersonality and Professionalism!\n\n“We had DJ Mario for our wedding. My husband and I loved his personality and professionalism. He was energetic, personable, and really knew how to work the room. He’s also perfect for anyone who needs a Spanish-English speaking DJ. If I ever have a need for a DJ again, I would definitely go with DJ Mario and NYX Events.”\n\nMy First Vendor!\n\n“NYX Entertainment is amazing!! Howie helped out with not just the music but everything! They were my first vendor, and gave several recommendations! I got my dress from a store they recommended and my florist as well! They rocked our party all night and people have not stopped asking who our band was! They are AWESOME! Make sure you give them the names of songs that you want prior to your event to make sure they have it! Could not possibly have chosen a better band!!”\n\nDream Come True!\n\n“Everyone is still talking about our wedding! The entire day was a DREAM come true for both of us. You made the entire room ROCK!! Family, friends, and co-workers were ALL dancing, even those that never dance. Our bosses were dancing with sombreros and dark sunglasses on! We want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts!! You made our day one that nobody will EVER forget!!”\n\nLisa M.\n\nFabulous!\n\n“We would like to thank you for the fantastic job your DJs did at our wedding. They were wonderful. They did a fabulous job getting everyone to dance. They followed all our requests on music to play and music not to play. All our guests thoroughly enjoyed them. They really made the party. Without them it would have been just another wedding reception.”\n\nMaya & Jon F.\n\nCraziest Dancefloor\n\n“This weekend was great! You all did a great job and I was very impressed. That was the craziest dancefloor I’ve seen in a long time, so a big thanks to you and your team! I hope to work together in the future soon!\n\nThanks again,”\n\nClaudia A.\n\nA MUST FOR YOUR WEDDING!\n\n“NYX Entertainment & Events is a must for your wedding! I’ve personally worked with Howie on events in DC for over ten years. He is the consummate professional. As a wedding planner, I had a specific vision for our wedding day. NYX handled the music for cocktails and dinner. From walking us through the timeline to integrating unplanned toasts, Howie handled it seamlessly. The dancefloor was packed and everyone said it was the best wedding that they had ever been to. Thank you NYX Entertainment & Events for making my wedding night so amazing!” -Meredith F.\n\nGuests raved about our DJ!\n\n“Hi Howie and Leko, I just wanted to take a moment and send you an email about how flawlessly my wedding went last Saturday. The number 1 thing my guests raved about was how amazing our DJ was. He really was the life of the party and got the crowd going. Even my photographer commented on how amazing he was! I just want to thank all of you for everything. You really made our wedding more than we ever thought it could be!” -Amanda D.\n\nTotal Dance Party\n\n“MC Chris G. and his team were amazing… attended to our every to our need. They read the crowd brilliantly! Band was awesome. It was a total dance party! All the guests complimented us on how this was the best wedding they’ve ever been to. NYX and it’s fusion act (NYX Live) are awesome. It was so fun!”\n\nDaniel Y.\n\nFlexible…\n\n“Thank you Leko for entertaining our guests last night at La Banque at the Seaplane Base in Havre de Grace,MD. It was a pleasure having you. Your flexibility with the crowd and uncertain weather was much appreciated. To those looking for DJ and entertainment services, I highly recommend Leko. He is a great guy with modern equipment and the know how to make the crowd move! Everyone had a great time thanks to his talents!”\n\nKim B.\n\nNobody was Ready to Leave!\n\n“NYX made our wedding! From the music to the Emcee to the live instruments; our guests didn’t leave the dance floor all night. When our wedding ended, nobody was ready to leave. They played every song we asked them to, kept in perfect sync with our timeline and their wonderful communication and willingness to do whatever they could to make our night perfect made them a pleasure to work with. They totally rocked our wedding. A week later we are still getting calls from friends and family saying it was THE best wedding they have ever been to.” -Jennifer R.\n\nHelpful!\n\n“NYX Entertainment is incredible! They did our wedding last Saturday and had the dancefloor packed before the first course was served! Howie was so helpful throughout the whole wedding planning process! NYX is definitely the way to go!! Thanks for everything!”\n\nDarya N.\n\nVery Responsive!\n\n“Howie and the team did an amazing job at our wedding. They were very responsive with suggestions, questions, follow up , etc. They had excellent suggestions for our playlist and were really committed to keeping everyone dancing. When things got off schedule due to key family members’ late arrival, Howie was able to improvise in order to keep the flow and still fit in the aspects that were important to us. Howie really got the audience involved and during the garter toss had us all at the edges of our seats. I would highly recommend Howie and the team at NYX Entertainment.” -Christina F.\n\nNYX Puerto Rico!\n\n“Michael and I had our destination wedding in Puerto Rico. Howie went above and beyond helping us plan every detail of our wedding day. He delivered every promise to make our wedding perfect. When our day-of coordinator in Puerto Rico failed to prepare, Howie did not miss a beat in picking up the pieces. We had an outdoor wedding and Howie was the only person to prepare for rain… he saved the day with an umbrella that he let us keep as a sweet memento. We have nothing but compliments about Howie’s professionalism and high energy. Howie made a world of a difference in ensuring that our wedding was the wedding of a lifetime!” -Carmen & Michael F.\n\nDancefloor was Packed!\n\n“NYX was the best! Affordable, full service, and all the latest technology. We had a DJ, an MC and two live musicians giving the event an incredible energy – and MC Chris was off the charts. From the first song to the last, the dance floor was packed. And I just don’t mean my friends – EVERYONE was dancing. My family sang during the ceremony and NYX provided the equipment for them. We added an NYX photo booth for fun at the last minute. The whole thing was about 1/2 the price of a band from another agency.” -Jonathan C."
