        "text": "A Hundred Thanks!\n\n“Dear Howie, A hundred thanks for an awesome event! I am so very grateful to have had your help and expertise in executing our KEENFest program. It was a pleasure to work with you and we are so very luck you chose to say ‘yes’ to our request to help us! Our athletes will certainly benefit from the money you helped us raise. My sincerest thanks.” -Elizabeth\n\nCharismatic!\n\n“What an amazing party — you and your staff were totally awesome. Thanks for making our day so special. We had lots of comments from our guests on how great you were as well as the dancers… very energetic and charismatic!! The music was perfect and the break dancing performance was great too!”\n\nKaren R.\n\nBest Party I Ever Attended!\n\n“SPECTACULAR! UNBELIEVABLE! THE BEST PARTY I EVER ATTENDED! I have received so many raves and compliments from my friends. Even those who typically never dance and are always reserved at these social functions were on the dancefloor! No matter who we run into, they have heard from someone who was there how wonderful it was. It’s one thing when your guests rave about the party, but when you hear it from people who weren’t even there, you know it had to be good.” -Paul C.\n\nLively!\n\n“The people from my office said they had never been to a livelier party! Although there are no more parties like this in my near future, I would recommend NYX to anyone who is having a party!”\n\nArden H.\n\nAwesome!\n\n“From the minute I stepped into your office, I knew we would have an awesome party. You helped me with almost every aspect of the party — which wasn’t your job but just shows me how much you enjoy making people happy.\n\nYour concept for NYX is amazing.”\n\nMichele J.\n\nThe Key Ingredient\n\n“Dear Howie, You and your dancers were outstanding… did not want to go to bed without letting you know how impressed I was with you and your team. You kept the party alive the entire night. And you are so nice, very warm, and caring. Thanks so much, you were great! You were the key ingredient in tonight’s success. Again, thank you for your energy and your enthusiasm. Please let your dancers know how pleased we were also.” -Steven S.\n\nHuge Success\n\n“You did it! You made our party one that will not be forgotten. Our event was so much fun from the awesome music, the dancer, the fabulous light show, and fun party giveaways. Our friends are still talking about it, and we owe it all to you. We’re sure you saw the amount of people still on the dancefloor when it was over, which is not typical of a Service Guild event. We had so much fun working with you. Thank you so much for making it a huge success.” -Nanci F.\n\nHighlight of the Evening\n\n“Days and weeks after the event, our colleagues are still reminiscing about the entertainment! You were the highlight of the evening. We loved the variety of music played that kept everyone on the dancefloor! Again, many thanks for your assistance in creating a memorable event. We look forward to seeing you again soon.”\n\nRobin S. - Mandarin Oriental Hotel\n\nExcellent Entertainment\n\n“Thank you very much for the excellent entertainment that you provided for our women’s Alumnae meeting at the Royce Carlin Hotel. All of the women enjoyed the music and were pleasantly surprised at how many participated in the dancing. Your background music was a lovely addition to the awards ceremony, as well as to our dinner. Looking forward to working with you again!!!”\n\nChongsoon H.\n\nThe Absolute Best\n\n“I am pleased to take this opportunity to commend you on the excellent job you did for us as MC and DJ at our office party. My office is noted for always having great Christmas parties, however, this year’s was by far the absolute best! I can only attribute this to you and your group who provided the utmost in entertainment. Everyone who attended truly enjoyed themselves and raved about the music. Thanks again for doing such a great job. I’ll be sure to recommend you in the future whenever the opportunity arises.” -Carol D. – Chicago Title Insurance Company\n\nCraziest Dancefloor\n\n“This weekend was great! You all did a great job and I was very impressed. That was the craziest dancefloor I’ve seen in a long time, so a big thanks to you and your team! I hope to work together in the future soon!\n\nThanks again,”\n\nClaudia A.\n\nIncredible Success\n\n“Dear Howie, Thank you so much for your wonderful performance. You and your team impressed all the guests on Friday evening and made this event an incredible success. I shared with all the managers your contact information and collaterals to recommend NYX. I hope we will have the opportunity to work together on many occasions. I look forward to welcoming you again. Thank you again,”\n\nAmal Z. - The Ritz Carlton\n\nBaltimore is Talking…\n\n“Thanks for an amazing party. I truly did not think we could get so many people dancing! Everyone is asking who the DJ company was. Thanks again, and look forward to the video. The City of Baltimore is talking! Thanks again!”\n\nJoanne R. & Family\n\nParty in Philly was Great!\n\n“The party in Philly was GREAT! MC was AMAZING with the guests. He kept our program flowing, improvised when need be, handled his business… he was IMPRESSIVE and PROFESSIONAL. The dancers were great too… the young adults loved the dance lesson they received. This party was so much fun. My daughter Ashley will be in touch with you regarding an upcoming party. Thanks for everything. You have a market in Philadelphia. There’s nothing like NYX there. We’ll be in touch. Love you,” -Ardelia H.\n\nOverwhelming Success\n\n“Dear Howie, Just wanted to say thank you for helping us make our Annual Client Appreciation party such an overwhelming success. You and your group were entertaining, creative, professional, and a real pleasure to work with. You delivered on your promise to make it an unforgettable night and you will definitely be a part of any future Stephen Gould Corporation events. Sincerely,” -Robert R. – Sales Manager – Stephen Gould Corporation\n\nTHE BEST DJ … HANDS DOWN!\n\n“I am the Events Manager for my company. We just hosted our Summer Sales Meeting at the Watergate Hotel, and I hired NYX Entertainment for our company dinner event. Howie Teger is the BEST DJ I have ever hired for an event, hands down (and I’ve worked with many, across the country)! He inquired about our group beforehand, kicked off the dancing with a bang, and continued to read the room throughout the event and kept us on the dance floor until the bitter end. Even our CEO was raving about Howie! There is no reason to look any further. Hire NYX Entertainment for your next event… I promise… you will not be disappointed!” -Robin R.\n\nNext Level\n\n“I would recommend your company to anyone and everyone. You took our event to the next level! DJ FreqOut and the photobooth operator were both awesome and very professional. Only positive things to say.”\n\nLee G.\n\nFlexible…\n\n“Thank you Leko for entertaining our guests last night at La Banque at the Seaplane Base in Havre de Grace,MD. It was a pleasure having you. Your flexibility with the crowd and uncertain weather was much appreciated. To those looking for DJ and entertainment services, I highly recommend Leko. He is a great guy with modern equipment and the know how to make the crowd move! Everyone had a great time thanks to his talents!”\n\nKim B."
