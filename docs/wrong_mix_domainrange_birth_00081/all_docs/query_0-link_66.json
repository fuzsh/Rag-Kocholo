        "text": "Ego Nwodim is an Nigerian-American actor and comedian from Baltimore, Maryland, born on March 10, 1988. Nwodim graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in biology, and began her career in comedy and performance by taking classes at Upright Citizens Brigade in Los Angeles.\n\nShe became a regular cast member in the troupe, and created her own one-woman show entitled \"Great Black Women and Then There's Me.\" Nwodim made her film debut in indie short \"Getting Help\" (2012), and her television debut as a contestant on the short-lived horror-themed reality show \"Hellevator\" (Game Show Network, 2015-16).\n\nShe appeared in two episodes of the first season of \"Adam Ruins Everything\" (truTV, 2015- ), the comedic educational series that dispels popular perception and myths about a number of topics. Nwodim landed episodic appearances on the final season of \"2 Broke Girls\" (CBS, 2011-17) and the second season of Rob Schneider's series \"Real Rob\" (Netflix, 2015- ).\n\nShe undertook a small role, as an assistant, in the science fiction film \"Singularity\" (2017), her feature film debut. Nwodim played recurring character Lynn across three episodes of the first season of \"Law & Order True Crime\" (NBC, 2017- ). The anthology show was proposed to tackle different real world events with each season; its first season was subtitled \"The Menendez Murders\" and told the story of the titular brothers who married their parents in 1996.\n\nThe same year, Nwodim appeared in an episode of Rob Huebel's \"Do You Want to See a Dead Body?\" (YouTube Red, 2017), and in 2018 landed an episodic appearance on \"Living Biblically\" (CBS, 2018), which was cancelled after one season. Nwodim received her most attention and biggest role to date when she was cast as a featured player for the 44th season of \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ) in September 2018."
