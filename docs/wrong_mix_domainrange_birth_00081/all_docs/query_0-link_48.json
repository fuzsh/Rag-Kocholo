        "text": "Highest Rated: 49% The Midnight Sky (2020)\n\nLowest Rated: 48% Beautiful Creatures (2013)\n\nBirthday: Aug 27, 1987\n\nBirthplace: Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nBorn and raised in Baltimore, Mayland, Tiffany Boone refused to let her life be defined the murder of her father when she was a young child. Boone graduated from California Institute of the Arts in 2009, and decided to stay and work. Her first mainstream exposure came in 2012, when she played a two-episode arc on the police procedural \"Southland\" (NBC, 2009; TNT, 2010-13). The experience propelled her into a few more supporting roles on shows like \"Suburgatory\" (ABC, 2011-14) and \"Grey's Anatomy\" (ABC, 2005-), in addition to a supporting role in the feature film adaptation \"Beautiful Creatures\" (2013). Her most prominent role to date came in 2014, when she appeared in the second season of \"The Following\" (Fox, 2013-15), playing one of the acolytes of serial killer Joe Carroll. After her character was killed off, Boone continued to appear in supporting roles on shows like \"Major Crimes\" (TNT, 2012-), and \"Once Upon A Time\" (ABC, 2011-), in addition to a recurring role on the drama \"Complications\" (USA Network, 2015).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n49% The Midnight Sky\n\n48% Beautiful Creatures\n\nPhotos\n\nTiffany Boone Once Upon a Time, Tiffany Boone, 'Poor Unfortunate Soul', Season 4, Ep. #17, 03/22/2015, ©KSITE Once Upon a Time, Tiffany Boone, 'Poor Unfortunate Soul', Season 4, Ep. #17, 03/22/2015, ©KSITE The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Trust Me', Season 2, Ep. #3, 02/03/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Trust Me', Season 2, Ep. #3, 02/03/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Family Affair', Season 2, Ep. #4, 02/10/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone (L), Valorie Curry (C), James Purefoy (R), 'Fly Away', Season 2, Ep. #6, 02/24/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Betrayal', Season 2, Ep. #12, 04/07/2014, ©FOX The Following, Sam Underwood (L), Tiffany Boone (R), 'Betrayal', Season 2, Ep. #12, 04/07/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Trust Me', Season 2, Ep. #3, 02/03/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Trust Me', Season 2, Ep. #3, 02/03/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Family Affair', Season 2, Ep. #4, 02/10/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone (L), Valorie Curry (R), 'Fly Away', Season 2, Ep. #6, 02/24/2014, ©FOX The Following, Tiffany Boone, 'Betrayal', Season 2, Ep. #12, 04/07/2014, ©FOX The Following, Sam Underwood (L), Tiffany Boone (R), 'Betrayal', Season 2, Ep. #12, 04/07/2014, ©FOX DETENTION, from left: Travis Fleetwood, Aaron David Johnson, Tiffany Boone, Josh Hutcherson, Jonathan Park, Marque Richardson, Shanley Caswell, Spencer Locke, 2011. ©Sony Pictures Entertainment Tiffany Boone in attendance for Alice and Olivia by Stacey Bendet Fall 2014 Fashion Presentation, The McKittrick Hotel, New York, NY February 10, 2014.
