        "text": "1960: Neil Sedaka recorded eight takes of \"Calendar Girl\".\n\n1960: For the ninth week, \"Kiddio\" by Brook Benton held off challengers for the #1 spot on the R&B chart.\n\n1962: James Brown recorded the album Live at the Apollo, Volume I at the Apollo Theatre in New York City.\n\n1963: The Beatles recorded \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"From Me to You\", \"Money\", \"She Loves You\", \"You Really Got A Hold On Me\", \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and \"Twist and Shout\" for a radio program in Stockholm, Sweden as they got ready for a five-night tour of Sweden, their first tour outside the U.K.\n\n1964: The Rolling Stones played two shows at the Academy of Music in New York City.\n\n1964: \"We'll Sing In The Sunshine\" by Gale Garnett once again topped the Easy Listening chart for the fifth week.\n\n1964: Fourteen weeks had come and gone and no one could top one of the top albums of the early Rock Era--A Hard Day's Night by the Beatles.\n\n1964: The Rock Era had been around for nine years, but it was beginning to roll as the Shangri-Las were steaming up the charts with \"Leader Of The Pack\", a move from 59 to 20.\n\nThe memorable song \"Last Kiss\"...\n\n1964: Manfred Mann continued to have the #1 song with \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\", leaving \"Dancing In The Street\" by Martha & the Vandellas as just a great #2 song. Many thought \"Last Kiss\" by J. Frank Wilson & the Cavaliers would go to #1 and Gale Garnett's \"We'll Sing In The Sunshine\" was song #4. Roy Orbison's former #1 \"Oh Pretty Woman\" was still hanging around. The rest of the Top 10: The Supremes were bidding for the second #1 of their career (on the heels of \"Where Did Our Love Go\") with \"Baby Love\", Chad & Jeremy were at #7 with \"A Summer Song\", \"Let It Be Me\" from Betty Everett & Jerry Butler\", the Beach Boys couldn't advance with \"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)\" and the Honeycombs had a hot song with \"Have I The Right?\", which moved from 20-10.\n\n1965: The Lovin' Spoonful performed at the Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco, California.\n\n1966: Donovan released the single \"Mellow Yellow\". (Note: some websites erroneously report the date of release as November 24. The song debuted on the chart on November 12. Obviously, the people that produce those sites don't know that it is physically impossible for a song to debut on the Singles chart when it has not been released yet as a single.)\n\n1966: The Four Tops began a tour of England at the Saville Theatre in London.\n\n1969: David Bowie opened for Humble Pie at the Empire in Sunderland, England.\n\n1970: Pink Floyd achieved their first U.K. #1 album with Atom Heart Mother.\n\n1970: Newcomers the Carpenters remained at #1 on the Easy Listening chart with \"We've Only Just Begun\". That was week #3 for the duo.\n\n1970: Newcomers the Jackson 5 owned the #1 R&B song for the third week with their classic \"I'll Be There\".\n\nNeil Young had a Top 10 album...\n\n1970: The great Santana album Abraxas was the new #1, finally toppling Cosmo's Factory by CCR. Led Zeppelin was already making noise and debuted at #3 with Led Zeppelin III. The Jackson 5 moved up with Third Album while newcomer James Taylor enjoyed the success of Sweet Baby James. The rest of the Top 10: Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! by the Rolling Stones, the Soundtrack to \"Woodstock\" at #7, After the Gold Rush from Neil Young, Mad Dogs & Englishmen by Joe Cocker and the Carpenters entered the Top 10 with their first album Close To You.\n\n1970: Stevie Wonder had another winner as \"Heaven Help Us All\" moved from #78 to #49 on this date.\n\nR. Dean Taylor was being chased up the charts...\n\n1970: Another of The Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era* was #1 on this date--\"I'll Be There\" from the Jackson 5. Neil Diamond's former #1 \"Cracklin' Rosie\" sparkled at #2 and Sugarloaf's biggest career hit \"Green-Eyed Lady\" was third. The Carpenters were prophetic with \"We've Only Just Begun\" and Free headed downward with \"All Right Now\". The rest of an excellent Top 10: \"Fire And Rain\" from James Taylor, Dawn's \"Candida\" at #7, R. Dean Taylor had everyone talking with \"Indiana Wants Me\", I guess you could safely say that the Kinks were doing the same with their song \"Lola\" and Diana Ross was at #10 with her first solo hit \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\".\n\n1971: Don McLean released the album American Pie.\n\n1972: Steely Dan released their first career single--\"Do It Again\".\n\n1973: John Lennon sued the United States government, accusing it of tapping his phone.\n\n1974: David Essex starred in the movie Stardust, which premiered in London theatres.\n\n1978: Rod Stewart released the single \"You're in My Heart\".\n\n1978: Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones plead guilty to heroin possession.\n\n1979: The spectacular final Led Zeppelin album In Through the Out Door sparked a surge in past Zeppelin albums. On this date, all Led Zeppelin albums were ranked in the Billboard Top 200.\n\n1980: Paul McCartney earned a rhodium-plated disc from Guinness Book of World Records as the all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.\n\n1981: Don Henley first debuted away from the supergroup the Eagles as his duet with Stevie Nicks, \"Leather And Lace\" entered the chart.\n\n1981: The talented and all-around great guy Luther Vandross took over #1 on the R&B chart with \"Never Too Much\".\n\n1981: Tattoo You was now ingrained for a sixth week at #1 for the Rolling Stones on the Album chart. Journey's best album Escape was runner-up with Nine Tonight from Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band #3. Foreigner's 4 was at #4 and Bella Donna from Stevie Nicks remained the same. The rest of a solid Top 10: Dan Fogelberg's double album The Innocent Age, Precious Time from Pat Benatar at #7, Billy Joel had #8--Songs in the Attic, Al Jarreau's breakthrough Breakin' Away and the Moody Blues entered the list with their comeback album Long Distance Voyager.\n\n1981: Kenny Rogers had the #1 song on the Adult Contemporary chart with one of his career best--\"Share Your Love With Me\".\n\n1983: Elton John released the single \"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\" in the United States.\n\n1983: Hall & Oates released the single \"Say It Isn't So\" on RCA Records. (Note: one naive website claims the single was released October 29. Besides the obvious fact that new additions to radio station playlists need to be reported to the trade papers by a Wednesday of each week so they can be printed by Saturday (which in 1983 fell on October 26, it is physically impossible for a record company to mail a 45 to radio stations, be listened to and added to playlists, reported the trade papers, and printed and published by the trade papers, all in one day.)\n\n1987: Sting led the way on the U.K. Album chart with Nothing Like the Sun.\n\n1987: Michael Jackson scored his eighth #1 solo hit and his 17th Top 10 out of 25 releases with \"Bad\". Counting his work as lead singer of the Jackson 5, that already gave him 54 hits, 27 Top 10 hits and 12 #1's.\n\n1989: Simon & Garfunkel, the Who, The 4 Seasons, the Four Tops, Stanley, Idaho's Carole King and Gerry Goffin, the songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, the Platters, the Kinks, Bobby Darin and Hank Ballard were voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Induction ceremonies took place on April 4, 1990.\n\n1989: Janet Jackson released the single \"Rhythm Nation\".\n\n1992: Simple Minds registered their fifth #1 album in the U.K. with Glittering Prize 81-92.\n\n1992: Swing Out Sister scored the new #1 Adult Contemporary song--\"Am I The Same Girl\".\n\n1992: Boyz II Men remained at #1 for the ninth week with \"End Of The Road\". \"Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough\" by Don Henley and Patti Smyth, would have to settle for being one of the top #2 songs of the Rock Era.\n\n1992: R.E.M. debuted at #2 on the Album chart with Automatic for the People.\n\n1993: Duran Duran had to postpone their tour for six weeks after singer Simon LeBon tore a vocal chord.\n\n1995: The Smashing Pumpkins released the album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\n\n1995: Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders sang the U.S. national anthem of the United States prior to Game 3 of the World Series in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n1995: New York City declared it Tony Bennett Day.\n\n1996: Berry Gordy, Jr., the founder of Motown Records, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (on the South side of the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard).\n\n2000: Linkin Park released their debut album Hybrid Theory.\n\n2000: Shelley Fabares had a liver transplant after being diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis.\n\n2003: Ben Moody, a founding member and guitarist with Evanescence, walked out on the band prior to a concert in Berlin in the middle of a tour in Europe.\n\n2003: Bruce Springsteen pledged money to the Bottom Line, a New York club faced with eviction.

DeVille, guitarist of Poison, pleaded no contest to DUI and causing injury charges after he ran into a parked car in August.\n\n2009: Michael Buble owned the top album with Crazy Love.\n\n2011: Kelly Clarkson released the album Stronger.\n\nBorn This Day:\n\n1930: J.P. Richardson, Texas disc jockey who became famous under the name the Big Bopper (\"Chantilly Lace\") was born in Sabine Pass, Texas; died in the light plane crash February 3, 1959 that also claimed the life of Buddy Holly and Richie Valens shortly after takeoff.\n\n1930: Lewis Hamlin Jr., who played trumpet in James Brown's band, was born in Macon, Georgia. (Note: some websites show his birthplace as Baltimore, Maryland, but according to The Bronzetone Center for Music & History, Hamlin was born in Macon, then moved with his family to Baltimore.)\n\n1936: Bill Wyman, bass guitarist of the Rolling Stones, was born in Lewisham, London England.\n\n1937: Santo Farina of Santo & Johnny (\"Sleep Walk\") was born in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n1944: Ted Templeman of Harper's Bizarre (\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\" from 1967) and later producer of the Doobie Brothers, Van Halen, Aerosmith, and Captain Beefheart, was born in Santa Cruz, California.\n\n1944: Bettye Swann (\"Make Me Yours\") was born in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\n1946: Jerry Edmonton, drummer of Steppenwolf, was born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada; killed in a car accident in Santa Ynez, California November 28, 1993.\n\n1948: Buffin Griffin, drummer and founder of Mott the Hoople (\"All the Young Dudes\" from 1972), was born in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England.\n\n1954: Perry Lee Tavares of the group Tavares was born in Providence, Rhode Island.
