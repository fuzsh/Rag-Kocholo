Her multi-Emmy Award-winning daytime talk show, “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” is currently shooting its 5th season in New York after moving from Los Angeles (the show has already been picked up through 2025). Additionally, she was the winning coach on seasons 14, 15, 17, and 21 of “The Voice.” The Texas-born singer-songwriter first came to fame in 2002 as the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol and quickly became one of pop’s top singles artists.\n\nChemistry marks Kelly’s tenth studio album and third full-length release with Atlantic Records. Chemistry debuted to outstanding reviews and is nominated for a 2024 Grammy Award for “Best Pop Vocal Album.” Clarkson previously released nine studio albums (Thankful, Breakaway, My December, All I Ever Wanted, Stronger, Wrapped in Red, Piece By Piece, Meaning of Life, When Christmas Comes Around…), one EP, Kellyoke, one greatest hits album and two children’s books (New York Times Top 10 bestseller River Rose and the Magical Lullaby and River Rose and the Magical Christmas).\n\nClarkson was recently honored with the 2,733rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and is the recipient of an array of awards, including four consecutive Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host” and three consecutive Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Daytime Talk Series” for “The Kelly Clarkson Show”, three Grammy Awards, four American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, one MTV Movie & TV Award, two Academy of Country Music Awards, two American Country Awards and one Country Music Assn.
