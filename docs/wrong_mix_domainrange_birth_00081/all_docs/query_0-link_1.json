Her first tour in three and a half years, it supported her eighth studio album Meaning of Life (2017). The tour began in Oakland, California on January 24, 2019, and concluded on March 30, 2019, in Greenville, South Carolina, visiting arenas in various cities across the United States. This was Clarkson's highest grossing tour to date.[1]\n\nClarkson had previously declared her intention for a concert tour to support her eighth studio album Meaning of Life, which was her first album release with Atlantic Records.[2] Before the conclusion of the fourteenth season of The Voice and hosting the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, Clarkson revealed the tour was being \"routed\".[3] On September 14, 2018, she announced tour dates with her supporting acts Kelsea Ballerini and Brynn Cartelli (winner of The Voice's fourteen season from Clarkson's team), who joined her in a rendition of the album's titular track. Clarkson remarked in a statement, \"Even while recording it, I couldn't wait for people to experience the music live, to not only hear it, but feel it. It has taken almost a year of planning, and I can't wait to see y'all on the road!\".[4][5]\n\nClarkson had four to five wardrobe changes, two of them being major, and each night a portion of each show was live streamed. As well as bringing Byrnn Cartelli on tour, Clarkson also brought one of her other The Voice season fourteen contestants, D.R. King. He was singing background vocals for her.[6]\n\nThe show began with the venue becoming dark and clips of Clarkson's past hits playing. Clarkson then rose up to the stage wearing a black and red ballgown, and with a spotlight on her, she sang her first single \"A Moment Like This\" a cappella. The show closed with her well-known hit \"Since U Been Gone\". In between she performed tracks off her latest album Meaning of Life, past singles, past album tracks, and covers. A portion of each show was live streamed on her Facebook page. The segment is named after her Facebook live webisodes and song: \"A Minute and a Glass of Wine\". Clarkson’s backup singers started off singing the song \"A Minute and a Glass of Wine\", with Clarkson coming out shortly after and finishing it. She then covered a song that she picked (replacing \"Fan Requests\" from her past two tours). Some nights, she brought out a special guest (either a musical artist or someone who has done good) to give a sneak peek of what her upcoming talk show The Kelly Clarkson Show will be like (I.E. During opening night in Oakland, she brought out Allyn Pierce a nurse who during the Camp Fire (2018) made a heroic effort by driving in the fire to rescue people and at the Nashville show Clarkson's good friend Reba McEntire was her guest, and the two performed a medley of songs).[7] For \"Miss Independent\", she brought Kelsea Ballerini and Brynn Cartelli out on stage to sing the song with her.[8]\n\nFor this tour Clarkson had a VIP/bar stage, \"A Minute + A Glass of Wine...Bar Experience\" where the bar surrounded the b-stage. VIP ticket holders received things like a drink ticket, one merchandise gift signed by Clarkson, custom signed wine glasses, an invitation to the 'Meaning of Life' Lounge, and more.[9]\n\nJim Harrington of The Mercury News says, \"The concert reached the next level with the fourth selection, \"Love So Soft,\" a standout rocker from \"Meaning of Life\" that shows just how much soul Clarkson can bring to the party when she has the right material to work with.\" And \"Part of what makes Clarkson so impactful on stage is her sincerity. She comes across as someone you can trust, and even more so, someone who you'd want to hang out with.\"[8] Daily Herald journalist Sarah Harris, who attended the Salt Lake City show said that Clarkson brought down the house.[10] Emily Gardiner of the Deseret News said, \"Clarkson hasn't missed a step during her three-year hiatus from touring.\", and that her \"voice carried the same power and soul that fans have loved since her \"American Idol\" win back in 2002, reminding the audience just how incredible her voice sounds live.\"[11] Tulsa World's Jimmie Tramel said, \"She didn't just sing to the audience. She connected. You've probably been to a concert where unnamed superstar artist came off as trying to be some sort of higher species. Clarkson, born and raised in Texas, was engaging in a manner that made you feel like she was just glad to be barefoot and hanging out with her Oklahoma peeps.\"[12]\n\nKendra Meinert of the Green Bay Press-Gazette said, \"There was never a moment during her hour-and-45-minute show that the crowd of about 7,000 wasn't with her every step of the way, from the synchronized jumping up and down during \"Stronger\" to the heartbreak of \"a Piece by Piece\" with a lone acoustic guitar to a rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" for a 14-year-old fan in the crowd.\"[13] Althea Legaspi of the Chicago Tribune said, \"Clarskon was savvy in mostly culling crowd pleasers delivered with a down home approach driven home with her easy banter.\" and \"her beguiling voice and personality were more than enough to fill the arena.\".[14] Thor Christensen of Guide Live who attended the Dallas show said, \"Clarkson proved just how much grit she has in her gymnastic soprano. Her voice was in brilliant form all night.\"[15]\n\nThis was Clarkson's highest grossing tour to date, grossing $17,490,910, and selling over 275,000 tickets. All twenty-eight shows were sold out. This tour surpassed her previous highest grossing tours; The Breakaway Tour and Addicted Tour.[1]\n\nThis set list is from the January 24, 2019, show in Oakland, California. It does not represent every show.[16][17][18]\n\n\"Miss Independent\" was performed with Kelsea Ballerini and Brynn Cartelli. However, during the March 9, 14, and 15 concerts in Allentown, and Uncasville, Clarkson and Cartelli performed the song with Maggie Rose in replacement of Ballerini.\n\nDuring the January 26, 2019, concert in Los Angeles, \"Run Run Run\" was performed with John Legend in replacement of King.[19]\n\n\"Move You\" was not performed during any of the March concerts. In addition, the medley was not performed after the March 21, 2019 concert in Cleveland. [20]\n\nDuring the March 28-30, 2019, concerts in Duluth, Nashville, and Greenville, \"Broken & Beautiful\" was performed.[21]\n\nClarkson performed one cover song as part of a segment referred to as \"A Minute + A Glass of Wine\" in a more intimate fashion.[22]\n\nList of 2019 concerts[40] Date (2019) City Country Venue Opening acts Attendance Revenue[41] January 24 Oakland United States Oracle Arena Kelsea Ballerini\n\nBrynn Cartelli 10,083 / 10,083 $628,492 January 25 Fresno Save Mart Center 8,540 / 8,540 $578,857 January 26 Los Angeles Staples Center 13,202 / 13,202 $840,867 January 30 Salt Lake City Vivint Smart Home Arena 10,225 / 10,225 $562,922 February 1 Glendale Gila River Arena 10,782 / 10,782 $617,993 February 7 Kansas City Sprint Center 8,537 / 8,537 $508,824 February 8 Tulsa BOK Center 9,354 / 9,354 $558,005 February 9 Southaven Landers Center 7,391 / 7,391 $469,022 February 14 Grand Rapids Van Andel Arena 10,049 / 10,049 $598,150 February 15 Green Bay Resch Center 7,398 / 7,398 $580,951 February 16 Saint Paul Xcel Energy Center 13,457 / 13,457 $806,768 February 21 Detroit Little Caesars Arena 9,451 / 9,451 $531,032 February 22, Rosemont Allstate Arena 11,572 / 11,572 $792,127 February 23 St. Louis Chaifetz Arena 7,082 / 7,082 $538,504 February 28 Dallas American Airlines Center 12,052 / 12,052 $826,935 March 2 Wichita Intrust Bank Arena 8,589 / 8,589 $453,849 March 7 Uniondale Nassau Coliseum 9,991 / 9,991 $744,527 March 8 Boston TD Garden 11,687 / 11,687 $1,011,390 March 9 Allentown PPL Center Brynn Cartelli\n\nMaggie Rose 8,325 / 8,325 $633,717 March 14 Uncasville Mohegan Sun Arena 14,231 / 14,231 $743,633 March 15 March 16 Baltimore Royal Farms Arena Kelsea Ballerini\n\nBrynn Cartelli 10,605 / 10,605 $738,259 March 21 Cleveland Quicken Loans Arena 8,256 / 8,256 $453,786 March 22 Indianapolis Bankers Life Fieldhouse 11,060 / 11,060 $574,518 March 23 Cincinnati U.S. Bank Arena 11,026 / 11,026 $603,348 March 28 Duluth Infinite Energy Arena 9,275 / 9,275 $500,544 March 29 Nashville Bridgestone Arena 13,604 / 13,604 $871,410 March 30 Greenville Bon Secours Wellness Arena 10,825 / 10,825 $722,569 Total 276,639 / 276,639 (100%) $17,490,910\n\nSource:[42]"
