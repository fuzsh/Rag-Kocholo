        "text": "With one week (and four hours) of \"American Idol\" under our belts, we've now devoted more time to watching auditions good, bad and deranged than it would take to screen \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"The Godfather, Part II.\" That's just something to think about in the weeks and months ahead as the \"Idol\" hours pile up.\n\nFor those who can't pass a single evening without \"Idol\" stargazing, there is a \"Biography\" (9 p.m., Biography) of Kelly Clarkson, the very first \"Idol.\"\n\nI'm always amused by \"Biography\" profiles of the overnight sensations, particularly when the sensation is entirely manufactured. \"Biography\" returns to Clarkson's hometown of Burleson, Texas, where the future singer of \"A Moment Like This\" spent her pre-fame years working as a cocktail waitress and vacuum-cleaner salesman. Or is that salesperson? After \"Idol\" she would leave the bags of dust and lint and the town of Burleson behind and go on to sell more than 16 million albums.\n\nAs a critic of television and not pop music, I'll leave it to others to judge the quality of Clarkson's voice or her chances for pop immortality. But the sound of her voice and the insipid nature of songs such as \"A Moment Like This\" make me thankful that I am a TV critic. To indulge in a cliche, I'm not sure I could listen to Clarkson even if they paid me.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of celebrities on \"The Apprentice\" (9 p.m., NBC, TV-14) has halted the slide of that reality franchise into oblivion. It debuted to healthy ratings but faded last week when faced with airings of new episodes of \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"CSI.\"\n\nOne thing is certain, however: Gene Simmons all but eclipses Donald Trump as the most vulgar cartoon character on the show. While both the brash New York developer and the Kiss legend appear to be playing well-rehearsed parts, Simmons takes the role of the self-assured, poker-faced, misogynistic pig to a new level. And tonight, The Donald puts Simmons in charge of the winless women's team in a contest involving a mobile-printing facility. Let's see what develops.\n\n\"Police Tech: Stolen Cars\" (8 p.m., National Geographic) looks at the new gadgets intended to reduce the number of auto thefts in America, which now run in excess of 1.2 million cars per year.\n\nOn two episodes of \"Without a Trace\" (CBS, TV-14, V), a judge in a bitter divorce case goes missing (8 p.m., r), the anti-war daughter of a troubled Vietnam vet goes missing (10 p.m.).\n\nThe warden (Craig T. Nelson) asks Earl to settle a gang dispute on \"My Name Is Earl\" (8 p.m., NBC, r, TV-14).\n\nBetty's perfume triggers Henry's de-scent into madness on \"Ugly Betty\" (8 p.m., ABC, TV-PG).\n\nJohn Leguizamo appears on \"The Martha Stewart Show\" (8 p.m., Fine Living, r).\n\nRyan returns to Scranton and asserts his authority on \"The Office\" (8:30 p.m., NBC, r, TV-14).\n\nThe chief requires some time for male bonding on \"Grey's Anatomy\" (9 p.m., ABC, r, TV-14).\n\nThe family of a girl reportedly possessed by demons is found slain on \"CSI\" (9 p.m., CBS, r, TV-14, V).\n\nPratt becomes skittish about his relationship with Bettina on \"ER\" (10 p.m., NBC, TV-14).\n\nDuncan battles public relations disasters on \"Big Shots\" (10 p.m., ABC, TV-14).\n\nWatch performers you've never heard of (or haven't thought or cared about in years) undergo detox and withdrawal symptoms on \"Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew\" (10 p.m., VH1, TV-MA).\n\nThe Baltimore bakers are hired to create a pastry suitable for the Super Bowl on \"The Ace of Cakes\" (10 p.m., Food, r).\n\nThe speculative 2007 documentary-style film \"CSA: The Confederate States of America\" (7 p.m., IFC) offers a \"what-if\" look at American history had the Union not prevailed in the Civil War.\n\nMiss America Lauren Nelson appears on \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\" (8 p.m., Fox) ... Lana assumes Clark's super- strengths and vows to crush Lex on \"Smallville\" (8 p.m., CW, TV-PG, D, S, V) ... Wayne Brady hosts \"Don't Forget the Lyrics\" (9 p.m., Fox) ... Victims drown on dry land on \"Supernatural\" (9 p.m., CW, r, TV-PG, D, L, V).\n\nKevin McDonough, a syndicated columnist who lives in Narrowsburg, can be reached at kmcdonough@unitedmedia.com."
