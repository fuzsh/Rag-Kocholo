        "text": "On our road to Nashville from Philly, we had to try Buc-ee’s food to figure out if it is worth the hype. But first, we want you to learn a little bit about WHY we are driving across the country!\n\nAs we drive across the country, along the way, weare making stops like Cowtown Cowboy Outfitters, Dr. Pepper’s Grave and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum. Check out all their stops on our CMA Crashers page on the website.\n\nWhat Is The “CMA Crashers”\n\nLast year, the Andie Summers Show won the CMA for Major Market Broadcast Personality. Andie & Shannon were invited to fly to Nashville and accept the award while being able to interview a ton of artists.\n\nThis year, XTU was nominated for Major Market Station of the Year. I believe this is the 4th straight year of being nominated for Major Market Station of the Year and unfortunately, we did not take home the Win! Super bummer!\n\nHow can you not have XTU down at the CMA Awards? That would be a travesty!\n\nSo…What did we decide to do? Shhh, don’t tell anyone. We decided to Crash the CMA’s. Jeff Kurkjian from The Andie Summers Show and XTU weekend DJ extraordinaire Justin Franiak will rent a car and drive down to Nashville. The CMA’s are being held on Wednesday, November 8th and you need a ticket to get in. They might not be able to get a ticket but the artist interviews are being held on Monday & Tuesday.\n\nKeep listening and checking back to this page to see Jeff & Justin’s CMA Crashers journey as they travel from Philly to Nashville. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIs Buc-ee’s Food Good?\n\nWe tried it! First, let’s take you inside an actual Buc-ee’s! If you don’t know what it is, it is a staple in the south. A MASSIVE grocery store and rest stop, clothing store, it’s basically a giant Walmart if I am being honest.\n\nCheck it out."
