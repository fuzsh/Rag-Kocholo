        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has had quite the year, and so her 42nd birthday will be one where she can truly reflect on everything she's achieved in such a short space of time.\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show host celebrated her birthday on April 24 in New York City, where she has been living for almost a year.\n\nThe American Idol alum, along with her two young children, River, nine, and Remi, seven, moved from Los Angeles to NYC last summer, for a new chapter both in their lives, and in Kelly's career.\n\nHer show had moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown, Manhattan, and premiered its fifth season on October 16.\n\nJust a few months after moving to NYC, Kelly was given a special job that properly cemented her time in the city, as she hosted the annual Rockefeller tree lighting ceremony.\n\nShe has enjoyed adapting her lifestyle too, and told Audacy in October that her children are now settled in their schools too.\n\n\"My son walked out of his school and was like, 'This is the right school for me. The other one didn’t fit like this one,'\" she said of her son Remington.\n\nShe also told USA Today that both her and her children are delighted with their new home. \"At this point, I'm 40 years old. Mama rented something nice! I was like, 'I’m not living here unless it’s right by the park and really nice for the kids.'\"\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show has won yet more awards since Kelly's move too. She received both the Outstanding Talk Show Host and Outstanding Talk Show at the Daytime Emmy Awards in 2023.\n\nThe star's confidence has also grown for all her fans to see. She's practically glowing as she hosts her talk show each weekday, dressed in fashion forward outfits put together by her new New York based stylist, Micaela Erlanger, who also works with A-listers including Meryl Streep.\n\nDuring a recent chat with HELLO!, her go-to stylist, Micaela, said of her style transformation: \"It's a new look, it's a new year, and it's a really exciting place to be. I'm really grateful that she trusts me and hat she trusts my eye and we're experimenting and playing a bit more.\"\n\nThe star's appearance has also noticeably changed. She has been rocking longer blond hair as of late, and on-trend straight bangs, which frame her face beautifully.\n\nSince moving to NYC, the award-winning singer has also been inspired by the fast pace of life and is walking everywhere, something that wasn't all that easy in LA. As a result, Kelly has gone down several dress sizes, and is feeling more happy and confident than ever before.\n\nDuring an interview with People magazine, Kelly cited an increase in exercise to the reason behind her weight loss transformation, adding that the steps she walks in New York City give her \"quite the workout\".\n\nShe also revealed that she has lost the weight for health reasons. \"I dropped weight because I've been listening to my doctor,\" she told People magazine.\n\n\"A couple of years I didn’t.\" This means not only adding more exercise to her regime but focusing on a healthy diet too. \"I eat a healthy mix,\" said the star.\n\n\"90 percent of the time I'm really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I'm a Texas girl, so I like meat. Sorry, vegetarians in the world!\".\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
