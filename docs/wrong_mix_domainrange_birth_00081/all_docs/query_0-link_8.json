        "text": "American musician Frank Zappa, born on December 21, 1940, was known for his eclectic music style and provocative commentary. His career expanded across various genres, including rock, jazz, and orchestral compositions, making him one of the most innovative and versatile musicians of the 20th century. A self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's creative genius was evident from his early years, and he rose to prominence in the 1960s as the leader of the band The Mothers of Invention. Zappa's work was characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, and satirical lyrical content. His album Freak Out!, released in 1966, was one of the first double albums in rock music and is often considered one of rock's first concept albums. His subsequent albums, such as We're Only in It for the Money and Hot Rats, further cemented his reputation as a musical maverick, pushing the boundaries of conventional music. Apart from his music, Zappa was also known for his political activism and his outspoken views on freedom of speech, education, and the dangers of organized religion. He testified before the U.S. Congress in 1985 against the Parents Music Resource Center's proposal for music censorship, establishing himself as a defender of First Amendment rights. Despite his passing in 1993, Frank Zappa's influence continues to resonate in the world of music and beyond, with his legacy encapsulating not just an astonishing body of work but also a philosophy of questioning societal norms and championing individual expression.\n\nWilliam Richard Frisell (born March 18, 1951) is an American guitarist, composer and arranger. One of the leading guitarists in jazz since the late 1980s, Frisell came to prominence as a stalwart for ECM Records. He went on to work in a variety of contexts, notably as a member of the New York City Downtown Scene where he formed a long partnership with John Zorn. He was also a longtime member of Paul Motian's groups from the early 1980s until Motian's death in 2011. Since 2000, Frisell's eclectic output as a bandleader has emphasized folk, country music, and Americana."
