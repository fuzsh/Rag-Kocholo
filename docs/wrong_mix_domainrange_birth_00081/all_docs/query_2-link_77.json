        "text": "During her championship season on the first American Idol in 2002, Kelly Clarkson wowed judges and viewers in ways that countless contestants have emulated since but few ever repeated. But whatâs most amazing about the Texan sweetheartâs Cinderella story is not how she earned that first burst of reality-TV glory but how she extended her 15 minutes to weather setbacks and forge a career as one of musicâs best-loved performers. Clearly Clarksonâs power and versatility as a vocalist were equaled by her determination and resilience, qualities she displayed when she shifted away from pop ballads like her Idol signature song âA Moment Like Thisâ toward spunkier declarations of autonomy like 2004âs âSince U Been Goneâ and 2011âs âStronger (What Doesnât Kill You).â Those hits proved Clarkson was just as happy rocking out as she was demonstrating her fervent love for pop, country, and R&B. They also showed how even major-league song doctors like Max Martin had to conform to Clarksonâs style and sensibility, not the other way around. Her eighth consecutive album to debut in the top three spots on the Billboard album charts, 2017âs Meaning of Life was her most confident and well-rounded statement to date. The single âHeat,â an irresistible gospel-house hit fueled by Clarksonâs unbeatable spirit and limitless energy, proved she could cut it as a club diva, too."
