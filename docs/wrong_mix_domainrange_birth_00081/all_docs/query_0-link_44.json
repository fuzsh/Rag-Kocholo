        "text": "The 'Dirty Jobs' host released his film debut, 'Something to Stand For,' in 2024.\n\nBy David Triana\n\nJul. 2 2024, Updated 3:03 p.m. ET\n\nAt one point or another in our lives, we’ve all imagined what it would be like to have our dream job. For some it might be becoming the next big-time actor; for others it could be becoming a world-renowned doctor. However, for someone like Mike Rowe, it's all about seeing how dirty one can get while on the job.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhen he began hosting his fan-favorite Discovery Channel show Dirty Jobs, Mike made it his mission to delve into some of the most difficult, demanding, and messy jobs in the country. And while the majority of fans recognize Mike from the show, his career expands much farther than Dirty Jobs, which has helped him do very well financially and position his net worth where it is today.\n\nWhat is Mike Rowe’s net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, it’s estimated that Mike's net worth is around $30 million. As one might expect, his gig as the host of Dirty Jobs is a huge reason as to why the show became so successful — and also one of the main reasons as to why he’s worth millions.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, Mike's career began way before Dirty Jobs. In fact, his very recognizable voice found its place in the Baltimore Opera as he was finding his footing in Hollywood.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAs he shared in an interview with Kelly Clarkson, his operatic era was really just to get his foot in the door of the entertainment business and get his SAG card, but then Mike actually grew to enjoy it. In addition to his hosting Dirty Jobs, he has also score several voiceover gigs as a voiceover artist and narrator.\n\nMike Rowe\n\nTV Host and Narrator\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nMike Rowe is the host of Dirty Jobs and hosts and produces several other television shows and podcasts.\n\nBirth date: March 18, 1962\n\nBirth place: Baltimore, Md.\n\nBirth name: Michael Gregory Rowe\n\nFather: John Rowe\n\nMother: Peggy Rowe\n\nEducation: Graduated from Towson University with a degree in communication studies, 1985\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHow much does Mike Rowe make on 'Dirty Jobs'?\n\nAs a producer on Dirty Jobs, Mike Rowe’s salary has been estimated at $4 million, according to CA Knowledge. Aside from his work on the show, the other projects that Mike has been a part of have helped contribute to his overall net worth.\n\nFollowing Dirty Jobs, Mike could be seen on CNN’s Somebody’s Gotta Do It, and the Facebook Watch series Returning the Favor. One thing that has helped Mike find continued success is his ability to resonate with all ages through his friendly personality.\n\nAs such, Mike has lent his talents to narrating shows like American Chopper, American Hot Rod, Deadliest Catch, and How The Universe Works. He also could be seen in an episode of American Dad and Tim Allen’s Last Man Standing.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIs ‘Dirty Jobs’ still on the air?\n\nThe show first ended in 2012, but years later Mike announced that the show would be coming back in an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta in December of 2022. The new season of Dirty Jobs went on to premiere on Dec. 11, 2022.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe style of Mike Rowe's debut film 'Something to Stand For' was inspired by his podcast.\n\nTaking a cue from his own The Way I Heard It podcast, Mike produced his feature film debut Something to Stand For, which released in June 2024 and examines some of the incredible (and lesser known) stories behind a number of remarkable figures in history. And just like the episodes of his podcast — where \"each mystery is a trueish tale about someone you know, filled with facts that you don’t,\" per his site — the film also presents its stories as mysteries of sorts, revealing who the tale is about after each story concludes.\n\n\"I didn't make this movie for Republicans or Democrats … conservatives or liberals,\" Mike said, per Forbes, \"but for people who first and foremost see themselves as Americans …. There are some who say patriotism is on the ropes, and I’m afraid they may be right.\""
