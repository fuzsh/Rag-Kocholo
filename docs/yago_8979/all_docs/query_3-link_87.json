        "text": "Sorry this is so late - but I owe a lot to Mr. Barnett. He was my physics (not chemistry) teacher at Fenwick High School and inspired me to a technical career that I am now retired from. He was truly the best teacher I had ever had.\n\nShared by russ mickiewicz fhs '69 on 10/11/2023 5:10 PM\n\nGreetings from Alton ! My condolences to Mr. Barnett’s family. I dread turning to the In Memory page of our ETHS Alumni paper to see if I recognize anyone. Last night after coming home from work and grabbing my two pieces of mail , I eventually read Mr. Ray Barnett’s mini obit. . With that came sadness that he passed , yet an abundance of memories came rushing back. It was my Junior year of 1978-79 that he was the chemistry teacher of that Techniques and Applications of Chemistry class I fortunately was able to enroll in . Was I so very lucky , lucky and fortunate occasionally I am. What a wonderful , fun , and truly open and humane teacher he was ! I met some great classmates too. A class I looked forward to and now thankfully a beautiful flashback has reappeared in my memory. My brother Bill ( Class of ‘73 ) was complimentary with his experiences I remember when I mentioned him back then. I enjoyed reading the other comments. Thank you Mr. Barnett. It’s all positive about you. I wish I could’ve met you again , but one day …. Your former student , Philip J. O’Connor , Class of ‘80\n\nShared by philip o'connor on 11/18/2021 1:34 PM\n\nDeepest sympathy to Ray's family. I was a '61 graduate with Ray. My memory may be playing tricks on me, but I remember playing poker with Ray in the back of the bus on the way to our Senior Retreat. I'm wondering if that really happened. I was so impressed that Ray took over teaching chemistry for Father Fisher at Fenwick. Fr. Fisher was an institution and stories about Father told by his students abound. Rest in peace, Ray, and urge Our Lord to pay special attention to your Fenwick classmates who remain here on earth. Michael Baloun\n\nShared by michael baloun '61 on 10/29/2021 10:48 PM\n\nTo the Barnett family: My sincerest thoughts and prayers for strength are with you all. May you find comfort in the wonderful memories of Ray that you have. Marie Binkowski\n\nShared by marie binkowski on 10/27/2021 2:44 PM\n\nRay was our golf partner for years, which included John B., George D, Fred L., and John L. I’ll miss him greatly for his wit and sense of Humor. His jokes were many ,and always when I was ready to drive the ball. I would crack up over many of them, which were pretty good, and others…. Pretty bad. The thing is , he made us all laugh. He was lots of fun on and off the course. I liked that he coined us the “Dubbers” because we were…. guys having fun trying to hit the ball. If it wasn’t for ETHS I wouldn’t have the privilege to know such an incredible teacher and scholar!! He was genuine, kind and always there if you needed him. I’ll miss him tremendously! Goodbye my friend. Don\n\nShared by don golas on 10/26/2021 2:12 PM\n\nRay was our golf partner for years, which included John B., George D, Fred L., and John L.

Goodbye my friend.\n\nShared by don golas on 10/26/2021 1:56 PM\n\nI am deeply saddened by the passing of Ray. He was a good friend and golfing buddy (he organized the golf). But his personality was particularly important to me in the ETHS Science Department. He was one of the small group of teachers who welcomed me to the ETHS community in 1984. As it turned out I probably taught more years with Ray in general chemistry than any other teacher in any other class and he was a wonderful teacher, working with challenging students. But that was his choice. But Ray played one role of which many of his colleagues may not be aware but as a department chair I was aware. Occasionally, one of our colleagues would get into trouble. As a representative of the union, Ray would work with the teacher to be sure he/she was treated fairly, and help work out a suitable solution to the problem which might include a departure of the teacher from ETHS. But Ray never told you more than you needed to know. He was very professional. Socially, we became good friends after retirement. I miss him dearly.\n\nShared by john buchanan on 10/25/2021 7:25 PM\n\nDear Lois and family, I got to know Ray more closely when working with our union. He brought a sense of fairness, insight and good humor that made a difficult task a pleasure.\n\nShared by william p siavelis on 10/24/2021 6:32 PM\n\nDear Lois, we have so missed seeing and chatting with Ray and Molly. Please know that you and your family are in our prayers. Monty is missing his girlfriend, Molly. We are here for you. Love, Eileen, Jim and Monty\n\nShared by eileen & jim knockemus on 10/19/2021 7:36 PM\n\nPlease accept my deepest condolences on Ray’s passing. As a former student (1972), I was so lucky that my schedule drew Ray. He was thoughtful, kind and a brilliant motivator. As hard as chemistry was for me to learn, Ray was always with me, alongside with his gentle wisdom, fun sense of humor and encouragement. He was one of handful of teachers who inspired me to become a teacher, myself. When I joined the faculty at ETHS, I told Ray my goal was to measure up to the standard he set as my teacher. Throughout my career, I always saw Ray’s impact on me as my chemistry teacher as my own measuring stick - I will be forever grateful for the luck of the draw in 1972 and the years teaching as a fellow faculty member at ETHS. at ETHS.\n\nShared by charlie davis on 10/19/2021 2:02 PM\n\nLois and family, I am so very sorry for your loss of your husband and father. I only met ray a few times at Brookfield zoo events with you Lois and I always thought of ray as a fine gentle man. I hope you find solace in the celebration of ray’s quite remarkable life.\n\nShared by gail carlson on 10/18/2021 12:19 AM\n\nMy deepest sympathy to you and your family. He was a wonderful, loving husband for so many years. May your memories give you comfort.\n\nShared by elaine davison on 10/17/2021 8:59 PM\n\nWith deepest sympathy. May you take comfort in loving memory and the friends and family that surround you. God Bless.\n\nShared by al and pat brinton on 10/17/2021 4:51 PM\n\nI am so sorry to hear about Ray's passing. I know he was a wonderful husband and father. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time.\n\nShared by margaret johnson on 10/17/2021 3:16 PM\n\nI taught 34 years at ETHS and I will always remember Ray’s ever present friendly smile and welcoming personality. My prayers are with the family.\n\nShared by john willson on 10/17/2021 1:41 AM\n\nRay was a colleague and friend for 25 years at ETHS. Although in different departments, his mastery of teaching was obvious to all. Job well done my friend.\n\nShared by larry olson on 10/16/2021 9:14 PM\n\nLois, my deepest sympathy to you and all of Ray's family. There was such a sense of loss at the news of his passing. Though I seldom saw him since our retirements from the high school, we spent so many years working closely together on union activities. The negotiations committees he chaired many times and the tireless effort he putin on grievances helped and enriched the lives of all of his colleagues. But mainly I remember his devotion to you and the girls and how he made every day a fun but thoughtful experience.\n\nShared by mary emerson on 10/16/2021 2:29 PM\n\nI grieve for the grievance chairman. I was lucky to be a beneficiary of Ray's wonderful sense of humor on the golf course as well as at ETHS. We had fun reminiscing about teachers we had at Fenwick H.S. and how they affected our careers. He offered good advice about students we had in common, and shared his expertise, helping me navigate the Teachers' Retirement system. I love Ray.\n\nShared by fred ludwig on 10/16/2021 12:33 PM\n\nI am so sorry for your loss and the pain you must feel. I new Ray as an amazing teacher and colleague. Beginning in 1986 I joined ETHS as a biology teacher, was inaugurated into the “lunch bunch” along with Mike C. and had the great fortune and pleasure to teach the next 16 years in a classroom adjacent to Ray’s. Ray was my mentor and my friend. His quips, jokes and quick wit lit up many a day for me and all those who knew him. It always seemed to me that somehow Ray knew what was really important, whether in the classroom or in everyday life. Thank you for the memories Ray!\n\nShared by craig smith on 10/16/2021 5:11 AM\n\nTo Finish: To sum up my experience with Ray as a colleague, he was the best every day teaching experience mentor that a young teacher could have. Whenever I encountered a teaching experience that required considerable thought, I would say to myself, how would Ray handle this.\n\nShared by michael carpenter on 10/15/2021 9:32 PM\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss, and it is with heavy heart that I search for words that will measure up to the man that Ray was. I was a freshman at ETHS in 1968 when Ray started teaching there. I started teaching at ETHS in 1986 and was able to share 16 wonderful years learning from one of the best educators on this planet. The \"lunch bunch\" was first hosted by Bob Alexander, then Harold Weeks, and then Ray Barnett. It was at the \"lunch bunch\" that the young kids were \"shown the ropes\" by the elders.\n\nShared by michael carpenter on 10/15/2021 9:28 PM\n\nI taught Mathematics at ETHS during most of Ray's career. He befriended me on my first day and was always helpful, cheerful and inspirational. His students loved Chemnistry because he made is challenging and interesting. He was a truly great teacher.\n\nShared by john benson on 10/15/2021 8:13 PM\n\nIn many ways Ray mentored me, especially on matters related to the Teachers'Union. We served together on the Grievance committee protecting the rights of our teachers. He was so kind and patient. A smile that would light a room greeted all his students even on a bad day. Through the years I have thought of him so fondly. My condolences to his family and close ones.\n\nShared by pamela baumgartner on 10/15/2021 7:20 PM\n\nI only overlapped with Ray as an ETHS teacher for a few years, and have golfed with him on occasion. I remember him as a friendly colleague who was always willing to speak his mind. I will miss him, and my prayers are with you.\n\nShared by russell kohnken on 10/15/2021 6:02 PM"
