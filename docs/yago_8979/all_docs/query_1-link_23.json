He was killed in the line of duty when his convoy was destroyed by a road-side bomb.\n\nDr Gallant is survived by his wife, Dr Neela Rasgotra – an ER doctor at County General in Chicago and his parents. His father is an active serviceman.\n\n– – – – – –\n\nMichael was a character on ER, my favourite show. Every part of my being is embarrased about the fact that I was truly upset last night to learn of his death. Its a very sad state of affairs that this is how the war effects me.\n\nIt is truly amazing that I don’t think about the women and men serving across seas everyday.\n\nI know I’ll think about it today.\n\nRIP Micheal Gallant."
