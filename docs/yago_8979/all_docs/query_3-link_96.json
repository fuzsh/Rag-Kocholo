        "text": "Jeffrey Lynn “Jeff” Barnett, 60, went home to be with his Lord and Savior November 19th, 2021, following a long illness.\n\nJeff was born on May 3rd, 1961, in Wellston, Ohio to Ray Glendon Barnett and Marilyn Cleo Barnett. One of five brothers, he enjoyed playing sports such as baseball, wrestling and football. Jeff was a lifelong fan of the Ohio State Buckeyes. He gave his life to the Lord when he was 19. Jeff moved to Springfield in 1980, where he soon began working at Southern Missouri Containers (SMC). Jeff worked there for 40 years until his health made it where he could no longer continue. Jeff began attending church with friends when he moved to Springfield. He met Cheryl Barnes through friends, and they were married in 1986. While he enjoyed working, his main joy was his wife and three children: Molly, Merry and Maggie.\n\nHe leaves behind wife, Cheryl Ann Barnett; daughter, Molly Ann Ellis and son-in law Raymond Lavern Ellis, daughter, Merry Lynn Barnett, daughter, Maggie Layne Barnett; and one grandson, Redmond Lavern Ellis. He is also survived by four brothers: Floyd Barnett, Ray Barnett and wife Sherry, Kenny Barnett, and Randy Barnett. He is survived by brother and sister-in-law, Tim Barnes and Donna Barnes, and sister and brother-in-law, Caryn Berry and Michael Berry. He is also survived by many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his father, Ray Glendon Barnett and mother, Marilyn Cleo Barnett. He was also preceded by his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Robert Gerald Barnes and Vera Opal Barnes.\n\nJeff served the Lord in many capacities – serving as the head of security at church and as a deacon, helping those in need and being a compassionate co-worker and friend.\n\nVisitation for Jeffrey Lynn Barnett will be held from 4 p.m. – 6 p.m. on Tuesday, November 23rd and funeral services will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, November 24th, 2021, at Greenlawn Funeral Home East, with interment to follow at Greenlawn Memorial Gardens."
