        "text": "Want to hear how smart I am? I saw this post, and was \"like woah, someone should definitely write a Carter fic!\"\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I remembered that I already wrote one.\n\nEnjoy:\n\nRating: G\n\nFandom: ER\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own ER\n\nSpoilers: Season 3, but before Dennis Gant's incident\n\n\"Good morning Dr. Benton,\" Dr John Carter greeted, walking into the washroom to scrub up for surgery. He was assisting Dr. Benton in repairing a perforated appendix.\n\n\"Morning Carter,\" replied Benton, glancing up. \"You look like hell.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well I've been on since yesterday morning. I'm exhausted.\" Benton, finish cleaning his hands, held them out for a nurse to put surgical gloves on. Suddenly, Carter paused in his scrubbing and sneezed loudly into his cupped hands. \"heeschoo!\" He rinsed the soap off his hands, \"great, now I have to start over. He reached for a new scrub brush pointedly not looking at the smirking Benton. But no sooner had he began scrubbing his hands again, he felt another tickle in his nose. Knowing Benton was still there, he tried to hide his predicament. This proved to be easier said than done, as his nostrils flared and his breath caught. \"Hehh...ehh...\"\n\n\"Carter? Benton took a step toward him. \"Why did you stop scrubbing? Stop screwing around.\"\n\n\"HEESCHOO!\" Carter couldn't hold it back any longer. He sighed in frustration at having to start again. Before he could even open the brush, though, Benton asked the nurse to page Dennis Gant, Carter's fellow surgical intern. Carter gave him a questioning look. \"Since when does it take three people to fix a perf?\"\n\n\"It doesn't,\" Benton told him in his usual no-nonsense tone. \"Gant is joining me in the OR and you are covering the ER in his place.\" Carter made to argue, but Benton broke him off, \"Do not argue with me Carter. You are ill and a risk to surgical patients.\"\n\n\"I'm not ill,\" Carter argued, before sneezing explosively again. \"ACHOO\" He glared at Benton for a minute before stomping out of the room and down to the ER. \"Hey Dennis,\" he called, spotting his friend doing charts at the admit desk. \"Go up to the OR.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\" he asked excitedly.\n\nCarter sighed resignedly. \"Yup, I'm taking over the ER for you.\"\n\n\"Sweet!\" Gant jumped up and pumped his fist in the air.\n\n\"I've never seen anyone so excited to be with Benton,\" Carter chuckled.\n\n\"Well I have 24 charts to do and more keep coming,\" Gant told him. \"Now I believe they're yours. Enjoy.\"\n\nCarter plopped down in the swivel chair Gant had vacated and picked up a pen. \"Great, just gre-gre-ACHOO!\" He sniffed wetly. \"Great.\"\n\nGant grinned and started to the elevators. Carter pulled a chart closer to himself to start on it.\n\n***\n\nIt became painstakingly clear to Carter why Gant had been happy to leave the charts behind. He had been working for an hour and was only a third finished. He pulled chart #9 up and put his pen to it, before dropping his pen again and grabbing a tissue from the box Jerry had found him after he had sneezed for the \"gazillionth time\", as Jerry had put it. He put the Tissue up to his face and sneezed into it twice. \"etchh! Exxtch\" He crumbled up the tissues and tossed them into the trashcan before retrieving his pen.\n\nBEEP!! BEEP!! BEEP!! Carter jumped in surprise as his beeper went off. He checked it, it was the ER. They needed a surgical consult. He ran toward the exam rooms, looking around. He aw Susan Lewis gesturing at him to come into exam 1. He did, and she gave him the bullet. \"34 year old female, lower quadrant pain, belly extended and nontender.\" carter gave him a quick check over and deemed him as nonsurgical. \"Thank, Carter,\" she said. \"By the way, do you realize you look like hell?\"\n\n\"That seems to be the genera consensus,\" he replied as his beeper went off again. He quickly went to trauma 2 where there was a 17 year old boy with a bullet to the abdomen. The boy, a gang banger named Tyrone, did need surgery. They stabilized him and Carter took him up. On the surgical floor, he ran into Benton, who took the patient from him.\n\nAs Carter turned to head back down, Benton called after him. \"Hey Carter?\" He turned again to face his former teacher. \"I want those charts in an hour.\" And with that, went to scrub in.\n\nHis hour was half up, and he had only completed about 65% the charts. Normally, that would have been making good time, but nothing was good enough for Benton. He finished up with the chart he was working on, and pulled up another one up. That was when the paramedics came rushing in with a gurney. Not being able to see the person on the gurney from his sitting position, Carter decided to stay put. He needed to finish the charts. After all, maybe the patient wouldn't need a consult.\n\n\"Dr. Carter get in here,\" ordered Dr. Mark Greene. Carter sighed, threw his pen down, and hurried over. The patient, an elderly woman who couldn't remember her name, had been hit by a car as she stood in the middle of the street singing. \"Alright, I want 10 mgs of haladol,\" Dr. Green told the nurse. He turned to Carter. \"What do you think?\"\n\nCarter finished his examination. \"She's bleeding into her abdomen.\"\n\n\"Surgery, then?\"\n\nCarter nodded. \"Can someone else take her up? I have a ton of charts to finish.\" A nurse came, gave him a dirty look for making her do his job, and began pushing the gurney toward the elevator. \"Thanks,\" he called after her.\n\n\"How many charts do you have left?\" Dr. Green asked.\n\n\"ETTSCHUU!!\" He sneezed violently in response.\n\n\"I see,\" Mark joked, \"so you're almost finished?\"\n\nCarter shook his head. \"Not even close.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a hand,\" Mark offered. \"I'm on lunch.\"\n\n\"You don't have to give up your lunch for me,\" Carter told him. \"I can handle them on my own. Go get something to eat.\"\n\nMark pulled a granola bar out of his lab coat pocket and held it up for Carter to see. \"I've got two, do you want one?\" Carter shook his head. \"Are you sure?\" Carter nodded. Hunger wasn't his dominant feeling right now. That would be the urge to sneeze. His eyes squinted shut and his nose twitched, but he couldn't sneeze.\n\nMark looked at him with concern. \"Are you OK?\" he asked.\n\n\"I ha-ha-have to sneeeeze,\" Carter choked out.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Mark told him\n\n\"Can't,\" was the desperate reply.\n\n\"Oh,\" Mark looked thoughtful for a minute. \"Look up at the light.\"\n\nCarter did so and immediately snapped forward with a forceful sneeze. \"ETTSCHOO!\"\n\n\"Bless you,\" Mark told him, holding out his second granola bar. \"Now let's get started on those charts.\"\n\nSo I have two ER fics. One is a Ray sneeze fic and the other is a West Wing / ER crossover fic with Carter sneezing. I hope everyone likes them. I'm going to put the West Wing / ER one in this post and the other one in my next post.\n\nWest Wing/ER Crossover Fic\n\nrated maybe PGish\n\n“Jesus, Sam! Why are you so damn accident prone?” Toby Ziegler demanded of his deputy as they drive to the hospital.\n\n“It’s not like I purposely slipped outside the hotel!” Sam Seaborn replied wincing as Josh Lyman pulled the gauze pad from the cut on his forehead.\n\n“You sound like a couple of little old women,” Josh commented with a sigh. “Where is this hospital? Sam is still bleeding.”\n\n“The doorman at the hotel said that it was on this street…somewhere,” Toby muttered searching both sides of the street.\n\n“I hate Chicago!” Sam decided taking the gauze from Josh and putting it back on his forehead, wincing again.\n\n“Sam, two hours ago you loved Chicago,” Josh pointed out with a smile.\n\n“That was before the sidewalk attacked me,” said Sam frowning.\n\n“We’re here. I found it,” Toby interrupted as he veered into a parking space. The two older men helped Sam from the rental car and into Cook County General Hospital.\n\n“Uh, hi. My friend slipped on the icy sidewalk outside of our hotel and cut his head,” Josh said to the young brunette sitting behind the admin. desk.\n\n“That’s nice. Sit in chairs and a doctor will see you eventually,” she replied popping her gum. Someone yelled something about the computer not working and she heaved a sigh, “I’m coming, Jesus!” She walked away muttering. Josh turned back to his coworkers and sat down in a huff, anger passing over his features.\n\n“What the hell?! Do they want you to bleed to death?” he asked sitting down.\n\n“Relax, Josh,” Sam said rolling his eyes. ‘I’m not going to bleed to death.”\n\n“I sure hope not. There’s too much paperwork involved,” came a voice from behind the three men. Turning, they saw a pretty nurse smiling at them. With gentle fingers, she pulled the gauze away from Sam’s forehead just enough to see the cut. ‘I’m Abby. I’ll take you to an exam room. She grabbed the arm of a doctor walking by, “Carter this guy needs sutures.”\n\n“Fine. Curtain two is open. I’ll be the-heh hesssshhhhh! Shhhhhh! Eshhhhhh! I’ll be there in a minute,” Dr John Carter sighed, twisting quickly away from Abby’s grip and walking away rubbing his nose.\n\n“He seems like barrels of fun,” Toby commented as they walked to curtain area two.\n\n“Toby, of all people you shouldn’t talk about someone else being crabby,” Sam pointed out eliciting a snicker from Josh.\n\n“I assure you that Dr. Carter is our very best. He’s just feeling a little under the weather,” Abby told the West Wing staffers. “Just wait here and one of us will be back soon.” She gave Sam a new piece of gauze to hold to his cut and walked away.\n\n“She seems nice,” Josh commented watching her walk away.\n\n“Josh, stop checking her out! She’s probably in a relationship and we are going back to Washington tomorrow,” Sam said as Toby rolled his eyes.\n\n“So, I bet I could still win her over!” Josh exclaimed stubbornly, never one to back down from a challenge.\n\n“Win whom over?” Carter asked sitting down. “You aren’t talking about Abby, are you?” He smiled a little, pulling on some gloves. “Good luck if you are. That Abby Lockhart is a tough woman to win over.” Carter turned to the side suddenly and sneezed twice into the crook of his elbow, “Eh-hushhhhhhhhh! Huh-huhsshhsssssssshhhhhh!”\n\n“Bless you,” Sam offered.\n\n“Thank you,” Carter sniffled. “Well I guess by now you know that I am going to suture your cut, right?”\n\n“Yeah, I’m Sam Seaborn. That’s Toby Ziegler and Romeo over there is Josh Lyman,” Sam replied.\n\n“Hey! You three work in the White House, don’t you?” Carter asked scrunching his pink and irritated nose. He started to sneeze, but managed to suppress the urge at the last second. Sam nodded as Carter gave him a shot in his forehead to numb the skin.\n\n“Think I should try the White House card on her?” Josh asked his friends. Sam and Toby both shook their heads in exasperation.\n\n“Here’s the suture kit, Carter,” Abby said, returning to his side. She placed her hand lightly on his shoulder, “I’m off in like five minutes. Don’t work too hard and I’ll have something hot waiting for you when you get home,” she half-whispered to him.\n\n“Okay, I’ll be home by nine,” he smiled at her. As she walked away he sneezed again, “heh-heh-eshhhhh! HEH-heh shhhhhhhh! Shhhhhhh! Ahassshhhhhshhh!” He turned back to his work, excusing himself, and pretended to ignore Josh’s dumbfounded look, while Toby and Sam struggled to keep straight faces.\n\n“So, Josh, still think you have a chance with her?” Sam asked. Josh blushed and mumbled something that the others did not catch.\n\n“Well, Mr. Seaborn, after I give you three stitches, you are going to need a head CT to rule out a concussion,” Carter told Sam acting as if Josh hadn’t just made a fool out of himself.\n\n“How long will that take?” Toby asked impatiently. “We have a thing to get to.”\n\n“Hepshhhhhh! Heh- hang on- heshhhhhh! Shehshhhhh! Shhhhhh!” Carter sneezed. “Excuse me,” he sniffled. “About an hour, hopefully no longer. I’ll call CT as soon as I finish with these sutures.” He rolled his neck back and forth a bit. “I promise that this won’t hurt a bit.”\n\n“Well, your CT shows no concussion. You should keep the sutures dry and have your doctor remove them in five days, okay?” Carter was filling out the discharge papers.\n\n“Do I get anything for the pain?” Sam asked hopefully. “Or a doctor’s note to get my out of this meeting?”\n\n“Take Tylenol if you feel any pain and you should rest, but I can’t order you to bed, sorry,” Carter replied. “Take care guys,” he coughed into his fist.\n\n“Hey,” Josh finally spoke after being uncharacteristically silent since Abby left. Carter glanced at him. “No hard feelings?” Josh asked.\n\n“I guess I can forget about it,” Carter replied hiding his smile. “Just don’t let it happen again,” Carter added shaking Josh’s hand.\n\n“Don’t worry, I don’t plan on coming here again!” Josh said emphatically. He followed Sam and Toby from the hospital and Carter watched them shaking his head. With a sigh he finished filling out the chart. His nose was getting stuffier and his head was beginning to ache. Rubbing his temples, he winced when he heard Dr. Jing-Mei Chen call from behind him.\n\n“Hey, Carter, those old women from the nursing home are back and since you treated them the last two times, bounce back rules give them to you,” she said handing him the charts. Carter coughed roughly and heaved another sigh.\n\n“Why is it I always get stuck with crackpots like them and these women?”\n\nHere's the Ray (aka Dr. Barnett) Fic.\n\nAgain rated PGish\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart sighed tiredly. It had been a long shift and she was looking forward to going home, taking a bath and grabbing her much deserved four hours of sleep. Since starting as an intern, she doubted that she’d had a decent eight hours of sleep. With another sigh, she pushed off of the sidewalk and entered Cook County General Hospital. Glancing at the clock, she realized that her shift had been over for twenty minutes. She slipped into the doctor’s lounge hoping to sneak out before any problems arose in the emergency room. As her eyes adjusted to the change in light, she became aware of a person slumped on the couch. Upon closer inspection, she saw that it was Ray Barnett.\n\n“What are you still doing here?” Your shift ended half an hour ago,” she teased him knowing Ray was notorious for clocking out the second his shift was over. There was no response. “Ray?” she approached him and realized that he was asleep. “Ray, get up.” She touched his arm was surprised to find him warm. Warmer than he should have been. He started awake at her touch.\n\n“Huh? Oh, Abby, id’s you,” he managed his voice hoarse and a bit congested. He turned from her and muffled a sneeze into the cork of his elbow. Heshumph!\n\n“How long have you felt sick?” she asked gently putting down her coat and sitting on the edge of the couch.\n\n“All shifd,” Ray mumbled sniffling. Abby thought back on the shift and wondered how she’d missed it.\n\n“Well, shift’s over now. Why don’t you go home and sleep…you know in a bed instead of on this crappy couch.” It finally registered with Abby that her hand was still on Ray’s arm and she hastily pulled it away.\n\n“Can’d. Roobbades throwing a pardy,” Ray replied sitting up but groaning a bit at the pain in his head. He dissolved into a fit of coughing. Abby bit her lip, unsure of what to do. She knew that party meant loud musicians, lots of drinking and no chance for sleep. Definitely not what Ray needed at the moment. Watching Ray sick and vulnerable played to her sense of sympathy and in the end won out over all of her reservations.\n\n“Come back to my place. You can crash there,” Abby finally said. Before Ray could argue, she handed him his coat and slid hers on standing up. “Well, come on. I’d like to actually get some sleep tonight.” Ray stared at her blankly.\n\n“You sure?” he asked sniffling again.\n\n“Yes, “ she replied with a nod of her head. “Now let’s go before I realize what a big mistake I’m making.” He put on his coat and stood up. The sudden movement sent him swaying, black spots clouding his vision. Abby instinctively slid her arm around his waist to steady him.\n\n“Are you okay? I mean we don’t have to check you in, do we?”\n\n“No. Id’s jusd a code,” Ray replied. Once he was steady, both became very aware of her arm around his waist. Abby pulled away her arm feeling swollen and heavy. “So, uh,” Ray cleared is throat, “Are we leaving?” Abby nodded and they made their way outside.\n\nEven though it was spring and fairly warm out, Ray shivered visibly upon hitting the night air. Abby ushered him to the car and turned the heat on for him. The ride to Abby’s apartment was mostly silent, punctuated only by Ray’s increasingly desperate sneezing. By the time they had reached their destination, Abby was tempted to turn the car around and take Ray back to the hospital. When she tried to voice this opinion, however, Ray vehemently disagreed. So, possibly against her better judgment, Abby led the younger doctor into her apartment.\n\n“Don’t mid the mess, Neela tends to leave things lying around,” Abby apologized referring to her roommate and fellow intern Neela Rasgotra.\n\n“Where id-heh hehshhhhh! Heshhhhh! Shhh! Shhh! Ugh, where id Neela?” Ray asked shutting the door. He gave Abby a grateful smile as she produced a box of tissues from the living room table for him.\n\n“Shift,” Abby replied. She shed her jacket and took his setting them both on one of the small chairs. After a brief mental debate, aided by watching Ray sniffle and blow his nose repeatedly, Abby decided that Ray needed a proper night’s sleep. In essence, he needed a bed. “All right Ray, you can sleep in my bed. I’ll sleep on the couch.” Before he could argue, she cut him off, “Don’t argue with me. You are sick and only getting worse. Just be glad I’m not taking you back to the hospital.”\n\n“Okay. Thags Abby,” Ray whispered.\n\nRay followed Abby into the bedroom and stood in the middle of the room unsure of what to do. Abby went to her dresser and pulled out a pair of scrub pants. She tossed them to Ray.\n\n“Those should fit you, they were Carter’s,” she said. Ray looked up at her quizzically.\n\n“Carter as id Dr. Carter?” he asked turning to the side and sneezing twice. “Heshhhhhh! Shhhhhhh!” Abby nodded. “Ub…you mead thad you two used to libe together?”\n\n“Yes. We were together for awhile,” Abby replied vaguely. She really didn’t feel like dissecting her personal life at that moment, especially with Ray. “Just change into those, you’ll be more comfortable.” And with that she left the room, suddenly sure that she didn’t want to be in the room while Ray changed. She went into the kitchen and poured a glass of water the whole time trying to figure out why all of a sudden she was feeling slightly warm feelings towards Ray.\n\nWhen she finally felt that she had a grip on her emotions, Abby went back to her bedroom. Ray was already in bed with the blankets pulled up close to his face. “Are you warm enough?” Abby asked gently setting the water on the nightstand.\n\n“Yeah,” Ray replied coughing into the blanket. Abby made a mental note to change her sheets the next day.\n\n“Good, get some sleep. That is why I brought you here,” Abby said thinking of how wonderful sleep sounded at that moment. She didn’t care that Neela normally slept on the couch; it was hers for the night.\n\n“Thags Abby,” Ray murmured his eyes sliding closed. Abby smiled before turning off the light and exiting the room. She went into the kitchen and made herself a sandwich before getting ready for bed. Just as she was about to turn off the light and lay down, a yell occurred from her bedroom. Hurrying in, she found Ray sitting upright and even in the darkness of the room, she could see the panic on his face.\n\n“Ray, what? What happened?” Abby asked approaching the bed. Ray just stared at her wide-eyed. Reaching the bedside, she brushed her hand against his forehead and found that his fever had risen quite a bit. “Tylenol.” She muttered and went into the bathroom to fetch some. Returning she practically forced Ray to take the pills.\n\n“Just go back to sleep,” she sighed. Ray shook his head.\n\n“Stay here. Please?” He whispered sounding like a little kid. “ Abby hesitated unsure of that idea. “I need you.” He whispered. Abby’s head shot up in surprise and she looked at Ray warily. Realizing from a doctor’s perspective that leaving him alone wasn’t a good idea, she tried to ignore the little voice in the back of her head that told her she secretly wanted to be in bed with Ray.\n\n“Okay, Ray. I’ll stay here until you fall asleep, deal?” she asked sitting down on the bed. Ray nodded and lied back down. Unsure of whether the younger intern was sleeping, Abby decided she’d wait for a while just to be sure. Before she knew it, she’d fallen asleep.\n\nThe shattering of glass woke Abby the next morning. Opening her eyes, she saw Neela standing in the doorway, a glass of orange juice now shattered and spilled all over the floor.\n\n“Neela, what?” Abby asked still foggy from sleep.\n\n“I – I’m sorry. I just wanted to make sure you got up for your shift and I didn’t mean to interrupt,” Neela began to explain talking very fast.\n\n“What?” Abby looked around confused and her eyes fell on the form of Ray sleeping next to her curled around her. “Oh my - Neela its not what it looks like!” Abby began.\n\n“No, no far be it from me to interfere. Next time I’ll knock!” Neela said and with that she turned and shut the door behind her.\n\n“Shit!” Abby swore. When had she fallen asleep? She didn’t remember lying down or letting Ray use her as a pillow. She also wasn’t sure how she felt about it. Part of her knew it was wrong and the other part of her liked it.\n\n“Whad’s goidg od?” Ray asked groggily. “Heshhhhhhh! Heh heh HEH hesssshhhhh!” He sneezed into the crook of his elbow.\n\n“Nothing. Neela just thinks we’re sleeping together, that’s all,” Abby replied wiggling her way out of the bed.\n\n“Oh,” Ray replied. “Well it might be because you slept in bed with me last night.” He grabbed some tissues and blew his nose.\n\n“Thank you Dr. Barnett,” Abby replied sarcastically. “Are you feeling better?” She asked with a sigh.\n\n“I dod’t dow. Aboud the sabe I guess,” he replied with a sniffle. “I have a shift soon.”\n\n“Yeah, me too,” Abby said slowly. “You shouldn’t go into work. Call in sick,” she said kindly. Ray shook his head.\n\n“Do, Lewis is looked for a reasod to yell at be. I deed to go id,” Ray argued. He tried to get out of bed but was hit by a dizzy spell. Abby managed to catch him before he fell over.\n\n“Yeah I don’t think so, Ray,” Abby said. “I’ll drop you off at home on my way in.” Ray started to argue but cut himself off sneezing so Abby took it as an agreement. “But before we go, we need to explain to Neela about what happened last night.”\n\n“Whad did happed last dight? Why did you ed up in bed with be?” He asked as Abby helped him sit back down.\n\n“You screamed in the middle of the night. I came in and you asked me to stay. I’m assuming you had a nightmare. Why, don’t you remember?” Abby asked in confusion.\n\n“No,” Ray confessed. “I don’d. Hopefully I didn’t say adythid I shouldn’d habe.” He blew his nose again trying to break up some of the congestion.\n\nAbby thought back to him saying “I need you.” Before responding trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice, “No, nothing. Come on, let’s go get this cleared up with Neela.” With a sigh she helped Ray up and they left the bedroom.\n\nThat night Abby came home and remembered that her sheets needed to be changed. Upon realizing that they still smelled faintly of Ray, however she changed her mind and decided that she could handle a few cold germs. She curled up in the bed and eventually fell into a lonely sleep."
