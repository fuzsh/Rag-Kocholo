        "text": "Get your lowdown on what's going on in the world of Hollywood, right here!\n\nDev Patel has said that he is too young to settle down and has no plans to marry his Slumdog Millionaire co-star Freida Pinto.\n\nThe 21-year-old actor has been dating the beauty since they met on the set of Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning 2008 film.\n\nThey have been dogged by marriage rumours ever since, prompting Patel to deny reports in 2010 that they were engaged, and now he's opened up to reveal he still has no plans to take their romance to the next level.\n\n'No, we are not engaged,' the Daily Express quoted Patel as telling chat show host Graham Norton.\n\n'I am 21! There are so many rumours about us but no, we are just working hard,' he said.\n\nNaomi Watts will play Princess Diana in a new film that will centre around the final two years of her life and her love affair with a heart surgeon.\n\nCaught In Flight will focus on Diana's relationship with Hasnat Khan, the man she described as 'Mr Wonderful.'\n\nIt will be directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, whose 2004 film, Downfall, charted the last days of Adolf Hitler.\n\nWatts, 43, replaces Jessica Chastain, who was attached to the project last year but pulled out.\n\n'It is such an honour to be able to play this iconic role -- Princess Diana was loved across the world and I look forward to rising to the challenge of playing her on screen,' the Telegraph quoted Watts as saying.\n\nThe film begins shooting later this year.\n\nHirschbiegel said he was 'delighted to have such a truly exceptional actress who embodies the warmth, humanity and empathy of such a global icon as Princess Diana.'\n\nHe described the plotline as 'a love story between a princess locked in a tower and an ordinary man.'\n\nParminder Nagra has reportedly filed for divorce from her husband James Stenson, after three years of marriage.\n\nAccording to the divorce papers obtained by TMZ.com, the 36-year-old actress, who now stars in Alcatraz, has cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe two had been dating for seven years before marrying in 2009 and in May that year, they welcomed their son Kai.\n\nNagra found fame in the film Bend It Like Beckham before heading to the small screen with shows like ER where she plays Doctor Neela Rasgotra."
