        "text": "Ray Ernest Barnett, age 77, passed away on Monday, March 18, 2024, after battling multiple illnesses over the last 2 years. He was born December 4, 1946 in Jefferson County, AL to the late John Ernest Barnett and Ruth Tillery Barnett. Ray graduated from Ohio State University and honorably served his country in the US Air Force where he met his wife, Linda Barnett. He made his career as an electrical engineer and retired from IBM.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Linda Westerman Barnett to whom he was married for almost 57 years. Together, they created a beautiful family; son, Jeff Barnett (fiancé, Mary Ellen Gordan); daughter, Keli Allen (husband, Kelly Allen); grandchildren: Michael Barnett, Leah Barnett, Justin Barnett, Michael Johnson, Dustin Barnett; 12 great-grandchildren; brother/sister: Jay Barnett; Connie Lawson.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Ray was preceded in death by his brother, John Barnett.\n\nRay devoted his life to his family. He loved wood working, vegetable gardening, fishing, and enjoying time in the kitchen. On weekends, you would find him watching football. His favorite teams were “The” Ohio State Buckeyes and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Ray also loved to watch NASCAR. Ray was a wise man to whom his family adored and looked up to. He will be missed by all of them. Although he may only be here in spirit, memories and his life lessons will live on forever.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the National Heart Association, National Lung Association or Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation.\n\nA Celebration of Ray’s Life will be held at the Barnett Residence, 1920 Old Greenfield Road, Raleigh, NC 27604 on Saturday, March 23rd at 1:00 pm."
