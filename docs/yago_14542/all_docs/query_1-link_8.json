        "text": "Indian actor (1950-2017)\n\nOm Prakash Puri, (18 October 1950 – 6 January 2017) was an Indian actor who appeared in mainstream commercial Hindi films as well as Urdu, Malayalam, Bengali, Kannada, English, Punjabi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Marathi films, as well as independent and art films and also starred in several international cinema. He is widely regarded as one of the finest actors in world cinema.[1][2] He won two National Film Awards for Best Actor, two Filmfare Awards and India's fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 1990. In 2004, he was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire.[3][4]\n\nHe is best known for his author-backed roles in films like Aakrosh (1980), Arohan (1982), Ardh Satya (1983), television films like Sadgati (1981) and Tamas (1987), light-hearted roles in Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983), Chachi 420 (1997), Hera Pheri (2000), Chup Chup Ke (2006) and Dhol (2007) and several mainstream commercial films throughout his career. He had various collaborations with director Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani.[5] Puri also appeared in non-Indian productions in the United States, Pakistan[6] and Britain.[7] In the 1990s, he appeared in My Son the Fanatic (1997) and the comedy drama East Is East (1999), receiving a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPuri was born to a Hindu Family in Ambala, Haryana.[9] His father, Tek Chand Puri,[10] worked on the railways and in the Indian Army.[11] Puri's parents received no birth certificate and had no records, so his family was unsure of his birth date. But his mother told him he had been born two days after the Hindu festival Dussehra. When he began his schooling, his uncle chose 9 March 1950 as his \"official\" birthday. However, as an adult when he moved to Mumbai, Puri looked up when Dussehra was celebrated in 1950, to establish his birth date as 18 October.[12]\n\nPuri came from an underprivileged background. When he was six years old, his father who was a railway employee was put behind bars on allegations of theft of cement. This resulted in their family becoming homeless. To make ends meet, Puri's brother, Ved Prakash Puri, worked as a coolie (railway porter) and Puri worked in a local tea shop,[13] did odd jobs and collected coal from nearby railways tracks to support his family.[14] He and his brother's children were later brought up by a maid servant, Shanti.[15]\n\nWhile working, Puri continued to study. After his primary education, he joined the National School of Drama in Delhi to study theatre acting.[16] A fellow NSD student who became a long-term friend, Naseeruddin Shah, encouraged Puri to follow him to the Film and Television Institute of India in Poona (present-day Pune).[15][17] In an interview with The Times of India, Puri later recounted his family was so poor that he did not have a decent shirt to wear when he joined FTII. According to Shah, Puri was disappointed by his education at FTII, and also was unable to pay tuition fees—when he became well-known, the institute followed up the debt of ₹280, which Puri refused to pay due to the \"impish thrill\" of owing them money.[18]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPuri's first film was Chor Chor Chhup ja, a children's film. During this time, to make ends meet he also worked at the Actors' Studio, where future actors such as Gulshan Grover and Anil Kapoor would be his students.[13]\n\nSubsequently, Puri worked in numerous Indian films, as well as many films produced in the United Kingdom and the United States.[19]\n\nPuri made his debut in the mainstream films genre in the 1976 Marathi film Ghashiram Kotwal,[20][21] based on a Marathi play of the same name by Vijay Tendulkar.[21] It was directed by K. Hariharan and Mani Kaul in cooperation with 16 graduates of the FTII.[22] He has claimed that he was paid \"peanuts\" for his best work.[23] Along with Amrish Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil, he was among the main actors who starred in what was then referred to as art films such as Bhavni Bhavai (1980), Sadgati (1981), Ardh Satya (1982), Mirch Masala (1986) and Dharavi (1992).\n\nHe was critically acclaimed for his performances in many unconventional roles such as a victimized tribal in Aakrosh (1980);[24] Jimmy's manager in Disco Dancer (1982);[25] a police inspector in Ardh Satya (1982),[25] for which he got the National Film Award for Best Actor;[26] a humble husband in Seepeeyan (1984),[27] Vinod's uncle in Zamana the leader of a cell of Sikh militants in Maachis (1996); as a tough cop again in the commercial film Gupt in 1997; and as the courageous father of a martyred soldier in Dhoop (2003).\n\nIn 1999, Puri acted in a Kannada film A.K. 47 as a strict police officer who tries to keep the city safe from the underworld—it became a huge commercial hit. Puri's acting in the film is memorable. He rendered his own voice for the Kannada dialogues. In the same year, he starred in the successful British comedy-drama film East is East, where he played a first-generation Pakistani immigrant in Northern England,[24] struggling to come to terms with his far more westernised children.\n\nPuri had a cameo in the highly acclaimed film Gandhi (1982, directed by Richard Attenborough).[24][28] In the mid-1990s, he diversified to play character roles in mainstream Hindi cinema, where his roles are more tuned to mass audiences than film critics. He became known internationally by starring in many British films such as My Son the Fanatic (1997), East Is East (1999)[25] and The Parole Officer (2001). He appeared in Hollywood films including City of Joy (1992),[27] opposite Patrick Swayze;[28] Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson;[27][28] and The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) opposite Val Kilmer.[28] In 2007, he appeared as General Zia-ul-Haq in Charlie Wilson's War, which stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.[27]\n\nHe has worked in Hindi television serials like Kakkaji Kaheen (1988) (roughly meaning \"Uncle Says\") as a paan-chewing 'Kakkaji', which was a parody on politicians, and Mr. Yogi (1989) as a suave 'Sutradhaar' who enjoys pulling the protagonist's leg. These two serials underlined Om Puri's versatility as a comedian. He received critical acclaim for his performance in Govind Nihalani's television film Tamas (1988)[25] based on a Hindi novel of the same name. He played comic roles in Hindi films like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro which reached a cult status,[27] followed by Chachi 420 (1997), Hera Pheri (2000), Chor Machaye Shor (2002), Deewane Hue Pagal, Chup Chup Ke, Kismet Connection and Malamaal Weekly (2006) and Oh My God. He was regular in films directed by Priyadarshan and Kamal Haasan.\n\nHis notable roles in commercial Hindi films included Drohkaal, In Custody, Narsimha, Ghayal, Mrityudand, Aastha, Hey Ram, Pyar Toh Hona Hi Tha, Farz, Gadar, Lakshya, Dev (2004), Rang De Basanti, Yuva, Singh Is Kinng, Mere Baap Pehle Aap, Billu, Kyunki, Lakshya, Dabangg, Bhaji in Problem, Khap, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Ghayal Once Again. Puri was seen in the role of Mohammad Ali Kasuri in Road to Sangam (2009). In 2010, he appeared in The Hangman. In 2011 he was in the Indian action film Don 2.\n\nHe has also worked in some episodes of the TV series Aahat during the second season which was aired between 2004 and 2005 on Sony channel. Other notable television appearances included Bharat Ek Khoj, Yatra, Mr. Yogi, Kakaji Kahin, Sea Hawks, Antaral and Savdhaan India's second season.[29]\n\nIn 2014, he appeared opposite Helen Mirren in the comedy-drama The Hundred-Foot Journey.[20][27] At the time of his death in January 2017, he was working on the Marathi film, 15 August Bhagile 26 January.[30]\n\nSeveral of his completed films released after his death including Viceroy's House and Tubelight.[31]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPuri married director/writer Seema Kapoor, the sister of actor Annu Kapoor, in 1991, but their marriage ended after eight months.[32]\n\nIn 1993, he married journalist Nandita Puri, with whom he had a son named Ishaan.[33][34] In 2009, Nandita wrote a biography of her husband titled Unlikely Hero: The Story of Om Puri. Upon the book's publication, Puri spoke of his anger at the inclusion of explicit details of his previous relationships.[35] In 2013, Nandita filed an allegation of domestic violence against him, and the two opted for a judicial separation shortly afterwards.[36]\n\nHis second wife reported that they kept a \"secular house\",[37] but that \"while Om is not ritualistic, he does not mind others being so\".[37] He took \"solace in spiritual reading\", particularly in the writings of spiritual teacher Eknath Easwaran, many of whose books he shared with friends.[37] Puri seldom took politics seriously, and often found relaxation by cooking or gardening.[37] In an interview to Rajya Sabha TV in 2012, Om Puri spoke about his interest in agriculture and cooking, and suggested that his dream was to open a dhaba by the name Daal Roti.[38]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2016, Puri appeared for a debate on a news channel regarding a Hindi film producer's ban on Pakistani actors after the Uri attack. During the debate, he made insulting comments about Indian soldiers which led to heavy criticism on social media. However, Puri later apologised for his comments.[39]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 6 January 2017, Puri died at the age of 66, after having a heart attack at his residence in Andheri, Mumbai.[40][41][42] He was honoured at the 89th Academy Awards in memoriam segment for his contribution in world cinema.[43]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1975 Kalla Kalla Bachitko Chor Chor Chhupja 1976 Ghashiram Kotwall Ghashiram Marathi film 1977 Smothered Voices Bhumika Godhuli Yengta 1978 Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan Rajesh Bhookh Colonel 1979 Shaayad Nandlal Saanch Ko Aanch Nahin 1980 Sparsh Dubey Chann Pardesi Tulsi Punjabi film Bhavni Bhavai Maanav Bhagat Gujarati film Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai Madhu (mechanic) Aakrosh Lahanya Bhiku Won – Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor 1981 Hari Hondal Bargadar : Share Cropper Kalyug Bhavani Pandey Shodh Surendra 1982 Gandhi Nahari Disco Dancer David Brown Waqt-Waqt Ki Baat Raaste Pyar Ke Suldev Vijeta Arvind Naseeb Ni Balihari Gujarati film 1983 Gumnaam Hai Koi Chokh Jadunath Bengali film Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro Ahuja Arohan Hari Mondal Won – National Film Award for Best Actor Ardh Satya Anant Velankar Won – National Film Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Filmfare Award for Best Actor Mandi Ram Gopal Bekaraar Ashray 1984 Party Avinash Maati Maangey Khoon Durjan Singh Duniya Vasudev Shrant Raavan Samant Paar Ram Naresh Ram Ki Ganga Laalu / Lal Dandhwani Tarang Namdev Sheeshay Ka Ghar Giddh Bhashya 1985 Paththar Resham Singh Zamana Shyamlal Bahu Ki Awaaz Advocate Jaswant Srivastav Holi Principal Pandey Nasoor Dr Sunil Sanjhi Bhikhu Aghaat Trade Unionist Debshishu Poor Labourer 1986 Antaheen Genesis The weaver New Delhi Times Ajay Singh Long Da Lishkara Dittu Punjabi film 1987 Debshishu Mirch Masala Abu Mian Goraa Susman Ramulu Marte Dam Tak Daulat / D.K. 1988 Achanak Hum Farishte Nahin Gopi / Tala Master / Murlidhar Ek Hi Maqsad Dr. Ram Kumar Verma Puravrutham Raman Malayalam film 1989 Shagun Sava Ser Gehu Darshana Ilaaka Bheema (Raja's Foster Father) 1990 Sankranti Kayedi Halaat Ghayal ACP Joe D'Souza Nominated – Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor Disha Parshuram 'Pagal Parsa' Sarpat 1991 Irada Shanker Sam & Me Chetan Parikh English film Narsimha Suraj Narayan Singh 'Baapji' Meena Bazar Antarnaad 1992 Karm Yodha Sub-Inspector Patwardhan Raat Sharji Raatri Sharji Telugu film Current Velu City of Joy Hazari Pal English film Ankuram Parvez Hussain Telugu film Dharavi Rajkaran 1993 Aakanksha Maya Memsaab The Burning Season Rajiv Sharma Patang Mathura In Custody Deven 1994 Ankuram Satyam Wolf Dr. Vijay Alezias English film Drohkaal DCP Abhay Singh Purush Triyacharitra Billar 1995 Ek Ka Jawab Do Beparoa Zakhmi Sipahi Om Chaudhary Aatank Hi Aatank Sharad Joshi Brothers in Trouble Hussein Shah English film Target Rambharosa Tarpan Jassu Kartavya Ghulam Rasul 1996 PremGranth Baliram Krishna Minister Amar Prabhakar The Ghost and the Darkness Abdullah English film Maachis Sanatan Nominated – Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor Ghatak: Lethal Sachdev Ram Aur Shyam D.I.G.
