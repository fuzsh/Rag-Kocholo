        "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: ``They say that if psychiatry didn’t exist, filmmakers would have invented it,’’ said noted actor Mohan Agashe, here to attend the 14th International Film Festival of Kerala. The actor, who plays a role in ‘The Well’, directed by Umesh Kulkarni, was speaking about the connection between movies and psychiatry.\n\n‘The Well,’ which is part of the IFFK, tells the story of two boys and how the society is conditioning them with the do’s and don’ts.\n\nUmesh said his movie is an exploration of what actually freedom is, and one that tries to understand the life of an adolescent boy.\n\nThe film’s screenplay writer Gireesh Kulkarni said that narrating the story was not the only aim of the movie, but it was about creating an experience. ``It liberates one from the shackles of day-to-day life,’’ he said.\n\nSpanish film ‘Masangeles,’ by Beatriz Flores Silva, also has a psychiatric angle to it and takes the audience through the eyes of a small girl who lives in a kind of ‘neurotic society’, where each person has different needs.\n\n``Only the girl’s character is not neurotic,’’ said Beatriz. She said that the film works at two levels: the political and the neurotic or psychotic, which has allowed her to bring humour to some tragic events.\n\nAnother Indian movie maker Joydeep Ghosh, whose ‘Maya Bazaar’ is being featured in the IFFK, said that his movie tries to explore the alternative realities, ``where one switches between the real and the unreal. It is neither trying to establish the existence of God or ghosts or any supernatural elements, nor trying to deny it. The message that it gives is that the ultimate truth is death,’’ he said."
