        "text": "Ascension event as one of the most miraculous events of Islam history has attracted attention of scholars and artists over different ages and eras and has been manifested within many artistic works directly or symbolically. Meanwhile, painting art has paid special attention to this astonishing event either in conceptual or in aesthetic part. Many images have been created in Iranian painting with centrality of ascension (mi’raj) of Islam prophet. However produced works vary in terms of quality and narrations based on Iran painting style and affected by doctrinal conditions of its own time and viewpoint of proponents. In this respect t, famous and prominent painting of ascension from Safavid era of Khamsa version painted by Sultan Muhammad with unique and noticeable features. This paper aims to examine feature of Iranian painting art and visual components of art through descriptiveanalytical approach and with documentary method. For doing so, ascension image of Sultan Muhammad, famous...\n\nThe Pakistani artist Anwar Saeed is best known for his collages, colour-intensive paintings and works of different printing techniques which often explore masculinity and probe the controversial issue of same-sex desire in Muslim South Asia. He is therefore no stranger to self-censorship. Saeed has often had to alter his works so that they could be shown in Pakistan, and has generally learned to tell stories in order to survive. These stories had to be camouflaged, so the motif of the mask along with the complex othering of the self through the staging of animal-human relations entered his artistic iconography and came to play an important role in paintings, collages, drawings, prints and photographs. Many of these works suggest the artist's concern with conflict between religious and social expectations and gender roles, but they also make a connection with cultural and political identity formation in a country with a short, but very conflicted, history.\n\nA statement of the Problem: One of the richest sources of Iranian art is the miniature painting in which the use of beautiful and well-designed motifs are abundantly visible in the forms of geometric, abstract or naturalistic motifs. Such motifs can also be seen in different branches of this art, including illumination and Shepherd. The illustrated version of Jami’s Haft Awrang, illustrated in the 16th century A. D. and in Mashhad School, is one of the most famous and valuable manuscripts of the Safavid period. The harmonization of the traditions in Herat and Tabriz Schools during the Safavid period and combining it with native and regional features of Mashhad miniature painting has led to the creation of 28 beautiful paintings. This illustrated version has a number of illuminated decorations representing a rich collection of decorative motifs of the Safavid period. Research Objectives: The present study aimed at analyzing the illumination designs used in the images of the Haft Awrang and also examining their features such as form, color, place of application and the way these designs have been used. Methodology: Data collection has been conducted with reference to written sources and the obtained data has been examined using a descriptive-analytical method. Research questions: - What are the qualities of design and motifs in the images of Haft Awrang? - How is the use and method of illumination in the illustrated version of the Haft Awrang? Conclusion: The results obtained from the investigation of the images in Ibrahim Mirza’s Haft Awrang indicate that the illumination motifs used in Haft Awrang images, mostly include multi-petal flowers and Palmette flowers, and Khatayi designs as well as combined Khatayi and Arabesque designs have been most frequently used in the illumination patterns of this illustrated manuscript. Illumination designs have been depicted on the surfaces of buildings, tile works, minarets and domes, carpets and rugs, tents, and occasionally in humans’ clothing and animal coverlets. Also, these designs have played a significant role in promoting the decorative glory of the images and adjusting the composition of the paintings. The plurality of the designs and decorative motifs in this illustrated manuscript represents the decorative arts of the Safavid period and provides the virtuosos with a comprehensive collection of Iranian decorative motifs in one of the most flourishing periods in Iranian history of art.\n\nPhotography is a very broad communication style used in our society and it is a way of communicating as in visual style of expression to touch others in various ways. This is a process of creation, activity and art creating something for others to value and appreciate the captured image of photography. The Shari‘ah of Islam has not permitted creating pictures of living things or even taking pictures of them. The objectives of this research is to explore the ideation of Islamic geometric patterns and to be experimenting with the geometric Islamic patterns style into art photography. This study also examines the possibilities of creating art photographic influences with the geometric Islamic patterns. Experimental approach in terms of using adobe Photoshop was used to conduct the study. The photography images produce for this research is only scope on modern architecture. It is to understand the Islamic geometric pattern and implement its characteristic into photography to create symm..."
