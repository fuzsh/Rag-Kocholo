        "text": "December 22, 2018\n\nBoring as hell. IMO, the author needs to explore his feelings more deeply before he writes about them.\n\nFor example, the first chapter starts off with sadness, anger and resentment about Modi's winning. And then he starts reflecting on his victory. I found it absurd. You can't just talk about hatred and hope that I'll understand. You need to share with me why you hate a person, how were you personally affected, or what situations caused you to hate a person. Without that information it's all superficial talk.\n\nI also read the introduction and was put-off by the heaviness, the pessimism, the dreary doomsday-approaches attitude without any justifications or background for those feelings.\n\nApril 7, 2019\n\nSaeed Akhter Mirza is a filmmaker whose work I have admired and loved. I started reading the book not knowing what to expect. This is a book of recollections - memories jotted down in the form of small stories - but no coherent narrative or flow but interesting nevertheless. This was like a cross between Chomsky's Manufacturing consent and modern warfare and sounded like the rant of a cantankerous curmudgeon. I thought I had signed up for a memoir but I got a lit of disconnected opinionated articles on current affairs of the world (mostly). The book rambles in the second half and then abruptly ends. I got a free copy through Kindle's Reader's Delight.\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\nSaeed sa'ab is one of those who have witnesses the curious unfolding of 'history' of independent India. This book is a collection of brilliantly composed personal/collective narratives, opinions which put this history into a refreshing perspective. He has weaved his critical understanding of the contemporary issues with his masterful skills of storytelling. As a result, the essays are accessible to all kinds of interested readers. A must read for EVERYONE.\n\nDecember 24, 2018\n\nI don’t know how am I able to finish this book.. it’s boring without any understanding and thought process.. I bought this from Amazon based on reviews..\n\nDecember 18, 2018\n\nHere is a book that felt like a much needed relief. \"Memory in the age of Amnesia\" is about the times we live in. Published just a few months back, it talks about the major crises the world faced in recent times and how easily we've forgotten and dismissed them without understanding the reasons. It talks about Vietnam war, India's independence, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Gaddafi, Attack on 'Charlie Hebdo', ISIS, India-Pakistan conflict, Terror outfits in Afghanistan, Mumbai blasts....the list is long.\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza chooses to go to the roots of the problem. He gives the readers 'the other side', which is very different from the mainstream narrative. I can confidently say that after reading this book, I've become more aware of the problems around us. The driving forces that move the world have always gone unheard. Doing their deeds under covers. Mirza takes off these covers and shows us what lies beneath.\n\nIt is difficult to categorise this book. It is a collection of essays, soliloquies, reproduced interviews and the author's take on various issues. Every page satisfied my hunger and at the same time increased it. The point he makes in general is to remember. Remember what happened. Ask why it happened. Learn from it. He also makes it clear that the side of the story we get to hear is mostly of the powerful. The other side is more important and we must not ignore it.\n\nApril 6, 2019\n\n2.5 stars, rounded up.\n\nI wish this book was better edited!\n\nThere was so much worth reading here - Mirza takes a long meandering walk over important political events of the 20th and 21st century, that shaped his understanding of the world. There was a lot of fresh perspectives - that I either hadn't been aware of (Gaddafi's early work in Libya for example) or considered (how the myth of nations actually affect its citizen's decisions). He is opinionated and he expressed his opinions well, even when I didn't agree with his views (though for the most part, I did). His experience is vast, he is incredibly well travelled and it is clear that he has thought a lot about what world events mean.\n\nThat said, it is important to remember this is a \"personal history of our times\". In other words, the book doesn't necessarily explore all sides of an argument. It is his perspective. So I have a lot of googling ahead of me to uncover other perspectives on issues he discussed. But his recollections was an excellent introduction none the less.\n\nBUT.\n\nBut the structuring of this book drove me insane. There is no connection between chapters. Many thoughts are only half explored. Very often, I was left wondering what's the point of recounting a particular anecdote (for example his failed pitch to Dooradarshan). There is too little information on some counts and too much on others.\n\nIt was like sitting with my grandparents and hearing them talk of \"the old days\" - a jumble of memories, without structure or even real purpose. But when I sit opposite a grandparent, I can ask questions, draw them in to discussions about what interest me, or ask them to clarify their philosophies. I can't do any of that with a book.\n\nAnd that is why I think this book was a failure. I don't regret reading it (and yay for Amazon Prime's Reader's Delight program) - but this is a book I probably would not recommend buying.\n\nRead for the challenge prompts -\n\nPopSugar Reading Challenge - A book with no chapters/unusual chapter headings/unconventionally numbered chapters (The chapters are unnumbered and have unusual headings)\n\nAround the Year in 52 Books - A book with a (mostly) black cover\n\nJune 14, 2020\n\nRefreshingly interesting analytical and a not very biased read. A very happy reader, thanking the author for penning this book. May you produce many more such works, for the benefit of the ever forgetting public and the generation the comes after that in large.\n\nRefreshing, the author offers, an alternate to the mainstream news that is sponsored and offered to the public in general by the vested interests, mostly the un-elected business cartels through its usual machinery, the government. Interesting, sheds light on those forgotten stories, which are not in the mainstream domain. Analytical, critically questions one way flowing information which is neither balanced nor accurate coming the credentials of free independent speech. Not very biased, one cannot shed their inclinations, and there is nothing wrong about it.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nA concise overview making the case for economic equality.\n\nÂ\n\nI chose a 4 rating because the book was easy to read, and yet it covered a lot of ground. There is much to fix and a lot of work to be done, but sadly, communism has failed as an idea and people like Chomsky and Arundhati Roy have been either misunderstood, not understood at all, or have been understood too well and have been sidelined by the powers that be to keep from affecting their vested interests.\n\nJune 6, 2018\n\nMusings of a great Director from Bollywood. He has put forth his views on events that have, and are continuing occur, in India and the globe leading to disparities, inequalities and injustice. Provides a peek into the \"other side\".\n\nJanuary 5, 2019\n\nGood read - but very leftist view\n\nA good read showcasing Mirza's eruditeness and good writing style. The range of topics he covers is very wide and global. I don't necessarily agree with Saeed Mirza' marxist views - but he makes his points forcefully and with conviction.\n\nApril 1, 2020\n\nI like the way it is narrated. Aptly titled and got some good knowledge of the worldwide happenings which were indeed an eye opener. Food for thought it is as to how we are governed and letting ourselves being governed.\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nThis book is a conversation with Saeed Mirza, discussing various international events and life experiences."
