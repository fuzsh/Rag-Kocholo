Theater 4, Village East Cinema, 2nd Ave @ 12th street, NYC.\n\nSujata\n\nDirected by Bimal Roy\n\nFeature Narrative\n\nIndia 1959, 2hr 41min Hindi (w/English subtitles)\n\nCast: Nutan, Sunil Dutt, Shashikala, Lalita Pawar, Tarun Bose, Sulochana Latkar, Asit Kumar Sen\n\nThis is the 50th death anniversary of Bimal Roy.\n\nThis copy of Sujata was specially restored for the occasion.\n\nPost screening Q&A with the late director's grandson and filmmaker Aditya Bhattacharya\n\nSynopsis: As they celebrate the first birthday of their daughter Rama, men from a local village bring a baby girl to the home of government engineer Upendra and his wife Charu. The babyâs parents were âuntouchablesâ who died from cholera, leaving the girl an orphan with no one willing to take her in. Despite being of the higher Brahmin caste, Upendra and Charu reluctantly agree to take in the baby and eventually give her a name: Sujata. In a powerful portrayal and denunciation of the caste discrimination that destroyed so many lives, Roy tells a story about real people struggling with social expectations and bigotry and the feelings of love and compassion that bind us together. Showcasing memorable performances by Sunil Dutt and Nutan with haunting music by composer S.D. Burman, SUJATA premiered at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAbout the Director:\n\nRoy first assisted Nitin Bose in P.C.Barua's Devdas, then in 1935, turned cameraman with K.L.Saigal's Devdas. In 1944, Roy made his debut as director with the path-breaking Udayer Pathey (Towards Sunrise). Roy had shot the entire film with left over film-stock and an ensemble cast of newcomers. The film created box office history. It ran continuously for a year, and its dialogue-booklets were sold at every street-corner tobacconist. Bimal Roy had arrived. When Bollywood star, Ashok Kumar invited Roy to Bombay in 1951 to direct Maa for the famed Bombay Talkies studios, he readily accepted, and took his entire team with him. After the success of Maa, Roy received offers to direct three films in Bombay, Parineeta, Baap Beti and Biraj Bahu. Roy decided to settle in Bombay, and in 1953, launched his own company: Bimal Roy Productions. The first film from Royâs company was Do Bigha Zamin (Two Acres of Land). Sixty-three years later, it still features on every Top 10 list of the best Indian films. Roy went on to make a film every year, often with women as his protagonists. His films tackled crucial social issues: untouchability and the caste system in Sujata, village politics in Parakh, urban unemployment in Naukri, and prisoner rehabilitation in Bandini. Bimal Roy soon became a household name in India. Royâs populist approach perhaps hindered the global recognition he merits. In India, Roy remains a legend. Today, sequences from his films are used to teach film grammar at the Film and Television Institute of India - probably the highest accolade for an Indian filmmaker. A large number of Royâs cast and crew went on to become cinematic legends themselves. Sunday May 8, 3:30 pm.

And yet, one thing remains constant â a star who never ages on screen, providing an object of unchanging desire across generations of men reassured by his permanence.\n\nAbout the Director:\n\nRinku Kalsy studied Digital filmmaking in Amsterdam as well as attended various workshops at the Binger Institute Amsterdam.
