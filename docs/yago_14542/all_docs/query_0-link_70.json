        "text": "This article presents a discussion of key aspects of knowledge in Sufism through an analysis of the film Babâ€™Aziz: The Prince Who Contemplated His Soul (Nacer Khemir, 2005). The dominant Western perspective argues for the necessity of a rational, objective form of knowledge which is based on logical argument and precepts. This perspective, however, fails to recognize the alternative form of experiential knowledge which lies at the heart of the Sufi tradition. In this respect, Bab&#39;Aziz is an important film because its content and its narrative technique is an expression of certain knowledge, knowledge without doubt, and kashf, unveiling or discovery. This article compares knowledge in Sufism (Tasawwuf) to the concept of knowledge in the Western tradition, and argues for a reconsideration of the meaning of philosophy as understood by the Ancient Greeks.\n\nThis study aims at disclosing the practices of Islam in Indonesia framed in the films by Nurman Hakim, among them are 3 Doa 3 Cinta (3 Prayers 3 Love) (2008), Khalifah (2011), and Bid'ah Cinta (2017). These three films portray the religious reality of Islamic society in post-reform Indonesia. The permeation of transnational Islamic practices, especially those adopted from the Middle East, is believed to have the potential to become a radical Islam and threaten the existence of a cultural Islam that promotes tolerance and appreciates the existence of Indonesian culture. Through the production of Islamic-themed films, Nurman Hakim believes that film is a representation of society and its era. Therefore, the film depicts socio-political, cultural, ideological, and religious circumstances in society. This is where a filmmaker has a very important role in producing the film. In his conscious and subconscious mind, a filmmaker will bring out all that has been absorbed from his surroundings. The audience can read the religious views of a filmmaker through the created film products. Using the perspectives of cultural studies and critical multiculturalism, this study perceives that the creation of Nurman Hakim films is not only to maintain inclusive cultural Islam but also to ward off the exclusive and scriptural radical Islam in understanding the holy verses of the Qur'an and hadith. Nurman Hakim's films also become the antithesis of mainstream Islamic-themed films that referred to the success of the Ayat-Ayat Cinta of Love movie which had adopted Middle Eastern Islamic identity.\n\nThe Indian documentary film landscape is currently expanding with exceptional dynamism, despite the fact that structural problems such as insufficient funding and distribution mechanisms are still prevalent. The number of film festivals organized in this vein in the country has also increased, allowing documentary films and directors from India to gain a new global visibility, which in turn makes the industry increasingly interesting and relevant for academic discussion. In this article, I focus on three reflexive documentary films by Fathima Nizaruddin that could be considered a trilogy and in which the director has sought to deal with the different points of view of Muslim women on the questions of gender, identity and religion. I argue that a growing interest in these new articulations and critical reflections on the prevailing discourses and visual regimes about Muslim women is discernible in India and is likely to expand in the next couple of years."
