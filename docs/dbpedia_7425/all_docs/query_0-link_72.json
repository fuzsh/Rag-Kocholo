They possess a hardened blunt head strong enough to punch holes in hulls, and also feature the Hammerhead trademark; four scythe-like limbs, each of which can inflict very heavy Bleeding on any living creature, with 360º of reach. As its name implies, the Golden Hammerhead has gold-colored, somewhat shiny skin, and two motionless fins to act as stabilizers.\n\nIn-Game\n\nThe Golden Hammerhead will attack the Submarine in hit-and-run attacks, punching holes in the hull with its head and retreating to strike again. Lone Divers will be chased and mauled to death.\n\nGolden Hammerheads may spawn as a replacement for a Hammerhead, the chance of which depends on the game difficulty. Golden Hammerheads present a similar threat level to the common Hammerhead. In higher difficulties, Golden Hammerheads will spawn in couples, supported by three Hammerheads. This poses a significant threat to the submarine's hull integrity.\n\nThe Golden Hammerhead is the only creature in the game which has a mass of 202. If two of its limbs are severed, Sufforin will work on the creature as it applies to creatures with masses of 200 or lower.\n\nCombat Strategies\n\nDue to its heavy resistances, the Golden Hammerhead can be difficult to kill. The Pulse Laser is one of the most effective methods of neutralising this threat, as its Burn resistances are the weakest. Alternatively, the Railgun and Coilgun using Piercing Ammunition are viable alternatives if a Pulse Laser is unavailable, as the damage output of these weapons is still high despite the resistances. It is not recommended to use Physicorium Ammunition on the Golden Hammerhead, as it has incredibly high bleed resist (and is immune to bleeding in some areas).\n\nThe use of small arms weapons or melee weapons is not recommended. The damage output of weapons such as the SMG or Shotgun is nowhere near enough to be a viable option against the Golden Hammerhead. Additionally, utilising melee weapons is likely to result in a swift death of the diver involved.\n\nDespite being a \"tougher\" variant of Hammerhead, it will retreat from the submarine as soon as it take a single high enough damage from turret on its head unlike a normal Hammerhead, the only ammunition that cannot fend it off is Piercing Ammunition as a trade off for a quicker kill against it. This does not apply when it attacking a human directly however.\n\nAttacks\n\nAttack Target type Afflictions on hitAfflictions InsideArea of EffectStructure DamageItem DamageDurationCooldownKinetic Force Nose Attack 1 Character 0 0.25s 10 10 Nose Attack 2 Structure Stun 3s 4m 200 (Direct hit)\n\n100 (AoE) 75 0.25s 10 10 Claws Character 0 15 0.2s 3 60\n\nDefense\n\nLimb Burn Bleeding Damage (all) Head x 0.25 x 0.1 x 0.1 Tail, Fins, & Arms x 1 x 0.75 x 0.75 Claws x 0.5 x 0 x 0.5\n\nVariants\n\nGolden Hammerhead Golden Hammerhead bosses have 5 sight and 5 hearing.
