        "text": "In my painting scramble to get ready for HUZZAH! 2023, I painted a number of regiments, leaders and individuals for my Wars of Ozz games. You may have noticed several of them in my last post. Most of these projects involved regiments from the Great Land of Harvest. One of them was the Great Menacing Hammerheads, SKU#528. The unit is composed of 10 figures to be based each on 5 stands.\n\nThe photo of them on the Wars of Ozz website intrigued me:\n\nWhat exactly are these?\n\nThey are listed in the rules as part of forces available to the Great Land of Harvest. Still, againâ¦\n\nWhat exactly are these?\n\nThe rulebook is silent on this, except to suggest that these creatures may be one of many mutations that occurred after the Madness Bombs fell 300 years ago. I am by no means expert on the original Baum Wizard of Oz works that inspired the game. With a little digging on the old internet, I found a couple of clues. Apparently these do appear in the Oz books around the year 1900 â and are quite xenophobic and weird. There is an Oz Wiki site â and there I found this:\n\nâThey had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, âKEEP BACK!â âWho are you?â asked the Scarecrow. Then a face showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, âTHIS HILL IS OUR HILL, THE HILL OF US HAMMER-HEADS, AND WE DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO EVER CROSS IT!â âBut we must cross it,â said the Scarecrow. âWeâre going to the country of the Quadlings to see its ruler, Glinda the Good Witch, so we must.â âBUT YOU MUST NOT!â Replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the large rocks the strangest man the travelers had ever seen. He was quite short and stout, standing no more than three feet high and had a big, oversized head, which was smooth on the top and as flat as a hammer. The head was supported by a thick, long, fat neck full of many layers of wrinkles. But the body had no arms at all, not even stubs.ââThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900)\n\nfrom the Oz Wiki\n\nA little more digging found these images from the original books:\n\nIt appears that their attack mode is a whipping-extending forward-head-butting action. How they button their clothes, tie their shoes, or perform acts of personal hygiene are certainly left to the imaginationâ¦\n\nAnother site (The Creature Codex)shows an interesting artistâs concept of these as monsters as shown by the photo below:\n\nThese look more menacing and Ozz-like, but lack the âhammerheadsâ. As for why the Great Menacing Hammerheads (letâs call them the GMHH) are listed as part of the Great Land of Harvest forces, I am not 100% sure given the above. I can accept that given the previous quote and their alleged xenophobia, they probably would only fight alongside their nearest neighbor mutants? In any case, I happily bought them and proceeded to build and paint the regiment.\n\nSimilar to some other Great Land of Harvest regiments, the GMHH unit is comprised of 10 metal figures, and each is unarmed â save for their heads, which are different types of hammers. The figures are of different heights, and needed assembly insofar as each figure came in two pieces â a torso and a long neck/head combination. The figures reminded me a bit of malevolent sneetches â if Dr. Seuss had disarmed themâ¦(sorry for that)â¦\n\nLetâs move on to the figures shall we?\n\nI needed to assemble the unit and affix the two pieces. I decided to channel my inner Roger and use green stuff and sculpt a type of sneetch-inspired ruffled collar on them which would also serve as a bond for the models. I varied the heads so that no two bases would be the same. They are based in the game on five 2â³ square bases without a Regimental Commander. Their melee value is pretty strong at 7 out of 10. Their Elan and Resolve values are the same as the other Harvest units at 6 out of 10.\n\nI wanted them to look wild and crazy â and certainly as âmenacingâ as I could. Their varied head positions helped with this as did varied base flocking. Lastly, to match my other Harvest troops, I did paint the eyes with a glowing yellow-green (Tesseract Glow).\n\nAs before, Iâll share a few WIP shots and then some eye candy of the GMHH regiment. Iâll start with assembly of the figures and then move to describing the painting process. I used a number of contrast and speed paints, but did also use highlights and washes. All of the paints that I used will be listed at the end as I normally do for those interested in that level of detail.\n\nWIP Shotsâ¦\n\nI varnished these with a coat of gloss followed by one of matte. Then I flocked the bases with the same color themes as my other Harvest troops. How about someâ¦\n\nEye Candy\n\nStand 1\n\nStand 2\n\nStand 3\n\nStand 4\n\nStand 5\n\nGroup Shot\n\nPhotographing these was difficult due to the number of heads that were downward facing â such that illuminating them was tough â let alone catching their faces â but I think you get the idea of how they look in the group shot. From above their hammerheads resemble â well â actual hammers. And I think that is the point.\n\nI donât think they are the best I have done â but they are ok, and will be fine on the tabletop.\n\nThatâs all for the Great Menacing Hammerhead Infantry Regiment. I hope that you liked their wackiness as much as I did. This makes 128 figures that I have painted for Ozz this year! I do have three more posts in the queue and then I can get back to painting more stuff. The next one will be quite fungalâ¦\n\nThanks for taking a look and any feedback is always appreciated\n\nAnd yes, I still have more to comeâ¦\n\nMiscellaneous details and references for those interested in that sort of thing:\n\nFor all of my previous posts on Wars of Ozz games, figures, units, and other related projects â please see this page.\n\nPAINTS, INKS, GLAZES, SHADES, WASHES, PIGMENTS, FLOCKING, GLUES AND MORE THAT I USED ON THIS GREAT MENACING HAMMERHEAD INFANTRY REGIMENT:\n\nGreen Stuff (kneadatite)\n\nGorilla Glue\n\nPoster tack\n\nVallejo âFlow Improverâ\n\nVallejo âAirbrush Thinnerâ\n\nVallejo Premium Surface Primer âWhiteâ\n\nVallejo Mecha Surface Primer âWhiteâ\n\nArmy Painter Airbrush Primer âWhiteâ\n\nCitadel âTesseract Glowâ\n\nCitadel âContrast Paint â Baal Redâ\n\nBattlefront âBlackâ\n\nVallejo Model Color âWhiteâ\n\nArmy Painter âSpeed Paint â Forest Spriteâ\n\nCitadel âContrast Paint â Gore Grunta Furâ\n\nCitadel âContrast Paint â Contrast Mediumâ\n\nArmy Painter âSpeed Paint â Zealot Yellowâ\n\nVallejo Game Ink âYellowâ\n\nVallejo Model Air âGun Metalâ\n\nCitadel âRunefang Steelâ\n\nArmy Painter âSpeed Paint â Dark Woodâ\n\n2â³ square steel base from Wargames Accessories (#21)\n\nCitadel âNuln Oil GLOSSâ (wash/shade)\n\nPS Model Color âBritish Brown Drabâ\n\nDecoArt/Americana âHoney Brownâ\n\nCitadel âContrast Paint â Gryph-Hound Orangeâ\n\nP3 âBlazing Inkâ\n\nVallejo Model Air âChromeâ\n\nArmy Painter âLight Toneâ (wash/shade)\n\nVallejo Mecha Varnish âGloss Varnishâ\n\nVallejo Mecha Varnish âMatte Varnishâ\n\nElmerâs PVA Glue\n\nArmy Painter âBattlefields Grass Greenâ (flocking)\n\nArmy Painter âBattlefield Field Grassâ (flocking)\n\nArmy Painter âBattlefields Field Grassâ (flocking)\n\nArmy Painter âBattlefields Meadow Flowersâ (flocking)\n\nShadowâs Edge Miniatures â6mm Dark Forest Orange Tuftsâ (flocking)\n\nGamerâs Grass âOrange Flowersâ (flocking)\n\nSmall stones (flocking)\n\nSmall oak twigs (flocking)\n\nAgain, as you may want to check out the Wars of Ozz figuresâ range â there are two places to get them (and I make no money from this btw).
