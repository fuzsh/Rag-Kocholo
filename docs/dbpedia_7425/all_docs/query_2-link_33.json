        "text": "People joke about asking horses, “Why the long face?” We should redirect this question to hammerhead sharks. Their famous head extensions, called cephalofoils, can measure three feet from eye to eye. And scientists are still trying to nail down exactly what purposes they serve.\n\nA study published earlier this month in Scientific Reports explored how the sharks’ strangely shaped craniums affect how they swim. Although the cephalofoil helped with maneuverability, the researchers found, it did not seem to generate lift. In fact, it added a lot of drag — so much that some hammerheads may need to use roughly 10 times as much force as other sharks just to get through the water, said Glenn R. Parsons, a biological oceanographer and shark specialist at the University of Mississippi and one of the new paper’s authors.\n\nThere are some benefits to having a hammer for a head. Most experts agree that the widely-spaced eyes, nostrils and electroreceptors enabled by the cephalofoil’s shape allow the hunters to better pinpoint their prey. The heads can also serve as weapons — biologists have observed a female great hammerhead use her noggin to bludgeon a stingray."
