        "text": "Exploring the Hammerhead Shark Habitat Map\n\nWhen looking at the above Hammerhead Shark Habitat Map, take a minute to notice how closely they stay to land. It is very rare to find Hammerhead Sharks in the deep ocean, as they prefer to be in warm waters, on coastlines and continental shelves.\n\nHammerhead Sharks have uniquely shaped heads, which allows them to search for food much easier than other species of sharks. They have sensors in their heads that pick up electric pulses of living things. When they locate their prey, they use their heads as a sort of “hammer” to press them to the ocean floor.\n\nThink of a Great Hammerhead Shark as a “lone wolf”. It primarily hunts and lives on its own. In contrast, the Scalloped Hammerhead might live in schools of up to 100 others. These schools are often observed in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nWondering where are the best places to see Hammerhead Sharks in the wild?\n\nAs shown in the Hammerhead Shark Habitat Map, Hammerhead Sharks of different species can be observed in warm waters around the world. They are most commonly found in schools around the islands of Darwin and Wolf in the Galapagos.\n\nYou may also see them off the coast of Costa Rica at Cocos Island.\n\nMozambique, Maldives, Tahiti, the Bahamas, Japan and Malaysia are also popular places to see Hammerhead Sharks."
