        "text": "Today at reset, Destiny 2 rolls out another pair of “classic” returning weapons to be farmed through Into the Light’s Onslaught mode. One is beloved and has been dead since weapon sunsetting, the other is one of the best weapons in the game’s history, but its appearance is more controversial. That would be Hammerhead and Forbearance respectively.\n\nHammerhead is the Black Armory machine gun, one of two Destiny 2 Black Armory weapons returning for this event, the other being Blast Furnace. It arrives with some of the more insane roll combinations you can get on an MG. Forbearance, meanwhile, is the best ad-clearing special (or weapon period?) in the game, and some are upset that the raid weapon, still farmable, has been pulled for anyone to get. And with arguably better rolls. But what are those rolls? Let’s begin:\n\nHammerhead God Rolls (Void Machine Gun)\n\nRampage/Killing Tally – lol what. Yeah, two stacking damage perks, one temporary, one permanent, is quite the roll to shoot for, and this is easily what I am going to be looking for above all else. And remember these will be enhancable down the road too.\n\nFourth Time’s the Charm or Envious Assassin/Target Lock – Do you want ammo returned to you, or Envious to double your magazine to boost target lock damage as long as possible? I’d say the latter, but it’s your call.\n\nEnvious Assassin/Onslaught – No damage perks here perhaps but with that size of magazine you’ll be able to have Onslaught going brrrr for an extremely long time.\n\nRewind Rounds/Killing Tally – Rewind Rounds is good on essentially everything and it should extend the lifespan of Killing Tally once you get those rounds back.\n\nRampage/Desperate Measures – This probably is not Killing Tally but I am pretty sure this is the only place where you can combine Rampage and Rampage Plus, so it’s a potentially fun combo.\n\nForbearance God Rolls (Arc Wave Frame Grenade Launcher)\n\nDisruption Break/Chain Reaction – The old one couldn’t roll Disruption Break, but what’s better than clearing ads, popping a shield at the same time and then flipping to a Kinetic Primary (might I suggest this event’s Midnight Coup?) to get a damage boost?\n\nDemolitionist/Chain Reaction – Again, another new perk for it. Loads of energy back with mass mob clear, reload on grenade throw for…more mob clear. Excellent.\n\nAmbitious Assassin/Chain Reaction – You want the classic roll? Here’s the classic roll, and it will be able to be enhanced up to “Adept” level eventually.\n\nStats For All/One For—Sorry nevermind I can’t recommend a non-Chain Reaction roll in good faith.\n\nTwo monster weapons this week with so many good rolls. I cannot wait to get my hands on these and take The Witness to task in a month.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy.\n\nForbes Community Guidelines\n\nOur community is about connecting people through open and thoughtful conversations.
