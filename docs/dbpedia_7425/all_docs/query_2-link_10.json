        "text": "The great hammerhead shark's genus name, Sphyrna, is Greek for “hammer.”\n\nSize\n\nCommon length 12-18 feet (3.6-5.5 m)\n\nDiet\n\nRays and skates\n\nRange\n\nMost commonly found in shallow water\n\nHabitat\n\nWarm temperate and tropical seas worldwide\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nLargest species of hammerhead shark, with the most distinctly hammer-shaped head of this genus.\n\nColoration is dark grey-brown dorsally and lighter grey ventrally.\n\nThe body is broad and streamlined in shape with tall, curved dorsal fins, and a large, well-developed tail with distinct lobes.\n\nThe front of the head is nearly straight across and greatly elongated laterally with flattened lobes. Eyes and nostrils are located on the ends of the lobes.\n\nJuvenile shark has a more curved hammer.\n\nAs in many shark species, the female is larger than the male.\n\nThe common length for adult females is 15-18 feet (4.6-5.5 m); the common length for adult males is about 12 feet (3.6 m).\n\nCommon length at birth is about 1.6-2.3 feet (50-70 cm).\n\nMaximum length recorded was 20 feet (6.1 m).\n\nMaximum weight recorded was 991 pounds (449.5 kg).\n\nDiet / Feeding\n\nDiet consists primarily of stingrays, other rays and skates.\n\nMay also consume other sharks, including other hammerhead sharks, bony fish, including groupers and sea catfish, squid and bottom dwelling crustaceans.\n\nCommonly feeds by pinning prey down with hammer and biting pieces off.\n\nFeeding primarily occurs at dusk.\n\nAlthough stingrays appear to be a preferred prey, this species does not seem to be harmed by the venomous barbs. One shark was found with up to fifty broken stingray or catfish spines stuck in the jaws, throat and sides of the head.\n\nRange / Habitat\n\nOccurs in warm temperate and tropical seas worldwide.\n\nHighly migratory species. May be found in both inshore and offshore waters. Typically found over the continental shelf, near islands and reefs, and in lagoons.\n\nMost commonly found in shallow water at depths to 328 feet (100 m) but may occasionally be found at depths to 984 feet (300 m).\n\nReproduction & Growth\n\nViviparous species meaning the young is born live.\n\nCommon litter size of 13-42 pups.\n\nGestation period is about eleven months. Reproduces once every two years.\n\nBirths usually occur in late spring and summer\n\nSources\n\nwww.fishbase.org\n\nwww.iucnredlist.org\n\nwww.arkive.org\n\nwww.floridamuseum.ufl.edu\n\nGrzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia.
