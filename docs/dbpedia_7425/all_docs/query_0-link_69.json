Universe Donkey Kong Appears in SSB\n\nMelee\n\nBrawl\n\nSSB4\n\nUltimate Item class Duration/Battering Article on Super Mario Wiki Hammer\n\n“ A favourite of Mario's in his younger days, the Hammer enraptures any character that grabs it and sends them into a clobbering frenzy! ” —Super Smash Bros.'s instruction manual\n\nThe Hammer (ハンマー, Hammer) is a close-range item that appears in all Super Smash Bros. games. Upon being grabbed by any player, it sends them into a unique state that inflicts significant damage and knockback.\n\nOrigin[edit]\n\nThe hammer comes from the arcade game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, when Mario obtains the hammer, he is unable to stop swinging until the hammer disappears. He also is unable to jump or climb ladders while swinging the hammer. The hammer can be used to destroy barrels that are being rolled down towards Mario, and can be used against other enemies. Contrary to its depiction in the Super Smash Bros. series, the Hammer's head cannot fall off in the game, nor can it otherwise malfunction.\n\nThe hammer has since been absorbed into iconography of the Mario universe, with Mario himself using hammers on several occasions. Notable instances of Mario using a hammer is the Wrecking Crew series, Paper Mario series, Mario & Luigi series, several mini-games in the Mario Party series, and as an occasional item in the Mario Kart series.\n\nOverview[edit]\n\nUpon picking up the Hammer, characters enter a unique state for eight seconds; they will constantly swing the hammer back and forth, and will be unable to midair jump, use any other attacks, or defend. The Hammer also cannot be manually dropped unless the user has been sent into a state of tumbling. The Hammer deals about 22% per hit, and it also deals extremely high vertical knockback, potentially KOing opponents at low percentages; the effects of the Hammer are even more formidable in Super Smash Bros., where the Hammer instead does 30% damage with even more knockback. The Hammer can also \"chain\" into itself, doing 60% and likely KOing the opponent. The Hammer disappears after seven seconds.\n\nThe Hammer, however, limits the user's options, and particularly careful hitbox placement by other characters can potentially interrupt the wielder. Counters are especially powerful against Hammers since most of them deal more damage for any attack they counter. As the wielder of the hammer cannot use special moves or midair jump, sending an opponent off a ledge while they swing the Hammer can effectively KO them unless they can somehow drop the Hammer. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. 4, the Hammer also operates on a \"timer\"; if a character wielding the Hammer is constantly hit so that they cannot swing the item, the timer will still count down, potentially getting rid of the Hammer before they can properly use it.\n\nThe Hammer is also an item in Smash Tour: when its trophy is selected, the user starts the battle wielding a Hammer.\n\nHeadless Hammers[edit]\n\nStarting in Melee, there is a 12.5% chance (one out of eight) of the head of the Hammer falling off as it is picked up, after which the item becomes functionally useless, though the wielder will continue to swing the handle for as long as they would with a normal hammer. The Hammer Head itself can be picked up and thrown as a powerful item.\n\nIf the Hammer Head falls off, then the player is rewarded with the Headless Hammer bonus, worth 2500 points. This bonus only appears in Melee.\n\nDamage for Hammer Head[edit]\n\nThis article or section may require additional technical data.\n\nThe editor who added this tag elaborates: Needs Ultimate damage values.\n\nYou can discuss this issue on the talk page or this page to improve it.\n\nAction Melee Brawl SSB4 SSBU Throw 32% 32% 32% Dash attack throw 32% 34% 34% Up tilt throw 31% 31% 33% Forward tilt throw 32% 32% 32% down tilt throw 34% 34% 34% Forward smash throw 33% 35% 35% Up smash throw 28% 31% 36% Down smash throw 38% 38% 38% Air throw 32% 32% 32% Air up tilt throw 29% 31% 33% Air down tilt throw 34% 31% 34% Air forward smash throw 35% 32% 32% Air up smash throw 31% 31% 33% Air down smash throw 34% 31% 34%\n\nTrophies[edit]\n\nIn Super Smash Bros. Melee[edit]\n\nHammer\n\nIf you grab the Hammer, you'll run across the screen swinging it back and forth nonstop. In Donkey Kong, Mario used the Hammer in exactly the same fashion. It's an extremely powerful item, but you have no recovery move when carrying it. Every now and then, the mallet head will fall off, and you'll end up completely vulnerable, swinging just the handle.\n\nDonkey Kong (Arcade 1981)\n\nIn Super Smash Bros. Brawl[edit]\n\nHammer\n\nAn item that, once grabbed, makes you swing nonstop. It's a powerful attack item that does terrific damage and sends opponents sailing. Once in a great while, the hammer's head will fall off, leaving you nothing but the handle. Of course, you can't tell whether the head is securely fastened just by looking. Hammerheads that fall off can be picked up and thrown as weapons.\n\nAn item that, once grabbed, makes you swing non-stop.

Who needs special moves when you've got a hammer? And forget your second jump—use that time to deliver a second lump! Oh, but the hammerhead isn't attached very well, so watch out if it pops off or something...\n\n: Donkey Kong Classics (09/1988)\n\n: Mario vs. Donkey Kong (05/2004)\n\nThis is something you just can't stop swinging. At all. You'll do a lot of damage with it, but...you won't be able to jump in mid-air or use special moves, so if you fall off the stage, good luck getting back on! Oh, and if the head pops off, you'll be left waving the handle around. If that happens... man, you are going to look ridiculous.\n\n: Donkey Kong (10/1986)\n\n: Mario vs. Donkey Kong (11/2004)\n\nHammer Head\n\nA hammer is just a stick until you add the top. That's where this item comes into play. Sometimes, however, the top comes off. If that happens, just grab this loose part and throw it at your enemies. For some poetic justice, make the guy swinging the hammer handle your first target.\n\n: Super Smash Bros. Brawl (03/2008)\n\n: Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\n\nIf the head of a hammer should happen to fall off while someone's waving it around, don't let it go to waste! It's great for launching people, so pick it up and throw it at someone! How about that wally waving the hammer handle around? He's just asking for it!\n\n: Super Smash Bros.
