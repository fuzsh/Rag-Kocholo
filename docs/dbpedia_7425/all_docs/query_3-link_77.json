        "text": "An international team of scientists surprised the world by reporting that female hammerhead sharks can reproduce without males through parthenogenesis, or \"virgin birth\". It was previously believed that sharks reproduced only sexually.\n\nResearchers from Ireland and the United States performed genetic tests on a baby hammerhead born in an Omaha, Nebraska aquarium in 2001. The three occupants of the tank were all females who were captured as babies and had never been introduced to a male in captivity, which is what prompted the curiosity. The genetic tests proved that there was no \"DNA of male origin\" in the baby hammerhead.\n\nFemale sharks are able to store sperm for months, if not years, so there was some suspicion that the mother had mated prior to be taken into captivity, but the repeated DNA tests apparently ruled out this possibility.\n\nWhile useful at times, reproduction through parthenogenesis carries risks for the species, as it reduces the genetic diversity of offspring and makes them more prone to being wiped out by disease. Given this new data, scientists speculate that parthenogenesis occurs in sharks only rarely -- when male mates are hard to find.\n\nThe new discovery poses a dilemma: mammals are now the only major vertebrate group where parthenogenesis has not been observed. Are they (we) incapable, or have scientists just not looked?\n\nShark's virgin birth stuns scientists [Telegraph]\n\nNo, the Seine Cleanup Wasn’t a Failure\n\nThe goal of the Seine-cleansing project is to produce swimmable conditions for the people of Paris for years to come—the Olympics was just a milestone in getting there.\n\nTuariki Delamere’s Somersault Could Have Launched a New Era in the Olympic Long Jump\n\nThe New Zealander came up with a better way to jump, using a front flip in midair. But the sport’s stodgy authorities shut him down before the 1975 Games.\n\nAbortion Rights Groups Rush to Back Kamala Harris\n\nActivists believe that the vice president, who is already the leading voice for reproductive rights in the Biden administration, will champion their cause.\n\nThe Mysterious Discovery of ‘Dark Oxygen’ on the Ocean Floor\n\nResearchers believe they have discovered oxygen being produced 4,000 meters below the sea surface, and think polymetallic nodules—the sought-after bounty of deep-sea miners—could be the source.\n\nHow to Save Your Home From a Wildfire\n\nSmall improvements to the roof, siding, windows, and vents of your house can make a big difference when threatened by the risk of flames.\n\nThe New Gods of Weather Can Make Rain on Demand—or So They Want You to Believe\n\nIn a gold-trimmed command center on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, scientists are seeking to wring moisture from desert skies. But will all their extravagant cloud-seeding tech—planes that sprinkle nanomaterials, lasers that scramble the atmosphere—really work at scale?\n\nHow to Stop Wildfire Smoke Damaging Your Health\n\nSmoke from fires is linked to thousands of premature deaths every year, and is a growing health threat as widespread blazes becomes more common.\n\nHospitals Around the World Are Struggling in the Aftermath of the Great IT Meltdown\n\nDoctors find themselves without critical systems and diagnostic tools—and face the daunting reality that a full recovery could take days—after CrowdStrike’s botched deployment of a software update."
