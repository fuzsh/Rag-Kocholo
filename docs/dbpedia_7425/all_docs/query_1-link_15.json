        "text": "Hammerhead is a deadly crime lord, loan shark, enforcer, and a hitman but above all else, he desires the throne of New York’s underworld, fighting other gang heads for control over the city.\n\nMr. H\n\nBorn in Russia and raised in Italy, by a father now deceased, not much is known about Hammerhead’s early years except how he became the leading figure head of a major crime family within the Maggia confederation. While serving as a minor gunman for the Silvermane Maggia crime family, he was severely beaten and, his skull literally in fragments, left to die beneath a movie poster for “The Al Capone Mob.” Disfigured and delirious, he was discovered by disgraced surgeon Jonas Harrow, who, motivated by both humanitarian and experimental interests, replaced the gunman's skull and broken bones with a strong steel alloy, leaving his head broad and flattened. Upon his recovery, the gunman remembered nothing save his criminal ambitions, his mind still fixated upon the mobster poster. Rebuilding his own personality, he became a 1920s-style gangster called Hammerhead. His treatment was the earliest known instance of the criminal empowerment for which Harrow later became infamous.\n\nDetermined to ascend to the underworld's peak, Hammerhead, or Mr. H, was willing to work his way to the top, and he moved from one crime family to another as his fortunes waxed and waned. His ambition and viciousness soon earned him a deadly reputation, as informants and reporters alike died for getting too close to his employers’ interests. For a time he worked alongside the superhuman freelancer called Wade Wilson, later Deadpool, but little else is known of his early career.\n\nImpervious Skull\n\nPortions of Hammerhead’s skull and skeleton have been surgically replaced with a nearly unbreakable steel alloy, making him extremely resistant to physical injury; in particular, his head, flattened as a result of the procedure, is virtually impervious to physical damage.\n\nHe is an exceptional athlete and hand-to-hand combatant, although his favorite battle tactic is to simply charge his opponents headfirst. Although thought dim-witted by many, he possesses a keen criminal mind and is proficient in the use of most forms of firearms, especially machine guns. He customarily carries 1920s-style Thompson submachine guns and utilizes other accoutrements of that era. At times he uses special guns which fire non-lethal stun pellets instead of bullets.\n\nOn occasion he wears an exoskeleton that magnifies his strength at least tenfold and provides supplemental protection from injury and heat. His underlings use various advanced weapons as needed.\n\nDirect Competition\n\nBoth Wilson Fisk, AKA Kingpin, and Doctor Otto Octavius, AKA Doctor Octopus, are Hammerhead’s worst competition in his desire to lead the underworld in New York City. He goes to great lengths to remove his rivals and those who interrupt his carefully laid plans including that of Super Hero Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man.\n\nFamily Ties and Mobster Allies\n\nThough not much is known about Hammerhead’s father, Hammerhead’s only other blood relative is his sister, Antonia, whom, when he remembers her after a bout of amnesia, is diagnosed with cancer. Hammerhead tries to save her with the help of an Atlantean tablet which Curt Connors, AKA Lizard, uses to create a serum that transforms himself into his alter ego. But thanks to his long-time enemy Spider-Man who creates a viable serum, Antonia is saved. Hammerhead is also married though her identity is unknown.\n\nJonas Harrow, a disgraced surgeon, finds Hammerhead nearly beaten to death and replaces his bones and skull with a strong steel alloy, which not only saves his life, but hardens his desire to pursue his criminal ambitions.\n\nHammerhead is the head of a crime family belonging to the Maggia, a seedy organization that deals in illegal gambling and other more heinous activities. To strengthen his mob family, he has his underlings trained by the super-skilled Taskmaster and has the Tinkerer build a strength-magnifying skeleton that he wears to go up against other Super Villains in his way and Super Heroes like Spider-Man and Captain America.\n\nHe becomes allied with Lonnie Lincoln, AKA Tombstone, and Norman Osborn, AKA Green Goblin’s Sinister Twelve for a time as well as Dmitri Kravinoff, AKA Chameleon, and the mobster, Martin Li, AKA Mr. Negative. After Hammerhead suffers a near death experience, Mr. Negative restores his mind to an adamantium skeleton and as such, Hammerhead swears loyalty to him.\n\nRap Sheet\n\nIn recent years, Hammerhead ventured into loan shark territory, and among his clientele was wrestler Crusher Hogan; in a prophetic moment, Hammerhead was in the audience when Hogan was challenged by a masked youth soon to be known as Spider-Man. For years Hammerhead bided his time, and when the Maggia leader called the Top Man lost status after a clash with the Fantastic Four, he took control of the fallen gangster’s mob and spent months reshaping it. When the Kingpin of Crime, the Maggia’s greatest competitor, temporarily withdrew from New York, Hammerhead stepped into the power vacuum, as did Dr. Octopus. The pair’s gangs warred in the streets until Spider-Man intervened, defeating them both. Octopus and the members of both gangs were arrested, but Hammerhead fled the country.\n\nDuring his exile, Hammerhead built his fighting skills to their peak. Returning to the U.S., he and his remaining gang attacked Octopus, who fled to an advanced atomic processing plant he hoped to acquire. Despite Spider-Man’s interference, Hammerhead cornered Octopus near an atomic reactor, but when he charged Octopus, he struck the reactor instead. Spider-Man and Octopus fled, barely reaching safety before the reactor exploded and devastated the island, including Hammerhead's gang, the last survivors of the Top Man’s organization.\n\nThrough an unexplained space-time fluke, Hammerhead was not slain but rendered incorporeal, and he followed Octopus back to New York, briefly driving him to mental ruin. When not harassing Octopus, he materialized throughout New York and recruited new underlings, who were deeply impressed that not even an atomic explosion could end his efforts. Recovering, Octopus attempted to use a particle accelerator to eradicate Hammerhead, but this only played into Hammerhead’s hands, for the accelerator instead restored him to solidity. Hunted by Octopus and Spider-Man, he fled in a helicopter, which Octopus downed over the bay, but he emerged unscathed, although he allowed his enemies to believe him dead.\n\nHammerhead strengthened his new Maggia family with underlings trained by the super-skilled Taskmaster and hired the inventive Tinkerer to create a strength-magnifying exoskeleton. With the Kingpin back in power, Hammerhead sought to unite New York's Maggia families under his rule, but his summit was disrupted by Johnny Storm, AKA Human Torch, who was following a false lead in a murder investigation. Despite his exoskeleton, Hammerhead proved no match for the Torch, so Hammerhead fled.\n\nWhen the Kingpin’s interests again took him from New York, a new gang war broke out, much to the chagrin of Spider-Man and other crimefighters, but as Hammerhead planned his role, the Kingpin’s right-hand man, the Arranger, had him bombed at a restaurant. Hammerhead hungered for vengeance but withdrew when the Kingpin returned to stabilize the city.\n\nMonths later, when the lycanthropic Lobo Brothers challenged the Kingpin, the shape-shifting Chameleon, pursuing the underworld crown himself, allied with Hammerhead, who followed the former spy's lead in the fray. Predictably, Spider-Man opposed all comers, but when the smoke cleared, Hammerhead was one of New York’s top three crime lords. Unfortunately, he hired the infamous hitman Tombstone as his right hand, which proved his undoing; in what he fancied was a gesture of good will, Hammerhead hired Jason Macendale, AKA Hobgoblin, to assassinate Tombstone’s nemesis Robbie Robertson. But Tombstone had vowed that only he would slay Robertson, and when chance granted Tombstone superhuman power, he savagely beat Hammerhead, then lured Robertson into a trap. Spider-Man and other heroes intervened, enabling Hammerhead to escape, and he resumed sole rule of his organization when the Chameleon turned to other interests.\n\nWhen the Kingpin was temporarily toppled, both Hammerhead and Tombstone were among those who sought his Las Vegas interests, but the vigilantes Matt Murdock, AKA Daredevil, Jack Monroe, AKA Nomad, and Frank Castle, AKA Punisher, put an end to this venture. Soon afterward, Tombstone, aspiring to Maggia heights, once more beat up Hammerhead and had him ejected from New York. Mortified, Hammerhead went abroad and undermined the interests of the assassination mogul called the Foreigner, who recruited his ex-wife, famed mercenary Silver Sablinova, AKA Silver Sable, to aid him. Hammerhead got the better of Sable and, abandoning his imagined 1920s ethics, boasted that he would rape and kill her before his Maggia peers, but his twisted fantasies were punctured when Sable defeated him. Returning to the U.S., he regained his place among the Maggia leaders, which included, to his chagrin, Tombstone.\n\nHowever, when the long-absent crime lord Fortunato returned in alliance with the terrorists of Hydra, Hammerhead, incensed that such “Nazis” dared undermine New York, joined several other crime lords in a united front. They were nonetheless defeated, though the intervention of Daredevil and Ben Reilly, AKA Scarlet Spider (briefly acting as Spider-Man) disrupted Fortunato's coup. While Hydra regrouped, Hammerhead remained one of the few holdouts and formed an uneasy alliance with Spider-Man and new hero Todd Fields, AKA SHOC, against Hydra front man Crown. Dealing Crown a crippling blow, Hammerhead was content to lay low, apparently occupying himself with, among other things, marriage to an unidentified woman. However, the Kingpin, returning to his throne, had several crime lords, including Hammerhead, attacked and left for dead.\n\nBut the Kingpin had unknowingly done Hammerhead a favor, for the attack seemingly stirred long-buried memories of a sister, Antonia, whom he learned was dying of cancer. Frantic to make up for years of amnesia, Hammerhead sought an ancient Atlantean tablet whose secrets would heal Antonia. Forcing scientist Curt Connors into his service, Hammerhead acquired the tablet and, despite Spider-Man’s intervention, Connors created a serum that would bestow the desired power. However, when Connors attempted to drink the serum, Hammerhead's hireling Boomerang shattered the vial, prompting the scientist’s transformation into his reptilian alter ego, the Lizard. Eventually, all concerned converged at the hospital where Antonia lay, and when the Lizard recreated the serum, Hammerhead consumed it and achieved godlike power. In a moment of compassion, he restored Connors to his senses, but the transcendent experience so enraptured him that the power faded before he could cure Antonia. However, Spider-Man prepared a third dosage to treat her, and a grateful Hammerhead allowed himself to be arrested.\n\nNorman Osborn, AKA Green Goblin, recruited Hammerhead for his Sinister Twelve team to go up against Spider-Man, who had caused his downfall and imprisonment. When the Sinister Twelve went up against Spider-Man, he was aided by Felicia Hardy, AKA Black Cat, Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man, Daredevil, Hank Pym, the Fantastic Four. SHIELD assisted as well thanks to Mary Jane calling in the cavalry. The Super Heroes defeated the villains and they were all arrested."
