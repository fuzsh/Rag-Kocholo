In the blacksmith UI they refer to the weapon type of \"Hammer\", and all the weapons you create with it (different styles) are called a mace in the tool tip.\n\nBut I think that may be an error because I thought a mace was any type of club style weapon, so a hammer would be a type of mace?\n\nThat's correct.

Maces are what are in-game, hammers....are hammers."
