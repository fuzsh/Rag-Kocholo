She remains under close surveillance.\n\nHammer\n\nManoel was the youngest of three siblings by a large margin. Growing up, he was often called the “accident,” though his father would assure him that yes, he may have been an accident, but he was a happy one.\n\nWhen Manoel was twelve-years-old, and his siblings long gone from the home, his father gifted him a puppy – a Brazilian Mastiff, to name and care for.\n\nManoel named the puppy Hammer, and they did everything together. Wanting to be with Hammer for as long as possible, Manoel trained him as a working dog, and enrolled in the military with Hammer by his side. First, he was part of the Guard Battalion utilizing Hammer as a guard dog, and later, moved his way into the Brazil Special Operations where Hammer’s hunting and tracking skills became invaluable in chasing down targets.\n\nOne day, on a tracking mission, Hammer was killed in action by the SpecGru organization. Manoel took Hammer's name as his own callsign, and vowed revenge. He joined KorTac to do it and promised to never work with another K-9 unit, and to avenge his dog.\n\nDupe & Copy\n\nREDACTED\n\nNew Events\n\nKick off the first 4 weeks of Season 4 with the Critical Countdown Event before heading into several other Events scheduled throughout the Season, including some surprises along the way.\n\nCritical Countdown\n\nCollect DNA samples from fallen foes to earn rewards and uncover the truth behind the superweapon.\n\nMobile Suit Gundam Legends\n\nEmbrace the awesome power of Mobile Suits!
