        "text": "Some animals look so strange that you never forget their names. The shark with a flat head shaped like a hammer—the hammerhead shark—is certainly one of those strange looking animals! While many different kinds of sharks look pretty similar to other kinds of sharks, the hammerhead shark looks only like a hammerhead shark.\n\nPhysical Features\n\nWhat Size Are Hammerhead Sharks? The smallest species grows to about 3 feet (1 meter) in length. The largest species, called the great hammerhead, is thought to grow to 20 feet (6 meters) long.\n\nWhat Color Are Hammerhead Sharks? Hammerheads are light gray or brownish with white undersides.\n\nHow Many Different Kinds of Hammerhead Sharks Are There? There are 10 hammerhead shark species. All species have flat heads that are shaped like a hammer or a shovel.\n\nWhy Is Their Head Shaped Like That? No one knows why hammerhead sharks have such weirdly shaped heads. They have one eye and one nostril at each side of the head. Hammerhead sharks must swing their heads in order to see where they are going. However, they can see more at once than any other shark.\n\nInteractive\n\nBehavior\n\nWhat Do Hammerhead Sharks Eat? Hammerhead sharks eat fishes (including other sharks), squids, cuttlefish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Larger hammerheads eat stingrays.\n\nWhere Do Hammerhead Sharks Live? Hammerhead sharks live in tropical and temperate ocean waters. Hammerhead sharks are powerful swimmers. They swim from the surface to depths of about 900 feet (275 meters). They are found close to land, but some can be found in the middle of the ocean. Hammerheads normally swim alone, but females form schools at times.\n\nDo Hammerhead Sharks Release Eggs or Have Live Young? Hammerhead sharks have live young. Smaller species give birth to a few pups in a litter. The great hammerhead has several dozen pups in one litter.\n\nHammerheads and Humans Hammerhead sharks are not considered dangerous to humans, but they should be avoided. Many species of hammerheads have been overfished and are endangered.\n\nLearn More\n\nshark\n\nfish\n\nsquid\n\noctopus\n\ncrustacean\n\nstingray\n\nendangered species"
