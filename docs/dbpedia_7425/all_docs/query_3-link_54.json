        "text": "The bizarre appearance of hammerhead sharks has led generations of marine biologists to ponder the same question: why the wide face?\n\nPart of the answer may now be at hand. Eye tests on species caught off the coasts of Florida and Hawaii show that the wider the head the better the shark's binocular vision, and hence its perception of distance.\n\nThe fish are thought to have evolved their wide, wing-like skulls to enhance their sense of smell and ability to pick up electrical activity from other marine life, but the latest study is the first to investigate the role eyesight may have played.\n\n\"One of the things they say on TV shows is that hammerheads have better vision than other sharks, but no one had ever tested this,\" said Michelle McComb, a marine biologist at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nOf the nine species of hammerhead shark, the aptly named \"winghead\" has the most pronounced cranial features, with a skull as wide as half its body length. The more inconspicuous bonnethead shark has the most narrow skull of all hammerheads.\n\nThe scientists caught hammerheads and other shark species, such as lemon sharks and blacknose sharks, and transported them back to the laboratory for eye tests. During the examinations, a low-intensity light was swept horizontally and vertically across the eye of each shark, while electrodes picked up electrical activity from the fishes' retinas.\n\nThe researchers then worked out the size of the visual field for each eye in the different shark species. This revealed any blindspots, but also highlighted regions where the visual fields from each eye overlapped to produce binocular or 3D vision.\n\nThe eye tests showed that the bonnethead shark had a modest 13 degree overlap in the visual fields of its eyes, while the winghead had an enormous 48 degree overlap, giving it a much broader field of 3D vision. The study appears in the Journal of Experimental Biology.\n\n\"When we first started the project we didn't think that the hammerhead would have binocular vision at all,\" McComb said. \"We were out there to dispel the myth.\""
