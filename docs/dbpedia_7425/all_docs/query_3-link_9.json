        "text": "The Hammerhead is a safe-exclusive vehicle in Jailbreak. Modeled by MazeGFX.[1] It is obtained from the Police Safes. Being of legendary rarity, players have a 3% chance of getting it. Assuming that the player did not get the Hammerhead throughout the previous rolls, it will take about 1,155,000 within one server sitting.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe Hammerhead features a distinct wedge like shape in its front end in which it can flip cars by simply ramming into them. The Hammerhead features many geometric shapes with sharp angles, possibly resembling body armor put on to the car during an apocalypse. The back tires are also distinctly larger and thicker than the front, making it one of the few cars to have this feature in Jailbreak.\n\nThanks to its unique collision exclusive to vehicle interactions, the Hammerhead has the unique ability to act as a ramp. It can drive under static vehicles, making them go on top. Whether the Hammerhead is in motion or not, any vehicles driving head first into its ramp will be launched, all while the Hammerhead itself remains undaunted. This essentially creates a bulldozer effect and allows it to bypass roadblocks with ease.\n\nPerformance[]\n\nThe Hammerhead features great performance with a high top speed, great launch and acceleration. Additionally, it bears exceptional hill climbing abilities. However, it suffers from poor ground clearance that makes it struggle with more rigid terrain, which can be negated with higher suspension.\n\nThe Hammerhead also has a unique ability to go under vehicles due to its design, making it very hard for Police to stop, as they cannot roadblock it or pit maneuver it head on.\n\nOverall, the Hammerhead's performance is considered the best out of all safe-exclusive vehicles, so whether it is worth the gamble and money to obtain this vehicle heavily varies from player to player.\n\nStats Toggle details Top speed Excellent Reverse speed Great The Hammerhead has a top speed of 213 MPH, making it second fastest safe-exclusive vehicle, only behind The Venom. Comparable to the Firetruck. The Hammerhead's reverse speed caps at 66 MPH, which beats many other vehicles, but not considered outstanding. Launch Excellent Acceleration Excellent The Hammerhead has a speed burst of 62 MPH in one second. Making it slightly behind the Desert Crawler and faster than the Brulee. The Hammerhead has a good acceleration rate and can reach 200 mph in short periods of time. Comparable to the Shell Classic. Handling Incredible Off-roading Excellent Turning is on par with most supercars. The lack of collision against vehicles makes its movement unrestricted by other players. Given how close its front lip is to the ground, the Hammerhead has poor ground clearance, struggling to go over rigid surfaces like train tracks. However, the Hammerhead is also one of the best off-roaders in game and can easily scale slopes of any degree phenomenally. It can stick onto them without losing speed or traction much like the Torero. Braking Incredible Durability Excellent The Hammerhead can come to a full stop within 1.5 seconds. Comparable to the Beignet and Rattler. The Hammerhead possesses a high HP of 125 and a disable duration of 7.5 seconds. Additionally, occupants only receive 80% of the damage, comparable to the Striker.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Hammerhead was originally a grand prize submission for Season 20: Apocalypse. It also has the most upvotes out of all creations for that season.[2]\n\nAlthough there was a minigun on the Hammerhead's back displayed in the original submission, it was not shown anywhere on the vehicle in-game.\n\nYou can technically obtain the Hammerhead for free just by getting Police safes in Airdrop's Robbery Bonus Reward.\n\nMiscellaneous Trivia[]\n\nThe Hammerhead was inspired by the Ramp Buggy from GTA, [3] with highly notable changes such as extra coverings and a more futuristic vibe to it.[4]\n\nThe Hammerhead is the fourth vehicle to be presented in Safes, with the third one being the Laviolette, second being the Fiasco and the first being the Shell Classic.\n\nThe Model 3 is also available in the \"Street\" safe, but is not exclusive to it.\n\nThe Hammerhead can bounce a bit due to the high amount of triangles, especially at low FPS."
