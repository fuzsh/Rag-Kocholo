        "text": "Size/Age\n\nMaximum size about 12 feet. A slowly maturing species, females reach maturity around 15 years (8 feet) and males reach maturity at 10 years of age (6 feet) and are estimated to live up to 30 years.\n\nHabitat\n\nA circumglobal species found in coastal warm temperate and tropical seas. Commonly inhabits the continental and insular shelves of the Florida Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Known to enter estuarine habitats and nearshore areas, occasionally moving offshore in search of prey. Large, seasonal aggregations have been observed in the western Gulf of Mexico near the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nProhibited from recreational and commercial harvest in Florida state waters. In federal waters, scalloped hammerheads are taken in the commercial longline fishery mainly for their high-quality fins, hides, and meat. Considered to be dangerous and have been linked with many unprovoked bites on humans.\n\nState Record: This species is not currently eligible for a state record.\n\nRecreational Regulations\n\nImage Credit: Â© Diane Rome Peebles"
