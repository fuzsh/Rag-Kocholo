        "text": "Scalloped hammerhead sharks are moderately large sharks with a global distribution. The most distinguishing characteristic of this shark is its \"hammer-shaped\" head. They are threatened by commercial fishing, mainly for the shark fin trade. Two distinct population segments of the scalloped hammerhead shark are listed as endangered and two are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\nNOAA Fisheries is committed to conserving and protecting scalloped hammerhead sharks. Our scientists and partners use a variety of innovative techniques to study and protect this species.\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead shark can be found in coastal warm temperate and tropical seas worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean, the scalloped hammerhead range extends from the northeast coast of the United States (from New Jersey to Florida) to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic, it can be found from the Mediterranean to Namibia. Populations in the Indian Ocean are found in the following locations: South Africa and the Red Sea to Pakistan, India, and Myanmar, and in the western Pacific, the scalloped hammerhead can be found from Japan and China to New Caledonia, including throughout the Philippines, Indonesia, off Australia. Distribution in the eastern Pacific Ocean extends from the coast of southern California (U.S.), including the Gulf of California, to Ecuador and possibly Peru, and off waters of Hawaii (U.S.) and Tahiti.\n\nOn August 14, 2011, NOAA Fisheries received a petition from WildEarth Guardians and Friends of Animals to list the scalloped hammerhead shark as threatened or endangered under the ESA throughout its entire range, or as an alternative, to delineate the species into distinct population segments. On November 28, 2011, we published a notice that listing may be warranted. We published the proposed rule to list under the ESA and a status review of the species in April 2013. In July 2014, we listed four distinct population segments under the ESA."
