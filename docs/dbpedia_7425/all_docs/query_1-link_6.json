        "text": "Name Can be eaten by Image XP Description Barb All except for the stonefish who spawned it 0 Spawns behind a stonefish using their active ability. Deals damage upon eating it (7% of max life). Poisons anyone who eats it with a base DPS of 10% that lasts 5 seconds (except poison-immune animals). Despawns after 4 seconds. Bird Poop All except for lamprey and seagull 10 Affected by gravity. Automatically spawns below any seagull every 10 seconds. Plankton All 250 Spawns in the ocean. Ice All 250 Spawns in the arctic and deeeep. Volcano Food All except lamprey 125 Affected by gravity, floats upwards. (only in the first versions does the volcano food go upwards) Spawns out of volcanoes, which can be hidden in and are located in the arctic and the deeeep. When eaten as an animal that is not suited to the arctic, it will replenish some of your temperature. Person Tier 9 to tier 10 except sunfish and stonefish 300 Spawns just above the water. Does not spawn in the arctic. Flappy Duck Ray to tier 10 675 Spawns in a horizontal line just below the height limit. Meat All 1000 Spawns where an animal dies (tier 2 to tier 10 animals only). The amount of meat that spawns depends on what animal it was. Anglerfish Bait All Animals except for the Anglerfish who spawned it 0 Spawns infront of an Anglerfish when it is stationary (as its passive ability). No fixed look, resembles the last food the Anglerfish eats. It does nothing too, but the Anglerfish will deal twice as much damage (100x2, therefore 200) to the animal that ate it Name Summary Image Abandoned House Does not generate randomly, one abandoned house always appears in a specific location to the left of the deeeep floor. Tier 1 to tier 9 animals can hide here. Shipwreck One shipwreck always appears on one of the dirt islands that border the ocean and deeeep. Tier 1 to tier 7 animals(and hammerhead) can hide here. Produces bubbles that can be eaten. Shipwreck One shipwreck always appears on one of the dirt islands that border the ocean and deeeep. Tier 1 to tier 9 animals can hide here. Produces bubbles that can be eaten. Distinguishable from the shipwreck above by comparing the shape of the windows. Giant Shipwreck Generates in any biome. All animals can hide here. Hiding places are ship windows and the crack."
