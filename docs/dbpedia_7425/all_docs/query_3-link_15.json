        "text": "I love this set. We got it a week ago and my 4 year old loves the book and the tools he can use. We now tell him to find his cool and pick a tool when he gets very mad and he gladly does it. Hopefully it lasts and helps him to start school in a couple weeks. Highly recommend!!\n\nI haven’t been able to use the set yet, because I’m using it as a gift from baby to big brother when our second arrives, but I do want to brag on customer service! Our package actually got delivered to the wrong house and they claimed not to receive it. I sent an email to customer service thinking they would say maybe I should have paid for the insured shipping, but they replied within a couple of days and said the new package was already on the way to replace the other! It was so nice. I was devastated that I might not be able to give my oldest this set, and it arrived promptly within 2 days. It’s now ready to be gifted when little brother makes his arrival in August!\n\nWith a 5year old navigating all the emotions of starting school and making friends this set could not have come at a better time! The interactive book keeps him engaged throughout and the skills have been put into practice many times already. The different material to hammerhead is a nice change and he is so very much loved already!"
