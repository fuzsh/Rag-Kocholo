        "text": "Overview\n\nThe most common of the hammerhead sharks, scalloped hammerheads are a migratory species found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. They can be told apart from their close relatives by the ‘scalloped’ front edge of their hammer-shaped head (which is called the cephalofoil). The cephalofoil has evolved to improve vision and to provide a larger area for the electroreceptors that the sharks rely upon for hunting prey on or under the sediment.\n\nThe body is slender and is a brown-bronze colour on top and white below. The teeth are narrow backwards-facing triangles, perfect for seizing prey that they can eat whole rather than having to take bites out of larger prey. Their diet ranges from schooling fish such as sardines, herrings and mackerel, to stingrays, squid and even crustaceans.\n\nAs with all hammerhead species, they have viviparous reproduction, meaning that pups are nourished by a placental link to the mother much like mammals, and are born alive and fully functional. The gestation period lasts between 9-12 months and litter sizes can be large, ranging from 12-40 pups. Pups are born in shallow coastal areas and measure just 30-55 centimetres. Predation on pups by other sharks is high.\n\nThe Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) is one of the few places on Earth where scalloped hammerhead sharks can be seen gathering together in large schools of up to several hundred. The exact reason behind this schooling behaviour remains a mystery. In 2017, it was also found that scalloped hammerheads have nursery sites in the GMR.\n\nEvents Ocean protection\n\nUnderwater Wonders of Galapagos Webinar 2024\n\nShark scientist Dr Alex Hearn joined us on 19 June for a fascinating ocean webinar, revealing his latest findings on the health of marine life around Galapagos.\n\nRead more\n\nWildlife facts\n\nMeet the six Galapagos species you can adopt with GCT\n\nOne of the ways we encourage people to support the wildlife of Galapagos is through our species adoptions, which help fund several projects across the Archipelago.\n\nRead more\n\nOcean protection Overfishing\n\nSharks: Our ocean’s superheroes, not villains\n\nWhile sharks may appear scary to some, the majority of shark species pose no threat to humans, and we ignore their vital role in our marine ecosystems at our peril.\n\nRead more\n\nOcean protection Overfishing\n\nGalapagos marine reserve expansion brings hope - but new management challenges\n\nHighly productive waters support incredible marine biodiversity in Galapagos.
