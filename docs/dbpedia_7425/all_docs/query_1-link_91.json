        "text": "Q: What does \"random rolls\" mean?\n\nA: This item is capable of rolling with random perks when it drops. For example, every time you get a Better Devils from Shaxx, it has the potential to be a slightly different version than others before it — maybe better, maybe worse.\n\nQ: Why are there some perks inside of a dashed box and some outside?\n\nA: The dashed boxes contain the perks that Bungie's API says are possibilities in each column when the item drops.\n\nQ: What about the stuff outside of those boxes?\n\nA: The perks outside of the boxes are a fixed, \"curated\" roll from Bungie. Sometimes, that fixed version of the item will drop fully masterworked (see Nation of Beasts or Vouchsafe for examples). Other times, those perks are just for display, such as when you preview an item from your collection.\n\nQ: Do the two sets of perks ever cross over? Can I get a Vouchsafe with double Dragonfly?\n\nA: If the item is capable of randomly rolling one of its fixed-roll perks, it will be included in the random rolls section as well.\n\nQ: What does \"community average roll\" mean?\n\nA: Community Average Rolls are a way of \"crowdsourcing\" what the best roll is on each weapon. By scouring the global Destiny population using the Bungie API, we are able to see which perks a wide variety of players select for each weapon. Those stats are presented as the Community Average Roll.\n\nQ: What do you mean by the \"global Destiny population\"?\n\nA: As part of this feature, we are now tracking all active players using the Bungie API, not just those who have signed in on light.gg. The statistics displayed here are based on all players that have logged in over the past 2 weeks.\n\nQ: So this hits literally every player and every weapon they own?\n\nA: Yes and no. Every player should be seen by our scraper. The process will compute stats on items seen in the vault / inventory of players who have granted access to their \"non-equipped Inventory\". However, the default Bungie.net permissions only allow us to see the full details on weapons that are equipped by each player's characters.\n\nQ: Doesn't that skew the stats?\n\nA: Partially. Presumably if someone has the weapon equipped, they like it, which would mean that the perks equipped on it are perceived to be better. At the same time, most people are probably dismantling rolls that they think are bad, so even if we could see their whole inventory, we might not catch many \"dud\" rolls. Overall, the phenomenon of (mostly) only being able to see equipped rolls will reduce the overall number of rolls on less popular weapons, but the perks on those that are visible will likely trend toward being more popular, otherwise people wouldn't keep the roll, let alone equip it.\n\nQ: Why do percentages like 19% fill the whole bar?\n\nA: The bars for each percentage are relative to the most popular perk in that column. The most popular perk will fill its bar, and each perk under that will illustrate how popular it is relative to the most popular. So, if 22% of rolls use the most popular perk in a column and 11% of rolls use the least popular perk, the bar on the least popular perk should appear to be roughly half full. The intent of displaying it this way is to create better contrast between the options.\n\nQ: How do curated rolls factor into this?\n\nA: The usage stats are based only on randomly-rolled, legendary weapons.\n\nQ: Can you explain the letter ranks that are given based on these stats?\n\nA: Ranks range from F- to S+, based on how \"far\" your roll is from the community average roll. A roll with the least popular perk in each column should be ranked F-, and a roll with the most popular perk in each column should be ranked S+.\n\nQ: How can I help?\n\nA: The best way for everyone to help make this tool more accurate / complete is to update your Bungie.net privacy settings to allow API tools to view your non-equipped inventory. The more people that allow full access to their inventory, the more weapons we'll be able to detect, and the more comprehensive the statistics that fall out of that will be.\n\nQ: What do you mean by \"sunsetting\"?\n\nA: Bungie has announced that beginning in Season 12, weapons will have a cap on the power to which you are able to infuse them. We're calling this process \"sunsetting\".\n\nQ: How often does this happen?\n\nA: There will be one large sunset beginning in Season 12, in which all* legendary weapons and armor from Seasons 1-8 will be retired. After that, weapons and armor will essentially be sunset 1 year after their release.\n\nQ: Are there any exceptions?\n\nA: Yes. Bungie has stated that exotics will not sunset. Beyond that, gear from the Last Wish and Garden of Salvation raids will play by different rules than standard armor and weapons, though Bungie has not been fully clear on what those rules will be.\n\nQ: So I can never use my Mountaintop / Luna's Howl / etc again?\n\nA: Not exactly. This change essentially only matters in activities where power matters, such as raids, Nightfalls, Trials, etc. In most open world activities and standard Crucible playlists, you will still be able to use whatever armor/weapons you want.\n\nFurthermore, Bungie has also hinted that they intend to \"re-issue\" certain weapons/armor in the future, thus giving them another 12 months in the sun.\n\nYou can read the explanation directly from Bungie here.\n\nQ: What are masterwork rolls?\n\nA: Most legendary weapons are capable of being Masterworked. The masterwork system is a way for you to upgrade your favorite weapons to their maximum potential.\n\nQ: What does it take to upgrade a weapon to a masterwork?\n\nA: Upgrading your weapons, in broad terms, takes a small amount of glimmer, legendary shards, and, most importantly, Enhancement Cores. Depending on what Tier your weapon is at, the requirements to raise it to the next tier increase the closer the weapon is to being fully masterworked (Tier 10).\n\nQ: What benefits do I get for masterworking a weapon?\n\nA: Each tier that you increase your weapon will grant a small buff to a single stat, chosen randomly when the item drops. Beyond that, at Tier 5 you gain access to a kill tracker. At Tier 10, your multi-kills will generate orbs of light.\n\nQ: So what are these \"masterwork roll\" stats?\n\nA: These are the possible stats that upgrading your weapon will grant a bonus to. Depending on what tier you are at, you can grant anywhere from 1-10 additional points in any of the stats listed to your weapon.\n\nQ: Any catch with this?\n\nA: The Bungie API currently says that all weapons can potentially roll with all stats as their masterwork stat. This obviously isn't accurate, as Blast Radius isn't applicable to, say, Auto Rifles. The list you see on this page is trimmed to only show stats that actually appear on the weapon. However, it is possible that Bungie has additional logic behind the scenes that further filters these possibilities to, for example, prevent certain items from being able to have an Impact masterwork. Until Bungie modifies the API files to 100% accurately display which masterwork stats are possible on each item, take what you see here with a pinch of salt."
