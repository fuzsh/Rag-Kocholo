        "text": "For the record, I will never pre-maturely post a review of a ball that I haven't thrown across a variety of patterns and houses. I have now had this ball for about 3 months regardless of whether I'm bowling on something easy or tough, I always find myself at one point or the other trying this ball since I have seen so much success with it in my hands.\n\nOn the house conditions, i feel that this ball gives me more down lane ball motion that I've ever seen on a ball, while on heavier volume conditions, the motion is very slow, smooth, and controllable as long as the pattern distance isn't too short.\n\nOf every 7 Brands ball that I have thrown in my life, this is 100% my favorite reactive resin bowling ball I have put my hand into, and is on pace to be one of my favorite reactive resin balls of all time!\n\nLeague night, house shot, about 5 of us all got the ball freshly drilled same day. A lot of the straight-up-the 13 bowlers struggled with the ball coming back. I am a 2-hander and played 22-17 out to about 12 at the break with this one and shot a 242 first game. Ended up with a 628 series throwing all 3 games with this one. I only had to move about 2-3 boards which was really nice.\n\nAfter about 3 nights with this ball, I ended up having to move nearly 6 boards in as the ball was having a lot more trouble turning in friction. Eventually, after a good 30+ games on it, I was throwing it straight up the 12 board. The ball REALLY became saturated quickly and I was having to play it \"skinny\".\n\nThis ball kind of went on the shelf until I took it to a shop to \"sweat it\". It took a TON of time to get the oil out. We sanded it down and brought it back to factory finish and the ball is back to that superb shape.\n\nThose colors REALLY look good on that ball as it shows off your revs nicely. You can really see how this ball reads. Keep in mind, it's thirsty and drinks up that oil fast. My best series with this one ended up being a 668 (about 25 above my avg) on Helium pattern. It is often my first ball out on league nights and is one of the few balls I can roll all 3 games with with minimal adjustment."
