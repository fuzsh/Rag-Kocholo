        "text": "A Distinctive Hammer Head Shape\n\nThe distinctive ‘hammer-head’ part of the shark is called a cephalofoil and serves many purposes including giving them superior depth perception and binocular vision, aiding hammerheads in navigation and finding food. Hammerheads will use their head to ram and pin down prey, tiring them out and making them easier to eat.\n\nIncredible Vision\n\nHammerheads have incredible vision and depth perception. The position of one eye at each end of their head allows them to see everything around them all the time. This adaption does also come with a blind spot, right in front of their nose, and divers have observed small fish hiding right in front of a hammerhead’s nose!\n\nHammerhead Sharks and Sun Tanning\n\nHammerheads love to hang out in shallow waters and as a result, some species have actually developed the ability to tan! Their skin turns from light gray to dark gray, and the best thing about it is they are at no risk of skin cancer. Further study of how they can tan without getting cancer may be critical in uncovering how to prevent and treat melanoma in humans.\n\nReproduction\n\nBaby hammerheads are called pups, and a female will be pregnant for eight to ten months before having up to 50 pups at once. One of the most bizarre hammerhead shark facts is that the females can create offspring by fertilizing her own eggs without a male. This is called parthenogenesis.\n\nGroup Migration\n\nHammerheads love to travel in groups. At night, they will often split up into smaller groups or go solo.\n\nWhere and When can we see Hammerhead Sharks in Indonesia\n\nWhile hammerhead sharks roam all around the Indonesian archipelago, they tend to stay in the depth and sightings are pretty rare… except in a few spots and in a specific time of the year!\n\nEvery year, from October to November, large groups of hammerhead sharks are migrating in the Banda Sea. During this period, some liveaboards organize crossing trips in the region. That is when we have the best chance to observe hammerheads in groups. A truly unique experience!"
