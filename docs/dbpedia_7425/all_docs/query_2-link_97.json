        "text": "Hammerhead sharks dont live in a lot of places. They stay in warm waters, mostly tropical Seas (Hammerhead 1148). They usually stay deeper in the water. Sometimes one or two sharks wander into different places during the summer (Hammerhead 1148). These are the few places where hammerheads live.\n\nHammerheads look different from other sharks. They have flattened heads. Their eyes and nostrils are on the sides of its head (Hammerhead 1148). Their bodies are perfect for swimming. They have a large tail and a wide snout (Stonehouse 4). Their skeletons are made of gristle, which is not quite bone and is more flexible (Hammerhead 1148). A large fin comes up from its back. It has two fins right behind its gills, and its skin is very rough (Stonehouse 7).\n\nHammerhead sharks are great hunters. What makes them such great hunters are their senses. Hammerhead sharks can feel movement in the water a half a mile away and can taste blood as small as one part in one million (Stonehouse 10). Hammerheads under ten feet long usually eat crabs and small fish from the sea bed (Hammerhead 1148). Larger hammerheads eat fish such as bass, skate, small sharks, and sting rays (Hammerhead 1148).\n\nThere is not a lot known about a hammerheads life. We know that there are 5 kinds of them. These sharks give birth to live young (Hammerhead 1148). They belong to a special species of fish called Elasmobranches (Stonehouse 16). Thats what we know about hammerhead sharks."
