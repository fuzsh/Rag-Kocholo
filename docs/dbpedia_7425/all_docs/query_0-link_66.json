        "text": "Optimize Your Ride With Data Made Beautiful\n\nWe translate in-ride data into beautiful visualizations for real-time optimization.\n\nSee The Road Ahead With Best-In-Class Navigation\n\nCycling-specific navigation designed to help you never miss a turn.

What a great unit! I have had two different units over the years, Garmin & WAHOO Roam. The Karoo 2 is far superior in my opinion. And to top that off the customer service is on a much higher level than anything I have experienced. I would highly recommend this bike computer!\n\nI Love My Karoo 2\n\nThis is my first cycling computer and I love it. It was very easy to learn how to use and setup. I love the simplicity of the user interface on both the device as well as the Hammerhead dashboard. Highly recommend the Hammerhead Karoo 2. I'm absolutely obsessed with the Karoo 2 and it has made me even more motivated and excited to get out and ride more! 10/10. 5 Stars, zero issues or complaints. I can't wait to see where the future updates will take us because I know it's only going to get better and keep improving!\n\nBest Cycling Computer Out There\n\nI owned another brand of computer but HAD to move to Karoo 2 after seeing what was capable of and the number of features available, specially the climbing/mountain features and information it gives you to prepare for what's coming! It is clear and delivers what you really need at the right time. I live in Asia so trying to get it here was a struggle and took some time, it would be great if they were shipping to this area, as I'm sure there will be a lot of customers. I'm very happy with the computer and periodically updates that make it just even better! Congrats and great job to the design and engineers of the team!"
