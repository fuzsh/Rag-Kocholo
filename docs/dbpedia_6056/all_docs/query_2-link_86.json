        "text": "Colleen Hoover's hugely popular romance novel \"It Ends with Us\" is headed to the big screen, and the first look has arrived.\n\nSony Pictures on Thursday debuted the trailer for \"It Ends With Us,\" the film adaptation of Hoover's best-selling novel. Blake Lively stars in the lead role as Lily Bloom, a woman who falls for neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Justin Baldoni.\n\n\"As the two fall deeply in love, Lily begins to see sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents' relationship,\" the studio's plot synopsis explains. \"When Lily's first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), suddenly reenters her life, her relationship with Ryle is upended, and Lily realizes she must learn to rely on her own strength to make an impossible choice for her future.\"\n\nThe trailer depicts Lily's initial meeting with Ryle in a flower shop and their subsequent steamy romance, which takes a turn after he becomes violent with her.\n\n\"We all have an idea of what love can be: That special connection you feel, that first kiss,\" Lively's Lily says. \"But 15 seconds, that's all it takes to completely change everything.\"\n\nThe trailer then shows Lily reconnecting with Atlas, transitioning into flashbacks of their relationship, and concludes with her speaking about breaking patterns of abuse.\n\nThe footage was accompanied by the Taylor Swift song \"My Tears Ricochet\" from her 2020 album \"Folklore.\" Lively and Swift are known to be good friends, and Swift even mentioned the names of her children James, Inez and Betty on the same album.\n\nIn addition to starring as Ryle, Baldoni directed \"It Ends with Us,\" which also stars Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. The film hits theaters on Aug. 9.\n\nWatch the 'It Ends with Us' trailer\n\n'It Ends with Us' author Colleen Hoover is the queen of best sellers. Why is she so popular?\n\n'It Ends with Us' based on Colleen Hoover novel\n\n\"It Ends with Us\" sold more than 4 million copies as of 2022, though it has received criticism from some who argue the book romanticizes abuse. A sequel, \"It Starts with Us,\" was published in 2022 and sold over 800,000 copies on its first day.\n\nThe 2016 book was inspired by Hoover's mother and her experiences in an abusive relationship with the author's father.\n\nIn 2023, Hoover shared news of the movie adaptation's cast on TikTok, calling Lively her \"dream Lily\" and saying that she and Baldoni \"have what it takes to bring these characters to life.\" She also described the film's script as \"amazing,\" adding, \"I know y'all are going to be happy.\"\n\n'It Ends with Us' author Colleen Hoover is the queen of best sellers. Why is she so popular?\n\nSpeaking to the \"Today\" show in 2023, Hoover said it's \"bittersweet\" that \"It Ends with Us\" had remained on the New York Times' best-seller list for so long because its themes of domestic abuse resonate with so many people.\n\n\"It's been very heartwarming to read how much the book has helped people, and that my mother's story has actually given strength to other women to be able to leave their situations,\" she told \"Today.\" \"It's a wonderful thing that Iâ€™m excited to see on the screen. I also hope that it has the same effect that the book has had.\"\n\nContributing: Mary Cadden, USA TODAY"
