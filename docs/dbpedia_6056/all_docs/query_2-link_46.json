        "text": "7A WF 83429\n\nAs the White House reels from the kidnapping of Zoey (recurring guest star Elisabeth Moss), the youngest daughter of Democratic U.S. President Josiah Edward Bartlet (series star Martin Sheen), the government is temporarily passed from the distraught Bartlet to the Republican party--specifically Speaker of the House Glenallen Walken (recurring guest star John Goodman - \"Roseanne,\" \"Barton Fink\")--due to the prior resignation of Bartlet's Vice President. First Lady Dr. Abigail \"Abbey\" Bartlet (series star Stockard Channing) staunchly supports her husband, but the trauma of potentially losing their child forces her to confront Bartlet with the harrowing notion that the crisis was the direct result of the assassination of a dangerous foreign official he ordered months ago. As always, professorial Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (series star John Spencer) serves as Bartlet's political and emotional buttress. Ever present is highly regarded Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (series star Bradley Whirford), whose capable assistant, Donna Moss (series star Janel Moloney), keeps him grounded. Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (series star Allison Janney) remains cool and competent in the media briefing room, and rumpled Communications Director Toby Ziegler (series star Richard Schiff), focuses on the emergency, even as he quietly celebrates the birth of his twins.\n\nJefferson Lives\n\nFollowing a harrowing chapter in the nation's history, the White House celebrates the Fourth of July. Bartlet endures the painful process of nominating a candidate for vice president. But his first choice, Secretary of State Lewis Berryhill (recurring guest star William Devane - \"Knots Landing\"), will have a difficult time getting approved. Meanwhile, while the reclusive First Lady tends to personal matters, Amy (recurring guest star Mary-Louise Parker - \"Fried Green Tomatoes\") champions Abbey's violence prevention provisions for an upcoming bill. Josh and Amy share a romantic moment. And Donna is appalled by a new intern, Ryan (recurring guest star Jesse Bradford).\n\nThe Supremes\n\nWhen a Republican Supreme Court justice suddenly dies, the Bartlet administration scrambles to find a worthy replacement, and the halls are filled with candidates. But the President senses that the process is a political minefield until Josh devises a wild plan that could also create an opening for Evelyn Baker Lang (Emmy and Tony Award winner Glenn Close - \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Air Force One\"), a liberal who would be an unthinkable choice. Potential judicial nominees visit the West Wing offices and are interviewed--some serving only as decoys to confuse the press. But everyone gets curious when the President meets with Christopher Mulready (William Fichtner - \"The Perfect Storm\"), a bright but conservative judge."
