        "text": "Who are your top three musical inspirations and why?\n\nTobias Jesso Jr - my first time as a teenager listening to something none of my friends knew about. I felt like a badass. Something about the sound of the piano on all the songs and the storytelling got me. Years later I'm still obsessed with his debut and only album. (And still trying desperately to be a hipster.)\n\nAlabama shakes - Brittany Howard's voice has always managed to stop me in my tracks. She is an unbelievable musician and guitarist, and when I'm walking down the road with them playing, I strut with confidence.\n\nAretha Franklin - I've always been obsessed with her music, to the point I did an entire project on her at music college. She really went through it and still kept her head. Even though it was the early 60s, the music industry still messed her about about but she went on to make some of the best songs I've ever heard in my life.\n\nIs there a certain film that inspires you and why?\n\nPaddington. I fucking love that little bear. He made it all the way from Peru to London eating only marmalade sandwiches. I watch it whenever I am sad or poorly and it makes me so happy. Beside, if he can survive in London then so can I.\n\nWhat city do you find the most inspiring and why?\n\nI like Liverpool a lot. Every time I go I have such a good time, and it reminds me a lot of Dublin which is also one of my favourite cities. The people are warm and funny, and really care about live music too. Last time I went it was hard to find somewhere without a band playing which I like a lot. Also it has a beach which as I grew up in Brighton, is a must have.\n\nWho is the most inspiring person to you and why?\n\nProbably my friend Julia. We grew up together in Brighton and have all been best friends ever since. Although we did used to get up to a lot of mischief, she's a mental health nurse which makes sense as she's done a lot of looking after me, and still does. I reckon she has one of the hardest jobs in the world. But despite the fact she doesn't get paid enough or treated properly, she still makes me laugh like no one else. Fingers crossed she doesn't read this as she'll call me a soppy bitch.\n\nWhat were your inspirations when writing your new track?\n\nI think being angry was a big inspiration. I hate to admit it but being in a shit place mentally was actually very motivating. I wrote it when I was feeling stuck and lost, and didn't know whether I should give up or keep going - something I know most of my mates have gone through in the last few years. So it was a way of me trying to figure that out - like a tiny pros and cons list so I could actually imagine how leaving would feel. It was my musical glow up if you like. Like any post heart break moment, I wanted it to be sexier and more glam than ever before."
