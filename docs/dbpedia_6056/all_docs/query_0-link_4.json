        "text": "At least once every year - but never at the same time each year - there suddenly opens in New York a flock of films that are either truly offbeat, not easily categorizable, or apparently seem that way to their distributors who, clearly, haven't known what to make of them. Quality has nothing to do with it. Some of them are very, very good, some dreadful and some of the mixed-up kind that drives the sanest of reviewers into incoherence.\n\nThe last several weeks have been such a period, brought on by I don't know what, perhaps by the failure of a number of films that were expected to receive longer runs than they did; or maybe it has something to do with the effects of the wayward jetstream. However, as far as movies are concerned, we are certainly not in a drought emergency.\n\nTwo of the best, most readily appreciated of these what's-it movies are Horton Foote's Texas elegy, ''1918,'' and an uncredited, updated remake of Ferenc Molnar's romantic farce, ''The Guardsman,'' starring Christopher Plummer, Maggie Smith and Adolph Green, and titled rather wanly, in view of the exuberant performances, ''Lily in Love.''\n\n''1918,'' made independently away from the Hollywood establishment, is a leisurely, almost halcyon film about love, death and the resurrection of the spirit in a small Texas town in the months just before and just after the end of the World War I. Though it was directed - with what sometimes looks to be undue circumspection - by Ken Harrison, the film's true auteur is certainly Mr. Foote, the winner of Oscars for his screenplays for ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' and ''Tender Mercies.''\n\n''1918'' is nothing if not a writer's film, which is what gives it its particular resonance. This is evident from the unashamedly sweet opening credits, in which we see tinted postcards of the period and hear on the soundtrack Willie Nelson and Robert Duvall singing ''Keep the Home Fires Burning,'' through the rest of the film, which takes on the unhurried pace of the lives it's depicting.\n\n''1918'' doesn't rush from one melodramatic incident to another. It doesn't fret about keeping the audience's attention by artificial means - it trusts the instinct that tells the writer, ''If this interests me, it should interest other people.'' Not everybody, perhaps, but to attempt to please everybody is to court the kind of madness that, in Hollywood, passes for sanity.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
