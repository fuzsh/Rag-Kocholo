        "text": "Lily Rose Hampton is one of the main characters in So Awkward, portrayed by Cleo Demetriou. She is best known for her over-competitive and bossy nature. She is currently studying drama at Burke Hill University.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLily is bossy and overly-competitive. She likes to act as the leader of her friends and gives out orders. She is stubborn and does not like it when things are not done in the way she wants. When something is not done to her satisfaction, she will get into a mad rage; something she is famous for. Lily wants more than anything to look sophisticated and mature, which she does not succeed at, due to her brash and confident front that she tries so hard to portray.\n\nIn the first few series, Lily was hugely socially awkward, especially around boys. She had an obvious crush on Matt and could barely speak to him. After Matt leaves and Lily begins her relationship with Rob, her awkward personality seems to mellow out.\n\nLily has very high aspirations and is determined to reach them. However, because she tries to act older than her age, she comes off as immature, which becomes a barrier in her dreams to success. Sometimes, her dreams can be so wild that they get in the way of her friendships, making her prone to arguments and trying to win them.\n\nShe wants to fulfill her relationship with Rob and constantly is angered with his laid-back attitude and on several occasions has tried to get him to be more hot-headed.\n\nJas can also get on her nerves for her oddball attitude. Lily was very annoyed at Jas when Jas posted on her social media she was in love with Rob to try to explain why she stole the brooch Rob gave Lily.\n\nShe's obsessed with becoming a 'mature woman' and tends to try to speed up her growing up, which tends to end in disaster as she gets placed at odds with her boyfriend or one of her friends. She can also be very emotional over the smallest thing. It was shown that hormones hit her very hard in Series 3.\n\nLily is a very phobic person, having many irrational fears, as shown when Rob and Sid suggest having a scary party during Halloween.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nLily has chocolate brown hair with blonde tips, and a memorable skinny face. Before, she often wore her hair down with a front braid, in a ponytail or side ponytail, though now, she often wears her hair out. She has a slim figure.\n\nRoles[]\n\nSeries 1[]\n\nLily was often trying to get the attention of Matt Furnish during the first series. Lily would often copy the popular girls such as Natasha Jones and Jenny Jones Every time Matt gets a crush on someone else, she would actually try to break them up, as seen in the episode 'Rox My World'. At the end of the series, Matt kissed her and she felt that she had managed to get him to like her.\n\nSeries 2[]\n\nIn series 2, Lily was more determined to get Matt to be her boyfriend. She and Jas would often hatch plans to get Matt to talk to Lily or spend time with her. At the end of the series, Matt wanted to impress Scarlet Brooks and her gang by performing the guitar and singing during assembly. Lily told Matt that his song was lovely, despite it being horrible (she wanted to make him think that it was good so that he would embarrass himself in front of Scarlet.) Eventually, she cracked, telling him that the song was horrible. Matt then practiced, eventually getting it right. On the time of the performance, he lost his voice and Lily stepped in to sing while he played guitar. After, Matt was offered to hang out with Scarlet but he refused, claiming that he would hang out with Lily because she was his girlfriend.\n\nSeries 3[]\n\nSometime between series 2 and 3, Matt moved away which left her heartbroken and unable to speak for a week. Lily then met Rob Edwards, who she became girlfriend and boyfriend with. In series 3, Lily is very determined to keep her and Rob's relationship alive. She would go on and on about it that Cassie and Maxwell used her to study team relationships.\n\nSeries 4[]\n\nIn series 4, Lily became more bossy and obsessed with being the boss.\n\nSeries 5[]\n\nIn series 5, Lily worked as a waitress at Mugshotsz. In the first episode, she believed that she was superior to Jas but Lou told her that Jas was perfect. In the series 5 finale, she was upset that Martha was dating Gustav, who was a horrible person. She also tried to save Christmas by having an early Christmas party. In the end, Lily was happy and she attended the Christmas party at Mugshotsz.\n\nSeries 6[]\n\nIn series 6, Lily seemed to be focusing more on work. In the first episode, she fought Martha for the head girl crown, and even gained a lot of support from students despite Martha critising her by saying she isn't ready for becoming head girl and since Matt Furnish came into the scene, she has been an \"ambition-free zone and goalless lackadaisical jelly\".\n\nStill So Awkward[]\n\nAt university, Lily attempts a new personality, which wears off in the first day. She is studying drama with famous actor Claire Fox. Her new friends include Frankie, Seb, Samson and Josh.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeries 1[]\n\n\"Parentology\"\n\n\"Friendundancy\"\n\n\"A Minus\"\n\n\"The Nox Factor\"\n\n\"Mr Sicky Bear\"\n\n\"Love Machine\"\n\n\"Library vs Tree\"\n\n\"Space Over\"\n\n\"Fitzgerald vs Fitzgerald\"\n\n\"Rox My World\"\n\n\"Good Girls\"\n\n\"Everybody Loves Clementine\"\n\n\"Pouncing Tigers\"\n\nSeries 2[]\n\n\"Dinner Date\"\n\n\"PSHE Hee Hee\"\n\n\"Locustium Insectium\"\n\n\"The Kiss\"\n\n\"Slang Gang\"\n\n\"Girls & Boys\"\n\n\"BFF\"\n\n\"Race To The Bottom\"\n\n\"Party Clause\"\n\n\"What Would Emmeline Do?\"\n\n\"The Salford Curse\"\n\n\"Eye Contact\"\n\n\"Totes Emosh\"\n\nSeries 3[]\n\n\"The Two Mrs Hamptons\"\n\n\"Ms Perfect\"\n\n\"Science Chic\"\n\n\"A Room of Her Own\"\n\n\"Never the Bridesmaid, Never the Bride\"\n\n\"Fly Me to The Moon\"\n\n\"Hormone Horror\"\n\n\"Ultimate Bucket\"\n\n\"Anger Management\"\n\n\"Megasaurus\"\n\n\"Bug Brooch\"\n\n\"Cranmede Fever\"\n\n\"So Long, Farewell\"\n\nSeries 4[]\n\n\"The Band\"\n\n\"Let's Talk About Love\"\n\n\"Where There's A Will\"\n\n\"Breaking Up\"\n\n\"Teenealogy\"\n\n\"The Look and Love\"\n\n\"Loyalty Points\"\n\n\"Date Night\"\n\n\"Practice Makes Perfect\"\n\n\"Scary Movie\"\n\n\"Three's Compant, Four's a Crowd\"\n\n\"Inspiring Women of Tomorrow\"\n\nSeries 5[]\n\n\"Waitress Wars\"\n\n\"Awardatarian\"\n\n\"Head Boy Hearts Girl\"\n\n\"Lou Dun It\"\n\n\"No Pain No Gain\"\n\n\"V Day\"\n\n\"Open Mice\"\n\n\"None of Your Business\"\n\n\"Never Meet Your Heroes\"\n\n\"Radio PI\"\n\n\"Our Brilliant Careers\"\n\n\"Virtue and Virtuality\"\n\n\"All We Want for Christmas\"\n\nSeries 6[]\n\n\"Heads We Win\"\n\n\"Face Off\"\n\n\"Travel Bug\"\n\n\"Possession Obsession\"\n\n\"Mascots\"\n\n\"Deny and Deniability\"\n\n\"Do the Write Thing\"\n\n\"Singletonia\"\n\n\"Electronic Dance Martha\"\n\n\"Shaved by the Bell\"\n\n\"So Lily\"\n\n\"Academic Lily Speaking\"\n\n\"Prom!\"\n\nStill So Awkward[]\n\n\"A Whole New Lily\"\n\n\"Monological\"\n\n\"90s Night\"\n\n\"Writing and Performance\"\n\n\"Meet the Parents\"\n\n\"Lilianova Hamptonovitch\"\n\n\"Hot Sauce\"\n\n\"Meddle of Honour\"\n\n\"Audition\"\n\n\"The Ball\"\n\n\"Burke Hill TV: Something New\"\n\n\"Burke Hill TV: Love and Romance\"\n\n\"Burke Hill TV: Work\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLily has automatonophobia (fear of ventriloquist dummies), formidophobia (fear of scarecrows), ichthyophobia (fear of fish) and a phobia of celery.[1]\n\nShe is the only main character from the series who returned in its successor series’ The second being Rufus.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ \"Scary Movie\".
