        "text": "Key post-war Hungarian director who made several notable films in the 1950s, such as the powerful drama \"The House Under the Rocks\" (1958), but enjoyed little of the international acclaim showered on Hungarian cinema in the 60s. \"Love\" (1970), based upon the novel by Tibor Dery, revived Makk's reputation, winning a Special Jury Prize at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. Like \"Love,\" Makk's subsequent films have been observant, finely acted works, ranging from \"A Very Moral Night\" (1977), a light comedy based in a brothel, to the astute, morally and politically charged \"Another Way\" (1982), about a doomed lesbian relationship in post-1956 Hungary."
