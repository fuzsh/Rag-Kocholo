        "text": "Colleen Hoover fans, listen up! There's a new update on the film adaptation of her bestselling book, It Ends With Us, that you don't want to miss. Following the drop of first-look photos of the romantic drama, Sony released the official movie trailer! The glimpse of the long-awaited movie based on the book features main cast members, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, as well as Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar. But before we get into that, here's a rundown on the literary lore, in case you missed it.\n\nThe romance novel was released in 2016 and spread like wildfire across social media during the pandemic, largely due to #BookTok, TikTok's reading community. Since then, It Ends With Us acquired the top spot on the best sellers list in 2021, where it remained for over 90 weeks, according to Deadline.\n\nThe feature film of the same name follows Lily, a young woman seeking a new beginning after college. Her life takes a turn when she falls for Ryle, a neurosurgeon, and then another turn when she reconnects with her teenage sweetheart, Atlas. As Lily delves deeper, she uncovers Ryle's troubled history, adding a layer of complexity to their romance.\n\nWhen does 'It Ends With Us' premiere?\n\nAfter a long string of pushbacks and filming delays, It Ends With Us finally has an official release date. The film is set to premiere on August 9, 2024, six months after it was initially slated to be released, according to People.\n\nLike Lily's love life, the road to the highly anticipated movie's release has been full of twists and turns. While Justin Baldoni's production company, Wayfarer Studios, optioned the book in 2019, cast announcements weren't confirmed until January 2023. Filming began shortly after in May 2023, leading to the initial release date of February 9, 2024. However, because production was halted, the premiere was pushed back to June 21, and most recently, the later summer date.\n\nWhat is 'It Ends With Us' about?\n\nIt Ends With Us is a romantic drama centering on Lily Bloom as she navigates the complexities of love, heartbreak, and resilience. Raised in an abusive home, Lily vows to never repeat her mother's mistakes. However, when she meets the charming neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, Lily's resolve is tested. As their relationship deepens, Lily must confront painful truths about love and the cycle of abuse. Things get even more complicated when she reconnects with her first love, Atlas Corrigan, further challenging her relationship with Ryle.\n\nThe film’s official synopsis reads, \"Lily Bloom thinks she's found the love of her life in Ryle Kincaid. However, after a troubling incident of abuse reminds her of her dark past, she must decide if love alone can carry her marriage through. Further complicating things is the return of her first love into her life: a man who she took in many years prior when he was homeless.”\n\nIn a cast announcement that Colleen posted on Instagram in early 2023, she revealed that the novel was \"loosely inspired\" by her childhood when her mother removed them from a \"scary situation.\"\n\nWho is in the 'It Ends With Us' cast?\n\nThe It Ends With Us cast boasts so many big names we don't know where to begin! Starting with the main characters, you can expect to see Blake Lively from the hit TV show Gossip Girl and movies like The Age of Adaline and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants as Lily Bloom.\n\nStarring alongside Blake as Lily's new love interest Ryle Kincaid, is Justin Baldoni, who starred in The CW's Jane the Virgin as heartthrob Rafael Solano. Not only is Justin taking on the role of brooding neurosurgeon in the film, but he's also executive producing and directing it from a screenplay by writer-producer Christy Hall.\n\nLily's first love, Atlas Corrigan, will be played by none other than Brandon Sklenar! Yellowstone fans may know him as Spencer Dutton from the spinoff series 1923. As for the younger versions of his and Blake's characters, Alex Neustaedter stars as young Atlas, and Isabela Ferrer portrays young Lily.\n\nThe star-studded lineup doesn't end there! Actress Jenny Slate joins the cast as Ryle's sister, Allyssa Kincaid, starring alongside award-winning comedian Hasan Minhaj as her husband, Marshall.\n\nIs there a trailer for 'It Ends With Us'?\n\nYes, the official trailer for the It Ends With Us movie has finally been released! The explosive trailer dropped about a year after Blake, Justin, and Brandon were first spotted filming the movie around New Jersey in May 2023.\n\nWithout giving away too much, the two-and-a-half minute preview gives viewers a sneak peek at Lily and Ryle's tumultuous dynamic and Atlas' bombshell reappearance in his childhood lover's life! As for how the movie ends, well, you'll have to wait for the full film to be released on August 9, so mark your calendars!"
