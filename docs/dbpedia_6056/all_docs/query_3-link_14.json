        "text": "FIRST DIARY ENTRY OF 2018\n\nPoetry. Very subtle, but poetry nonetheless. Intentionally colorless. Arguments could be done regarding how the film's imagery could have benefitted from its colors like Szabó's Bizalom (1980) did emulating auteurish cinematic features of the 60s, but this is confined more in the new wave of experimental Hungarian cinema that began in the 70s along with Huszárik. The colorless scheme elevates simplicity to a fantastical realm subdued by lies and melancholic memories cascading into a dying heart that attaches its will to live to the energy of a past life that might encounter its continuity with a false hope. Love is seen in subjective terms, but desperation leads to these unconventional displays of caring towards others,…\n\nKároly Makk’s Love is a quiet, intimate and extraordinary film that nestles in the weariness of lives under pressure and the love they try to sustain. There are three main characters: a husband and wife and the husband’s ailing mother. The old woman is bedridden, living out her last weeks under the care of her housekeeper, Irén, and the regular visits of her daughter-in-law, Luca. János is an absent presence until near the end of the film. He’s been arrested by the Hungarian secret police and Luca doesn’t even know if he is still alive. She lives on in the hope of his return, trying to make ends meet while being forced by the authorities to give away the main…\n\nThis simple and direct film should be described in simple and direct terms. This is what this devastating film deserves. It tells a story of a woman who's slowly losing hope that her husband, a political prisoner, will ever return. She spends most of her time caring for his old, ill mother, making up stories about her son since she does not know his condition.\n\nThe film is quite explicit about the oppressive political environment of the time and what one has to do in order to survive. The protagonist is often a victim due to her association with the prisoner and is constantly kept an eye on. But this is not a heavy-handed film. The shards of memories witnessed…\n\nwaiting, it seems waiting constitutes a third of our lives. several people rummage through the ticking hands of the clock for the right time. others perch by the door until a particular person turns the knob and comes in. while some of us wait anxiously, most of us do it as natural as breathing. it is there whenever we stand in line at the cashier’s until it's our turn; whenever we stand at the platform, at stations until the train, the tram or the bus arrives; whenever we sit in a theatre before the film or the performance begins. we look forward to lunch breaks, dismissals, Fridays, and holidays. we anticipate something will change, opportunities will turn up, and everything…\n\nI find it hard to describe this film in anything but direct and simple terms. It is a quiet, simple film on the surface, a story of a woman waiting on her husband to return from prison. She spends her time caring for his dying mother, spinning tales to keep from upsetting her. Melancholy hangs over the film as we wait for the inevitable tragedy, no matter what it will turn out to be (will the mother-in-law die? will the woman be dragged off to prison herself? will the husband never return?).\n\nBut underneath that there is a commentary on the duplicities we use to survive and on the political systems of Hungary in the era this was filmed. Little…"
