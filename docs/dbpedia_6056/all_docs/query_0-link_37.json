        "text": "to Christine Jorgensen, America's first transsexual, who went to Denmark in 1952 for a sex change operation. \"To wake up in the morning and not know whether you're a man or a woman,\" says Grant, \"is beyond anything most of us can conceive of. But the transsexuals and transvestites have such confusion. These are definite outsiders. And, I have a very strong sense of what it is to be an outsider.\" This is Grant's third documentary .\n\nHer previous works are \"The Women of Willmar\" (about eight women who picketed a Minnesota bank for equal pay, it starred her daughter, Dinah Manoff) and \"Why Women Kill\" (about seven women convicted of homicide). Grant's success in this field has left her little time for acting (an art for which she won an Oscar in 1976 for \"Shampoo,\" and an Emmy in 1971 for \"The Neon or her family- second husband Joseph Feury (who produced the film); their 13-year-old adopted daughter, Belinda; and daughter Dinah (who's starring on Broadway in \"Leader of the \"My daughter Belinda says that Peter, Paul and Mary song, 'I'm Leaving on a Jet reminds her of me,\" she says. \"It's true. All too often I'm leaving. And I hate to go .\n\nBut I have to go. There's no way to build what we want to build without the work.\" For Kay Gardella's review of \"What Sex Am see page 102. 77 Coast to Coast Pat O'Haire PLAY BALL: Forget about George Bush throwing out the first ball of the season for the Mets. He's only a vice president. The Broadway Show League tops that- recruited a king .\n\nYul Brynner, monarch of all he surveys in \"The King and shows off his best pitch tomorrow at 12:30 when he opens the softball season at Central Park's Heckscher Field. His show is playing a team from \"Sunday in the Park With George,\" who are exchanging their paint brushes and palettes for baseball bats for the season. When all that is over, \"Biloxi Blues,\" headed by Matthew Broderick, takes to the adjoining field to battle it out with \"Joe Egg,\" fielding Jim Dale and Stockard Channing and others. Last year, \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" was the champ; they'll defend their title at the 2:30 p.m. game when they go up against a combined team from both \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" and \"Hurlyburly,\" with Danny Aiello and Susan Anton on the field .\n\nThat combo team plays under the name of \"Ma Rainey's Hurlyburly,\" though, as press agent Bert Fink points out, it would draw a lot more attention as \"Hurlyburly's Black Bottom.\" Obviously nobody consulted him, however. \"Pack of Lies\" and \"Strange Interlude\" are also combined as \"Strange Lies,\" and when their turn comes, Rosemary Harris claims she will take the field with them. We shall see. Three games are held every Thursday through mid-August, and it's no joking matter. The games are in earnest and deadly serious, and the league's Peter Ueberroth is Don Koehler, stage manager who's been moonlighting as the softball honcho .\n\nHe's been seen recently strolling through Shubert Alley carrying a clipboard with the team match-ups all written down, wearing a blue satin baseball jacket with one word on its back. The word is Marilyn Beck IT'S FINALLY ready, set, go in June for the long-planned NBC John Lennon-Yoko Ono bio-pic. Carson Company, Productions president John J. McMahon reports that a casting director will be signed for the threehour drama this week and a June 15 start date is definitely set. He also reveals that Yoko, who provided input for the script, will assist in casting the two principal roles .\n\nHe expects unknowns to play both the late Beatle and his widow. Still to be decided is whether the John Lennon main base of shooting will be Toronto, -New York or London. But wherever, the three-hour love story will conclude at Manhattan's Dakota apartments -with the senseless slaying of John Lennon. AND IN THIS CORNER: Contrary to what Barbara Eden says, Larry Hagman says he never backed out of doing her \"I Dream of Jeannie\" TV movie- -that he never had any intention of doing it. He says he never received a script or even a letter requesting him to reprise his role from the '60s series .\n\nBarbara informed me last week that Larry had said he would join her in the venture but has now changed his mind. She did admit, however, that because they were friends she didn't want to pressure him, and therefore let the contact be made by others. Pop! Goes a birthday HE \"TONIGHT\" of today meets yesterday's \"Tonight\" as Johnny Carson's current musical cohort, Doc Severinsen, joins Steve Allen's main musical man, Skitch Henderson, onstage at Carnegie Hall Monday night at 8.

Also performing will be Liza Minnelli, Liberace, Barbara Walters (yes! she'll Dick Cavett (he'll and other pals of The News' own Liz Smith .\n\nTickets, from $14 to $22.50, are on sale at Carpegie, Hall.

For 10 years, she was blacklisted by Hollywood after refusing to condemn her late husband, Arnold Manoff, before the House UnAmerican Activities Commission. \"That ostracism,\" she says, \"defined society for me .\n\nI knew who my enemies were. I was about 19 and really had a sense that I lost so many parts. \"So now,\" says the actress, \"when I see things that are unfair, something starts to churn in me.\" The latest result of that churning is \"What Sex Am a one-hour look into a world rarely televised- the world of transsexuals, transvestites and she-males. The documentary, which Grant directed and narrates, airs on HBO tonight at 10 p.m. The film examines the lives of eight people suffering the gender crisis, focusing on their pain, confusion and guilt .\n\nAmong the subjects are mmier' Top, Grant with transsexual Steven. Above, Grant with Kathy (left), who is preparing for his operation, and his transsexual roommate. mmier' Plummer in 'Lily' By PATRICIA 'HAIRE sits back in his chair, rests his elbows on its arms and taps the tips of the fingers of his left hand against those of his right. \"I remember the first time I was on Broadway,\" he says. \"It was 'The Starcross and it lasted two nights, I think .\n\nI remember standing on line the last night waiting to be paid, thinking my career was over!\" That was 1954. And it was the beginning- rather than the enda career. Now, the Canadian-born actor (he now calls Connecticut HRISTOPHER PLUMMER home) is in a new movie with Maggie Smith, \"Lily in Love,\" which opens tomorrow, and it's a plummier Plummer on the screen than before. \"Lily in Love\" is about a playwright (Smith) and an actor (Plummer), who are married. Since he usually stars in her plays, he is crushed when he learns her new work calls for a younger man-soft-spoken and Italian, besides .\n\nHe responds by calling in a makeup man who transforms him- -so convincingly, in fact, even his wife is fooled. The alter ego wins the role, and he also wins well, that's the story. Sound familiar? It should. It's similar to the plot of \"The Guardsman,\" by Ferenc Molnar. \"I'd say, it's close,\" admits Plummer .\n\nit's very loose, just the same: It was to be made in Molar's country, and working in Hungary was one reason I signed on. The director (Karoly Makk) was Hungarian. Making a sophisticated comedy in an Iron Curtain country appealed to me. Ironic. \"Of course, I liked the script as well .\n\nAnd I wanted to do a comedy on the screen, something I've hardly ever Hardly ever is right. He's noted for his villainous roles the snaky lago to James Earl Jones' Othello; the murdering Macbeth; the Devil (in \"J.B.\"); Henry V. Of course, he's tempered those with \"lighter\" ones \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\" light, or \"Arturo Ui,\" or \"Oedipus Rex.\" He was also ISMON Christopher Plummer Christopher Plummer in \"The Sound of Music\" film. In real life, Plummer is the father of Amanda (her mother is his ex-wife, Grimes), who has already chalked up a \"Agnes of and several movies. independent, which I suppose is only being the child of parents who were had careers of their own,\" he says .\n\n\"She's strange, smart, with a lovely wish she'd do some comic things.
