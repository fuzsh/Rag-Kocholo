        "text": "Another memorable moment for the star involved Roki and Jax running through the cornfield, which turned out to be one of the most difficult to film. She said, \"[Deroy-Olsen and I] had a stupid amount of fun shooting that one. You know, it's like [we had] no business having so much fun shooting such a hard scene. But it was our fourth day of shooting and we figured out how we work together. We're similar performers in that like saving it for the scene. So we were running the lines to make sure that we really had the flow of it. It was just to run the text and the language, and we were doing our silly valley girl voices, or silly Willow voices.\"\n\n\"I called her 'Wilson' because that scene where Tom Hanks, where Wilson is drifting away in the water from him, is kind of what it felt like when she's running away from me in the cornfield,\" Gladstone continued, referring to the 2000 survival drama, Cast Away. \"So I started to call like, 'Wilson! Wilson!' Then she just became Wilson. That was her nickname through the rest of the shoot. So it was fun to shoot these things, and it was fun to work with somebody who has a similar approach and is not going to get thrown by being goofy, is actually going to help protect the integrity of the drama of the scene.\"\n\nIt's no wonder the co-stars had such an authentic relationship throughout the film. Gladstone said, \"Having those little moments is really what strengthened our bond. You know, it's like, this is my actual niece now.\"\n\nFancy Dance premieres on Apple TV+ this Friday, June 28, so mark your calendar."
