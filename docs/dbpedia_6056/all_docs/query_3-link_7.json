        "text": "Karoly Makk, a leading Hungarian director who was honored at the Cannes Film Festival in 1971 for “Love,” the story of one family’s survival under his country’s repressive Stalinist rule, then nominated four years later for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, for “Cats’ Play,” died on Aug. 30. He was 91.\n\nThe Szechenyi Academy of Letters and Arts announced his death but did not say where he died or give a cause. Mr. Makk was its president.\n\nSet in the 1950s and based on two stories by the Hungarian writer Tibor Dery, “Love” is about a bedridden elderly woman whose daughter-in-law shields her from knowing that her son is a political prisoner by telling her outrageous lies about his successful life in the United States as a filmmaker. It tied with Bo Widerberg’s “Joe Hill” for the Jury Prize at Cannes.\n\n“It has a political point of view, but the human values are the dominant ones,” Mr. Makk said in an interview with The New York Times after the film’s release. “What is important is not the situation but how the two women caught in it behave.”\n\nIt took six years for the government to give Mr. Makk approval to make the film. “The political elite finally gave in because they realized they couldn’t shut down everything,” he told the Cannes Festival website last year, “and nobody knew at the time how successful the movie was going to be.”\n\nWhen “Love” (“Szerelem” in Hungarian) was released in the United States in 1973, Vincent Canby of The Times ranked it in the year’s 10 best movies. (Among the others were François Truffaut’s “Day for Night” and George Lucas’s “American Graffiti.”)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
