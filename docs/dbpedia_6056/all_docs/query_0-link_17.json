Dad hadn’t brought any food this time, either. I knew we would die of starvation and freeze. My best friend, a whale, came and offered to sacrifice himself for us to survive a few more weeks. The pain of losing him was unbearable. We were crying in the whale’s belly. Then a silhouette unfolded in the distant fog: the creature had fur on its body, and some kind of a wooden weapon. It was a male human but much more developed than us. I realized, at that moment, that his species would be the one that survives.\n\nAdmired Films:\n\nJoanna / Aneta Kopacz / 2013\n\nParadise: Love / Ulrich Seidl / 2012\n\nJust the Wind / Bence Fliegauf / 2012\n\nLe Quattro Volte / Michelangelo Frammartino / 2010\n\nMy Best Fiend / Werner Herzog / 1999\n\nTaste of Cherry / Abbas Kiarostami / 1997\n\nSee No Evil, Hear No Evil / Arthur Hiller / 1989\n\nMonthy Python and the Holy Grail / Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam / 1975\n\nLove / Karoly Makk / 1971\n\nUP Series / Michael Apted / 1964–2012\n\n12 Angry Men / Sidney Lumet / 1957\n\nMeshes of the Afternoon / Maya Deren / 1943"
