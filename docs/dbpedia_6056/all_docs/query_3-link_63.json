        "text": "Last fall, I had the chance to travel to Athens, Ohio, to see the premiere screening of Edit Jakab’s short film In Praise of Angela. Many years ago, Edit and I taught at the same Hungarian Saturday school in Montreal. We reconnected just a few years ago and it was a pleasure to see the direction that life took her these […]\n\nAmerican Factory is a highly praised American documentary directed by Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert. It deservedly won an Academy Award this year in the documentary film category. The film is about a Chinese company’s takeover of an old General Motors plant near Dayton, Ohio and the struggle of the American workers trying to adjust to the Chinese management. Steve […]\n\nAs part of our series on lesser known Hungarian Americans we introduce Hollywood star Charles Korvin. The very good looking Hungarian was a popular star of the screen in the 1940s. Géza Kárpáthy Korvin was born in 1907 in Pöstyén, Hungarian Kingdom (today Piešťany, Slovakia) in a Hungarian speaking family with a noble lineage. Géza was fascinated with photography and […]\n\nAttila Szász is an exceptionally talented Hungarian film director. A couple of years ago I saw his film Demimonde (Félvilág) at the Tiburon Fim Festival and I found it intriguing. His latest film Eternal Winter (Örök tél) takes place at the end of World War II when many ethnic Germans were rounded up in Hungary and sent to labor camps […]\n\nThe film director, Quentin Tarantino is in trouble. He is accused of negligence by actress Uma Thurman, who says that he bullied her into driving an unsafe car that crashed in the set of Bill Kill. She also says that he spit in her face and choked her with a chain. It is also alleged that he tried to strangle […]\n\nThree years ago I wrote about a cherished Californian tradition; the Hungarian Film Festivals in Los Angeles and San Francisco. For many years these events were interesting and entertaining, and the organizers presented an array of films, features, documentaries and shorts. (Read here about past festivals.) The “father” of the Los Angeles Hungarian Film Festival is Béla Bunyik. He came […]\n\nKároly Makk was a Hungarian film director and screenwriter of international stature, comparable to Miklós Jancsó or Péter Bacsó, who brought postwar Hungarian cinema to European and western audiences. Károly Makk died at age 92, on August 30th, 2017. At the time of his death, he served as the president of the Széchenyi Academy of Literature and the Arts. Born […]\n\nThis month, I was invited to watch a private preview screening of the documentary Keep Quiet, which will have its Toronto premiere at the Toronto Jewish Film Foundation Festival on May 8, 2017. The film, directed by Joseph Martin and Sam Blair, focuses on the political coming of age of Jobbik and Hungarian Guard co-founder Csanád Szegedi–a young man who represented […]\n\nI was in disbelief when my wife, who was watching the Oscars, told me that The American Academy of Motion Picture gave an Oscar to Hungarian short film Sing in the Live Action Short Film category. The 25-minute film was directed by 34-year old Kristóf Deák. It takes place in a Budapest school (Bakáts Téri Ének-Zenei Általános Iskola) in 1991 […]\n\nZsa Zsa Gábor, the Hungarian beauty whose many marriages, gossipy adventures and occasional legal scuffles kept her in tabloid headlines for decades, died Sunday in Bel Air, California. She was 99. Suzanne Moore writes in The Guardian that Zsa Zsa Gábor is not remembered for her film roles, which were minor, instead, she is being celebrated for being Zsa Zsa […]"
