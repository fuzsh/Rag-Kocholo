        "text": "#BookTok lovers, it’s happening. Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel It Ends With Us is officially coming to the silver screen. Under the hashtag #ItEndsWithUs, the phenomenon has reached over 2 billion views on TikTok, and according to Forbes, has sold more than 4 million copies since its publication in 2016.\n\nThe story follows Lily Bloom, a 23-year-old from small-town Maine, who moves to Boston after college to open her own business. Here, she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, who she quickly and passionately falls in love with, but finds that his “complete aversion to relationships is disturbing,” the official book description reads.\n\n“As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind,” the description continues. “He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.”\n\nIn an Instagram video announcing two of the lead roles for the film cast, Hoover, standing outside her childhood home, discussed the inspiration behind It Ends With Us. She explained that the book, which portrays themes of domestic violence, is loosely based on her home life as a child.\n\n“I just want everyone to know how appreciative I am to my mother, who got us out of a scary situation when I was little and brought us here to this house which doesn’t look like much but was full of love and joy,” she explained at the time. “So thank you, Mom, for making that very difficult decision. … The fact that we are now discussing a movie that was made from a book that was loosely inspired by my mother, it’s bittersweet. So many people have had to go through [what she did], but to know my mom’s decision has helped so many people get out of that. I love you, Mom.”\n\nThe movie adaptation, directed by Jane the Virgin star Justin Baldoni, will likely follow the novel’s storyline very closely. But we’re here to provide all of the updates and news about the film ahead of its release. Keep reading for everything we know (so far) about the film adaptation of It Ends With Us — and yes, most of the characters have been cast!\n\nWhen does It Ends With Us premiere?\n\nSony Pictures and Wayfarer Studios, have announced that It Ends With Us is slated to be released on February 9, 2024 in an exclusive report from The Hollywood Reporter. Actor and director Justin Baldoni shared the news in an Instagram post on July 9, 2023. \"See you Feb 9th at a theater near you!\" he wrote alongside a screenshot of THR's headline.\n\nHas filming started?\n\nYes — but as of June 20, 2023, production has been halted due to the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike. According to Deadline, the movie was still in its early stages of filming and less than half of it has been completed. At first, filming was halted temporarily because the movie's producers and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) reached a disagreement about the ongoing protests and picketing. Deadline’s report also reveals that Wayfarer Studios and director Justin Baldoni sent an email to the cast and crew with the announcement that production would go on an indefinite hiatus.\n\n“Due to the ongoing WGA strike and the lost days we have experienced due to picketing, we must make the difficult decision to temporarily shut down production,” the announcement began. “We want to express our deepest gratitude for your incredible patience and unwavering dedication throughout this challenging period,” the email continued.\n\nBack on May 4, 2023, Hoboken Girl confirmed that production had begun in Hoboken, New Jersey, located just outside of Manhattan. The outlet re-posted production notices from the It Ends With Us crew, which confirmed that filming would begin in the city on Friday, May 5, and continue into June.\n\nThe book notably takes place in Boston, but at this time, it’s unclear if the city setting changes for the film, or if production is simply using Hoboken as a Boston stand-in.\n\nWho has been cast in It Ends With Us?\n\nOn January 26, Deadline announced that Blake Lively will star as Lily Bloom. ICYMI, Blake’s previous acting credits include Gossip Girl, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and A Simple Favor (oh, and she made her directorial debut with Taylor Swift’s “I Bet You Think About Me” music video).\n\n“We have a cast! Our Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively. Blake Lively y’all! She’s my dream Lily,” Colleen announced on Instagram. Blake herself teased the casting announcement on her Instagram Story in January, debuting a dark-haired selfie as the quick clip played “Lily (My One and Only)” by the Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nYoung Lily has been cast as well. The younger actress and Blake Lively were spotted on set sporting matching wavy red hair as they chatted between takes. TikTok account @booksascomfort mentioned upcoming actress Isabela Ferrer in the caption of a video of Young Lily and Blake, although the actress’s identity has not been confirmed just yet.\n\n“She looks exactly like Blake from the side,” commented a fan. We agree — absolutely ✨immaculate✨ casting.\n\nAs for Ryle Kincaid, Jane the Virgin’s Justin Baldoni has been tapped as both lead actor and director, according to Deadline. “Here we go!!!!,” he captioned a repost of Hoover’s announcement on Instagram. Justin recently took to TikTok to show a clip of himself chopping off his longer locks, and fans speculated that the hair change was part of the actor’s transform into his Ryle Kincaid character.\n\nFans immediately took to the comment section of the sweet TikTok to point out the physical resemblance Justin shared with his new character. “Ryle has entered the chat,” one fan wrote. “Why did I imagine you as Ryle when reading the book,” another commented.\n\nAtlas Corrigan, Lily’s first love, has also been cast. The chef will be portrayed by 1923 star Brandon Skelnar, Deadline reports.\n\nJenny Slate will portray Ryle’s sister, Allysa, according to Deadline. In the novel, she and Lily become fast friends after Lily opens her flower shop in Boston and Allysa inquires about a job. Allysa’s husband, Marshall, will be played by Hasan Minhaj, Deadline confirmed on May 24. The actor and comedian, who’s previously starred in The Morning Show and The Daily Show, was spotted filming alongside Blake and Justin on Wednesday, per photos obtained by The Daily Mail. He and Justin were dressed in onesies, evidently filming the scene where we’re first introduced to the character (assuming that the movie follows the same timeline as the book).\n\nCasting for other central characters, including Lily’s mother, have not been disclosed just yet.\n\nHas Colleen Hoover addressed the controversy over casting?\n\nWhen It Ends With Us author Colleen Hoover first announced Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s casting in the film adaptation, fans responded with backlash over the age discrepancies between the book’s characters and the actors’ ages. In the novel, Lily is a 23-year-old college graduate, while Ryle is a 30-year-old neurosurgeon. IRL, Blake is 35, which makes her more than a decade older than her character, and Justin is 39.\n\nHoover previously hadn’t responded to fans’ reactions, but during The New York Times’ Book Bonanza on June 25, she finally addressed the controversy over casting. “Back when I wrote It Ends With Us, the new adult [genre] was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That’s what I was contracted to do,” she began, according to People.\n\n“I didn’t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There’s not a 20-something neurosurgeon,” she continued. “As I started making this movie, I’m like, ‘We need to age them out because I messed up.’ So that’s my fault.”\n\nHoover added that she’s “extremely happy” with Blake and Justin’s casting, and even reassured fans about the somewhat-eccentric outfits that have been snapped on set. “You've seen a couple of outfits that are completely out of context. I'm not worried about it,” she said.\n\nAre there more photos from set?\n\nYup! In May 2023, the first photos from set surfaced and we finally got a glimpse of Blake Lively as Lily Bloom and Justin Baldoni as Ryle Kincaid. In the first set of photos, Blake — who dyed her signature blonde tresses to a fiery red for the role — was photographed in a midi brown halter dress, chunky loafers, and patterned trouser socks. At one point, she layered a pink Carhartt tee and work jacket over the look, per photos obtained by Daily Mail. Meanwhile, Justin was spotted in a long-sleeved black tee, pants, and boots. Blake’s sister, Robyn Lively, was also spotted on set. However, it’s unclear if she’s been cast or was just stopping by for a visit.\n\nTwo days later, Blake was spotted on set in Jersey City, New Jersey, in a patterned quilt jacket, maroon pants, black boots, and a beanie.\n\nOn May 18, we finally saw Lily Bloom’s first love, Atlas Corrigan, come to life. Brandon Sklenar, who portrays the chef, was spotted in character with Blake in New York City, dressed in jeans, a white tee, and a tan suede jacket. Meanwhile, Blake as Lily wore an oversized plaid shirt-jacket, blue pants, and black boots. The two appeared to be filming an intense scene, as they were photographed talking, holding each other, and sharing an emotional embrace.\n\nIs there a trailer for It Ends With Us?\n\nNo, no trailer as of now. It Ends With Us has started filming (and production is currently on pause), so teasers and trailers probably won’t be ready for several months. In the meantime, check out the novel and its prequel, It Starts With Us."
