        "text": "We can feel l'amour between Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell.\n\nUnlike Collins' Emily in Paris character, who's searching for romance in the City of Love, the 34-year-old actress is happily married.\n\nAfter sparking dating rumors in July 2019, Collins and McDowell made their relationship Instagram official a month later. They eventually got engaged in 2020 and tied the knot a year later.\n\nCollins is well-known for her acting roles, while McDowell is a filmmaker who's written and directed a variety of notable works, including The One I Love (2014), The Discovery (2017) and Windfall (2022), which stars Collins.\n\nSimilar to his wife, whose father is legendary rocker Phil Collins and whose mother is actress Jill Tavelman, McDowell's family is also in the entertainment industry. His dad is A Clockwork Orange actor Malcolm McDowell and his mom is Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen.\n\nFrom Instagram revelations to film collaborations, here's everything to know about Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell's relationship.\n\n2019: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell meet\n\nCollins met McDowell on the set of his film, Gilded Rage, in 2019. While the couple proved to have a solid working relationship, it eventually sparked into something more.\n\nThe actress revealed on Live with Kelly and Ryan, \"It was one of those situations where I knew the second I met him that I wanted to be his wife one day. So, it was just a matter of when, really.\"\n\nAfter Gilded Rage, the couple worked together again on Windfall. Collins opened up to Vogue Australia about her experience, saying, \"I thought it would be harder, I have to say. I thought it would be more stressful to have to work with him, but it honestly was really amazing and freeing.\"\n\nAugust 20, 2019: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell go Instagram official\n\nCollins made her relationship with McDowell Instagram official when she posted a sweet photo of her and her beau on Aug. 20, 2019. The photo showed Collins hugging McDowell from behind with the caption, \"Always got your back...\"\n\nThe location of the post says Paris, France, which leads us to believe they were enjoying the City of Love together while Collins was filming the first season of Emily in Paris.\n\nCollins later revealed on Live with Kelly and Ryan that McDowell would visit her on set and they would explore the city together.\n\n\"He did come out a few times. And we did roam the streets and get lost on the cobblestone alleyways a few times,\" she said. \"I miss that the most. The idea of being in Paris, taking a scooter, going to museums, eating and even taking the Eurostar to London and Bruges … everything is so romantic,\" she added.\n\nDecember 18, 2019: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell adopt a dog together\n\nCollins and McDowell don't have any children, but they do share an adorable puppy that graces each of their Instagram accounts. Collins posted a photo on Dec. 18, 2019 of \"baby Redford,\" a dog they rescued from Love Leo Rescue.\n\nIn addition to tagging McDowell in the photo, part of her caption read, \"It was absolute love at first sight and I know we're going to have so many incredible adventures ahead. Welcome to the family!\"\n\n(Did we mention the dog even has his own Instagram? You can follow him at @redforddog!)\n\nJanuary 13, 2020: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell make their first public appearance together\n\nCollins and McDowell made their first public appearance at the Staples Center for a basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Jan. 13, 2020. Since sitting courtside in L.A., the couple has publicly taken their relationship around the world.\n\nSeptember 25, 2020: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell get engaged\n\nCollins and McDowell announced their engagement on Sept. 25, 2020, in front of a stunning New Mexico setting.\n\nPaired with a carousel of photos (including a close-up of her rose-cut diamond ring), Collins captioned her post, \"I've been waiting my lifetime for you and I can't wait to spend our lifetime together...\"\n\nMcDowell also posted a photo of Collins flashing her rock with a sweet caption that read, \"In a time of uncertainty and darkness you have illuminated my life. I will forever cherish my adventure with you.\"\n\nNovember 30, 2020: Lily Collins says she and Charlie McDowell are \"soaking in being engaged\"\n\nTwo months after getting engaged to McDowell, Collins told Extra they were still \"totally soaking in being engaged.\"\n\nCollins added that until she got engaged she never wore rings on her left ring finger. \"It wasn't like I was superstitious, I was just like, 'I'm saving that finger.'\" she said. \"Even in photoshoots, I'd be like, 'No, no, no …' I was always saving it, so now it's like, 'Oh, right, like, it has its place, it's finally found the right ring to put on.'\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2021: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell get married\n\nAbout one year after announcing their engagement, Collins and McDowell wed on Sept. 4, 2021, in Dunton, Colorado. The couple shared photos of their beautiful, fairytale-looking ceremony along with romantic Instagram captions about each other.\n\nCollins shared a photo of them kissing at the altar, writing, \"I've never wanted to be someone's someone more than I do yours, and now I get to be your wife. On September 4th, 2021 we officially became each other's forever. I love you beyond @charliemcdowell…\"\n\nMeanwhile, McDowell captioned his post, \"I married the most generous, thoughtful, and beautiful person I've ever known. I love you @lilyjcollins.\"\n\nOctober 2021: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell honeymoon in Scandinavia\n\nOn Oct. 12, Collins shared stunning pictures from her recent honeymoon with McDowell on Instagram, including a photo of the newlyweds kissing. She wrote in the caption, \"Our Scandinavian honeymoon may be over, but the adventure definitely is not.\"\n\nCollins continued in the caption: \"I can't imagine a more memorable, magical first trip as newlyweds and way to officially begin our lives together. There's no one I'd rather airplane hop and road trip with. Here's to the many more epic experiences to come…\"\n\nThe previous day McDowell also shared several photos of the trip on his Instagram, writing in the caption, \"We love you, Scandinavia. Thank you for an adventure and honeymoon of a lifetime. See you next time.\"\n\nNovember 23, 2021: Lily Collins talks about being directed by Charlie McDowell in Windfall\n\nMcDowell directed his fiancée in the 2022 Netflix film Windfall. In an interview with Vogue Australia, Collins said that working together on set wasn't a challenge.\n\n\"Honestly, it was so easy working together. I would forget that it was him,\" Collins said, jokingly adding, \"He just said, 'I haven't heard the word genius yet.'\"\n\n\"I thought it would be harder, I have to say,\" Collins said. \"I thought it would be more stressful to have to work with him, but it honestly was really amazing and freeing. It was great, and I'm really, really proud of the movie, and I'm proud of him. It's a different type of role for me.\"\n\nHowever, McDowell said there was one aspect of directing Collins that he found \"a little distracting,\" and that was \"when Jesse Plemons, who's a very good friend of mine, is picking her up and kissing her.\"\n\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute. There's something off about this. My good friend is kissing my then-fiancée,'\" he told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nMarch 22, 2022: Lily Collins says Charlie McDowell \"believes\" in her during interview\n\nIn an interview with CBS Mornings to promote Windfall, Collins, again praised working with McDowell as a director.\n\n\"He treats everyone the same, and there were very few of us in the cast so we all had a very intimate, collaborative experience that sometimes I would forget that it was my Charlie as opposed to Charlie-my-director,\" said Collins. \"It was so fun.\"\n\nCollins also attributed the praise received for her role to McDowell's continuing support.\n\n\"I honestly attest so much of it to Charlie,\" said Collins on CBS Mornings. \"There's something very specific that he saw in all of us, we all play against type. But for me, specifically, that he saw in me, and he got out of me that I haven't been able to do. [He] creatively believes in me sometimes, maybe more than I believe in myself.\"\n\nCollins added, \"Again, as a spouse and a director, you want that person to say, 'No, you can do this,' and push you creatively.\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2022: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary\n\nCollins marked her and McDowell's first anniversary with a sweet post on Instagram.\n\nThe actress shared black-and-white photos from her wedding, including snaps of her and McDowell walking arm-in-arm and another of the happy couple dancing.\n\n\"A year ago today, I chose my forever tomorrow,\" Collins captioned the photos. \"Having you by my side to have and to hold is the greatest gift I could have ever hoped for. I'd walk with you anywhere, talk to you about anything and travel the world with you anytime.\"\n\nShe added, \"And I love you with the deepest parts of my soul…\"\n\nMcDowell acknowledged the milestone with his own post, sharing a photo of his wife smiling. \"A year ago I married my hero. You make every place shine brighter and better,\" he wrote. \"I am in awe of your kindness and beauty every single day. I will try to keep up.\"\n\nHe finished the caption with, \"I love you forever @lilyjcollins.\"\n\nSeptember 28, 2022: Lily Collins shares sweet note from Charlie McDowell on final day of filming Emily in Paris\n\nBack in June, McDowell wrote Collins a handwritten note on her first day of shooting Emily in Paris season 3. The actress then shared it on Instagram to mark her final day of filming.\n\nThe note read: \"Have a great first day, Emily. You show those high heels who's boss! [Love] C\"\n\nWhen sharing the well-wishes from McDowell, she added her own note. \"From the first day until the last day, thank you for supporting and encouraging me @CharlieMcDowell,\" Collins wrote. \"It's almost time to hang up the heels again.\"\n\nOctober 8, 2022: Lily Collins says she can \"conquer anything\" with Charlie McDowell\n\nFilming a TV series halfway across the world might put a damper on most marriages, but long-distance was not an issue for Collins and McDowell.\n\n\"We can kind of conquer anything,\" Collins told E! News. \"We've been through so many changes globally, personally, and to be able to have a partner next to you that makes you laugh in times when you need it the most and helps you emotionally get through things, like moving to a foreign country for four months.\"\n\nThe Emily in Paris star continued: \"I just feel so grateful that I have someone next to me to be able to accomplish that and your best friend with you all the time.\"\n\nOctober 16, 2022: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell attend the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles\n\nCollins and McDowell stopped to take a few photos before entering the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The Emily in Paris star stunned in a sheer black top and a floral Dior skirt with a thigh-high slit, while McDowell looked dapper in a Ralph Lauren tuxedo.\n\nDecember 6, 2022: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell attend the season 3 premiere of Emily in Paris\n\nThe couple walked the red carpet together at the Paris premiere of Collins' hit Netflix series. McDowell looked handsome in a tweed suit that complemented his wife's camel-colored gown.\n\n\"Last night was nothing short of a dream. I couldn't have asked for a more stunning Paris premiere filled with so much love and celebration,\" Collins wrote on Instagram.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023: Lily Collins shows off pictures from a trip to Scandinavia with Charlie McDowell\n\nCollins shared photos on Instagram from a trip with McDowell to Scandinavia, where the pair went on their honeymoon two years earlier. The Emily in Paris star included a picture of herself snacking on a boat as well as a sweet shot of her and McDowell kissing on the street.\n\n\"Smitten in Scandinavia…\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nMay 6, 2023: Lily Collins has engagement and wedding rings stolen\n\nWhile at the Edition Hotel spa in Los Angeles, Collins' engagement and wedding rings were stolen from a secured locker. A source told PEOPLE that there was no evidence of forced entry. The police report valued the items at \"over $10,000.\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2023: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell celebrate two years of marriage\n\nIn honor of their wedding anniversary, Collins penned a sweet post on Instagram about McDowell.\n\n\"Two years today and a lifetime to come. I remember this moment, this day, this excitement as vividly as if it were yesterday. And I feel the love, the support, and the magic 100 times more,\" she captioned photos from their wedding day. \"I adore you @charliemcdowell and I couldn’t be more grateful to be your other half in life and in love.\"\n\nCollins continued: \"You make me a stronger, bolder, and brighter human. Thank you for being the greatest partner I could ever imagine and for making me smile like no other. Here’s to another 365 days of memories ahead, wherever in the world we find ourselves. I’d walk into the unknown with you any day and every day. With you by my side, it’s always an epic adventure.\"\n\nIn the comments, McDowell called himself the \"luckiest guy in the world.\"\n\nFebruary 27, 2024: Lily Collins and Charlie McDowell attend Paris Fashion Week"
