        "text": "Fancy Dance, a new film from director Erica Tremblay, will premiere in select theaters on June 21 and will be available for streaming on Apple TV+ on June 28, 2024.\n\nThe film stars Lily Gladstone, Isabel Deroy-Olson, Ryan Begay, Crystle Lightning, Audrey Wasilewski and Shea Whigham. It was co-written by Tremblay and Miciana Alise.\n\nFancy Dance follows Jax (Gladstone) as she must search for her missing sister while preparing her niece Roki (Deroy-Olson) for a dance at an upcoming powwow on the Seneca-Cayuga reservation in Oklahoma. The film is not only a look into the failure of the justice system for Native women but also a sensitive look at the bonds of family.\n\nThe film is the first narrative feature from Erica Tremblay and premiered originally last year at The Sundance Film Festival. “I think I've been imagining Fancy Dance in my mind, unfolding in very small steps. It started as a conversation between Lily and me: first step. Then, it was a bit of daydreaming to come up with an outline: second step. Calling Miciana Alise, this incredible Tlingit writer: another step... I don't get too caught up in seeing too far ahead. I try to accomplish the step in front of me to the best of my ability,” Tremblay recalls. “I don't think I could have imagined a better outcome for the film. At one time, I didn't even know if it would ever even get financed or that it would get made or if would it get into Sundance. You have these small things that you're accomplishing along the way, and each one of those feels like the dream coming true… Now we get to finally share it with audiences.”\n\nGetting the film made came with hurdles for Tremblay. “There are a lot of challenges: the challenges to raise money, the challenges to get the film made, to get the film seen, to get distribution… to believe in yourself enough to get in front of an entire crew of people and say, ‘Hey, why don't you come on board this wild ride?’” she explains. However, Fancy Dance was also a labor of love and profoundly impactful for the director. “I hope that I always get to feel this way about my work. [I didn’t expect] that I would have this relationship with these fictional characters that I made up. I thought you just ‘make things up,’ and you move along. But I sincerely care about these characters and these people. They exist to me, and that was kind of surprising.”\n\nThe film feels personal and intimate in many ways, both in the directing and the performances. “[I loved] getting to establish the relationship of Jax and Roki with Isabelle,” Gladstone says. “In the two of us really loving our characters and finding the way those characters really loved each other, our own friendship/relationship grew. The stakes are inherent when you care about the person that you're working with so much.”\n\nGladstone and Tremblay brought their own experiences as “aunties” and community members into the film, allowing for rawness and realness to the emotional stakes, and from the script to the finished product, very little changed in Fancy Dance. “I think just with the magic of Erica and Miciana's writing, all of those things were so and so richly on the page… the love was very much there.” Gladstone says, “This has always been a script that I don't get restless reading… It's just like you're there. You're glued to it from beginning to end. It's rare that you get scripts that are that arresting and that you just immediately want to read again because you've appreciated the emotional journey.”\n\nThe film has a rich cultural memory that the audience can feel. As the name suggests, the film culminates in a Fancy Dance performance, a popular style of powwow dancing. Hauli Sioux Gray choreographed the dance scene and also appeared briefly as Jax’s missing sister, Tawi.\n\n“When Isabella and I started shooting, Hauli went back to her life [after choreographing].” Gladstone recalls, “Then, when she was gone, Isabel and I really missed her. It's like already we started out with this absence of this woman that we really loved and had, at that point, developed this unit with. The three of us got very close.”\n\n“I wish I could say that it was some sort of director prowess and that I was like, ‘I'll do this to them,’” Tremblay interjects. “But it just happened that way. Hauli didn't really return to our set after the first two weeks until we shot the night of the powwow, and then she was there… It was just this perfect setting for Isabelle and Lily to do that last dance.”\n\nGladstone was admittedly nervous about the dance sequence. They recall, “I was most nervous about the dance and the powwow. Ironically, Isabella and I are both ballet trained, and I did a little bit of dance when I was younger, but I did women's traditional [a different dance style than fancy dance.]”\n\nThe dance itself actually has two different styles of fancy dance, one newer and one more traditional. Gladstone says, “When I was talking to [Gray] about forming the character of Jax, I asked, ‘Could Jax maybe be a grass dancer, do a men's style dance?’ because when I was little, and my dad would put on powwow music, my instinct was to dance grass dance [which is a] men's style.” In the Blackfeet language, there are not gendered pronouns. Still, there are gendered verbs, so taking on a “men’s style” wasn’t a stretch for Gladstone who uses she/they pronouns in English. She recalls talking to Gray about doing a men’s style in the film; Gray educated them on the history of old-style fancy dance and how it was originally danced by a Ponca woman who wanted to dance in a way closer to a men’s style. “She explained to me that the origin came from a woman doing it the way a man does,” Gladstone recalls, which influenced Gladstone’s dancing choices.\n\nThis choice is essential for the understanding of larger themes in the film. “I love that our characters, just by nature of dancing two different women's forms, talk about two different women’s ways of expressing themselves in society.” Gladstone says, “It spoke to this deeper origin story of the dance, which shows that our cultures are fluid, ever-changing, and adopt new ways. You don't shame that woman for wanting to dance like a man. You create a new dance.”\n\nThe powwow scene as a whole, dance included, feels wildly authentic. The Covid pandemic made it too unsafe for the cast and crew to film on location at a powwow. “We couldn't just go to a powwow, so we actually had to throw a powwow,” Tremblay recalls.\n\nDue to the long film schedule, Tremblay worried about the extras being excited to stay at the scene. She and Alise asked for money from the producers to buy raffle items, including a TV to help entice the extras. Tremblay even received a call from her mother after seeing a Facebook post from a woman who won the TV. “It goes to show that when you're making films about your own community, sometimes you can make it easier on yourself by knowing how to manipulate them into staying overnight with a big screen TV,” Tremblay jokes. “Powwow folks are no strangers to staying up all night and dancing. It's a summer season. People were there to dance, and they danced.”\n\nFancy Dance, a Confluential Films and Significant Productions/AUM Group production, is produced by Deidre Backs, Tremblay, Heather Rae, Nina Yang Bongiovi and Tommy Oliver, with Bird Runningwater, Gladstone, Forest Whitaker and Charlotte Koh serving as executive producers. The film is available in select theaters starting June 21 and streaming on Apple TV+ globally on June 28, 2024."
