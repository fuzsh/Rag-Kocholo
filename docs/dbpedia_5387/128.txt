Although he was not capped for England, in this historical context, Bath can fairly consider him to be the Club’s first ‘British Lion.’ F C Belson had been a Bath player from 1894-95 through to the 1898-99 season. He had left Clifton College at age 16 and played for the Clifton club. He had also reinforced the Bristol side on a number of occasions.

Tom Blanchard was the first Avonvale player to represent Bath and with his brother played a large part in the founding of the local village club Avonvale RFC. The earliest record of Blanchards on the rugby scene was in a game between Widcombe Institute and Weston School in March 1882 when Tom turned out as a forward for Widcombe. Tom’s playing talent developed first as a fly-half and then as a three-quarter. His skill as a player earned him recognition with Bath who he represented on many occasions in the 1880s. In a match on the 7th February 1885 he played as fly-half with his brother Fred on the wing. The Blanchard family can be traced back to medieval times in Bathford and appear in the stained-glass window of the church depicting a Crusader and his wife bearing the family name.

BATH FOOTBALLER’S FAREWELL

WISHING ‘BON VOYAGE TO ARCHIE HOPE

Mr Archibald Hope was sailing from Liverpool to return to his home in Vancouver. His imminent departure was commemorated with a smoking concert held at the Red House, New Bond Street. A full musical programme was arranged, with the presence of the “Elite Entertainers.”

In response to a toast to his health, Mr. Hope spoke of his fondness for Rugby: “explaining that he had removed from Saskatchewan to Vancouver, a distance of 2,000 miles, because he read in the papers that Vancouver possessed nine Rugby clubs. But when he got there the war began, and out of the nine teams exactly four men were left, all the others going overseas.” Along with his brother Philip, he had been most happy at Bath and he would greatly miss playing on the Rec. The assembled company wished their friend ‘Godspeed,’ “and hoped he would be a support to the old game abroad. An upright Englishman did credit wherever he was.” (Loud cheers)

“The departing player and the Chairman were enthusiastically toasted and ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow,’ and ‘Auld Lang Syne,’ brought a joyous and fraternal evening to a close.”

Adapted from the BATH CHRONICLE reporting on a memorable ‘send-off’ for their popular Captain and loyal servant, Philip Palmer Hope- Monday 6th March 1919 at the Red House.
