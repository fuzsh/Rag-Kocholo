        "text": "Share this: |\n\n(Live Action News) On December 16, 2023, at age 55, Reverend Dean Nelson (born June 28, 1968) passed away from cancer with his family at his side. Dean hailed from Marshall, Virginia, and graduated from the University of Virginia. At the time of his death, Nelson was an ordained Bishop with Wellington Boone Ministries, and Chairman of the Frederick Douglass Foundation and the Douglass Leadership Institute. He was the Vice President of Government Relations at Human Coalition and one of the most influential voices in Black, conservative, and Christian circles. He is survived by his wife, Julia, and their three children — Brandon, Amani, and Michaela.\n\nIn his youth, Nelson was introduced to his hero, anti-slavery abolitionist Frederick Douglass, through a comic book. His mother brought home a collection of Black history comics that recounted the tales of Harriet Tubman, George Washington Carver, Sojourner Truth, and others. One figure stood out from among twenty or so books. Nelson was captivated by Douglass’ life. Douglass was a stalwart fighter against the horrible evil in his day — the institutional enslavement of Africans. Dean Nelson followed Douglass’ leadership, becoming a champion for the ending of abortion.\n\nNelson’s sister, Aislyn Epperson, said in a post, “Dean stood for righteousness. Nothing more, nothing less. In everything he has ever done, every cause he has been a champion for, it is because of God’s holy word.”\n\nHer words echo one of Nelson’s favorite quotes from Frederick Douglass: “I have one great political idea… the best expression of it, I have found in the Bible. It is in substance, ‘Righteousness exalteth a nation – sin is a reproach to any people.'”\n\nIn the often harsh realms of politics, Dean Nelson remained a tender-hearted, kind, and humble presence. His dear friend and fellow Black pro-life leader Will Ford said of him, “He’s one of the few that knew how to be in the political arena, but not of it. The intellect and wisdom he carried set him at some of the highest levels in the marketplace of ideas in our nation.”\n\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\n\nNelson also had a compassionate father’s heart. His brother in-law, Pastor Darrian Summerville, called Nelson a mentor and spiritual father. Nelson had discipled Darrian and performed the marriage ceremony for Nelson’s sister Greta and him. Nelson’s spiritual son and leader of the Black Conservative Federation, Diante Johnson, shared how Nelson was an unwavering supporter to him and a constant presence in his life.\n\nOn a personal note, Dean Nelson’s humility was one of the things I treasured most about him. He interacted with such a servant’s heart that one might not know he counseled U.S. presidents and powerful leaders. I met Dean Nelson in my 20s while living outside D.C., interning with a pro-life ministry. One day he and his spiritual son Marcus Harris visited our base. Meeting them was the first encounter I had with other Black pro-life people. It was refreshing to see strong Black men opposing the targeting of our people by the abortion industry.\n\nIt’s been over 15 years since that meeting, and his influence in my life never waned. He remained a trusted voice, a source of wisdom and guidance. My husband Sean said, “I was always excited to see Dean when we went to D.C.” I relay his sentiments here because there aren’t enough words to describe the impact he had on our family. I participated in numerous events with fellow Black pro-life leaders Walter and Lori Hoye, Catherine Davis, Alveda King, and others who are all also deeply grieving the loss of Dean Nelson. He was at the tip of the spear for Black pro-life activism in our nation, and his loss is irreplaceable.\n\nHarris said of Bishop Nelson, “I, like many young Black Christians in D.C., owe our success to Dean Nelson. Not only this but his contribution to the black, pro-life movement is one of legend.”\n\nGrowing up in a home without a dad, Marcus didn’t know how a Godly man serves his family. Marcus connected with Dean through a college internship and was later invited to live with Dean and his wife Julia at their home. Marcus lived with the Nelsons free of charge for over two years. Later, Dean and his wife Julia mentored Marcus and his wife Cathy in their marriage. Today Marcus is a father of four, devoted husband of 14 years, and the Director of Prayer Initiatives for Alliance Defending Freedom. He is a living witness to the power of Nelson’s mentorship and friendship.\n\nReverend Nelson’s leadership aided the largest Black Pentecostal denomination in the nation, the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), in reaffirming its pro-life stance. The denomination’s statement from 2022 says, “COGIC has always been pro-life in doctrine, but today we reaffirm our stance and will continue to be visible and vocal on this matter.” COGIC reaffirmed its strategic collaboration with Human Coalition, plans to open a pregnancy and continuum of care clinic, and is developing housing and opportunities for pregnant women and families. The fruit of their reaffirmed stance and future plans are birthed from countless seeds Bishop Nelson planted, watered, and tended to.\n\nIn November, the Douglass Leadership institute gathered community, faith, and civic leaders together for their “Our Faith, Our Family, Our Freedom Conference.” The event focused on finding solutions to strengthen the Black family, support criminal justice reform, and secure economic and educational opportunities for all. Dean Nelson knew that in order to see babies saved and families flourish, we must address the root issues impacting our communities.\n\nNelson’s dear friend and pro-life leader Ryan Bomberger called him a connector and a tireless champion for life, family, and faith. He recounted how Nelson and Arnold Culbreath were the first pro-life men to encourage him at his first rally on the White House lawn. Culbreath was a right hand man to Nelson, walking alongside him faithfully as the Director of Ministry at the Douglass Leadership Institute.\n\nIn the days and years to come, much will be said about Reverend Dean Nelson, a lion-hearted man and gift to our nation. Earlier this year he said of himself, “I am a blessed man. At 55 I have the best siblings on the planet, a beautiful and dedicated wife, a great father, three amazing children and the best friends and cousins a man could ask for.”\n\nTweet This: In the days and years to come, much will be said about Reverend Dean Nelson, a lion-hearted man and gift to our nation.\n\nLet us keep Reverend Nelson’s family in our prayers. Thank you for your sacrifice and service, Bishop Dean Nelson. May we seek to follow your example by never wavering in the fight for life."
