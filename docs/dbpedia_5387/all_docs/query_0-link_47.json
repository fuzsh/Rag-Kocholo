        "text": "FORMER 10 SQUADRON MEMBERS WHO PASSED AWAY\n\nPRIOR TO 1 JANUARY 2023\n\n(most recent are at the top - scroll down for earlier dates)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12 December 2022\n\nRobert A. Brown of Chippenham, Wilts - SON OF, 10 SQN VC10 CAPTAIN AND LATER 241 OCU & ATEU, SQN LDR ERIC BROWN\n\nRob Brown joined the Association in January 2022 in order to continue his family connection to No 10 Sqn. His father Eric, was well known to all who flew the VC10 in the 1970s and 80s as being a 10 Squadron captain and then a Training Captain on No 241 OCU and later an Examiner with ATEU (Air Transport Examining Unit) based at Upavon.\n\nIn writing to Robert in early December 2022 we were advised by his wife Christine that Rob had been seriously ill and had sadly passed away on 3 November 2022.\n\nOur heartfelt sympathies go out, not only to Christine but also to Rob's son Oliver and his father Eric, now living in a Chippenham care home.\n\nRIP Robert\n\n17 November 2022\n\nPeter Frederick 'Andy’ Andrews (1924 - 2022) WW2 HALIFAX WIRELESS OPERATOR AND PoW\n\nWith great sadness we learned of the death of former 10 Sqn Halifax Air Gunner ‘Andy’ Andrews, who died on 8 November 2022at the grand age of 98.\n\nAndy and his Halifax crew were shot down over Denmark in February 1945 after a mine-laying mission near Stetin on the Baltic. He was made a PoW and spent the rest of the war in Stalag7A at Moosburg near Munich. After returning to the UK he was eventually demobbed and subsequently became an upholsterer, to eventually run his own business in Tonbridge, Kent and refusing to retire until in his late 70's.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Cath and his children, Jaqueline, Katrina and Brett. - We send them all our sincere condolences for their loss of such a fine man. Andy did much throughout the rest of his life, to support the Royal Air Force and was also keen that schoolchildren should be made aware of the part that his generation had played in allowing them their present-day freedoms.\n\nAndy was a founder member and staunch supporter of our Association, being a regular attendee at most of the Association’s functions. His presence and support will be sadly missed and he was especially remembered this year, just a few days after his death, on Remembrance Sunday at the 10 Squadron Memorial, Melbourne, Yorks.\n\nAndy's funeral was held on 1 December 2022 at The Kent & Sussex Crematorium, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with his coffin being draped in his honour by the 10 Squadron Association Flag. A wake was held afterwards at The Legion, Priory Road, Tonbridge, Kent\n\nWe offer our sincere condolences to his family, Jaqueline and Peter, Katrina and Brett.\n\nTo see a copy of the Order of Service at his funeral please click on his the 'RIP Andy' above the picture of him below, which was taken in a 10 Sqn Voyager on a trip to RAF Brize Norton.\n\nRIP Andy\n\nThe following words from Ann Bihan describe Andy and tell of him as a remarkable man:\n\nIt was with a heavy heart that I received the sad news that Andy Andrews had passed away recently. We all thought a lot of Andy and always called him our ‘treasured friend’. We will miss his wonderful stories, his sharp memory and his love of life. I always thought he would go on forever.\n\nOn Sunday I found the two minutes silence very poignant. I thought of Andy, Jim Petre and the crew of LV881 and all of that wonderful generation who are no longer with us. The passing of the years breaks the physical links with the very special men and women who served on the Squadron. I feel privileged to have known some of them through The Association. I had spoken to Andy within the last couple of months and he was so looking forward to the reunion in May. He also always remembered with great pride being ‘The Honoured Guest’ at the Battle of Britain Dinner at Brize Norton and how honoured he himself had been and how much it meant to him.\n\nOn the 14th February 1945 Andy's crew were tasked with dropping mines in the Bay of Stettin, Germany when their aircraft, Halifax MZ 793 ZA-XA, was shot down over Denmark by a German fighter. Three of the crew including Jim Petre escaped to Sweden with the help of the SOE and Danish Resistance. Two crew members were lost with the aircraft. Andy and Stanley Chaderton, the Bomb Aimer, were taken POW and sent to Stalag V11A Moosburg on the outskirts of Munich, until the end of the war. They experienced depravation and inhuman treatment from both civilians and military guards on the sixteen-day march from Nuremberg to Moosburg.\n\nAndy spent a lot of his later years visiting schools, hoping that it would make them have a better understanding of what he had experienced as young aircrew during the war.\n\nI have attached a photograph of Andy [above] on the flight deck of the last Voyager trailing flight we went on. I took him up to the flight deck where he sat recalling his Halifax days to the crew. The captain invited him to stay on the flight deck for the approach and landing into Brize. He really appreciated their kindness to him.\n\nAndy signed a copy of a book for me called ‘The Crash’, published by Friends of The Danish Resistance which recalls the story of the loss of MZ 793, the evasion of three of the crew members by the Danish Resistance and the Imprisonment of Andy and Stan Chaderton. The five crew members visited Denmark every year until it became difficult for them to travel.\n\nAnn Bihan\n\nFormer 10 Sqn AQM/ALM (VC10)\n\nSusanne Pescott provides us with this link to an IBCC interview done with Andy :\n\nhttps://ibccdigitalarchive.lincoln.ac.uk/omeka/collections/document/9225\n\nWe were later informed by his son-in-law Peter, that Andy’s ashes were interred in the Memorial Garden of the RAF Chapel Biggin Hill in a short service there on Monday 20th March 2023. This privilege is only granted to those who have served in the Royal Air Force and an entry in the Chapel’s Memorial Book will ensure that Andy has a lasting memorial in a book full of history.\n\nA photo of the Book’s entry is shown below.\n\n4 November 2022\n\nSqn Ldr James Stanley (Jim) King - Feb1944 - Oct 2022 VC10 SENGO (see below)\n\nAssociation member, Jim King sadly passed away on 21 October 2022 and his funeral was held in St Mary's Church, Church Green, Witney, Oxon on Tuesday 15 November 2022.\n\nJim joined the RAF as an apprentice at RAF Halton and served in the RAF for 35 years. During his training, he was a member of the RAF Halton Pipe Band.\n\nHe became the SENGO (Senior Engineering Officer) on 10 Sqn VC10s for the period 1990 - 1994. On retiring from the Service, he lived not far from Brize Norton in Witney and soon became a Town Councillor to later be appointed the Mayor of the town in 2015. A dedicated Manchester United supporter, Jim and made frequent journeys up the M5/M6 to Old Trafford for home games there.\n\nRIP Jim\n\nOctober 2022\n\nThomas G. Dobie FORMER 10 SQN DAKOTA PILOT AT POONA, INDIA AND EMINENT DOCTOR OF AVIATION MEDICINE\n\nObituaries were published in The Times and The Telegraph on Thursday 2nd November for Gp Cpt Thomas G. Dobie (Retd).\n\nThomas Dobie became a doctor after WW2 and led the research into aircrew motion-sickness at the Institute of Aviation Medicine at Farnborough before moving on and becoming an expert in that field for NASA in Florida and later in New Orleans.\n\nDuring WW2 he flew as a pilot in Coastal Command and joined 10 Squadron on Dakotas in Poona just after the war had ended in the Far East before his eventual demob.\n\nAfter his studies to become a doctor he rejoined the RAF to head the Farnborough Institute leaving later to extend his influence in the USA.\n\nClick on his name below to see the obituary for him as published in the RAF NEWS on Friday 7 October 2022.\n\nThomas G. Dobie\n\n29 September 2022\n\nPamela (Pam) Margaret Dent (1934 - 2022)\n\nFORMER COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE 10 SQN ASSOCIATION ON ITS INITIAL FORMATION\n\nWith much sadness we learnt of the Autumn passing of Pam Dent, the very first 10 Sqn Association Secretary and Treasurer, following its formation in 1984.\n\nShe had been the loving wife of the Association founding Chairman, the late Doug Dent who had been a Hailfax bomber engine fitter at RAF Melbourne during WW2 and Pam was awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Association in 2018 by the late President, Gerry Bunn for her services to the Association over many years: Pam's husband Doug had previously passed away in 2005 but she had nevertheless remained in touch since that time.\n\nPam passed away aged 88, on Sunday 25th September 2022 at her home in Barnoldswick, West Yorkshire, surrounded by her family. At her funeral, which was held at the Skipton, West Yorks Crematorium, her coffin was draped in the 10 Squadron Association Flag as a sign of our great respect for all she had done for us. The lovely service, attended by her family and friends was conducted by celebrant Scarlett Kolavinsky, on Monday 17th October and was followed by a wake at The Old Stone Trough, Kelbrook, close to Barnoldswick.\n\nA Yorkshire girl, born and bred, Pam's ashes will later to be taken to her childhood home town of Scarborough where they will join those of her parents.\n\nClick on her name below to see the Order of Service celebrating her life.\n\nOur condolences go to Pam's two daughters, Elaine and Lynne and all the extended family.\n\nPamela Margaret Dent - 'Pam'\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMessage to Elaine & Lynne from past Chairman Mike O’Donovan: it sums up Pam Dent to the letter.\n\nI became the Chairman of 10 Sqn Association after David Mole, remained so for more than 10 years, being succeeded by Mike Westwood. I did not know your father but I do remember your mother Pam very well.\n\nShe was always the most helpful secretary of the Association, reminding me of every event, and whispering the name and background of the WW2 10 Sqn Association members if my memory stumbled. Pam was always very supportive of the 10 Sqn monthly lunches at “The Bombers” and later, when the venue changed after the Blacksmith’s Arms closed.\n\nI always enjoyed her company. She knew the history of those who had flown from Melbourne in WW2, those who had been POWs, and those who had struggled after the war. Pam always enjoyed humour and she was the stalwart of the 10 Sqn reunions and our Remembrance Sunday Service and Parade at Melbourne.\n\nI shall miss her cheerful conversation, especially at the Remembrance Day lunches.\n\nI’m sure that our founding President, the late Gerry Bunn would agree with me.\n\nRIP Pam\n\nMike (Michael O’Donovan)\n\namended on 18 September\n\nDanny Latham Master Engineer VC10\n\nOn 4th September we heard of the passing of former VC10 flight engineer Danny Latham who was a much-liked and highly experienced VC10 flight engineer of the 1970 - 80s era.\n\nDan , plus a glass of Cypriot Keo\n\nDan's funeral took place on Monday 19th September at 12:00 noon at the South Oxfordshire Crematorium, Garford, Oxfordshire\n\nThis was to be on a most memorable date coinciding, albeit at a slightly later time, with the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth ll, held on the same morning in Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nA wake for Dan was held afterwards at The Plough Inn, Alvescot, Oxfordshire and donations were made in his memory to Prostate Cancer UK.\n\n****\n\nOur condolences go to Dan's wife Margaret, daughter Amanda and all his family.\n\nRIP Dan\n\n14 July 2022\n\nBrian Kingscote (1935 -2022) Master Air Loadmaster – 10 Sqn VC10 Loadmaster 1979 - 86\n\nWe are sad to learn that Brian Kingscote passed away recently, after a long illness.\n\nBrian joined the RAF as an Administrative Apprentice at RAF St Athan and we are advised that he became an AQM (Air Quartermaster) in 1954 under an old scheme which preceded the days when a Brevet was awarded.\n\nHe completed the ‘formal’ course as an ALM in1966 and his service record includes the following squadrons and approximate dates of service in each:\n\n53 Sqn 1955/56, 216 Sqn 1957/58, 47 Sqn 1966/67, 24 Sqn 1969/71, 241 OCU / 10 Squadron / ASCEU 1979/86.\n\n******\n\nBrian's funeral was on Tuesday 26th July at St Bartholomew’s Church, Royal Wootton Bassett, Swindon.\n\nThis was followed by a private family cremation at the North Wilts Crematorium, Royal Wootton Bassett and a wake was held later at the Conservative Club in the town.\n\nOur condolences go to Brian’s family and friends.\n\n.RIP Brian\n\n19 June 2022\n\nJ.

A few years later in 2015 you are, not too quietly, celebrating your 90th birthday with friends, at a party venue in Bracknell, Berks, when two smartly-dressed gentlemen gate-crash the affair.\n\nOne, dressed in a suit, is a retired RAF wing commander who claims to be Wg Cdr Mike Westwood, OBE RAF (Retd), the Chairman of the 10 Squadron Association and the other, dressed in the uniform of an RAF wing commander is Wg Cdr Jamie Osborne who was then the current Officer Commanding No 10 Squadron based in Oxfordshire at RAF Brize Norton. They both wish you a Happy 90th Birthday and convince you that you really should join your old squadron’s association.\n\nIt was to be the beginning of a relatively short but nevertheless sweet, relationship between Harry Hodgson and the 10 Squadron Association…………\n\n*****\n\nHarry Hodgson was a member of 10 Squadron’s ground crew during WW2 and following his training at RAF Cardington in 1943 he was based at RAF Melbourne in East Yorkshire. He served as ground crew on the Squadron’s ‘Aircraft Repair & Inspection Flight’ which entailed being outside in all weathers ‘patching up’ the Squadron’s Halifax bombers to make them serviceable for their next operation. At the end of the war, after the Squadron transferred to Transport Command in May 1945, Harry deployed with the them to Poona in India where he worked on Dakotas and also Spitfires.\n\nHarry was well-known on the Squadron at Melbourne as an artist and sign writer, being responsible for many ‘nose art’ images which adorned the Squadron’s Halifaxes. .......as he said himself, “ I loved painting the pictures on the aircraft.......especially the ladies.” The names of those whom he used as models has faded into the mists of time !\n\nIn later life, Harry worked for the John Lewis Partnership for many years and was also a very keen cyclist to such an extent that he even designed some of his own mounts. He celebrated his 95th birthday quietly at home in 2020 having been in hospital earlier that year with Coronavirus but, true fighter that he was, he bravely pulled through although was later still a little weak. He was awarded an Honorary Life Member’s Certificate of the Association that year.\n\nIt is with great sadness that we now report his passing on Saturday 9 April 2022.\n\nHarry attending a veterans' event at the Bomber Command Memorial, Green Park, London\n\nHarry’s charming carer Jackie Clark always escorted Harry on his outings to attend Squadron and RAF events and, in the abscence of immediate family members, our sympathies go to her at the sad news of his passing.\n\nRIP Harry\n\n16 March 2022\n\nDouglas Frank Newham, LVO, DFC\n\n(November 1921 - March 2022)\n\n10 Sqn Navigation Leader on Halifax and Dakota (Melbourne and India/Burma 1944-46)\n\nSenior Operations Manager BOAC/BA London Heathrow\n\nWith great sadness we announce the death of Douglas Newham at his home in Cumbria on Monday 14 March 2022.\n\nAfter being awarded the DFC in WW2 for his duties, Douglas was later to support the RAF and its good causes throughout his life. He was particularly prominent and proud to become the President of the Cockermouth, Cumbria, Branch of the RAFA.\n\nThe good causes that Douglas supported will be the poorer for his passing.\n\nBorn in Edgware, North London in 1921, Doug was just 18 years old at the outset of WW2. He was in a reserved occupation working as a technician for the Post Office and became involved in the very early days of aircraft radio direction finding and radar trials which were being secretly attempted on the East Coast. Released from the Post Office, he joined the RAF and after gaining his Observer's brevet (later to become a known as 'Navigators' one), he was to become an observer on a Welington bomber squadron and was crewed up with his later friend Canadian Bill Harris. Surviving a full tour of Ops on that aircraft, albeit losing many friends in the process, all accounting towards the sad totals of Bomber Command's losses, Doug was then screened during his next posting as an instructor on No 10 OTU at RAF Abingdon.\n\nBack on an operartional tour Doug joined 10 Sqn in late 1944 at Melbourne Yorkshire as the Squadron's Navigation Leader in the rank of flight lieutenant. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in September 1945 for his wartime duties.\n\nA tour in India after the war, when the Squadron had become part of Transport Command with its Dakota circraft, was followed by a return to the UK and later employment with BOAC. In later years whilst working as a senior operations manager at BOAC/British Airways, Douglas became responsible for the detailed planning of Royal Flights. His work was duly acknowledged by Her Majesty The Queen in the New Year's Honours List of 1969, when he received her personal award to become a Member of the Royal Victorian Order. (Its title name was later changed to Lieutenant) Hence Douglas bore the initials LVO after his name in addition to the DFC. Doug's first pilot on Wellingtons was Bill Harris, a Canadian and they had become great friends. After the war, Bill's sister Julienne visited the UK and met up with Doug. They were later to marry in North London in 1951.\n\nDoug's cremation service was a private, family affair but later, a separate Memorial service was held on 11 April 2022. The service was conducted by Doug's friend and the vicar of St Kentigern's Church, Caldbeck, Rev Geoffrey Hine. Upbeat and light-hearted, Doug's personality shone throughout the service, especially when those present were reminded of his various deeds and accomplishments throughout his varied and interesting life.\n\nAn Order of Service is available for viewers to read here by clicking:\n\nDoug Newham's Memorial Service\n\nA live broadcast of the service was transmitted worldwide on an internet webcast via Youtube and enabled Doug's family and many friends throughout the world, especially those in Canada and Australia, to see the weblink.\n\nPosted below, it will be viewable live or for 14 days after Monday's service.\n\nSee: https://youtu.be/QrfSW9a6Evo to watch the Memorial Service.\n\nAfter the service, those present enjoyed a fine array of locally produced snacks and refreshments in the nearby Oddfellows Arms in Calbeck and found their many lives were linked by one common feature - the honour of knowing Douglas Newham. At Doug's own request, those attending had been asked to refrain from wearing sombre clothing: - in Doug’s own words before his passing, “The objective should be to celebrate the wonderful life that I have been so privileged to enjoy”.\n\nHis wishes were indeed followed and his life celebrated as he would have wished.\n\nDonations in his memory were made to the Northern Fells Group (NFG), which provides support in many forms to local folk who are ill at remote homes in Cumbria. It was very dear to Doug's heart especially during the years when his late wife Julienne, was in poor health.\n\nShould you wish to make a donation please contact NFG via their web page:\n\nhttps://www.northernfellsgroup.org.uk/about/contact-us/.\n\nMeanwhile our sympathies go to Doug's family in the UK, Canada and Australia.\n\nRIP Doug - We salute you.\n\nAs a navigator, an officer and a gentleman, you certainly knew how 'To Hit The Mark'\n\n15 March 2022\n\nNorman Appleton (GAvA)\n\nHonorary Life Member and former WW2 Lancaster Air Gunner:\n\nNever on 10 Sqn....... BUT.......\n\nDesigner of the 10 Squadron Memorial at Melbourne, Yorks\n\nWith much sadness, we learn that Norman Appleton aged 96, passed away on the afternoon of Friday 11th March 2022.\n\nThe funeral will be held on 7 April at a location to be advised.\n\nNorman was made an honorary Life Member of the 10 Sqn Association and yet never served on 10 Sqn, having been a Lancaster aircraft Air Gunner at the very end of WW2. He became the vice-president of the Ryedale RAFA based in Malton, Yorks near where he lived.\n\nHe is however best known to us all by being the designer and architect of the 10 Squadron Memorial at the entrance to the Squadron's WW2 base at Melbourne, near Elvington, Yorks. The Memorial's inauguration on Sunday 15th September 1985 was, as Norman would later say, one of the proudest moments in his long life.\n\nIn addition, as a member of the Guild of Aviation Artists, he was further well known to us for his lovely paintings, some depicting 10 Sqn's WW2 Whitley and Halifax bombers. Norman also kindly produced some wonderful pen & ink drawings specifically for our Association's use as the Chapter Headings for the Sqn Centenary Book 'From Brooklands to Brize', written by Ian Macmillan and published in 2015.\n\nNorman and his wife Joyce lived in Norton near Malton, Nth Yorks, not far from Melbourne, and they were a staunch attendees of our annual Remembrance Service at 'his' Memorial and they would later join us for lunch at the Allerthorpe pub, after the services.\n\nOur sincere condolences go to Joyce, his family and all his Ryedale RAFA chums.\n\nFurther details will follow when known.\n\nThe Association's first Chairman Doug Dent, thanks Norman for his artwork on a wooden plaque in the late 1980s.\n\nHalifax Mk lll landing at Melbourne by Norman Appleton 1987\n\n31 January 2022\n\nRobert 'Mac' McClements\n\nWW2 Halifax Air Gunner and founder Association Member\n\nMac, who was a founder member of the 10 Sqn Association in 1984, sadly passed away on 30 January 2022.\n\nA private family-only Service was held on 28 February and was available for all to see via an on-line link.

His presence was always accompanied by his charming wife Iris, a former WW2 Royal Observer Corps plotter whom he had met during their wartime service.\n\nBorn in Belfast Mac had worked at Harland and Wolff before volunteering to join the RAF. He completed 38 missions as a gunner in his 10 Sqn Halifax ZA-V at RAF Melbourne, becoming a Warrant Officer by the end of the war. He met his wife to be, Iris, when she was serving in the Royal Observer Corps in York.\n\nAfter the war they started a garage business in Wakefield which Mac ran successfully until his retirement. In 1984 he was a founder of 10 Squadron Association and as a regular representative was proud to later become an Honorary Life Member. In later years he took great pleasure in the belated recognition of the role of the RAF and as a guest of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.\n\nHe was one of the ‘Bomber Barons’ who met weekly at Sherburn Aero Club and in 2017 he was awarded the French Legion d’Honneur medal, at a service at the Yorkshire Air Museum, Elvington. Mac had a full and active life which he enjoyed to the very end.\n\nHe died at home, unexpectedly yet peacefully.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Iris, daughter Gillian, son Robert, grandchildren; Laurie, Nicola and Oliver and great-grandchildren; Henry and Theo.\n\nOur condolences and sympathy go to Iris and the rest of their family.\n\n(Mac : Dec 1924 - Jan 2022)\n\n2 January 2022\n\nJohn Halstead 1980's VC10 Pilot and later Virgin Airlines and CAA Examiner\n\nJohn Halstead sadly passed away on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2021\n\nFlt Lt John Halstead - (August 1986)\n\nThe funeral was held 13 January at The East Riding Crematorium, Octon, Driffield, Yorks.\n\nJohn, aged about 75 yrs old or so, lost a relatively short fight against cancer on Christmas Eve.

Hayhoe (31 Mar 1938 - 15 Dec 2021)\n\n10 Sqn VC10 Ground Engineer, later Flight Engineer with BOAC/BA\n\nFormer VC10 ground engineer and Association member Ted Hayhoe aged 83, passed away peacefully on 15 December 2021 and his funeral was held on 29 December 2021.\n\nBorn in London 1938, Ted was the youngest child of the family and, at the tender age of 15, he joined the RAF as an apprentice.\n\nIn the early days of 10 Squadron's VC10 operations in the late 1960s, Ted was a sergeant Engine Fitter who would go down route with VC10s in the Ground Engineer role to supervise the aircraft's refuelling and servicing. He later applied for the similar job of Ground Engineer with BOAC, having meanwhile met his furure wife Gill, née Horley, who was a Sergeant Quartermaster on the Squadron, who had been on the very first VC10 course. However, unknown to Ted, the airline had been contacted by 10 Sqn VC10 captain Brian Taylor who, in appreciating Ted's qualities, recommended him instead as being more suitable for the role of Air Engineer.\n\nAccepted by the airline as a Flight Engineer, Ted flew on VC10s, Tristars and Boeing 747s in his subsequent career. He and Gill lived in Dorset, where Ted enjoyed sailing, listening to classical music, and travelling across the world. In his retirement he kept himself busy with gardening, model making, trains and bowling.\n\nA loving husband, he is survived by Gill and their children Julia, Steven, Kevin as well as grandchildren Nyla, Ben and Tara.\n\nTed had been ill for several years and was regrettably unable to attend recent Association Reunions. Before Christmas 2021 he went into hospital for a check up but unfortunately, passed away quite suddenly, which was naturally a great shock to Gill after their 54 years together.\n\nGill informs us, \"My dear son came over from USA to help, then tested positive to Covid so we both had to isolate. This meant a change of funeral plans etc. Everything was chaos so some people did not get informed of his death or funeral plans. Fortunately, on Xmas Eve the NHS informed me that I was Covid-negative and could be ‘freed’ that day. So I was able to say goodbye to Ted, and attend his funeral on 29th December.\"\n\nOur condolences and symapathies of course go to Gill, herself an Association member and former aircrew with 216 Sqn's VIP Comets, prior to joining 10 Sqn, together with all the family.\n\nRIP Ted\n\n( with BOAC/BA )\n\nDecember 2021\n\nJim Wyld Squadron Leader Navigator\n\nThe Association has received 3rd-hand information about the passing of a former 10 Squadron navigator (aircraft type unknown) who has recently passed away. Since Jim Wyld was not an Association member, all we can say is that if anyone who lives in the Cambridge area knew Jim and wishes to attend his funeral it will be held on:\n\n17 December 2021 at 1400 hrs at the Cam Valley Chapel Crematorium.\n\n(The Crematorium might be able to give more details if contacted)\n\nRIP Jim\n\nNovember 2021\n\nDudley Charles Mills Squadron Leader VC10 Navigator\n\nWith much sadness we are informed that Dudley Mills passed away on 18 November. A memorial service was held on 3rd December at St Edward's Church, Stow on the Wold.\n\nDudley's daughter Janice will be letting us have more details about her father's life from the planned funeral eulogy which her son James and her brother Roger prepared.\n\nMeanwhile our condolences go to all the members of the family at this sad time.\n\nAnd who can forget Dudley's lovely 'tache'? RIP Dudley.\n\nDudley, at the May 2012 10 Sqn Association Reunion\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nPeter Thompson Squadron Leader VC10 Navigator\n\nLimited information has been received that former 10 Sqn VC10 navigator Sqn Ldr Peter Thompson has died in Oxfordshire.\n\nPeter's funeral was held in the Banbury Crematorium, OX16 1ST on\n\nFriday 8 October 2021.\n\nMourners attended the Moon & Sixpence, in Hamwell village afterwards.\n\nPeter, who prior to 10 Squadron did an exchange posting with the USAF based in Guam, will long be remembered for his determination and achievement in forming the RAF Brize Norton Flying Club in 1979. Enabling non-aircrew RAF personnel and their families to learn to fly at lower-than-market rates to obtain PPLs (Private Pilots Licences), the Club continues to thrive over forty years later.\n\nPeter will be long remembered by those who flew as instructors in the Club on its two Piper Cherokee aircraft whilst also being crewed with him on 10 Squadron on occasions when he flew as a VC10 navigator. After retirement from the RAF Peter worked for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\n\nOur condolences go to Peter's wife Sophie and the rest of his family.\n\nRIP Peter\n\n23 MAY 2021\n\nJP Allan 10 Sqn VC10 captain on exchange from the United Staes Air Force - 1980s\n\nWe have just heard from the USA that Col 'JP' Allan USAF who as a major, was an American exchange officer serving on 10 Squadron during the 1980s has sadly passed away in the United States.\n\nJP Allan [no-one ever knew his first names] entered Officer’s Training School in December 1969, calling himself a 90-day wonder, and was awarded his pilot wings in April 1970. In 1972, on a tour in Vietnam flying the Cessna O-2 Skymaster (successor to the ‘Bird Dog’), he was to be awarded the USAF DFC for actions in August that year. Back in the USA he was based at Travis AFB, California, midway between the state capital Sacramento and San Francisco, flying the huge C5 Galaxy aircraft there between 1973 and 1978. A move to Altus AFB in Oklahoma followed when JP became a C5 pilot instructor until 1982. Having by then been in that role for several years he was an ideal choice to be selected for an exchange posting to the RAF and came to the UK with his family to join 10 Squadron in 1983 after his VC10 course. Returning to the USA in 1985 he returned to Altus as an Instructor/Examiner pilot on the C5, becoming his squadron’s ADO (Assistant Director of Operations) from 1986 - 92. JP then left the Air Force to become a simulator instructor with Flight Safety International, contracted to the USAF, until he retired in 2007.\n\nOur condolences go to JP’s wife Daphne and all his family.\n\n'JP' was well-liked by all who flew with him on the VC10 and he did much to maintain the 'special relationship' that the RAF has with its NATO colleagues across the Pond. - He was an ideal choice for an exchange oficer.\n\nWg Cdr Len Marshall when OC10 in 1985, bids JP Allan farewell after his last flight with 10 Sqn before returning to the USA in late 1985\n\nUSAF C5 Galaxy\n\nRIP JP\n\n12 May 2021\n\nRobert (Bob) Gerard Hunter 10 Squadron WW2 Halifax Ground Mechanic 1943 -45\n\nPat Hunter of Epsom, advises us that her much-loved husband Bob passed away peacefully in his sleep on 11 May 2021.\n\nBob was very proud to have been on 10 Squadron and had been an Association member for many years. He and Pat always enjoyed the Association reunions and other events which they both attended until relatively recently, making fond memories for them both. It is with much sadness that we send our sympathy to Pat and all Bob's family.\n\nRobert Gerard Hunter born in Kildare, to the west of Dublin, Ireland ,in 1924. When he was just 18 during WW2, he joined the RAF with a friend at Belfast in 1942. Sent to England for 6 weeks assessment training. Bob was then posted to Cornwall for 6 months training as a maintenance fitter working on Beaufighter aircraft which, equipped with torpedoes, were used to protect the convoys sailing into Falmouth from America. He then went on to complete a mechanics course in Halton in Buckinghamshire and was subsequently posted to RAF Melbourne in Yorkshire working on 10 Squadron’s Halifax Bombers. After 10 squadron, Bob went to Valley on Anglesey, Wales and later to Desborough in Northants to run a course teaching pilots ‘Beam Landing’ techniques using a radar aircraft landing system developed for poor visibility landings. He was discharged from the RAF in 1948.\n\nBob died aged 96 on 11 May 2021 and his funeral took place on 15 June 2021 at St Joseph’s Church, Epsom. (available to view on YouTube)\n\nHe and his wife Pat were members of the 10 Sqn Association for over 25 years.\n\nWe offer our condolences to all those affected by his passing.\n\nVE-Day 2020\n\nRIP Bob Hunter\n\n25 April 2021\n\nFrank Williamson 10 Squadron Pilot WW2 (Sqn Ldr)\n\nAssociation member Frank Williamson passed away peacefully at his Amersham home on 21 April 2021, having celebrated his 100th birthday in August 2020.\n\nHe had served on both Whitleys and Halifaxes during WW2 and even in his later years, remained passionate about flying, continually sharing stories with his grandson-in law, the former recent OC10 Gp Cpt Simon Blackwell.\n\nFrank was immensely proud of his past and modern associations specifically with 10 Squadron, but also with the RAF in general. Sqn Ldr Williamson also served on 102 (Ceylon) Squadron and we are most grateful to their Association for passing on some of the information here.\n\nOur condolences and sympathy go to all his extended family which includes of course Frank's grand-daughter Nicky Blackwell, Simon Blackwell's wife.\n\nThe funeral was held on 11 May and to overcome Covid-19 distancing regulations, a video link, arranged by the funeral directors, allowed a relay to other members of the family.\n\nRIP Frank Williamson.\n\n6 March 2021\n\nJohn Howard Wolley 10 Sqn VC10 Captain and 10 Sqn Association member\n\nBy a very roundabout route, (his local postman) we learn the sad news that John passed away recently on 6 March 2021.\n\nThe following has now been received in May, from his daughter Cheryl, to whom we send our thanks and offer our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to her and all the rest of John’s family.\n\nJohn was a delightful man whose affable nature endeared him to all who met and flew with him. He was held in great respect for his flying ability and with much affection by all on 10 Squadron’s VC10s who were lucky to have flown with him. His RAF service comprised some 43 years which made him one of the longest serving members at the time of his retirement.\n\nSqn Ldr John Wolley retires from the RAF in 1993 after 43 years service\n\nSeen here with his late wife Dot and Wg Cdr Al Stuart, the then OC10\n\nJohn was taken into hospital after a fall and thence to a Chipping Norton care home where he deteriorated very quickly and after five weeks also tested positive for Covid-19 and passed away.\n\nSqn Ldr John Howard Wolley, MBE sadly passed away on 6 March 2021, aged 89.\n\nHis daughter Cheryl writes:\n\nJohn was a retired squadron leader who served on squadrons which included Nos 29, 36, 10 Squadrons and was also on the Command Examining Unit.\n\nHe was a devoted husband to the late Dot, a wonderful father to his daughter Cheryl, grandfather to Gemma and Marco and great grandfather to Viola. He was a good friend to many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him.\n\nJohn retired in 1993 after 43 years of service as a pilot. His essence was flying after starting his training in 1950-51 at RAF Heany, some 15 miles from Bulawayo in which was then Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where training took place on Tiger Moths and Harvards. During his extraordinary career he was then to go on to fly 22 different types of aircraft which included the Meteor, Vampire Chipmunk, Hunter, Devon, Phantom, Jaguar, Hercules and the VC10, just to mention a few.\n\nSome of the numerous stations of his postings included Tangmere, North Luffenham, Leconfieild, Benson, Lyneham and Brize Norton.\n\nJohn was also posted to Germany in 1959-61, a detachment to Malaysia in 1965 and Decimomannu (Sardinia) from 1976-1978.\n\nHe saw on active service in the Dacca evacuation during the 1971 India - Pakistan war, the Falklands conflict of 1982 and the Gulf War in 1990. His career ended whilst on 10 Sqn at RAF Brize Norton and he was overjoyed when he was given an extension, even after his due retirement date, to continue flying the VC 10, which he considered to be the ‘Queen of the Skies’.\n\nDuring John’s long career he was awarded an MBE in 1989, Queen’s Commendations in 1972 and 1976 and a commendation from Support Command in 1968.\n\nThe funeral service took place on 23 March at the Ramsgate, Kent cemetery chapel and the family’s thanks go to all those who attended and especially to Lindsay and Daniela Baigent, the daughters of his life long friend Peter.\n\nDonations were requested to be sent to either the Blind Veterans UK, the RAF Benevolent Fund, or SSAFA.\n\nCondolences and Enquiries may be sent by email to Cheryl Wolley at: This email address is being protected from spambots.

Although not an Association member we are pleased to honour his memory by publishing this brief summary of Jack's life and flying career, which his daughter Lorna has kindly sent to us.\n\n\" Dad was born in Bearsden, north-west Glasgow in July 1930, the only child of Annie and Bertie Goodwin. Having later moved to nearby Milngavie, Dad became a keen scout and attended Bearsden Academy until, at 16 years of age, he decided to follow his father into an engineering career. He was awarded an apprenticeship as a draughtsman with Mavor & Couslon Ltd. (electrical and mining machinery manufacturers). Within a week of completing his apprenticeship on 31 March 1952 he was called up for National Service on 4th April.\n\nEarly on both the RAF and he discovered that he had both the aptitude and a love of flying and the rest as they say, is history.\n\nDad’s RAF career started during his National Service when he attended flight grading school and made his first flight on 19 June 1952. He soon transferred to flying training school and first flew solo on 28 November 1952.\n\nReading his flight logs I discovered the complexity of his flying career with his training including qualifications in para-dropping, heavy-load drops, instrument flying, aerobatics, high and low-level formation flying, battle flying, and both sea and jungle survival. Trained to fly both propeller aircraft and jet aircraft, Dad was awarded his ‘Wings’ on 21 September 1953.\n\nIn 1955 he became operational with 99 Squadron flying Valetta’s and that same year Mum and Dad married on 5th September at Cairns Church in Milngavie and Dad went out to his first overseas posting with 84 Sqn in Nicosia, Cyprus.\n\nReading his Pilots Flying Log Books has enabled the family to share his flying story.\n\nIn his 34 years in the Royal Air Force Dad flew at least 11 different aircraft in a number of different squadrons - from the Chipmunk to the Hercules with several years flying Valetta’s and VC10s. Over his long career he:\n\nFlew to 59 countries – from Aden to Vietnam\n\nLanded (and took off) at 297 airfields – from Abu Suer, Eygpt to Vaerlose, Denmark\n\nLanded at 109 airfields in the UK – from Abingdon to Lossiemouth\n\nFlew for 8784 hours = quite literally spending a year and a day in the sky\n\nOver 4000 hours as captain or first pilot\n\nMade over 3500 flights – ranging from training flights of 30 mins to long-haul flights of 10+ hours\n\nAnd: He was awarded General Service Medals for service in Suez, Malaya and Borneo\n\nHis many tours included Ripon, Nicosia (1956), then 1 weeks’ notice to relocate to RAF Steamer Point, Aden. Returning to the UK he was posted to RAF Benson, followed by RAAF Butterworth, Malaysia. Returning to the UK Jack was based at Thorney Island until in 1967, he joined 10 Squadron at RAF Brize Norton flying VC10s and he remained on the Squadron for 8 years.\n\nThis was undoubtedly one of his favourite postings, as was flying VC10’s and on a later visit to the Victoria Cross Gallery at the Imperial War Museum he was delighted to see the history of the VC winners after whom the planes he flew had been named.\n\nFollowing his tour on 10 Squadron, Jack was posted to Hong Kong in 1975 after which a return to the UK saw subsequent postings to Lyneham, Northholt and Lossiemouth; his final tour being in Operations at RAF Lyneham to retire in 1985.\"\n\nRIP Jack Goodwin\n\nJuly 1930 – March 2021\n\n17 Feb 21:\n\nBill Bradshaw 10 Sqn WW2 Tail Gunner & later a General Practioner in Huddersfield\n\nBill Bradshaw, the tail gunner in the WW2 10 Sqn Pennicott Halifax crew, passed away in the early hours of 15th February 2021, at the age of 98. He had been living independently until just before Christmas 2020 when he contracted Covid-19. He was in hospital for a week or so and then seemed to rally a bit, but unfortunately his recovery did not continue and he was sent to stay in a care home, where his condition deteriorated further.\n\nAs readers of Jane Gulliford-Lowes’ book, ‘Above Us The Stars’ will realise, he contributed to much of her research into 10 Squadron’s WW2 Halifax operations. He was also a member of the 10 Squadron Association.\n\nAs Jane herself now writes;\n\n“Meeting Bill was truly one of the greatest days of my life. I knew him but briefly, but I adored him. I’ve come to know his wonderful family very well since; especially his lovely daughter Angela, who has now asked me to contact the Association to let you know the sad news. Her father was so proud of his 10 Squadron days - he even had a private vehicle registration number, 10 DFC, bought as a birthday present from his family and still kept his RAF uniform upstairs in his wardrobe.\n\nBill was a truly lovely man, a really warm personality with a dazzling smile. I’m so glad I got to know him in his twilight years - it was a privilege. ”\n\nJane Lowes 16 Feb 21\n\nAfter WW2, Bill trained as doctor, became a GP and spent the rest of his life practising in Huddersfield.\n\nThe Yorkshire Post published the following on 2 March 2021:\n\nDr William H. A.Bradshaw, DFC\n\nBill died peacefully on 15 February 2021.\n\nA remarkable man who led an extraordinary life; that Bill survived beyond his early 20s, given his WWII service, is a miracle; that he lived a full and active life until aged 98, a blessing.\n\nBill was born in Ireland and brought up in S.E. Asia and then near Strangford Lough, County Down.\n\nHe volunteered for the RAF aged 17, trained as a pilot in Canada, and then volunteered for Bomber Command, serving as a tail gunner (and gunnery leader) on Halifaxes with 10 Squadron. He was the last surviving member of the 10 Squadron 'Pennicott crew' ; all of them decorated for bravery.\n\nAfter WWII, Bill married his beloved Margaret and qualified in medicine at Queen's University, Belfast.\n\nFrom serving his country, Bill then served his community, spending over 30 years as a much-loved GP in Huddersfield.\n\nThe kindest, most considerate, and gentlest of gentlemen; a wonderful husband, father-in-law to Peter and Lindsay, Angela and Steve, grandpa to Cory and Emily, Katie and Hannah and friend to everyone he met, we mourn Bill's loss.\n\nHe is now reunited with his Margaret, whom he never stopped missing.\n\nSpecial thanks to our wonderful Lisa for all her love and care.\n\nPrivate family cremation. All enquiries, and any donations (instead of flowers) - to the RAF Benevolent Fund - in Bill's memory, c/o Andrew Gledhill,\n\nHighfield Funeral Directors, Huddersfield 01484 428243\n\nOur condolences go to all Bill's family and his close friends.\n\nRIP - Bill Bradshaw\n\n24 Jan 21:\n\nReverend Ian Cook 1960's 10 Sqn Victor Aircraft Technician\n\nand\n\nThe 10 Squadron Association Chaplain & Committee Member\n\nWith great sadness we have to report that our very own Chaplain Rev Ian Cook passed away on\n\n24 January 2021\n\nAs you may be aware, Ian suffered a major stroke last autumn and after eventually leaving hospital before Christmas, was placed in a care home near to his home in north-east Manchester. During both the hospitalisation and later the care home, his wife Rita had been unable to be close and in touching distance to Ian because of Covid-19 rules and she had relied on the care home’s facility of video calling to see and communicate with him. In turn Ian had been very limited in his ability to speak back to her.\n\nIan was in the RAF on a three-year engagement from 1959 and had been an instrument technician on 10 Sqn during its 1960 Victor days at RAF Cottesmore. Later, after his ordination, he became the vicar of St Gabriel's Church in Middleton Junction, Manchester and served the local community there for 29 years until to his retirement aged 70 in 2008.\n\nHis funeral service was held on 17 February 2021\n\nat St Gabriels' Church, Greenhill Road, Middleton, Manchester\n\nwhere he was later buried in its graveyard, in a plot by the church's East Window.\n\nSee this link to: Ian's Funeral Service\n\nBefore being ordained in September 1973 Ian worked for a number of companies located in Leicester, Oldham and the Manchester area. His work had varied from being a Labour Exchange employee, a draughtsman for Avro at their Chadderton plant (where Lancasters had been made in WW2), a contracts manager and a social worker which included visiting Manchester's Strangeways Prison. After being ordained and assisting at St Wilfred's Church in East Manchester, he eventually was to spend 29 years until his retirement aged 70, at St Gabriel's, Middleton Junction, not far from his Middleton home. Even after he retired he continued to assist in the nearby Langley parish and others in his local area.\n\nIan was a much-liked member of the Association who, apart from conducting our Remembrance Sunday services at Melbourne for a number of years with dignity and empathy, also contributed on the social side as we can surely remember him approaching his 80’s discoing away with the younger members at our annual Reunion Buffets which were then held in the Sgts Mess at Brize. He was held in great respect and liked by all.\n\nIan was also one of our Association Committee Members for a number of years and could always be trusted to give wise inputs and sound advice.\n\nWe send our heartfelt sympathies to Rita and their three daughters Alison, Susan and Pauline at this sad time.\n\nIan will be sorely missed.\n\nRIP Ian\n\n20 Jan 2021:\n\nLesley Arthur Turner WW2 10 Sqn Observer/Nav\n\nA recent Newsletter from the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) Lincoln, lists in their \"To The Skies\" section, the death of a 10 Sqn WW2 Observer/Navigator Lesley Turner on 27 November 2020 aged 98.

He was truly special and will be missed.\n\nFor a more detailed text about Jimmy click on the link here: Jimmy Witter DFM\n\nRIP Jimmy\n\nGeoff Walker 10 Sqn VC10 Navigator 1987 - 1991\n\nGeoff Walker, a highly experienced Transport Force navigator, died on Thursday 12 November 2020, in Sobell House Hospice, Oxford. In August he had been diagnosed as having an incurable brain tumour and, in the end, could not be cared for at home.\n\nGeoff served with 10 Squadron from October 1987 till August 1991, a period that covered the Squadron’s introduction to air-to-air refuelling and the intense flying required in support of Operation Granby to liberate Kuwait. He regularly flew on VVIP tasks, including 13 flights with Mrs Thatcher and John Major.\n\nStarting in 1963, his early career was spent on the Argosy force in squadrons in the Far East, the UK and Middle East. As a long-term resident of Wallingford, he was, for over 45 years, at the heart of the organisation of the annual ARDET (Argosy Detachment) Reunions held at RAF Benson. He will be warmly remembered by those who knew him.\n\nFuneral arrangements are still to be decided, and our condolences go to his wife Barbara.\n\n7 September 2020\n\nJohn McCubbin Association Member\n\nWW2 Halifax and Dakota India, 1945-47 Wireless Operator\n\nOne of the founder members of the Association John McCubbin was demobbed in 1947 after his service on 10 Squadron during WW2 and later in India and Burma.\n\nHaving recently celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary and also his 96th birthday, John set out by car on 7 September to collect some materials for a cementing job at his home in Penpont, near Thornhill to the north of Dumfries, Scotland. He had been in good health during the Coronavirus pandemic and earlier in the year planted a crop of potatoes which he should soon have been harvesting. During a car journey to collect some building materials, just five days after his birthday, John felt unwell and realising that something was wrong, stopped his car. Havving brought the car to a halt John immediately passed away.\n\nJohn's family includes his wife Elizabeth, son Ian, daughter Hazel and four grand-children; Kirsty, Scott, Calum and Catriona. Hazel has kept us informed for the past few years about Association member John’s activities and his sudden passing must come as a great shock to all the family.\n\nWe offer them all our deepest sympathies.\n\nUnfortunately, Covid-19 restrictions limited the numbers attending John's cremation funeral service to only 20 attending at the Roucan Loch Crematorium in Dumfries on 18th September.\n\nThe short service was conducted by the Rev David McKay with readings from John's grand-daughter Kirsty and eulogies by his son Ian and daughter Hazel. It closed with the RAF March Past tune and John's ashes will be interred in the graveyard at Penpont Parish Church at a later date.\n\nSee Order of Service and Eulogy: John McCubbin\n\nJohn, grand-daughter Catriona and Elizabeth\n\n(on the occasion of Catriona's graduation as a doctor)\n\nJohn with another Association Member Hugh Reay (left) when they reunited in 2016\n\nHugh Reay, also a former 10 Sqn WOp, and John McCubbin first met in the Spring of 1943 at Lords Cricket Ground where they reported to enlist. Both trained at Madley in Herefordshire as wireless operators going on to further training at different centres and then meeting later at 10 Squadron for operational flying on Halifaxes at Melbourne, Yorkshire.\n\nAfter the war ended in May 1945 and 10 Squadron was immediately transferred into Transport Command, both converted to the Squadron’s Dakotas and spent their remaining RAF time in India and Burma. Hugh passed away in May of 2020 at his home in Hexham, Northumberland.\n\nReaders may be interested to know that in 2014 John's daughter Hazel wrote to the Association, asking if we could provide any answers as to why her father had been turned down in his application for the recently created ‘Bomber Command Clasp’ which was to be fixed to the 1939-45 Star Medal. The MoD Medal Office had stated that John had not served the requisite time on the Squadron, as laid down in the Clasp Award Criteria. Our research showed this was indeed the case but we felt that an exception should be made in John’s case…………..\n\nJohn joined 10 Sqn in March 1945 and by the time the war ended on 8 May, when 10 Squadron was immediately transferred into Transport Command, he had served 42 out of the required BC Clasp criteria 60 days on the Squadron. During this time John had flown on 4 operational missions over enemy territory (the Clasp Criteria only required 1 to have been done) and he had then remained on the Squadron, retraining on Dakotas for when 10 Squadron deployed to Poona in India, after the War in the Far East ended, in September 1945. In March 1946 he was on the Dakota aircraft detachment to Burma where, operating from bases at Myitkyina and Meiktila, he carried out numerous ‘Operation Hunger’ flights over north-eastern Burma dropping food aid to the local country-folk who had had their crops ruined or stolen by the Japanese invaders during WW2. He was also the wireless operator on one of the many flights sent to search for the 3 Dakotas which all crashed on the same day on 29 March 1946 in the mountains of Burma. John remained on 10 Squadron until 1947 when he returned to the UK for demob.\n\nIn spite of all this 10 Squadron service John was disallowed the Bomber Command Clasp simply because his service was short of just 18 days missing out of the 60 required before the war in Europe ended and, through no fault of John’s, the Squadron on which he remained, was no longer in Bomber Command. Our research led us to Air Chief Marshal Sir John Cheshire who most kindly intervened on John’s behalf with some of his present-day Air Officer contacts but he too had to admit defeat when the Medal Office refused to change their decision. Following this, a letter to the Prime Minister, at No 10 Downing Street also failed to achieve the desired result.\n\nJohn: In our eyes you had the Clasp to the 1939-45 Star Medal\n\nRIP John McCubbin\n\nMike Wilmott Association Member\n\nand son of a Halifax LV 881 crew member that crashed in Germany during WW2\n\nMike Wilmott sadly passed away on Monday 7 September after suffering from cancer. He was just 62 yrs old. Mike lived near Macclesfield in Cheshire and ran a sheet-metal company in Leek, Staffs. He was a regular attendee at the Melbourne Memorial Remembrance Sunday services, having joined the Association during the research into the March 1944 Halifax LV 881 crash in Germany,\n\nMike's father Sgt Norman Wilmott, was the Bomb Aimer on the Halifax aircraft and although injured after baling out, he survived the crash. After his capture and hospital he was then taken as a PoW to Stalag Luft 7 in Poland. His son Mike was contacted by our researcher Ann Bihan in her efforts to find the relatives of all the LV 881 crew so that they could attend a memorial ceremony in September 2014 at the crash site at Kaltenrain, near Hungen, some 25 kms north-east of Frankfurt. All crew members relatives then became good friends proving that membership of 10 Squadron is the common link that joins many varied lives.\n\nSee: LV 881 : Hungen 2014\n\nNo details yet as to Mike's funeral arrangements but our condolences go to his partner Lorraine, son Sam who will continue Mike's business, and all Mike's family.\n\nAssociation Researcher Ann Bihan writes:\n\nMike was a really lovely man and I remember so well after my first contact with him when doing the research for LV881. I knew I woud like him.\n\nHe was so proud of his father and the commemoration in Germany was very special to him and his family. Also the bonus from this was that our lives touched that of a special person. The friendship that has grown between the families of the crew of LV881 is something very special.\n\nIt is such a shame that Mike never actually managed to make a Voyager refuelling flight at our Annual Association Reunions. It was something he really wanted to do and the last time I spoke to him he was still hoping to get airborne with 10 Sqn.\n\nRIP Mike\n\nRon Smith VC10 Air Loadmaster 1970s - 80s\n\nIt is reported, via the Costa Blanca Branch of the Aircrew Association, that former VC10 air loadmaster Ron Smith passed away on 31 August 2020. It is presumed that this occurred in Spain where Ron lived with his long-term partner Joan, in Moraira, north-east of Alicante near Calpe and Denia.\n\nThere will be no funeral because Ron gave his body for research. No other details are available to date as at 2 Sep 20.\n\nOur condolences go to Joan and any other family members.\n\nRIP Ron\n\nPam Spence Master Air Loadmaster VC10 late 1960s\n\nAlthough Pam was not a member of the Association she was a well respected colleague and loved by all who touched her life.\n\nThe following words about her have been taken from a post on the VC10 ALM''s Facebook page:\n\nIt was with great sadness we received the news of the passing of MALM Pam Spence on 28 July 2020 at Rose Cross Residential Home in Swansea.\n\nPam joined the RAF as a Clerk Secretarial but remusterd to aircrew and joined 10 Sqn in the late 1960’s. She spent all of her flying career on VC10’s and will be remembered for the many years she spent on 10 Sqn and her time on the OCU at Brize Norton. Pam was also an instructor at the aircrew basic training school RAF Topcliffe and an instructor at The Air Loadmaster Training School at RAF Finningley, where she was known to her students as being strict but always kind and helpful. She was a well respected and much loved colleague.\n\nA fellow loadmaster Eric Hills recalls that on one of her trips the aircraft was hit by severe turbulence abeam Tehran. Her calm words were, \"This aircraft (VC10) is built by the best engineers in the world and we don’t have to worry about this unpleasantness. I will get the coffee\"\n\nPam had been in ill health for many years but recalled her RAF days with great happiness and affection.\n\nHer funeral was held at Swansea Crematorium on the 10th August but sadly due to Covid restrictions in Wales, only a maximum number of 20 mourners were permitted to attend.\n\nPam's sister, Mrs Margaret Hovestadt’s address is available from the Web Warden should anyone wish to send messages of condolence.\n\nRIP Pam\n\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Michael Beavis, KCB, CBE, AFC (Aug 1929 - Jun 2020)\n\nOfficer Commanding No 10 Squadron July 1966 to November 1968\n\nIt is with great sadness that we learn of the death of ‘Mike' Beavis who, when in wing commander rank, was the first OC10 of the long VC10 era in the Squadron’s history.\n\nSir Michael aged 90, passed away peacefully at his home in Pissouri, Cyprus on 7 June 2020 and his funeral was held in Pissouri Village, on 15 June. Donations given in his honour and remembrance should be sent to the RAF Benevolent Fund.\n\nOur condolences and sympathies go to his daughter Lynn and son Simon, together will all their families.\n\n******\n\nAs many will know, Nos 10 and 101 Squadrons combine to have a semi-permanent detachment at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, thus enabling their Voyager aircraft to assist Middle Eastern Coalition forces. The present detachment commander is Sqn Ldr Andy Brown from 101 Sqn who, in days gone by, was a VC10 navigator.\n\nOn Monday 15 June 2020, Andy was made an honorary 10 Sqn member for the day by OC10 Wg Cdr Al Scott, and in that capacity represented 10 Sqn and the former VC10 Force at Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael’s funeral service in Pissouri.\n\nAfter the funeral Andy reported that the Service was an excellent and fitting send-off.\n\n“The RAF was well represented by Air Cdre Anthony Beasant, Chief of Staff British Forces Cyprus, Gp Capt Nikki Thomas, RAF Akrotiri Station Commander, whose personnel also provided first-class pall-bearers and who arranged for the ‘Last Post’ to be played by a bugler from 7 Rifles.\n\nSir Michael’s daughter, Mrs Lynn Curry delivered a strong, but moving tribute to his life including mentioning his most treasured time as OC 10 Sqn on the VC10 aircraft. Because of Covid-19 restrictions, the funeral directors facilitated internet coverage of the event to family in the UK. Within the group of friends in attendance there were several retired senior officers and representatives from the Aircrew Association.”\n\nSqn Ldr Brown passed on condolences from both 10 Squadron and the Association to Lynn who then cheerfully recalled how much her father had enjoyed his time on the Squadron from July 1966 to November 1968.\n\nOur gratitude goes to OC10, Sqn Ldr Brown and all others who allowed a 10 Squadron & Association presence to bid farewell to a most respected and well-liked, former Officer Commanding No 10 Squadron.\n\nRIP Sir Michael\n\nSee Sir Michael’s own personal contribution to our short biographies of former OC10s written in 2017 at:\n\nSir Michael Beavis - a short autobiography\n\nSir Michael in the left hand seat of a VC10\n\npainted by Penelope Douglas G.Av.A.\n\nHugh Reay WW2 Halifax and Dakota Wireless Operator March 1945 - April 1947\n\nWith great sadness we are informed that Hugh Reay passed away on Sunday 3 May 2020 in Hexham Hospital after a short illness.

He retired to the Isle of Wight and was a member of the Royal Flying Corps & Royal Naval Air Service Association here on the Island (the last branch in existence) and it was through this organisation that I saw him regularly until he became ill in late 2019.\n\nHis funeral took place on 6th February and a number of RFC/RNAS Assn members were there along with some of old friends from his days in the Service. If any association members wish to contact his widow, Viv, then I would be happy to pass on any messages.\n\nPeter Bingham\n\nRIP Chris\n\n*****\n\nHarry Liddell also affectionately known as 'Mr VC10' Squadron Leader and VC10 Captain\n\nThe following message has been received from Harry's son Charles;\n\n\" I regret to have to inform you that 10 Squadron Association member Harry Liddell died on 25th January 2020.\n\nWhile the family is still stunned by his sudden passing, we are so relieved for him that he went the way he did, quickly and quietly and not suffering at all. Being 95 years old, he certainly could not complain of being short changed in the longevity stakes.\n\nAt Harry's request there will be no funeral. He felt that they are such awful things that no one should have to endure such an ordeal, not even himself . - Self-effacing to the last.\n\nSincerely, Charles Liddell (son) \"\n\nHarry will be sadly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and flying with him on the VC10. He was a pilot on the Squadron and later on the long tours which followed, he became a VC10 Trainer/Instructor/Examiner on No 241 OCU at Brize Norton and ASCEU/ATEU at Upavon. He was always treated with the greatest respect for his ability as a pilot (Harry held one of the very few, and rarely awarded, Air Support/Strike Command 'A' Categories which allowed him to fly HM The Queen) and for his quiet, modest manner as a true officer and gentleman. Harry was well-liked by all who ever came into contact with him.\n\nIt is hoped that some of his memories may be published here in due course and will include his recollections of training at a wartime Canadian Air Training School, a GPU in the southern UK, his immediate postwar experiences of Burma, as well as various tales from his post-university second stint in the RAF..........\n\nHarry was born in Clifton, Bristol in September 1924 and died aged 95 yrs.\n\nOur sincere condolences go to Harry's wife Liz, and to his daughter and son Sophie and Charles.\n\nA true professional in every sense.\n\nR.I.P. Harry Liddell\n\n*****\n\nHarold Dummer\n\nWe regret to announce that Association Member Harold Dummer passed away on 6 January 2020.\n\nHarold was a stalwart member of the Association and was very passionate about supporting 10 Squadron in honour of his brother Cyril who had been killed in action during WW2. To that end he was a long-term attendee at the annual Service of Remembrance at the 10 Squadron Melbourne Memorial and, over the years, made many friends during the pub lunches held after the Service.\n\nAlthough he was never a member of the Squadron himself, Harold’s membership was taken out in respect for the memory of his brother Sgt Cyril A.R. Dummer who was a 10 Sqn WW2 Halifax Mid-Upper air gunner, lost in WW2 aged just 19 yrs.\n\n– See attached pdf file: Cyril Dummer\n\nThe aircraft in which his brother died had been previously flown on many missions by a crew who had survived their full tour of operations. The rear gunner on that crew was a Sgt (later Fg Off) Ken Beard. Ken and Harold became good friends and were often seen together at various 10 Sqn Association get-togethers. Sadly Ken passed away in July 2019.\n\nHarold (left) with Ken Beard at a Remembrance Sunday lunch at the Plough Inn, Allerthorpe\n\nHarold was born in Paddington, London in 1931. He was unfortunate enough to fall out of the back of a truck during his own RAF WW2 training and broke his back, thus causing him to be invalided out of the Service. Typical of his spirit though, he did not let this shape the rest of his life, even though he spent much time in hospital in plaster and had to learn to walk again. He went on to work and live an always active and a very practical life. He was a keen craftsman who was always making things.\n\nAfter marrying his beloved wife Anne in 1955 they had three children, Susan, Jennifer and Martin. His main area of work was as a warehouse manager for BASF and then more latterly an auditor for BASF. He started his RAF research into his brother Cyril’s 10 Sqn 1944 Halifax crash when he retired and it always amazed him that on his audit work travels, he had regularly passed close to Rawcliffe, near Goole where, through his research, he learned that was where his brother’s aircraft had crashed, although he was unaware of the location at the time.\n\nUp until he became ill in September 2019, Harold had never been in hospital or had the need to see the doctor. He remained in hospital, except for a few weeks at a rehabilitation centre where he became ill again and had to be re-admitted to hospital. Sadly, he never was to leave and he passed away peacefully there on 6 January 2020.\n\nThe date of his funeral at Kettering on 24 January would also have been Harold’s 89th birthday and, as he loved family get-togethers, it has been felt fitting to hold the celebration of his life on that day.\n\nHarold’s brother, Mid Upper Gunner - Sgt Cyril Albert Reginald Dummer RAFVR aged 19, of Kenton, Middlesex was buried in the Harrogate Stonefall Cemetery, Yorkshire (Grave B/G/4). On his 1944 gravestone are the words,\n\n“He Left The Consolation Of A Treasured Memory.”\n\nWe might add, ........ “So did Harold”\n\nOur thanks go to Harold's daughter Susan Drage for advising us of Harold's passing and our condolences go to all the family.\n\nHarold's funeral was held on\n\n24 January 2020 at Kettering Crematorium\n\n*****\n\nGeorge Fair 10 Sqn VC10 Air Quartermaster and later Flight Commander\n\nWe have hazy information that George Fair passed away sometime during the summer of 2019.\n\nWe understand that George may have joined 10 Sqn as an Air Quartermaster in the VC10's early days of 1968. He then became the flight commander for Air Loadmasters and Air Stewards sometime in the early 1980s and may have later retired from the RAF in the rank of squadron leader.\n\nOur attention to this news,stems from a third party noticing a post on Facebook's 'I served on 10 Squadron'.\n\nAny further information would be much appreciated by readers. please email: This email address is being protected from spambots.

This included working on Vulcans as an Air Radar Technician before joining the aircrew fraternity as a Flight Engineer on Nimrods (206 Sqn), VC10s (10 Sqn) and (his love) the Tristar (216 Sqn).\n\nWe also understand that David had a Doctorate in Engineering and may have based his Thesis for it around Concorde Trials. (Any elaboration on this would be gratefully received from readers.)\n\nHe will be sadly missed by family and a host of friends.\n\nRIP\n\nDavid's funeral was held at Lincoln Crematorium on 27 August 2019\n\nOur Condolences go to all David's family and friends.\n\n****\n\nKen Cyril Beard 10 Sqn Fg Off WW2 Halifax Tail Gunner (1944)\n\nSadly we learnt that Ken Beard passed away on 5 July 2019, aged 97: - he would have been 98 in December 2019. Ken was a stalwart member of the Association and regularly attended Reunions and Remembrance Sunday services until well into his middle nineties. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him, especially all those in The Salvation Army which he held so dear.\n\nKen’s funeral took place on Monday 22 July 2019\n\nat the Salvation Army Church, Church Street, Clowne,\n\nChesterfield and later at Worksop for the interment.\n\n*******\n\nIn 2016, his elder son Jim, an Association member, sent us the following article about his father:-\n\nDad's War - Ken Beard\n\nOur condolences go to all Ken's family.\n\nRIP Ken\n\nNote: A Museum is being set up and is due to open to the public in 2020 near WW2's Gold Beach in Normandy.

Post-war he was at the forefront of world-wide, long-haul flying and later, whilst flying for BEA on the Trident and Tristar, was involved with the high-technology advancements which now allow automatic landings in poor weather to be a matter of course.\n\nAlways forward thinking in his attitudes, Doug was a 1984 founder member of the 10 Sqn Association and his gentle demeanour made him immediately liked by all whom he met. His amazingly accurate and detailed recollections of his WW2 career have provided much hitherto un-documented knowledge regarding the daily lives endured by WW2 Bomber Command crews who could not expect to survive for much longer than three weeks after joining their squadrons to take the war to the enemy. Doug's later long career in civil aviation won him an award of a Master Pilot's certificate issued by the Honourable Company of Air Pilots in 2012 and as a friend to so many Doug will be sorely missed.\n\nClick here: Captain Doug Evans, DFC to read a fuller account of his life.\n\nHe truly 'Hit The Mark' .\n\nRIP Doug\n\nWe'll miss you.\n\nGod Bless\n\nTerry G.Murphy (1932 -2018) Flight Lieutenant VC10 Co-pilot late 1960s - early 1970s\n\nWe are sad to announce that Terry passed away on 22 December 2018 after a long illness.\n\nWe send our condolences to his wife Betty and all the family who live in the Cleethorpes area of Lincolnshire.\n\nTerry was the subject of a long search which the Association carried out in 2018 to trace his whereabouts for the couple to whom he acted as their Best Man some 63 years ago. We managed to trace him and put the families back in touch shortly before his death.\n\nHe lived in Bexleheath, Kent as a child and joined the RAF as a National Serviceman in the early 1950s. He flew on both 9 and 101 Squadron's Canberras at Bassingbourn and Binbrook and later on Vulcans before joining 10 Squadron in about 1968.\n\nRIP Terry\n\n*****\n\nDerek Gurney WW2 Sergeant - Hailifax Tail Gunner\n\nDerek was a rear gunner on a WW2 Halifax crew captained by a WO E.

His grandson informs us that:\n\nThe funeral was on 12 December 2018 at the Test Valley Crematorium, Romsey, Hants.\n\n- exactly 75 years to the day (12 December 1943) from when James was commissioned as a pilot officer.\n\nJames’ family have kindly offered that any donations received at the funeral shall benefit the RAF Benevolent Fund with a reference to the 10 Sqn Association. Our thanks will be echoed by the RAFBF.\n\nJames completed his tour of operations on 10 Squadron Halifaxes at Melbourne in February 1944 but his next operational tour is as yet unknown. After promotion to flying officer rank in June 1944 he was awarded the DFC soon afterwards but research is now ongoing as to there being a possibility he may have later been awarded a Bar to the medal. Surviving WW2 he finally left the RAF in February 1950.\n\nJames joined 10 Sqn in June 1943 on Fg Off John G. Jenkins’ crew. Two months later the crew survived a crash landing back at Melbourne after severe combat damage to their aircraft (DT 792) had been sustained on a raid to Hamburg.\n\nJust another two months later in September 1943 the same crew escaped yet again from their damaged aircraft (HR 924) which this time had been attacked by an Me110 during their raid on Hanover. On this occasion bombs could not be dropped over the target or jettisoned prior to landing and the crew were directed to point the aircraft towards the North Sea and bale out which they did near Patrington. This action earned their pilot captain Fg Off Jenkins, the somewhat lengthy nickname of, “Bring ’em back alive Jenkins” to accompany his immediate award of the DFC.\n\nOur thanks and sympathies to Richard Bond and the family.
