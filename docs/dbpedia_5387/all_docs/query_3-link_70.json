        "text": "Gary Kiger Memorial Bench\n\nBench in Old Main\n\nGary Kiger was a prolific researcher and writer. He was passionate about his teaching and the intellectual development of his students. He joined the sociology faculty at Utah State University in 1983 after receiving a bachelor’s from the University of Colorado in 1975, a master’s from McGill University in 1978 and a doctorate from the University of Colorado in 1983.\n\nGary loved the academic life at Utah State University and is remembered for his dedication to scholarship and learning. He was equally capable as a leader and team member. He served for 25 years as a faculty member, was head of the Department of Sociology, Social Work and Anthropology, and was dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. Gary had a warm, friendly smile and made every effort to greet and compliment others. His great compassion and unfailing optimism are well known. A good listener, he was sincerely interested in others.\n\nA bench in Old Main commemorates Gary Kiger (1953-2008), “Dean of the College of HASS and professor of sociology. He will be remembered as a beloved colleague, a stellar leader and an extraordinary teacher. As you take your ease, honor Gary by reflecting on those whose teaching inspires and uplifts.”\n\nLynn Langer Meeks Memorial Bench\n\nBench in Old Main\n\nBorn June 4, 1946, Lynn Langer Meeks graduated from Jerome High School in 1964, took her bachelor’s at the College of Idaho in 1968, her master’s in English literature from Arizona State in 1977, and, while working full-time as a teacher, she completed her doctorate in English from Arizona State in 1985. She taught high school for many years in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nIn 1985, Lynn joined the English faculty at Utah State. In 1988, she became the Language Arts Consultant for the State of Idaho. In 1994, upon marrying USU History Professor Norm Jones, she returned to USU where she became a full professor of English, director of writing and director of the Utah Writing Project. Lynn loved students, and she loved to teach. She believed that every student could learn to write, and she demonstrated it in her teaching and her scholarship. A proud Idahoan, she was always involved with the family ranch and her nieces´ 4-H projects.\n\nA bench in Old Main commemorates Lynn Meeks, “I am a teacher at heart, and there are moments in the classroom when I can hardly hold the joy. - Park J. Palmer. In Memory of Lynn Langer Meeks (1946-2006) Professor of English.”\n\nChuck Johnson Memorial Tree\n\nCharles Wayne Johnson was born March 15, 1945, in Chicago, Illinois. He attended the Military Academy at West Point and served in the United States Army. He received his bachelor’s in history from DePaul University and his master’s and doctorate in philosophy from Michigan State. He completed the doctorate in a record time of two years. Chuck began as a professor of philosophy at Utah State University in 1972.\n\nAt USU, Chuck spent many years training the drum line of the marching band. He participated in the USU Percussion Ensemble and played the bass drum in a Civil War-era brass band. He also trained dancers to drum for the USU-sponsored Glenn Miller Show.\n\nAs a professor in the philosophy program, Chuck was revered by generations of students for his dry wit, his sharp mind and his love of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Chuck the Logician was enthralled with clarity and elegance in reasoning. Alongside his faith, family, drumming and teaching, Chuck had a love of air and space travel and the technical aspects of flight. He studied government reports of air crashes and often knew before anyone why a plane had crashed. Chuck had a passion for the sea, tropical rain-forests and the island of Kauai.\n\nThe Story Behind a Plaque in Old Main\n\nHanging in the main hall of Old Main is a plaque that says, “In memory of Samuel Parkinson Cowley, Class of 1925, who died in the service of his country November 28, 1934 for the cause of justice and the safety of his fellow men.”\n\nCowley’s story is fascinating. It sounds more like a B movie drama than real life. But for his parents, his siblings, his wife LaVon and their two infant sons, the drama that resulted in the death of Sam Cowley at 35 was too real.\n\nBorn in Franklin County, Idaho, Samuel went to school in Logan and Preston and graduated from LDS High School in Salt Lake City. He had joined the division of investigation in the Department of Justice (later to become the FBI) in 1929 after receiving a law degree from George Washington University. He worked as an agent in Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago, Salt Lake, Washington, D.C. and Butte, Montana. Samuel moved up rapidly and was an inspector at the time of his death.\n\nPlaced in charge of the pursuit of the John Dillinger gang by J. Edgar Hoover, Samuel moved to Chicago and, after months of searching, he and his men located Dillinger in Chicago. Samuel was in charge the night government agents waited for Dillinger to exit a movie theatre so they could capture him alive. Sensing trouble, Dillinger tried to run and was shot.\n\n“Pretty Boy” Floyd was next to fall into the net spread by Samuel and his men. After a manhunt led by Melvin Purvis closed around him, Floyd was shot trying to elude capture in Ohio.\n\nThe hunt for Lester Gillis, better known as Baby Face Nelson, centered in Chicago after agents learned he had returned there from Nevada. Samuel had men watching several old hideouts of Nelson’s including Niles Center.\n\nTwo agents watching Niles Center encountered Nelson, his wife Helen and a man named John Chase. The outlaws, armed with superior weapons, took off after the lawmen. Speeding down the road they passed Samuel and his partner Herman Hollis, who whirled around to come to the aid of their comrades.\n\nThe agents in the lead car were unaware that Samuel and Hollis were in the chase and didn’t know their rescuers had overtaken the Nelson car. They raced on.\n\nExactly what happened is unknown. Nelson apparently used his wife as a shield and both Hollis and Samuel were cut down quickly. Hollis died immediately. Through mortally wounded, Samuel managed to release a burst of machine gun fire at the fleeing criminals. One of the 45-caliber bullets from his machine gun killed Nelson, whose body was dumped by his companions. Though he lived for a few hours, Samuel died before Nelson’s body was found. He was 35.\n\nSamuel Cowley became a hero. Newspapers throughout the country eulogized him and wrote glowing editorials about this quiet man who never sought the limelight. His brothers from Sigma Chi Fraternity at the Utah Agricultural College presented the plaque to his alma mater to honor him.\n\nAllen Stokes Memorial Tree (1914-1996)\n\nAllen Woodruff Stokes was born in 1914 in Germantown, Pennsylvania. His family belonged to the Quaker faith (Society of Friends) and his early schooling was at private institutions of Quaker affiliation. He attended Harvard in the 1940s and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying wildlife management.\n\nIn 1952, Allen accepted a position as professor in the Forestry School at Utah State Agricultural College. He received a National Science Foundation fellowship for 1958-59, and used it to study animal behavior in England. In 1959, he organized and was president of the Animal Behavior Society in Logan. In 1975, Allen was the first professor from the College of Natural Resources to receive a Robins Award for Teacher of the Year. He was an active participant in the Bridgerland Audubon Society and helped found the Utah Audubon Council in 1985. Allen was also a member of the Logan Forestry Board and he created the Allen Stokes Conservation Award to recognize people or organizations who made substantial contributions toward conservation.\n\nAllen was involved in many organizations on the Utah State University campus and in the community at large, including United Way, Friends of the Cache Libraries, Hospice of Cache Valley, Planned Parenthood and the Gay Lesbian Alliance. He helped found the Logan Friends Meeting, Society of Friends in 1965.\n\nA plaque was placed near the maple tree which reads, “Allen W. Stokes 1914-1996 Planted by the Students of The College of Natural Resources in honor of a man who inspired the lives of so many.”"
