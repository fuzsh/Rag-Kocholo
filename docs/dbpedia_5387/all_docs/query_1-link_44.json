        "text": "Can someone restring a violin to be a viola?\n\nWell, no because it'll only end up being a violin... and the only difference between a viola and a violin is it's strings and the size of it for the note pitch.... Well the thing is that for people that aren't commfortable with the violin finger board, they usually have a viola, but there is violin strings. Which means that you are playing the violin all thought the body and shape is the viola. So you can use violin strings on a viola.\n\nWhat does a size 13 violin mean?\n\nIt means whoever wrote that didn't know what they are talking about. You can have a 13\" viola but violins are refered to in fractions and 1/3 size violin is not made.\n\nHow long does it take for Viola to grow?\n\nViolas range from 11 inches to 17 inches. They may be smaller than 11, but that is the smallest one i have seen. There are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5, 17 inch violas. When you measure a viola, you measure the body (just the wood part, not the finger board and scroll)"
