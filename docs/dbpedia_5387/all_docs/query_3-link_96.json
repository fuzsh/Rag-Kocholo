        "text": "ASHBURNHAM — The Historical Piano Concerts’ 38th Spring series continues with a solo program of late piano works by Franz Schubert at 3 p.m. Sunday, May 5, at the New Dawn Arts Center/Ashburnham Community Church, 84 Main St.\n\n“Late works” might make one think of an old master; in fact, Schubert died months before his 32nd birthday, leaving a huge repertoire of wonderful vocal and instrumental music, mostly under-appreciated until years after his death – overshadowed by the music of his older contemporary, Beethoven.\n\nPianist Ivan Gusev, in his fifth appearance on this concert series, will play the ca.1830 Bösendorfer piano from the Frederick Collection of Historical Grand Pianos. This piano, a very early example from a company established in 1828, still making pianos today, is similar to the pianos the composer knew.\n\nAdmission is $15; free for students and children. For information, contact Patricia Frederick, manager, at piano.fred@juno.com or call 978-827-6232. Played without intermission, the concert should end around 4:15 p.m. The building is handicapped-accessible."
