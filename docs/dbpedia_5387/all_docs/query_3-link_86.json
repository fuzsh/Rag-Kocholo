Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the execution of defendants with an intellectual disability is “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. In a 6 to 3 decision, the Court noted the increasing number of states that blocked the executions of persons with an intellectual disability, reflecting the country’s growing consensus that defendants with an intellectual disability are less culpable for their crimes than those without such a disability. Since this milestone decision, several subsequent cases have referenced this opinion. This article reviews other cases in which the execution of persons with an intellectual disability has been called into question, concluding with the Atkins-related appeal in Fuston v. State. In that case, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals considered Oklahoma statutes regarding the bright-line cutoff by which defendants meet criteria for intellectual disability, as applied to the multiple intelligence measures that were administered to Mr. Fuston. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that Mr. Fuston did not meet the criteria for intellectual disability because of his performance on a single IQ measure administered when he was 12 years old, instead of the totality of his performance on subsequent intelligence measures. Mr. Fuston was also denied 14 other, unrelated propositions on appeal, and the state reaffirmed his death sentence. Implications and recommendations for forensic practice are discussed.\n\nAtkins hearing\n\nintellectual disability\n\ndeath penalty\n\nThe Eighth Amendment of the United States is often cited in the context of capital punishment. It states in part that cruel and unusual punishments should not be inflicted. The matter of executing individuals suspected of intellectual disability was first broached in Penry v. Lynaugh (1989).1 Johnny Paul Penry was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court and sentenced to death. A psychologist testified that Mr. Penry had an IQ “between 50 and 63,” and had the “mental age of a 6 1/2-year-old” (Ref. 1, pp 307–8). During the trial, the jury was not instructed to consider Mr. Penry’s intellectual functioning in its sentencing. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Mr. Penry’s appeal. In a 5 to 4 decision,1 the Court opined that, while the jury should have been instructed to consider Mr. Penry’s intellectual functioning in its sentencing, the Eighth Amendment did not bar the execution of “retarded” defendants. The Court’s ruling was consistent with those held by states at that time, with only two states banning the execution of individuals with an intellectual disability.2 The Court did not revisit this decision until 2001. In McCarver v. North Carolina,3 Ernest Paul McCarver was tried for robbery and murder. The jury returned guilty verdicts for first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Mr. McCarver contended that errors made by the trial court entitled him to a new trial.3 In its proportionality review, the Supreme Court of North Carolina commented that the trial jury found two aggravating circumstances and 14 mitigating circumstances, one of which was that the “defendant’s intelligence quotient [IQ] is in the lower range of borderline intellectual functioning, similar to that of a ten- to twelve-year-old” (Ref. 3, p 48). Following their review, the court did not find that Mr. McCarver’s case presented any serious proportionality question and concluded that it fell within the class of first-degree murders for which they had previously upheld the death penalty (Ref. 3, p 51)."
