Four months later, the state's highest criminal court ruled that Cantu failed to merit a new hearing in his case.

He made the first of many suicide attempts at age 10. While in pre-trial detention, Thomas refused anti-psychotic medication. His devotion to the Bible would lead him to remove his right eye after reading in Matthew 5:29, “If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.” Doctors declared him mentally competent to stand trial.

Barbee, From Tarrant County, arrived on Texas Death Row in February 2006 following his conviction in a double homicide in Fort Worth. He faced execution in 2020 but was granted a stay by the highest criminal court in Texas in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that “a defendant has the right to insist that counsel refrain from admitting guilt.” During his trial, Barbee’s lawyers unexpectedly conceded his guilt to the jury despite Barbee’s insistence on his innocence. In another issue, Barbee has a federal complaint about his assertion that he has the right to have his spiritual advisor in the execution chamber, praying aloud with him. The petition is still making its way through the courts. Barbee’s attorney has asked for a stay of execution based on a similar case, in which the Supreme Court granted a stay. He had been set for execution on Sept. 8, 2021, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked his execution and agreed to take up his case to address the role of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. In March 2022, the court ruled that states must accommodate the wishes of death row inmates who want to have their faith leaders pray and touch them during their executions. After the new execution date was issued, Ramirez’s lawyer said a Houston federal court was still considering a civil rights petition filed on his behalf and that he didn’t believe an execution could proceed until it was resolved.

Ramiro Gonzales, who has been in prison his entire adult life, was condemned in the 2001 death of a woman on his family’s ranch in the Hill Country west of San Antonio. Gonzales’s attorneys said his confession was insufficiently corroborated by independent evidence; attacked a forensic psychiatrist’s testimony that he would be a continuing threat in prison, and challenged instructions the trial judge gave the jury.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution prohibits the execution of anyone deemed mentally incompetent. A rap artist born in the Netherlands, Jasper was 18 when, according to police, he and two others committed a 1998 robbery in which a business partner of Jasper's who owned a San Antonio recording studio was killed and his equipment stolen. Two other men charged in the slaying received life sentences. Jasper's attorneys argued that a potential juror at his January 2000 trial was excluded improperly because he, like Jasper, was black. They also contended that Jasper had poor legal help at his trial. Convicted as the leader of a group of six that lured a developmentally disabled man from New Jersey to Texas in 1999, kidnapped him, and beat him to death as part of a plan to obtain his life insurance benefits. Defense attorneys argued on appeal that Basso's trial attorneys did not present a key expert witness who would have given evidence about her background. The attorneys also said the judge's instructions to the jury were improper. Convicted in the shooting death of Houston police officer Guy P. Gaddis. Officer Gaddis was flagged down outside a southwest Houston night club by a man Tamayo had robbed minutes earlier. Officer Gaddis, 24, arrested and handcuffed Tamayo and was transporting him to jail when Tamayo pulled a pistol that had gone unseen and shot the officer three times in the back of the head. The officer's patrol car ran off the road into a house at which time Tamayo kicked out a window and fled, still handcuffed. He was arrested several blocks away. Tamayo told investigators that he was angry with officer Gaddis because he wouldn't allow him to leave his keys with his wife before being transported to jail. Mexico has pleaded with Texas to delay Tamayo�s execution, saying an international treaty was violated when officers did not inform Tamayo of his right to contact the Mexican consulate and authorities failed to notify Mexico of the arrest. The El Paso man was convicted of killing his girlfriend's 19-month-old son while babysitting in 2000. Avila, a Desert Storm veteran, was previously scheduled to be put to death April 10, 2013. A judge granted a delay to give defense attorneys time to explore new evidence of innocence. An earlier execution date of Dec. 12, 2012, was also stayed.

Martin was convicted of taking a guard's gun, stealing a truck and hitting a horse being ridden by a guard, who fell to her death. His execution date was set when he gave up his appeals. In the case of his co-defendant, John Falk Jr., a mistrial was declared in January 2013. Prosecutors were seeking a retrial. The Los Angeles native was convicted in the 1992 drug-related slayings of four people at a home in Houston. His accomplices were identified as Marion Dudley and Antonio Dunson. The U.S. Supreme Court refused in 1997 to review his case, but four of the nine justices signed an unusual public statement questioning a Texas law prohibiting juries in the sentencing phase of a capital trial from considering how much time the defendant would actually serve in prison if sentenced to a life term instead. Convicted of murdering a man by stabbing him 94 times. The 1999 slaying occurred in the victim's apartment in McAllen, Texas. Authorities said Diaz and another man went to the apartment to rob the victim. On appeal, Diaz argued that his attorneys erred in the sentencing hearing by failing to call relatives to testify about his childhood, which was filled with poverty, neglect, violence and self-mutilation. The mitigating information, he argued, might have swayed a jury to spare his life. The courts rejected the argument, determining that Diaz's defense attorneys were only honoring his request that they not involve his relatives. Condemned after being convicted of two capital murder charges in the 2002 shooting deaths of four women in Donna, Texas. Garza had his appeal rejected in February 2013 by the U.S. Supreme Court. According to court records, Garza was among four men who targeted six women as they left Garcia�s Bar following their shifts as waitresses. State prosecutors said another man had ordered a hit on the women because he believed they had been called to testify against him in an attempted murder case. Authorities said the men mistakenly killed the wrong women. Garza reportedly told law enforcement he witnessed the shootings and knew of the plot but did not fire a gun. A jury convicted him of the crime under the Texas law of parties, which makes it unnecessary to prove a defendant killed a victim in order to hold him or her equally responsible for the crime if a secondary role can be proven. A former architecture student at Texas Tech, he was condemned in the 2001 murders of an 18-year-old woman he was feuding with and a Texas Tech associate dean who happened to be with her. Ross's attorneys argued that police contaminated DNA testing by mishandling it and suggested the slayings stemmed from Birdsall's visits to \"a high-crime area\" to patronize prostitutes. Family members of the victims said the death sentence brought them little peace. The relatives included Birdsall's son, Nat, who opposes the death penalty and said his father did, too. The El Paso man was convicted in the February 2000 slaying of his girlfriend's son while babysitting. Avila served in the military during Desert Storm. The execution of an El Paso man convicted in the beating death of his girlfriend's 19-month-old son in 2000 has been delayed for a 2nd time. Rigoberto Avila Jr., 40, was scheduled to be put to death April 10, 2013, when a judge granted a set-off until July 10 to give defense attorneys time to explore new evidence pointing to his innocence. An earlier execution date of Dec. 12, 2012, was also delayed by a judge. Following a court hearing this morning, 41st District Judge Anna Perez ruled additional time is necessary to allow Avila's defense attorneys to explore possible new evidence of Avila's innocence. Perez also ordered that a new execution date be scheduled for July 10. That date was withdrawn weeks later to give Avila time to litigate new scientific evidence. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in 2010 to hear his appeal. A former crack addict who was sentenced to death for the 1997 slaying of an elderly woman during a home robbery near Dallas. McCarthy, 51, is the former wife of New Black Panther Party founder Aaron Michaels, with whom she has a son. She is one of 10 women on Texas death row. Since an execution date was announced in September 2013, she has been the only woman with a scheduled execution. Three of the nearly 500 people Texas has put to death in the modern era have been women. The week before her scheduled execution April 3, 2013, McCarthy's attorneys persuaded a judge to delay it until June 26. Hours before her date several months earlier, Jan. 29, a judge put it off until April 3. Among the attorneys' assertions was that jury selection in McCarthy's trial was tainted by racism. A jury sentenced him to death after he pleaded guilty to the 1998 fatal shooting of a Port Arthur firefighter who was was slain after arriving at his sister's home during a robbery. Chester's attorneys argued on appeal that he is ineligible for execution because he is mentally impaired, but a divided federal appeals court upheld the sentence. Chester's previous execution date of April 24, 2013, was delayed by the trial court in response to a motion he filed. An argument with a prison guard who had written him up for a minor infraction of the rules led Pruett to stab the guard to death with a shank, according to prosecutors in Corpus Christi who obtained the death penalty against him. The guard was killed in the maximum-security McConnell state prison unit in Bee County, where Pruett was serving a life sentence he began when he was 16. At the time, he was believed to be the youngest person in the state's adult prison system. Condemned in the 1999 shooting death of a Houston Police Officer who was trying to arrest him for driving a stolen Lexus. The officer was alive when backup arrived but died later of his wounds. A delay in the arrival of an ambulance sparked a probe of the Houston Fire Department's dispatching procedures. The contention was that the officer might have survived had he received treatment sooner. Investigators found that the dispatcher initially misdirected the ambulance to a location miles away. Parr grew up in poverty so extreme, he was often given baked dirt to eat. His sister once tried to kill him. Texas plans to execute Parr for the shooting death of a man in a drug deal outside a North Waco convenience store in 2003.

Ninth Texas District Court Judge Fred Edwards set Swearingen's latest execution date after the state Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the convict's most recent appeal. Swearingen was convicted in June 2000 of the abduction and murder of college student Melissa Trotter. He has since been sentenced to die by lethal injection on three occasions � January 2007, January 2009 and August 2011. He was granted stays as his claim of innocence wound its way through the appellate courts. Swearingen's latest stay came Jan. 30, 2013, when a judge struck the execution date of Feb. 27 to allow for further DNA testing. Convicted of capital murder in the 1997 slaying of a toddler kidnapped from Utah and found buried near Sheldon Reservoir northeast of Houston. In appealing his conviction, Ripkowski claimed that he was incompetent to assist his attorney in his defense at trial.

A jury convicted the Los Angeles native, following a three-day trial, of murdering a woman after she entered her East Texas home to find Swain burglarizing it. Among his claims on appeal were that the prosecution should not have been allowed to introduce his confessions at trial, his attorneys failed to investigate evidence of childhood abuse that might have persuaded the jury to spare his life, and a prosecution-requested jury shuffle deliberately placed more whites at the front of the panel of prospective jurors, reducing the likelihood that a black person would be chosen. The 40-year-old was condemned 20 years ago in the robbery-murder of a woman in Dallas. Hines, who was 19 at the time of the crime, was scheduled to die in June, but the Dallas County district attorney's office withdrew the death date for additional DNA testing of evidence. His execution was reset when test results reportedly confirmed his guilt. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected an appeal from Hines the week before his execution. His appellate attorney argued that Hines' trial attorneys \"failed to adequately investigate ... the abuse, neglect and violence (he) was subjected to at a very young age.\" The 40-year-old Lubbock native was condemned following his conviction for two of five shooting deaths during a March 20, 2000, robbery at a Dallas-area car wash.

His lawyer, Lydia Brandt, said she would take the appeal to the Supreme Court. It's the third execution date for the former auto mechanic and laborer convicted in the 1998 deaths of three teens in Amarillo.

Browne's body was found in a pond on the property. He had been shot three times and his body burned. Druery's attorneys argued unsuccessfully in his appeal that his trial lawyers were deficient and jury instructions were faulty. Convicted of murdering a restaurant manager during a 1989 robbery in Fort Worth, Staley, 49, is a paranoid schizophrenic whose severe symptoms have caused three previous execution dates to be withdrawn on the grounds that he was too mentally ill to understand the real reason he was being put to death. Staley's mental incompetence is so frustrating to people who want his death sentence carried out, he has been the subject of a court order to force medication to try to make him sane long enough to qualify for execution. His childhood included a father who had acute alchoholism and a mother who was so mentally ill, she once tried to drive a stake through Staley's chest and, on another occasion, tried to stab him with a butcher knife. One doctor who evaluated Staley said his symptoms included hallucinations; paralysis; depression, sometimes to the point of catatonia; and delusional thinking. The U.S. Supreme Court has not prohibited the execution of mentally ill people, but it bars the execution of anyone so mentally incompetent they do not understand why they are being put to death.

On June 24, 2011, a Montgomery County judge gave Swearingen this execution date -- his third in four years. A growing list of physicians and scientists (10 at last count) say there is virtually no way the now-40-year-old man could have committed the 1998 murder for which he was condemned, that of Melissa Trotter. They all agree that, based on the condition of Trotter�s body, she died at a time when he was in police custody. Swearingen has filed a sixth writ of habeas corpus with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which last turned him down in February 2010. �In this case we have fantastic science from multiple areas,� said his attorney, James Rytting. �All of it converges at the place where Swearingen is excluded from the universe of possible culprits.� One of two men convicted in a 2002 double slaying in Corpus Christi.

News of Balentine's execution date came a year and a half after a last-minute stay voided his original ticket to the death house. A federal appeals court issued the reprieve based on arguments by the Amarillo man's appeals lawyer that the jury might not have condemned him for the 1998 triple murder if his trial attorney had presented mitigating evidence about his childhood, which was filled with violence, poverty and abuse.
