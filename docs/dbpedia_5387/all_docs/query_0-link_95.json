Mrs. Frances HAGERMAN was taken to the Medina Memorial Hospital in the municipal ambulance with chest, shoulder and hand wounds. Her condition is described as \"fair\" today. District Attorney J. Kenneth SERVE and Dr. L F. WATERS, coroner, expect to question her tomorrow regarding details of the shooting.\n\nMedina police received a call from neighbors at 6:30 p. m., to which Patrolman John Pratt responded. When he arrived he said that Carl HAGERMAN was sprawled on the front porch of the house with the top of his head blown off and the shotgun five feet away. He was still alive but expired almost immediately.\n\nProceeding into the house, Patrolman Pratt encountered the bodies of Mrs. Bessie HAGERMAN and the boy in the living room. Mrs. HAGERMAN'S body was half fallen from the davenport, and the boy was lying on the floor where he had been reading the funnies. The little girl apparently attempting to flee out the back door, was found head first down the stairs.\n\nWife of the victim, and the only one to escape death, had fled from the house to the next-door neighbor, the Harry GARNER residence, where she gasped out about the shooting and collapsed on the kitchen floor. She revived for a moment and asked officials about the children before returning to an unconscious condition. She was not informed, however, of their deaths.\n\nInvestigating were Medina police including Sgt. Samuel Gibbs, Patrolmen John Pratt, Fred Goodsell and Inspector Harold Kemp and Cpl. Clarence Pasto of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, in addition to District Attorney Serve and Coroner Waters. Authorities reported it appeared that HAGERMAN \"went berserk in his second-floor bedroom\". The door leading to the hall had been ripped from the hinges. The officers said it apparently had been unlocked and opened from the inside.\n\nThey said HAGERMAN may have been under the impression he was locked in the room and ripped it from the hinges after opening it. A window in the room was shattered and the bulb in pull-light broken. The cord for the light lay on the floor.\n\nThey said a gun locker in the son's room was in \"general disarray\". They said HAGERMAN apparently went there from his bedroom, snatched the shotgun from a rack and pulled six shells from a hunting-coat pocket.\n\nOfficials said that Andrew was shot in the side and throat, Nancy in the side, and their grandmother in the side and throat. They further stated that the telephone wires in the house had been cut before the shooting. No reason was determined for the act by the veteran, bartender at the Lincoln Post Veterans of Foreign Wars. Monday was his day off and he spent the day in Niagara Falls, returning approximately at 3 p.m. It was not determined by authorities when he returned to his home.\n\nApparently he was not expected home for supper, as the table in the kitchen was set for four places. On the range was the supper all cooked, including chops in the pan, with everything untouched. The front porch, living room, kitchen and back stairs are all spattered with blood. In the front yard is a tiny sled apparently owned by Andrew and in the front hall is a doll carriage with dolls, the property of Nancy, a third grade student at Ensign Street School. Andrew is in the kindergarten in the same school.\n\nAt the completion of the investigation the bodies of the father and two children were removed to the Cleary Funeral Home, Park Avenue and that of the veteran's mother to the Hartt Funeral Home, Pearl Street.\n\nMrs. Bessie Amy HAGERMAN, a lifelong resident of Medina, was born August 10, 1887, in the Town of Ridgeway, the daughter of the late George and Alice (COLEMAN) BACON. Her husband, Andrew HAGERMAN, died approximately ten years ago. Since that time Mrs. HAGERMAN has been employed at the R. H Newell Co. A member of the Baptist Church, Mrs. HAGERMAN was a member of the King's Daughters Class of the Church. She was a member and past noble grand of Welcome Rebekah Lodge.\n\nSurviving are four brothers, Adelbert BACON and George BACON of Horan Road and Bert BACON of Shelby and Milford BACON of Detroit, Mich., and one sister, Mrs. Minnie ROMP of Medina.\n\nFuneral services will be held from the Hartt Funeral Home, Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock with the Rev. Ralph D. ROSS of the Baptist Church officiating. Burial will be in Boxwood Cemetery.\n\nCarl HAGERMAN was born Feb. 13, 1921, in Medina, and was graduated from the Medina High School in 1938. During World War II he served with the Marines and fought on Iwo Jima. He was a member and past commander of Lincoln Post Veterans of Foreign Wars. His funeral services will be held Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock from the Cleary Funeral Home with the Rev. Ralph D. ROSS of the Baptist Church officiating.

His wife attended a social at Benjamin BALDWIN's, a cousin, who lives about four miles this side of their home, and stayed all night, Mr. HAKES remaining home alone. The hired man, Mr. Beck, who lives in a tenement house, says that when he went to do the morning work, Mr. HAKES not being around, he went to the house to see if he was there and, the doors being locked, he went for Mr. Buell, a neighbor, and together they returned to the house and gaining access, found Mr. HAKES dead on the bed; his trousers lay on the floor, also his empty pocketbook. A 50 cent piece lay near, and also a towel. Circumstances point to suicide as cause of death, though some hold to the theory of murder. The coroner and district attorney are now on the case and an inquest will soon be held.\n\n(Interment in Sandy Creek Cemetery)\n\nPosted by: Orleans County GenWeb staff, 12 Feb 2007\n\nReturn to the top of this page\n\nHALE\n\nNELSON HALE (29 Dec 1817 - 3 Jan 1910)\n\nNewspaper: The Medina Tribune; Thurs., 6 Jan. 1910 (from a column called About The County)\n\nSurnames: HALE, SAWENS\n\nThe death of Nelson HALE, one of the oldest residents in this part of the state, occurred Monday at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Russell (Elizabeth) SAWENS in Albion, aged 92 years.\n\n(Interment in Mt.

Two prominent men died on the same day - Monday - (Benoni HALL and David I. HENION) and both will be conveyed to the tomb on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Benona HALL died Monday morning at the advanced age of seventy-eight. He had been feeble all Winter, but latterly had been improving until last Thursday morning, when he was attacked by the fatal \"typhoid pneumonia,\" and in the brief space of four days, he died. Mr. HALL was emphatically a \"pioneer.\" He came to this town in the year 1816; and, by his powerful arm and energetic spirit, aided in bringing out this beautiful land from the dark wilderness state in which he found it. We remember to have heard in our boyhood days, the wonderful stories of labor and hardship, and that the subject of this memoir was in the foremost rank. Few could excel him in the \"chopping and logging,\" and we remember to have heard him say that not a drop of whiskey was brought into requisition to aid him in his work. The farm now owned by Russil Sill, in the east part of the town, was the scene of his first labor; and except an interval of a few years spent in the town of Ridgeway, this town has been his home all these years. He was married when seventeen years old to Phebe BARRY, who long ago preceeded him to the spirit land. Forty years ago, another became the partner of the toils of the deceased, and now mourns for her long-time companion.\n\nBut Mr. HALL's character stands out most prominent as a pioneer of the M. E. Church. He was one of the class of seven, formed about fifty-three years ago, which was the nucleus of the church of this place. All of the seven but one, Father Lott, still lingers; but the church they planted still lives and cherishes the memory of her honored founders. Brother HALL's house was the minister's home in that wonderful time. Fifty-five years a faithful and earnest Christian man; his last days were peaceful, and his death triumphant.\n\n(Interment in Lynhaven Cemetery)\n\nPosted by: Orleans County Genweb staff, 17 Jul 2007\n\nCAROLINE M.

It is difficult to find an explanation of the accident itself but the facts in the case are stated as follows: The automobile owned and driven by Alfred J. SKINNER was preceeding southward up Main street in Knowlesville where the occupants, Mr. SKINNER and his three daughters, Mildred aged 18, Helen aged 12 and Dorothy aged 10. - and Marion HARDING aged 14 and Herschel her brother aged 10, only children of Mr. and Mrs. Chester M. HARDING, Jr., -had attended Sunday School; a passenger trolley had a few minutes before gone east past the crossing, an express trolley was coming round the curve west of the depot which is the only obstruction to the view up the track from the brick church up to the crossing. All sorts of claims are made as to the blame for the accident, and it is hard to gather the truth of the matter. The trolley car was at any rate a through one and did not stop at Knowlesville. The impact was sudden and severe. The large automobile, a six cylinder, seven passenger Cole, was struck on the rear of the tonneau and was turned completely around, landing against a stone retaining wall on the southeast corner of the crossing. The body of the car was wrecked. Herschel HARDING was carried with the auto and his head was crushed against the stone wall, Mildred and Helen SKINNER were thrown some distance, Marion HARDING was found, with her neck broken, near the wreck of the automobile while Mr. SKINNER and Dorothy were thrown clear of the wreckage, both sustaining bad bruises and lacerations. Helen SKINNER died shortly after 3 o'clock in the Medina Hospital whither she had been rushed on the trolley car which struck the auto. The other three were instantly killed.\n\nAn investigation into the accident is to be made by the Public Service Commission it is reported. Car stopping tests were made Monday afternoon by railroad officials and representatives of the Public Service Commission, the same car No. 301, being used. Coroner Munson is to hold an inquest this Thursday afternoon when it is expected that the officials of the road and experts will be among the witnesses to be examined.\n\n2nd article in same newspaper as above\n\nTwo double funerals with a single burial service at Mt. Albion Cemetery were held yesterday for the four victims of the accident. The funeral of the two children of Mr. and Mrs. HARDING was held at 1:30 from the home, and that of the two SKINNER children at 2 oclock, Rev. C. A. Lawrence, pastor of Knowlesville Presbyterian Church, officiating. At the single committal service at Mt. Albion Cemetery, the four little victims were buried at the same time on neighboring plots. Schoolmates acted as bearers.\n\nPosted by: Orleans County Genweb staff, 12 Apr 2006\n\nReturn to the top of this page\n\nHARE\n\nHATTIE M.
