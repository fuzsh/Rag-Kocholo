        "text": "Frederick & Nelson was one of Seattle’s foremost department stores and was considered by many to be a Seattle institution. Founded by partners D.E. Frederick and Nels Nelson in 1890 as a second hand furniture store on Seattle’s Front Street, the store expanded steadily in its early years, starting with the sale of new furniture after the acquisition of the Queen City Furniture Co. in 1891. Early on, the store provided home delivery service, using its fleet of horse drawn delivery wagons. Among the store’s early customers were the local Native Americans, prospectors heading to the Yukon and the new hotels which had sprung up to accommodate the prospectors.\n\nThe store moved into the Rialto building at 2nd and Madison in 1897; the business gradually developed into a department store under the partners’ philosophy that their store should provide whatever merchandise their customers ask for. By 1906, Frederick & Nelson had annexed more space in the Rialto building, opened its first tearoom and introduced ready-to-wear men’s and women’s fashions, a novel alternative to fine clothing made-to-order.\n\nFounder Nels Nelson fell ill and died on a New York bound steamer in 1907. Under the leadership of D.E. Frederick, Frederick & Nelson continued to grow, and by 1914, D.E. decided to build a six-story store at 5th Avenue and Pine Street. Though detractors referred to the decision to build outside of the city’s retail district as “Frederick’s folly,” the store, designed by architect John Graham, was an instant success. The new store included a tearoom, beauty salon, post office, auditorium, nursery and a fully equipped medical facility. The store also hosted many events, such as the weekly fashion shows staged each Wednesday in the tearoom.\n\nIn 1929, at age 69, D.E. Frederick decided to retire, selling the store to Marshall Field & Co. for six million dollars. In spite of the initial concern of its customers about Frederick & Nelson becoming part of a vast retail system, the store continued to grow both as a business and as a Seattle tradition. Marshall Fields executive William Street was hired to run Frederick & Nelson in 1938, and he guided the store through its successful period from the recovery after the Great Depression, through the World War II period, the post-war boom and the store expansion and growth of the 1950s. For example, Frederick & Nelson became involved in the war effort in the 1940s, opening a temporary branch store on the grounds of the Boeing’s No. 2 plant and winning a special merit award for its promotion of war bonds and stamps in the war loan drive. Later, as people began moving to the suburbs after the war, the first of the suburban branches opened in the Bellevue Shopping Square in 1946. After a major renovation, the flagship Seattle store reopened with 10 floors above ground and 12 shopping levels.\n\nOver the years, Frederick & Nelson had supported the local community, for example by promoting the Seattle Symphony with special display windows and its black tie “Symphoneve” benefits. Its auditorium was also used by art groups as well as by civic organizations.\n\nThough the tradition of in-store Christmas caroling by staff began as early as1918, the store tradition of the Santa Claus window at 6th and Pine began in 1943, with children posing with Santa for a holiday photograph.\n\nBusiness eventually began to decline as discount retailers attracted customers and increasing control by the Marshall Fields inhibited local decision-making. In 1982, Batus, Inc. bought Marshall Fields & Co. and Frederick & Nelson became part of Batus’ retail division. Continuing to lose money, Frederick & Nelson was sold in 1989 to local investors who sought to restore the store’s reputation. Losses continued to mount, however, and the store filed for bankruptcy in 1991, finally closing its doors on May 31, 1992. The building was sold to Nordstrom, which reopened the building as its flagship store in 1998.\n\nThe collection is comprised of textual materials, photographs, scrapbooks and audio-visual materials from the Frederick & Nelson department store, primarily the Seattle store. The bulk of the collection seems to have originated from the Sales Promotion department, though the collection also includes materials from the Human Resources and Training departments, Food Service department, and Display and Sign department.\n\nSales Promotion materials include catalogs and mailers, and files about special events at the store such as autograph parties, fashion shows and other promotional events. This series also contains historical materials about the store which seem to have been collected for use in promotional and anniversary publications over the years, and specifically for use in the Frederick & Nelson centennial book “More than a Store” by Robert Specter. These materials include clippings, memos and ephemera such as menus and event programs.\n\nFood service materials include a collection of menus from the various Frederick & Nelson eating establishments, such as the Tea Room and the Men’s Grill. Human Resources materials include over 70 years of the staff newsletter “Between Ourselves”, and training manuals and sales procedure guides, which illustrate the detailed attention that Frederick & Nelson paid to customer relations.\n\nThe Photographs series parallels the textual materials, containing photographs of in-store events such as book signings and fashion shows, and store anniversary events. Historical photos include images of store founders D.E. Frederick and Nels Nelson, and store executives, managers and staff over the years. Other photographs document the early Frederick & Nelson store, including the store in the Rialto building, and horse drawn delivery carts and delivery trucks from the early 1900s. Later store photos document the downtown Seattle flagship store as well as the several branch stores, including store openings and the remodel of the Seattle store in the early 1950s. The photographs also document interior store displays and window displays between 1939 and 1977, including the annual Christmas display and Santa Claus windows, and special displays such as the many war bonds promotional displays of the mid-1940s.\n\nAudio-visual materials include recordings of radio and television ads, videotapes of fashion shows and films of Uncle Mistletoe puppet shows at the store in the 1960s."
