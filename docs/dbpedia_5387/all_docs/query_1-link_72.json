Behnke, well known young business man of this city, died two hours later after having been brought to his home in this city. Mr. Behnke suffered an attack of acute indigestion which affected his heart and caused a hemorrhage which was fatal. The funeral will be held Friday afternoon from the home 825 N. Ninth street and will be in charge of the Masonic order. Mr. Behnke, who was engaged in business as an optometrist conducting a store on Washington street in this city, had recently established a branch office at Two Rivers and was attending to business there when the fatal attack came. Dr. Christiansen was summoned and after attending Mr. Behnke, accompanied him to this city where he was taken to his home and passed away in a short time. News A Great Shock News of the death of Mr. Behnke spread rapidly and was a great shock to the community where he had made his home practically all of his life. He had not been ill. Mr. Behnke was a native of this city, having been born here June 19, 1882, forty-two years ago. He attended the old South Side high school from which he graduated and later took up a course in optical work at a Chicago school. After completing his studies he was for some time associated with the Tegtmeyer company at Milwaukee and nine years ago returned here to engage in business and had been very successful.

Both parties are well known young people of the city. The bride has been a teacher in the schools this past few years. Mr. Behnke is a well known young professional man, conducting optical parlors on Washington Street. After their return from a wedding trip they will take up their residence at 825 North Ninth Street. Manitowoc Pilot, Thurs., Jan. 1, 1920\n\nCHARLES AUGUST BEHNKE (d. 1912) C. A. BEHNKE MEETS DEATH IN THE LAKE Believed That He was Overcome While Walking on Beach BODY FOUND IN LAKE AT GREEN ST. BULLETIN. Physicians who examined the body of Mr. Behnke give the opinion that Mr. Behnke suffered an attack of apoplexy and fell into the water while walking along the beach, and the fact that the body was so near the shore and in but a little depth of water is pointed to as upholding this belief. Suicide or accident caused the death of Charles A. Behnke, a pioneer tailor with a shop at 911 Washington St., late Wednesday afternoon Behnke's dead body having been found in the lake at the foot of Green St. by boys playing in the vicinity shortly after 5 o'clock. The police department was notified and took charge of the body which was removed to the Frazier morgue where it was later identified, and the family notified. Mr. Behnke had been in poor health for some time and recently suffered partial paralysis of the arms which prevented him from continuing his business as a tailor and he had become despondent. For several days it had been his practice to visit the city water plant where the operation in drilling new wells is under way, and he left home Wednesday at 2 o'clock intending to go to the plant. Boys in the vicinity of Green St. discovered the dead body floating in the water near the shore at 5 o'clock. It is possible that Mr. Behnke, while walking along the beach to or from the water works station, was overcome by an attack of apoplexy and fell into the lake, this being suggested by the fact that the body when found was just at the edge of the lake. However, the theory of the authorities is that Behnke deliberately ended his own life by throwing himself in the lake. Mr. Behnke, according to his wife, had remarked on several occasions of late that death by drowning was the easiest a man could have and this suggests that he may have contemplated suicide. His despondency, which of late had been more marked, also supports the theory of suicide. Another fact that points to suicide is that Behnke's umbrella, which he carried with him in leaving home early in the day was found sticking in the sand about 150 feet south of the spot where the body was found. It is believed that Behnke, determined upon ending his life, desired that his body be recovered for burial and that he placed the umbrella in upright position to mark the spot where he had courted death. The umbrella had been firmly placed in the sand, evidencing that it had been intentionally placed there. The identity of the dead man was not established at once, Coroner Falge, who knew Mr. Behnke personally and who was summoned to take the body, being the first to recognize the man. The body was fully dressed and had been in the water but a short time. Mr. Behnke was 62 years of age, having been born in 1850, and he had been a resident of this city a greater part of his life, having conducted the tailoring establishment on Washington St., for a long term of years. He had not been strong for a long time and after suffering the attack which paralyzed his arm and made it impossible for him to continue his work, he had become despondent and it is believed that he committed suicide in a moment of temporary insanity, due to his trouble. Mr. Behnke is survived by his aged wife and two sons, Carl of Milwaukee and Arthur of Oshkosh. Mr. Behnke was well known through his business and was well acquainted in the county. It is expected that the body of Mr. Behnke will be taken to Milwaukee for burial and Mrs. Behnke may make her future home in that city. Manitowoc Daily Herald, September 5, 1912 ********* BODY IS TO BE CREMATED Charles Behnke's Wish to Be Complied With By Family In compliance with a wish which he had frequently expressed, the body of the late Charles A. Behnke, the Washington street merchant, will be cremated. The body will be taken to Milwaukee by the two sons of the decedent tomorrow, leaving the city at 8 and will be cremated in that city. Brief funeral services will be held here That Mr. Behnke suffered a slight stroke of paralysis Wednesday morning, the day of his death, has been learned and the fact strengthens the belief that his death was not due to suicide but was that he suffered another attack while walking along the beach and fell into the water. Arthur Behnke of Milwaukee, son of the dead man, may return to this city to make his home with his mother and engage in business here. Manitowoc Daily Herald, September 6, 1912 P. 1 ******** [C.A.
