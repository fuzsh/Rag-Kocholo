        "text": "Anglo-Allied Army in Flanders and France - 1815\n\nBy Ron McGuigan\n\nWhen the Duke of Wellington arrived to take to the command of the Allied Army in early April 1815 he found mainly the original Subsidiary Army, commanded by HRH General The Prince of Orange, which had been stationed in the Low Countries since the end of the previous war in 1814. This was a small force of British and Hanoverians kept here to assist with the formation of the new country of The Netherlands and to guarantee its borders. When Napoleon left Elba and landed in France, taking over the government of that country once again, the Allied Nations at the Congress of Vienna resolved to remove him from the throne and this meant that the army in Flanders would have to be reinforced and reorganized for a war.\n\nOn 11 April 1815, Wellington issued a General Order assuming the command of the Allied Forces in Flanders and he reorganized the army, merging the British-Hanoverian Forces with those of the Netherlands. The army was reinforced over the next three months (April, May, and June) by Great Britain, The Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau. The army, at this time, was then made up of the forces of Great Britain (including the King’s German Legion of Hanoverians), the Hanoverian Subsidiary Corps in British pay (part of the old Subsidiary Army), the forces of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands (Dutch, Belgians, and Nassauers in Netherlands Service) and the treaty contingent forces of Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau.\n\nThis article will trace the organization of Wellington’s Allied Army from the start of the Campaign in Flanders and France, 15 June 1815 until the end of the war and the creation of the Army of Occupation in November 1815. I have used the more common names of Dutch and Belgian to describe the units of the Netherlands Army, however, officially they were referred to as 'North Netherlands' for the Dutch and 'South Netherlands' for the Belgians. Wherever possible, names of officers have been spelled according to their country of origin, but ranks are given in English.\n\nAs sources for the British army were more readily available, I was able to identify the officers and command changes down to replacement commanders of regiments/batteries for that army which I could not do for the Allied units.\n\nIt was surprising to discover, that although the Battle of Waterloo is extensively covered, how difficult it was to compile this list. The sources were not consistent and some information almost nonexistent. Any errors and omissions are mine and I would request any corrected or updated information that the reader may possess be posted on the Napoleon-Series.org Discussion Forum for my use, as well as, for the other readers.\n\nAnglo-Allied Army in Flanders and France - 1815\n\nThe following is the organization of the army as in General Orders: June 1815\n\nCommander-in-Chief: Field Marshal Sir Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.\n\nQuartermaster-General: Vacant.\n\nDeputy Quartermaster-General: Lt Colonel [Brevet Colonel] Sir William de Lancey\n\nAdjutant-General: Major General Sir Edward Barnes.\n\nDeputy Adjutant-General: Lt Colonel [Brevet Colonel] Sir John Elley\n\nCommander, Royal Artillery: Lt Colonel [Brevet Colonel] Sir George Wood\n\nCommander, King’s German Artillery: Major [Brevet Lt Colonel] Sir Julius Hartmann.\n\nI Corps: General HRH Prince Willem of Orange.\n\nChief-of-Staff: Major General Jean, Baron de Constant Rebecque.\n\nAdjutant-General: Major General Herman van der Wyck.\n\nCommander, Artillery: Major General Carl van Gunckel.\n\n1st British Division: Major General George Cooke.\n\n1st British Brigade: Major General Peregrine Maitland.\n\n1st Foot Guards, 2nd Bn.; (2nd Major [Lt Colonel & Brevet Colonel] Henry Askew)\n\n1st Foot Guards, 3rd Bn.; (3rd Major [Lt Colonel & Brevet Colonel] William Stewart)\n\n2nd British Brigade: Major General Sir John Byng.\n\nColdstream Foot Guards, 2nd Bn.; (2nd Major [Lt Colonel & Brevet Colonel] Alexander Woodford)\n\n3rd Foot Guards, 2nd Bn.; (2nd Major [Lt Colonel & Brevet Colonel] Francis Hepburn)\n\nArtillery: Lt Colonel Stephen Adye.\n\nSandham’s Foot Battery, 3rd Bn.; (Captain Charles Sandham)\n\n2nd Horse Battery, KGL; (Captain [Brevet Major] Jacob Kuhlmann)\n\n3rd Anglo-Hanoverian Division: Lt General Sir Karl von Alten.\n\nChief-of -Staff: Colonel August von Berger, Field Bn.

Additionally, reinforcements were rushed to the army to replace casualties and to increase the British Contingent. The following will detail the changes which occurred within the army between 16 June and 30 November, 1815, when the Army of Occupation was formed.\n\nStaff:\n\nMajor General [Local Lt General] Sir George Murray was appointed the Quartermaster-General from 25 June. He was en-route from British North America (originally in April, Major General Hudson Lowe had filled this position). No one was appointed the Quartermaster-General pending Murray’s return and the position was vacant. The Deputy Quartermaster-General, Brevet Colonel Sir William De Lancey, acted as the Quartermaster-General until he was mortally wound at Waterloo. He was replaced by Lt Colonel Sir Charles Broke. Major General Barnes, the Adjutant-General was severely wounded at Waterloo and would return to duty by 25 July. He was replaced by Lt Colonel John Waters until Brevet Colonel Sir John Elley, the Deputy Adjutant-General, assumed temporary command once he had recovered from his Waterloo wound. Both Lt Generals Sir Edward Paget and Sir George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie were suggested for commands in the army in April. Paget for a Corps command and Lord Dalhousie for either a Division or another Corps. Major General Sir Henry Fane was offered a command with the cavalry when the army was forming prior to the battle. Active operations had ceased before they decided to join and they declined to serve in an army of occupation. Attached to the Quartermaster-General's Department were 3 (later 4) companies of the Royal Staff Corps under Lt Colonel [Brevet Colonel] William Nicolay. By 21 June, Major [Brevet Lt Colonel] Sir George Scovell formed the Staff Corps of Cavalry and commanded it as Major Commandant.\n\nI Corps:\n\nGeneral HRH The Prince of Orange was wounded at Waterloo and replaced by Major-General Byng. For a time in July, HRH The Prince of Orange returned; but, he was gone to Brussels by the end of that month. He was replaced in command by local Lt General Howard in August. As General HRH The Prince of Orange was also the Commander of the Netherlands Mobile Army , he had a large number of Netherlands' Officers attached to his Staff. When he was absent from the army, Lt General Baron Chasse exercised the command of the Netherlands Mobile Army, until Prince Frederik replaced the Prince of Orange in August. Until just prior to the Battle of Quatre Bras, the Netherlands Cavalry Division had been under command of I Corps.
