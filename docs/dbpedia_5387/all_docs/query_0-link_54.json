The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) [in French the \"BRI \" Banque de Reglements Internationaux, and in German the \"BIZ \" Bank fur Internationalen Zahlungesausgleich] was established as an international financial institution, enjoying special immunities, pursuant to the Hague Agreements of January 20, 1930. The founder shareholding members were the central banks of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Within two years of its founding, nineteen other European central banks had subscribed to the Bank's capital. The Bank opened its doors in Basel, Switzerland on May 17, 1930. Its main objectives were to act as trustee or agent in regard to international financial settlements, particularly in regard to German reparations under the so-called Young Plan adopted at the 1930 Hague Conference; to promote central bank cooperation; and, to provide additional facilities for international financial operations. During the 1930s the BIS developed its activities along these lines. Before long, however, the Bank's functions in regard to German reparations were interrupted. The international financial crisis of 1931, coming on top of the world depression, led first to a partial and soon to a complete suspension of German reparation payments (Luasanne Agreement, 1932). During World War II the president of the bank was an American Thomas H. McKittrick. The general manager was a Frenchman, Roger Auboin; and the assistant general manager was Paul Hechler, a German and Nazi Party member. Among its board of directors were Hermann Schmitz, head of I.G. Farben; Baron Kurt von Schroder, head of the J. H. Stein Bank of Cologne (and leading officer and financier of the Gestapo); Walter Funk, the Reichsbank president; and, Emil Puhl, Reichsbank vice-president. At the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 the Allies called, in Resolution V, for the elimination of the BIS, in part because it was seen as a money-laundering entity for the Germans. In 1948 the BIS handed over $4 million in looted gold to the Allies. The BIS still exists, located in Basel, Switzerland. For a brief introduction to the BIS's wartime activities see Charles Higham, Trading With the Enemy: The Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1949 (New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1995), pp. 1-19, and Arthur L.

Margaret Clarke, a Federal Economic Administration historian, in 1946 wrote a 193-page history of the Safehaven Program, \" entitled \"Safehaven Study. \" This study was never published. A copy of it is contained in the Records of the Federal Economic Administration (RG 169). It is a useful tool for understanding the organization, administration, and activities of the Safehaven Program. Early in her study she states \"the Safe haven Program, or project, was organized as one of the chief instruments by which the United States Government meant to defeat Germany's aim to rebuild its strength outside of Germany. The fundamental purpose was to frustrate Germany's attempt to penetrate foreign economies, to transfer internal assets beyond reach of the Allies, to evade payment of reparations by having no apparent resources, and to avoid any share in the rehabilitation of Europe. The term safe haven, originally designed as a code phrase to explain the activities of the first American representatives sent to Europe to explore the nature and extent of the German plan, lost its virtue as a secret designation so soon that the term became descriptive of the counter-plan of this government (One of the early uses of the term Safehaven was on September 28, 1944, when the Secretary of State sent a circular airgram to certain diplomatic and consular officers, instructing them to \"preserve all intelligence of this general nature [he was referring earlier to German assets abroad] which comes into your possession since information on looted and flight capital will tend to merge with information relating to German assets generally. In order to expedite prompt distribution, all cables, airgrams, and despatches on this subject should contain the code word 'SAFEHAVEN' \" Foreign Relations of the United States, 1944, Vol. II pp. 234-235) To those concerned with preventing resurgence of German industrial and military strength, Safe Haven became a name of the activity they were engaged in, although later on, the term External Security was used as more descriptive of the program. \"(Clarke, \"Safehaven Study, \" p. 21). \"There were, \" she continues, \"specific ends toward which the Safe Haven project worked: To restrict and prevent German economic and cultural penetration outside of Germany; to block Germany from transferring internal assets to neutral countries; to insure that German wealth would be administered by the Allies so German payment of war reparations would be assured; to make certain that Germany's resources would be available for use in the rehabilitation of Europe; to make possible the return to legal owners of properties looted from countries once occupied by the Germans; and to prevent the escape of strategic German personnel to neutral havens. The all-over purpose was, of course, to implement plans for lasting peace, by helping to make it impossible for Germany to start another war. \"(Clarke, \"Safehaven Study, \" p. 22). In her study Clarke critiqued the Safehaven Program. She observed that the program \"was not organized by the highest levels of administrative authority. \" Further, \"the Treasury Department showed no interest at first... \" but... \"later on the Foreign Funds Control of Treasury became very much interested and tried in fact to take over the direction and conduct of the entire matter. \" \"The State Department, \" she stated, \"in general was cooperative although...there was sometimes failure of sympathy on the part of the State representation at the neutral capitals. Indeed, at one point, suggestions and attempts were made to secure a decision from the President which would settle once and for all the jurisdictional disputes and clarify the correct roles of the various interested agencies. This was never accomplished. \" \"Within FEA itself, \" she added, \"there was intra-agency conflict.... The conflict is not surprising in light of the fact that no one actually knew where authority lay. \" Further, \"by the time Safe Haven got under way certain features of the economic warfare program were diminishing or disappearing. Safe Haven offered an opportunity to continue a challenging and absorbing game. Everyone wanted to participate in it. Everyone did, in a manner of speaking; and thus confusion, jealousies, misunderstandings and waste resulted. Had the project been clearly defined by the FEA Administration, and had authority for it been placed definitely and absolutely in the hands of a single director, many of the difficulties which did arise would have been overcome before they manifested themselves. \" \"Likewise, \" she continues, \" it can be speculated that had such an integration been managed at first, State, Treasury and FEA would have acted always as a unit, and not as sometimes happened, as a tri-dimensional agency whose three sides pulled against each other. \"(Clarke, \"Safehaven Study, \" pp. 189-190). The various spellings of the Safehaven Program (e.g., Safehaven project, Safe Haven reports) in this finding aid reflects the diverse number of Government agencies participating in it and the fact that there was no ultimate authority for the program. Researchers should be aware that the Departments of State and Treasury (primarily the Foreign Funds Control unit) and the Foreign Economic Administration all believed, to one degree or another, that they were the key agency. Similarly, many agencies, including the Military and Naval Establishment, the Office of Strategic Services, all supplied the Safehaven intelligence to the Departments of State and Treasury and the Foreign Economic Administration. And those three agencies also gathered their own intelligence. Thus researchers will find Safehaven-related records identified throughout this finding aid. [Back to text]\n\n11.

At the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire Resolution No. VI was adopted. It not only made recommendations regarding steps to be taken to guard United Nations interest in German external assets, but referred specifically to the broader aims of the Safehaven Program. The preamble to the resolution accused Axis leaders, enemy nationals and their collaborators of transferring assets through and to neutral countries for the purpose of concealing them, and of thus maintaining Axis power, influence, and ability \"to plan future aggrandizement and world domination... \" The preamble names loot, transfers of assets of occupied and neutral nations accomplished by threat, transfers of Axis property by use of blinds and cloaks, as the kinds of wealth Germany found it useful and easy to conceal. It also marked the guilt of puppet governments and of Nazi sympathizers for future reference. The preamble concludes \"Whereas, the United Nations have declared their intention to do their utmost to defeat the methods of dispossession practiced by the enemy, have reserved their right to declare invalid any transfers of property belonging to persons with occupied territory, and have taken measures to protect and safeguard property, within their respective jurisdictions, owned by occupied countries and their nationals, as well as to prevent the disposal of looted property in United Nations markets; therefore the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference 1) takes note of and fully supports steps taken by the United Nations for the purpose of: (a) uncovering, segregating, controlling, and making appropriate disposition of enemy assets; (b) preventing the liquidation of property looted by the enemy, locating and tracing ownership and control of such looted property, and taking appropriate measures with a view to restoration to its lawful owners. \" The resolution further recommends that the governments represented at the Conference call on the governments of neutral countries: \"(a) to take immediate measures to prevent any disposition or transfer within territories subject to their jurisdiction of any (1) assets belonging to the Government or any individuals of institutions within those United Nations occupied by the enemy; and (2) looted gold, currency, art objects, securities, other evidences of ownership in financial or business enterprises, and of other assets looted by the enemy; as well as to uncover, segregate and hold at the disposition of the post-liberation authorities in the appropriate country any such assets within territory subject to their jurisdiction; (b) to take immediate measures to prevent the concealment by fraudulent means or otherwise within countries subject to their jurisdiction of any (1) assets belonging to, or alleged to belong to, the Government of and individuals or institutions within enemy countries; (2) assets belonging to, or alleged to belong to, enemy leaders, their associates and collaborators; and to facilitate their ultimate delivery to the post-armistice authorities. \" United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July 1 to July 22, 1944, Final Act and Related Documents (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1944).
