The subcommittee met, pursuant to call of the chairman, as a resumption of the hearing recessed on July 6, 1933, at 10:30 o'clock a.m. in the caucus room of the Senate Office Building, Senator Duncan U. Fletcher presiding. Present: Senators Fletcher (chairman), Adams (substitute for Barkley and proxy for Costigan), Norbeck, Townsend, and Couzens. Present also: Senator Goldsborough. Present also: Ferdinand Pecora, counsel to the committee; Julius Silver and David Saperstein, associate counsel to the committee; and Frank J. Meehan, chief statistician to the committee; George S. Franklin, Wallace P. Zachry, Warren Leslie, Walter G. Dunnington, Clifton Murphy, John T. Cahill, and Bernhard Knollenberg, counsel for Dillon, Eead & Co.; Boot, Clark, Buckner & Ballaritine, George H. Murphy of counsel, counsel for United States & Foreign Securities Corporation. The CHAIRMAN. The subcommittee will please come to order. We resume the hearings where we left off on July 6 last, and will proceed from that point on. Mr. Pecora, who is your first witness ? Mr. PECORA. Mr. Clarence Dillon. The CHAIRMAN. YOU will come forward to the committee table, Mr. Dillon, hold up your right hand, and be sworn. You solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, regarding the matters now under investigation by the committee. So help you God. Mr. DILLON. I do. The CHAIRMAN. YOU may be seated, Mr. Dillon. And, Mr. Pe- cora, you may proceed. TESTIMONY OF CLABENCE DILLON, OF DILLON, EEAD & CO., NEW YOEK CITY Mr. PECORA. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, I deem it only fair to the firm represented by the witness, Mr. Clarence Dillon, to state to you that the members of the investigating staff of this committee have received from Mr. Dillon and his associates in that firm, from the very outset, the fullest possible measure of cooperation, aid, and assistance that we have asked for in our investigation of various matters connected with their business. At no 1535 1536 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES time has there been the slightest hindrance or obstacle placed in our path by their office; but on the contrary they have extended every courtesy and accommodation, which has all contributed, to facilitate our work of investigation. I think it only fair and just to the witness and his firm that that statement be made by me on the record, and I am very happy to make it. The CHAIRMAN. The committe is very glad to hear that statement. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, give your full name and address to the committee reporter for the record, please. Mr. DILLON. Clarence Dillon. My business address is 28 Nassau Street, New York City. My residence is Bedminster, N.J. Mr. PECORA. Will you just raise your voice. This is a large room and the acoustics are not of the best. Mr. DILLON. Yes, sir. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, are you connected with the firm or company known as Dillon, Eead & Co.? Mr. DILLON. I am, Mr. PECORA. HOW sir. long has that organization or firm been in ex- istence? Mr. DILLON. DO you mean the present firm or its predecessor firm? Mr. PECORA. The present firm, the firm that is called Dillon, Eead &Co. Mr. DILLON. William A. Eead & Co., our immediate predecessor firm, became Dillon, Eead & Co. in January, the 14th, I think, 1921. Mr. PECORA. And has continued in existence under that firm name and style of Dillon, Eead & Co. since that time to the present time? Mr. DILLON. It has; yes, sir. Mr. PECORA. What is the legal form of that organization? Is it a partnership or a corporation? Mr. DILLON. It is a joint-stock association under the laws of New York, and Mr. PECORA (interposing). Has that firm Mr. DILLON (continuing). Excuse me. Mr. PECORA. GO right ahead. Mr. DILLON. The joint stock association started October 11, 1922. We were a copartnership until 1922. Mr. PECORA. In 1922 it was organized under the laws of the State of New York as a joint stock association, a corporation, was it? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. And who are the stockholders or members of this joint stock company known as Dillon, Eead & Co. Mr. DILLON. I think we have a list. Mr. PECORA. All right, if you wish to refer to it. Mr. DILLON. I am the president. The following men are vice presidents: W. M. L. Fiske, Eoland L. Taylor, Win. A. Phillips, James V. Forrestal, Ealph H. Bollard, Dean Mathey, Wm. S. Charnley, Eobert O. Hayward, Henry G. Eiter, 3rd, and Harry H. Egly. Mr. Eobert E. Christie, Jr., is secretary and treasurer. Mr. PECORA. Are those gentlemen all the holders of stock of this joint stock company? Mr. DILLON. I do not think all of them own stock. I can give you that list of stockholders if you wish. Mr. PECORA. If you please. STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1537 Senator COUZENS.- Mr. Pecora, ask him the percentage that they own. Mr. PECORA. Senator Couzens suggests that you also state the percentage or proportions of stock of this joint stock corporation owned by each of the stockholders. Mr. DILLON. The stockholders are Clarence Dillon, Abbott Trading Corporation, The Beekman Co., Ltd., E. J. Bermingham, Isabelle Bollard, E. H. Bollard, W. M. S. Charnley, W. M. L. Fiske, W. M. A. Phillips, Eoland L. Taylor. What was your question, Senator Couzens ? Senator COUZENS. The percentage of stock which each holds in that corporation. Mr. DILLON. Of stock? Senator COUZENS. Yes. Mr. DILLON. I have no objection to giving any information to this committee that you feel will be helpful to you. But I am wondering if a statement of the interests of the various members is something you want me to tell publicly. If you feel it is going to help you in your deliberations, that it be given publicly, I have no objection to doing so; but I would appreciate it if you would consider whether that is pertinent. Senator COUZENS. SO far as I am concerned, if I know who controls the corporation I am satsified, speaking personally. Mr. PECORA. I think similar consideration was requested by members of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. and that the committee at that time accorded them that consideration, by not including in the public record, or the record of the public hearings the apportionment of interest among the various partners that composed the banking firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. The information was given to the committee as I recall it, however, in executive session. Senator COUZENS. But we did get who controlled the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. Mr. PECORA. Yes; insofar as that would be indicated by Senator COUZENS (interposing). And we put in the record that Mr. Morgan controlled absolutely the organization. I am asking for the same information as to Dillon, Eead & Co. Mr. PECORA. Well, perhaps Senator COUZENS (continuing). And wasn't it put in the record in detail later on ? I mean as to the holdings of J. P. Morgan. Mr. PECORA. It was given to us in executive session, but not put in the record. I mean as to their respective apportionments of interest. Senator GOLDSBOROUGH. It got to the public just the same, as I recall. Mr. PECORA. Well, perhaps Mr. Morgan gave an interview. Senator GOLDSBOROUGH. I did not mean to intimate that. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, who is the principal stockholder of Dillon, Eead & Co.? Mr. DILLON. Mr. Pecora, if Senator Couzens and his associates feel that that information is going to be helpful if given publicly, I have no objection to giving it. But, naturally, I prefer not to do so. 1538 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES The CHAIRMAN. If you have no objection to giving it I see no reason why it should not go in our record. Mr. DILLON. I have no objection, Mr. Chairman, to answering any questions whatsoever, and I have no objection at all to answering that question if you gentlemen decide it will help you in your deliberations. But, naturally, there are some things I prefer not to have in the public record. But I am prepared to answer anything you want. Mr. PECORA. I think, perhaps, if you would give the information Senator Couzens has indicated that he is especially desirous of having as going to the control of this joint-stock association, that would satisfy our immediate purpose. Senator COUZENS. That would satisfy me, Mr. Pecora. I am not attempting to speak for the other members of the subcommittee, but if he will give that information that will be sufficient for our purposes at this time. Mr. DILLON. I own the majority of the stock. Senator COUZENS HOW much stock is out? Mr. DILLON. HOW many shares? Senator COUZENS. Yes. Mr. DILLON. I haven^t the exact figures here. But there are between 73,000 and 74,000 shares. I haven't just the exact figures but can furnish them later. Senator COUZENS. That is sufficient. The CHAIRMAN. What is the par value of the stock? Mr. DILLON. $1 par value. Senator COUZENS. HOW many shares do you own, Mr. Dillon? Mr. DILLON. We haven't that figure here but we can \"get it for you. Senator COUZENS. All right. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, what is the business of Dillon, Read & Co.? Mr. DILLON. Dillon, Read & Co. in the investment banking business. Mr. PECORA. When you say \" investment banking business \", are you seeking to draw a distinction in the use of that term between the business of investment banking and the business, we would say, of a private banker ? Mr. DILLON. A private banker may be engaged in any banking business. I was distinguishing rather between investment banking and commercial banking. The field of investment banking as I am trying to make clear would have more to do with long-term investments as opposed to short-term credits, which would be the proper business, I feel, of commercial banking. I think the two fields are distinct in their functions. The commercial banker makes shortterm credits more or less in the nature of self-liquidating credits, because he makes them largely with depositors' money, and the depositors may want that money on demand. He would be financing what you might call \" consumable goods,\" things which by their nature would be consumed in a short time and the loan repaid. On the other hand, the investment banker has to do with the financing of credits which would not be immediately self-liquidating and short term but would be devoted rather to durable goods than to consumable goods. Mr. PECORA. Such as public improvements? STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1539 Mr. DILLON. Yes. For road construction, I should say; the building of factories; the building of bridges and tunnels, and expenditures that in themselves and by their nature are not consumed but, rather, produce other things, the revenues from which would in time liquidate such a loan. Senator ADAMS. The disregard of that distinction has caused a good deal of trouble in this country, hasn't it, Mr. Dillon ? Mr. DILLON. I think so. That is why I am trying to make it clear. I think those functions are distinct banking functions. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dillon, do you receive deposits? Mr. DILLON. I think, Senator Fletcher, we may have some small amounts on deposit with us, which are in the nature of sinkingfund moneys, or moneys for payment of coupons. But we do not solicit deposits simply to be held against checks. Mr. PECOEA. Are the deposits to which you refer deposits that are intrusted to your firm as fiscal agents for those making the deposits ? Mr. DILLON. Those deposits are largely in the nature of deposits to cover sinking fund and coupon payments. Mr. PECORA. They are not the kind of deposits that are payable on demand, and such as commercial banks carry ? Mr. DILLON. NO. We do not take those deposits. Mr. PECORA. YOU do not take deposits of that character ? Mr. DILLON. NO, sir. Senator COUZENS. May I ask Mr. Dillon at this time to distinguish between his house and the House of Morgan ? Mr. PECORA. I think it would be very enlightening if Mr. Dillon would undertake to do that for the subcommittee. Mr. DILLON. I would be very glad to describe the business of our firm, and Senator COUZENS (interposing). What I am trying to get at is this: You distinguish the nature of your business from that of the commercial banker. Now, J. P. Morgan & Co. are not commercial bankers, are they? Mr. DILLON. N O ; but Senator COUZENS (interposing). They are private bankers ? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Senator COUZENS. And an investment house, both? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Senator COUZENS. Can you think of anything in the operations of J. P. Morgan & Co. that is a distinguishing difference between your operations and theirs, if any? Senator ADAMS. Senator Couzens, might I interpose right there: You say J. P. Morgan & Co. are not commercial bankers? Is that correct? Senator COUZENS. Yes; in the sense that they are not incorporated as a commercial bank. Mr. PECORA. But that they do what might be .regarded as a commercial banking business or something akin to it. Senator COUZENS. Well, they are not under the law a commercial bank. I think we understand the different factors connected with a commercial bank and the house of Morgan. Mr. PECORA. I think Mr. Dillon will be glad to make that distinction clear. 1540 STOCK EXCHANGE PEACTICES Mr. DILLON. I will be glad to describe my own business. But I think you gentlemen of the committee are more familiar with the business of J. P. Morgan & Co. after your inquiry, probably, than I am. Senator COUZENS. Mr. Dillon, before you go into that let me make myself clear. I want to know the difference between a private bank and this business of yours. I understand that J. P. Morgan & Co. were described as a private bank. Mr. DILLON. Senator Couzens, I am not trying to fence with you at all. But I hesitate to attempt to go into a detailed description of the difference between my own business and some other business I may not be familiar with. I understand that J. P. Morgan & Co. do take deposits, which we do not. We do not take them because we have no use for them in our business. It would be money that we would have to pay back to some one on demand, and we have no useful employment for that money in the investment banking business as we conduct it. Senator ADAMS. Doesn't the confusion come in the use of the term \" banking \" in connection with your business ? Mr. DILLON. I think so. Senator ADAMS. Isn't there a misunderstanding when one applies the term \" banking \" to your busines ? Mr. DILLON. I think so That is why I call it dealing in investment securities. Senator GOLDSBOROUGH. And isn't it a fact that J. P. Morgan & Co. carry accounts subject to check, while you mean that your house does not do so ? Mr. DILLON. I understand that that is correct. We do not do so. There are none subject to check as I understand. Isn't that true? (Speaking to an associate.) I am told there may be two or three accounts against which checks may have been drawn during past years, but we do not make commercial loans, or issue letters of credit, or deal in foreign exchange, or anything of that kind. Our business is devoted to what I will describe to you if you like as the investment security business. And I shall be glad to enlarge upon that subject so that you may understand it if you wish. Senator COUZENS. Aren't there three kinds of banks ? As I understand, you describe yours as an investment banking business Mr. DILLON. Yes, sir. Senator COUZENS. And it is that kind of banking business which does not accept, in the general .sense of the word, deposits. Mr. DILLON. We do not. Senator COUZENS. Nor doe,s it honor checks. Mr. DILLON. N O ; we do not. Senator COUZENS. Then there is the private banker, like the Morgan house. And then there is the incorporated bank, either under a State or a i^ational charter. Isn't that so ? In other words, aren't there three kinds of banks in the general acceptance of the term \"bank\"? Mr. DILLON. I would say two kinds. There is the commercial bank, which I might say deals in short-term credits, and then there is the investment bank, which we may briefly call a dealer in long credits. I think tho(se are the distinct functions. Then you may STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1541 have a house, a private bank, that combines those two things. But I do not mean to describe it as a third function. Senator COUZENS. In fact it is, isn't it? Mr. DILLON. It is probably a combination of the other two. Senator COTJZENS. In other words, you have a charter from the State of New York? Mr. DILLON. We? Senator COTJZENS. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Senator COUZENS. Yes; I mean you. And J. P. Morgan & Co. does not as I understand it. Mr. DILLON. AS I understand it that is a partnership. Senator COUZENS. SO that is another distinction between the two methods of operation. In other words, Morgan & Co. do not have a limited liability, do they? Mr. DILLON. I do not think so, but I do not know. Mr. PECORA. N O ; as partners of course each partner is liable for all of the obligations of the entire copartnership. Senator COUZENS. And, Mr. Dillon, your company does have a limited liability. The stockholders do have a limited liability, don't they? Mr. DILLON. NO. Mr. PECORA. Senator Couzens, in the case of a joint stock company under the laws of the State of New York the stockholders are distinguished in that important respect. The stockholders have unlimited liability in the case of a joint stock association. Senator COUZENS. Then what are the advantages, may I ask Mr. Pecora, so I may have it clear, in having a joint-stock company if there is no limiting of liability. Mr. PECORA. AS I apprehend the principal advantage is that it carries with it all the features of a copartnership, plus the additional advantage, if it be considered an advantage, of a continuation of the interest of a deceased partner, in the case of his estate, through stock ownership. Senator COUZENS. That is the chief advantage? Mr. PECORA. That is what I consider the chief advantage- Mr. Dillon might speak for himself, but the withdrawal of a stockholder would not necessitate the reconstitution of the firm, such as would have to take place in the case of a copartnership. Mr. DILLON. I think your counsel, Senator Couzens, has stated it very clearly. Senator COUZENS. All right. Mr. PECORA. And Mr. Dillon is a good lawyer, too. Senator COUZENS. That is a self-compliment. Mr. Pecora says that Mr. Dillon is a good lawyer, too. [Laughter.] Mr. PECORA. Well, perhaps that remark was a little immodest, Senator Couzens. Senator COUZENS. All right. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, in your answer to one of the questions previously put to you, you stated that Dillon, Eead & Co. do not carry any deposit accounts, payable on demand. Has that always been the case? 1542 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Mr. DILLON. At times in the past, we have had substantial deposits that were subject to withdrawal. Mr. PECORA. And when did your firm—and I shall continue to refer to Dillon, Read & Co. as a firm for the sake of convenience rather than as a joint-stock corporation—when did your firm discontinue the practice of carrying deposit accounts payable on demand for the account of customers ? Mr. DILLON. That has been a gradual process. We take no new accounts, and we have been eliminating our old opes during the last 3 or 4 years. Mr. Pecora, at this point I should like to state that we do have another company, Dillon, Eead & Co., Inc., whkh is a Maryland corporation, of which I own all the common stock. There are some preferred stockholders. That was just formed last year, and is not a very active company. We also have the Dillon Eead Corporation, which is a Connecticut company, which conducts our European business. But the former concern that has to do with the period of your inquiry. Mr. PECORA. Then when you speak of Dillon, Eead & Co. it is understood that we have in mind this joint stock company organized under the laws of the State of New York. Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. And that has been in existence since some time in 1922. Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. All right. Now, Mr. Dillon, according to information that was furnished to us in answer to a questionnaire that we submitted to your firm, at one time, and I refer specifically to the end of the year 1927, your firm carried deposit accounts aggregating $5,250,907.9<3, which were subject to withdrawal on demand, those deposits being kept and maintained by various corporations doing business in interstate commerce. So you will see from that, that at one time, a few years ago, your firm did carry some deposit accounts for customers of a rather substantial amount. Would you tell this committee why in more recent times your firm has discontinued this practice of carrying deposit accounts for customers? Mr. DILLON. In 1927 such deposits were in excess of $5,000,000, as you have read. And there were 17 accounts. In 1928 there were seven accounts with a million and a quarter dollars, roughly. In 1929 there were seven accounts with $3,100,000. In 1930 there was one account with $123,000. And in 1931 there were no accounts of that nature. Mr. PECORA. And none in 1932? Mr. DILLON. NO ; nothing except that I am informed there were a few thousands of dollars someone left there. Mr. PECORA. Will you tell the committee for what reason your firm discontinued that portion of its business ? Mr. DILLON. That deposit business grew up with no particular solicitation on our part, just as a natural consequence of our business. After 1927 we discouraged that business, because those funds were of no use to us. There was simply the responsibility of holding them. We do not make commercial credits. We do not do foreign exchange or issue letters of credit. We had no use for depositors' money in our business. That was simply a responsibility, the keep STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1543 ing of it, keeping it always liquid and ready to be paid out on demand. It served no useful purpose for us, and as time went on we became more and more convinced that we did not want demand deposits. As we went through such years as we have gone through recently, we adopted the policy of carrying against deposits only cash and short-time governments, so they were of no value to us. Therefore we have gradually discouraged that business, until today we won't accept it. We do not want it.. We feel that it is an entirely distinct business from our security business. Mr. PECORA. NOW, Mr. Dillon, can you give the committee in a general statement the principal features of the business conducted by your firm? Mr. DILLON. We are not versed in the commercial banking business as such, and we do not want those deposits, because we are not commercial bankers ourselves. We are in the investment business. The nature of our business is the financing as I said before, of the durable industries of this,country; and you might be interested in a rough picture of just what the relation of that sort of financing is to commercial financing and short credits. I think I have some figures here which will show that. There was a report prepared by A. B. Tebbutt, of the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration, and that material indicates that in this country there was probably produced and distributed as great a volume of consumption goods—that is, the sort of thing that you ordinarily buy in stores—in the depression years of 1930, 1931, and 1932, as in the prosperous years of 1927, 1928, and 1929. The Federal Eeserve Board index of industrial production shows that the consumption of such consumable goods declined about 15 percent in value from July 1929 to July 1933, which more or less corroborates that, while the production of durable goods, which are the goods that we would be financing, declined about 65 percent in value from July 1929 to July 1933. These figures are all compiled, I might say, by Leonard P. Ayres, who is a well-known economist. The census report of manufactures for 1929 will show that the production of industries which the Federal Eeserve called durable was equal to about $30,000,000,000, while the production of industries which the Federal Eeserve would call consumable was equal to about $30,000,000,000. In other words, the business of the country is about equally divided between the sort of business which would be financed, probably, by commercial credits, and the business which would be financed by the investment banker, with the longer term credit. Senator ADAMS. I S that even distribution prior to 1929 or subsequent to 1929? Mr. DILLON. These are the 1929 figures. I have something here which will help you in connection with subsequent figures. I just read the percentages. You may not have heard Senator ADAMS. I heard the percentages. Mr. DILLON. The decline since 1929 has been 15 percent in consumable goods, and 65 percent in what we call durable goods. The census report of manufactures shows that in 1929 there were employed in durable goods industries about 10,100,000, and in consumption goods industries about 3,900,000. By applying to these figures the Federal Eeserve index of employment we can get an estimate of 1544 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES the present employment in these two groups of industries. This estimate shows that in June 1933 those employed in the durable goods industries were about 4,400,000, or a decrease of 5,700,000, ^whereas in the consumption goods industries the employment was 15,100,000, or a decrease of about 800,000. This shows that approximately 7 men out of 8 unemployed today belong to the durable goods industries. Those figures may not be exact, but they will give you a picture, I think, according to Mr. Ayres, of the field and the function of the investment banker. Today you have the business that is financed by the commercial banks, in connection with consumable goods, functioning reasonably well. The industries that would be financed by the investment banker are functioning at only a fraction of their normal production. Senator COUZENS. May I ask a question at that point? Mr. DILLON. Yes, sir. Senator COUZENS. When you speak of enterprises financed by security bankers, do you make any division between those that you finance from the ground up, new institutions, and those, that you just buy out and sell the stock of? Mr. DILLON. I do not know whether that would be included. I would assume not, because those figures are made up from the census of manufactures. I did not prepare those figures. Mr. Ayres prepared them, but I should think they would not include recapitalization, if that is what you mean. Senator COUZENS. If you are going to submit figures, I wanted to know the difference between the figures representing the amount of money that was floating through these security ventures for refinancing institutions like the Dodge Brothers, and those which they might float for an entirely new industry. In other words, a mere change of ownership between one group and another is of no importance, except to the fellow who gets stung, or the fellow who profits, whichever the case might be. The investment banker, as you have described him, as I understood it, means a banker who floats a new company, a new enterprise, and does something constructive, rather than a mere change of ownership. I wondered if you had any figures in connection with those two groups. Mr. DILLON. I agree with what you say. Senator, to this extent. I t does not necessarily have to be a new industry. The financing of an existing industry, in order that it may expand or develop, is equally as constructive as the financing of a new industry. Senator COUZENS. Yes; but when you finance such an industry as you have just described, it is assumed that they add capital goods. Mr. DILLON. Yes, sir. Senator COUZENS. YOU do not finance them simply to increase their consumptive goods, but rather to increase their facilities of a capital nature. That is as I understand your description. Mr. DILLON. I think that is correct. Senator COUZENS. Then, what did the public gain, or what did the industry gain by the mere exchanging of ownership of the Dodge plant from one group to another? Mr. DILLON. They gained this, as I see it, Senator Couzens. I think that when a great industry in this country, owned by one man, or by one family, reaches the proportions which some industries have STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1545 reached it is probably better for the general community if that industry is owned by the public rather than being owned by one man or one family, because too great a responsibility attaches to a very small control. Mr. PECORA. DO you think that might be attended with unhappy social consequences? Mr. DILLON. I t might be, Mr. Pecora, and, again, if that industry needs additional capital for its expansion and development, it is much easier to get that capital when the ownership is a public ownership. It is on a much sounder basis. I should think, from the social point of view, the labor employed in that industry is on a sounder basis if that great industry is owned by the public rather than by one family. Does that answer your question, Senator Couzens? Senator COUZENS. That is very illuminating, but I wonder how you would put the price that you pay for that into figures. Into what classification would you put those figures—in the classification of capital investment in a constructive enterprise, or what ? Mr. DILLON. I should think those figures would not be in either of these classifications. The CHAIRMAN. IS it not true, Mr. Dillon, that what you call ownership by the public is rather a myth, and that the actual, real ownership continues in the hands of a few just the same? Mr. DILLON. NO, Senator. The ownership goes with the stock, and the stock is owned by the public. The CHAIRMAN. I understand; but there is a certain controlling interest in the stock that manages the industry just the same, even though a great deal of the stock is owned by the public. Mr. DILLON. I think the general practice is that the stockholders send their proxies in, probably to a small group of people. Mr. PECORA. Does not that practice really lead to control of the industry, which is owned by a large body of stockholders, by a few persons who receive the proxies and who exercise the actual management and operation of the corporation ? Mr. DILLON. That is with the consent and approval of the stockholders. They send in their proxies to that group to vote their stock. Mr. PECORA. I know that is the legal machinery by which the exercise of that control is manifested. What I would like to ask you is, if it is not your knowledge and experience that the control of a large corporation, whose stock is widely held among the public, is very, very frequently vested in a few men, or a small group composed of a few individuals, whose actual combined stock ownership might represent a very small minority of the stock. Mr. DILLON. I think, as long as the management runs a company to the satisfaction of its stockholders, the practice is that the stockholders leave the management of that company in the hands of those men. Mr. PECORA. DO we not have Mr. DILLON. The stockholders always have the potential control, and the power to remove the management if the company is not run to their satisfaction. Mr. PECORA. We know the naked legal power that ownership of stock conveys or gives to the owners of the stock. But, as a matter 1546 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES of actual practice in operation, have you not found, in your experience in the financial world, so to speak, that large corporations whose stock is very widely held among the public, are, in a majority of instances, probably, controlled and managed by a small group of individuals whose total stock ownership might comprise a very small minority of the actual outstanding stock? Mr. DILLON. The management of a company, the men actively running the company, are generally, as you say, supported by the stockholders, by the sending in of proxies, and they leave the control of the company to that active management as long as that management is running it successfully. I think it is the exception where a group of stockholders get together to dislodge an existing management, if I understand you correctly. Mr. PECORA. Yes. That is one of the features I have in mind. Mr. DILLON. That is unusual, and would only happen, I should think, when the management was mismanaging the property. Mr. PECORA. Or when something happened which aroused and unified the public, or that portion of the public that owned most of the outstanding stock, and caused them to take defensive measures. Mr. DILLON. I did not follow that. Mr. PECORA. The reporter will read it. (The reporter read the pending question.) Mr. DILLON. Was that a question? I did not follow it. Mr. PECORA. I t is a sort of observation embodied in the form of a question. I t was designed to elicit your opinion and judgment upon it. Mr. DILLON. That stockholders as a rule do not dislodge a management unless they are aroused, either by public opinion or by mismanagement of the property? Mr. PECORA. Yes. Let me give you a concrete case that came to the notice of this committee in the course of hearings held by it last May or June. One of the witnesses, a Mr. Van Sweringen, testified that he and his associaties sought to buy, and succeeded in buying, 15 percent of the outstanding stock of a certain railroad corporation, because Mr. Van Sweringen and his associates engaged in that transaction felt that they could get a management control of that railroad company through the ownership of this block of 15 percent of its outstanding common stock. Those instances of management control going with the ownership of a block not exceeding 15 percent of the outstanding stock of a corporation are not rare and infrequent, are they ? Mr. DILLON. AS I understand your question, the control of corporations is often exercised; that is, the working, nominal control Mr. PECORA. The management control. Mr. DILLON. The management control—by blocks of stock less than the majority of the stock. Mr. PECORA. Far less than the majority. Mr. DILLON. I think that is correct. Senator ADAMS. Mr. Dillon, would it not be almost an impossibility for a small stockholder to raise a successful insurrection in great companies like the Steel Corporation, the A. T. & T., or the Pennsylvania, so as to have a change in management, even though there was dissatisfaction among the small stockholders ? You would not want to undertake that kind of a revolt, would you ? STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1547 Mr. DILLON. I should not like particularly the job of lining up the small stockholders to try to oust the management of any of the bigger corporations. Senator ADAMS. YOU are confronted with this, are you not, in the first instance, that the outside stockholder does not know who the other stockholders are? You are combatting those in the citadel, as it were, who have the list of stockholders. Mr. DILLON. I think the lists of stockholders are available. Senator ADAMS. Usually after bringing court proceedings to compel them to exhibit them. You remember we went through that in the American Smelting & Refining Co. That was one of the last revolts sought to be staged. Mr. Eilers and others sought to stage a revolt against the Guggenheims. Mr. DILLON. I was under the impression that you could get a list of the stockholders by requesting it. Mr. PECORA. It all depends upon the provisions of the law in the several States, and sometimes it all depends on the personality of the court. Senator ADAMS. But, as a practical matter, it is tremendously difficult in the case of a large, wide-spread corporation. Mr. DILLON. I should think it would be difficult to cover the great number of stockholders. Senator ADAMS. There are 1,000,000 stockholders in one or two of these corporations, are there not ? I have seen some of the statistics. It seems to me that the A.T.&T. list of stockholders runs up to 1,000,000 stockholders, does it not, Senator Couzens ? Mr. DILLON. It seems to me I have seen somewhere that it has about 700,000 stockholders. Senator ADAMS. I know it is an enormous number. Mr. PECORA. Where the stock of a corporation is widely held, that is, held by a body of several hundred thousand stockholders, the general body of the stockholders is disorganized, or rather unorganized, whereas the group having as much as 15 per cent of the outstanding stock is a cohesive, united body, which usually has its hands on the levers of control of the machinery of the corporation. Are these not factors that make it extremely difficult, even in the case of wide-spread dissatisfaction with the management of a corporation, for the unorganized stockholders to oust a small minority that may be in control ? Mr. DILLON. I should think that unless the criticism of the management was something very substantial, the minority stockholders would have a difficult job organizing to oust an existing management. Mr. PECORA. YOU mean the majority stockholders? Mr. DILLON. NO ; the general public. I should think it would be a difficult task to organize them unless there was something very seriously wrong with the management, because I think investors buying stock, as a rule, buy it because they are satisfied with the management. Mr. PECORA. Very often because they know nothing about the management. Mr. DILLON. That is also true. Senator COUZENS. If they did they would not buy it. May I inject a question at this point? If this does not disclose any trade 175541—33—PT 4 2 1548 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES secrets, would you tell us how you go about bidding in a big corporation, to fix the purchase price ? To go back to some of these big corporations which you have purchased and refinanced, how do you go about it to compute the value? Mr. PECORA. Perhaps the Senator has in mind the Dodge Motor •Co. Senator COUZENS. Yes. I am just speaking from press reports. I understand that there was some competition in my home town as to who should get that company, and you were the successful bidder for it. I was wondering how you went about finding out how much you could afford to pay for that institution. Mr. DILLON. That would be a very long story, because it requires Senator COUZENS. I mean the principles involved, if there are any principles. Mr. DILLON. The chief principle involved would be the earning power I think, largely. Senator COUZENS, The earning power would determine how much you could afford to pay? Mr. DILLON. Yes; very largely. Senator ADAMS. Some of them are worth nothing now, then. Senator COUZENS. We went through a great deal of consideration of the excess-profits tax, and we always had difficulty in fixing the ratio on which we collected the excess-profits tax—whether it was 8 to 1, or 10 to 1, or 10 times the earning power, or 6 times the earning power, or 4 times the earning power. What percentage would you use when you go to fix the purchase price of a corporation such as that? Mr. DILLON. We would consider their past record of earnings and their present record of earnings, and our estimate of their future earnings. On a combination of that picture, we would fix a price that we thought was fair. Senator COUZENS. Then you do not use any percentage, as we use in the Government when we come to arrive at the excess-profits tax. Mr. DILLON. A fixed percentage, you mean? Senator COUZENS. Yes. Mr. DILLON. NO. Senator COUZENS. SO, you could not give me1 a \" tip \" on how to value a corporation which I wanted to buy. Senator ADAMS. Or sell. Senator COUZENS. Or sell. Mr. DILLON. That would depend, Senator, very much on the conditions that existed in the world at that time. Senator ADAMS. The financial appetite of the public at the time, I think, would have something to do with it. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dillon, what was the purpose of forming these two corporations, one in Maryland and one in Connecticut, of very much the same name as yours ? Mr. DILLON. The Connecticut corporation, Senator Fletcher, was to control our business in Europe. That was the reason for its formation. The CHAIRMAN. I t is really a part of your parent organization, but a branch, as it were, or a department of Dillon, Read & Co. ? Mr. DILLON. Yes; you might so call it. STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1549 Mr. PECORA. It was a separate legal entity, but composed of the same individuals, virtually, is that correct? Mr. DILLON. Virtually. The CHAIRMAN. And the same as to Maryland. What was the object in forming the Maryland corporation? Mr. DILLON. The Maryland corporation was formed this last year. Its exact uses are still to be demonstrated. Senator ADAMS. In your Maryland company you own all the stock. Is that true of the Connecticut company ? Mr. DILLON. NO. The Connecticut company is owned similarly to the association. Senator ADAMS. It belongs to the association ? Mr. DILLON. In the Maryland company I own all the common stock. My associates in the business have arrangements by which they participate in the profits, if there are any. Senator ADAMS. YOU might sell them some of the stock. Mr. DILLON. I do not sell stock, as a rule, in the companies in which I am active. Senator ADAMS. YOU would to your partners. Mr. DILLON. I think they would be satisfied to let me keep it. Mr. PECORA. DO any of the stockholders of Dillon, Head & Co., the joint-stock company that has been referred to, sit as members of the board of directors of any commercial banks ? Mr. DILLON. None of the members of Dillon, Head & Co.—I believe I am correct in stating that none of them sit on the boards of any member banks. Mr. PECORA. When you say \" member banks\" what are you referring to ? Mr. DILLON. Members of the Federal Reserve System. Mr. PECORA. I mean any commercial banks, whether members of the Federal Eeserve System or not. Mr. DILLON. Mr. Christie is on the board of a country bank in Hartsdale, the town where he lives outside New York, a small bank in that suburban town; and Mr. Mathey is on the board of a similar bank in Princeton, N.J., a small bank in the town where he lives. He is also on the board of the Empire Trust in New York. Aside from that, none of the members of Dillon, Read & Co. sit on the boards of any banks. Mr. PECORA. YOU are speaking of conditions as of the present time? Mr. DILLON. AS of the present time. Mr. PECORA. In recent years, have any of the members of Dillon, Read & Co.—and when I say \" members \" I mean its partners—sat on the boards of any commercial banks other than those you have just mentioned? Mr. DILLON. I, for a number of years, have been on the board of directors and executive committee of the Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.; also on the board and executive committee of the Chase National Bank. Mr. Phillips has been a member of the board and executive committee, I believe, of the Chemical Bank. I do not recall at the moment any others. One moment and I will see. [After conferring with an associate.] I think that is all. Senator COUZENS. Are you still on these boards? 1550 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Mr. DILLON. NO, Senator Couzens. When the banking bill passed, requiring private bankers to resign from those boards, I resigned at once rather than wait for the expiration of the time limit. Senator COUZENS. What date was that? Mr. DILLON. What date was the bill passed ? Senator COUZENS. NO ; the date you resigned. Mr. DILLON. I do not know. If you would like those dates, I can get them. It was soon after the bill became law. Mr. PECORA. Soon after the so-called \" Glass-Steagall banking bill \" became law ? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. That was passed in 1933. Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. I understand the law became effective June Mr. DILLON. It was subsequent to that that I resigned 16. from the Central Hanover. I am not sure of the date as to the Chase. Mr. PECORA. Did you find, while you were a member of the board of these two banks to which you have referred, namely, the Chase National Bank and the Central Hanover National Bank & Trust Co.,. that it was any advantage to the business of your firm for you to be on the boards of those commercial banks, or did you find it to be a disadvantage, or what did you find to be the effect upon your business,, if any? Mr. DILLON. We served on those boards at the invitation of those companies, and I assume they asked us because they thought it would help their business. As far as our business goes, we find it no advantage to us to sit on those boards. Mr. PECORA. Considered from the broad standpoint of public policy, Mr. Dillon, would you care to give this committee your opinion or judgment as to the advisability of private bankers or investment bankers, while actively conducting such a business, sitting on the boards of commercial banks? Mr. DILLON. From our own point of view, we do not like to sit on any boards. We are busy enough running our own business, and we try to serve on as few boards as we can. Since the passage of the Glass-Steagall bill, I think it is called—the banking bill—we were glad enough of the opportunity of relieving ourselves of the responsibility of serving on bank boards. We serve on very few industrial boards for the same reason. We feel that it takes all our time to run our own business. Mr. PECORA. Have members of your firm in the past sat on the boards of industrial or general business corporations ? Mr. DILLON. TO a limited extent they may have (after conferring with an associate). Only to a limited extent. Mr. PECORA. DO any of them sit on any such boards at the present time? Mr. DILLON (after conferring with an associate). Some of them do, yes; a few. Mr. PECORA. Are any of those boards the boards of companies whose securities your firm has underwritten or issued or sold? Mr. DILLON. Yes; some of them are. Mr. PECORA. What would you say to this committee as your judgment or opinion concerning the advisability from the standpoint of STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1551 public policy and general public welfare, of investment bankers, such as your house is, sitting on the boards of industrial corporations or business corporations with whose securities they have been identified ? Mr. DILLON. Would you read the question please? (The reporter read the pending question.) Mr. DILLON. From our point of view as investment bankers, we liave not felt it necessary to sit on boards for the purpose of protecting or looking after the securities which we have issued. We have iound, either from contractual obligations with those companies, or from our association with them, or both, that we are able to get all the information that we require about their operations to properly follow their business, and it has been our experience that we were often in a better position to criticize the management or policy if we were not members of the board, than if we were. Senator COUZENS. May we have at this point the names of some of the industrial corporations on whose boards you have been represented ? Mr. DILLON. Personally I am on no industrial boards. Senator CouzEisrs. In the last 3 or 4 or 5 years, on the boards of what industrial companies has your firm been represented ? Mr. DILLON. I can give you that list. Mr. PEOORA. Senator Couzens, one of the questions we submitted t o Mr. Dillon's firm in our questionnaire calls for the specific information that you now ask for, and at the proper time I propose to put their return to that question in our questionnaire in evidence. I will do it now if it will serve your immediate purpose. Senator COUZENS. AS long as it is coming out, I have no interest in when it comes out. It seems to me appropriate at this time, as long as you are determining the policy, or what Mr. Dillon thinks should be the public policy. I think it would be of interest to the committee to know, at this particular time, what corporations they probably influenced or dictated to by virtue of their representation on the boards. Mr. PECORA. I will read to the witness from the information furnished by his, firm, in answer to our questionnaire, the names of these corporations. The question was known as \" Question No. 3 \" in our questionnaire, and called for the names of all corporations in which any partner or representative of the firm of Dillon, Bead & Co., or any of its agencies, is a director or officer. The answer listed the following corporations: Amerada Corporation; Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation; Brazilian Tractipn, Light & Power Co., Ltd.; Broadway Department Store, Inc.; Commercial Investment Trust Corporation; Consolidated Cigar Corporation; Educational Pictures, Inc.; Empire Safe Deposit Co.; Equitable Office Building Corporation; Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.; Louisiana Geophysical Exploration Co.; Louisiana Land & Exploration Co.; Loew's, Incorporated; Nederlandsche Crediet en Financiering Maatschappij; Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.; St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co.; A. G. Spalding & Bros.; Tubize Chattilon Corporation; United New Jersey Railroad & Canal Co.; United States & Foreign Securities Corporation; United States & International Securities Corporation; Union Oil Co. of California; Victor Chemical Works; Warner Co. 1552 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Do you recall any others, Mr. Dillon ? Mr. DILLON. NO ; I do not. Mr. PECORA. Does that, Senator Couzens, answer your question for immediate purposes ? Senator COUZENS. I think it does, because it will enlighten the committee when Mr. Dillon gives his answer as to what relations might be brought about by these corporations themselves through interlocking directors. Mr. PECORA. I think it might be timely, in view of this questioning, for me to offer in evidence at this time the answer made by5 Dillon, Eead & Co. to question 3 in our so-called \" questionnaire. ' So for that purpose I will show Mr. Dillon this typewritten document. Will you kindly look at it and tell us if you can identify it as the answer to question no. 3 of our questionnaire addressed to your firm ? Mr. DILLON. Mr. Pecora, do you want us to take the time to compare that? That is not the copy that we sent in to you. It is a transcript that your office made. We assume it is a correct one, if you would like that. Yes, Mr. Pecora; if there is any error in your transcript, we can correct it later. Mr. PECORA. YOU are assuming it is a correct copy ? Mr. DILLON. Yes, sir. You have it there. Mr. PECORA. Then, subject to correction, I offer it in evidence. The CHAIRMAN. Let it be admitted into evidence. (Dillon, Eead answer to question 3 was thereupon designated \" Committee Exhibit No. 1 \" and is in the words and figures following:) COMMITTEE EXHIBIT NO. 1, OCTOBEB 3, 1933 Question.

Mr. PECORA. NOW, Mr. Dillon, in the answer you made to the question just put to you a moment or two ago you indicated an opinion that as I recall was somewhat in conflict with the opinion expressed in answer to a similar question by a previous witness before this committee, a member of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co.? who stated in his testimony that it was considered by them advisable and of importance for a member of that firm to sit on the board of a corporation whose securities it had handled, issued. Mr. DILLON. That would be a question of personal judgment or policy. I would not want to take issue with their opinion. They may have found that desirable. It may be it is desirable. In our experience we do not feel as strongfy. Mr. PECORA. Among the corporations mentioned in your answer to question 3 of our questionnaire is one called the United States and Foreign Securities Corporation. Are you familiar with that corporation ? Mr. DILLON. Yes, I am, sir. Mr. PECORA. IS that corporation a so-called \" investment trust\" ? Mr. DILLON. It is. Mr. PECORA. And what are the distinguishing features of invest- ment trusts? Mr. DILLON. I have here a statement describing investment trusts. It would take me probably 2 or 3 minutes to read it. If you would like to have it, I would be glad to do it. Mr. PECORA. I tell you what we will do in order to save time: You have a typewritten statement defining investment trusts? Mr. DILLON. The story of investment trusts and of this particular one's organization. You might just put it in the record without reading it. Mr. PECORA. I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, to save time, we receive that in evidence and then let the witness explain in his own way, if he will, the principal features of an investment trust as distinguished from other kinds of investment corporations. Mr. DILLON. May we give you a clean copy of this after lunch? Mr. PECORA. Yes. The CHAIRMAN. Let the copy be entered in the testimony and you can proceed with any statement about it you care to make. (The statement submitted by Mr. Dillon was marked \" Committee Exhibit 1A October 3,1933 \", see p. 1606.) Mr. PECORA. NOW, please indicate to the committee in your own language, Mr. Dillon, the distinguishing features of an investment trust. Mr. DILLON. I shall, and the reasons why we formed this one. If you will go over the business we have done you will see that from 1919 down to today, we will say, the amount of business we did was varied. The industrial business that we financed amounted to 28.78 percent roughly of our total. Public-utility business was 20.52 percent, steam railroads 6.18, investment companies 2.29, real estate 1.50, 1554 STOCK EXCHANGE PEACTICES Canadian securities 17.25, municipals 1.45, European securities 14.26, S,outh American securities 6.58, other foreign loans 1.19. We had for some time considered the British and Scotch practice of investment trusts. They were first formed in England about 1860, to give the investor a chance to make a diversified investment. They have had a rather satisfactory, in fact popular, record in England, until today the British investment trusts I think have a total invested capital probably close to the equivalent of a thousand million dollars. It is one of the popular and accepted forms of investment. In this country we first considered forming an investment trust that would allow the investor to have a diversified investment in bonds and other things of the nature that we ourselves were bringing <out. But under the tax laws that existed here you could not form an investment to buy bonds, because the company itself would be taxed on its income from that interest, and then when it went to the investor in dividends the penalty was too great. I should like to see that changed if it could be, because I believe it is to the advantage of the small investor to be allowed to buy shares in an investment trust that bought bonds. So then we turned to consider an investment trust that would buy stocks. The thing that moved us most in this consideration was the fact that the small investor cannot get diversification. He can buy a few shares of this or that, but he takes the risk in that one company, whereas if he bought stock in an investment trust he would get a diversification. I think the investments in this particular company that you are speaking of, United States and Foreign, must number (after conferring with associate)—I haven't the number here,'but there is a great variety of items, and the investor's risk is spread over a large field. That was the particular advantage in forming it. The function of it was to invest this large sum of money at the minimum of expense, because the expenses of administration would be spread over a large fund, and to give the investor the advantage, of a management, if I may say so with due modesty, persons skilled in that particular line, and also to diversify his risk. In addition to this, we went further and decided that we ourselves would put in money junior to the public's money as an additional protection. In fact, in forming this trust we gave the public 6 percent stock with a real doubt in our minds as to whether over a period of time we could conveniently earn 6 percent on a diversified investment. Aside from the money we put in junior being an additional protection to that stock, it also would mean that an earning of 5 percent the total assets would have been enough to pay the public 6 percent. That company has been in operation now for about 8 years, I think it is, and we feel very successfully. Through these times, good and bad, we have paid the public on their preferred stock a total of 6 percent per annum. The capitalization of that company was 25 million preferred stock, 5 million second preferred. That company over the last 8 years has paid out in cash dividends over 13 millions of dollars, 11 million-odd to the first preferred and 2 million-odd to the second preferred. STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1555 Mr. PECORA. NOW, I think, Mr. Dillon, I will go into the matter of the organization of this investment trust and the issuance of its securities and their sale to the public through the medium of definite questions which I will ask you to answer. When was the United States and Foreign Securities Corporation organized ? Mr. DILLON. October 1924. Mr. PECOKA. And who caused it to be organized? Mr. DILLON. The figures that I have been giving in connection with this testimony are approximate. I would not want them to be considered exact. Mr. PECORA. I understand. Who caused the United States and Foreign Securities Corporation to be organized in 1924? Mr. DILLON. Dillon, Read & Co. Mr. PECORA. And what was the set-up of the corporation at its outset ? Mr. DILLON. The set-up of the corporation was arrived at in this fashion: There was 25,000,000 of first preferred stock that was to be offered to the public. We, ourselves, were putting in junior money for $5,000,000. Mr. PECORA. And for that so-called \" junior\" money what did you get? Mr. DILLON. In our original consideration of that set-up we were going to take common stock so that the public would get preferred stock and we common .stock. During those discussions we determined to give the public something more, in case the company should be prosperous beyond normal expectations, so that they would share beyond the 6 percent dividend on their preferred stock, and in order to do that we changed our set-up. Instead of taking common stock ourselves, we created a second preferred stock which we took for our $5,000,000. Mr. PECORA. What was the total amount of first preferred stock that was issued? Mr. DILLON. Twenty-five millions. Mr. PECORA. That was represented by 250,000 shares of no par value, was it not ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. And the 6 percent dividend-paying stock? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. With cumulative features? Mr. DILLON. Correct. Mr. PECORA. Was that $25,000,000, or rather the 250,000 shares of first preferred 6 percent dividend-paying cumulative first preferred stock, issued by your house to the public, sold to the public ? Mr. DILLON. It was. Mr. PECORA. For how much? Mr. DILLON. It was offered in the form of allotment certificates* The total amount payable on those was $25,000,000. Mr. PECORA. And what did these allotment certificates call for? Mr. DILLON. That is as I was explaining before. In order to give the first preferred something more than their 6 percent should the profits exceed normal expectations, we then took for ourselves^, 1556 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES instead of taking all the common stock for our $5,000,000, a second preferred stock and created a common stock of a million shares. Mr. PECORA. HOW many shares of second preferred stock were issued ? Mr. DILLON. Five million dollars' worth. That is 50,000 shares. Mr. PECORA. Having any par value? Mr. DILLON. A hundred dollars (after conferring with associate)—no; no par value. Mr. PECORA. Did the second preferred stock carry any dividend rate? Mr. DILLON. Six percent. Mr. PECORA. Also cumulative? Mr. DILLON. Yes; also cumulative, but it was subordinated to the first preferred. The first preferred received their 6 percent first, and then if there was anything further earned the second preferred would get their 6 percent. In liquidation the first preferred would get 100 percent plus accumulated dividends before the second preferred got anything. Then we took that common stock. Mr. PECORA. HOW many shares of common stock were provided for in the original set-up of this investment trust? Mr. DILLON. When we determined to give the first preferred stock some interest in the equity which they would not have had had we just bought $5,000,000 common for our junior money, as I say, then we took $5,000,000 second preferred stock and created a million shares of common stock of which a quarter was given to the first preferred stock. With each share of their first preferred stock went one share of common. The balance of that equity of a million shares, 750,000 shares, went to the purchasers of the* second preferred stock. Mr. PECORA. The purchasers of the second preferred stock were Dillon, Read & Co. ? Mr. DILLON. Yes. My statement there is literally correct, but, as a matter of fact, that second preferred stock and common was sold in two blocks. You will develop that probably as you go along. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Senator COUZENS. Did this Mr. DILLON. The preferred preferred stock have votes? stock did not have a vote when it was issued, because it did not occur to us at the time. We gave a share of common with each share of preferred, and the common voted. Later those certificates were broken up. At the time of listing on the New York Stock Exchange after that break-up we amended that provision and gave the vote to the first preferred stock in the event of default in the dividends. Mr. PECORA. Dillon, fiead & Co. were the organizers or creators of this investment trust? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. And they caused to be issued and sold to the general public 250,000 shares of first preferred stock carrying 6 percent cumulative dividends; is that right? Mr. DILLON. May I have that question again? (The shorthand reporter read the last question of Mr. Pecora.) Mr. DILLON. Well, it was issued and we did sell it; yes. STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1557 Mr. PECORA. And those 250,000 shares of the first preferred stock which had no $ar value were sold to the public for an aggregate of 25 million dollars; is that right? Mr. DILLON. The 250,000 shares of preferred and 250,000 shares of common were sold for 25 million dollars. Mr. PECORA. I was coming to that, only I was going to put it in this form: That the subscribers to the first preferred shares received an allotment certificate calling for one share of common stock with each share of first preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. Yes. The allotment certificate called for 1 share of preferred and 1 share of common. Mr. PECORA. That is the first preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. SO that these allotment certificates each calling for 1 share of first preferred and 1 share of common stock sold for $100 per certificate or at that rate ? Mr. DILLON. Calling for a total payment of that. Mr. PECORA. Yes, at that rate. Now, the common stock that was authorized to be issued by this investment trust by its organizers amount to 1,000,000, shares? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. That is the so-called equity stock, isn't it? The common stock is the so-called equity stock? Mr. DILLON. Well, that is the stock that would be entitled to anything beyond the 6 percent on the preferred and the 6 percent on the second preferred. Mr. PECORA. This investment trust also sold to the organizers, namely, Dillon, Read & Co., its 50,000 shares of second preferred 6 percent dividend cumulative stock? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. For $100 a share? Mr. DILLON. Wait; I am not sure that is correct. Mr. PECORA. That is, at that rate? Mr. DILLON. There is the equity stock—that is, the second preferred and the common. I speak of both as equity stocks. They are junior stocks rather. The 50,000 shares of second preferred were :sold to Dillion, Eead with Mr. PECORA (interposing). For a total of 5 million dollars ? Mr. DILLON. With 250,000 shares of common, for a total of 5 million. Mr. PECORA. I was coming to that. With that 50,000 shares of second preferred stock Dillion, Bead & Co. acquired 250,000 shares of the common stock, did not not? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. SO that with each share of second preferred 6 percent stock there went 5 shares of the common stock ? Mr. DILLON. YOU can put it that way, but in reality with the 50,000 shares of second preferred, that is, for the 5 million dollars went the whole 750,000 shares of common. The legal detail of the way that was issued you probably will develop. That 250,000 went with the 5 million dollars, and 500,000 went for $100,000. But the actual substance of it was that the men who subscribed the junior money—that is, the $5,100,000, received 750,000 shares of the common rstock. 1558 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Senator COUZENS. Then, in effect, that is complete control? Mr. DILLON. That is complete control. Senator COUZENS. In spite of the fact that they collected 25 million from the public ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Senator COUZENS. They controlled it for 5 million? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. They controlled it through the ownership of 75 percent of the common stock. Senator COUZENS. Yes. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. Which went with the second preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. They controlled it by the fact of putting up 5 million dollars junior money to the 25 million preferred stock. Mr. PECORA. The common £tock was the only stock that had voting power, wasn't it, at that time ? Mr. DILLON. I think that is correct. (After conferring with associate) : Yes, that is correct. Mr. PECORA. And subsequently, about 1931 or 1932 Mr. DILLON. Thirty, it was, I think, 1930. Mr. PECORA. The bylaws were amended so as to give the holders of the first preferred stock a voting power at the rate of one voter for each share of first preferred stock Mr. DILLON. In the event of default. Mr. PECORA. Which voting power, however, was only to be exercised in the case of any default ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. On the payment of dividends on the first preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Senator COUZENS. Why was that change in the bylaws made? What prompted it ? Mr. DILLON. I think I explained that to the Senator a moment ago. It was by a change in the charter and not the bylaws. Senator COUZENS. Why did you change the charter so as to give the first preferred the vote ? What prompted that ? Mr. DILLON. When we originally sold the allotment certificates under one share of common and one share of preferred went together the allotment certificate. The share of common had a vote. Later when the allotment certificate was fully paid, and it was divided,, the common had the vote, the preferred had no vote, and we then amended it so as that the preferred stockholders would have a vote in the event of default. Senator COUZENS. That was only because of what? I am sure I do not get your answer yet as to the reason for changing it. Mr. DILLON. That was the only reason, such as I have given ity the only reason that I can think of now. Mr. PECORA. YOU have indicated that in a practical sense Dillon, Read & Co. purchased the entire issue for $5,000,000 or 50,000 shares of second preferred stock, also received 750,000 shares of the common stock in connection with that purchase. Mr. DILLON. The group that put up that junior money of $5,000,000 for the second preferred and $100,000—$5,100,000 total—received the second preferred stock and 75 percent of the common stock. Some STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1559 of that second preferred went to the directors. When I say Dillon, Kead put it all up, there was a small amount that went to the directors. Mr. PECORA. The actual transaction by which Dillon, Bead & Co. purchased for the aggregate sum of $5,000,000 the entire issue of 50,000 shares of second preferred stock also enabled Dillon, Eead & Co. to get 250,000 shares of the common stock, did it not? Mr. DILLON. When you say Dillon, Eead bought it all, I would simply want to correct it. I think some of the directors bought some of that stock, but for the purpose of your discussion when you say Dillon, Eead sold, including Mr. PECORA (interposing). But the purchase was confined to various gentlemen who composed the firm or company of Dillon, Eead & Co.? Mr. DILLON. Plus, I think we will say, gentlemen who were on the board of directors. I think they bought some of it. Mr. PECORA. DILLON. Mr. PECORA. Mr. DILLON. Mr. PECORA. Mr. DILLON. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Yes. Didn't they? Yes. Some of the second preferred. I will bring out all those details. When I answered that, I just wanted to correct that. Wasn't there a subsequent transaction whereby the United States & Foreign Investment Corporation sold 500,000 shares of its common capital stock for the sum of $100,000 ? Mr. DILLON. NO, there was not. Mr. PECORA. There was not? Mr. DILLON. There was not. I think you will find that record shows that 500,000 shares was sold by Olcott later to me and my associates. Mr. PECORA. Well now, Olcott was a mere dummy, wasn't he, for Dillon, Eead & Co. in the transaction? Mr. DILLON. I don't know what you mean by \" dummy \". He is a bookkeeper in our office through which the legal machinery of this transaction was carried out. Mr. PECORA. SO that when you refer to the interposition of this Mr. Olcott in this transaction you are referring to a man who was a subordinate employee, namely, a bookkeeper, of Dillon, Eead & Co., who made the formal offer in writing to the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation to purchase from it for the sum of $100,000 five hundred thousand shares of its common capital stock? Mr. DILLON. NO, Mr. Pecora; that is not correct. Mr. PECORA. IS it not? Mr. DILLON. NO. He made no such offer to the Securities Co. Will it help you, Mr. Pecora, if I state exactly what happened there? Mr. PECORA. Well, you state it in your own way. Go ahead. Mr. DILLON. The Securities Co. sold its first preferred stock for $25,000,000, less $1,000,000 for expense of selling. They actually received $24,000,000. Then Olcott bought the second preferred and 750,000 shares of common for $5,100,000. And the result of that was that the corporation issued all of its capital stock and received $29,100,000. That is the substance of it. Senator GOLDSBOROUGH. $29,100,000? Mr. DILLON. Yes. 1560 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Mr. PECORA. Have you produced here in response to a subpoena' served upon your company a certain letter addressed to the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation under date of October 10r 1924, signed by one J. Perry Olcott? Mr. DILLON. Yes; we have. Mr. PECORA. Will you produce it, please ? Mr. DILLON. Certainly. Mr. PECORA. SO that I may offer it in evidence. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Will you use your copy, Mr. Pecora ? Ours is bound in a file. We do not have a loose copy. Mr. PECORA. Well, ours is similarly bound. Mr. DILLON. Ours is simply a photostat. I think you have a xnorer readable one. Senator COUZENS. Who has got the original? Mr. PECORA. They have the originals. Mr. DILLON. It is in the files. Mr. PECORA. But I have what purports to be a photostatic copy. Mr. DILLON. I will be glad to identify that, Mr. Pecora. Mr. PECORA. Mr. Dillon, I show you what purports to be a photostatic, copy of a letter dated New York, N.Y., October 10, 1924r addressed to \" United States & Foreign Securities Corporation, Baltimore, Md,\", signed by one J. Perry Olcott. Will you be good enough to look at this photostatic copy and tell us if you can identify it as being a true and correct copy of such a letter which was written by Mr. Olcott to the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation ?' Mr. DILLON. I will concede it to be true, subject to any corrections, sir. Senator COUZENS. If it is a photostatic copy, there cannot be any corrections. Mr. DILLON. NO, sir. Mr. PECORA. I may say that this photo,static copy was furnished to us by Dillon, Eead & Co. Mr. DILLON. Then it is correct. Mr. PECORA. It is correct? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. All right. I ask that that letter be received in evidence and spread upon the record. The CHAIRMAN. Let it be admitted and entered in the record. (Letter dated New York, N.Y., October 10, 1924, addressed to United States & Foreign Securities Corporation, Baltimore, Md., signed by J. Perry Olcott, was received in evidence and marked \" Committee Exhibit No. 2 of October 3, 1933.\") Mr. PECORA. Mr. Chairman, I will read this letter into the record, because it is important that we should have the text of it in our minds' as we go along. [Reading:] COMMITTEE EXHIBIT NO. 2, OCTOBER 3, 1933 NEW YORK, N.Y., October 10,1924. UNITED STATES & FOREIGN SECURITIES CORPORATION, Baltimore, Maryland. DEAR SIRS : I offer: 1. To cause Dillon, Read & Co., on or before October 21, 1924, to pay to your corporation the sum of $5,000,000 in cash, being an amount equivalent to $100 per share for every share of the authorized amount (50,000 shares) of your second preferred stock, on the condition that of such STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1561 amount $50,000 or $1 per share for such stock shall be fixed and accepted by you as the full consideration for the issuance of said second preferred stock and credited to the capital stock of the corporation, and that the remaining $4,950,000 of such amount shall be accepted by you as a contribution for, and set aside as, a general reserve, under the terms of your charter. 2.

(2) The issuance and delivery by your corporation, in accordance with the terms of said letter to Dillon, Read & Co., of first preferred stock allotment certificates in the form hereto attached, for the 250,000 shares of your first preferred stock and 250,000 shares of your common stock.

(7) The assumption by you of all liabilities incurred in the organization of your corporation, and your agreement to pay all out-of-pocket expenses incident to the issue of your stock and to the allotment certificates hereinbefore referred to. Upon your acceptance, the foregoing will constitute a contract between us. Very truly yours, J. PERRY OLOOTT. Accepted, October 10, 1924. UNITED STATES & FOREIGN SECURITIES CORPORATION, By ROBERT O. HAYWARD, Vice President. Mr. PECORA. NOW, Mr. Dillon, the Robert O. Hayward whose name is signed to this letter by way of acceptance of the terms and conditions of the proposal embodied in this letter, is one of the stockholders and associates of the joint-stock corporation called Dillon, Eead & Co., is he not? Mr. DILLON. He is one of the directors and officers; yes. Mr. PECORA. Yes. In other words, to put it colloquially, he is one of the partners of Dillon, Eead & Co. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. NOW you will notice from this agreement as expressed in this letter, and the acceptance thereof by the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation of its terms, that 250,000 shares of the first preferred stock authorized to be issued by this investment trust by its charter was to be sold to the public through Dillon, Read & Co. for $25,000,000, and that the purchasers of that first preferred stock were to get one share of common stock for each 1562 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES share of first preferred stock subscribed and paid for? That is correct, is it not? Mr. DILLON. Well, I do not recall that this letter says it will be sold through Dillon, Eead or that it will be sold for $25^000,000. Mr. PECORA. Well3 the fact of the matter is that this letter provides that $1,000,000 out of the proceeds of $25,000,000 for which these 250,000 shares of first preferred stock were to be sold was to be retained by Dillon, Eead & Co., presumably as a commission for its sale of the first preferred stock to the public ? Mr. DILLON. That presumption is correct; yes. Mr. PECORA. And I based my statement or my assumption of fact in my question to you with respect to that upon that provision of this agreement. Now that is not a violent assumption, is it? Mr. DILLON. But may I explain what happened here? Mr. PECORA. Well, is that not what happened ? Mr. DILLON. What? Mr. PECORA. I S that not exactly what happened, namely, that the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation accepted this proposal of J. Perry Olcott, who was a bookkeeper in the employ of Dillon, Kead & Co. at the time, to cause to be issued 250,000 shares of its first preferred stock to the public for $25,000,000, and that that stock was to be sold through Dillon, Eead & Co., and that Dillon, Eead & Co. were to receive $1,000,000 as its fee or commission for making such sale to the public? Mr. DILLON. Mr. Pecora, this letter does not say that they will be sold for $25,000,000. At least I do not find it. But it is stated, they tell me, in the allotment certificate, that $100 a share must be paid. Mr. PECORA. Yes; but the allotment certificate is attached to this letter and forms a part of the agreement embodied in this letter? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. SO that it is part of the agreement. Mr. DILLON. That is all right then. Mr. PECORA. Yes. I t is so understood, is it not, by you? Mr. DILLON. Well, I did not realize that it was attached to this letter. Mr. PECORA. Well, you see, Mr. Dillon, in assuming the facts that I have embodied in my question to you I am attempting to reduce to practical terms the provisions embodied in this contract between J. Perry Olcott and the United States & Foreign Investment Corporation with respect to the issuance and sale of the 250,000 shares of first preferred stock that the corporation was entitled to issue or authorized to issue under its charter. Now have I correctly stated the facts, stripping them of all legal verbiage ? Mr. DILLON. AS I look through this letter, Mr. Pecora, to me it is just a lot of legal phraseology and legal mechanics. What really happened was that the United States & Foreign sold its first preferred stock under this offer to Olcott Mr. PECORA. Offer by Olcott. Mr. DILLON. Offer by Olcott Senator COTTZENS. But now, at that point, was not Olcott really Dillon, Eead & Co.? Mr. DILLON (continuing).—or through some legal mechanics—he was a bookkeeper in our office. STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1563 Mr. PECORA. He was what is in the vernacular called a dummy for Dillon, Eead & Co. in this transaction? Mr. DILLON. NO. I do not really know why Dillon, Eead & Co. did not sign this offer. I mean that was a legal formality. I see no reason why it was done through a name like that. The substance of it was that this company was formed, received the $29,100,000, and issued against that $25,000,000 of preferred stock, $5,000,000 of second preferred stock, and a million, shares of common. Mr. PECORA. N O ; but let us get it down to its constituents' elements. Mr. DILLON. I will do that. I am not trying to quibble. I am trying to show what happened. The allotment certificates for 250,000 shares of first preferred stock and 250,000 shares of common—in this letter, as I read it, Mr. Olcott's offer to them was that if they would issue those allotment certificates first just calling for 250,000 shares of preferred stock; if they would then issue to Dillon, Kead 50,000 shares of the second preferred stock with 250,000 shares Of common, and then issue to him the balance of 750,000 shares of common, he agreed to provide out of that the 250,000 shares of common to go with the first preferred, and for all of that he would cause to be paid them $5,000,000 and $100,000, and provide for public subscribers for their allotment certificates $25,000,000, but $1,000,000 of that to be retained by Dillon, Eead & Co. Now that $1,000,000 was retained by Dillon, Eead & Co. to cover the cost of distributing that stock. Mr. PECORA. That is, the first preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. That is right. Dillon, Eead & Co. made no charge for organizing this company. That million dollars represented the four points on that $25,000,000, and that was allowed to dealers all over the United States. There were 380 dealers selling that stock, and any one that sold it got that four points for selling it. For what Dillon, Eead & Co. sold themselves they were paid the same as any other of the three hundred-odd dealers. And Dillon, Eead & Go's, own sales netted them three hundred thirty-nine thousand-odd dollars, as they retailed about ninety-four thousand-odd shares. Is that clear ? Mr. PECORA. NOW, Mr. Dillon, let us see if we cannot even digest this meal one bite at the time. Mr. DILLON. But do I not make that clear ? Is not that the picture you were asking for? Mr. PECORA. But I would rather take that step by step. Mr. DILLON. Step by step suits me. Mr. PECORA. NOW this corporation, this investment trust called the United States & Foreign Investment Corporation, was organized under the laws of the State of Maryland at the instance of Dillon, Eead & Co., was it not? Mr. DILLON. That is correct; yes. Mr. PECORA. Its charter authorized it to issue 250,000 shares of first preferred stock, having no par value, 50,000 shares of second preferred stbck having no par value, and 1,000,000 shares of common stock having no par value ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. 175541—33—PT 4 3 1564 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Mr. PECORA. That is correct. Now, on October 10, 1924, which was about the time of the incorporation and organization of the United States & Foreign Securities Corporation, one J. Perry Olcott submitted an offer in writing in the form of this letter that has been received in evidence here to that investment corporation, and the offer was accepted on the same date by the corporation, the signature of the corporation having been affixed by one Robert O. Hayward as its vice president. Is that correct ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. NOW, this J. Perry Olcott who made this offer was at that time not a capitalist or a person possessed of independent means, but a mere bookkeeper in the employ of Dillon, Read & Co. ? Mr. DILLON. Whether or not he was a man of means was of no importance, as he was simply a part of a legal step. Mr. PECORA. A legal scheme or method ? Mr. DILLON. Yes; method. Mr. PECORA. And the machinery so employed, which involved, among other things, the use of J. Perry Olcott for the purpose of making this offer, was designed to enable Dillon, Read & Co. to fix the terms upon which the securities of this investment trust which Dillon, Read & Co. has caused to be organized to be issued and disposed of, was it not ? Mr. DILLON. When Dillon, Read &> Co. decided on the capital set-up of this company, that was given to the lawyers, and then went on to carry it out. Now, I am not a lawyer, Mr. Pecora, and the detail of this use of Olcott or his letters or other letters is just a legal procedure to carry out the capitalization which resulted finally in the company receiving its full $29,100,000, for which it issued $25,000,000 of first preferred stock, $5,000,000 of second preferred stock, and the common stock. Mr. PECORA. But again I want to remark that that is a little bit too general a statement of the organization of this corporation and the issuance and sale of its securities. Mr. DILLON. I will try to help you. Mr. PECORA. YOU know, there' is an old hymn that says \" I do not ask to see the distant scene. One step's enough for me.\" Let us go one step at a time. Mr. DILLON. All right. But when you get into this legal procedure, frankly, I cannot be of much help to you. Senator ADAMS. I gather, Mr. Pecora, that Mr. Dillon does not think very much of the legal mechanics or phraseology. Mr. PECORA. That suggests a question, Senator Adams, that I will now ask Mr. Dillon. Mr. Dillon, whatever the legal steps and proceedings were that were employed in this matter, they succeeded in effectuating the objects and the purposes of the organizers of this investment trust? Mr. DILLON. I think that is correct. Mr. PECORA. All right. What were those purposes ? The CHAIRMAN. A, process by which Dillon, Read & Co. made a contract with Dillon, Read & Co. to do certain things ? To carry out certain things? Mr. DILLON. NO, Senator. Dillon, Read & Co. were causing to be formed an investment trust. The CHAIRMAN. Yes? STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1565 Mr. DILLON. Normally you just pay in your money and the company is formed. The lawyers go through these legal steps, whieh5 frankly, I do not understand. I see no reason to employ J. Perry Olcott. Senator ADAMS. I do not like a reflection to be made upon us lawyers, because that is the way we lawyers have to do. We have got to do these things to keep the set-up. Mr. DILLON. That is to make it seem strange. Senator ADAMS. And really, as a matter of fact, Mr. Dillon seems to feel that the lawyers are a sort of an impediment, if perhaps a necessary impediment. Some of us really think that we are very vital. As a matter of fact the lawyers are what make it possible for Mr. Dillon to do the things that he does. Senator COUZENS. Mr. Peroca admitted that Mr. Dillon was as good a lawyer as he was. Mr. PECOEA. I am afraid I was not paying Mr. Dillon a very high compliment. Senator Couzens, when I said it. Mr. DILLON. TO try to return an answer to your question, Mr, Pecora. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Mr. DILLON. The object which we wanted to accomplish, namely, the issuance of $25,000,000 of first preferred stock, of $5,000,000 of second preferred stock, and the issuance of a million shares of common stock, the company to receive for those $29,100,000, was accomplished by this procedure. Have I answered your question ? Mr. PECORA. I am now going to ask you a series of questions to bring out, step by step, this entire operation whereby the United States & Foreign Investment Corporation was launched on the financial waters. Dillon, Eead & Co. caused this investment trust to be organized in the first instance? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. Dillon, Read & Co. had one of its employees, a bookkeeper by the name of J. Perry Olcott, make a written offer in the form of this letter which has been received in evidence here to this investment trust? Mr. DILLON. Well, I do not know that Dillon-Read did that at all. The lawyers did that. Mr. PECORA. Well, the lawyers did it for the purpose of carrying out the purposes and objects of Dillon, Read & Co., did they not! Mr. DILLON. Yes. I mean they may have used Olcott or any man in their office. That is what I understand. Mr. PECORA. Who employed these lawyers to do this ? Mr. DILLON. Dillon, Read. Mr. PECORA. Who were the lawyers? Mr. DILLON. Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland. I think that is the name of the firm. Mr. PECORA. Yes. And you felt that they fully carried out their legal operations and purposes designed by the authors, namely, Dillon, Read & Co. ? Mr. DILLON. I trust the legal steps were all properly carried out. The result was what we wanted. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Mr. DILLON. The result is correct. 1566 STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES Mr. PECORA. NOW this employe of Dillon, Eead & Co. made this offer in writing to the Investment Trust? Mr. DILLON. That is right. Mr. PECORA. Immediately upon its incorporation and organization, did he not? Mr. DHXON. Well, I do not know when that happened. If that is true. Mr. PECORA. It was in October 1924. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. That offer was accepted by the corporation through its vice president, Mr, Hayward, one of the partners of Dillon, Eead &Co.? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. NOW, as a matter of fact, whose offer, or for whose benefit did Mr. Olcott make his offer to that investment trust ? Not • for his own benefit, did he ? Mr. DILLON. NO. I do not know. Dillon, Eead were the ones that were going to pay in the $5,000,000. Why the lawyers did not make the document with Dillon, Eead I do not know, Mr. Pecora. What these steps all mean or the object of them I do not know. It accomplished what we wanted in the end, which was that we paid in the $5,000,000 and received the $5,000,000 of second preferred. Mr. PECORA. NOW, if it accomplished what you wanted in the end, did it not accomplish the financing of this investment trust through the sale to the general public of 250,000 shares of first preferred stock, which carried with it 250,000 shares of the common stock, for a total consideration of $25,000,000, $1,000,000 of which went to Dillon, Eead & Co. as a fee or selling commission ? Mr. DILLON. NOW, that $1,000,000 went to Dillon, Eead & Co.; Dillon, Eead & Co. using that to pay the three hundred and odd distributors around the country for selling that stock. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Dillon, Eead & Co. did not retain all of this $1,000,000 fee or selling commission. It distributed that among the various dealers? Mr. DILLON. Who sold the stock. Mr. PECORA. It distributed that among the various dealers who aided Dillon, Eead & Co. in selling to the general public the allotment certificates for the first preferred stock? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Now of that $1,000,000 is it not a fact that Dillon, Eead & Co. retained for its own part in that commission, in that selling operation, something like $339,000 ? Mr. DILLON. That $1,000,000 was equivalent to $4 a share on the 250,000 shares, and each of these three hundred-odd dealers received $4 for each share that they sold. Dillon, Eead & Co. sold some 94,000 Senator COUZENS. He has already testified to that. Mr. DILLON. Yes. Some ninety-four thousand and odd shares, and received three hundred and thirty-nine thousand and odd dollars. Mr. PECORA. Yes. Now by this same process Dillon, Eead & Co. were enabled to acquire for a stated consideration, cash of $5,000,000, the entire authorized issue of second preferred stock consisting of 50,000 shares thereof, and by the payment of a further sum of STOCK EXCHANGE PRACTICES 1567 $100,000 the entire balance of the authorized issue of common stock, amounting to 750,000 shares? Mr. DILLON. I do not know what you mean by \" this process \". Mr. PECORA. By this legal process that Dillon, Read & Co., as you said, engaged this well-known firm of lawyers to act? Mr. DILLON. It carried out our intention of selling to the public $25,000,000 of first preferred stock, with a quarter of the common, and Dillon-Read putting in the $5,100,000 of their own money junior to the first preferred stock—junior to the public's money and receiving three quarters of the common. That was accomplished. Mr. PECORA. That was accomplished? Mr. DILLON. Yes. Mr. PECORA. SO that by this means the general public purchased for $25,000,000 the entire issue of first preferred stock and got with it 250,000 shares of its common capital stock, or 25 percent of the common, and Dillon, Read & Co. and their associates for $5,000,000 Mr. DILLON. $5,100,000. Mr. PECORA (continuing). $5,100,000, acquired the entire issue of the second preferred stock, consisting of 50,000 shares, and 750,000 shares of the common stock ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. Yes. The common stock was the only stock that at that time had any voting powers or rights ? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. And the ownership of the equity of the company was vested in the common stock, was it not ? Mr. DILLON. And the second preferred was junior money. The equity was the common. Mr. PECORA. Yes. The CHAIRMAN. This trust started out in business with about $30,000,000 cash? Mr. DILLON. That is correct. Mr. PECORA. Five million dollars of which came from Dillon, Read & Co., and the other $25,000,000 from the public? Mr. DILLON. Five million one hundred thousand dollars from Dillon, Read &> Co. and $25,000,000 from the public. The CHAIRMAN. What did it do with that capital ? Mr. DILLON. It handled that capital, Senator, I am very happy to tell you, in a very fortunate way. That capital has been invested in diversified investments, and through these very uncertain times that we have faced that capital remains intact. When this corporation was formed $116 roughly was the equity back of each share of the first preferred that the public bought. Since that time this company has paid out in excess of $13,000,000 cash in dividends, paying the first preferred 6 percent per annum from the time they bought that stock. Today the equity back of that stock, instead of being $116, is approximately $138. So that money has been very fortunately handled. Senator COUZENS. May I ask a question at that point ? When you sold this stock—— Mr. DILLON. I want to add to the answer I have just given to the chairman, if I may, Senator Couzens, that those of us that put up the money for the second preferred stock and did not do any selling 1568 STOCK EXCHANGE PEACTICES in the market but kept it as an investment—which I did, and which many of our associates did—have not even had our 6 percent on our second preferred, and we have had nothing on the common, whereas the public have received their 6 percent interest. Excuse me, Senator Couzens. Senator COUZENS. IS there any prospectus that was issued at the time the stock was sold ? Mr. DILLON. Oh, yes. Senator COUZENS. Have you got Mr. DILLON. There is one there. a copy of that ? Does that answer your question, Senator Fletcher? The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I understand that the second preferred stock and the common stock had not paid dividends? Mr. DILLON. N O ; the second preferred paid dividends for a year or two. I have forgotten just what. It paid dividends until 1931, and it has been in arrears since 1931. I think that is correct. The CHAIRMAN. There has been no divide"
