        "text": "In 1740, the Boehm family came to the 13 colonies, determined to live the colonial dream. 48 years later, they moved where Kentucky is now and changed their name to Beam. Hot summers, mild winters and a nearby limestone spring made their new home ideal for—you guessed it—growing corn.\n\nGet ready…the bourbon part is coming soon.\n\nAs the First Family of Bourbon, we were there when it all began. But we’ve never been the type to rest on our laurels. Always innovating, always taking bourbon to new heights—this is the Jim Beam way. On our 225-year anniversary, we have no intention of doing things any differently. Even as we sit here writing our history, the next generation is busy following in the footsteps of all those who came before them—learning the ropes from the ground up. But, more importantly, learning to redefine them in new and innovative ways.\n\nFor a taste of the what the next generation will bring, we invite you to give Little Book® a try, that is, if you can get your hands on a bottle. Blended by Fred Noe’s son, Freddie, both iterations of this limited-edition whiskey have sold out soon after their release."
