        "text": "Wesley “Bud” Nelson age 91 of Blue Earth, passed away on Saturday, January 15th, 2022 at The Shepherd’s Inn in Wells, surrounded by his wife and children. Visitation will be Thursday from 4:00 – 6:00 PM at Patton Funeral Home in Blue Earth. The funeral service will be held on Friday, January 21 at 1:30 PM at Dell Lutheran Church, rural Frost with visitation one hour prior to the service. Pastor Joe Ocker will be officiating. Interment will follow in Dell Lutheran Cemetery. Patton Funeral Home is entrusted with arrangements. www.pattonfh.com\n\nWesley John Nelson was born January 25, 1930 in Emerald Township, Faribault County, Minnesota to John J. and Anna (Amundson) Nelson. As his mother died when he was young, Wes was raised by his father, older sisters, and an aunt. He graduated from Blue Earth High School and attended Ag School at the University of Minnesota. On June 22, 1952, Wes married Irene B. Holmgren. They were blessed with four children.\n\nFaith, family, and farming were the foundations of Wes's life. A man of profound faith, Wes strove to be an example for others. He was a lifelong member of Dell Lutheran Church in rural Frost, serving wherever he was needed as an Elder, President, Bible study/Sunday school teacher, worship leader, and cemetery board member. He loved his wife, and they traveled often to see the kids, grandkids, and great grandkids in their many activities. Wes spent his career farming the same land as his father and grandfather before him. He owned and actively managed his own insurance agency for nearly 50 years after having it passed to him from his dad, who had established the agency in the 1930’s. Insurance became a great interest to him, including crop adjusting, teaching and training new adjusters. He really enjoyed the years he was able to raise sugar beets and had served on the board of the Mason City Sugar Cooperative. His memberships on the South Central Mutual Insurance Board and with the Gideons were also important to him. A highlight for many years was the annual week spent with family to the Brainerd Lakes area and, of course, the many winters spent in Mesa, Arizona. He loved music and often shared his beautiful voice in church, at weddings, funerals and just for fun with family members. The twinkle in his eye and his sense of humor will long be remembered.\n\nWesley is survived by his wife of 69 years, Irene Nelson; sons, Steven (Paulette) Nelson of Owatonna and Timothy (Vicky) Nelson of Blue Earth; daughters Sue (Steve) Frederick of Scottsdale, AZ and Karen (Kellen) Borglum of Bricelyn; 10 grandchildren; 13 great-grandchildren; and many other relatives and friends."
