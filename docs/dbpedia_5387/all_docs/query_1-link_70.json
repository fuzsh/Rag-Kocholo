        "text": "As it prepares for its 35th anniversary season, the Sonoma Film Institute will retain its title as the oldest film repertory organization in the North Bay Area by presenting more than 30 films from August to April, including a screening of Frederick Wiseman’s critically acclaimed documentary “High School” followed by a Q&A from Wiseman himself.\n\nWith a focus on exploring institutions that affect all of society, Wiseman has worked on more than 40 full-length documentaries dealing with topics such as schools, hospitals, public housing and more. In his 1968 film “High School,” which the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress labeled as a national treasure in 1991, Wiseman connects the cultural divisions across America in the 1960s to how one generation passes values on to the next through education.\n\nSince 1973, the Sonoma Film Institute shows has shown more than 30 films throughout the fall and spring semesters ranging from avant-garde to silent cinema. The institute’s fall 2018 season will continue to feature a variety of cinema, from the 1950s crime drama “Pickup on South Street,” to the award winning Japanese murder mystery “The Third Murder” from 2017. Both foreign films \"Until the Birds Return\" and \"Cocote\" are being presented by SFI in their local premiere engagements. Placed in this wide array of films, the Center of Visual Music will continue their contributions to the institute with a program detailing the correspondences between image and sound using experimental animation from a multitude of artists.\n\n\"I am excited about our current schedule because it represents a diverse range of contemporary cinema from throughout the world, including films from countries that are under-represented on local screens,\" said Eleanor Nichols, director of the Sonoma Film Institute.\n\nThe first film to be shown in the upcoming season will be the throwback spaghetti western “The Great Silence,” a movie showcasing breathtaking locations with a head-turning climax. All films will be screened in the Warren Auditorium in Ives Hall at Sonoma State University. Admission is free throughout the entire season with a suggested donation of $5. There is a $5 parking fee in all Sonoma State University lots.
