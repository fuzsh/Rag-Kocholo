Nelson Frederick WELLINGTON was born Ballarat on 04 April 1889. His father was in the building trade - a plasterer and concrete expert. 1 A former pupil of Mount Pleasant, established in Ballarat on 3 August 1874 as State School No. 1436 for 550 scholars and then the Church of England Grammar School, Ballarat. Nelson was, in March 1937, listed in an article from The Age, as a distinguished former pupil. 2 On completing school he joined the Ballarat East Town Council as a junior clerk where he remained for 6 years. In that time, on 19 August 1911, he gained a Certificate of Competence from the Municipal Clerks Board.

Besides singing well my Father was a talented pianist. He could play anything by ear as well as read music. He was much in demand socially all his life because of this entertainment skill. Two of his sisters were also talented musicians so there was a great deal of music in his family life. My Father was also good at sport and played football in the Golden Point team [Now East Point Football Club]. He also rowed well.

His days as a young man were filled with music, sport and municipal training at Ballarat Municipal Offices. When the opportunity came to get a shire secretary's job at Orbost [Gippsland] my Father applied and when he was successful my parents married and went to Orbost to live. 3

The Australian Electoral Roll 1903-1977, available on Ancestry, records their homes and occupations in the 1913 Roll as:

1913 1167 Wellington, Ida May, Orbost, home duties, in Orbost sub-district of Gippsland

1913 1168 Wellington, Nelson Frederick, Orbost, shire secretary, in Orbost sub- district of Gippsland

They lived at âRosslynâ, Salisbury Street, Orbost, then at âRosslynâ Gordon Street, Orbost. Whilst Salisbury and Gordon Streets are on Google maps, âRosslynâ is not.

1821info 13a, sheet 6

During his time at Orbost he was actively involved with local groups and activities.

At the time of his arrival, it was compulsory for all boys between the ages of 14 and 18 to register for military training. As a trained army Lieutenant, he organised a corps of local lads to be provided with rifles and uniforms and undertake some initial training, and later on organised a system of voluntary training in military instruction for all male residents of the district.

He umpired local football matches between Orbost, Newmerella, Cunninghame (Lakes Entrance) and Bruthen football clubs; he captained the Orbost cricket team and was a very competent golfer.

He chaired local meetings and took on the position of auditor of the Orbost branch of the Peopleâs Party.

Both he and Mrs WELLINGTON contributed vocal and recitation items as well as musical accompaniment for local church performances and other occasions, such as a visit by the Governor of Victoria. He was a member of the Orbost Municipal Band. 6

The Snowy River Mail reports the Orbost Shire Hall council meeting, which said farewell to Nelson leaving Orbost for war on 30 April 1915. The President said he was extremely sorry Mr Wellington was leaving, as he had proved a worthy officer. He congratulated him on the position he had attained in the forces, and expressed confidence that he would discharge the duties with honours ...

Nelson the horticulturalist as part of the Soldier Settlement Scheme

Having Â£30 in London's Bank of Australia and Â£120 in Stakes Saving Bank and no liabilities, he didn't require a loan. Nelson's lease was dated 02 June 1919 for a term of 39Â½ years at a cost of Â£304 15 shillings and 3 pence (Â£304.76) repayable over 72 half-yearly instalments of Â£4 4s (Â£4.20), the first being paid on 2 December 1922. The lease was cancelled on 05 April 1928 for non-compliance and confirmed on 22 August 1919.

The settlement in Merbein was virgin land about three miles from Merbein township, and had to be cleared, blocks measured and fenced, and then planted up with vines and citrus and irrigated. [...] We had grapes back and front and an orange grove in the centre. It was a grim life - freezing cold with frosts in the winter and blazing hot for months in the summer. [...] The harsh life at Merbein in 1920 was very difficult to tolerate. A one roomed dwelling was erected between the front vines and the orange on our block - bunks at one end and wood stove and large kitchen stove at the other. [...] Eventually Grandfather Wellington helped us extend the one-roomed cottage. Two rooms were added onto the back of it. [...] We had plenty of fruit as the vines and citrus trees grew and flourished. 8

To Mildura as Shire Secretary

During this time the Electoral Register shows the family still residents of Merbein, though the family had a small flat at the back of the municipal office, right in the centre of Mildura and close to the shops. A second flat was rented above some shops which faced the road behind Deakin Avenue and close to Brownings Store (Brownings Lane(?)).

Nelson meets Pompey Elliott - a supposition

Given Nelsonâs wartime experience, his between wars commitment to the Australian militia and his location and position, it would be surprising if Nelson was not at one of the meetings hosted by Victoriaâs illustrious Brig-Gen. Harold âPompeyâ Elliott, whose original 7/Battalion was formed on Essendon and Moonee Ponds volunteers.

1821info13a, sheet 13

As part of Elliottâs 1925 campaign for re-election to the Federal Senate he travelled around northern Victoria. On Thursday 15 October 1925, Elliott began a four-day stay at Milduraâ s Grand Hotel to give his standard campaign address in Mildura, Merbein and Red Cliff.

After the third of these speeches on Saturday morning, the meeting chairman GC Green announced he had a âpleasant duty to perform on behalf of ex-members of the 7th Battalionâ, who were represented amongst the local resettlement soldier settlers. Green retold the story of how Pompey castigated one of his soldiers, whilst at Mena Camp, Egypt, for appearing on parade without a hat. The soldierâs explanation that his hat had been stolen was scorned until soon afterwards Elliott found his own hat to be missing. Ten years after that event, Green pulled a crumpled felt hat from his pocket and presented it to Elliott. Whilst Elliott was reluctant to spoil a good story, he strongly suspected it was not the real thing.

Later that Saturday, Elliott returned to Mildura as guest of honour at a memorable social of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). The struggling soldier settlers forgot their troubles, enjoyed a jovial evening of spirited singing and memories. They saluted Pompey in genuine gratitude for his keen interest in their cause. 14

The move to Essendon

In 1926 the town clerk of Essendon died and, after an interview in Melbourne, Nelson was, on 29 October 1926, offered the job at a salary of Â£750 per annum (equivalent to Â£119,000 in 2015. In 2015 Prime Minister Cameron was earning Â£146,000. 1 Ida, being in variable heath, was delighted as she found the severe summers difficult to manage. In November that year a public farewell, in Mildura, was arranged. It was a big affair in the town hall and presentations were made. 2

1821info13a, sheet 15

At this time Nelson was a founder member of Essendon Rotary Club and later its secretary. 3

Ida's committee undertook to provide Â£150 a year to the homes maintenance. In July 1928, Ida helped organise a bridge party at Toronga, the residence of Mr and Mrs E.H. Kinnear in Aberfeldie Road, which once stood in the now Aberfeldie Park. Card tables were set in the spacious ballroom, drawing and dining rooms and the committee provided refreshments. 4 Two years later, still on the committee, Ida helped to organise an informal dance held at Lowther Hall, Essendon. 5

Trove suggested that Ida has more social column inches than Nelson has civic mentions. In 1935 Ida's social duties had expanded to train Essendon's 32 debutants for the Essendon Combined Freemasons' ball. 6 In 1938 Ida was president of the Essendon Housewives' Association of Victoria when a craft competition was organised for adults and children in aid of Women in Need. 7 In Ballarat Ida had been a renowned teacher of elocution. With her Ballarat friend being the chair of Melbourne's English Speaking Union and Ida the secretary, she was frequently mentioned in the society pages: Mrs NF Wellington is about to leave on/has returned from her trip to .....

In 1936 the Shire Councils and Essendon in particular, were in the Arbitration Court for letting out council contracts to tender at a reduced rate per hour and with the prospect of unemployment for council workers. Specifically, carters, their horses and insurance were re-employed at a reduction of 12/6 (12 shillings and 6 pence) a week. Nelson was called to give evidence on the contracts, the need for economy and the necessity for getting down to the rates which the council was able to pay. 8

1821info13a, sheet 17

The municipalities of Footscray, Essendon, Braybrook, Werribee and Williamstown were in dispute with the Graziers' Association of Victoria and Southern Rlverina, the Melbourne Stock and Station Agents' Association, the City and Country Land, Stock and Station Agents' Association, the Master Butchers' Association, and Melbourne City Council. The council had in 1929 passed a by-law prohibiting the droving of stock except between midnight and 8am, but it had suspended the law owing to the complaints of those interested in the sale yards, who declared they would not have sufficient road facilities, and that buying for export would have to be practically abandoned.

Nelson, along with the Health Inspector was called to give evidence on behalf of Essendon Council, who were proposing to move the stock yard to another location. 9

Nelson's military life between the wars

Through out this time Nelson maintained his military contacts, being active in the peace time forces with the command of the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles Militia) 3 for 4Â½ years until October 1, 1938. 10 He is recorded as a full colonel at the farewell ball given on the retirement of Lieut. Colonel JJ McKenna, from command of the 57/60 Battalion, at the Drill Hall, Preston. 11

He gained his air pilot's licence with the Royal Victorian Aero Club at Essendon. 12

Post War life

After 12 months convalescing in Queensland, Nelson resumed his role as town clerk in Essendon in June 1945 1, where he presided over the post-war development of Essendon, which involved the building of good quality homes on the old racecourse and the choice of street names. Another concern was the bottle neck between Puckle Street and Flemington Bridge, which could have involved the widening of Mount Alexander Road at a cost of more than Â£1 million, or removing the traffic to Essendon airport. 2

In 1949, for some unknown reason the family, with the children having left home, Nelson and Ida were back in the Junction Hotel on Puckle Street.

On 5 April 1951 The Argus reported that Ida was joint guest of honour, with Nelson, at an afternoon reception after their 15 month trip to the United States. She commented on 'the lack of old women in America, due to the labour saving appliances that can do their work at night if necessary [... and] they can buy what food they want at the marts'. Nelson, after his war leave, convalescences and a fifteen month holiday in America, was still employed as town clerk for Essendon.

1821info13a, sheet 20

That Nelson was received into the Catholic Faith by Bishop Hayes, of Rockhampton, whom Colonel Wellington first knew as Father Romauld Hayes, of St. Columban's Mission, Essendon, was not generally know by the family and by Ida in particular. Nelson was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Fawkner Memorial Park on 26 August 1952 in a grave maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves, who are responsible for the maintenance of all war graves. Ida, given the choice of being buried besides Nelson or in the Protestant section, was buried on 19 October 1964 in an unmarked grave next to Nelson. However, as his grandson Geoffrey Hutson writes 'Ida went through much anguish. She wanted to be with her husband in death, but couldn't bear the shame of being in the Roman Catholic section. The book suggests she is buried in the space alongside Nelson, but when we asked Fawkner they said she was in the plot with him.

Nelson's wartime will was signed on 30 May 1940. In it everything was left to Ida ad his solicitor in Litle Collins Street, his sole Executor. At the time of his death, Nelson was living in Dandenong. Nelson's will is available at Victoria Public Records Office 4 His probate, date 15 January 1953, appoints Ida, Pat and Lyle as executors to allocate the sum of Â£413 1 shilling and 11 pence.

After the death of Nelson, Ida had a flat in Essendon. Later, when her daughter Mickie and granddaughter Libby were visiting from Kansas, they moved in with her daughter Pat at 153 Foster Street, Dandenong.

After Mickie's departure on 29 April 1953, Ida became restless and arrived on the Foster Street doorstep with suitcase saying she couldn't stay at the Majestic any longer and wanted to save to visit Mickie. (Wellington p.258-9)

Ida died on 16 October 1964. Her will leaves her jewellery and clothes to Pat and Mickie and her costume jewellery to her daughter-in-law and grand-daughters. Legacies of Â£100 were left to Mickie, Pat and Dorothy Wellington. Methwyn Hutson and Elizabeth Howard received Â£200, Barney Â£250. 6

'Chip' Wellington has his own page.

1821info13a, sheet 25

Lesley Joan Wellington (known as 'Mickie'), Nelson and Ida Mays third child

Mickie was born on 03 May 1921 at "Quisisana", Dandenong Road, Windsor. 1 On 25 September 1943 Mickey married Alva Bernard HOWARD, born at RDF2 (West) Peculiar, Cass County, Missouri on 04 May 1913/ the third child, first son of Alva and Elizabeth.. Before joining the army, Barney was employed by Standard Oil Company of California as an apprentice machinist and lived at 162 Santa Fe Avenue, Richmond, Contra Costa, California. 2 Barney had enlisted in the army on 01 August 1942 and was discharged on 23 September 1946. He reenlisted, for Korea, on 01 December 1957 and was discharged on 31 May 1961. 3

My Father decided to investigate Barney's family background through a Rotary friend in America. The information obtained disclosed that Barney's family were a Methodist family â the parents living on a prosperous farm near Kansas City. The farm was originally purchased with money Barney's father made on the goldfields of Ballarat on his stop over in Australia on his way to USA from England. The father still had his miner's licence. [...] Barney was single and had not been married. It was reported that the family were highly respected in their district. My parents then relaxed a bit but did not really want Joan to marry an American and go to USA to live â not their precious "delicate" daughter carefully protected all her life. However, Barney proceeded to charm them all, won over my sister and my parents and they all went to Surfer's Paradise for the Easter holidays to celebrate the engagement. I was amazed at this news and just hoped it was the right decision. [...] I could only wish them well and hope for the best. 4

Joan and Barney began to think about marriage in Rockhampton if there was no sign of his unit going overseas in the immediate future. Barney applied for leave in September and tentative arrangements for the wedding were made. Joan invited me to be matron of honour and there was to be one other bridesmaid. [...] My Father said he would solve that and I could go with him to Rockhampton by army plane. He could see no difficulty as I was an air force staff officer. [...]My sister and Barney were married in Rockhampton on 25 September 1943 [...] 5

1821info13a, sheet 26

With Nelson commuting between Melbourne and Brisbane and Barney being in North Queensland, Ida and Mickey decided to take an apartment at Orient House in Redcliffe. Here Mickey began to organise her eventual departure to the USA by the 'brideship' SS Marinosa that arrived San Francisco on 06 March 1946. Two years later, her naturalisation papers, recorded her living at 6175 Alameda, El Paso, Texas as a housewife with one child.

1821info13a, sheet 27

In 1948, after retiring from Essendon City Council, Nelson and Ida planned an extended visit, sailing on the Mariposa, to see Mickey and granddaughter Libby. When Nelson died on 24 August 1952, Mickie was unable to be at the funeral but in October/November 1952, she and Libby flew to Melbourne to visit Ida for four months, staying in the Majestic Private Hotel in St. Kilda, where Ida then lived. Shortly after Libby became ill with whopping cough and needed admission to the Royal Children's Hospital for several weeks. Mickie returned to Melbourne in January 1953, from seeing friends in Sydney and relatives in Mildura, to plan to return to the US. She sailed in the Oronsay on 29 April 1953 to London, for the Coronation, and then sailed to America on the Queen Mary in July 1953. 6

[...]Barney refused to come to Australia with her and she did not know when she would get the chance to come again. Barney's excuse was that he had an overdose of travelling during the war. [...] We wondered about the marriage but when Mickie and Libby returned to Kansas City everything seemed to continue as before. My Mother settled in to The Majestic at first, after Mickie's departure, but gradually became restless and missed Mickie very much. They had always been very close. It seemed a pity Mickie had chosen to marry an American and live so far from home. After coasting for a while my Mother decided to leave The Majestic [and] wanted us to help her save enough money to go and visit my sister. 7

In 1950 Barney, Mickie and Elizabeth were living on the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, El Paso, Texas, where Elizabeth had been born in 1948. Barney was employed in ordnance. 8

After treatment for a breast lump, in 1954, Ida was given medical permission to fly to Germany provided that Mickie was willing to accept responsibility for her condition.

[...] Mickie, Barney and Libby were in Stuttgart. Barney was stationed at a US base there and they were living in army staff housing. As soon as my Mother felt well enough to travel she was keen to join them, but needed a bit more finance to do this. My Father had bought two blocks of land at Port Douglas when he was in Queensland and it was developing into a tourist resort and land prices going up. My Mother was in the process of working out my Father's legacy with her solicitor. If she sold both blocks, and with her savings, she would have enough to go to Germany. 9

Ballarat's Avenue of Honour

Trees in Ballarat's Avenue of Honour (Remembrance Drive) were planted by the ladies of E. Lucas Clothing Factory in honour of all the men from Ballarat and district who fought in the Great War. Source: Karen Walsh

Ballarat Councillor Glen Crompton (no relation, but one of three Crompton families in old Ballarat), writes, with pride:

'At 22km Ballarat boast the longest First World War commemorative avenue in the world and the Arch structure is acknowledged within Paris’ grand Arc. The original tree plantings were undertaken between 1917 and 1919. Unfortunately, The Avenue fell to neglect over the years. Trees were lost to harsh natural events, road building, and vehicle crashes. Many of the plaques identifying the trees were damaged or pilfered. In a final insult, the avenue’s full length was severed 20 years ago as a result of the construction of a freeway.'

'Ballarat's Arch of Victory and Avenue of Honour Committee has spent decades quite simply adhering to the remembrance axiom, 'We will remember them'. By 25 April 25 2015, the centenary of ANZAC day, the Avenue had been restored to its full complement of 3801 tree, each and every one bearing a commemorative plaque. The Arch had been fully restored and rejuvenated. Incredibly, The Avenue was re-connected to its full length after the Road Authority constructed a magnificent overpass for the freeway. This was not merely a bridge, rather a spectacular engineering and landscaping feat which enhances The Avenue'.
