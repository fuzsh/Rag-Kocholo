        "text": "History\n\nThe Commonwealth Naval Forces were established on 1 March 1901, two months after the federation of Australia, when the naval forces of the separate Australian colonies were amalgamated. A period of uncertainty followed as the policy makers sought to determine the newly established force's requirements and purpose, with the debate focusing upon whether Australia's naval force would be structured mainly for local defence or whether it would be designed to serve as a fleet unit within a larger imperial force, controlled centrally by the British Admiralty. In 1908–09, the decision was made to pursue a compromise solution, and the Australian government agreed to establish a force that would be used for local defence but which would be capable of forming a fleet unit within the imperial naval strategy, albeit without central control. As a result, the navy's force structure was set at \"one battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers and three submarines\".\n\nOn 10 July 1911, King George V granted the service the title of \"Royal Australian Navy\". The first of the RAN's new vessels, the destroyer Yarra, was completed in September 1910 and by the outbreak of the First World War the majority of the RAN's planned new fleet had been realised. The Australian Squadron was placed under control of the British Admiralty, and initially it was tasked with capturing many of Germany's South Pacific colonies and protecting Australian shipping from the German East Asia Squadron. Later in the war, most of the RAN's major ships operated as part of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean and North Seas, and then later in the Adriatic, and then the Black Sea following the surrender of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1919, the RAN received a force of six destroyers, three sloops and six submarines from the Royal Navy, but throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the RAN was drastically reduced in size due to a variety of factors including political apathy and economic hardship as a result of the Great Depression. In this time the focus of Australia's naval policy shifted from defence against invasion to trade protection, and several fleet units were sunk as targets or scrapped. By 1923, the size of the navy had fallen to eight vessels, and by the end of the decade it had fallen further to five, with just 3,500 personnel. In the late 1930s, as international tensions increased, the RAN was modernised and expanded, with the service receiving primacy of funding over the Army and Air Force during this time as Australia began to prepare for war.\n\nEarly in the Second World War, RAN ships again operated as part of Royal Navy formations, many serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and off the West African coast. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the virtual destruction of British naval forces in south-east Asia, the RAN operated more independently, or as part of United States Navy formations. As the navy took on an even greater role, it was expanded significantly and at its height the RAN was the fourth-largest navy in the world, with 39,650 personnel operating 337 warships. A total of 34 vessels were lost during the war, including three cruisers and four destroyers.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the size of the RAN was again reduced, but it gained new capabilities with the acquisition of two aircraft carriers, Sydney and Melbourne. The RAN saw action in many Cold War–era conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region and operated alongside the Royal Navy and United States Navy off Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Since the end of the Cold War, the RAN has been part of Coalition forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, operating in support of Operation Slipper and undertaking counter piracy operations. It was also deployed in support of Australian peacekeeping operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.\n\nCommand structure\n\nThe strategic command structure of the RAN was overhauled during the New Generation Navy changes. The RAN is commanded through Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Canberra. The professional head is the Chief of Navy (CN), who holds the rank of Vice Admiral. NHQ is responsible for implementing policy decisions handed down from the Department of Defence and for overseeing tactical and operational issues that are the purview of the subordinate commands.\n\nBeneath NHQ are two subordinate commands:\n\nFleet Command: fleet command is led by Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSFLT). COMAUSFLT holds the rank of rear admiral; previously, this post was Flag Officer Commanding HM's Australian Fleet (FOCAF), created in 1911, but the title was changed in 1988 to the Maritime Commander Australia. On 1 February 2007, the title changed again, becoming Commander Australian Fleet. The nominated at-sea commander is Commodore Warfare (COMWAR), a one-star deployable task group commander. Fleet command has responsibility to CN for the full command of assigned assets, and to Joint Operations command for the provision of operationally ready forces.\n\nNavy Strategic Command: the administrative element overseeing the RAN's training, engineering and logistical support needs. Instituted in 2000, the Systems Commander was appointed at the rank of commodore; in June 2008, the position was upgraded to the rank of rear admiral.\n\nFleet Command was previously made up of seven Force Element Groups, but after the New Generation Navy changes, this was restructured into four Force Commands:\n\nFleet Air Arm, responsible for the navy's aviation assets\n\nMine Warfare, Hydrographic and Patrol Boat Force, an amalgamation of the previous Patrol Boat, Hydrographic, and Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Forces, operating what are collectively termed the RAN's \"minor war vessels\"\n\nSubmarine Force, operating the Collins-class submarines\n\nSurface Force, covering the RAN's surface combatants (generally ships of frigate size or larger)\n\nFleet\n\nAs of January 2016, the RAN fleet consists of 47 warships, including frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships. Ships commissioned into the RAN are given the prefix HMAS (His/Her Majesty's Australian Ship).\n\nThe RAN has two primary bases for its fleet:\n\nFleet Base East, located at HMAS Kuttabul, Sydney; and\n\nFleet Base West, located at HMAS Stirling, near Perth.\n\nIn addition, three other bases are home to the majority of the RAN's minor war vessels:\n\nHMAS Cairns, at Cairns; and\n\nHMAS Coonawarra, at Darwin;\n\nHMAS Waterhen, at Sydney.\n\nCurrent ships\n\nThe RAN currently operates 47 commissioned vessels, made up of eight ship classes and three individual ships, plus three non-commissioned vessels.\n\nFleet Air Arm\n\nThe Fleet Air Arm (previously known as the Australian Navy Aviation Group) provides the RAN's aviation capability. As of 2013, the FAA consists of three active squadrons plus a fourth being activated, operating five helicopter types in the anti-submarine warfare and maritime support roles. The Fleet Air Arm is based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, New South Wales, and operates from the RAN's frigates, large amphibious warfare vessels, and large support ships.\n\nLADS Flight\n\nIn addition to the helicopter squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm, the RAN operates an additional flying unit that comes under the operational responsibility of the Australian Hydrographic Service. The Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight contains the sole remaining fixed-wing aircraft operated by the RAN, and is based at HMAS Cairns in Cairns, Queensland.\n\nClearance Diving Branch\n\nThe Clearance Diving Branch is composed of two Clearance Diving Teams (CDT) that serve as parent units for naval clearance divers:\n\nClearance Diving Team 1 (AUSCDT ONE), based at HMAS Waterhen in New South Wales; and\n\nClearance Diving Team 4 (AUSCDT FOUR), based at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia.\n\nWhen clearance divers are sent into combat, Clearance Diving Team Three (AUSCDT THREE) is formed.\n\nThe CDTs have two primary roles:\n\nMine counter-measures (MCM) and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD); and\n\nMaritime tactical operations.\n\nFuture\n\nThere are currently several major projects underway that will see upgrades to RAN capabilities:\n\nProject AIR 9000 Phase 8 is a project to replace the RAN's Seahawk (and cancelled Kaman SH-2G(A) Super Seasprite) helicopters with 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters.\n\nProject JP 2048 Phase 3 will provide six Heavy Landing Craft to replace the RAN's Balikpapan-class vessels. The project is planned to deliver capability in 2014–2016.\n\nProject SEA 1429 will upgrade the Collins-class submarines with state-of-the-art heavyweight torpedoes.\n\nProject SEA 1439 Phase 4A will equip the Collins-class submarines with a new tactical combat system.\n\nProject SEA 1654 Phase 3 is a project to acquire a Sea Logistic Support and Replenishment Support vessel to replace the supply ship HMAS Success.\n\nProject SEA 4000, under which the RAN will acquire three Hobart-class air warfare destroyers, built around the United States Navy Aegis air and surface combat management system. The vessels are to be based on the Spanish Álvaro de Bazán-class frigate.\n\nTo boost the RAN's amphibious capability during the construction of the Canberra-class LHDs, the RAN acquired HMAS Choules (a former Bay-class landing ship of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary) in December 2011, and the support vessel ADV Ocean Shield in June 2012.\n\nFuture procurement plans include:\n\ntwelve Future Submarines, under Project SEA 1000, to replace the Collins-class (up to 4,000 tons, potentially equipped with cruise missiles and minisubs); and\n\nnine Future Frigates to replace the Anzac-class frigates (possibly up to 7,000 tons and equipped with cruise missiles). RAN expects to let 6 countries tender for $30 billion in 2016, and make a selection in 2018. Ships are to be built in Australia.\n\nCurrent operations\n\nThe RAN currently has forces deployed on four major operations:\n\nOperation Slipper: Australia's commitment to the International Coalition forces in Afghanistan;\n\nOperation Resolute: border protection;\n\nOperation Manitou: counter-piracy, counter-terrorism and maritime stability in the Middle East; and\n\nOperation Accordion: support operation to provide sustainment to forces deployed on Operations Slipper and Manitou.\n\nPersonnel\n\nAs of June 2011, the RAN has 14,215 permanent full-time personnel, 161 gap year personnel, and 2,150 reserve personnel. The permanent full-time force consisted of 3,357 commissioned officers, and 10,697 enlisted personnel. In June 2010, male personnel made up 82% of the permanent full-time force, while female personnel made up 18%. The RAN has the highest percentage of women in the ADF, compared to the RAAF's 17.8% and the Army's 9.7%.\n\nThe following are the current senior Royal Australian Navy officers:\n\nVice Admiral Ray Griggs – Vice Chief of the Defence Force\n\nVice Admiral David Johnston – Chief of Joint Operations\n\nVice Admiral Tim Barrett – Chief of Navy\n\nRear Admiral Michael Noonan – Deputy Chief of Navy\n\nRear Admiral Stuart Mayer – Commander Australian Fleet\n\nRear Admiral Jonathan Mead – Head Navy Capability\n\nRear Admiral Michael Uzzell – Head Navy Engineering\n\nCommodore Brett Brace – Hydrographer of Australia\n\nCommodore Bruce Kafer – Director-General Australian Navy Cadets and Reserves\n\nWarrant Officer Gary Wight – Warrant Officer of the Navy\n\nThe RAN needs 2,000 recruits, including 700 apprentices, to crew the next generation of warships, such as air warfare destroyers, which enter service next decade. To overcome a lack of Australian recruits, the RAN began to recruit sailors who have been laid off from other western navies.\n\nRanks and uniforms\n\nThe uniforms of the Royal Australian Navy are very similar in cut, colour and insignia to their British Royal Navy forerunners. However, beginning with the Second World War all RAN personnel began wearing shoulder flashes reading Australia, a practice continuing today. These are cloth arcs at shoulder height on uniforms, metallic gold on officers' shoulder boards, and embroidered on shoulder slip-ons.\n\nCommissioned officers\n\nCommissioned officers of the Australian Navy have pay grades ranging from S-1 to O-11. The only O-11 position in the navy is honorary and has only ever been held by royalty, currently being held by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh. The highest position occupied in the current Royal Australian Navy structure is O-9, a vice admiral who serves as the Chief of the Navy. O-8 (rear admiral) to O-11 (admiral of the fleet) are referred to as flag officers, O-5 (commander) and above are referred to as senior officers, while S-1 (midshipman) to O-4 (lieutenant commander) are referred to as junior officers. All officers of the Navy receive a commission from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. The Commissioning Scroll issued in recognition of the commission is signed by the Governor General of Australia as Commander-in-Chief and the serving Minister for Defence.\n\nNaval officers are trained at the Royal Australian Naval College (HMAS Creswell) in Jervis Bay, New South Wales and the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.\n\nOther ranks\n\nRoyal Australian Navy Other Ranks wear \"right arm rates\" insignia, called \"Category Insignia\" to indicate speciality training qualifications. The use pattern mirrors that of the Royal Navy, and has since formation. Stars or a Crown are added to these to indicate higher qualifications.\n\nSpecial insignia"
