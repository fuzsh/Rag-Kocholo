        "text": "Stainless steel or high-carbon steel\n\nAir Force Shop's swords are available in either high carbon steel or stainless steel. Outwardly swords made of these different materials look virtually identical, so what is the difference?\n\nStainless Steel\n\nStainless steel is made by alloying chromium and steel. To be classified as stainless the chromium content must be 12% or greater. The chromium protects the steel from corrosion (rust) by forming a protective layer of chromium oxide. This makes stainless steel easier to maintain however, in terms of sword performance, it has its drawbacks. The addition of chromium makes the steel more brittle, which means it is more likely to break if stressed, although this is only a major consideration if the sword is intended to be used in a combat situation.\n\nHigh Carbon Steel\n\nHigh carbon steel is the traditional material for the forging of military swords. High carbon steel is steel with a carbon content of between 0.6% and 0.95%. High carbon steel swords are less likely to break and hold an edge better but require more maintenance than stainless steel swords. The blade of a carbon steel sword should be lightly oiled with a mineral oil or a sewing machine oil. You should always avoid touching the blade of a high carbon steel sword with bare hands as the acids in your skin can cause rust. Never store a high carbon steel sword in its scabbard as this can trap moisture.\n\nCeremonial Military Swords\n\nAir Force Shop is an official Defence Recognised Supplier to the Australian Defence Forces. We understand your requirements-whether you are a serving military member or an astute military collector, you demand unrivalled quality and the finest workmanship in collectables and memorabilia.\n\nWhich is why Air Force Shop - one of Australia's most reputable suppliers of exquisite military memorabilia and collectables - invites you to peruse our superb collection of blades from one of the world's leading sword makers - Windlass Steelcrafts, which is an ISO accredited sword maker.\n\nUsed by and made to the exact specifications of the Australian Defence Forces and the British Ministry of Defence, Windlass swords ensure the highest standards of craftsmanship by using traditional manufacturing techniques and individual hand-assembled. Blades are forged from a single billet of high-carbon or stainless steel, hand-ground, hardened and tempered, and polished to a mirror finish before acid-etching with their distinctive, ornate patterns.\n\nEach sword's hilt or guard is cast in brass or pressed in steel before shaping, mirror-polishing and gold or nickel electro-plating. The grip core is carved from wood and covered in ray-skin before being bound with gold or silver-plated wire.\n\nYour sword is superbly finished by the inclusion of hand-made scabbards produced from rawhide leather or wood covered with pig or goat-skin. A team of inspectors certifies your magnificent sword through exhaustive and demanding tests so you are assured it is to the highest quality standards demanded by both tradition and Commonwealth Armed Forces.\n\nSo, whether you are selecting a precious blade for your uniform; to collect; or as a unique Christmas gift that will be treasured forever, all Air Force Shop swords provide you with unrivalled quality and value for money.\n\nAir Force Shop offers all our discerning clients a 100% money back guarantee on the quality of each sword, scabbard, and boxes and stands for our miniatures. Your investment in a precious Windlass sword is also supported by a Royal Warrant of Appointment.\n\nWhile we are confident we offer the most affordable prices, we also extend to you our price guarantee, where Air Force Shop will match or beat any advertised price*.\n\n*Proof of lower advertised price must be presented to Air Force Shop to ensure you receive the benefits of our price guarantee.\n\nStainless steel or high-carbon steel\n\nAir Force Shop's swords are available in either high carbon steel or stainless steel.
