        "text": "Colour Sergeant\n\nThe rank of colour sergeant was introduced into the British Army in 1813 as the protector of the ensign and the Colour.\n\nThere was/is no such rank in the Australian Army except at the Royal Military College Duntroon, where it was a rank within the Corps of Staff Cadets.\n\nThe escorts in a Colour Party are often Staff Sergeants and for ceremonial occasions, when Colours are on parade, they are referred to as the colour sergeants.\n\nThe rank did exist in Colonial Units. The most famous Australian ever to hold the rank was General Sir John Monash who was Colour Sergeant of 4th Battalion Victorian Rifles. Details\n\nLance Sergeant (no longer used in Australia)\n\nStrictly speaking the rank of Lance Sergeant was (should have been) used only in the context of the Australian Light Horse. He was normally a senior sergeant who literally held the lance bearing the Brigade pennant and was alongside the Brigade Commander during a campaign.\n\nThe lance sergeant (by holding the raised lance) would indicate to the other men where the brigade commander was on the field. Remember this was a time when Brigade Commanders were in the front line, leading by example.\n\nRegarding the Lance Sergeant in relation to Infantry Battalions it was used as a floating (appointment) rank between Corporal and Sergeant. It was and still is used in the British army as a definite rank, but in the Australian army it appears it was used in a semi-official way. A Lance Sergeant had the same pay as a Sergeant , same responsibilities and the same chevrons.\n\nI believe though that demotion for a Lance Sergeant was a matter of a stroke of the pen as the rank was not official.\n\nIn some units the rank was referred to as the still used Temporary Sergeant or Acting Sergeant.\n\nLance Corporal\n\nThe appointed rank of Lance Corporal is based on the old British rank of the same name that was originally called or referred to as 'chosen man'. In other words the one next to take control of the section if the Corporal was to be killed or wounded. In the Australian Army the rank is the only one for which a soldier does not have to pass a specified test or series of tests. It is the first rung on the ladder to Field Marshal. It is the only appointed rank and demotion is easy if the man does not measure up.\n\n2nd Corporal (no longer used)\n\nIn WW1 in Engineer Units (particularly Railway Units) the rank of 2nd Corporal was used. It equates with Lance Corporal.\n\nThe pieces of fabric (shoulder straps) going from shoulder to neck on uniform shirts or jackets is called an epaulette. It is possible but unusual to put officer's badges of rank on them. More common is to put the badges on a slide or a board and slide the whole lot over the epaulette. These are some examples of both methods . . ."
