He transferred to adult forces in July 1917 as ordinary seaman and became rated as a signal man on 1 December 1917, and later as a Leading Seaman and as Petty Officer (Yeoman of Signals) on 1 July 1919. As a trained engineer, Waterhouse was Appointed Engineer-Lieutenant in the RANR with effect from 1 February 1927 and later as Appointed Engineer-Lieutenant Commander in 1935. This same year he was awarded the Volunteer Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In 1944 Waterhouse was transferrd to Retired List which he held until July 1955 when he became a permanent resident of the United States . In 1926, 'Gus' had proposed the erection of a National Sea Memorial on Sow and Pigs Reef using the tripod mast of HMAS SYDNEY, which had sunk the EMDEN at Cocos Island on 9 November, 1914 . He had proposed a concrete superstructure in the shape of a cross with the lower end in the form of steps and a landing stage to enable small craft to berth. The suggestion was aired in the media and eventually the mast was erected on Bradley's Head, Sydney Harbour in 1934. Gus also wrote many articles on naval issues, particularly drawing on his engineering background ."
