        "text": "POLICY\n\nAuthorized honours (orders, decorations, medals, and the insignia for mentions-in-dispatches, commendations and citations) may be worn, when appropriate, by entitled personnel. Where doubt exists on entitlement, the Command concerned shall refer the matter to NDHQ/DH&R for clarification. No officer or non- commissioned member shall carry or wear an order, decoration or medal while engaged in operations against the enemy.\n\nOrders, decorations and medals may be worn with ceremonial and mess dress orders. See Chapter 2, Annex A, and Chapter 5. Guidance on selecting honours for wear should follow the principles in sub-sub-paragraphs 8.a. (1) and (2) and sub-paragraph 9.a.\n\nUndress ribbons and related insignia are worn on lesser dress orders as detailed in paragraph 12. and Chapter 5.\n\nHonours are not worn on military outerwear, such as topcoats (gabardines), parkas, and raincoats. These are worn over ceremonial dress tunics and jackets, which themselves bear the honours. (See paragraph 11 for comparative civilian protocol).\n\nAlthough honour insignia may be bequeathed or given to a relative or friend (for Canadian orders, with the concurrence of the Order), only honours actually awarded to the individual concerned may be worn, regardless of the occasion.\n\nThe members have the option of choosing the means of having medals court mounted, e.g. getting the work done themselves and claiming reimbursement via a CF 52 General Allowance Claim or having the work done through base supply, who will action via LPO or whatever means provides the best economies.\n\nMembers claiming via CF 52 will be limited to amount determined by local commanders in accordance with financial regulations;\n\nMiniature medals must be court-mounted at personal expense.\n\nMETHOD OF MOUNTING AND WEARING ORDERS, DECORATIONS AND MEDALS\n\nGeneral\n\nOrder of Precedence. The insignia of Canadian, Commonwealth and foreign orders, decorations and medals shall be worn in order of precedence without interval, with the senior closest to the centre of the chest.\n\nMethod of Wear. Medals should hang in one row so that they are fully visible. Should this not be possible, because of the number being worn, they shall be overlapped horizontally with the senior medal showing in full. Normally, six or more standard size medals and more than eight miniatures will require overlapping. The maximum width of the mounting is governed by the physique of the individual. The bar should not normally project beyond the outer edge of the lapel or the arm seam of the jacket.\n\nCourt Mountings. Court mounting shall be used. The length from the top of the medal bar suspender to the bottom edge of the medal shall be 10 cm. The ribbons and medals shall be mounted on a panel, its size being determined by the number of ribbons worn. The lower edge of the panel shall be in line with the centre of the medals. Commencing from the lower edge, each ribbon runs up the front of the panel to the top and back down to the medal. The medals shall then be stitched to the panel to prevent them from swinging. This method prevents medals from clinking against each other.\n\nUndress Ribbons. Undress ribbons are worn as detailed in paragraphs 12 and 13. Undress ribbons shall not be visible when full size orders, decorations and medals are worn. Detachable ribbon bars should be used where necessary and appropriate and removed prior to affixing medals to the jacket.\n\nBroad Riband. The broad riband of the senior degrees of some Commonwealth and foreign orders is worn over the shoulder, with the bow from which the badge is suspended on the opposite hip; normally the right shoulder and left hip, although officers of the orders concerned will provide correct instructions. With ceremonial tunics and jackets, the broad riband passes under any shoulder strap or board. With mess dress or civilian evening attire, it is worn under the jacket and over a waistcoat, and over a gown for a woman’s civilian evening dress. Wear may be restricted to occasions in the presence of official representatives of the country to which the order belongs or during visits to or service in that country. Only one riband will be worn, normally the senior if the member possesses more than one. However, the occasion will guide the choice.\n\nCollars of Office. The wear of a collar of office of an order is limited to those official occasions of significance and import to the office and order. When a collar is worn, any broad riband or neck ribbon of that order is not. The collar does not include the badge or insignia of the order. The badge or insignia is worn suspended either from the collar of office, when it is worn, or from a ribbon, when the collar is not worn. Collars are worn under shoulder straps, hanging an equal distance back and front, with the badge suspended below the front centre.\n\nStars of Orders. A maximum of four stars of orders may be worn on the left side of a tunic or jacket, or civilian evening dress (white tie) or equivalent woman’s civilian gown. Only one star may be worn with a civilian dinner jacket (black tie) or equivalent long or short gown:\n\nThe first or only star is worn in line with the centre line of the breast pocket, and with the star’s upper point 2.5 cm below the lip of the pocket, below any medals, or in the corresponding position on garments without a breast pocket.\n\nIf more than one star may be worn, a second star is placed directly below the first, 2.5 cm apart. A third is worn horizontally with the second, senior to the right, 2.5 cm apart, and both centred below the first. (If this position interferes with a broad riband, the first and second stars may be worn in a horizontal line, with the senior to the right, and the third star beneath.) A fourth star is worn below the second and third, in vertical line with the first.\n\nCanadian commendations are worn above foreign Stars of Orders.\n\nCeremonial Dress (for wear of stars and broad ribands, see paragraph 7.).\n\nNeck Badges\n\nA maximum of two neck badges may be worn with service dress jackets, and three with high collared jackets. Since neck badges cannot be worn on the left breast with other orders, decorations and medals, those in excess of the maximum authorized shall not be worn.\n\nMembers in possession of more than the maximum number of neck badges may select which ones to wear, normally, but not necessarily, the senior ones in order of precedence. The occasion will guide the choice.\n\nNeck badges shall be worn from the full-width ribbon, as illustrated in Figures 4-1 and 4-2. The ribbon of the sole or senior badge shall be worn under the shirt collar and the badge over the tie, immediately below the knot.\n\nA second neck badge shall be suspended by a ribbon passed through the appropriate button hole so that the medal is suspended under the button, overlying the seam. With navy blue jackets, the next senior badge shall be worn with a full size ribbon immediately below the senior badge, the lower part of the badge resting on the cross of the lapel of the jacket.\n\nMembers wearing authorized high collared tunics and jackets shall wear the senior ribbon round the neck inside and under the collar, with sufficient ribbon emerging from immediately above the top closure button to position the top of the badge 2 cm below the collar. The second and third badges shall be suspended by ribbon, passed through the appropriate button hole so that the medal is suspended under the button, overlying the seam.\n\nOther Decorations and Medals (see Figures 4-1 and 4-2)\n\nDecorations and medals are worn court mounted, suspended from the left breast of the service dress jacket, immediately above and centred to conceal any undress ribbons.\n\nBars and clasps shall be evenly spaced between the top and bottom ends of the ribbon, unless manufactured to grasp the hanger of the medal or a previous bar. In either case, where bars and clasps differ in design, the one first earned shall be nearest the medal.\n\nThe numeral signifying United Nations/NATO tours shall be worn by members who have completed two or more qualifying tours with the same mission for which a numeral has been approved. The numeral for UN missions is silver in colour and bronze coloured for NATO missions. The numeral shall be centred on the appropriate ribbon of UN medals. On NATO medals the numeral shall be centred below the bar.\n\nIf a mention-in-dispatches has been awarded during a campaign or conflict recognized with a separate medal, the insignia shall be worn centred on the medal ribbon and undress ribbon, or worn above and spaced evenly with any bars, numerals or similar devices on the medal ribbon (see also paragraph 15.).\n\nMess Dress (see Figure 4-3 – for wear of stars and broad ribands, see paragraph 7.).\n\nNeck Badges\n\nOnly one neck badge is worn. It should normally be the senior, however a junior or foreign badge may be worn if it is more appropriate to the occasion.\n\nThe badge shall be full size and shall be worn hanging 2 cm below the bow tie and 2 cm below the bottom collar seam of the blouse. The badge shall be suspended by the neck ribbon of the order, in miniature width where possible.\n\nMiniature insignia of all the neck badges entitled to be worn, including the one worn round the neck, shall be worn with other miniature insignia on the left breast unless the insignia is one which is never worn in miniature, e.g., Order of Merit (British) and Order of the Companions of Honour (British).\n\nOther Decorations and Medals\n\nNavy Mess Dress. Miniature decorations and medals are worn centred on the left lapel, 1 cm below the horizontal edge of the lapel notch on the navy blue jacket and in a corresponding position on the lapel of the navy white jacket. They shall not extend beyond the lapel on the inner side, but, when necessary, may extend beyond the lapel towards the shoulder.\n\nArmy, Air Force (and CAF Midnight Blue) Mess Dress. Miniature decorations and medals are worn on the left breast, centred between the seam of the sleeve and the edge of the lapel, 11.5 cm down from the shoulder seam, or 1.3 cm below a flying or specialist skill badge.\n\nDimensions. Length from the top of the medal bar suspender to the bottom edge of the medals shall be a maximum of 5 cm. Regular size Arabic numerals for medals such as United Nations medals are worn centred on the miniature ribbon.\n\nCivilian Evening Dress (for wear of stars and broad ribbons, see paragraph 7.). Where decorations are appropriate for the occasion, the following shall apply to either evening dress or a dinner jacket, as applicable:\n\nNeck Badges\n\nMen. As described in paragraph 9.\n\nWomen. Wear only one full size badge. It is worn on a bow and attached to the dress immediately above any miniatures being worn. In addition to the full size badge, a miniature shall also be included on a medal bar when other miniatures are being worn. If miniatures are not being worn, the full size badge shall be worn without a miniature, with the top of the bow centred on the left side of the dress, approximately 7.5 cm down from the shoulder seam.\n\nMiniatures\n\nMen. Wear miniatures on a narrow lapel jacket centred above the left breast pocket, with the bottom of the miniature 0.6 cm above the top of the pocket. On a wide lapel jacket, miniatures are worn centred on the left lapel, at approximately the same height above the pocket line as in the case of narrow lapels.\n\nWomen. Wear miniatures suspended from a medal bar attached to the left side of the dress, approximately 13 cm down from the shoulder seam, where practicable. If in possession of only one such award, it may be worn on a bow.\n\nCivilian Morning Dress, Lounge Suits, Blazers, and Day Dresses\n\nWhere decorations are appropriate for the occasion, such as investitures, Remembrance Day and other memorial services, and some formal parades, one neck badge suspended from the full-width ribbon, and/or full-sized medals are normally worn.\n\nAs many as four stars of orders may be worn on a tailcoat, but only one on a director’s (short black) coat or an afternoon dress. Stars of orders are not worn on lounge suits or blazers.\n\nWhen lounge suits, blazers and equivalent women’s attire are worn in the evening in lieu of evening dress, it is quite acceptable to wear miniatures rather than full sized medals, in which case any neck badge would be suspended from the miniature width ribbon.\n\nOnly those full-size insignia mounted on a medal bar may be worn on a civilian overcoat at outdoor functions. Neck badges are covered normally by outerwear. Stars of orders are not worn on overcoats.\n\nIncluded in the insignia of some orders and decorations is a lapel badge. This badge may be worn on the left lapel of a coat or jacket at any time when the full size or miniature insignia or the undress ribbons are not being worn. Women wear this badge in a similar position on a dress.\n\nWhen orders, decorations, and medals are worn, commendations and other authorized emblems shall not be obscured, and where necessary shall be repositioned lower, 2.6. cm from the bottom of the medals to the top edge of the senior commendation or emblem.\n\nMETHOD OF WEARING UNDRESS RIBBONS\n\n(see Figure 4-4)\n\nGeneral\n\nUndress ribbons of orders, decorations and medals may be sewn, but shall normally be placed on a detachable ribbon bar and pinned, on the left breast of the service dress jacket, and on Nos. 2B, 3B and 3D orders of dress. Ribbons shall be worn in order of precedence from right to left of the wearer, with the senior ribbon closest to the centre of the chest on the top or only row. Where a single ribbon constitutes a row, it shall be worn centred above a lower row, or when worn as a single ribbon, centred on the garment as detailed in paragraph 13.\n\nRibbon rows shall not be worn more than 0.3 cm apart.\n\nThe number of ribbons worn in a single row is governed by the physique of the individual and the type of garment being worn. The grouping, however, shall respect the following conditions:\n\nribbons shall not be fully obscured by the lapel of the garment;\n\na maximum of three ribbons may be worn in a single row on authorized service dress jackets;\n\nup to three ribbons may be worn in a single row on short-sleeved shirts;\n\nwhere three ribbons cannot be worn in a single row without one becoming fully obscured, ribbons shall be worn in two rows, with two ribbons on the bottom and the senior ribbon centred above;\n\nribbons shall not be arranged in more rows than are necessary to comply with these instructions;\n\nwhere more than one row of ribbons is worn, no row shall contain fewer ribbons than the row above;\n\nwhen more than one row of ribbons is worn, a single ribbon shall not be worn as a lower row;\n\nsucceeding rows shall, without fully obscuring any ribbon, be centred above the lower row;\n\nwhen there is such a significant number of ribbons that centering the two ribbons above or the single ribbon above a full row causes the ribbons to be obscured by the lapel, then the ribbons may be left justified as appropriate; and\n\nstandard arrangements of ribbons by row(s) are illustrated in Figure 4-5.\n\nWhere a device such as a miniature cross, an oak leaf, a rosette or maple leaf, or a tour numeral is appropriate for wear on an undress ribbon, it shall be centred on the ribbon. Where there is more than one, they shall be evenly spaced across the ribbon with the senior device on the wearer’s right.\n\nDetailed Instructions. Undress ribbons shall be positioned in rows, centred immediately above the left breast pocket of authorized jackets and shirts.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nThis emblem (see A-DH-200-000/AG-000 The Heritage Structure of the Canadian Armed Forces) shall be worn by authorized personnel on both sleeves of the service dress and mess dress jackets, centred 6.5 cm below the shoulder seam. The insignia shall also be worn on both sleeves of the No. 3B short-sleeved shirts of authorized personnel, centred 6.5 cm below the shoulder seam. If both the Presidential Citation NAVY and ARMY are worn, the NAVY goes below the ARMY.\n\nMENTIONS-IN-DISPATCHES AND COMMENDATIONS\n\nMention-in-Dispatches (MID).
