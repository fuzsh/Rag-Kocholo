        "text": "Many institutions worldwide have developed their own jargon and terminology but I seriously doubt that any have contributed more to the English language than those emanating from the Navy and mariners in general.\n\nOf course the British, Royal Navy is the birthplace for much of it and Australia's Navy having its roots inextricably bound with the RN it naturally followed that we adopted them also.\n\nThe following comprehensive collection was provided by Geoff and Julie Baker who put this together for us.\n\nA B C D F G H I J K L M N O P R S T W Y\n\nNaval Nicknames\n\nALL FAIR AND ABOVE BOARD A commonly used expression of nautical origin meaning \"Utterly fair nothing hidden\". Things \"above board\" were on or above the upper deck and so open for all to see.\n\nACID Sailors slang for sarcasm - used in the phrase \"Dont come the old acid\"\n\nACKERS Naval slang name for any foreign currency. The word comes from Egypt, where beggars use it when pleading for baksheesh (Piastres).\n\nADRIFT This is the accepted Naval word for anyone or anything that cannot be found when it is wanted.\n\nA1 The accepted synonym for first-class. In Lloyds Register, A1 is the mark of a wooden ship of the first class, A referring to the quality of her hull and \"1\" to the quality of her equipment.\n\nALOFT This comes from the Anglo-Saxon word \"alofts\" meaning \"on high\".\n\nTO SWALLOW THE ANCHOR - To leave the Navy for good - implying that one has no further use for the implement one has for so long trusted.\n\nAVAST Avast! means Hold! Enough! Finish! It comes from the Italian word \"Basta\".\n\nAYE The derivation of this is generally thought to be unknown, but some experts think it may possibly come from the German \"Eiey!\" - an exclamation of astonishment or admiration.\n\nBACKING AND FILLING A common expression - of maritime origin - for constantly changing ground in a decision or argument.\n\nBAG MEAL A meal of sandwiches, etc. provided in a paper bag for a man who, because of his employment, will not be at his normal meal place (ashore or afloat) in time for his proper meal.\n\nBALE The verb to bale out, meaning to remove water, comes from the old name \"boyle\" for a bucket.\n\nBANYAN PARTY An old Naval name for a picnic party, especially nowadays by bus.\n\nThe word \"Banyan\" originates from the time when, as an economy, meat was not issued on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays: these days were called \"Banyan Days\" after a religious sect in the East which believed it wicked to eat meat. It became the custom for men to save up portions of their rations to tide them over these meatless days, and also to be sent ashore on those days to gather fruit. Meatless days were discontinued in 1884. A rare example of the good things in life being remembered better than the bad things!\n\nBEAR UP! A sailing expression, meaning to bear the tiller up to windward in order to keep the vessels head away from the wind. It is in common use, with the metaphorical meaning of \"Keep your spirits up!\"\n\nBECKET A piece of rope, each of whose ends is secured - e.g. rope handle of a wooden bucket. The \"slots\" on the top of a pair of trousers or on a raincoat through which a belt is passed are beckets. In Naval slang, Beckets mean pockets\n\nBELL-BOTTOMED TROUSERS The uniform trousers of a seaman of height about 5ft 10ins measure 25 inches round the bottom. It is said that the practice of making sailors trousers very full arose from the days when the men made their own clothes, when they found it easier and less wasteful of material to use the full width of the material. A bolt of serge in Britain has for years measured 54ins across. This, allowing to turn-ins, would just give the two trousers legs. That wide trousers legs were subsequently found to be easier to roll up when scrubbing decks is often given as the reason why trousers were made wide, but it seems that this was not the original reason.\n\nROUND THE BEND General Navy slang for \"half-witted\".\n\nTHE BILBOES Old Naval slang name for leg-irons (referred to in the phrase \"clapped him in irons\".\n\nBILGE OR BILGE WATER Common slang work of nautical origin for rubbish or nonsense. Bilge water is the water which collects in the bilges of a ship - if left, it soon acquires an offensive colour of corruption.\n\nBLACK-COATED WORKERS Common slang name for stewed prunes.\n\nBLEAT A Naval slang word for a grumble, used as both noun and verb.\n\nTO BLEED To bleed a buoy is to drain from it any water which may have got inside thus adversely affecting its buoyancy.\n\nTO BLEED THE MONKEY To extract rum from its barrel by boring a small hole in the barrel.\n\nTHE BIGGEST BLOCK IN THE SHIP is the butchers block (Old Naval catch question).\n\nTHE BLOKE Sailors slang for the Executive Officer, second in command of a ship.\n\nBLOOD BOAT Before the days when ships had large refrigerators, a duty cutter was sent ashore daily (usually in the early hours of the morning) to draw fresh meat. This boat, which often sailed or pulled many miles to complete the trip, was nicknamed the \"Blood Boat\" - later more generally known as the beef boat.\n\nBLOOD CHIT Naval slang name for the Indemnity Certificate required to be signed by a civilian before embarkation in a Service ship or aircraft.\n\nBLOOD MONEY An old Naval slang name for prize money.\n\nNELSONS BLOOD One of the slang names for rum. It originated from a story that the spirit (actually brandy) in the cases in which the body of Nelson was brought to this country after the battle of Trafalgar was tapped by the sentries keeping watch over it. This story is said to have appeared in the papers at that time and to have been officially denied.\n\nBLUE Soldiers slang name for a sailor.\n\nBLUERS An old Naval slang name for extra work - said to be a dim reference to the \"Blue\" Marines (Royal Marine Artillery) who were famous for hard work.\n\nBOATSWAIN (PRONOUNCED BOSUN) In sailing ships, the Boatswain was the officer responsible for the rigging, sails and sailing equipment. This responsibility still remains, although it is much smaller now than then. From the 11th Century, ships of the Buscarles were commanded by a Batsuen or Boatswain (i.e. the Boats Sweyne), who acted as Master and Steerman. The Bosun looks after the general working of the ship, especially with regard to anchors, cables, blocks and tackles. He takes his orders from all officers, more especially form the Commander. All ropes and hawsers are under his charge and he is responsible for seeing that boats falls (i.e. the ropes used for hoisting and lowering boats) are renewed every six months and changed end-for-end every three months. He is in charge of endless stores, such as rope, wire, wash-deck gear and canvas, and he examines and passes men for higher \"rating\".\n\nBOBBERY Slang word for any hubbub, from Pidgin English; probably from an Indian soldiers customary shrill outcry when disturbed.\n\nBOLLARD Metal or stone \"stumps\" around which ropes are belayed. The word comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for a tree. (One nowadays often hears reference to the bole of a tree).\n\nBONE Common (originally Naval) slang for to pilfer, steal or scrounge. The word comes from the name of a Boatswain in Admiral Cornwalliss Flag Ship, who was notorious for making good deficiencies in his stores by stealing from other ships. The Admiral is reported to have said to the Boatswain on one occasion: \"I trust, Mr. Bone, you will leave me with my anchors\".\n\nBOTH SHEETS AFT An old Naval phrase descriptive of a sailor with his hands in his pockets.\n\nBOW The word \"bow\" was Anglo-Saxon for shoulder.\n\nTO PART BRASS RAGS Naval ratings used to share bags in which polishing rags were kept. Thus, the friend with whom you shared a bag was your \"Raggie\" and, when you fell out, you parted brass rags with him.\n\nBRASS MONKEY WEATHER Slang expression for bitterly cold weather.\n\nBRASS HAT Slang name for the uniform cap worn by officers of Commanders rank and above; hence generically used to refer to such officers themselves.\n\nBROWN JOB Naval nickname for a soldier.\n\nTHE (CHIEF) BUFFER Naval nickname for the Chief Bosuns Mate. As he is the Executive Officers right-hand man and the one by whom he passes orders to the Captain of Tops, he is considered to be the buffer between officer and ratings.\n\nBULLOCK One of several Naval slang names for a Royal Marine. Reason adduced for this name is that Royal Marines are \"Big, beefy, brawny and brave\".\n\nBUN-WORRY (OR BUN-FIGHT) An old Naval officers slang name for a tea-party, with ladies, ashore.\n\nJIMMY BUNGS The old Naval nickname for the Cooper rating.\n\nBUM NUTS Naval Term for eggs\n\n.TO GO ROUND THE BUOY Naval slang for to come up (usually surreptitiously) for a second helping of food, especially in cafeteria messing.\n\nBURGOO Sailors slang name for porridge. Hence, a Surgoo-eater is a Scotsman.\n\nTO GO FOR A BURTON Old Naval slang expression to mean to fall all of a heap; to take a toss as, for example, when one trips over a rope or door-still when running at speed. The complete collapse of the victim is inherent in the phrase, not merely a stumble.\n\nCHINESE WEDDING CAKE Sailors slang name for rice pudding with currants or raisins in it.\n\nTO TAKE THE CAN BACK Common slang expression meaning to be blamed for the acts or faults of another. The expression may have arisen from the custom in some dockyards of employing a boy to fetch beer from a local public house; this boy was invariably blamed if accounts were unpaid or cans not returned.\n\nCANTEEN MEDALS Naval name for stains down the front of jumper, jacket or coat caused by food or drink.\n\nROOM TO SWING A CAT Common slang expression meaning the space required for any particular job. This does not refer to the domestic animal, but to the Naval cat-o-nine tails (The \"Cat\"). It has been suggested that this phrase came from the name - \"Cat\" - given to sailing colliers in the Middle Ages and up to the 18th Century. As these ships sailed in hundreds, there must have been great congestion when they anchored at Yarmouth Roads or Gravesend and swung to their anchors, so that the Master of a large craft would naturally condemn a tight anchor berth as \"not Big enough to swing a Cat in\". Perhaps Dick Whittingtons cat was really one of these boats!\n\nCAT IS OUT OF THE BAG Common slang expression, meaning \"The secret is out\". From the practice of keeping the Naval cat o nine tails in a red baize bag and not removing it until the offender was secured to the gratings and there was no possibility of a reprieve.\n\nTO CHAMFER UP To smarten up, make extra tidy or \"tiddly\". The expression comes from the shipwrights bench, where it means to take off the sharp edge of a piece of wood with a chisel.\n\nCHATTY An old Naval slang word for dirty, untidy. Most often met in the expression \"Happy and chatty\".\n\nCHEEKS An old nickname (now quite obsolete) for the Royal Marines, derived from the looping up of the tails of their coats.\n\nCHEER On all formal occasions, the Navy cheers HOORAY, not HURRAH, and the cheers are called for with three HIPS. On formal occasions (e.g. end of football match), two HIPS are normal, given by all the members of the team.\n\nTO CHEW THE FAT Naval slang expression for to talk volubly. It is possibly derived from the considerable jaw work involved in chewing the old-time ration meat before the days of refrigerators or canned meat.\n\nBEEF-CHIT Officers slang name for a menu card.\n\nCHOCK A BLOCK, CHOCKER Chock-a-block is an old Naval expression, meaning \"Complete\" or \"Full up\"; synonyms were \"Two blocks\" and \"Block and block\". It derives from the use of a hauling tackle - when the two blocks of the purchase were touching each other the lower one could obviously be hoisted no further, and so the work was completed. Modern slang has corrupted the expression to \"Chocker\", meaning \"Fed up\".\n\nCHUCK Naval slang for a demonstration of applause. Enthusiastic supporters of a ships football team or a regatta boats crew form a chucking-up party. The expression may originate from the practice of throwing hats in the air when excited. An early form of this word was CHUCKER UP\n\nCIVVY STREET Common slang expression meaning civilian life.\n\nCIVVIES Common slang name for non-uniform clothes.\n\nCLAKKER Old Naval slang name for the pastry top to a pie; synonyms are CLAGGER and AWNING.\n\nCLEAN INTO Navalese for to dress oneself in the rig ordered. Thus one used to get the anomalous order to Clean into coaling rig.\n\nCOW JUICE Naval slang for Milk.\n\nCOWBOY MEAL Sailors slang name for bacon and tomatoes. If onions and bubble n squeak are added, the meal is called \"Train Smash\"(Because it looks like a train wreck)\n\nDHOBEY Services slang name for Laundry - both the firm who does the work and the materials which are washed; from Hindustani. A Dhobey Firm is a man (or men) who do other mens laundry for them.\n\nDIG IN Common slang for \"Help yourself\" (to food)\n\nDIG OUT Common slang for \"Work hard\", \"Get down to it\".\n\nDOGSBODY Common slang name for someone of very little importance\n\nTHE DRINK Maritime slang name for the Sea. Synonyms are the Ditch, the Pond, and the Oggin.\n\nDUMMY RUN The naval name for a trial or practice in which all the motions are gone through but nothing else. E.g., in a gunnery dummy run all the motions of laying, setting, loading and firing are gone through meticulously but the gun is not actually fired. The expression is therefore freely used in the Navy to mean a rehearsal.\n\nFIGGY DUFF Naval name for any kind of steamed suet pudding, whether or not it contains figs.\n\nFAG END To fag is to separate or tease out the strands of a rope; thus the fag end is the extreme end. This expression has no original connection with cigarettes.\n\nA FACE LIKE A SEABOOT A nautical way of describing an expressionless face.\n\nFANNY ADAMS Miss Fanny (or Frances) Adams was a child aged 9 who was murdered at Alton, Hants on 24th April 1867. The murderer (Frederick Baker, a solicitors clerk aged 24) cut up the body into pieces some of which were said to have been found in Deptford Victualling yard. Baker was tried at Winchester and hanged in December 1867. At about this time tinned mutton was introduced into the Navy and somewhat naturally it soon acquired the name of Fanny Adams. The tins themselves were found very useful by the sailors as mess gear (there was no official issue of mess gear in those days) and to this day the name FANNY remains attached to the small round \"mess kettle\" (similar in appearance to a painters pot - also called a kettle).\n\nFISH A naval slang name for a torpedo: synonyms are MOULDY, TINFISH, KIPPER.\n\nFISHES EYES Sailors slang name for tapioca pudding.\n\nFISH-HEAD A Fleet Air Arm officers slang name for any non-flying naval officer.\n\nFISHING FLEET A naval slang collective name for unmarried ladies, who frequent the Ladies Lounge of the Union Club in Valletta, Malta (or other places where naval officers are much to be found ashore).\n\nFLAT ABACK The accepted naval way of describing a sailors cap jammed on the back of his head. It was a sailing ship expression said of square sails when the wind blew from right ahead.\n\nFORE AND AFTER Old officers slang name for the uniform cocked hat.\n\nTHE FOUL ANCHOR Commonly known as \"the seamans disgrace\", the foul anchor was the seal of the Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral in 1600; as Lord Howard of Effingham the Earl had been in command of the British forces which defeated the Spanish Armada in July 1588.\n\nGAMMIES Old sailors slang name for Raisins.\n\nGOFFER Naval name for a non-alcoholic drink such as lemonade; the place where goffers are sold is the Goffer Bar. Before the days of NAAFI soda fountains, goffers were often made and sold on board by authorised members of the ships company, known as the Goffer Firm. Sometimes erroneously spelt Gopher (from Genesis vi.14.).\n\nTHE GOLDEN RIVET An old mythological story was that one of the rivets in the lower parts of the ships hull was made of gold. The golden rivet is as fabulous as the Key of the Starboard watch and a Hammock ladder and, like them, has covered many a new entry with confusion. In other words, it didnt exist.\n\nGONG Common slang name for medals and decorations.\n\nGUMPERS Sailors slang for sentimental.\n\nHEADS Naval name for latrines - originally sited in the extreme bow - or head - of the ship.

When waves are supporting the bows and stern of a ship but not her amidships part (i.e., when the hull tends to assume a concave shape), the ship is said to be sagging: when the amidships part is supported but not the extremities (i.e., when the hull tends to become convex), the ship is said to be hogging.\n\nHOLIDAY Naval name for a gap, such as an area on a ships side left unpainted, or a space on a clothes line between pieces of linen hung out to dry.\n\nHUGGER OR HUGGER-MUGGER An old naval word meaning slovenly, confused, muddled.\n\nINSULT Naval slang name for the money paid to individuals on pay day (ratings are paid fortnightly).\n\nJAWBATIONAn old naval slang word for a reprimand, a telling off.\n\nJETTISON OR TO JETTISON To throw overboard.\n\nJEW OR JEWING Naval nickname for tailoring. This may have originated from the fact that tailoring is a popular profession among Jews, or \"J\" was substituted for \"S\".\n\nJEWING FIRM A sailor on board who in his spare time does tailoring for others.\n\nJEWING BAG or BUNDLE The bag in which a sailor keeps his sewing gear. Also called a HOUSEWIFE.\n\nJIB OR CUT OF HIS JIB A maritime phrase descriptive of a persons facial appearance.

So called because a real seaman can do without it.\n\nLURK OR TO LURK Originally, to lurk someone was to impose on his kindness to do something for you.

Synonyms are The Ditch, The Pond, The Drink, all three of which words are used by officers more often than Oggin.\n\nOYSTER OR BOMBAY OYSTER A old maritime name for a laxative draught consisting of a double dose of caster oil in a glass of milk; a more modern name for such a laxative would be \"elephant-rouser\".\n\nPRAIRIE-OYSTER A morning-after reviver composed of port wine, worcester sauce, red pepper, mustard and the unbroken yolk of an egg.\n\nBAGS ON PASSION Modern sailors slang name for mails from home\n\nPERKS Naval abbreviation of the word \"Perquisites\", referring to allowances, either in money or in kind, given with any particular office or appointment.\n\nTO POKE CHARLIE A common slang expression meaning to treat anyone or anything with derision - to make fun of.\n\nPOZZIE Old sailors slang name for Jam or Marmalade.\n\nPUSH OR TO PUSH THE BOAT OUT Old navel expression meaning to stand drinks all round.\n\nPUSSER The inevitable corruption of PURSER and/or PAYMASTER.\n\nPUSSER BUILT Naval slang description of an officer or rating who abides closely to the letter of the regulations.\n\nPUSSERS An adjective used to describe any article of service stores, especially clothing, to differentiate it from the similar article bought from civilian sources.\n\nPUSSERS CRABS Naval slang name for boots bought from the slop room.\n\nPUSSERS CRABFAT Naval slang name for Admiralty pattern grey paint.\n\nPUSSERS DIRK Slang name for the uniform clasp-knife, part of every seamans kit.\n\nPUSSERS TALLY Naval slang for a false name, such as may be given by a malefactor to the patrol or on other occasions when the concealment of a mans own name seems desirable.\n\nPUSSERS VINOLIA Naval slang name for soap, particularly for Admiralty pattern hard yellow soap.\n\nON THE PUTTY Naval slang expression for Aground.\n\nRABBITS Naval slang name given to articles taken, or intended to be taken, ashore privately. Originally \"rabbits\" were things taken ashore improperly (i.e. theft or smuggling - the name arose from the ease with which tobacco, etc., could be concealed in the inside of a dead rabbit) but with the passenger of time the application of the word has spread to anything taken ashore; an air of impropriety nevertheless still hangs over the use of the word, whether or not this is justified (it seldom is).

The other side of the ship was in consequence used for going alongside for embarking or disembarking cargo through the load-ports; the left hand side of the ship therefore became known as the \"Loadboard\" side, the \"Larboard\". As the use of this latter word inevitably caused confusion with the word Starboard, the word Port came to be used instead. By some authorities, the Venetians are given the credit for the origin of \"the word\" - board comes from the Italian Borda meaning side; the side with the steering oar was Questa borda: the other side was Quella boarda; these two expressions would rapidly become adapted into Starboard and Larboard.\n\nSTOP A GLASS RINGING ....
