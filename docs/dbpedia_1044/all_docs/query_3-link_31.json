        "text": "There is no lineage between the current (newly raised) 9th Regiment and any other units with the numeral '9'. Too many people are trying to re-write history by claiming that today's units are related to past units with the same numbers. A number of today's units have numbers are are similar to those of the past, but there is no lineage between them (I have a good mate whose son's name is Christopher - the same name as myself, however, I'm not in any way related to him even though we share the same name).\n\nAn example is as follows: In 1949 C Observation Troop was raised, and in 1952 it was re-designated as 4th Locating Troop; it was then renamed, in 1945, as 4th Locating Battery. In 1957 the sub-unit became a gun battery and its Battery Commander gave the new unit the title '101st Field Battery'. He later admitted that he gave it the number '101' for \" ... the lack of any sensible reason\". In other words, the new Battery was not declared to have any lineage to 101st Battery which took part in the battles of the Somme during The Great War.\n\nSo no, there's no lineage/connection between the current 9th Regiment and the former 9th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, nor is there any linage/connection between 16th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and any other unit with the numeral '16' (16 LAA Regt was formed in 1969 with the amalgamation of 110th and 11th Batteries when 110th Battery returned from Malay).\n\nThe term master gunner is somewhat confusing; it depends in what context it’s being used.\n\nIn the Royal Artillery the Master Gunner St James’ Park is the senior Gunner Officer in all Regimental duties serving directly under the Captain-General (The Sovereign). Although the responsibilities associated with the appointment do not extend formally to the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, the views and advice of the Master Gunner are still respected within the Australian Gunner community; the appointment is held by a field marshal or general. However, during the period 1770 â 1782 the position was occupied by an unnamed non-commissioned officer.\n\nToday the appointment is made by The Sovereign, on the recommendation of the serving and retired Colonels Commandant, and the incumbent is commonly referred to as the Master Gunner. Although the Master Gunner’s responsibilities do not formally extend to the other Regiments within the Commonwealth, the Regiments, including the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, accord the Office the due respect; this is highlighted by the position being accorded precedence on official occasions ahead of the Regiment’s Colonels Commandant.\n\nOriginally a master gunner was a civilian craftsman who made the cannon of his time, and his assistants were known as gunners. As the workings of these 14th and 15th centuries artillery pieces were beyond the understanding of the normal fighting soldier, these craftsmen and their assistants were also employed to serve the equipments in action. Hence the master gunner and the gunners found their places on the battlefields soon after introduction of artillery. They became the nucleus around which artillery trains for war were formed.\n\nIn January 1571 the establishment of the office of ‘Master Gunner of England’ saw the centralisation of these duties and responsibilities; he was the chief artilleryman for both war and peace. This appointment continued to exist until 1731. In 1678 a distinctly different post of ‘Master Gunner of Whitehall and St James’ Park’ was established. The responsibilities associated with this new appointment included the command of artillery detachments within the forts and redoubts on the eastern and southern coasts of Great Britain; as well as those at Whitehall and St James’ Park in London. His duties also involved the demolition of houses in London to prevent the spread of fire. As the stature of this appointment increased, the relevance of the ‘Master Gunner of England’ diminished until it ceased to exist in 1731.\n\nThe Whitehall artillery train was first raised in 1650 for the safety of Parliament, but was disbanded in 1660, although the guns remained there until 1723. During this period the responsibility for the disused equipments appears to have fallen to the ‘Master Gunner of England’. On the 1st December 1678 six cannons were placed in St James’ Park and in November 1679 a warrant was issued, on behalf of the King, backdating an allocation of monies to the 1st December 1678, for one Captain Silver to pay himself and the 11 gunners manning the cannons. This event establishes the first appointment of a Master Gunner of Whitehall. Depending on the warrant (the entry in State papers, or the entry in the Treasury books) the Master Gunner was sometimes referred to as of: ‘St James’ Park’, and on other occasions as ‘Whitehall’. As a consequence of the removal of the Whitehall cannons (sometime around 1723) the title of ‘Master Gunner of Whitehall and St James’ Park’ was amended to remove the reference to Whitehall. By 1742 the number of gunners working for the Master Gunner had been reduced to 8; this was properly due to the removal of the Whitehall cannons, and their duties included the firing of salutes for ceremonial occasions.\n\nBy the mid-18th century the Master Gunner had become very much involved in (Royal) Court duties. The office continued to be a paid position until 1914, with the death of the then Master Gunner, Field Marshal The Earl Roberts, who had received a payment of three shillings and sixpence a day (roughly 35 cents). The appointment is now commonly referred to as ‘The Master Gunner’, as it no longer has any specific association with St James’ Park, and is an honorary appointment.\n\nCertain warrant officers class one appointments within the Regiment are classified as master gunner. It could be said that these postings are very loosely ‘linked’ with the role of the master gunner of the 14th and 15th centuries, when “artillery pieces were beyond the understanding of the normal fighting soldier”. At the School of Artillery the Regimental Sergeant-Major is the senior warrant officer position, however, it is the role of the School’s Master Gunner to advise both the Commanding Officer/Chief Instructor and other instructors (commissioned officers/warrant officers/NCOs) on technical gunnery matters. Added to this it's also the title of the RAA’s senior warrant officer class one: the Regimental Master Gunner (RMG).\n\nThe role of the master gunners at the Army’s two Proof and Experimental Establishments (P&EE) is to also give technical advice on matters relating to the testing and proofing of equipments and munitions.\n\nThe use of the Cypher as a proofing stamp on British pieces goes back many hundreds of years and has nothing to do with the individual equipment as such. Yes, numbers were used to identify a particular piece, but not to indicate that it had been proofed.\n\nAll British made pieces have the Royal Cypher as a proofing stamp, but no equipments used within the Royal Artillery, that were manufactured overseas (e.g. the M110 - 8 inch SP howitzer and the M107 175mm SP gun) had the Cypher, yet these were very much a part of the Regiment's Colours. The exception to this was the L5 Pack Howitzer; these were bought from the Italians, however, Britain wasn't convinced about the initial testing procedures and, as a result, had the guns re-proofed when they arrived in the UK (hence the Cypher). The L5's that we had in the Royal Australian Artillery were purchased from Britain.\n\nThe guns that were manufactured here in Australia, during the Second World War, had the Cypher as a proofing stamp, but remember we were very British orientated in those days. The 40 mm Bofars anti-aircraft guns also had the Royal Cypher on the barrels but, whilst these were a Swedish designed equipment, those used by both Britain and Australia were manufactured in the UK.\n\nNeither the M2A2's or the current (155 mm) M198's have Cyphers on them, because they're US made pieces, yet when the M2A2s were in service they were our Colours and the M198s are the current Colours within 8th/12th Medium Regiment.\n\nThe current (Hamel) Light Gun is Australian made and they were proofed, but there is no physical indication of same. The reason behind placing the Australian Coat-of-Arms on the guns had nothing to do with them being the Colours (or being proofed); it was simply decided to do so to indicate that they were manufactured here in Australia and not the UK.\n\nFirstly with regard to the carrying of canes. The only ranks permitted to carry canes (‘swagger sticks’) are commissioned officers, warrant officers and senior NCOs; however, I know of a number of junior NCOs who carried canes. A number of these were instructors at the recruit training centres (ie. 1RTB and 2 RTB) â I was one of them, but officially they weren’t authorized to do so. I’ve never seen any photos of private ranks carrying canes and the ones you’ve seen could perhaps be of senior NCOs wearing their ranks on the right arm only (I’d be interested in seeing some of them, if that’s possible?).\n\nCanes were introduced as an item of commissioned rank equipment in the time of King Charles I (early 17th century) but were used for a much more serious purpose than they are today. At this time all junior officers were empowered to inflict punishment on the spot for minor offences. Misdemeanours such as sneezing in the ranks, spitting, or scratching one’s head earned immediate punishment to the tune of twelve strokes across the back.\n\nToday, in the majority of cases, officers carry a leather-covered cane, whilst the canes of warrant officers and senior NCOs are either wood or bamboo.\n\nSecondly, the stable belt. Stable Dress in the British Army was worn by both the cavalry and the Royal Artillery for stable duties. It was a simplified working dress with a cap and a loose fitting jacket and trousers (usually made out of a coarse material such as canvas). The Stable Belt was introduced as a practical item to keep up the trousers, and the buckles were worn over the left hip so as not to scratch and annoy the horse whilst being groomed.\n\nIn time the belt was adopted by other corps’ and developed into coloured stripes with regimental and corps patterns. It is thought that perhaps the coloured girdles worn before The Great War may have been the inspiration for the design. The belts became very popular in the British Army during the 1950s, as a colourful item of dress on what was then a very drab uniform.\n\nThe belt was adopted by the Australian Army in the late 1970s and, contrary to popular belief, they weren’t very popular, for a number of reasons. However, the RAA belt was the same design as that of the RA.\n\nThe belts went out of service in the Australian Army at the end of 1995 and no, the head of corps/regiment are not in the position to re-introduce them. It would be up to the Chief of Army on a recommendation from the Dress Committee and this is not going to happen.\n\nThe accepted civilian-attire equivalent to the military salute is, depending on the occasion, the doffing of one's headdress, the complete removal of the headdress, the right hand up across the heart, or the bowing of one's head.\n\nThere really isn't an origin as such to the hand over the heart 'salute'. The hand is placed over the heart (the salute isn't over the medals, it's just that medals are worn over the heart) because the heart is considered to be the life and soul of the body (the same as some people swear or promise with their hand over their heart).\n\nFOLLOW ON REPLY: If one is wearing a hat the hat is removed, as a salute, and placed over the heart. If you're not wearing headdress then the hand is placed over the heart in lieu (as you would do if you were wearing a hat).\n\nThe placing of headdress over the heart was in place long before The Great War; however, as time has moved-on, and less people wear hats, the hand (only) goes over the heart (the heart representing the life & sole of the person). The wearing of medals has nothing what-so-ever to do with the salute; if this were so, next-of-kin, who wear their relative's medals on the right, would salute with the left hand.\n\nIt is also said that medals are worn by the recipient on the left so that they are positioned over the heart.\n\nThe placing of headdress over the heart was in place long before The Great War (it can be traced back to the Roman Empire, were the salute was a clenched fist (of the right arm) over the heart); however, as time has moved-on, and less people wear hats, the hand (only) goes over the heart (the heart representing the life & sole of the person).\n\nFOLLOW ON REPLY (from Mr Jim Sprice): In London on Armistice Day 1920, during the ceremony to unveil and dedicate the Cenotaph in Whitehall, a funeral procession accompanying the remains of The Unknown Soldier, which had arrived from France the previous day, was to halt at the Cenotaph during the ceremony before proceeding to Westminster Abbey for internment.\n\nThe official party included the Empires senior soldiers, sailors and politicians and as many Victoria Cross recipients as could be assembled. The ceremony concluded with a march past.\n\nThe R.S.M of the Guards Regiment conducting the ceremony, faced with a gathering of highly decorated and high ranking military men (including V.C recipients), all wearing rows of medals, decreed that all would salute the Cenotaph as they marched past by placing their hand over their medals, signifying that \"NO MATTER WHAT HONOURS WE MAY HAVE BEEN AWARDED THEY ARE NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE HONOUR DUE TO THOSE WHO PAID THE SUPREME SACRIFICE\".\n\nThe RSL maintains that tradition to honour the dead by placing the right hand over medals (not our heart, our medals) during a march-past at a ceremonial occasion, or at a wreath laying ceremony.\n\nThe origin of the mess dinner goes back several hundred years and over this time many of the dinner customs have been modified according to individual regiments' own traditions and traits.\n\nThe origin of the word mess (itself derived from the Latin missus) goes back to France, where it was used to describe a serving of food, in a dish, for four people. In time it was used to describe a group of people who continually sat eating together at a table. Now it is the name used to describe the places where officers, and warrant officers and senior NCOs, eat and live.\n\nAt a formal dinner in the mess, when the meal has been served, the first person to eat is the Dining President; this custom dates back to the days of Queen Victoria when, at dinners given by Her Majesty, no one at the table would start to eat until she, the Hostess, did so. In those days, it was also the custom that everyone would cease eating when Her Majesty had\n\nfinished her meal; this presented some problems to those who were served later rather than earlier. The story told is that at one such dinner a certain distinguished gentleman, who had been on the receiving end of this etiquette once too often, removed himself from his seat, approached the Queen at the Top Table and, in no uncertain terms informed Her Majesty that\n\nhe had not yet finished his meal, was hungry, and intended to return to his seat and finish same. That part of the custom was from then on discontinued.\n\nThe custom of drinking the Sovereign's health (which, at dinners, is toasted after the meal is completed) originated during the exile of Charles II in France. His Royal Bodyguard toasted him with the words \"Here's a health unto His Majesty, confusion to his enemies and a safe return to reign over the\n\nKingdom of his forefathers\". Later, during the reign of the Hanoverian Georges, and with the threat of a Stuart restoration, the Duke of Cumberland, who was then Commander-In-Chief, ordered that the toast be always honoured. The Royal Australian Navy, carrying on the traditions of the Royal Navy, toast the Sovereign seated; this custom dates back to the days when there was little head room in the men-o'-war and standing up for the toast was both difficult and impractical.\n\nThere are many variations of passing the port, varying from corps to corps, and from unit to unit. There is though, no 'right' or laid-down way of passing the port, except it is always passed from right to left.\n\nThe Artillery colours are red, blue and gold. Gold has always been a part of the colours and the \"Records of the British Army\" lists the Regiment's colours as \".scarlet and blue, with gold cord\".\n\nThe original colours of the Regiment, when it was a part of the Board of Ordnance, were red and black (a red coat with black velvet trimming). In 1689 the Duke of Schomberg was appointed the Master-General of Ordnance by the Dutch-born King William III and he changed the gunners' coats to blue with orange trimmings (the colours of Holland). In time the King was forced to change the colours to sooth patriotic discontent within England; the red coat was re-introduced, but with blue facings and linings, and the breeches and waistcoat were blue too.\n\nLater the Army's coat's button-holes were strengthened with braid; the Infantry regiments used white braid and the gunners gold. In time the Infantry adopted the white for their chevrons and the gunners gold for their chevrons (it is also interesting to note that red and blue are considered to be the \"Royal colours\"). In the mid-1700s the gunners changed the colour of their coats from red to blue because it was found that the colour blue was more practical in hiding the stains caused by the flash and smoke of guns when they fired.\n\nThe supposed story of a colour in relation to cowardice (with gunners deserting their guns) is aliened to the white lanyard; it is often said, by ignorant bastards who know no better (in most cases the Infantry), that the gunners wear a white lanyard due to the (RA) gunners deserting their guns during the Battle of Colenso, in South Africa, in 1899. Firstly, and most importantly, the gunners did not desert their guns during the Battle; a large majority were either killed or seriously wounded whilst serving the guns (in one case a whole detachment was killed) and the guns were over-run whilst being served. The guns were later re-taken and the force that did so consisted of a good number of gunners. Secondly, the lanyard was initially worn by both the cavalry and the gunners, and its purpose was to hold a jack-knife, and it was white long before the South African War. The knife had a number of uses; the blade was for cutting-loose horses which became entangled in the head and heel ropes of the picket lines, and the spike was used as a hoof pick, for the removal of stones from horses' hooves. The gunners also attached a fuze key to the lanyard.\n\nThe lanyard was blanched white to match both the white bandolier and the white waist belt worn on the gunners' blue uniform. The lanyard was worn on the left shoulder with the knife (and fuze key) tucked into the left pocket; however, in 1920, because it was finally agreed that it was difficult to remove the knife from under the bandolier, the lanyard was moved to the right shoulder and in 1933 the practice of carrying the knife on the lanyard ceased (however, many Australian gunners still carry a clasp knife on a (brownish) lanyard in the field).\n\nIt is often stated that the red and gold (yellow) represent the flash of the gun firing and the blue the subsequent smoke; a nice 'story' but there's no substance to this fable.\n\nThe only mess-related traditions that the Gunners have are the Grace, the Loyal Toast and the toast to the Regiment.\n\nThe Gunners have a laid down Regimental Grace; \"For what we are about to receive. thank God\"\n\nAll the other corps' and regiments toast \"The Queen\", however, the Gunners toast \"The Queen, our Captain-General\" (the dining president taps the gavel and says \"Mr Vice, the Queen, our Captain-General\", Mr vice stands and calls the dinner to order by saying \"Gentlemen (Ladies and gentlemen)\". all stand\n\nand then Mr vice will say \"The Queen\"; all respond by saying \"The Queen\" - no other words are added, such as \"God bless Her\").\n\nThe toast to the Regiment starts with the dining president taping the gavel and saying \"Mr Vice, the Regiment\", Mr vice stands and again calls the dinner to order by saying \"Gentlemen (Ladies and gentlemen)\". all stand and then Mr vice will say \"The Royal Regiment\", all respond by saying \"The Royal\n\nRegiment\").\n\nThere is NO Gunner tradition with regard to the passing of the port, As with all messes the port is passed to the left, starting with the dinning president and Mr vice (who, initially, only half-fill their glasses - they top-up their glasses on the return of the decanters; the stoppers are not replaced until such time as the dinning president decides that no more port is to be circulated and poured. There is NO tradition within Gunner messes with regard to the decanter touching the table - it is accepted and allowed that the decanters may touch the table during their rounds."
