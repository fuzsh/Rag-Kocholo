        "text": "RAN Reserve: This is a 1/6th representation of the RANR’s badge. This Australian made, 3 dimensional custom crafted product, is hand painted using marine enamels and complies with the Royal Australian Navy colour specification. The badge is cast using a two-pack polyurethane media and is extremely durable.\n\nIt is most often mounted on a Navy Board (Std) or Navy Board – (3 point shield) shaped timber board, stained in rich walnut with a high gloss finish. There is a keyway routed into the back of the board for wall/bulkhead mounting.\n\nVariations in mounting can be arranged by emailing us direct."
