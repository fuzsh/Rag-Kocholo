        "text": "Today, the 1st Commando Regiment contains some of the most skilled, dedicated, and combat-experienced soldiers in the Army.\n\nOver the past decade, combat operations and the evolution of the commando trade model have changed the character of the 1st Commando Regiment. Due to this, the Regiment has grown from a unit with a limited operational utility to one built on a core of highly skilled individuals able to integrate into regular army special operations with little notice.\n\nAs a result, the Regiment is being increasingly relied upon to supplement the efforts of regular Army special forces counterparts on both operations and in training.\n\nThe Regiment is an integrated unit comprising a high number of regular (full-time) soldiers, ex-regular and reserve (part-time) soldiers, who are all required to meet the same rigorous standards of a regular commando.\n\nThe provision of high-quality, competent and current individual Commandos to round out and reinforce the 2nd Commando Regiment is the main focus for the Regiment, with much of its effort and resources dedicated to this task.\n\nRaised in 1955, the Regiment has grown from two independent commando companies in Sydney and Melbourne to a commando signals squadron and finally a regimental headquarters in 1981.\n\nIn recent years the Regiment has become more frequently deployed on operations providing small detachments and individuals to Bougainville, East Timor, the Solomon Islands, and Iraq, and company-sized combat elements to Afghanistan.\n\nThe Sherwood Green Commando beret is worn as the primary form of headdress, a formally recognising Commando qualification. The Sherwood Green beret was adopted due to its close association with the British Army and Marine Commandos of WWII.\n\nThe regimental badge features a silver WWII-era Australian fighting knife surmounted by a gold boomerang bearing the regimental motto Strike Swiftly.\n\nThe Regiment’s history stems from the decision in 1996 to convert 4 RAR, a light infantry battalion, into a Commando Regiment. On 1st February 1997, 4 RAR was renamed and re-roled as 4 RAR and commenced the development of Australia’s first regular Commando capability.\n\nThis development was conducted through a period of continuous operational taskings with collective deployments to the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. Throughout these operations, the Regiment served with distinction, notably receiving the Unit Citation for Gallantry for its service as a part of the Special Operations Task Group in 2005-2006.\n\nThe Regiment’s new badge was created to reflect the history and traditions of Australian Commandos and the offensive nature of the unit. The central feature of the badge is a silver Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, universally recognised as the symbol of a Special Forces unit, and is backed by the blackened double diamonds, representative of the felt colour patches worn on Australian Commando uniforms of WWII.\n\nThe Regiment’s motto is included in a gold scroll, Foras Admonitio, a Latin phrase translating to “Without Warning”. The motto highlights not only the challenges of modern warfare, but the modus operandi of the Regiment.\n\nThe Regiment lost more soldiers while deployed in Afghanistan than any other unit of the Australian Defence Force. The Regiment is also actively supporting the recovery of a significant number of soldiers who have been seriously wounded in battle or injured on operations and in training.\n\nSome of these soldiers will never return to full duty as Commandos. Support for the families of the fallen and wounded and their families is a priority of the Regiment.\n\nFor the 2nd Commando Regiment, the Commando Welfare Trust is a key enabler in ensuring the continued support of members and their families. On joining the 2nd Commando Regiment, a soldier and his family become Commandos for life.\n\nSOTECs role is to ensure the ongoing provision of high-calibre, trained individuals to Commandos and SAS to enable continuous elite military capabilities.\n\nDSOTEC was established by Lieutenant General Rick Burr, AO, DSC, MVO, Chief of the Australian Army, on behalf of the Chief of the Defence Force during a ceremony at Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney, on Tuesday, 19th November 2019.\n\nDSOTEC was reorganised from the Special Operations Training & Education Centre, which was established on 1 September 2017 from the Special Forces Training Centre (SFTC). SFTC was established at Lone Pine Barracks, Singleton, New South Wales, on 1st December 1998 in response to a mid-1990s review to enhance and reinvigorate Australia’s special operations capabilities.\n\nQuality people form the bedrock of Australian Special Operations capability. As such, the task of attracting, selecting and training physically and mentally robust individuals to provide the next generation of Special Forces operators is an essential precursor to the delivery of this collective capability to the battlefield.\n\nPhysical toughness is an important attribute. However, it is only one of a myriad of components the Special Forces operator must possess. Judgement, decisiveness, mental dexterity, leadership, innovation and humility are all core elements required by Special Forces soldiers and officers alike.\n\nThese attributes will be thoroughly exposed, observed, reviewed and assessed to ensure each individual that is selected for service within Special Forces can meet the high standards that are expected of them..\n\nThe SOCOMD catch-cry of service with operational focus is a foundational emphasis throughout recruitment, selection and training, and only those with absolute dedication will last the process.\n\nThe gravity and responsibility entailed in this commitment are evident in the fact that newly qualified members may find themselves on intense combat operations within a few months of completing reinforcement training. Upon completion of Special Forces selection, training, and operations, successful Special Forces soldiers will realise why their beret commands the respect it does.\n\nThe school is based adjacent to HMAS Albatross, Nowra, New South Wales.\n\nThe first military parachute training unit in Australia was the Paratroop Training Unit (PTU), formed at Laverton in Victoria on 3rd November 1942. On 16 November 1942, PTU was relocated to Tocumwal in New South Wales.\n\nPTU was subsequently transferred to RAAF Base Richmond on 6th April 1943 until it was disbanded at the end of WWII in 1945. Parachute Training School (PTS) was formed in 1951 as Parachute Training Wing as a RAAF unit at RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales.\n\nThe first course of trainees commenced in September 1951 with instructors from both the Army and the RAAF. The Army assumed responsibility for parachute training on 14th May 1974, with the school being renamed Parachute Training School. The school relocated to Naval Air Station HMAS Albatross in 1986 and remained there to this day.\n\nIn 2011 the School became a Special Operations Command unit where Special Forces and support role paratroopers are trained in various forms of airborne capability, evaluation and testing of personnel parachute systems and associated equipment are carried out.\n\nAll personnel parachute systems are repacked and repaired organically by the Parachute Maintenance Wing.\n\nThe unit was renamed the Special Operations Logistic Squadron in 2006.\n\nSOLS is a Squadron sized element of logisticians responsible for providing diverse logistic support to SOCOMD in all theatres of operations around the world. SOLS is the only independent logistic Squadron within SOCOMD and the only independent logistic Squadron within the Australian Army.\n\nLogisticians within SOLS must be able to conduct their role in arduous conditions, remote locations, and in isolated and hostile settings. This requires the members to have a maturity greater than that of a soldier in the wider Army and to have a tolerance of ambiguity not expected within the regular soldier.\n\nSOLS aims to employ volunteers who are selected for their trade competency and their ability to encapsulate a culture that supports exceptional performance. Although a relatively new organisation, SOLS is proud of its short history, built by high-calibre people and is continually striving to provide the most effective and innovative logistic support to its dependent units."
