        "text": "This article lists the ranks of officers and enlisted personnel in the Australian Defence Force's (ADF) three service branches.\n\nThe ADF comprises the:\n\nRoyal Australian Navy (RAN)\n\nAustralian Army\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force (RAAF)\n\nThe three Australian services inherited their rank structures from their British counterparts. The insignia used to identify these ranks are also generally similar to those used in the British Armed Forces.\n\nThe following tables show the \"equivalent rank and classifications\" for the three services, as defined in PACMAN, ADF Pay and Conditions Manual, Vol.2, Chap.1, Part.4, pg.1, sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, Edition AL13 (November 2009), People Strategies and Policy, Australian Department of Defence.[1] \"Equivalent rank\" means the corresponding rank set out under Regulation 8 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952.[2]\n\nCommissioned Officer ranks[]\n\nReferences:[1][3]\n\nNATO\n\nCode Aus/US\n\nCode Navy Army RAAF Flag/General/Air Officers OF-10 O-11[4] Admiral of the fleet Field marshal Marshal of the\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force OF-9 O-10[5] Admiral General Air chief marshal OF-8 O-9[6] Vice admiral Lieutenant general Air marshal OF-7 O-8 Rear admiral Major general Air vice marshal OF-6 O-7[7] Commodore — Air commodore Senior officers OF-6 O-7[7] — Brigadier — OF-5 O-6[7] Captain (RAN) Colonel Group captain OF-4 O-5[7] Commander Lieutenant colonel Wing commander OF-3 O-4[7] Lieutenant commander Major Squadron leader Junior officers OF-2 O-3[7] Lieutenant Captain (Army) Flight lieutenant OF-1 O-2 Sub lieutenant Lieutenant Flying officer OF-1 O-1 Acting sub lieutenant Second lieutenant Pilot officer Cadets — — Midshipman Officer cadet Officer cadet\n\nWarrant Officer ranks[]\n\nNATO\n\nCode Aus/US\n\nCode Navy Army RAAF Warrant officers OR-9 E-9 Warrant officer Warrant officer Warrant officer Warrant officer class 1 OR-8 E-8 — Warrant officer class 2 —\n\nNote that the most senior warrant officer in each of the three services is appointed either Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N), Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), or Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF), as appropriate. These are appointments, not ranks; these three people hold the rank of Warrant Officer in their respective services. However, they each wear special insignia, different to the rank insignia worn by other warrant officers. Although the RAN and the RAAF have the one warrant officer rank, the army has three. The soldier appointed Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) holds the unique Army rank of warrant officer (introduced in 1991 and senior to WO1). The Army rank of WO2 is the same pay grade as the RAN and the RAAF's most senior NCOs, (i.e. chief petty officer and flight sergeant).[1]\n\nNon-commissioned officer ranks[]\n\nNATO\n\nCode Aus/US\n\nCode NAVY ARMY RAAF Senior non-commissioned officers OR-8 E-8 Chief petty officer — Flight sergeant OR-7 E-7 — Staff sergeant[1][8] — OR-6 E-6 Petty officer Sergeant Sergeant Junior non-commissioned officers OR-4 E-5 Leading seaman Corporal/bombardier Corporal OR-3 E-4 — Lance corporal/\n\nLance bombardier —\n\nEnlisted ranks[]\n\nNATO\n\nCode Aus/US\n\nCode Navy Army RAAF Enlisted OR-3 E-3 Able seaman Private proficient[1][9] Leading aircraftman/woman OR-2 E-2 Seaman Private Aircraftman/woman\n\nSee Australian Army enlisted rank insignia for ranks used by some Corps in place of private.\n\nSee also[]\n\nRoyal Australian Navy ranks and uniforms\n\nAustralian Army officer rank insignia\n\nAustralian Army enlisted rank insignia\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force (RAAF) rank insignia\n\nReferences and notes[]\n\n[]\n\nADF Badges of rank (copyright)\n\nPage Template:Hlist/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").Page Module:Navbar/styles.css has no content.
