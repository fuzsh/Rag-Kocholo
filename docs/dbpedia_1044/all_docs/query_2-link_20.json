        "text": "Use terminology correctly\n\nUse the term ‘Defence’ when you mean both the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). ‘Defence’ is used to represent the organisation as a whole.\n\n‘Defence’ has an initial capital when it is part of a formal name or title. Use lower case for generic references.\n\nUse ‘Australian Defence Force’ and ‘ADF’ when referring to the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, commanded by the Chief of the Defence Force.\n\nUse ‘Department of Defence’ when referring to the department, headed by the Secretary of the Department of Defence.\n\nFollow the order of precedence for the 3 arms of the ADF\n\nThere are 3 arms of the ADF, known collectively as the ‘services’ (‘Services’ inside Defence). When referring to the services, follow the order of precedence established by the Defence Act 1903:\n\nRoyal Australian Navy\n\nAustralian Army\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force.\n\nAlways use initial capitals when writing the short names of the services:\n\nNavy\n\nArmy\n\nAir Force.\n\nAddress members of the ADF by rank, name and post-nominals\n\nUse the following order to address members of the ADF:\n\nrank\n\ngiven name or initials\n\nfamily name\n\npost-nominals\n\nservice (for commissioned officers in the Navy only).\n\nDo this:\n\nthe first time you write their name in body text\n\nin address blocks in correspondence\n\nwhen introducing an ADF member as speaker\n\nin official records of proceedings\n\nin lists in organisational publications such as annual reports.\n\nADF ranks are listed in the table ‘Ranks and salutations’.\n\nIf you mention the name again in body text, use rank and family name.\n\nOnly one rank has a hyphen\n\nWrite military ranks of more than one word as separate words. Do not hyphenate the rank.\n\nThere is one exception from the Air Force: Air Vice-Marshal. It is always hyphenated.\n\nPost-nominals\n\nPost-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and military awards and honours.\n\nWrite post-nominals after the family name. Place post-nominals before the shortened form showing service (‘RAN’).\n\nMake sure you write post-nominals in the right order.\n\nDon’t use commas before or between post-nominals.\n\nUse ‘RAN’ to indicate Navy service for commissioned officers\n\nUse ‘RAN’ (Royal Australian Navy) for all commissioned officers of the Navy. Place ‘RAN’ after the family name and any post-nominals.\n\nDon’t use an acronym to show service for officers in the Army or Air Force.\n\nIn Defence, ‘RAN’ is used to distinguish naval officers from officers in the other services and from naval officers in other countries.\n\nGazettal notices of Australian awards and honours follow this style. For consistency, the Style Manual recommends that Australian Government organisations also follow this practice.\n\nWrite the rank before the title of ADF members who are knighted\n\nWhen someone has a military rank and another title such as ‘Sir’, ‘Dame’ or ‘the Honourable’, place the military rank first.\n\nAddress chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers by title\n\nArmy and Air Force chaplains wear military rank.\n\nNavy chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers (MSWOs) do not wear military rank. Instead, they wear chaplaincy or MWSO insignia and a service badge with the symbol of their faith or purpose. This gives them ‘floating rank’, meaning they take on the rank of the person they are talking to.\n\nAddress chaplains with their chaplaincy title, not a military rank.\n\nMSWOs have been part of the Navy since 2020. Address them with their MSWO title, not a military rank.\n\nInclude any post-nominals.\n\nThe chaplaincy titles are:\n\nPrincipal Chaplain (Navy and Army) and Principal Air Chaplain (Air Force)\n\nSenior Chaplain (Navy) and Chaplain (Navy, Army and Air Force).\n\nThe MSWO titles include:\n\nPrincipal Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer\n\nSenior Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer\n\nMaritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer.\n\nAddress retired officers of the ADF by rank\n\nCommissioned officers who retire can continue to use their military rank. When writing their name, use their rank and include ‘(Retd)’ after any post-nominals.\n\nAvoid using the shortened forms of ranks\n\nFor internal Defence use, it is common to write the ranks in abbreviated form using capital letters.\n\nDon’t follow this convention in other types of content. Write the full rank with an initial capital letter.\n\nAddress members of the ADF correctly in emails and letters\n\nThe style rule for address blocks applies to all members of the ADF.\n\nThe style rule for salutations changes with rank.\n\nAddress blocks\n\nTo write an address block, follow all preceding rules on this page.\n\nThe style of address blocks is the same for all ranks.\n\nrank\n\ngiven name or initials\n\nfamily name\n\npost-nominals\n\n‘RAN’ for commissioned officers in the Navy\n\n‘(Retd)’for retired commissioned officers who retain rank\n\npostal address.\n\nSalutations\n\nThe Style Manual follows the ADF’s style for salutations.\n\nThe style of salutations depends on rank.\n\nDon’t include post-nominals in salutations.\n\nNever add a comma after salutations.\n\nCommissioned officer ranks\n\nRule: Dear [Rank]\n\nUse the rule for these ranks:\n\nAdmiral, Rear Admiral, Commodore and Captain (Navy)\n\nGeneral, Lieutenant General, Major General, Brigadier and Colonel (Army)\n\nAir Chief Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Commodore and Group Captain (Air Force).\n\nRule: Dear [Rank Family name]\n\nUse the rule for these ranks:\n\nCommander, Lieutenant Commander and Lieutenant (Navy)\n\nLieutenant Colonel, Major and Captain (Army)\n\nWing Commander, Squadron Leader and Flight Lieutenant (Air Force).\n\nRule: Dear [Honorific Family name]\n\nUse the rule for these ranks:\n\nSub Lieutenant, Acting Sub Lieutenant and Midshipman (Navy)\n\nLieutenant, Second Lieutenant and Officer Cadet (Army)\n\nFlying Officer, Pilot Officer and Officer Cadet (Air Force).\n\nADF style is to use a conventional title before the family name for these ranks.\n\nUse the honorifics ‘Ms’, ‘Mr’, ‘Mx’, ‘Mrs’ or ‘Dr’ when it is possible to identify the appropriate title. If this is difficult, follow the ‘Dear [Rank Family name]' rule.\n\nOther ranks\n\nRule: Dear [Rank Family name]\n\nUse the rule for ranks from:\n\nWarrant Officer of the Navy to Recruit (Navy)\n\nRegimental Sergeant Major of the Army to Recruit (Army)\n\nWarrant officer of the Air Force to Aircraftman/Aircraftwoman (Air Force).\n\nChaplains and MSWOs\n\nSalutations for ADF chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers do not change with rank.\n\nRule: Dear [Chaplaincy title]\n\nRule: Dear [MSWO title]\n\nOther examples appear in the table that follows.\n\nRanks and salutations (in order of precedence)\n\nAppointed by Governor-General of AustraliaNavyArmyAir ForceSalutation ruleSalutation exampleAdmiral of the FleetField MarshalMarshal of the Royal Australian Air ForceNo current appointmentsNo current appointments\n\nCommissioned officer ranksNavyArmyAir ForceSalutation ruleSalutation exampleAdmiral (when Chief of the Defence Force)General (when Chief of the Defence Force)Air Chief Marshal (when Chief of the Defence Force)Dear [Rank]Dear AdmiralVice AdmiralLieutenant GeneralAir MarshalDear [Rank]Dear Lieutenant GeneralRear AdmiralMajor GeneralAir Vice-MarshalDear [Rank]Dear Air Vice-MarshalCommodoreBrigadierAir CommodoreDear [Rank]Dear CommodoreCaptainColonelGroup CaptainDear [Rank]Dear ColonelCommanderLieutenant ColonelWing CommanderDear [Rank Family name]Dear Wing Commander SmithLieutenant CommanderMajorSquadron LeaderDear [Rank Family name]Dear Lieutenant Commander MaboLieutenantCaptainFlight LieutenantDear [Rank Family name]Dear Captain TatipataSub LieutenantLieutenantFlying OfficerDear [Ms/Mr/Mx/Mrs/Dr Family name] *Dear Ms RossiActing Sub LieutenantSecond LieutenantPilot OfficerDear [Ms/Mr/Mx/Mrs/Dr Family name] *Dear Mr MüllerMidshipmanOfficer CadetOfficer CadetDear [Ms/Mr/Mx/Mrs/Dr Family name] *Dear Dr Wong\n\n* If it's difficult to establish the person's preferred honorific, use the rule ‘Dear [Rank Family name]'.\n\nOther ranks including warrant officers and non-commissioned officersNavyArmyAir ForceSalutation ruleSalutation exampleWarrant Officer of the NavyRegimental Sergeant Major of the ArmyWarrant Officer of the Air ForceDear [Rank Family name]Dear Warrant Officer PatelWarrant OfficerWarrant Officer Class 1Warrant OfficerDear [Rank Family name]Dear Warrant Officer Pappas (for all 3 ranks)Chief Petty OfficerWarrant Officer Class 2Flight SergeantDear [Rank Family name]Dear Warrant Officer Wikilyirin/aStaff Sergeantn/aDear [Rank Family name]Dear Staff Sergeant IvanovPetty OfficerSergeantSergeantDear [Rank Family name]Dear Sergeant AnderssonLeading SeamanCorporalCorporalDear [Rank Family name]Dear Leading Seaman Setiawann/aLance Corporaln/aDear [Rank Family name]Dear Lance Corporal LimAble Seamann/a\n\nLeading Aircraftman\n\nLeading Aircraftwoman\n\nDear [Rank Family name]Dear Leading Aircraftman JohnsonSeamanPrivate\n\nAircraftwoman\n\nAircraftman\n\nDear [Rank Family name]Dear Aircraftwoman GarciaTraineeTraineeTraineeDear [Rank Family name]Dear Trainee FerranRecruitRecruit\n\nAircraftwoman Recruit\n\nAircraftman Recruit\n\nDear [Rank Family name]\n\nDear Recruit Rarru\n\nDear Aircraftman Recruit De Jong\n\nChaplainsNavyArmyAir ForceSalutation ruleSalutation example\n\nPrincipal Chaplain\n\nSenior Chaplain\n\nPrincipal Chaplain\n\nChaplain\n\nPrincipal Air Chaplain\n\nChaplain\n\nDear [Chaplaincy title]Dear Chaplain Pope"
