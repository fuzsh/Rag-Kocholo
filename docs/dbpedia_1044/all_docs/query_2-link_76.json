        "text": "It is a ritual that has been repeated at many funerals of Navy SEALs and dramatized in Hollywood movies: SEALs approach a gravesite one by one, remove the gold-colored pin from the left breast of their dress uniforms and pound them into the coffin of a fallen comrade. The living mourn, with the primary symbol of their brotherhood missing, to be replaced only after the dead have been buried.\n\nThe dead take their comrades’ SEAL pins with them to the grave.\n\nThe pin is the most tangible sign of membership in a famously exclusive community: an eagle perched on a horizontal three-pronged trident, clutching a flintlock pistol, with an upright anchor nestled in the mix. They are symbols of the domains that comprise the SEAL acronym: Sea, Air and Land.\n\nAnd to show the SEALs’ readiness to fight, the pistol’s hammer is cocked back, ready to fire.\n\nThis week, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher was in danger of losing his.\n\nNot as in physically losing it; replacements can be bought online for a mere $13.50. Rather, Chief Gallagher, a SEAL who was court-martialed this summer for his actions in Iraq and cleared of all but one charge, was likely going to lose the right to wear one at all."
