This article lists the ranks of officers and enlisted personnel in the Australian Defence Force's (ADF) three service branches.

The ADF comprises the:

Royal Australian Navy (RAN)

Australian Army

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)

The three Australian services inherited their rank structures from their British counterparts. The insignia used to identify these ranks are also generally similar to those used in the British Armed Forces.

The following tables show the "equivalent rank and classifications" for the three services, as defined in PACMAN, ADF Pay and Conditions Manual, Vol.2, Chap.1, Part.4, pg.1, sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, Edition AL13 (November 2009), People Strategies and Policy, Australian Department of Defence.[1] "Equivalent rank" means the corresponding rank set out under Regulation 8 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952.[2]

Note that the most senior warrant officer in each of the three services is appointed either Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N), Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), or Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF), as appropriate. These are appointments, not ranks; these three people hold the rank of Warrant Officer in their respective services. However, they each wear special insignia, different to the rank insignia worn by other warrant officers. Although the RAN and the RAAF have the one warrant officer rank, the army has three. The soldier appointed Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) holds the unique Army rank of warrant officer (introduced in 1991 and senior to WO1). The Army rank of WO2 is the same pay grade as the RAN and the RAAF's most senior NCOs, (i.e. chief petty officer and flight sergeant).[1]
