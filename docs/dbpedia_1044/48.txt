The Australian Navy Cadets is a youth development program established by the Royal Australian Navy. It is an organisation providing young people with the opportunity to develop leadership and teamwork skills, physical training, and an appreciation of Australia's maritime heritage.

The program strives to enhance the resilience and character of its participants while encouraging them to be active members in their local community. Through the Navy Cadets program, participants have the opportunity to learn and experience a wide range of activities such as sailing, seamanship and navigation, marine engineering, communication and signalling, ceremonial drill and music, military knowledge, and lifesaving.
