        "text": "DOORS @ 6:30PM / SHOW @ 7PM\n\nSTAGE AREA : $25 reserved seating\n\nBAR AREA: $15 reserved seating\n\n*No refund or exchanges *Tickets can be transferred to another person *Unclaimed seats 15 minutes after start time will be open to walk-ins*\n\nTiago do Bandolim is one of the great revelations on bandolim (mandolin) and violão tenor (tenor guitar) in modern Brazil. Influenced by two great icons of Brazilian bandolim, Ronaldo do Bandolim (Tiago’s father) and Jacob do Bandolim, Tiago has been rising to the top as part of a great generation of musicians created in the 2000s in Lapa, Rio de Janeiro—a generation that has mixed traditional choro with the more modern languages of MPB, Latin music, and jazz. Tiago has participated in numerous samba and choro albums as well as the DVDs Brasileirinho, a documentary about choro in Rio de Janeiro, “Histórias de um João de Barro” with Bia Bedran and “Geração Semente.” He has been performing in choro festivals alongside the biggest names of the genre and in presentations in Europe and the USA with the samba groups Unha de Gato, Pé de Moleque, and Semente Choro-Jazz. In 2017, he released his first solo album “De Soslaio” featuring his many influences within choro. In 2018, he formed the big band Choro na Rua, which continues to play some of the most publicized shows in the home of choro, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, 7-string guitarist, composer, and arranger Rogério Souza is one of the great representatives of the carioca language of the Brazilian guitar. He has been involved in the largest events related to MPB (Brazilian popular music), mainly in choro and samba. He’s worked with great Brazilian musicians, including Baden Powell, Paulinho da Viola, Sivuca, Altamiro Carrilho, Paulo Moura, João Bosco, Ivan Lins, Zé Menezes, Guinga, Turíbio Santos, Rafael Rabello, Cristóvão Bastos, Proveta, Ronaldo do Bandolim, Zé da Velha, groups Nó em Pingo D’agua and Grupo Época de Ouro, among others. He’s played in festivals, cultural spaces, and music universities and schools in various corners of the world such as Japan, China, USA, holding concerts and workshops every year at several universities in the USA such as Oberlin, Berklee College of Music, Yale, University of Virginia, JMU, Georgetown, Columbia, Temple, University of Chicago, Notre Dame, SF University, University of California (LA), University of Texas (Valle del Rio Grande), among others. He is currently dedicated to his solo work, giving presentations and workshops on the dissemination of MPB and his latest works on CDs/Books.\n\nThanks for supporting PAUSA art house, our musicians and live music in Buffalo. \"Life is better with friends\""
