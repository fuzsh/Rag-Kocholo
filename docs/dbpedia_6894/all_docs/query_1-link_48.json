        "text": "The Bardis’ museological project\n\nTo better understand the context in which the expographic production of Lina Bo Bardi emerges and how it inscribed in the museological field in the second half of the twentieth century, it is necessary to go back to the 1940s, when the architect left Italy with her husband, the journalist and art dealer Pietro Maria Bardi (1900–1999). Differing in their political views but tied by an unexpected affinity in their visions of art and architecture—Pietro being inclined to fascism in his youth, while Lina Bo had her practice strongly marked by communist ideals—the couple landed in Brazil in 1946 to present an exhibition of ancient Italian painting at the Ministry of Education and Health (Rio de Janeiro). Soon they came to the attention of communications tycoon Assis Chateaubriand, who intended to found a new museum of ancient and modern art. Chatô, as he was known, invited Bardi to devise and direct the museum, who chose to do it in close dialogue with his wife, Lina Bo.[4]\n\nThe first version of the museum was inaugurated in 1947, and it was named by Pietro Maria Bardi as the Museu de Arte de São Paulo, an art museum tout court, without any reference to the content of its collection. This choice was based on the refusal of any artistic classification—such as modern or ancient—that would restrict or chronologically categorize what was shown at the venue. Occupying the second floor of a commercial building located in the city center, the MASP Sete de Abril, as it became known, opened its doors with a comprehensive program that featured practical and theoretical courses, as well as temporary and permanent exhibitions showcasing its collection of European art.[5]\n\nFinanced by donations from the local aristocracy, MASP’s permanent collection was initially formed by Italian Renaissance pieces. In the 1950s it came to integrate works by acclaimed European painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Jean-August Renoir, as well as Brazilian modernists, including Anita Malfatti, Di Cavalcanti, and Vicente do Rego Monteiro, among others.[6] Its impressive growth was not only fostered by the prices of artworks during the postwar period, but especially also by Bardi’s expertise in the international art market and Chateaubriand’s negotiation skills. Their efforts respond to a clear desire to place the museum as the holder of the “most comprehensive” collection of Western art in Latin America—a label that has been continuously restated by the institution until today.[7]\n\nIt is worth noting that the context in which the collection was formed corresponds to a moment of economic growth in Brazil, driven by industrialization and radical changes in the composition of its population, which in turn became increasingly urban. Under the developmentalist agenda of President Juscelino Kubitschek, the 1950s witnessed the construction of Brasília and the emergence of the modernism of Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa. While the museological project of the MASP was inscribed in this context, it also encompassed the discussions about the new functions of museums in the postwar era carried out by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and its Museum journal between 1940 and 1950. Under these circumstances, museums as places of memory represented not only a key institutional setting for the reconstruction of cities, but also the new urban models that emerged then.\n\nTo begin with, what was the status of museums when the war ended? How did this long interruption affect them? … Museums were no longer merely places of conservation but very active establishments which, through their educational programs and exhibitions displaying objects in their re-created contexts, ensured that they played a role in everyday life, whereas before, they existed primarily in the context of the past.[8]\n\nThe emphasis on the educational function of the museum was a critical matter at the time. Contemplated by the MASP project, these issues were reviewed by Pietro Maria Bardi in a series of reports about his experience as the institution’s director, including L’experience didactique du Museu de Arte de São Paulo (1948) and Musées hors des limites (1951).[9] In tune with the guidelines adopted by UNESCO, Bardi discussed the need to create an institutional agenda that could rely on training and dissemination programs, in addition to collection building and preservation.[10] This perspective guided the MASP project throughout Bardi’s direction, and it was based on the idea of some sort of a didactic “civilizing mission” that brought the museum’s role closer to that of a cultural center, or what he called a “counter-museum.”\n\nWe didn’t want the arts to be preserved by an old 18th century museum, the way we all know, but by a museum “school of life” where things should be represented by their classical content, in other words, by their true, persuasively, modern, eternal [character]…. In this anti-museum, the history of painting, for instance, could instigate the same interest as a theatre spectacle and certainly the audience would be amused. … If the intellectuals recognize that a new era opens out and that a revolution is about to happen, the revolution of culture, then the educational question will occupy a foreground position: and our museum—or counter-museum, as we like to call it—will be considered.[11]\n\nWhile distancing themselves from the contemplative museum of European origination, the Bardis were interested in the educational orientation of American museums. Lina Bo Bardi, in particular, saw in these experiences important references, whose strength derived from the contents “that the school could not teach: the awareness to creative activities and the consciousness about historical facts.”[12] This perspective echoes the opening statement of Habitat magazine,[13] written in 1951 by the architect, in which she discusses the social function of museums.[14] In this text Bo Bardi reiterates the educational character of the MASP Sete de Abril and elaborates on the architectural and expographic principles that guided her work in the 1950s. At this venue, elements such as the separation of the works from the walls, the refusal of display adornments and the preference for neutral frames could already be identified.\n\nSuch display principles rehearsed the desire for the desacralization of the arts that would be subsequently radicalized with the conception of the crystal easels for the new premises that the MASP came to occupy at Avenida Paulista in 1968. To Bo Bardi, it was important that the space assumed a flexible character, neutral and non-hierarchical, allowing an arrangement of works that elicited a less passive stance from the observer. While freely transiting through the works, the viewer could build his/her own narrative about the exhibition, liberated from the constraints imposed by an elitist view of art.\n\nThey do not say, therefore, you must admire Rembrandt, but leave to the viewer a pure and unguarded observation, guided only by the captions, descriptive from a point of view that eliminates the exaltation to be critically rigorous.[15]\n\nFrom Milan to Salvador: a formative trajectory\n\nSuch an expographic perspective must be understood beyond the framework of the projects carried out by Lina Bo Bardi in São Paulo. Indeed, it represents a continuity of her first exhibition incursions in Milan (1946), along with the projects undertaken during the period in which the architect lived in Salvador de Bahia, between 1958 and 1966.[16]\n\nTo better understand this trajectory, it is necessary to go back to the exhibition experiences designed by Italian rationalist architects from the 1930s and 1940s, discussed by Carlo Giulio Argan in Renovation of Museums in Italy (1952). To Argan, the end of the war placed Italian museums in a dilemma: the need to preserve their previous structures and the urgency for new spaces dedicated to training, education, and experimentation of modern techniques of display.[17] Among the exponents of this perspective were some projects by the architect Franco Albini, such as the show of painter Gino Bonichi (known as Scipione) at the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan (1941), and the renovation of the museum of the Palazzo Bianco in Genoa (1949), carried out in collaboration with its director, Caterina Marcenaro.\n\nInitially restricted to exhibitions of a propagandist nature, the Italian rationalist architects constructed an approach to the concept applied to exhibitions during the years following the end of the war in visual arts shows and the mounting of museum exhibitions. … It was via Italy that the exhibition concepts of the avant-garde of European abstract art arrived in Brazil with the husband and wife team of Lina Bo and Pietro Maria Bardi in the MASP’s construction.[18]\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Lina Bo Bardi had moved to Salvador, where she became director of the Museum of Modern Art of Bahia. During this period she conceived the architectural project of the new MASP venue, among other pioneering exhibits, such as Bahia no Ibirapuera (1959) and Civilização do Nordeste (1963). Idealized in partnership with theater director Martim Gonçalves and presented during the 5th São Paulo Biennial, the first introduced a whole universe of popular demonstrations and practices linked to the Bahia and Northeast Brazil, while claiming their reading through a non-hierarchical view of culture. Installed under the marquee of the Ibirapuera Park—part of an architectural complex conceived by Oscar Niemeyer—the show featured a theatrical setting composed of surrounding curtains, “a tent ceiling to diffuse the light… and a floor covered with eucalyptus leaves, referencing the Candomblé rituals.”[19] This “theatrical immersive environment,” as Giancarlo Latorraca puts it, or “scenic architecture,” as Lina Bo Bardi defined it, was the basis of one of the inaugural exhibitions of the MASP Paulista, A Mão do Povo Brasileiro (1969).[20] Conceived by Gonçalves and Bo Bardi, along with Pietro Maria Bardi and the filmmaker Glauber Rocha, the show gathered a diversity of objects—including tools, furniture, toys, figureheads, ex-votos, and fabrics—in a display structure composed of pine boards that recalled “the Northeastern street markets and general stores all over Brazil.”[21]\n\nFaced with the Brazilian reality, Lina Bo Bardi did not intend to offer the country a modern civilization project that should fit a European paradigm. Instead, her vision of regional and popular art assumed a more engaged character, and she sought to legitimize elements of popular culture that should be seen on an equal footing with “high culture.” As Andres Lepik puts it, Lina Bo Bardi’s “alternative path to modernism” was built “in contrast to other Europeans in Brazil.”[22] Indeed, it found its ultimate expression in the conception of the second MASP venue—a building that, according to Sabine von Fischer, represents the ability of the architect to translate the rationalist language “into the non-European context.”[23]\n\nTransparency as a statement and a challenge\n\nIn 1964 a military coup ousted President-elect Joao Goulart. This would be the beginning of two decades of censorship and repression, which also reached the arts field. That same year, Bo Bardi was dismissed from the position of director of the Museum of Modern Art of Bahia after having refused to make room for an armament exhibition. Back in São Paulo, she continued the project for the new headquarters of the MASP, which opened in 1968. Positioned on the borders of what would become the symbol of Brazilian economic power, Paulista Avenue, the museum was designed of reinforced concrete and glass—architecture whose transparency was pierced by the light of the tropics and that placed itself in a position contrary to the prevailing museological paradigms.\n\nInside the building, the architect’s gesture extended to the glass plates supported by cubical bases of concrete and wood idealized for the display of MASP’s permanent collection of paintings, the so-called “crystal easels.” On the back side of these plates, Bo Bardi made space for labels of various sizes identifying the author, the title of the work, technique, dimensions, and additional information which, in some cases, covered the entire back of the work. These supports were irregularly installed in the building’s second-floor gallery, facing the visitors’ entrance perspective.\n\nAlthough many reviews of this installation affirm a non-adhesion to any specific chronological, origination, or stylistic framework, echoing some of the architect’s own descriptions, a number of archive photographs show evidence that Lina and Pietro Maria Bardi did inscribe certain sections to specific sequences, in order to create fragments of a curatorial narrative.[24] We can see, for instance, installation views that show a “row” (as erratic as it may seem) of paintings by Brazilian modernists, including A Estudante (1915) by Anita Mafaltti, Interior de Ingredientes (1920) by Lasar Segall, and O lavrador de café (1939) by Candido Portinari.[25]\n\nIn spite of these fragmented arrangements, the perspective of installing the easels according to a display structure that invited viewers to randomly elaborate their own investigative itineraries is unquestionable, and closely linked to the autonomous view of the public that marked the previous projects of Lina Bo Bardi.\n\nFor her, the uses of the museum by the audience would create multiple connections between the works and the “crystal easels” represented the basis of a grammar that she aimed to establish. While desacralizing and stripping the aura of the work of art, making it horizontally cohabit the space, the architect placed the arts at the service of the people, as she claimed in an article published in a São Paulo newspaper in the 1970s:\n\nStripping the Museum of that church atmosphere that excludes the uninitiated, stripping the paintings of their “aura” to present the work of art as “work,” highly specialized but still work; presenting it in a way that can be understood by the uninitiated… The Museu de Arte de São Paulo is popular. … As the responsible person for the Museum’s design and for the design of the crystal easel… with didactic panels to display the paintings, I want to clarify that in designing the Museum it was my intention to destroy the aura that always surrounds a museum, to present the work of art as work, as a prophecy of work at everyone’s reach.[26]\n\nThe crystal easels remained in the museum until four years after Bo Bardi’s death. In 1996, when the MASP went under the direction of architect Julio Neves, they were replaced by compartmentalized galleries. Their removal was justified by a series of arguments, including the risks of excessive lighting for conservation of the works and the randomness of the work’s display, which was considered “particularly hostile to the fruition of non-contemporary art.”[27] It was then that the transparency and malleability of the museum, so dear to Bo Bardi, became opaque along with its facades.\n\nThe removal of the easels was only the beginning of a conceptual and financial crisis that hit the museological project of the MASP, relegating the institution to a secondary position in the city’s arts scene. Stolen paintings, electricity cuts, and a lack of staff and other resources to maintain its activities are just some of the difficulties encountered by the museum during this period. Paradoxically, it was after the disqualification of MASP’s original project that Brazilian architecture and the debates about the “global modernisms” gained international relevance.\n\nAlthough Lina Bo Bardi’s oeuvre had already been the object of exhibitions in Europe during the 1990s, a more vigorous projection of her work in the international scene was followed by the presentation of an exhibition conceived by Japanese architect Kazuyo Sejima at the Venice Biennale in 2010.[28] Since then, numerous shows have been dedicated to Bo Bardi, who has gained a novelty status; British newspaper The Guardian even gave her the questionable title of “Brazil’s best-kept secret.”[29]\n\n“What can explain Lina’s late success? Is the recognition of her work that we are experiencing a solid evaluation or another futile fashion?” asks Guilherme Wisnik.[30] For him, this phenomenon stems from economic, historical, and ideological factors. Among these are Brazil’s rise to prominence as an emerging country after the 2008 financial crisis and the exhaustion of contents that led the European and North American axis to turn its gaze to the Global South as a prolific territory in cultural manifestations. In addition, the multicultural character of Lina Bo Bardi’s work, evidenced by her personal trajectory and interest in the popular culture of Northeast Brazil, offered “various attractive aspects for the criteria of contemporary cultural evaluation, which indicates an openness to otherness.”[31]\n\nThe return of “crystal easels” and its political dimension\n\nIn Brazil the revaluation of Bo Bardi’s work came at a time when the arts harvested the last fruits of the economic boom, allowing significant financial contributions to cultural projects and institutions. It was during the architect’s centennial in 2014 that the MASP could rely on the new direction of Adriano Pedrosa. Interested in non-hegemonic versions of history— such as the histories of sexuality, childhood, and madness—and their intersection with visual arts, Pedrosa took charge of the museum with the goal of gradually revisiting Bo Bardi’s expographies. To this end, he reenacted three displays that made up the history of the museum in its previous headquarters (1947–59). The idea was to retrace “the architect’s path that led up to the design of the crystal easels” at MASP Paulista.[32]\n\nIt is important to think about the easels within the architectural program of the museum, a program that is decolonizing, and therefore pioneer. The question that this program seems to answer is how it is possible to present or tell a story, or several stories around art, with a rich European collection, without replicating a European history, a European model, both of history and museum. And in this sense that the MASP program is a decolonizing one.[33]\n\n[1] The São Paulo Museum of Art at Paulista Avenue hosted two openings, the first on November, 8, 1968, and the second in 1969.\n\n[2] Lina Bo Bardi, “Função social dos museus,” Habitat, no. 1 (1950): 17.\n\n[3] Adriano Pedrosa cited in the press coverage of the exhibition Acervo em Transformação (São Paulo, 2015), accessed July, 30, 2016, https://www.infoartsp.com.br/agenda/acervo-em-transformacao.\n\n[4] This encounter with Chateaubriand represented the beginning of a history that would last almost half a century, since Pietro Maria Bardi remained at the head of the museum until 1996, three years before his death.\n\n[5] In this article I will distinguish between the two MASP venues by referring to them as MASP Sete de Abril (1947–1957) and MASP Paulista (1968–present).\n\n[6] Throughout the following decades Lina Bo Bardi would play a capital influence on the acquisition of less established artists in the local scene, such as Agostinho Batista de Freitas e Maria Auxiliadora da Silva. The works by these artists, along with more recent donations of African and Pre-Columbian Art, are being put forward by the museum’s current director, Adriano Pedrosa.\n\n[7] See Hugo Segawa, Arquiteturas no Brasil 1900–1990 (São Paulo: Edusp, 1998). Also refer to the touring exhibition organized by Bardi, between 1953 and 1957, around prestigious European institutions—including the Musée de l’Orangerie (Paris), the Palais de Beaux Arts (Brussels) and the Tate Gallery (London)—in a clear attempt to legitimize the museum’s enterprise in the international scene.\n\n[8] Raymonde Frin, “Museum: ‘for the benefit of the museums of the world,’” Museum International, vol. L, no. 1, (1998): 5–8.\n\n[9] The first article was presented at the ICOM Regional Conference in 1947 in Mexico City, and later published in the second issue of Museum International. The second was published in the fourth issue of Habitat, founded by the Bardis in the early 1950s.\n\n[10] In the postwar period, the International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) also contributed to the discussions about the museum’s function and its role in city planning. According to Adriano Tomitão Canas during the VIII CIAM (1951), organized in Hoddesdon under the theme “The Heart of the City,” Le Corbusier referred to the MASP as an example of museum-laboratory integrated to the city center.
