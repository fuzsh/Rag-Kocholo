        "text": "The article aims to answer the following question: how is it possible that in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a series of daily activities were suspended in the name of preserving life, police violence has not only continued but worsened in the United States and in Brazil? We argue that racism structures social relations both in the United States and in Brazil, functioning as an essential activity of states that remain involved in the production of different types of physical and symbolic death even amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Contrary to mainstream International Relations, which narrates its central categories – such as the state – as neutral and non-racialised, we will draw attention to the racial origin of the state and its institutions, such as the police. This article aims to look at these two contexts, Brazil and the United States, in a crossed way. This analysis is only possible because, despite the heterogeneity of the two scenarios, we understand that racism is constitutive of global order and of the institutions that sustain its unfair and unequal character.\n\n58 In both countries, the current discourse of the ‘war on drugs’, whose concrete target is not found in its declared objectives but rather in the social markers of race, class, and territory, continues to structure societies forged by slavery. See Kojo Koram, The War on Drugs and the Global Colour Line (London: Pluto Press, 2019). These social markers also structure their respective prison systems: their incarcerated populations are not only among the largest in the world, with the United States in the lead and Brazil in third place, but they are also disproportionately composed of the poorest and most racialised populations. See Ana L. P. Flauzina, Corpo negro caído no chão: O sistema penal e o projeto genocida do estado brasileiro (Rio de Janeiro: Contraponto, 2008); Alexander, The New Jim Crow."
