        "text": "In times of samba dominance, a waltz is hugely successful. It's Lips I Kissed, composed by J.Cascata and Leonel Azevedo. Since its first recording, by RCA Victor, in 1937, Lábios has made history in Brazilian popular music. The interpreter of the sad verses that mourn the loss of the beloved is Orlando Silva, the “singer of the crowds” and his arranger, Radamés Gnatalli. Historians write that the waltz is one of the first to include the string section, originating from classical music, in popular compositions in Brazil. The choice was made by Gnatalli, who at the time was already a renowned composer and performer. His career as an arranger was no less brilliant until his death in 1988, and the old waltz was always remembered by fans and critics as a beautiful example of Radamés's inventiveness. Such unanimity may, however, contain certain mistakes. This is what the master's thesis states: “Your image remains immaculate. Radamés Gnattali and his arrangement for the waltz-song: 'Lábios que beijei'\", by Geremias Tiófilo Pereira Júnior, supervised by professor Roberto Cesar Pires, from the Institute of Arts (IA) Unicamp.\n\nA musician trained at Unicamp and also at the Tatuí Conservatory, Geremias always brings with him, in addition to the transverse flute and clarinet, his saxophone. It was from this instrument that he came into contact with the universe of Gnatalli: listening to the “Concertino for alto saxophone and orchestra”. As a special postgraduate student in Music at IA, he turned to arranging and then decided to study it for his master's degree. Lips I Kissed was intensely analyzed from a technical perspective as opposed to a historical one. “I wanted to compare everything they say about Lábios with what can be described on paper, musically.” Thus, Geremias looked for the waltz's sheet music at the National Library in Rio de Janeiro. Not finding it, he decided to do it on his own. The detailed transcription of the arrangement was part of the investigation. “Evidently listening to the waltz, due to the quality of the recording, I may have missed an instrument. But I tried to be as faithful as possible to the original arrangement.”\n\nThe result allowed the musician to raise several hypotheses. The main thing is that, contrary to what was supposed, the proposed combinations are, in a way, quite traditional, “even common”, says the researcher. “At that time, Radamés took as a basis the arrangements of Pixinguinha, who used a lot of the transverse flute, a characteristic instrument of choro, in his arrangements. If he innovated the Brazilian arrangement, in my opinion it wasn’t at that moment”, he highlights. Even with the inclusion of strings in popular music, Geremias explains that, three years before Lábios, North American musicians had already innovated in this field.\n\nAnother idea put in comparison is that the strings would have greater expression in Gnatalli's arrangement. “I analyzed how many measures the strings have in relation to the transverse flute and I was able to verify that the two instruments have the same weight.” For the author, it is the transverse flute that dialogues with Orlando Silva while the strings provide the background of stopped notes, a basis for the melody. The transverse flute would also be mentioned in choro and would also have, in the waltz, the same primary importance as the guitar has in Portuguese fado. The sad melody is also reinforced by the sound of two clarinets that operate “in a very low, obscure region”.\n\nAccording to Geremias, piano, drums and double bass provide the continuous rhythmic marking in the arrangement, in an allusion to the pain of losing the song's character. The strings provide harmonic support and the cello draws attention in a solo. “It's beautiful because the instrument fills a large part of the instrumental interlude and is played in a high region, taking advantage of Iberê Camargo Grosso's talent” he says. In total, there are 9 instruments used in the arrangement.\n\nThe author of the dissertation considers that the success that the waltz achieved, projecting the careers of both Orlando Silva and Radamés (who continued the partnership for another 10 years), is also due to the instruments' interpreters: in addition to Iberê as cellist, the first The recording of Lábios features Luciano Perrone on drums, violinist Romeu Ghipsman and Gnatalli himself on piano. Geremias was only in doubt whether the transverse flute was Dante Santoro or Pixinguinha. He called and was answered by José Menezes, a musician from Radamés Gnatalli's Sexteto. He confirmed that it was indeed Dante Santoro (who would improvise less than Pixinguinha although the flute was “very comfortable”, as the researcher describes).\n\nTwo other interviews, with the musician Paulo Moura – who died in 2010, and Laércio de Freitas, also from Sexteto, appear in the dissertation. The author's objective was to delve deeper into the history of the Brazilian arrangement, before trying to understand Gnatalli in Lábios que Beijei.\n\nArrangers\n\nRadamés Gnatalli was an arranger for the record label RCA Victor, together with Pixinguinha, at the time when the recording industry began to establish itself in Brazil. The comparison between the two in the period was inevitable. Pixinguinha ended up being seen as heritage and tradition, while Radamés was the new, innovative one.\n\nThe dissertation recovers a moment before, when arrangers were musicians who knew how to write the score for melodies sung by musicians who did not know exactly the musical spelling. There are those who left the revue theater and went to radio, including Anacleto de Medeiros.\n\nIn the time of Gnatalli and Pixinguinha, the arranger had a very important role because he not only chose the instruments but also determined who the interpreters would be. “Today, with a few exceptions, the arranger doesn’t have much autonomy. The producer determines everything. This was confirmed in the interviews I did, especially with Paulo Moura”, says Geremias.\n\nThe author also recalls other great names in the arrangement, in references in biographical summaries. He highlights, for example, the work of maestro Odmar Amaral Gurgel, “Gaó”. “He has a level of performance very close to Radamés Gnatalli, however he is not remembered”.\n\nGnatalli would almost be a media phenomenon, “obviously without taking away his merits”, observes the researcher. This is mainly due to the success of the program “One million melodies”, which debuted in 1943 on Rádio Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, and continued until 1966, under the direction of Radamés.\n\nFrom Lábios que Beijei, the author of the research surveyed 23 other re-recordings since the first, in 1937. “To understand the influence of Radamés Gnatalli's arrangement to this day, all versions relate to him directly, highlighting the strings”. Recordings by Ângela Maria in 1956, by Jacob do Bandolin, in 1959, by Caetano Veloso (with Jaques Morelenbaum on cello) are cited by Geremias as the most representative. The most recent is by Mônica Salmaso in 2011, with piano, voice and flute.\n\nThe researcher's conclusions make him agree with other academic works in the field of music that place the original arrangement in the same status as a composition. “In addition to the Lábios composition, we have another built-in composition, which is the Gnatalli arrangement. Being able to identify a song by its arrangement is something that must be respected, like a composition.”\n\nPublication"
