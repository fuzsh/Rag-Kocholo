        "text": "As part of my MBA experience, one of my goals is to strengthen my professional ties with Brazil (aka the Motherland) while seeking ways to add value and give back to the place where I spent the first 15 years of my life.\n\nFor the past couple of years, I had the pleasure to collaborate with Professor Flávio Feferman who teaches a course, Seminar in International Business (SIB), about doing business in Brazil and emerging markets. The class meets a few times in Berkeley to discuss historical, political, economic and cultural aspects of doing business in Brazil and concludes with a trip to see business in Brazil first hand. This year, we designed the class to cover three main topics: Brazilian local champions, social impact, and corporate innovation + entrepreneurship. As the graduate student instructor for the class, I get to spend one week sharing my country with others and visiting incredible organizations with a group of 15 MBA candidates from Berkeley-Haas. Needless to say, this experience has been one of the highlights of my MBA education, filled with many learnings and humbling experiences.\n\nBrazil has often been coined as a place of “booms and busts,” “always the country of the future,” and when it comes to business, it is “not for beginners!” I however, want to highlight a different side of my country, one that has both highly technical and talented individuals leading our largest corporations (local champions) and very resourceful entrepreneurs showing resilience and aspirations to make a real impact.\n\nOur first stop was São Paulo…\n\nSão Paulo: New York with some Silicon Valley flare\n\nSão Paulo often surprises first-time visitors! It is a massive concrete city of more than 12 million people, filled with vast skyscrapers. It is the home of most company headquarters that are serious about doing business in Brazil.\n\nLet’s jump to the company visits and people we met!\n\nBrazil Foods (BRF)\n\nDays after the meat scandal in Brazil, we met with Gilson Manfio and Fabio Bagnara, Head of Digital Transformation and R&D respectively. It was quite impressive to see such personable and pragmatic leaders in charge of very technical roles.\n\nI was impressed to hear their take on the recent meat scandal and investigation. Although disappointed with the way the media handled the incident, and quite concerned with the financial and reputation consequences, both leaders showed a positive framing of the problem and made sure to highlight the opportunities created by such an event. From a business student prospect, it was quite intriguing to learn about the steps being taken to manage a crisis with global magnitude, and seeing a bottom up approach being used to evolve company culture to become more transparent and innovative.\n\n\"Out of a crisis, there are many learnings and opportunities. People come together and it forces us to evolve.\" - Gilson Manfio\n\nMercado Livre\n\nThis was my second-time visiting Latin American's e-commerce giant in São Paulo; however, it was my first time in their impressive and brand new Brazilian headquarters, called Melicidade, a clever play on words to describe their version of a Googleplex. The name Melicidade comes from MErcado LIvre, and the Portuguese words: cidade (city) and Felicidade (happiness). Besides the clever name, Melicidade is a very well designed space with an open floor plan used to foster collaboration and filled with perks to attract and retain talent. Does this strategy seem familiar? It is not much different than the tactics applied by big tech firms in the Bay Area.\n\nAt MeLi, we were welcomed by Stelleo Tolda, COO of the company, head of Brazilian operations, and Prof. Feferman’s childhood friend. Stelleo and MeLi’s founder, Marcos Galperin, went to Stanford Business School together and Stelleo has been with the organization from its very early days. Stelleo's success story is an example to many aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders in technology throughout Latin America.\n\nIn terms of corporate innovation, Stelleo walked us through several specific examples of institutional voids that MeLi had to overcome in order to succeed in Brazil, such as the creation of their own payment system (MercadoPago) and the implementation of a delivery infrastructure (MercadoEnvios). He talked about their challenges to continue to expand the business and attract talent, his thoughts on why they won the eCommerce marketplace battle in Latin America, and their outlook going forward, including the goal of leveraging their rich data to offer credit to both sellers and shoppers.\n\nO Boticario\n\nAt the largest cosmetic company in Brazil and the largest cosmetic franchise in the world, O Boticário, we met Haas alum, Danilo Rodrigues. He shared lessons from market segmentation, including the benefits and conflicts of having both a direct sales and a corporate retail model. Danilo also highlighted O Boticário’s insights and strategy on going beyond the Brazilian market. The company already operates in 9 different countries with over 3,700 retail locations.\n\nItau and Cubo\n\nThe largest Brazilian bank is taking multiple steps to continue to reinvent itself through internal corporate innovation. Through Cubo, Itau seeks to contribute to the startup ecosystem with a open innovation model.\n\n\"Everyday a client who likes to visit our retail location is no longer amongst us, and a new digital customer is born.\" - Pedro, Investor Relations\n\nItau understands that retail banking is changing quickly and it has put a lot of work into creating digital experiences for its customers.\n\nIn a design thinking session, our group worked closely with the Itau's innovation squad to brainstorm and present possible new structures for their innovation lab. The goal of the exercise was to foster internal innovation combined with outside collaboration of emerging fintech startups and college students.\n\nAdditionally, it was impressive and encouraging to see the amount of effort and investment being put towards sustainability by the bank.\n\nTotvs\n\nBorn in the 1980s, Totvs could be considered one of Brazil’s first technology startups. Totvs provides business software to ~50 percent of Brazil’s small and medium-sized companies. It is a clear case of Brazilian tech firm success, and one of the top 25 most valuable brands in the country. Totvs is successfully applying design thinking and customer-centric methodologies to solve internal problems and foster innovation. I could easily write a whole article on Totvs approach to internal corporate innovation...\n\nWayra – Telefonica’s Accelerator in Brazil\n\nThere we met highly capable entrepreneurs with Silicon Valley and international experience seeking to tackle problems beyond the Brazilian borders. I was quite impressed to see startups thinking globally from their infancy! Given the size and complexity of the Brazilian market, entrepreneurs often look inward and decide to focus only on “Brazilian problems” but this was not necessarily the case for many of the ventures at Wayra.\n\nKeep an eye out for the two financial technology companies currently being accelerated at Wayra São Paulo: Dataholics and iU App!\n\nRio de Janeiro: Yosemite meets Los Angeles\n\n\"O Rio de Janeiro continua lindo!\" - Gilberto Gil\n\nAs the iconic song written by Gilberto Gil in 1969, during the military dictatorship years, eloquently states \"Rio continues to be beautiful!\" The song goes on to describe the joy and energy of a Carioca (individual born in Rio) as well as the beauty of the city. Rio with its scenic beaches, Yosemite like picturesque granite hills, lush tropical forest and bohemian neighborhoods, is just majestic. It is a huge contrast to São Paulo, but none the less we had our fair share of learnings.\n\nWe visited Antera and Catavento for a lively discussion about venture capital, entrepreneurship and social impact, which made all of us from Haas feel at home. We also talked to Professor and Dr. Milton Feferman about Rio's urban planning (or often the lack thereof) and the cultural-rich living ecosystem of favelas (slums). In the same conversation, Dr. Milton Feferman quoted our famous carnavalesco (samba school director), Joãosinho Trinta, and made all of us reflect...\n\n“The one who likes poverty is the intellectual, poor people are after luxury” - Joãosinho Trinta\n\nRede Globo\n\nGlobo is the largest media conglomerate in Latin America. The business is fully family-owned, and it is known for its impressive production of telenovelas, news, and sports coverage among other things.\n\nAt Globo, we were welcomed by the charismatic Roberto Marinho Neto (the founder’s grandson, son of the current CEO and Head of Sports). Roberto went to NYU Stern, and he was quick to build rapport with his audience given that 5 years ago he sat in the same seat doing an exchange program in Asia. Having grown up around the business, his passion and command for the subject were very apparent as he spoke. He was an engaging and articulate speaker, leveraging analogies and storytelling to captivate his audience.\n\nRoberto represents a new generation at Globo, one that is having to define digitalization and how to compete with emerging players such as Google and Netflix. The way he answered questions and shared the company vision came across very focused and aware of emerging “friendenemies” (a term used by Roberto to describe competitors that are also collaborators). Globo plays a very influential role in the life of most Brazilians with 90+ million people watches the channel daily.\n\n\"It is like if we had a super bowl every single day\" - Roberto M. Neto\n\nGrowing up watching Globo, it was quite unique and even nostalgic to see and experience the behind the scenes of the organization. Plus, I left Rio with an admirable respect of Roberto Neto and his leadership capabilities.\n\nBola Pra Frente\n\nThis was probably my most rewarding experience of the trip!\n\nYes, I am biased since sports have always played a critical role in my upbringing from staying away from trouble, having a support system that works towards a common goal, to understanding how to trust others and learn English when I first moved to California.\n\nBola Pra Frente is a non-profit organization founded by a 1994 World Cup champion, Jorginho, to empower and educate children from underserved communities through sports.\n\nWe spent an afternoon getting to know the kids, playing soccer and engaging in different activities. Their joy and excitement to be playing and interacting with foreigners made me reflect on my personal journey and how fortunate I have been throughout my upbringing. The project only reinforced my desire to be more involved in projects that directly support individuals to live a better future. The kids I met there represented hope and eagerness to thrive against adversity.\n\nI know we have got a long way to go in order to break the paradigm of always being the country of the future but not the country thriving in the present. As an optimistic individual who has been fortunate to have had access to a privileged education abroad combined with an unique professional experience, I cannot help but think of ways to get involved and support the Brazilian entrepreneurial ecosystem in order to make my homeland a country of today.\n\nMore to come..."
