        "text": "Brazilian footballer (born 1992)\n\nIn this Portuguese name, the first or maternal family name is Rodrigues and the second or paternal family name is Moura da Silva.\n\nLucas Rodrigues Moura da Silva (born 13 August 1992), known as Lucas Moura (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈlukaz ˈmowɾɐ]),[4] is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a right winger and centre-forward for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club São Paulo.\n\nMoura started his professional career at São Paulo where he became one of the best players in the Campeonato Brasileiro. His pace and dribbling skills garnered attention from numerous European clubs, eventually earning him a transfer to French side Paris Saint-Germain. After winning multiple domestic trophies over a five-year span at the club, Moura was then signed by English side Tottenham Hotspur. He was involved in the side reaching their first ever UEFA Champions League final, scoring a historic hat-trick against Ajax in the second leg of the semi-final of the competition to help Spurs advance to the final. After five years with Tottenham, Moura returned to São Paulo in 2023, winning the Copa do Brasil in his first season back at the club.\n\nMoura made his senior international debut for Brazil in 2011 and has since earned over 30 caps, representing the nation at two editions of the Copa América, the 2012 Olympics (where he won a silver medal), and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the latter title.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nSão Paulo\n\n[edit]\n\nMoura joined São Paulo FC in 2005 after playing for the youth teams of Clube Atlético Juventus and Corinthians and was known as Marcelinho since he played for a Marcelinho Carioca football school as a child and also had physical resemblance with the former footballer.[5] Having had prominence at youth level, he was promoted to play professionally by Milton Cruz. Moura made his debut with the São Paulo first-team in 2010, scoring 4 goals and providing four assists in 25 appearances. In the same year, he stated his desire to be known for his given name instead of a nickname to \"make his own history in football without comparisons\".[6][7] In 2011, Moura scored nine goals and provided four assists in 28 appearances in the Campeonato Brasileiro and 13 goals and eight assists in all competitions.[citation needed]\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Manchester United and Inter Milan were reported to be interested in signing Moura.[8] On 8 August 2012, Paris Saint-Germain won the battle and announced the player would be moving to the club in January 2013. He would be the club's most expensive signing.[9] The transfer fee was reported to be in the region of €45 million (£38 million).[10] It was announced that Moura would wear the No. 29 shirt for the remainder of the season.[citation needed]\n\nOn 11 January 2013, Moura made his debut against AC Ajaccio, in a match that ended as a 0–0 draw. He also played in the Champions League away victory over Valencia on 12 February, assisting a goal in the process.[11] On 13 September 2013, he scored his first goal for PSG in a 2–0 league victory over Bordeaux.[12]\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, following Jérémy Ménez's transfer to A.C. Milan, Moura was handed the No. 7 shirt – the same number he wore while playing for São Paulo.[13] He made his season debut for PSG in their 2–0 Trophée des Champions victory over Coupe de France winners EA Guingamp on 2 August 2014 at the Workers Stadium in Beijing.[14]\n\nHe scored his first goal of the 2014–15 Ligue 1 campaign on 16 August, volleying in a Gregory van der Wiel cross as PSG defeated Bastia 2–0.[15] On 5 October, Moura scored the opening goal in a match that finished 1–1 against title rivals Monaco.[16] With his two goals in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bordeaux on 25 October, he equalled his league tally from the previous season.[17]\n\nOn 7 August 2015, Moura scored the first goal of the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season in PSG's 1–0 defeat of Lille OSC at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.[18]\n\nOn 15 October 2016, Moura scored PSG's first goal in the 13th minute in a 2–1 away win against AS Nancy in a Ligue 1 match with a curling free-kick from the left which nobody got a touch to; that was his fifth league goal of the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season.[19] For the 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, he appeared only as substitute six times for the club, and left in January 2018.[20]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 31 January 2018, Moura signed a contract with Tottenham Hotspur until 2023 for a transfer fee of around £25 million.[20][21] He made his debut for Tottenham in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League match against Juventus on 13 February 2018, coming on as a late substitute in the match that ended in a 2–2 draw.[22] He made his first start as well as scoring his first goal for the club in the FA Cup tie against Rochdale on 18 February 2018 that also finished 2–2.[23]\n\nIn the 2018–19 season, Moura scored his first Premier League goal on 18 August 2018 in Spurs' 3–1 win over Fulham.[24] In the following match on 27 August 2018, he scored a brace against Manchester United as Tottenham won 3–0 in only their third away win at Old Trafford in 27 games.[25][26] He scored his first Champions League goal for Spurs in the group round match against PSV.[27] In the away match against Barcelona at Camp Nou, Moura scored a late equaliser after Barcelona took an early lead in the game. The game ended 1–1, which sent Tottenham through into the knockout stage together with Barcelona.[28] On 13 April 2019, he scored a hat-trick in the 4–0 win over Huddersfield Town. This was his first hat-trick in Europe and the first ever hat-trick scored at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.[29]\n\nOn 8 May 2019, Moura scored a second half hat-trick in Tottenham's 3–2 victory over Ajax at the Johan Cruyff Arena in the second leg of their Champions League semi-finals. Spurs came back from 2–0 down on the night, and 3–0 down on aggregate to win on away goals. His third goal, in the 96th minute, sent his team into a Champions League final for the first time in their history.[30] This performance led L'Équipe to award him a perfect 10 rating, making him the tenth ever player to be awarded a 10 rating by them.[31]\n\nOn 9 August 2019, Moura signed a new contract with Tottenham until 2024.[32] He scored his first goal of the 2019–20 season on 17 August 2019, equalising against Manchester City within nineteen seconds of being introduced as a substitute.[33]\n\nOn 12 January 2023, it was announced that Moura's Spurs contract would not be extended.[34] On 18 May, the club confirmed that he would depart in the summer.[35] On May 28, the last day of the Premier League season, Moura netted during stoppage time in an emphatic 4–1 win over Leeds United in his final game for the club.[36]\n\nReturn to São Paulo\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2023, after three months without a club, Lucas Moura returned to São Paulo Futebol Clube, marking his comeback after eleven years. His signing garnered attention as the biggest move of the winter transfer window in Brazilian football, creating a significant buzz on social media. [37][38] The contract stipulated his stay until December.[39]\n\nDuring his presentation, he received the number 7 shirt, worn in his initial stint, handed over by the previous holder, Alisson.[40]\n\nOn July 6, he played his return match, coming in on the second half in the 2–0 defeat against Atlético Mineiro at Morumbi. [41][42] He participated in an emotional pre-match presentation alongside the high-profile addition James Rodríguez. [43] Despite a positive debut with chances created, he conceded the penalty which resulted in the second Atlético goal.[44][45] He scored his first goal since his return on August 13, in the 1–1 draw against Flamengo in the 19th round of Brasileirão.[46]\n\nOn August 16, he had the standout performance of the Copa do Brasil semifinals, helping São Paulo win the return match against Corinthians by 2–0 (3–2 on aggregate). During the match, Lucas outpaced and dribbled past Corinthians' slow and visibly frustrated defense, creating multiple chances before finally scoring a header in the 32nd minute of the first half, securing the comeback in the aggregate score.\n\nOn August 24, he scored the only goal in São Paulo's 2–1 away defeat to LDU in the Copa Sudamericana, which marked his first appearance in the competition since 2012.\n\nLucas played both legs of the Cup final against Flamengo, with São Paulo winning the away game 1–0 and tying the home match 1–1, thus securing São Paulo's first Copa do Brasil title.[47] Despite only playing three matches, Lucas was praised as one of the key players in the tournament.[48]\n\nOn December 22, he extended his contract with São Paulo until the end of 2026.[49]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nYouth career and early senior career\n\n[edit]\n\nMoura was a frequent member of Brazil's Under-20 international side. In February 2011, he played for Brazil in the Under-20 South American Championship where he scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 victory over Uruguay in the final. Moura made his senior international debut for Brazil in a friendly match against Scotland on 27 March 2011. On 28 September 2011, Moura scored his first senior international goal for Brazil against Argentina.[citation needed]\n\n2011 Copa América\n\n[edit]\n\nMoura was named in Mano Menezes' squad for the 2011 Copa América in Argentina. Moura appeared in the group stage matches against Paraguay, Ecuador and Venezuela as a second-half substitute on all occasions. He once again featured as a substitute in Brazil's penalty shoot-out defeat to Paraguay in the quarter-finals which eliminated Brazil from the competition.[citation needed]\n\n2012 Olympics\n\n[edit]\n\nMoura was selected to compete for the Brazil Olympic football team in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London along with club teammates Casemiro and Bruno Uvini. He appeared in three matches as a substitute, including the Gold medal match with Mexico, and started in the 3–0 group stage victory over New Zealand.[citation needed]\n\n2013 Confederations Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nMoura was selected by Luiz Felipe Scolari for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup on home soil.[50]\n\nCopa América Centenario\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, Moura was named in Dunga's 23-man squad for the Copa América Centenario in the United States.[51]\n\nStyle of play\n\n[edit]\n\nCredited as a quick and mobile winger, who is also powerful, creative, and technically gifted,[52] Moura is also known for his explosive acceleration, agility, jumping, and pace – both on and off the ball –, as well as his movement, and his excellent dribbling skills, in particular his use of trickery and feints, which make him a dangerous offensive threat.[53][54][55][56][57] A versatile player, he is also capable of playing in several positions, and has also been deployed as a forward,[58] in midfield,[59] as a support striker,[60] or even as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[61] However, he has been accused of being inconsistent in the media, in particular in his youth,[60] while his vision and decision–making have also been cited as weaknesses to his game.[62]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nClub\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 23 August 2024[63]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League State league[a] National cup[b] League cup[c] Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals São Paulo 2010 Série A 25 4 0 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 25 4 2011 28 9 8 3 4 0 — 3 1 — 43 13 2012 21 6 21 6 9 2 — 9 2 — 60 16 Total 74 19 29 9 13 2 — 12 3 — 128 33 Paris Saint-Germain 2012–13 Ligue 1 10 0 — 1 0 0 0 4[d] 0 — 15 0 2013–14 36 5 — 2 0 4 0 10[d] 0 1[e] 0 53 5 2014–15 29 7 — 4 1 4 0 8[d] 0 1[e] 0 46 8 2015–16 36 9 — 6 1 4 1 9[d] 2 1[e] 0 56 13 2016–17 37 12 — 5 3 3 2 7[d] 1 1[e] 1 53 19 2017–18 5 1 — 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 6 1 Total 153 34 — 18 5 16 3 38 3 4 1 229 46 Tottenham Hotspur 2017–18 Premier League 6 0 — 4 1 — 1[d] 0 — 11 1 2018–19 32 10 — 2 0 3 0 12[d] 5 — 49 15 2019–20 35 4 — 5 2 1 0 6[d] 1 — 47 7 2020–21 30 3 — 3 1 4 0 13[f] 5 — 50 9 2021–22 34 2 — 2 1 4 2 5[g] 1 — 45 6 2022–23 15 1 — 1 0 0 0 3[d] 0 — 19 1 Total 152 20 — 17 5 12 2 40 12 — 221 39 São Paulo 2023 Série A 14 1 — 3 1 — 2 1 — 19 3 2024 15 5 7 2 3 1 — 5 1 — 30 9 Total 29 6 7 2 6 2 — 7 2 — 49 12 Career total 407 79 36 11 53 14 29 4 96 19 4 1 625 129\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 12 October 2018[64]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Brazil 2011 10 1 2012 12 2 2013 9 1 2014 0 0 2015 2 0 2016 1 0 2017 0 0 2018 1 0 Total 35 4\n\nScores and results tables list Brazil's goal tally first.\n\nList of international goals scored by Lucas Moura No. Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1 28 September 2011 Estádio Olímpico do Pará, Belém, Brazil Argentina\n\n1–0\n\n2–0\n\n2011 Superclásico de las Américas 2 10 September 2012 Estádio do Arruda, Recife, Brazil China\n\n3–0\n\n8–0\n\nFriendly 3 11 October 2012 Swedbank Stadion, Malmö, Sweden Iraq\n\n6–0\n\n6–0\n\n4 9 June 2013 Arena do Grêmio, Porto Alegre, Brazil France\n\n3–0\n\n3–0\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nSão Paulo U20\n\nCopa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior: 2010[65]\n\nSão Paulo\n\nCopa Sudamericana: 2012[66]\n\nCopa do Brasil: 2023[66]\n\nSupercopa do Brasil: 2024\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nLigue 1: 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16[66]\n\nCoupe de France: 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17[66]\n\nCoupe de la Ligue: 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17[66]\n\nTrophée des Champions: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016[66]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nEFL Cup runner-up: 2020–21[67]\n\nUEFA Champions League runner-up: 2018–19[68]\n\nBrazil U20\n\nSouth American U-20 Championship: 2011[69]\n\nBrazil U23\n\nSummer Olympic silver medal: 2012[70]\n\nBrazil\n\nFIFA Confederations Cup: 2013[66]\n\nIndividual\n\nCampeonato Brasileiro Série A Team of the Year: 2012[71]\n\nBola de Prata: 2012[72]\n\nUNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Month: October 2014[73]\n\nPremier League Player of the Month: August 2018[74]\n\nUEFA Champions League Squad of the Season: 2018–19[75]\n\nBest Right Winger in Brazil: 2023[76]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
