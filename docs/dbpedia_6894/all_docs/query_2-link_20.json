        "text": "Chief Instructor RMNU\n\nProfessor Robson Moura\n\nCall Sign: Robinho\n\nDate of Birth: 3/78\n\nTown: Teresopolis-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nJiu Jitsu Category: Bantamweight\n\nWeight: 64kg 140bs\n\nHeight: 1.65M 5″6″\n\nRobson Moura Biography\n\nRobson Moura was born on the 23rd of March, 1978 in Brazil. He started training Jiu Jitsu very early in life, when he was just 10 years old with his father’s backing. His very first instructor was Ailson “Jucao” Brites in his hometown of Teresópolis, which is located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Robson wanted to follow the footsteps of his BJJ idols, so he started training 2 and 3 times per day and competed for the first time in a local competition when he was only 13 years of age.\n\nUnforeseen circumstances had “Jucao” moving away from Teresópolis, leaving “Robinho” without a coach. This however did not detour Moura from his path to becoming a Jiu Jitsu black belt. With the BJJ bug already fully installed in him he sought out the best lightweight team in the World at the time, the famous Nova Uniao led by André Pederneiras and Wendell Alexander. This new partnership proved to be very fruitful as Robson kept on winning tournaments left and right, culminating this great period with a fantastic win at the World Championships in 1996 as a purple belt.\n\nGoing against the minimum time frame guidelines approved by the Jiu Jitsu Federation, his coaches decided to promote Robson Moura to black belt the following year to compete at the highest level possible, the Mundials (World Championships). Robinho did not disappoint winning the tournament in amazing fashion.\n\nDuring the following years, this Nova Uniao prodigy had successive wins in the Mundial and lot’s of other important championships like the CBJJO (World Cup). He stopped competing for a few years in an attempt to establish the RMNU association (Robson Moura-Nova Uniao) in the United States. Robson had already some well established schools in Brazil, being his Ribeirao Preto academy the most famous one, but decided the USA was the future of the sport and embarked on the project of building a successful academy there.\n\nAfter establishing his school, Robson decided to have another stab at the World Championship Gold Medal, it had been 5 years since his last attempt but Moura and his amazing technique came through as he won the 2007 Gold. Not only is Robinho a master competitor, but he is also a successful coach being Augusto Cruz and Ricardo Abreu his most acknowledged standouts.\n\nTitles:\n\nWorld Championships: 7\n\nYears 1996 / 1997 / 1998 / 1999 / 2000 / 2002 / 2007\n\nBrazilian Championships for Team: 6\n\nYears 1997 / 1998 / 2000 / 2001 / 2002 / 2003\n\nU.S. Nationals Pro Black Belt Champion: 2007\n\nLA Sub X Champion: 2006\n\nPan American Championships: 2\n\nYears: 1996 & 2007 – Los Angeles CA.\n\nRio de Janiero Championships: 8\n\nYears: 1990 / 1991 / 1992 / 1993 / 1994 / 1995 / 1996 / 1997\n\nSao Paulo Championships: 3\n\nNetherlands Open Championship: 1\n\nYears: 1996"
