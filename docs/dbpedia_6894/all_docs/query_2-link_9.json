        "text": "Great call!\n\nIndeed, Choro is a music form that was born in my hometown Rio de Janeiro in the 19th century. And although Samba also originated in Rio almost simultaneously, Choro is considered the first characteristically Brasilian genre of urban popular music. Interesting of notice the Choro's mixing of European folk with African and Afro-brasilian rhythms to it, even being designed an instrument especially for it: \"Cavaquinho\" as a genuinely Brasilian musical instrument to be added as a third acoustic guitar to the Europeans Mandolin and Viola guitar ensembles.\n\nPersonally I'm an inveterate fan of this music, my favourite musicians being Pixinguinha, Altamiro Carrilho, Jacob do Bandolin, Chiquinha Gonzaga e Ernesto Nazareth. Here I share a precious and remarkable excerpt of this music, featuring the renowned group \"Época de Ouro\" along with my favourite Samba composer and 'Samba-Choro' musician ever: Paulinho da Viola.\n\n.\n\nGreat thread and I sincerely hope that it will also touch on current Brazilian music.\n\nThe greats of the Bossa Nova era, tropicalia and Samba are all great but I believe that there is a current thriving scene concentrated in Sao Paulo. Hard for me to get information in English but some artists and records that I discovered recently are:\n\nMeta Meta - MM3\n\nRodrigo Campos - Conversas Con Toshiro\n\nJucara Marcal - Encarnado\n\nAva Rocha - Ava Patrie Yindia Yracema\n\nOnca Combo\n\nI ordered these records from Brazil and should receive them in 2-3 weeks.\n\nThe music is available to stream on YouTube and Spotify.\n\nIf anybody knows more of the same or has information about this emerging scene I would like to find out more\n\nWell, after a long while I'm back. Thanks all for your comments and contributions. I'm glad to see so many people speaking about Brazilian music.\n\nToday I'll show you a greatly underrated artist called Taiguara. He was a composer singer in the 60s and 70s who reach great radio success with some songs Hoje and Universo no seu Corpo. His voice and composition styles were inimitable. In 1976 he recorded an album called Imyra, Tayra, Ipy, Taiguara, but the album was entirely censored by the military dictatorship that then governed Brazil. Some records were printed, though, and they became very valuable in the secondary markets (with records reaching hundreds of dollars in Japan).\n\nThe players in the record are a who's who of the Brazilian scene at the time. Among them you can find\n\nTaiguara - vocals\n\nHermeto Pascoal - flute and arrangements\n\nToninho Horta - guitar\n\nNivaldo Ornelas - saxofone\n\nWagner Tiso - piano, keyboard\n\nMauro Senise - flute\n\nJ.T. Meirelles - flute\n\nRaul Mascarenhas - flute\n\nNetinho - flute\n\nMacacheira - trombone\n\nNovelli - bass\n\nZé Eduardo Nazário - percussion\n\nPaulo Braga - drums\n\nJaques Morelenbaum - cello\n\nUbirajara Silva - bandoneon\n\nLúcia Morelenbaum - harp\n\nWell, here is the link:\n\nI love Zé Ramalho too. I remember when I bought my first Zé Ramalho album. The one with the song Avohai and Chao de Giz. Patrick Moraz, who for a while played keyboards for Yes, plays in Avohai. More recently Zé Ramalho made an interesting record with Bob Dylan covers in Portuguese (some of them excellent). He has great musician friends, who will show up here one of these days.\n\nI think Jorge Ben's albums in the 60s and 70s are excellent. He has a voice somewhat like Joao Gilberto but the music is bouncier and more rhythmically driven. His first albums were samba but he moved over to a warm bossa and pop style around 1970. I have the French vinyl of his 1975 album Solta o Pavao retitled elsewhere as Para Ouvir No Radio.\n\nNoel Rosa was a composer singer born in Rio de Janeiro in 1910, who died in the same city only 26 years later.\n\nDespite his short life Noel Rosa was hugely influential in Brazil. He was one of the first composers to bring the music from the hills around Rio de Janeiro, where the poor people mostly descendants from Africa slaves lived, to the more sophisticated public through the radio. Noel was a great lyrics writer and a creative composer, and his songs are still known and played today.\n\nOne example of his music is the song \"Quantos beijos\" (So many kisses). Here you will hear it sang by Noel himself, together with Marilia Batista (one of his favorites performers)\n\nNoel Rosa's songs were recorded many times over the years by many of the great singers and musicians in Brazil. In the beginning of the 1980s a group of musicians in Sao Paulo formed Grupo Rumo. Rumo started iby releasing two great álbuns in a short sequence, one with contemporary music called Rumo and another with songs from the beginning of the 20th century, called Rumo aos Antigos (something like \"In our way to the oldies\"). The first song of Rumo aos antigos is the follow performance of \"Quantos beijos\":\n\nRumo 01 Quantos Beijos (Vadico, Noel Rosa)\n\nOne great song, two beautiful and very different versions.\n\nAfter a long while, I’m back with another great album recorded in the 1970s in Brazil. The album name is Paebiru, by composers, singers and musicians Zé Ramalho and Lula Côrtes. Most of the copies of the album were lost in an accident and it became almost a legend among fans. It was re-release in cd format some 15 years ago.\n\nThe music is a mix of Northeastern Brazilian music (such as forró) with psychedelic and many other sounds. The instrumental songs are beautifully performed by a great group of musicians. You can find the album in Tidal as well. I think is great music and hope someone enjoys the album too.\n\nThis is gonna be soooo much fun! As much as I love discovering sounds from other cultures, my first not-from-USA love was bossa nova (which admittedly we appropriated until England caught our attention), so that takes a lot of air out of the room before I get curious about what else is coming up on the breeze. Nowadays I easily get distracted just popping from version to version posted on the 'Tube, of \"Waters of March\". You've got to admit, that all by itself has much to offer! I just came back here from hearing this instructor-guy, playing it as a somewhat zestier tempo, with a young women, Larissa Viana, who has to be offering up the cutest rendition in recent memory:"
