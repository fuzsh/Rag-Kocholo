        "text": "I. Executive Summary\n\nThe Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo have been plagued for years by violent crime, much of it carried out by illegal drug-trafficking gangs. In Rio, these heavily-armed gangs effectively control hundreds of neighborhoods and are largely responsible for the metropolitan region having one of the highest homicide rates in the hemisphere. In São Paulo, despite an encouraging drop in the homicide rate over the past decade, gang violence also continues to pose a major threat to public security.\n\nIn both states, criminal gangs have carried out brazen attacks, often in broad daylight, against the police, as well as against rival gang members. In May 2006, for example, the First Command of the Capital (Primeiro Comando da Capital) drug faction launched a series of assaults against police posts in São Paulo, gunning down 43 police officers. More recently, in October 2009, 12 people died in a single day during a turf battle between the rival Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and Friends of Friends (Amigos dos Amigos) factions, including two police officers whose helicopter was shot down by one of the gangs. A third officer from the helicopter died in the hospital days later.\n\nReducing violent crime and containing these gangs represents a daunting and at times dangerous challenge for the police forces. Too often, however, rather than curbing the violence, police officers in both states have contributed to it through the unwarranted use of lethal force.\n\nIn nearly all cases in Rio and São Paulo in which police have killed people while on duty, the officers involved have reported the shootings as legitimate acts of self-defense, claiming they shot only in response to gunfire from criminal suspects. In Brazil, these cases are referred to as “resistance” killings. Given that police officers in both states do often face real threats of violence from gang members, many of these “resistance” killings are likely the result of the use of legitimate force by the police. Many others, however, are clearly not.\n\nThe numbers alone are alarming. The Rio and São Paulo police have together killed more than 11,000 people since 2003. In the state of Rio, alleged resistance killings by police reached a record high of 1,330 in 2007. While reported killings decreased to 1,137 in 2008, the number remained alarmingly elevated, as it was the third highest on record for Rio. The number of police “resistance” killings in São Paulo, while less than in Rio, is also comparatively high: over the past five years, for example, there were more police “resistance” killings in São Paulo state (2,176) than police killings of suspects in all of South Africa (1,623), a country with a much higher homicide rate than São Paulo.\n\nAfter a comprehensive, two-year investigation into policing practices in Rio and São Paulo, Human Rights Watch has concluded that a substantial portion of the alleged resistance killings reported in both states are in fact extrajudicial executions. While this unlawful use of force by police is particularly pronounced in Rio, it is also a very serious problem in São Paulo. In addition, some police officers are members of “death squads” (grupos de extermínio) or, in the case of Rio, illegal armed militias, which together are responsible for hundreds of murders each year.\n\nIn many purported “resistance” killings and killings by death squads, police officers take steps to cover up the true nature of the killing, and police investigators often fail to take necessary steps to determine what has taken place, helping to ensure that criminal responsibility cannot be established and that those responsible remain unpunished.\n\nCriminal justice officials, including the attorneys general of both states, recognize that unlawful police killings are a serious problem. Several key public prosecutors insist that extrajudicial executions and subsequent cover ups are commonplace. Indeed, both states have implemented some measures to curb police abuses, such as creating police ombudsman’s offices in the 1990s and, more recently, in the case of São Paulo, establishing a training program in low-lethal defensive policing techniques (known as the “Giraldi method”). In São Paulo, these measures may have contributed to a drop in reported police killings from their overall peak in the 1990s, but they have not come close to eliminating the problem. In Rio, they appear to have had virtually no impact at all.\n\nThe principal reason these reform measures have fallen short is that they have not tackled the fundamental issue of accountability. Police officers responsible for unlawful killings in Rio and São Paulo are rarely brought to justice. Although there has recently been some important progress in the reining of certain high-profile militias in Rio as well as in the arrest of several death squad members in São Paulo, impunity for extrajudicial executions committed by police officers remains the norm.\n\nWhile many factors may contribute to this chronic impunity, one in particular stands out: the criminal justice systems in both states currently rely almost entirely on police investigators to resolve these cases. In other words, the police are left to police themselves. This arrangement is a recipe for continued abuse. So long as it remains unchanged, police impunity will prevail, police homicide rates will stay high, and the states’ legitimate efforts to curb violence and lawlessness will suffer.\n\nIn Brazil, as in many other countries, there is a common misperception that human rights and public security are conflicting priorities. Some believe that investigating and prosecuting police abuses would weaken the hand of law enforcement, and thereby strengthen criminal gangs. They are wrong. Rather than undermining the state police forces, fuller accountability would force them to do their job more effectively, and benefit all of society.\n\nHuman Rights Watch conducted in-depth interviews with more than 40 state and federal government officials. These included the attorneys general as well as key prosecutors and the police ombudsmen in both states. In Rio, we met with the governor, the mayor, and top police officials. In São Paulo, we also met with top police officials. We also interviewed multiple families of victims of police violence, witnesses, and civil society groups.\n\nEvidence drawn from these interviews, as well as from an exhaustive review of scores of case documents and official quantitative data, is the basis for the following findings:\n\nPolice Killings\n\nThere is substantial credible evidence that many persons killed in alleged shootouts with police were in fact executed by the police officers. In most of the 51 “resistance” killing cases that Human Rights Watch focused on, the shootout narratives alleged by the officers appeared to be incompatible with forensic reports documenting certain types of gunshot wounds. In many of these cases, gunshot residue patterns were consistent with the victim having been shot at point blank range.\n\nWhile it is impossible to determine the precise scope of extrajudicial executions by police, official government statistics are consistent with the view of local criminal justice officials that the practice is widespread in both states, and particularly pronounced in certain areas of both capital cities. The high number of alleged resistance killings—11,000 cases since 2003—is all the more dramatic when viewed alongside the comparatively low numbers of non-fatal injuries of civilians and police fatalities in those same incidents or areas of operation.\n\nFor example, the São Paulo Shock Police Command (Comando de Policiamento de Choque) a special operational branch of the military police containing the Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar (ROTA), among other units, killed 305 people from 2004 through 2008 and left only 20 injured. In all of these alleged “shootouts,” the police suffered one death. Similarly, in Rio, units operating in 10 particular military policing zones were responsible for 825 “resistance” killings in 2008 while suffering 12 police fatalities. In one of the zones of operation, police “resistance” killings actually outnumbered all other intentional homicides in 2007.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also examined 23 case files containing witness statements and evidence of certain modi operandi indicating that police-linked death squads or militias were responsible for unlawful killings. Criminal justice officials reported that unlawful killings by police-linked criminal gangs are widespread. In São Paulo, the Police Ombudsman’s Office recorded 541 killings by unknown assailants as potential police death squad homicides from May 2006 through 2008. In Rio, the state security secretary acknowledged that militias contribute substantially to the state’s overall homicide rate, while a 2008 report unanimously approved by the state legislature found that police-linked militias were operating in 171 communities throughout the state.\n\nPolice Cover Ups\n\nAfter fatal shootings by police, officers routinely manipulate, disrupt, or fail to preserve evidence that is vital for determining whether or not the killing was lawful. One common cover-up technique is to remove a shooting victim’s corpse from the crime scene, deliver it to the hospital, and claim that the removal was an attempt to “rescue” the victim. These false “rescues” serve to destroy crime scene evidence while providing a veneer of good faith on the part of the police.\n\nWhen, for example, Rio police killed 19 people in Complexo do Alemão in a single day in 2007, all the shooting victims ended up being taken to the hospital. In at least nine of the killings, police documents state that the victims were taken to the hospital in an attempt to “rescue” them. Yet photographs and autopsy reports obtained by Human Rights Watch leave little doubt that the victims were already dead prior to their removal. In São Paulo, Human Rights Watch identified 17 police shooting victims from May 2006 who, according to autopsy reports, had suffered one or more shots to the brain before police took them to the hospital, purportedly to “rescue” them.\n\nPolice officers often attack or threaten witnesses to discourage them from reporting what they have seen. In April 2009, for example, A.L. filed a criminal complaint against a military police officer in São Paulo, stating that the officer had illegally searched his home, beaten him, and repeatedly threatened him over the course of several weeks. According to A.L., the harassment intensified after he filed the complaint. Two months later, two hooded assailants executed A.L. in the street near his workplace, riddling him with some 32 shots, according to the police and autopsy reports. In Rio, a witness to an alleged wrongful police killing in 2005 told Human Rights Watch he was threatened when he went to the civil police precinct to make a statement: “Police officers told me: ‘Watch what you are going to say.’ A police officer pointed a gun to me and said: ‘Pa-pum, pa-pum,’” the witness told us.\n\nPolice Investigations\n\nPolice investigators routinely fail to conduct proper inquiries into police killings. From the moment of an alleged “resistance” killing, basic tenets of homicide investigation are violated or ignored. These failures result in criminal inquiries that rarely clarify events or provide sufficient evidence to establish criminal responsibility in cases of wrongdoing.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed dozens of police inquiries that suffered from a range of serious shortcomings, such as failure to question all police officers involved in a killing, failure to seek out and interview non-police eyewitnesses, and failure to conduct basic forensic tests, such as crime scene analyses. A detailed examination of 29 inquiries into “resistance killings” by one Rio military police battalion from 2007 through 2008 found that every one of them suffered from all—or nearly all—of these failings.\n\nSuch investigatory failures are not merely the result of limited resources or poor training. Rather, they reflect fundamental conflicts of interest inherent in assigning police investigators the responsibility of investigating police abuse. In the most egregious cases, shooting inquiries are conducted by members of a shooting officer’s own unit. More generally, however, the lack of independence and autonomy of police investigators, as well as an institutional culture that emphasizes loyalty, undermines the impartiality of police inquiries into cases of alleged abuse by fellow police officers.\n\nPolice Impunity\n\nHuman Rights Watch found a broad consensus among non-police criminal justice officials—including the attorneys general of both states—that police officers implicated in extrajudicial executions are rarely brought to justice. In the majority of the cases we reviewed, no police officers were held accountable. Many of the cases had been shelved without even reaching trial or even resulting in criminal charges.\n\nWhile the precise scale of impunity is difficult to determine, the official data that is available lends support to the view that impunity in police abuse cases is the norm. For example, over the past decade, the Rio Police Ombudsman’s Office recorded over 7,800 complaints against police officers concerning criminal conduct; yet those complaints generated only 42 criminal charges by state prosecutors and only four convictions.\n\nAccording to prosecutors in both states, the main cause of this chronic impunity is the absence of crucial evidence, a product of police cover ups and investigatory failures. While Brazilian law grants prosecutors the authority to conduct oversight of police activities, including investigations, their ability to do so is limited by several factors, including problems with crime notification procedures and the system of case allocation among prosecutors, as well as legal and political challenges from the police. Consequently, prosecutors usually rely entirely on investigations carried out by the police investigators, which are often extremely deficient.\n\nKey Recommendations\n\nThe surest way to curb unlawful police killings is to ensure that the officers who commit them are brought to justice. The obstacles that currently prevent or discourage prosecutors from doing so are serious, but not insurmountable. The key to ending chronic police impunity—and thereby deterring future abuses—is to ensure that prosecutors need no longer rely so heavily on police investigators to resolve these cases. As the São Paulo attorney general told Human Rights Watch, “The key problem is in the police investigating members of the police itself.”\n\nToward that end, the Rio and São Paulo prosecutor’s offices should create specialized units with a mandate focused on police killing cases and the personnel, resources, and expertise necessary to effectively ensure proper investigation and prosecution of those cases in collaboration with the prosecutor designated by law (promotor natural). Among other homicides by police, such a unit should systematically review all alleged resistance killings.\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of these special prosecutorial units, other measures should be taken as well, including:\n\nEstablishing a special team of police investigators detailed to the State Prosecutor’s Offices’ new specialized units on police killings cases, and ensuring that these investigators are selected by, as well as fully and exclusively answerable to, the prosecutor’s offices rather than the normal police hierarchy;\n\nRequiring police officers to notify prosecutors of “resistance” killings immediately after they take place (rather than waiting the full 30 days currently allowed by law);\n\nEstablishing and strictly enforcing a proper crime scene protocol that allows gunshot victims to receive proper medical attention but deters police officers from engaging in false “rescues” and other cover-up techniques; and\n\nInvestigating potential police cover up techniques, including false “rescues,” and prosecuting officers who engage in them.\n\nFinally, Human Rights Watch believes that it is crucial for Brazil’s elected leaders to publicly support the prosecutors’ efforts to ensure full accountability for police officers who commit abuses. Moreover, they should publicly challenge the misperception that human rights and public security are conflicting priorities. By demonstrating leadership on this critical issue, they could play a crucial role in curbing police abuses, improving law enforcement in Brazil, and making Brazilian society safer as a whole.\n\nA complete list of detailed recommendations is set forth at the end of this report.\n\nII. Methodology\n\nThis report is based primarily on in-depth analysis of 74 cases of police killings in which there is substantial credible evidence that the killings were unlawful. We selected these cases for detailed study after reviewing documentary and other evidence regarding more than 200 cases of alleged police abuse in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The majority of the cases occurred since 2006, and all of them involve serious physical injury or death. The cases came principally from archives maintained by state prosecutors, officers of the Brazilian Bar Association, state police ombudsmen, and civil society groups.\n\nIn nearly all of the cases selected for in-depth study, we were able to examine official police, forensic, and/or judicial records. For certain cases, we also drew on victim and eyewitness interviews conducted during several trips to Brazil from 2006 through 2009, government statements, NGO reports, and media accounts. Human Rights Watch typically contacted victims and family members of victims through referrals from their legal representatives or local civil society groups, some of which are comprised of family members of victims of police violence. All interviews were conducted by at least one staff member with fluency in Portuguese. No interviewees were provided with remuneration. Finally, we evaluated official police data on police violence and public security in order to assess patterns of abuse.\n\nWe interviewed more than 40 state and federal government officials. These included the state attorney generals and key prosecutors in both states. In Rio, we also met with the governor, the mayor, the security secretary, the chief of the civil police, the commander of the military police, heads of police internal affairs units, and the police ombudsman. In São Paulo, we met with the deputy secretary for public security, top military police commanders, representatives from the Homicide and Protection of Persons precinct, heads of police internal affairs units, and the police ombudsman. In Brasília, we met with the national public security secretary, the national human rights minister, and federal prosecutors specialized in police oversight.\n\nFor security reasons, names of surviving victims, witnesses, and relatives have been abbreviated and changed in the report, and certain details have been omitted to protect their identities (except in the few cases in which those interviewed affirmatively requested to be named).\n\nWhen Human Rights Watch sought to find out the current status of certain cases, we were at times hindered by witnesses’ fears of retaliation, the difficulty of tracking and/or accessing certain police records, and the lack of effective monitoring of police killings by police internal affairs units and prosecutor’s offices.\n\nStefan Schmitt, the director of the International Forensic Program at Physicians for Human Rights, reviewed and provided critical input on the analysis of the forensic issues in this report. Schmitt previously worked for nine years as a forensic analyst at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Crime Lab, and has participated in forensic investigations in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bosnia, Croatia, Guatemala, Honduras, Iraq, Liberia, and Rwanda.\n\nPatrick Ball, Chief Scientist and Vice-President for Human Rights Programs at the Benetech Initiative, reviewed and provided critical input on the analysis of quantitative data in this report. Since 1991, Dr. Ball has designed information management systems and conducted statistical analysis for large-scale human rights data projects used by truth commissions, non-governmental organizations, tribunals and United Nations missions in more than thirty countries around the world.\n\nRio de Janeiro and São Paulo were selected for this study because they are states containing Brazil’s most populous and influential cities, because they face serious security challenges, and because they contain high numbers of police killings each year.\n\nIII. Background\n\nViolence by Criminal Gangs\n\nPolicing Rio and São Paulo is a difficult task. In Rio, hundreds of neighborhoods are effectively under the control of drug factions. In São Paulo, despite an encouraging drop in the homicide rate over the last several years, brazen public attacks by a drug gang in May 2006 revealed the state’s continuing security vulnerabilities.\n\nThere were over 10,000 victims of intentional homicide in Rio and São Paulo combined in 2008. While both states suffer from serious crime, the situation is markedly worse in Rio. In 2008, Rio’s homicide rate (34.50 per 100,000 inhabitants) was significantly higher than São Paulo’s (10.76 per 100,000 inhabitants). The number of robberies per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008 was 854 in Rio and 530 in São Paulo. Drug traffickers in both states routinely engage in violent crime, including in murder, torture and extortion. In Rio, police-linked militias also regularly engage in violent crime in scores of neighborhoods.\n\nIn São Paulo, violence reached a peak in May 2006 when a criminal gang known as the First Command of the Capital (Primeiro Comando da Capital or PCC) carried out more than 100 coordinated attacks against security forces, city buses, and public and financial buildings. The PCC simultaneously organized scores of prison riots. The attacks left 43 police officers dead.\n\nIn Rio, public security is in permanent crisis. One particularly severe crime wave started in December 2006, when drug gangs launched a series of coordinated attacks against police officers, public buses, and public buildings, leaving 19 people dead and 22 wounded. Seven passengers were killed by being burnt alive by criminals inside a bus on a major roadway in Rio; another victim died days later. More recently, in October 2009, drug traffickers shot down a military police helicopter, killing three officers and injuring four others.\n\nThere have been many notoriously cruel episodes of violence perpetrated by drug traffickers. In July 2008 in Rio, drug traffickers staged a “tribunal” in Morro da Mangueira for a 14-year-old girl accused of stealing a cell phone from a taxi driver. As a “sentence,” they shot the girl through her hands. In 2002, drug traffickers caught journalist Tim Lopes in Vila Cruzeiro while he was investigating their promotion of child sexual abuse and other illegal activities. Lopes was tortured and then executed with a samurai sword. In São Paulo, during a prison riot in 2005, drug gang members in Penitentiary 1 in Presidente Venceslau decapitated five fellow prisoners who were considered enemies of the gang.\n\nInadequate Pay and Police Corruption\n\nMilitary and civil police in Rio and São Paulo have very low salaries that do not reflect the challenging nature of their jobs and aggravate problems of corruption and abuse. For example, according to a military police colonel in Rio, a starting military police officer earns less than a low-ranking youth in the drug trade. “A fogueteiro (scout) in drug trafficking gets paid R$1300 per month [roughly US$650],” he told us. “A soldier of the military police, R$1090 [roughly US$545].” Indeed, for years the salary for military police soldiers in Rio has been among the lowest among military police in the country.\n\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions Philip Alston asserted in his 2008 report that low police pay is one factor that has fueled police membership in illegal gangs such as militias. Annually, there are more violent police deaths off-duty than on-duty in Rio and São Paulo.\n\nReform Initiatives\n\nGovernment authorities have taken some practical steps aimed at increasing police professionalism and curbing abuses. For instance, in 1995 São Paulo passed a law creating a Police Ombudsman’s Office to receive and forward public complaints concerning the police. Rio did the same in 1999.\n\nMore recently, the federal government has invested significant funds in the National Program for Public Security with Citizenship (PRONASCI), a national public security program, which includes funds for police training and support for internal affairs divisions. In São Paulo, the Public Security Secretariat—which runs the police—has been implementing training modules on the “Giraldi method,” a technique aimed at lowering police lethality during certain confrontations.\n\nIn Rio, pilot “pacification” programs in a small set of neighborhoods, such as Dona Marta, are being touted by officials as keeping out drug traffickers while lowering police lethality. The programs involve placing a large police contingent in a low-income community on a permanent basis. “We have definitively occupied four communities in distinct neighborhoods,” Rio Security Secretary José Mariano Beltrame states on the official site of the program. Officials claim these few pilot initiatives have been successful. Human Rights Watch did not independently evaluate them.\n\nThough some of these initiatives are positive, none of these measures address the need for systematic external monitoring of police abuses or replace the need for effective investigation and prosecution of crimes committed by the police.\n\nCriminal Justice in Brazil\n\nBrazil has a federal system of government. Criminal law and criminal procedure is legislated at the federal level. Most law enforcement, however, is primarily the responsibility of the states, which fund and run state-level courts, detention centers, and police forces.\n\nPolice in Brazil, therefore, are organized and controlled primarily by states (via security secretariats), rather than at the national or municipal levels. The state police forces are divided into two nearly autonomous entities, the civil and military police. The state governor controls both forces, though the military police are also auxiliary and reserve units of the military. The state civil and military police forces are divided along functional lines.\n\nThe military police are tasked with patrolling the streets, maintaining public order, responding to crimes as they are occurring, and arresting suspects who are caught in the act of committing crimes. The military police is also in charge of investigating military crimes, which are defined as such by the Military Penal Code. Military police officers are generally prosecuted and judged in military courts; among the most notable exceptions to this jurisdictional rule is the crime of intentional homicide of a civilian, for which military officers are tried before civilian courts.\n\nThe civil police conduct criminal investigations in the civilian justice system, including investigations of intentional homicides committed by police against civilians. Each civil police precinct is run by a precinct chief (delegado). A police-led criminal inquiry (inquérito policial) may be initiated by written orders of the appropriate police authority, at the request of the victim or offended party, or by orders of a judge or the Prosecutor's Office (Ministério Público). Once the civil police know of a violation of the penal code, they must take a series of investigatory steps, including going to the crime scene and ensuring that there is “no alteration in the state and conservation of things until the arrival of criminal forensics experts.” Police investigators should collect as many facts as necessary to clarify the crime and circumstances surrounding it, including by taking witness statements and collecting physical evidence.\n\nPolice investigators have 30 days to conclude an investigation before they must send the corresponding case file to the competent judge. The judge (usually at the request of a prosecutor) can repeatedly extend the given deadline for the conclusion of an investigation.\n\nOnce the police have concluded their investigations, they are required to deliver a detailed written report to the competent judge. This report is passed on to the competent prosecutor to determine whether to seek charges (denúncias) against a suspect. If either the prosecutor or the judge believes that further police investigation is necessary, they may order it.\n\nPolice investigations may only be shelved (arquivados) (i.e. indefinitely suspended) by order of the judge, ordinarily at the request of the prosecutor. When a case gets shelved, it is essentially closed. Only in rare circumstances in which new evidence emerges may it be reopened.\n\nIn intentional homicide cases, which fall under the jurisdiction of jury trial courts, the judge should reject a prosecutor’s filings for charges if he or she determines that there is insufficient proof of the existence of a crime (materialidade) or of individual responsibility (autoria) or participation (participação). If, however, the judge believes there is sufficient basis, he or she should issue an indictment (pronúncia).\n\nBrazil’s Obligations Under International Law\n\nUnder international law, Brazil has an obligation to criminalize and prevent the commission of human rights violations, such as torture or extrajudicial executions, by its police forces. It is also obligated to ensure that any violations are promptly, thoroughly, impartially, and independently investigated, that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions, and that victims and/or relatives are provided fair and adequate compensation.\n\nThese obligations derive from international human rights law, including treaty based obligations such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR).\n\nProhibition of Extrajudicial Executions\n\nThe prohibition on summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions is derived from the right to life guarantees under Article 6 of the ICCPR and Article 4 of the ACHR. In this report we use the term “extrajudicial execution” to encompass all right to life violations by law enforcement agents, including not only purposefully unlawful killings but also deaths produced by excessive use of force. Force used by law enforcement is considered excessive when it contravenes the principles of absolute necessity or proportionality, as interpreted in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (Articles 4, 5, 7, and 9) and the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (Article 3).\n\nThe UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions include key points relevant to the right to life violations considered in this report, including inter alia:\n\n“Governments shallprohibit by law all extra-legal, arbitrary, and summary executions and shall ensure that any such executions are recognized as offences under their criminal laws, and are punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the seriousness of such offenses...\n\n“Exceptional circumstances including a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency may not be invoked as a justification of such executions. Such executions shall not be carried out under any circumstances including, but not limited to, situations of internal armed conflict, excessive or illegal use of force by a public official or other person acting in an official capacity or a person acting at the instigation, or with the consent or acquiescence of such person, and situations in which deaths occur in custody...\n\n“Governments shallprohibit orders from superior officers or public authorities authorizing or inciting other persons to carry out any such extralegal, arbitrary or summary executions. All persons shall have the right and the duty to defy such orders. Training of law enforcement officials shall emphasize the above provisions...”\n\nIn addition, prohibitions against torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment apply to Brazil, as do prohibitions against arbitrary detention.\n\nDuty to Investigate and Prosecute Abuses\n\nVictims have a right to a remedy for violations of their rights. In particular the obligation to protect the right to life and the right to a remedy require that an effective investigation be conducted when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force. In cases in which state agents or bodies are involved or implicated, this investigation is to ensure their accountability. The Inter-American Court has stated clearly that “in cases of extra-legal executions, it is essential for the State to effectively investigate deprivation of the right to life and to punish all those responsible, especially when State agents are involved, as not doing so would create, within an environment of impunity, the conditions for such events to recur...” An effective investigation is one which is prompt, thorough, independent, and impartial. It must be capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified under the circumstances and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Officials are also required to provide victims with information about investigations into violations.\n\nThe UN developed a Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions in 1991, which is designed to be a practical exposition of best practices and procedures. Given the pervasive failures in police investigations into police abuse in Rio and São Paulo, this manual is a particularly useful reference, particularly with regard to its guidelines and procedures on proper crime scene investigation, gathering of testimonial evidence, and performance of autopsies, including annexes on the postmortem detection of torture and on sample form diagrams and charts to be used.\n\nAgain, the UN’s Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions provide instructive guidelines. Key provisions include, inter alia:\n\n“There shall be a thorough, prompt and impartial investigationof all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances... The investigative authority shall have the power to obtain all the information necessary to the inquiry. Those persons conducting the investigation shall have at their disposal all the necessary budgetary and technical resources for effective investigation...”\n\n“In order to ensure objective results, those conducting the autopsy must be able to functionimpartially and independently of any potentially implicated persons or organizations or entities...”\n\n“In cases in which the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of lack of expertise or impartiality, because of the importance of the matter, or because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse, and in cases where there are complaints from the family of the victim abuse these inadequacies or other substantial reasons, Governments shall pursue investigations through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure. Members of such a commission shall be chosen for their recognized impartiality, competence, and independence as individuals. In particular, they shall be independent of any institution, agency, or person that may be the subject of the inquiry. The commission shall have the authority to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry and shall conduct the inquiry as provided for under these Principles...\n\n“Governments shall ensure that persons identified by the investigation as having participated in extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions in any territory under their jurisdiction are brought to justice...\n\n“The families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation within a reasonable period of time.”\n\nIV. Police Killings\n\nPolice in the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo have killed a combined total of more than 11,000 people since 2003, according to official statistics. In nearly all such cases, police report the killings as legitimate acts of self-defense in response to gunfire by criminal suspects, what they call “resistance” killings. However, close analysis of case files, statements by officials, and statistical data strongly suggest that a substantial portion of these cases are in fact extrajudicial executions.\n\nIt is lawful for police to use lethal force when absolutely necessary to prevent loss of life and serious injury to themselves or others, provided the force is proportionate to the threat posed. Police officers in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo often do face real threats of violence from members of criminal gangs, and many reported shootout deaths are likely the result of legitimate use of force by officers during confrontations.\n\nNonetheless, Human Rights Watch obtained credible evidence in 51 cases indicating that those killed in “resistance” episodes were in fact victims of extrajudicial executions. In some of the cases, the evidence indicates that the killing occurred after the alleged shootout had ended. In others, the evidence indicates that no “shootout” took place at all. We obviously were only able to examine in detail a small percentage of the 11,000 police killings that have taken place in Rio and São Paulo since 2003, and there are undoubtedly many more cases of extrajudicial execution than those which Human Rights Watch was able to identify.\n\nSeveral key criminal justice officials from both states spoke of the practice of police reporting extrajudicial executions as “resistance” killings as being widespread. São Paulo’s deputy police ombudsman estimated that “80 percent” of police reports of alleged shootout killings raised suspicion of police abuse. A Rio prosecutor with jurisdiction over neighborhoods with some of the highest levels of police killings in the city told Human Rights Watch that he thought “almost all” the scores of “resistance” killing cases he saw annually were “farces.” Even police officials acknowledged to Human Rights Watch that some officers disguise killings as acts of self-defense.\n\nMoreover, official statistics analyzed by Human Rights Watch are consistent with the conclusion that a significant portion of purported “resistance” killings are likely to be extrajudicial executions. Rio police in the city of Duque de Caxias (bordering the city of Rio) killed 103 people in “resistance” killings in 2008, while suffering one police fatality. Disproportionate statistics such as these, many more of which are included below, raise serious doubts about the credibility of claims that legitimate use of lethal force by police in “shootouts” explains the many thousands of killings by police over the last few years.\n\nIn addition, a comparative look at police violence statistics in South Africa and the United States helps reveal just how disproportionate such killings are in the states of Rio and São Paulo, even when compared to other violent places. Over the past five years, for example, there were more police “resistance” killings in São Paulo state (2,176) than police killings of suspects in all of South Africa (1,623), a country with a much higher homicide rate than São Paulo.\n\nSome police officers also commit extrajudicial executions while off-duty. In Rio, police-linked militias dominate scores of neighborhoods in the metropolitan area (Greater Rio) and are responsible for large numbers of killings. In the greater metropolitan area of the city of São Paulo (Greater São Paulo), police-linked death squads are suspected of involvement in over 500 killings since 2006, according to the Police Ombudsman’s Office.\n\n“Resistance” Killings\n\nHuman Rights Watch found credible evidence that police executed their victims in 35 “resistance” killing cases in Rio and 16 cases in São Paulo. The majority of these cases—40 out of 51—occurred since 2006. Most cases are from the metropolitan areas of the two states, with many concentrated in neighborhoods policed by particular units, such as Rio’s 16th military police battalion.\n\nThe terms “account of resistance” from Rio and “resistance followed by death” from São Paulo are used in civil police reports to classify cases of killings by police in which officers claim to have used legitimate force following an individual’s failure to obey a lawful order. Essentially, these classifications denote police killings of persons who allegedly resisted arrest. In all such police reports reviewed by Human Rights Watch, “resistance” killings denoted police killings of individuals whom they claim had engaged in a shootout with them.\n\nIn 33 cases (incidents involving one or more “resistance” killings), police reports claiming the victim was killed in a shootout appeared to be inconsistent with forensic evidence. For instance, in at least 17 cases, gunshot residue patterns on the skin of victims indicates shots were fired at point-blank range (from a distance of less than 50 centimeters), even though such close range shots are not typical of shootouts. (Of all the “resistance” killing cases we reviewed, in only two did officers specifically note that they were very close to the suspects during the alleged confrontations.)\n\nIn several cases, autopsy reports showed gunshot entry wounds to the back of the head or nape of the neck of the victim, injuries that would seem unlikely in most shootout situations but are consistent with executions.\n\nOn May 13, 2006, military police officers of the Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar (ROTA) in São Paulo’s shock troop contingent killed J.T. and E.N. in an alleged resisting arrest episode. According to police, the victims were robbing a car when they were confronted by police in what turned into a chase; the victims then allegedly stepped out of the car, opened fire against the police vehicle, and were killed by return fire from the officers.\n\nHowever, an autopsy report showed that one of the victims was shot at point blank range. Furthermore, no gunshot residue was found on the hands of the victims (a positive finding would have been consistent with their having used firearms prior to their deaths, as alleged by the police). There were also no bullet markings on the police vehicle as a result of the alleged firefight.\n\nWitness evidence also weighed against the officers. A witness saw one of the victims being detained by the ROTA approximately two hours prior to the alleged shootout in a location 45 minutes away from where the killing took place. Finally, according to witnesses, the individual who officers claimed had been at the wheel of the allegedly stolen car did not know how to drive.\n\nA São Paulo prosecutor charged the officers with homicide and charged the owner of the car with conspiring in an elaborate set-up involving two other unidentified persons, all staged to cover up the murders. He called the killings, “an act typical of a death squad [grupo de extermínio],” since, “the military police officers wanted to take revenge upon individuals with criminal records because of the PCC attacks against state security forces.” A judge accepted charges against the officers (though rejected them against the owner of the car).\n\nOver 1000 officers from state and federal forces carried out a large-scale police operation in Rio’s Complexo do Alemão starting in May 2007. Some of these officers had been tasked with securing the city in advance of the July Pan-American Games. Numerous police killings over several weeks culminated in 19 alleged “resistance” killings in a single day on June 27, 2007.\n\nThough the police alleged that they had only killed in self-defense during shootouts, autopsy records strongly suggest that several of the victims were extrajudicially executed. Five of the 19 victims suffered shots at point blank range. Two of the 19 suffered shots exclusively from behind, and nine others were also shot in the back (four of them in the back of the head or neck).\n\nFurthermore, a federal panel of forensic experts asserted that forensic evidence indicated that at least two of the victims were shot while lying flat on their backs. The forensics panel—appointed by the federal government’s Special Human Rights Secretariat to investigate the killings —concluded “with certainty, that several of the deaths were the result of a procedure of summary and arbitrary execution.”\n\nIn May 2006 in São Paulo, civil police officers killed W.R. and P.B. in an alleged firefight. W.R., according to police, was a PCC gang leader in the Vale do Paraíba area of São Paulo state. Police allege the men formed part of a group that had plans to bomb public buildings in the area. The autopsy of P.B. shows wounds compatible with execution: one shot between the eyes at point blank range and another shot at point blank range in the center of the mouth. P.B. was also shot two other times in the head (once on top and once in the center of his forehead). He was further shot three other places on his body.\n\nOfficers of the 16th military police battalion in Rio killed R.S. and G.T. on September 9, 2007, in an alleged resistance killing. Forensic evidence raises doubts about the officers’ stories. R.S. was shot twice, once in the back of the head with an upward trajectory, a wound typical of an execution.\n\nRio prosecutor Alexandre Themístocles de Vasconcelos provided Human Rights Watch with evidence in 13 “resistance” killing cases in which forensic evidence showed circumstances of death that he concluded were inconsistent with the the police’s claim that the victims had died in shootouts. Examples of these cases include the following:\n\nOfficers of the 16th military police battalion in Rio killed 17-year-old M.I. on June 16, 2007, in an alleged resistance killing. M.I. was shot six times, twice in the back and once from under 50 centimeters away.\n\nOfficers of the 16th military police battalion in Rio killed S.U. on September 1, 2007, an alleged resistance killing. S.U. was shot twice at a range of less than 50 centimeters, according to his autopsy report.\n\nOfficers of the 16th military police battalion in Rio killed D.L. on April 4, 2008, in an alleged resistance killing. D.L. was shot four times and all four shots were to the back of his body.\n\nOfficers of the 16th military police battalion in Rio killed M.E. and R.R. on February 14, 2008, in alleged resistance killings. Both victims were shot once. M.E. was shot in the back, and R.R. was shot at a range of less than 50 centimeters.\n\nIn at least 21 cases Human Rights Watch reviewed, witness accounts support a finding of extrajudicial execution. (The number may be higher, as in many cases we had access to some official documents but not the entire case file.)\n\nExamples of cases containing witness evidence suggesting that an extrajudicial execution had occurred include:\n\nIn December 2006, Rio police killed R.A. in alleged “resistance” episode. The two civil police officers involved claimed that they shot R.A. in self-defense during a firefight between them and a group of four men to which R.A. belonged. The police officers involved also claimed that R.A. had not died at the scene and that they had tried to save his life by taking him to the hospital. However, the mother of R.A.’s girlfriend told Human Rights Watch that she saw police shoot him when he was kneeling and had his hands up in surrender while begging for his life.\n\nIn July 2008, police killed C.M. and B.N. in an alleged shootout following a car robbery that resulted in a chase and stopped after a crash. However, amateur video of the incident taken by a bystander shows C.M. raising his hands out of the car in surrender before an officer grabbed him and pulled him through the car window by the neck. The video then shows C.M. dead on the ground.\n\nIn March 2009, police in São Paulo killed I.W. in an alleged shootout. Police stated I.W. and another man had been fleeing the scene of a building where they had committed a robbery. A neighborhood resident testified to the Police Ombudsman’s Office that she witnessed the moment of the shooting, along with other residents of her building. According to her, police had subdued the suspects, who were lying on the ground unarmed, before shooting I.W.\n\nIn June 2003, I.M. was shot and killed by Rio military police officers. Police allege that I.M. had initiated a firefight with them and that they killed him in self-defense. However, two witnesses, corroborated by accounts of others, testified before police investigators that they saw I.M. being detained by police officers hours before the alleged encounter and that police had put him in a squad car along with two other youths. I.M. was shot once in the back. The corpses of the other two youths detained at the same time as I.M. later turned up with gunshot wounds in a canal in Pavuna.\n\nFurthermore, many alleged “resistance” killing cases we reviewed contained evidence of attempted cover ups by police officers. As discussed in greater detail in the next chapter, police who commit extrajudicial executions routinely feign rescue attempts of their victims, removing their corpses from police shooting crime scenes and destroying valuable forensic evidence.\n\nWidespread Scope of Extrajudicial Executions\n\nThe failure of Brazilian authorities to thoroughly and systematically investigate police killings in which the victims are alleged to have resisted arrest makes it difficult to give a precise estimate of how many such cases are actually extrajudicial executions. However, several key criminal justice officials in both states who work with these cases told Human Rights Watch that they believed the problem is widespread.\n\nIn Rio, prosecutor Alexandre Themístocles de Vasconcelos—responsible for receiving a substantial portion of police case files in the two areas in Rio with the highest level of number of police killings—told us that he thought “almost all” of the alleged resistance killing cases he saw were “farces.” Rio Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Human Rights Leonardo Cháves also spoke of unlawful “resistance” killings as a very serious problem in Rio. At the São Paulo Police Ombudsman’s Office, the deputy ombudsman estimated that “80 percent” of police reports of alleged shootout killings raised suspicion of police abuse. São Paulo prosecutor Carlos Cardoso, former human rights aide to the attorney general from 1998 through 2008, said police “with high frequency” forged shootouts to mask executions through the use of planted evidence.\n\nAn independent forensic scientist has estimated on the basis of autopsy reports that 60 to 70 percent of 124 persons killed by police in São Paulo during the May 2006 attacks in alleged resistance cases bore signs of having been the victims of executions rather than of shootouts.\n\nEven top police officials in both states acknowledged that extrajudicial executions by police are an ongoing problem, though not all accepted that it is widespread. The Rio security secretary, who supervises the police, José Mariano Beltrame, acknowledged in a meeting with Human Rights Watch regarding police alleged resistance killings that “these executions do exist.” When asked, neither he, the head of the civil police, the commander of the military police, nor the head of the police General Unified Internal Affairs unit could provide us with an estimate of what proportion of alleged resistance killing cases were executions in Rio. Asked about whether there was such an estimate, Secretary Beltrame shook his head.\n\nIn São Paulo, the then head of civil police internal affairs and current chief of the civil police, Alberto Angerami, similarly acknowledged the use of resisting arrest reports to mask executions on the part of the military police, particularly the ROTA unit. The then deputy public security secretary of São Paulo, Guilherme Bueno de Camargo, did not deny that alleged resistance killings sometimes masked executions, but claimed that police abuse “is the exception.” When asked, he was unable to provide a more precise official estimate of how many alleged resistance killings were illegitimate.\n\nGovernment statistics on police killings support the view of those officials who assert that extrajudicial executions are indeed widespread. The high number of alleged resistance killings recorded in both states is particularly dramatic when viewed alongside the total numbers of “regular” murders, arrests, police fatalities, and persons non-fatally injured by police.\n\nMoreover, a comparative look at police violence statistics in South Africa and the United States (US) helps reveal just how disproportionate such killings are in the states of Rio and São Paulo, even when compared to other violent places.\n\nSouth Africa is a particularly compelling comparison because it has a higher homicide rates than the states of Rio or São Paulo (in “financial year” 2008/2009, the murder rate in South Africa was 37.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, while in Rio and São Paulo in 2008 the intentional homicide rate was 34.5 and 10.76 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). This is relevant since police lethality is often argued to be a product of high crime. South Africa is also known to have high levels of police violence. The US provides another useful comparison given that it is a developed country with significant levels of police violence.\n\nTotal Police Killings\n\nWe use the term “police killings” here to refer to on-duty killings by police in alleged confrontations. In the state of Rio, alleged resistance killings by police reached a record high of 1,330 in 2007. While reported police killings decreased to 1,137 in 2008, the number remained alarmingly elevated, the third highest on record for Rio. In the state of São Paulo, though the number of on-duty alleged resistance killings was significantly lower than in recent peak years such as 2002 and 2003 (609 and 787, respectively), it remained high and relatively constant between 2007 and 2008 (401 and 397, respectively). In contrast, the total number of police killings in the entire United States during this time period was 371 and in South Africa was 468. (In just the first 10 months of 2009, São Paulo police killed 455 people in “resistance” episodes and is thus on track to surpass the most recent South Africa figure. In Rio, police killed 805 people in “resistance” cases in the first nine months of 2009. )\n\nFigure 1:\n\nPopulation\n\nPolice killed 6.86 people per 100,000 inhabitants in Rio in 2008, while police in São Paulo killed 0.97; by contrast, police in South Africa killed 0.96 people per 100,000 inhabitants and police in the US killed 0.12 people. The quantity of killings by police per capita in Rio de Janeiro in particular suggests a highly elevated lethality.\n\nFigure 2:\n\nOther Intentional Homicides\n\nFor every 100 other intentional homicides/murders (i.e., “regular” killings not counting killings by on-duty police officers in “resistance”-type cases) that occurred in 2008, the police in Rio state killed 19.89 people and the police in São Paulo state killed 8.46. By contrast, police killed 2.58 people for every 100 murders in South Africa and 2.62 for every 100 in the US. (The numbers for Rio and São Paulo would be even higher if it were possible to count the number of killings by police who were off-duty. )\n\nThe substantially higher ratio in Rio and São Paulo casts doubt on the possibility that police violence in these states is merely a reflection of the general levels of violence in each place.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nOn-Duty Police Killed\n\nIn Rio, police killed 43.73 people for every officer killed on duty in 2008. In São Paulo, police killed 18.05 people for every on-duty officer killed in 2008. By contrast, police in the US killed 9.05 people for every officer killed. (We were unable to find comparable disaggregated on-duty police fatality figures for South Africa.) Though differences in training, tactical support, and other factors may to some degree account for differences in the number of people police kill in shootouts per fatality their suffer, the large police killing to fatality ratios in Rio and São Paulo are consistent with the suspicion that in many cases police falsely report killings as having been produced in confrontations that did not actually occur.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nPersons Non-Fatally Injured by Police\n\nEvery year for the last three years, São Paulo military police officers have killed more people in alleged “resisting arrest” episodes than they have injured. In 2008, the on-duty military police killed 371 people in “resistance” cases, while injuring 283 in these cases. The fact that police in the city of São Paulo kill more persons than they injure in such episodes appears to run counter to the historical norm in Brazil. As noted by investigative journalist Caco Barcellos in his 1992 book on police violence in São Paulo, “[t]he history of combat in Brazil consolidated an average ratio of four survivors for every fatal victim.”\n\nThis indicator, consistent with police excessive use of force, is most pronounced among military police units operating in São Paulo city and in Greater São Paulo. It is alarmingly acute in relation to the São Paulo shock troop contingent, as described below.\n\nThe Ten Most Lethal Military Police Battalions in Rio de Janeiro\n\nOver 70 percent of all “resistance” killings by police in Rio in 2008 occurred in 10 of the state’s 40 Integrated Areas of Public Security (AISPs). Statistics from these 10 geographic zones, which are noted in Table 1 below, show that in alleged resistance killings in each of those neighborhoods, at least 10 and as many as 103 persons are killed for every police officer killed. The disparities are greatest in the neighborhoods policed by certain military police battalions.\n\nThe 10 areas listed in Table 1 below are large and generally contain high levels of crime. Together they accounted for 44 percent of Rio de Janeiro’s population and about 53 percent of the state’s murders in 2008. They also contained a large proportion of the state’s police killings. Together they accounted for 825 killings in 2008, or 73 percent of all official police killings in the whole state. This is nearly as many as the combined total of police killings in the United States and South Africa in 2008.\n\nTable 1: For a more complete table including names of the respective cities, neighborhoods, civil police precincts, and correlations with areas of known militia activity, see Appendix I.\n\nTwelve officers were killed on-duty in these 10 areas in Rio in 2008, a testament to the fact that policing these locations is a challenging task. But 12 on-duty police deaths contrasted with the 825 “resistance” killings by the police in these areas casts doubt on how many of these hundreds of killings were lawful. For every officer who died on-duty in these 10 zones, police killed nearly 69 people, all of whom were supposedly resisting arrest, typically alleged to be actively firing upon the officers. That kill/casualty ratio is highly dubious for even the most well-trained, well-equipped force under regular conditions. In one extreme example, police in the area of the 14th Military Police Battalion killed 74 people in alleged resistance shootings in 2008. No on-duty officers were killed. In the area of the 15th Military Police Battalion, police killed 103 people and suffered one on-duty fatality.\n\nThe 16th military police battalion in particular is associated with extremely elevated police violence statistics. In an unprecedented occurrence, in 2007, police killings in the area patrolled by the 16th battalion (171 in total) actually outnumbered other intentional homicides (170 in total). In other words, police were responsible for the majority of all intentional homicides in the 16th policing zone of Rio in 2007.\n\nThe commander of the 16th Military Police Battalion for much of 2007, Colonel Marcus Jardim, publicly called the military police the “best social insecticide.” In February 2008, he was promoted to top commander of military police forces for the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nEven taking into account the fact that police in the 16th AISP operate in some of the most dangerous areas of Rio, the volume of police killings there is extremely high. One interesting comparison is between Rio’s 16th AISP and Ceilândia, one of the most violent areas near Brasília, in the Distrito Federal. In several key ways (population, homicide rate, fatal robbery rate, and drug-related crime rate), the 16th AISP in Rio was statistically similar to Ceilândia in 2007. However, there was a substantial difference between the numbers of alleged resistance killings in each area. While police in Ceilândia killed two persons who allegedly resisted arrest in 2007, the number of so-called “resistance killings” by police in Rio’s 16th policing zone that year was 171, a per capita rate nearly 60 times that of Ceilândia.\n\nTable 2\n\nBy making this comparison, Human Rights Watch does not intend to equate the security situation of the 16th policing zone in Rio with those of Ceilândia. Among other factors, the Distrito Federal police do not have to confront as many heavy armaments as their counterparts in Rio. However, the difference in police killings between these two areas is so stark that it undermines the argument that the Rio 16th battalion’s frequent use of lethal force is proportionate to the threat faced.\n\nROTA: One of São Paulo’s Most Lethal Military Police Units\n\nFrom 2004 through 2008, São Paulo’s Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar (ROTA) killed 305 people while on-duty, all during alleged “resisting arrest” episodes. During the same period, the unit injured 20 people during these “resisting arrest” encounters. This means that the unit killed roughly 15 people for every individual they non-fatally injured in these supposed firefights, an inversion of the typical pattern in armed confrontations, where more people are usually injured than killed over time, as previously discussed. Moreover, the unit suffered exactly one on-duty fatality in the same five year period.\n\nFigure 6:\n\nThis disparity was particularly dramatic in the aftermath of the May 2006 attacks by the First Command of the Capital (PCC) in São Paulo. The São Paulo shock troop contingency officially killed 47 individuals that month, left none injured, and suffered no on-duty casualties.\n\nKillings by Death Squads and Militias\n\nMany police officers in both Rio and Sao Paulo are also alleged to be members of illegal criminal gangs, commonly referred to as death squads (grupos de extermínio) in São Paulo and militias in Rio. These gangs routinely commit extrajudicial executions. Human Rights Watch reviewed evidence in multiple case files of suspected death squad killings from São Paulo over the past three years and found credible evidence of police officer involvement as perpetrators and in covering up the murders. We also found credible evidence of police-linked militia killings in Rio. Criminal justice officials in both states reported that the problem of police-linked gangs continues to be widespread, despite valuable steps taken to confront it.\n\nSão Paulo’s Death Squads\n\nThough police-linked death squads have long been active in São Paulo, the number of cases of suspected death squad killings increased from 2006 through 2008. Since May 2006, the state’s Police Ombudsman’s Office has documented 541 killings in 266 cases it suspects were “supposedly carried out by so-called extermination groups.” Human Rights Watch reviewed evidence in 21 cases of killings since 2006 containing credible evidence of police death squad involvement in São Paulo.\n\nFollowing the initial days of the May 2006 attacks by the PCC in São Paulo, suspected death squads composed of police officers committed a wave of extrajudicial executions, according to the police ombudsman. For example:\n\nOn May 14, 2006, a group of men in ski masks killed five people and wounded one in the neighborhood of São Mateus. The assailants detained their victims outside a bar, lined them up against a wall, and executed them with shots to the head. One of the shooters collected the discharged bullet casings.\n\nA group of military police officers arrived minutes later and removed the bodies of the victims, only one of whom, according to witnesses, showed any signs of life. All of the bodies were naked at autopsy, indicating that key clothing evidence had, at a minimum, not been safeguarded. Military police did not preserve what remained of the crime scene after the bodies were removed, hindering the investigation. Blood on the ground at the scene was even washed away before investigators arrived (the police alleged this was done by a resident, while press accounts pointed to the police).\n\nThe Homicide and Protection of Persons Precinct (DHPP) of the São Paulo civil police took on the case and concluded that it “had no doubt that the perpetrators were military police officers” attempting to kill PCC drug traffickers thought to be responsible for the murder of a fellow officer earlier that day.\n\nThe same day in the Parque Bristol neighborhood of São Paulo, four men in an unmarked car wearing ski masks shot and killed F.B., E.D., and S.L. and injured F.O. and E.W.\n\nF.O., who survived, was reportedly pulled out of the hospital by military police officers in early morning hours of May 15 (the day after the attack), according to relatives and friends of victims of the attack (F.O. himself was apparently too scared to give direct interviews about the events). F.O. was said to have been in a hospital gown and still bleeding when police put him in the back of a police car and took him to a local precinct to testify about the shooting. In that testimony, F.O. essentially stated he did not see much during the shooting. The officers who had reportedly taken him from the hospital remained present during his testimony, according to relatives and friends of the victims.\n\nIn December 2006, the DHPP summoned F.O. to give his testimony again. Soon after, F.O. was gunned down in a drive-by shooting involving an unmarked car.\n\nThe São Mateus and Parque Bristol killings were not isolated incidents. The São Paulo Ombudsperson’s Office examined 54 homicide cases totaling 89 fatal victims of suspected death squads. The ombudsman identified a particular modus operandi in many of the killings: armed men in ski masks arrive on motorcycles or in unmarked cars with tinted windows and gun down victims.\n\nThe Ombudsman’s Office also noted as evidence of police collusion the fact that, in many cases, the shooters would be followed closely in time by the arrival of uniformed military police officers, who disturbed the crime scene, removing bodies and sometimes other evidence like cartridge casings.\n\nDeath squad activity has continued in São Paulo since 2006. For instance:\n\nIn the February 2007 Limão case, in the northern zone of the city of São Paulo, a pair of assailants who had been driving a Fiat Palio killed six young men and wounded another with gunfire. The shooters lined the victims up with their backs facing them before shooting them, and then fled the scene in the Fiat. São Paulo’s specialized homicide team, the DHPP unit, stated that 27 witnesses—including the sole survivor as well as eyewitnesses, many of whom had no relationship to the victims—confirmed the following facts: a military police ROTA car escorted the Fiat Palio to a street near the scene prior to the shooting; the assailants emerged from the Fiat with jackets labeled “police” and carried out the crime; and the same ROTA car escorted the Fiat away from the scene immediately after the killings.\n\nIn October 2008, in Mauá, two assailants in a car with tinted windows drove up to two men and one youth, got out of the car, and opened fire, killing all three victims. According to the Ombudsman’s Office, witnesses stated that the shooters identified themselves as military police officers prior to shooting; witnesses also said that other military police officers then arrived at the scene and removed cartridge casings prior to the arrival of the forensics teams, which found only one casing on the scene though over 20 shots were reportedly fired. The police ombudsman has received at least eight complaints of homicides in Mauá in which death squads are suspected.\n\nOne death squad in São Paulo targeted a top military police official who was investigating their activities:\n\nMilitary Police Colonel José Hermínio Rodrigues, commander of the military police for the northern zone of São Paulo, was killed in 2008 by a death squad alleged to be comprised of officers from the 18th military police battalion, which came to be known as the “killers of the 18th.” Prior to his killing, the colonel had been investigating death squad links to gambling rings in the northern zone of Greater São Paulo.[167] He had proposed that 56 military police officers be fired in the course of his investigations, but reportedly received little support from the military police internal affairs unit; he had also sought help from the civil police’s DHPP unit. In January 2008, Colonel Hermínio was shot six times while doing his morning exercises in Mandaqui. Forensic firearms examinations received by the São Paulo’s Homicide and Protection of Persons Precinct (DHPP) matched one of the guns used by the assailants to a gun used in the massacre of six people in June 2007. The DHPP’s work led to the arrest of Military Police Officer Pascoal Santos Lima (nicknamed “the Monster”), a man who has been linked to 16 other homicides since 2005, according to an official Police Ombudsman report.\n\nThe death squad killing of Colonel Hermínio forced the São Paulo government to acknowledge the existence of such groups and led to some limited but positive efforts to combat the problem. One month after the killing, São Paulo Governor José Serra acknowledged the existence of death squads and announced his opposition to them: “We do not condone [death] squads; we do not condone extermination groups; we are combating them.” Police also stepped up their investigations into death squads and arrested military police officers suspected of involvement in the “Killers of the 18th” death squad in the northern zone of São Paulo.\n\nMonths later, civil police investigators arrested members of another police death squad in the southwestern zone of Greater São Paulo.\n\nMilitary police officers in Itapecerica da Serra were identified by civil police investigators in 2009 as members of a group known as the “Highlanders.” The group earned its nickname due to its grisly practice of removing the heads of its victims (this was a practice in the 1986 fictional film called “Highlander”).\n\nBy March 2009, 15 men, 14 of whom were military police officers, were arrested in relation to multiple homicides in Taboão da Serra as a result of a civil police investigation. The inquiry led to evidence that military police officers (the majority of whom were members of the 37th Military Police Battalion in São Paulo) were involved in the Highlanders death squad, thought to be responsible for at least 12 murders. The final report of the civil police investigators from Taboão da Serrá concluded that police officers were part of an “extermination group,” which ran extortion schemes by forcing individuals with criminal records to pay them bribes.\n\nDespite the arrests of suspected death squad members in some high profile cases, progress in eliminating the death squads and holding their members accountable has been limited.\n\nAccording to the São Paulo Police Ombudsman’s Office, killings by unidentified assailants bearing the characteristics of possible death squad activity actually increased from 80 in 2007 to 98 in 2008. In the first semester of 2009, the police ombudsman identified or received complaints of 32 homicides by unknown assailants suspected of being police officers.\n\nRio’s Militias\n\nPolice-linked militias —armed groups which control dozens of neighborhoods in Rio, extorting residents through “security taxes” and running other illicit businesses—are responsible for numerous extrajudicial executions. Militias are now a major source of homicides as well as other crimes in Rio, including torture, corruption, extortion, and—in some cases—drug trafficking.\n\nIn December 2008, a unanimously-approved Rio state Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry report (CPI report) found that hundreds of militia members in Rio control a sizeable number of communities. Militias control a staggering 171 neighborhoods in the state of Rio de Janeiro (118 of them in the city).\n\nAll of the officials we spoke with agreed that militias are responsible for a large number of killings in Rio. Rio Security Secretary José Mariano Beltrame told the CPI that the militias represent one of the greatest concrete security threats to the state. In 2009, Secretary Beltrame told Human Rights Watch that a spike in homicides in Favela Batan was due to the militias resisting a large-scale police operation there.\n\nMilitias routinely engage in abuses. One well-known example of militia abuses comes from Favela Batan in May 2008, when a resident and three employees of the newspaper O Dia conducting an undercover investigation into militia activities were kidnapped and tortured by militia members. The captives endured beatings, suffocation, electric shocks, Russian roulette, threats of sexual assault, and death threats. The episode led to the rapid approval of the state Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry that produced the December 2008 militias report mentioned above.\n\nOther locations infamous for militia activities include Campo Grande, Jacarepaguá, and the Baixada Fluminense. In the latter, police suspect that a militia led by a military police officer has been involved in over 100 killings.\n\nMany other areas in Rio suffering from police-linked militia violence do not receive as much attention. For example, Human Rights Watch gathered several credible reports of killings and other serious crimes committed by the militia in the Quitungo neighborhood in Brás de Pina in the northern zone of the city of Rio (Quitungo militia). The Rio Police Ombudsman’s Office, has received several complaints regarding homicides by this militia since 2006, including the following:\n\nSeptember 2006 case file: A caller tells the Rio Police Ombudsman’s Office that over a year earlier, police officers arrived at the community “killing the residents without any reasons and organizing parties [baile] on the Estrada do Quitungo, Brás de Pina, in the old Quitungo favela.” He further adds that “the murders occur between 3:00 and 5:00 in the morning at the Rua Castro Menezes, corner with Surui, known as the (Cova da Onça).” Residents supposedly pay the militia for “protection,” which is a typical method of extortion by militias. Four police officers are named by the complainant.\n\nJanuary and February 2007 case files: A caller states that, at a street party in May 2006 known as the “Police Dance” on the Estrada do Quitungo, four military police had an argument with a youth named A.U., after which they led him away from the party. A.U.’s friends were reportedly threatened and left the party. A.U.’s body was found dead the next day in nearby Cordovil with a gunshot wound to his face.\n\nThe General Unified Internal Affairs unit of the police eventually confirmed, in August 2007, that A.U.’s body had indeed been found in the neighborhood in question at the time indicated by the caller.\n\nSeptember 2007 case file: A complainant calls about a homicide supposedly committed by the alleged head of the Quitungo militia, a military police officer, on the Estrada do Quitungo, “near the Cruzeiro do Sul Garage, in Brás de Pina.” The officer in the case apparently registered it as an alleged “resistance” killing. In the police report of the incident, the named police officer claimed he killed in self-defense after being subjected to an “unjust aggression” in a shootout. The victim was taken to the hospital by the police in an alleged attempt to rescue him, but he was dead.\n\nAccording to a study by Justiça Global, over a period of 28 months ending in April 2008, the Rio crime reporting hotline received 92 complaints relating to police-linked militias in the area of Brás de Pina, which contains the Conjunto do Quntungo neighborhood.\n\nFurthermore, the CPI report found that a militia known as the “Galactics” operates at the Conjunto Habitacional do Quitungo neighborhood. In existence since late 2004, the militia kills and extorts the community with mafia-like tactics, earning money by insisting residents pay a “security tax” and charging for natural gas and illicit cable television provision. The militia is said to have 30 members, including civil and military police officers and civilians. Their leaders, said to be one current civil police officer and one former police officer, are named in the CPI report, as are eight other members (at least two of the names are relatively rare and match those of officers repeatedly named in complaints to the ombudsman). Officers in two nearby civil police precincts (numbers 27 and 38), entrusted with investigating crime in the area, are noted in the CPI report as being “complicit” in the actions of the militia.\n\nSince the CPI report was issued, Rio authorities have taken significant steps to combat militias, including arresting over 200 suspected militia members.\n\nOperations coordinated by the current head of the Civil Police Precinct for the Repression of Organized Crime (DRACO), Cláudio Ferraz, in dialogue with other institutions, including the legislature, have produced many arrests of suspected militia members. According to numbers provided to us by Secretary Beltrame in July 2009, arrests of persons for involvement in militia activities have gone up significantly in his years as secretary—from 24 in 2007, to 77 in 2008, and finally to 149 in roughly the first six months of 2009. Under the prior government, only five individuals were arrested for militia involvement in all of 2006. Several key militias, such as the so-called “Justice League,” have been weakened by the arrests. However, many other smaller (but still violent) militias, such as the Quitungo militia, continue to operate with little hindrance. The Chief of the Rio Civil Police told Human Rights Watch in July 2009 that police had arrested the militia’s leader in Quitungo. He claimed other investigations into the group were still ongoing because the police were prioritizing larger militias.\n\nWhile some progress has been made, even police acknowledge that militias continue to operate. Indeed, as Rio Secretary of Human Rights and Social Assistance Benedita da Silva told Human Rights Watch in April 2009, militias continue to present a significant security challenge to the state. Examples of ongoing militia violence include the following:\n\nIn August 2009, a military police officer within Governor Sérgio Cabral’s personal security detail was discovered to be a suspected militia member linked to a quadruple homicide that month. The governor publicly expressed outrage at the finding and ordered an investigation. The discovery showed the continued vulnerability of the state in the face of the militia threat, even at the highest levels.\n\nIn a May 2009 raid on a Rio das Pedras militia, police found assassination plans drawn up by militia members targeting state legislator and former president of the CPI Marcelo Freixo, along with key aide Vinícius George of the civil police. Both men have personal security details due to the numerous death threats they have received as a result of their anti-militia work.\n\nV. Police Cover Ups\n\nAfter fatal shootings by police, officers routinely manipulate, disrupt, or fail to preserve evidence that is vital for determining whether or not a killing was lawful. Human Rights Watch documented the repeated use of cover-up techniques in police killing cases: false “rescues,” planting of evidence, and witness intimidation.\n\nFalse “rescues” occur when police take the corpses of their shooting victims to hospitals and, in the process, destroy crime scene evidence and hinder the capacity for forensic analyses. Police sometimes also remove or fail to safeguard these victims’ clothing, which can provide vital clues regarding the circumstances of death. This is particularly relevant when there are reasons to believe that a victim has been shot at close range and a gunshot residue analysis of clothing could establish such a fact. While it is impossible to determine the precise scope of false “rescues,” the practice is recognized by criminal justice officials (other than police), health officials, and Rio community members as a widespread modus operandi through which police destroy physical evidence of unlawful killings.\n\nPolice officers also sometimes plant false evidence to create the impression that a shootout has taken place, or to otherwise incriminate their victims. This includes planting guns in the hands of victims and firing them so as to leave gunshot residue on them compatible with their having engaged in a firefight.\n\nFinally, police officers often intimidate or attack witnesses of abuse. Witnesses are sometimes threatened both by the officers involved in abuses as well as by the officers who are supposed to be investigating the abuses. The resulting fear of the police makes witnesses hesitant to report any abuses to investigators.\n\nFalse “Rescues”\n\nPolice officers in both Rio and São Paulo routinely remove deceased victims of police shootings from crime scenes and deliver them to hospitals in what they claim are “rescue” attempts. While these false “rescues” give the appearance of legitimate effort by officers to help victims, in reality they disrupt crime scene evidence prior to the arrival of forensic teams.\n\nNotwithstanding the specific duties of police to rescue live victims, there is no duty to take already deceased shooting victims to the hospital. On the contrary, when police encounter a deceased individual, their duty under the law as well as standards in place in Rio and São Paulo is to preserve the scene of the incident and await the arrival of forensic experts. But this almost never happens in cases in which the police are the shooters.\n\nIn nearly all of the scores of alleged resistance killing cases we examined, police removed deceased victims from the scene of the shooting and delivered their corpses to hospitals. Police typically claimed that they removed the victims in an effort to rescue them from imminent death. However, Human Rights Watch reviewed evidence—such as autopsy reports, photographs, and witness accounts—in numerous cases indicating the victims had died from their gunshot wounds at the scene prior to the removal and transportation of the body to the hospital.\n\nIn the 2007 Complexo do Alemão case, in which Rio police killed 19 individuals in a single day, police and medical files show that all the victims were taken to hospitals. However, evidence reviewed by Human Rights Watch suggest that many victims were subjected to “false” rescue attempts by police officers by having their corpses taken away from the crime scene and driven to hospitals.\n\nPolice documents for at least nine of the victims state that they were taken to the hospital in an attempt to “rescue” them. (Recordkeeping was poor in the files of the other victims and they contain no information as to who dropped the bodies off at hospitals. )\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed autopsy records and more than 100 photographs indicating that the victims appeared to have died at the scene of the shooting, before they were taken to hospitals. In the images, the victims appear to be lying lifeless and unattended in parts of Complexo do Alemão prior to their removal. Analyzed together, the evidence leaves little doubt that the victims were dead prior to their removal to the hospital.\n\nIn the aftermath of the April 2008 civil police shooting of C.L. in Rio, press photos showed C.L. lying seemingly dead on the street surrounded by police and others yet officers removed his body from the scene and took it to a hospital before forensic investigators arrived. One photo shows civil police removing C.L.’s body from the scene in a bed sheet. C.L. was then taken by police to the hospital. C.L.’s death certificate supports the view that his wounds, which included a shot to the cranium, were likely to have resulted in death at the scene. His sister, who viewed his body at the hospital, testified to the Brazilian Bar Association that a “large section of his head had been destroyed as a result of innumerable gunshots.”\n\nIn August 2008, a television news cameraman happened to be present after police shot at a car containing C.C. and his apparent kidnapper, R.L., in Rio. Police later alleged that R.L. shot at them during a car chase and that they did not know that the other passenger was a kidnapping victim. The cameraman filmed the police approaching the stopped vehicle after the shooting. An officer took C.C., who was still breathing at the time, out of the passenger’s seat and dropped him to the ground. The officer then kicked C.C. out of the way as he searched the car. Other officers then dragged C.C. along the ground to a vehicle that took him and R.L. to the hospital. Both died as a result of the incident. Before forensics teams arrived, a police officer drove away the non-police vehicle involved in the chase, further disturbing crime scene evidence.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also analyzed dozens of autopsies that showed victims “rescued” by police had suffered injuries that likely resulted in quick deaths. These include 17 individuals (in 16 cases) with at least one gunshot wound to the brain by police during alleged confrontations in May 2006 in São Paulo.\n\nIn May 2006, Sao Paulo police killed B.Z., reporting that he had participated in a violent assault on a police precinct. B.Z.’s autopsy report shows that he was shot once, between the eyebrows, from a distance of no greater than 50 centimeters. B.Z. was also shot twice in the chest, both shots bearing a downward trajectory. The bullets pierced his heart, liver, and both lungs, and one shot lodged in his spine. After the shooting, police removed B.Z.’s body from the scene and deposited it at the hospital in an alleged rescue attempt.\n\nFigure 7: Autopsy report diagram depiction of B.Z.’s head wound\n\nPolice allegedly tried to rescue N.P. after shooting him in an alleged confrontation in May 2006. N.P.’s autopsy shows he was shot at least five times in the face.\n\nFigure 8: Autopsy report diagram depicting N.P.’s numerous head wounds\n\nIn the police report, the shooting officer alleged that N.P. was still alive when police backup arrived and took him to a hospital. In support of this claim, the officer said N.P. had been wearing a bulletproof vest. However, a bulletproof vest would not have protected N.P. from the head injuries he sustained.\n\nI.S. and F.I. were killed by police officers in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, in an alleged shootout in May 2006. They were shot seven and ten times, respectively. Each was shot at least once in the head with the projectile causing brain injuries, according to the autopsy report. The autopsy doctors determined that the wounds of each led “rapidly to death.” Despite the likelihood that they both were killed immediately, police took their bodies away from the crime scene to the Pronto Socorro do Parque Industrial hospital.\n\nPolice officers in São Paulo have also engaged in false “rescues” when they arrive at the scene of death squad executions. Human Rights Watch reviewed documentary evidence in 12 of the 54 cases tracked by the São Paulo Ombudsman’s Office of suspected death squad homicides from May 2006. In most of those cases, after the gunmen left the scene of the crime, military police officers rapidly arrived and removed bodies in purported rescue attempts. Many of the bodies removed by the responding police officers had severe injuries and were likely dead before being taken away.\n\nIn the 2006 São Mateus case, several masked gunman lined up six victims against a wall and shot them (five of them in the head, according to their autopsies). All of the victims were removed from the scene by arriving military police officers, though only one victim showed any signs of life, according to witness accounts reported in the press. In addition, the responding officers failed to preserve the crime scene by allowing blood to be washed away prior to the arrival of investigators. The DHPP’s final report on the case did not mention any investigation into the responding officers’ failure to preserve the crime scene.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also identified numerous other police killing cases from Rio containing credible forensic evidence that officers had engaged in false rescues of their shooting victims. For example:\n\nIn December 2007, the mother of 17-year-old L.A., the victim of a police shooting, testified before the military police that the officers who killed her son shot in her direction to prevent her from approaching his body before they placed him in the back of an unmarked yellow car. L.A. was dropped off at the hospital in a purported rescue attempt. At least three separate press accounts published within 48 hours of the shooting cited witness narratives that coincided with L.A.’s mother. According to the press, residents alleged the police officers shot L.A. despite no provocation, dragged his body away, forged a shootout by firing a planted gun from his hand, and removed his body from the crime scene in a yellow car with a covered license plate. These accounts appear to be supported by L.A.’s autopsy report which noted scrape marks on his knees and arms consistent with the body having been dragged away after the initial shots. Moreover, the autopsy reports documented that he was shot four times on the back of his body and once in his neck.\n\nF.R. was killed by officers of Rio’s 16th military police battalion in June 2008. His mother claimed she arrived at the scene moments after he had been killed only to have an officer hoot in her direction to keep her away from his body. She said that rather than awaiting the arrival of forensics teams, the officers placed her son’s already dead body inside a Caveirão (“big skull”) armored police tank and drove it to the hospital.\n\nMissing Clothes\n\nPolice often fail to safeguard the clothing of “resistance” killing victims, thereby depriving investigators of a key form of evidence. In these cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether victims’ clothes have been discarded before, during, or after a victim’s body was taken to the hospital (or perhaps by the hospital itself). But what is clear is that those who are subject to purported rescue attempts often arrive for their autopsies naked. The removal of clothing prior to forensics tests is detrimental to investigations, since garments can contain key evidence needed to determine the circumstances of the killing.\n\nThe ballistics evidence sometimes found on clothing can be particularly significant. The presence of a point blank gunshot—known in Brazil as a tiro a queima roupa or “shot that burns the clothes”—is a widely known indicator suggestive that a police shooting could have been an execution. However, as one former homicide prosecutor in Rio told us, such close range shots may go undetected if the markings they leave behind are absorbed by the victim’s clothes that are then discarded prior to the forensic examination. São Paulo prosecutor Eduardo Roberto Alcântara Del-Campo, a former DHPP forensic scientist and former civil police precinct chief, has noted the importance of examining clothing evidence for ballistics markings left from close-range shots: “[n]ot rarely, the skin receives only the projectile, all of the other residue being retained by the weaves of the fabric.”\n\nIn a substantial portion of the alleged “resistance” killing cases reviewed by Human Rights Watch, the victims appeared to have arrived at autopsies naked.\n\nIn the Complexo do Alemão case, photographs show that at least 17 of the 19 persons killed by police were wearing clothes at the scene under police custody. However, all 19 victims arrived naked for autopsy. According to a federal panel of forensics experts commissioned to study the reports in the case, “the original garments [of the victims] were not subsequently sent for [forensics] examination.”\n\nOf the 17 alleged May 2006 “resistance” killings from São Paulo in which victims were delivered to the hospital after being shot at least once in the brain, six were noted as naked at autopsy and two were only in underwear. (In three of the 17 deaths, no clothing information was noted in the autopsy report. This suggests that the victims’ cadavers were naked, since it is standard to describe clothing in such reports. )\n\nForensic doctors said the body of B.Z., who was “rescued” after being shot point blank between the eyes, arrived “naked, washed and with ink for fingerprints on the tips of his digits.”\n\nBroad Scope of the False “Rescues” Problem\n\nGiven the lack of systematic investigation of police killings, it is impossible to determine precisely how many false “rescues” occur each year. However, Human Rights Watch found a consensus among criminal justice officials (other than police), health officials, and community members that the practice is commonplace.\n\nCriminal Justice Officials\n\nEvery non-police authority with whom we spoke about this subject insisted that the practice of false rescues by police is frequent in both São Paulo and Rio states. In São Paulo, Police Ombudsman Antônio Funari told Human Rights Watch that when police officers execute suspects, “they normally take care” to take the corpses to the hospital. Based on his office’s examination of “resistance” killing cases, Deputy Police Ombudsman Júlio Cesar Fernandes Neves said the objective of police in bringing a corpse to the hospital is often to “whitewash” a crime.[246]\n\nSimilarly, in Rio de Janeiro, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Human Rights Leonardo Cháves recognized false rescues as a major problem. A retired Rio police forensic scientist wrote in a May 2009 blog post: “[regarding the] ‘removals’ by the police of bandits in the favela, the only purpose is the intentional destruction of the crime scene.” Prosecutor Carlos Cardoso, human rights aide to the São Paulo attorney general from 1998-2008, said, “If there’s no way to hide that the police did the killing, they remove the corpse. The [bullet] cartridges disappear.... Everything disappears.”\n\nHealth Officials\n\nThe directors of the state medical associations in both Rio and São Paulo told Human Rights Watch that false rescues by police are a common practice. The heads of the Regional Medical Council of the State of Rio de Janeiro, for instance, stated that they had sent a formal complaint to the Security Secretariat in the past but had never received a reply. Dr. Márcia Rosa, former Council president, complained of the police “dumping bodies on doctors” and even of “doctors being threatened at gunpoint [to stay quiet].” According to Dr. Rosa, former Council president, two cases are emblematic. In one, which took place around 2004, two police vehicles dumped nine bodies at the entrance to the Bon Sucesso Hospital. In the second, in 2008, police dumped 11 cadavers in the emergency room at the Souza Aguiar Hospital.\n\nSimilarly, in São Paulo, the president of the Medical Regional Council, Dr. Henrique Carlos Gonçalves, reported that false rescues remain a problem, though he said the number of bodies dropped off at hospitals by police has decreased somewhat in recent years.\n\nRio Residents\n\nResidents in Rio communities where “resistance” killings frequently occur told Human Rights Watch that police used false “rescues” to destroy or tamper with evidence of killings. The fact that false “rescues” are widely viewed to be a problem by Rio residents is demonstrated by the fact that, in several cases we looked at, residents from different areas of Rio (AISP 3, AISP 22, and the Baixada Fluminense) complained of the police removing the bodies of fatal shooting victims to hospitals.\n\nIn the case of the December 2008 killing of eight-year-old T.L. in Rio, residents accused military police officers of firing the bullet that pierced the boy’s neck. An ODia photograph shows family members and neighbors physically surrounding the child’s body after the killing on the steps where he had died, so as to prevent the reportedly insistent officers from removing his body to the hospital.\n\nTwo mothers of victims of extrajudicial executions felt strongly that the practice of false rescues was common. One told Human Rights Watch that: “[the police] only take bodies. They don’t take the living. This is to destroy the scene of the crime.” Another observed: “If they take them alive, then they kill them in the car, then take them to the hospital to say they rescued them.”\n\nPolice Duty to Rescue\n\nUnder Brazilian law, officers have a duty to assist injured victims who survive police shootings, and deliberate failure to do so may constitute a criminal offense. In conversations with Human Rights Watch, some police authorities attempted to justify “rescues” to Human Rights Watch on the basis of this duty. For instance, one São Paulo military police colonel emphasized, that “a police officer is not a doctor” and could even fear prosecution for “omission in rescuing.”\n\nHowever, the professed concern over the crime of “omission in rescuing” does not hold up under scrutiny. Human Rights Watch asked the colonel or any of those present if they could cite a single example of an officer who had been punished for the crime of “omission” following a police shooting. They could not.\n\nFurthermore, as detailed above, Human Rights Watch identified several cases in which there was virtually no question that the victims the police purported to “rescue” were already dead. As one Rio surgeon told O Globo: “Most of the time the bodies arrive [at the hospital] shredded by firearms. Any lay person could attest to the death.”\n\nRio Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Human Rights Leonardo Cháves also told Human Rights Watch that officers could call for appropriate medical attention, such as an ambulance, to assist injured individuals in the city of Rio, and would not be guilty of “omission in rescuing.”\n\nIn an effort to address the problem of police cover ups of executions during “resistance killings,” the Rio state prosecutor’s office signed an innovative agreement in July 2009 with the civil and military police in the city of São Gonçalo. The agreement mandates that officers involved in shootings call for specialized medical assistance for their victims rather than moving them haphazardly from the shooting scene and driving them in a police car to the hospital.\n\nThe agreement is in line with local government guidelines in Rio and São Paulo regarding assistance to car accident victims, which state that rescuers operating in non-rural areas should call expert medical assistance to the scene. These rescuers sho"
