        "text": "Cover illustration by Filipe Jardim, a Brazillian artist who specialises in fashion and travel illustration, spending half of his year in his native city of Rio de Janeiro and the rest circulating the globe. Filipe first made his mark when invited to produce Louis Vuitton’s Rio de Janeiro “Carnet de Voyage”. This beautifully produced book was the perfect showcase for his work and resulted in further commissions for Hermes and Issa. Recently he was asked to provide illustrations to launch the Wall Street Tiffany store in New York, whilst continuing editorial work for The New Yorker and S/N magazine.\n\nFor this World Series edition we turn our pages to Brazil, and to Rio De Janeiro: Rio is not quite a world city; it’s too laid back, too full of switchbacks, so many roads ending at the beach – but it’s the year of Rio + 20, the twentieth anniversary of the original global climate change summit, and the runup to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, so it’s a good time for Litro to dip into Rio’s writing scene."
