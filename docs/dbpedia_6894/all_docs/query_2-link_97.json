        "text": "In 1964, when Kim Ribeiro started to play his flute in public, the Bossa-Nova blew up in Rio de Janeiro; he participated of its unfolding in Juiz de Fora (MG) where he was born and raised. Five years later, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, in order to study polyphony, musical analysis and theory in the Pro Arte Seminaries of Music (Rio de Janeiro). His first job was in the State Firemen Corporation Band, as a piccolo player. This was not his only activity, since he started to play with singers and instrumentists like Baden Powell, Alaide Costa, Sergio Ricardo, Nelson Cavaquinho, Paulo Moura, among others exponents of the MPB (Brazilian Popular Music).\n\nHe founded his own instrumental group, \"Quinteto Pixinguinha\". Eclectic composer, he wrote for trios, duos and bigger groups, following and developing diverse styles, although major emphasis was placed on Brazilian rhythms, like 'choro' and 'samba'. So far, his compositions have been recorded by several artists, as the Grupo de Choro da Rocinha, Odette Ernest Dias, MÃ´nica Mendes, etc., although his own interpretation has a special flavor.\n\n\"Kim did not let himself be a servant of a genre. Theoretically, his music would be called \"popular music\", since he was not oriented to the vast structures of concert music. Nevertheless, in this universe, that imposes certain time or genre limits, how inspired, variegated and unexpected is his composition! Marks of talent are all over, in the purity of melodic lines, in counterpoint and, mostly, in a certain search of a new sound, whatever this might be.\"\n\n- Luiz Paulo Horta, music critic for O Globo."
