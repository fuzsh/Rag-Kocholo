        "text": "Brazilian musician Paulo Moura died of cancer on Monday. He was 77 and had been hospitalized since July 4th.\n\nBorn in São Jose do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Moura was raised in a family of musicians. At the age of 9, he started playing the clarinet and by the time he was 14, he was ready to join his father’s band.\n\nMoura recorded the first of 40 albums in 1956. When he was already well known in Jazz circles, he began to dedicate his time to classical music, joining the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Theater orchestra.\n\nA versatile saxophonist, Moura joined the very first Bossa Nova group and played with great names associated with Brazilian Popular Music (MPB) such as Elis Regina and Milton Nascimento.\n\nA true master of instrumental music, Moura contributed to the popularity of genres such as gafieira, samba, forró and choro."
