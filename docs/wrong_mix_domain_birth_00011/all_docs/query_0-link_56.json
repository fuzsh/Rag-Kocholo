It’s always lovely to have another illustrator stop by Critter Lit, especially one as talented as Kyle Beckett. I was first introduced to Kyle’s work through my husband, Frank Tupta. When Frank sold his first picture book",

        "text": "How did you first get published?\n\nThere are actually two answers here! Before I started working with Bright, I self-published a book called A Lovely Day for a Drive on Amazon. It was just something to do so that I could show people I can make a book.\n\nAfter that, I got a few books published with Bright.\n\nDo you write/illustrate full-time?\n\nI do! Or perhaps it’s best to say that I am trying too. Right now, it’s all I do for work. There are some days it seems like a mountain I’ll never be able to climb. But so far I am making it work, in no small part due to my fiancée’s support.\n\nWhat inspires you to create picture books?\n\nIt all started with an instructor I met in college; his name is Regan Dunnick. The class was called ‘Children’s Book Illustration’ and I figured it would be a fun and easy class. By the time the semester ended, though, I was full-force into picture books. While studying for the class, I remember reading the book Sam and Dave Dig a Hole by Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen and thinking to myself, ‘yep, that’s how it’s supposed to be done.’\n\nBeyond that, I’m inspired daily by other picture book makers. Abner Graboff, Benji Davies and Jon Klassen in particular got me into this form of storytelling.\n\nWhat surprised you the most working as an author/illustrator?\n\nThe most surprising thing for me is definitely how collaborative it can be! Before I graduated from college, I made all of my art quite personally. There were critiques and discussions in class, but for the most part I was drawing into the late hours of the night all alone by the light of a single desk lamp.\n\nNow that I am a working professional, I’ve started working with authors and illustrators and agents and designers. It’s more than just me making these books now, and my work is all the better for it.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an author/illustrator?\n\nI love getting lost in research. I think my favorite part of making books is the beginning stages where there are no wrong answers and you’re just throwing everything you can possibly think of down onto the paper. It’s like being an explorer without ever leaving the house.\n\nWhat do you find difficult working as a author/illustrator?\n\nThe mental side of being a storyteller is really difficult, even terrifying. There are days you get up, knowing you have to work, but not quite knowing where to start. It’s easy enough to tell yourself you’re going to write a book, but it’s another thing altogether to actually do it.\n\nFor me, that’s the most difficult thing; trying not to worry about tomorrow and focus on the task at hand today.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nNew ideas can come from anywhere. The trick, for me, is to keep your creative engine running at all times. Even in the grocery store, I might see something and make a mental note of it for later.\n\nThat being said, sometimes you need to distract yourself to ‘hit the reset button’ so to speak. To hit my reset button, I read books and I run a whole lot. Your reset button can be anything at all; meditation, TV, baking, whatever works.\n\nAnything you are habitual about when it comes to creativity?\n\nReading! I think one of the best ways to come up with ideas consistently is to be experiencing other people’s ideas as much as possible. For me, reading books does the trick. Watching a good movie will work too, but you have to be engaging with it, not just watching it to entertain yourself.\n\nI try to think of creativity as a combination of different experiences or stories. The more you experience, the more you have to combine.\n\nCan you share a positive experience you’ve had in the Kid Lit community?\n\nThere are so many. The first one that comes to mind is from back when I was living in my hometown in Illinois. I had just self-published my book A Lovely Day for a Drive when my old grade school asked if I would come in and read for the kindergartners.\n\nI agreed, somewhat reluctantly, because I get very anxious if people are looking at me. I showed up on the day, and they took me to the gym and gave me a microphone.\n\n“Will I really be needing this?” I asked. “I think the kindergartners will be able to hear me just fine.”\n\n“We want to make sure everyone can hear you,” they replied.\n\nThat was when I realized that I would be reading my book and doing a live drawing in front of the entire 300 person school.\n\nObviously I was nervous. But when the time came to start talking, it just happened. I read my book, did some drawings and answered a few questions. I wasn’t nervous at all. In the end, I realized that as long as I was talking about something that I truly loved, there was no reason to be scared. That’s when I knew I was on the right path.\n\nRecommended reading?\n\nThat’s a good question! There are lots of picture books I would suggest; The Flight of Mister Finch by Thomas Baas, or Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem by Mac Barnett and Adam Rex. If you’re into the oldies like me, I would suggest A Fresh Look at Cats by Abner Graboff.\n\nAs far as middle grade or young adult books go, I love The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman (anything by Mr. Gaiman, really), and The Doctor Dolittle Series by Hugh Lofting is quite incredible.\n\nAnd then there are the more adult novels and comics as well; I have been really into H.P. Lovecraft lately, as well as the Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Headlopper by Andrew Maclean is a great comic, and so is Tale of Sand by Jim Henson and Ramón K. Pérez.\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career thus far?\n\nI have loved every minute of being in this industry so far, but I think the greatest experience has been seeing How to Build a Haunted House all wrapped up and bound together for the first time. It really felt great to have that story in my hands.\n\nWhat is something you wish someone had told you when you first started writing/illustrating?\n\nI wish I was told how much of the experience of making a book really feels strange. Most mornings it takes me an hour or so to settle down and stop asking myself, ‘wait, am I doing this right?’\n\nIt’s something I’ve come to accept now. If you feel like you’re doing it right, you might not be trying hard enough. It’s easy to slip into a ‘comfort zone’ when you’re working, and I wish someone had told me to keep pushing harder."
