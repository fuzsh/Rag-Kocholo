        "text": "I love these three poems but know nothing about rhyme or meter or any of those fancy book-learning terms. REH fan, retired professor, and poetry expert Frank Coffman does. I think Mr. Coffman provides a wonderful service explaining all this stuff so I’ve turned the blog over to him for the most part. I will provide a little bibliographic info and make a comment or two before his analysis of the poems.\n\nGary Romeo\n\nThis poem first appeared in The Howard Collector V1N2 Spring, 1962. A note acknowledges that the poem was from “the Barlow microfilm.” R. H. Barlow was a superfan of H. P. Lovecraft and Weird Tales writers. Mr. Barlow was directly responsible for preserving several of REH’s poems. He is deserving of a whole article and much thanks but that will have to be done another day. For now, I point you to his Wikipedia article. Barlow committed suicide due to society’s repression of homosexuals. Sadly, the progress made since Barlow’s time is in danger of being reversed.\n\n“The One Black Stain” next appeared in Red Shadows, Donald M. Grant, 1968. In this book’s introduction Glenn Lord states: “A strip of microfilm from the effects of the late R. H. Barlow yielded the next Kane item: the poem, “The One Black Stain,” which appeared in 1962 in an amateur journal, The Howard Collector.” Why this poem was left out of the Centaur Press Solomon Kane paperback books is a real puzzle. The poem did appear in the Bantam and Baen paperbacks.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the poem in The Savage Sword of Conan #62. There was a one-page introduction by Louise Jones and six pages of art by David Wenzel. This adaptation was reprinted in the Dark Horse, The Saga of Solomon Kane, omnibus collection.\n\nThis poem also appears in Frank Coffman’s Selected Poems available here. There are also several other books and publications worthy of purchase from Mr. Coffman at the Lulu.com website.\n\nChronologically this poem comes after “The Moon of Skulls.” Per Glenn Lord: “After returning Marylin to England, Kane accompanies Sir Francis Drake on his freebooting voyages to the New World (1566-72). It was during this time that Kane learned somewhat of craft-fighting Indians in Darien. He was likewise with Drake, on the latter’s globe-girding voyage, and, at St. Julian’s Bay (Patagonia, June 1577)…”\n\nA Review of Robert E. Howard’s “The One Black Stain”\n\nby Frank Coffman\n\nRobert E. Howard’s poem, “The One Black Stain,” is a work proving the young man’s mastery of poetic form and sound. It also exemplifies Howard’s love of history and real historical subjects to ground his fictional work—both in prose and poetic forms.\n\nThe poem recounts the execution of Sir Thomas Doughty by Sir Francis Drake—with the fictional addition of the character of Solomon Kane, not only at the scene, but giving his objections to the execution to the extent that Drake has Kane arrested and bound belowdecks. Kane, of course, then gets free of his bonds, helped by a sleeping guard and confronts Drake threateningly—before disappearing into the night at the poem’s conclusion. Thematically, it demonstrates a couple characteristics of the character of Kane: 1) his hatred of injustice (and, perhaps specifically, of authority abused); 2) though his “wrath” is “slow to rise,” it reinforces the lethal volatility of his temper.\n\nTypical of Howard who had become a master of the narrative poem—an art that fell away from popularity among “free verse” and other “realist/modern” poets in the later 20th c. and has only in the past few decades seen a true revival—the poem is a variation of the ballad form, due to its regularity of rhythm of the type known as the “literary ballad” (as opposed to the “folk ballad” or “ballad of tradition” that has been the standard in Western language narrative poetics for over 800 years).\n\nThe poem is an expanded “Long-line Ballad” (as I have termed it in my Robert E. Howard: Selected Poems and elsewhere). Rather than the 4343 accent pattern of the traditional ballad and the normal iambic alternation of tetrameter and trimeter lines, Howard uses two 7-beat lines and one 8-beat central line in his three-line stanzas, He uses multiple internal rhymes in the “long segments.” In this poem, we might divide each stanza for the 7-8-7 accent tercets into two parts—but with much variation in the essentially iambic rhythm, often substituting an anapestic foot uu/ for the iamb or inverting the iamb u/ into a trochee /u or leaving off an initial unstressed syllable in the line (acephalous/ “headless” iambic foot = / rather than u/) for metrical variation. The basic pattern of accents and rhymes is as follows:\n\nBasic Meter (with many variations, as noted above:\n\nu/u/u/u/ || u/u/u/ iambic tetrameter || iambic trimeter 7 accents total\n\nu/u/u/u/ || u/u/u/u/ iambic tetrameter || iambic tetrameter 8 accents total\n\nu/u/u/u/ || u/u/u/ iambic tetrameter || iambic trimeter 7 accents total\n\nRhyme Scheme (showing the typical line divisions):\n\nThey carried him out on the barren sand 4 A\n\nwhere the rebel captains died; 3 B\n\nWhere the grim grey rotting gibbets stand 4 A\n\nas Magellan reared them on the strand, 4 A\n\nAnd the gulls that haunt the lonesome land 4 A\n\nwail to the lonely tide. 3 B\n\nWhile this is not an especially difficult rhythm to achieve, the necessity for all the internal rhyming is daunting and very difficult to achieve. That fact and the typical narrative power of Howard’s verses and compact storytelling make me rank this as one of Howard’s best poetic works.\n\n“The Return of Sir Richard Grenville” appeared in all the various Solomon Kane collections. Marvel Comics did an adaptation in The Savage Sword of Conan #41. The adaptation is by Roy Thomas and David Wenzel. It was also reprinted in the Dark Horse Solomon Kane omnibus collection titled The Saga of Solomon Kane.\n\nChronologically this poem comes after “Hawk of Basti.” Per Glenn Lord: “Kane finds himself in cannibal country.”\n\nA Review of “The Return of Sir Richard Grenville”\n\nby Frank Coffman\n\nRobert E. Howard’s poem, “The Return of Sir Richard Grenville,” is a rare type of ghost story in that it presents us with the “Helpful Ghost.” As with all modern literature in the speculative genres, the roots of story motifs and plot elements are found in the folkloric, legendary, and mythic tales of the past.\n\nWith respect to folktales, the standard source for story elements in the world’s oral traditions is Stith Thompson’s Motif Index of Folk Literature, a monumental six-volume work collected by the eminent folklorist from Indiana University and his team of scholars. It is a huge decimal outline of the motifs (the smallest elements of story structure, building blocks of narrative) of the world’s folk-oral “illiterature.”\n\nWith respect to this poem, we find motifs: E363 Ghost returns to aid living and its sub-varieties: E363.1 Ghost aids living in emergency; E363.2 Ghost returns to protect the living; and E363.3 Ghost warns the living. Of course, we also have the situation where the ghost manifests with the ability to perform the physical action of swordplay and slaying of the physical attackers.\n\nIn typical Howard fashion, the use of figurative language—especially metaphor and simile and animation (giving living qualities to the inanimate) serve to enliven the story. Howard’s preferred poetic mode was most certainly the narrative, and this story poem has the pace and “action packing” typical of his prose tales as well. In fact, as with good ballads, the compactness and fast pace of the story details compresses Howard’s vision into a furious flurry of activity. After the dialogue of the opening, the attackers come on immediately and are just as soon dispatched.\n\nHoward begins to animate the tale with the “crawling mist” in stanza one. Of course Solomon Kane “[speaks] in wonder, not in fear” as he inquires why the ghost of his old friend has awakened him. He is quickly told that the metaphoric “hounds of doom” are coming. Soon, the “shadows out of Hell” arrive.\n\nKane’s sword “was like a cobra’s stike” and personified “death hummed in its tune. Metaphorically Kane’s “arm was steel and knotted oak” (a bit overdone—Which was it, Bob? Steel? or Knotted Oak?—a definite mixed metaphor here).\n\nHis task accomplished in saving Kane, the ghost of Grenville disappears—as it the common wont of ghosts.\n\nThe poem, structurally, is a typical instance of the Literary Ballad, Howard’s favorite narrative form (although used in various incarnations and arrangements). The rhyme scheme of ABAB in each stanza is typical of the literary variant of the Traditional or Folk Ballad, rhyming more fully that the traditional form’s ABCB. And rather than a 4343 accentual metrical pattern, Howard’s base is more regular iambic in tetrameters and trimeters in the odd and even lines, respectively—although Howard does not stick to the perfect pattern except in stanzas 7 and 8:\n\nHis pistols thundered in the night,\n\nAnd in that burst of flame\n\nHe saw red eyes with hate alight,\n\nAnd on the figures came.\n\nHis sword was like a cobra’s stroke\n\nAnd death hummed in its tune;\n\nHis arm was steel and knotted oak\n\nBeneath the rising moon.\n\nIn each of the other stanzas of the poem, Howard throws in an irregular foot—usually an anapest for an iamb, as in stanza two:\n\nNo nightwind shook the forest deep\n\nWhere the shadows of Doom were spread,\n\nAnd Solomon Kane awoke from sleep\n\nAnd looked upon the dead.\n\nThe anapest substitutions are in lines 2 and 3:\n\nuu/ uu/ u/\n\nu/ uu/ u/ u/\n\nAn example of an inverted metrical foot, trochee/trochaic foot for iamb/iambic is in line 2 of stanza 1:\n\nOne slept beneath the branches dim,\n\nCloaked in the crawling mist,\n\nAnd Richard Grenville came to him\n\nAnd plucked him by the wrist.\n\n/u u/ u/\n\nAnother line that noticeably breaks the metrical base pattern is the last line of the penultimate stanza (which also has inverted feet [trochees for iambs] in lines one and two:\n\nSilent as death their charge had been,\n\nSilent as night they fled;\n\nAnd in the trampled glade was seen\n\nOnly the torn dead.\n\n/u u/ u/ u/\n\n/u u/ u/\n\nu/ u/ u/ u/\n\n/u u / /\n\nIn the last line, Howard ends with two strong accents, omitting the unaccented syllable of the last foot. The effect of the two heavy stressed syllables at the end reinforces and gives impact to the line.\n\nThe poem is yet another fine example of Robert E. Howard’s narrative and poetic genius. Through only the first 25 years of his life, he had become a master of the ballad and other forms and had developed his ear for poetic and musically rhythmic language.\n\n“Solomon Kane’s Homecoming” was first published in Fanciful Tales, Fall 1936. There is a brief mention of REH’s death on the page printing this poem. This poem has appeared in every Solomon Kane collection.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the poem in The Savage Sword of Conan #20. The adaptation was by Roy Thomas, Virglio Redondo, and Rudy Nebres. It was adapted a second time in The Sword of Solomon Kane #6. REH’s text was used alongside art by Sandy Plunkett and Al Williamson.\n\nThere is a variant version of “Solomon Kane’s Homecoming.” It was originally published in The Howard Collector #15. It has been reprinted several times. The easiest to find version is probably in The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane, Ballantine Books (Del Rey), 2004.\n\nChronologically this poem comes after “The Children of Asshur.” Per Glenn Lord: “After many a year away, Kane returns to his hometown of Devon. The year is 1610.”\n\nA Review of “Solomon Kane’s Homecoming”\n\nby Frank Coffman\n\n“Solomon Kane’s Homecoming” is a poem meant to be the summary of and epilogue to his adventures chronicled in Howard’s prose and narrative poetry about the character. As such, it reads like a list of what movie and television script writers call “loglines.”\n\nThe brief, within-one-stanza outlines given for several micro-synopses of some of Kanes adventures, follow a longer and more detailed synopsis of the death of Grenville which is given two stanzas. Kane’s learning of the death of Bess hints at a bit of backstory, as well as the strongest thematic note in the poem: “Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, / and the fairest fade,” he said. The theme of Transience is one that runs throughout Howard’s work.\n\nHoward also manages, as almost always, to fill this narrative with drama and pace. We move quickly through Kanes several adventures with the brief presentation of details, meanwhile being—as would be his audience—amazed by, not only the “realistic” elements of adventure (the dangers and toll of battle), but, moreso, the clearly supernatural elements: sorcery, deathless queen, pyramids of skulls, City of the Mad, vampire, dead men [walking], winged demons…\n\nYet even though he attests that he is “weary of wandering,” he takes his leave and ventures forth again into the unknown.\n\nA-down the wind like a running pack\n\nthe hounds of the ocean bayed,\n\nAnd Solomon Kane rose up again\n\nand girt his Spanish blade.\n\nIn his strange cold eyes a vagrant gleam\n\ngrew wayward and blind and bright,\n\nAnd Solomon put the people by\n\nand went into the night.\n\nWith the lovely metaphor of the “hounds of the ocean” baying for him to return to sea. He girds on once more his “Spanish blade” and, with the “vagrant gleam” heads off on the road that “no man [knows].” Much like the restless Odysseus/Ulysses, who, as Tennyson wrote, “[could] not rest from wandering, we have Solomon Kane, even in his agonizing weariness, departing again—recognizing that his endless until a very end.\n\nFormally, the poem is what might be called a “Double Ballad” in its stanza pattern. The ballad of folk and oral tradition has the same rhyme scheme and general rhythm: 4343 accents in four lines and ABCB rhyme scheme with only the short lines rhyming. Howard doubles this and also makes his 8-line stanzas Literary Ballads, rather than Traditional or Folk Ballads by using a fairly even iambic meter for the verses. As with all of his work—and the work of any good poet using formal meter—he inserts variations into several lines to guard against a too-regular meter from cloying or becoming monotonous. Many lines have anapestic substitution: uu/ for the iambic u/. The last stanza is perfectly iambic, but a good example of variation is in stanza 10:\n\nA-down the wind like a running pack\n\nthe hounds of the ocean bayed,\n\nAnd Solomon Kane rose up again\n\nand girt his Spanish blade.\n\nIn his strange cold eyes a vagrant gleam\n\ngrew wayward and blind and bright,\n\nAnd Solomon put the people by\n\nand went into the night.\n\nThese lines would SCAN (showing the meter) as follows (substituted anapestic “feet” are in bold):\n\nu/ u/ uu/ u/\n\nu/ uu/ u/\n\nu/ uu/ u/ u/\n\nu/ u/ u/\n\nuu/ u/ u/ u/\n\nu/ uu/ u/\n\nu/ uu/ u/ u/\n\nu/ u/ u/\n\nThis shows anapestic substitution in six of the eight lines of the stanza. Note also that Howard varies the position of the substituted metrical “foot”—also the mark of a skilled versifier.\n\nAll in all, another excellently wrought poem. Howard was a poetic genius whose skill at formalist versification and the use of the narrative mode surpassed most of the speculative poets of his—or any other—day.\n\nOnce again, I thank Frank Coffman for this contribution.

Click on these provided links and I’ll soon see you at Howards Days if attending.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nConqueror Fantastic is an anthology built around the idea of using a real-life “conqueror” in a “what if?” type of fantasy story. Edited by Pamela Sargent and published by Daw Books, the book came out in April 2004. So almost 20 years late, I’m just getting around to reviewing it.\n\nThis anthology contains 13 stories. I will review them all but the only one I will review in depth is “Observable Things” by Paul Di Filippo since it features Robert E. Howard’s Solomon Kane character in the story. The introduction by Pamela Sargent sets the stage.\n\n“For this anthology, I began by asking writers for stories featuring historical figures such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caeser, Genghis Khan, Napolean, Hitler, Stalin, or any other conqueror from any culture who happened to interest the writer. I was also looking for historical fantasy rather than alternative history, although the line between the two can often be hard to draw (as it can be with such other related forms of fantasy as magical realism, science fiction, and dark fantasy). The conqueror could the central character of the story, a supporting or minor character in the tale, or even offstage, as long as the story hinged on his or her presence in some way.”\n\n“To the Gods Their Due” by Michelle West features Alexander the Great. I know only a little about Alexander. I saw the Director’s Cut of the Oliver Stone movie and read Mary Renault more than a decade ago. And I liked how in Smallville, Micheal Rosenbaum’s Lex Luthor was obsessed with his namesake. This story was told in the first-person using Alexander’s voice. As far as I know it was historically accurate. The story was mainly about Alexander’s relationship with Hephaestion. Who was the Patrocles to his Achilles. (Watch the movie Troy with Brad Pitt.)\n\nThe next story, “Intensified Transmogrification” by Barry N. Malzberg and Bill Pronzini is about Lyndon Baines Johnson. LBJ has declared martial law due to anti-Vietnam War protests. The narrator of the story feels something drastic needs to be done. It seems a teeny bit similar to Nicholson Baker’s 2004 novel, Checkpoint. There must have been something in the air that year.\n\n“The Lion Hunt” by Janeen Webb is also about Alexander the Great. Alexander dies in a lion hunt leaving his father Phillip to mourn the loss.\n\n“Observable Things” by Paul Di Filippo was the selling point of the book for me. We get a brand-new Solomon Kane adventure, and it takes place in the good o’ USofA. Of course, it was still called the “new world” back then, and full of soon to be exterminated and displaced natives. The “conqueror” in this story is either the English settlers or King Phillip, AKA Metacomet. King Philip’s War was a real-life armed conflict in 1675–1676. This story has King Phillip using Lovecraftian sorcery to battle the New England residents.\n\nSolomon Kane is recruited to help the New Englanders in their fight since Kane is known to have battled supernatural forces and prevailed. The minute Kane steps off the boat he is attacked and expertly slays his foe:\n\n“A child of Dagon. Your suspicions of Indian complicity with ancient demiurges were not misplaced, my friends. Let us adjourn to some quarters affording more safety than the open air, and we can begin to plot our campaign against these abominations.”\n\nThe story is narrated by the real-life Puritan clergyman Cotton Mather. He is reminisicing about his early days and the effect that meeting Solomon Kane had on him. The story is told in that old English style (modified for our modern ear, but true to the spirit of what we know from Mather’s own writings). Mather narrates: “Certainly I would have no hesitation at this late date in abandoning all Credence in the Supernatural, were it not for one certain Man and the Events he brought in his train. That Man was named Solomon Kane, and I met him when I was thirteen years old, and all of Christian New England seemed doomed to Merciless Extinction at the hands of the Salvages and their Dreaded Conqueror, King Phillip.”\n\nI like this story and encourage you to read it. There are a lot of “easter eggs” and Kane is handled well. His dialogue might be too flowery at times but remember we are reading Cotton Mather’s remembrance of the events. This story alone was worth the purchase of the book.\n\nI am going to briefly cover the rest of the stories. “The Empress Jingu Fishes” by Kij Johnson is a poetic short work about the real-life empress. The author ends the story with a historical note on Japan’s female emperors.\n\nAdolf Hitler is the star of “Twilight of Idols” by Stephen Dedman. Film director, Fritz Lang, is also featured. Hitler bathes in dragon blood and becomes invulnerable. He can still be killed by poison gas though. The events of WW2 proceed historically but not the Hitler suicide. At the end of this story, an “unknown” prisoner is forced into chemical gas experiments.\n\n“Spirit Brother” by Pamela Sargent is about Genghis Khan. It deals with the Khan and his boyhood friend Jamukha, who later became his enemy. This story features Jamukha’s spirit.\n\nIn the introduction to “Good Deeds” by Jack Dann, Pamela Sargent states “Robert F. Kennedy, in my opinion, was one of the most fascinating and promising political figures on the American scene and one of the greatest losses of potential the U. S. endured when he was assassinated in 1968, less than two weeks after the tragic death of Martin Luther King Jr.” This story is highly readable, I applaud Ms. Sargent for not rejecting it since it makes RFK out to be a really screwed-up asshole. Maybe he was, I dunno. In any event, I enjoyed the story.\n\n“Walking Gods” by George Alec Effinger is about Saladin and has the feel of a sword & sorcery story although I doubt many would label it as such. Fans of Robert E. Howard’s “crusader” stories should enjoy this one. I certainly did.\n\n“An Appeal to Adolf” by Ian Watson is about closeted homosexuals on a Nazi boat. Airplanes haven’t been invented and big boats are the main weapons of war. In the finale it is revealed that Adolf Hitler is a closeted homosexual as well. This story seems one big mess to me.\n\n“Martyrs of the Upshot Knothole” by James Morrow is a finely told story about John Wayne’s argumentative friendship with a very liberal bit player in several of his movies. In real (and reel) life John Wayne and several cast and crew members were exposed to radiation during the filming of The Conqueror. Susan Hayward and Pedro Armendariz were among the first to die early. Wayne said he beat cancer in 1964 but it returned, and he passed away in 1979. John Wayne is used to good effect in this fictional story and treated in a dignified manner. This is a very good story.\n\n“Nappy” by George Zebrowski is probably the most science-fictional story in the collection. It is about an historian and a virtual reality Napoleon Bonaparte. The story never grabbed me.\n\nThe last story in the book is “Del Norte” by Michaela Roessner. It is about the real-life Joan Grau, a soldier who served under conqueror, Hernando Cortes, and his relationship with a native princess.\n\nAll in all, I liked quite a few of the stories. Several were just mediocre, but the Solomon Kane story is one of those odd uses of REH’s characters that appears every now and then that I’m compelled to purchase.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nBefore discussing “Death’s Black Riders” I need to follow up on the last Solomon Kane blogpost. Fritz Leiber liked John Pocsik’s rewrite of Robert E. Howard’s “The Blue Flame of Vengeance” AKA “Blades of the Brotherhood.”\n\nMr. Pocsik was given a second shot at Solomon Kane in Ariel #1 (1976). “The Fiend Within” was written as a Solomon Kane story but Kane had to be changed to Isaac Grail before publication. (I believe it has been said that Glenn Lord was in negotiations to have the Solomon Kane stories reprinted by Bantam Books and it was felt that having a new Kane story appear could complicate things.)\n\nThis story is clearly about Solomon Kane and no one else. It tells the story of Kane’s imprisonment by the Spanish Inquisition. Kane (Isaac Grail in name only) and cabin boy Jeremy Kent have been captured and are being tortured. “Sir Richard Grenville had died in his arms, and as Grail had looked up to see the mounds of dead lying everywhere, splintered masts and rigging trailing overboard, the English banners had fallen. A blow from a musket stock had lain him senseless; hours later – or perhaps days – he had roused to find himself chained in a brine-stinking hold, listening to the clutter of the sea-rats.”\n\nCaptured by the Spanish and thrown into a cell, Kane and Kent are being tortured under the gaze of Duke Arago Ordenez. The torture scenes are pretty brutal but not (I don’t think) overdone. Kane rages throughout and the writing suggests Howard to me.\n\nThe cabin boy has died under intense torture and Kane swears revenge. Kane manages to overcome his torturer and searches the castle for Ordenez. Ordenez and Kane grapple and a guard knocks Kane through a window. Kane floats unconscious in the moat/river below and escapes. He is rescued by an old woman and vows to return to the castle and kill Ordenez. But the soldiers come to them first. Kane hears their approach as the old woman is attacked and slain. Kane attacks, killing several men instantly, confusion reigns as the soldiers scatter, Ordenez flees and Kane grabs a horse and chases him down. Needless to say, Kane achieves his revenge.\n\n“Another vassel of the damned sent down to roast in the hells of its Master. How many more must be slain, I wonder, before the weak of this world can wander, free and unafraid?” Pocsik told a decent story and stayed true to REH in my opinion. All in all, Isaac Grail made a decent Kane clone.\n\nBut my favorite Copycat Kane is pictured below.\n\n“Death’s Black Riders” was first published in The Howard Collector, Spring 1968. It is a very short incomplete fragment. Glenn Lord chose not to include it in Red Shadows, Donald M. Grant, 1968 or in any of the Centaur Press paperbacks. It was published again in Lone Star Fictioneer #1 and in The Howard Collector, Ace Books, 1979.\n\nThe text was not edited in any of these printings. The story begins with Kane riding a horse, something he rarely did in other stories. He is in a spooky forest and senses “Something’s Coming.” Unlike the West Side Story song, it’s not something good.\n\n“A great black horse, incredibly gigantic in the grey light, and on his back a giant of a rider, crouched close over the bow, a shapeless hat drawn low, a great black cloak flying from his shoulders. […] They swept on, horse and rider a single formless black object like some fabulous monster; now they were only a few strides from the puzzled Kane, and he caught the glint of two burning eyes shadowed by the hat drawn low and the cape held high about the rider’s face. Then as he saw the gleam of a sword, he fired pointblank into that face. Then a blast of icy air engulfed him like the surge of a cold river, horse and man went down together, and the black horse and its rider swept over them.”\n\nKane is unhurt but upset and puzzled. The fragment ends there. The fragment was reprinted in an Italian book and a German/Hungarian publication before appearing in Fantasy Book, June 1984 which featured a posthumous collaboration with Fred Blosser completing the story.\n\nFred Blosser leaves the REH portion intact and adds an ending where Kane takes a room at a local inn, uncharacteristically drinks warm rum, and tells the landlord about the mysterious horsemen. The landlord tells Kane, “What you saw was one of the black riders of death – damned souls fated to ride the trails of the dark woods for all eternity – the shades of men so evil that even Hell outcast them. They are harbingers of – death. One who encounters them by night will die before the next sunrise.”\n\nSolomon Kane goes to bed and wakes in the night. An intruder is creeping into the room. Kane, without any fuss, kills the intruder. The landlord is called. “”One of thy forest bandits, belike,” said Kane.” The landlord agrees. “Well, thy prophecy nearly came true,” says Kane. The landlord nods, “Aye – and they’ll be angry now, the black sons of Satan. Ha – hark, sir.” Kane hears a malevolent wind like the trail of invisible horseman and the story ends. It’s an OK ending to REH’s fragment.\n\nIn 1994, Marvel Comics did a very loose adaptation and turned the story into a crossover event with Solomon Kane and Conan. The story “Death’s Dark Riders” is by Roy Thomas and Colin McNeil. It appeared in The Savage Sword of Conan #219. The story uses REH’s opening but in this version the “rider” seemingly crashes into Kane. And Kane is older and silver haired. Kane encounters three riders, all skull-faced, skeletal, and ephemeral. His horse had fallen from terror, not from impact. They become solid and capture Kane. The story then switches to Conan’s time period where he has stumbled into the lost city of Negari (from “The Moon of Skulls”). Kane, still in his own time period, has been taken back to Negari where a new king wants revenge. A hooky spooky ceremony brings Conan to Kane’s time period where the two start to battle. Due to the magic involved (I surmise) they can understand each other and end the fight forming an alliance. The story concludes in issue 220. There is action aplenty and by story’s end Conan is sent back to his own time period. This story was near the end of the run for the magazine. Roy Thomas must have thought a gimmick crossover would increase sales.\n\nThe incomplete fragment by Robert E. Howard was published in Solomon Kane, Baen, 1995 and The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane, Wandering Star, 1998 and Ballantine (Del Rey), 2004. But life wasn’t through with authors wanting to complete the story…\n\nAnother completion appeared in Crypt of Cthulhu #105 (2002) by C. J. Henderson. Henderson also has his story feature an older Solomon Kane. REH’s beginning is used without any edits. After the encounter with the spectral horseman Kane ponders his lifetime of travels. “You’re old, Kane. Too old.” He rejects the thought almost immediately, “I’ll be too old when the Devon churchyard is my bed chamber.”\n\nHenderson places this story chronologically after the poem “Solomon Kane’s Homecoming” and alludes to events therein. There is a lot of introspective thinking going on and some background is given as to why Kane is venturing in this area. The tale turns into a Cthulhu Mythos story with Kane battling Tsathoggua. Lovecraftian imagery is tossed out. Kane is losing the battle and wishes for “the sword of good and light the ju-ju man N’Longa had given him.”\n\nThe black rider reappears (the plural in the title is ignored) and the narration suggests that the horseman is Kane as he was years ago, younger and stronger. The horseman gives Kane the ju-ju stick and Kane is revitalized. “I’m coming home once more, my sweet, good Bess. And this time, I shall find thee waiting.” The black rider dismounts and joins old Kane in battle. “And, without a moment’s hesitation, Solomon Kane, the praise of his Lord, his God, bellowing from his grateful, smiling lips, threw himself into the fray once more.”\n\nI can understand the impulse to bring in the Cthulhu Mythos and be the guy that writes the “final” Kane story. Nevertheless, I wish Mr. Henderson had resisted those impulses as I didn’t particular enjoy this story.\n\nDark Horse completed the story as well in Solomon Kane: Death’s Black Riders #1-4 (2010). The issues were collected in the Graphic Novel pictured above. This is a complicated mish mash of a thing. “Rattle of Bones” is adapted for a chapter, but the main plot is about the monstrous black rider: a half spider, half man creature. It is all decent comic book fun but for some reason it never grabbed me. It’s quite possible that after reading all these other versions I was too tired to give it a fair shot.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nThis story has a somewhat complicated history. Robert E. Howard completed his final draft in 1929 and titled it “The Blue Flame of Vengeance.” It was a Solomon Kane story that lacked any supernatural content. REH was most likely looking to sell it to Argosy or some other pulp magazine instead of Weird Tales. He rewrote the story in 1932 and changed the title to “Blades of the Brotherhood” and substituted a new character, Malachi Grim, for Solomon Kane.\n\nAfter REH’s death “The Blue Flame of Vengeance” was sold to Arkham House for Over the Edge, an anthology published in 1964. It was rewritten as a supernatural story by John Pocsik. (More on him later.) When Red Shadows was published by Donald M. Grant in 1968, REH’s original story was edited, and the title was changed to “Blades of the Brotherhood” to avoid confusion with the Arkham House rewrite. This edited version was used again for the paperback Solomon Kane, Centaur Press, 1971. And also used in the Bantam and Baen paperbacks. The pure-text version now under the title “The Blue Flame of Vengeance” appeared in The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane, Wandering Star, 1998 and Ballantine Books (Del Rey) in 2004. The Malachi Grim version “Blades of the Brotherhood” was first published in the Robert E. Howard Foundation Newsletter, September 2007.\n\nLet’s go back to the 1960s for a bit. Here is an excerpt from a letter to Sprague de Camp from Glenn Lord where Glenn mentions the sell to Arkham House:\n\nAnd here is an excerpt from a letter to Sprague de Camp from August Derleth confirming he is using the story and felt the need to edit it:\n\nSo, today, we now have five different versions of this story: the Arkham House version rewritten by John Pocsik; the edited versions that appear in the Grant, Centaur, Bantam, and Baen books; the original REH version published in the Wandering Star and Del Rey books; and the Malachi Grim version published by the REH Foundation and to confuse further there is an earlier REH draft of “The Blue Flame of Vengeance” titled “The Blue Flame of Death” that was recently published in The REH Foundation Newsletter, Summer 2023. Pencil marks on the manuscript show this was an early draft.\n\nComparing the Grant, Centaur, Bantam and Baen versions of this story with the “pure text” version shows that there were several edits. The edits start in the very first sentence and continue throughout the story. Detailing all the edits is time-consuming and serves no real purpose anymore. By now, readers of this blog, should know that EVERYBODY edited REH for more than just spelling and punctuation prior to the Ballantine (Del Rey) Books.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the story in Savage Sword of Conan #33. Story by Don Glut and art by David Wenzel and Duffy Volhand.\n\nThe Centaur Press books did not publish the stories in any order. This story was placed chronologically between “The One Black Stain” and “The Hills of the Dead” in the Red Shadows hardcover book.\n\n“Blades of the Brotherhood” starts with Robert E. Howard, in the form of Jack Hollinster, having a duel with George Banway. I believe that in the same way Balthus, in “Beyond the Black River” is Bob Howard, so is Jack Hollinster. I say this with scant evidence but nevertheless think it true. My main evidence is in the narration which says, “…Hollinster’s closest friend […] did not understand the black furious moods into which his comrade sometimes fell.” (That, and blue eyes.)\n\nREH describes Sir Rupert as “portly” rather than “fat,” anticipating the sensitivity concerns of Roald Dahl’s publishers. 🙂\n\nSolomon Kane is introduced after the duel is stopped by Sir Rupert. Hollinster is upset that Banway is still alive, and Kane is on the trail of Jonas Hardraker, aka the Fishhawk. A bloody pirate. We are given some background for Kane. He once lived in Devon, has a violent past sailing with ungodly men, and has sombre eyes and a wolfish quality about him.\n\nKane leaves and later Hollinster is captured by Banway, his bullies, and allied pirates. His love, Mary Garvin, has been taken captive as well. Kane shows up since Hardraker is allied with Banway. Kane gets the drop on the pirate gang and kills Hardraker in a fair duel. After the duel a melee breaks out and Kane, Hollinster, and Mary Garvin all escape. Banway confronts Hollinster and Hollinster shoots Banway but Banway is unharmed and retreats. This appears to be a supernatural event at this point in the story.\n\nKane goes looking for the pirate gang and Banway shows up again and Hollinster’s cutlass shatters against Banway’s body. Kane takes over, realizes that Banway is wearing armor and in a COOL AF move stabs Banway in the eyeball. “”Through the eye ball and into the brain,” said Kane.”\n\nThe pirates have fled while all that was going on. Hollinster and Mary Garvin are thankful, and Kane ends the story with a bit more violent version of the Doc Savage oath.\n\nSo ends the story. But this article would not be complete without discussing the John Pocsik and Malachi Grim versions. Let’s start with John Pocsik. Mr. Pocsik was born in 1943 and resided (perhaps still does) in Kansas City, a fan of weird stories he had his first professional sell with “Casting the Stone” published in Over the Edge, Arkham House, 1964. August Derleth was impressed enough to trust Pocsik with rewriting REH’s story also published in Over the Edge. Pocsik had been previously published in fan magazines like Amra. Pocsik was associated with several REH projects: Bloodstar, “The Fiend Within” originally a pastiche featuring Solomon Kane but name-changed to Isaac Grail when the story was published in Ariel #1, and a Foreword for the REH poetry collection Night Images, Morningstar Press, 1976. Later he wrote “Starcrown”, for Heavy Metal magazine and “Elfspire” for Epic magazine. Beyond that I have no idea.\n\nPocsik’s version is a near complete rewrite. There might be 20% of REH’s prose in the story. Pocsik deletes the duel between Banway and Hollinster. The story starts by introducing Kane and detailing the reason he is after George Banway, the Fishhawk. (Yep, Banway is now the Fishhawk.)\n\nThe second chapter has Hollinster and Mary Garvin already in the clutches of Banway and Jonas Hardraker, who now works for Banway. Solomon Kane enters the thieves’ den and Hardraker attempts to shoot Kane but only grazes Kane’s cheek. Kane shoots Hardraker squarely in the forehead. Banway draws a triangle in the air and says, “Norte, nulada, lameshta” and incapacitates the Puritan. Kane is thrown in a tunnel where he has to fight a monstrous sea creature. Kane beats the creature and later confronts Banway and stabs him through the eyeball before he can do his magic. (Still cool AF, but less effective without the chainmail set up.) The story concludes in the same way, but Kane’s oath is a little less “oathy.”\n\nIt isn’t a bad story, but it should have been noted somewhere within the book that it had been severely edited and was in essence a brand-new story. Derleth’s notes make it seem a mere revision and completion.\n\nNow time for Malachi Grim: REH did make a few more changes besides the title when he revised the story. Jack Hollinster becomes Jack Holland, Rupert is no longer body-shamed, George Banway becomes George Blanard, Mary Garvin becomes Ellen Garvin and Solomon Kane becomes Malachi Grim.\n\nThere are other changes in word choice, but the story remains the same. In REH’s original, Kane wore a sinister green “Oriental” sash. Grim wears a regular green sash of unknown origin. In the Grant/Lord versions the sash is still of “Oriental” design but not sinister. (As said before EVERYBODY edited back then.)\n\nThe story ends the same way as the original. Grim’s oath is toned down and surprisingly resembles the Pocsik version. Fans that have read the original Kane story in either the Grant, Centaur, Bantam, Baen, or Del Rey versions do not need to fret over the scarcity of this version. Nothing really different except names and a few adjectives. Nevertheless, if Titan Books ever re-releases a new Solomon Kane collection all the various versions, REH’s and Pocsik’s, should be published together. Most of us are completists and want EVERYTHING. I know I do!\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\n“The Castle of the Devil” is an incomplete fragment by Robert E. Howard. It was first published in Red Shadows, Donald M. Grant, 1968. The first paperback appearance was in Solomon Kane, Centaur Press, 1971.\n\n“The Castle of the Devil” was published in its incomplete form in the Grant and Centaur Press books. An ending completed by Ramsey Campbell was added to the story when it was published in the Bantam and Baen Solomon Kane paperbacks. The original text was used in all editions. Ramsey Campbell started his prose exactly where Howard’s ended.\n\nThe Centaur Press books printed the stories in random order. The other editions printed the stories in chronological order. This is the fifth story in most editions. The Bantam editions included maps. In the first book the map was printed in reverse order. This was corrected in the second book.\n\nThere was a Solomon Kane RPG manual published in 2007.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the story in The Savage Sword of Conan #19. The story was by Don Glut with art by Alan Kupperberg and Sonny Trinidad. Dark Horse adapted the story in Solomon Kane #1 – 5. Those issues were collected in the Graphic Novel pictured below.\n\nKane is still traveling through the Black Forest.\n\nThis fragment is pretty short. You’re probably wondering how I’m going to make a decent blogpost out of it. Well, problem solved. There were three different endings published. The Ramsey Campbell, Marvel Comics, and Dark Horse endings are all different and all worthy of some discussion. Whew!\n\nLet’s start with REH’s original fragment. REH introduces us to John Silent. Silent is described as “a tall rangy man, broad of shoulder and deep of chest, with keen restless eyes which seemed at once to challenge and mock.” Silent meets Kane upon the road, “An Englishman? And a Puritan by the cut o’ that garb. I am glad to see a countryman in this outlandish domain, even such a melancholy fellow as you seem.” Kane tells Silent that he freed a wretch who hung on a gallows a few hours ago. Silent exclaims, “What! You cut down a man from Baron Von Staler’s gibbet? Name of the Devil, you will have both our necks in a noose!” Kane tells Silent that he intends to seek lodging at the Baron’s castle and ascertain what sort of man the Baron is and confront him about the hanging. Silent suggests that Kane is “either a maniac, a fool, or the most courageous man in the world!” and decides to join Kane in the adventure. The Howard fragment ends with Kane replying: “Your speech is wild and Godless but I begin to like you.”\n\nIt is a good start. REH is introducing a new character with an interesting name. The dialogue is crisp and moody. It has the promise of a good adventure but sadly REH never finished it.\n\n*** There are spoilers below for the Ramsey Campbell and Marvel Comics versions. My assumption is that since these versions were printed decades ago most everyone has already read them. If not, then skip over the next few paragraphs until you see paragraphs starting with italics and then repeat again. I do not provide spoilers for the Dark Horse version as that is more recent and probably not as widely read as these earlier versions. ***\n\nCampbell takes over exactly where REH left off and has the duo come upon a chained and long dead horse. Kane and Silent can tell the horse had been blinded. As Kane and Silent ponder what sort of monster could have done such a deed, the Baron’s soldiers surround the pair and disarm them. An older soldier named Kurt takes Kane and Silent to the castle. Kane notices its state of decay. When Kane meets the Baron, he detects something cruel about the man and notes something odd about his eyes. The Baron greets the men but stops suddenly saying “She is calling, Kurt.” Kane had not heard anything. Kurt leaves and the Baron continues conversing. Kane asks about the youth whom he had freed from the gallows.\n\nThe Baron basically tells Kane that his rule is law and others best not question it. Kurt returns and leads Kane and Silent to their rooms. Silent is anxious but Kane remains calm. Kurt returns to announce it is time to dine. The men are served wild boar. The Baron cuts off several slices and has Kurt take a plate to the Baroness. Kane asks if she is unwell. The Baron mysteriously replies that she is perfect, but no one may look upon her. The Baron tells them that the youth Kane freed dared to look upon her and that is why he was punished. The dinner ends and Kurt takes them back to their rooms. Kurt tells them that the Baron lost his sight when a horse threw him. That is why the Baron tortured the horse they saw just before being captured. Kurt defends the Baron saying he does not mistreat his men and was kind to the peasants in the past. They question Kurt about the Baroness, but Kurt is evasive.\n\nKane and Silent decide to explore the castle and rescue the Baroness. As they prepare to search the castle, the Baron and his soldiers confront the two men. Sword fighting ensues. Kane and the Baron duel and the Baron’s eyesight returns after a head-crash into a table. Kurt cradles the Baron while Kane watches. The Baron wants to see the Baroness now that his sight has returned. The Baron rushes into her room, Kane hears a woman scream, then the Baron rushes out of the room screaming, “You have stolen her!” and stabs Kurt. Kurt embraces the Baron, and they stumble down a flight of stairs. Kane enters the room and sees the Baroness has become a pale swollen creature. Confined to this chamber she went mad and overate. The Baron had stabbed her in his madness. Kurt with dying breath explains that she was his sister and was once beautiful.\n\nCampbell starts well. The blinded horse is a creepy image and the fact that the Baron is blind comes out in a slow subtle way that surprises the reader. The end is rather trite though. I probably shouldn’t have spoiled it. But it is predictable, and I doubt anyone that hasn’t sought it out already will be to upset with my summary.\n\nDon Glut, in his Marvel Comics adaptation, changes several things. In this version Kane cuts down a nude woman from the gallows. (Better visual for the teenage male audience.) Kane and Silent meet the same as in the REH version. REH’s dialogue is used. As in the Campbell continuation the duo is confronted by soldiers and captured. In this version, the castle is wholly satanic. Idols, alters, etc. Baron Von Staler is a goat-footed one-eyed man. Kane and Silent tell Von Staler that they are mercenaries seeking employment. They are shown a room. At night they wander the castle and see Von Staler performing a sacrifice and seeking the devil’s help in restoring his legs back to normal. Kane and Silent rush in and a melee ensues. Von Staler turns into a demon and when his soldiers arrive, they mistakenly kill their boss. Silent takes off with the rescued woman and Kane ponders his impending trip to Castle Frankenstein.\n\nThe Marvel version is comic booky. Naked women, satanic imagery, goat-footed villain, etc. It makes for a decent enough read but it has Kane going along with the mercenary subterfuge (Kane is not a devious person) and has a traumatized victim (the virgin woman being sacrificed) ready to bed John Silent the minute he rescues her. Don Glut should have known better, but it was the “swinging seventies” as Stan Lee might have said.\n\nThe Dark Horse adaptation is the most ambitious. The story begins with Kane killing some bandits and a wolf killing his horse. Kane cuts down the youth from the gallows as in the original story. He meets Silent in the same way. REH’s dialogue is used. They arrive at the castle and are greeted by Baron Von Staler and his beautiful Muslim wife. At dinner Kane mentions the hanged lad. The Baron and his wife claim no knowledge of the deed. A story is told of a devil worshipper, Vater Stuttman, who ran the abbey 200 years before, and thus giving the castle a bad reputation. Silent skulks about at night looking for a vault. Kane is confronted by the Baroness who tries to seduce him. Later in the story a werewolf is introduced.\n\nI’m not going to spoil the Dark Horse version with anymore summary. Suffice to say it is the most satisfying of the adaptations. It has the most characters, back story, and twists and turns. It is worthy of your own reading.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\n“Rattle of Bones” first appeared in Weird Tales, June 1929. It was reprinted in Skull-Face and Others, Arkham House, 1946. It saw print again in Magazine of Horror #11 and in Red Shadows, Donald M. Grant, 1968. The first paperback appearance was in Solomon Kane, Centaur Press, 1971.\n\nWhen this story was reprinted in Magazine of Horror #11, they included a full-page introduction and also reprinted “The Dweller in Dark Valley” in the issue.\n\nAll the various reprints of “Rattle of Bones” appear the same as the Weird Tales version. This story, unlike others, was not edited in Red Shadows or the Solomon Kane paperback.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the story in The Savage Sword of Conan #18. Solomon Kane appears in his “superhero” costume instead of his usual puritan garb.\n\nReturning to continental Europe, Solomon Kane pauses at a tavern in the Black Forest.\n\n“Rattle of Bones” is a pretty simple story. Solomon Kane and Gaston I’Armon are traveling through the Black Forest region of Germany. They stop at the Cleft Skull Inn. As they prepare to retire for the night, Kane rightly tells Gaston that they should look for something to bar the room’s door. “Let us see if there be any way to make fast the door,” said Kane. “I like not the looks of mine host.” “There are racks on door and jamb for a bar,” said Gaston, “but no bar.”\n\nKane is also wary of Gaston, who was “chance met” when Gaston overtook him on the forest road an hour before sunset. They had never met but Kane thinks he has seen Gaston somewhere before. The two men begin looking around and find a secret room. “The skeleton of a man!” said Gaston. “And behold, how his bony leg is shackled to the floor! He was imprisoned here and died.”\n\nKane sees that the skull was cleft and has his suspicions about the Inn confirmed. Gaston rends the shackles and mocks the corpse. “The dead should defend themselves,” laughed I’Armon. ” Somehow, I will slay the man who kills me, though my corpse climb up forty fathoms of ocean to do it.”\n\nKane prepares to leave but Gaston pulls a gun on him. “Gaston the Butcher!” said the Englishman somberly. “Fool that I was to trust a Frenchman!” Gaston intends to rob and kill Kane but the Innkeeper sneaks up behind Gaston and clefts Gaston’s skull. The Innkeeper tells a story of being falsely imprisoned and tortured years ago and now hates all mankind. Then the skeleton that Gaston freed grabs the Innkeeper and drags him to the secret room and shuts the door. Kane is left to ponder the weird event and the nuanced completion of Gaston’s death vow.\n\nREH fans will recognize Gaston’s vow as being similar to Belit’s vow in “Queen of the Black Coast.” Also, REH’s sympathy for wrongly imprisoned victims is similar to his opposition to brutal police tactics in “The God in the Bowl.” Finally, Kane’s advice about not trusting Frenchmen is way too broad. I like the French, but there is one particular French REH fan that bears some scrutiny. He’s ablaze with wrong ideas about de Camp. Oh well…\n\n“Rattle of Bones” was the third Solomon Kane story to appear in Weird Tales. It is pretty much a straight horror tale. It features a creepy setting, creepy characters, and something creepy happens. It definitely isn’t a sword and sorcery story. Two months after this story’s appearance, “The Shadow Kingdom” was published. And today we consider it both a fantasy story and a sword and sorcery story. There is a clear difference between “Rattle of Bones” and “The Shadow Kingdom.” “Rattle of Bones” weirdness is that of a ghost story. “The Shadow Kingdom” has more fantasy than weirdness; along with a ghost are legions of lizard men and a fantastic imaginary kingdom.\n\nThe first published Solomon Kane story, “Red Shadows” is mostly adventure combined with horror. The next two published tales, “Skulls in the Stars” and this one, “Rattle of Bones” are less adventure and more horror. But after the publication of that first King Kull story, the Solomon Kane stories next published in Weird Tales “The Moon of Skulls,” “The Hills of the Dead,” “Wings in the Night” and “The Footfalls Within” take on a characteristic that H. P. Lovecraft noted: “With these tales Mr. Howard struck what proved to be one of his most effective accomplishments – the description of vast megalithic cities of the elder world, around whose dark towers and labyrinthine nether vaults linger an aura of pre-human fear and necromancy which no other writer could duplicate.”\n\nI recently asked the OpenAI (artificial intelligence platform) to define “Sword and Sorcery” and got the following response:\n\nSword and sorcery is a subgenre of fantasy literature that typically involves heroic adventurers engaging in violent and dangerous quests in a fantastical world filled with magic, monsters, and ancient civilizations. The term was coined by author Fritz Leiber in the 1960s to describe a type of fantasy fiction that was different from the more epic and high-minded works of authors like J.R.R. Tolkien. Sword and sorcery stories often feature a lone hero or small group of adventurers who are driven by their own personal motives rather than a sense of duty or obligation. These heroes are typically skilled warriors or thieves who use their wits and physical prowess to overcome obstacles and enemies. The stories often involve themes of honor, revenge, and redemption, and can be quite violent and gritty in nature.\n\nEven though Solomon Kane, “Red Shadows” and these post “Rattle” stories are classified as sword and sorcery, “The Shadow Kingdom” is almost universally considered the first S&S story. Which (along with scalp psoriasis) makes me scratch my head. In my opinion, sword and sorcery, was once a good marketing term and it gave Robert E. Howard a certain cache to be “the father of” it. But I think it is limiting now. If I were to write a book, it would most likely be a Conan rip-off and it would be sword and sorcery, but I’d like to think it would be “high-minded” and I’d prefer it to be labelled simply “fantasy.” I’m thinking the same should be true for any future marketing of REH’s characters.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\n“Red Shadows” first appeared in Weird Tales, August 1928. This was the first Robert E. Howard story to feature his Puritan adventure hero, Solomon Kane. It was reprinted in Red Shadows, Donald M. Grant, 1968 and then in Solomon Kane, Centaur Press, 1971. It has been reprinted many times since.\n\nThis issue also featured the first published work by one of the greatest play-writes ever, Tennessee Williams. He was 16 years old when this was written. This story and the first appearance of Solomon Kane makes this one of the most valuable issues of Weird Tales.\n\nThe Grant, Centaur Press, and Bantam Books version of “Red Shadows” were edited. Here are the changes compared to the pure-text version published in The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane, Ballantine Books (Del Rey), 2004.\n\nCP: “Ha, you wake?\n\nDR: “Ha, you wake, white man?”\n\nCP: Kane asked the inevitable question:\n\nDR: Kane asked the inevitable question, following the habit of the Caucasian.\n\nCP: The native grinned\n\nDR: The black man grinned\n\nCP: No man like me!\n\nDR: No black man like me!\n\nCP: You – you hunt brother?\n\nDR: You white man, you hunt brother?\n\nCP: The native nodded.\n\nDR: The negro nodded.\n\nCP: the native grinned\n\nDR: the negro grinned\n\nCP: Listen:\n\nDR: Listen, white man:\n\nCP: savage giants\n\nDR: black giants\n\nCP: lifted the Englishman\n\nDR: lifted the white man\n\nCP: dark faces\n\nDR: black faces\n\nCP: native\n\nDR: black man\n\nCP: … where I found you gone,” said Kane.\n\nDR: … where I found you gone.”\n\nCP: A slave\n\nDR: A negro slave\n\nCP: evilest soul\n\nDR: blackest soul\n\nCP: giant savage\n\nDR: giant negro\n\nCP: giant\n\nDR: giant black\n\nCP: Englishman’s eyes\n\nDR: white man’s eyes\n\nCP: savage’s eye\n\nDR: negro’s eye\n\nCP: Englishman\n\nDR: white man\n\nCP: savage\n\nDR: A black man\n\nCP: his muscles\n\nDR: his great, black muscles\n\nCP: figures\n\nDR: black figures\n\nCP: the tribesman believed\n\nDR: the blacks believed\n\nCP: the tribesmen\n\nDR: the negroes\n\nCP: The warriors\n\nDR: The blacks\n\nCP: Songa, the King\n\nDR: the black king\n\nCP: man-with-eyes-like-a-leopard\n\nDR: white-man-with-eyes-like-a-leopard\n\nCP: feathered warriors\n\nDR: feathered black warriors\n\nCP: giant’s face\n\nDR: negro’s face\n\nCP: column of a neck\n\nDR: black column of a neck\n\nCP: hand\n\nDR: black hand\n\nCP: man\n\nDR: black man\n\nCP: giant\n\nDR: black man\n\nCP: warrior\n\nDR: negro\n\nCP: Puritan\n\nDR: white man\n\nCP: giant native\n\nDR: black man\n\nCP: warrior\n\nDR: negro\n\nCP: powerful warrior\n\nDR: black man\n\nCP: Englishman\n\nDR: white man\n\nCP: native\n\nDR: negro\n\nCP: warrior\n\nDR: negro\n\nCP: warrior\n\nDR: negro\n\nThose are the edits made for this story. Not as many as some other Solomon Kane African adventures.\n\nMarvel Comics adapted the story in Marvel Premiere #33 and 34. Story by Roy Thomas and interior art by Howard Chaykin. Kane was given a sort of superhero costume instead of his usual Puritan garb. The hat and cloak were back in fashion with the adaptation in The Sword of Solomon Kane #1.\n\nFor a time, Kane is a captain in the French army, until wanderlust causes him to move on.\n\nEvery well-read REH fan knows this story. Solomon Kane comes across a dying girl and swears to avenge her. “”Men shall die for this,” he said coldly.” Kane tracks the girl’s killer, Le Loup, to a village and Le Loup asks, “What sort of man are you, Monsieur, who takes up a feud of this sort merely to avenge a wench unknown to you?” Le Loup escapes in this first round but Kane follows the trail to Africa. Kane is captured and meets N’Longa for the first time. We learn that Kane “was not wholly a Puritan, though he thought of himself as such.” (Self-identifying as something you aren’t is controversial these days!) There is magic and gorillas along the way and Kane eventually kills Le Loup. If you haven’t read it, you should. It’s a great story.\n\n“Red Shadows” was the first Solomon Kane story to appear in Weird Tales. Robert E. Howard sent the story, originally titled, “Solomon Kane” to Argosy first. The story was rejected but came back with a personal note from the editor that REH mentioned in a letter dated February 20, 1928 to his friend Tevis Clyde Smith.\n\nThere has been some speculation on how REH came up with the name, Solomon Kane. The most common idea is that REH simply took two names from the Bible. King Solomon and Cain (subtly changing the spelling). It has been suggested REH borrowed the name from his father’s friend Solomon Chambers. Others suggesting it came from a character with the same name in W. C. Tuttle’s story “Sir Piegan Passes” published in the August 10, 1923, edition of Adventure. It’s a good name wherever the inspiration came from. The title “Red Shadows” was supplied by Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright.\n\nREH liked the “Next Month” blurb in the preceding issue and mentioned it to Tevis Clyde Smith in a letter received around June 1928.\n\n“Red Shadows” is arguably the first Sword and Sorcery tale. Generally, that title goes to “The Shadow Kingdom” which stars Kull of Atlantis. Lin Carter assigned “The Phoenix on the Sword” as the first since Conan became the standard that most emulated. In any event, Robert E. Howard is considered to be the Father of Sword & Sorcery.\n\nREH expressed a desire to travel to Africa in an October 1930 letter to H. P. Lovecraft:\n\nThe rejection letters’ reference to Eugene O’Neill “jungle stuff” comes from O’Neill’s play The Emperor Jones. A few pages into the play O’Neill introduces the drums:\n\nJONES [Boastfully.] Silver bullet bring me luck anyway. I kin outguess, outrun, outfight, an’ outplay de whole lot o’ dem all ovah de board any time o’ de day er night! You watch me! [From the distant hills comes the faint, steady thump of a tom−tom, low and vibrating. It starts at a rate exactly corresponding to normal pulse beat−72 to the minute−and continues at a gradually accelerating rate from this point uninterruptedly to the very end of the play.]\n\n[JONES starts at the sound. A strange look of apprehension creeps into his face for a moment as he listens. Then he asks, with an attempt to regain his most casual manner.] What’s dat drum beatin’ fo’?\n\nHoward emulates Eugene O’Neill by having Kane hear a constant drumming starting in the third chapter “The Chant of the Drums.”\n\nREH ends the story, “Afar the drums muttered: “The wisdom of our land is ancient; the wisdom of our land is dark; whom we serve, we destroy. Flee if you would live, but you will never forget our chant. Never, never,” sang the drums.” As good as this story was the Weird Tales readers ranked it for third place.\n\nBut Solomon Kane was destined to return."
