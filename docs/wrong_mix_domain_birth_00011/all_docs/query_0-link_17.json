        "text": "The title of one of Thomas Wolfe’s most famous novels, You Can’t Go Home Again (1940), captures succinctly the essence of the novel. The protagonist, George Webber, writes a novel about his hometown; but its residents immediately dismissed the traditional fiction disclaimer. You know the one — “Names, characters, places and incidents either are the product of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales.” Needless to say, they are quite peeved with Webber. Like Gatsby, Webber learns that he cannot repeat his past: “You can’t go back home to your family, back home to your childhood … back home to a young man’s dreams of glory and of fame… back home to places in the country, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time – back home to the escapes of Time and Memory.” No wonder, the title has become such a popular catchphrase, understood by so many who have never read the book.\n\nAlthough famous authors can’t go home again, their fans can certainly go to their homes — especially if the authors’ birthplaces or homes have been transformed into heritage sites or better yet, museums complete with gift shops, to honor their life and work.
