Born in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, he later emigrated to the United States where he became a naturalised citizen and established his name in the burgeoning publishing industry.\n\nGernsback was referred to as \"Hugo the Rat\" by both H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith as a result of his tendency to pay authors both poorly and late for their submissions.\n\nIn Fiction[]\n\nIn \"The Battle that Ended the Century\", the character Ivor K. Rodent was a private jab at Gernsback.\n\n\"In the Walls of Eryx\" contains a species of creature dubbed Ugrats, a reference to his nickname of Hugo the Rat.\n\n[]"
