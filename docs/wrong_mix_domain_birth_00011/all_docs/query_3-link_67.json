        "text": "A 5,000 word letter written by H.P. Lovecraft has been found by a PhD student from London. James Machin discovered the letter in an American archive. Interestingly, it’s written to J.C. Henneberger, the publisher of Weird Tales in the 1920s.\n\nThe letter was several pages of closely packed typescript sent from 598 Angell Street, Providence, Rhode Island—the house the family had moved to in 1904 after the death of Lovecraft’s grandfather—and dated February 2, 1924. The year was to be a significant one for Lovecraft: he was about to uproot himself from his home of 20 years to join his soon-to-be wife Sonia Haft Green…\n\nMr. Machin was kind enough to scan in the letter, and I’ve included the first page below. Click here to read the entire letter, and for some great background and commentary on it and on this time in Lovecraft’s life."
