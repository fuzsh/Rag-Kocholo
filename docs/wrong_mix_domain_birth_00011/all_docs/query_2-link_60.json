        "text": "Howard Phillips Lovecraft, born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, is considered one of the greatest and most influential horror fiction writers of all time.\n\nThrough his many novels and short stories, principally printed in the pulp magazine \"Weird Tales,\" he created the Cthulhu Mythos, which included such places as \"Arkham\" and \"Innsmouth\" as well as the famous cursed book \"The Necronomicon.\" His unique brand was \"cosmic horror,\" which often operated under the theme that mankind was largely insignificant in a vastness of time and space, wherein evil and powerful deities roamed whilst waiting for a chance to reclaim the Earth.\n\nWhile achieving only modest recognition in his own life time and despite dying poor, Lovecraft's writings have since become extremely popular. His influence can be found in hundreds of works in many different fields of art such as literature, movies, music, comic books, cartoons, role playing games and video games.\n\nLovecraft died from cancer in 1937, in the Jane Brown Memorial Hospital."
