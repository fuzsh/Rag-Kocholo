        "text": "You can submit your application to be a volunteer at any time and we will be in touch a few months before the festival. Volunteering is definitely work that starts well before the fest and continues during and a bit after. We ask everyone to put up posters around town, we meet a few times before the fest, ask you to help boost us regularly on social media, follow a work schedule during the event, etc. Volunteers don't end up seeing that many movies as a general rule of thumb, but we do make sure that you get to experience some of the festival from the attendee side.\n\nAbout the Festival\n\nThe H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival® & CthulhuCon™ promotes the works of H.P. Lovecraft, literary horror, and weird tales through cinematic adaptations by professional and amateur filmmakers, panel discussions, author readings, gaming, art, and sometimes live music. The festival was founded in Portland, OR in 1995 by Andrew Migliore, with the desire that H.P. Lovecraft would be rightly recognized as a master of gothic horror and his work more faithfully adapted to film and television.\n\nThese links will take you to the section for submitting Films and Screenplays, and the Micro Fiction Contest. (or you can just scroll down to see all of them.) If you are looking for information on how to become a guest, artist, vendor, etc, please go to the festival portal (above) and then navigate to the corresponding section.\n\nSubmit a Film or Screenplay\n\nSubmit to the Lovecraftian Micro Fiction Contest\n\nS. T. Joshi has prepared comprehensive editions of H. P. Lovecraft’s collected fiction, essays, poetry, and letters. He is the author of The Weird Tale (1990), The Modern Weird Tale (2001), I Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft (2010), and Unutterable Horror: A History of Supernatural Fiction (2012), and has edited the anthology American Supernatural Tales (2007) and the Black Wings series of Lovecraftian tales."
