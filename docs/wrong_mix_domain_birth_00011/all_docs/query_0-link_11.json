        "text": "-by Gina Terzino\n\n“I am Providence.”\n\n-H.P. Lovecraft\n\nOn August 23rd, I attended the Eldritch Ball at the Providence Biltmore, part of the Necronomicon, the weekend–long celebration of Providence native son and author Howard Phillips (better known as H.P.) Lovecraft’s work and life (“Eldritch” is an archaic word meaning “strange” or “eerie”…but I didn’t know that then). It was a fancy dress ball, and so I dug deep and found a formal dress that could pass for the 1920’s (when many of Lovecraft’s writings took place). My partner wore a tux jacket, dress shirt, bowtie and kilt, completed by his top hat. We were ready and off to the ball, like Cinderella!\n\nWhen we stepped off the elevator on the 17th floor, however, we noticed something a little odd. The people working the admission table were dressed in a pair of horns and an elder sign on the forehead, resepctively…Wait, what? After checking in, we stepped into the grandeur of the ballroom…and noticed that people were adorned with tentacles, alien parts, brightly-colored makeup, gold lamé…Apparently this was not quite the formal event we had thought it was going to be. We had imagined a well-lit room, a band playing ’20’s/’30’s music (the time period in which he wrote most of his works), dancing, tuxedos and ballgowns, perhaps a few readings from his work, or speeches about his life…\n\nWhat we observed were people cosplaying, dressed as their favorite Lovecraftian characters and creatures, some even dressed as the Great Old One, Cthulhu Himself (how they got away with that without being driven mad is a headscratcher…). Gentlemen in Victorian attire, with top hats, bowlers, fezzes and vests. Ladies in bustles and long skirts. People sporting regular cocktail attire, but with masks, or painted faces. Smoking jackets and ascots, a Louis the XVI (not sure what the Lovecraft connection was to that…), people in white doctor coats (possibly from the story “Herbert West—Reanimator”?), even Death in His formal black hooded robe made an appearance. A fantastic opportunity to “people” watch, as we sipped our White Russians.\n\nThe MCs were from New York’s Phantom Creep Theatre and Atlanta’s Silver Scream Spook Show and provided creepy comedy antics as they hosted and called out raffle ticket numbers from the red and green backlit stage. The music was by Providence-based band, Alec K. Redfearn and the Eyesores, who used traditional instruments such as accordion, violin, stand up bass, French horn, percussion, organ, and electronics to layer a dark, eerie sound to accompany the dark meeting of like minds. All the while, silent films made from Lovecraft’s stories played on a screen to the left of the stage.\n\nThe turnout only shows how beloved a figure H.P. Lovecraft remains to this day. Dismissed by some as a “just a horror writer”, Lovecraft touched on existential-esque themes of isolation and mankind having very little significance in the vast realms of the universe. The protagonist rarely successfully fought his way to freedom—most of the time he either went insane or perished by the hand of inexplicable, unstoppable alien forces. Lovecraft also knew well that mankind’s worst fear was fear of the unknown—he consistently found that nerve in his readers and pressed on it until it was unbearable. This was his mastery. He wrote literature, calling on experiences he had all his life and fictionalizing them in dark and symbolic detail. He loved his hometown of Providence, leaving only once to live in New York with his wife of two years; after the marriage failed, he returned home to Providence and never left again.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft is truly Providence’s legacy, as evidenced by all who came to honor him."
