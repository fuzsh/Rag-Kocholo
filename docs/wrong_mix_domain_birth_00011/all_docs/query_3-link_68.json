        "text": "Sketch of a Deep One by John Cebollero\n\nAs stated earlier, I recommend placing humans (Homo sapiens) and Deep Ones (Homo aquatium) in the same genus (Homo) since they can inter-breed. This is not unprecedented in the science of taxonomy. For example, studies in 2010 suggest that humans and Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) may have inter-bred sometime between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago. Based on some DNA analyses, Eurasian humans and Neanderthals may share between 1 to 4% of the same genes in their separate genomes. If this Neanderthal / Eurasian human interbreeding hypothesis (published in Nature in 2012) is correct, then in a sense, “true” or “pure” humans may be those of direct African decent.\n\nComparison between Neanderthals and humans (from cdn_zmescience.com)\n\nHowever, the Neanderthal / Eurasian human interbreeding hypothesis is by no means well established. There are questions over potential contamination of samples and the alterative hypothesis that the genetic differences / similarities among non-African humans, African humans and Neanderthals were already developed in Africa and thus no inter-breeding was involved. However, the fact that human and Neanderthal genomes are at least 99.5% identical and that they coexisted for thousands of years, indicates that inter-breeding may have been a possibility.\n\nModern reconstruction of a Neanderthal man from BBC news\n\nWithin the global human gene pool, the average genetic diversity among humans is about 0.1%, with differences among some portions of the genome (or specific genes) being as high as 1%. When comparing humans to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), older studies identified the genetic difference being only 2%, however, more recent studies have identified the genetic difference between these two species as being between 4 to 5%. In contrast, the genetic difference between humans and the common bottle nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncates) is surprisingly smaller than previously thought, being less than 5%. If the genetic difference between humans and chimps is similar to the difference between human and dolphins, then the simple appearance and habitat of an organism is not a good predictor of genetic relationships. Given the fact that Deep Ones can breed with humans, the genetic difference between these two species must be low, being somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0%.\n\nInnsmouth Folk from the talented artist Simon Dominic Brewer\n\nNext time the discussion will focus more on the genetic diversity of the Deep Ones and their inter-breeding with humans. Thank you – Fred.\n\nIn the previous article we discussed in detail the concept of hybridization. This article will also cover hybridization but specifically relative to the Deep Ones. In The Shadow of Innsmouth HPL was very clear that the Deep Ones could mate with humans to give rise to hybrids. These hybrids were different than both humans and Deep Ones in that they started out looking human and eventually turned into Deep Ones (see below).\n\nFrom S. Petersen’s Field Guide to Cthulhu Monsters: A Field Observer’s Handbook of Preternatural Entities (figure is called the Four Stages of Degeneration [for a Deep One]).\n\nWhat is interesting about the hybridized Deep Ones is that they are not a mix or “blending” of the two species as most hybrids are (e.g. crossing the horse with the donkey, producing the mule). Instead, the hybridization is a form of “metamorphosis”, where the “larval” stage is human and the mature “adult” stage is the Deep One.\n\nA similar hybridized offspring transmutation was on display in David Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly (1986). In that movie, Seth Brundle invents a transporter device and tries it on himself. Unknown to him a fly gets into the same “telepod”. While the transporter was successful, it integrated his genome (entire set of an organism’s genes) with that of the fly’s. The net result was his transporter became a “gene-splicing machine”. Initially, Seth looks fine but slowly begins to go through a metamorphosis to eventually become a human-fly hybrid (a Brundle-fly was the term used in the movie). The stages of this metamorphosis are shown below.\n\nMetamorphosis from human to human-fly hybrid from David Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly from 1986 (source: the BlogSpot Voz En Off-7)\n\nAnother example of the “integration” of two sets of genomes from district species is seen in the Alien movies. While the human / alien (xenomorph) interaction may first appear to be a simple host / parasitoid or prey / predator relationship, the genetic relationships are far more complex.\n\nAlien Xenomorph (from David Fincher’s Alien 3)\n\nThe facehugger implants an embryo into the human, which then hatches and kills the host. However, it has been noted in all of the Alien and AVP movies (including Prometheus) that the xenomorph does inherit some of the genetic material of its host. This is why the xenomorph in Alien 3 ran on all fours (since it’s host was an ox or dog depending on what version of the movie you watch) as opposed to the bipedal forms that arise from humans. So are Deep Ones the product of true hybridization or is there some type of “parasitic” usage of the human genome like the xenomorph?\n\nTo achieve such dramatic but gradual metamorphosis, say from a tadpole to a frog, a complex array of genes must be switched “on and off” at keys times and in a specific sequence. Any disruption (e.g. pollution) in this sequence can result in mutations. This is one of the reasons why amphibians, frogs in particular, are such effective environmental indicators. Similar genetic mechanisms must be in effect with hybridized Deep Ones.\n\nWith everything that is known about the Deep Ones, there are still a lot of unanswered questions from a biological perspective. For example, can hybridized Deep Ones reproduce? Can they reproduce in both their “larval” (human) and adult (Deep One) stages? If they are fertile, can they only reproduce with other hybrids or can the hybrids also reproduce with humans as well as “pure” Deep Ones. In addition, is there a distinction (either in phenotype or genotype) between hybrid Deep Ones and pure Deep Ones? Next time, we will discuss genetic variability in both the human and Deep One genomes and how they interact. Thank you – Fred\n\nInnsmouth Troublemaker by Matt Dixon (from The Art of H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos; edited by Pat Harrigan and Brian Wood)\n\nHello and Happy New Year! This is the first part of a discussion on hybridization and the Deep Ones. This article will focus on the concept of hybridization while the subsequent article will focus more on the hybridization of Deep Ones and humans.\n\nIn addition to metamorphosis, hybridization is another important biological concept in discussions on the Deep Ones. Hybridization is simply defined as the breeding of individuals from different species (Tijs Goldschmidt’s Darwin’s Dreampond). However, the classical definition of a species is a population of individuals that can freely interbreed with each other but not with others from another population (thus another species). Therefore, hybridization does not seem possible but it does occur both artificially and in nature and is a testament to the fact that the concept of “species” is not clear-cut and clearly defined. Instead, species is more of a dynamic, fluid term used to aid in taxonomically classifying various groups of organisms. As will be described later, this fact is an important concept to keep in mind when discussing the Deep Ones.\n\nA resident of Innsmouth, The Deep One by the talented artist Greg P. Onychuk\n\nAn example of hybridization that most of us are familiar with is crossing a female horse (Equus caballus) and a male donkey (Equus asinus) resulting in a hybrid – the mule (Equus asinus x Equus caballus). Horse and donkeys are not in the same genus so it is not surprising that the mule is sterile.\n\nA mule (from www.wikipedia.org)\n\nIn my line of work as an enviromnetal consultant / limnologist, we frequently conduct fish surveys to determine how best to manage the fish community of lakes and ponds. An important component of this includes developing a fish stocking program. We will commonly stock hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops), to improve recreational fishing and enhance the water quality of lakes and reservoirs. Since the hybrid striped bass is a cross between striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and white bass (Morone chrysops), they are also sterile and thus their populations can be easily controlled.\n\nHybrid striped bass being stocked in a reservoir in northern New Jersey\n\nBoth the mule and the hybrid striped bass exemplify an important point relative to hybridization. The closer two populations are, spatially, physiologically and genetically, the greater the chance they can produce offspring. In addition, two closely related species can not only produce offspring but they may also produce offspring that can reproduce on their own. An example of this are the cichlid fishes in Lake Tangqanyika or Lake Victoria in Africa. The high level of diverse aquatic habitat, coupled with the high rates of reproduction of cichlid fishes, has resulted in a proliferation of these species (a conversation on how the introduction of the Nile Perch has negatively impacts these species will not be covered here).\n\nA variety of African Cichlids (from www.indianapublicmedia.org)\n\nThese cichlid species frequently undergo inter-species fertilization, resulting in a variety of hybrids. If the hybrid offspring do not re-breed with their parental species and only breed among their fellow hybrids, a new species could potentially emerge (Tijs Goldschmidt’s Darwin’s Dreampond).\n\nTo summarize, hybridization has the potential to generate sterile or fertile individuals. In turn, fertile individuals have the potential to produce an entirely new species. Is this occurring when Deep Ones and humans breed? This concept will be discussed in detail in the next article. Thank you.\n\nAmazing piece of art – “View of Innsmouth” by Alberto Vasquez\n\nThe offspring between humans and Deep Ones go through a metamorphosis that is somewhat unique to these resulting hybrids. From a purely biological perspective the term metamorphosis refers to a substantial and relatively quick change in morphology (general appearance) as an animal grows from a young or larval stage to an adult. This process is fairly common in Terran animal life. An example from the phylum Arthropoda is given below:\n\nLife cycle of Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) showing metamorphosis (from www.shawnfischer.com)\n\nIn the case of the Monarch butterfly, a caterpillar hatches from an egg. The caterpillar is very limited in mobility and typically uses camouflage and/or the accumulation of bad-tasting compounds in its tissues to avoid being eaten. The sole purpose of the caterpillar is to eat (and eat…and eat). It will continuously feed on vegetation until it begins to form a chrysalis, where its cells will breakdown, change and re-organize to finally hatch as a butterfly. In contrast to the caterpillar, the butterfly is a highly mobile organism that will feed on nectar from flowers instead of leaves. The chief purpose of the butterfly is to mate and lay eggs for the next generation of butterflies.\n\nA more appropriate example of metamorphosis, relative to this discussion, is the bullfrog.\n\nLife cycle of American bullfrog(Lithobates catesbeianus) showing metamorphosis (from Sheri Amsel at www.exploringnature.org)\n\nIn this example, bullfrogs lay their eggs in freshwater, typically a pond or lake, and the young hatch as tadpoles. The tadpoles are well adapted to an aquatic life; swimming, breathing with the use of gills and feeding on algae attached to rocks and other surfaces. However, in a more gradual form of metamorphosis, the tadpoles eventually become adult frogs that are adapted to land. That is, they live and breath (with lungs and through their skin) out of the water and feed on terrestrial insects and other invertebrates. However the bullfrog, like all amphibians, must return to the water to reproduce and lay their eggs.\n\nThe evolutionary advantage to such a metamorphosis is that the bullfrog and tadpole take advantage of a number of ecological niches. While the tadpoles are aquatic herbivores, the adult bullfrog is a terrestrial carnivore. Thus, if one portion of the ecosystem is seriously damaged or altered (e.g. pond dries up during a particularly dry summer) and one part of the life cycle is negatively impacted, the other part still has a chance of re-establishing the population.\n\nDirecting this conversation toward the metamorphosis of humans to hybridized Deep Ones, this example of batrachian evolution raises the questions: Is there an evolutionary advantage to being a hybrid Deep One? If so, what is that advantage?\n\nOld Innsmouth by the talented artist Greg P. Onychuk; drawing displays some of the common traits of the hybridizing Deep Ones\n\nSimply based on HPL’s story The Shadow Over Innsmouth, there does appear to be both biological and, perhaps more significantly, cultural evolutionary advantages to being a hybrid Deep One. Spending the first 20 to 30 years of their lives as humans allows them to study human society and gather intelligence on this species. Knowing where humans reside and where they fish provides useful information on where the Deep Ones themselves should live and congregate. The Deep Ones are known to interact with select groups or geographical populations of humans and the selection of these populations is probably based on detailed reconnaissance through the centuries.\n\nAnother evolutionary advantage may be in the case of colonization. Having a “larval” stage (e.g. humans) that is terrestrial for a substantial amount of time, provides the opportunity for the movement and relatively rapid colonization of other areas of the planet that are not limited to movement along coastal waters. The Shadow Over Innsmouth exemplifies this by Old Captain Marsh bring Polynesian Deep Ones back to New England from the Pacific.\n\nYet another possible evolutionary advantage is introducing more genetic variability into the Deep One gene pool to maximize adaptability to varying environmental conditions. However, such an advantage is only transferred to offspring if the hybrids themselves can viably reproduce. A discussion on hybrids and their ability to reproduce will be our next discussion. Thank you – Fred\n\nWe are now moving away from Lovecraft’s extra-dimensional entities and back to Terran life. Specifically, over the next series of articles we will be discussing the Deep Ones.\n\nA Deep One in the later stages of metamorphosis (artwork by Steve Maschuck)\n\nThe Deep Ones are a race of bipedal, marine creatures, found throughout the oceans of the world. In addition to referring to this aquatic race, the name “Deep Ones” also refers to the entities that are the genetic “product” of the hybridization of humans (Homo sapiens) and Deep Ones (Homo aquatium). It may be controversial to place the Deep Ones within the same genus as humans, however, the fact that these two population groups can have offspring is strong evidence to support this taxonomic decision.\n\nA number of subjects will be discussed in the upcoming weeks to months regarding the Deep Ones such as a description of the metamorphorsis of the hybrids from human to Deep One, how the hybrids may differ and be similar to “pure” Deep Ones, and theories as to how and why such hybridization occurs (is it simply an outcome of natural selection or is it part of an experiment of artificial selection?). Other issues such as general biology and religious practices will also be covered.\n\nAugust Derleth’s The Mask of Cthulhu (cover art by R. Taylor)\n\nFinally, it should be noted that while the name “Deep One” was first coined in HPL’s The Shadow Over Innsmouth, it was only used twice in that story and both only occur in the last three paragraphs. This is really a testament to HPL’s powerful ability to capture one’s imagination with his storytelling. Next time we will discuss in detail the metamorphosis of human to Deep One in the hybrids. Thank you – Fred\n\nAs previously mentioned there is very little information on the spawn of Cthulhu. We know they somewhat resemble their Master or Parent Cthulhu and that they came down to Earth with him approximately 350 million years ago. They battled with the Elder Ones and peace was achieved. The spawn built the great city of R’lyeh, which then mysteriously sunk into the Pacific Ocean around 300 million years ago. To this day, Cthulhu and his spawn lie entombed in R’lyeh asleep and sending dreams to the sensitive.\n\nCity of R’lyeh by the great Lovecraftian artist John Coulthart\n\nVery little is known about the spawn of Cthulhu; however Hiraku Takeoka, a gentleman from Japan who I have met on Facebook, made a very good point (see below). Lin Carter, a well known writer of fantasy, science-fiction and horror, contributed to the Cthulhu Mythos, which included the Xothic Cycle. Mr. Carter was well known to flesh out or “fill in the gaps” in Lovecraft’s mythology but I want to focus this article on the spawn of Cthulhu.\n\nChaosium’s The Xothic Legend Cycle, Lin Carter’s Mythos fiction (edited by Robert M. Price)\n\nSpecifically, according to Mr. Carter’s stories Cthulhu brought a number of other entites to Earth from Xothic, a green binary star. Some of these entities included Cthulhu’s “mate” Idh-yaa, and their progeny – Zoth-Ommog, Ghatanothoa, Ythogtha and Cthylla (The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana by Daniel Harms). While this description makes it sound like Cthulhu is the father of one happy “Old One family”, this is a very deceptive interpretation.\n\nGhatanothoa by the talented artist Mike Bukowski\n\nBiological concepts based on sexual reproduction, such as parents, progeny and siblings, more than likely do not apply to Cthulhu and his spawn. Nothing is known about the reproduction of these entities; however, the prevailing hypothesis is that they reproduce primarily through mitosis. That is, they reproduce similar to basic cell division. Once the cell or individual attains a certain size or volume they split. It is not known if the conventional Darwinian mechanics of natural selection apply to Cthulhu and his relatives but more than likely Cthulhu is the largest, and thus leader of the spawn.\n\nFollowing this line of logic, Mr. Takeoka made an excellent point that these “family members” of Cthulhu’s may be larger representatives of the spawn. Again, if Cthulhu is the largest and oldest of the spawn, he is the leader. The other family members must be other leaders of the spawn (subordinates to Cthulhu) and have grown to such a size to be named, known and worshipped by humanity and other races in our universe.\n\nAnother incredible drawing of a spawn of Cthulhu by KingOvRats\n\nTo conclude, not much is known of the spawn of Cthulhu. However, to date, they are the most “alien” of entities that we reviewed on this blog site. One thing is for sure, the spawn of Cthulhu is very distinct from the next group of entities we will be discussing – the Deep Ones. Thank you and Happy Holidays! Fred\n\nBoth the Mi-Go and the spawn of Cthulhu are identified by HPL as being from outside of our known universe. In addition, it is recognized that these entities are made of different matter than us. But how different is different? Relative to Lovecraftian entities this is a fairly important question, particularly since there appears to be an inverse relationship that the more “different” an entity is from us, the less we understand them or their motivations. In addition, this difference is not simply based on appearance and morphology. This article will briefly review this topic.\n\nBack in August as part of my presentation on the Old Ones at the Necronomicon, I used the analogy of trees in understanding the differences among various forms of life. This is by no means an innovative idea; Charles Darwin famously coined the term “Tree of Life”, based at least partially on a scribble he did in one of his notebooks (see below).\n\nDarwin’s Tree of Life\n\nAs described in a previous article on this blog site, Darwin’s Tree of Life now a days can be thought of more as a shrub rather than a tree (thanks primarily to the knowledge we have gained on genetics and microbial evolution over the last 150 years). Thus, all life on Earth can be thought of to be on the same shrub, with each twig or tip representing a distinct species (keeping complicating microbial processes factors such as horizontal gene transfer out of the picture for now).\n\nHumans are eukaryotic organisms; our cells are endosymbiotic “experiments” where simpler forms of life (bacteria) are merged together to form more complex forms of life such as animals, plants, fungi and protozoa. These experiments were run by the Elder Ones. Another outcome of their experiments with native prokaryotic Earth life was the development of the “super-eukaryote” – the Shoggoth. While incredibly adaptable to varying environments and means of obtaining energy (food), the Elder Ones intentionally bioengineered the shoggoths to be incapable of reproducing, unless facilitated by their masters in the “shoggoth pits”.\n\nSince prokaryotic Earth life was used to create the shoggoths, these organisms would technically be another branch on Earth’s shrub of life. Although a more distant and distinct branch, the shoggoths would still be a branch on Earth’s shrub. This is in sharp contrast to the Elder Ones, which are presumed to be truly alien; that is, they originated and evolved on another world before coming to Earth. Thus, to use the shrub analogy, while the Shoggoths are on our Shrub of Life, the Elder Ones would be on another entirely different shrub, representing another world’s evolutionary machine. This means while the shoggoths are our cousins, the Elder Ones are more “different” relative to humans.\n\nShoggoth and an Elder One by the talented artist Ian Miller (for the cover of HPL’s At the Mountains of Madness – Panther Horror Edition)\n\nIn contrast to the Elder Ones, the Mi-Go are said to have to have come from “outside” of our known universe and thus are very different than humans, Shoggoths or Elder Ones. Thus, not only do the Mi-Go from a different shrub, but their shrub is from an entirely different “forest”.\n\nEvidence for this “difference” is provided by the fact that the MiGo can’t be photographed by standard photographic equipment and how clumsy they are both in walking and flying in our atmosphere and in our gravity. However, while they are very different from the residents of our universe, something is known of their motivation in their dealings with our world. They need some metal or material on Earth that is somewhat rare in our universe and so they conduct mining operations. Thus they interact with the “natives” of Earth, form strange alliances with certain people and have an excellent knowledge of human physiology and anatomy.\n\nIncredible drawing of a M-Go by Nathan Rosario\n\nWhile the spawn of Cthulhu are also from “outside” they appear to originate from a more distance “outside”. Thus, to continue on the analogy, the spawn come from a more distant forest relative to the Mi-Go\n\nLike the Mi-Go, their matter is very different from us; however, the spawn can easily change shape and size, which is very different than even the Mi-Go. Although the Mi-Go can alter their shape and size, this typically done through surgery or other medical procedures. In contrast, it appears that the spawn (like their Master) can change their shape and size at will although they do have a preferred morphology.\n\nFantastic drawing of a spawn of Cthulhu by KingOvRats\n\nIn addition to their shape changing, the exact motivation of why the spawn and their Master came to Earth is fairly ambiguous compared to the Mi-Go’s need for Earth’s raw resources. Earth already had the Elder Ones ; why come to Earth where competition for space and resources was already high? Additionally, it is not known how or why their city of R’lyeh sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and why they are all dormant and asleep.\n\nThus, while both the Mi-Go and the spawn are very different to us, the spawn seem to be even more “different” with their shape changing abilities and unknown motives. In addition, there are other Lovecraftian entities we will discuss in future that are even more “different” than the spawn. Next time we will wrap up the discussion on the spawn of Cthulhu and move into the New Year with discussions on the Deep Ones. Thank you – Fred\n\nOne of the most impressive components of At the Mountains of Madness was Lovecraft’s current (for the time) knowledge on geology and the history of life on Earth. It is one of the many factors that makes the story so impressive and entertaining; HPL was an expert at incorporating real science, history and archeology into his mythos, making his stories all the more realistic and interesting.\n\nMap of Antarctica (www.wikipedia.com)\n\nNot only did HPL incorporate the most up-to-date scientific information in his stories but he actually modified stories based on new scientific research and data that were made available to the public.\n\nIt was hypothesized by a few in the 19th century that Antarctica was composed of two separate land masses. This idea was held by Sir James Clark Ross, a famous Artic and Antarctic explorer of the 19th century who HPL must have read about. HPL believed this multiple-land mass hypothesis as well and referred to this in the original text of At the Mountains of Madness (The Annotated H.P. Lovecraft, edited by S.T. Joshi; 1997). In the original text HPL made a specific reference to more than one Antarctic land mass; he referred to the two land masses being separate by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas. As shown in the map above, it appears as if there are two land masses; a smaller West Antarctica and a larger East Antarctica.\n\nHowever, after it was confirmed through additional expeditions that Antarctica is one large land mass, HPL actually went out his way to make sure that this fact was corrected in the story. In fact, the updated text states, “-which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the large one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the hypothesis” (S.T. Joshi, 1997). It is interesting that HPL went through his literary agent Julius Schwartz to get Astounding Stories to change that particular passage to coincide with the most up-to-date scientific data on Antarctica. However, as Joshi cited, in spite of correcting the statement, that Antarctica is not made up of two land masses but one, HPL was still in error about who disproved the hypothesis. It was not Richard E. Byrd but instead Lincoln Ellsworth and Herbert Hollick-Kenyon who disproved it by flying completely over the continent from the Weddell to the Ross Sea (Joshi, 1007).\n\nAstounding Stories from 1936\n\nWhile HPL mistakenly credited Byrd for disproving the two-land mass Antarctic hypothesis , the fact that he went out of his way to correct text before his story was published, to agree with the most up-to-date facts, is impressive. It once again demonstrates how HPL appreciated and cared for science as a means of investing and modeling reality. It certainly identifies how adept he was at integrating science and fiction into an incredible story.\n\nNext time the discussion will focus on the Spawn of Cthulhu. Thank you.\n\nFred\n\nTibet, Himalayas by Nikolai Roerich (Roerich’s paintings certainly influenced Lovecraft in developing At the Mountains of Madness)"
