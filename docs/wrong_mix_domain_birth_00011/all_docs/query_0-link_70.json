        "text": "As she glanced at the green trees out of the window of her car driving down rural Highway 59 from McComb, her hometown, to Atlanta, it was like Christmas in July.\n\nTons of text messages and phone calls began rolling into Aunjanue Ellis’ phone.\n\n\"I was in the middle of the country about to have an accident,” Ellis says. “I was so excited that I had to slow down so I would not hit nobody.\"\n\nOn July 16, Ellis found out that she received an Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actress in a limited TV series or TV movie for her role in the popular Netflix series \"When They See Us,\" produced, co-written and directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\n\"The odds are so small of making a living off acting in this country,\" said the 50-year-old. \"To do it again and again and pay your bills is miraculous.\"\n\nThe four-part series follows five Harlem teens who came to be known as the \"Central Park Five.\" They were wrongly convicted for the rape of a jogger in New York City's Central Park.\n\nThe Central Park Five: Think you know the Central Park Five? Ava DuVernay's Netflix drama brings 'nuance' to case\n\nWhile Ellis will wait to hear if her name is called as a winner at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards Sunday in Los Angeles, earning the nomination reflects more than her passion for acting.\n\nIt's about pushing for equality and justice. And it comes from a personal place.\n\nEllis says her grandfather, the Rev. Ned Taylor, had one of his Pike County churches firebombed after he opened its doors to Freedom Riders during the civil rights movement. He was arrested and taken to jail, accused by authorities, Ellis says, of bombing his own church.\n\n\"My grandfather was able to come home safely but his church was lost,\" Ellis says. \"But, there was never any effort from law enforcement to find out who did it.\"\n\nBeing part of shows like \"When They See Us,\" Ellis says, is one avenue of shedding light on the truth. The other is through a film company she started, called Miss Myrtis Jones Films. It's named after her grandmother, and her sister serves as an executive.\n\nMississippi's influence on the actress and businesswoman remains strong. Here's a closer look at Ellis, her home state and her future projects.\n\nWhen are the Emmys?: Everything you need to know before TV's biggest night\n\n(Story continues after photo gallery.)\n\nA farm and strong women\n\nOn her grandmother's farm — a piece of land that dates back nearly a century and was passed down to multiple members of her family — Ellis lived with her sister, mother and grandmother.\n\nSister Sasha Taylor Barnes, 38, says she relished the country living.\n\n\"We played outside with our cousins and explored the woods,\" Barnes says.\n\n\"Our grandmother made sure that when we got off the bus in the afternoon, dinner was already cooked. She would cook things like rabbit and real old-school-type meals. Our dads were not around so it was my grandmother and mother who were there for us.\"\n\nOn April 4, Barnes and Ellis' mother passed away from Parkinson's disease, years after beating breast cancer.\n\n\"She was our parent and she was there for us,\" Ellis says. \"So, we were there every step of the way.\"\n\nWhen They See Us: 'When They See Us' should have included trigger warnings for men like me\n\nSpeech activities and a movie theater job\n\nAs a child, Ellis says, she never thought about being an actress. But she was active in speech activities.\n\n71th Primetime Emmy Awards: Emmys 2019: The nominations list\n\nIn particular, Ellis mentioned Geneva Patterson, a junior high librarian who worked with her on speeches for the Fannie-Gayden Club, and Suzanne Case, her speech teacher at South Pike High School.\n\nAnd, interestingly, Ellis' first job was at Camilla City Cinema, a movie theater at the time in McComb. While babysitting her sister at work, Ellis watched \"Coming to America\" about 10 to 15 times and loved it.\n\nStill, becoming an actress still was not on her radar.\n\n'A creative soul' goes off to college\n\nTougaloo was more than a private, historically black, liberal arts college in Jackson.\n\n\"It was this incredibly special place in the middle of the civil rights movement,\" Ellis says.\n\n\"It was the front lines for so many like Fannie Lou Hamer and Martin Luther King coming to speak there. All of these things were happening and it was so rich.\"\n\nEllis, in the midst of such inspiration, was one of the founders of Wakadzi — an organization focused on equal rights, voting, education, women's issues, politics and empowerment for African Americans.\n\nEllis' political activism has never wavered. She has been particularly active in recent years to get Mississippi to change its state flag, with its Confederate emblem. Those efforts have included putting up a \"We Shall Overcome\" billboard in 2016 near her hometown of McComb and sporting \"Take it Down, Mississippi\" messages on the red carpet.\n\nVanessa Chambliss Thomas, 50, also was a founding member of Wakadzi as well as a sorority sister to Ellis in Delta Sigma Theta Inc. Thomas says Ellis was eccentric and very outspoken.\n\n\"She was always into political issues, especially those that affected the black community at black institutions,\" Thomas says.\n\nWhile at Tougaloo, Ellis met two people — Jim Barnhill and Regina Turner — who would ultimately set the stage for her acting career.\n\nUtilizing a couple of station wagons, Turner took Ellis and several other studentsto New York City to see the play \"Fences\" on Broadway. It was the first play Ellis says she saw outside a church.\n\n\"She wanted us country kids to experience something that would blow our mind and shake us out of our reality,\" Ellis says. \"That trip changed my life forever.\"\n\nBarnhill, a Hattiesburg native, was a professor at Brown University but taught an acting class at Tougaloo every two years. While Ellis never took his class, she made it her business to audition for his play.\n\nUltimately, Ellis participated in an exchange program at Brown and then transferred to finish her bachelor's degree.\n\n\"Being at Brown gave me the environment I needed in order to realize who I wanted to be,\" Ellis says.\n\n\"When I was in the exchange program, I was in class with people who were working actors, people who were getting paid to work in movies. I had a creative soul and I was not going to be able to brush up against that at home.\"\n\nA variety of roles over the years\n\nEllis began in theater and made her film debut in \"Girls Town.\" Since then, she has had numerous supporting and lead roles in TV shows and films, including \"New York Undercover,\" \"Quantico,\" \"In Too Deep,\" \"High Incident,\" \"Men of Honor,\" \"Notorious,\" \"The Taking of Pelham 123,\" \"True Blood,\" \"Skilled Hands: the Ben Carson Story,\" \"The Help,\" \"Romeo and Juliet in Harlem\" and \"The Book of Negroes.\"\n\nWhen They See Us: Michael B. Jordan presents Central Park Five with courage award after 'When They See Us' series\n\nIn \"When They See Us,\" Ellis plays the mother (Sharonne Salaam) of one of the teens (Yusef Salaam) who was wrongly convicted.\n\n\"She (Salaam) still lives in that same building where we shot some of the scenes, the same building where she was waiting on her son to come home and he never came,\" Ellis says.\n\nSharonne Salaam, a native of Alabama, was raised in the height of the civil rights movement. That exposure gave her strength to draw on when her son was arrested, Ellis says.\n\n\"She had to be (strong) because her son was in jeopardy and was essentially kidnapped from her ... she had to activate her prior lessons and use all of her tools to protect and get her son out of jail,\" Ellis says.\n\n\"I am a woman down to my soul but to really tap into Salaam's role, I had to tap into the woman she really was. To hear her doing speeches when they were still in jail and the comparisons of (Angela) Davis and (Assata) Shakur — I tried to tap as much as I could into that reservoir.\"\n\nEllis, who fervently believes the government and institutions are particularly failing African Americans, calls DuVernay a visionary and one of the most important filmmakers of this generation.\n\n\"The series opened people's eyes, it opened up those coffins of lost memories and it made people question why this happened to these five children,\" Ellis says.\n\n\"That's the power of DuVernay's work and getting to tell Salaam's story in the way I did with her directing me was a gift.\"\n\nWhat's next for 'franchise player'?\n\nWhile \"When They See Us\" went on to be one of the most-watched series on Netflix, Ellis remains busy on several upcoming projects.\n\nShe will be starring in a new HBO series called \"Lovecraft Country,\" written and produced by Misha Green.\n\nBased on Matt Ruff's book and also starring Jurnee Smollett, Jonathan Majors, Wunmi Mosaku and Michael Williams, the series explores the connection between the horror fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and racism in the U.S. during the era of Jim Crow laws.\n\n\"It's like social commentary and risky work,\" Ellis says. \"I love doing things that are mysterious and look crazy on paper.\"\n\nThen, Ellis is set to star in the Lifetime Network biopic \"You Brought The Sunshine,\" a series about the famous Clark Sisters who created a legendary presence in the world of gospel music. Ellis will again play a mother role.\n\nChristine Swanson, the director of the series, says working with Ellis brought an explosion of creativity.\n\n\"Aunjanue has an extraordinary gift and, in a basketball metaphor, she is a franchise player,\" Swanson says.\n\n\"You're going to see the manifestation of her prolific performance in the movie.\"\n\nRegardless if she wins the Emmy, her sister said it is time that the world knows how phenomenal Ellis is.\n\n\"I feel like this is validation for her,\" Barnes says.\n\n\"If she wins this award, I am not going to be able to talk for a couple of days.\"\n\n2019 Primetime Emmy Awards: Emmy Awards will go hostless in 2019, echoing Oscars"
