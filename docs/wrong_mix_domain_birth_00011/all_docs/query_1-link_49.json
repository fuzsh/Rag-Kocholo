        "text": "And what an auspicious way to start my posting here. Well, restart, my user ID from years ago is gone, and I know I stopped posting in good standing, and I know cause this user name is my old one. Confusing.\n\nOK, I'm writing a short story and the protagonist who's a grad student in English Lit, particularly 20th century horror. I don't need advice on plot or anything, I need to understand why someone would be drawn to horror. Simply put, I don't, as a rule, like horror at all, and after reading Shadow over Innsmouth, I detest Lovecraft, though I'm working on Dunwich Horror to see if he gets better. I'm writing this story, about the Innsmouth Look, not because of what I liked about Shadow over Innsmouth, but what I hated about it.\n\nAnd this goes onto a broader question, to the appeal not just of the Mythos, but horror in general. Let me explain things from my perspective: I've read two horror novel(le)s: I am Legend, and Shadow over Innsmouth. I loved I am Legend, but it didn't scare me. I felt like I was in the foxhole with Neville, and connected through his isolation and suffering, and he became a human being in my mind and I rooted for him fully in his campaign to remain a civilized man through the vampires, the scrounging and the death of everyone he'd ever cared about. His post-mortem relationship with his friend Benny was dark humor to the max. Shadow over Innsmouth I found poorly constructed, with a lack of style that I wouldn't accept from and 8th grader, the concept of the Look was racist in a way that was out of sorts even for the 30s. But most unforgivable of all is Lovecraft's inability or unwillingness to humanize a single character to the point that the only time there is any connection of any kind was the moment Zadok Allen talked about his decision to come back after the Civil War. And the depraved ending came out of left field...not Olmsted getting the Look, but his near instant embrace of it. Lovecraft ruined the ending, and ending for real sadness and despair because that would mean making someone worthy of our sympathies.\n\nIn film Event Horizon scared the living hell out of me, but I didn't know it was a horror movie until the visions started. And in the TV version of the Stand I only found the first part terrifying. Once civilization was dead, there was nothing left to scare me. The only thing remotely close to a horror movie I actually liked was Evil Dead 2, and there Ash conquers the demons, even if he gets trapped in Candar for his troubles.\n\nI think it's fair to say I don't like the genre, and I really don't like Lovecraft. Turns out all I like is killing critters from the Mythos in Arkham Horror. I don't find most horror frightening, and I don't like being frightened when I do. But I wanna go on with my story and need to have some feel on how the protagonist will defend his chosen genre against someone who does not respect the genre and detests Lovecraft (and he's also a descendant of Barnabas Marsh). Anyway, any thoughts are appreciated.\n\nOh and one more thing: Copyright's expired on Lovecraft himself right? It's like 70 years after death? Yeah, I've got that much faith in the story.\n\nOk guys, I'm getting some of it. However, I found Shadow Over Innsmouth to be a fat load of dung. There were good parts, the middle two fifths, but I think Lovecraft is a hack. The only person who can change that opinion is Lovecraft, and I'm reading a bit more of him to be fair. But this isn't about my contempt for Lovecraft, but trying to understand, and get into the head of people who do. I don't see any redeeming about Lovecraft's prose...I've read better crappy fanfiction. This is beyond my destesation of every single metaphysical underpinning of the Mythos. I feel the same way about Dune, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nTrying to convince me Lovecraft is not banal drek is an excersise in futility, and not what I am here for. Why do you find him compelling? Why do you see him as powerful? What is socially redeeming about his work? The last one is more aimed at horror in general. I don't agree, but I am trying to understand.\n\nHack wasn't the word I wanted then. I'm aware of his integrity, and...whatever. I wont get into a debate on art here. I meant untalented, and grossly overdone Macob 'style' was made worse by such integrity. I was expecting another Poe from the praise.\n\nI don't get it. I thought I'd established that. Whether my distaste was due to a failure of style or deliberate choice it makes no difference to me. Engaging me as a reader is the primary concern of the author, and he failed and did so UTTERLY. I've read erotica I found more intellectually an emotionally engaging. I came away feeling that reading Lovecraft was an utter waste of my time. That's why I'm here: I cannot on my own write a character who loves modern horror, at least not plausibly. I owe it to my character to give him a good argument. That's why I'm here\n\nI'd suggest that if, as an imaginative writer, you cannot create a character who loves modern horror, then you are writing a story beyond your capabilities and should set it aside to tackle something you feel capable of achieving. I, for one, do not love \"modern\" horror, but it would be a simple task to invent a character who did. Such invention need not have any basis in reality, for this is imaginative fiction. Your job as an author is to make your character convincing, not true to life.\n\nWell if you disliked horror in general, than it would hardly make any difference at all no matter what we say to you. But since you asked, to me Lovecraft's literature stands out from many contemporary authors due to his unique writing style. His words elicit such imagery that it really pushes your imagination to its limits and beyond. You say that he doesn't humanizes his characters, but isn't the fear of the unknown one of the characteristics of being human? Lovecraft's characters are fragile, just like how we humans are. When confronted with some nearly fantastical or logic defying ideas we tend to push them off or fear them. The psychological fear that his characters confront is I think that very human trait that humanizes them.\n\nFrom a distance his stories might seem simple, like Mountains: people go to Antarctica, find ancient city and some get killed by slimy monsters while others run away. But if you really take a harder look, its that fragile human nature that makes the story work. So I don't think your point about his characters not being human enough works all that well, but that's my opinion: and I certainly respect yours.\n\nI can't understand how you found Evil Dead to be much scarier but to me that movie or movie series has always been about slapstick horror comedy. I mean the only thing that might scare you are few good \"Boo\" moments and gruesome faces, that's it. Lovecraft's horror is not like that at all. I think the best example of Lovecraft's horror can be seen in Silent Hill games, to some degree.\n\nThe reason I think people like horror is because it explores one of man's most primal emotions: fear. Almost everyone has fear of something, be it of heights or supreme deity, if you're a believer. Lovecraft's horror in this regard explores that very emotion, fear of the unknown, of supreme beings, something that defies our conventional logic or common sense. That is what attracts me towards his work.\n\nSo just ask yourself this question, why does anyone fear anything? What are the traits of your character? Is he a believer or open-minded fellow who believes that there are things that can exist outside of conventional logic? Is he fascinated more by what lies in the dark or human response to that thing in the dark? A person is drawn to something simply out of curiosity and need to satisfy that internal struggle of what to believe in. So what is your character's struggle?\n\nThe reason I think people like horror is because it explores one of man's most primal emotions: fear. Almost everyone has fear of something, be it of heights or supreme deity, if you're a believer. Lovecraft's horror in this regard explores that very emotion, fear of the unknown, of supreme beings, something that defies our conventional logic or common sense. That is what attracts me towards his work.\n\nSame here. Another aspect of his writing that appealed to me greatly is how his characters almost never liked what they discovered or gained from extensive research. It's in our nature to design little bubbles in our lives that keeps us going, and we like to protect these same bubbles from potential \"reality-check\" needles. Lovecraft characters alot of the times are unaware of what lies beneath the surface and so keep digging for more, until it's to late.\n\nI remember a few years back, a friend send me a link to a snuff-videos website, and it left me shocked with how messed up our world really is. I will never get back my former naive persepective of the globe. Sometimes ignorance is absolute bliss, and Lovecraft captures this sentiment in his writing.\n\nWolery, your project is really interesting.\n\nYou'll want to make a distinction between horror fiction in general and the writings of particular authors, even between horror fiction in general and any particular story.\n\nThus, when I think of my lingering fondness for Lovecraft, I have to acknowledge that one important elements in it is affection for the experience of literary discovery that I have from 1970 on (for a few years) when I was spotting his stories in books found in used book stores, or on trips to big cities, or the like. My guess is that, of all the big HPL fans you will encounter here, most will be people who began to read him is adolescence, as I did. An important part of their enjoyment when they reread him is the evocation of those earlier experiences -- or even of their imagination of those experiences, that might not be the same as purely accurate memories.\n\nAlong with the nostalgia element, another element that is, I suspect, important for many, yet distinct from the experience of the stories as such, is the aura of Lovecraftian editions. This can take at least two forms, the fascination of rare books (with the first Arkham House book, The Outsider, as an obvious example), and the attraction of \"collectible\" but not truly rare paperbacks, magazines, etc. You'll find that people here are probably quite attached to their copies of old paperbacks from Lancer, Beagle, and Ballantine -- which were printed, I suppose, in tens or hundreds of thousands of copies. Although folks will discuss the merits of recent annotated editions (Penguin Classics) and so on, they either have and cherish or wish they had copies of editions with perhaps quite cheesy art (e.g. either of the Lancer editions of The Colour Out of Space).\n\nMore in a moment.\n\nAnother important element in how many of his fans feel about Lovecraft, but that must be distinguished from the horror element, is his love of certain places. I believe that love of a particular place can be a very important part of some people's imaginations and when I was a youngster, Lovecraft was one of the main writers who taught me this. Thus Lovecraft has something in common with so radically different an author as the great Wendell Berry, the sage of Kentucky! Incidentally, this is important for Lovecraft's conservatism, which may appeal to conservatives (like myself) who have no taste for the nation's insane military expenditures and so on.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that if your character \"likes horror,\" you need to be clear on whether he likes Lovecraft for the specifically horror-focused element in HPL or if HPL is just one of many authors whom the character likes. If it's horror that he loves, he might feel HPL is overrated. My memory is that, when I first began to read HPL, I actually didn't find the specifically horror-focused material all that important. One may argue for the paradox that Lovecraft is actually a pretty poor horror writer because readers don't usually get very involved with his characters. Who thinks of the characters in At the Mountain of Madness, for example, as realized, humanly interesting individuals?\n\nAnd still another thing about Lovecraft: Lovecraftians read him because he affords such an idiosyncratic type of fun. He has some pretty hopeless literary offenses, which can somehow make him all the more endearing. You have just read \"Shadow Over Innsmouth,\" in which Lovecraft obviously was at great pains to create a sense of locale and depth. He is making a bid to raise the literary quality of the weird tale far above the norm for the magazine of that name. And then he has to spell out the old coot's scream!! What did you make of that? I have almost literally has tears rolling down my face from mirth. Similarly, the old coot in \"The Picture in the House\" is just such an over-the-top guy -- one thinks how this could work as almost a parody of old-time radio horror. And so the reader finds himself thinking about Lovecraft the man, the sense of whom is so important an element in the reading of Lovecraftian fiction and the making of Lovecraftians.\n\nMore...\n\nI read a little over half the posts, but I'll go back and finish reading the rest of them.\n\nSomeone said the word \"erotica\". Now that did grab my attention. It would have been so amazing if Lovecraft went into that area, and was able to include it in some of his fiction. As far as I know he did not. A short story like \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" was amazingly complete and for a general audience, however I did see an opportunity to create a sub story in at least one point in the plot. There is recent talk about a writers round robin. Now that would be a great place to write a short story since you can supplement the existing material. I'm not suggesting adding erotica to that particular story. Lovecraft just did not think that way at all or else old Farnsworth removed all traces.\n\nYou could go onto iTunes and purchase \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" dramatic audio recording that was done by the Atlanta Theatre Company. That may enhance the readability because it creates tension as the pace of the chase encounter in rumor shadowed Innsmouth provides for the ending."
