Episodes

6.21 Let It Bleed

Lovecraft sits at his desk typing on a typewriter, finishing his story "The Haunter of the Dark" when his door creaks open, seemingly by itself. At the same time, there is a crack of thunder and the lights flicker startling Lovecraft who asks if anyone is there. Opening his desk drawer, Lovecraft retrieves a revolver. Gun in hand, he walks slowly towards the door and looks out into the passage. Seeing nothing, he closes and locks the door and pours himself another drink. As he drinks, the window behind him breaks as something enters through it. A figure stands in front of him and advances as he pleads and backs away to no avail as the creature kills him.

Reading through the journal of Moishe Campbell, Bobby Singer finds a connection to H.P. Lovecraft which leads him to visit a Lovecraft enthusiast, Judah. When he asks about the date that Moishe Campbell visited Lovecraft, Judah tells him about the dinner party Lovecraft held on that day attended by six friends whom Judah describes as "co-worshippers in a black magic cult." They'd performed a ritual to open a door to an alternate dimension. They'd thought it hadn't worked, but each of them died or disappeared within a year. Unbeknownst to them, a creature had come through and possessed Lovecraft's maid Eleanor. Only her 9-year-old son Westborough realized this, and he was not believed but committed to a psychiatric institution.

The Real H.P. Lovecraft

H.P. Lovecraft was a writer of horror and fantasy fiction who lived in Rhode Island most of his life and died on March 15, 1937, from cancer of the small intestine. While he didn't attain much acclaim while alive, he is now seen as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, albeit one whose legacy is tainted by the author's racism. He is most widely known for the Cthulhu mythos, a 'verse that includes deities known as "the Great Old Ones" who once ruled Earth, as well as the Necronomicon, a fictional grimoire.
