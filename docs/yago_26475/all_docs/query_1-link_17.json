It was discovered in 1822 by a German jurist, Friedrich Blume, who then and there copied out the poetical pieces; the result of his investigations in this and other Italian libraries was made known in his book Iter Italicum,^ the first volume of which was published in 1824. The manuscript belongs to the later decades of the tenth cen- tury.^ It contains 135 written leaves, and the average size of the written page is gyi by 6 inches, while that of the complete page approximates I2j4 by 8.^ It comprises twenty-three homilies and six interspersed poems, the arrangement of the latter being as follows: Andreas (fol. 29^ — 52**) and Fates of the Apostles (52^ — 54*), after the fifth homily; Address of the Soul to the Body (loi^ — 103^), Falsehood of Men (104* — 104^), Dream of the Rood (104^ — 106*), after the eighteenth; and Elene (121* — 133^), after the twenty-second. The language is Late West Saxon, interspersed with occasional Early West Saxon ^ I. 99. It seems to be mentioned by G. F. Leone in an inventory of the Cathedral Library compiled in 1602 (cf. Forster, // Codice Vercellese, p. 40), and is certainly mentioned in a letter written by Giuseppe Bianchini (printed by Forster, p. 41), who suspected that it was German ('lingua Theotisca'), and reproduced a portion of one of the homilies, with many errors. Cf. Festschrift fur Lorenz Morsbach, pp. 54-5. \"Brandl, in Paul, Grundriss der Germ, Phil., 2d ed., 2. 11 10; Forster, p. 14 {Festschrift, p. 26). Wiilker and others have said the early part of the eleventh century; cf. Forster, p. 12. •Forster, p. 7; Festschrift, p. 21. Vlli INTRODUCTION and many Anglian forms, and a few traces of Kentish. The poems were probably Anglian, and have been changed by passing through West Saxon hands, but it is not necessary to suppose that the West Saxon elements were introduced by the latest scribe. The manuscript perhaps originated at Worcester, and in any case resembles the language as written at Worcester in that period.^ Nothing is known as to the manner in which the manuscript reached Vercelli, but various theories have been proposed. That of Wiilker may thus be translated from his own words* : , As I was informed in Vercelli, there sprang up there in early times a hospice for Anglo-Saxon pilgrims on their journeys to and from Rome. This is intelligible enough if one considers that Vercelli lies directly on the road to Rome by Mont. Cenis or the Little or Great St. Bernard, and that these were the passes over which English pilgrims in the Middle Ages journeyed toward Rome. At this hospice a library of edifying books may gradually have been formed, to which our manuscript may have belonged. This theory has but little to recommend it. The existence of the Anglo-Saxon hospice reposes upon modern hearsay, so far as appears ; the library is purely hypothetical ; and the presence of this volume in the hjqpothetical library is at least equally hypo- thetica l. Is it likely that so large and precious a volimie would have been contributed to the library of a mere hospice? And is it likely that pilgrims on their way to Rome would have had time to pore over any edifying books but their breviaries ? The other theory was first broached by an unnamed writer in the Quarterly Review for December, 1844, and March, 1845 \\ ^^ is to the effect that the book was presented to the church of St. Andrew in Vercelli by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, not long after 1219. This theory I revived, and supported with new considera- tions, in Library Bulletin No. 10 of the University of California (1888). I thus briefly summarized the earlier arguments: ^Forster, pp. 19-21; Festschrift, pp. 33-5. A facsimile of the poetical texts was published by Wiilker in 1894, and of the whole manuscript by Forster in 1913. ' Codex Vercellensis, pp. vi, vii. ELENE IX 1. Cardinal Guala was in England from 1216 to 1218. 2. While in England he had in his possession a priory of St. Andrew.^ 3. After his return to Italy he founded the collegiate church of St. Andrew at Vercelli, and bestowed upon it relics of English saints. 4. The income from his English benefices perhaps enabled him to establish and endow the church at Vercelli. 5. The plan and many of the details of the church are Early English. 6. One of the chief poems of the Vercelli book is St. Andrew. To the foregoing I added : The facts not hitherto adduced in support of the hypothesis, and which seem to be as conclusive as circumstantial evidence can well be, are : Guala was a learned man, zealous for learning and religion, and the owner of perhaps the finest private library possessed at that time in Western Europe. The funds for the establishment of the monas- tery and the purchase of his books must have come largely from England — ^and why not certain books also ? He must have been open- minded, and appreciative of the good he found in foreign parts, and especially anxious to testify his appreciation of English art; then why not of English letters? His spirit of good-will toward England was to some extent reciprocated there, and he sought to perpetuate it by selecting as abbot an ecclesiastic who, though French, should have English connections and sympathies, and a stake in English prosperity. The wisdom of his course is attested by the renown of the monastery school, and the fact that it immediately attracted one of the greatest Englishmen of the Middle Ages, who remained a firm friend after his departure, and perhaps gained other friends for its head. Guala must have thought oftenest of St. Martin and St Andrew, patrons of France and North Britain respectively, especially revered by the two foreign nations in which his lot was cast, and which he afterwards honored on his return to his native country and his native town. Several circumstances must have conspired to deepen the impression thus made, particularly with reference to St Andrew. We need not be surprised, then, at his immediate commemoration of that saint (by founding the monastery of St Andrew in 1219), nor should we be surprised if a book once belonging to him commemorated both St. Martin and St. Andrew. By evincing a special interest in the Vercelli Book, he would have been honoring another saint (St Helena) pecu- *0f Chesterton, near Ely. Cf. Forster, p. 25; Festschrift, p. 39. X INTRODUCnON liarly dear to the English heart Finally, his library did contain one or more books in English chirography, was bequeathed to tiiis monas- tery, and, with whatever augmentations it had receiyed, was a notable one at the beginning of the fifteenth century. In rq)lying to the above arguments, Wiilker admits {Codex Vercellensis, p. vi) the possibility of this mode of transmission, but urges that Guala probably understood no English, let alone Anglo-Saxon, and that if he be supposed to have presented this book to his foundation because it contained a poem on St. Andrew, that implies a good knowledge of Old English on his part. Besides, asks Wiilker, who among his countrymen was to read the manuscript? To this it may be answered: Collectors of rare and precious voltimes are not always familiar with the languages in which they are written, and yet are frequently aware of the notable matters they contain. In the case of a fine book like the Vercelli manuscript, we may either assume that there were Eng- lishmen living who could read it, or that its contents were known in a general way by tradition. If it were venerated by the Eng- lish, that would be a reason why a collector might be anxious to acquire it, whether he could read it or not; but we have seen, besides, that his monastery school at Vercelli attracted into resi- dence a great Englishman (Adam -de Marisco), so that his book may not have lacked readers on Italian soil, though we should grant that Italians found it unreadable. The matter has recently been reopened by Forster,^ who adduces the following facts as bearing upon the problem : 1. Guala's church, or rather monastery, was erected on the site of a former church of St. Andrew. 2. The monastery was erected by, and for the use of, Augus- tinians whom Guala brought from St. Victor, near Paris, and a well-known French archaeologist has declared the architecture to be Gothic of Northern France. 3. The catalogue of the books which Guala left to his mon- astery contains no mention of our manuscript. 4. In 1748, and perhaps in 1602, the manuscript belonged to * Op. cit,, pp. 23 ff . ; Festschrift, pp. 35 ff . ELENE XI the cathedral library, and we are not sure that it was ever in the possession of the monastery. S. No member of the higher clergy at the time of Guala's residence in England would probably have cared for an Old Eng- lish manuscript, or have been able to read it, or even have been able to spell out the characters in which it was written.^ Even the English themselves could hardly understand Old English* perfectly at the end of the I2th century. Hence the 'Andrea (s)' of the manuscript (occurring 32 times, by the way) would not have been likely to attract their attention, especially as it is nowhere conspicuous on the page. Forster then suggests that, as Blume found in 1822 in the cathedral library a Gregorian sacramentary which had been lent by Erkanbald, Abbot of Fulda, to Henry, Bishop of Wiirzburg between 997 and ioti, either Fulda or Wiirzburg, both centres of British learning, might perhaps have been the means of trans- mitting the Vercelli Book to Italy in the nth or 12th century. Other monasteries which might be thought of are Luxeuil and Fleury. The objections raised by Forster under (i) and (2) seem valid. To (3) it mighf be replied, as Forster himself admits, that Guala might already have presented the manuscript to his monastery; to (4) that the books of the monastery may have been turned over, at least in part, to the cathedral library, since no one seems to know what became of them.* With respect to (5), I will quote from Earle^ (pp. cviii-cxix) a few sentences already used in my brief paper, 'Archaic English in the Twelfth Century'* : 'Priority of attention to Latin, with a growing neglect of the mother tongue, was the prevailing tendency in the first half of the twelfth century; but then came a reaction, perhaps only * Forster explicitly says (p. 33) that the period between 1000 and 1175 is the only one in which the writing and the language could have been read, and that, in fact, at any time after 1125, the dominant French theology would have rendered a knowledge of Old English manuscripts the posses* sion of only the occasional amateur. Cf. Festschrift, p. 47. \" So Forster, pp. 28-9 ; Festschrift, pp. 42-3. ^Hand-book to the Land Charters, and other Saxon Documents. * Scottish Historical Review 12. 213-5. Xli INTRODUCTION partial and local, of which our best specimens are in a book from Winchester. . . . Consequently we observe all the tokens of a Renaissance of the mother tongue. . . . The study has mani- festly engendered a real taste for the royal style of the old language, and a sincere passion to master the charm of it.' Earle then speaks of 'the genuine early forms that here and there peep *out through the scholastic text' [of the charters that he cites], and adds : *This brings us to the end of the twelfth or the begin- ning of the thirteenth century.' Again he speaks (p. 348) of the 'scholastic attention to the ancient forms of the language,' and of 'an Anglosaxon Renaissance at the close of the twelfth cen- tury,' and remarks of one of the charters in question^ that it is *a work of the thirteenth century.'^ Evidently, then, there were ecclesiastics, higher or lower, who could read Old English at this time, and who would strive to communicate their enthusiasm to others.* As to the transmission of English manuscripts to Vercelli by way of French or German monasteries, is it not more likely that any such should have come direct from England by the passes that Wiilker designates? As late as the fourteenth century, at least, parties descending the Alps by the Mont Cenis passed through Vercelli on their way to larger and more important towns.* ^ Cott Claud.

Brit., nth ed., 16. 311). Of his language Sir James Murray has said (ibid. 9. 591) : The language, though forty years later than the specimen from the Chronicle [1140], is much more archaic in structure, and can scarely be considered even as Early Middle English.'

ELENE Xlll We are evidently reduced to h3rpotheses ; and, of all that have been proposed, that concerning Guaja still seems to me the most plausible. [jJLt^^txJU^^^ '^ ^ ^-nuyTl^ « AUTHOR AND DATE On the evidence of the interpersed runes near the end of the poem, the Elene, like the Juliana, the Christ, and the Fates of the Apostles, was written by Cynewulf . The Juliana and the Elene spell the name Cynewulf, while the Christ, and probably the Fates of the Apostles, have Cynwulf. Cyne- in such words is the earlier spelling, and obtains from about 750 a. d. ; Cyn- belongs almost wholly to the ninth century, but does not altogether crowd out the earlier Cyne-, which in turn had succeeded a still earlier Cyni-, again without completely displacing it.^ The prevailing view among scholars is that Cynewulf was a Northumbrian, or at least an Anglian, ecclesiastic, who wrote in the second half of the eighth century,^ or possibly as late as the very beginning of the ninth.® Greater precision than this does not at present seem hpf ^Christ, ed. Coolfc^/pj Ixviii; Tupper, in Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. 26 (1911). 240-244. ' ^^ *See Carleton F. Brown, in Eng. Stud. 3/ (1907). 225; Brandl, Gesch. der Altengl. Lit. (1908), p. 100; cf. Christ, ed. Cook, p. Ixxi. * So Henry Bradley, in Encyc. Brit., nth ed., 7. 691. Certain reasons which I advanced in 1892 (Angl. 15. 9-20; cf. Christ, pp. IxLx-lxx) in favor of this view were proved untenable by Carleton F. Brown (following Trautmann in Anglia Beiblatt 11. 325) in 1903 (Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. 18. 308-334). The date could be established more exactly if the poet could be identified with the Bishop of Lindisfarne who died in 783, as conjec- tured by Bouterwek (1857), and accepted by Dietrich (1865), Grein (1880), Trautmann (1898), and Brown (1907) ; cf. Christ, ed. Cook, pp. Ixx-lxxiii; Brown, in Eng. Stud. 38. 225-233. The latter says (p. 226) : 'Bishop Cynewulf was appointed to the see of Lindisfarne in 740. After forty years' service, he resigned his office in 780, and died in 783. The date of his birth may by reasonable inference be fixed between 705 and 710.* After traversing my objections, he concludes (pp. 232-3) : 'The poet was certainly an ecclesiastic ; he was in all probability a Northumbrian ; his poems were written during the second half of the eighth century. AH these conditions are satisfied by Bishop Csmewulf. Outside of York, there is no place in Northumbria more likely to have been the poefs home than Lindisfarne— from the time of Aidan a distinguished seat of Christian learning. In the library of this ancient monastery Cynewulf would certainly have found Xiv INTRODUCTION possible. A terminus a quo for the composition of the Elene may be assumed, if my conjecture regarding* 1206** — 12* is accepted. According to this, he would have written after 731. SOURCES OF THE LEGEND The Elene is based upon a Latin version of a legend which, in its fully developed form, seems to be Syriac in orig^n,^ and which probably, though not certainly, entered Latin through the medium of Greek. This elaborated legend must have arisen about the beginning of the fifth century, though its larger outlines may have established themselves about 375 a. d.^ It became pretty well diffused over Latin Christendom from about the middle of the fifth century.* Cynewulf's direct source, as Carleton F. the writings of the Fathers, which he used so extensively, and the \"books\" to which he refers in the epilogue of Elene. Everything, in a word, which we know of Lindisfarne and of the bishop accords well with what we infer concerning Cjmewulf from a study of the poems to which he has signed his name. Further than this, present evidence will not carry us/ ^ Probably at Edessa, the seat of Syrian learning and literature in that period. Cf. Tixeront, Les Origines de VJ^glise d*£desse, pp. 7-8: *£desse a ete la premiere fondee de ces chretientes [de Mesopotamie] ; c'est de son sein que sont partis les missionnaires qui les ont evangelisees ; elle est restee le centre des eglises de langue syriaque.

Elle etait comme le confluent ou les idees de deux mondes venaient se meler et se confondre/ See also Holthausen's second edition of the Elene, p. xi.

ELENE XV » Brown has shown, may well have been derived from Ireland, and he even inclines to suppose that *the legend made its way to Ireland in a Greek text, and was there translated into Latin.'^ If one undertakes to trace the growth of the legend, he finds it extremely difficult to determine where authentic history ends, and embellishment and invention begin. In what follows, the principal documents are quoted or summarized in order, begin- ning in the later years of Constantine's reign, and continuing down to about 500 a. d.^ Our earliest authority is Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260— ca. 340), the most learned man of his age, highly esteemed by Con- stantine, and favored with access to many original sources of information which are now lost.

Imme- diately after the transactions which I have recorded, the emperor sent forth instructions, . . . commanding that a house of prayer worthy of tiie worship of God should be erected near the Saviour's tomb, on a scale of rich and royal greatness. . . . He also dispatched the follow- ing letter to the bishop who at that time presided over the church at Jerusalem : Victor Constantinus Maximus Augustus, to Macasius : . . . That the monument of his most holy passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration. . . . With regard to the erection and decoration of the walls, this is to inform you that our friend Dracilianus,* the deputy of the praetorian prefects, and the governor of the province, have received in charge from us. Independent contemporary testimony to the discovery of the tomb and the erection of the church is furnished by the fol- lowing : (332 A. D.) Itinerary from Bordeaux to Jerusalem (Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society), pp. 23-4. About a stone's throw from thence [Golgotha] is a vault wherein his body was laid, and rose again on the third day. There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say a church, of wondrous beauty. Thus far, there has been no mention of the discovery of the cross, but only of the tomb. The first author to speak of the former is Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386) : (347 A. D.)

D. 326 (Ryssel, p. 3). *The existence of this Dracilianus as deputy of the pratorian prefects is otherwise attested by instructions sent to him by Constantine in the years 325 and 326 (Lipsius, p. 72). ELENE XVll He was indeed crucified for our sins ; shouldst thou be disposed to deny it, the very place which all can see refutes thee, even this blessed Golgotha, in which, on account of him who was crucified on it, we are now assembled; and further, the whole world is filled with the frag- ments of the wood of the cross. Ibid, lo. 19 (ibid. 685, 688). The holy wood of the cross is his witness, which is seen among us to this day, and, through the agency of those who have in faith received it, has already from this place almost filled the whole world. Ibid. 13. 4 (ibid. 776-7). For though I should now deny it, thjs Golgotha confutes me, near which we are now assembled; the wood of the cross confutes mcs, which has from hence been distributed piecemeal to all the world.* • One of the most important testimonies is contained in an inscrip- tion from the Roman province of Africa: (359 A. D.) Inscription at Tixter Three or four miles south of the railway station of Tixter, which is about sixteen miles from Setif, on the railway leading to Algiers, there was found in October or November, 1889. an inscribed stone some 51 inches square, which, according to the date near the end, was erected in the year 320 of the province of Mauretania, that is, 359 of our era.* This stone originally marked the place of a basilica which, according to the inscription, possessed a portion of the wood * Still more specific is an Epistle to Constantius of May 7, 351, attributed to Cyril, but of somewhat doubtful authenticity (cf. Lipsius, pp. 73-4 J Ryssel, p. 3, note i; Migne, Patr. Gr. 33. 11 53 ff.). The passage runs (Pair. Gr. 33. 1168) : Tn the days of thy father Constantine, dear to God and of blessed memory, the saving wood of the cross was found in Jeru- salem, divine grace granting the discovery of the hidden sacred places to him who sought piety aright.'

The report in the Melanges, by M. Audollent, contains an excellent study of the inscription, and on p. 441 a photographic reproduction. The text of the inscription follows {ligno is actually lignu) : ^^ Memoria sa(n)cta. — Victorinus Miggin, septimu(m) idus sept- (e)fn(b)r(es), bdv et dabulail, de lign(o) crucis, de ter(ra) promis- XTIU INTSODUCnON of tiie cross, as well as some of the soil of the Holy Land.

A chair is placed for the bishop in (jolgotha, behind the cross which stands there now; the bishop sits down in the chair; there is placed before him a table covered with a linen cloth, the deacons standing round the table. Then is brought a silver-gilt casket, in which is the holy wood of the cross; it is opened, and, the contents being taken out, the wood of the cross and also its inscription are placed on the table. When they have been put there, the bishop, as he sits, takes hold of the extremities of the holy wood with his hands, and the deacons, standing round, guard it. It is thus guarded because the custom is that every one of the people, faithful and catechumens alike, leaning forward, bend over the table, kiss the holy wood, and pass on. And as it is said that one time a person fixed his teeth in it, and so stole a piece of the holy wood, it is now guarded by the deacons standing round, so that no one who comes may dare to do such a thing again. And so all the people pass on one by one, bowing their bodies down, first with their forehead, then with their eyes, touching the cross and the inscription, and so kissing the cross they pass by, but no one puts forth his hand to touch it. Ibid., p. 76. The dedication-festival of these holy churches [at Golgotha and the site of the Resurrection] is observed with the greatest honor, since the cross of the Lord was found on that day [Sept. 13].

Chrysostom, That Christ is God (Migne, Patr. Gr. 48. 826). How is this very wood, on which the holy body was stretched and impaled, struggled for by all? For many, both men and women, taking a small portion of it, and setting it in gold, suspend it from their necks as an ornament. Helena is first introduced by Eusebius, in connection with the churches of the Nativity and the Ascension : (about 335 A. D.) Eusebius, Life of Constantine, Book 3, chaps. 41-43 (Migne, Patr. Gr. 20. iioi, 1104). In the same country he discovered two other places, venerable as being the localities of two sacred caves, and these also he adorned with lavish magnificence. . . . And while he thus nobly testified his reverence for those places, he at the same time eternized the memory of his mother, who had been the instrument of conferring so valuable a benefit on mankind. For this empress, having resolved to discharge .the duties of pious devotion to the supreme God, . . . had hastened to survey this venerable land. ... As soon, then, as she had ren- dered due reverence to the ground which the Saviour's feet had trodden, . . . she immediately bequeathed the fruit of her piety to future generations, for without delay she dedicated two churches* to the God whom she adored. . . . Thus did Helena Augusta, the pious mother of a pious emperor, erect these two noble and beautiful monu- ments of devotion, . . . and thus did she receive from her son the countenance and aid of his imperial power. * The church of the Nativity is thus referred to in the Pilgrimage of St. Sylvia, about 385 a. d. (Palestine Pilgrims* Text Society), p. 50: 'And what shall I say of the decoration of that structure which Con- stantine, with the assistance of his mother, adorned, as far as the resources of his kingdom would go, with gold, mosaic, and precious marbles ?' XX INTRODUCTION > (395 A. D.) Ambrose, Oration on the Death of Theodosius, chaps. 43, 45-48 (Migne, Patr. Lat. 16. 1400-2). Helena, wishing to revisit the holy places, went thither. Now the Spirit put it into her head to demand the wood of the cross. So, approaching Golgotha, . . . she opens the ground, and removes the dust; there she finds three indistinguishable crosses, which ruin had covered, and the enemy had concealed, though unable to obliterate the triumph of Christ. She remains undecided, . . . but the Holy Spirit suggests a clue in the fact that two thieves were crucified with the Lord. She therefore casts about to find the middle cross. Yet it might have happened that the crosses had become shifted in the ruins. Returning to the text of the Gospel, she finds that the inscrip- tion on the middle cross ran: 'Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.* From this the truth was determined: the cross of salvation was made known by its title. . . . She therefore found the inscription, and adored the King, not the wood — for this is the error of the heathen, and the vanity of the wicked; him she adored who hung upon the wood. . . . Then she sought the nails with which the Lord was crucified, and found them. Of one she commanded a bridle to be made, of another a crown to be fashioned. . . . She sent to her son Constantine the crown adorned with gems, . . . and also the bridle. Constantine made use of both, and transmitted the faith to the kings who followed. (about 400 A. D.) Rufinus, EccL Hist. 10. 7, 8 (Migne, Pa^r. Lat. 21. 475 if.). [This in the main is like the account by Ambrose, up to the identi- fication of the Saviour's cross. The inscription was fotmd, but could not be assigned to any one of the crosses in particular.] Now it happened that there lay grievously i'^ .n that city a woman of rank. At that time Macarius was bishop of that church. When he saw that the queen and those with her lingered, he said: 'Bring hither all the crosses which have been found, and God will show us which one bore the Lord.' Then, proceeding with the queen and the people to the house of her who was lying ill, he kneeled down and prayed thus: 'O Lord, thou who hast vouchsafed to bestow salvation on mankind by the passion of thy only begotten Son on the cross, and in these latter times hast inspired in the heart of thy handmaid to seek the blessed wood on which our salvation hung, show plainly which of these three was for the glory of the Lord, and which for slavish punishment, by causing this woman, who lies half dead, to return to life from the gates of death, so soon as she shall touch the saving ELENE XXI wood/ When he had said this, he brought one of the three, but it had no effect. He brought the second, but nothing occurred. But when he had brought the third, the woman suddenly opened her eyes and sat up; having recovered her strength, she began to go about the house much more blithely than before she had been taken ill, and to magnify the power of the Lord. . . . Part of the saving wood Helena sent to her son, and part she deposited in a silver case and left on the spot, where it is still preserved as a memorial. (about 403 A. D.) Paulinus of Nola, Epistle to Severus 31 (11). 73 flF. (Migne, Pair. Lat, 61. 326 fF.). [Paulinus relates that Hadrian, thinking to injure the Christian religion, had erected a temple of Jupiter on the site of the passion. At the request of Helena, Constantine gives her authority to destroy all temples and idols which had profaned the holy places, and to erect churches in their stead. Arrived at Jerusalem, she knows not how to find the cross. Eventually she seeks out and consults, not only Christian men full of learning and sanctity, but also the cleverest of the Jews. She commands to dig at the spot designated. Citizens and soldiers join in the work. The crosses are found. God inspires her to make trial with the corpse of one newly dead. This is done, but the two crosses produce no effect. The Lord's cross raises the dead. A church is erected, which preserves the cross in a secret shrine.] (about 450 A. D.) Sozomen, EccL Hist, 2. i. [Sozomen reproduces, in general, earlier accounts, but, after men- tioning the temple of Venus, adds a significant statement:] At length, however, the secret was discovered, and the fraud detected.

XXn INTRODUCTION Likewise the writing concerning the invention of our Lord's cross, and the other writing concerning the invention of the head of the blessed John the Baptist, are new stories {novella quidem relationes sunt). Some Catholics read them; but when they come into the hands of Catholics, let it be with the prefatory text from St. Paul [i Thess. 5. 2i] : Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. According to another form of the legend, the cross was found in the reign of Tiberius (14-37 a. d.), while St. James the Greater was Bishop of Jerusalem, by Protonike, wife of the Emperor Claudius (41-54 a. d.). This form has by some scholars been regarded as earlier than the story of Helena, but is now con- sidered by the most competent authorities to be merely an adap- tation of the latter.^ CONSTANTINE AND THE VISION OF THE CROSS Eusebius, Life of Constantine i. 28-31 (Migne, Pair, Gr. 20. 944-5, 948). Accordingly, . he called on him with earnest prayer and supplica- tions that he would reveal to him who he was, and stretch forth his right hand to help him in his present difficulties. And while he was thus praying with fervent entreaty, a most marvelous sign appeared to him from heaven, the account of which it might have been difficult to receive with credit, had it been related by any other person. But since the victorious emperor himself long afterwvds declared it to the writer of this history, when he was honored with his acquaintance and society, and confirmed his statement by an oath, who could hesitate to accredit the relation, especially since the testi- mony of after-times has established its truth? He said that about midday, when the sun was beginning to decline, he saw with his own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, and bearing the inscription, 'Conquer by this^ At this sight, he himself was struck with amazement, and his whole army also, which hap- pened to be following him on some expedition, and witnessed the miracle. He said, moreover, that he doubted within himself what the import of this apparition could be. And while he continued to ponder and reason on its meaning, night imperceptibly drew on; and in his sleep * See Nestle, De Sancta Cruce, pp. i ff ., 65 ff . ; Lipsius, pp. 88-92 ; Tix- eront, pp. 184-191 ; Ryssel, pp. 1-3. The nth edition of the Encyclo- pcedia Britannic a (7. 506) is wrong, then, in calling the legend of Protonike the older. £LENE XZlll the Christ of God appeared to him with the same sign which he had seen in the heavens, and commanded him to procure a standard made in the likeness of that sign, and to use it as a safeguard in all engagements with his enemies. At dawn of day he arose, and communicated the secret to his friends; and then, calling together the workers in gold and precious stones, he sat in the midst of them, and described to them the figure of the sign he had seen, bidding them represent it in gold and precious stones. And this representa- tion I myself have had an opportunity of seeing. Now it was made in the following manner. A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the figure of the cross by means of a piece trans- versely laid over it. On the top of the whole was fixed a crown, formed by the intertexture of gold and precious stones; and on this, two letters indicating the name of Christ symbolized the Saviour's title by means of its first characters — the letter P being intersected by X exactly in its centre; and these letters the emperor was in the habit of wearing on his helmet at a later period. From the trans- verse piece which crossed the spear was suspended a kind of streamer of purple cloth, covered with a profuse embroidery of most brilliant precious stones; and which, being also richly interlaced with gold, presented an indescribable degree of beauty to the beholder. This banner was of a square form ; and the upright staff, which, in its full extent, was of great length, bore a golden half-length portrait of the pious emperor and his children on its upper part, beneath the trophy of the cross, and immediately above the embroidered streamer. The emperor constantly made use of this salutary sign as a safeguard against every adverse and hostile power, and commanded that others similar to it should be carried at the head of all his armies. Lactantius, Of the Manner in which the Persecutors died, chap. 44 (Migne, Pair, Lat. 7. 260-2). And now a civil war broke out between Constantine and Maxen- tius. . . . They fought, and the troops of Maxentius prevailed. At length Constantine, with steady courage and a mind prepared for every event, led his whole forces to the neighborhood of Rome, and encamped them opposite to the Milvian bridge. . . . Constantine was directed in a dream to cause the heavenly sign to be delineated on the shields of his soldiers, and so to proceed to battle. He did as he had been commanded, and he marked on their shields the letter X, with a perpendicular line drawn through it and turned round at the top, thus, ^, being the cipher of Christ. Having this sign, his troops stood to arms. The enemy advanced, but without their emperor, and they crossed the bridge. The armies met, and fought XXIV INTRODUCTION with the utmost exertions of valor, and firmly maintained their ground. . . . [At length Maxentius went to the field.] The bridge in his rear was broken down. At sight of that the battle grew hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed, and the forces of Maxentius were routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude pressing on him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber. The destructive war being ended, Constantine was acknowledged as emperor, with great rejoicings, by the senate and people of Rome. PHOENIX MANUSCRIPT The Phoenix is contained on leaves 55^-65^ of the Codex Exoniensis, or Exeter Book, which has been in possession of Exeter Cathedral since about the middle of the eleventh century, having been presented to it, among other valuable gifts, by Leofric, Bishop of Devon and Cornwall from about 1046, who was enthroned at Exeter in 1050, and died in 1072. The manuscript is 14 centimetres in height by i8j4 in breadth — ^approximately SJ4 by 7J4 inches. It is written on vellum, apparently by a single hand of the early eleventh cen- tury. Thorpe calls the writing 'fair and rather fine,' and Conybeare speaks of 'the clearness and beauty of its characters.' At present the volume proper consists of 123 leaves, or 246 pages, from 8* to 130**. Only one leaf is wanting in the interior of the volume, that between fol. 37 and fol. 38. On the other hand, several leaves are missing at the beginning and end. Only the commonest abbreviations are found. The whole manuscript must have been corrected by another hand after writing, the corrections being in a paler ink- Among the other poems of the Exeter Book are the Christ, Guthlac, Azarids, Juliana, Wanderer, Seafarer, Harrowing of Hell, and Ruin. With the exception of a few fragments at the end of the manuscript, then thought undecipherable, the poems were all published by Thorpe in 1842, under the title Codex Exoniensis. Opposite p. 293 of that volume is a facsimile of part of page jy^ of the manuscript, the beginning of the Gifts of Men, The first volume of a republication of the Exeter Book, containing the Christ, Guthlac, Azarias, Phoenix, Julia/na, Wan- derer, Gifts of Men, and A Father's Instruction, was issued by GoUancz (E. E. T. S. 104) in 1895. A careful collation by Schipper was published in 1874 (Germania 19. 327-338), and another was made by Assmann for the Grein-Wiilker Bibliothek der Angelsachsischen Poesie. XXVI INTRODUCTION For further particulars concerning the manuscript and its donor, see my edition-of The Christ of Cynewulf, pp. xiii-xvi. AUTHOR AND DATE Beginning with Kemble, in 1840, many scholars, including such as Klipstein (1849), Dietrich (1859), Sweet (1871), Ten Brink (1877), Gaebler (1880), Grein (1880), Sarrazin (1886), Brooke (1892), have believed that Cynewulf was, or may have been, the author of the Phoenix. Holtbuer (1884) was the first to reject this view, and such scholars as Sievers (1885), Ebert (1887), Biilbring (1891), Wulker (1896), Trautmann (1907), Brandl (1908), and Strunk (1904) have come to a similar negative conclusion. As the Phoenix contains no runic passage embodying the name of the author, the ascription of it to Cynewulf. rests upon identities or similarities of diction, subject, or general treatment with the undoubted works of Cynewulf, or with such as are ascribed to him by practically universal consent. Dietrich^ adduces, besides certain correspondences with the Elene (and with Gut Mac and Andreas, which he ascribes to Cynewulf), such as these between the Phoenix and the Christ Ph. 420: Chr, 142, 250-253, 367, 587; Ph, 50-70, 589, 611-617 Chr. 1634-1664; Ph. 56, 613: Chr. 1660-1661 ; Ph. 329, 493 Chr. 1228; Ph. 516: Chr. 1079; Ph. 525: Chr. 811; Ph. 584 Chr. 820 ; Ph. 604 : Chr. 505 ; Ph. 628 : Chr. 726. Dr. Arthur W. Coltbn, in an unpublished investigation, dis- covered (about 1892) that the verbal and phrasal correspond- ence between the Christ and the Phoenix was even greater than between the Christ and either the Elene or the Juliana, undoubted poems of Cynewulf. Words and phrases were listed separately, and these were divided into four main categories, according as the expression occurred in one, two, three, or four poems besides the Christ, the plan being that formulated in my first edition of the Judith. The ratio of correspondence between the Christ and the Elene was .085, this ratio being the result of dividing the * Commentatio, pp. 9, 10. PHCENIX XXVU total number of correspondences by the number of lines in the poem. In the case of the Juliana it was .084; in that of the Phoenix, .09. This result would accordingly create a presump- tion that the Phoenix was the work of Cynewulf . The chief arguments against such a presumption lie (as Strunk has said^) in *the absence of the runic signature, and the metrical necessity of admitting quantities and inflectional forms (as glcedum, gladum, Ph. 92, 303; fotas, Ph. 311) not found in the acknowledged poems. Further, it must be admitted that the resemblances of word, phrase, and idea extend in varying degree through practically the whole body of Old English religious poetry.' BrandP (1908) would place the author of the Phoenix among the contemporaries or immediate successors of Cynewulf: in style and syntax they resemble each other; both acknowledge indebtedness to books (Ph. 424; cf. my edition of The Christ of Cynewulf, p. Ixxxiii) ; and both make use of rhyme; on the other hand, the author of the Phoenix employs sharp antitheses, and ends his poem with macaronic verses. I can not better express my own opinion than by quoting a paragraph already in print*: 'The theme of the Phoenix would have been congenial to Cynewulf, and his reading may well have included Lactantius.*^ The verbal parallels and similarities of thought are striking, and the percentage of correspondences in Dr. Colton's table agrees remarkably with that of the Juliana and the Elene. In respect to the prominence of color, flowers, fragrance, and music, of brooks, trees, groves, and plains, the Phoenix excels the undoubted poems; but against this must be set C)mewuirs impressibility — ^the fact that his vocabulary and imagery change to some extent with his mood and with the ^Juliana, p. xxii. * Gesch. der Alteng, Lit., p. 106. * Schlotterose, in his edition of the Phoenix (p. 92), holds a somewhat similar opinion: the Phoenix is later than Cynewulf, but was strongly influenced by him. Barnouw (1902) is in doubt, but is sure that, if Cjme- wulf wrote it, the Phoenix was his latest work. * The Christ of Cynewulf, pp. Ixiv-lxv. \"Lactantius was among the authors included in the York Library, according to Alcuin. XXVUl INTRODUCTION original upon which he is working. From no three of his undoubted poems could one, on stylistic grounds, and in the absence of the runic testimony, have ascertained his fourth. When he^is paraphrasing long, didactic speeches he is another man than when he is telling a stirring tale, or reproducing the spirit of a poem full of sublime sentiment and magnificent appeals to the imagination. There is therefore no a priori ground for assuming that the Phcmix cannot be by Cynewulf . Much of the sentiment is demonstrably his ; the correspondences in phraseology indicate the hand of a master, so inwoven are they .into the tissue of the style; and a doxology like that of lines 615-629 would of itself almost persuade the critic to believe in Cynewulf's author- ship, so similaor is it in tone and setting to those of the Elene^ and the Christ,^ It cannot be said that the question is decided ; but I believe that scholars will end by assigning the Phoenix, like the Andreas, to Cyuewulf.'^ On the supposition that the Phomix is by Cynewulf, reference may be made to the Introduction to the Elene (pp. xiii-xiv), where his date and personality are discussed. If it is not by Cynewulf, we can hardly say more than that the writer must have been a monk or ecclesiastic, apparently under the influence of the Cynewulfian poetry, and likely to have lived either within the period of Cynewulf 's poetic activity (about 750-800),* or soon after. LACTANTIUS ( It has long been recognized that the Phcenix was largely derived from the De Ave Phoenice^ attributed to Lactantius. We shall therefore first give a brief account of Lactantius, and then review the evidence in favor of his authorship of the De Ave Phoenice.

At this time both Lactantius and his master were heathen. Here he must have applied himself with much diligence to the study of Latin literature. He modeled his style so closely on Cicero that he far surpassed Arnobius as a writer, and already Jerome characterized him as 'a river of Ciceronian eloquence.'* In consequence of this devotion, his diction shows comparatively few traces of Africanisms, such as were not infrequent in the writings of others who lived in that province of the Roman Empire. His philosophical training must have been largely in the doctrines of the Stoics, and to the end he seems more deeply imbued with their philosophy than with the teachings of Scripture. About four or five years after Diocletian's accession to the throne, or in the neighborhood of a. d. 288, he was called by that * This sketch reposes chiefly upon Brandt, Ueher das Leben des Lactan- tius (Sitsungsber. der Wiener Akad,, Vol. 120), who has criticized in several points the statements of Jerome, our chief ancient authority for the biography of Lactantius, and is in turn criticized by Seeck, Gesch, des Untergangs der Antiken Welt i. 456-460. The longest statement of Jerome's is the following {On Illustrious Men, chap. 80) : 'Firmianus, also known as Lactantius, a pupil of Arnobius, received a call in the reign of the emperor Diocletian, along with the grammarian Flavius, whose book in verse. On Things Medical, is still extant. He taught rhetoric at Nicomedia, but on account of the lack of pupils — for the city was a Greek one — betook himself to authorship. We have from him the Ban- quet, which he wrote as a young man in Africa ; an Itinerary (Hodapori- con) from Africa to Nicomedia, written in hexameters; another book entitled The Philologist (Grammaticus) ; the fine treatise, On the Anger of God; seven books of Divine Institutions, directed against the heathen ; an Epitome of the last-named work; one book dKi<f>a\\ov; two books To Asclepiades; one book On Persecution; four books of letters To Probus; two books of letters To Severus; two books of letters To Demetrianus, an attendant on his lectures ; one book to the same On the Work of God in the Formation of Man. In extreme old age he was the tutor in Gaul of Crispus Caesar, the son of Cons tan tine, who was afterward put to death by his father.' ' Now Kef, east of Constantine. • Epist. 58. ID. XXX INTRODUCTION emperor to the chair of rhetoric, or oratory, in his new capital of Nicomedia, which he was then adorning with public buildings, little imagining that it was so soon to be superseded by Constan- tinople as the seat of the Eastern Empire. This call indicates what celebrity Lactantius had already achieved. Arrived in Nicomedia, he must have devoted himself to his professional work for fifteen or eighteen years, without endeavor- ing to engage in the practice of forensic oratory. In his Chris- tian zeal, he afterwards came to disprize the teaching of oratory, almost in the spirit of Plato.^ It was probably while in Nicomedia that Lactantius became a Christian, though he would undoubtedly have had opportunities of coming in contact with Christians while still in Africa. There were several communities of Jews in North Africa,^ and in these the first conversions to Christianity would be almost certain to occur. His profession of Christianity may well have been the cause of his degradation from the professorial rank, since Diocletian's edict of Feb. 24, 303 expressly commanded that Christians should be deprived of their honors and dignities.* That he had reason to shrink from too great publicity with regard to his Christian belief is shown by his tractate, On the Work of God, written about this time. In the first place, the doctrines which he here professes are virtually Stoic — those of monotheism and Provi- dence. In the second place, he is extremely guarded in his allusions to the faith professed in common by himself and his correspondent, while at the same time he shows that he had given up other pursuits, and was devoting himself to authorship.* Lactantius must have remained in Bithynia for two years after the persecuting decree of Diocletian.'* The fifth book of his Divine Institutes shows, by its allusions, that he was not at that time in Nicomedia. Now scholars are practically agreed that the Institutes were completed not later than 310, or 311 at latest. ^Inst. I. I. 8. ^ * See Hastings, Diet.

FHCENIX XXXI Hence it becomes natural to think of 308, or thereabouts, as the year when he accepted Constantine's invitation to Gaul as the tutor of his son Crispus.^ If we may attach full weight to Jerome's words, extrema senectute, he may have died about 340, and possibly in Trier, but this date, like that of his birth, is merely inferential, and at best approximate. We have no certain knowledge that Lactantius ever visited Egypt, but since he presents in his poem on the Phoenix an epitome of extant knowledge on the subject, in this respect, and in his reflections on the theme, much surpassing his predecessors, it would not be surprising if his deep interest in it had been either occasioned or strengthened by a sojourn in that cotmtry. Certain of the ancient authorities on the Phoenix were themselves Egyptians (such as Nonnus and HorapoUo), or had resided in Egypt (Hecataeus, Herodotus' informant, and Claudian,^ for example). The worship of Isis flourished at Rome during this period, and for that reason, and because the Egyptians had tenaciously maintained their ancient religion in the face of innova- tion, their institutions may well have attracted the curiosity of a young and highly educated traveler, already a celebrity. Then, too, Lactantius manifests some knowledge of \"Egyptisn history in his Undoubted works — especially the Divine Instittttes^ — though this, it is true, might have been derived from books. If he did visit Egypt, it might have been in the train of Diocle- tian, on the occasion of the latter's military expedition thither in 295 or 296. Since we must infer that Constantine the Great spent some time in Egjrpt,* either with Diocletian,** or later in * Authorities are not at one concerning this date, however. Cf.

XXXll INTRODUCTION 302,^ it might have been in his company. This supposition is strengthened by the consideration that Constantine stood in pecu- liar relations to two scholars — ^Eusebius, who wrote his biography, and Lactantius. Eusebius was in Eg)rpt, according to his own testimony (EccL Hist. 8. 9), and Lactantius, whose doctrines furnished the basis for Constantine's oration mentioned above, may likewise have been there.^ A man of warm friendships,' the best Latin prose writer of his time, and with the instinct of a bom teacher, Lactantius was a mediator between ancient culture and the new faith, recommend- ing the latter by his suavity and moderation, and the charms of his style, to educated and courtly circles who otherwise would have remained contentedly ignorant of it, or have cherished toward it an invincible aversion. He dwelt upon what was com- mon to Christianity with the austerest moral creed of antiquity, and thus conciliated the most virtuous element in the society of his time. Born in Africa, passing his middle life in Asia, and dying (as is probable) in Europe, he served in this sense, too, as a medi- ator between the Orient and the Occident, between the old and [ the new. Called to teach ancient literature by a heathen emperor and persecutor, he so far gained the favor of the first Christian emperor as to be entrusted by him with the education of the heir to his throne. Graced with a learning which enabled him to associate on terms of intimacy with the great, he seems to have known the pangs of poverty and disgrace, yet to have preserved his equanimity, and illustrated his enforced leisure. If we do not feel justified in calling him a time-server, we can but admire the dexterity with which, without sacrificing any conviction which * Seeck, op. cit. i. 479-480. * It is worthy of note that Eusebius ( Vita Const. 4. 72) is the only ancient author who calls the Phoenix Egyptian. Constantine paid pecu- liar attention to the symbol of the Phoenix, no doubt because he was espe- cially addicted to the worship of the sun. The Phoenix is found on his coins and those of his sons, with such legends as Felix Reparatio Tern- porum, and Perpetuitas (see Scholl, Vom Vogel Phonix, p. 12) ; and John of Salisbury (Policr. i. 13; see Scholl, p. 46) reports that Con- stantinople was founded on the occasion of the appearance of a Phoenix, which is interesting as showing how later ages associated the two. ' Brandt, in Sitzungsherichte, p. 41. PHOSNIX XXXIU seemed to him vital, he yet contrived to escape martyrdom while urging the claims of truth and virtue, and to win the favor of a Christian emperor while not falling under the worst displeasure of his heathen predecessor. Such a character as we have seen Lactantius to be would be sure to attract the men of the Renaissance, and accordingly we find that he appealed strongly to its protagonists, men like Petrarch and Pico della Mirandola. Petrarch^ speaks of him as 'rolling forth in a njilky torrent,' with an obvious allusion to the name Lactantius. Perhaps with Jerome's estimate* in mind, Pico della Mirandola calls him the Christian Cicero, and even suggests that he may be Cicero's superior in eloquence.* The estimation in which he has since been held is attested by the fact that, up to 1905, there are said to have been 112 editions of his works, a num- ber greater than that of any other church-writer, the earliest being dated in 1465, at Subiaco, and being the first book printed in Italy.* LACTANTIUS AND THE DE AVE PHCENICE. The question of Lactantius' authorship of the De Ave Phomice has been much debated.^ Those who answer it in the affirmative rely upon four arguments, urged by various scholars with various force. These are: (i) the testimony of the manuscripts; (2) the attribution of the poem to Lactantius by mediaeval writers; (3) the similarity of its sentiments and diction to those of Lactan- tius' undoubted prosQ works ; (4) the Christian character of the poem. Of these it is the last which has been most vigorously contested by the opponents. ^ De Otto Religiosorum, Bk. 2 (Opera, Basel, 1554, p. 363; 1581, p. 322). * See above, p. xxix. * De Studio Divince atque Humana Philosophke, Bk. i, chap. 7 {Opera, Basel, 1573, p. 21). ^ Schanz, in Mtiller, Handbuch, 2d ed., 8*. 474.

XXXIV INTRODUCTION As to the first argument, the best manuscript, the Parisinus of the eighth century, assigns no title to the poem ; the next, the Veronensis of the ninth century, after giving Qaudian's Phoenix, subjoins : Item Lactatii de eadem Ave; the third, the Vossianus (Leiden University), of the nineteenth century, has: Versus Lactantii de Ave Fomxce} Secondly, Gregory of Tours* (before 582), treating of the won- ders of the world, and coming to the third one, begins : Tertium [fniraculum] est quod de Phoenice Lactantius refert. He then passes on to an abstract of the poem, partly in the original words, but with some difference of detail, as if Gregory might have been quoting from memory.* Again, a grammarian of the seventh century* ascribes the poem to Lactantius, and quotes it eight times. Finally, Alcuin,* in a list of books in the York Library, names, among Christian poets. Quid Fortunatus vel quid Lactantius edunt,* which would seem to refer to the Phoenix. Thirdly, various correspondences have been traced between the Phoenix and Lactantius' undoubted works.^ A few of these may be here noted: I. The description of Paradise accords in general with that of Inst. 2. 12. 15 ; Epit, 27. 2.^ **L6be, p. 40; Baehrens, Poet, Lat. Min. 3 (1881). 247-8; Manitius, p. 45. ^ De Cursu Stellarum, chap. 12.

At length, however, he appointed them a seat on earth, befitting creatures endued with reason.' ■' PHCENIX XXXV 2.

In various respects the use of words, the constructions, and the figures of speech employed by Lactantius are like those of the Phwnix} 7. The extent and minuteness of knowledge displayed by the author of the Phoenix is such as one would expect in the work of a student, one may say a philologist,^ like Lactantius.^ 8. Jerome tells us that Lactantius wrote poetry; there is therefore no intrinsic improbability of his writing such a poem as the Phoenix. To these we may add three others : 9. Lines 11-14, referring to the destruction of the earth by fire and water, refer to Phaethon and Deucalion; but so also does Inst. 2. 10. 23, and in the same order : 'All may perish, . . . either ... by the conflagration of the world, as is said to have happened in the case of Phaethon, or by a deluge, as is reported in the time of Deucalion.' ' 10. Pichon,* in a literary appreciation of Lactantius as a prose writer, says: *He possesses all the serious classical qualities — regularity, equilibriimi, moderation, clearness, precision, noble gravity, simple and sober eloquence, ingenious and patient indus- try; in one word, intellectual probity. On the other hand, we find in him the defects, or rather the gaps and limits of classicism : he is neither very deep, very impassioned, very clever, nor very * Lobe, pp. S3 ff. * We must remember that Lactantius wrote a Grammaticus. * Lobe, pp. 38-9, 43, 64-5. * Lactance, p. 455. XXXVl INTRODUCTION original.' Would not much of this serve to characterize the Phoenixf II. Lactantius himself says {Inst. 5. i. 9-11) : 'Many waver, and especially those who have any acquaintance with literature. For in this respect philosophers, orators, and poets are pernicious, because they are easily able to ensnare unwary souls by the sweetness of their discourse, and of their poems flowing with delightful modulation. These are sweets which conceal poison. And on this account I wished to connect wisdom with religion, that that vain system may not at all injure the studious ; so that now the knowledge of literature may not only be of no injury to religion and righteousness, but may even be of the greatest profit.* Is there anything in the Phcenix which militates against this con- ception ? Fourthly, as to the Scriptural character of the poem : I. Lines 25-30 describe a spring — ^living, transparent, in the midst of the grove, which it waters every month, and which bears fruit. This corresponds to Rev. 22. 1-2; Ezek. 47. 7, 12; Gen. 2. 9, 10 (cf. Ps. I. 3; 46. 4; Jer. 2. 13; 17. 8, 13; Ezek. 19. 10; John 4. 10, 14).^ It is evident that 'tree of life,' Rev. 22. 2, is a collective, and stands for a number (cf. Ezek. 47. 7, 12). A slight difficulty is occasioned by the word fons, which, how- ever, reposes on Gen. 2. 6, a verse followed by other Christian writers of the first centuries. Thus the poem Ad Flavium Felicem (Vienna Corpus Script. Eccl. Lat. 3'. 318) has (238-9) : Fons illic placido perfundit agmine compos; Quattuor inde rigant partitam flumina terram.\" The other difficulty is with respect to the monthly irrigation, but this is merely an inference, it would seem, from the fact of the monthly bearing of fruit (see esp. Ezek. 47. 12).^ ^ Cf . below, pp. lii-liii. * So also Pseudo-Cjrprian, De Laude Mart. 21 {ibid., p. 44) ; Alcimus Avitus, Poem, i. 252, 259, 260 (Migne, Patr. Lat, 59. 329) ; Isidore of Seville, Etymol. 14. 3. 3 {Pair. Lat. 82. 496) ; cf. Milton, P. L. 4. 229. 'The use of the number 12 in line 8 may also be due to a Biblical reminiscence, e. g. Ezek. 43. 16. PHOENIX XXXVU 2. Line 64 speaks of the reign of death. This must refer to such conceptions as those conveyed by Rom. 5. 12, 14, 17 (cf. Gen. 2. 17; 3. 19, 23). 3. Line 93, 'commends his spirit/ is apparently due to Lk. 23. 46 (cf. Inst. 4. 26. 32). 4. More remote and doubtful are such parallels as 78: Lk. 24. 26; 116: Jn. 14. 2; 155: Mk. I. 45.^ Ebert {Gesch. der Christl-Lat, Lit, 2d ed., i. 100) points to the praise of chastity (lines 164-5), ^^^ reference to the earth as the abode of death (line 64), and the emphasis on voluntary death (line 93-4), as evidences of Christian influence. The apparent introduction of chiliastic doctrine (cf. above, p. xxxv) is perhaps sufiiciently accounted for by the belief in a phoenix-cycle of a thousand years entertained by Martial, Pliny (29. I. 29), Claudian, and certain Jewish Rabbis (see Bochart, Hierozoicon, ed. 1796, 3. 810). Most of the earlier Christian authorities prefer the term of 500 years, while that of 1000 years is preferred by Ambrose, Gregory Nazianzen, Ausonius, and Nonnus.* Those who do not distinctly favor the attribution of the Phcmix to Lactantius fall into two classes: (i) those who have no decided opinion, who, in discussing Lactantius, fail to mention this poem, or who assign no reasons for their rejection of it (Heumann, Fritzsche, Bernhardy, Kotze, Nirschl, Alzog, Ritschl) ; and (2) those who adduce reasons, of whom Baehrens may be regarded as the type. These reasons, so far as they deserve our attention, reduce themselves to six^ : 1. No ancient author assigns the poem to Lactantius. 2. It exhibits no traces of Christian influence. 3. The argument from chiliastic doctrine is weak. 4. A Christian author would have 'improved' much further the opportunities which the poem aflForded him. 5. Lines 33 if., 58 seem to point to sun-worship. * Adduced by Lobe, pp. 50, 51. ' See note on Ph, 151. * See especially Lobe, p. 37 ; Poet. Lat, Min., ed. Baehrens, 3. 248 ff. XXXVni INTRODUCTION 6. The passage from Gregory of Tours,^ attributing the poem to Lactantius, exhibits some divergences from the De Ave Phcenice, so that Gregory's rendering may repose upon a portion of Lactantius' Hodoeporicon in which he might have incorporated the Phoenix of an earlier heathen author, that is, our very poem. (i), (2), and (3) demand no further comment than is given above; (4) is sufficiently met by the consideration that Lactan- tius may have become a Christian by slow degrees, and certainly, as we have seen (p. xxx), hesitated at times to avow the Christian faith in an explicit manner; under (5), as Lobe points out,^ the reference may as easily be to Christ; and (6) is too involved a hypothesis, when the difficulties may be met as well by supposing Gregory to have quoted from memory.' The arguments in favor of Lactantius' authorship are, then, convincing, if not overwhelming; and in the light of all the con- * siderations, I am inclined to think he published it after his con- version to Christianity, after he arrived in Nicomedia, and perhaps during the Diocletian persecution, or at least before Constantine had manifested his intention of favoring the Chris- tians. The ambiguity which has so perplexed scholars is no doubt incident to the syncretism which the poem manifests, and which at precisely this time was so much in vogue. THE PHCENIX AS A SYMBOL. The Phoenix, as represented upon Egyptian monuments, is a bird of the heron family, with the two characteristic long feathers streaming from the back of the head, and a tuft on the breast.* ^ Cf . p. xxxiv, above. ' Pp. 49, 51. ' Cf. Manitius, p. 45, note 3. * According to Lepsius, followed by Wiedemann, it is the Ardea cinerea, or purpurea (Aelteste Texte des Todtenbuches, p. 51 ; Zs, fur Agypt. Spr. 16. 104) ; according to Brugsch (Geog.Inschr, 1.258), the Ardea garzetta; according to Renouf {Book of the Dead, p. 45), the common heron or heronshaw; according to Rawlinson (Hist, Anc. Egypt, 1881, i. 82), the Ardea bubulcus. Singularly enough, the peasants of French Guiana call the Ardea helias the 'bird of the sun* (Littre, Diet, s. v. Oiseau, 7). Gruppe (Griech. Myth. 2*. 795) thinks that Ovid, in describing the heron PHCENIX XXXIX The Eg)rptian name of the Phoenix is bennu,^ from a root mean- ing 'to turn/ so that the bennu signifies, as it were, the return- ing traveler.^ This is an appropriate name for the heron, since he is a bird of passage, spending the summer in the north, and the winter in the south.^ The bennu, or heron, was evidently a symbol among the Egyptians — ^but of what? Some have said, of the planet Mercury (thus Seyffarth), others of Venus (Brugsch, Lauth),* but the generally accepted theory is that the Phoenix is a symbol of the rising sim. In a secondary sense, no doubt, it stands for other things, but the legend is constructed around this conception as its core. To become convinced of this, it will be necessary to examine the evidence of the texts. Classical Texts I. The goal of the Phoenix's solemn flight to Egypt is gener- ally Heliopolis,** or the city of the sun (Tacitus, Ovid, Pliny (who adds, 'near Panchaia'), Clement of Rome, Aelian, Epi- phanius, Pseudo-Epiphanius, HorapoUo, the Greek Physiologus, Lactantius (if we emend ortus to urbem, as was first done by Gryphiander, 1618), Claudian, Achilles Tatius). Others add or substitute 'temple of the sun' (Herodotus, Ovid, Pseudo-Epi- which flew away from the burning city of Ardea (Met. 14. 573 ff.). has in mind this identification. Other writers have thought of the hawk (Maspero), of the golden pheasant (Cuvier, Lenz, Benecke), of the lap- wing (Keller), or of the flamingo (Fundgruben des Orients i. 202). Ebers . (Egypt, Princess, chap. 20) suggests a resemblance to the bird of paradise. *The identification first made by Seyffarth (ZDMG. 3 (1849). 63), and confirmed from monumental evidence by Brugsch (Nouvelles Recherches, etc., Berlin, 1856; Geog. Inschr. i. 258; ZDMG. 10. 649 ff.; cf. Wiede- mann, Aegypt. Gesch,, p. 45, note; Scholl, Vom Vogel Ph'dnix, p. 42, note 4). ' Cf.

The obelisk of the Porta del Popolo at Rome, which repre- sents near the top an adoration of Ra by one of the kings who erected it, bears in the left line of the northern face the words, 'Rameses II, son of Ra, who filled the temple of the Phoenix [ha-t-bennu] with his splendors.'^ 3. In the Book of the Dead, chap. 17, we read^ : *I am that * What here follows reposes chiefly upon Wiedemann, op. cit. ' Marucchi, Gli Obelischi Egisiam di Roma, pp. 58, 146 ; cf.

What i& the meaning of this? The Phoenix signifies the Osiris which is in HeliopoHs ; the union of everything which is there signifies his body, or, in other words, eternity and ever- lastingness, eternity signifying the day, and everlastingness the night' The Phoenix, then, signifies the union of day and night, or, one might say, of life and death ; now as, according to Egyptian religious conceptions, Osiris represents the deceased, or, we might here say, death, and as the union of day and night, the point where the two come together, is represented by the Phoenix, the Phoenix must be the rising sun, with the emphasis not on the night from which he emerges, but on the attributes of the sun as it issues from darkness or death.^ 4. The Book of the Dead, chap. 13, has, in Budge's transla- tion: T go in like the Hawk, and I come forth like the Bennu bird [the Phoenix], the morning star (?) of Ra'^ — where, for 'morning star,* Wiedemann prefers to read 'morning divinity,' i. e., morning sun.* 5. On the wooden coffin of Hetepher-t-s in the Vatican we have, on each side of a central picture, a hawk and a Phoenix respectively. On the right, seated on a standard planted on the mountain of the sun, which is painted in red, is the hawk, with the legend, 'Glory be to Ra in the underworld !' On a similar standard on the left is the Phoenix, with the legend, 'Glory be to Ra when he rises 1' So, too, on the door of a tomb figured by Lepsius,* the middle is occupied by a picture of the bark of the sun ; on the right is a Phoenix, with the legend, 'He rises each day in the morning ; he traverses the heaven as . . .' ; while on the left is a hawk, with the words, 'He enters into the underworld ; he shines.' * So I understand Wiedemann, pp. 93-4. , 'Similarly in chap. 122 (Budge, p. 185). * Those who identify the Phoenix with Venus rely on the words 'morn- ing star,* but Wiedemann shows (p. 100) that elsewhere Venus is called 'the star of the bark of Bennu-Osiris.' Now Bennu-Osiris, as we have seen under 3, means the rising sun, and hence Venus is here called, with all propriety, the star of the rising sun's bark. * Denkmdler aus Aegypten 3. 272*. xlii INTRODUCTION 6. In the Book of the_ Dead, chap. 24, we have^: 'I am Chepera [the rising sun], who brings himself into being ... in order to traverse the heaven like the Phoenix among the great gods.' 7. In the Book of the Dead, chap. 64, we read (Wiedemann) : *He [Osiris] comes from Sekhem to Heliopolis to make known to the Phoenix the things of the underworld. \"Hail, . . . thou creator of forms, like the god Chepera [the rising sun], issuing as sun-disk above the aw/a-incense:\" ' 8. In a Louvre papyrus. No. i. 2, the Phoenix appears with the red sun-disk on his head. 9. On the coffin of Suti-mes in the Louvre, and similarly on the coffin of Tent-Amon in Berlin, *the great god Phoenix' says : *I am the Phoenix who begets himself, who gives incense to the Osiris.' 10. In a Louvre papyrus, No I. i, we read: 'Glory to thee, O Ra, . . . thou who comest into being above Heliopolis, O Phoenix, great god!' Beside this are two pictures, one of Ra, and one of the Phoenix. 11. On a monument at Leiden he is called 'the Phoenix, the soul of Ra,' a scarab calls him 'the heart of the renewed Ra,' and a papyrus 'the Phoenix of Ra.'^ To the foregoing may be added a few passages from the Book of the Dead (tr. Budge). Chap. 29 B (p. 77): 'I am the Bennu [Phoenix], the soul of Ra.' Chap, yy (p. 132): 'Those who were dwelling in their companies have been brought unto me, and they bowed low in paying homage unto me, and in saluting me with cries of joy. I have risen, and I have gathered myself together like the beautiful hawk of gold, which hath the head of a Bennu bird, and Ra entereth in day by day to hearken unto my words.' Chap. 125 (p. 189) : 'He hath caused me to come forth like a Bennu bird, and to utter words.' The ancient Egyptians conceived of the sun as describing^ a circle round the earth, and hence they gave it the name of bennu, the returning traveler. Now it happened that bennu was also * So Wiedemann ; Budge differs. * Some other texts, cited by Wiedemann, are here omitted, as their bearing is less readily understood. PHCENIX :liii the name of a bird of passage which regularly disappeared and returned, and so this was declared holy to the siui, and one of its manifestations. The return of the sun took place in the morning, and so the bennu became the symbol of the rising sun. From this idea was evolved the further one that the sun engen- dered itself anew, and so likewise the bennu. He combined night and day into one whole, fashioned and guided time in a mystical and holy manner, and each morning rose to a spheral music, while the songs of gods and men resounded in joyful chorus to his praise. At his birth the heaven flamed in splendor, the new sun was bom in fire, and from the dying flames of dawn he flew new-bom up the sky. To him may be applied the words of the Boulak h)rmn to Ra^: *Glory is his in the temple when he arises from the house of flames; all the gods love his perfume when he approaches from Arabia; he is the lord of dew when he comes from Matau ; he draws nigh in beauty from Phoenicia, encomi&ssed by the gods.'^ Since the Phoenix in this, his central mythological aspect, may thus be identified with the deified sun at his rising, the hymns to Ra (or Khepera) will yield other passages applicable to the Phoenix of our poem. Thus the birds which follow and salute him are paralleled by the gods who follow Ra : *Ra riseth in his horizon, and his company of the gods follow after him.'^ *A11 the gods rejoice when they behold thee, the King of heaven.'* Ra is self-begotten : Thou self -begotten one, O thou who didst give thyself birth.' O thou beautiful being, thou dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of the disk. . . . O Ra, . . . the divine man-child, the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king of earth.* Thou art crowned with the majesty of thy beauties ; thou mouldest thy limbs as thou dost advance, and thou bringest them forth without birth-pangs in the form of Ra, as thou dost rise up unto the upper • 7 air. *Also translated in Records of the Past 2. 127-136. * This paragraph closely follows Wiedemann. * Book of the Dead, tr.

With reference to the egg associated with the Phoenix : O thou who art in thine egg (i. e., Ra), who shinest from thy disk and risest in thy horizon.^ With reference to one of the colors attributed to the Phoenix: Thou illuminest the two lands with rays of turquoise light.' Thou hast made heaven and earth bright with thy rays of pure emerald light.® The Phoenix, as the symbol of the rising sun, is at the same time, among a people so keen for immortality as were the Egyptians, a natural symbol of the resurrection.\"^ In this sense it is taken by the Christians of the first centuries, who drew for illustration of the renewed life, now upon the cycles of vegeta- tion (cf. Ph, 243, note), and now upon the phases of the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars; day and night; winter and spring).® Among the patristic writers who employ the Phoenix in this sense may be named Clemens Romanus, the author or authors of the Apostolical Constitutions, Tertullian, Eusebius, Zeno, Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose, and Epiphanius.® Other writers who employ the same figure are Commodian, Nonnus, Sidonius, Ennodius, Dracontius, and the Englishman, ^Ifric.

Lk. I. 78) with Christ,^ it is not surprising that the Phoenix should come to be employed as a figure of the Saviour. HELIOPOLIS The name of the Phoenix is indissolubly associated with that of Heliopolis, to which reference is made by Lactantius, Ph, 121, Soils ad urbem (rendered in our poem by sunbeorht gesetu, 278). About 586 B. c, in the reign of Apries, or Uahabra, Jeremiah, being then in Tahpanhes, the modern Defneh, wrote thus of Nebuchadrezzar, King of Babylon: *He shall also break the pillars [obelisks?] of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire'; and in 568 b. c. Nebuchadrezzar actually invaded Egypt. Beth- shemesh, a translation into Hebrew of the Egyptian Per-Ra, 'house or city of the sun,' was the city known to the Greeks as Heliopolis, of which nothing now remains but the 'ruins shown at Matarieh, some five miles northwest of Cairo. In Jeremiah's time it must have already been about 3400 years old, if we may I Jn. I. 5; especially Mai. 4. 2; Jn. 8. 12. Cf. Usener, Gotternamen, pp. 183-5, Diet, Christ, Antiqq, i. 357-8, and my note on Chr. 104-129. A whole series of modern poets continue the tradition. Thus Dante (Purg, 7. 26; Par. 9. 8; 10. 53; 18. 105; 25. 54; 30. 126; Conv, 3. 12. 51-6); and, to instance a poet five hundred years later, and of quite different character, Byron (Sardanapalus 2. i. 14-7) : Oh I thou true sun! The burning oracle of all that live, As fountain of all life, and symbol of Him who bestows it. ^ The motto of Rutgers College is : Sol justiti<e, et Occidentem illustra. *As early as 242-3 a. d. (Cumont, Textes et Monuments FigurSs Relatifs aux My stores de Mithra i. 355). This led some of the Chris- tians of the first centuries to identify the physical sun with Christ, an error which was combated by Augustine, among others. The *Deo soli' of Exod. 22. 20 was even sometimes interpreted as *to God, the sun' {Civ, Dei 19. 23). ; and there were pagans who appear honestly to have believed that the sun was the god of the Christians (Tertullian, Apol. 16, etc.). As late as the fifth century. Pope Leo the Great complained that the faith- ful still persisted in adoring the sun at the instant of his rising. On the whole subject, see Cumont, op, cit,, pp. 355-6. Xlvi INTRODUCTION trust the assignment of it to the lime of King Menes/ or Mena, the founder of the First Dynasty. In the Second Dynasty (ca. 3100 B. c), the worship of Mnevis, the sacred bull, was estab- lished there, according to Manetho.* Inscriptions of the Fourth Dynasty (ca. 2900-2750) mention it.* The Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2750-2625), according to one tradition, starts from a high priest of Heliopolis, and claims divine descent from Ra, the sun-god.* In the Twelfth Dynasty, Sesostris I (1980-1935 B. c.) is said to have built in Heliopolis a temple to the sun; and a leathern roll, dating from the time of Amenhotep IV' (1375-1358 b. c), professes to contain a record of this founding.® The hymn sung or recited on this occasion included the sentence, *the works will • last' (or, as the German translation has it, *Das Gemachte sei bleibend') ; but all that has lasted is one obelisk,^ the most beauti- ful now in Egypt. Somewhere about 1640 b. c,® in the Seventeenth Dynasty, may perhaps be placed the period of Joseph's residence in Egypt. Joseph's wife was of Heliopolis, for we are told in Gen. 41. 45** that Tharaoh gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- phera^® priest of On,^^ that is, high priest (probably) of Heliop- olis.\" iLepsius, Chron. i. 326; cf.

It was at Heliopolis that human sacrifices were abolished, if we may believe Manetho,^ by King Aahmose, or Amasis (i 580-1 557 B. c). Heliopolis* was, in the Eighteenth Dynasty, the centre of one of the greatest religious reforms known to history, a reform associated with the name of Amenhotep IV (see p. xlvi), later known as Akhenaten or Ikhnaton ('the splendor of the sun's disk'). The nature of this reform, which, as an exotic, was destined to expire with its promoter, may be described in the words of Petrie*^ : Other ages had worshiped the human-figured sun-god Ra, or a hawk as his emblem; and when the sun itself was represented, it was as a concrete solid ball. But a more refined and really philo- sophical worship was substituted for this by Akhenaten, that of the radiant energy of the sun, of the sun as sustaining all life by his beams. No one — sun-worshiper or philosopher — seems to have realized until within this [19th] century the truth which was the basis of Akhenaten's worship, that the rays of the sun are the means of the sun's action, the source of all life, power, and force in the universe. ... If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern scientific conceptions, we could not find a flaw in the cor- rectness of this view of the energy of the solar system. . . . Not a rag of superstition or of falsity can be found clinging to this new Epiphanius (^Ancor. 84) says of the name Heliopolis that it is 'a transla- tion from the Egyptian and Hebrew On* (cf. Sayce, Re\\. of Anc, Egypt and Bah,, pp. 86-7). See also Ephraem the Syrian, Comm. on Jeremiah, chap. 33. The Aven of Ezek. 30. 17 is the same word (Hastings 3. 621). ^PrcBp. Evang. 9. 23. * Eusebius also preserves a statement (9. 18 ; cf .

Petrie then quotes the great hymn to the Aten, which he thinks may have been composed by the King. On6 stanza runs : How many are the things which thou hast made ! Thou Greatest the land by thy will, thou alone, With peoples, herds, and flocks. Everything on the face of the earth that walketh on its feet, Everything in the air that flieth with its wings. He then adds : In this hymn all trace .of polytheism, and of anthropomorphism, or theriomorphism, has entirely disappeared. ... It would tax any one in our days to recount better than this the power and action of the rays of the sun. ... In ethics a great change also marks this age. The customary glorying in war has almost disappeared; only once, and that in a private tomb, is there any indication of war during the reign. The motto 'Living in Truth' is constantly put forward as the keynote to the king's character, and to his changes in various lines. And domestic affection is held up as his ideal of life, the queen and children being shown with him on every occasion. In art the aim was the direct study of nature, with as little influence as possible from convention; animals in rapid motion, and natural grouping of plants, were specially studied, and treated in a manner more natural than in any other Oriental art.^ Rameses III (1198-67 b. c.) gave to Heliopolis, among other things, 12,963 serfs, 45,544 cattle, and 103 Egjrptian towns^ ; and in the great Harris papyrus he tells of the gardens, lakes, sculp- tures, jewels, and scrolls which he there made for Ra.^ The temple he built is at Tell el Yehudeh, north of Heliopolis.* One of the most interesting mentions of Heliopolis belongs to the period of the Twenty-third Dynasty, under what is called the Ethiopian Dominion.

Here we have several things of inter- est in relation to our poem — the lake or fountain in which the sun-god bathes his face, adoration to the rising sun,^ the offering of incense, and the temple of the sun entered by the king with solemn priestly ceremonial.^ Strabo (ca. 60 b. c.-ca. 25 a. d.) says^: There, too, is Heliopolis, situated upon a large mound. It con- tains a temple of the sun. ... In front of the mound are lakes, into which the neighboring canal discharges itself. At present the city is entirely deserted. ... At Heliopolis we saw large buildings, in which the priests lived. For it is said that anciently this was the principal residence of the priests, who studied philosophy and astronomy; but there are no longer either such a body of persons or such pursuits. . . . The residences of Plato and of Eudoxus were shown to us. Eudoxus came here with Plato,* and, according to some writers, lived thirteen years in the society of the priests. For the latter were distinguished for their knowledge of the heavenly bodies, but were mysterious and uncommunicative, yet after a time were prevailed upon by courtesy to acquaint them with some of the principles of their science, but the barbarians concealed the greater part of them. In the period of Plato and Eudoxus, Egypt had been groaning for more than a century under Persian rule; Nebuchadrezzar and Cambyses*^ had laid waste the noble edifices of Heliopolis, and burned them with fire; Egypt, as Petrie says, 'was a car- case'® ; yet Heliopolis still remained the university of Egypt, the home of philosophy, and astronomy, and medicine. *Apion reported that Moses offered all his prayers toward the sun- rising, and in the open air, while at Heliopolis (Josephus, Contra Apion 2. 2). ^ For a full account of this, see note on Ph, 107 ff. . • 17. 27-9. *To these Plutarch (Is, and Osir. 10) adds Pythagoras, his teacher being Oinuphis; and Solon (Solon 26), his teacher being Psenophis. The teacher of Plato was Sechnuphis (Clement of Alexandria, Strom. I. 15. 69) ; that of Eudoxus, Chonuphis (Diog, Laert, 8. 8. 6). For full reference"
