I don’t think some of the stars like Gio Renya and Weston McKennie raised their level enough and have been playing good enough. Christian Pulisic has raised his level, but I think at the end of the day, a coach does have that responsibility to get the best out of the players, but players also need to show up, be accountable and push themselves as well. So I think the next coach that comes in needs to get the best out of these players, needs to push these players more.”\n\nFOX Sports analyst Carli Lloyd on Greg Berhalter’s release and the future of the USMNT | WATCH\n\nTop Shots\n\nUp NextonFOXand FS1(All Times ET)\n\nSaturday, July 13 (3rd Place COPA AMÉRICA)\n\n7:00 PM on FS1 – COPA TONIGHT\n\nAlexi Lalas, Carli Lloyd, Rob Stone, Clint Dempsey\n\n8:00 PM on FS1 – COPA AMÉRICA: Canada vs. Uruguay\n\nJP Dellacamera, Cobi Jones, Dr. Joe.
