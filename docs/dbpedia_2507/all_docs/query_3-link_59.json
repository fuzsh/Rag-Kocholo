        "text": "Sherman Timbs can laugh about it, now. “Freshman year I got here and it was probably 18 of us in the d-line room,” he recalls. Nor was it just the numbers. That Mississippi State meeting room featured, for a few, Montez Sweat, Jeffery Simmons, Fletcher Adams, Marquiss Spencer, Kobe Jones, Lee Autry, Chauncey Rivers, Braxton Hoyett, and more.\n\nAnd here was an optimistic and unrecruited guy sitting down with, and shortly practicing alongside, a host of SEC stars and future professionals. Yeah, it’s worth a laugh now.\n\n“So I was just this kid from private school coming, just trying to stay alive out there!” Fortunately Timbs survived that 2017 initiation. Now in 2021 his chance to thrive has arrived, though at a different position. So far, “I think it’s going pretty good. They moved me, I’m playing outside linebacker now, the sam position. And I’ve been kind of getting a little comfortable with this transition from d-line.”\n\nActually checking the 2017 Mississippi State roster shows Timbs as ‘athlete.’ And as #88. On the pre-season practice field today he’ll be wearing #34 and lining up outside and behind one end of the defensive line. What hasn’t changed is the athlete. At 6-2, 265 pounds Timbs has moves to go with fifth-year season muscle.\n\nHe also has improved potential for 2021 action as State’s sam. Not as a starter, for a very understandable reason wearing #2. “Tyrus Wheat, me and him are playing the same position. He’s been playing a while longer than me, a lot more snaps.” With sacks and pressures and tackles-for-losses to show, too.\n\nTimbs is doing just fine as a backup, even alternate nowadays. “Me and him talk and I learn a lot from him.” But be sure, Timbs is ambitious to make the most of this altered opportunity. Stepping back-and-out after years beating his helmet against blockers has been simpler than some expected.\n\nAt least, “It wasn’t that bad!” Timbs grinned. “I mean, it relates to what I was doing at d-line still. So I kind of half-way knew what I was going to be doing in the transition. It’s been going pretty good.”\n\nThis change of job wasn’t a new spring thing, exactly. As the 2020 season wound down coordinator Zach Arnett saw future needs for outside ‘backers with game experience. Yes, there were some talented new kids coming, and here in preseason freshmen John Lewis and Ty Cooper already have their own strong(side) ambitions.\n\nStill it would help having an old hand to share the job with fellow senior Wheat. “It kind of came around the Egg Bowl last year,” Timbs said. “They started working me in there and I’ve stuck with it since then.” But not exactly immediately, as Timbs had to work more in the Armed Forces Bowl at an injury-thinned end position\n\nIt paid off with three tackles including a second-quarter sack which forced Tulsa to settle for a field goal. Timbs agrees, there is nothing quite like bagging that first quarterback…and especially when it really matters. “Oh yeah, man, it was an eye-opener for sure,” he said.\n\n“It was kind of all the hard work finally paying off and having something to show for it. That’s all everybody asks me about now, is that one play. But yeah, it’s surreal just having that happen.”\n\nNext time Timbs takes down a quarterback it will be coming off the strong side of the blocking. He has the ’21 advantage too in a real spring session to complete the change-over. Timbs says learning plays in zoom meetings was one thing; doing it on the practice field with blockers in the face and coaches in the ear is entirely different.\n\nSo should be this Bulldog defense as a result. “And now you can see a great difference between the recognition of what’s going on with the defense and the team and everything.”\n\nSafe to say Timbs got an eye-full as a freshman out of Indianola Academy. Where, it needs reminding, the big kid was a…running back. Yeah, tackling a 260-pounder in academy ball was a challenge. Timbs rumbled for 1,034 yards and 27 touchdowns as a 2016 senior, while making 49 tackles on defense. There’s a state championship trophy in the I.A. room now and a championship game Most Valuable Player award at the Timbs home.\n\nStill walking into that Shira Complex meetings was something very, very different for a walk-on joining guys recruited by Southern football heavyweights. “I came in with a group of studs there at d-line,” Timbs says in obvious understatement. Yet, “Really the whole room kind of took me in when I got here. Jeffery Simmons, Montez Sweat, they’re all my good buddies from pretty much the start.”\n\nGood teachers, too. “Just watching them and learning from them and trying to find my role. Learning how they went about things and how they earned their respect, from what they did. I still remember things from freshman year up to now.”\n\nIt’s just a matter of taking those lessons from defensive end and applying them at linebacker. And, under the direct coaching of Arnett himself. Timbs agrees with public perception of the coordinator/linebackers coach as, ummm…\n\n“He’s intense. I like it. I like the way he just goes about this defense like it should be. Mississippi State has always been a defensive school. He’s really taken that in and is pushing us and making us strive to do that and live up to that. I like him a lot for that. And in general, he’s a good guy.”"
