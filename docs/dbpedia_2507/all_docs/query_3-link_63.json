        "text": "While the Romantics looked to nature’s mountains in the form of Mont Blanc, the Jungfrau, or Skiddaw to find a visible externalization of their psychology,1 Blake’s mountains reflect an interior vision of the mountains of mythology and those, not far distant, of the Bible. These befit a poet who saw his visions in the worlds of thought and, from all accounts, never saw a genuine mountain (much less a Welsh one) in his life. Mircea Eliade summarizes the mythological dimension:\n\nMountains are the nearest thing to the sky, and are thence endowed with a twofold holiness: on the one hand they share in the spatial symbolism of transcendence—they are ‘high,’ ‘vertical,’ ‘supreme,’ and so on—and on the other, they are the especial domain of all hierophanies of atmosphere, and therefore, the dwelling of the gods.2\n\nTheir symbolic and religious significance, he continues, “is endless.” One can see the sacred quality stemming from the fact that mountains penetrate the upper, pure regions of the atmosphere (aether) carried on in seventeenth-century poetic diction, where standard non-negative epithets are “cloud-touching, star-brushing.”3 For the ancient Greeks the upper air, source of meteors and other meteorological events, was integrally related to mountains and “high ground”—ta meteora; their conjunction offers “a spot where one can pass from one cosmic zone to another” (Eliade, p. 100). Blake writes of the “Atlantean hills” that “from their bright summits you may pass to the Golden world” (Am 10.6, 7).4 The dwelling of Zeus—Dios, God of the Bright Sky—was Mount Olympus, but “olympus” was to be found all over mountainous Greece; the word itself is the pre-Greek term for “mountain.” The Romans, though lacking mountains, nonetheless dignified “their own poor little Capitol . . . with the title of ‘Mons’”5 and the cosmological zone of the female body receives the same dignity.6\n\nIn Mesopotamia, “temples were called the ‘mountain house,’ the ‘house of the mountain of all lands,’ the ‘mountain of storms,’ the ‘bound between sky and earth,’ and so on.”7 The association of meteora, high things, and centering, is again expressed in the widespread belief of various cultures that their mountain lies directly under the pole star, and so presents the Axis Mundi. In the Old Testament one of the names of God, El-Shaddai, can be translated as “the God of the Mountain, the God of the ‘Height’ or (as the highest) an astral god,”8 and in the historical period of Israel, “mountain house” became a common name for “temple.”9\n\nThe closeness of God and the mountain is typified by the theophanies at Sinai. As houses of God, they are also places of sacrifice, high—Latin alta—altars; in Genesis 22:2 God tells Abraham to offer his son “for[e] a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.” So Los takes Orc “to the top of a mountain” (BU 20.21) to chain him down. The New Testament made great use of the Old Testament symbolism, and its repeated description of Jesus’ going eis to oros, “up the mountain” or “into the mountains,” assumes a formulaic dimension.10 Little wonder that Blake should characterize the two Testaments by their respective dominant mountains:\n\nSuch is the Divine Written Law of Horeb & Sinai:\n\nAnd such the Holy Gospel of Mount Olivet & Calvary\n\n(J 16.68-69)\n\nbegin page 197 | ↑ back to top One mountain, however, serves to site and anchor both Testaments: Mount Zion, “Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth” (Ps. 48:2), “the holy Mountain” (Zech. 8:3) of the Lord and synonymous with its city, Jerusalem. So Paul reminds the Hebrews, “But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem” (12:22). Tiny Mount Zion is to “tower over the other mountains” (Clifford, p. 157; cf. Is. 2:4, Mic. 4:1).\n\nAs Jerusalem is to Mount Zion, so she was and will be to Albion; which is to say that Albion is—or rather, was and will be—a holy mountain. Holinshed, who begins his Chronicles discussing the legend of the ancient denomination of England, refers to speculation “whether Britaine was called Albion of the word Alb, white, or Alp an hill.”11 The name in fact is connected with the root of Latin Alpis, Gaelic alp, and Irish ailp, meaning mountain. Blake plays on this assonance and etymological connection, imagining that Los’s “voice is heard from Albion: the Alps & Appenines / Listen” (J 85.16-17). As only high mountains tend to be white (with snow), the traditional association of Albion with albus could also be seen to suggest that Albion was once a high mountain, now islanded by the sea. This could be confirmed by Albion’s white cliffs, a word Blake generally uses in its less common sense of “a steep slope, a hill.” The cliffs are the sides of Albion’s great mountain as it slips down below the surface of the sea: “ . . . Albion the White Cliff of the Atlantic / The Mountain of Giants . . . ” (J 49.6-7).\n\nMountains are necessarily related to the image of the ocean deluge. Thomas Burnet’s mytho-poetic Sacred Theory of the Earth (1681) argued that the weight of the floodwaters broke the crust of the paradisal “mundane egg” into mountains.12 In a somewhat similar manner, when Eternity rolls apart in The Book of Urizen what is left is “mountainous all around,” dominated by “ruinous fragments of life / Hanging frowning cliffs & all between / An ocean of voidness unfathomable” (5.7, 9-11). Earlier cosmologies also focused on the creation of “land” out of Chaos (if not Eternity)—the deep, the Semitic Tehom. These traditions imagined that the mountains were placed in Tehom to serve as foundations of the world—they were the first dry land, like Mount Ararat after the later flood. According to some rabbinical similes, “God’s mountains reach down to the great Tehom” and “these mountains dominate Tehom, lest it should rise and innundate the earth.”13 As foundations, the mountains are seen as the “pillars of heaven” (Job 26:11, cf. 9:6). So in Albion/Jerusalem,\n\nPancrass & Kentish-town repose\n\nAmong her golden pillars high:\n\nAmong her golden arches which\n\nShine upon the starry sky.\n\n(J 27.9-12)\n\nThe cosmological scope of this reference is clear remembering that the “pillard hall & arched roof of Albions skies” receive “the eternal wandering stars” (FZ, II, 25.16, 32.9; E 310, 315).14 Since the flood represented the victory of Chaos, of Leviathan, some rabbinical commentators held that the land of Israel was not submerged by the Deluge, a belief which is paralleled in Islam. A. J. Wensinck comments:\n\nWhy the Sanctuary is not attained by the waters of the Deluge is clear: Deluge is the reign of Tehom, of old a demonic power, familiar from the creation stories. The Sanctuary is the type and representation of Kosmos and of Paradise and as such a power diametrically opposed to Chaos; when the Semites maintain that the Sanctuary was not reached by the Deluge, this is not only due to the opinion that the Sanctuary is the highest place in the world, but also to the conviction that Chaos cannot gain a complete victory over Kosmos, for behind the latter is the creative power of the supreme being.\n\n(pp. 15-16)\n\nThis conception offers several analogies to Blake’s images, from that of the one sense through which man may “himself pass out” (Eur iii.5) which remained after the other senses “whelm’d in deluge” (Eur 10.10-11) over him, to the picture of Albion as the mountain remaining when “the Atlantic Continent sunk round Albions Cliffy shore / And the Sea pourd in amain” (J 32[36].40-41). The “sea of Time & Space” is the principal deluge. This may account for the frequent graphic depiction of an action taking place on a location surrounded by water; it is an image of England, but it signifies also imaginative vision, not yet drowned in Time and Space (or Realism or Naturalism). So when Reuben sleeps “like one dead in the valley”—the vale, or low-lying, submersible land—the notable thing is that he is thus “Cut off from Albions mountains & from all the Earths summits” (J 30[34].43,44). “Wild seas & Rocks” are to “close up Jerusalem away from / The Atlantic Mountains[e]” (J 49.77-50.1). America tells that\n\nOn those vast shady hills between America & Albions shore;\n\nNow barr’d out by the Atlantic sea: call’d Atlantean hills\n\nBecause from their bright summits you may pass to the Golden world\n\nAn ancient palace, archetype of mighty Emperies,\n\nRears its immortal pinnacles. . . .\n\n(10.5-9)\n\nOne critic has called this passage “iconic” and remarked its “tantalizing quality of meanings nearly communicated yet withheld.”15 Without entering the context of America or the “suitability of invoking the myth of a lost, paradisal Atlantis as a symbol of transcendent unity,”16 I would simply emphasize that the mythic structure of the mountain sanctuary, temple, palace is itself a “meaning communicated.” The reader is told something about the situation, appearance, and function of the summit-structure and it takes its place among Blake’s visionary locales—the description engages our attention by calling up latent (and several times removed) mythological associations. The Atlantic, one should remember, is named not for Atlantis, but for the Titan Atlas, seen in classical times as Mount Atlas, the pillar of heaven. Atlas, Blake believed, was the Greek name for Albion, “Patriarch of the Atlantic” (DC, E 534; italics added). Blake viewed begin page 198 | ↑ back to top his Hesperian situation quite personally, as evident in the dedicatory poem to The Grave, which says that his “designs unchangd remain”:\n\nFor above Times troubled Fountains\n\nOn the Great Atlantic Mountains\n\nIn my Golden House on high\n\nThere they Shine Eternally\n\n(“The Caverns of the Grave,” 17-20)\n\nThese mountains rise out of the sea of time becoming the “infinite” and “eternal” mountains, the site of paradise: “the Garden of Eden . . . the golden mountains” (J 28.2), “the mountain palaces of Eden” (J 41[46].3-4).\n\nThe setting of Abraham’s sacrifice and Jesus’ crucifixion leads to the very different image of Albion “slain upon his Mountains / And in his Tent,”\n\na formula which occurs three times (M 3.1-2; 19.20; J 59.16). The Tent is the Sky (M 29.4), and the plural mountains reach back to the common mythological idea of a central tent-pole, axle-tree mountain, and four smaller poles making a square around it (the sort depicted, in cross-section, dropping around plates 1 and 21 of Job). The image also evokes “mountainous Wales,” where Albion’s ancient inhabitants fled originally to escape the Saxons, there finally to be conquered by Norman Edward I, who, as retold by Gray, put to death “all the Bards that fell into his hands”—the poetic being of Albion.17\n\nBut from all indications, something happened earlier, something which “separated the stars from the mountains: the mountains from Man” (J 17.31). Somewhere in the Druid past, Albion changed “From willing sacrifice of self, to sacrifice of (miscall’d) Enemies / For Atonement,” an action, like Abraham’s, located on the mountains. Albion concludes his opening speech in Jerusalem saying:\n\nBy demonstration man alone can live, and not by faith.\n\nMy mountains are my own, and I will keep them to myself:\n\nThe Malvern and the Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon & Snowdon\n\nbegin page 199 | ↑ back to top Are mine. here will I build my Laws of Moral Virtue!\n\nHumanity shall be no more: but war & princedom & victory!\n\n(J 4.28-32, my italics)\n\nIn less than ten lines, “Albions mountains run with blood, the cries of war & of tumult” (J 5.6). These sacrifices in turn react on their sites as\n\n. . all the mountains and hills shrink up like a withering gourd\n\nAs the Senses of Men shrink together under the Knife of flint\n\nIn the hands of Albions Daughters, among the Druid Temples\n\n(J 66.82-84)18\n\nOther of Albion’s fallen mountains are listed in another catalogue: “ . . . the Peak, Malvern & Cheviot Reason in Cruelty / Penmaenmawr & Dhinas-bran Demonstrate in Unbelief” (J 21.34-35). The single appearance of “Dhinas-bran” may refer to “Dîn Brëon, the Hill of Legislature,” which “was the sacred mount, where . . . the ancient judges of the land, assembled, to decide causes.”19\n\nBlake was evidently impressed by the description in Ezekiel of the sacrificial feast the Lord is to\n\nmake of his enemies; all the beasts are invited to the “great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood;” there “ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken” (29:17, 19). In “the Song” sung at “The Feast of Los and Enitharoom” Blake transfers the action to the mountains themselves—which begin to emerge as solidified giant forms with Biblical histories:\n\n[The Mountain del.] Ephraim calld out to [The Mountain del.] Zion: Awake O Brother Mountain\n\nLet us refuse the Plow & Spade, the heavy Roller & spiked\n\nHarrow. burn all these Corn fields. throw down all these fences\n\nFattend on Human blood and drunk with wine of life is better far\n\n(FZ, I, 14.7-10, E 304, 746)\n\nClifford notes the suggestion that “the feast on the mountain of the bodies of the enemy is a transformation of the exchatological picture of the ‘joyous feast’” as in Isaiah 25:6-8. “Possibly,” he concludes, “the banquet for the victorious on the mountain and the slaughter-sacrifice of the enemies are one and the same” (pp. 176-77). This duality seems applicable to the Wedding Feast of Los and Enitharmon, since they begin, with Urizen, “Rejoicing begin page 200 | ↑ back to top in the Victory” (12.35, E 303, cf. J 4.32 above). Blake’s intertwining vision of the Fall on the mountains of Israel and England follows from his conception of Druid practices and from hints in the Old Testament—unified in an image of “moral” sacrifice on mountains (classical mountains, ora, become moral emblems). His first use of the negative power of Old Testament mountains is the figure and setting of “har,” the Hebrew for “mountain,” in particular, “the mountain” (hā-hār) where Moses received the Law (cf. Clifford, p. 107ff.); as Blake would have read in Bryant: “Har and Hor signify a mountain; ὄρος [oros] of the Greeks.”20 So Tiriel first enters “the pleasant gardens of Har” (Tir 2.10)—reminiscent of “Eden the garden of God” located on “the holy mountain of God” (Ez. 28:13-14)—and on his return, “the mountains of Har” (7.19).21 The French Revolution imagines “the old mountains . . . like aged men, fading away” (9) which aptly suits “aged Har” (Tir 8.6).\n\nThe Book of Joshua offers the Druid-like image of the Israelites setting up “a great stone . . . under an oak . . . by the sanctuary of the LORD” (25.26) at Shechem, which lies between Mount Gerizim, appointed by the Lord for a blessing, and Mount Ebal, appointed for a curse. Here, in the natural amphitheater of the two mountainsides, Joshua divided the tribes of Israel according to the words of Moses, and while one hears little of blessing, twelve shouted verses beginning “Cursed be . . . ” (Jos. 27:11ff.) further illustrate the nature of “barren mountains of Moral Virtue” (J 45[31].19-20; cf. 4.31, above). Jerusalem laments: “The mountain of blessing is itself a curse & an astonishment: / The hills of Judea are fallen with me into the deepest hell” (J 79.7-8). A passage repeated in The Four Zoas and Jerusalem shows Tirzah binding down the Human Form crying:\n\nBind him down Sisters bind him down on Ebal. Mount of cursing:\n\nMalah come forth from Lebanon: & Hoglah from Mount Sinai\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWeep not so Sisters! weep not so! our life depends on this\n\nOr mercy & truth are fled away from Shechem & Mount Gilead\n\nUnless my beloved is bound upon the Stems of Vegetation\n\n(J 68.3-4, 7-9; FZ, VIII, 105.47-48, 51-53, E 364)\n\nThe “Stems of Vegetation,” a revision of The Four Zoas’ introduction to this passage reveals, are the “stones” of the mountain altar: “binding on the Stones [stems del.] / Their victims & with knives tormenting them” (105.28-29 and E 759). “Druid” monuments tend to be associated with Salisbury Plain, but describing his picture “The Ancient Britons,” Blake wrote, “Distant among the mountains, are Druid Temples, similar to Stone Henge” (DC, E 536). Blake was following good authority. Borlase’s Antiquities . . . of Cornwall, for example, observed of the Druids that, “It was a general custom to chuse for their places of worship woods which stood on the tops of hills, and mountains, as more becoming the dignity and sublime offices of their devotions, and of nearer neighbourhood (as they imagined) to the habitations of their Gods.”22 Borlase remarks the Old Testament parallels and describes “Karnbrê-hill, which has all the evidences that can be desired of having been appropriated to the use of the British Religion;” these are “rock-basons, circles, stones erect, remains of Cromlêh’s, Karns, a grove of Oaks, a cave, and an enclosure” (pp. 116, 120). Thomas Pennant, in his Journey to Snowden (London, 1781), writes that his fellow-traveller climbed a local hill “on whose summit was a circular coronet of rude peppley stones . . . with an entrance to the east, or rising sun” (p. 63).23\n\nJerusalem shows “the Divine Vision like a Silent Sun”\n\n. . . setting behind the Gardens of Kensington\n\nOn Tyburns River, in clouds of blood, where was mild Zion Hills\n\nMost ancient promontory, and in the Sun, a Human Form appeared\n\n(43[29].2-4)\n\n“Zion Hills most ancient promontory” is a formula which appears twice elsewhere in Jerusalem. Plate 12 asks after the burying-place of Etinthus and suggests in further questions,\n\n. . . near Tyburns fatal Tree? is that\n\nMild Zion hills most ancient promontory; near mournful\n\nEver weeping Paddington? is that Calvary and Golgotha?\n\n(12.26-28)24\n\nThis is glossed by 27.25ff where “ever-weeping Paddington” is identified as “that mighty Ruin / Where Satan the first victory won” (my italics), where also “the Druids” made “Offerings of Human Life.” The general reference is to Tyburn, London’s place of public hangings from as early as 1196 until 1783. By the time they were discontinued, Blake was twenty-six and undoubtedly all too aware of the eager crowds that appeared for each of the eight public hanging-days—indeed, tradition made these public holidays for all journeymen.25 A “Paddington Fair” was a public execution, so called because Tyburn was less than a mile from the village of Paddington,26 in whose parish it was eventually included. There is a visionary continuity joining the Druid monuments, Calvary, and Tyburn: Druid human sacrifices “generally consisted of such criminals as were convicted of theft, or any capital crime” (Borlase, p. 121) and Calvary—as the crucifixion of two thieves with Jesus suggests—was, like Tyburn, a site for the execution of common criminals.\n\nI am suggesting that the passage from plate 12 of Jerusalem quoted above answers itself: Mild Zion hills most ancient promontory is Tyburn’s fatal Tree (“that” of 1.26). Not because it had particular elevation (it is a mountain of the mind, a mounting of the scaffold), but because it possessed all the attributes of Calvary, succinctly re-summarized by Richard Cumberland in his long poem, Calvary; or the Death of Christ (London, 1792): “Without the city wall there was a mount / Call’d begin page 201 | ↑ back to top CALVARY: The common grave it was / Of malefactors” (VI. 440-42). According to one authority the Tyburn gallows was in fact situated “on a small eminence at the corner of Edgeware-Road,”27 which road, together with Park Lane was as late as 1806 the western limit of London’s urbanization and the location of one of its “gates,” the Tyburn Turnpike.28 Lucas van Leyden’s engraving of Calvary shows just how small an eminence can make a mount, or promontory (illus. 1), and Sterne probably reflects the general conception when he has Tristram remark that an altar over sixty feet high would have “been as high as mount Calvary itself” (Tristram Shandy, VII, 5). Blake described his residence at South Molton Street—just blocks down Oxford Street from the old gallows—as located on “Calvarys foot / Where the Victims were preparing for Sacrifice” (M 4.21-22). Significant also was the very instrument of execution. Tyburn Tree was not a gibbet; rather, “The scaffold consisted of three posts, ten or twelve feet high, held apart by three connecting cross-bars at the top.”29 It was, in effect, a ruined version of a Druidic temple made of trilithons—one of the far-fetched hypotheses about\n\nStonehenge was that it had served as a monumental gallows. In Jerusalem, plate 80, Vala attempts to “weave Jerusalem a body” or “A Dragon form on Zion Hills most ancient promontory”: the “form” is that of the Druidic “Dragon Temples” (J 25.4, 47.6).\n\nThese motifs are illustrated at the bottom of Milton, plate 4 (illus. 3); there a rock-skull emerges from the ground, overshadowed by three trilithons on a mount, reminiscent of the three crosses on Calvary (note Blake’s reference to Calvary on the same plate, quoted above), while on the right the three seem to have joined into a threefold trilithon which suggests a Druid form of the Tyburn gallows.30 One might note also how directly above this structure a spindle or body hangs on high from the end of the line held by one of Blake’s spinner-Goddesses. The rock-skull identifies this scene as Calvary or Golgotha, “which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull” (Mk. 15:22, inter al.). This theme is further developed in Jerusalem, plate 28, where Albion “sat by Tyburns brook, and underneath his heel shot up! / A deadly Tree, he nam’d it Moral Virtue” (14-15)—the “Tree” here joins the cross, Tyburn Tree (cf. OED, s.v. “tree,” B. 4a,b), and the Tree of Good and Evil, complete with a Serpentine form at its base.31 Tyburn, then, is Zion Hills promontory, “most ancient” because all things begin in Albion and this is “‘the most ancient promontory’ of sacrifice” (Erdman, Prophet, p. 475), “the summit of the cosmic mountain and at the same time the place where Adam had been created and buried. Thus the blood of the Saviour falls upon Adam’s skull, buried precisely at the foot of the Cross, and redeems him”32 (illus. 4). The use of the word “promontory,” as Tolley notes, is singular—it serves perhaps to bring in several associations. The promontory is a visionary scene (like the Atlantic mountains of America), a “head-land” offering a vista on the Sea of Time and Space (cf. 3 Henry VI, III. ii. 134-36); it is the sterile earth to which Hamlet equates it (II. ii. 311); and finally, it is the covering of the fallen mind: in Paradise Lost the angelic host defeats the rebels and “on their[e] heads / Main Promontories flung” (6.653-54; cf. J. 71.55 cited below). Ultimately the most ancient promontory is the reader’s skull (Golgotha/Golgonooza), “Once open to the heavens and elevated on the human neck” (Eur 10.28), but now imagining and enclosing all these mountains of and in the mind.\n\nLos, who is himself an ancient Briton, reaches back to the unfallen state of the mountain imagery, praying “O Divine Saviour arise / Upon the Mountains of Albion as in ancient time”[e] (J 44[30].21-22). This image, together with the evocation of “those feet in ancient time / . . . upon Englands mountains green” (M 1), recalls the twice-repeated Biblical praise, “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace” (Is. 52:7, Nah. 1:15). Considering the plate geology of relief etching, one could say that Blake’s message also is published on the mountains. The finale of Jerusalem presents a vision of “the Sun in heavy clouds / Struggling[e] to rise above the Mountains” (95.11-12): a struggle, perhaps, because mountains are the “risings” of the earth, the objects of increasing Romantic adoration. begin page 202 | ↑ back to top\n\nbegin page 203 | ↑ back to top That Sun will rise over different mountains, the natural ones being removed and cast into the sea by faith and “firm perswasion” in imagination (MHH 12; cf. Mt. 21:21). Once and though at present “Jerusalem lies in ruins: / Above the Mountains of Albion, above the head of Los” (J 71.54-55), in the words of Isaiah, “it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it” (2:2)."
