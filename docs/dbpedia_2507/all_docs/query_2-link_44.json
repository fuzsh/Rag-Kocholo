        "text": "The Institute for Justice (IJ) is a libertarian public interest law firm that pursues constitutional litigation in support of free-market ideals, school choice, free speech, and private property rights. IJ also runs advocacy programs, research initiatives, and trainings to promote free-market economic policy.\n\nFounded in 1991, IJ has litigated over 290 cases, including eight before the United States Supreme Court. IJ has won all but one of its Supreme Court cases, losing the controversial case of Kelo v. New London which sparked restrictions to state-level eminent domain powers in 45 states across the country. IJ has litigated some of the most influential cases of the 21st century, including Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, a landmark school choice decision; Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, a decision that prevented religious discrimination in publicly-funded scholarship programs; and Timbs v. Indiana, a case which applied the Eighth Amendment protection against excessive fines to state criminal charges. IJ has filed several cases across the United States to challenge the constitutionality of civil asset forfeiture, a practice under which police departments may seize property allegedly implicated in criminal activities without first securing a criminal conviction.\n\nIJ has received funding from a number of right-of-center donors and organizations since its founding, including Richard Uihlein, the Dunn’s Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and Donors Trust. The traditionally left-of-center Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has also contributed to IJ.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1991, libertarian activist and former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation Chip Mellor and current Arizona Supreme Court Judge Clint Bolick founded Institute for Justice with an initial $350,000 from Charles Koch’s private foundation, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. Mellor and Bolick founded the organization to represent individuals, often from low-income backgrounds, in constitutional rights cases.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, IJ grew and won cases on behalf of small businesses across the United States, mostly focused on repealing economic regulations and occupational licensing regulations. IJ won its first Supreme Court case in 2002 when it represented the plaintiffs in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, a landmark case for the school-choice movement, in which the Court held that government-funded school vouchers could be used to pay for tuition at private, religiously affiliated schools.\n\nSince its founding, IJ has litigated over 290 cases, winning 75% of them. IJ also reports having won 155 pro-market legislative reforms. Today, the firm maintains seven offices across the United States, with its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nLitigation\n\nIJ works primarily through constitutional litigation, particularly on issues of private property rights, free speech, school choice, and economic freedom. IJ has argued eight cases before the United States Supreme Court, winning all but one. IJ has also filed dozens of amicus briefs in cases that have similar issue focuses.\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nIn late summer 2020, IJ launched a Project on Immunity and Accountability, a project aligned with left-of-center calls to overturn qualified immunity, which grants law enforcement officers immunity from civil suits in most cases. So far, IJ has filed amicus briefs in seven cases in an attempt to end qualified immunity, in addition to bringing four lawsuits of its own. IJ argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in November 2020, seeking an end to qualified immunity in the case of Brownback v. King. The case has not been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court as of January 21, 2021.\n\nEconomic Freedom\n\nIJ has brought several cases to United States federal courts to expand access to the free market. In February 2000, IJ filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in Swedenburg v. Kelly, challenging provisions that barred individuals from purchasing wine online from out-of-state vineyards. IJ challenged such laws in Michigan and New York, arguing that they violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of IJ’s clients in May of 2005.\n\nIn June 2019, the Supreme Court again ruled in favor of IJ clients in Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas. IJ challenged the state’s two-year residency requirements for individuals seeking liquor licenses, claiming again that it violated the Commerce Clause.\n\nSchool Choice\n\nIJ has won several school-choice cases at the state and federal level. In June 2002, IJ represented the defendants in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program. The program allowed children from low-income, inner-city families to attend private schools of their parents’ choosing, rather than public schools, using public funding. Teachers’ unions and other school choice opponents sued in an attempt to dismantle the program, but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of IJ in the firm’s first Supreme Court case.\n\nIn June of 2020, the Supreme Court once again ruled in favor of IJ’s clients in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue.\n\nIJ has used the Espinoza precedent to file new lawsuits in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire to challenge state laws around “town tuitioning,” which allow students living in towns without public schools to attend any private or public school of their choice using taxpayer funding, except for religious institutions. IJ filed the lawsuits in September 2020, and the cases had not been heard as of January 2021.\n\nIJ has also blocked legal challenges to school choice programs, including a 2011 challenge to the Arizona Individual Scholarship Tax Credit program that allowed taxpayers to donate to scholarship organizations, in exchange for a tax credit, that then provided private education scholarships to Arizona families.\n\nPrivate Property Rights\n\nIn 2005, IJ represented the plaintiffs in Kelo v. New London, one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions of the 21st century. IJ sued on behalf of 15 residential property owners in New London, Connecticut after the City of New London sought to seize their private homes and transfer them to a new private owner, ostensibly to increase economic development within the city. IJ argued that the measure violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which states that the government may only take private property for “public use.”\n\nAfter a lengthy court battle, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against IJ, claiming in a 5-4 decision that almost any potential public benefit qualifies as “public use.” The decision resulted in public outrage, with 45 states responding to the decision by enacting eminent domain reform laws in response. After retiring, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens admitted in a 2019 memoir that he had misinterpreted the legal precedent for Kelo. Kelo v. New London remains the only Supreme Court case that IJ has lost.\n\nExcessive Fines\n\nMore recently, IJ has pursued litigation against government-imposed excessive fines, winning the case of Timbs v. Indiana before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019. After Tyson Timbs pleaded guilty to a drug crime in Indiana, the state seized his $42,000 vehicle. IJ sued, claiming that the fine violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which bars excessive fines, because the maximum fine for Timbs’s offense was $10,000. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in February of 2019 that the Eighth Amendment applied to all state criminal convictions, not just federal convictions, making excessive fines at the state level a constitutional violation.\n\nCivil Asset Forfeiture\n\nIJ has opposed civil asset forfeiture, a process by which law enforcement agencies can seize property before filing criminal charges against an individual if they suspect the property has been involved in crime. IJ has criticized the practice as providing a financial incentive for police officers to seize private property, given that law enforcement agencies receive all or part of the value of the seized assets. In December 2020, IJ published a report entitled “Policing for Profit: The Abuse of Civil Asset Forfeitures,” arguing that states and the federal government have taken $68.8 billion in private property in the last 20 years.\n\nIJ won a civil asset forfeiture case in South Carolina in 2020, which ruled that South Carolina forfeiture laws violated both the Fifth Amendment guarantee to due process and the Eighth Amendment guarantee to be free of excessive fines. The state has appealed the case, and it had not yet been decided as of January 2021.\n\nIn December of 2020, IJ launched a federal class-action lawsuit against the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the federal government for seizing large amounts of cash from air travelers, despite there being no legal limits on the amount of cash individuals can carry on domestic flights.\n\nThat same month, IJ filed an appeal with the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Gerardo Serrano, a U.S. citizen whose truck was seized by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) while visiting family in Mexico. Serrano waited two years without a hearing to get his truck back, and CBP returned the truck one month after IJ filed a lawsuit in 2017. IJ’s Supreme Court appeal has alleged that the seizure violated the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process by holding Serrano’s property without a trial or hearing. A federal judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit have ruled against Serrano, and the case has not been taken before the U.S. Supreme Court as of January 2021.\n\nIJ has led litigation on local eminent domain, civil asset forfeiture, and excessive fines cases around the United States and has nearly 30 cases pending as of January 2021.\n\nFree Speech\n\nIJ has worked on free speech cases, with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of IJ clients in Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. Bennett in June of 2011. IJ filed on behalf of the plaintiffs to strike down the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, which offered public funding to candidates who agreed to limit personal spending to $500, participate in a debate, and return all unspent money. The law also allowed candidates to receive increased funding based on how much funding was raised by their privately financed opponents.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the law violated the First Amendment rights of candidates who chose to raise private money, ruling in favor of IJ’s clients.\n\nLegislative and Grassroots Advocacy Work\n\nIn addition to litigation, IJ takes on legislative and grassroots advocacy projects across the country to advocate for free market policies regarding private property and occupational licensing reform. IJ has fought in several states across the country to remove barriers to market access, such as removing occupational licensing requirements for hair braiding, home care, interior design, and talk therapy, and removing restaurant-backed restrictions on food truck services.\n\nIn 2017, IJ released the second edition of its “License to Work” report, detailing burdensome occupational licensing laws across the country. The report recommends repealing licensing requirements in all industries in which there is not a direct threat to the public in the absence of regulations. In 2020, the IJ released its “Barred from Working” report, arguing that former convicts also should not be barred from obtaining occupational licenses. IJ has worked to repeal such laws across the country, succeeding in Ohio and Washington, D.C. in January of 2021.\n\nIn the private property space, IJ has frequently advocated against government abuse of eminent domain, especially for so-called “redevelopment” projects in which states seize private property on the grounds of eminent domain to sell it to private developers. IJ has challenged such projects in California, Missouri, and Indiana.\n\nIn addition to advocacy work, IJ frequently publishes research reports in its core policy areas, while also supporting clinics and conferences on entrepreneurship and economic liberty. IJ has also made grants to a number of right-of-center organizations, providing grants to the State Policy Network (SPN) and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in 2019.\n\nPeople and Funding\n\nWilliam “Chip” Mellor has worked as chairman and general counsel of IJ since he founded the organization in 1991. Under Mellor’s guidance, IJ won four Supreme Court cases. Before working at IJ, Mellor worked as president of the right-of-center Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy and worked in the Reagan administration as Deputy General Counsel for Legislation and Regulations in the Department of Energy.\n\nIn 2019, IJ reported $24,164,577 in revenue, over $21 million of which came from contributions and grants. IJ also reported $90,872,807 in net assets. While IJ was founded with an initial $350,000 donation from Charles Koch, it has been credited by even the left-leaning New York Times for not soliciting money from corporate partners, and no individual donor provides more than eight percent of IJ’s budget in a given year."
