        "text": "Timbs History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nWhile many of Irish names are quite familiar to most, their original Gaelic forms are often forgotten and mysterious. The original Gaelic form of the name Timbs is Ã“ Tuama.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Timbs family\n\nThe surname Timbs was first found in County Cork (Irish: Corcaigh) the ancient Kingdom of Deis Muin (Desmond), located on the southwest coast of Ireland in the province of Munster, where they held a family seat from very ancient times. This ancient family name was descended from Tuaim Snama, an eighth century King of Osraigi, and were presumably of Dalcassian origin. They were descended through Mathghamhain, the brother of Brian Boru. Although this tribe of Toomey held a family seat in Cork in the 14th century, they are believed to be descended from the Dal Cais to the north.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Timbs family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Timbs research. Another 161 words (12 lines of text) covering the years 1478, 1603, 1640, 1653, 1659, 1676, 1702, 1706 and 1730 are included under the topic Early Timbs History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nTimbs Spelling Variations\n\nThe scribes and church officials of the Middle Ages who recorded names in official documents spelled the names as they sounded. This led to the problem of one name being recorded under several different variations and thus resembling more than one person. Among the many spelling variations of the surname Timbs that are preserved in archival documents of this era include Toomie, O'Toomie, Twomey, O'Twomey, Twomy, O'Twomy, Twony, Toomey, O'Toomey, Toomy, O'Toomy, Twomie, O'Twomie, Twome, O'Twome, Toomee, O'Toomee, Tome, O'Tome, Thomey, O'Thomey, Thoume, O'Thoume, Thomey, O'Thomey, Tumey, O'Tumey, Tumee and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Timbs family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Timbs Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMigration of the Timbs family\n\nIreland experienced a dramatic decrease in its population during the late 19th century. This was in a great measure, a response to England's imperialistic policies. Hunger and disease took the lives of many Irish people and many more chose to leave their homeland to escape such hunger and disease. North America with its promise of work, freedom, and land was an extremely popular destination for Irish families. For those families that survived the journey, all three of these things were were often attained through much hard work and perseverance. Research into early immigration and passenger lists revealed many immigrants bearing the name Timbs: Elizabeth, Michael, and Jerry Twomey who settled in Boston Massachusetts in 1847; Jeremiah Twomay settled in Boston Massachusetts in 1850; Jeremiah Twomey settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1833.\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Timbs (post 1700) +\n\nKen Timbs (1951-2004), American professional wrestler, half of the tag team duo the Fabulous Blondes who completed in the early 1980s\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), English antiquarian, editor of the Mirror of Literature, the Harlequin, The Literary World, fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1834\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Timbs Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Fortis undis et armis\n\nMotto Translation: Waves and strong arms"
