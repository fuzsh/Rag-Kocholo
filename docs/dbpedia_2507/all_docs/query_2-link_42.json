I thought that was the Terje Rypdal (mid-70s) album; at\n\nleast CDEurope's catalogue listed TR's \"After The Rain\" as a Verve\n\nrelease. A few seconds ago, here's what CD-Europe's search engine found\n\nfor Rypdal:\n\nB185859 RYPDAL TERJE AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$26.95 ECM 6/95\n\nB226772 RYPDAL TERJE AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$29.95 ECM 6/95 HOLLAND\n\nH293783 RYPDAL TERJE AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$27.95 VERVE 6/95 GERMANY\n\nHowever, a search on the title shows that there are *many* albums of\n\nthat name, by Harold Danko, Michael Jones, \"Mie\" Kitabatake, Michel\n\nLegrand, Nelson, Red Dog, TR, Jack Tempkin and Seclusion, oh and yes,\n\nJohn McLaughlin:\n\nH289156 MCLAUGHLIN JOHN AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$27.95 5/95 GERMANY\n\nB310571 MCLAUGHLIN JOHN AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$28.95 POLYG 5/95\n\nB398446 MCLAUGHLIN JOHN AFTER THE RAIN\n\n$22.95 VERVE 5/95 HOLLAND\n\nCould cause some confusion, Bruce!\n\nAnd they haven't even listed Coltrane... nor Barry Guy's CD-EP...\n\nIn any case, Terje's AtR *is* being released on CD in the UK this week.\n\n(For considerably less than $26.95!

Thanks a lot. The playing with Sting is one of\n\nthe things I have been waiting for over the years as I have read many\n\ntimes how much Sting admires McLaughlin.\n\nAre you sure about two other facts? The new JM album certainly has\n\nnot been released in USA. (And it is July 18 as I write this). It is not\n\neven listed as an upcoming release. I was told through other pretty good\n\nsources that it won't be released until September. (It is currently\n\navailable in Canada and I have purchased it through the mail).\n\nSecondly, on the tour, and the source is from a band member, plans\n\nare currently under way for a tour.

Wish it weren't so...\n\nCan't imagine John saying that, though I *have* seen some over-\n\nenthusiastic audiences.\n\nMy wife and I saw him at a big club here in NYC. Standing room only\n\non a big dance floor. About 10 feet away an empty circle started\n\nwidening...Two guys--drunk on their asses--thought they were at a\n\nMotley Crue concert. No, they were just *serious* McLaughlin fans!\n\nMy wife and I were in stitches as they screamed 'BOOOOOGGGIIEE'!\n\nafter every tune. John stared from the stage in disbelief.\n\nAnyway, we're close friends with John's ex-chief-eng from Mahavishnu\n\nand he just roared when we told him about it. We all decided to go to\n\nsee John at a little club in NJ a while later. Imagine--they sat\n\nus in the front row with two very familiar looking gents!\n\nMy wife and I could barely contain ourselves...just waiting for the\n\nfirst chorus of \"GEEETTT ITTT JOHHHNNN!\" (heehee). The management\n\nfinally had to intervene. John seemed to think it quite humorous,\n\nI believe.\n\n>>\"...STOP THE PRESSES: Rumour has it that pivotal guitar genius Jeff Beck\n\n>>will appear on an upcoming album by pivotal guitar genius John\n\n>McLaughlin.\n\n>>We'll try to sit still in the meantime....\"\n\nI'm curious to hear this. Jeff's had trouble with his hearing, so\n\nhopefully all's well again. I once asked JM about his favorite\n\nelectric guitarists. I was fully expecting maybe 'Allan Holdsworth'\n\nor someone in a more jazz-oriented vein.. Maybe it was the moment,\n\nbut 'Jeff Beck' was the reply. I've wondered if in part it was the\n\ntour that the Mahavishnu Orch. did with Beck.\n\n>Jeff's touring with Santana this summer. Imagine if all three got\n\n>together...\n\nHard to pin down chemistry. I didn't think that the first McLaughlin/\n\nSantana album worked very well. Second time around, maybe.\n\nRegards,\n\nMark Garvin\n\nGreat stories and insight regarding over- zealous fans.\n\nIn about 1982, at the Bushnell Auditorium in Hartford, Ct I saw JM with\n\nthe Belo Horizonte band. (Always loved that band)! At any rate, if you\n\nremember, this was an acoustic band. There were plenty of quiet\n\nmoments...however, among the adoring fans was an obnoxious S.O.B. who kept\n\nscreaming out at the top of his lungs unintelligible rantings which in his\n\nobvious drug-induced state were apparently meant to be Sri Chinmoy\n\naphorisms of praise!\n\nAt any rate, it was maddening and went on for at least a half hour with\n\nnobody knowing what to do- including JM who just smiled in the direction\n\nof the sounds coming from the darkness. Finally, and I remember it so\n\nvividly, a fellow front-rower stood-up turned and yelled in the direction\n\nof our friend and said \"Hey, listen you asshole. Show some respect for\n\nthe crowd and the artist. We are here to enjoy the music\" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWith this, the crowd erupted into applause. The asshole never did open\n\nhis mouth again and JM played on.\n\nI am extremely jealous of anyone who has spoken with JM. Thanks for\n\nthe story.\n\nWjazzman\n\nWalter K\n\nsdura...@aol.com (SDuraybito) wrote:\n\n>>\"...STOP THE PRESSES: Rumour has it that pivotal guitar genius Jeff Beck\n\n>>will appear on an upcoming album by pivotal guitar genius John\n\n>McLaughlin.\n\n>>We'll try to sit still in the meantime....\"\n\nThis is an interesting \"tidbit.\" I saw Beck and McLaughlin in Dallas\n\ncirca 1975 (I saw so many concerts in the 70's I can't remember the\n\ndates--anyone care to speculate as to why?). It was around the time\n\nBeck released WIRED. I think McLaughlin opened. Anyway, at some\n\npoint in the show both were on stage for perhaps 30 - 45 minutes.\n\nNow THAT was something to behold....\n\nThere are many extraordinary guitarists so it's difficult to say who's\n\n\"best\" or \"fastest\" or \"most talented.\" But by anyone's standard,\n\nMcLaughlin ranks among the best. I recall (don't still have the\n\nalbum) listening to \"Between Nothingness and Eternity\" and being\n\namazed at how fast and crisp JM played. Some \"fast\" guitarists move\n\nthe pick faster than their fingers and end up with a somewhat \"muddy\"\n\nsound. JM leaves 'em in the dust.\n\nAs an aside, I was listening to an old James Taylor album, \"One Man\n\nDog,\" which contains a cut written by McLaughlin titled \"Someone.\" JM\n\nplays acoustic - and if you didn't know it was him, you'd think JT is\n\nsomewhat \"underrated.\" <g>\n\nTANSTAAFL!\n\nMark\n\nmga...@panix.com (Mark Garvin) wrote:\n\n>Hard to pin down chemistry. I didn't think that the first McLaughlin/\n\n>Santana album worked very well. Second time around, maybe.\n\nI liked Love Devotion Surrender but did think it was a different album\n\nthan either would have done separately. So Mahavishnu fans didn't get\n\na new Mahavishnu record, and Santana fans didn't get a new Santana\n\nrecord. Most, if not all, of the people I knew back when it was\n\nreleased did dig it, however.\n\nSome months back, I picked up John McLaughlin/Carlos Santana Recorded\n\nLive in Chicago 1974 on Jazz Door JD 1250 with Larry Young-org, Doug\n\nRauch-b, Armando Peraza-perc, and Billy Cobham-d. The tracks are Flame\n\nSky (20:04), Naima (15:46), The Live (sic) Divine (20:08), and A Love\n\nSupreme (19:30). The minimal liner notes are in German, and the\n\nrecording is more or less bootleg quality. Musically, though, the\n\nperformance is top-notch and recommended for anyone who like LDS.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes a long time to play like yourself.\"\n\nMiles Davis\n\nRegarding overzealous fans:\n\nI saw the Mahavishnu Orchestra \"Apocalypse\" tour back in '74. The show\n\nopened with the band standing on stage for about a minute of silence\n\nbefore the music commenced. Unfortunately, the minute was filled by the\n\nsounds of the fellow standing next to me, who was screaming something\n\nalong the lines of \"Hey Johnny McLaughlin, we got your records at home!\n\nLet's rock buddy! Parrrty!\" He then began to puke, spewing forth vomit\n\non everyone in his immediate area. I got it in the leg. Then he passed\n\nout.\n\nMichael Walden then hit the gong, and the music began.\n\nSo McLaughlin has had to deal with these problems for at least 20 years.\n\nIs it something in his music that brings out the rowdies? I've never been\n\npuked on at a rock concert...\n\nIn article <3uumjq$s...@nntp.ucs.ubc.ca> John Cody <joh...@unixg.ubc.ca> writes:\n\n>So McLaughlin has had to deal with these problems for at least 20 years.\n\n>Is it something in his music that brings out the rowdies? I've never been\n\n>puked on at a rock concert...\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Dan Quayle paid a visit to\n\nPortland, OR, where I happened to be visiting friends. Some\n\nof the local citizenry were rather exercised about these\n\n\"official state visits\" because the taxpayers in Portland\n\nwere footing the cost for the losers' fund-raising and politicking\n\ntherein.\n\nSo as Danny-Boy stepped out of his limo and proceeded down the\n\nred carpet, one group of protesters downed bottles of Epicac\n\n(a powerful emetic) that they had earlier mixed with red, white,\n\nand blue food coloring. As Danny passed in front of them, they\n\npuked Uncle Sam's favorite colors all over the street. I was\n\nvey impressed, to say the least, and for a time considered\n\nrelocating to Portland. Unfortunately, they hate people from\n\nCalifornia even more than they hated bush/quayle, so I\n\nsquelched that idea.\n\nre: overzealous fans.\n\nAt the Mcl., Delucia, DiMeola concert at Carnegie Hall, an intensely\n\nannoying dude , obviously with pharmaceutical aid, kept yelling out\n\n'SPACE ROCKERS!!!!' whenever a fast lick was played. As you can imagine,\n\nthis was quite often. This was fifth row center, mind you, with Al D's\n\nparents sitting right behind. I'm surprised they didn't bonk the guy\n\nover the head.\n\nbtw, I did get to talk to McLaughlin very briefly, after he played this\n\nMediterranean Concerto in Michigan.
