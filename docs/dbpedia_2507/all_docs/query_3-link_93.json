        "text": "Lisa Timbs is a pianist with over 20 years of experience as accompanist and soloist. Once referred to by John Rutter as ‘golden fingers,’ she has a reputation for being a supportive and intuitive musician. She maintains the highest level of professionalism whether accompanying a student for their first exam, playing for an award-winning choir on stage at The Royal Festival Hall, featuring as soloist at prestigious functions, or in her innovative project Musitiquity, where she uses music and replica clothing to bring history to life.\n\nWelcome to her website where you can discover more about her musical background in the biography section, explore the varied strands that make up her musical career in the soloist and accompanist pages and in particular find out why she is called ‘The Square Pianist’ by clicking on the Musitiquity menu.\n\nIf you have an interest in history and period clothing as well as music, there is much of interest to be found in the individual Musitiquity pages and even the opportunity to buy historically accurate fashion items hand made by Lisa in ‘Miss Benford’s Emporium’, a little shop of treasures named in honour of her grandmother, herself an accomplished pianist and milliner.\n\nWe hope you will bookmark ‘The Square Pianist’ and return to read some of Lisa’s articles in the blog pages, about all manner of topics relating to life as a musician, the background to some of the events she is involved with, both past and present, plus insights into the inspirations and passions that sustain her."
