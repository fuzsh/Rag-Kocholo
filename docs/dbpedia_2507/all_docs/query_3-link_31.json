        "text": "A little knowledge about her real life protagonist, writes Leeanne O'Donnell, was just enough\n\nSparks of Bright Matter is set in 18th-century London and rural county Cork in Ireland. It weaves historical fact with fiction and follows the fortunes of a character based on a real-life Irishman known as the 'The Last True Alchemist'.\n\nPeter Woulfe lived in Barnards Inn, Holborn during the second half of the 18th century. I started developing a fictional character around him while knowing very little. The things I did know were intriguing. He was a respected scientist, a Fellow of the Royal Society, but behind the closed doors of his immensely cluttered rooms he was secretly seeking the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nReading John Timbs' English Eccentrics and Eccentricities provided me with some delicious nuggets of information. After Woulfe died it was discovered that he had written messages to the angels asking for help and attached them to his scientific equipment. Timbs tells us that Woulfe 'vainly searched for the elixir' and believed that he could not produce it because he had not performed enough 'pious acts'. He sometimes invited a select few guests to breakfast in his rooms at 4am, with admittance by secret handshake. The rooms were so chaotic that a visitor once put down his hat and never found it again.\n\nDiscovering these things about real life Peter Woulfe and his eccentricities was the perfect springboard for me into an imaginative extravaganza. As it turned out, it was just about the right amount of information to stimulate, but not fetter, my imagination.\n\nMy fictional Peter Woulfe is torn between magical thinking and rational thought. He seeks enlightenment and the Philosophers Stone, but instead falls in love with a fascinating will-o-the -wisp called Sukie, gets completely diverted by lust, and ends up embroiled in a dangerous Jacobite plot.\n\nWoulfe had complex, contradictory aspects to his character, and his mind was often on higher matters - but what was his day-to-day life in Georgian London like? What about the corporeal reality of life at the time ? The food, the smells, the sounds? How did these things exist in the life of someone who was busy trying to communicate with angels?\n\nA bit of research into the nitty-gritty of Georgian London started to bring everything to life in my mind. There was dirt, there was sickness, sex was for sale everywhere. Contemporary accounts tell of travellers straying off the beaten track and being accosted repeatedly and insistently by sex workers plying their trade.\n\nOnce I knew this, I understood what my characters had to navigate. What or whom might they have encountered on the way to breakfast at 4am in Barnards Inn? Seventeen-year-old Danby Scott, a fictional character, 'fresh up from Hertfordshire', meets several women of the night on his way to breakfast with Woulfe.\n\nAnother character, Nico, is a pawnbroker on Chick Lane. Some reading revealed the sheer amount of criminality in the area at the time and the way thieves and brokers were in delicate, mutually satisfactory dance. Some brokers would buy obviously stolen goods, others were more cautious. Surrounded by thieves, does Nico himself worry about being robbed ? Probably. So I have him shut the bedroom windows even on the hottest nights. This brought me into a scene where his wife's lover is trying to get into their bedroom one very hot summer night, but finds the windows tightly closed.\n\nFor me the research is a way to get more deeply into my characters' experiences, to access the sensory reality of their lives. The historical detail fascinates me and I want to get it right, but I also delight in the freedom to make things up, to play with what might have happened. To use the available facts to build a convincing world and then to let my imagination run riot.\n\nReal life Peter Woulfe was born in Co Clare. I took the liberty of transplanting him to west Cork, where I live, because I wanted to write about the magic of the landscape here and how that might have stimulated Woulfe's highly rational mind as well as his fervent belief in the other worldly. A real event - the great frost of 1739, when songbirds were said to have frozen in the air - was the entry point to his fictional life here. The temperature plunges dramatically overnight, and 14-year-old Peter walks out in the morning to visit the mysterious and magical Bridey Leary.\n\nIn writing Sparks I discovered that the accuracy of historical detail matters hugely; but if you want to make up something about someone who had a real, flesh and blood life, maybe you're better off not knowing too much. As my mother used to joke - you can't let the truth get in the way of a good story."
