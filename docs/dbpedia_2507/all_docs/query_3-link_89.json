        "text": "The Hummums. In the south-east corner of the [Covent Garden] market-place, and occupying that portion which was destroyed by fire, are two hotels, known by the strange names of the \"Old Hummums\" and the \"New Hummums.\" The name is a corruption of the Eastern word \"Humoum.\" Mr. Wright, in his \"History of Domestic Manners of England,\" says, \"Among the customs introduced from Italy was the hot sweating bath, which, under the name of the hothouse, became widely known in England for a considerable time.\" Sweating in those hot-houses is spoken of by Ben Jonson; and in the old play of The Puritan, a character, speaking of some laborious undertaking, says, \"Marry, it will take me much sweat; 'twere better to go to sixteen hot-houses.\" These \"Hummums,\" however, when established in London, seem to have been mostly frequented by women of doubtful repute, and they became, as in the East, favourite rendezvous for gossip and company of not the most moral kind. They soon came to be used for the purposes of intrigue, and this circumstance gradually led to their suppression.\n\nThe \"Old Hummums\" was the scene of what Dr. Johnson pronounced the best accredited ghoststory that he had ever heard. The individual whose ghost was said to have appeared here in a supernatural manner was a Mr. Ford, a relation or connection of the learned doctor, and said to have been the riotous parson of Hogarth's \"Midnight Modern Conversations.\" The story is told at full length by Boswell, and we need not repeat it here.\n\nThe Hummums. The site now occupied by Russell Chambers and the west end of the Flower Market is approximately that originally occupied by four portico houses and a house in Russell Street.\n\nThe four portico houses had each occupied two bays of the 'Little' Piazza. The site of the most northerly, No. 1 Little Piazza (together with that of No. 11 Russell Street) had originally been let to Thomas Barnes, carpenter, for thirty-seven years from 1636.1 This corner house must have been badly constructed for towards the end of Barnes's term, in 1670, it suddenly collapsed, dragging with it the adjacent portico house.2 The latter house, which was then tenanted by the Swedish Resident,3 had been built under a lease granted to Edmond Keyser, ironmonger, in 1637.4 The two houses and the adjoining one on the south, which had also been severely damaged, were rebuilt and re-occupied by 1672.3\n\nThe house on the south side of Keyser's and the surviving end house of the row had been built at the expense of George Hulbert who in 1633 had been granted a lease of a large plot, lying between the Piazza and Charles Street, for the exceptionally long term of fifty years. Hulbert had also erected three houses fronting Charles Street on the same plot.5\n\nIn 1681, shortly before Hulbert's lease expired, a new lease was granted to Henry Harris of both portico buildings and one of the back houses in Charles Street. Harris had been persuaded to obtain the lease by Richard Lasinby, 'chirurgeon', in order to establish a 'hummums' or 'bagnio'. From his personal observation at Aleppo in Turkey Lasinby claimed a knowledge of the methods used to construct rooms 'for Sweating and Bathing' and proceeded to spend a great sum on building baths, probably at the rear of the northern of the two houses let to Harris. Harris later asserted that Lasinby was 'very ignorant' about the subject, however, and that he himself had had to redesign the baths. In any event they were completed by August 1683 and proved very popular, being among the earliest Turkish baths, though not the first, to be opened in London.6 On an undated plan of Covent Garden, which is roughly contemporary with the establishment of Lasinby's Hummums (Plate 4), the house is marked with the words 'Piazza Tav[ern]'.7\n\nAfter Richard Lasinby's death the baths were managed by his son, another Richard, until he died in 1693. The business was then continued by the latter's widow and, after her remarriage, by her husband, John Groscourt.8 An advertisement of 1701, announcing a change of ownership, gave notice that the baths had been 're-fitted' so that 'persons may Sweat and Bathe in the cleanliest and be Cupp'd after the newest manner'. The Hummums also provided 'good lodging for any persons who shall desire to lodge there all night... The price, as was always, for Sweating and Bathing is 5s 6d. For two in a room, 8s.; but who lodges there all night, 10s.'9\n\nIn 1704 a new lease of the Hummums, together with the house on the south and the one in Charles Street, was granted to Dr. John Colbatch, a physician, who covenanted not to annoy his neighbours with 'Smoak or any noisome or stinking Savors'.10 Colbatch was succeeded by William Boen who was granted a lease of the Hummums only in 1723.11 Boen assigned his lease in about 1739 to John Rigg3 and in 1748 Rigg was granted a lease of the Hummums together with the houses formerly let to Colbatch.12 An advertisement by Rigg 'Cupper at the Hummums in the Little Piazza ... with a back door from Charles Street' invited gentlemen to visit his establishment for 'Lodging, Sweating, Bathing, or Cupping'; ladies were also admitted, and treated 'with great care and proper attendance', but they were not permitted to lodge there.13 John Rigg was succeeded by John Henry Rigg who was still the proprietor when the Hummums was destroyed by fire in 1769.14\n\nThe fire occurred in the morning of 20 March in the premises of John Bradley, a distiller.15 Bradley had since 1732 occupied No. 11 Russell Street, adjacent to the corner portico building. In 1747 he also became the tenant of the corner portico building, which had a shop in the ground floor, and in 1750 he became the lessee of this and the adjoining portico building on the south.16 The fire broke out in Bradley's distilling-house, under apartments occupied by Richard Vincent, a musician. It spread to Bradley's shop on the corner, to his house in Russell Street and to the house next door, formerly occupied by Daniel Button but then by a cheesemonger; the fire also spread southwards as far as the Bedford Arms Tavern in Tavistock Row, destroying 'Mr. Lovejoy's bagnio', the Hummums, and two peruke-makers' premises. The whole front of the Little Piazza fell down 'with the most terrible concussion'.15 Lovejoy's Bagnio was situated in the house between the corner portico building and Rigg's Hummums and extended over Bradley's shop.17) The two peruke-makers were probably in the southernmost house of the four."
