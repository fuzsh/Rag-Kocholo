        "text": "1.\n\nHorsefeathers 03:49\n\nHorsefeathers Don’t you hear your mama calling you, calling back home again? You’ve been rattling ‘round in the lost and found with your same old redneck friends. But good times come and good times go but sooner or later they’ll leave you cold, If you can’t leave them alone. Are you sitting on that mountain top watching your domain Go up in flames, it’s going up in flames. Can’t you feel that wind a-blowin’ , it’s blowing like a hurricane. Can’t you see the signs and omens just oozing out of everything. You’re putting together a horse with feathers But that contraption wont take wing. There’s a city on that mountain top but you aint gonna find No one inside who’s still alive. Don’t you know just what you’re knowing and no body can tell you different now And don’t you see what’s clearly showing, don’t you hear what’s screaming out? Are you sitting on your mountain top counting your remains And circling ‘round the drain and waiting out the days.\n\n2.\n\nDont Worry 03:48\n\nDon’t Worry My love, don’t worry. Your mind is in a hurry to know what’s going on. My dear, sweet lovely, time flies and it’s coming much faster than before. Thoughts are turning over, rolling over, spinning over in that head of yours You want to run for cover, make’s you wonder if there’s anything you know for sure. Doing what they told you, doing what the doctor ordered is it ever enough? Is it a little comfort, does it mean a thing to know that you have my love, my love. Oh my fair lady, I see us both past eighty taking up the rocking chairs. And that’s all that I’m wanting, from dusk until the dawning filling up our dreams. Life is boiling over, yes it’s rolling like a boulder through this place you know. I want to bring it closer, want to feel it all until my heart explodes. Did I tell you that I love you did I tell you that I need you, do I say it enough? Can you take a little comfort if I tell you once again that you have my love, my love We fit like a glove, we’ve got more than enough, my love so don’t worry. ~solo over verse~ thoughts are turning over, rolling over, spinning over in that head of yours you want to run for cover, makes you wonder if there’s anything you know for sure. Did I tell you that I love you, did I tell you that I need you, can I say it enough? Is it a little comfort, does it mean a thing to know that you have my love? My love, my love, my love, my love, don’t worry.\n\n3.\n\nLoved To Pieces 03:00\n\nLoved To Pieces I used to see her out. Dressed up and talking down She takes the long way home. She takes those switchback roads I see her as she goes. Headlights on my window. Lost in the woods outside a city of waste and ruin Where she and me were loved to pieces Everything has got to mean something. Living for all or none can make you cut and run. But if you want to salvage some, you’ll take whatever comes. You’ll wake up from that cloudy dream And you wont know what to think. She said you’ll start again. She said you’ve got your friends to turn to. Fall where you stood inside a city of steel and mud And I think you should stop trying to figure out what can’t be understood. For me and she were loved to pieces. Everything don’t have to mean something.\n\n4.\n\nMent To Be Apart 03:21\n\nMeant To Be Apart You took a lethal dose and I’ve got the antidote But I don’t want to tell you so and you don’t want to know. Your lock might take my key but you wont get that from me ‘cause there just aint no sympathy between us anymore. (1st chorus) So long ago our love was something strong Long before everything just went all wrong We nailed our hearts back together just in time to figure out That we were meant to be apart. I needed you back then, I needed your rolling pin To beat me down and stretch me thin and build me up once more. But you needed something too, you needed a talking to But I wouldn’t say a word to you so how could you have known? (2nd chorus) Long ago our house was still a home Now they’ve boarded up the windows and the doors. We locked our hearts inside together just in time to figure out that we were meant to be apart. When we parted were you broken hearted or did you breathe a sigh of relief? Love is blind and deaf and mindless and you wont ever teach it how to think. So, you told me where to go and you took me there and so I had to walk back home with all my things in tow. ‘cause we took a lethal dose and there aint no antidote so we just have to let it go that’s all I know for sure. (repeat 1st chorus)\n\n5.\n\nTrophy Wife 04:01\n\nTrophy Wife I know you love me for my money. You know that I don’t really care. We go together just like charities and millionaires I know you want me when it’s sunny. You always leave me in the rain I say that you’re the thief of hearts, you swear that I am Jesse James But I’d never hurt you pretty baby. I’d never want to cause you pain. But sometimes your grip can leave a mark and it’s spelling out your name you stare so deep into my eyes it leaves a tattoo on my brain (chorus) and I want to know if just my money alone could buy your love. Could it buy your love? And I want to see just how much bribery would be enough Could it be enough? For you to spend your life as my trophy wife. I know you call me old and crazy. I know you take me for a fool. And I know the devil in your heart could make you sell the golden rule. But you couldn’t hurt me pretty baby. You couldn’t ever cause me pain. No matter what you do to me, you know I’ll always feel the same Just when I think I’ve lost the fire you’re stoking up my flame. (repeat chorus) (bridge) don’t act like it never crossed you mind. Don’t act offended or pretend to be surprised. ‘cause everything could turn out to be just fine and we could do some business if that’s the way it’s got to be, well, alright. Don’t break my heart now pretty baby. This is a game that you could win. By now your grip has left a mark and it spells out your name. You stare so deep into my eyes it leaves a tattoo on my brain. (repeat chorus)\n\n6.\n\nMake You Love Me 03:45\n\nMake You Love Me Your eyes are like eyes, your lips are like lips Your fingertips are just like fingertips There are words to describe more poetic than this But looking at you now, I don’t remember them. ‘cause I’ve been out all night, trying to get myself right trying to prop up my convictions. And I’ve been thinking out loud, in the smoke and the crush of the crowd and this is what I’m thinking. (1st chorus) And that’s that you and me were meant to be Each other’s one and only I know you don’t care for me but I’m gonna make you love me. My speech is slurred, my vision blurred, I look ridiculous and absurd But my mind is made and my thoughts are chained to one idea that can’t be moved or changed. (2nd chorus) And that’s that you and me were made to be Each other’s one and only I know you don’t care for me but I’m gonna make you love me. (bridge) you were laying fast asleep, I knocked upon your door my soul so willing, my flesh so weak can you take this much more? Your eyes are unkind, your lips are pressed thin Your words could crumple me like a piece of tin. I’m not much to look at, I’m not much to recommend But I’m gonna say until you let me in. (repeat 1st chorus)\n\n7.\n\nKingfisher 02:07\n\n8.\n\nOverlong 04:54\n\nOverlong Honey hung the moon in the sky for me And I can never forget. Just as the stars were closing up shop for the evening They stayed open ‘till we fell asleep You’re like the curve of the scenery, the ball of the earth You mean the world to me Remember times when I have underestimated it’s worth But now it’s everything. Heroes lay having died in defense of life, turning love into a myth You and I can turn it back to common sense, stupefied For too long my heart was wasted and it stayed alone for overlong A blues born in my heart awakens and come dark or fair, it’s always there and it’s happy to ruin everything It’s happy to ruin everything. But I’m happy it wont be bothering me again. We’ve been feeling fine in the shade where it’s lazy It almost makes you forget. In Technicolor streaming over from the ocean and the border What’s the story? Where’s the catch? Just like the swell of the strings beneath electric guitar A million whispers and a single scream There was a time when I didn’t even know who you were But I don’t remember that. Heroes ride off in magnified sunsets, still alive despite all horrible events You and I could put this theory to the test, given time. ‘cause you know my heart was wasted and it stayed alone for overlong a blues born in my heart is breaking now come dark or sad it wont be that bad.\n\n9.\n\nThe Little Things 04:28\n\nThe Little Things So god made it hard on the little things. They had to look up to everything They had to punch at the air while the world held them at arms length. Could not compete with the big galloots who had their big golden parachutes All bundled up in their big and tall suits and eating everything. Yes, god gave a little to the lesser things and dumped the rest on the higher beings They had it all in great quantity and would not let it go. They couldn’t find a place for all that stuff. They couldn’t build a palace big enough The little people tried to dream one up but they didn’t know what for Ground to dust, rise back up. Dear sweet little things, it tears my heart to shreds ~solo~ People make it better people make it worse, people can explain away the universe. But all those answers don’t account for much and we still do what we must Because god gave a little to the least of us. A little love and a little trust He really hoped we wouldn’t make a fuss, just get on that big bus Before we’re ground to dust, we rise on up Dear sweet little things, it tears my heart to shreds.\n\n10.\n\nEarl of Sandwich 02:17\n\nEarl of Sandwich He’s the Earl of Sandwich and he walks away down the oaken paneled hallway to the place of wine and port and humidors of paintings of great battles out at sea because he’s the Earl of Sandwich and his frame reclines into the fine upholstery and his hound sits beside his glass is running over and his heart opines Marry Me Genevieve! If not for love then for money alone Join me here in my lavish abode, If not for love then for money alone.\n\n11.\n\nIt’s Not How Good You Are They don’t give medals for self-inflicted wounds If they did, you’d have a chestful. You’d be welcomed home with a ticker tape parade By the others who had it all and threw it away. You can’t fake hurt, you can’t fake pain and now you wont have to. As your legs get kicked out from under you. And you grab at the ghosts that you think will save you. (1st chorus) just like children dream of impossible things like something they saw on a TV screen it don’t matter what you were taught to believe it’s not how good you are, it’s how good you seem to be. They don’t judge talent in this talent show They just push you out and see how far you can go. You can give your body, your soul your heart and your dreams And they’ll melt them down and us them to grease their machine (2nd Chorus) like a child might dream of impossible things. A hero dies and then rises again. It don’t matter what you were taught to believe It’s not how good you are, it’s how good you seem to be. I saw you at the foot of the stage. You were torn all to pieces, you had been rearranged. And you looked like a man with a lot to explain. And you looked like a kid who had grown up too late. (3rd chorus) like a child believes his impossible dream and wishes it over and over again. It don’t matter what you were taught to believe It’s not how good you are, it’s how good you seem to be."
