Born in Clerkenwell, London, he was apprenticed at 16 to a druggist and printer, where he soon showed great literary promise.

Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nA London Recluse: Mr. George Blamire\n\nSeclusion in a vast metropolis like London—that maelstrom of human affairs—is an anomalous state of existence, which is often set down by unthinking persons as madness; or at least, not sanity:\n\nThin partitions do their bounds divide.\n\nNevertheless, this phase of life has been enjoyed by persons of a reflective turn of mind, without being associated with selfishness, or caring nothing for the outside world, but loving,\n\nthrough the loopholes of retreat\n\nTo peep at such a world: to see the stir\n\nOf the great Babel, and not feel crowd.\n\nIn one of the fine houses of the Adelphi—No. 1, in Adam Street, the house in which lived Dr. Vicessimus Knox, the “British Essayist”—there died, in September 1863, a recluse of the better class, both as regards station and intellect, and whose sympathies were with the world, though he was, as it were, shut out from its stir. Such was Mr. George Blamire, son of Dr. Blamire, of Carlisle, a gentleman possessed of considerable property, and formerly a barrister. Mr. Blamire had, for nearly twenty years, lived in Adam Street, in almost total seclusion; no person, under any pretence whatever, being allowed to enter the three rooms in his occupation on the first floor. His meals were prepared by his housekeeper, and were left on a tray at the door of the ante-room and then taken in by the deceased; and although many times in a state of ill-health, he refused to have medical aid, but used to have sent in from a chemist’s a quantity of different medicines. All communications to him were received in the same way as his meals, and for more than twelve months he never left his house. He is stated to have been a person of considerable ability, and, although very eccentric in his habits, of perfectly sound mind, and capable of managing his property, which consisted among others of large estates in Cumberland and Cardiff. Death, in such seclusion, must have come with twofold awe. It appears that Mr. Blamire’s housekeeper went up, as usual, with his dinner, but received no reply at the door, and although she frequently called him, she did not again see him alive. In two days, becoming alarmed, she made a communication to the police, and the door was broken open. The floor of the ante-room was strewn with newspapers, writings, &c., chairs, table, and other articles of furniture. The left-hand room… presented even a more extraordinary appearance. At one end was a chimney-glass some twelve feet in height, covered with dust and cobwebs. The furniture, of very handsome description, was in an equally dusty state, while the dust lay on everything to nearly an inch in thickness. The floor was strewn with trunks, papers, and books of science and law of much value. There were also three large bags filled with new boots, several silver spoons lay upon the sideboards; and packages of candles, clothing, &c, were heaped up in the utmost of confusion. Near the doorway was a painting of the Crucifixion, about 12 ft. by 4 ft., said to be of great value. In the right-hand room, furniture, books, paintings, &c., were piled together in dirt and disorder. The deceased was found lying in decomposition, having no doubt been dead several days. He was dressed, but in a very dirty state, and by his side lay the remains of some food. There was neither bed nor bedding; the deceased is stated for twenty years to have slept in the same chair. In other parts of the room were scraps of bread, bottles of wine, and medicine. Upon a further search, 7l. 17s. in a bag, a gold and silver watch, twenty-six silver articles, and other valuables, were found; while upon the floor were scattered thirty keys. Dr. Alfred Harvey afterwards examined the body and made a post-mortem examination, from which it was shown that death had resulted from exhaustion, from low fever accelerated by neglect; the verdict returned by the coroner’s jury. The deceased was a bachelor, and had no near relatives; but he was said to have been very charitable and honourable.\n\nMr. Blamire’s estate was found to include a vault of very old wines, including some 1720 rum that was recorked in 1826 and was upwards of 144 years old when sold at Blamire’s death. The whole stock realized above 1,700l.\n\nSusanna Blamire (1747–1794), an English poet, known as The Muse of Cumberland, was likely a relative. Her poems, collected in 1842, depicted Cumbrian life and manners.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nEccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nMr. Rogers, in his Table Talk, writes:—”Neither [Thomas] Moore nor myself had ever seen Byron, when it was settled that he should dine at my house to meet Moore; nor was he known by sight to [Thomas] Campbell, who, happening to call upon me that morning, consented to join the party. I thought it best that I alone should be in the drawing-room when Byron entered it; and Moore and Campbell accordingly withdrew. Soon after his arrival they returned, and I introduced them to him severally, naming then as Adam named the beasts. When we sat down to dinner, I asked Byron if he would take soup? ‘No; he never took soup.’—Would he take some fish? ‘No; he never took fish.’ Presently, I asked if he would eat some mutton? ‘No’ he never ate mutton.’—I then asked if he would take a glass of wine? ‘No; he never tasted wine.’—It was now necessary to inquire what he did eat and drink’ and the answer was,—’Nothing but hard biscuits and soda-water.’ Unfortunately, neither hard biscuits nor soda-water were at hand; and he dined upon potatoes bruised down on his plate and drenched with vinegar. My guests stayed till very late, discussing the merits of Walter Scott and Joanna Baillie. Some days after, meeting Hobhouse, I said to him, ‘How long will Lord Byron persevere in his present diet?’ He replied,—’Just as long as you continue to notice it.’ I did not then know what I now know to be a fact, that Byron, after leaving my house, had gone to a club in St. James’s Street and eaten a hearty meat supper… Byron had a prodigious facility of composition. He was fond of suppers, and used often to sup at my house and eat heartily (for he had then given up the hard biscuit and soda-water diet); after going home he would throw off sixty or eighty verses, which he would send to press next morning… In those days, at least, Byron had no readiness of reply in conversation. If you happened to let fall any observation which offended him, he would say nothing at the time, but the offence would lie rankling in his mind, and, perhaps, a fortnight after, he would suddenly come out with some very cutting remarks upon you, giving them as his deliberate opinions, the results of his experience of your character.”\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nSamuel Rogers (30 July 1763 – 18 December 1855) was an English poet, during his lifetime one of the most celebrated, although his fame has long since been eclipsed by his Romantic colleagues and friends Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron. His recollections of these and other friends such as Charles James Fox are key sources for information about London artistic and literary life, with which he was intimate, and which he used his wealth to support. He made his money as a banker and was also a discriminating art collector.\n\nJohn Timbs’s Reflections\n\nA few days after the death of Mr. Rogers, in 1855, there appeared the following interesting record of him from the practised pen of Mr. Robert Carruthers, who long enjoyed the friendship of the distinguished poet and patron of artists and men of letters.\n\nIt is not our intention to speak of the poetry of Mr. Rogers. In noticing it some time since we characterised it generally as presenting a classic and graceful beauty; with no slovenly or obscure lines; with fine cabinet pictures of soft and mellow lustre, and occasionally with trains of thought and association that awaken or recall tender and heroic feelings. No that personal interest in a living poet is withdrawn, and kindness and respect towards him are of no avail, it may be questioned whether Rogers’s poetry will maintain any prominent place in our literature. He will always be esteemed one of the purest disciples of the old classic school of Pope and Dryden—and to turn to him from the mystic ravings, tortures, and Red Indian chants of some modern poets, is like emerging from the wards of an hospital to fresh air and sunshine; but he wants vital interest, passion and strength, for universal popularity. He had not what Gray terms the “golden keys” that can unlock the gates of joy or horror, or open the “sacred source of sympathetic tears.”\n\nIt is a man of taste and letters, as a patron of artists and authors, and as the friend of almost every illustrious man that has graced our annals for the last half century and more, that Mr. Rogers has of late years challenged public attention. He was a link between the days of Johnson, Burke, and Reynolds, and the present time. He had rambled over St. Anne’s Hill with Fox and Grattan. Sheridan addressed to him the last letter he ever wrote, begging for pecuniary assistance, that the blanket on which he was dying might not be torn from his bed by bailiffs; and Rogers answered the call with a remittance of 100 l. No man had so many books dedicated to him. Byron inscribed to him his “Giaour,” in token of “admiration of his genius, respect for his character, and gratitude for his friendship.” Moore was no less laudatory, and Moore owed substantial favours to the old poet. By his mediation his quarrel with Byron was adjusted, and when Moore fell into difficulties, the liberal hand of Rogers was opened. His benefactions in this way were almost of daily occurrence. “There is a happy and enviable poet!” said Thomas Campbell one day on leaving Rogers’s house; “he has some four or five thousand pounds a year, and he gives away fifteen hundred in charity.” And next to relieving the distress of authors and others, it was the delight of Mr. Rogers to reconcile differences and bring together men who might otherwise never meet. At his celebrated breakfast-parties persons of almost all classes and pursuits were found. He made the morning meal famous as a literary rallying point; and during the London season there was scarcely a day in which from four to six persons were not assembled at the hospitable board in St. James’s Place. There discussion as to books or pictures, anecdotes of the great of old, some racy sayings of Sheridan, Erskine, or Horne Tooke, some apt quotation or fine passage read aloud, some incident of foreign travel recounted all flowed on without restraint, and charmed the hours till mid-day. Byron has described the scene of these meetings:—\n\n“Rogers is silent, and it is said, severe. When he does talk, he talks well; and, on all subjects of taste, his delicacy of expression is pure as his poetry. If you enter his house, his drawing-room, his library, you of yourself say, this is not the dwelling of a common mind. There is not a gem, a coin, a book thrown aside on his chimney-piece, his sofa, his table, that does not bespeak an almost fastidious elegance in the possessor. But this very delicacy must be the misery of his existence. Oh, the jarrings his disposition must have encountered through life!”\n\nByron’s sensitiveness coloured all he saw with his own feeling. There was none of this misery resulting from Rogers’s taste. He enjoyed life—had money, fame, honour, love, and troops of friends. His recipe for long life was “temperance, the bath, flesh-brush, and don’t fret.” But his house was really a magazine of marvels—the saloon of the Muses!—and its opening view on the garden and lawn of the Green Park in itself a picture. Paintings by Titian, Guido, Rubens, Claude, Raphael, and English artists, covered the walls. Every school, Italian and Spanish, had the representative, and not the least prized were the native landscapes of Wilson and Gainsborough, and the “Strawberry Girl” and “Puck” of Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the hall were Greek sculptures, busts, and vases, with endless articles of virtu. The library had its rare and choice editions—a drawing by Raphael, an original bust of Pope by Roubiliac, antique gems and cameos, and many precious manuscripts. Two of these he lately presented to the British Museum—Milton’s agreement with his bookseller for the copyright of “Paradise Lost” (for which he gave a hundred guineas), and Dryden’s contract with his publisher, Jacob Tonson. The whole arrangement of these rooms bespoke consummate taste and carelessness of cost. The chimney-piece of the drawing-room was of Carrera marble, sculptured with bas-reliefs and miniature statues by Flaxman; and the panels of a small library displayed the “Seven Ages of Man,” painted by Stothard. To comprehend how so much was done by one less than a noble, we must recollect Rogers’s bank, his exquisite taste, and his long life. He had written Journals of Conversations with Fox, Erskine, Horne, Tooke, and the Duke of Wellington (some of which we have seen), and those can scarcely fail to be both interesting and valuable.\n\nThe severity of remark alluded to by Byron as characteristic of his friend, was displayed in a certain quaint shrewdness and sarcasm with which his conversation abounded, though rarely taking an offensive form. He could pay compliments as pointed as his sarcasm. Moore has recorded the pleasure he derived from one of Rogers’s remarks—”What a lucky fellow you are! Surely you must have been born with a rose on your lips and a nightingale singing on the top of your bed.” These and many other sayings, pleasant and severe, will now be remembered. But higher associations, even apart from his genius, will be associated with the name of Samuel Rogers. His generosity and taste—his readiness to oblige and serve, or to encourage and reward the humblest labourer in the literary vineyard—his devotion to all intellectual and liberal pursuits—the jealousy with which he guarded the dignity and rights of literature—the example of a straight path and spotless life extended to more than ninety-two years; these are honours and distinctions which will “gather round his tomb,” and outlast his monument.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nWhy does anyone want to be a billionaire?\n\nI’m not sure why the opening line of the passage below spoke to me. Perhaps because I am two days away from my annual migration south for the winter and I’m worried about leaving something essential that I will need. Not to mention the limits of the space in the car, which I also have to share with my parents’ stuff. But it has occurred to me periodically in my life that possessions are a burden, even though I cannot get myself to give enough of them away to relieve the burden.\n\nIn these moments, I find myself exceedingly grateful not to be a billionaire. Or in the case of the subject of today’s post—a millionaire. I can’t think of anyone who would want to kill me for my possessions, at least. It does happen, though, so perhaps Mr. Rothschild had good reason for his fears. In our time, I’m thinking of Bison Dele, former NBA player who was murdered for his money by his own brother. And the homeless Abraham Shakespeare who won the lottery, but ended up murdered by someone he trusted to help him manage his money. (Yes, I am addicted to the ID Discovery Channel.)\n\nThe Penalties of Avarice\n\nPossession naturally brings apprehension as to the power of retaining it. There were periods in the career of Rothschild, the millionaire, when his gigantic capital seemed likely to be scattered to the four quarters of the globe. He had also other sources of apprehension. Threats of murder were not unfrequent. On one occasion he was waited on by a stranger, who informed him that a plot had been formed to take his life; that the loans which he had made Austria, and his connection with Governments adverse to the liberties of Europe, marked him for assassination; and that the mode by which he was to lose his life was arranged. But though Rothschild smiled outwardly at those and similar threats, they said who knew him best, that his mind was always troubled by these remembrances, and that they haunted him at moments when he would willingly have forgotten them. Occasionally his fears took a ludicrous form. Two tall moustachioed men were once shown into his counting-house. Mr. Rothschild bowed; the visitors bowed; and their hands wandered first in one pocket and then in another. To the anxious eye of the millionaire, they assumed the form of persons searching for deadly weapons. No time seemed allowed for thought; a ledger, without a moment’s warning, was hurled at the intruders; and in a paroxysm of fear he called for assistance to drive out two customers, who were only feeling in their pockets for letters of introduction. There is no doubt that he dreaded assassination greatly. “You must be a happy man, Mr. Rothschild,” said a gentleman who was sharing the hospitality of his splendid home, as he glanced at the superb apartments of the mansion. “Happy—I happy!” was the reply. “What! happy, when just as you are going to dine, you have a letter placed in your hand, saying, ‘If you do not send 500l I will blow your brains out?’ Happy—I happy!” And the fact that he frequently slept with loaded pistols by his side is an indirect evidence of a constant excitement on the subject.*\n\nThe late Nathan Meyer Rothschild was the most famous foreign exchange broker in London. “He never hesitated for a moment in fixing a rate, either as a drawer or purchaser of a foreign bill of exchange on any part of the world; and his memory was so retentive that, notwithstanding the multifarious transactions in which he was engaged on every foreign post-day on the Royal Exchange, he never took a note of them; but on his return to his office could dictate to his clerks the whole of the bargains he had made, with the various rates of exchange, and the names of the several parties with whom he had dealt, and the most perfect exactness.”\n\n*Characters of the Stock Exchange\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

The predominance of horse-drawn vehicles—and the general uncleanliness of urban streets—entailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by horse droppings (among other forms of refuse). Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person crossing the street and creating a path that was referred to as a “broom walk,” thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent.\n\nA Remarkable Tale\n\nThe Rev. Samuel Bache, Minister of the New Meeting House, Birmingham, received the following very remarkable story from a venerable friend, one of the principal members of his congregation, some five-and-twenty years hence.\n\nThe late Mr. Simcox, of Harbourne, near Birmingham, who was largely engaged in the nail trade, in one of his visits to London, on business, was suddenly overtaken by a heavy shower of rain, from which he sought shelter under an archway: the rain continued for a long time with unabated violence, and he was, consequently, obliged to remain his place of shelter. He was soon agreeably surprised by a footman approaching with an umbrella, with his master’s compliments, and that he had observed the gentleman standing so long under the archway, that he feared he might take cold, and therefore would be glad if he would come and take shelter in his house—an invitation which Mr. Simcox gladly accepted. He was ushered into a drawing-room, where the master of the house was sitting, and he received from him a friendly welcome.\n\nScarcely, however, had Mr. Simcox set eyes on his host, than he was struck with a vague remembrance of having seen him before; but where, or under what circumstances, he was altogether unable to call to mind. “You seem, sir,” said he, “to look at me as though you had seen me before.” Mr. Simcox acknowledged that his host was right in his conjectures, but confessed his entire inability to recall the occasion. “You are right, sir,” said the old gentleman; “and if you will pledge your word as a man of honour to keep my secret, and not to disclosed to anyone what I am now going to tell you until you have seen the notice of my death in the London papers, I have no objection to remind you where and how you have known me.”\n\nIn St. James’s Park, near Spring Gardens, you may pass every day an old man, who sweeps a crossing there, and whose begging is attended by this strange peculiarity—that whatever be the amount of the alms bestowed on him, he will retain only a halfpenny, and scrupulously return to the donor all the rest. Such an unusual proceeding naturally excites the curiosity of those who hear of it; and anyone who has himself made the experiment, when he happens to be walking by with a friend, is almost sure to say to him, ‘Do you see that old fellow there? He is the strangest beggar you ever saw in your life. If you give him sixpence, he will be sure to give you fivepence-halfpenny back again.’ Of course, his friend makes the experiment, which turns out as predicted; and as crowds of people are constantly passing, there are numbers of persons every day who make the same trial; and thus the old man gets many a halfpenny from the curiosity of the passers by, in addition to what he obtains from their compassion.”\n\n“I, sir,” continued the old gentleman, “am that beggar. Many years ago, I first hit upon the expedient for the relief of my then pressing necessities; for I was at that time utterly destitute; but finding the scheme answer beyond my expectations, I was induced to carry it on until I had at last, and with the aid of profitable investment, realized a handsome fortune, enabling me to live in the comfort in which you find me this day. And now, sir, such is the force of habit, that, thought I am no longer under any necessity for continuing this plan, I find myself quite unable to give it up; and, accordingly, every morning I leave home, apparently for business purposes, and go to a room, where I put on my old beggar’s clothes, and continue sweeping my crossing in the park till a certain hour in the afternoon, when I go back to my room, resume my usual dress, and return home in time for dinner, as you see me this day.”\n\nMr. Simcox, as a gentleman and a man of honour, scrupulously fulfilled his pledge; but having seen in the London papers the announcement of the beggar’s death, he then communicated this strange story. The name of this eccentric person is not known; but the incidents are recollected by more than one narrator.\n\nCrossing-sweeping as a Career Choice?\n\nApparently some sweepers, even without gimmicks, made a good living from it.\n\nThe produce of a street crossing in London is sometimes considerable. At an inquest held on the body of a crossing sweeper, who had died suddenly, Mr. Wakley, the coroner, said that the sweeper of a crossing sold his interest in it for 40l. A juror observed that crosswings were freehold, by which many proprietors amassed, in former days, sums of 500l, 1,000l, 4,000l. Another juror alluded to the sweeper of the crossing at Bridge Street, Blackfriars, who bequeathed a large sum to Miss Waithman (daughter of the alderman) in gratitude for her benevolence in giving him his dinner every Sunday; and another gentleman said that the sweeper of a crossing near Hyde Park bequeathed 1,000l to a gentleman who was in the habit of giving him 6d whenever he passed his crossing.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nVoltaire in London\n\nVoltaire lodged at the sign of the White Peruke, a fashionable French perruquier’s, in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. In Swift’s Works (vol. xx of the duodecimo edition, p. 294), there is a letter to him, in English, by Voltaire, and dated from this house. The English seems a little too perfect. There is another following it which looks more authentic. But there is no doubt that Voltaire, while in England, made himself such a master of the language, as to be able to write in it with singular correctness for a foreigner. He was then young. He had been imprisoned in the Bastile for a libel; came over here, on his release; procured many subscriptions for the “Henriade;” published in English “An Essay on Epic Poetry,” and remained some years, during which he became acquainted with the principal men of letters—Pope, Congreve, and Young. He is said to have talked so indecently at Pope’s table (probably no more than was thought decent by the belles in France), that the good old lady, the poet’s mother was obliged to retire. Objecting, at Lord Chesterfield’s table, to the allegories of Milton, Young is said to have accosted him in the well-known couplet:—\n\nThou art so witty, profligate, and thin,\n\nThou seem’st a Milton, with his Death and Sin.\n\nBut this story has been doubted. Voltaire left England with such a mass of subscriptions for his Henriade as laid the foundation of his fortunes, and with great admiration of English talent and genius, particularly that of Newton and Locke, which, with all his insinuations against our poetry, he took warm pains to extend, and never gave up. He was fond to the last of showing he had not forgotten his English. Somebody telling him that Johnson had spoken well of his talents, he said, in English, “He is a clever fellow;” but the gentleman observing that the doctor did not think well of his religion, he added, “a superstitious dog.”\n\nDuring his residence in Maiden Lane, there is a story of Voltaire’s having been beset, in one of his walks, by the people, who ridiculed him as a Frenchman. He got upon the steps of a door-way and harangued them in their own language in praise of English liberty and the nation; upon which, the story adds, they hailed him as a fine fellow, and carried him to his lodgings on their shoulders.—Leigh Hunt’s Town.\n\nLa Henriade\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nLa Henriade is an epic poem of 1723 written by the French Enlightenment writer and philosopher Voltaire. According to Voltaire himself, the poem concerns and was written in honour of the life of Henry IV of France, and is a celebration of his life. The ostensible subject is the siege of Paris in 1589 by Henry III in consort with Henry of Navarre, soon to be Henry IV, but its themes are the twin evils of religious fanaticism and civil discord. It also concerns the political state of France. Voltaire aimed to be the French Virgil, outdoing the master by preserving Aristotelian unity of place—a property of classical tragedy rather than epic—”by keeping the human action confined between Paris and Ivry. It was first printed (under the title La Ligue) in 1723, and reprinted dozens of times within Voltaire’s lifetime.\n\nVoltaire in Great Britain\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nIn early 1726, a young French nobleman, the chevalier de Rohan-Chabot, taunted Voltaire about his change of name, and Voltaire retorted that his name would be honoured while de Rohan would dishonour his. Infuriated, de Rohan arranged for Voltaire to be beaten up by thugs a few days later. Seeking compensation, redress, or revenge, Voltaire challenged de Rohan to a duel, but the aristocratic de Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned in the Bastille on 17 April 1726 without a trial or an opportunity to defend himself. Fearing an indefinite prison sentence, Voltaire suggested that he be exiled to England as an alternative punishment, which the French authorities accepted. On 2 May, he was escorted from the Bastille to Calais, where he was to embark for Britain.\n\nIn England, Voltaire lived largely in Wandsworth with acquaintances including Everard Fawkener. From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged at Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, now commemorated by a plaque, to be nearer to his British publisher. Voltaire circulated throughout English high society, meeting Alexander Pope, John Gay, Jonathan Swift, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and many other members of the nobility and royalty. Voltaire’s exile in Great Britain greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britain’s constitutional monarchy in contrast to French absolutism, and by the country’s greater support of the freedoms of speech and religion. He was influenced by the writers of the age, and developed an interest in earlier English literature, especially the works of Shakespeare, still relatively unknown in continental Europe. Despite pointing out his deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw Shakespeare as an example that French writers might emulate, since French drama, despite being more polished, lacked on-stage action. Later, however, as Shakespeare’s influence began growing in France, Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays, decrying what he considered Shakespeare’s barbarities. Voltaire may have been present at the funeral of Isaac Newton and met Newton’s niece, Catherine Conduitt. In 1727 he published two essays in English, Upon the Civil Wars of France, Extracted from Curious Manuscripts, and Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations, from Homer Down to Milton.\n\nAfter two and a half years in exile, Voltaire returned to France, and after a few months living in Dieppe, the authorities permitted him to return to Paris. At a dinner, French mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts, and Voltaire joined the consortium, earning perhaps a million livres. He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the Court of Finances that he was of good conduct and so was able to take control of a capital inheritance from his father that had hitherto been tied up in trust. He was now indisputably rich.\n\nFurther success followed, in 1732, with his play Zaïre, which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener that praised English liberty and commerce. At this time he published his views on British attitudes toward government, literature, religion and science in a collection of essays in letter form entitled Letters Concerning the English Nation (London, 1733). In 1734, they were published in French as Lettres philosophiques in Rouen. Because the publisher released the book without the approval of the royal censor and Voltaire regarded the British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights (particularly religious tolerance) than its French counterpart, the French publication of Letters caused a huge scandal; the book was publicly burnt and banned, and Voltaire was forced again to flee Paris.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

He is commonly known as the Duke of Newcastle.\n\nA protégé of Sir Robert Walpole, he served under him for more than twenty years, until 1742. He held power with his brother, Henry Pelham (the Prime Minister of Great Britain), until 1754. He had at this point served as a Secretary of State continuously for thirty years—dominating British foreign policy.\n\nWalpole gladly welcomed the young Newcastle into his coterie, firstly because he believed he could easily control him, and secondly because it would strengthen his hand against the rival Whig factions. Newcastle joined with Walpole because he, correctly, believed that he was going to dominate British politics for a generation.\n\nAfter Henry’s death the Duke held his late brother’s position for six years, in two separate periods. While his first premiership was not particularly notable, Newcastle precipitated the Seven Years’ War, which would cause his resignation from his high position. After his second term as Prime Minister, he served for a short while in Lord Rockingham’s ministry, before retiring from government. Few politicians in British history matched his skills and industry in using patronage to maintain power over long stretches of time. He was most effective, however, as a deputy to a leader of greater ability, such as Walpole, his brother, or Pitt.\n\nHistorian Harry Dickinson says that he became:\n\nnotorious for his fussiness and fretfulness, his petty jealousies, his reluctance to accept responsibility for his actions, and his inability to pursue any political objective to his own satisfaction or to the nations profit…. Many modern historians have depicted him as the epitome of unredeemed mediocrity and as a veritable buffoon in office.\n\nThe Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nThere is scarcely any public man in our history of whose manners and conversation so many particulars have been preserved, as of the Duke of Newcastle, the well-known leader in the Pelham Administration under George II. Single stories may be unfounded or exaggerated. But all the stories about him, whether told by people who were perpetually seeing him in Parliament, and attending his levées in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, or by Grub Street writers who had never more than a glimpse of his star through the windows of his gilded coach, are of the same character. Horace Walpole and Smollett differed in their tastes and opinions as much as two human beings could differ. They quite different society. Walpole played at cards with countesses, and corresponded with ambassadors. Smollett passed his life surrounded by printers’ devils and famished scribblers. Yet, Walpole’s Duke and Smollett’s Duke are as like as if they were both from one hand. Smollett’s Newcastle runs out of his dressing-room, with his face covered with soap-suds, to embrace the Moorish envoy. Walpole’s Newcastle pushes his way into the Duke of Grafton’s sick-room to kiss the old nobleman’s plasters. No man was so unmercifully satirised. But in truth he was himself a satire ready made. All that the art of the satirist does for other men, nature had done for him. Whatever was absurd about him, stood out with grotesque prominence from the rest of the character. He was a living, moving, talkng caricature. His gait was a shuffling trot; his utterance a rapid stutter; he was always in a hurry; he was never in time; he abounded in fulsome caresses and hysterical tears. His oratory resembled that of Justice Shallow. It was nonsense effervescent with animal spirits and impertinence. Of his ignorance many anecdotes remain, some well authenticated, some probably invented at coffee-houses, but all exquisitely characteristic:—”Oh—yes—yes—to be sure—Annapolis must be defended—troops must be sent to Annapolis—Pray where is Annapolis?”—”Cape Breton an island! wonderful!—show it me in the map. So it is, sure enough. My dear sir, you always bring us good news. I must go and tell the King that Great Britain is an island.”\n\nAnd this man was, during near thirty years, Secretary of State, and during near ten years, First Lord of the Treasury! His large fortune, his strong hereditary connections, his great parliamentary interest, will not alone explain this extraordinary fact. His success is a signal instance of what may be effected by a man who devotes his whole heart and soul, without reserve, to one object. He was eaten up by ambition. He was greedy after power with a greediness all his own. He was jealous of all his colleagues, and even of his own brother. Under the disguise of levity he was false eyond all example of political falsehood. All the able of men of his time ridiculed him as a dunce, a driveller, a child who never knew his own mind for an hour together; and he overreached them all round.—Lord Macaulay, on Walpole’s Letters.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

His wife Sarah was an intimate friend of Queen Anne… until Sarah’s hot temper and conceit earned her dismissal from court. For more about Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, check out this article in Wikipedia.\n\nMarlborough House\n\nLittle can be said, architecturally, of Marlborough House, notwithstanding it was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, who was employed, not because he was preferred, but that Vanbrugh might be vexed. Respecting Marlborough House, Pennant says\n\nTo the east of St. James’s Palace, in the reign of Queen Anne, was built Marlborough House, at the expense of the public. It appears by one of the views of St. James’s, published before the existence of this house, that it was built in part of the Royal Gardens, granted for that purpose by her Majesty. The present Duke [Pennant writes in 1793] added an upper story, and improved the ground floor, which originally wanted a great room. This national compliment cost no less than 40,000l.\n\nAs regards the site, Pennant’s account is corroborated by other authorities, who say that the mansion of the famous John Churchill was built on ground “which had been used for keeping pheasants, guinea-hens, partridges, and other fowl, and on that piece of ground taken out of St. James’s Park, then in possession of Henry Boyle, one of her Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State.”\n\nThe Duchess both experienced and caused great mortifications here. She used to speak of the King in the adjacent palace as her “neighbor George.” The entrance to the house from Pall Mall was, as it still is, a crooked and inconvenient one. To remedy this defect, she intended to purchase some houses… for the purpose of pulling them down and constructing a more commodious entry to the mansion; but Sir Robert Walpole [whom she considered to be her greatest enemy], with no more dignified motive than mere spite, secured the houses and ground, and erected buildings [there], which… blocked in the front of the Duchess’ mansion. She was subjected to a more temporary, but as inconvenient blockade, when the preparations for the wedding of the imperious Princess Anne [does Timbs mean Mary?] and her ugly husband, the Prince of Orange, was going on. Among other preparations, a boarded gallery, through which the nuptial procession was to pass, was built up close against the Duchess’ windows, completely darkening her rooms. As the boards remained there during the postponement of the ceremony, the Duchess used to look at them with the remark, “I wish the Princess would oblige me by taking away her ‘orange chest!'”*\n\nNote: Currently the home of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the house is usually open to the public for Open House Weekend each September.\n\nThe Character of the Duchess\n\nFrom the Memoirs of Mrs. Delany:\n\nThe conversation turned upon the famous Duchess of Marlborough: among others, one striking anecdote, that though she appeared affected in the highest degree at the death of her grand-daughter, the Duchess of Bedford, she sent the day after she died for the jewels she had given her, saying ‘she had only lent them;’ the answer was that she ‘had said she would never demand those jewels again except she danced at court;‘ her answer was ‘then she would be —- if she would not dance at court,’ &c. … She used to say that she was very certain she should go to heaven, and as her ambition went even beyond the grave, that she knew she should have one of the highest seats.\n\nA few of the Duchess’ eccentricities and extravagancies have been put together somewhat in the humorous manner of our early story-books, as follows:\n\nThis is the woman who wrote the characters of her contemporaries with a pen dipped in gall and wormwood. This is the Duchess who gave 10,000l to Mr. Pitt for his noble defense of the constitution of his country! … This is the Duchess who, in her old age, used to feign asleep after dinner, and say bitter things at table pat and appropriate, but as if she was not aware of what was going on! This is the lady who drew that beautiful distinction that it was wrong to wish Sir Robert Walpole dead, but only common justice to wish him well hanged. This is the Duchess who tumbled her thoughts out as they arose, and wrote like the wife of the Great Duke Marlborough. This is the lady who quarreled with a wit upon paper (Sir John Vanbrugh), and actually got the better of him in the long run; who shut out the architect of Blenheim from seeing his own edifice, and made him dangle his time away at an inn while his friends were shown the house of the eccentric Sarah.\n\nThis is the Duchess who, ever proud and ever malignant, was persuaded to offer her favorite grand-daughter, Lady Diana Spencer, afterwards Duchess of Bedford, to the Prince of Wales, with a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds. He accepted the proposal and the day was fixed for their being secretly married at the Duchess’ Lodge, in the Great Park, at Windsor. Sir Robert Walpole got intelligence of the project, prevented it, and the secret was buried in silence.\n\nThis is the Duchess—The wisest fool much time has ever made—who refused the proffered hand of the proud Duke of Somerset, for the sole and sufficient reason that no one should share her heart with the great Duke of Marlborough.\n\nThis is the illustrious lady who superintended the building of Blenheim, examined contracts and tenders, talked with carpenters and masons, and thinking sevenpence-halfpenny a bushel for lime too much by a farthing, waged a war to the knife on so small a matter.\n\nThis is the celebrated Sarah, who, at the age of eighty-four, when she was told she must either submit to be blistered or die, exclaimed in anger, and with a start in bed, “I won’t be blistered, and I won’t die!”\n\nThe Duchess died, notwithstanding what she said, at Marlborough House, in 1774.\n\n*Dr. Doran’s Queens of England—House of Hanover\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

Or you can pay for a print version.\n\nSir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nSir William Petty is commonly described as “the founder of the house of Lansdowne,” a statement which is not sufficiently exact for all readers.\n\nThe story of William Petty, from May 1623, when he was born at Romsey, in Hampshire, to the time of his interment in the Norman church of that town, in 1687, is one of those lessons of life which can scarcely be too often repeated.\n\nPetty was the son of a clothier in humble circumstances, was sent to Romsey Grammar School, and determined next to study at the University of Caen, in Normandy. Thither he sped, supporting himself by the way, with “a little stock of merchandise,” as a pedlar. He returned to England, and apprenticed himself to a sea captain, who, however, “drubbed him with a rope’s-end for the badness of his sight. This ill-treatment disgusted him with the navy; he took to the study of medicine, and while at Paris for that purpose became so poor as to subsist for two or three weeks entirely on walnuts; but, by help of the pedlar trade, he came back to England with money in his pocket. Here he exercised his liking for mechanics by inventing a letter-copying machine, or, as he called it, “an instrument for the art of double writing,” which he patented, for seventeen years, in 1648; and this very instrument is the prototype of the manifold letter-writers of our times. Petty likewise practiced chemistry and physic; and at his lodgings in Oxford were held the first meetings to form the Royal Society. At Oxford, Petty acted as deputy to the anatomical professor there: he lodged at an apothecary’s house, “because of the convenience of inspecting drugs.” In 1652 Petty was appointed Physician-General to the Army in Ireland. In 1664 he undertook the survey of Ireland; and in 1666, he had completed the measurement of two million and eight thousand acres of forfeited lands, for which, by contract, he was to receive one penny per acre. Sir William Petty is better known in our day as a writer upon trade and commerce and political arithmetic.\n\nAmong Sir W. Petty’s inventions was “a double-bottomed ship, to sail against wind and tide.” He wrote on dyeing and on woolen cloth manufacture; he speculated in ironworks, lead-mince, a pilchard fishery, and timber trade; and all this time took an active part in the discussions of the Royal Society. He also built Tokenhouse Yard, Rothbury, on the site of the Earl of Arundel’s house and garden: and he held property in the yard at the time of the Great Fire. His will, made in 1661, details his birth, boohoo, education, adventures, studies, attainments, and promotions in life, commencing “with three-score pounds at the age of twenty,” an being in the receipt of 15,000l per annum a short time before his death, at which time he was residing in the corner house on the east side of Sackville Street, Piccadilly, opposite St. James’s Church. The widow of Sir William Petty was created Baroness Shelburn. He left two sons and a daughter. The eldest son succeeded to the title; but, dying without issue, it was revived in Henry, the second son, great uncle of the first Marquis of Lansdowne.\n\nThe remains of Sir William Petty rest in Romsey Church, where, on the south side of the choir, a plain slab bore the inscription, “Here Layes Sir William Petty;” but a more fitting memorial of his celebrated lineal ancestor was, in 1862, erected by the late Marquis of Lansdowne.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nSir William Petty FRS (26 May 1623 – 16 December 1687) was an English economist, scientist and philosopher. He first became prominent serving Oliver Cromwell and Commonwealth in Ireland. He developed efficient methods to survey the land that was to be confiscated and given to Cromwell’s soldiers. He also managed to remain prominent under King Charles II and King James II, as did many others who had served Cromwell.\n\nHe was Member of the Parliament of England briefly and was also a scientist, inventor, and entrepreneur, and was a charter member of the Royal Society. It is for his theories on economics and his methods of political arithmetic that he is best remembered, however, and to him is attributed the philosophy of ‘laissez-faire’ in relation to government activity. He was knighted in 1661. He was the great-grandfather of Prime Minister William Petty Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and 1st Marquess of Lansdowne.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Strange Stories, Scenes And Remarkable Person of the Great Town in 3 Volumes\n\nJohn Timbs\n\nJohn Timbs (1801-1875), who also wrote as Horace Welby, was an English author and aficionado of antiquities.

Although it was meant to facilitate horse-drawn carriages traffic, that never happened. Currently it is part of the London Overground railway network.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nBrunel and Cochrane patented the tunnelling shield, a revolutionary advance in tunnelling technology, in January 1818. In 1823 Brunel produced a plan for a tunnel between Rotherhithe and Wapping, which would be dug using his new shield. Financing was soon found from private investors, including the Duke of Wellington, and a Thames Tunnel Company was formed in 1824, the project beginning in February 1825.\n\nThe tunnelling shield, built at Henry Maudslay’s Lambeth works and assembled in the Rotherhithe shaft, was the key to Brunel’s construction of the Thames Tunnel. The Illustrated London News described how it worked:\n\nThe mode in which this great excavation was accomplished was by means of a powerful apparatus termed a shield, consisting of twelve great frames, lying close to each other like as many volumes on the shelf of a book-case, and divided into three stages or stories, thus presenting 36 chambers of cells, each for one workman, and open to the rear, but closed in the front with moveable boards. The front was placed against the earth to be removed, and the workman, having removed one board, excavated the earth behind it to the depth directed, and placed the board against the new surface exposed. The board was then in advance of the cell, and was kept in its place by props; and having thus proceeded with all the boards, each cell was advanced by two screws, one at its head and the other at its foot, which, resting against the finished brickwork and turned, impelled it forward into the vacant space. The other set of divisions then advanced. As the miners worked at one end of the cell, so the bricklayers formed at the other the top, sides and bottom.\n\nAlthough it was a triumph of civil engineering, the Thames Tunnel was not a financial success. It had cost a fortune to build – £454,000 to dig and another £180,000 to fit out – far exceeding its initial cost estimates. Proposals to extend the entrance to accommodate wheeled vehicles failed owing to cost, and it was used only by pedestrians. It became a major tourist attraction, attracting about two million people a year, each paying a penny to pass through, and became the subject of popular songs. The American traveller William Allen Drew commented that “No one goes to London without visiting the Tunnel” and described it as the “eighth wonder of the world.”\n\nFlooding on the Thames Tunnel\n\nThis stupendous work had considerably advanced by May 1827, when the bed of the river being examined by a diving-bell, the soil was found to be extremely loose; and on the 18th of May, as the tide rose, the ground seemed as though it were alive. The water was pressing in at all points, and it was not long in entering. Occasional bursts of diluted silt were followed by an overwhelming flood of slush and water, which drove all before it. The men, forced out of the shield, fled towards the bottom of the shaft. The water came on in a great wav, threatening to sweep them back under the arch by its recoil against the circular wall of the shaft. The lowest flight of steps was reached, and the recoil wave surged under the men’s feet. They hurried up the stairs of the shaft, and it was thought that all of them had come in, when the cry was raised, “A rope! A rope! Save him! Save him!” Some unfortunate workman had been left behind, and was seen struggling in the water. Young Brunel, seizing a rope, slid down one of the iron ties of the shaft, reached the water, passed the rope around the man’s body, and he was immediately drawn up. It proved to be old Tillett, the engine-man. The roll was then called, and every man answered to his name; but the Tunnel works were, for the time, completely drowned.\n\nOn examination of the bed of the river from the diving-bell, a large hole was found extending from the centre of the Tunnel excavation to a considerable distance eastwards. Measures were taken to fill up the opening with bags of clay, laid so as to form an arch in the bed of the river immediately over the work. More bags of clay were then sunk; and after about thirty thousand cubic feet of clay had been thrown into the hole, the pumping was resumed, and the state of the work could be examined from the inside in a boat. On the 10th of November following, the Tunnel had again been so far cleared of water that young Brunel determined to give a dinner in one of the arches to about fifty friends of the undertaking; while above a hundred of the leading workmen were similarly regaled in the adjoining arch. The band of the Coldstream Guards enlivened the scene, and the proceedings went off with great éclat. The celebration had, however, been premature; and the young engineer had been ‘hallooing before he was out of the ‘—water; for in two months the Thames again burst in, owing in some measure to the incautiousness of young Brunel himself, and the river held possession of the Tunnel for several years.\n\nThe funds of the Tunnel Company were by this time exhausted; and it was determined to make an appeal to the country for the means of finishing it. A subscription-list was opened, and 18,500l promised; but this sum was a mere “flea-bite,” and the works remained suspended. The Government, at length, consented to make a loan of 246,000l for the purpose of enabling the Tunnel to be completed, and the first installment was advanced in December 1834. The water was then pumped out of the Tunnel, and the works were recommenced, after having been at a standstill for a period of seven years. A new shield, of excellent construction, was supplied by the Messrs. Rennie, which was satisfactorily placed in position by the 1st of March 1836. But the difficulties of the undertaking were not yet entirely overcome; the river broke in again and again—three times in twenty weeks, within a distance of only twenty-six feet; but by perseverance and skill the water was ultimately mastered, and the work was at last brought to a completion, and opened to the public on the 25th of March 1843.\n\nThe Brunel Museum\n\nNearby in Rotherhithe, the original Brunel Engine House is open to visitors as the Brunel Museum. It was built to house the drainage pumps for the tunnel and has now been restored. Wikipedia says that “[I]t is still possible to take a walking tour through the tunnel to Wapping from Rotherhithe and back, but these are infrequent and on an ad-hoc basis as they can only take place when that section of the line is closed for maintenance.\n\nRomance of London Series\n\nRomance of London: The Lord Mayor’s Fool… and a Dessert\n\nRomance of London: Carlton House and the Regency\n\nRomance of London: The Championship at George IV’s Coronation\n\nRomance of London: Mrs. Cornelys at Carlisle House\n\nRomance of London: The Bottle Conjuror\n\nRomance of London: Bartholomew Fair\n\nRomance of London: The May Fair and the Strong Woman\n\nRomance of London: Nancy Dawson, the Hornpipe Dancer\n\nRomance of London: Milkmaids on May-Day\n\nRomance of London: Lord Stowell’s Love of Sight-seeing\n\nRomance of London: The Mermaid Hoax\n\nRomance of London: The Bluestocking and the Sweeps’ Holiday\n\nRomance of London: Comments on Hogarth’s “Industries and Idle Apprentices”\n\nRomance of London: The Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: St. Margaret’s Painted Window at Westminster\n\nRomance of London: Montague House and the British Museum\n\nRomance of London: The Bursting of the South Sea Bubble\n\nRomance of London: The Thames Tunnel\n\nRomance of London: Sir William Petty and the Lansdowne Family\n\nRomance of London: Marlborough House and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nRomance of London: The Duke of Newcastle’s Eccentricities\n\nRomance of London: Voltaire in London\n\nRomance of London: The Crossing Sweeper\n\nRomance of London: Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s Fear of Assassination\n\nRomance of London: Samuel Rogers, the Banker Poet\n\nRomance of London: The Eccentricities of Lord Byron\n\nRomance of London: A London Recluse"
