        "text": "I want to say a huge that you to North Bristol NHS Trust, my supportive colleagues Babbasa and all the community members that came out yesterday evening to make the Community Partner's Dinner and Listening event a success. The event sought to celebrate community action, and explore what is needed to help young people (from low income and/or ethnic minority communities) to access and thrive in meaningful opportunities, as well as launching NBT's commitment to offer up to 100 opportunities, as part of the #OurCity2030 campaign, for young people from underserved demographics over the next 3 years. ü§ù The event strengthened the ties and connections across approximately 20 community organisations that were in attendance yesterday - raising awareness of the great work that we are all doing across the city. üè´ Educational partners that were in attendance have tangible future opportunities to talk to their students about. üíº There is an increased awareness around the job roles and career progression for young people from the most 30 deprived wards in Bristol being put forward by North Bristol NHS Trust. üë´üèæ The young people in attendance have been able to grown their network and connections, something that we know is a huge barrier to underrepresented groups, accessing jobs and progressing in all industries. Watch this space to hear about further initiatives around the campaign and the next steps on the pathway into the Health and Social Care industry in Bristol through #OurCity2030. #youngpeople #opportunity #recruitment #diversityinclusion #change #representation #socialjustice\n\nTestimonials. One of the really nice things about being in BNI, is that your fellow Members will refer you to their own contacts when they feel you can help them. Generally that referral results in nothing for the referrer but completely fits the \"givers gain\" philosophy. The referee obviously has an opportunity to expand their contacts and potentially get new business. Another way to validate fellow Members, is through Testimonials. These allow anyone to see that it's not just Members saying how good they are (!) but another Member doing so in an unbiased way. Here's a really good example of a Testimonial between our Members, Martin Williamson and Ashleigh Foden. #bni #bniwedgwood #bninetworking #testimonial\n\nSo, as I continue my new journey as a Senior Placement Consultant, I wanted to share some of the reasons why I feel this service, which remember is completely at NO COST, is so valuable: 1. Customized Guidance: When you meet with me, I will take the time to understand your background, needs, and wishes. 2. Neutral Advocacy: My job isn't to promote a specific community but to remain neutral and encourage what's in your best interest. 3. Community Tours: After presenting a list of living options, I will help narrow down choices, arrange community tours and guide you through the process to make an informed decision. 4. Post-Move Support: Once you've moved, I will ensure the community meets your standards and continue to check in as you settle into your new home. 5. Cost: Importantly, my services are compensated by the senior community, not by you or your family Please message me if I can help you or someone you know.\n\nTestimonials.

From the support of professors and classmates to the mentorship of colleagues and leaders during my time as a Local Area Coordinator for NDIS, and the unwavering friendship that has fueled the inception of My Second Home, I've witnessed firsthand the boundless opportunities this country offers. As we celebrate the success of My Second Home, reaching an annual revenue milestone of $5 million, I am humbled by the collective effort that has propelled us forward. Today, as we embark on a new chapter to expand our business across Australia, I am excited for the possibilities that lie ahead. Our vision goes beyond financial success; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of those in need. That's why I'm thrilled to announce the opening of our Fundraising Expression of Interest. We're inviting passionate individuals not just to invest, but to join us in our mission to create a more inclusive society and transform lives. Together, we can unlock the full potential of My Second Home and make a lasting impact on the NDIS industry. This is just the beginning, and we're inviting you to be part of our journey to change lives and shape the future. Interested in joining us?
