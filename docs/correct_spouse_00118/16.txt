Soul singer Isaac Hayes and his wife, Adjowa, announced that they are the proud parents of a baby boy, born on April 10. According to Hayes? spokesman, Rob Moore, the baby was named Nana Kwadjo and weighed eight pounds, five ounces at birth.

According to the Associated Press, Nana means ?king? in Ghanaian, and Kwadjo means ?boy born on Monday?. One of the reason for the choice of name might be the fact that Hayes was crowned an honorary king of Ghana?s Ada district, as a thank you gesture for his humanitarian work, in 1992.

Nana Kwadjo is the fourth son for Hayes and his first with Adjowa. The couple got married in May 2005.

Hayes has been in the news recently, for reasons other than the happy event. In March, he quit the show South Park, where he was voicing Chef, allegedly because of series creators? Matt Stone and Trey Parker depiction of the Scientologic Church, of which Hayes is a member.
