        "text": "Soul legend Isaac Hayes collapsed and died yesterday while exercising.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital after his wife Adjowa found him lying unconscious near a still-moving treadmill at their home.\n\nHayes, 65, famous as composer of the theme to hit movie Shaft, was rushed to a nearby hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, but was pronounced dead about an hour later.\n\nHayes - dubbed the Black Moses after a 1972 Grammy award-winning album - suffered a mild stroke two years ago but continued recording and working.\n\nBorn in a tin shack in Covington, Tennessee, he was raised by his grandparents after his mother died and his father took off when he was 18 months old.\n\nHe began his recording career in the early 60s and was a longtime songwriter and arranger for Stax Records in Memphis, playing in the studio's back-up band and creating tunes for artists such as Otis Redding.\n\nA flamboyant, deep-voiced performer, he co-wrote soul classics for Sam and Dave, such as Soul Man and Hold On, I'm Coming.\n\nHe released his first solo album in 1967 and had a hit with 1969's Hot Buttered Soul.\n\nIn the early 70s he laid the groundwork for disco and for what became known as urban-contemporary music and for romantic crooners such as Barry White.\n\nCredited with rapping before rap was recognised as a musical form, he said: \"The rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence. And they'll tell you if you ask.\"\n\nHayes composed film scores, most notably the music for Shaft in 1971, which earned him both an Academy and Grammy Award.\n\n\"That was like the shot heard round the world,\" Hayes said in a later interview.\n\nIn a parallel acting career, he was in 70s TV show The Rockford Files and in the 80s and 90s appeared in films including Escape From New York and Johnny Mnemonic. He had roles in The A-Team and Miami Vice.\n\nIn 1997 he reached a new audience as the voice of Chef in TV's South Park.\n\nHayes described his role in South Park as \"a person that speaks his mind; he's sensitive enough to care for children; he's wise enough to not be put into the 'whack' category like everybody else in town - and he l-o-o-o-o-ves the ladies.\"\n\nBut when the show mocked his Scientology religion in 2006, he quit.\n\nExplaining his decision, he said:\n\n\"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs begins.\"\n\nHayes fathered 12 children, the youngest was born in April 2006.\n\nHe was married four times."
