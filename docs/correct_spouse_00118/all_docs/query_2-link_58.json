        "meta_description": "1 review and 3 photos of ISAAC HAYES GRAVE, rated 5.0‚≠ê \"Isaac Hayes was a world-famous musician, song writer, activist and musician who called Memphis home. He passed away in 2008 and was buried in 2008 in Memphis Memorial Park. It is relatively easy to find, as it is located just across from the Crystal Shrine Grotto.\n\nThis is one of the more extravagant graves that you will find in the cemetery.  The grave is marked by a huge bronze foot stone that has photos of Hayes in different stages of his life and his movies engraved in it. It also has the God's Garden poem inscribed and reads: \nGod looked around his garden\nAnd he found an empty place\nHe then looked down upon this earth\nAnd found your star\nHe put his arms around you\nAnd lifted you to rest\nGod's garden is beautiful now\nHe always takes the best. \nBut when you left. THE BIGGEST PART OF ME LEFT. \nBut thanks for leaving a part of us in KOJO \nThe hardest things always was for you to say goodbye. \nSo I won't either. One day we'll be together again. \nLOVING YOU WAS THE GREATEST THING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED YOU'LL ALWAYS BE IN MY HEART. \n\nMy Love, Your wife\nADJOWA \"MARGARET\" HAYES\n\nThe grave looks pretty awesome and is in great shape. Parking here is very easy. There is parking available right in front of where the plot is located. I know what I want my grave to look like now, when it is my time.\n\nAnyway, this is not a long stop. I was there less than 5 minutes. So, you may want to consider planning out additional stops at many of the other attractions in the area, or making this stop part of a larger itinerary to maximize your time and trip. There are many sights to check out in the cemetery including the Crystal Shrine Grotto.\"",
