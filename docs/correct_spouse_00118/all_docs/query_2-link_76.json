        "text": "It was a sad and shocking weekend for the entertainment world. First, comedian Bernie Mac died from complica tions due to pneumonia on Saturday and then word came that musician and cultural icon Isaac Hayes was found dead in his home on Sunday. As news sinks in of their deaths, LA’s the Place takes a look at both men’s path to stardom and the common link they shared before they passed away.\n\nBernie Mac\n\nThis 50-year-old comedian turned actor didn’t get his break until he was 30 years old when he became a hit on the Chicago stand up comedy circuit. After winning the Miller Lite comedy search in 1992, he was given an introduction to the rest of America on HBO’s “Def Comedy Jam.”\n\nHis observational humor, honest look at life and unusual delivery struck a chord with audiences and Mac was tapped to make his debut in Hollywood with a role as a club doorman in 1992’s “Mo’ Money.” He of course went on to play Pastor Clever in the stoner flick, “Friday’, starring Chris Tucker and Ice Cube, as well as small parts in “Booty Call”, “How to be a Player” and “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?” among other films.\n\nMac also appeared on the TV show “Moesha” for several episodes before landing his very own series aptly titled, “The Bernie Mac Show.” For his work as the put upon family man who looks after his sister’s children and where he also made his observations on life directly to the camera, Mac received a Peabody Award for “transcending race and class while lifting viewers with laughter, compassion – and cool.” He also won a BET Comedy Award and was nominated for several Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHis television show ran from 2001-2006 and in that time he made his comedic mark in films such as “Ocean’s Eleven”, “Ocean’s Twelve”, “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle”, “Mr. 3000”, “Guess Who” and “Bad Santa.” Once his show wrapped, Mac continued making hit movies including, “”Pride”, “Ocean’s Thirteen” and “Transformers.”\n\nMac had been living with the immune disorder sarcoidosis, which affects the organs and causes fatigue, skin lesions and a dry cough, but had been in remission from this ailment since 2005. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia in late July of this year in his beloved city of Chicago and passed away at Northwestern Memorial Hospital from complications on August 9th, 2008 leaving his wife Rhonda and daughter Je’Niece behind.\n\nIsaac Hayes\n\nThis cultural icon began his music career in high school where he played in “doo-wop” and jazz bands. He was offered, but turned down several college scholarships in order to play piano with saxophonist Floyd Newman’s band in West Arkansas. From there he landed a job playing keyboards at Memphis’ Stax Records recording studio and played with the likes of Otis Redding. During his time at Stax Records, Hayes wrote over 200 songs with David Porter including the hit, “Soul Man.”\n\nHe soon broke out on his own, recording a solo album entitled, “Hot Buttered Soul.” It stayed at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard R&B chart for 10 weeks and catapulted him to stardom. During his successful recording career, Hayes solidified his pop culture status when he wrote the music for the movie “Shaft” and won an Oscar and Grammy for the theme song and score. He later won another Grammy for his work on the album “Black Moses.”\n\nHayes introduced himself to a new generation of fans when he voiced the character of Chef on the controversial and wildly popular cartoon, “South Park.” In addition, he appeared in films “I’m Gonna ‘Git You, Sucka”, “Shaft” and “Hustle & Flow”, as well as the TV shows, “Miami Vice”, “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” and “Girlfriends.”\n\nInfluencing music of all genres throughout his career, Hayes was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. In addition to his career, Hayes was a human rights activist founding the Isaac Hayes Foundation which supports global causes and serves the needs of the community, as well as served as the international spokesman for the World Literacy Crusade and the Shepherd Foundation which researches alternative treatments for degenerative diseases.\n\nHayes was found in his home in Memphis, Tennessee on Sunday, August 10th. The cause of death is unknown. Hayes was 65 and leaves behind his wife Adjowa, 12 children, 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.\n\nTheir Spirits Live On\n\nAside from the many contributions they’ve already made to the entertainment world, both Isaac Hayes and Bernie Mac have projects in the works to be released later this year or next.\n\nAccording to his IMDB page, Mac has a couple of films in post production including “Old Dogs”, also starring Robin Williams and John Travolta and “Starting Under,” which he stars as the lead. He also narrated a reality TV show called, “Welcome to the Family.”\n\nHayes is listed as having filmed the completed, “Return to Sleepaway Camp” and was attached to the still “in production”, “Knight Fever”, also starring Jeff Fahey.\n\nBoth men were involved in the film “Soul Men”, which centers on two former band mates (one of whom is Bernie Mac) who reunite to take a road trip to pay tribute to their former front man who has died. Isaac Hayes appears as himself in the film that also stars Samuel L. Jackson. “Soul Men” is slated for a November release."
