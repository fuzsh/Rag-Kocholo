        "text": "For the American arctic explorer, see Isaac Israel Hayes.\n\nIsaac Lee Hayes, Jr. (August 20, 1942 – August 10, 2008) [1] was an American songwriter, musician, singer, and occasionally an actor. Hayes was one of the creative geniuses behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s. Hayes, Porter, Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, and John Fogerty were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of notable songs for themselves, the duo \"Sam & Dave\", Carla Thomas, and others.\n\nThe hit song \"Soul Man\" written by Hayes and Porter, and first performed by \"Sam & Dave\" has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. This song was also honored by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by Rolling Stone magazine, and by the RIAA as the Songs of the Century.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Hayes also became a recording musician, and he recorded several successful soul albums such as Hot Buttered Soul (1969) and Black Moses (1971). In addition to his work in popular music, Hayes worked as composer of musical scores for motion pictures.\n\nHayes is well known for his musical score for the film Shaft (1971). For his composition of the Theme from Shaft, Hayes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. Other than such distinguished actors as Sidney Poitier and Hattie McDaniel, Hayes became the first African-American to win an Academy Award in any field whatsoever covered by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hayes also won two Grammy Awards for that same year. Later, he was given his third Grammy Award for his music album Black Moses.\n\nDuring 1992, in recognition of his humanitarian work there, Hayes was crowned as the honorary king of the Ada, Ghana region. Hayes also acted in motion pictures and television, such as in the movie, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Then from 1997 to 2005, he lent his distinctive, deep voice to the character \"Chef\" on the animated TV series South Park, and also to Gandolf \"Gandy\" Fitch in the TV series The Rockford Files (1974 – 80).\n\nOn August 5th, 2003, Isaac Hayes was honored as a BMI Icon at the 203 BMI Urban Awards for his enduring influence on generations of music makers. [2] Throughout his songwriting career, Hayes received five BMI R&B Awards, two BMI Pop Awards, two BMI Urban Awards and six Million-Air citations. As of 2008, his songs generated more than 12 million performances. .[3]\n\nHayes's life and career[]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nIsaac Hayes was born in Covington, Tennessee, in Tipton County. He was the second-born child of Isaac Hayes, Sr., and Eula Hayes.[4]\n\nAfter his mother died young, and his father abandoned his family, Isaac, Jr., was raised by his maternal grandparents,[5] Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade, Sr. The child of a poor sharecropper family, he grew up picking cotton on farms in Shelby County, Tennessee and in Tipton County.\n\nHayes dropped out of high school, but he was later encouraged by his former high school teachers at Manassas High School in Memphis to complete his high school diploma, which he did at the age of 21. After graduating from high school, Hayes was offered several music scholarships from colleges and universities. Hayes turned down all of them because of his obligations to his immediate family. Hayes next worked at a meat-packing plant in Memphis by day, and he played music at nightclubs and juke joints several evenings a week in Memphis and nearby northern Mississippi.[5]\n\nHayes began singing at the age of five at his local church, and, soon after, he taught himself to play the piano, the Hammond organ, the flute, and the saxophone. His first professional gigs, in the late 1950s, were as a singer at Curry's Club in North Memphis, backed by Ben Branch's houseband.[6]\n\nStax Records and Shaft[]\n\nHayes began his recording career in the early 1960s, as a session player for various acts of the Memphis-based Stax Records. He later wrote a string of hit songs with songwriting partner David Porter, including \"You Don't Know Like I Know\", \"Soul Man\", \"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\", and \"Hold On I'm Comin\" for Sam & Dave. Hayes, Porter and Stax studio band Booker T. & the M.G.'s were also the producers for Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and other Stax artists during the mid-1960s. Hayes-Porter contributed to the Stax sound made famous during this period, and Sam & Dave credited Hayes for helping develop both their sound and style. In 1968, Hayes released his debut album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, a jazzy, largely improvised effort that was commercially unsuccessful.\n\nHis next album was Hot Buttered Soul, which was released in 1969 after Stax had gone through a major upheaval. The label had lost its largest star, Otis Redding, in a plane crash in December 1967. Stax lost all of its back catalog to Atlantic Records in May 1968. As a result, Stax executive vice president Al Bell called for 27 new albums to be completed in mid-1969; Hot Buttered Soul, was the most successful of these releases. This album is noted for Hayes' image (shaved head, gold jewelry, sunglasses, etc.) and his distinct sound (extended orchestral songs relying heavily on organs, horns, and guitars, deep bass vocals, etc.). Also on the album, Hayes re-interprets \"Walk On By\" (which had been made famous by Dionne Warwick) into a twelve-minute exploration. \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" starts with an eight-minute long monologue[8] before breaking into song, and the lone original number, the funky \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic\" runs nearly ten minutes, a significant break from the standard three minute soul/pop songs.\n\n\"Walk On By\" would be the first of many times Hayes would take a Burt Bacharach standard, generally made famous as three-minute pop songs by Dionne Warwick or Dusty Springfield, and transform it into a soulful, lengthy and almost gospel number.\n\nIn 1970, Hayes released two albums, The Isaac Hayes Movement and To Be Continued. The former stuck to the four-song template of his previous album. Jerry Butler's \"I Stand Accused\" begins with a trademark spoken word monologue, and Bacharach's \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\" is re-worked. The latter spawned the classic \"The Look Of Love\", another Bacharach song transformed into an eleven-minute epic of lush orchestral rhythm (mid-way it breaks into a rhythm guitar jam for a couple of minutes before suddenly resuming the slow love song). An edited three-minute version was issued as a single.[9] The album also featured the instrumental \"Ike's Mood,\" which segued into his own version of \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\". Hayes released a Christmas single, \"The Mistletoe and Me\" (with \"Winter Snow\" as a B-side).\n\nIn early 1971, Hayes composed music for the soundtrack of the blaxploitation film Shaft. (in the movie, he also appeared in a cameo role as the bartender of No Name Bar). The title theme, with its wah-wah guitar and multi-layered symphonic arrangement, would become a worldwide hit single, and spent two weeks at number one in the Billboard Hot 100 in November. The remainder of the album was mostly instrumentals covering big beat jazz, bluesy funk, and hard Stax-styled soul. The other two vocal songs, the social commentary \"Soulville\" and the nineteen-minute jam \"Do Your Thing,\" would be edited down to hit singles.[9] Hayes won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for the \"Theme from Shaft,\" and was nominated for Best Original Dramatic Score for the film's score.\n\nLater in the year, Hayes released a double album, Black Moses, that expanded on his earlier sounds and featured The Jackson 5's song \"Never Can Say Goodbye\". Another single, \"I Can't Help It\", was not featured on the album.\n\nIn 1972, Hayes would record the theme tune for the TV series The Men and enjoy a hit single (with \"Type Thang\" as a B-side).[9] He released several other non-album singles during the year, such as \"Feel Like Making Love\", \"If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want To Be Right)\", and \"Rolling Down a Mountainside\". Atlantic would re-release Hayes' debut album this year with the new title In The Beginning.[10]\n\nHayes was back in 1973 with an acclaimed live double album, Live At Sahara Tahoe, and followed it up with the album Joy, with the eerie beat of the fifteen-minute title track. He moved away from cover songs with this album. An edited \"Joy\" would be a hit single.[11]\n\nIn 1974, Hayes was featured in the blaxploitation films Three Tough Guys and Truck Turner, and he recorded soundtracks for both. Tough Guys was almost devoid of vocals and Truck Turner yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score was eventually used by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in the Kill Bill film series and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show Jornal de Esportes on the Jovem Pan station.\n\nHBS (Hot Buttered Soul Records) and bankruptcy[]\n\nBy 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution. Hayes himself was deep in debt to Union Planters Bank, which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes' income and apply it towards his debts. Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through ABC Records. His new album, 1975's Chocolate Chip saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. \"I Can't Turn Around\" would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes' last album to chart top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all instrumental Disco Connection album fully embraced disco.\n\nIn 1976, the album cover of Juicy Fruit featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic \"Storm Is Over\". Later the same year the Groove-A-Thon album featured the singles \"Rock Me Easy Baby\" and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over $6 million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he'd written, performed, and produced.\n\nBasketball team ownership[]\n\nOn July 17, 1974, Hayes, along with Mike Storen, Avron Fogelman and Kemmons Wilson took over ownership of the American Basketball Association team the Memphis Tams.[12] The prior owner was Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Oakland A's baseball team. Hayes' group renamed the team the Memphis Sounds. Despite a 66% increase in home attendance, hiring well regarded coach Joe Mullaney and, unlike in the prior three seasons, making the 1975 ABA Playoffs (losing to the eventual champion Kentucky Colonels in the Eastern Division semifinals), the team's financial problems continued. The group was given a deadline of June 1, 1975 to sell 4,000 season tickets, obtain new investors and arrange a more favorable lease for the team at the Mid-South Coliseum. The group did not come through and the ABA took over the team, selling it to a group in Maryland that renamed the team the Baltimore Hustlers and then the Baltimore Claws before the club finally folded during preseason play for the 1975-1976 season.[13]\n\nPolydor and hiatus, film work, and the Duke of New York[]\n\nIn 1977, Hayes was back with a new deal with Polydor Records, a live album of duets with Dionne Warwick did moderately well, and his comeback studio album New Horizon sold better and enjoyed a hit single \"Out The Ghetto\", and also featured the popular \"It's Heaven To Me\".\n\n1978's For The Sake Of Love saw Hayes record a sequel to \"Theme from Shaft\" (\"Shaft II\"), but was most famous for the single \"Zeke The Freak\", a song that would have a shelf life of decades and be a major part of the House movement in the UK. The same year, Fantasy Records, which had bought out Stax Records, released an album of Hayes' non-album singles and archived recordings as a \"new\" album, Hotbed, in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Hayes returned to the Top 40 with Don't Let Go and its disco-styled title track that became a hit single (U.S. #18), and also featured the classic \"A Few More Kisses To Go\". Later in the year he added vocals and worked on Millie Jackson's album Royal Rappin's, and a song he co-wrote, \"Deja Vu\", became a hit for Dionne Warwick and won her a Grammy for best female R&B vocal.\n\nNeither 1980s And Once Again or 1981's Lifetime Thing produced notable songs or big sales, and Hayes chose to take a break from music to pursue acting.\n\nIn the 1970s, Hayes featured in the films Shaft (1971) and Truck Turner (1974); he also had a recurring role in the TV series The Rockford Files as an old cellmate of Rockford's, Gandolph Fitch (who always referred to Rockford as \"Rockfish\" much to his annoyance), including one episode alongside duet-partner Dionne Warwick. In the 1980s and 90s, he appeared in numerous films, notably Escape from New York (1981), I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), Prime Target (1991), and Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), as well as in episodes of The A-Team and Miami Vice. He also attempted a musical comeback, embracing the style of drum machines and synth for 1986s U-Turn and 1988s Love Attack, though neither proved successful. In 1991 he was featured in a duet with fellow soul singer Barry White on White's ballad \"Dark and Lovely (You Over There)\". In 1991 Hayes produced the still controversial \"Origin of the Feces\" for Type O Negative.\n\nReturn to fame and stardom[]\n\nIn 1995 Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating Isaac Hayes in the comedy series the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\n\nHayes launched a comeback on the Virgin label in May 1995 with Branded, an album of new material that earned impressive sales figures as well as positive reviews from critics who proclaimed it a return to form.[14] A companion album released around the same time, Raw and Refined, featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new.\n\nIn a rather unexpected career move shortly thereafter, Hayes charged back into the public consciousness as a founding star of Comedy Central's controversial — and wildly successful — animated TV series, South Park. Hayes provided the voice for the character of \"Chef\", the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show's debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef drew on Hayes's talents both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character's penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. An album of songs from the series appeared in 1998 with the title Chef Aid: The South Park Album[15] reflecting Chef's popularity with the show's fans, and the Chef song \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" became a number-one U.K. hit.[16] However, when South Park leaped to the big screen the following year with the smash animated musical South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Hayes/Chef was the only major character who did not perform a showcase song in the film; his lone musical contribution was \"Good Love,\" a track on the soundtrack album which originally appeared on Black Moses in 1971 and is not heard in the movie[17] (more on Chef below).\n\nIn 2000, Isaac Hayes appeared in the soundtrack of the French film \"The Magnet\" on the song \"Is It Really Home\" written and composed by rapper Akhenaton (IAM) and composer Bruno Coulais.\n\nHayes was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. The same year, a documentary highlighting Isaac's career and his impact on many of the Memphis artists in the 1960s onwards was produced, \"Only The Strong Survive\".\n\nIn 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tolok on the television series Stargate SG-1. The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film Hustle & Flow.\n\nScientology activism[]\n\nHayes joined Scientology around 1995. He contributed endorsement blurbs for many Scientology books. The frontispiece page for Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought (1997 paperback edition) quotes Hayes as saying \"If you really want to know about the mind, the spirit and life itself, read Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought. It will put you on the right path!\" In 1996, Hayes began hosting The Isaac Hayes and Friends Radio Show on WRKS in New York City. While there Hayes became a client of young vegan raw food chef, Elijah Joy and his company Organic Soul, Inc. Hayes also appears in the Scientology film Orientation.\n\nIn 1998 Hayes and fellow Scientologist entertainers Anne Archer, Chick Corea and Haywood Nelson attended the 30th anniversary of Freedom Magazine, the Church of Scientology's investigative news journal, at the National Press Club in Washington DC, to honor eleven human rights activists.[18]\n\nIn 2001, Hayes and Doug E. Fresh, another Scientologist musician, recorded a Scientology-inspired album called The Joy Of Creating – The Golden Era Musicians And Friends Play L. Ron Hubbard.[19]\n\nCharitable work[]\n\nThe Isaac Hayes Foundation was founded in 1999 by Hayes.[20]\n\nIn February 2006, Hayes appeared in a Youth for Human Rights International music video called \"United\". YHRI is a human rights group founded by the Church of Scientology.\n\nHayes was also involved in other human rights related groups such as the One Campaign. Isaac Hayes was crowned a king in Ghana for his humanitarian work and economic efforts on the country’s behalf.\n\nFamily[]\n\nHayes fathered 12 children, and had 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.[21] His fourth wife, Adjowa,[22] gave birth to a son named Nana Kwadjo Hayes on April 10, 2006.[23] One son is his namesake, Isaac Hayes III, known as rap producer Ike Dirty.\n\nHayes' first marriage, in 1960, ended in divorce.[24]\n\nHe married bank teller[citation needed] Mignon Harley on April 18, 1973, and they divorced in 1986; they had two children.[25] For her wedding gift, Hayes gave her a matching convertible Jaguar.[citation needed] The couple resided in a mansion with maid service. Hayes and his wife were forced into bankruptcy, owing over $6 million. Over the years, Isaac Hayes was able to recover financially.[26]\n\nHayes' eldest daughter is named Veronica,[27] and he also had a daughter named Heather Hayes.[28]\n\nStroke and death[]\n\nOn March 20, 2006, Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that Hayes had suffered a minor stroke in January.[29] Hayes' spokeswoman, Amy Harnell, denied that Hayes had a stroke,[30] but on October 26, 2006, Hayes himself confirmed that he had suffered a stroke.[31]\n\nTwo years later, Hayes was found unconscious in his home located just east of Memphis on August 10, 2008, as reported by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Department. A Shelby County Sheriff's deputy and an ambulance from Rural Metro responded to his home after his wife found him on the floor near a still-running treadmill. Hayes was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08pm.[32] Hayes was ten days from his 66th birthday.[1][33] The cause of death was not immediately clear,[34] though the area medical examiners later listed a recurrence of stroke as the cause of death.[33][35]\n\nHayes is buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“ God looked around his garden\n\nAnd he found an empty place\n\nHe then looked down upon this earth\n\nAnd found your star\n\nHe put his arms around you\n\nAnd lifted you to rest\n\nGod's garden is beautiful now\n\nHe always takes the best [...] „\n\n—INSCRIPTION ON ISAAC HAYES' GRAVE MARKER\n\nSouth Park[]\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Hayes gained new popularity as the voice of Chef on the Comedy Central animated television series South Park. Chef was a soul-singing cafeteria worker at the South Park kids' school. A song from the series performed by Chef, \"Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)\", received international radio airplay in 1999. It reached number-one on the UK singles chart and also on the Irish singles chart. The track also appeared on the album Chef Aid: The South Park Album in 1998.\n\nScientology episode[]\n\nIn the South Park episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", a satire of Scientology which aired on November 16, 2005, Hayes did not appear in his role as Chef. While appearing on the Opie and Anthony radio show about a month after the episode aired, Hayes was asked, \"What did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on Scientology?\" He replied, \"One thing about Matt and Trey, they lampoon everybody, and if you take that serious, I'll sell you the Brooklyn bridge for two dollars. That's what they do.\"\n\nIn an interview for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode. Hayes said that he told the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, \"Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?\"[citation needed] He then told them to take a couple of Scientology courses to understand what they do. In the interview, Hayes defended South Park's style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show's treatment of Scientology, but conceding that he \"understands what Matt and Trey are doing.\"[36]\n\nDeparture from South Park[]\n\nOn March 13, 2006, a statement was issued in Hayes' name, indicating that he was asking to be released from his contract with Comedy Central, citing recent episodes which satirized religious beliefs as being intolerant. \"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins,\" he was quoted in a press statement. The statement, however, did not directly mention Scientology. A response from Stone said that Hayes' complaints stemmed from the show's criticism of Scientology and that he \"has no problem – and he's cashed plenty of checks – with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons or Jews.\"[37][38] Stone adds, \"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\" Stone and Parker agreed to release Hayes from his contract by his request.\n\nOn March 20, 2006, Roger Friedman of Fox News reported having been told that the March 13 statement was made in Hayes' name, but not by Hayes himself. He wrote: \"Isaac Hayes did not quit South Park. My sources say that someone quit it for him. ... Friends in Memphis tell me that Hayes did not issue any statements on his own about South Park. They are mystified.\"[29] In 2007, the New York Post reported that Hayes felt Stone and Parker \"didn’t pay [him] enough\" and \"weren’t that nice.\"[39]\n\nThe South Park season 10 premiere (aired March 22, 2006) featured \"The Return of Chef\", a thinly veiled telling of the affair from Parker and Stone's point of view. Using sound clips from past episodes, it depicts Chef as having been brainwashed and urges viewers (via Kyle talking to the town) to \"remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song\" and not to blame Chef for his defection, but rather, as Kyle stated, \"be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains.\"\n\nAfter South Park[]\n\nHayes’ income was sharply reduced as a result of leaving South Park.[40] There followed announcements that he would be touring and performing. A reporter present at a January 2007 show in New York City, who had known Hayes fairly well, reported that \"Isaac was plunked down at a keyboard, where he pretended to front his band. He spoke-sang, and his words were halting. He was not the Isaac Hayes of the past.\"[40]\n\nIn April 2008, while a guest on The Adam Carolla Show, Hayes stumbled in his responses to questions – possibly as a result of health issues. A caller questioned whether Hayes was under the influence of a substance, and Carolla and co-host Teresa Strasser asked Hayes if he had ever used marijuana. After some confusion on what was being asked, Hayes replied that he had only ever tried it once. During the interview the radio hosts made light of Hayes' awkward answers, and replayed Hayes comments as sound drops – often simulating conversation with his co-hosts. Hayes stated during this interview that he was no longer on good terms with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.[41] Two months after his death, the South Park episode \"The China Probrem\" was dedicated to him.\n\nDuring the spring of 2008, Hayes shot scenes for a comedy about soul musicians inspired by the history of Stax Records entitled Soul Men, in which he appears as himself in a supporting role. His voice can be heard in the film in a voice-over role as Samuel L. Jackson, Bernie Mac, and Sharon Leal's characters are traveling through Memphis, Tennessee. His first actual appearance in the film is when he is shown in the audience clapping his hands as The Real Deal does a rendition of Hayes' 1971 hit song \"Do Your Thing.\" His next appearance consists of him entering The Real Deal's dressing room to wish them luck on their performance and shaking hands with Louis Hinds (played by Jackson) and Floyd Henderson (played by Mac). During this scene, Hayes also helps Hinds reunite with his long-lost daughter Cleo (played by Leal). His final appearance in the film consists of him introducing The Real Deal to the audience.[40] The film was released in November 7, 2008. At the premiere, Hayes' son Darius was briefly interviewed. Soul Men would also be Mac's final film, as he died the day before Hayes. The film was heavily edited to soften its tone as a tribute to the late stars.\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nYear Award Result Category Film, album, or song 1972 Academy Award Nominated Best Music, Original Dramatic Score Shaft Won Best Music, Original Song (For the song \"Theme from Shaft\") Shaft 1972 BAFTA Award Nominated Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music Shaft 1998 BMI Film & TV Award Won BMI TV Music Award Soul Man (Shared with David Porter) 1972 Golden Globe Award Nominated Best Original Song (For the song \"Theme from Shaft\") Shaft Won Best Original Score Shaft 1972 Grammy Award[42] Won Best Instrumental Arrangement (For the song \"Theme from Shaft\", arranged with Johnny Allen) Shaft Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special Shaft 1973 Best Pop Instrumental Performance By An Arranger, Composer, Orchestra and/or Choral Leader Black Moses 1999 NAACP Image Award Nominated Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series South Park 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award Nominated Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Hustle & Flow (Shared with cast)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Isaac Hayes discography\n\nTop Forty US and UK albums[]\n\n1969: Hot Buttered Soul (US #8)\n\n1970: The Isaac Hayes Movement (by The Isaac Hayes Movement, US #8)\n\n1970: ...To Be Continued (US #11)\n\n1971: Shaft (US #1)\n\n1971: Black Moses (US #10)\n\n1973: Joy (US #16)\n\n1973: Live at the Sahara Tahoe (US #14)\n\n1975: Chocolate Chip (US #18)\n\n1979: Don't Let Go (US #39)\n\nTop Forty US and UK singles[]\n\n1969: \"Walk On By\" (US #30)\n\n1969: \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" (US #37)\n\n1971: \"Theme from Shaft\" (US #1)\n\n1971: \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" (US #22)\n\n1972: \"Do Your Thing\" (US #30)\n\n1973: \"Joy\" (US #30)\n\n1980: \"Don't Let Go\" (US #18)\n\n1998: (as Chef) \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" (UK #1)\n\nSelected songwriting and production with David Porter[]\n\n1965: \"Candy\" by The Astors\n\n1965: \"You Don't Know Like I Know\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1966: \"Let Me Be Good to You\" by Carla Thomas\n\n1966: \"B-A-B-Y\" by Carla Thomas\n\n1966: \"Your Good Thing (Is About to End)\" by Mabel John(later a big hit by Lou Rawls) .\n\n1966: \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1967: \"When Something is Wrong with My Baby\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1967: \"Soul Man\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1968: \"I Thank You\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1969: \"So I Can Love You\" by The Emotions (production only)\n\n1969: \"The Sweeter He Is\" by The Soul Children\n\n1969: \"Soul Sister Brown Sugar\" by Sam & Dave\n\n1979: \"Deja Vu\" by Dionne Warwick (co-written by Hayes and Adrienne Anderson)\n\n2000: \"I Can't Go To Sleep\" by Wu-Tang Clan\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Other notes 1973 Wattstax Himself 1974 Three Tough Guys Lee Truck Turner Mac \"Truck\" Turner 1976 It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time Moriarty 1976–1977 The Rockford Files Gandolph Fitch TV, 3 episodes 1981 Escape from New York The Duke 1985 The A-Team C.J.
