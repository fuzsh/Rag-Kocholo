        "text": "Soul singer Isaac Hayes - who wrote the Shaft film soundtrack - died after being found unconscious by his wife beside a running treadmill at his home, it was revealed today.\n\nThe 65-year-old, who won an Oscar for the theme to the hit 70s movie as well as three Grammy awards, was taken to hospital but pronounced dead an hour later.\n\nHis death will be mourned by legions of fans as well as his 12 children, 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\n'Isaac Hayes embodies everything that's soul music' said Collin Stanback, an executive from the singer's record label, Stax.\n\nThe black icon, whose work paved the way for disco and rap, won a new generation of fans in 1997 when he became the voice of Chef in South Park.\n\nHayes was discovered by his fourth wife Adjowa and young son Nana Kwadjo after they returned fom a shopping trip and found him collapsed in a downstairs bedroom of his home in Memphis.\n\n'The treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor,' police spokesman Steve Shular said.\n\nThe cause of death was not immediately known.\n\nHowever he has in the past suffered from health problems that included a stroke.\n\nHayes was responsible for one of the most iconic soundtracks in film history, the score for the 1971 blaxploitation film 'Shaft'.\n\nHis shaven-headed, gold-laden ghetto look made him a black cultural icon.\n\nHayes hit the top of the UK singles chart as Chef from South Park with novelty song Chocolate Salty Balls\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hayes laid the groundwork for disco and what is now known as 'urban' music whilst paving the way for artists like Barry White and Millie Jackson\n\nThe driving force behind the influential Stax record label, he also rapped even before the term was coined.\n\nBut nowadays Hayes, who was an outspoken Scientologist, is best known for his self-parodying role in the cult US TV Series South Park.\n\nHe did the voice-over for the character Chef, the school cook and ladies' man, and scored a No.1 hit with the tongue-in-cheek song Chocolate Salty Balls.\n\nHowever Hayes quit the show after an episode which ridiculed Scientology, claiming his religious beliefs should be 'respected and honoured'.\n\nHayes was born in 1942 in a tin shack in Covington, Tennessee, 40 miles north of Memphis.\n\nHe was raised by his maternal grandparents after his mother died and his father left when he was one-and-a-half.\n\nA self-taught musician, Hayes wanted to be a doctor, but found a new direction when he won a talent contest in ninth grade.\n\nHe held down various low-paying jobs, including shining shoes on the legendary Beale Street in Memphis and played gigs in rural Southern bars where at times he had to dive to the floor because someone has started shooting.\n\nIn 1964 he was hired by Stax Records of Memphis as a backup pianist, working as a session musician for Otis Redding and others.\n\nHe began writing songs, establishing a partnership with David Porter, and in the 1960s they penned soul classics for Sam and Dave, such as Soul Man, Hold On! I'm a Coming and When Something is Wrong With My Baby.\n\nHayes himself became a star when he released Hot Buttered Soul in 1969, not least because of his striking image of shaven head, gold chains and sunglasses,\n\nNext came Theme From Shaft, from the film Shaft starring Richard Roundtree as no-nonsense New York cop John Shaft.\n\nThe irresistibly urgent mix of wah-wah guitars and hi-hat cymbals were spiced by the famous line, 'They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother-/Shut your mouth!\n\n'That was like the shot heard round the world,' Hayes said in one interview.\n\nAt the Oscar ceremony in 1972, Hayes performed the song wearing an eye-popping amount of gold and received a standing ovation.\n\nHis personal life was just as flamboyant: he was married four times, was a father of 12, with fourteen grandchildren and three great grandchildren.\n\nIn total Hayes won three Grammy awards, two for the Shaft soundtrack and a third for his album 'Black Moses', which spawned the nickname he reluctantly accepted.\n\nHayes was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nHe also owned a basketball team, was involved in humanitarian work in Ghana and appeared in more than 60 cinema and TV films, including the blaxploitation parody I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka.\n\nIt was his readiness to send himself up that led him to accept the role of 'Chef' in South Park in 1997.\n\nBut Hayes angrily quit the show in 2006 after an episode mocked his Scientology belief and its celebrity followers, including actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\nIn the episode, Stan, one of the show's four mischievous school kids, is hailed as a saviour by Scientology leaders, while a cartoon Cruise locks himself in a closet and refuses to come out.\n\nHayes was criticised for not taking such a stand when religions were mocked.\n\nHowever he said: \"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins.\""
