        "text": "Issac Hayes was and is a soul genius. His music lit up the 1970s. He helped create unity and peace in America, and touched the hearts of those who followed his wonderful music and career. To me Issac Hayes was an icon, one to be admired for his enormous talent, and his message of love to all humankind. For myself, everytime I listen to his music I am transplanted and reinvigorated by Issac Hayes, because he was so very profound in the feelings he was able to elict in his music. I was very deeply saddened to hear of his loss to humanity, and I just say peace brother may you rest in eternal sleep.\n\nI only knew Isaac from being Chef in South Park and he made the show one of my favourites. I have many South Park sound tracks and Chef sang many songs that featured on them and listening to them always brings a smile to my face. I will sadly miss such a colourful and talented character.\n\nIssac Hayes has influenced my black music for the past 30 plus years, my favorities Album is Issac and Dione, soulful music.\n\nHe has given so much to the music and entertainment world, we all miss him.\n\nLiverpool black community radio program, BBC Merseyside will dedicate one hour of its show to look at Isaac's life and music.\n\nThe program is called The Upfront show, its goes out every Sat for 2 hours, a magazine program, producer James Klass, Garrick Prayogg is a member of the show, who deals with community and educational matters affecting black people and its culture, local national and international. Issac's music will live on just like Bob Marley and others.\n\nIsaac Hayes thanks for the soulful memories the passion of By the time I get to Phoenix & I stand accused to the gentle ballads Walk on by The look of Love & the unforgettable Cafe Reggio & Shaft.I think my life was a little richer carrying the music of Isaac Hayes in my memory.\n\nThank You & enjoy the rest\n\nMr Hayes (The Number 1 Soul Brother), you inspired me so much, like myself coming from humble beginnings and forever aiming high, has always helped me stay focused on achieving my dreams no matter what people say, think or do, so for that I thank you. To the Hayes family, may God watch over you through these difficult times. Showing Love from the UK. (Heaven just got Soul!!)"
