        "text": "December 30, 1928 - June 2, 2008\n\nBo Diddley, a musical pioneer whose songs blended Rhythm & Blues with his thumping beat to create a new style of rock music, has died at age 79 of heart failure a few months after suffering a stroke while on tour in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n\nBorn Otha Ellas Bates in McComb, Mississippi, he later took the name McDaniel after being adopted by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, who moved the family to Chicago. In the blues clubs on the south side of Chicago,\n\nThe origin of the name \"Bo Diddley\" is uncertain. He may have received the nickname as a teenager when he was a Golden Gloves boxer. Another story suggests that he picked the name himself in reference to a \"diddley bow\" - a one string homemade guitar popular in the Mississippi delta. A third story suggests that he was named Bo Diddley in late 1954 by Billy Boy Arnold when he teamed up him and recorded demos of \"I'm a Man\" and \"Bo Diddley.\"\n\nBo Diddley appeared on the Ed Sullivan show in 1955. He was asked to play \"Sixteen Tons\", a song made popular by Tennessee Ernie Ford. Without telling Mr. Sullivan, he instead played his signature song \"Bo Diddley\" instead. Mr. Sullivan was furious and told Diddley that he would never work in television again. It was 10 years before Bo Diddley again appeared on network television.\n\nHe continued to pen hits through the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Pretty Thing\", \"Say Man\" and \"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover.\" He released a series of albums including the classic Bo Diddley is a Gunslinger.\n\nDiddley played with many of with rock's giants. In 1963, he toured the UK with the Every Brothers and Little Richard. His was the opening act for the Clash on their 1979 tour and was a guest on stage with the Rolling Stones. On August 25, 1972, Bo Diddley played with the Grateful Dead at the Academy of Music in New York City. A recording from this show was released on Dick's Picks volume 30.\n\nBo Diddley appeared in the 1983 movie Trading Places, playing the role of Louis Winthorpe. He also had a cameo in the Blues Brothers 2000 movie. In the 1980s, he filmed the \"Bo Knows\" Nike television commercials with Bo Jackson, saying his one line \"Bo, you don't know Diddley!\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mr. Diddley moved to New Mexico and became a deputy sheriff in the town of Los Lunas. Most recently, Bo was living on his 76 acre farm in Archer, Florida (near Gainesville).\n\nBo Diddley played distinctive, rectangular-bodied guitars. He made his first such guitar by taking the neck and electronics from a Gretsch guitar and attaching them to a rectangular body he made. He called this his \"Twang Machine.\" In 1958, he asked Gretsch to build a guitar to his specifications. Gretsch sold the guitar as a limited-edition model called the \"Big B\".\n\nBo was upset that he never received the financial rewards he felt he deserved from his work. He felt the record companies cheated him out of royalties he deserved. He was bothered that other musicians borrowed his \"Bo Diddley\" beat (three strokes/rest/two strokes). He was, however, revered by those that learned from him. He was a hero to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nBo Diddley received numerous awards and accolades. He was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and also received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 1998.\n\n05/23/200873U Utah PhillipsfolksingerHeart FailureNevada City, California"
