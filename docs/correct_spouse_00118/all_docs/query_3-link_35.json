        "text": "They came in different colors and faiths, dressed in tailored suits and jean shorts, African robes and motorcycle garb; they came as family, friends, and fans, but they all came to say goodbye to Isaac Hayes.\n\nA crowd of more than 2,000 people filled Cordova's Hope Presbyterian Church on Monday as part of a three-hour memorial service. The legendary Stax songwriter and performer died on Aug. 10 at the age of 65, the result of an apparent stroke.\n\nThe public service followed a private ceremony on Sunday at Memorial Park, attended by close family and friends, including Hollywood heavyweights Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise, Wesley Snipes and John Singleton.\n\nAs the mourners entered the halls of Hope Presbyterian just before 11 a.m., they were greeted by a collection of vivid floral arrangements, including ones in the shape of Stax Records' familiar snapping-fingers logo, and another modeled after Hayes' famed custom Cadillac El Dorado.\n\nThe audience included an array of music industry notables like rapper Chuck D., funk artist Bootsy Collins, Earth Wind & Fire leader Maurice White, as well as Hayes' friends, Stax labelmates, and fellow Scientologists, all of whom sang the praises of a man whose career honors included a shelf full of awards, and a profound connection to his community.\n\nThe event began with a troupe of African drummers heralding the arrival of Hayes' loved ones: his wife, Adjowa, and his family, which includes 12 children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nThe event, hosted by fellow Stax legend William Bell, was dubbed \"A Celebration\" of Hayes' life\n\nThe day's first guest, Rev. Al Sharpton, touted Hayes' deep dedication to his roots. \"Isaac came from our culture,\" thundered Sharpton. \"He was us and we were him, and he never stopped being us.\"\n\nRev. Jesse Jackson picked up Sharpton's theme, tracing Hayes' remarkable journey from the farms and fields of Covington to the glittering lights of the world stage. \"We measure Isaac by the distance he traveled ... from picking cotton to picking up Oscars,\" said Jackson. \"He came further and did more.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, noting the presence of numerous lawmakers and elected officials in attendance -- including U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton and Tennessee House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh -- discussed resolutions already in the works both locally and nationally to honor Hayes. And Cohen envisioned an even grander tribute: \"How does the 'Isaac Hayes Memphis International Airport' sound?\" asked Cohen, the room erupting in cheers as he added, \"Can you dig it?\n\nPerhaps the most touching speech came from a representative of Hayes' Ghanaian \"family,\" Princess Asie Ocansey. Hayes, an honorary king in Ghana (known by his royal name Nene Katey Ocansey), had dedicated much of his philanthropic efforts over the past two decades to Africa. The Princess spoke of Hayes' humanitarian work in the country: of building a school and literacy center, of his deep commitment to bring health education and medical care to its citizens.\n\n\"He stood for love itself,\" she said, adding that the learning center in Ghana will be renamed in Hayes' honor and that the country will mark his life with a massive celebration in the fall.\n\nWhile much was said about Hayes the man, it was former Stax Records executive Al Bell who provided the most salient observations about his music. He praised Hayes voice, that famed \"bedroom baritone,\" but added that his music had great depth and power. Bell noted how his songs were able to \"evoke a candle flickering in the dark ... the raw funk of the streets ... as well as the rhythm of a social movement.\"\n\nThere was ample music provided as part of the ceremony, as local saxophonist Kirk Whalum, R&B singer Little G, and jazz pianist Chick Corea performed. Even hip-hop pioneer and \"human beat box\" Doug E. Fresh delivered an impromptu rap about Hayes, a man he deemed a \"master of creativity.\"\n\nHayes' religion, Scientology -- which has been the subject of mild controversy in recent years -- was addressed throughout the ceremony. A cadre of Hollywood Scientologists -- including actors Kelly Preston, Anne Archer and Michael D. Roberts -- spoke of the singer's dedication to the faith and his activism on behalf of religious rights.\n\nHayes' songwriting partner David Porter tried to sum up the depth of his bond with Hayes, his friend for nearly 50 years, \"but it's hard to really tell you what's in my heart,\" said Porter.\n\nFittingly, it was the sound of Hayes' music blaring from the speakers -- his own songs and the many hits he crafted for others -- that served as the event's valediction, sending the crowd out of the church and into the late afternoon sun.\n\nsource"
