        "text": "Isaac Hayes and his wife are the parents of a baby boy, the couple announced Tuesday.\n\nNana Kwadjo Hayes was born April 10 and weighed 8 pounds, 5 ounces, spokesman Rob Moore said.\n\nIn the Ghanaian language, Nana means “King,” and Kwadjo (pronounced “Kwo-Jo”) means “boy born on Monday.”\n\nIn 1992, Hayes was coronated an honorary king of the Ada district of Ghana for his humanitarian work.\n\nKwadjo is Hayes’ fourth son and the first with wife Adjowa.\n\nThe 63-year-old soul singer and actor is best known for his recordings with Stax Records in Memphis and his 1971 No. 1 hit “Theme From Shaft,” from the Richard Roundtree film “Shaft.” The soundtrack also won the Oscar for best musical score.\n\nMore recently, he was the voice of the character Chef on the TV show “South Park,” until he quit the role in a disagreement over the show’s treatment of his faith, Scientology."
