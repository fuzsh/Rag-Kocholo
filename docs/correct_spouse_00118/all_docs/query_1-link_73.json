        "text": "â€” He was too young to go inside then, but Wayne Jackson stood in the parking lot of the Plantation Inn and listened to the sounds of the blues and R&B of the 1950s and '60s that wafted outside.\n\nIt was enough to inspire Jackson, now 68, to forge a successful career in music as a trumpet player, blowing his horn on such classic hits as Otis Redding's \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" Elvis Presley's \"In the Ghetto\" and Wilson Pickett's \"Mustang Sally.\"\n\nJackson and several other musicians, along with West Memphis leaders, returned to the parking lot at Martin Luther King Drive and Broadway on Tuesday to honor the club's role in the musical heritage of the Arkansas Delta.\n\nAt first it appeared the musicians would resume singing the blues when raindrops began pelting the area, threatening the event. Umbrellas popped up and the 50 who attended quickly huddled under a large tent on the parking lot. But the sun suddenly appeared, and the rain stopped as the ceremony began.\n\nOfficials soon unveiled a large marker on the southwest corner of the parking lot at 3600 E. Broadway that highlights the ritzy club's history.\n\n\"We had the chance to hear some of the greatest music in the world,\" Jackson said Tuesday during the ceremony. \"It drug me across the Mississippi River [to Memphis] to be part of it.\n\n\"The Plantation Inn was a big part of what my life is,\" said Jackson, who now lives in Nashville, Tenn., and was nominated to the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame last year.\n\nThe marker is the first of a series planned that will point out musically significant spots in 15 counties in east Arkansas. Called the Arkansas Soil and Soul Musical Heritage Trail, it is sponsored by the Arkansas Delta Byways and the Rural Heritage Development Initiative.\n\nIt will be a means of enhancing the area's economy through tourism, said Sarah Christian, director of the West Memphis Advertising and Promotion Commission.\n\n\"We're the gateway to the Arkansas Musical Heritage Trail,\" she said of West Memphis. \"This is where things started musically. Our juke joints are gone now, but we're making something visual.\"\n\nOther musical spots include Helena-West Helena, Brinkley and other Delta towns that were instrumental in developing blues and rhythm and blues music, she said.\n\nMorris Berger and his wife, Clemie Berger, opened the Plantation Inn in a former gambling hall in 1943. It boasted what locals claimed was the largest dance floor in the South and featured such musicians as Calvin Newborn, Willie Mitchell, Floyd Newman and Isaac Hayes. The Plantation Inn was a respected nightclub, said West Memphis Mayor Bill Johnson, who remembers hearing music there as a teenager.\n\n\"Morris had a way,\" Johnson said of the slick, mustachioed owner Tuesday. \"He had a charm about him.\n\n\"The Plantation Inn was clean, well-run and safe,\" Johnson said. \"We couldn't get into the other clubs in West Memphis. If you did, you'd either get tossed out or get your head beaten in.\"\n\nThe club also served as a hub for after-hours jam sessions with performers from the Memphis hotels and from Beale Street.\n\n\"We were shocked and amazed at what a rich musical heritage we found in this area,\" said Ruth Hawkins, the director of the Arkansas Delta Byways, which promotes tourism in northeast Arkansas.\n\nHawkins and students from Arkansas State University researched the musical roots of the Delta for the past three years and located several spots for future signs and markers, she said.\n\n\"This region plays such a prominent part in music,\" she said.\n\nBrenda Berger O'Brien, the daughter of Morris and Clemie Berger, grew up in West Memphis and spent many of her childhood days in the club. She remembers dancing alone on the large dance floor when no one else was in the club.\n\n\"I loved it,\" said O'Brien, who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla. \"It separated me from some of the other families growing up, but I loved it.\"\n\nShe called the honoring of the Plantation Inn \"heaven\" and said she was pleased the club is being recognized.\n\n\"My family would be very proud,\" she said.\n\nAdjowa Hayes, 38, Isaac Hayes' widow, said her husband often told her of the Plantation Inn. Hayes died at his Memphis home on Aug. 10.\n\n\"I know what this would have meant to him,\" she said. \"I wish he was here to see this.\"\n\nMorris and Clemie Berger closed the club in 1964 and converted the building into a Mexican restaurant, which still stands.\n\n\"It was a friendly place,\" Jackson said after the unveiling of the marker. \"It was like no other night club. Others were itching to get your money. The Bergers were part of our families in West Memphis.\n\n\"The music I heard here was the finest in the world,\" he said."
