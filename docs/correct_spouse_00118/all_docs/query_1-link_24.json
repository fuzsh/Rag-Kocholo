        "text": "Associated Press\n\nIsaac Hayes has left his estate to his wife, Adjowa, his children and the Isaac Hayes Foundation, which promotes literacy, music and nutrition, according to his will.\n\nThe will was filed last week in probate court in Memphis, Tenn. The Commercial Appeal in Memphis reported the value and contents of Hayes’ estate hasn’t been filed.\n\nPart of Hayes’ humanitarian work included building a school in Ghana.\n\nThe deep-voiced soul singer died Aug. 10. Hayes, 65, was found unconscious at his Memphis residence."
