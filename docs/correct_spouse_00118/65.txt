Isaac and Adjowa Hayes are welcoming their first child: a baby boy.

Hayes spokesman Rob Moore says Nana Kwadjo Hayes was born April 10 and weighed 8 pounds, 5 ounces.

In the Ghanaian language, Nana means "King," and Kwadjo (pronounced "Kwo-Jo") means "boy born on Monday."

In 1992, Hayes was crowned as an honorary king of the Ada district of Ghana for his humanitarian work.

Kwadjo is Hayes' fourth son and the first with wife Adjowa.

The 63-year-old soul singer and actor is best known for his recordings with Stax Records in Memphis and his 1971 No. 1 hit "Theme From Shaft," from the Richard Roundtree film "Shaft." The soundtrack also won the Oscar for best musical score.
