        "text": "The day dawned bright and sunny and by the start of play at 6pm the pitch at Riding Mill looked resplendent and ready for an epic encounter. The pitch looked good… but as we were quickly to discover, after weeks of rain the wicket was soft: it had as much life and bounce as a Pennine peat bog.\n\nYour correspondent opened the bowling for the Mallards and in the first over the ball scuttled through at ankle level, surprising Durham’s opener, Vinay, and just missing the wicket on several occasions. Bowling from the other end, Peter Bell found much the same pudding awaiting him. No wickets so far.\n\nBy the third over, Vinay was now prepared and he unleashed a volley of boundaries – two fours and a six – much to your correspondent’s chagrin. (I have since reported this episode to Northumbria Police for torture of an aged pensioner!) Vinay kept up the assault, battering Peter next, before retiring on 30 in the fourth over. He was replaced by Durham’s No. 3 Rory, who promptly came and went – bowled first ball by one that turned by yours truly (partial compensation for the previous torture!).\n\nReturning Mallard Ian Watson took up the bowling from Peter, spending a little time to find his line, and then next to start firing was Si Holland. Not exactly firing – more looping tosses – but this was just the ticket on an unresponsive wicket. That, plus some heroic diving to left and right from a certain very un-Mallardian fielder, meant only singles were now being conceded. Durham’s run rate began to slow down – slowing even more when Si hit the stumps of Durham’s Guy Paxman with an even slower delivery.\n\nStep up next the un-Mallardian fielder concerned: Martin Nichols. Who? Martin Nichols. Who? Martin Nichols…the name rang out several times around the field. Who was this man, dressed in what can only be described as charity shop hand-me-downs? This appearance, combined with earlier tigerish exploits in the field and a loping run-in to bowl his first ball, must have unsettled Durham’s batsman Root since he swept the incoming missile and gave a catch to Dave Cox at mid-wicket. A couple of dots later and Martin had the next batsman run out and then, to complete his over, Martin’s following ball saw the new-man-in give a mighty heave, miss and lose his middle stump. Three wickets in one over – wow!\n\nAs if the run-rate was not slow enough, Mallards’ captain and secret weapon Lee Latif was next to bowl – he who is difficult to get away on the best of days, let alone on a wicket as soft as a jam sponge. Several dots followed and then LBW; followed in Lee’s next over by a stumping. Hooray! Durham batsmen were falling like dominos.\n\nMallards’ new recruit Robert Nyenhuis – allegedly from South Africa by way of the USA – was next in attack and he impressed with some scorching deliveries. Keeper Ankush meanwhile enjoyed himself behind with the gloves – even more when he delivered the next stumping. Dave Cox and Robert delivered the last two overs against determined tailenders but with Mallards equally determined in the field the final Durham score reached just 104: not the highest total after a whirlwind start.\n\nNow it must be said that the Mallards are so named for good reason. Many is the time in the past when defeat has been snatched from victory as our stalwart batsmen lose their focus, and their stumps, to opposition of often questionable stature. And Durham are no pushover. So as Ankush and Ed Holland went out to face the best that could be thrown against them the required target on a poor wicket was not going to be easy. Durham pace bowlers Vinay and Theo opened with cruise missiles – not that our valiant Vikings were worried. Ankush immediately set about hoisting the ball in all directions. A little slower to start but Ed was no slouch either. Both openers rapidly advanced the score, until Ankush had to retire on 30.\n\nThen the slow bowlers came on: Mike Costello and Nigel Metcalfe. Oh dear! Ankush’s replacement Aayush found it hard going and Ed was reduced to scampering singles; boundaries being frustratingly infrequent. Ed was subsequently bowled by Nigel off a real mortar bomb of a ball, he left the field on 22, to be replaced by Dave Cox, who soon after suffered the same fate.\n\nLee was next in, the Durham bowlers switched to Rory – pushing through at pace – and then Sid, who removed Lee with his first ball – a fierce off spin.\n\nBut by this time the Mallards were into the 80s and South African supremo Robert was on strike. Boundaries returned as Robert waved the willow in all directions. Up to the nineties.\n\nTwo overs to go, ten runs needed and the opening bowlers were brought back. Aayush was promptly bowled by Theo. Martin came in and pushed a single. Rob swung mightily, gained a four and then was caught way out in the deep going for another [by one of the greatest catches you will ever see – Ed].\n\nLast over, four runs needed to win; Peter and Martin at the crease. A single, two dots, another single and Peter becalmed. Two balls left; two runs needed. Surely Mallards would not fail at the very last hurdle?\n\nWould you believe it – Vinay bowls a wide on the penultimate ball and our batsmen run the distance: victory is ours!\n\nCongratulations to all for an excellent, nail-biting result, a real team effort where everyone played their part, and particularly to our two newcomers, Martin and Robert. We look forward to having you with us for future victories!"
