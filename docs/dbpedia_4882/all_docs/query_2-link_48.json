        "text": "The 7 habits have become famous and are integrated into everyday thinking by millions and millions of people. Why? Because they work!\n\nWith Sean Covey?s added takeaways on how the habits can be used in our modern age, the wisdom of the 7 habits will be refreshed for a new generation of leaders.\n\nThey include:\n\nHabit 1: Be Proactive\n\nHabit 2: Begin with the End in Mind\n\nHabit 3: Put First Things First\n\nHabit 4: Think Win/Win\n\nHabit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood\n\nHabit 6: Synergise\n\nHabit 7: Sharpen the Saw\n\nThis beloved classic presents a principle-centered approach for solving both personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and practical anecdotes, Stephen R. Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, honesty, and human dignity – principles that give us the security to adapt to change and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates.\n\nIn The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.\n\nISBN: 9781847946249\n\nPublisher: RANDOM HOUSE\n\nSubtitle: WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO AND HOW TO CHANGE\n\nAuthor: CHARLES DUHIGG\n\nSHORTLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2019\n\n‘Expect vibrant, vivid and eye-opening descriptions of Middle Eastern life propelled by a tender storyline, all in Shafak’s haunting, beautiful and considered prose’ Vanity Fair\n\n‘Incredibly sensuous and poetic and evocative’ Pandora Sykes, The High Low\n\n‘Richly uplifting… truly beautiful writing’ Nicola Sturgeon\n\n‘In the first minute following her death, Tequila Leila’s consciousness began to ebb, slowly and steadily, like a tide receding from the shore…’\n\nFor Leila, each minute after her death recalls a sensuous memory: spiced goat stew, sacrificed by her father to celebrate the birth of a yearned-for son; bubbling vats of lemon and sugar to wax women’s legs while men are at prayer; the cardamom coffee she shares with a handsome student in the brothel where she works.

Volcanic eruptions, solar activities, atmospheric, oceanic and other shifts, as well as anthropogenic behaviour, are fundamental parts of the past and the present. In this magnificent and groundbreaking book, we learn about the origins of our species: about the development of religion and language and their relationships with the environment; about how the desire to centralise agricultural surplus formed the origins of the bureaucratic state; about how growing demands for harvests resulted in the increased shipment of enslaved peoples; about how efforts to understand and manipulate the weather have a long and deep history. All provide lessons of profound importance as we face a precarious future of rapid global warming.\n\nISBN: 9781526622556\n\nPublisher: BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING\n\nSubtitle: AN UNTOLD HISTORY\n\nAuthor: PETER FRANKOPAN\n\nA panoramic history of the Muslim world from the age of the Prophet Mu?ammad to the birth of the modern era\n\nThis book describes and explains the major events, personalities, conflicts, and convergences that have shaped the history of the Muslim world. The body of the book takes readers from the origins of Islam to the eve of the nineteenth century, and an epilogue continues the story to the present day. Michael Cook thus provides a broad history of a civilization remarkable for both its unity and diversity.\n\nAfter setting the scene in the Middle East of late antiquity, the book depicts the rise of Islam as one of the great black swan events of history. It continues with the spectacular rise of the Caliphate, an empire that by the time it broke up had nurtured the formation of a new civilization. It then goes on to cover the diverse histories of all the major regions of the Muslim world, providing a wide-ranging account of the key military, political, and cultural developments that accompanied the eastward and westward spread of Islam from the Middle East to the shores of the Atlantic and the Pacific.\n\nAt the same time, A History of the Muslim World contains numerous primary-source quotations that expose the reader to a variety of acutely insightful voices from the Muslim past.\n\nISBN: 9780691236575\n\nPublisher: PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS\n\nSubtitle: FROM ITS ORIGINS TO THE DAWN OF MODERNITY\n\nAuthor: MICHAEL COOK\n\nFROM THE BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF MY SEDITIOUS HEART AND THE MINISTRY OF UTMOST HAPPINESS, A NEW AND PRESSING DISPATCH FROM THE HEART OF THE CROWD AND THE SOLITUDE OF A WRITER S DESK\n\nThe chant of Azadi! – Urdu for Freedom! – is the slogan of the freedom struggle in Kashmir against what Kashmiris see as the Indian Occupation. Ironically, it also became the chant of millions on the streets of India against the project of Hindu Nationalism.\n\nEven as Arundhati Roy began to ask what lay between these two calls for Freedom – a chasm or a bridge? – the streets fell silent. Not only in India, but all over the world. The Coronavirus brought with it another, more terrible understanding of Azadi, making a nonsense of international borders, incarcerating whole populations, and bringing the modern world to a halt like nothing else ever could.\n\nIn this series of electrifying essays, Arundhati Roy challenges us to reflect on the meaning of freedom in a world of growing authoritarianism.\n\nThe essays include meditations on language, public as well as private, and on the role of fiction and alternative imaginations in these disturbing times. The pandemic, she says, is a portal between one world and another. For all the illness and devastation it has left in its wake, it is an invitation to the human race, an opportunity, to imagine another world.\n\nISBN: 9780241996782\n\nPublisher: PENGUIN BOOKS\n\nSubtitle: FASCISM, FICTION AND FREEDOM IN THE TIME OF THE VIRUS – EXPANDED EDITION\n\nAuthor: ARUNDHATI ROY\n\nThe international best-selling author explores the revolutions-past and present-that define the chaotic, polarized and unstable age in which we live\n\nPopulist rage, ideological fracture, economic and technological shocks, geopolitical dangers and an international system studded with catastrophic risk – the early decades of the 21st century may be one of the most revolutionary periods in modern history. But they are not the first. Humans have lived, and thrived, through more than one great realignment. What makes an age a revolutionary one? And how do they end?\n\nIn this major new work, Fareed Zakaria masterfully investigates eras that have shattered and shaped humanity. Four such periods hold profound lessons for today. First, in seventeenth-century Netherlands a series of transformations made that tiny land the richest in the world – and created modern politics as we know it today. The ?Glorious Revolution? in Britain showed that major political change could happen peacefully. Next, the French Revolution, a dramatic decade and a half that devoured its ideological children and left a bloody legacy that haunts us to this day. Finally, the mother of all revolutions, the Industrial Revolution, which catapulted Britain and the U.S. to global dominance and created the modern world. Against these paradigm-shifting historical eras, Zakaria describes our current situation, unpacking the four revolutions we are living through now; in globalization, technology, identity, and geopolitics.\n\nAs few public intellectuals can, Zakaria combines intellectual range, deep historical insight, and uncanny prescience to reframe and illuminate a turbulent present.\n\nISBN: 9780241692417\n\nPublisher: ALLEN LANE\n\nSubtitle: PROGRESS AND BACKLASH FROM 1600 TO THE PRESENT\n\nAuthor: FAREED ZAKARIA\n\nA deeply moving and unforgettable portrait of an ordinary and yet an extraordinary teenage girl. First published over sixty years ago, Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl has reached millions of young people throughout the world.\n\nIn July 1942, thirteen-year-old Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the occupation, went into hiding in an Amsterdam warehouse. Over the next two years Anne vividly describes in her diary the frustrations of living in such close quarters, and her thoughts, feelings and longings as she grows up. Her diary ends abruptly when, in August 1944, they were all betrayed.\n\nSince its publication in 1947, The Diary of a Young Girl has been read by tens of millions of people, now reissued with a fresh new cover to mark what would have been Anne Frank’s 90th birthday in June 2019.\n\nISBN: 9780141315188\n\nPublisher: PENGUIN\n\nSubtitle:\n\nAuthor: ANNA FRANK\n\nA sweeping journey through the ebbs and flows of Pakistan s history, from the ancient Indus Valley Civilization to contemporary times, this book not only uncovers the influences from Turkey, Persia, Arabia and Britain that have shaped this South Asian nation, but showcases the region s diverse, rich tapestry of peoples, and Pakistan s pluralistic, multicultural society. Chequered Past, Uncertain Future also describes the post-1947 shift – following the partition of India and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as the country became more religiously conservative and autocratic, intensifying sectarian and ethnic divisions. For most of the country s history, the people of Pakistan have found themselves under the control of military dictators who suppress civil liberties and freedom of speech and action a trend that persists today.\n\nISBN: 9789696403043\n\nPublisher: ILQA PUBLICATIONS\n\nSubtitle: THE HISTORY OF PAKISTAN\n\nAuthor: TAHIR KAMRAN\n\nThis book examines closely many of the unquestioned assumptions by which we live our lives, comparing them with the beliefs that have shaped and guided human life in the past. It begins with a consideration of how secular societies attempt to possess their citizens, body and soul and how, as a consequence, the necessity of redefining human responsibility becomes an ever more urgent imperative. The book continues with a presentation of the traditional view of man as ‘God’s Viceroy on Earth’, with an eye to its practical implications in a world that has all but forgotten, under the pressure of mass social persuasion, that man must always be free to choose his own ultimate destiny. The author’s thesis is a passionate yet incisive plea for the restoration of the sacred norms of religion, as against the debilitating and falsifying aims of a profane world-view based on no more than recent scientific and technological achievements.\n\nISBN: 9789696402053\n\nPublisher: ILQA PUBLICATIONS\n\nSubtitle: CHOICE AND RESPOSIBILITY IN THE MODERN WORLD\n\nAuthor: GAI EATON\n\nFyodor Karamazov is found dead one night. An epicurean and a compulsory liar, he was not a good father either. Therefore, his death raises the question of parricide. It could be any of his sons, as all seem to have their own reasons to get rid of him. It could be anybody else too. But who? The Brothers Karamazov is a superb murder mystery. This is, however, just one of its qualities and merely the opening of an impassable labyrinth. Not only does Dostoyevsky skilfully initiate in it profound philosophical and theological debates, exploring themes such as the existence of God, free will, and the nature of evil but he also deeply examines the conflict between human freedom and divine authority.\n\nOne of the best novels in history, The Brothers Karamazov is a rich and thought-provoking exploration of faith, doubt, and the human condition, leaving readers with profound questions about the essence of life and morality. Serialized in The Russian Messenger in 1879 and 1880, it was published in the book form a few months before Dostoyevsky s death in February 1881.\n\nISBN: 9786275100560\n\nPublisher: READINGS\n\nSubtitle:\n\nAuthor: FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY\n\nIn this poignant and meditative collection of short stories. Zubair Ahmad captures the lives and experiences of the people of the Punjab, a region divided between India and Pakistan. In an intimate narrative style, Ahmad writes a world that hovers between memory and imagination. home and abroad. The narrator follows the pull of his subconscious, shifting between past and present, recalling different eras of Lahore s neighbourhoods and the communities that define them. These stories evoke the complex realities of post-colonial Pakistani Punjab. The contradictions of this region s history reverberate through the stories, evident in the characters. their circumstances, and sometimes their erasure. Skillfully translated from Punjabi by Anne Murphy, this collection is an essential contribution to the wider recognition of the Punjabi language and its literature.\n\nISBN: 9789696402527\n\nPublisher: ILQA PUBLICATIONS\n\nSubtitle: TWELVE STORIES OF LAHORE\n\nAuthor: ZUBAIR AHMAD\n\nA book that you don t just read, you live Simon Schama\n\nTolstoy s magnificent epic novel of love, conflict, fate and human life in all its imperfection and grandeur\n\nWar and Peace begins at a glittering society party in St Petersburg in 1805, where conversations are dominated by the prospect of war. Terror swiftly engulfs the country as Napoleon s army marches on Russia, and the lives of three young people are changed forever. The stories of quixotic Pierre, cynical Andrey and impetuous Natasha interweave with a huge cast, from aristocrats and peasants to soldiers and Napoleon himself.\n\nTranslated with an Introduction and Notes by Anthony Briggs with an Afterword by Orlando Figes\n\nISBN: 9780140447934\n\nPublisher: PENGUIN BOOKS\n\nSubtitle:\n\nAuthor: LEO TOLSTOY"
