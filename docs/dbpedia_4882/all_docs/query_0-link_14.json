        "text": "The aim of this VCCCAR-funded project was to develop future design concepts at the landscape scale, in which regions are resilient to the impacts of climate change and are capable of dealing with unforeseen climate events. It takes a new approach to climate change adaptation at the (sub) regional scale by organising and conducting design-charrettes, a design-led, intensive workshop-based approach to adaptation that addresses the complexity and uncertainty in making decisions for climate change adaptation, and includes multiple disciplines through a co-development (or co-design) approach.\n\nPlanners play a critical role in shaping the communities in which we all live, making them more liveable, sustainable and vibrant places. Increasingly the planning profession is involved in multi-disciplinary responses to changing urban form and effective frameworks for private sector investment. Innovations in urban infrastructure planning, urban management and capital city strategic planning are emerging national priorities. The ACT region provides an immediate ‘urban and regional observatory’ for students to examine contemporary planning issues. Included in these proceedings are a number of key papers that provide insights into the changing landscape of tertiary education and local government and planning across various states.\n\nPlanners play a critical role in shaping the communities in which we all live, making them more liveable, sustainable and vibrant places. Increasingly the planning profession is involved in multi-disciplinary responses to changing urban form and effective frameworks for private sector investment. Innovations in urban infrastructure planning, urban management and capital city strategic planning are emerging national priorities. The ACT region provides an immediate ‘urban and regional observatory’ for students to examine contemporary planning issues. Included in these proceedings are a number of key papers that provide insights into the changing landscape of tertiary education and local government and planning across various states.\n\nSchools have traditionally been black-boxed in urban planning, in Australia and elsewhere. During the twentieth century, the shaping of a 'community within a community' that informed liberal educational thought materialised in campus-style schools that were exempted from local planning laws, contributed to sprawl and car dependency, and duplicated facilities provided by local authorities. Advocacy of compact city forms underpinning recent urban policy calls for a rethink by education and planning authorities of how schools engage with their urban surrounds. Focussing on Melbourne, Australia, this article discusses some challenges for the provision of schools and schooling in twenty-first century cities.\n\nIntegrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been embraced world wide in the management of the multiple impacts along our coastlines. Australia has been no exception, having a long history of development of coastal zone management from the Resource Assessment Commission’s inquiry into the coast in the early 1990s, to the establishment of the National Coastal Zone Management Framework. However, with the sea change phenomenon and threats to the coast as a result of sea level rise, there is a need to assess the suitability of conventional criteria for ICZM. This paper, using case studies of Victoria and Tasmania, Australia, considers whether the challenges of coastal migration and climate change merit new approaches for ICZM. We argue that building adaptive capacity and adaptive learning strategies must be incorporated as further and discrete criteria within coastal zone planning instruments."
