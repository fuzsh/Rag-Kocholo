        "text": "SOLID SUMMER: All-rounder Tom Rogers is one of the reasons Tasmania remains in the hunt for a place in the Sheffield Shield final. Picture: AAP Image/Rob Blacker\n\nThe batteries have been recharged for Tasmania as it chases a return to the Sheffield Shield Final in its vital encounter with Victoria from Wednesday.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nAll-rounder Tom Rogers, one of the revelations of the summer for the Tigers, on Tuesday revealed the playing squad had been given some time away from the game following last week’s dramatic win over South Australia.\n\nThe 24-year-old believed being refreshed mentally and physically would be an advantage heading into the clash with the Redbacks.\n\nBut he is not about to discount the threat that the third-placed Bushrangers, the winners of the past three titles, will be to the second-placed Tigers.\n\nTom Rogers with bat in hand for Tasmania. Picture: AAP Image/Rob Blakers\n\n“It is pretty proven that they have been the best for several years now,’’ Rogers said.\n\nRELATED\n\n“I don’t think it is going to be an easy win at all, as they have some exceptional players and guys who have played a lot of cricket at both the international and domestic level.\n\n“I think they are a pretty tough opponent (and) I don’t know if there is one particular dangerman, as they really all contribute.\n\n“(Chris) Tremain and (Scott) Boland work really well together and then they’ve got their spinners (including Fawad Ahmed) and Maxy (Glenn Maxwell) with the bat, so I think there is multiple guys who can fire on the day.”\n\nTom Rogers celebrates a South Australian wicket with fellow quick Jackson Bird. Picture: AAP Image/Julian Smith\n\nThe Tigers will enter the clash at Blundstone Arena just .18 points ahead of Victoria.\n\nQueensland, which plays fourth-placed New South Wales in the final round, sit at the top of the table, 8.58 points clear of Tasmania.\n\nThe Tigers are looking to qualify for their first final since winning the Shield in 2012-13, when a draw against Queensland delivered them the title.\n\nRogers, is one of the reasons they are in such a strong position with 33 wickets at 17.30 and 192 runs at 19.20 from his eight matches.\n\nBut the ACT recruit is not taking all the credit for his results with the ball.\n\n“Most will say it when they achieve success, but I really think it goes to the other bowlers as well,’’ he said.\n\n“Sam Rainbird has been exceptional and the amount of maidens he would have bowled if not for knicks through the slips and down to the boundary, and it (has been) the whole bowling group throughout the season with Gabe Bell, (Andrew) Fekete and Riley Meredith in the games he has come in as well (that have helped).\n\n“I think there is still a fair bit of accountability for each of our bowlers to perform and maintain that pressure that has been set up by the bowlers prior, but it does take a bit of pressure off and allows you to come in and do your thing as a bowler.”\n\nRogers said the Tigers were ready to embrace the pressure that comes with such a “do or die” contest, saying “there is going to be nerves and excitement, but I think that is something to welcome and enjoy”.\n\nTASMANIA SQUAD\n\nGeorge Bailey (c), Jackson Bird, Alex Doolan, Jake Doran, Andrew Fekete, Hamish Kingston, Ben McDermott, Riley Meredith, Simon Milenko, Sam Rainbird, Tom Rogers, Jordan Silk, Matthew Wade, Beau Webster.\n\nVICTORIA SQUAD\n\nAaron Finch (c), Fawad Ahmed, Scott Boland, Dan Christian, Jackson Coleman, Travis Dean, Seb Gotch, Marcus Harris, Glenn Maxwell, Peter Siddle, Chris Tremain, Eamonn Vines, Cameron White.\n\nDAILY DURING PARALYMPICS\n\nThe Paralympic Breakfast\n\nGet the best news and analysis from the Paris Paralympic Games in a daily update.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
