        "text": "Woolley's association with the Bellerive Oval goes back a long way before it transformed into a Test venue and then the lush Blundstone Arena that we know today. ©Cricbuzz\n\n\"The word Woolley compared to Boon and Ponting doesn't really fit into the same sentence, does it?\"\n\nRoger Woolley doesn't say it with any regret. He in fact chuckles when he's inquired about there being no significant mention of him at the Bellerive Oval. Or for that matter around Tasmanian cricket, whereas the likes of David Boon and Ricky Ponting not only have stands named after them; they even have their own statues, which in fact welcome you into the latest Ashes venue.\n\nWoolley does however have every right to have some grouse, even if he's not that type. He was after all a pioneer. Long before Ponting and Tim Paine went on to captain their country, and a year before Boon announced himself on the world stage, it was Woolley who became the first Tasmanian to officially don the Baggy Green as a Tasmanian.\n\nHe'd already by then become the first Tasmanian-born player to score a century for and captain his state in the Sheffield Shield. And it'd been his inclusion into the Australian Test team in April 1983 against Sri Lanka, only a few years after Tasmania had been included into the country's premier first-class competition, that as he puts it, \"proved that Tasmanians could compete on the national stage as Tasmanians\".\n\nAt 67, Wooley is the happiest he's ever been. When not spending entire days at golf courses around Orford on the scenic east coast of Tasmania, where he lives now, the former wicket-keeper batter who played 2 Tests and 4 ODIs, can be found fishing in the Prosser River. He spent the last 10 years of his life as a coffee roaster, running the Tasmanian gourmet range aptly named Oomph,which he sold off 12 months to fellow state cricketer Andrew Dykes. He'll be back in Hobart this weekend though, at the Bellerive Oval after years, to catch the first three days of the fifth Ashes Test. For someone who played an integral part in putting Tasmanian cricket on the map, the significance of an Ashes Test coming to his shores, isn't lost on Woolley. Even if he is aware that it took a global pandemic for Hobart to finally play host to the historic rivalry.\n\nThose around Tasmanian cricket circles do recall how Woolley became a better batter than keeper as his career progressed. ©Cricbuzz\n\n\"We've been left off the map a little bit the last few years. It's just a wonderful opportunity now, because of Covid unfortunately, to be able to gain an Ashes Test. There's a real buzz around the state. We have been in the Shield now for quite a long time and produced some great players and captains. I'm a proud Tasmanian and when I see matches going to Canberra and other places, it is very disappointing and we do feel like we've been left out,\" says Woolley.\n\nWoolley knows all about the challenges of belonging to a state that wasn't part of the mainstream. Like with Max Walker and the other handful of Test cricketers from Tasmania before their admission into the Shield, the chance to play for the country came only through shifting base to the mainland states. Woolley himself earned his grade playing two seasons of league cricket in Lancashire before Tasmania were added to the Shield on a \"part-time basis\" for two years in the summer of 1977-78.\n\n\"It was very tough early on. The part-time nature of our inclusion meant, instead of getting 10 Shield games, we were getting only five. So, there were big gaps in between games. One day you are facing Dennis Lillee, and the next week you are back in club cricket facing some little medium-pacer.\"\n\nWoolley recalls there having been a similar buzz to this week when Tasmania started playing their home games at the old Tasmanian Cricket Association (TCA) ground up in the Queens Domain.\n\n\"Oh, it was exciting for everyone. You had all these big players who we'd idolised on TV and here we were up against them. I remember my first Shield game, scoring 49 and 53 against South Australia, getting out hooking against Rodney Hogg. And these were pre-helmet days. We used to get big crowds, who were very supportive.\"\n\nUnlike his state's entry into Shield cricket, Woolley's Test call-up came more unexpectedly, as he recalls. Australia were due to depart for a tour of Sri Lanka in early 1983 and wicket-keeping legend Rod Marsh had decided to make himself available.\n\n\"When I got a phone call from the chairman of selectors that I'm on the plane with Greg Chappell and Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee, I really had to pinch myself. It was a real buzz to be able to say that. Then the reality set in that Wow someone from Tassie has actually made it to the Australian side. That was very fulfilling.\"\n\nWhile it created quite a buzz around the state, with all the newspapers celebrating his achievement, Wooley remembers the lack of fanfare with regards to his Baggy Green presentation. For, as he recalls with a chuckle, his cap was presented to him by, well himself.\n\n\"We were staying in Sydney as a team before we left for Sri Lanka. There was a big box in the corner of my room. I opened it up. It was a bit like Christmas and there was my Baggy Green. I have to admit I did spend some time looking at it in the mirror.\"\n\nWoolley's stay at the highest level was short-lived. He played his second and final Test in the Caribbean in 1984 under the captaincy of Kim Hughes, though Wayne Phillips had already overtaken him in the race to be the next Test wicket-keeper. There were a few ODI appearances too but despite Marsh's retirement soon after, the Tasmanian never quite made it back to the Australian team. It meant he never came too close to play in the Ashes, and he's aware that a decent showing in the Caribbean could have got him a berth for the 1985 trip to England.\n\n\"I kept pretty badly in the West Indies. I broke my finger and only gave it a week to recover. So, every time I kept, I used to keep snapping it. So that didn't help. I batted ok and when I came back after that tour, I batted really well and kept well.\"\n\nThose around Tasmanian cricket circles do recall how Woolley became a better batter than keeper as his career progressed. He averaged 51.21 in the 1984-85 season, where locals still rave about his breathtaking assault against a young, fiery Craig McDermott at the TCA ground. Three slashed boundaries towards wide third man off McDermott's raw pace still stand out for them.\n\nWoolley's association with the Bellerive Oval, meanwhile, goes back a long way before it transformed into a Test venue and then the lush Blundstone Arena that we know it as today. He reminisces about the time it was the home ground for the Clarence District Cricket Club, which he represented for many years.\n\n\"Clarence started the Bellerive Oval some 60 years ago. We had all our facilities there. There were a couple of little grandstands when I started and a tin shed, which was the change-room. Back then, you could drive into the ground and we used to have a lot of people watching us from their parked cars.\"\n\n\"When Cricket Tas decided to shift their base from TCA to Bellerive, we were really excited. But it meant we couldn't use our club rooms too much or even play too many of our home games there. And we moved out to Kangaroo Bay. I still am amazed by the facility now, which has become a magnificent Test arena with one of the best views in international cricket.\"\n\nMuch like the Bellerive Oval, Woolley has seen Tasmanian cricket grow monumentally from close quarters since those nondescript beginnings in the Shield. He does recall some of the well-established state teams looking down on the team as easy beats. That is before Tasmania began welcoming some big-name international stars into their midst. Woolley speaks very admirably about the contributions of the first-ever Tasmania captain, Lancashire all-rounder Jack Simmons, and Bryan Davison, who he believes provided a backbone to a lot of young Tassie players with their experience. That is before Michael Holding came along.\n\n\"Suddenly with Mikey around, you walk on to the field and you felt 10 feet taller because of him. You could see the opposition batters looking at him. That gave us some real confidence.\"\n\n\"If someone does mention my name still, then they must either be a history buff or have an incredibly sharp memory.\" ©Cricbuzz\n\nThe Gillette Cup trophy win in the summer of 1978-79, when they beat Western Australia in the final, proved that Tasmania were worthy of being in the big league to Woolley and a lot of his peers. Even if he still finds the difference in terms of team celebrations between then and now rather hilarious.\n\n\"Cricket Tassie gave us 12 long-neck beers for us to drink. By the time, we came back from the presentation, the 12 long-necks had disappeared. Then Tony Benneworth had to jump into his car, drive down to the pub, to get another Pub. That was my happiest story. Nowadays if you win anything, you can be in the changerooms all night and the beer would be flowing unlike back then.\"\n\nWoolley's association with cricket continued after his playing days, as state selector for 6-7 years, and also a junior coach. He does have great memories of playing alongside a young Boon for Tasmania and witnessing a young Ponting belting his club team all over the park in the early 90s. Like many others in the state, there is a bit of disappointment about not having a Tasmanian in the mix for the maiden Ashes Test in Hobart. And he does acknowledge that the buzz would have been a lot different if Tim Paine was still around.\n\n\"It would have been an unbelievable moment for Timmy and Tasmanian cricket and for Australian cricket. Tim has done a wonderful job over the last 3-4 years. It could have even been his last Test. You just wished that had happened. It's very sad and I feel very sad for him.\"\n\nBut the man who kicked it all off for Tasmania only sees a bright future for many more to follow his original lead and don the Baggy Green in the future. A far as his own legacy goes, Woolley isn't too fussed about it.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"
