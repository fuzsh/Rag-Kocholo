        "text": "SEIZE THE MOMENT\n\nDecember 31, 1948: Donna Adrian Gaines is born in Boston.\n\n1959: The future superstar. At 10 years old, she sings in public for the first time, when she steps in for a no-show singer at her church. She wows the congregation, and later she describes this moment as the start of her singing career.\n\nWho sponsored the summer camp Donna attended as a child?\n\nThe Salvation Army. As an adult, she consistently supported their charitable work.\n\n1967: Opportunity knocks. Still a teenager, Donna moves to Germany to perform in the musical Hair. While she’s there, she also makes her first records.\n\n1974: What’s in a name? Donna marries Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer, and they have a daughter, Mimi. Even after they divorce, Donna keeps his last name, changing the spelling to “Summer.”\n\nFIND YOUR PEOPLE\n\nDonna and Giorgio\n\nBruce and Donna\n\n1974: Legends meet. Donna signs a recording contract with producer-songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.\n\n1975: The team makes good. After releasing a string of hits in Europe, Donna, Giorgio, and Pete write “Love to Love You Baby,” which is their first American smash. Many of Donna’s chart-toppers are created with Pete and Giorgio, and they quickly become synonymous with the music of the 70s.\n\n1978: A new collaborator. Donna records “Last Dance,” written by superstar songwriter Paula Jabara. It wins the Academy Award, and a few years later, Paul co-writes Donna’s smash hit “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)”.\n\nWhat was the name of Donna's first European hit?\n\n“The Hostage,” which reached #2 on the Dutch charts.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? At the start of her career, Donna’s singles were never quite as popular in Germany, where she lived, as they were in other European countries. She used to joke that she could board a train in Munich as a regular person, but by the time she got to Holland, she was a star.\n\n1977: Love is in the air. Donna meets Bruce Sudano, whose band Brooklyn Dreams joins her on the hit “Heaven Knows.” Donna and Bruce feel a connection, and they marry in 1980. They have two children: Brooklyn, born in 1981, and Amanda, born in 1982.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Bruce was also like a father to Mimi. When Mimi was married, Helmuth walked her partway down the aisle, and Bruce accompanied her the rest of the way.\n\n\"Last Dance\" won the Academy Award. Which film is it from?\n\nThank God It’s Friday\n\nHEAR SOMEONE'S STORY\n\nOnetta and Donna on the 'She Works Hard for the Money' album.\n\n1979: What did you call her? Many of Donna’s songs are inspired by people she knew. “Bad Girls,” her longest-running number-one hit, is created after one of Donna’s assistants is harassed by a police officer who mistakes her for a street walker. Donna co-writes the song with Bruce and his Brooklyn Dreams bandmates, transforming that crude moment into a rebellious anthem.\n\n1983: Inspiration strikes. As you’ll learn in the musical, Donna’s surprising encounter with Los Angeles restaurant attendant Onetta Johnson leads to the creation of “She Works Hard for the Money,” one of her signature songs. Onetta even appears on the back of the She Works Hard for the Money album.\n\nDID YOU KNOW: “She Works Hard For the Money” was the first video by a black woman to be played in heavy rotation on MTV.\n\nDID YOU KNOW: In 1980, the Grammys gave awards in Rock categories for the first time. “Hot Stuff” won Donna the award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, making her the first woman to win a Grammy in the Rock field."
