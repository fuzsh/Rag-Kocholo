        "text": "Once upon a time there was a singer who helped to create a sound that defined an era. Her name was Donna Summer, and here is her story of how she almost played in the Pines…\n\nIn 1979 the Pines was putting together their legendary party called “Beach.” This was a groundbreaking event on Fire Island that had never been done before. An all night party that would benefit the communities Fire Department. The creatives gays of the Pines partnered with the local straight craftsman to build the Studio 54 of Fire Island that all would try to get in.\n\nDonna’s star continued to rise with hit after hit, until it changed in 1983, when the \"Queen of Disco\" allegedly made several derogatory remarks about the gay community and HIV/AIDS during a performance. The comments sparked immediate backlash from both gay and straight fans.\n\nShe later denied ever making the comments, and in a letter released in 2012 from 1989, Summer calls the accusations \"unjust and unfair.\" The letter, dated July 26 th, was sent to ACT UP, a prominent AIDS advocacy group. In it, Summer explains the difficulties in her personal life at the time, and recalls her strong gay following before \"the confusion.\"\n\nSummer says she was initially shielded from the controversy by her manager. \"Since then, however, I have made numerous replies and spoken openly to try and clear up this misunderstanding,\" she writes. \"I cannot force you to believe what I tell you, so if you choose to continue on with this fighting and arguing, that's up to you. I did not say God is punishing gays with aids, I did not sit with ill intentions in judgement over your lives. I haven't stopped talking to my friends who are gay, nor have I ever chosen my friends by their sexual preferences.\"\n\nThe controversy definitely put a stain on a stellar career, however her work continued. She eventually won her gays back by performing at many AIDS benefits. In 1991 came the second chance at a Donna Summer concert in the Pines. Again unfortunately the stars did not align again as it was just not meant to be…\n\nThough many still hold ill will towards Donna there is no recorded audio or video footage proving the supposed comments. In a world today where bigger offenses are forgotten, and with her passing in 2012 her music still brings out the gays of all ages where her legacy lives on…"
