        "text": "The “Queen of Disco” will be celebrated once more at the city of Boston’s 10th annual Donna Summer Disco Party on Thursday, June 27.\n\nSummer, born LaDonna Gaines, was a singer-songwriter that gained popularity during the disco era in the 1970s. She was born in Dorchester and raised in Mission Hill before becoming a five-time Grammy winner, selling over 140 million records worldwide.\n\nSummer was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. She died in 2012 at age 63, following a battle with lung cancer.\n\nKnown for hits like “Love to Love You Baby” and “Hot Stuff,” Summer started her impressive career singing in local churches in Mission Hill. The Greater Boston community fell in love with her then and has held her close ever since. Parker Hill Avenue, the street she grew up on, was even renamed after her.\n\nToday, the annual Donna Summer Disco Party run by the city honors her legacy in a block party-style celebration of her life and music.\n\nWe know you work hard for the money, so it’s important to note that Thursday’s dance party is free. If you’re lookin’ for some hot stuff that evening, here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is the event?\n\nMayor Michelle Wu and the city's Office of Tourism, Sports and Entertainment host the Donna Summer dance party, complete with glow sticks, colorful lights, bubbles and a disco ball.\n\nGuests can glide around City Hall Plaza on roller skates like it’s their last dance. Summer’s sister Mary Gaines Bernard and nephew O'Mega Red will perform and DJ Vince1 will mix Summer’s music.\n\nWhen and where is it? How can I get there?\n\nThe groovy party will be held on June 27 from 5-9 p.m. at 1 City Hall Square.

Summer was known for extravagant, glittering outfits, so take inspiration from her and make it your own. Make sure to pack your roller skates to roll around City Hall Plaza.
