        "text": "The “Queen of Disco” had some challenges.\n\nBack in the days when disco was at its peak there was one undisputed queen of the genre, Donna Summer. She was prolific when it came music output, but her personal life had a lot of turmoil. There were awards galore during her life, but they didn’t necessarily lead to happiness.\n\nIn addition to her singing, she also did some acting. She did have some interesting aspects of her life that I was unaware of. So, here are some things you might not have known about Donna Summers.\n\n1: Donna Summer played Steve Urkel’s Aunt Oona on Family Matters.\n\nShe must have married into the family.\n\n2: Donna grew up in Boston.\n\nShe did seem to sing or talk with a Boston accent, or even groan and moan for that matter.\n\n3: Donna moved to New York and eventually joined a musical called Hair, which led to a move to Munich in 1968.\n\nDonna became fluent in German. She also teamed up with David Hasselhoff for some German chart toppers. Ok, that last part isn’t true."
