        "text": "“I want to be the girl with the most cake / I love him so much, it just turns to hate / I fake it so real, I am beyond fake / And someday, you will ache like I ache”\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWelcome to Cover Me Badd, where we look at good covers, bad covers, and what makes them tick. And I promised I’d diversify this series more after the rockist bent it took over the past year, and I mean to stick with that promise. Because today, we’re looking at a genre that I can’t believe I haven’t covered in detail here before—disco.\n\nThat’s right, the pride and joy of the 70s, the genre that everyone immediately thinks of upon any single mention of the 70s, we’re finally covering the era of flare jeans, rhinestones and sequins and spandex. Disco is, by and large, a misunderstood genre, then and now, but I feel like it’s been misunderstood in different ways since its inception, in ways I’ll talk about below. But there’s no denying how massive it was for its day. It was so massive that I don’t think any trend in recent memory can really compare to how massively oversaturated disco had become by 1979. If you want one index of the genre’s massive dominance, just look at how it’s come to define the 70s despite only existing at the decade’s tail end. That’s how inescapable it was, and it’ll go a long way in understanding how an innocuous genre could eventually spark a backlash so intense that records were literally burned in the fields.\n\nBut if we’re gonna talk about disco, then we have to talk about the undisputed Queen of Disco—one Ms. Donna Summer.\n\nDisco was never a genre designed to have superstars and big names, but somehow, it found one in Donna Summer, a silky-smooth vocalist and a towering presence who managed to give disco its biggest and most enduring classics. But it wasn’t just her starpower and stage presence that gave her pop stardom as a sort of proto-MTV icon, it was also her incalculable contributions to pop music as both an innovator and a curator that made her work stand the test of time, even as the disco backlash washed away much of the genre’s goodwill in the succeeding decades. She pioneered new sounds and helped institute the electronic dance song as the default mode of pop music, as well as helping bring more electronic-influenced styles to the forefront. There’s no denying that she changed the face of music.\n\nBut make no mistake, Ms. Summer’s otherwise towering legacy has its own share of oddities, and while I’ll try to get most of them in this article, there’s one, in particular we’ll be focusing on. Disco is no stranger to the kitschy and weird, but even for as over-the-top and ridiculous the genre could get, there’s no accounting for this strangest of hits.\n\nIn 1978, fresh off the success of her collaborations with legendary producer and electronica pioneer Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer released a sprawling, epic suite, the ‘MacArthur Park Suite’, off her live album Live and More. It was a bunch of different songs strung together, and at the very end, the title track(?), ‘MacArthur Park’, which was spun off into its own single. Why is this worth mentioning? Well, because ‘MacArthur Park’ became Summer’s first #1 hit on the Hot 100, a fact that has baffled music critics and disco fans to no end. Summer had been a household name for years before this, but it took this song, of all the damn songs in the world, to finally put her over the top.\n\nBut what most people probably forget is that ‘MacArthur Park’ isn’t even a Donna Summer original, but a melodramatic ‘60s folk-pop ballad penned by one Jimmy Webb and originally recorded by singer and actor Richard Harris in 1968. The Harris version is very different from the upbeat hi-energy dance track it eventually became, obviously, but it became well-known in its own right, spawning numerous cover versions even before Donna Summer got her hands on it. Somewhere between the ‘Run Joey Run’s and the ‘Emma’s of the world, we found the time to jam to this six-minute song about love gone awry.\n\nNow, I don’t know if I’ve done a very good job explaining just what makes this song so baffling, but, trust me, the full story is worth hearing. So sit back and let’s eat that cake in the rain as we dissect one of the most infamous pop songs of all time. Strap in.\n\nThe original:\n\nIn the ‘60s, there was a popular musical movement which centered on a very heady, melodramatic type of specifically teenage tragedy.\n\nBetween that brief, strange transition from the buttoned-up wholesomeness of the ‘50s and the absolute mayhem of the new rock and roll era, the teenager was beginning to make itself known as a potent demographic that began to command the attention of music industry executives. Teenage dramas have and still continue to exist, but this specific type often followed a familiar pattern–they were usually melodramatic little numbers fixating on either forbidden love, reckless youth, eternal devotion, and even death. And a lot of the time, these songs would be set against the backdrop of disapproving parents and societal norms violently enforcing themselves on the erstwhile protagonists. As was often the case, these teenage lovers would either go the Romeo and Juliet route or the James Dean route, depending on who was writing the song.\n\nThere’s many reasons why this style of music became popular when it did. The image of the teenager as a distinct demographic separate from children and adults had only really begun to emerge after the post-World War II boom, and this idealized image was only further cemented upon a string of tragic deaths of young up-and-coming celebrities like James Dean and Buddy Holly, all of whom had been teenage icons in their lifetime. Moreover, teenagers are just naturally wangsty and melodramatic to begin with, so it wasn’t surprising that they got these kinds of romanticized melodrama marketed to them, especially as they were seen as expressive of the teenage desire to break free of their parents’ control. In these cases, what if the only way to do so was through death?\n\nThis genre of music began to fade out around the mid-60s as Beatlemania and the British Invasion drowned it out, but it still persisted in a limited form as far as the mid-70s, as the success of ‘Run Joey Run’ showed (although to be fair, ‘Run Joey Run’ might have been the long-overdue final nail in the coffin). It wasn’t much, but it was a slow trickle, and it still had enough staying power by 1968 that a young, newly-famous songwriter named Jimmy Webb was able to capitalize on it.\n\nJimmy Webb was an Oklahoma native from an insanely religious household who got his start performing and composing for his local church group, before a timely move to Southern California allowed him to establish connections in the burgeoning music industry. By the ‘60s, he was steadily making a name for himself writing songs for the Supremes, Johnny Rivers, Vicki Carr and the Fifth Dimension. But he got his big break writing songs for the now-legendary country singer Glen Campbell, who at the time was still making his transition from Beach Boys touring member (filling in for an increasingly unstable Brian Wilson) into an established star in his own right. Luckily for Webb, 1967 would turn out to be a good year for Campbell, who scored his first crossover hits that year, a not insignificant portion of which Webb penned. Several Grammy nominations made Webb an in-demand songwriter and gave him the clout to pursue his own projects.\n\nBy ‘68, Webb had moved into producing, and while working with the Fifth Dimension, he was introduced to the group’s own producer, Bowes Howe. Howe, fresh off working with folk-pop acts like the Association, challenged Webb into writing similarly grandiose music in the same vein, and Webb, already high off the artistic experiences of the past few years, quickly got to work. He set about crafting just the most elaborate piece of music one could possibly envision, a veritable suite full of chord and tempo changes, movements, motifs and cycles. According to Tom Breihan (whose excellent piece on today’s subject I might crib from a little), Webb’s idea was that he’d write a whole cantata for the Association, which they could then fill an entire B-side of an album with. They could break off each song from the cantata as its own standalone thing.\n\nAnd right smack at the end of that cantata was a charming little number by the name of ‘MacArthur Park’.\n\nThe Association ultimately passed on the song, perhaps because thought Webb’s idea was stupid. But Webb wasn’t out of options yet, because as he retooled, he was able to get in touch with an actor who was looking to get into the music business, someone who could serve as a perfect vehicle for his little experiment. His name was Richard Harris. And if that name sounds familiar to my millennial followers, that’s because they might know him better for this:\n\nThat’s fucking right.\n\nBut before he became the first to play everyone’s favorite neglectful mentor, he was just a young an Irish actor looking to make it in the music business. He’d starred in several Irish and British films previously, but 1967 would net him his biggest success yet playing King Arthur in the Oscar-winning film Camelot, a role which required a good deal of singing. And because of that, the idea to make an album became intractably lodged in his head, and he wouldn’t take no for an answer. So when he met Webb, it was a perfect creative match, and Webb, having buried ‘MacArthur Park’ after the Association rejected it, quickly got around to resurfacing and reworking it to fit Harris’… let’s say, unique vocal stylings. As it turns out, Harris, who’d wanted to work with Webb specifically, jumped at the song the first chance he got, and it became the lead-off single from the resulting album, 1968’s A Tramp Shining.\n\nBy all accounts, the album was actually pretty good, but the single ‘MacArthurPark’ did phenomenally, making it all the way to #2 on the Hot 100, held back by Herb Alpert’s ‘This Guy’s In Love With You’, which, in retrospect, was probably the right choice. Because holy God. Again, I don’t think my descriptions of it so far have really shed light on the full breadth and scope of the wonder that is ‘MacArthur Park’, so let’s take a look at the lyrics, shall we? Here’s the first verse:\n\nSpring was never waiting for us, girl\n\nIt ran one step ahead\n\nAs we followed in the dance\n\nBetween the parted pages and were pressed\n\nIn love’s hot, fevered iron\n\nLike a striped pair of pants\n\nAnd here’s the chorus:\n\nMacArthur’s Park is melting in the dark\n\nAll the sweet, green icing flowing down\n\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\n\nI don’t think that I can take it\n\n‘Cause it took so long to bake it\n\nAnd I’ll never have that recipe again\n\nOh no!\n\nThe one thing people will tell you about ‘MacArthur Park’ is that it has some of the most notoriously bizarro lyrics ever composed in the history of pop music, full of strange melodrama and weird, out-of-place little details that end up jarring your suspension of disbelief. Think, that weird ‘roommate back in Boulder’ line in ‘Closer’, but for an entire song. The basic conceit of the song is simple enough—it’s about a breakup. It’s a tried and true formula, but the song’s sweeping grandiosity and the distinctive imagery always suggested to me that it was happening right on the cusp of a significant milestone in this couple’s trajectory, most likely a wedding, given the ‘cake out in the rain’ thing.\n\nTo be entirely fair, the weird little details in the song are there because Webb based this song heavily on his life and his experiences. His ex-girlfriend did work near MacArthur Park in Los Angeles (Harris, true to form, insisted on singing it as ‘MacArthur’s Park’), there apparently were old men playing checkers in the park a la-Queen’s Gambit in said park, and, yes, there apparently was a cake in the rain involved somewhere there. There’s definitely an emotional core to this song that just barely saves it from being a complete trainwreck, but honestly it might’ve been better if this song had been allowed to be weirder and more surreal than it was?\n\nWhat makes this song just so goddamn weird isn’t just the presence of those jarring details. Lots of songs can get away with that, especially when you’re talking about country or folk songs. But there’s a thematic and stylistic consistency to those kinds of songs; you have to establish what you’re going for so that the listener is primed to accept all these things you throw at them. So it doesn’t help that in between those jarringly literal details, the verses of the song utilize imagery that’s meant to be poetic and metaphorical to the point of absurdity (‘In love’s hot, fevered iron / Like a striped pair of pants’). There’s just such a level of feverish intensity behind them that they can’t help but come off as surreal psychedelia, the kind that would’ve been par for the course in 1968, but not on an operatic song like this.\n\nThis song clearly knows what it’s about; the only time the melodrama actually hits any sort of emotional note is in the bridge, ‘There will be another song for me / For I will sing it / There will be another dream for me / Someone will bring it’. There’s something there, but whatever sense of sweeping operatic grandeur you might get out of it is immediately destroyed by the oppressive literalism of the ‘cake in the rain’ chorus. There was just no way any chorus which so emphasizes how long it takes to bake a cake would ever be taken seriously, but what pushes it into outright comedy gold is Harris’ forceful intensity as he delivers those lines, and even moreso when he goes ‘Oh noooooooooooo’ right at the end.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s bad; it’s very bad. But even with that in mind, I wouldn’t say it ranks very highly on my ‘worst songs of all time’ list, mostly because I respect it for how ambitious it is. Any song that dares to suck with this much gusto is alright in my book. And, seeing as this song has endured as a curious novelty for decades on end even as other outliers like ‘Run Joey Run’ have since faded from memory, I think that at least speaks to something in the song.\n\nWhich brings us to the next chapter in this song’s history…\n\nThe cover:\n\nAlright, so a full 10 years after the release of Richard Harris’ ‘MacArthur Park’, and music is in a completely different place. The Vietnam War was over, Nixon had resigned over Watergate, and America was entering a massive recession brought about by the oil embargo. Long-haired hippie freaks and uniformed boy bands and girl groups were giving away to glitzy Vegas acts, rhinestone cowboys and corporate rockers as music became less rugged and raggedy and more polished and glamorous. But if we’re talking about smooth, polished music, then we have to talk about the smoothest and most polished of them all—disco.\n\nIn 1978, disco had reached its peak of popularity. After having exploded onto the mainstream the year before, by ‘78 it was a full-blown phenomenon, and the train would keep on rolling until its infamous derailment in the summer of 1979. Now, for those of us living in 2021, when disco is as legitimate as any other genre out there, the thought that this relatively innocuous, fun genre could inspire such virulent backlash seems baffling to us, and it’s pretty well-known now how much of that backlash was rooted in racism and homophobia. The days of disco being a joke have long since passed.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel like we need to clarify the nuance in this discussion, because while racism and homophobia were very real driving factors in intensifying the disco backlash, the fact was that for just about the last two or three years of the ‘70s, disco was ubiquitous. It had seeped into nearly every facet of popular culture to such an unfathomable extent that I don’t even think it’s possible today. No modern trend in my lifetime even comes close, and because the concept of overplay basically doesn’t exist anymore, Gen Z-ers probably won’t understand the extent of it. The closest I can think of is the trap boom of 2018, but even then, just barely, seeing as trap never got much radio airplay.\n\nIn the late ‘70s, disco was basically the only kind of music being made, so much so that for many veteran acts, it was either hop onto the disco bandwagon or go broke. Some managed (Blondie) but for the most part, it led to a series of embarrassing and unsuccessful attempts at relevance from the likes of Rod Stewart, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and KISS. What I think a lot of people forget is that for every one great disco song, there were probably five or six shitty ones that had equal airplay. Not only that, but kitsch like the Disco Star Wars theme, as well as inane novelties like ‘Disco Duck’ being pumped out on the regular. Not all criticism of disco came from white rock fans either; a lot of anti-disco backlash was thrown by way of established funk performers like George Clinton, who saw disco as an overpolished sell-out version of funk. So while nothing excuses white people burning black records records en masse, you at least understand why someone from that era would’ve been sick of disco by 1979.\n\nSo it’s honestly kind of funny to me that disco has become yet another over-mythologized genre, like punk or grunge; it’s been a popular musical talking point for so long that, honestly, it’s become a little overstated. Nonetheless, the genre’s critical reappraisal has been nothing if not well-deserved. Disco was a joke for so long that we gained about two decades worth of sitcom stock characters directly lampooning the genre’s dead horse status. While there were brief blips of disco revivalism in the early 90s, it was probably only around the late 2000s and early-2010s when disco really began its massive reputational turnaround. What helps is that the flood of crappy disco from the late 70s has been wiped from the cultural memory, leaving us with the best of the best, and the advantage of disco was that while the bad stuff was really bad, the good stuff was really good.\n\nWhich brings us to Donna Summer.\n\nDonna Summer is the greatest artist disco has ever had to offer, there’s pretty much no dispute about that. She was the undisputed queen of the scene in the same way Michael or Madonna ruled the MTV era; hell, if the disco backlash had never happened, Donna Summer could’ve easily been the first MTV icon, because her brand of all-consuming pop stardom was basically a prototype of the 80s MTV-driven Big Pop phenomenon, but in an era before that type of pop machinery was the norm.\n\nAnd yet, her own path to stardom was extremely unconventional. After running away from home as a teenager, Donna Summer began her musical career signing for a New York-based blues rock band called Crow, before quickly moving onto theater and getting herself cast in the Munich production of Hair. This led her to move to Germany, where she was exposed to the spacier and more dance-oriented club scenes of the time. This gave her an edge over her peers for two reasons. First off, it was only 1974. Where disco was only beginning to trickle slowly into America, in Europe it was already pretty well-developed. Second, it was in Munich where Donna would meet two up-and-coming producers named Phil Belotte and Giorgio Moroder. This was an extremely consequential partnership, because their brand of dizzily-repetitive synth-based sound was about to change the face of disco.\n\nWhere most of the early disco hits were based mostly on the lush, orchestral arrangements of Philly soul, Moroder’s sound injected a lot more electronica and bass into it. It was a distinctly European sound, one which matched well with Summer, who was always more of an operatic, technical singer, in contrast to most Black singers of the time, who were more gospel and soul-oriented. With their combined forces, they made magic.\n\nIt would take a good long while for its influences to truly be felt, but the distinctly synth-based, electronic sound of Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer basically became the template for pop music in the decades to come. With several Top 10 singles under her belt by 1978, Summer was a hit-making phenomenon. And yet, the one thing that had eluded her thus far was a #1 single. But surely, it was only a matter of time, and as it turns out, 1978 was the year she would finally achieve that elusive feat. But what amazing, mind-meltingly brilliant song could achieve this feat?\n\n… yeah, seriously.\n\nBut it makes a kind of sense when you look at where Moroder and Summer were artistically. Both of them had ambitious, operatic prog-rock ambitions, and Summer especially wanted a song where she could belt, with the gusto and force that none of Moroder’s other songs had allowed her to. So they were up to the challenge, and they needed a song that could help them reach those heights. They’d been throwing around some ideas for whatever bit of ‘60s pop balladry they could spin and remix, until they finally settled on ‘MacArthur Park’, because of course they did. How could it not be?\n\nTo be fair, they do switch it up some. Instead of the heady, melodramatic opera that the original was, the Summer version is, true to form, a lot punchier and more aggressive, with the focus really being more on the sound and the groove more than the lyrics. It does start out with the traditional ‘MacArthur Park’ operatic strings, but by the second verse it comes alive into a veritable tornado of disco histrionics. Hell, if you’re not listening carefully, you might not even hear the lyrics at all, because the production is so powerful and all-consuming that you don’t really have time to focus on them. Which is probably the best way to treat this song, to be honest. The way you deal with campy melodramatic schlock is you take away the shlock factor—stop the song from taking itself so seriously so that the listener doesn’t have to.\n\nAnd to be fair, it does get there, at least a little bit. Disco is its own kind of camp, but you can get away with these kinds of hyperbolic statements in the context of a dance track, where the processed instrumentation usually tends to undercut the seriousness and sincerity of whatever’s going on. Donna Summer sings it well and she tries her damndest to inject the appropriate amount of emotion into the chorus. At the very least, her singing ‘Oh noooo’ is a lot more convincing than when Richard Harris tried to do it. And musically, Moroder and Bellotte just sell it. They throw everything they have into it. Strings! Horns! Funk guitars! Blues piano! Effects! Drum machines! It’s all there, and combined with Summer’s excellent-as-ever voice, you get a pretty damn great dance track.\n\nBut still, the lyrics. Try as they might, the lyrics still stand out, immediately shattering whatever magic the dance instrumentation might create. No matter how hard Moroder and Bellotte wrap the song in awe-inspiring production, and no matter how much emotion Summer puts in her vocals, there’s just no way you can sell a line like ‘And I’ll never have that recipe again / Oh noooooo!’ If anything, the competent music undercuts the charm of the song and robs it of its power, because it’s not ridiculous enough to be ‘so bad its good’ anymore. It’s just an ordinary disco song with terrible lyrics.\n\nAnd in the late 70s, if you were trying to make the case that disco was a plague that needed to be eradicated, ‘MacArthur Park’ was as good a place as any to start.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nEh?\n\nI don’t really hate either version of ‘MacArthur Park’, regardless of what I think of them quality-wise. And to be fair, there’s a lot to respect about Donna Summer’s version, too; Moroder’s use of multi-tracked vocals in the song proved hugely influential to pop production, and the song made Donna Summer the first artist in history to simultaneously top both the singles and the albums chart. But even so, I’d be the world’s biggest liar if I told you that ‘MacArthur Park’ was a pivotal entry in her discography, or anything like that. It’s certainly better than the original, but at the same time, it’s a lot less attention-grabbing. To me, it’s just kind of a meh song with an interesting backstory, and an arrangement that arguably negates what made the original so memorable."
