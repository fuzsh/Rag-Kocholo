But what I will say is this- Donna Summer is probably the reason I love the music I love today. She is one of the reasons that for many, many years my nickname was ‘Disco Mike’ (could have gotten much worse I guess!).\n\nDonna Summer’s ‘I Feel Love’ is, and probably will always be my favourite record; I heard it live (a rare occurrence these days) at Global Gathering a few years back and it blew me away. For me, there were fewer better things to see than literally thousands of electronic music fans, arms raised, immersed in one of the iconic songs of the disco era.\n\nSo here’s to you Donna- another one got away."
