        "text": "US singer Donna Summer, famous for disco classics including I Feel Love and Love To Love You Baby, has died at the age of 63.\n\nSummer was one of disco's biggest stars and also had a huge influence on the synth pop and dance music scenes.\n\nHer family said they were \"at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy\".\n\nStars including Kylie Minogue, Sir Elton John and Mary J Blige have paid tribute.\n\nR&B singer Blige said on Twitter that Summer was \"truly a game changer\", while producer Quincy Jones said her voice \"was the heartbeat and soundtrack of a decade\".\n\nMinogue described her as \"one of my earliest musical inspirations\", while Dionne Warwick said she was sad to lose a great performer and \"dear friend\".\n\nSummer, who was reported to have had cancer, had been living in Florida with her husband Bruce Sudano.\n\nA statement from her family said: \"Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith.\n\n\"While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time.\"\n\nElton John said Summer was more than the \"queen of disco\", adding: \"Her records sound as good today as they ever did.\n\n\"That she has never been inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is a total disgrace, especially when I see the second-rate talent that has been inducted.\"\n\nDuran Duran keyboardist Nick Rhodes said: \"It's extremely rare that you hear one song that completely changes the way you perceive music. I Feel Love achieved that.\"\n\nSinger Marc Almond recalled how Summer's work with Italian synthesiser pioneer Giorgio Moroder had \"changed the face of music and changed my life\".\n\n\"I Feel Love was a truly original and barrier breaking record, and Now I Need You and Working The Midnight Shift are simply some of the best euphoric electronic tracks ever,\" he said.\n\nBBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said I Feel Love was \"one of the key records in the history of electronic dance music and will always be recognised as such\".\n\nSummer grew up in Boston and started singing in her church's gospel choir. Her stage career began in musicals, prompting a move to Germany where she appeared in Hair and Porgy and Bess.\n\nBut it was her work with the Moroder that led to her pop breakthrough with Love To Love You Baby in 1975 - the first of 29 UK top 40 singles.\n\nHer expressive vocal style, coupled with Moroder's pulsating rhythms, made the song a big club and chart hit - as well as leading it to be banned by several radio stations for its suggestive overtones."
