        "text": "A rep for Donna Summer says she will be laid to rest in a private ceremony, not a public memorial.\n\n“On behalf of the Sudado Family, the overwhelming outreach from the media, fans and friends alike has been most truly appreciated,” Summer’s publicist, Brian Edwards, tells THR in a statement. “Reports of a public memorial next week in Nashville are not accurate. The services being planned will be private to include only family and close friends. Thank you for continuing to respect the family’s privacy during this time.”\n\nEdwards did not provide further details on where and when the funeral would take place.\n\nPHOTOS: Donna Summer: The Disco Queen’s Life and Career in Pictures\n\nSummer died of cancer Thursday morning in Naples, Fla., at the age of 63. Her illness had not been publicized, and with the news of her death, tributes poured in from her music-industry contemporaries and friends such as Barbra Streisand and Quincy Jones.\n\nIn 1980, Summer married singer Bruce Sudano, with whom she had two daughters.\n\nThe influential “Queen of Disco” and five-time Grammy winner helped define the ’70s dance phenomenon with such hits as “Love to Love You Baby,” “I Feel Love,” “Hot Stuff” and “Bad Girls.”"
