        "text": "Born. To Marshall Field III, 45, Chicago department store scion; and his third wife, Ruth Pruyn Phipps Field, 32; a daughter; in Manhattan. The baby (their second, her fourth, his fifth) was expected to become an aunt shortly, since her half-sister, Mrs. Anthony A. Bliss. 21, was due to become a mother any day.\n\nBorn. To C. (for Clarence) Elmer Taylor, 44, insurance broker and American Legionnaire, and his wife: a son, their first child; in Chicago. When Elmer Taylor got lost in a parade during the Legion’s 1933 Chicago convention, the gathering took as its slogan, watchword, wisecrack and talisman the cry: “Where’s Elmer?” Since then Legionnaires often address each other as Elmer. Name of the Taylors’ son: Robert Frank.\n\nBorn. To Fred Waring, 38, jazzmaster (“The Pennsylvanians”), and his wife: a son, their third child; in Manhattan.\n\nMarried. Major General James Guthrie Harbord, 72, board chairman of Radio Corp. of America, onetime chief of staff of the American Expeditionary Forces in France; and Anne Lee Brown. 55, great-granddaughter of Light Horse Harry Lee; both for the second time; in Rapidan, Va.\n\nMarriage Revealed. Barbara Josephine Guggenheim Lawson-Johnston Wettach, 33, heiress to the Guggenheim copper millions; and Henry Obre, 33, Manhattan grinding-wheel salesman; she for the third time, he for the first; month ago, in Darien, Conn.\n\nDied. Dr. Calvin Blackman Bridges. 49, famed geneticist, whose experiments with the fruit fly shed new light on the problems of heredity; after long illness; in Los Angeles.\n\nDied. Zona Gale Breese, 64, novelist, essayist, playwright (Birth, Preface to a Life, Yellow Gentians and Blue); of pneumonia; in Chicago. In 1921 she won a Pulitzer prize for her dramatization of her own novel, Miss Lulu Bett.\n\nDied. Edward W. Griffin, 69, Secretary of Alaska since 1933 and its Acting Governor in the absence of holidaying Governor John W. Troy; of heart disease; in Juneau. As he rose smiling from his seat to speak at a public meeting he toppled over dead.\n\nDied. Emile Vandervelde, 72, famed Belgian socialist; of heart disease; in Brussels. Onetime (1925-27) Foreign Minister of Belgium, once (1935-37) in the Van Zeeland Cabinet, he was called ”mother-in-law of cabinets” because of his influence. Since the death of Aristide Briand, fiery Emile Vandervelde was considered by most Europeans the greatest orator in the French language."
