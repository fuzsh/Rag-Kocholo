He left school at 18, attending the Erasmus Business School in Leuven in Flemish Brabant, central Belgium. Both Limburg and Flemish Brabant are in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern part of Belgium.\n\nIn 1971 he joined Kraft Foods. During his 24-year career at the group he had experience of working in 30 countries and performed a number of operational, strategic and financial management roles, including the successful acquisition and integration of the Jacob/Suchard companies into Kraft in 1990. He became CEO of the Kraft Jacobs Suchard French and later Italian operations.\n\nLuc joined Promodès in 1995, eventually becoming its CEO, replacing the French billionaire Paul-Louis Halley. He was a driving force behind the merger of Promodès with Carrefour announced in August 1999 and was appointed vice chairman. He headed the integration of the two companies but left Carrefour in 2000 to join M&S. He returned in 2005 for two years as chairman of the supervisory board, orchestrating a complete overhaul of the management structure.\n\nIn 1998, Marks & Spencer was the UK's most profitable retailer, making more than £1.1bn in profit.

In March 2000 he dropped the St Michael logo and rebranded as Marks & Spencer.[3][4][5]\n\nLuc was senior independent director of Vodafone and chairman of the Remuneration Committee. He retired from the Vodafone Board in September 2015 following 12 years as a non-executive director.\n\nLuc was a board member of bank Société Générale until May 2012\n\nLuc is the founder and chairman of Change Capital Partners, a specialist private equity firm focused on consumer-related businesses.
