        "text": "Libert Froidmont, Director of CMI, passed away on Wednesday, 21 June, at the age of 63 following a long illness.\n\nLibert Froidmont studied law at the University of Liège. He started his career in 1980 at the Ministry of Work and Employment. One year later, he joined the Emile Vandervelde Institute where he remained until 1988. His name was closely linked to the future of the iron and steel industry in Wallonia where he was one of its greatest defenders. By the end of the 1980s, he played an active role in negotiations on regionalisation of the main fields of industrial activity in Belgium. This role would then lead him to managing the fund for restructuring these sectors in the Walloon region. This fund resulted in the setting of the Sogepa investment fund which was managed by Libert Froidmont between 1999 and 2013. As head of Sogepa, he advised several Walloon economic ministers no matter what political views they held.\n\nWith the death of Libert Froidmont, CMI has lost a first-class director who supported Bernard Serin and Pierre Meyers during their purchase of CMI in 2002. He sat on the CMI board of directors uninterrupted from 2002 to now, firstly as representative of Sogepa and then in a personal capacity which recognised the quality of his support. Libert Froidmont also presided over the Audit Committee of CMI and was a member of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nCMI would like to offer our sincerest condolences to friends and family."
