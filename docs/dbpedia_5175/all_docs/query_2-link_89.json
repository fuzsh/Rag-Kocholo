        "text": "There are conceivably worse ways to spend a damp Thursday evening than in the British Library perusing the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. This is the compendium of knowledge that the country worked on through various versions in 1926-90. I was looking at volumes produced in the 1970s Brezhnev era that had been later translated into English.\n\nSoviet productions of this sort are always interesting. Yes, there is an ever-present tendency to trim and ‘tidy’ narratives to suit the assorted mythologies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). But there is also a counter-tendency towards completeness. This generally leads Soviet writers into circumlocutions in trying to explain away this or that embarrassing fact. But in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia there is the bald counter-position of different entries.\n\nThis became clear when I stumbled upon a surprising entry on Pro-party Menshevism, written by NV Ershkov, which I have reproduced in full below.[i] It seems to me to be historically accurate but problematic for the overall Soviet narrative around the pre-war RSDLP. The picture the entry draws is of an RSDLP composed of factions and Bolsheviks blocking willingly with Plekhanov’s wing of the Mensheviks in pursuit of limited goals. You can, of course, easily read about all this in Lenin’s writings of 1908-12 and the entry offers some suggested further reading from the Collected Works.\n\nHowever, there is a problem here. Once you begin differentiating opportunist factions into better or worse wings this unpicks the over-riding Soviet mythology that Lenin was anti-factions and the Bolsheviks were engaged in a pursuit of a monolithic ‘party of a new type’. In this particular instance, the entry on Pro-party Menshevism clashes with another entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia also written in the 1970s on the RSDLP’s 1912 Prague conference. In line with various versions of the CPSU Short Course produced from 1938, it was alleged that 1912 “signalled the complete triumph of Lenin’s call for a final break with the opportunists [i.e., all of the Mensheviks]”.[ii] Whereas our entry on Pro-party Menshevism below factually records that the conference only “purged the party of the Liquidators”. It was only when Plekhanov and other Mensheviks refused to accept the decisions of the 1912 conference that they were then turfed out of the RSDLP.\n\nUltimately, reading Soviet-era publications doesn’t give an awful lot of solace to the lump-headed individuals still wanting to hold on to the ‘party of a new type’ and our supposed ‘non-factional’ future.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMENSHEVIKS, PROPARTY, a current within Menshevism that never became a full-fledged organisation. The Proparty Mensheviks opposed the Liquidators and favoured the maintenance of an underground party, but they also wanted to retain their Menshevik platform. The current emerged in 1908 and was led by GV Plekhanov, who left the editorial board of Golos sotsial-demokrata, the Liquidators’ organ, and resumed publication of the anti-Liquidator Dnevnik sotsial-demokrata. In 1909 groups of Proparty Mensheviks were founded abroad and in Russia.\n\nAlthough Plekhanov condemned organised Liquidationism, he did not mention its programmatic and tactical disagreements with the party. Nevertheless, the Bolsheviks formed a bloc with the Proparty Mensheviks in order to rally all the party forces around a principled platform for a joint struggle against the Liquidators. In a number of party organisations in Russia (in Moscow, St Petersburg, Sormovo, Ufa, and Odessa) the Proparty Mensheviks worked with the Bolsheviks, contributing to Bolshevik publications such as Rabochaia gazeta, Zvezda, Mysl’, and Sotsial-demokrat (the party’s central organ) and participating in the work of the Russian Organizational Commission. They also took part in the work of the Sixth (Prague) All-Russian Conference of the RSDLP (1912), which purged the party of the Liquidators. The existence of a Bolshevik-Proparty Menshevik bloc induced workers who had supported the Mensheviks to accept the Bolshevik platform. Some Proparty Mensheviks, including VP Zatonskii, Ia D Zevin, BI Magidov, AF Radchenko, GI Chudnovskii, and DM Shvartsman, later joined the Bolshevik Party. But the Proparty Mensheviks abroad, who were headed by Plekhanov, refused to recognise the legality of the Prague Conference and broke with the Bolsheviks. In 1912 they began publishing the factional newspaper Za partiiu. World War I led to the disintegration of the Proparty Menshevik groups abroad. Plekhanov came out for the defence of the homeland, and other Proparty Mensheviks joined various Menshevik groups.\n\n[i] Great Soviet Encyclopedia 16 Moscow 1974, p125\n\n[ii] Great Soviet Encyclopedia 29 Moscow 1978, pp660-1\n\nI was interested to come across this short piece in the 6 April 1912 issue of Justice, the paper of the British Socialist Party (BSP). Culled from its ‘The International’ column, which summarised news and arguments inside other parties in the Second International, this piece looked at the response to the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party’s (RSDLP’s) 1912 Prague conference.\n\nOf course, the myth about this conference, reproduced in 1938’s Short course on the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), heavily influenced and carefully edited by Stalin,[1] (and then subsequently broadcast by organisations such as the Communist Party of Britain and various brands of Trotskyism) was that it instituted a ‘party of a new type’, marking a final split with the Mensheviks in favour of a homogenised Bolshevik organisation without factions. This narrative is substantively false, as evidenced by Lenin and Stalin’s writings of the time[2] and by more recent work by Lars T Lih.[3]\n\nAs this little report makes clear, neither would this narrative of the ‘party of a new type’ and a ‘break with the Mensheviks’ have made any sense to interested co-parties in the Second International of the time. While it is clear that the Bolshevik faction’s view of 1912 RSDLP conference was contested in the international movement, it was not being understood primarily as a Bolshevik/Menshevik dispute but one that revolved around the actions of ‘Liquidators’ “who deny the existence of an illegal party, but at the same time take no steps to legalise themselves”. In this period, the Bolshevik faction was attempting to rally all pro-party elements to the RSDLP and thus counter this liquidationist trend; it was not attempting to claim that its faction was the party and therefore it actively courted what it saw as more healthy, pro-party, Menshevik elements.\n\nFrom Justice ‘The International’ column 6 April 1912\n\nThe International Socialist Bureau [of the Second International] is sending out a statement regarding the party in Russia, of which the following is the substance:\n\nWhile during the last few years the Social Democratic Labour Party of Russia had fallen into a disorganised condition, it is now beginning to awaken to new life. A conference was recently convened (which had not been possible since 1908), where 20 organisations were represented. It held 23 sittings, where many questions of the utmost importance were dealt with, such as famine, labour insurance, trade unions and strikes, etc. A chairman was elected, and also the editorial staff of the central organ, Social-Democrat. The conference repudiated responsibility for the actions of any Russian socialist groups abroad, in so far as they are not directly affiliated with the party, which affiliation can only be effected by the agency of the party executive.\n\nThe conference also examined the question of the so-called ‘Liquidators’, who deny the existence of an illegal party, but at the same time take no steps to legalise themselves. The party had had trouble with this group, it was declared, for four years, and the conference passed a resolution to the effect that they had placed themselves outside the party.\n\nVorwärts[4] complains that the report is one-sided, and that the conference itself only represented the views of the Lenin group (which only represents a part of the Bolsheviks) and of a few Mensheviks of the Plekhanov school, who, however, have been repudiated by Plekhanov himself.[5] The Social Democracy of Lettland [Latvia], the Jewish Bund, the Social Democracy of Poland and of Lithuania, the Caucasian Committee, Vpered[6] and a number of other organisations, were not represented. Thus, a portion of the party has arrogated to itself the rights of the party as a whole, even to the point of expelling organisations that do not suit them. This action has stirred up much opposition among the majority of our Russian comrades, and on the initiative of the [Latvian party] it has been decided to convene a conference at which all the organisations will really be represented. An organisation commission has been appointed, which is engaged in preparations for this general conference. A strongly worded protest resolution has been passed by most of the organisations that were not represented at the former conference especially in view of the fact that it called itself by the name of ‘All-Russian’.\n\nThe [Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania] however, state that the authors of the [Vorwärts] protest are equally one-sided in the opposite direction, as they ignore the harm done by the ‘Liquidators’. They declare their repudiation of all attempts to split the party, whether these come from the right or from the left, and declare that until a party conference can be brought about that treats both points of view with equal consideration there can be no peace nor unity in the Russian movement.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] See D Brandenberger and M Zelenov Stalin’s master narrative: a critical edition of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) London 2019.\n\n[2] https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1314/tall-tales-of-1912/\n\n[3] https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/912/a-faction-is-not-a-party/\n\n[4] Vorwärts was a daily paper of the German SPD, first founded in 1876. The article referred to here was an anonymous article in the 26 March edition that appeared alongside an official statement. The anonymous article and its ‘Liquidator’ view of the 1912 RSDLP conference was strongly repudiated by Lenin in his March 1912 article ‘The anonymous writer in Vorwärts and the state of affairs in the RSDLP’. https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1912/mar/00d.htm\n\n[5] Georgi Plekhanov (1856-1918). The plenary meeting of the 1912 Prague conference had voted Plekhanov to be its delegate to the International Socialist Bureau. As the above article by Lenin makes clear, Plekhanov repudiated the 1912 conference, but he also repudiated the attempts of Bundist elements to convene a subsequent ‘Liquidators’ conference. A couple of Mensheviks attended the 1912 Prague conference, including Kiev delegate David Schwartzman, who chaired the credentials committee.\n\n[6] A group around Alexander Bogdanov (1873-1928) that emerged from the RSDLP’s Bolshevik faction.\n\nI stumbled over this British Socialist Party (BSP) debate on socialist unity and Labour Party affiliation recently after reading about it in a 1950s issue of the CPGB magazine World News. It was the debate that preceded the eventual affiliation of the BSP to Labour in 1916.\n\nIt’s wonderful, of course, to read these open political debates (consisting of many thousands of words across many weeks) in socialist newspapers such as the BSP’s Justice and looking at this actively reminded me of the type of culture exhibited in the CPGB’s Sunday Worker. Quite a contrast to the philistine and boring publications the socialist left has generally managed to produce since the Second World War.\n\nIt would be a mistake to make too much of one episode, however important it was, but it is very interesting that it doesn’t offer much support overall to the tendentious narratives that have grown up around the BSP or the Second International. In this short article, I will look at the challenge this material at least suggests for the essentially a priori, unmediated and circular notions that some of the left still use when considering these detailed topics. In passing, this material makes me think that a renewed study of the British socialist movement’s interactions with the Second International prior to the First World War, free of all the usual dogmatic preconceptions, would be a rich and profitable one.\n\nThe Second International as ‘letter-box’?\n\nA claim about the Second International was famously made by Zinoviev at the second congress of the Comintern (1920). He agreed with the characterisation of an article by Robert Grimm. “[Grimm] declares that the Second International and its executive was merely a letter-box. Quite correct.”[1] In other words, the Second International was a flabby and ineffective bulletin board that exchanged information between its national sections and didn’t properly organise to achieve anything concrete, in opposition to the militarised conceptions of the Comintern.\n\nIn terms of the BSP debate on Labour Party affiliation, this particular episode is not an example that Zinoviev could have made good use of. The Second International agreed two resolutions on party unity: the first in Amsterdam in 1904 and the second in Copenhagen in 1910. Both called for the principle of one socialist party in each nation state and drew attention to the increase in strength and influence that united parties could enjoy if they embarked on such a unity process. It was to that end that the International Socialist Bureau (ISB), the permanent organisation of the Second International, intervened in the British movement. Belgian socialists Camille Huysmans and Emile Vandervelde travelled to Britain in summer 1913 to oversee negotiations.\n\nThe minutes of the July 1913 meeting convened by the ISB (as openly reported in Justice) show that it was attended by representatives of the BSP, the Independent Labour Party (ILP, including Keir Hardie) and the Fabian Society, alongside Huysmans and Vandervelde (chair). Huysmans told the meeting that the policy of the ISB was a “double” one of the BSP joining the Labour Party and, in turn, the ILP was expected to unite its forces with those of the BSP.[2] In the words of one BSP representative, Dan Irving, this was conceptualised as the “socialist unity” of the BSP and ILP, and the task of “transforming the Labour Party into a declared socialist party”.[3] Huysmans emphasised that it was the task of the “two socialist organisations” to “go farther” and unite in rebutting an attempt by Hardie to forestall this by suggesting that the BSP should affiliate to the Labour Party and that the BSP and ILP should merely form a joint committee.[4] The minutes of the meeting show that the BSP and ILP were mutually antipathetic to one another, with Huysmans having to remind them that both had voted for the 1904 unity resolution in Amsterdam.[5] It does appear that the unity of the BSP and ILP was partly fudged by the meeting, with the proposal of a “United Socialist Council” and agreement that unity was not to be an immediate thing.[6]\n\nThe two ISB representatives were very clear in the labour press of the time what they were trying to achieve, and it is worth quoting from one interview at length.\n\nHuysmans said: “We are really trying to carry out the resolutions re: unity agreed to at the Amsterdam international congress [1904] and supported by the [British] sections. Just as there is one capitalist class, so there should be one socialist party. Differences have been adjusted in a number of European countries. Great strides have been made in France since they established a united party [the French Section of the Workers International, founded in 1905]. In Russia, unity is for the present impossible, as the movement has been driven underground and open propaganda made impossible.”\n\nHe added: “The continental comrades are convinced that the socialist movement would have much more influence in Britain if united. The socialists would play a bigger part in the general labour movement if they were at one among themselves. They would at the same time be a much greater power in the eyes of the capitalist class. By means of unity Britain would attain a stronger place in the international movement.”[7]\n\nVandervelde said: “In France there were special difficulties in the way of unity, greater than any in [Britain]. There was friction and internecine fighting, but the best comrades on both sides desired unity. Experience shows that rival parties are a hindrance to our progress.”\n\nHe added: “Socialist alliance with the trade unions [i.e. in the form of the Labour Party] is necessary in Britain and the experience of Belgium indicates what will be the future evolution of the British Labour Party. Before 1864 there were many different organisations in Belgium… When the party was first formed the majority protested against it being identified with socialism, and the socialist minority accepted the term Labour Party. Now the Belgian Labour Party [founded in 1885] is more socialist than some continental parties that call themselves by that name.”[8]\n\nThis is very familiar territory to anyone acquainted with the pre-First World War writings of Karl Kautsky and VI Lenin, representing a ‘merger’ of socialism with the working-class movement being facilitated by the maximum-possible unity of socialists. Figures such as Bruce Glasier of the ILP casted doubt on the effectiveness of the French party’s unity being proposed as an example for the British groups.[9] Rosalind Travers, a part of the BSP group that didn’t wish to affiliate to the Labour Party, was also sceptical of the ISB’s arguments in 1913, arguing that events in Germany, Denmark and Holland indicated a trend “away from revision” on the part of international social democracy.[10] But even this type of sectarian wishful thinking couldn’t quite disguise the benefits of socialist unity. Travers added: “The congress of Gotha [of the German SPD in 1875] may be cited as a model in some sort for the possible union of the BSP with the Labour Party. Certainly the projected programme upon which ‘Lassallians’ and ‘Eisenachists’ met contained, in [August] Bebel’s eyes, a number of concessions and heresies. But we must remember that this congress did not take place till 1875 when [Jean Baptista von] Schweitzer had long left the Lassallian party, and both groups had given very sound proofs of their devotion to the cause by spending many months in prison.”[11] The merger theory was also on show from those BSP members keen to get to grips with the Labour Party. “Now is our opportunity… Here, then, is a nucleus that may be influenced by a strong, alert, capable body of socialists affiliated to them for political and parliamentary action.”[12]\n\nIntelligent readers will perceive that the ISB’s venture in Britain in 1913-14 was very far from the activities of a ‘letter-box’ and, indeed, suggests that its activity was in accord with similar interventions in Belgium and France. Neither does this example suggest that Second International resolutions were merely rhetorical injunctions in the ‘apple-pie-and-motherhood’ mode.\n\nSecond International ‘opportunism’?\n\nHuysmans and Vandervelde offered principled and rational reasons to their British comrades for socialist unity in line with the execution of the merger between socialism and the working class. In places, it is not clear to me that they fully understood the principle of ‘unity in difference’, which is the only true philosophical conception to actualise a socialist unity offensive.\n\nSpeaking from the chair at the July 1913 unity conference, Vandervelde, in response to comments that the revolutionaries of the BSP couldn’t possibly work alongside moderate, liberal elements inside the ILP, said: “If the BSP contains extremist elements, the other parties comprise ‘liberalising’ elements. Unity will have the effect of rendering both extremes harmless.”[13] Vandervelde was also paraphrased by The Daily Citizen on similar lines: “Questioned about the difficulties in the way of unity created by extremists who sought to impose their individual will at all costs upon the movement, M. Vandervelde replied that these men were to be found at both ends of the movement, at the left and at the right, but experience had shown that in a bigger movement, resulting from fusion, the extremist elements were put in their place by the common sense of average opinion. They lost influence and the reasoned policy of the majority carried the day.”[14]\n\nVandervelde is talking some truth here given that in the process of fusion of a serious socialist organisation, one would expect the prima donnas, the cranks and ‘sects of one’ to be quickly sidelined in any successful endeavour. I have some very limited experience of this in the Socialist Labour Party (1996 vintage), the Socialist Alliance (2001 vintage) and even in the small-scale process of communist rapprochement that the CPGB-PCC undertook from the mid-1990s. Nevertheless, there is a sense from Vandervelde that differences would be reduced to a ‘common-sense average’ (although I do wonder how much justice has been done to Vandervelde by his English translators). This does, potentially, move internal socialist politics onto the terrain of mushy compromise and away from the conception of ‘unity in difference’. BSP members also showed in a number of places that they didn’t really understand this conception either. Harry Quelch, opposed to the BSP’s affiliation to the Labour Party, could only conceive of unity in the sense of the BSP “hauling down the flag” before the trade-union leaders of the Labour Party, given that the latter would not be likely to acquiesce before the BSP, this being “the effect of such agreement as the ‘unity’ suggested would involve”.[15] However, Fred Gorle, part of the wing of the BSP that was enthusiastic about affiliation in line with the merger theory, argued that the BSP could argue inside the Labour Party “without losing our identity”.[16]\n\nIn fact, it was the ILP members who perhaps had the better conception of ‘unity in difference’ in this particular debate. At the unity conference, Keir Hardie argued: “The BSP would go in [the Labour Party] as an organisation. If at any time the Labour Party did not contest a seat [that] you considered should be contested, and were prepared to contest, you would be at liberty to do so.”[17] WC Anderson of the ILP added: “… apart from the common name [of the Labour Party], you can make your address as revolutionary as you like.”[18] Fenner Brockway also underlined that affiliated organisations were not tied to the policy of the parliamentary Labour Party, although there was also an undertone of loyalty and the need for “kindly and constructive”[19] criticism, which can be, of course, codewords for censorship.\n\nNevertheless, this episode offers little straightforward support for the notion of an all-embracing pre-1914 Second International ‘opportunism’.\n\n[1] https://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/2nd-congress/ch06.htm\n\n[2] ‘Report of the unity conference’ Justice 9 August 1913.\n\n[3] Ibid.\n\n[4] Ibid.\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n[6] Ibid.\n\n[7] ‘Socialist unity’ The Daily Citizen 21 July 1913.\n\n[8] Ibid.\n\n[9] ‘Report of the unity conference’ op cit.\n\n[10] R Travers ‘Socialist unity and the Labour Party’ Justice 11 October 1913.\n\n[11] Ibid.\n\n[12] G Moore Bell ‘Ought the BSP to join the Labour Party?’ Justice 9 August 1913\n\n[13] ‘Report of the unity conference’ op cit\n\n[14] ‘Socialist unity’ op cit.\n\n[15] H Quelch ‘Ought the BSP to join the Labour Party?’ Justice 16 August 1913.\n\n[16] F Gorle ‘Shall we raise the red flag within the Labour Party?’ Justice 2 August 1913.\n\n[17] ‘Report of the unity conference’ op cit.\n\n[18] Ibid.\n\n[19] F Brockway ‘Socialists of Britain, unite!’ Justice 30 April 1914.\n\nThese notes carry on an earlier small piece of research that I undertook in 2017. The completed article back then detailed a minor ideological rebellion by Rajani Palme Dutt, the Communist Party of Great Britain’s (CPGB’s) leading theoretician, in the 1930s on the issue of the reputation of Karl Kautsky (1854-1938). Dutt, as a good ‘Leninist’, upheld Lenin’s view of Kautsky as a leading Marxist theoretician who had betrayed his earlier writings in 1914. The general trend on the ‘Leninist’-influenced left (pro-Soviet, Trotskyist and Maoist) was simply to forget that Lenin had continued to value Kautsky’s pre-1914 contribution to Marxism, even after Russia’s democratic revolution of 1917. Instead, the general tendency was to view Kautsky as a ‘renegade’ (after the title of Lenin’s mostly unread 1918 work The proletarian revolution and the renegade Kautsky) burdened with a ‘determinist’ interpretation of Marxism. Dutt, by contrast, showed strong signs of understanding perfectly the nature of Lenin’s appreciation of pre-1914 Kautsky, even after the latter came under sustained ideological attack by the Soviet bureaucracy in the 1930s.[1]\n\nThe CPGB, and Dutt himself, carried on elements of this understanding after the Second World War. However, there were plenty of continued references in CPGB literature to The proletarian revolution and the renegade Kautsky and, as we shall see, plenty of criticism of Kautsky’s pre-1914 Marxism. The CPGB’s narrative around Kautsky thus continued to be a fractured and contested one.\n\n‘The best days of Kautsky’\n\nIn September 1953, Idris Cox reviewed the recently published second volume of Stalin’s Works for CPGB weekly World News and Views. Cox argued correctly: “Stalin sets out in this volume to trounce all those who had lost faith in the masses, who conceived the bourgeois revolution in Russia as a mere repetition of the 1789 French Revolution, which could be led only by the Russian bourgeoisie. In this task he took full advantage of Karl Kautsky’s pamphlet The driving forces and prospects of the Russian Revolution. This was in the best days of Kautsky, before he had thrown overboard the revolutionary kernel of Marx’s teachings.”[2] (Cox added that “Stalin quotes Kautsky over and over again”;[3] we do have to bear in mind that Stalin is writing a preface to a 1907 Georgian edition of the aforementioned Kautsky pamphlet and so perhaps this would be better rendered as Stalin quotes Kautsky approvingly over and over.)\n\nA few things can be noted in relation to this. First, Cox had joined the CPGB in the mid-1920s and was most probably aware that the Comintern of the 1920s had a much more nuanced view of Kautsky’s legacy than just simply labelling him a ‘renegade’ (for example, some of Kautsky’s books were on the reading list for the Moscow Lenin School, for the Comintern’s international cadre, in 1927[4]). Second, it is slightly unorthodox for Cox to be highlighting Stalin’s approval, given that the 1938 Short Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) had suggested (against the historical record) that the political influence of the Second International on the Bolsheviks was negligible. However, Stalin’s enthusiastic appreciation of Kautsky gave the Soviet editors of Stalin’s Works a problem of interpretation, which they resolved in the first volume by appending a note that in 1905-07, Kautsky “had not yet gone over to the camp of the opportunists” and the revolutionary events in Russia in those years caused “Kautsky to take the stand of revolutionary Social Democracy on several questions”.[5] This was therefore a fractured narrative and, in that sense, Cox was following the line of those Soviet contradictions.\n\nThe understanding of Kautsky that Cox displayed was also a feature of other writing in the 1950s from those who had joined the CPGB in the 1920s. Andrew Rothstein, a foundation member of the party, also writing in September 1953 in the Dutt-edited Labour Monthly, was engaged in the second part of a polemic with Labour politician John Strachey. Rothstein had cause to refer back to Eduard Bernstein’s revisionism of 1899, which “announced to the world that economic evolution, unforeseen by Marx, had made Marx out of date: that his ‘theory of increasing misery’ had been disproved by events”. Rothstein added: “Karl Kautsky’s biting reply, ‘Criticism of the theory and practice of Marxism’ (he was still a Marxist then), could still be read with profit by British socialists. They would probably agree with Kautsky that ‘as if in virtue of some psychological law, all critics of Marx move along one and the same path, whatever their point of departure’. And it is worth remembering that Bernstein’s ideas gained the upper hand in the German Social-Democratic Party by 1907 ­– with the result that Germany and all Europe were ‘rolled in mud and blood’ in 1914-18.”[6] This has the same understanding of Kautsky displayed by Cox, including the argument that 1907 was a pivotal moment in the shift of Germany Social-Democracy to non-revolutionary politics. A few years later, Robin Page Arnot, another CPGB foundation member, compared Kautsky to Social Democratic Federation leader Henry Hyndman. Arnot said that the two writers’ “pre-war parade of Marxism did not prevent them from denouncing the one Marxist party of Europe [that] had been true to the teachings of Marx and had led the workers and peasants of their country in the revolution”.[7]\n\nFrom 1907 to 1914\n\nArnot has slightly moved the dial here from ‘Kautsky being a Marxist’ to 1907 to a generic ‘pre-war’ designation. Dutt himself followed up on this point of periodisation. In 1957, he wrote on the Middle East that “[Zionism] sought to solve the so-called ‘Jewish question’ (actually, feudal and capitalist fomenting of anti-semitism), not by the advance of the progressive democratic movement, but by herding off all Jews into what Kautsky – when he wrote on the question as a Marxist in 1914, expressing the viewpoint of the international socialist movement – called a project for an ‘international ghetto’”.[8] Along similar lines, Dutt wrote in 1961 that the “most famous Marxist journal of the old pre-1914 era, the Neue Zeit edited by Kautsky, founded in 1883, perished physically in its 40th year, after it had perished morally nine years earlier in 1914”.[9] This is Dutt echoing the arguments in his short Lenin book of 1933[10] and moving beyond the cramped confines of Stalin’s Short course and the later amendment in Soviet ideology, which argued Kautsky had been a healthy figure in Marxism up to 1907 i.e. when Stalin was positively quoting Kautsky. Dutt was reasonably safe in extending his positive appreciation, partly, as before, he could rely on Lenin’s authority but also because Khrushchev had highlighted at least some of the sectarian narrowness of the Soviet history produced in the Stalin period.\n\nDutt was more expansive on the subject of Kautsky in his 1964 book The Internationale: a historical survey of 100 years featuring the First, Second and Third internationals (reviewed positively by unlikely figures such as Eric Hobsbawm because of Dutt’s more critical attitude to the past).[11] He picked up on Lenin’s effusive praise of Kautsky’s article of 1902, ‘Slavs and revolution’, that had been quoted in the former’s ‘Left-wing’ communism (1920).[12] Dutt argued that Kautsky was, at this point in time, “the recognised international theorist and spokesman of Marxism after the death of Marx and Engels”.[13] In terms of the German Social-Democratic Party, Dutt said it was “regarded as the model party… as the guardian of Marxist theory (its leading theorist, Kautsky, and organ, Die Neue Zeit, were regarded generally as the oracles of Marxism after the death of Engels until the First World War)…”[14] Dutt saw the debate over ‘Millerandism’ at the 1900 Paris congress of the Second International around the participation of socialists in capitalist governments as exemplifying Kautsky’s role in the “Marxist centre”, which Dutt characterised as combining “the abstract form of a Marxist theoretical analysis with a practical evasion of the issue, thus in practice leaving the door open to the right wing”.[15] In contrast to the role of this “centre”, Dutt counterposed the “Marxist left, represented consistently by Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and also to some extent, though less consistently and clearly, by Rosa Luxembourg and the left in German Social-Democracy and other parties”.[16] However, Dutt recognised that the Bolsheviks “fought alongside the centre against revisionism”, coupling this with more obvious Stalinist myths such as the one that Lenin and the Bolsheviks “recognised the necessity of a split with the reformists”,[17] which was patently not the case in 1912. Dutt was noticeably more enthusiastic about Kautsky’s legacy than Moscow’s rejigged History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1960) of the period, which offered a more familiar litany of Kautsky being a “centrist” and a distorter of Marx’s writings on the state.[18]\n\nTheories of surplus value\n\nThis theme of Kautsky as a distorter of Marx’s writings, particularly the former’s editing of the subsequently published Theories of surplus value (the so-called ‘fourth volume’ of Capital) in 1905-10 was also apparent in CPGB writings of the 1960s. This argument appeared a few times in the ‘Editorial comments’ section of Marxism Today, usually composed by James Klugmann. In February 1964, readers were told: “Kautsky, it seems, took a good many liberties with the text as Marx had left it. Mainly, he altered the order of presentation. But he also toned down certain passages where he thought Marx was too vehement in his expressions. For example, Marx had referred to certain bourgeois economists as ‘asses’, but Kautsky changed this.”[19] Similarly, in June 1969 it was noted that “Kautsky’s editions suffered from serious defects – arbitrary re-arrangement of the material, cuts, omission of important words and of whole passages so that the original meaning is muffled or distorted”.[20]\n\nThese comments were reflecting what the CPGB’s Emile Burns had broadcast to the party in the 1951 English translation of Theories of surplus value. He said in the foreword: “Kautsky’s editing of Marx’s manuscript has been criticised both for its arrangement of the various sections, which differs considerably from that of the manuscript, and for the omission of important passages.”[21] Burns makes reference to a new edition then being prepared in the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow, so it is pretty obvious where he picked up this line of argument. When this new edition was translated into English in 1963 (by Burns himself), this was expanded upon in the preface from what was then the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, on behalf of the central committee of the CPSU. It concludes of Kautsky’s editing of Marx’s manuscripts: “The complete disregard of Marx’s table of contents, the arbitrary and incorrect arrangement of the manuscript material, the objectivist titles which avoid the class essence of the conceptions criticised by Marx, the obscuring of the fundamental antithesis between Marx’s economic teaching and the whole bourgeois political economy, the removal of a number of passages containing important theses of revolutionary Marxism, from which Kautsky more and more departed – all this suggests that what we have here is not only gross violations of the elementary requirements of a scientific edition, but also the direct falsification of Marxism.”[22] This is therefore another example of CPGB writers following the contours and contradictions of a fractured Soviet narrative about Kautsky.\n\nEurocommunists and Kautsky\n\nAs the Eurocommunists gained ascendancy in the CPGB in the 1970s there was a small shift towards highlighting Kautsky’s influence on Lenin. In 1979, the CPGB’s Monty Johnstone interviewed French communist historian Jean Elleinstein, who appeared to want to use German Social-Democracy as some kind of foundation for a Eurocommunist perspective. “Until 1914 Lenin was a social democrat. He was a disciple of Kautsky. Well, I think that we must not understand the term social democrat in the [Helmut] Schmidt and [James] Callaghan sense. I would differentiate myself totally from that because in their case reforms are not linked to a revolutionary perspective.”[23]\n\nWhen Eurocommunist-influenced writers such as Hobsbawm considered Kautsky and Lenin’s consideration of class consciousness from the early 20th century they were stuck in a familiar creaking tale of a “distinction between the purely ‘trade-unionist’ class consciousness which, [Lenin] argued, was all that the workers would develop by themselves, and the ‘socialist consciousness’ which would be brought into their movement from outside”.[24] For Hobsbawm, as with much of the bourgeois narrative about this issue, the point around the origins of class consciousness becomes one of fixed poles between ‘outside’ intellectuals and workers. Therefore, Hobsbawm argued: “In countries without… political legality, or with young and inexperienced movements of the labouring classes, the task of creating effective national political or class mobilisations, may be difficult or impossible without outside initiative and participation.”[25] This completely obscures the emphasis of Kautsky and Lenin, who weren’t interested in creating such schematic poles but rather in the merger of socialism (and socialist consciousness etc) and the workers’ movement. Class mobilisations would stand or fall to the extent to which this merger was successful. This suggests that Hobsbawm’s recognition of Kautsky’s influence on Lenin was formal at best and is reflective of the overall shallow way the issue was treated by the CPGB.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe end up with the perhaps unexpected conclusion that the CPGB’s post-war narrative on Karl Kautsky as a pre-1914 Marxist was often accurate, even if it was a hesitant and sometimes shallow engagement. Kautsky’s influence on Lenin and the Marxist trends within the Second International was, led by the influence of Dutt and other foundation members, generally acknowledged. Where Kautsky’s legacy seemed doubtful, such as in relation to his editing on Theories of surplus value, this was at least underpinned by serious Soviet projects to re-publish and reclaim such works in the post-war period. It’s also reasonably clear why the CPGB was able to approach Kautsky’s legacy in a sensible manner. Dutt basically held on to the conceptions he had held since 1930s. He had studied Lenin carefully and knew the depth of the latter’s attachment to pre-1914 Kautsky. Dutt’s intellectual influence percolated through the CPGB even when his support for Stalin had become controversial for some of the party in the mid-1950s. The tendency of post-war Soviet ideology may have been negative towards Kautsky but its aspiration to completeness meant that, for example, Stalin’s 1907 praise for the former had to be published and couldn’t easily be explained away in terms of the negative anti-Kautsky predilections of the 1938 Short course. This essentially fractured narrative meant that more of the truth was told.\n\n[1] https://communistpartyofgreatbritainhistory.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/palme-dutt-and-karl-kautsky/\n\n[2] I Cox ‘Stalin’s fight for a revolutionary Marxist policy’ World News and Views 19 September 1953.\n\n[3] Ibid.\n\n[4] H Wicks Keeping my head: the memoirs of a British Bolshevik London 1992, p35.\n\n[5] JV Stalin Works Volume 1 1901-1907 Moscow 1954, p408.\n\n[6] A Rothstein ‘Old fallacies for new, II’ The Labour Monthly September 1953.
