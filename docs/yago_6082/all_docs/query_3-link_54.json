        "text": "Megastar Amitabh Bachchan shared a heart-warming black and white photograph showing him and his actress wife Jaya on the occasion of their 45th wedding anniversary on Sunday.\n\nHe wrote: \"The flowers and wishes adorn the house...our wedding anniversary, June 3, 1973. Now 45 years.\n\nIt is said that many people did not really approve of their match.\n\nIn an interview, Amitabh Bachchan recalled how they fell for each other. Amitabh for the very first time saw Jaya on the cover of a magazine. Jaya who was known as Jaya Baduri was more established in the industry than Amitabh, who was still struggling to make his mark in the industry.\n\nAmitabh always wanted a woman he thought was a perfect blend of traditionalism and a modern outlook, and he thought Jaya came across exactly like that in the picture. He also said that the thing which really caught his attention was Jaya's beautiful eyes.\n\nIt was much later that Hrishikesh Mukherjee came up with the script of Guddi, and Amitabh was cast opposite to Jaya.\n\nRecalling that it was not a love at first sight for both of them, Jaya said, âWhen I was introduced to him on the sets of Guddi, I was impressed. I was somewhat in awe as he was Harivanshrai Bachchanâs son and gradually I liked his persona.â\n\nFor Amitabh, it was at the sets of Ek Nazar that he fell for Jaya.\n\nAfter becoming very close to each other, Amitabh had promised to take a trip abroad with Jaya if their film Zanjeer became a success. And as we know, it was a huge hit at the box office. But, Amitabhâs father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan had serious qualms about his son traveling abroad without getting married to Jaya first.\n\nAnd so, Amitabh decided that it was time for them to tie the knot. When Jaya consented, the marriage was held in a haste. The wedding was not very grand. The clandestine wedding was arranged at a friendâs house and the couple left for London the very next day. Their very first visit to the UK became a honeymoon!\n\nOn the constant link-up rumours that the Bachchan family has faced in the past, Jaya says she never questioned Amitabh Bachchan. She had said, \"I totally trust my husband and I know this industry. I have never been threatened or felt insecure about anything he did.\" Amitabh too said in the interview that he was never bothered by any gossips that surrounded him.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya had said in the interview that Abhishek and Shweta are the best part of their relationship. During the making of Sholay, Jaya Bachchan was pregnant with her first child. The entire unit, including Amitabh Bachchan, took care of her. Harsh weather conditions and hectic shooting schedules used to exhaust Jaya. But she recalled in the interview how Amitabh, Hema, Dharmendra and others stood by her throughout the shooting of the film.\n\nIt was this love that they felt for each other that really gave them the firm foundation to build a marriage that has lasted over 45 years now!Â"
