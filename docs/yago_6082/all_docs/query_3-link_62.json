        "text": "Navya Naveli Nanda’s podcast, What the Hell Navya’s season 2 finale episode will have some heartwarming discussions between Jaya Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan, and Navya centered on the topic of ‘friendship’. The promo for the episode begins with Jaya Bachchan saying, “Mere sabse acche dost mere ghar ke andar hain (My best friends are within my house).” She also made a very heartwarming comment about her dynamics with Amitabh Bachchan. Have a look…\n\nThe video clip shows Navya Naveli Nanda posing a question: “If two people are just friends, do you think it’s correct to put romance in between a friendship?” The promo for episode 10 of ‘What The Hell Navya’ also presents us with a glimpse into the relationship of Jaya Bachchan with Amitabh Bachchan, where the ‘Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani’ actress mentions how her husband is her best friend. The promo proceeds with Jaya Bachchan’s heartfelt revelation, “But it’s true. My husband is my best friend. I don’t hide anything from him.”\n\nWell, Jaya Bachchan’s sweet disclosure about her bond with Amitabh Bachchan is so cute. I feel it’s really important to have a strong foundation of friendship between a couple. Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan perfectly define a successful marriage, and may they continue to teach us insightful lessons about a long-lasting marital bond!"
