The duo tied the knot on June 3, 1973, in an intimate wedding ceremony. The couple had their share of ups and downs but the couple and now after 50 years of being together the couple is an inspiration to many.\n\nLet's take a look at their glorious love story that will reinstate your faith in love and marriage.\n\nWhen did their eyes meet\n\nAs per various media reports, Jaya Bhaduri and Amitabh Bachchan's first meeting was at the Pune Film Institute. Amitabh Bachchan arrived there with some other actors and director K.Abbas. At that time, Amitabh Bachchan was still a struggling actor. Jaya Bachchan was a big star back then.\n\nWhen they first met\n\nBoth Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri had seen each other but they never really officially met till they were introduced to each other by Hrishikesh Mukherjee on the sets of Guddi.\n\nIn an interview, Jaya Bachchan shared that she was impressed by Amitabh Bachchan when she first met him because he was Harivanshrai Bachchan's son. She shared that she always felt that he was different and will make it big in the industry.

She said this in the podcast of her granddaughter Navya Naveli Nanda, What the Hell Navya. Jaya and Navya were joined on the show, as always, by Shweta Bachchan Nanda. The subject of the new episode was 'Modern Love: Romance & Regrets'.\n\nWhen Navya asked Jaya about her love story, the actor shared how before marrying her, Amitabh Bachchan had one condition. \"We had decided we will marry in October because by then my work would have reduced. But he had told me, 'I definitely don't want a wife who will be 9 to 5. Please work, but not every day. You choose your projects and work with the right people,\" Jaya recalled.\n\nLater, Amitabh and Jaya welcomed their first child, Shweta Bachchan on March 17, 1974. However, their family got completed after they embraced parenthood for the second time and welcomed their son, Abhishek Bachchan on February 5, 1976. And now, Amitabh and Jaya are loving grandparents to their grandkids, Navya Naveli Nanda, Agastya Nanda, and Aaradhya Bachchan. And now, as the couple completed 50 years of marital bliss, their daughter, Shweta dropped an unseen glimpse to wish them on their special day.\n\nShweta Bachchan shares a throwback picture of her parents, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan on their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, Shweta Bachchan took to her Instagram handle and wished her parents, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan, their 50th wedding anniversary.
