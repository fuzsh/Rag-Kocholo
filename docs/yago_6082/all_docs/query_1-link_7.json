        "text": "If there’s one thing we have learnt from B-town celebrities, it’s that love triumphs it all! No matter how tough the circumstances be, what this glamorous life throws at you, the cons of being an actor or the scandals and rumours you become a part of; your partner stands by you throughout and if there’s understanding and love, then nothing can break the pillar of your relationship. Celeb couples being stuck on separate sets, cities and even countries owing to their work commitments, away from each other and with irresistibly attractive co-stars, serves as a perfect recipe for major conjectures in the media. Some prove to be true, some fade away as just mere speculations but every rumour finds a permanent place in their fans’ mind.\n\nSuch was the story of Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Rekha. It was in 1973 when the Angry Man of Bollywood, Amitabh had broken the hearts of millions of girls and had married his ladylove, Jaya Bhaduri. But by the end of the 70s, the reports of Amitabh falling for his Do Anjaane co-star, Rekha had made its way to the industry grapevine and became the cover story for most magazines. Then came Yash Chopra’s film, Silsila in 1981, which brought the real-life love triangle of Amitabh, Jaya and Rekha to the big screen and the trio was asked about the same in interviews and media interactions. Soon, Rekha became the ‘other woman’ and the stories in media were all about the rifts created between Jaya and Amitabh because of his rumoured extra-marital affair.\n\nWe have often seen Jaya Bachchan losing her calm at paparazzi and media, but Amitabh Bachchan is known for being calm and composed during interviews. However, there was a time when Big B had lost his cool during an interview. As mentioned by Scroll, journalist, Karan Thapar had revealed about an incident in his book, Devil’s Advocate: The Untold Story, when Amitabh had lost his cool on his wife, Jaya after their interview. Recalling his 1992 interview with Mr and Mrs Bachchan at his place, Pratiksha, to mark Amitabh’s fiftieth birthday, Karan revealed that everything was going smoothly until the interviewer had asked him about the women in his life.\n\nAlso Read: When Yash Chopra Had Revealed Why He Was Scared To Film Jaya Bachchan And Rekha Together In Silsila\n\nWhen Karan Thapar had asked Amitabh Bachchan,\n\n“So, let me do to you what that interviewer did to Warren Beatty. There have been a lot of stories of your alleged love affairs with actresses. After your marriage, have you had an affair with any other woman?”\n\nWith an unperturbed face, Big B had replied, “No. never.” Karan had probed him further, “They say you’ve had an affair with Parveen Babi. Is there any truth to that story?” Mr Bachchan had retorted, “No. I too have read such stories. They’re not true. But I can’t stop magazines writing this sort of stuff.” When Karan had asked, “What about Rekha?” he had replied, “No, not even with her.” Big B didn’t say more.\n\nThen Karan Thapar had turned to Jaya Bachchan, who was sitting beside her husband on the sofa, and asked if she believed Amitabh Bachchan. Taken aback, Mrs Bachchan had said,“I always believe my husband.” On being probed further, “Do you really mean that, or are you only saying it because he’s sitting beside you?” she had smiled and answered, “Of course I mean it. Why should I not?”\n\nKaran then changed the topic and moved on with the questions he came prepared with. Post the interview, the Bachchans had insisted Karan and his team to stay for lunch. Then something happened which proved that all the while, Amitabh had let the anger built up inside him and it was taken out at Jaya at the dining table.\n\nIt started when Jaya Bachchan had asked Amitabh Bachchan if he would like some rice. To which, he had snapped,\n\n“You know I never eat rice. Why are you offering me something I never have?”\n\nMrs Bachchan had explained, “I’m only offering you rice because, as yet, the rotis haven’t come.”\n\nKaran had written in his book, ““I’ll just check what’s happened to the rotis,” Jaya said. I’m sure she was trying to calm him but then, unthinkingly, she added, “Why don’t you have a little rice in the meantime?” “Stop it. Just stop it,” he replied. “I’ve said I don’t want rice and I’m happy to wait for the rotis. Can’t you understand that? What’s the matter with you? Why can’t you just listen to what I’m saying?”\n\nJaya left the room and never returned. Shortly afterwards the rotis appeared and Amitabh started eating. The rest of us, however, had no appetite left.”"
