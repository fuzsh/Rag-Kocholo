        "text": "Tillotama Shome as Lipika Saikia Rao in The Night Manager or Isheeta in Lust Stories 2? It's hard to pick which one we like more, but one thing is certain - she is one of the few actors who gets inside the skin of the character and becomes the character she's playing on the screen. Time and again, Shome has impressed the viewers with the offbeat roles she has picked. Be it Ratna in Sir, where she shines in the unique romantic film or Kanwar Singh in Qissa: The Tale of a Lonely Ghost, she evokes numerous emotions within you.\n\nShome, over the years, has pushed boundaries and turned each role into the winner. The actress is known for her work, but very few know she's also closely related to the Bachchan family.\n\nTillotama Shome is related to Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and the rest of the Bachchan family. Here's how\n\nShome is related to the Bachchans through her marriage to Jaya Bachchan's nephew Kunal Ross, according to Mid-Day. Ross's mother is Jaya Bachchan's sister. Shome's husband is an advertising professional-turned-entrepreneur and founder and CEO of a coffee portal, The Indian Bean. According to the coffee portal, he studied hospitality at the Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration in Mysore.\n\nAccording to Mid-Day, Shome and Ross married as per Bengali tradition in a destination wedding in Goa which the entire Bachchan family attended. Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan and Aaradhya Bachchan were part of the D-day.\n\nTweeting about the event, Big B had written, “Weddings are an institution by themselves, in Goa for Bengali family wedding. I need to write a book on this! Such fun!!!”"
