        "text": "Veteran actress Farida Jalal has been in Bollywood for a long time. Over all these years, she has been close to some of the biggest stars in the industry, like Amitabh Bachcan and Jaya Bachchan, with whom Farida Jalal has acted in multiple movies even before the power couple were married.\n\nSpeaking about the same in a new interview with Bollywood Bubble, Farida Jalal talked about the time when she would often accompany Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan on coffee dates to the Taj Hotel and go on long drives while the two were still in their courtship period.\n\nRecalling the times she spent with the power couple before they got married, Farida Jalal said, “Mai Pali Hill mein rehti thi aur Amit Ji Juhu mein. Unki shaadi hone wali thi, hui nahi thi. Dono mein courtship chal raha tha aur jhagde jaise couple ke hote hai aapas mein waise hote the. Amit Ji raat ke waqt khud gaadi chalate the, aur Jaya bagal mein baithti, aur main peeche. Mai unko bolti thi ki mujhe ‘Kabab mein haddi banake kyun laate ho aap log?’”\n\nShe then continued, “I was someone who used to go to bed early, but they would still call me. And they kept on fighting, and I witnessed it. Jaya roti thi, woh manaate the. I used to love those moments. My friendship with Jaya goes a long way. I lovingly called her Jiya. While returning from those coffee dates, they used to talk about films. They then dropped me off and went home. All I can say is that they are lovely people. They called me and Gulzar Saab to their wedding. No one else from the industry was there.”\n\nIn conclusion, Farida Jalal clarified that while Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan regularly fought, they were never serious, calling the reason behind their quarrels “stupid.”\n\nShe added, “Unke jhagade bahut stupid baton pe hote jo main nahi bata sakti. Lekin baccho ki tarah hote wo jhagade. Aise koi buri baat nahi hoti thi, pyaar mohabbat ki ache baatein hoti thi. Ye jaldi ruth bhi jaati thi naa Jaya.”"
