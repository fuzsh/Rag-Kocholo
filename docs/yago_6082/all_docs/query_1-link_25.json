        "text": "Bachchan wedding: A modest affair with limited enthusiasm\n\nThe wedding was a modest event with only five baraatis, including Harivansh and political leader Sanjay Gandhi. Harivansh noted in his book that Jaya's family did not seem particularly enthusiastic about the wedding. He wrote about how Jaya's parents desired a Bengali-style marriage ceremony, which wasn't opposed by the groom's family yet, he observed an absence of joy among Jaya's family members during these proceedings.\n\nTraditional rituals and quiet celebrations marked the wedding\n\nThe first stage of the wedding was the var-puja, a veneration of the groom. This involved Jaya's father visiting Amitabh's residence with gifts and conducting a small ceremony. Harivansh reciprocated by doing the same for Jaya. He noted that Amitabh's haldi ceremony was conducted quietly. The baraat was received without any fanfare, and upon reaching the mandap, they found Jaya, then known as Jaya Bhaduri, dressed as a bride. Harivansh noticed a genuine shyness on her face.\n\n'My family is utterly ruined'\n\nThe Bachchan family misled their neighbors about the reason for decorations at their house, attributing it to an upcoming film shoot featuring Amitabh. After the ceremony concluded, his observations about the Bhaduri family not being completely happy were confirmed. He wrote, \"Before we left, I embraced the father of my new daughter-in-law and congratulated him on getting a son-in-law like Amit, expecting him to say the same in respect of Jaya. But he said, 'My family is utterly ruined.'\"\n\nBachchans: A flourishing family post-wedding"
