        "text": "Amitbah Bachchan shared his experience of attending Anant Ambani’s wedding. The Bollywood superstar attended the grand wedding with his family, Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. Although Amitabh posed with Jaya, Shweta and Abhishek, Aishwarya made a separate entrance. After his and the Bachchan family’s photos and videos from the wedding went viral, Big B took to his blog to share his thoughts about the wedding.\n\nSharing the post at 3:44 AM, Amitabh admitted it was late but confessed he wanted to share the experience. “Yes .. the desire and the will to connect even at this unearthly hour – to some – to many it is time for work … but for me I need to utilise the time for the Ef connect .. Back from a glorious wedding and the feel after a very long time of public exposure, the wealth of love and affection that I can possibly think of with so many old acquaintances,” he said.\n\n“They seemed to have changed in their physiognomy, but extremely sincere in their affection towards the association and the love of our times well spent together .. This is what life is all about .. the associations and love and care,” Amitabh added.\n\n“It is strange how the little things that matter to each other , remain, but those that had a deeper association or a meaningful spent time, is lost and forgotten .. well not really forgotten , but kept on the back burner, and remembered or brought out only when there is required meaning of the association,” the Kalki 2898 AD star said.\n\nAmitabh grabbed attention for several reasons at the wedding. While he had everyone talking with his appearance on the red carpet, videos also showed him reunite with Deepika Padukone and Shah Rukh Khan. A video showed SRK touching Amitabh’s feet and warmingly greeting Jaya Bachchan. Another video showed Amitabh talking to Deepika and Ranveer."
