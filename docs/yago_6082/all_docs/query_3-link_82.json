        "text": "They say, most celebrity weddings don’t last and often end up in a divorce. However, there are some Bollywood couples who have stuck by each other through thick and thin and proved this theory wrong.\n\nCase in point, Amitabh And Jaya Bachchan.\n\nJust like their movies, their love story was full of drama, naysayers, link-ups and romance, of course, and had a happy ending.\n\nThe ‘Shahenshah’ of Bollywood married his co-star of several movies, Jaya Bhaduri on his father’s impromptu instructions on 3 June 1973.\n\nHe shared on his social media last year, “47 years .. today .. June 3, 1973 .. !! Had decided if Zanjeer would succeed, we would along with a few friends go to London for the first time .. My Father asked who you going with? When i told him who, he said you must marry her before you go .. else you don’t go .. So .. I obeyed .. !!”\n\nNow, four decades later, they are still together and going strong, regardless of the many obstacles that came their way over the years.\n\nThere’s so much to take from one of the most adorable and OG couples of Bollywood for a happy, long marriage.\n\nHere are all the times that Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan were pure couple goals and served lessons from their 48 years of marriage that made us believe that there is a happily ever after.\n\n1. In Sickness And In Health...Literally\n\nAmitabh got severely injured on set during a fighting scene for Coolie and was declared ‘clinically dead’. Jaya was with him the entire time, praying, caring and nursing him back to health.\n\nShe said in an interview with Simi Garewal, \"I had the prayer book in my hand, hanuman chalisa. Dr Dastoor passed by and said, ‘It’s only your prayers that’ll help.’\n\n2. Trust Is The Pillar Of A Marriage\n\nThe heartthrob of cinema, Bachchan was linked with a lot of actresses he worked with at the time but that was never an issue for his very trusting wife.\n\nIn fact, she once said, “I totally trust my husband and I know this industry. I have never been threatened or felt insecure about anything he did.”\n\n3. Splitting House Work Equally\n\nAmitabh and Jaya Bachchan apparently share their chores equally.\n\nJaya once said that he lets her sit back and relax and takes it upon himself to do chores around house including the entire Diwali decorations.\n\n4. Sacrifice & Support Are The Key\n\nWhile Amitabh is a doting and loyal husband to his wife, Jaya gave up her career to build a family with him soon after marriage.\n\nThey had two kids Shweta and Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya made sure she looked after them. However, when she decided to enter politics in the 2000s, Amitabh was supportive of her decision.\n\n5. Keep That Spark Alive\n\nEven after 48 years of marriage, they look like a young couple much in love.\n\nBig B often flaunts his love for Jaya through his sweet birthday posts and random photos on social media and shares cute stories about their love story from back in the day.\n\nIt’s clear how much he adores and respects the love of his life."
