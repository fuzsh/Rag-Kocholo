        "text": "In a heated confrontation, actor-politician Jaya Bachchan and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar clashed in Parliament. Bachchan criticized the Vice President for his \"unacceptable\" tone and asked for an apology, leading to protests from Opposition members. The situation intensified when Dhankhar responded, emphasizing the importance of decorum, regardless of Bachchan's celebrity status.\n\nDuring the Parliamentary session, Jaya Bachchan, a renowned actor married to Amitabh Bachchan, was introduced twice as 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.' The veteran actress voiced her strong objection to the practice.\n\nThe Chairman introduced Jaya Bachchan in the House as 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan,' prompting the Samajwadi Party MP to express her disapproval. In response, Dhankhar remarked, \"Don't school me.\"\n\nBachchan, though, stood firm and demanded an apology. \"I need an apology from the Chair,\" she said as protests mounted against Dhankhar and the opposition MPs walked out.\n\nDhankhar remarked that Jaya Bachchan had earned a great reputation, acknowledging that an actor is often directed by others. He suggested that she might not be aware of the perspective from his position. He added that regardless of one's status or celebrity, it is essential to maintain decorum.\n\nCheck out the video here:\n\nAfter the walk-out, Jaya Bachchan told reporters that she found the experience to be humiliating.

She emphasized that the MPs are not school children, with some even being senior citizens. Bachchan was particularly upset by the Chair's tone, especially when the Leader of the Opposition, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, attempted to speak and had his microphone switched off.\n\nShe firmly expressed her concern about the language used in Parliament, noting that terms like \"nuisance\" and phrases such as \"you may be a celebrity, but I don't care\" were being used. She clarified that she wasn't seeking special treatment, but emphasized that the current tone in Parliament was unprecedented and disrespectful, particularly towards women.\n\nOpposition MPs - led by Sonia Gandhi and the Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien - gathered outside Parliament, flanking Bachchan in a significant statement, and several later spoke on her behalf.\n\nAdvertisement"
