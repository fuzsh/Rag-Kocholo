        "text": "In recent times, actress and MP Jaya Bachchan grabbed headlines after she objected to being referred to as âJaya Amitabh Bachchanâ in the Rajya Sabha. Amid this, an old video of Aishwarya Rai has surfaced on social media, where she reacted to being referred to as ‘Rai Bachchan’ after her marriage with Abhishek.\n\nThe video begins with a journalist introducing the actress and using ‘Rai Bachchan’ as her surname. Aishwarya reacts to it and says, âOhooâ¦that title isâ¦my god! Just regular Aishwarya, the way you have known meâ. When questioned if Rai Bachchan is her official surname, she replied, âAishwarya Rai as it has been professionally known, who got married to Abhishek Bachchan. So, obviously, Aishwarya Bachchan. Make want you want to make out of it.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbhishek and AishwaryaÂ have been garnering headlines since their separate arrivals at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchantâs star-studded wedding. While the rumours of their separation escalated further when Junior Bachchan liked a post on Instagram, which talked about divorce.\n\nThe post liked by Abhishek Bachchan was shared by author Heena Khandelwal, it featured an image of broken hearts and wrote, âWhen love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?â\n\nâDivorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesnât dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesnât unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things? What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, âgrey divorcesâ or âsilver splittersââterms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50âare on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising,â the post read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs per Redditors, Junior Bachchan liked the post since it has inputs from Dr Zirak Marker, who is a close friend of Aishwarya Rai."
