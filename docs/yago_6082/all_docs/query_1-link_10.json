        "text": "Originally posted by: MrMadonnaCicone\n\nAmitabh and Jaya have been married since 1973, an incredibly 42 years. It is admirable they have stayed together this long especially since the infamous Rekha affair. And I am sure Amitabh has been accused of being with other women (Parveen Babi, etc.). Jaya maintained her dignity and stayed with Amitabh for her children. I am sure she loved him, but this has to be a marriage of convenience. Jaya has benefitted from the Bachchan name and vice versa. Anyway, has this relationship always been a marriage of convenience, not love? Please share your thoughts. ðŸ˜Š\n\nOriginally posted by: Echofades\n\nI honestly fell bad for her. Amitabh is a jerk. Rekha sindoor is still a mystery to me since media are saying she is married to him in her own fantasy world.\n\nOriginally posted by: SalmanKiBiwi\n\nTbh I know a lot of people make fun of Jaya but I feel bad for her. It must suck having such a tharki and disgusting husband like Amitabh."
