        "text": "Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha were seen together in films like Do Anjaane, Imaan Dharam, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Mr. Natwarlal, and Silsila. The actress even dubbed for two leading ladies of Bachchan’s 1999 film Sooryavansham. Bachchan and Rekha were rumoured to be in a relationship after starring in a string of films together. It’s rumoured Jaya Bachchan once called the diva home and refused to leave her husband at any cost.\n\nWhile reports of their romantic affair grabbed many headlines in 70s and 80s, in one of the controversial interviews with Stardust in 1978, Rekha spoke about Jaya Bachchanâs reaction to her and Amitabh Bachchanâs love scenes inÂ Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, which Prakash Mehra directed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nâOnce, I was looking at the whole (Bachchan) family through the projection room when they came to see the trial show ofÂ Muqaddar Ka Sikandar . Jaya was sitting in the front row and he (Amitabh) and his parents were in the row behind her. They couldnât see her as clearly as I could. And during our love scenes, I could see tears pouring down her face,â she had reportedly said.'\n\nInterestingly, Jaya Bachchan replaced Parveen Babi in Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha starrerÂ Â Silsila. Talking to ANI, Ranjeet revealed, âShe (Parveen Babi) was my dear friendâ¦ she was all alone. She was a beautiful lady. Always smiling and we used to call her âfawadaâ because of her teethâ¦ Once she was very upset and she was crying. I asked her âKya hua Parveen? (What happened Parveen?)â We were in Kashmir. I donât mind quoting because itâs a fact. A film was made, Silsila, and Parveen Babi was the original heroine but she was asked to leave. And because of a gimmick controversy, they cast Rekha and Jaya Bhaduri in the film otherwise it was Parveen and Rekha.â"
