        "text": "Jaya Bachchan (née Bhaduri; born 9 April 1948) is an Indian actress and politician. She has served as a member of parliament in the Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party. Known for her work in Hindi films, she is noted for reinforcing a natural style of acting in both mainstream and \"middle-of-the-road\" cinema. A recipient of several accolades, she has won a record nine Filmfare Awards and the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour awarded by the Government of India.\n\nBachchan made her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar (1963), followed by her first screen role as an adult in the drama Guddi (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, in their first of several collaborations. She was noted for her performances in films like Uphaar (1971), Koshish (1972) and Kora Kagaz (1974). She starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in several films, including Zanjeer (1973), Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975), Mili (1975) and the cult film Sholay (1975), which saw her playing the much-lauded role of a young widow. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Abhimaan, Kora Kagaz and Nauker (1979).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of their children, she restricted her work in films, notably starring in Yash Chopra's musical romantic drama Silsila (1981). After a 17-year sabbatical, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's independent drama Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998). Bachchan won three Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress for playing emotionally-troubled mothers in the commercially successful dramas Fiza (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003). After another hiatus, she made her comeback with Karan Johar's romantic comedy family-drama Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (2023), which earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nEarly life\n\nJaya Bhaduri was born in a Bengali family on 9 April 1948. She is the daughter of Tarun Kumar Bhaduri, a journalist, author, and poet and his wife, Indira. She studied at St Joseph's Convent School, Bhopal and graduated from Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.\n\nActing career\n\nBachchan first starred in Satyajit Ray's Bengali film, Mahanagar (1963) at the age of 15, with Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. She then appeared in two more Bengali films: a 13-minute short Suman, and the comedy Dhanyee Meye (1971), where she played the role of Uttam Kumar's sister-in-law.\n\nInspired by her experience with Ray, she joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune and graduated with a gold medal. Hrishikesh Mukherjee cast her in Guddi (1971), to play the eponymous role of a petite school-girl obsessed with film star Dharmendra. Guddi was a commercial success, and created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. While she did venture out to play glamorous roles as in Jawani Diwani, (1972) and a semi-negative character of an amnesia-faking heroine in Anamika (1973), she was most recognised for her roles epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and Mukherjee. These films include Uphaar (1971), Piya Ka Ghar (1972), Parichay (1972), Koshish (1972) and Bawarchi (1972). They also made her a superstar.\n\nIn Gulzar's Koshish, Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as disabled people. She described the film as \"a learning experience\" which motivated her to do social work in future.\n\nShe first acted with Amitabh Bachchan in Bansi Birju (1972), followed by B. R. Ishara's Ek Nazar also in the same year. When Amitabh had faced a string of flops and most lead heroines refused to work with him in the Salim–Javed scripted Zanjeer (1973), she agreed to step in. The film turned out to be a big hit creating Bachchan's angry-young-man image. All their successive films as a pair were huge hits - Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975), Mili (1975) and Sholay (1975).\n\nHer daughter Shweta was born around the time Jaya and Amitabh were working on Sholay. Following this, she retired from films and focused on raising her children, making an exception for Yash Chopra's Silsila (1981), once again opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for Shahenshah (1988), which starred her husband in the lead.\n\nComeback and intermittent work (1998–present)\n\nAfter a gap of 17 years, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998), a film about the Naxalite movement. Her performance in the film earned critical acclaim, and earned her a second Filmfare Special Award.\n\nIn 2000, she starred alongside Karisma Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan in the crime drama Fiza as a mother longing for her son's return who goes missing during the 1993 Bombay riots. The film received critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise directed towards Bachchan's performance. Sanjeev Bariana of The Tribune opined that \"Bachchan delivers a commendable performance, displaying mixed emotions through trying times delicately.\", while Screen film critic Chaya Unnikrishnan noted that \"Bachchan looks every bit a Muslim woman and etches out her character superbly.\" Moreover, it emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, grossing ₹322 million (US$7.17 million) worldwide. Fiza earned Bachchan her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nShe then starred in Karan Johar's ensemble family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) with her husband and in Nikhil Advani's romantic comedy drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), playing Preity Zinta's mother, Jennifer Kapur, both of which also earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She starred with her son Abhishek in Laaga Chunari Mein Daag (2007) and Drona (2008).\n\nIn 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film Meherjaan starring Victor Banerjee and Humayun Faridi. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. In 2023, she starred alongside Dharmendra and Shabana Azmi in Karan Johar's romantic comedy family drama Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted, \"Bachchan is electrifying. Her commanding presence, authoritative attitude and cold stares — this is a stand-out act that’s sure to be talked about by moviegoers.\" Her performance in the film earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSee also: Bachchan family\n\nJaya married actor Amitabh Bachchan, on 3 June 1973. The couple has two children: Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, who is also an actor. Shweta is married to industrialist Nikhil Nanda, grandson of Raj Kapoor, and has two children, Navya Naveli and Agastya Nanda, while Abhishek is married to actress and Miss World 1994 Aishwarya Rai with whom he has a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan.\n\nPolitical career\n\nBachchan was first elected in 2004 as the Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party, representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha till March 2006. She was disqualifed in 2006 for holding an office of profit. Subsequently, she got a second term from June 2006 till July 2010 and in February 2010 she stated her intent to complete her term. She was re-elected in 2012 for the third term and again in 2018 for her fourth term in the Rajya Sabha from Samajwadi Party. Also, she campaigned for All India Trinamool Congress during 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.\n\nParliamentary Committee assignments\n\n13 September 2021 onwards: Member, Committee on External Affairs\n\nPositions held\n\nJaya Bachchan has been elected 5 times as Rajya Sabha MP.\n\nAs per the Election affidavit of 2018 (Rajya Sabha), Jaya Bachchan has assets worth ₹1,001.63 crores and liabilities worth ₹105.64 crores.\n\nList of political positions held # From To Position Party 1. 2004 2006 MP (1st term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh (by-poll) SP 2. 2006 2012 MP (2nd term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 3. 2012 2018 MP (3rd term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 4. 2018 2024 MP (4th term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP 5. 2024 Present MP (5th term) in Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh SP\n\nArtistry and legacy\n\nBachchan is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema.
