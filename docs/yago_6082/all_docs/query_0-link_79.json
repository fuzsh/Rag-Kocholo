        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai considered one of the loved couples, have garnered headlines since their separate arrival at the Radhika Merchant-Anant Ambani wedding. While their divorce rumours have been in the news for quite some time, a throwback appearance of Jaya Bachchan on Koffee With Karan has resurfaced where she revealed how Amitabh Bachchan could never see the Guzaarish actress as his daughter in law.\n\nBachchan said, âWhenever he sees her, he becomes happy. He never saw Aishwarya as a daughter-in-law. He always saw Aishwarya as a daughter. Amitji, the minute he sees her, it’s like he’s looking at Shweta coming home. His eyes light up. She’ll fill the vacuum that Shweta left.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother throwback interview has surfaced on the internet, where the Ghoomer actor has spoken about the first meeting with his wife.\n\nâMy dear friend Bobby Deol was shooting his first film, Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya. I was at the same location, I went to say a hi to him when he said, âoh come for dinner.â That was Aishwaryaâs first Hindi film and thatâs the first time I ever interacted with her,â said Abhishek while talking in The Ranveer Show in 2021.\n\nHe added, âWhenever she talks about it, she jokingly says, âI couldnât understand a word of what you were sayingâ. Because here I was, this kid from an international boarding school, then went to Boston. I mustâve had some really heavy accent at that point. And she was like, âWhat were you saying?ââ\n\nâMy formative years, my training in acting and in the world of cinema and stage, my boarding school days was in English,â the actor revealed.\n\nThe Yuva star recently grabbed the headlines when he liked a post on Instagram about divorce. Shared by author Heena Khandelwal, it featured an image of broken hearts and written, âWhen love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?â"
