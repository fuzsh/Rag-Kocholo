        "text": "Amitabh Jaya Bachchan Wedding Anniversary: As the star couple celebrates their wedding anniversary this year Amitabh Bachchan shared an unseen photo of him and his wife on their wedding day on his blog. The actor also thanked everyone who wished them on their 48th wedding anniversary.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOn their 48th wedding anniversary, Amitabh Bachchan shared a picture from their wedding and wrote a message for his fans on his blog. The 78-year-old actor thanked everyone who wished him and his wife. ‘Your wishes and your gracious words have been most moving and filled with love for us .. and we truly appreciate them .. For today and now.” he added.\n\nAmitabh Jaya Bachchan Wedding Anniversary: A look at Jaya And Amitabh Bachchan’s Story\n\nThe two actors were first introduced on the set of the 1971 film Guddi in which Amitabh Bachchan was reportedly cast as the lead although he was later replaced.\n\nAmitabh fell in love with Jaya (then Bhaduri) by looking at the cover of a magazine. He revealed that he always wanted a woman who had a perfect blend of modernity and traditionalism that Jaya Bhadhuri embodied.\n\nThe first film in which Amitabh and Jaya appeared together was Bansi Birju in 1972. The couple had a low-key affair after getting to know each other.\n\nThe couple got married on June 3, 1973, and left for London on the same day.\n\nDuring the shooting of Sholay, Jaya Bachchan was pregnant with their first child. The couple has two children, Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan Nanda.\n\nTogether, the couple has worked in several films including Zanjeer, Abhimaan, Mili, Chupke Chupke, Sholay, Silsila, and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. All the films turned out to be blockbusters.\n\nAfter having kids, Jaya Bachchan announced that she was going to leave showbiz. She later revealed that having a family and spending time with kids was more interesting instead of taking up the same offers in cinema.\n\nAfter Jaya left the industry, rumours started about Amitabh Bachchan's alleged affair with his co-star Rekha. But Jaya refuted the rumours by saying, “I totally trust my husband and I know this industry. I have never been threatened or felt insecure about anything he did.\"\n\nSince Amitabh performed his own stunts, he got injured while shooting Coolie in 1982. While shooting an intense fighting scene in Coolie, Amitabh was accidentally punched in the gut resulting in an internal abdominal injury.\n\nHe also misjudged a jump and landed wrong which severely injured him. Amitabh was in a critical condition and he was reportedly declared clinically dead a few minutes before he was put on a ventilator. The actor underwent several surgeries but recovered from it.\n\nThe actor tested positive for COVID-19 on July 11 last year. He was hospitalised along with his son Abhishek.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan received the Padma Vibhushan in 2015, the second-highest civilian award in the country.\n\nJaya Bachchan is a four-term member of parliament in Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party."
