        "text": "It’s true that the best thing to hold onto in life is each other and Bollywood’s iconic couple Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan have shown that time and again. Today, they are celebrating their 47 years of togetherness, which only reinstates our faith in love.\n\nAmitabh took to his Instagram account today and wrote, “47 years .. today .. June 3, 1973 .. !! Had decided if Zanjeer would succeed, we would along with a few friends go to London for the first time .. My Father asked who you going with ? When i told him who , he said you must marry her before you go .. else you don’t go .. So .. I obeyed .. !!” (sic)\n\nIt wouldn’t be wrong to say that they are the perfect example of love and relationship for the younger generation. They have come a long way and never fail to display major relationship goals. Their evergreen love story has set new parameters of love, trust, understanding and respect over the years and it only continues to inspire people.\n\nAs B-town’s iconic couple celebrate their wedding anniversary today, let’s take a look at their classic tale of love which makes them the poster couple for the evergreen love story.\n\nJab they met\n\nAt a time, when Amitabh was finding his feet in the industry and Jaya Bachchan (then Bhaduri) was already a superstar, they both met for the first time at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune in 1970. Even though it wasn’t a love at first sight, Big B did manage to leave a lasting impression on Jaya. Later, when Amitabh noticed Jaya on one of the magazine covers, he instantly fell for her charming looks and simplicity.\n\nLove blossomed on the sets of Guddi\n\nGuddi played a cupid in their life. B-town’s favourite couple were officially introduced by filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherjee on the sets of their 1971 release Guddi. The iconic movie marked Big B and Jaya’s first collaboration and the couple was thrilled to share the screen space. Recalling the same, Jaya, once in an interview, had said, “I was introduced to him on the sets of Guddi. I was impressed by him and somewhat in awe as he was Harivanshrai Bachchan's son. I felt he was different, though people laughed at me when I said that. I expressed my feelings and said he's going to make it big, even though I was aware he wasn't the usual stereotype hero. I fell in love with him very soon.” Interestingly for Amitabh, he went gaga over the actress while shooting for their 1972 release Ek Nazar.\n\nRajesh Khanna’s disapproval of this relationship\n\nWell, what’s a love story without some thrill and drama in it? Amitabh and Jaya had collaborated again in 1973 release Zanjeer and while the movie turned out to be a blockbuster hit, the team decided to celebrate the success with a trip to London. However, the turning point in their lives came when Amitabh’s father told him he can’t go to London with Jaya unless they both tie the knot. Rest is history. Big B accepted his father’s proposal and married Jaya on June 3, 1973, and interestingly enough travelled to London together on the same day.\n\nOne Big Happy Family\n\nTime flew by and soon the iconic couple became proud parents to daughter Shweta Bachchan in March 1974 and three years later, Abhishek was born. The veteran couple is now grandparents to Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s daughter Aaradhya, and Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Nikhil Nanda’s kids Navya Naveli Nanda and Agstya Nanda."
