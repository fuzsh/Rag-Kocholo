        "text": "It was love at first sight for Jaya Bachchan who saw Amitabh Bachchan before he became a superstar. She fell for him while shooting for 'Ek Nazar' and they were introduced on the sets of 'Guddi'.\n\nRecalling about her first meet with Amitabh, Jaya had said, \"I was introduced to him on the sets of 'Guddi'. I was impressed by him and somewhat in awe as he was Harivanshrai Bachchan's son. I felt he was different, though people laughed at me when I said that. I expressed my feelings and said he's going to make it big, even though I was aware he wasn't the usual stereotype hero. I fell in love with him very soon.\"\n\nRecalling the whirlwind wedding with Jaya Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan wrote on his blog, \"I lived on the 7th Road of this society in a rented house. The marriage had been decided among us, nothing to be exaggerated or celebrated with any aplomb. Just the two families and done. Off to London, my first trip ever and hers too. Zanjeer a success and a promise that if it did well we would all - a gang of our friends - would go on a holiday to London!\"\n\nBig B added, \"Seeking or rather informing parents that we were a group of friends going to England, who all are going, came the query from Babuji, names disclosed, Jaya is also going with you. You both are alone. Yes. If you have to go marry and go. Ok. Pandit and family informed. Next day all set, flight at night, marriage to finish before the flight. I dress up in formal marriage Indian, get into my car and want to drive to Malabar Hill where her friends lived and where the ceremony was to be done .. my driver Nagesh, pushes me out and insist he would drive me to the wedding. The substitute for the traditional horse. Off I went, wedding over in a few hours. Done, Mr and Mrs proclaimed. over!\"\n\nAfter getting married, Jaya Bachchan worked for a few more years and then decided to quit films to look after her family. Talking about it, Amitabh Bachchan had earlier said, \"Every marriage is a challenge, and mine wasn't different. One thing I find very admirable about Jaya is that she chose to give preference to home, not films. There was no obstacle from me ever, it was her decision.\"\n\nDescribing his marital life with Jaya Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan had said, \"In any marriage, there are ups and downs and areas where disagreements take place but that’s all part of it. Jaya is extremely open and very straight. Sometimes embarrassingly straight but that’s how her nature is. I’ve never tried to disturb that quality of hers and she’s not disturbed my quality of being myself. When I want to be left alone, she leaves me alone.\""
