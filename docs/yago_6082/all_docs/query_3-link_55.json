        "text": "Farida Jalal Recalls Being The Third Wheel on Amitabh Bachchan-Jaya Bachchan’s Date: ‘They Used to Fight Over Silly Things’\n\nFarida Jalal revealed Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan used to tag her along on their dates before marriage, which she didn't like. Read her full statement.\n\nVeteran Bollywood actress Farida Jalal recently shared some heartwarming stories from the time when Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan were dating. She revealed that the couple often took her along on their coffee dates at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. During these dates, Farida witnessed both their sweet moments and their occasional playful arguments. “They would take me with them on their coffee dates at Taj. They were about to get married and were in their courtship period. They used to fight like any other couple,” Farida told Bollywood Bubble. She remembered sitting in the back seat while Amitabh drove the car and Jaya sat beside him.\n\nFarida admitted she wasn’t always happy about being the third wheel. “I would tell them, ‘Why do you guys always bring me along as the third wheel?’ I used to complain because they spoiled my sleep as I was an early-to-bed girl,” she said.\n\nThe actress, now 75, recalled how Jaya would often get upset with Amitabh, and he would spend time trying to cheer her up. “She would get upset, and he would pacify her. I was there witnessing it all and enjoying it because I am very fond of Jaya, whom I call Jiya. Our friendship is quite old. They would have coffee or tea at Taj and return around 11 pm, discussing their film ‘Abhimaan’ and saying, ‘We will create magic with this,'” Farida added.\n\nFarida, who worked with Amitabh in ‘Majboor,’ mentioned that the couple would argue over trivial issues. “They would fight over silly things, which I can’t reveal. Jaya would easily get upset,” she said.\n\nFarida Jalal was one of the few industry people invited to Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan’s wedding in 1973. She shared that only she, lyricist Gulzar, and actor Asrani attended the ceremony."
