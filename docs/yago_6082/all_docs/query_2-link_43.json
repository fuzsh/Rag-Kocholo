        "text": "Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan recently turned 81. The actor, whose brilliant career spans several decades and boasts uncountable hits, has recently revealed that his worst critic isn't some harsh journalist. As per the star, his worst critic is his wife of 50 years, Jaya Bachchan.\n\nAmitabh recently sat down with famous film critic, Komal Nahta, who hosted an interview with the magnum star on his show, Starry Nights. When the actor asked who was his worst critic at home, the megastar quickly replied, Jaya.\n\n\"She will see a film (and say) ‘What is this kind of film that you are doing?’ And there have been times in the past when she has walked out of one my trials (auditions) and there has been some kind of domestic problem when I get home,\" Amitabh commented.\n\n''Jaya is incredibly instinctive. She will meet a person for the first time and come and tell me ‘I like this guy, he’ll make a good film’. I say but he hasn’t started it even. (She says) ‘No, but I just feel that he is going to make a good film’. Her instinct when she chose me was absolutely right,\" he went on.\n\nThe couple, who found love on sets of the 1971 film Guddi, tied the knot on June 3, 1979. While the couple has been together for over half a century, their marriage wasn't without turbulence. At 81, the Deewaar star admits that he reaches straight home from work as he’s scared of his loving wife. Amitabh commented, \"She's strict and lenient too. I'm saved. I have to go home. I don't want to be thrashed. So, when she's strict it's better if you stay in. It scares me so I don't talk much about my personal life.\"\n\nThe couple has two children, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan, both of whom have made their mark in various fields, from business to acting. Abhishek is married to former Miss World and Bollywood icon, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya's on-screen chemistry was evident in films such as Abhimaan, where they played a troubled married couple. Their real-life relationship brought authenticity to their performances, making them one of the most beloved on-screen pairs in Bollywood. Silsila was another film where their real-life and real-life romance intersected, making it a notable film in their careers.\n\nHave something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below."
