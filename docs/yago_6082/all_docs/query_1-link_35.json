        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJaya Bachchan amused the Rajya Sabha when addressed as 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan,' sparking laughter and discussion about women's identities. Her lighthearted exchange with Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar captivated attention. Not new to making headlines, Jaya continues to be a notable figure on and off-screen.\n\nBollywood icon and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan is no stranger to making headlines, but this time, it's all about her name. Recently, she found herself in the spotlight for her spirited reaction in Rajya Sabha when addressed as \"Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.\" The veteran actress, known for her no-nonsense demeanor, added a touch of humor to the parliamentary proceedings that had everyone in splits.\n\nIt all began when Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar called out Jawhar Sircar to speak. Amid a lighter moment, Jaya Bachchan inquired if Dhankhar had managed to get a lunch break, playfully interjecting with, “Did you get a lunch break today?”\n\nThe response was golden. With the House already chuckling, Dhankhar urged her to pause and put on her headphones, quipping, “Let me be serious at your lighter note.”\n\nThen came the kicker. Jaya Bachchan introduced herself with a laugh, saying, “Sir, main Jaya Amitabh Bachchan apse puchti hun ... (Sir, I Jaya Amitabh Bachchan would like to ask you),” sending the entire House, including Dhankhar, into a bout of laughter. Still giggling, she repeated her question about the lunch break. Dhankhar admitted he hadn't had lunch, prompting Jaya to joke, “Tabhi aap baar baar Jairam ji ka naam le rahe hain (That’s why you keep calling Jairam ji’s name repeatedly).”\n\nDhankhar, playing along, confessed he had lunch later with Jairam ji, adding, “And let me tell the distinguished honorable member, this is probably the first chance... I am your fan, as well as Amitabh ji's fan.” Jaya’s response? Folded hands and a heartfelt, “Why first chance?”\n\nDhankhar wrapped it up nicely, “Aisa koi couple mujhe mila nahi aur (I have never met any other couple like this),” to which Jaya retorted, “Tabhi mera aise ... got it (That’s why my name is like this),” thanking him for the explanation before the session resumed.\n\nBut this wasn't Jaya's first rodeo with name games in Parliament. Just a few days earlier, she had firmly objected to being called “Jaya Amitabh Bachchan” by the Deputy Chairman, insisting that “Jaya Bachchan” would suffice. She expressed her frustration over women being identified by their husbands' names, highlighting the importance of their own identities and achievements.\n\nIn her illustrious career, Jaya Bachchan has never shied away from speaking her mind, whether on screen or in the halls of power. Her recent performance in Karan Johar's Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani earned rave reviews, reminding everyone of her unparalleled talent.\n\nJaya Bachchan married megastar Amitabh Bachchan on June 3, 1973. The couple has two children, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan. The couple has acted in several films together, including 'Zanjeer', 'Sholay', 'Abhimaan', 'Mili', 'Chupke Chupke', 'Silsila', and 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'.\n\nAs for her name? Whether it’s Jaya Bachchan or Jaya Amitabh Bachchan, one thing’s for sure – this legendary actress and fierce parliamentarian knows how to make some noise.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nMpox virus is back.
