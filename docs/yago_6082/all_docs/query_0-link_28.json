        "meta_description": "In a vintage interview, Jaya Bachchan opened up about her emotions and addressed the persistent rumors swirling around her husband, Amitabh Bachchan's alleged involvement with Rekha during the late '70s. It's widely reported that these rumors took a toll on Jaya Bachchan, leading to a strained period in their marriage. There were even claims that Jaya had purportedly prohibited Amitabh from collaborating with Rekha, possibly in response to the turmoil caused by the speculations. During her interview with People's Magazine, Jaya Bachchan candidly confronted the affair rumors involving Amitabh Bachchan. She remarked, \"If there was any, he would have been somewhere else, na? People liked them as a couple on-screen, and that's fine. The media tried linking him with every one of his heroines. My life would have been hell if I had taken it all seriously. We are made of sterner stuff.\" Despite Jaya ji's assertions, the persistent gossip surrounding Amitabh and Rekha's alleged romantic entanglement continues unabated.",
