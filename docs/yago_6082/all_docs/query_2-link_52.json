        "text": "Actress-tuned-politician Jaya Bachchan enjoys a love-and-hate relationship with the paparazzi. While our shutterbugs follow her all the time, she has been seen scolding them and asking them to respect her privacy. Over the years, the Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani actress has had several encounters with paparazzi. From giving death stare looks to screaming at them, she has done it all. Here’s a compilation of some of Jaya Bachchan’s moments with camerapersons which went viral on social media:\n\nWhen Jaya Bachchan Gave a Death Stare To Paparazzi:\n\nDuring the Lok Sabah elections in Mumbai earlier this year, Jaya Bachchan stepped out with her actor-husband, Amitabh Bachchan, to cast her vote. However, the veteran actress got angry after she was surrounded by paparazzi outside the polling station. In the video that surfaced online, Jaya Bachchan was seen giving a death stare to shutterbugs as she walked towards her car.\n\nWhen Jaya Bachchan Told Paparazzi, ‘Chillao Mat’:\n\nIn December 2023, Jaya Bachchan attended the screening of her grandson, Agastya Nanda’s debut film The Archies. She was joined by her family – Amitabh, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, Aaradhya Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan and Navya Naveli Nanda – at the red carpet. However, the actress lost her cool when the paparazzi called out the Bachchan family members’ names to get their attention. “Chillao mat (don’t shout),” she said. Amitabh also reacted to her scolding by asking the paparazzi, “Sunn liya?”\n\nWhen Jaya Bachchan Got Irritated With Paparazzi:\n\nAt Aamir Khan’s daughter Ira’s wedding reception in Mumbai earlier this year, Jaya Bachchan arrived with her daughter Shweta Bachchan. However, when the photographers requested her to pose at a specific spot on the red carpet, the veteran actress got irked and firmly told them not to give her directions. Not just this, but when Shweta attempted to pose with her and Sonali Bendre, Jaya walked off.\n\nWhen Jaya Bachchan Asked Paparazzi, ‘Don’t You Understand English?’\n\nIn January 2023, Jaya Bachchan was snapped by the paparazzi at the Mumbai airport when she asked camerapersons not to take her photos. “Please don’t take my pictures. You don’t understand English?” she said. When the paparazzi did not obey her, Jaya lost her cool and said, “Aise logo ko naukri se nikal dena chahiye (You must fire such people from their jobs).”\n\nWhen Jaya Bachchan Yelled at Paps For Asking About Aishwarya Rai:\n\nWhile most of the time the reason for Jaya Bachchan losing her temper at the paparazzi is due to the invasion of her privacy, once it was because they quizzed her about her daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai. Back in 2013, Jaya was attending Subhash Ghai’s wife’s birthday party when she was asked about Aishwarya. The actress lashed out at the paparazzi and asked, “Kya Aishwarya Aishwarya bula rahe ho; tumhari class mein padhti thi kya (Why are you calling her Aishwarya? Was she your classmate?)”\n\nWhy Jaya Bachchan Does Not Like Paparazzi Following Her?\n\nIn one of the previous episodes of What The Hell Navya, Jaya talked about the paparazzi culture and said she “hates it and despises the people who interfere in your personal life”.\n\n“I hate it. I despise it. I despise the people who interfere in your personal life and fill their stomachs by selling those products. I hate it, I’m disgusted with such people. I always tell them, I say, ‘Aapko sharam nahi aati hai (Don’t you feel ashamed?)’,” Jaya said.\n\n“I feel very strongly and it’s not that it’s today, I felt it from day one. I don’t mind if you talk about my work. You say, ‘She’s a bad actor and she has done this film badly, she’s not looking nice’, because it’s visual media, don’t mind. But the rest I do mind,” the actress added."
