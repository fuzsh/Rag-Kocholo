        "text": "New Delhi: Amitabh Bachchan's granddaughter, Navya Naveli Nanda, has concluded the second season of her podcast, 'What The Hell Navya.' In the final episode, Jaya Bachchan called Amitabh Bachchan her ‘best friend.’ The podcast, which features candid discussions on various topics including relationships, love, and friendship, involves Navya, her mother Shweta Bachchan, and her grandmother Jaya Bachchan.\n\nJaya Bachchan calls her husband Amitabh Bachchan her best friend\n\nIn the latest teaser for the finale episode, the trio delves into the theme of friendship intertwined with romance. Navya raises a thought-provoking question, asking, \"If two people are just friends, is it correct to put romance in between a friendship?\" Jaya responds by sharing her perspective, revealing that her closest friends are within her own household, with her husband being her best friend. She said, “My closest friends are inside my house. It’s true, my husband is my best friend. I don’t hide anything from him.” Navya Navya responds with affection, expressing an 'aww' at her grandmother's sentiment.\n\nNavya then said, “When Nani’s friends come over, they get to talk to her in a certain way that we can’t talk to her in. And, I find it so funny because they tick her off in certain things.”\n\nAdding her insights, Shweta questions the notion of labeling one's children as best friends, asserting that there are certain boundaries that exist between parent and child. She said, “I don’t know why everyone likes to say, ‘my daughter is my best friend’ or ‘my son is my best friend’.” Jaya then asked, “Why can’t your children be your friends?” Shweta said, “We are not friends. You are my mother, there are certain lines that I cannot cross with you. My children are my children and my friends are my friends.”\n\nNavya interjects, suggesting that as both Shweta and Jaya are now parents themselves, they can be friends.\n\nNavya on calling Aishwarya Rai for her podcast\n\nIn a conversation with Zoom, Navya was asked about calling Aishwarya Rai Bachchan on her podcast, to which she replied, \"I think, hopefully, we have a season 3. I would love to call others guests from outside the family. I think that would be a lot of fun, we would get to learn so much from them and their experiences. People from maybe different fields; I would love to have maybe a scientist on the show and talk about what science means to them today, what new inventions we have. I would love to get people from different fields and get their perspective, I think that would be really knowledgeable for all three of us – my mom, nani and I – for us to be in conversation with someone who is from a completely different field to ours.\"\n\nWhat The Hell Navya season two is streaming on YouTube."
