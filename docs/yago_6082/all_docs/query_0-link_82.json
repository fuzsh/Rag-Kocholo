        "text": "New Delhi: On Monday, the Rajya Sabha had some light-hearted moments when Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan asked Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar about the meaning of the middle name in her official title, “Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.” She then humorously suggested that Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is unmarried, add \"the name of his wife\" to his name.\n\nJaya Bachchan on being addressed by husband Amitabh's name\n\nThis banter stemmed from Jaya Bachchan's comments on July 29, where she objected to Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh addressing her by her official name, arguing that \"this something new that women will be recognised by the name of their husbands.\"\n\nDuring Monday’s session, Chairman Dhankhar requested Jaya Bachchan to ask her supplementary question during question hour from Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, addressing her by her official name. She responded by asking, \"Sir, aapko Amitabh ka matlab pata hai na (Sir, do you know the meaning of Amitabh)?\" Dhankhar explained the procedure for changing a name officially and offered assistance if she wished to do so.\n\n'I am very proud of my name...'\n\nHowever, Jaya Bachchan expressed pride in her name and her husband's accomplishments, saying, \"No sir, I am very proud of my name and my husband and his achievements. It signifies abha, jo mit nahi sakti (the shine that cannot be wiped away).\"\n\nDhankhar shared an anecdote about seeing Amitabh Bachchan's photograph among global icons at a hotel in France, affirming the nation's pride in him. When Jaya Bachchan suggested that Khattar should add his wife's name to his, Dhankhar humorously noted he sometimes refers to himself as \"Sudeshpati,\" after his wife Sudesh. Khattar, referencing his unmarried status, quipped that fulfilling her suggestion would have to wait until the next life.\n\nAmid the smiles, Dhankhar commented that Khattar had put himself in the ambit of parliamentary tradition for his next life, drawing laughter from the members. Khattar then proceeded to answer Jaya Bachchan’s supplementary question.\n\nJaya Bachchan's reaction\n\nOn July 29, Jaya Bachchan had taken exception to being addressed as Jaya Amitabh Bachchan, emphasizing that women should not be solely recognized by their husbands' names as if they have no independent achievements.\n\nAbout Jaya Bachchan\n\nJaya Bachchan, married to megastar Amitabh Bachchan since June 3, 1973, is an influential figure in both cinema and politics. The couple has two children, Shweta and Abhishek Bachchan, and have acted together in several films such as 'Zanjeer', 'Sholay', 'Abhimaan', 'Mili', 'Chupke Chupke', 'Silsila', and 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'. Since her political career began in 2004, she has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and various social issues."
