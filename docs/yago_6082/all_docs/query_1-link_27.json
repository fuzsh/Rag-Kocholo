        "text": "Amitabh and Jaya will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary next year as they tied the knot on June 3, 1973\n\nVeteran actor Jaya Bachchan, recently during a podcast, revealed the conditions that Amitabh put forward to marry her. She said he did not want a wife who will be 9 to 5.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking with her granddaughter on the podcast 'What the hell Navya,' the 'Sholay' actor said, \"we have decided to get married in October because by then my work would have reduced. At that time, he (Big B) said, I definitely don't want a wife who will be 9 to 5. Please work and you must work but not every day. He also asked her to choose projects and work with the right people.\"\n\nThe actor also shared why they got married in June and not in October.\n\nThe power couple decided to go on a holiday after the success of their movie 'Zanjeer'. But Big B's parents said if they want to go on a trip together, they must get married. So they preponed their date from October to June.\n\nThe marriage took place at Jaya's Godmother's house in Mumbai.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary next year as they tied the knot on June 3, 1973.\n\nJaya also talked about the topic 'Modern Love: Romance and Regrets' on the podcast along with her elder daughter Shweta Bachchan.\n\nDuring the conversation, Jaya revealed that she doesn't have any problem if her granddaughter Navya Nanda has a child without marriage.\n\nJaya said that the couple decided to get married in October because by then Jaya would have finished with her work commitments. She further goes on to say that Mr. Bachchan had told her that he doesn't want a wife who will be 9 to 5. The Uunchai actor also asked Jaya to work but not every day. And also select projects and work with the right people. It is worth mentioning here that their marriage took place at Jaya's Godmother's house in Mumbai.\n\n\"During our time we couldn't experiment and a relationship can't last on love, fresh air and adjustment.\"\n\nJaya said, \"People will find it objectionable coming from me but physical attraction and compatibility are also very important. In our times we couldn't experiment but today the generation does and why shouldn't they? Because that also is responsible for a long-lasting relationship. If there isn't a physical relationship it's not going to last very long. You can't be lasting on love and fresh air and adjustment, I feel. It's very very important.\"\n\nAlso Read: 'It is completely unfiltered': Navya Naveli Nanda discusses her new podcast with Shweta Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan\n\n\"Sometimes it's a pity but a lot of the younger lot, of course, we never could, we couldn't even think about it but the younger generation even after me, Shweta's generation, Navya's is a different ballgame, but they would feel guilty going through that experience and I think it's very wrong. It's okay and then you do things on the sly. If you had a physical relationship and you feel that still, my relationship otherwise not worked out you can be nice about it,\" the veteran actor added.\n\nGiving advice to the younger generation, the 'Silsila' actor said, \"I'm looking at it very clinically. Since there's a lack of that emotion, the romance today...I think you should marry your best friend. You should have a good friend, you should discuss and say, 'Maybe I'd like to have a child with you because I like you, I think you're nice, so let's get married because that's what society's saying'. I have no problem if you have a child without a marriage also, I really don't have a problem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the film front, Jaya will be next seen in director Karan Johar's upcoming film 'Rocky aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani' alongside Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Shabana Azmi and Dharmendra in the lead roles.\n\nThis story has been sourced from a third party syndicated feed, agencies.
