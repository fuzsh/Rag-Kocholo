        "text": "New Delhi:\n\nAmitabh Bachchan recently revealed one of the many reasons he married his wife and actor Jaya Bachchan. The actor, in the latest promo of his quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati, confessed that he liked Jaya Bachchan's long hair and also praised his contestant's beautiful hair. The promo started with Amitabh Bachchan saying, \"Priyanka ji Jitne bhi humarein contestants aatein hai unse hum puchte hai ki aajkal ap kya kar rahe hai (Priyanka, we ask all our contestants about what they have been doing lately).\" To which, Priyanka replied, \"Mai beauty and wellness ki ek academy mein manager ki job karti hu (I work as a manager in a beauty and wellness brand.)\" Amitabh then said, \"Devi ji apke jo kesh hai woh bahaut sundar hai (Ma'am, you have beautiful hair.)\" Priyanka replied, \"Thank you sir.\" Amitabh Bachchan then jokingly revealed that he married Jaya Bachchan because she had long hair. He said, \"Apni patni se humne vyah ek iss wajah se kiya tha ki unke kesh bahaut lambe the (One of the reasons I married my wife Jaya Bachchan is because she had long hair.)\" Priyanka and the audience laugh at this revelation.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan continued the conversation and asked another personal question to his contestant Priyanka. He said, \"Priyanka ji ek aur vyaktigat prashna hai, yeh baaya hath upar karengi. (Priyanka, I have another personal question for you, can you please lift your left hand.)\" Hinting towards her tattoo, Amitabh asks, \"Sabse pehle toh yeh bataiye ki kya darsha rahe hai yeh (Firstly please tell me what does your tattoo mean.)\"\n\nPriyanka replied, \"Sir yeh ek jo hai phoenix bird hai, iski khaasiyat yeh hai jab iski umra puri hojati hai toh yeh jal jata hai aur phir usi aag mein se wapas ek aur phoenix bird jo hai woh janam leta hai, toh yeh mujhe motivation deta hai bahaut (Sir, this is a phoenix bird. Its USP is that after it completes its life cycle, it burns into ashes and then a new Phoenix bird takes birth out of it. So this motivates me.)\"\n\nAmitabh Bachchan, who was curious about her other tattoo on her right hand, questioned, \"Yeh dusra kya hai (What is this?)\"\n\nPriyanka replied, \"Sir yeh arm band hai aur ispar R ap dekh sakte hai, ispar R likha hua hai, actual mein husband ko kuch personalised gift dena chahti thi mai, jab dikhaya toh mujhe inhone kaha 'ugh tumne tattoo banwaya hai' toh maine kaha theek hai mere papa ka naam R se shuru hota hai toh yeh unke liye hai. Toh yeh sirf ek din ke liye inke liye tha ab yeh mere papa ke liye hai (Sir, this is an arm band with an R on it. I wanted to give a personalised gift to my husband, so I got this made, but his reaction was 'Ugh you got a tattoo made' so it was for him for a day, now it's for my father, whose name too starts with the letter R.)\"\n\nListening to Priyanka's stories, Amitabh Bachchan made another revelation, where he shared the reason behind growing the nail of his little finger. He said, \"Priyanka ji yeh jo meri choti ungli hai iske naakhun ko lamba rakhte hai hum (Priydanka, I keep my little finger's nails longer.)\"\n\nPriyanka asked, \"Sir, iska purpose (Sir, what's its purpose.)\" Amitabh Bachchan says, \"Purpose yeh hai ki... (The purpose is to...),\" he pauses to laugh and then adds, \"Kaan khujlaane mein (to scratch my ear),\" and everyone in the audience including Priyanka and Amitabh Bachchan burst into laughter.\n\nCheck out the promo video here:\n\nAmitabh Bachchan has been the host of the quiz show KBC for over a decade."
