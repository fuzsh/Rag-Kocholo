        "text": "Effect\n\nWe have talked to eleven people about Tat Ming—eleven people who work, like Tat Ming, in music creation, or who do cultural work, such as radio programmes, cultural events, and creative writing. They have similar and different experiences when they mention Tat Ming’s influence, with similar and different intensity—some claim a more opaque, circuitous, messy affinity, while some say very specifically, explicitly, and emphatically how Tat Ming has left a mark on them. Gaybird and Jason agree: “Tat Ming is in our blood.” In this section, we will first discuss Tat Ming’s legacy in terms of effect, of how Tat Ming as music makers have effected—entailed, enabled, brought about—cultural productions in music and wider cultural scenes. We borrow—perhaps more accurately, paraphrase—the nomenclature from cultural heritage discussion to frame our analysis, into tangible and intangible effect, essentially to distinguish between the more concrete and the more abstract.\n\nTangibly\n\nThe most palpable of which is the role Tat Ming plays in the very burgeoning of an interest, a passion, and a dedication to a career in music. Gaybird embodies this form of musical influence the most dramatically. Referring to his enrolment in the music department of the Academy of Performing Arts, in Hong Kong, he says: “It’s because of Tat Ming that I wanted to study music.” Gaybird recalls watching Tat Ming perform in a television show, in the 1980s, when Hong Kong popular music was churning up a wave of band sound. “It’s probably their first TV appearance, and I saw Tats play out everything a band did, just with his keyboard. It’s simply amazing!” He told himself one day he would become like Tats. That’s how he started learning electronic keyboard himself, then composing and music theories, finally to the Academy of Performing Arts. It is therefore as anticipated as it is miraculous that the debut album of his band Multiplex was produced by Tats, introduced to him by someone who knew both, alluding again to the importance of the personal in cultural work (Konrad 2013).\n\nThere are a few other less dramatic cases, but equally effectual in launching them into a music career. Jason, like Gaybird, was invited to join Tat Ming shows, and later People Mountain People Sea.Jason was already preparing for this rather radical step of leaving his lawyer job to practice music on a full-time basis. At the time when Anthony was setting up the production house, Jason believed he had saved enough money. “It was timing,” so he quit. Serrini, before she was known as Serrini, participated in the first summer camp, in 2013, organised by Renaissance Foundation Hong Kong, an NGO co-founded by Anthony in nurturing new generations of creative talents. The same year she joined a trip RFHK organised and performed in Yunnan, mainland China. During her earlier musical life, Serrini continued to join music events hosted by RFHK. Serrini received the Renaissance Award in 2018 and joined a mainland China tour in 2019 sponsored by RFHK.Footnote 6 Eman’s music career commenced when she formed the duo at17 with Ellen Loo, she at the age of eighteen, and Ellen fourteen. They were signed by People Mountain People Sea in 2002. “Anthony was there very early, on the signing day. He wanted to get to know us, and he chatted with us, telling us what music release means, and about our aspirations for a music career,” Eman recalls. Her first commissioning as a composer was through Anthony, when he asked her to write a song for a theatre project. “Ok, I will give it a try,” thus marked a significant milestone in Eman’s musical life.\n\nAnother tangible effect Tat Ming has is their own music; we are referring to two specific manners. On the one hand, quite a few of the music practitioners have covered Tat Ming songs, in that sense a clear continuation and consolidation of Tat Ming’s musical legacy. Number 6 mentions a performance of his RubberBand at an official Handover show in 2013. While the show was supposed to celebrate the return of Hong Kong from colonial rule to Beijing, they sang “Don’t Ask the Sky 天問,” a Tat Ming classic that, as cited earlier in this book, was released in 1990 as a critical response to what happened in Tiananmen the year before. In addition to such individual projects of Tat Ming covers, some of them have taken part in the two compilation albums with covers contributed by various musical units as a tribute to Tat Ming. On the other hand, there have been new creations directly inspired by Tat Ming’s earlier numbers. Number 6 quotes a RubberBand song titled “Black Chicken 黑雞,” intended as a musical and lyrical response to Tat Ming’s hit “The Ten Young Firemen 十個救火的少年,”Footnote 7 also released in 1990. In the latter song, the ten kids disappear one after the other while the fire is raging on, alluding to the dire political situation and the urgent need for perseverance. In the RubberBand recreation, the “chicken” is the local slang term for whistle, and a football game is evoked to articulate social injustice when the footballers disappear one by one from the field.\n\nCrossing the borders to mainland China, Funkie and Passer-by supplement our research, noting that many of the mainland music makers listen fervently to Tat Ming and would draw reference from their music. They cite a few well-known Chinese bands, mainly the generation right after Tat Ming. As for themselves, they are inspired in their own ways to partake in the world of music production. Passer-by has created his own music label and has organised throughout the years events connected with Tat Ming. Funkie, as DJ and radio host, plays their music as much as he can in such public spaces as party venues and online shows. “I will also mash up and mix their music with others, and upload covers of their songs to online platforms,” adds Funkie. Like Passer-by, he does what he can hoping more people will be able to listen to Tat Ming’s music, albeit in recent years his podcasts have been facing increasing surveillance and censorship. Referring to his experience as part of the Hong Kong diaspora, Atom has been publishing creative writing inspired by Tat Ming. Atom has also published flash fiction pieces and other poems, as well as curated an exhibition in Toronto, inspired by individual Tat Ming songs. At the point of our writing, he is about to complete a collection of prose poems, in English, mobilising as their starting point the song “Don’t Wait 別等”Footnote 8 he saw Tat Ming perform in the 2021 REPLAY concerts. “The sheer beats and momentum … the words and imagery of the song.” To Atom, “Tat Ming provides the imagery that fuels my creative output.”\n\nIntangibly\n\nSometimes, the music practitioners who talked to us draw a specific, tangible link from their own creation to Tat Ming’s songs, like RubberBand’s cover of “Don't Ask the Sky” and their original number titled “Black Chicken.” More often, they attribute their music indirectly to Tat Ming, nodding to what we call Tat Ming’s intangible effect. We are referring to the effect Tat Ming has on the yardstick these later generations of music makers employ to evaluate their own music: Tat Ming’s impact on what counts as good pop. They mention a host of qualities—innovative (Jason: “The sound of the songs must excite the audience, must be provoking their usual way of hearing”; Gaybird: “It's like it didn't exist in the world, and then all of a sudden, it’s there, for instance, their Chinese version of electronic music”), aesthetics (Passer-by: “The way they bring the old and the new, the Chinese and the West together … and the literariness of their lyrics”; Ah P: “I listened to quite a few bands and singers when I was young, and they were all influenced by the aesthetics of Tat Ming, rather dark”), showmanship (Serrini: “I won’t usually loop their music, but I will always watch their live shows”); Eman: “I am always amazed, how can someone become such a totally different person on stage?”). There should be a research project on Tat Ming’s music, as suggested by Eman, to give full recognition to their musical trajectory, achievement, and contribution. We agree; however, given our lack of music or musicology training, and the general thrust of this book, we must confine ourselves to the above sketchy remarks regarding Tat Ming’s musical impact. Instead, we turn to other parameters, than the strictly technical and musical, that the eleven people also mention when they talk about the musical influence of Tat Ming. In fact, these parameters are what they elaborate the most, and the most passionately: popular music has to be relevant and urgent, subtle and nuanced, honest, and alternative.\n\nLet us begin with a song written by Jan Curious released under his band R.O.O.T.: “Sixty Seconds in Africa 非洲的60秒.” After stressing Tat Ming’s and Anthony’s impact, especially after his collaboration as backing vocalist at the Tat Ming concerts, Jan Curious cites this song to illustrate the connection. Unlike RubberBand’s “Black Chicken,” this song does not claim to be a continuation of any specific Tat Ming song. In Jan Curious’ own explication, “Hong Kong is small, and densely populated. Farms are very small too. You will find chickens being crammed to such an extent that they can’t even move. It’s like they can’t even have the fantasy of flying.” Jan Curious extrapolates the Hong Kong spatial politics to that of a different locality, the African continent, with the well-nigh cliché imaginary of vastness, and spatial possibility. “Probably the song is saying even in Africa, chickens want to fly, and they can try, and they won’t give up trying.” In the end “Sixty Seconds in Africa” is about freedom, the insistence on as well as the persistence of imagining freedom.\n\nWhich guides us to the first term often cited during our interviews: relevant. In Jan Curious’ sharp formulation: “We have a lot of musical products in Hong Kong, but what Tat Ming has done is art, it’s relevant.” All of the eleven people we talked with foreground this particular quality of Tat Ming’s songs; they refer primarily to the lyrical contents, but also to their concert renditions, occasionally in connection with musical arrangements. Many of Tat Ming’s hits are retrieved in their articulation of what matters in pop, such as their earlier songs about being young in the fast-changing, consumerist, and nihilistic society; about the shock of 1989 and the anxiety of pre-Handover Hong Kong; about choices to leave or stay; about gender and sexual equality; about life itself. Ah P calls it “a Tat Ming way of making music,” always combining something apparently private with societal issues. In their earlier years of making music, Tat Ming was releasing songs with a “concern about our future,” which, to Ah P, remains as relevant as ever. “They really use their heart in connecting with what is happening,” thus summarises Number 6 Tat Ming’s social, political, and humanitarian relevance. Such relevance is, however, always already intertwined with a sense of urgency in the post-National Security Law Hong Kong. As Gaybird reflects, as creator, as artist, one has to deal with issues that matter, that concern life and living, “but that may get you imprisoned.” They feel, at the same time, a stronger sense of vying for time, for what they cherish, and believe to be a better city, a better life. Tat Ming’s music is, in that sense, not only influential for its relevance, but for the urgent mission of, in both Jan Curious’ and Number 6’s words: “against forgetting.”\n\nReverting to the song “Sixty Seconds in Africa,” Jan Curious points to another feature of Tat Ming’s songs: nuance and subtlety. That the song is written in the form of a political parable, a twisted fairy tale, a piece of text open to multiple readings, is paradigmatic of the aesthetics of Tat Ming’s own creations, both their lyrical contents and other manifestations. It has become Jan Curious’ own thinking of good music: “I never like making things very explicit.” Funkie is equally impressed by what he calls the “spatial affordance” of Tat Ming’s music, that their songs would always give him and other audiences space to think, to feel, to respond in their own ways. The preference for nuance and subtlety is, however, not only an aesthetic goal in itself; it may also be a tactic to survive political interference, in Tat Ming’s early days, and particularly now. Gaybird continues, after explicating the danger of creative work in contemporary Hong Kong, “So how to express yourself and don't get yourself into prison, that requires wisdom.” This wisdom, according to what the cultural intermediaries talk about Tat Ming, is writing in a more nuanced, more subtle way. “A circuitous route,” summarises Jan Curious. Which is perhaps not only the better, but also the richer route, for this conjuncture of Hong Kong. It is the politics and aesthetics of speaking the unspeakable. Serrini says: “If I don't spell things out clearly, they need to guess. The more they guess, they may get something. But then if I say it directly, they may become lazy, they don't think and they may get it wrong.” Believing in nuances and subtlety is also believing in the audience. Serrini has noted a sense of maturity among the audiences in Hong Kong—despite of and because of the challenging situation in the last years. “They are looking for deeper sentiments and reflections.” Jan Curious goes further and thanks the current political stringency. He comments, half sarcastically, half seriously, “Our creative space has become bigger, because the audience is getting smarter, they think more. We may get less physical space to present ourselves … but now people pay more attention.”\n\nIt is a long-term affair. That is how Jan Curious talks about his music, about Tat Ming’s music. In this temporal perspective, what matters is honesty, or the courage to speak honestly. When talking about “Sixty Seconds in Africa,” Jan Curious mentions the pleasure of writing nuances and subtlety in his song, and above all, his admiration of Tat Ming’s honesty. “They spoke a lot of truth in the 1980s and 1990s,” comments Jan Curious. “Even when you were born after that, or after the turn of the century, and when you realise there is not much honesty going on in the world, you will look for it.” That is why, according to him, younger generations of audience keep on listening to Tat Ming. Many of the interviewees place their honesty against a backdrop where the opposite may well be safer, or smarter. “Speaking up is extra important in a place like Hong Kong,” remarks Atom, when he observes mainstream artists usually do not have the courage to speak up, in a society that is biased for the status quo, for the established order. Relatedly, Ah P extends the parameter of honesty to a very concrete question he poses to himself before creating a new song: does the world need such a song? Ah P stresses that any music practitioner must have something that he truly wants to express. This something is, for almost all of the cultural intermediaries we talked with, the readiness to use music and other cultural productions to challenge mainstream ways of thinking and doing things, “something rebellious,” thus says Atom.\n\nWords like “honesty” and “authenticity” have a long and complicated history in popular music studies. In his earlier work on rock music from China, co-author Jeroen de Kloet goes at length to explain how different music scenes in Beijing use different tactics to create a genre-specific construction of authenticity (2010). This ranges from the boy-next-door aesthetics in folk music, to the spectacular exaggerations of masculine aesthetics in heavy metal. Such studies follow in the slipstream of a move towards poststructuralist theory, in which notions like honesty, authenticity, or alternative, are by default being placed between parentheses. The key question is not whether they are, but how they are constructed, with what kinds of effects, and what is being left out, or ignored, or excluded. In de Kloet's case study of rock music in Beijing, it was pop music from Hong Kong that served as an important constitutive outside that was looked down upon as too commercial and too slick.\n\nWe are living in different times now; as Bruno Latour already observed in 2004, the critical tools of deconstruction have somehow run out of steam, now that they have been appropriated by the far right (Latour 2004). It is predominantly from the far right that the “truth” of climate change is being questioned, just as the harm done by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas his solution to this problem is, unsurprisingly, a move towards his Actor Network Theory, and, thereby, a promotion of a paradigmatic shift from Foucault to Latour, we are less keen to position ourselves firmly in specific schools of thought. But we do acknowledge that to question and deconstruct the vocabulary used by our cultural intermediaries is not the way we want to go in this chapter. In other words, while we are aware that notions like honesty and authenticity are ideological constructs, we prefer to read them in this chapter, instead, as ideological anchor points through which the intermediaries make sense of their work as well as of their life. In a time and place when work and life has come under so much pressure, such as contemporary Hong Kong, to question the construction of, say, authenticity, or hope, seems like a much less urgent task than to look for the affordances of authenticity or hope. It is the latter we are interested in.\n\nAnother keyword, equally prone to deconstruction, they often use to describe Tat Ming’s music is alternative. The term is applied to the manner the duo has been making music, as much as to the attitude such music embodies. Gaybird epitomises Tat Ming’s music—how they present it, how they visualise it, how they stage it—with this sense of epiphany: “They tell me, the world is more than it is.” In almost identical wording, Chi Chung recalls his DJ years, still bewildered by the world view, the possibility to look at things with alternative perspectives that Tat Ming enabled. “You would start wondering why their music is arranged like this, how do they use their lyrics, why do they appear like that?” The concrete instances Jason gives to illustrate how Tat Ming offers alternatives include his own biography. He refers to Tat Ming’s invitation to him, an inexperienced musician, to collaborate, underlining their refusal to follow established industry practices. In Serrini’s words, “They never please.” Citing his mainland Chinese background, Funkie notes his conservative upbringing, both in terms of education and family. “We would start having more and more doubts about things, but we are not supposed to talk about it.” By bringing, for instance, homosexuality, Tiananmen, and the Handover into their music, Tat Ming, to Funkie and many other interviewees, holds up honesty as the fundamental alternative in the world, to the world, and from the world.\n\nAffect\n\nIf we take the people we interviewed—whether as music practitioners, radio DJs, writers, and other forms of cultural producers—first and foremost as audience, of Tat Ming in our case, then we are acknowledging and building on the line of audience studies that has long been taking affect seriously (see for instance Papacharissi 2014; Wahl-Jorgensen 2019). Put differently, we contend for the necessity to recuperate and include the personal, affective experiences of cultural intermediaries into any investigation of influence, impact, and legacy. It would be tempting, indeed, to focus on the strictly speaking musical, professional influences of Tat Ming as deserved by their musical and professional contribution. We have documented an abundance of evidence in the last section surrounding what they have effected. However, it will be inadequate, especially when we try to do justice to the interviews—they talk enthusiastically about Tat Ming’s music, but they talk even more poignantly, passionately, and personally about the way they experience them as persons. Their narratives could have resourced so much more, but we follow three protagonists: as good mentors, as good Hong Kongers, and as good human beings.\n\n1.\n\nGood Mentor\n\nSerrini mentions the first time she met Tats, at a music festival. She did one of the acts, and Tats was the guest performer. She took the occasion and gave him her CD. He returned the favour with his. “It’s heart-warming,” she says. This affective reference resonates in the interviews when they talk about Tat Ming; they are affected not only by the musical practices, but also, if not more so, by the various ways Tat Ming relate to them on a personal level—in this case, as mentors, as someone more senior in the profession, taking care of the younger ones, affectionately, and engagingly. When Serrini first met Anthony, at the summer camp organised by Renaissance Foundation, she witnessed how Anthony, “already a successful artist, dedicates himself to grooming the younger generation.” This pleasant surprise underlines hierarchical and generational distance as often experienced by more junior practitioners; it also betrays the fierce competition and the sense of precarity in the creative industries. Put bluntly, why should someone help you at all? To Serrini, these personal anecdotes, their readiness to teach the young people, evokes confidence in younger creators. It may not be the teaching itself, but the act thereof that touches her, and them. “We all need a nice uncle or auntie along the way,” says Serrini with a smile.\n\n“Uncle” is also the term of endearment used by Eman when she refers to Tat Ming’s long-term collaborators. It was Anthony who introduced this group of experienced practitioners to her, and to her they felt like family, a form of kinship. Passer-by describes Tat Ming as “my brothers and sisters who hold up a torch in front of me.” A mentor, an uncle, a family member, rather than a didactic teacher; a spring of care and attention, rather than a source of authority. So it works, affectively. Number 6 feels Anthony’s affection, when he received “Add oil!” messages from Anthony before his performance started. Jan Curious exudes a sense of admiration and gratitude when he recalls how Anthony would always tell him: “Let me know if I can be of help.” Expressing her resistance to a more authoritarian way of coaching—“I don't like someone holding my hand and teaching me how to write”—Eman recalls that she and her partner Ellen, of at17, would receive a pile of CDs from Anthony every two to three months; the playlists of which were compiled by him for the young duo to listen and get inspired. “This gesture left a big impact on me,” she says.\n\n2.\n\nGood Hong Konger\n\nWhat we are about to tease out from the interviews can be read in tandem with the intangible effect they have inherited from Tat Ming, the parameters to what constitutes good music, especially that of relevance, that good music must be relevant. Supplementing this musical side of legacy, the following analysis zooms in on the affective dimension. Placed under the specific circumstances that these cultural intermediaries are producing culture, they often accentuate the Hong Kongness of Tat Ming, as affective bonding, support, and empowerment. That Tat Ming continues to release songs and stage concerts relevant to the city and its politics, particularly in the post-National Security Law time, attests to their affinity with Hong Kong, their identifications, their sense of belonging and longing. Some of the people we talked to experience this continual engagement, warmly and movingly, as in the presence of some good Hong Kongers.\n\nWhat Tat Ming and their music mean to Number 6, if he must summarise, is this: don't forget which city you are from. Number 6 would hesitate to call his RubberBand a successor of Tat Ming, but the “sense of mission” transpired from their decades of work should continue to empower him not to leave Hong Kong behind. “To continue writing stories about the city is to continue breathing with the people here.” Jan Curious’ linguistic choice for his music underlines his earnestness to connect with Hong Kong, to stay relevant, just like Tat Ming. When he started, in 2005, creating music with the rock band Chochukmo, English was the medium, and the message was: English should continue to exist in Hong Kong. Later, in 2016, when Jan Curious began another band R.O.O.T., the songs became Cantonese, the native tongue of Hong Kong. “We have already lost the battle regarding English, now what I am trying my utmost is to protect Cantonese.”\n\nFor Atom, a diasporic Hong Konger: “Tat Ming reminds me of how lucky I am to have lived the Hong Kong 80s.” He was quick to distance himself from the trite simplification of the decade as the “Golden Era.” Tat Ming’s music embodies the “real” Hong Kong, and this sense of realness is cultivated by the feelings Tat Ming invest in their creative work, the feelings for the city, for the society, for the people living here. Tat Ming speaks to Hong Kong people, according to Atom. “Tat Ming’s music reminds me that there were lots of social issues that were not addressed by the mainstream artists of the day.” That is the reason why Atom was, and still is, deeply moved by the occasion when Tat Ming took a moment on the Christmas show of the 2021 REPLAY to acknowledge his work in 89. 09. 12. 21. “While on stage, Ming Gor [Anthony] said to me, ‘Thank you for loving Hong Kong.’” It was an utterance, a linguistic hug, by someone intimately bonded with the city, someone who has been singing the city’s destiny through the decades, by a good Hong Konger. “Hearing this ‘thank you’ made me feel that my efforts were validated – my efforts in cultivating this near-and-far relationship with Hong Kong by way of writing in an expat tongue,” says Atom.\n\nFor Funkie and Passer-by, Tat Ming is Hong Kong, and increasingly, the defiance of Hong Kong that defines the city. They speak in the context of Tat Ming, their favourite music makers, being banned in mainland China. Many of the interviewees partake in this chorus of defiance. Gaybird feels sorry for the mainland audience. Jason believes the ban speaks volumes about the impact of their music. Serrini recalls a remark by a mainland Chinese writer: don't call yourself a writer if you don't have at least a couple of works banned. Chi Chung is sure it will only make people more curious. The political cancellation of Tat Ming’s music in mainland China, according to Funkie, is in effect a “rite of coronation”; many of the younger generation of Tat Ming audiences in the mainland, those born after 1995 or 2000, started searching for their music only after it was banned. Another manifestation of such defiant attitude is not so much about the audience, but about the cultural intermediaries themselves.\n\n“Limitation is another creation,” is Gaybird’s motto, gesturing to Tat Ming’s decades of music making. For him and many others, they experience Hong Kong at a very difficult time of its history. What they have learned from Tat Ming is to turn all the limitation into sources of creative energy, not only in making music, but also in how to continue being able to make music. “We will find a solution when we see a problem,” thus characterises Gaybird a way of working and living in the city shared by many of other people we talked with. In any case, he cannot just lie down there and do nothing. They are worried, they may do adjustments, but they will continue, like good Hong Kongers. Referring to the Golden Era of the 1980s, which we discussed in Chapter 2, Jan Curious echoes Atom’s reflection and contextualises the dominance of love songs in Cantopop in the spectacular economic growth in Hong Kong. “What Tat Ming has been doing all the time is tell us: don't become a pig,” Jan Curious says. As a Hong Konger, Jan Curious’ aspiration is to write some songs, and survive this difficult time with his fellow Hong Kongers.\n\n3.\n\nGood People\n\nOne of the most powerful lessons Serrini has learned from Tat Ming is indeed the consistency, and their manner of surviving and thriving in both the music industry and the city itself. “They have been true to themselves, they are happy about it, and they have followers. They inspire me to try as well.” She calls Tats and Anthony a “beautiful team,” and their power “religious.” Jason also describes Tat Ming as a “religion,” while Atom’s word is “movement.” Whether as a religion or a movement, what the people we interviewed tell us about Tat Ming is fundamentally the story of staying human. Indeed, they often do so in connection with Tat Ming’s past, and Hong Kong’s present. In the current conjuncture, it is not only, or even no longer, about how to make music, but how to stay human. As expressed by Jason, what he takes from Tat Ming is their humanity, their awareness, and their preservation of certain values.\n\nIn almost identical wording, Jan Curious says: “This is more than music; this is a lifestyle, an attitude, a spirit.” Nodding towards Tat Ming’s decades-long musical career, Jan Curious asks a rhetorical question: “How many people have managed to stay faithful to their beliefs?” In particular, Anthony has become a role model for him, not merely as an artist, but more fundamentally, as a human being. At one point during the interview when the conversation hovers around Tat Ming’s music, Jan Curious narrates animatedly how he was touched when he saw Anthony cry: “He will let the world affect him, and he will cry for all its injustice.” After explaining in detail how his first album was heavily influenced by Tat Ming, Gaybird hastens to add that more often than not, the influence is less specific, more osmotic. “It is in your blood,” he says. So claims Jason. And Chi Chung shows similar respect for Tat Ming, especially when he has grown up to become a teacher, and a father. “Slowly and gradually, I realise that this duo, that featured prominently in the early part of my life, has supplied me so much blood and oxygen, enough for the rest of my life.” Nodding again to Tat Ming’s history, and their age, Atom admits the humanitarian impact they have on his life this way: “I believe they’re both in their 60 s. They’re my role models. They show me how to grow old with style and grace, while remaining on the human side of the fight against the system.”"
