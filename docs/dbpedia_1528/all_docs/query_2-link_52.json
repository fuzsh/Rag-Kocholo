        "text": "Agava manager brought a world of flavor\n\nBy the time restaurateur Asya Ollis settled in Ithaca in 2012, she had three lengthy trips to India to draw upon and many years of experience in restaurants, from simple to sophisticated.\n\nAlthough she had left behind her planned career in education, and her successes in the restaurant world of New York City, she knew what she wanted (job, home, Indian market), and the move to Ithaca could be the ticket.\n\nNow three years in, Asya is general manager for Agava Restaurant in Ithaca, and an acclaimed success attracting a mix of townies, tourists, students and Cornell University folks all week long.\n\nInspiration in Asia\n\nFollowing graduation from Oberlin College in Ohio, the Michigan native embarked on her professional career teaching viola in suburban Dallas. During a summer language immersion course and home-stay in Mexico, she was inspired by other travelers’ stories of Asia, and wanted to experience what they had experienced. After two successful years of teaching, she packed her life into a storage unit and cashed in frequent-flier miles to fly to Thailand.\n\nIn nine months, Asya traveled solo throughout seven countries in Asia. She was in her element traveling alone, happily exploring, open to meeting others, all driven by the desire to see and learn more.\n\nWhile Asya found her trip engaging, she stayed the longest in India, fascinated with the diversity of religions, languages, cultures and food.\n\n“I was fascinated by the food in India,” she said. “It was unlike any food I had ever had before. From the wildly flavorful Indian street snacks to the 3-foot-long dosas served all over South India, I was overwhelmed and in love.”\n\nBy the time Asya returned to the States, she knew more about herself. She had the confidence that she could trust her intuition and follow her passion.\n\nAsya moved to San Francisco to work with international students; she loved having a new city to explore.\n\n“San Francisco felt like the closest I could be to Asia while still in the U.S.,” she said. “It was exciting to have access to so many markets with all of the produce and ingredients I had come to know from traveling.”\n\nAfter two years in the Bay Area, however, Asya missed being on this side of the country, far from childhood friends and family, and had a calling to “move to New York City and work in restaurants.” Little did she know it was the first step in her culinary career.\n\nGrowth in the city\n\nAsya arrived in New York City eight days before Sept. 11, 2001. While the city reeled with shock at its tremendous loss, Asya took work in the first of many restaurants.\n\nFor the next seven years, Asya explored New York City as she worked her way up in the food service hierarchy, rubbed shoulders with celebrity diners, and sampled music, neighborhoods and street food. When celebrity chef Thomas Keller, of the famous French Laundry restaurant, opened Per Se, Asya learned firsthand what four-star service was all about.\n\n“It was exciting to see how regimented and well thought out even the smallest details were,” she said. “I learned a lot in this very polished formal setting, but I yearned for something else.”\n\nAsya also worked with cookbook author and entrepreneur Maya Kaimal, growing her specialty line of Indian cooking sauces. Asya’s hard work and dedication, including cooking demos throughout New York City markets and national trade shows, helped grow the business from its Brooklyn birth to nationwide distribution.\n\nIn house and on the street\n\nNow, as general manager for Agava Restaurant, Asya oversees the daily operations in the “front of the house.” Restaurateur Gregar Brous (of the award-winning Collegetown Bagels-Ithaca Bakery Empire) and Executive Chef Andre Jacquet created Agava to serve Southwestern-inspired cuisine in a relaxed yet sophisticated setting.\n\n“The restaurant industry is notorious for long hours and stress, but I love it,” Asya said. “It’s terrific working with Gregar and Andre, and carrying forth their vision. We have shared ideals of what a great restaurant can be, with emphasis on delicious food and fine service. I get a chance to interact with staff and with our guests, and bring that ideal to fruition.”\n\nAsya also carves out time for bringing South Indian cuisine and Indian street food to Ithaca.\n\n“Both styles of Indian food are underrepresented in the U.S.,” she said. “People especially love the street food Chaat, which are snacks of vivid, sweet, spicy, tangy flavors with crunchy bites, and dosas, a savory crepe made from fermented rice and lentils, filled with spiced potato and served with coconut chutney.\n\nSince arriving in Ithaca three years ago, Asya has managed to prepare and serve Indian street food whenever and wherever possible. Offering a “pop-up” dinner at Lot 10, catering a college reunion, hosting dinner parties — all to share her love of this cuisine and to entice new diners.\n\nAs her schedule allows, she sells at farmers’ markets under the name Sadya Snacks. Find Sadya Snacks on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and at sadyasouthindian.com.\n\nMarjorie Olds is an Ithaca resident."
