        "text": "ASY SAAVEDRA\n\nSwedish-American musician and composer Asy Saavedra is pleased to present her debut solo single \"Masterpiece\" and its accompanying video. The video, which was directed by Louise de Nexon features several looks from the fashion designer Sho Konishi. Asy says, \"I am a huge fan and have been obsessed with Sho's work for a while. We ended up using several pieces in the music video including the android look, which has been worn by Beyonce, Dove Cameron, etc. There was an amazing piece that Sho had designed for Paris Hilton but she never ended up wearing it, so I got to wear it in the video. Sho’s designs brought the music video to another level and it was amazing to be able to premiere some of their outfits.\"\n\nOn the song Asy adds:\n\n'Masterpiece' is about not being a masterpiece at all.\n\nAt the time of writing this song, I was going through a difficult phase, but every time I put on my headphones, and my producer hat, I felt like God. God energy emerges from the rubble of flaws, heartbreak and difficulty.\n\nPlay this song when you are face to face with your flaws or insecurities but choose to embrace them like a masterpiece. Choose god energy."
