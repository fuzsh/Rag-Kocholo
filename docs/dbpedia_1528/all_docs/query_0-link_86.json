The event is a foray into the neighborhood with stops at places of interest including Strawberry Fields in Central Park.\n\nTilted Axes perform exciting original compositions and a couple of unique arrangements of seasonal tunes, sonic structures comprised of burbling polyrhythms, and contemplative grooves for deep listeners. They will premiere a new piece, \"Strawberry Solstice\" and well as some surprises, it's a tilted tradition.\n\nTilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars is an ensemble created and led by composer Patrick Grant. The project takes on aspects of spectacle informed by the traditions of urban street bands, avant-garde theater, and ancient music. It takes music out into the world and seeks transformative situations meant to change the conversation.\n\nElectric Guitars: Gene Ardor, Jessica Dankowitz, Patrick Grant (director), John Halo, Liz Hogg, Howie Kenty, Diego Retana, Dmitri Shapira â Keytar: Dean OlsherÂ â Electric Bass: Jeremy Nesse, Kevin Pfeiffer, Sarah Metivier Schadt â Percussion: Vince Caiafa, Roxan Jurkevich â Choreography: Christopher Caines â Production Support: Alex Lahoski, Keith Steimel, Leslie Stevens â Media Producer: Jocelyn Gonzales\n\nTilted Axes is a project of Peppergreen Media and is powered by Vox Amplification courtesy of KORG USA.

Bravi tutti! Grazie! â PG\n\nDaniel Rothbart writes: \"I feel honored and delighted that âThe Canto of Ulysses (for Primo Levi),â a short film that I realized with Carlo Giuliano is an Official Selection of the Gulf of Naples Independent Film Festival in Naples, Italy! The 10th Edition of this festival will take place from June 11-14, 2024, at the Istituto Pontano (Palazzo Cariati). Thanks to Umberto Santacroce and Vittorio Adinolfi.\n\nThe film features a new Arabic translation of Danteâs âCanto of Ulyssesâ by Marwa Saabni and music by Patrick Grant. It was previously screened at the Pool of the Arches / Center for Contemporary Art Ramle CACR in Ramle, Israel, and at the Lambert Center for Art + Ideas, JCC Manhattan in New York City.\"\n\n***\n\nâThe Canto of Ulysses (for Primo Levi)â is a surreal, aqueous voyage that juxtaposes Carlo Giulianoâs reading of Canto 26 of Danteâs Inferno with imagery of Daniel Rothbartâs floating sculptural installations in New Yorkâs Hudson Valley.\n\nDanteâs Canto 26 recounts the story of Ulysses who, once returned to Ithaca, rallies his former shipmates for one last voyage to the end of the world. Within sight of his destination, Ulyssesâ ship is caught in a whirlpool and carried to the bottom of the sea. Thereafter, Ulysses inhabits the eighth circle of hell, where he is punished for deceiving Greeks with the Trojan Horse.\n\nJorge Luis Borges likens Ulysses to Dante himself, who pushes boundaries of the Italian language. âIf This Is a Man,â Primo Leviâs Auschwitz memoir, includes a chapter titled âThe Canto of Ulysses.â Levi recites the canto in his mind to keep hold of his sanity in the camp. Levi unsuccessfully tries to convey a sense of its meaning and poetry to Jean, a friend and fellow prisoner.\n\nhttps://www.gulfofnaplesfilmfestival.com/\n\n@gulfofnaplesfilmfestival1 @galerie.depardieu @cr10arts @cacr_ramla @ron__peled @marwasaabni @udiurm @mm_jccmanhattan @umbertosantacroce @vittorio.adinolfi.7 #danielrothbart #galeriedepardieu #carlogiuliano #marwasaabni #contemporaryart #francinehuntermcgivern #kineticsculpture #primolevi #ifthisisaman #cacr #ramle #sequestoeunuomo #auschwitz #dante #inferno #ulysses #cantodiulisse #ulisse #sculpturecinetique #sculturacinetica #naples #napoli #francinehuntermcgivern #contemporaryart #gulfofnaplesfilmfestival #gulfofnaplesindependentfilmfestival #poetryfilm\n\n27 APR 24\n\nTilted Axes to perform at the Lower East Side Festival of the Arts 5/26\n\n20 APR 24\n\nTilted Atmos performs for Car-Free Earth Day\n\nIt was fun watching the passerby moods change during our electric version of Satie's \"Vexations\" (heavily abridged) on 23rd St. & Broadway at high noon today.

Little children danced. â photo: Leslie Stevens\n\n19 APR 24\n\nRIP Sean Satin (1972-2024) It is with a heavy heart that we speak about the passing of our dear friend Sean. This was unexpected and has left the NYC music community in shock. Sean played a great number of shows with us since 2013. I will be putting together a Tilted photo montage of him performing with us soon. We have nothing but good memoriesÂ of him and his great musicianship. May he rest in peace.\n\n05 APR 24\n\nAnnouncing TILTED ATMOS: Ambient Music for Electric Guitars on 4/20\n\nWe are thrilled that climate action group 350NYC is partnering with us to support our Tilted Axes: TILTED ATMOS Car-Free Earth Day NYC performance presented by NYC DOT.\n\n21 MAR 24\n\nTilted Axes Selected As Public Realm Programming Partner 2024-2046\n\nWe're excited to announce that @tiltedaxes has been selected to join the @nyc_dot as a Public Realm Programming Partner for the 2024-2026 season!

The ensemble uses their traditional black and turquoise concert dress to define the liminal threshold of their imaginary proscenium in public spaces. In this work, the members will be taking this concept many steps further with changes of costume and color-coded accessories. Using the language of clothes combined with new music and movement, the group will create a narrative performance that communicates ideas of inclusion, and even exclusion, using the language of clothes.\n\nArt in Odd Places 2023: DRESS is curated by Gretchen Vitamvas with Curatorial Assistant: Tasha Douge.

A 1983 documentary about The Living is even titled, \"Signals Through the Flames,\" such is their association with the Artaud.\n\nÂ\n\nIn their early days, the LT's history is almost like a who's-who of Village artists and aesthetic innovators from the theater, art, musical, and progressive political worlds. In 1959, with the help of a producer in collaboration with John Cage and Merce Cunningham they were able to open the theater on 14th St. and 6th Ave. which was the Theatreâs home for five years. Cunningham had his dance studio on the top floor. The Living occupied floors two and three.\n\nÂ\n\nMany years after that I met Judith when I was in my 20s and was lucky to work alongside her, creating music for theater, off and on for the group, for over twenty years. This included performances in the USA and extensively throughout Europe. The modus operandi abroad was that we would perform whatever current production we were touring plus we'd give workshops and create activist street theater with the local population. NYC was no exception. Performative political protests were a part of city life when the LT was based here. Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars might not have ever come into being had I not had this experience in my formation.\n\nÂ\n\nIt is in that spirit, taking it to the streets, that we present our latest musical procession, as part of The Village Trip Festival opening on September 10th in Greenwich Village. For the event, we will premiere a new piece with that name: \"Signals Through the Flames.\"\n\nÂ\n\nThis performance is dedicated to all of the politically active artists and troupes that The Village has given birth to over the years, but especially to The Living Theatre. Our aim to bring positive attention to their work and legacy and to all of us who owe them a debt for initially breaking down The Fourth Wall.\n\nÂ\n\nTo read more about The Living Theatre and its connection to The Village go to: https://www.livingtheatre.org/detailed-history by Thomas S.

It was written for soloists, choir, strings and organ. While I'm not a traditionally religious person at all, I have retained this sense of ceremony in all my work every since. It seeks to find a place in the world. And there is always a feeling of a larger narrative. My work with the Tilted Axes mobile electric guitars project is another branch of this same aesthetic. Some times it asks: What is classical music? Is it an instrumentation or an intention? Is it as the venue it's performed in or can it be found anywhere? Is it solely a technique or is it what we find beyond it if we know where to look? And yet other times the music aims to say as little as possible. It only asks you to listen with prejudice. One thing I have found to be common to all things \"classical\", whether it's traditional or it's pushing the envelopes of genres: It seeks to elevate us all by pulling us into the present. Together. And if the composer is from Detroit, it's also not unusual if it has a mean groove.\n\nFinal Phase DMA Voting closes on March 6th at 11:59pm.\n\nwww.detroitmusicawards.net\n\n21 FEB 22\n\nTILTED AXES: REEL TO REAL â Meet the Musicians\n\nTop row: Patrick Grant, Jeremy Nesse, Surar Al-Gaylani, Noel Marie Rivard\n\n2nd row: Marco Delicato, Jeff Adams, Gael Grant, Dean Western\n\n3rd row: Bob Kaufman, Sean Biggs, Manny Falcon, Alex Lahoski\n\n4th row: Chris Simpson, Sarah Metivier Schadt, Rob Knevels, Mike Balavitch\n\nBottom row: Maggie McCabe, John Lovaas, Jocelyn Gonzales, Chris McGorey\n\n11 FEB 22\n\n2022 Detroit Music Awards â Two Phase Two Nominations\n\nOutstanding World Music Artist/Group â\n\nTilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars\n\nOutstanding Classical Composer â\n\nPatrick Grantwww.detroitmusicawards.net\n\n19 JAN 22\n\nTilted Axes: Reel To Real â March 19-22 â Application Now Open!\n\nLINK: https://forms.gle/7ZQhwFAB9Q6qjewk8\n\n12 JAN 22\n\nTilted Axes to Return to the Moon at The Henry Ford\n\nTilted Axes returns to The Henry Ford as an aligned performance with the exhibit APOLLO: When We Walked On The Moon presented in partnership with NASA. #moonwalk This appearance is made possible in part by the 60th Annual Ann Arbor Film Festival.\n\nMore details TBA\n\n01 JAN 22\n\nHAPPY\n\n31 DEC 21\n\nFundraiser Completion\n\nCOMPLETION: Thank you everyone for being a part of our 2021-2022 season.\n\nWe look forward to the new music and performances that await us in 2022!Â\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/TiltedAt10.\n\nHappy MMXXII!\n\nLove,Â #TiltedAxes\n\nTILTED@10 â Celebrating 10 Years ofÂ Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars\n\n23 DEC 21\n\nTILTED AXES: Standing Still â The Winter Solstice in Herald Square, Make Music New York 12/21\n\nMiracle on 34th Street\n\nPictures!

Tilted Axes Article in AM New York\n\nBy Bob Krasner â \"For some, the sight of a marching band of electric guitars was just another day in New York City, for others, itâs what makes the city special (you can add us to that group).\n\nComposer Patrick Grant took Tilted Axes, his core group of nine musicians â including himself â with their Vox amplifiers (a longtime sponsor) on a walking tour of the East Village, stopping to play in various spots but never stopping the music.\n\nThe music, all composed by Grant, consisted of some pieces that were played as composed and others that followed strict rhythmic or harmonic rules but gave the players leeway to improvise. Sponsored by Make Music New York and grants from the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and The New York State Council on the Arts, the group can expand to 20 playersâ¦\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\n21 SEP 21\n\nTilted Axes to Perform at HONK NYC 2021\n\nJUST ANNOUNCED: Tilted Axes will be one of the performing ensembles at the 15th Annual HONK NYC Festival!\n\nMore info at: https://www.honknyc.com/\n\n13 SEP 21\n\nTilted Axes Presents Fabrication, a New Performance Created for NYCâs Garment District\n\nTilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars will present a new performance procession entitled Fabrication in partnership with Theaterlab in NYCâs Garment District.

As part of our activities this year, we have resumed work on our âStoryscapesâ project for New York City for the 2021-2022 season. Here is a collection of writings I created for about the project during the past month.\n\nPart 1\n\nThrough community workshops, Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars turn the stories and histories of people inside of NYC neighborhoods into public performances that preserves them for the future as a shared legacy and point a way to a vision of a better city for all. âStoryscapesâ is a site-specific musical procession based on melodies and rhythms given to Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars by neighborhood residents in a workshop. They are the composers. These melodies etc. will reflect local places and events and will be developed into a free performance for the community. A workshop will be announced that is open to the public. The workshop can be held in a community center or a small rented space.\n\nTilted Axes is self-contained and requires no special equipment. The participants come with a story about a neighborhood location that they would like represented in sound. After listening and sound exercises to warm everybody up, Tilted Axes members will listen to each personâs story and ask them come up with a sound, a melody, or rhythm suggestive of that place: themes. Tilted Axes members will learn these themes and play them back. They will transcribe these themes on-the-spot for further work in the next session. In the next session Tilted Axes members develop these themes and put them together as a narrative. Selected participants (the âcomposersâ and others) will aide in the running of the session. They will do a test walkthrough, with guitars (amps off), and fine-tune the narrative and the movement. The next day will be a dress rehearsal and a performance of the resultant work throughout the neighborhood with a grand participatory finale.\n\nTilted Axes takes on aspects of spectacle informed by municipal band tradition, avant-garde theater, and world music. We take music out into the world and seek transformative projects meant to change community conversation. We are an apolitical organization, but it does support science, arts programs, and renewable energy whenever possible. We aim to present what is possible. As artists, we need to communicate more than what we stand against or why particular policies affect us negatively, because limiting our commentary to such reactions would confine the social imaginary to existing political frameworks and systems that we do not control. We have to show a vision of what is possible.\n\nWe should also present our vision of who we are, and show why that vision is a positive one. We can imagine and visualize a message thatâs not necessarily only about action but more about shifting narratives and imagery. Art is central to social and political change, not peripheral. In the small things, we see the large things. âStoryscapesâ is a natural extension of our community work. The best narratives will come from our audience. We have a history of telling stories well through music and spectacle and we aim to extend our group into the communities of NYC that would benefit most.\n\nCONTINUE READING PARTS 2 AND 3 ON THE MMIXDOWN\n\n21 JAN 21\n\nNo, thank YOU!\n\nA number of the new participants in our upcoming (and fully enrolled) Remote Recording Workshops said to me, \"Thank you for doing this!\" but I feel that these thanks are misplaced. The only thanks that should be given are to the supporters and producing partners of Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars that enable these courses to be given FREE of charge. The aim is to educate our artistic community so that more of us can create original audio of all kinds: music, spoken word, sound design, etc. and share it in new projects. It is for that that I am the one saying, \"No, thank YOU for support! None of this would be possible without the great community we foster together.\" - Patrick Grant\n\nTo find out more go to: https://bit.ly/3qFNMx7\n\n15 JAN 21\n\nFREE Remote Recording Workshops in February\n\nREMOTE RECORDING WORKSHOPS\n\nOpt. 1: Thursday nights, February 11, 18, 25 from 7:00pm to 8:30pm EST\n\nOpt. 2: Sunday afternoons, February 14, 21, 28 from 1:00pm to 2:30pm EST\n\nThese will be conducted over Zoom â Details TBA.\n\nTo apply please fill out the Google Form: https://tinyurl.com/y5f2alvg\n\nThese winter courses are for new participants who did not attend last Fallâs workshops.\n\nThese courses are free to accepted participants.

The courses are given by me, Patrick Grant, a composer, performer, music educator, and creator of Tilted Axes.\n\nRemote recording, online sessions, file sharing â while the things these terms describe are nothing new, there are many musicians and songwriters that donât understand them. Like many developments on the internet, there isnât a universal nomenclature, and terms are used loosely. Which is why we thought it was worth taking the time to offer some clarity, and shed light on the opportunities that are available to people involved in every level of the music production process.\n\nThis is a great time for music and a great time to make music together. Collaborating remotely is not going away, so best to learn and sharpen those skills and be heard in every way possible.\n\nThe course is designed for Mac and PC users, laptops or desktops. Sorry, no tablets or smart phones. You must have a working audio interface to participate. This should be set up and running before we begin. If you require help, you should ask for assistance, but thereâs plenty of resources out there for you.\n\nYou will need an audio interface.

We just want you to use something that will make recording fun for you.\n\nAbleton LIVE will be our default software. If you already use, or are more comfortable with something else, thatâs OK, but in these workshops we will begin with Ableton so we have a common reference and since it is common to both the Mac and PC platform. If you need a copy of Ableton, you can download and use a functioning trial version for 90 days at https://www.ableton.com/. The version that you will use depends on the computer you current own. If you cannot use Ableton, it is acceptable to use Garageband (sorry, Mac users only). We will also be using Audacity (which is free to download) in a few instances.\n\nWhile this is not an Ableton Live or garageband course, we will use this programs to varying degrees in the service of learning good recording technique, how to share files in a collaborative way, and how to use any kind of software as a generative musical composition tool no matter your level of previous experience.\n\nThe proposed course syllabus is:\n\nSession 1 â The Physics of Sound Pt. 1, checking your interface, setting levels, creating and using a template for Tilted Axes (and other projects), initial recording, multiple takes, bouncing out your audio, Assignment A.\n\nSession 2 â The Physics of Sound Pt. 2, microphone techniques, creating a multitrack recording, editing, panning, bouncing out your audio, Assignment B.\n\nSession 3 â Acoustics: The Behavior of Sound in a Room, FX = Frequency, Dynamics, and Time, Post-Production, extended editing techniques, bouncing out your audio, the completion of the course Assignment.\n\nSpace is limited so apply as soon as possible. I will be getting back to everybody to finalize your participant.\n\nAgain, to apply please fill out the Google Form: https://tinyurl.com/y5f2alvg\n\nLooking forward to making more music with friends old and new.\n\nThank you all,\n\nPatrick Grant &\n\nTilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars\n\n01 JAN 21\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR !!!\n\n31 DEC 20\n\nTilted Axes: 20/20 SOUNDSCAPE for Points of Seeing\n\nTilted Axes: 20/20 SOUNDSCAPE for Points of Seeing.

This allows Tilted Axes to bring live music to our audiences, instead of the other way around. Tilted Axes is also a continuing expression of Patrickâs life-long interest in science and technology.\n\nTilted Axesâ free public performances feature music composed by Patrick, with the guitarists using portable amplifiers strapped to their sides as they walk through the streets. The procession of musicians moves along pre-planned routes in select areas, usually in honor of an event, a landmark, or an organization unique to that community.\n\nTilted Axes has had multiple incarnations in the USA, Europe, and South America. The ensemble performs during the annual Make Music N"
