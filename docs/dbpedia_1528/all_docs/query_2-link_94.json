        "text": "Before recalibrating themselves as the stylish electronic pop act, Chaos Chaos, Seattle-born sisters, Chloe and Asya Saavedra spent nearly a decade operating as Smoosh, recording three albums, touring the country, playing Lollapalooza, and sharing stages with acts like Death Cab for Cutie, Cat Power, and Sleater Kinney, all while in their teens. The two sisters retired Smoosh after 2010’s Withershins, developing a sleeker, more synth-based sound, which they debuted on 2012’s S EP, their first release under their new name. Bright and melodic yet with a distinctive hard edge, Chaos Chaos still played on the shared vocals and multi-instrumental capabilities of the two sisters, updating their approach to better reflect their adult years. A second EP, Committed to the Crime, arrived in 2014. After their song, “Do You Feel It?” was used in the animated television show Rick and Morty, the Saavedras released another song for the show, “Terryfold” which reached Billboard’s Hot Rock Songs chart in 2017. A pair of lush singles, “Dripping with Fire” and “On Turning 23,” appeared later that year, followed in 2018 by the vibrant “Pink Politics.”\n\nIn 2020 the sisters took two years off to explore solo projects. Chloe joined Caroline Polachek and Eartheater as a touring drummer, and Asya released her original soundtrack for the virtual reality video game Trover Saves The Universe. At the start of 2024 Chaos Chaos reunited, with the release of two new singles, “Ethical Plum (with Bayli)” and “Control”, which highlight a fresh sound of a new album in the works."
