Who am I? I'm not even a single letter from the Biography, not even these photos.\n\nIn an instant in the vision I reflected myself in another Mirror where I realised that, by form, I am not. In that non-form I would stay. I wanna go Home.\n\nSome beautiful sadness moved into my heart tonight. . . I do not know how to explain it and what to call it. . . it's a \"beautiful sadness\". . . all mixed up. . . blue and hidden, floating. . . like on the canvas of Chagall. . .\n\nI look forward to meeting you, dear Melika, God willing. It's next Saturday.\n\nSalam and love to you\n\n(From Asya's mail to Melika, Friday, Jul 4 2014)\n\nYâ Rahîm / O Milostivi\n\n(From Asya's past)\n\nHedda Gabler:\n\nHenrik Ibsen's classic work about the early emancipation of women. It was a controversial play when first performed and the school's production treated it in the classic fashion complete with authentic period costumes and sets. Showing it as it was made the New Image College production memorable for the students and audience. Incorporating masks and music it was beautifully realized by director Asya Pavlovic.\n\nDirectors: Asya Pavlovic\n\nCast: New Image Students\n\nFollow me on Academia.edu"
