        "text": "Huseyngulu Malik oglu Rzayev (Huseyngulu Sarabski) (1879-1945) — Azerbaijani opera singer (lyric tenor), actor, director, pedagogue, theater figure.\n\nFrom childhood, he was distinguished by a great passion for music and a good voice.\n\nAs he wrote in his memoirs, \"During the Period of Muharram, he sings religious songs, also listens and studies mughams and songs at festivities, weddings and celebrations\". When he was 12 years old, he saw a theatrical performance for the first time: it was Mirza Fatali Akhundov's comedy \"Adventure-Vaziri-Khani-Lankaran\" performed by amateurs under the name \"Khan Sarabi\". Huseyngulu, whose real surname was Rzayev, later took the stage nickname Sarabski, which echoed this strong impression.\n\nHuseyngulu Sarabski came to the theater at a difficult time. He tried to withstand the criticism and sometimes threats of those who considered the theater a \"satanic act\" and acting a \"profession unsuitable for a man.\" Nariman Narimanov, Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev, Rahim bey Malikov, his colleagues Huseyn Arablinsky, Jahangir Zeynalov, and others played a great role in the arrival of Huseyngulu Sarabski to the theater, in his choice and development of acting. Huseyngulu, who first played the role of Rasul in Nariman Narimanov's play \"The Trouble of the Tounge (to get into trouble for talking too much)\" in 1902, later played several different roles in the plays of Mirza Fatali Akhundov, Najaf bey Vazirov, Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev. He performed not only in the national repertoire but also in the works of William Shakespeare, Heine, Schiller, Gogol, translated into Azerbaijani. The impressive mugam \"Hijaz\", which he performed as an Arab traveler in the play \"Almansur\" by Heinrich Heine, transported him to the new world of Azerbaijani culture - musical theater, opera. Sarabski attracted the attention of Uzeyir Hajibeyov, who was working on the first opera of Azerbaijan and the East at that time, \"Leyli and Majnun\". Uzeyir Hajibeyov, realizing the natural and lively potential of Huseyngulu Sarabski as an opera artist with an attractive voice and knowledge of mughams, invited him to play the lead role in his opera - the role of Majnun. This role brought Huseyngulu Sarabsky, in the true sense of the word, national love and fame. This role was, perhaps, a turning point in the attitude of those who consider acting a \"clownery\". As the actor himself wrote, \"those who pointed at him in time, looked at him with contempt, now called him Majnun, applauded and greeted him with respect.\" For more than 30 years on stage, he played this role 400 times, he becomes known as the irreplaceable Majnun of the Azerbaijani scene.\n\nHuseyngulu Sarabski in the history of national opera, in Uzeyir Hajibeyov's operas and operettas Karam (\"Asli and Karam\"), Sheikh Sanan (\"Sheikh Sanan\"), Shah Abbas (\"Shah Abbas and Khurshidbanu\"), Sohrab (\"Rustam and Sohrab\"), Sarvar (\"If Not That One, Then This One\"), Marjan bey (\"Husband and wife\"), Asgar (\"Arshin mal alan\"), Shah Ismail in \"Shah Ismayil\" by Muslim Magomayev, Ashig Garib in Zulfugar Hajibeyov's \"Ashig Garib\" wrote his name in history as the first performer of these roles.\n\nKhurshid Gajar (1894-1963) — opera singer, one of the first Azerbaijani women to receive vocal education outside Azerbaijan.\n\nHonored Art Worker of the Republic of Azerbaijan received his vocal education in 1915 at the Moscow Conservatory.

She played a role in recording mugams such as Duga, Rast, Segah-Zabul.\n\nShovkat Hasan gizi Mammadova (1897-1981) — The first professional Azerbaijani female singer (lyrical coloratura soprano), Azerbaijani opera singer, and teacher.\n\nSensing Shovkat's desire for music, her father sent her to Baku in 1910 with the help of millionaire HZ Tagiyev. In 1911, with the help of Zeynalabdin Tagiyev and his wife Sona, she entered a music school in Milan, Italy. However, in 1912, her aid was cut off and Mammadova had to return to Russia. She continues her education at the Tbilisi Music School. After graduating from a music school in Tbilisi (1910), in 1911 she left for Milan to continue her education, where she took lessons from the famous singer D'Ambrosio. In 1917-21 she studied at the Kyiv Conservatory, where she promoted Azerbaijani music in concerts with R.Glier. On her initiative, the Baku Theater Technical School was opened in 1923, and a music publishing house was established. She first performed on the stage of the Azerbaijan Opera and Ballet Theater in 1921 as Violetta (\"La Traviata\", J.Verdi), and was a soloist of the theater until 1948 (intermittently). On the Azerbaijani opera stage, she connected the best traditions of Russian and world vocal art with the features of national music.

But when we look at these films, we see that she is not only an opera singer but also a very talented film actress. Especially in the film \"Stepmother\", she played the role of Gamar aunt so naturally that no one else could play this character like her. Aunt Gamar is a negative character in the film. She completely rejects the fact that her son-in-law Arif will bring a new mother to Ismayil, and doubts that Dilara will be a good mother till the end of the film. She even used the words \"You will see! She will not be a mother to Ismail. Stranger woman can never be like his own mother and never will\" — the quote is engraved in the memories.\n\nRashid Majid oglu Behbudov (1915-1989) — singer.\n\nRashid, who had studied in the school choir since childhood, entered the railway technical school in 1933.

Of the 35 stage images created by M.

Hasanova began her stage career at the Azerbaijan Theater for Young Spectators (1936-1942). She was hired by the Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theater in 1942 on the advice and assistance of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. The next fate of a talented artist with a melodic voice is connected with the stage of the Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theater. Here she created bright, colorful images of women. Since 1980 she has been working as a theater teacher.\n\nIn her performance Asli, Khananda girl (\"Asli and Karam\", \"Koroglu\", U.Hajibeyov), Shahsanam (\"Ashig Garib\" Z.Hajibeyov), Mrs.Taravat (\"Bahadir and Sona\", S.Alasgarov), Anna (\"Bride's Rock\", Sh.

At the final concert at the Opera House, Shovkat Alakbarova sang \"Karabakh Tragedy\" and was in the top three along with Fatma Mehraliyeva and Gulaga Mammadov. This competition laid the foundation for Shovkat Alakbarova's entry into professional music. Folk songs, mugams, composer's songs performed by Shovkat Alakbarova, who started working as a soloist of the Philharmonic in 1945 become very popular in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe repertoire of Shovkat Alakbarova, who has successfully performed in many cities of the USSR, France, Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, India, Egypt, Algeria, Iran, Turkey, Poland, and other foreign countries included mughams such as Segah, Qatar, Shahnaz, songs by Azerbaijani composers and oriental songs.\n\nTukazban Maharram gizi Ismayilova (1923-2008) — Azerbaijani singer.\n\nIn 1939-1944 she studied at the Music College named after.

As Professor Maharram Gasimli rightly points out, Azafli is one of the artists who created real works of art in all forms of ashug poetry and duly continues the classical ashug traditions. \"Azafli dubeyti\" ( the name of the lyrical ashug melody), \"Azafli beautification\", \"Azafli art\", \"Azafli world\", \"Azafli geraylisi\" ( In Ashug poetry: an eight-syllable form of poetry consisting of four lines in each verse), \"Azafli anthem\", \"Mikayili\", \"Azafli mountains\", \"Azafli sea\", \"Mazahiri\", Saz tunes such as \"Azafli muhammasi\" ( the genre of folk poetry — poem), \"Shah Sarayi\" were memorized.\n\nIt was not accidental that Azafli was elected a member of the Presidium of the All-Union Music Society. This was an appreciation and respect for Azafli Mikayil's musical talent.

Azafli was repeatedly invited to Moscow and first took part in the festival in Moscow in 1954 and was awarded medals.\n\nAshug Mikail Azafli was against communism and expressed it in his poems. He was convicted in 1961 of theft and possession of a weapon in his home and sentenced to four years in prison. Prison life gave the artist as much experience as he could at a university. His poems describing his life in prison were memorized while he was still in prison.\n\nAlthough Azafli's poetry was widespread among the people, it didn't appear in the press until the mid-1980s. By this time, the foundations of the Soviet system had begun to crumble. Therefore, with the help of writer Nahid Hajiyev, who held a leading position on Azerbaijan Television in the 80s, an hour-long program dedicated to his work was aired with the participation of the ashug. The program was met with great interest. Later, \"Writer\" Publishing House published the artist's book \"Old Eagle\" (1987).
