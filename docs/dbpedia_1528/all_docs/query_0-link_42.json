        "text": "We are thrilled to celebrate Dylan Horne as one of North America‚Äôs Top 50 Economic Developers of 2024! Dylan, a Project Manager at the Metro Atlanta Chamber, enhances the economic vitality of his region through his leadership and dedication. Let‚Äôs meet Dylan! How has economic development changed since you entered the field? Availability of talent and hiring diverse talent have come to be at the forefront of key drivers for projects, as the adoption of remote work and the importance of workplace culture have prompted companies to reevaluate their talent attraction strategies. What shifts do you see in the profession over the next five years? I believe that industries such as CleanTech, AI, and Biotechnology will grow to dominate the industry over the next five years due to a combination of the effects of the pandemic, sustainability initiatives, and innovation in technology and automation. What is your favorite characteristic of your region? My favorite characteristic of my region is the team approach we take to economic development. Metro Atlanta and Georgia's continued success is the direct result of this collaborative spirit shared among all partners across the state as part of \"Team Georgia.\" What is a personal goal you‚Äôre excited to achieve? July. My personal goal is to train and to beat my race time from the previous year. I look forward to achieving this goal again this year. What led you to economic development? My family and I moved from Japan because of economic development, with the location of Suzuki Manufacturing in Rome. I am honored to now be able to sell my home state so that families like mine can find similar opportunities to live and work in Georgia. What is your favorite economic development memory? Winning the U.S. Soccer Federation Headquarters project has been my favorite economic development memory, as it is a prime example of how all our partners were unified across multiple years in presenting the region for a complex and impactful project. Ready to celebrate these #NATop50 awardees? Join us at ECONOMIX 2024, November 19-21, 2024, in Salt Lake City, Utah. https://lnkd.in/gPeSaaU6 #economicdevelopment #econdev #awards\n\nüá¨üáß London Day 2: #Throwback to yesterday evening. I often get asked ‚Äúhow do I break into tech?‚Äù or get the comment ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to work for a tech company but I have no tech experience‚Äù üí° As a board member for a number of female led organizations, and a woman in Enterprise Tech myself, I was thrilled to come across ‚ÄúSuper Women in Enterprise Tech‚Äù an event happening at the London Stock Exchange. 5 female founders presented very innovative companies and shared how they are making a difference for large enterprises and ultimately making a difference in the lives of people. üöÄ ‚ùóÔ∏è People. If your work and/or passion has an impact on people there‚Äôs opportunity for you in tech, and opportunities for you to play a role impacting people on a global scale üåç, including by working at small-mid market tech companies. Now I know that is a broad and vague statement, however, if you have experience speaking to people, selling to people, consulting with people, marketing to people, or leading people, there‚Äôs a breadth of non-technical roles in tech that are key functions to the business. Networking events are great for: ‚úÖ Meeting new people ‚úÖ Learning about the industry ‚úÖ Fostering and growing strategic partnerships ‚úÖ Personal development If you‚Äôre interested in tech, networking events are a great way to get exposed to all the incredible things happening in the space. More often than not, you‚Äôll find yourself making long lasting connections and friendships, and finding a sense of community and purpose. One thing is clear, whether you‚Äôre in üá®üá¶ or üá¨üáß there‚Äôs rooms being filled with innovators, investors, tech professionals and folks interested in tech actively looking to network! London Enterprise Tech Meetup #WomenInTech #Tech #London #Uk #Networking #Business #Entrepreneurship #Growth\n\nLooking back on our exciting journey to the U.S. this April, we‚Äôre filled with vivid memories and significant moments. Our trip to New York was not just a visit‚Äîit was a strategic effort driven by our mission at Tunga to connect African tech talent with global opportunities. Our CEO, Ernesto Spruyt, led us through a week filled with networking events, including the lively Tech and Startup Networking Mixer at Sour Mouse and engaging sessions at the New Jersey Innovation Institute and TechWalk Manhattan. Our move into the U.S. market was sparked by a simple, yet profound, realization: even without a direct focus, we had already gained ten clients from the U.S. This serendipitous success was a clear sign of the strong demand for specialized software solutions, prompting us to explore this vast market further. Ernesto's schedule, from the Business Networking Group Meeting to the Open Coffee Club Newark, didn't just help us forge new connections; it also allowed us to share our impactful tech story. The thrill of connecting with such a diverse group and discussing potential collaborations really drove home the success of our trip and laid the groundwork for our continued efforts to grow Tunga's presence in the U.S. While we didn't capture many moments on social media (we have a short clip for you belowüôÉ), the memories and outcomes from this trip are indelibly part of our journey. This visit to the U.S. was more than a string of meetings‚Äîit was a dynamic chapter in our ongoing narrative, highlighting the vital role of African tech talent on the international stage and reinforcing our commitment to creating meaningful, global opportunities. #Tunga #TechTalent #AfricanTech #Innovation #GlobalTech #Networking #ImpactSourcing #DiversityInTech\n\nA profound delight in my role with the Austin Technology Council is the conversations I get to have with a cross-section of people in our tech ecosystem. When I took this job, I didn‚Äôt realize it would mean being part of so many discussions with interesting people from startups to multinational tech companies in the region. This week marks two years since I joined ATC, and it‚Äôs been an incredible journey. Austin has experienced amazing growth over the 30 years I've lived here (July 25th will be 33 years since I became an Austinite). Despite our regional population tripling, Austin still has a unique soul. But we can't take that for granted, and we must avoid becoming divided and siloed like many big cities. In today's ATC newsletter, I shared my desire to hear more stories from people and companies impacting the world. Our community needs to share more of the wins that happen daily. At ATC, our role is to ensure the good things about \"Austin Tech\" are known and celebrated. If we only read the national press, we miss the real truth‚Äîthe NOW of Austin is a great place to live and work. Our city is vibrant and full of people creating technologies and building community. ATC is a grassroots organization, but I need to hear from more of YOU‚Äîthe grassroots of our tech scene. Please email me at Thom@AustinTechnologyCouncil.org and tell me about the tech companies and civic-minded leaders who are the heroes of tomorrow. ATC is a community organization first, and a membership organization second. I seek anyone and everyone in our region who should be celebrated in story‚Äîin the newsletter, on our website, in our social media, and on the podcast. THANK YOU to those who have shared their stories and supported my efforts over the last two years. I am seeking to meet unique tech leaders who care about Austin and want to work together for tomorrow. From big companies or small, locally grown or with an office here, I want to tell the stories that matter NOW and for tomorrow. Whom do you know that I should meet? Or is it you? #AustinTechnologyCouncil #Ausitn #CelebrateAustinTech #AustinTexas #community\n\nWahlheymat Talks is about human connections in many sense. We are still experimenting with the Talks recipe, led this time by Barbara Vid mixing chat in two, podium discussion, and an open networking round at the end. We are searching for honest thoughts about living together in Berlin, co-creating the city, and the new perspective that it can bring to the table - in an intimate, safe environment. On December 7th, our guest speaker was the always inspiring Annamaria Olsson at Tucholsky Buchhandlung with Iv√°n G√°bor and twenty super diverse Wahlheymat friends, who joined us despite busy Advent days, the weather, and sickness-wave üôè Our TOP 5 takeaways: SENSITIVITY - Coming to a new place to live wakes up our senses. You see, feel, and think differently. Your new perspective is a blessing for society as you approach challenges differently, leading to new solutions for social problems. EMPATHY - Actively listening to others can lead to understanding the thoughts, problems, and situations of people around you. Focusing on them helps you feel happier and find your ways of caring about others. SCALE - As larger impact as you want, as bigger a community you need to build. DISCRIMINATION - is part of our everyday lives, unnoticed by policymakers as well. It is much harder to get funding for female founders, whether it is a social purpose organization or a startup venture. FOLLOW THE ENERGY - Initiatives like Wahlheymat are very important because only well-functioning, diverse, and inclusive companies will make the German economy thrive.\n\nOne day in about 10 years, I'll look back at this and think, yes, we did it. When many are trying to find the next tech or climate solution, we started a business network... to house them both! A home to many types of established businesses with an optimistic outlook and great leaders. Where everyone would enjoy the same access and have the ability to connect with each other instantly. Led by a central team who would assist members, whilst creating content and experiences that would add value to their lives. It'd be launched by entrepreneurs who have legitimate business ownership experience and supported by boards who bring dynamic expertise to the table. If there's anything harder than starting an independently owned business network, where companies pay an accessible and fair fee on an annual basis, it's scaling a team to execute it all. For the first 9 months, myself and Nicola did everything. I was pregnant for most of that! Nicola was mainly looking after our other company Firecracker Events & Marketing. We took on our first hire Belinda Williams when there was enough in the pot to pay a membership manager. In 2021 we hit another wall (not a bad problem to have but internally, I was a panic mechanic). We needed internal human capital. I had a notion in my head that our next hire had to be an internationally acclaimed, senior executive type. I wrote panic mechanic emails to The Scottish Government and Scottish Development International asking for help. We were now becoming one of the 'go to' international businesses networks for companies from Africa, Scotland and now across EMEA. There was no going back but we weren't sure how to move forward. Hold on a minute. We have an unemployment epidemic in Africa and I've always believed in young people. After all, Africa is the world's youngest population and if this business is to be a legacy one, we also need to appeal to young people. Covid. Content is becoming king, or queen in our worlds. We need a multimedia millenial. Clint Davids joined us an intern to manage this. He's not an intern anymore. 2022. Events and spin off projects became too big for us. Dibu M. called our office looking for details of another association to send her CV. I intercepted, got her to redirect her CV to me and we hired her. In 2023, events and projects started mounting and the amount of data we are handling. We need the systems and operations brain who can also communicate. I found out Carin Abrahams was in the market for a job in early 2024. Hired! Breathe. The foundations are stabilising but so much to do (isn't there always?). We have just taken on Kirsten Kupferberg to help drive growth, commercial partnerships and helping members more acutely with opportunities. We're growing and learning, sometimes failing, but failing fast and moving on quickly. Our members steer everything we do. We have to keep driving. Africa Scotland Business Network. Meet the current team behind the dream üåç\n\nüåü Happy Hump Day! üåü As we kick off May, I am thrilled to share some exciting updates with you all. May 14th i will be attending #GoogleIO2024 and stay around San Francisco for a bit, let's grab a coffee if you're attending or in the area! It's going to be an incredible event filled with innovation, networking opportunities, and cutting-edge tech insights. üöÄThanks Google ! Let's also take a moment to acknowledge the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce for their continuous efforts in attracting and supporting tech companies in and to Florida. Their unwavering support plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the tech industry in our sunshine state. Thank you for paving the way towards a brighter tech landscape in Florida Alison Miuccio , Sarah Pearson, IOM and Troy McLellan üå¥üíº Why are such events and support important? üîπ Networking Opportunities: Events like Google IO bring together industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts under one roof, creating valuable networking opportunities that can lead to collaborations and partnerships. üîπ Knowledge Sharing: Tech events provide a platform for sharing insights, trends, and best practices within the industry, fostering learning and growth among professionals. üîπ Economic Impact: Attracting and supporting tech companies to regions like Florida not only boosts job creation but also stimulates economic growth through investments and innovation. Let's continue to support initiatives that drive technological advancement and propel us towards a brighter future. Together, we can shape a thriving tech ecosystem that benefits us all. Can't wait to see what the future holds for tech in Florida! üí°üíª #TechInnovation #GoogleIO2024 #FloridaTechScene #NetworkingOpportunities #coasttocoast\n\nOne event that was dearly missed when Covid hit was the Boston TechJam. When I first discovered it in 2017, I wondered how I missed it in the prior years. The Boston area's tech industry block party is a fun, light setting celebrating the great technology industry. üíª üîå üíæ When it came back last year, I was overjoyed. It was gone for three long years. It offers so much to attendees: ‚û° Find out what tech companies are doing. ‚û° Learn about tech companies in the area you may not have heard of. ‚û° Connect with fellow tech professionals in an easy setting. ‚û° Find out who's hiring if you happen to be looking for a job (no, I'm not in that category!) ‚û° Collect swag from many of the companies exhibiting. All in all, a nice deal. üôè The event is back again later today, and I'll be there - though praying the rain stays away, which is asking for a lot these days. üåß If you're a tech professional in Boston, The Lawn on D is the place to be later today - and I hope I see you there. #networking #softwareengineering #technology #bostontech"
