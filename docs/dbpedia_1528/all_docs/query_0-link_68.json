Attended by over 200 guests including honorees, community leaders, members of the public, judges and elected officials, this event honored the tremendous contributions from the women who make a difference to improve our County as neighbors, friends, coworkers, business owners, caregivers, community-leaders and residents.\n\n“Women’s History Month provides the opportunity to acknowledge Orange County's long history of trailblazing women championing noteworthy causes,” said Supervisor Foley. “Our Women Making a Difference event honored our caring community leaders whose work benefits families through caregiving, access to justice, advocacy for workers and businesses, positive climate action, public education, the arts, neighborhood safety, and more. Many of the awardees shared stories of their family’s immigrant experience and pursuit of the American dream through hard work, education, and innovation. Our honorees and awardees contribute to our Orange County lifestyle and improve our quality of life all year long.”\n\nNominees were honored for the following categories: Arts, Business, Community Service, Education, Health Services, Judicial, Labor, Military Service, Philanthropy, Public Safety (Fire), Public Safety (Police), and Services Industry.\n\n2022 Awardees\n\nArts – Diana Farrell\n\nAs the Founder, President, and Artistic Director of Lyric Opera of Orange County, Diana brought opera back to our county after a 12-year hiatus with plans to put our county on the national opera map. In a few short years, her opera company has produced 7 operas and dozens of educational events and competitions, inspiring staff and musicians to perform joyfully and at their peak level.\n\nBusiness – Kelly Vlahakis-Hanks\n\nPresident and CEO of ECOS, Kelley Vlahakis-Hanks, has transformed her family’s 55-year-old green cleaning products company started by her father, a Greek Immigrant, into a leader in sustainable manufacturing and safer community throughout the world. Kelly has created a corporate culture of diversity and empowerment with a leadership team that is 58% female and 41% BIPOC. Kelly’s leadership demonstrates how successful businesses can prioritize employees, customers, and the planet. ECOS is headquartered in Cypress, California.\n\nCommunity Service – Claudia Keller\n\nClaudia Keller serves as the second female and first Latina CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County and, under her leadership last year, Second Harvest distributed nearly 60 million pounds of food through its partner network, serving more than 489,000 residents per month.

Over her career, Judge Hernandez has empowered victims and supported our most vulnerable children and has demonstrated the power the legal system can have to change lives and make social change.\n\nLabor – Gloria Alvarado\n\nAs Executive Director of the Orange County Labor Federation, Gloria has led 95 different unions consisting of over 200,000 essential workers through the pandemic. While many workers remained at home and under quarantine, grocery store workers, nurses, sanitation workers, bus drivers, and so many more risked their own health to protect all of us. Under her leadership, the federation spent the pandemic providing resources, food, and unemployment support services to the workers and the wider community.\n\nMilitary Service – Alexis Federico\n\nAlexis Federico served as an attack helicopter pilot in the US Marine Corps from 2003-2013, completing multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
