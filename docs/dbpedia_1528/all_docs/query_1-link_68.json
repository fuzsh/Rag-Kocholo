        "text": "Asya Kamraz joined ELIS Villamartín in Year 6, from Russia, without a solid foundation in English or Spanish. However, with effort and determination, two qualities which have always characterised her, she managed to overcome those barriers and consolidated herself as one of the most successful students in the school, in very little time. In addition to this, she demonstrated her progression in Spanish Language by taking A-Level and Spanish Baccalaureate, achieving the highest grade possible in the two Spanish Modality subjects which she studied: Philosophy and Art History.\n\nAsya was a Prefect whilst in Year 12, and was Head Girl in Year 13, actively participating in the school community with a creative and positive spirit, both recognised by her classmates and teachers.\n\nFor these reasons, and because she demonstrates what it is to be an ELIS student, we believe she deserves the recognition which comes with the award: Alumnus of the Year 2020-21."
