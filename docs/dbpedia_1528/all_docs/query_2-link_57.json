        "text": "As so often happens with debut albums, the sessions for Smoosh's She Like Electric were fraught. The band were inexperienced, and became overexcited. There were disagreements with their \"mentor\", Jason McGerr of US college-rock stalwarts Death Cab for Cutie. Eventually, things got so out of control that McGerr was forced to lock Smoosh's drummer, Chloe, out of the studio. \"The next thing I know, there's a tap on the window of the studio control room and Chloe's standing there with a little piece of paper, on which she's written, 'Do you want to fight?'\" He laughs a slightly baffled-sounding laugh.\n\nIt's a sound you swiftly get used to when discussing Smoosh. Everyone seems slightly baffled by the band - from McGerr, who discovered the duo while teaching at Seattle's Drum School, to their manager and father, Mike, who recently spotted them hanging out backstage when they supported Pearl Jam. He found himself \"scratching my head in awe. They were playing with Eddie Vedder - not playing instruments, just playing, throwing oranges around and stuff. I peeked in, saw that, and thought, 'This is crazy.'\" And then there's the audiences, who, McGerr says, tend to react to Smoosh's live performances with \"a funny look of amazement\".\n\nThe only people who aren't slightly baffled are Smoosh themselves, who seem to think a critically acclaimed rock band consisting of two sisters, one 13 years old and one 11, is the very height of normality. \"We didn't really decide to be in a band,\" says Asya, 13, who writes the songs, plays keyboard and sings. \"It just happened.\"\n\nHer younger sister was taking drum lessons from McGerr, inspired by the sight of \"this really cool sparkly red drum set\". One day, Asya told McGerr that she wrote songs on a keyboard at home. He was, he says, \"just startled\". \"I think that for a lot of musicians who've been doing this for a long time, when we see youth having so much effortless fun creating songs, it rekindles our initial feelings and love for music. That's what's happening with a lot of these artists who want to perform with them. To see an 11-year-old bang her head while playing the drums . . .\" he sighs. \"It's awesome.\" Their celebrity fans include Sufjan Stevens, Sleater-Kinney, the Go! Team and Bloc Party.\n\nFor their part, the sisters are unruffled by their success. Nerves certainly don't seem to be an issue. Chloe prefers playing big shows to their early performances two years ago at open-mic events in Seattle. Then, she feared, \"people were just clapping because they thought it was so cute that we were singing\". And no, says Asya, she doesn't get nervous on stage, or meeting rock stars: \"We're all just doing the same thing.\" Even the actor Tobey Maguire was greeted with a degree of coolness when he ventured backstage after a show in Los Angeles. \"He'd heard us and wanted to see us,\" Asya says with a shrug.\n\nDespite their insouciance, there is something very impressive about She Like Electric, whose title was conceived when the pair were playing on the trampoline in their back garden. For a start, there's the fact that sisters aged 13 and 11 could work together without a terrible eruption of sibling violence. There is the occasional spat, though: \"We fight when Asya's being annoying,\" confides Chloe. \"She's like, 'You're not doing that right! I'm doing it right and I have to sing and play the piano and you just have to play the drums and you're not doing it right!' Then I get really mad, and I say, 'Why are you acting like my mother?'\"\n\nThen there's the musical content. America is a country with an alarmingly high cuteness threshold, but She Like Electric is no sickly novelty. Instead, it's a collection of sparse, exhilaratingly skewed pop songs, powered by Asya's high, slurred vocals, untutored electric-piano playing and her sister's booming drums. You occasionally catch the hint of an influence - a snatch of Tori Amos on the exquisitely melancholy It's Cold, a trace of hip-hop on Rad and the frantic Bottlenose - but most of it sounds like nothing else.\n\nThat may be because, as Chloe puts it, they \"didn't really know that much music\" before they started the band. (One journalist breathlessly informed the duo that they could be \"bigger than Led Zeppelin\", only to be met with the question: \"Is that big?\") Asya says her inspiration comes \"from poetry and stuff. I never write songs about anything in particular, just stuff. They're pretty optimistic, about going out there and working hard.\"\n\nSmoosh's future is open. \"They don't have goals,\" says their dad. \"They're not treating this like a stepping stone. I ask them, 'Does this sound fun, and if they say yes, I set it up.\" McGerr thinks \"their talents are growing as quickly as their heights\", but notes that Smoosh are subject to the kind of distractions few other rock bands face: \"At any time, they could have a show planned and one of them would much rather go on a field trip with the class\".\n\n\"I think the worst thing that could happen is Chloe borrows Asya's coat and gets a stain on it,\" he adds. \"Then there's potentially a cancelled tour. It really comes down to stuff like that.\" Then he laughs another slightly baffled-sounding laugh.\n\nÂ· She Like Electric is out now on Pattern 25.\n\nSmoosh play Cargo, London EC2, on November 28.
