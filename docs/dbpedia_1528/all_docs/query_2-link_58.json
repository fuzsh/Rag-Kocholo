        "text": "Fredric Powell Beecher, 95, of Davenport, Iowa passed away peacefully at his home on Monday April 29, 2024. A Memorial Mass will be celebrated at 11:00 a.m. Thursday, May 9, 2024, at St Andrew’s Catholic Church in Blue Grass. Visitation will be held from 10:00 until 11:00 a.m. Thursday at the church. Halligan-McCabe-DeVries Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements.\n\nMemorials may be made to St. Andrews or St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.\n\nFredric Powell Beecher was born on February 23, 1929 in Decatur, Illinois to Vivian (Powell) and Leon Beecher. He was united in marriage to Mary “Sue” Curran on May 6, 1950, in Dixon, Illinois. She preceded him in death on March 16, 2017. He later married JoAnne “Jo” (Arthur) Doofe on October 15, 2017 at St. Anthony’s Catholic Church, Davenport, Iowa.\n\nFred attended Illinois State University and participated in their football, basketball, and baseball programs. In 1949, Fred was scouted from a farm team he played on in Champagne, IL to try out for the St. Louis Cardinals. He so famously and humbly retold his experience of the end of the two week try-out: Manager Billy Southworth called him in and said “Fred, you are a really good pitcher. But we don't need good pitchers, we need great ones!” Fred always remained loyal to this team. He loved watching the Hawkeyes as well. He coached and participated in his children’s sports and cheered on his grandchildren and great-grandchildren as much as possible.\n\nFred spent his career in sales. He was always an optimist and enjoyed moving many times for his jobs and to start new endeavors in his sales career. He was especially proud of the seven year stay in Sedro Wooley, WA where he and his family started a cabinet company and where he was able to connect with many of his father’s side of the family.\n\nHe remained spry and humorous right until the end. A visit with him always included a wonderful story from the past. His impeccable memory, light-heartedness and style of engaging his family and strangers alike will always be cherished. Fred’s favorite pastimes included fishing, playing sports with his kids, music, and storytelling. He took up painting when he retired; we all have been blessed with one or more beautiful works of art. He was an excellent golfer, his amateur career includes an albatross (double eagle) at the Duck Creek Golf Course. There were several family Beecher Opens that took place through the years to which Fred took home the cherished “Horse’s Ass Trophy” at least one time!\n\nFredric is survived by his wife, Jo, of Davenport; his son, Mike (Michelle) Beecher, of Palatine, IL, and his children, Michael (Debbie) Beecher, and Matthew Beecher; his daughter, Susan (Gerry) Haan, of Davenport, Iowa, and their children, Gerry (Melanie) Haan, and Katie (Creighton) Duncan, and Jessica (Jason) Kluever; his son, David (Becky) Beecher, of Iowa City, Iowa and their children, Nic (Taylor) Beecher, Alex (Andrea) Beecher, Asya (Jarid) Reid, Addy Beecher, Tony (Abby) Sturgell, Tim (Katie) Sturgell; and his son Matthew (Lisa) Beecher of Davenport and their children, Emily Beecher (Zach) Schmidt, Aleah and Ben Beecher. Fred was also “Grandpa-the-Great” to 27 great-grandchildren.\n\nIn addition to his wife Sue, Fred was preceded in death by his parents and a brother Bert Beecher. May they rest in peace."
