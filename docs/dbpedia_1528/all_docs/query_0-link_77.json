        "text": "Authors\n\nGennady Aigi (1934–2006) was born in the Chuvash Republic, and lived in Moscow. His translations of French poetry into the Chuvash language brought him recognition at the beginning of his career as a writer. However his unusual work was not welcomed in Russian periodicals and publishing houses. After perestroika, he published many critically acclaimed books of his poetry in Russian and Chuvash, as well as numerous essays and translations. His poems were translated into many languages. Without exaggeration, he was the most celebrated Russian poet of the time. A book of his poems in French translation entitled Veronica’s Notebook was published in Paris in 1984. Peter France of Edinburgh published two books of his translations from Aigi into English, much appreciated. Aigi was awarded the Golden Wreath of Struga (Macedonia), the French Academy Translators’ Award and the Andrey Belyi Prize for Poetry (1987). In 2000, he was awarded the first ever Boris Paternak Prize for Poetry.\n\nIvan Akhmetiev was born in Moscow in 1950. Educated at Moscow State University, where he studied physics, he began to write at the end of 1960s. Until 1989 only one of his poems was published in Russia. Since then many of his poems have appeared in literary magazines in Russia and abroad. Critics defined him as a minimalist and miniaturist. He has published four poetry collections entitled Poems, only Poems (1993), Nine Years (2001), Amores: Poems 1966-2002 (2002) and Never Mind It Will Turn Out All Right (2011). Some of his miniatures have been translated into German and English.\n\nMargarita Al (pen name of Margarita Almuhametova) was born in 1959 in Alma-Aty, Kazakhstan, and now lives in Moscow. A poet, an artist and a graphic designer, she runs DOOS Books, which publishes The PO Journal and poetry books.

Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to “the severity of the response of the Russian authorities”. Her collection titled Poems and Essays appeared in Moscow in 2012; she has also published a memoir, Riot Days (2017; an English translation is due from Allen Lane / Penguin Books).
