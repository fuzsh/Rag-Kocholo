        "text": "Image: Becca Wheeler\n\nSingaporean artist Abby Simone launched her music career late last year with the single ‘Same Sunrise’ and alongside 300,000+ Spotify streams quickly attracted global attention for her beguiling music that melds R&B, jazz, soul and pop.\n\nShe recently released her second single ‘Walking Away’. It presents a moodier, lusher sound with Simone’s gorgeously warm vocals taking centre stage, driving the song. Sonically it is a gentle pop-soul track that gradually builds to a dramatic closer as Simone sings of the pain we experience when separated from loved ones.\n\n“The song builds up to an explosion and that's how I feel when I walk away from the people that I love, especially at the airport, where you turn so they can’t see you cry,” she says.\n\nRaised in a Tamil household in Singapore where Christian hymns were the main soundtrack and Simone had to listen to pop music covertly, she started her career by forming a band that blended jazz and hip-hop before deciding to go it alone. Determined to be completely independent in order to realise her own vision, she learnt Logic Pro and honed her vocal, guitar and production talents that lead to her debut release last November.\n\nSimone creates beautiful music that is both comfortingly familiar, but also strikingly unique. A listening experience that really generates the feels, and with more music out soon she is a talent you should have on your playlist right now. We recently caught up with her to find out more about her music and career.\n\nHi Abby! Thanks for chatting to us today. How is everything in your world right now?\n\nHi! I have a new song thats gonna be out in two days and I’m SO EXCITED for that.\n\nYou recently released your second single ‘Walking Away’ which is an absolutely gorgeous R&B-soul-pop ballad, which builds throughout the song to this dramatic closer. Can you tell us a little about the inspiration behind the song?\n\nI wanted to create an ambience of the emotions you experience when saying goodbye (to an ex, to people you love, or goodbye forever). You try to stay strong and try to end thing amicably and then the bridge is the waterworks and explosion of feelings you experience.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about how the song came together?\n\nI wrote this song in Malpensa airport, ha ha! I had just said goodbye to someone and I couldn’t control my emotions so I had to write it down immediately. Once I got in the studio with Cuurley, we finished this in a day!\n\nBoth ‘Walking Away’ and your debut single ‘Same Sunrise’ have this incredibly lush soundscape which has elements of soul and pop and R&B that is just so beautiful to listen to. As you mentioned, they also explore the emotions of being away from those you love. Is there a particular sound and/or message you aim to project with your music?\n\nThank you! When I first started as a singer-songwriter , It was just me & my guitar (on ‘Same Sunrise’), then I met a producer and together we created the more ambience sound on ‘Walking Away’. My upcoming single is going to highlight my production skills. I want to take people with me on an actual journey of how I got to this point.\n\n‘Walking Away’ is just your second single and you are already attracting global attention for your music. How does it feel to have people connecting with your music more or less straight away?\n\nOh lordddd it feels SURREAL! I am extremely grateful for all the messages I’ve been receiving from people online. I love connecting with people and hearing their stories too. What warms my heart even more is when my close friends/neighbours send me messages about how they have been playing the song on repeat not just to support a friend, but genuinely because they love it.\n\nHow did your career in music start, and was it something you always wanted to do?\n\nNooooope. I actually wanted to be a zookeeper! Then one day, I borrowed a guitar and was hooked. I watched YouTube videos everyday, I was so eager to learn to play guitar and to sing. That was when I was 18, 19 and a few years later, I started turning my poems into tunes. I slowly gained confidence, posted them on Instagram once or twice a month and here I am!\n\nI believe you grew up in a household where Christian hymns were the main music and pop music was not allowed, and you had to listen to it in secret. How do you think this has shaped you as an artist?\n\nThe rebellion! If I didn’t trust my instincts, or paved my own path, or believed in myself when someone laughed when I told them I was going to tour some day, I would be far from where I’m at right now. It’s hard though, cause it feels so wrong to disobey your parents - but phew!\n\nThe music industry has never been a particularly welcoming or safe space for female artists, mainly because it has been run by older, straight, white men for decades. You have discussed in the past that for you in Singapore the easiest way to get ahead in music was to sexualise your image, which you refused to do. What are your thoughts on gender equality and sexism in music, and do you see a difference in the Singaporean industry versus other parts of the world?\n\nIt’s like trying to crack a walnut with barehands - not impossible but it’s a lot. Working with producers/musicians in London has been nothing but amazing. They are mostly men, yes, but not a single one of them was condescending. They are always respectful, humble and I get to be 100% me. Some producers in Singapore are also paving the path for female musicians/artists to feel comfortable in the studio. Over the years I’ve gotten quite resilient in this matter so if I’m ever faced with sexism from a in the studio again, oh he is gonna know!\n\n‘Walking Away’ is out now, what else do you have planned for 2023?\n\nA new single on 01/03/23. I am super excited for this tune! It’s nothing like the first two singles but, the way I approached the songwriting is the same. Also, hopefully my first live performance and definitely more music.\n\n‘Walking Away’ is out now. You can buy and stream here.\n\nTo keep up with all things Abby Simone you can follow her on Instagram and YouTube."
