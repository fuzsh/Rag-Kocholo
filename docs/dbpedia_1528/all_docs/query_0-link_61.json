Carlos was also a co-creator of THE GRAND PARADE, a kaleidoscopic spectacle of history which premiered at Arena Stage (Washington, DC) in February 2013, and played in the US, Moscow, and Norway. He co-created and was a lead actor in all four performances of the GARDEN CYCLE, including Maarten Soetendrop in the DISAPPEARANCE and DON QUIXOTE in the UnPOSSESSED. In 2002, Carlos and Artistic Director Stacy Klein conceived Double Edge’s annual summer series of Indoor/Outdoor Traveling Spectacle performances. Closely connected to this work is Carlos’s role as the leader of Double Edge’s grassroots campaigns and audience development initiatives. For this he has drawn from his previous work in Argentina, particularly the PLAZA performance project, which brought together thousands of young participants and spectators in squares throughout Buenos Aires. He received an Arts International Inroads Grant, a Lila Wallace APAP award, and was a recipient of the Doris Duke/Andrew Mellon/TCG New Generations Mentorship Award.\n\nBefore coming to Double Edge, Carlos founded the award-winning puppet theatre DIABLOMUNDO, named one of the “Top Ten Most Important Argentine Theatres of the 20th Century” by the Association of Argentinean Critics. He co-created and performed in more than 15 performances with DIABLOMUNDO, both original works, and adaptations, which toured internationally. In 1992, DIABLOMUNDO was invited to the First International Puppet Festival produced by the Henson Foundation, as one of the 16 international participant companies. In addition to his work with DIABLOMUNDO, Carlos organized groups of self-managed actors and artist cooperatives as part of the national cultural resistance during the Argentine fight for freedom against the military dictatorship that lasted from 1976 to 1982 and beyond. These groups included the Agrupacion para el Teatro Rioplatense (1978), Teatro del Ateneo (1978), and Nucleo de Artistas del Sur (1982). In 1985, he was one of the founding members of the Movimiento de Teatro Popular (MOTEPO) a movement of theatres that worked to decentralize and collaborate with high-quality art forms in nonconventional theatre places such as streets, factories, and neighborhoods."
