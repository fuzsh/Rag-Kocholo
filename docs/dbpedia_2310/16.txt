Early Origins of the Dease family

The surname Dease was first found in Angus (Gaelic: Aonghas), part of the Tayside region of northeastern Scotland, and present day Council Area of Angus, formerly known as Forfar or Forfarshire, where they were descended from the Gaelic MacDhai, son of David. From the 13th century onward the name was anglicized MacDavid, Davidson, Deasson and Deas. The branches using Deas and Deasson settled in Angus and in Banffshire at the end of the fifteenth century.

"James Dais is recorded in Dundee, 1611, and Mr. John Daes in Huntliewood, 1638. James Daes was minister of the church of Ersiltoune, 1643. Andrew Daes, stabler, appears in Edinburgh, 1627, and David Daes, tailor there, 1666." 2

Dease migration to the United States +

The crossing to North America did not seem so great in comparison with the hardships many Scots endured at home. It was long, expensive, and cramped, but also rewarding. North America offered land and the chance for settlers to prove themselves in a new place. And many did prove themselves as they fought to forge a new nation in the American War of Independence. The ancestors of those Scots can now experience much of their once-lost heritage through the Clan societies and highland games that have sprung up across North America in the last century. A search of immigration and passenger lists revealed many important, early immigrants to North America bearing the name of Dease:
