        "text": "The yearly tuition at Loretto was $80-$100, a significant amount in those days.\n\nThe main Loretto Academy building was constructed in two stages. The North Wing, with the lower roofline, was built in 1869. Ten years later the rest of the structure was erected.\n\nOn January 19, 1938, a disastrous fire destroyed the interior of the South Wing. Fortunately, none of the sisters or boarders were injured, and the stone walls of the building remained intact. Reconstruction was quickly begun, and the building was again in use the following September.\n\nThe Loretto Academy celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1961. In 1970, the boarding school was closed and Loretto became the Catholic High School of Niagara Falls, until 1982 when St. Paul High School was converted from a senior school.\n\nThe building operated as The Loretto Convent and Christian Life Centre as a site for religious retreats for many students within the Catholic (Separate) Board. In May of 2005, Sister Carmen Diston, provincial leader of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the impending closure of the retreat, citing expensive upgrades that would have been necessary to bring the centre up to modern standards. It closed permanently in September 2005 and was put up for sale.\n\nNiagara Falls municipal politicians narrowly decided not to declare the Loretto centre a historically significant property in October 2005. The property owner, the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, voiced opposition to historical designation, fearing that it would have drastically lowered the site's potential sale price due to development restrictions on the existing building.\n\nRomzap Ltd., owners of the Sheraton Fallsview Hotel and Conference Centre, announced their purchase of the 7.4 acre Loretto property in January 2006. No plans for the site were released at the time of the purchase, but in May of 2010, a proposal for a 57-story hotel overlooking the Horseshoe Falls was announced. Romzap stated that the land would be ideally suited for the hotel as well as two other high-rises that could be opened as either hotels or condominiums. If completed, the proposed hotel structure would be the city's tallest building. Local grassroots organization Friends of Niagara Falls opposed the plan, citing a range of environmental, aesthetic, and heritage reasons against the project.\n\nThe development was subject to zoning applications and community consulting between 2010 and 2018. In August of 2018, the Chinese-Canadian company 3Bridges Properties purchased the Lorettto site from Romzap Ltd. Development plans call for an estimated billion-dollar three-tower hotel and residence complex which includes a 32-storey south tower, a 57-storey central tower, and 42-storey north tower including a luxury hotel, condominium residences, and an amenities complex. According to 3Bridges Properties CEO Dan Zhang, the main intended target audience for the development is tourists and property buyers from Asia.\n\nThe property development design was billed as a historically sympathetic restoration, retaining, conserving, and incorporating several existing architectural elements from the Loretto Academy building, including its mansard roof and cupola. However, recent architectural renderings and computer simulations of the proposed development show the Loretto Academy property being dwarfed by the massive surrounding towers."
