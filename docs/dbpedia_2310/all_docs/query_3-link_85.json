        "text": "In June 1920 the Hulton family were still repairing their house in Venice following the bomb damage during the First World War. They were short of funds to undertake all the repairs. Teresa visited Italy annually, returning to Venice in the spring to stay with her family.\n\nIn March 1921 Teresa was shocked by the sudden death of her father, William Stokes Hulton. She wrote on the 25th of March 1921 to Gioconda: ‘it is too sad we should none of us have known that poor father was really in such a shaky state.’\n\nTeresa’s mother, Costanza, died in 1939. Costanza Hulton used to come to visit Teresa in England after her husband died and Teresa went to see her in Italy.\n\nTragically, Teresa’s sister Gioconda, who intended on coming to live with Teresa during the Second World War, died in 1940 when the motor bus that she was travelling in collided with a heavy goods vehicle. Gioconda was travelling from Cannes to Nice to arrange for repatriation before travelling to Britain to live with Teresa and Lord Berwick at Attingham. During the Second World War, Gioconda helped at a refugee canteen at Aix-les-Bains and her obituary praises the support that she gave to people in need.\n\nFriends from Italy visited Teresa at Attingham, including Mrs Watkins who led the team of nurses that Teresa had helped in the war. In October 1920 Mrs Watkins was still working abroad. Her help attending to damage left by the war was much appreciated in Italy.\n\nIn June 1920, Teresa’s friend Lady Helen D’Abernon presented Teresa at court. Lord and Lady Berwick spent some time in London each year, Lady Berwick staying with her friends whilst Lord Berwick stayed at his club. In his memoir People and Places James Lees-Milne recounts meeting Lady Berwick at the house of Lady D’Abernon to discuss passing Attingham over to the National Trust. In London, Lord Berwick took his seat in the House of Lords to hear the debates which he eagerly followed in the newspapers. The couple enjoyed visiting galleries and art sale rooms and sometimes made purchases for Attingham.\n\nTeresa made many new friends in Shropshire. After being gassed in the First World War, the Italian Commendator Tranquillo Sidoli came to Shropshire for medical treatment and to be with his sister. He founded a confectionery business in Shrewsbury and Teresa often visited. She enjoyed being able to speak in Italian to the Sidolis. Later, with the Second World War looming, Teresa swapped the Hulton palazzo in Venice that she and Gioconda had inherited for the Sidoli premises on Wyle Cop. This provided an ideal solution as Sidoli wanted to return to Italy, whilst it was difficult for Teresa and Gioconda to retain their family home in the face of Mussolini’s rising power.\n\nThe Allies did not give Italy all the promised territories after the war. Post-war riots, lootings, rail strikes and the possibility of revolution helped to lead to the rise of Fascism in Italy. The Berwick’s relationship with Teresa’s uncle Luigi Villari was strained in the 1930s due to his support of Mussolini and Fascism. As one of Mussolini’s Aides, Luigi was imprisoned after Mussolini’s death. Fortunately, Teresa helped persuade the authorities to release Luigi.\n\nThe Hulton family had friends on both sides of the war following their temporary move to Germany in 1905, where Teresa trained to be a concert pianist. Although the Hultons appear to have given up contact with German friends during the war, for Christmas 1920 Gioconda accompanied Lady D’Abernon to Berlin. Lord Berwick wrote: ‘It must be very strange in Berlin, but I gather you do not see many Germans. I am sure it is a great thing that we are so well respected there.’\n\nFollowing her marriage, Lady Berwick brought her wartime letters and photographs to Attingham from Italy. She showed great attention to detail in neatly cutting slips in one of her photograph albums to hold wartime photographs. The result is beautiful, but must have been time-consuming to create. Whilst Lord Berwick discarded much of his wartime correspondence, the fact that Teresa took the trouble to preserve so many valuable records of her war work suggests that she recognised this period in her life not only as important to herself but, through bequeathing her documents to the National Trust, to posterity.\n\nAfter moving into Attingham Hall in 1921, Teresa lived there with her husband for around 26 years. Attingham was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1947 upon Lord Berwick’s death.\n\nTeresa lived another 25 years in the Hall, sharing the space with the small numbers of National Trust visitors and the Shropshire Adult Education College. Following a car accident at the front gates, Lady Berwick passed away in 1972. The Berwicks are remembered at the Berwick Memorial in the Deer Park and Lady Berwick is also remembered on the East Colonnade at the side of the house overlooking the river.\n\nLord and Lady Berwick left a generous legacy to future generations. Their years of careful restoration and preservation at Attingham has led to its success and survival into the 21st century. Over a 100 years on from the First World War, many people enjoy visits to Attingham and to relax and to learn of its stories.\n\nCataloguing work and research into the Attingham First World War stories continues. There’s certainly more to discover!\n\nThank you for reading this blog and if you would like to visit, please take a look at our website.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890–1972)\n\nOn the 18th of December 1918 Teresa received exciting news. She wrote to her mother, Costanza, ‘Just heard that Mrs W + I (and I suppose the Gordon Watsons) have received the Croce di Guerra.’\n\nThe Croce di Guerra (Cross of War) was instituted by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in January 1918. The medal was awarded for merit in ‘land, sea or air operations after at least a year’s service in the trenches or elsewhere in contact with the enemy; to those wounded in action; those who had performed acts of bravery and those who had achieved promotion for a mention for war effort.’\n\nThe medal was bronze and the front shows the royal cypher and the inscription ‘Merito di Guerra’. The reverse shows a five pointed star on a background of rays. The ribbon is alternate blue and white stripes.\n\nTeresa was awarded the Croce di Guerra in January 1919. She wrote to her future husband, Lord Berwick, about the ceremony that she and Mrs Watkins attended to receive their medals:\n\n‘On the last evening General Caviglia assembled his HQ staff and presented each of us with the Croce di Guerra, making a charming speech. We were much touched and it is a nice ending to our war work especially coming from such a fine soldier’.\n\nIn the same letter she added, upon hearing of Lord Berwick’s involvement with diplomatic work in Paris to negotiate a Peace Treaty: ‘I see you have been promoted. Many congratulations – we seem to be getting on in our military careers’.\n\nLord Berwick wrote back to her: ‘My dear Teresa, I was delighted to hear what a successful and pleasant journey you had and besides your other successes, that you had been decorated by General Caviglia with the Croce di Guerra. My very best congratulations – I feel this is a very great compliment to you and a surely well earned reward for your devoted work for Italy during the war and it gives me the greatest pleasure that you have it and as you say, to have received it in such circumstances and at the hands of so great a general makes it a still more valued possession.’\n\nTeresa was also subsequently awarded the Medaglia Commemorativa Della Guerra 1915 – 1918 Per Il Compimento dell Unita d’Italia (the Commemorative Medal For The War 1915 -1918 For The Completing Of The Union Of Italy). This medal was introduced in July 1920. The title of the medal refers to ‘Completing The Union Of Italy’ because the Italians saw the First World War as continuing their endeavour to unite all areas of Italy into one nation by acquiring land held by Austria.\n\nThe medal was awarded to armed service personnel, civilians who assisted the armed services and to Red Cross workers and ambulance drivers. The medal was designed by the sculptor S. Canevari. It features the King Victor Emmanuel III in a military uniform and helmet on the front and around the edge are the words ‘Guerra Per L’Unita d’Italia 1915 – 1918’ (War For The Unity Of Italy 1915 – 1918). The reverse shows a winged ‘Victory’ figure held aloft by two helmeted soldiers and around the edge are the words ‘COINATA N.EL BRONZO NEIVIICO’ (Coined from enemy bronze).\n\nAnother medal in the Attingham collection is the Croce Commemorativa della Terza Armata, Guerra 1915 – 1918. This is the Commemorative Cross of the Italian Third Army during the First World War. It features a white enamel and silvered bronze Greek cross surmounted by the Crown of Savoy. On the face of the cross is depicted the Lion of St Mark with a sword in its right paw.\n\nLord Berwick (1877–1947)\n\nOn the 27th of June 1919 Lord Berwick received from The War Office a formal notice of his demobilisation from the army, which had occurred on the 2nd of June 1919. The document included the following words of gratitude:\n\n‘I am also to take this opportunity of conveying the thanks of the Army Council for your services to the Country during the late war and for the excellent work you have done’.\n\nLord Berwick was awarded the British War Medal and The Allied Victory Medal for his war services.\n\nThe British War Medal is a campaign medal of the British Empire awarded for service during World War One. The medal was approved in 1919 for all who had served between the 5th of August 1914 and the 11th of November 1918. Approximately 6.5 million medals were issued.\n\nThe medal is circular and is made of silver (although some were bronze). The front of the medal shows the head of King George V. The reverse shows St George on horseback with the dates 1914 and 1918. The medal ribbon has a wide stripe of orange flanked by two narrow white stripes which in turn are flanked by two narrow black stripes, followed by two narrow blue stripes.\n\nThe Allied Victory Medal was issued within the British Empire as a result of the Peace Conference that resulted in the Treaty of Versailles. It was awarded to British citizens who had been mobilised during the First World War.\n\nThe medal is circular and is lacquered in bronze. The front of the medal shows the winged figure of the goddess Victory. The reverse has the words ‘The Great War For Civilisation 1914 – 1918’ surrounded by a laurel leaf. The ribbon has a rainbow design with violet on the outside moving to red in the centre.\n\nThe British War Medal and the Allied Victory Medal awarded to Lord Berwick for his service in the First World War are inscribed to ‘Major Berwick’. Peter Duckers, former Curator of Shropshire Regimental Museum, said that these medals, which are now housed in the museum, would have been inscribed for the highest rank achieved by an individual and he is in no doubt that Lord Berwick was a Major at some point, although he did say this may have only been in an acting or ceremonial capacity.\n\nAs part of his work for the British Embassy, Lord Berwick was involved in the Peace Conference in Paris in January 1919 that immediately preceded the Treaty of Versailles. In March 1915 Lord Berwick had written to his future wife, Teresa, from Paris. He wrote: ‘it would be very interesting to be here at the end of the war, when peace negotiations begin.’\n\nAs part of his diplomatic work, Lord Berwick attended a formal dinner and wrote to Teresa on the 27th of February 1919:\n\n‘The Ambassador gave a big dinner of 60 people on Saturday to meet the Prince of Wales… nearly all the principal delegates were there, with the exception of poor Clemenceau who was of course unable to come, and Lloyd George.’\n\nLord Berwick admired the Borghese plate that had once adorned the dinner tables of Pauline Borghese, sister of Napoleon. Lord Berwick was interested in the supposed link between furniture at Attingham and Caroline Murat, another of Napoleon’s sisters. William, the Third Lord Berwick (1773-1842), was reputed to have acquired objects from her palace in Naples and brought them to Attingham.\n\nAttending the dinner, Lord Berwick thought that ‘the most picturesque figure was the Emir Feisal (leader of The Arabs in World War One), closely attended by Col. Lawrence’ (T. E. Lawrence of Arabia).\n\nIn 1925 T. E. Lawrence bought Clouds Hill, a small cottage in Dorset now owned by the National Trust. It was conveniently placed for him to retreat to whilst stationed at nearby Bovington Camp, although tragically he died in a motorcycle accident in 1935 whilst returning from the camp.\n\nLord Berwick wrote to Teresa about the Peace Conference again on March the 13th 1919. Unfortunately, ‘all the big questions still remain to be adjudicated on, and from the little one knows, no power except perhaps ourselves is animated by the Wilsonian spirit sufficiently to give up anything they want in the general interest… but there seems to be a feeling that Germany will relapse into Bolshevism if peace is not concluded soon.’\n\nThe meeting of the Allied victors to set peace terms for defeated Central Powers following the end of the First World War was long and complicated. Thirty two countries were represented at the talks.\n\nThe US President, Woodrow Wilson, would not support the punitive fines on Germany desired by other countries. In the end, the USA did not ratify the treaty and did not join the League of Nations. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had doubts about the harshness of the Treaty of Versailles on Germany, prophetically saying in 1918 that ‘it is essential that the settlement after this war shall be one which does not itself bear the seed of future war.’\n\nIt took six months from the end of the war to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nOn March the 24th 1919 Lord Berwick visited Noyon, France. In Noyon and its surrounding towns there was ‘hardly a house standing,’ and Montdidier was ‘entirely destroyed. Shell holes all round it.’ He wrote of the terrible damage to Noyon Cathedral, with its ‘roof entirely gone and part of the walls. All the glass gone.’ Fortunately ‘a very beautiful altar 18th century in the center of the church’ remained ‘undamaged.’ After twenty years of repair work the cathedral was restored.\n\nLord Berwick was not the only one to attend peace talks. Teresa’s uncle Luigi Villari was involved in peace negotiations in the Salonica Peace Treaty that aimed at Serbian Peace. Signed on the 29th of September 1919 between Bulgaria and the Allies in Thessaloniki, it ended Bulgaria’s involvement in the First World War. After leaving the army Luigi spent his time lecturing and writing books.\n\nIn July 1920 Teresa’s friend Lady Helen D’Abernon accompanied her husband on the Interallied Mission to Poland which had been organised by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to attempt to influence Polish policy through a change in government, although the Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw made the mission defunct before it could achieve any real importance. Lady Helen D’Abernon also accompanied her husband when he was sent as the British Ambassador to the Weimar Republic in the 1920s.\n\nThe war changed attitudes towards women working. Early in the war women helping the war effort under the auspices of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies were treated with disdain by some people. A friend of Teresa’s sister, Gioconda, wrote after the war that she thinks that the diplomatic service ought to be open to women as well as men, as women are ‘perfectly capable of this kind of work.’\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nOn the 21st of November 1918 Teresa’s acquaintance, Eduardo Di Giovanni, wrote to Teresa that he had met Costanza who said that Teresa was ill. Eduardo wrote that he had heard that Teresa was ‘expected shortly to begin your work again. Are you not too ambitious perhaps for the strength you have? Last summer you seemed very frail, and I thought then that you needed rest. You have done so much already. Why not knock off a bit?’\n\nTeresa’s war efforts are even more admirable given that she suffered from health issues, including frequent severe headaches. Since the war began many had advised her to take it easy but she had valiantly carried on and many were grateful for the efforts that she made in her wartime work. E. V. Lucas wrote in his pamphlet about the British Red Cross in Italy, Outposts of Mercy, ‘the wonderful missionary spirit of our countrywomen was never better exemplified than in the devoted toil of this little band’ established by Mrs Watkins.\n\nThe end of the war meant that Teresa could ‘knock off a bit.’ On November the 3rd the Austro-Hungarians signed an armistice with Italy. The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed as the ruling Habsburgs were overthrown and the armistice was signed by Austria and Hungary as separate countries. By November the 4th the fighting was over in Italy. 400,000 Austro-Hungarians had died and 1,200,000 had been wounded on the Italian Front. Italy had lost a total of around 650,000, with 950,000 wounded.\n\nItaly’s war aims had been to gain contested territory from Austria-Hungary, such as Dalmatia on the Adriatic Sea. The British and French argued that Italy’s contribution to the outcome of the war was limited and many of the territories that the Allies had promised to Italy were never granted, which led to resentment from many Italians.\n\nAs the war ended for Italy Mrs Watkins and Teresa were setting up beds in their new Gardone hospital and caring for some patients who had the Spanish Flu. Eva Williams wrote to Teresa saying that she supposes everyone in the hospital will be rejoicing in the peace news. Soon the wartime outposts established by Mrs Watkins would not be needed. Some photographs in Teresa’s album show the war hospital at San Giovanni Manzano where she had worked. In the images it is possible to see the debris caused by the war which needed to be cleared away.\n\nEva Williams asked if Teresa was still looking after the grey kitten that had been adopted by the nurses. Teresa loved animals and owned many dogs whilst living at Attingham. Photographs show her with Tenace, a black and white French Bulldog who was given to her in 1908 by George Eustis, an American admirer. George Eustis had been traveling to the US via Paris when he purchased the dog and had it sent to Venice. Although she eagerly accepted the dog, Teresa refused George who was later to marry an American lady.\n\nLord Berwick (1877-1947)\n\nThe London Gazette announced on 26th November 1918 that Lieutenant Lord Berwick had been promoted to a Captain in the Shropshire Yeomanry on 28th September and that he was to remain seconded.\n\nLord Berwick was uncertain about when he might be demobilised. He told Teresa on 19th November 1918 that he had ‘unexpectedly received orders to go on special duty.’ He was sent to Fiume (now Rijeka, in Croatia) but it was to be a short posting. He was to return to Headquarters that day because ‘I got other orders just as I was starting to come here.’ He was sorry to leave ‘an attractive sunny place … so soon’ but he hoped to see Teresa when he was back in Italy. However, the following day he discovered that, ‘my sudden recall was due to a telegram from the War Office that I was to report to London at once.’\n\nCoincidentally, Teresa’s next move was to Fiume, where she went with Mrs Watkins to open a recreation hut for Italian soldiers. ‘How I wish you were still there,’ she wrote to Lord Berwick.\n\nLord Berwick travelled to Paris where, in his role as Honorary Secretary to the British Embassy, he helped with the forthcoming Peace talks once the war had ended.\n\nBy early November mass unrest had erupted in Germany and many men in the German Navy mutinied as they refused to engage in battle with the British Navy. On the 9th of November 1918 the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, abdicated and prepared to leave Germany. Germany was declared a republic.\n\nOn the 11th of November 1918 at 5:10 am in a railway carriage at Compiègne, France, the Germans signed the Armistice. This became effective at 11am; the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Fighting continued along the Western Front until precisely 11 o’clock, with 2,000 casualties experienced that day by all sides. Artillery barrages erupted shortly before 11am as soldiers wanted to claim that they fired the last shot in the war.\n\nTotal estimated casualties of all the nations that fought in the First World War were 8.5 million killed and 21 million wounded.\n\nAttingham\n\nOn the 6th of November 1918 Private Ernest Thomas William Luther of the Machine Gun Corps, formerly the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI), died aged twenty as a prisoner of war. He was the son of John and Ann Luther who lived in Uckington, a village near Attingham. His father was a wagoner. Ernest had enlisted in Shrewsbury into the KSLI. He was buried at Saint-Ghislain Hainaut Province Belgium and there is a memorial to him in St Eata’s Church, Atcham.\n\nAnother Shropshire man to die in November 1918 was the poet Wilfred Owen. Born in Oswestry in 1893, he came to live in Shrewsbury in 1907. Wilfred Owen attended the Technical College by the English Bridge and from 1913 to 1915 was teaching at a school in France. He returned to England to enlist into the army.\n\nWilfred Owen died on the 4th of November 1918 crossing the Sambre Canal on a raft. The Second Battle of the Sambre, which began on the 4th of November, was the final Allied attack of the war.\n\nStaff and patients in the war hospital at Attingham were relieved to hear that the war had ended. During the war 38,000 V.A.D. nurses had worked in convalescent hospitals or driven ambulances in Britain. The wartime convalescent hospital at Attingham saw a total of 397 patients admitted, with one death. Attingham Park Auxiliary Military Hospital closed after the end of the War, late in 1918 or early in 1919. In a letter to Lord Berwick in April 1919, Captain Van Bergen, the tenant of Attingham Hall, referred to the hospital as ‘a great boon to the country and county’.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nThe Spanish Flu pandemic had been sweeping the globe since early 1918. Teresa and others called the virus outbreak Spanish Flu because it was mainly reported in Spanish newspapers. It was causing havoc all over Europe but because most European countries were at war with each other reports were suppressed to conceal the impact of the virus on their forces. Spain was a neutral country, not involved in the fighting, so the epidemic was reported in their newspapers giving rise to its association with Spain.\n\nTeresa’s friend Lillian Carlyle wrote to her that some of the people they knew had Spanish Flu, including Christobel the daughter of Evelyn Gordon-Watson with whom Teresa worked at the Italian front.\n\nTeresa suffered acutely when she caught the Spanish Flu and was brought lower than during any of her previous trials during the war. She later admitted in her diary: ‘while I was ill, I heard of the deaths from ‘flu of a number of friends, among whom 5 or 6 young men and girls – and for a time I quite hoped my time had come too.’\n\nMany people whom Teresa’s sister Gioconda was acquainted with had Spanish Flu, including Joan Bentwick who Gioconda worked with as a secretary in the Intelligence Division at the British Admiralty. Fortunately Joan survived. Another acquaintance of Gioconda’s, Miss Heynes, died after only three days of sickness. Gioconda was offered Miss Heynes’s place working in the British Embassy in Rome.\n\nBefore Teresa fell ill she went to meet Mrs Watkins, the leader of the group of war nurses, at Verona. On October the 11th a fellow nurse, Georgiana R. Sheldon, wrote to Teresa from the American Hospital for Italian Wounded: I hope that you will let me know how things have been arranged and whether you and Mrs. Watkins are going directly to Gardone to arrange the convalescent home.’\n\nThe other hospital staff at the American Hospital were leaving but Georgiana stayed: ‘I feel the need of a change more than I can tell you, but, at the same time, I do not think this is the moment to travel, and also I do not like to leave the Hospital when, at any moment, there may be a possibility, although I hope not a probability, of an outbreak of the influenza in our midst. This morning we heard that little Nadine Kirsch has died of it and the boy, Giulio, is very ill indeed.’\n\nGeorgiana appreciated keeping in touch with Teresa, adding humourously: ‘Do send me a card, now and then, and tell me how you are and keep up our spirits here. You must not forget that you have a life of excitement and must therefore stand by the dullards who are here in Florence.’\n\nThe situation for the Italian army was hopeful in October 1918 as they mounted an offensive targeting Vittorio Veneto and broke through a gap near Sacile. On the 24th of October Italian divisions incorporating British, French and American soldiers crossed the Piave River and attacked the four remaining Austro-Hungarian armies.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian defensive line was destroyed with 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers killed and over 400,000 taken prisoner. On the 3rd of November 1918 Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce asking the Italians for armistice. The armistice took effect on the 4th of November 1918 at 3pm.\n\nThe war was almost over and the casualties near the end of the war are poignant. On October the 25th Teresa received a letter from Adolf Keyeux, the Belgian refugee boy who she had helped with his education in England where he had fled in 1914. Adolf had just joined the Belgian Army in the Field. On October the 17th the Belgian King Albert had entered the city of Ostend on the Belgian coast.\n\nTeresa kept the letter, noting that it was found on the body of a dead German officer who had taken it from Adolf who had been killed. The letter is even more heart-breaking because of the cheerfulness with which Adolf writes telling Teresa that ‘we are very heartily welcomed everywhere in our reconquered county’ and went through Bruges just after the Germans left, which felt like ‘a real triumph’ as ‘all the people were out, shouting & cheering us, thousands of flags were flying.’\n\nAdolf adds: ‘You will excuse my writing you such a hurried letter but we are so busy in these times. If we push the Germans back, it is not always without pain. I am now in a post that is what may be termed a ‘good job’ but I have plenty to do. It is often dangerous but always I remain lucky and as I volunteered to see interesting things, I am just in the right place.’\n\nLord Berwick (1877-1947)\n\nTeresa’s future husband, Lord Berwick, was to fall victim to Spanish Flu in December 1918. His time in hospital recovering from the illness prompted him to worry about the fact that he was thirteen years Teresa’s senior. He wrote: ‘when I went into hospital I felt so old and tired and the Drs. made me think that I was not very strong, so that I began to think that it was too late to start life again.’\n\nAttingham\n\nPeople in Shropshire received news of many Allied victories in October 1918. The end of the war was coming into sight. Teresa’s friend Tiny Cox, working in a London hospital, wrote that ‘we are literally working 12 hours a day – considering the heavy fighting & grand news now the casualty lists have been unimpossibly small. I’m to think we may really be without a war in a few months.’\n\nAllied troops renewed their offensive in France, beginning a series of battles that forced the Germans back. The Allies broke through the remnants of the Hindenburg line. The German army retreated and many prisoners were taken.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nBy September 1918 Teresa was again working with Mrs Marie Watkins and her team of nurses helping soldiers on the Italian Front. A letter dated September the 20th 1918 from Mrs Watkins told Teresa: ‘I will wire to you as soon as things are difficult & count on your help.’\n\nTeresa’s assistance was valuable as some of Mrs Watkins’s team were ill. Bridget Talbot was ‘in hospital with Jaundice’ and the soldiers’ canteens she took charge of were closed until she felt well again. Another nurse, ‘Mrs Gordon-Watson is at the hospital at Bordighera convalescing – Lillian Trelawny will tell you all our news. She is a great success here.’\n\nMrs Watkins writes that ‘the ambulance solution is undecided & if the B.R.C. [British Red Cross] don’t provide one I shall try to collect the money + believe I could do so easily.’\n\nShe adds: ‘I shall have to have another uniform made – could you find out if there is a good tailors in our new neighbourhood – say Verona.’ In her next letter she told Teresa to ‘decide if you prefer B.R.C. or the order of St. John – I belong to the latter which is much more interesting historically. The uniform of the former is blue – and the latter black.’\n\nMrs Watkins and her team had begun their war work using their own funds. As these ran low in February 1917 they joined the Joint War Organisation, formed by the combined Red Cross and the Order of St. John, using the organisation’s funds to continue their work. It seems that Teresa had a choice between the uniforms of the two organisations.\n\nOn the 10th of September 1918 Teresa wrote to her sister, Gioconda, from Castel del Piano, Perugia describing her work. This mostly involved dealing with supplies as she had done earlier in the war:\n\n‘Mrs G. W. [Gordon-Watson] was ill all the time and at last General Newlands (R.A.M.C.) who is a friend of theirs heard about it & sent a doctor & an ambulance + insisted upon carrying her straight off to an English hospital partly for nurses at Montecchio near Vicenza – so Christobel + I remained alone for a few days until Mrs Carlyle arrived + I left.’\n\nTeresa was ill herself, suffering from an awful toothache for a fortnight. ‘However, in spite of all these unpleasant accidents it was I repeat very jolly – we had several nice friends who came to see us + brought presents of food, etc., as usual; + we were made much of by everyone.’\n\nTeresa anticipated World War Two when she wrote that the war ‘might easily be very bad for the character; having whole armies at one’s beck + call makes it quite difficult to return to the simple status of one among thousands when one comes back to civilian life again!’\n\nTeresa enjoyed looking at the old buildings and churches in the picturesque town of Perugia where she was staying with four other nurses. She wrote: ‘The country is lovely, olives + cypresses + brown hills & beautiful sunsets.’\n\nTeresa was living in ‘a most charming old villa, rather délabrée for it had been uninhabited for years. However, Anna who is a perfect wonder has managed in a very few weeks to make it very pretty and comfortable. The house is full of pictures, prints & all sorts of pretty furniture, so that she has good material to work with, and there are pretty painted rooms etc. & a long terrace garden with open work brick walls + gates & altogether the makings of a lovely place.’\n\nTeresa added that: ‘My plans for the future are very unsettled but I hope to hear from Mrs Watkins that the convalescent home on the Faccia di Garda is really coming off + in that case I shall join her again very soon.’\n\nShe did manage to get a break from her nursing duties to meet her father in Florence where she went to go shopping and have her hair shampooed.\n\nThe war was going well for Italy. On the 15th of September the Allies pushed the Bulgarians out of Serbia. Italian, French and Serbian troops made rapid gains, advancing nearly twenty miles northwards from Greece in three days.\n\nFamily friend Lady Helen D’Abernon sent a letter to Gioconda who was in Rome. She wrote how strange it was to see German prisoners working in the woods and growing crops. She laments that her estate at Esher Place in Surrey suffered four years of overgrowth and neglect since the war began due to the shortage of staff.\n\nDuring the war 400,000 people left domestic service to enter the armed forces or war production jobs like metalworking and engineering. Of the one million women working in munitions a quarter came from domestic service. Before the war there were few jobs open to women and domestic service was the dominant female occupation.\n\nWealthy families encouraged their menservants to enlist by promising to guarantee an income for their families and to keep jobs open if they returned. Some wealthy households replaced footmen with ‘footgirls’ but most reverted to Parlour Maids. There were female chauffeurs and gardeners. As a result women’s wages increased.\n\nThe war created great social change and the world of domestic service would never be the same. After the war the Berwicks struggled to hire and retain staff for Attingham.\n\nLord Berwick (1877-1947)\n\nLord Berwick had served with the Shropshire Yeomanry as a Lieutenant since before the First World War. On September the 28th 1918 he was promoted to the rank of Captain.\n\nBy the 22nd of September 1918 Lord Berwick had returned to his cipher work in Italy following a visit to Attingham. He wrote to Teresa: ‘I found my home very untidy, the Park overgrown with ragwort and thistles, and the paths round the house non-existent. Also my tenant (who must be an Irish-American) had selected the front lawn as a place to keep an enormous sow and young pigs! He is protecting himself behind the Defense of the Realm Act to get out of most of his responsibilities, feeding the deer, keeping up the vinery and the place in order, in fact the Lease is practically a dead letter, not a satisfactory state of affairs.’\n\nOn his way back to Italy he stopped at Paris, which he found ‘unrecognisable, one is hustled on the pavement by burly and very plain Y.M.C.A. workers, the American twang meets one at every turn, and American lorries crash along the Champs-Élysées. I suppose one must not be ungrateful for this welcome though rather noisy help in the war effort.’\n\nUnfortunately upon getting back to Italy he developed ‘a very high temperature which continued till Friday. I rather foolishly offered to continue my work, as there was no other cipher officer here, it was a great effort and had the effect of prolonging my illness.’\n\nBy the 30th of September Lord Berwick was taken to an Italian clearing station ‘as my temperature was going up again and I could not get proper treatment and food where I was.’ He was transferred to a Base hospital. ‘How I wish I could find myself being handed a cup of tea enroute by yourself, or find you at the Hospital where I am going. But fate seems to be very unkind to us at present.’\n\nThe many long letters that Lord Berwick sent Teresa at this time illustrate their growing attachment in advance of their marriage in June 1919.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nThere were numerous successes for the Italian army fighting along the Piave River delta in early July 1918 with 3,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers taken prisoner. The fighting along the Piave River in summer 1918 marked a decisive turning point in the war in favour of the Italians.\n\nThe Italian victories were welcome news for war nurse Teresa who had feared that her family home in Venice might be destroyed by enemy forces. Her future husband, Lord Berwick, wrote to her pleased to hear news ‘of the Austrian retirement, since when all has gone very well for Italy. I am so glad to think that you need have no further anxiety for your home.’\n\nHowever, there continued to be numerous Italian and Allied casualties and war hospitals along the Italian Front remained busy. Teresa apologised to Lord Berwick for her late reply to his letter: ‘I have been practically living at my hospital, and was too tired to write. Now more nurses have been called in and I have two days rest.’\n\nOn July the 8th 1918 American author Ernest Hemingway was wounded on the Italian Front when he was struck by a mortar shell. He was eighteen years old and was an ambulance driver with the American Red Cross.\n\nErnest Hemingway was handing out chocolate to Italian soldiers in a dugout when he was wounded. He was awarded the Croce di Guerra by Italy for his bravery. Although he was badly wounded himself, he picked up another man wounded by the shell and carried him to the first aid dugout. After the war Teresa was also awarded the Croce di Guerra for her war service as a nurse on the Italian Front.\n\nFrederic Henry, the hero of Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, was also an ambulance driver for the American ambulance corps and many details in the novel are based on Hemingway’s own experiences in Italy. The novel, which centers around Frederic’s love for an English nurse, gives a harrowing account of the retreat from Caporetto.\n\nTeresa’s sister Gioconda remained busy working for the British Military Mission in Rome, journeying in mid-July to Milan.\n\nThroughout Italy the efforts of many people helped pull the country through the war. Teresa’s wartime albums contain interesting images of daily life in Italy. One photograph shows a group of Italian peasants, another shows three girls picking fruit.\n\nLord Berwick(1877-1947)\n\nLord Berwick was travelling in Italy where he was working as a Cipher Clerk. Whilst in a little country town where he was relieving another officer, he visited a silk factory which, he told Teresa, was fascinating: ‘I had no idea that silk in its raw state was so beautiful, though the colour would not perhaps be very becoming, too primitive!’\n\nHowever: ‘It is not very nice here during these hot days, the flies are very troublesome, and one does not get cool nights as one does higher up. I have also been much busier and have little time for reading or writing.’\n\nAttingham\n\nOn the 23rd of July 1918 Percy Richard Heath of Atcham was killed in action aged 23. He was a Lance Corporal in the Machine Gun Corps (Infantry), formerly the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI). Before the war Percy had worked as a waggoner together with his father and three older brothers on a farm near Attingham. In April 1915 Percy had enlisted into the KSLI in Shrewsbury. There is a memorial to Percy in St Eata’s church, Atcham. He is also remembered upon Soissons Memorial, France.\n\nWith thanks to Neil Evans, Shropshire Roll of Honour for the information on Percy Richard Heath.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Marne, the last German offensive of the war, began in France. The Allies began a successful counter attack.\n\nMajor changes were afoot in Russia. On July the 17th 1918 the Bolsheviks murdered the former Czar, Nicholas II, and his family. The country was racked by civil war, disease and starvation.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nPhotographs in the Attingham collection reveal information about Teresa’s life in Italy in June. An Austro-Hungarian offensive launched in June 1918 was resisted by the Italians and marked the culmination of Austro-Hungarian attacks on Italy. On June the 15th, urged by the Germans, the Austrians began an offensive along the Piave River in Italy. They planned to take Venice and destroy the Italian army.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarians crossed the river but they had insufficient supplies to hold their position and had to withdraw. By the 23rd of June the Italians had recaptured all their lost territory and the Battle of the Piave River ended. The Austro-Hungarians suffered massive casualties with 60,000 killed and many wounded or captured. Austro-Hungarian soldiers on the Italian Front began deserting.\n\nTeresa’s wartime photograph albums include pictures of many interesting incidents. In the album of photographs dated May 1916 to August 1918 there is a photograph showing two men parachuting to safety from a military balloon after an enemy attack. Balloons were useful for observation in the war and the first parachutes were used by balloon crews during this time.\n\nLater a photograph shows Teresa about to make a hot air balloon flight near Asolo. Mrs Watkins also had a ride in a balloon. The man who took Teresa up in the balloon was Captain Gallese, the man shown coming down in the parachute. The photograph also depicts an armoured vehicle.\n\nAnother happy time captured in the images is the garden party held for Bridget Talbot in June 1918. Bridget Talbot had worked alongside Teresa doing canteen, nursing and supply work. They remained friends after the war and Bridget visited Attingham when Teresa later became Lady Berwick. Between 1920 and 1922 Bridget Talbot worked in Turkey helping Russian refugees.\n\nTeresa continued to regularly correspond with her future husband Lord Berwick. Following his declaration of his admiration for her in May she wrote to assure him she remains his ‘unchanging friend’ but is worried about discussing her feelings in letters due to them being read by the censors.\n\nLord Berwick replied on the 11th of June: ‘I fear that it is I who have embarrassed you, more than the Censor: if so I am very sorry. What I wrote you after seeing you in Venice was written on no sudden impulse, I tore up many sheets of paper trying to tell you what was so much in my mind. I am not good at self analysis or describing my feelings, but I felt then and still feel for you, after these few weeks of settling down again, so very much more than ordinary friendship, that I felt I must tell you this, and your kind answer gave me great pleasure. In the interval nothing has happened to make me think that I was wrong to tell you this, and I hope I have done nothing to make you think less kindly of me.’\n\nAttingham\n\nA camp for German prisoners of war had been established in Shrewsbury and some prisoners undertook agricultural labour, although it is unknown if they worked at any farms on the Attingham estate.\n\nGerman prisoners were not the only new arrivals. In the latter stages of the war troops from the USA and Canada were stationed in Shropshire. By summer 1918 the American army had become very involved in the war. At the Battle of Belleau Wood troops from the USA experienced significant casualties with 1,811 men killed before they won the wood from the Germans.\n\nSpanish flu began, killing many of the troops already weakened by war. An estimated twenty five million people worldwide died in the epidemic in just six months, more than were killed in the war. Those infected by the flu pandemic in 1918 included British Prime Minister David Lloyd George.\n\nMany people were still doing their bit for the war effort. Princess Mary, the daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, began a nursing course, working at Great Ormond Street Hospital in June 1918. After the war she became Commander in Chief of the British Red Cross Detachment.\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nAlthough the war had brought dramatic changes for Teresa, many aspects of her life went on as they had before the war. In particular, her interest in music persisted. In April 1916 Teresa was invited to a dinner party given by Edith, Countess Rucellai and she was asked to play the piano to entertain everyone as she had often done before the war.\n\nTeresa was a skilled musician and had been trained as a professional concert pianist. At the age of fifteen she became the pupil of the admired Swiss pianist Fraulein Wilhelmina Adler in Munich, Germany. She had to practise for three hours a day and had two piano lessons daily. In 1907 she returned to Venice where she became the pupil of Baron Giorgio Franchetti.\n\nThe Rucellai family, who invited Teresa to play in April 1916, had been friends of the Hultons since before the war. Letters in the archives show that they often sent donations to the war hospitals where Teresa worked.\n\nAs well as donations of items like sheets and bandages, war hospitals needed food supplies for the wounded soldiers. British Red Cross V.A.D. members worked as cooks in British Military Hospitals in places like Genoa, Bordighera, Cremona, Arquata Scrivia and Taranto. On average they prepared and served 40,000 meals per month. Dishes for the recovering soldiers included jellies, broth, custard and chicken soufflé.\n\nFood was prepared for the canteen where Teresa worked at Cervignano by an Italian man, Ernesto. Photographs of him survive in Teresa’s wartime photograph album.\n\nClick here to see a short British Pathé film of a railway station canteen.\n\nClick here to see a film about lunchtime in a hospital in Southport, Lancashire.\n\nTeresa’s uncle, Gino Villari, the half-brother of her mother, begun a new army post in Salonika, Greece. Her father wrote to her giving her Gino’s new address, although he added that he was ‘uncertain as to whether [Gino] will be comfortable in his new post.’\n\nTeresa’s sister, Gioconda, was not enjoying her new job as a secretary in the Admiralty Intelligence Division in London. Gioconda complained that she had not been paid for her work and received few days off.\n\nThe Hulton family were also beset by the worry that the Austrian-Hungarian army would destroy Venice before the end of the war. Teresa’s father, William Hulton, wrote in a letter that he thought it might be a good idea to deposit valuables elsewhere.\n\nLord Berwick (1877-1947)\n\nIn 1916 Lord Berwick was working as an Honorary Secretary to the British Embassy in Paris, but he had kept military books that he bought before and at the beginning of the war when he was in the Shropshire Yeomanry.\n\nOne particularly interesting book is Company Drill Illustrated (1914) which includes illustrations of commands and signals that Lord Berwick would have used in the Yeomanry.\n\nThe book is currently kept in the Inner Library at Attingham Park. Inside it is a paper with a list of questions that a commander should ask himself before attack. This was possibly left as a bookmark by Lord Berwick.\n\nThis book also includes many advertisements. These range from advertisements for pyjamas, a series of military books, coal-tar shaving soap and waterproof clothing to an advertisement for Turkish Baths in London guaranteed to ease illnesses associated with serving in the war.\n\nAttingham\n\nThe Van Bergens, who were Lord Berwick’s tenants at Attingham during the war, were especially concerned for the welfare of wounded soldiers. As well as suggesting that Attingham was used as a war hospital the Van Bergens took a great interest in the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.\n\nMrs Van Bergen was on the Ladies’ Auxiliary Committee whilst Mr Van Bergen was involved with the committee weekly board, the finance committee and the committee for appointing medical staff. The Van Bergens also donated ten guineas to the Royal Salop Infirmary. The Infirmary is now the Parade shopping centre.

They grew WW1 varieties of vegetables and there were even some hens to see!\n\nTeresa Hulton (1890-1972)\n\nTeresa was as busy as ever with supply work for hospitals in Italy. She worked at this task with Bridget Talbot, who wrote asking if Teresa could quickly find some supplies for Hospital 022 as the big new wards of around a hundred beds had ‘got no pillows, very few sheets and no bed covers.’\n\nThe need for rapid expansion indicates the strain that the fighting was putting on war hospitals. Mrs Watkins’s team were run off their feet but it was worthwhile, as Teresa’s friend Julia assured her how grateful the wounded soldiers were for all the work that the nurses were doing for them.\n\nThe heroism of Mrs Watkins’s team is captured by E.V. Lucas in Outposts of Mercy, a pamphlet about the efforts of the Red Cross in Italy written during the First World War. E.V. Lucas visited Mrs Watkins’s team at Cervignano, where he met Teresa.\n\nLucas wrote of the danger that the team faced since Cervignano was ‘a constant target for Austrian aeroplanes.’ The nurses lived in ‘a tiny wooden cottage beside the rail, just big enough for the fires which boil the coffee and milk for the poor fellows in the trains, and anything but big enough for the ladies to dwell in comfort.‘ Photographs show that at this time, compared to later in the war, the uniform and equipment used by Teresa and her companions was basic.\n\nE.V. Lucas gave a vivid picture of the women going about their work:\n\n‘What the soldiers in an English hospital train stopping at a village station in Essex, say, would think of three Italian ladies, unassisted, carrying hot coffee and bread from bunk to bunk along two or three hundred yards of compartments, I cannot imagine; but the grateful Italians have come to look upon the converse phenomenon without surprise.’\n\nThe ministrations of Mrs Watkins’s team were especially useful as ‘the authorities have had to make the meal time-table inflexible, so that a wounded man, brought in just too late for, say, breakfast, would have no chance of food until lunch, even though he had long been fasting.’\n\nTo see a short British Pathé film of a railway station canteen during WWI, please click here.\n\nThe toll that the war had taken on armies of all countries by March 1916 was vast. Many people must have feared that they would be the next to hear the news of a loved one’s death. On the 6th of March Teresa’s friend, Lady Helen D’Abernon, wrote that her nephew had been killed. Already he had been wounded twice since he joined the army and since August 1914, 28 out of the 30 officers in his battalion had died.\n\nFor others, the war brought new opportunities. Teresa’s sister, Gioconda, secured a post as a secretary in the Intelligence Division for the Admiralty in London. On the 27th of March she began her work and was to hold the post for several months, although, as with nursing, she was to find it not to her taste.\n\nLord Berwick (1877-1947)\n\nLord Berwick was working in Paris at the British Embassy in early 1916 but he remained in contact with his Shropshire Yeomanry friends. From the 14th of March 1916 to April 1917 the 1/1st Shropshire Yeomanry was based in Egypt. The order to sail to Egypt was mentioned in a letter to Lord Berwick from H. Heywood-Lonsdale, an acquaintance in the Yeomanry. He wrote to Lord Berwick from ‘Gorleston a most infernal hole where we have had the roof burnt down over our heads.’\n\nHeyward-Lonsdale also described possible future movements:\n\n‘I rather think we shall go to Salonika very soon’ and he hoped that the regiment shall spend ‘next winter in Vienna.’\n\nAnd commented on the war in France:\n\n‘…your appreciation of the Verdun affair is interesting, we have heard 3 of the forts have fallen, hope French are preparing a surprise for the Bosch.’\n\n[For a list of slang terms used at the Front, please click here and scroll to ‘Allies and enemies’.]\n\nLord Berwick’s friend, Heyward-Lonsdale also went on to explain entertainments for the Yeomanry:\n\n‘A paper has been started, run by the Doctor and Guy Rogers THE SHROPSHIRE WAR PAPER on the lines of THE SPORTING TIMES. Poker parties carry on.’\n\nHe thanked Lord Berwick for his letter and informed him that Berwick had a mess bill of £4.7s.11d outstanding.\n\nAttingham\n\nDemand for British war hospitals increased and in March 1916 the War Office took over Cross Houses workhouse, near Attingham, as a hospital. The 321 inmates were accommodated in other workhouses or hospitals. The workhouse was named the Berrington War Hospital due to its proximity to Berrington train station.\n\nThe Attingham and Berrington war hospitals worked closely together. Berrington was the central hospital, acting as a clearing hospital for wounded soldiers. Attingham was one of several auxiliary hospitals that received patients from Berrington. There were over 3,000 auxiliary hospitals in Britain.\n\nWounded soldiers were sent by train to Berrington station. The hospital bell was rung and to alert people at the hospital that there was a train load of wounded soldiers to be collected.\n\nHilda Evans, born in 1902, vividly recalled the first convoy of 127 soldiers arriving at Berrington station. In an oral history recording she explained that initially, there were ‘no nurses here at all, and they had to collect the people round. My mother was one – to help until they got the nurses here. And when they used that awful mustard gas, in the First World War, the poor lads were brought here with great holes burnt in their backs. It was dreadful to see them, dreadful; shocking.’\n\nTo see a 1915 photograph of patients in a gas ward receiving a salt bath treatment for their mustard gas burns, please click here.\n\nHilda Evans also described how the wounded men came ‘straight from the trenches here, because we had to cut their clothes off and they’d be full of lice and all sorts of things. It was dreadful. And they used to make a big bonfire and burn all their old uniforms, because they couldn’t do any good with them.’"
