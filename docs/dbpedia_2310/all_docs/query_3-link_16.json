He hears them willingly, hears them always, and, above all, hears them at Mass.- (Mother Loyola.)\n\n14 'So many people do not trouble to hear Mass on Sundays, when they could easily do so.

Not for this century or generation, but for all generations.- (Fr. J. Rickaby, S.J.)\n\n5 'The Mass renders to God the greatest honour that can be given to Him, it procures the most powerful help for the souls in Purgatory . . . it appeases the anger of God against sinners, and obtains for us the Divine grace in the fullest abundance.- (St. Alphonsus.)\n\n6 'At the hour of death, the Masses we have heard will be our greatest consolation.- (Anon. from St. Saviour's Bulletin.)\n\n7 'It is, indeed, through Christ, with Christ, and in Christ that the sacrifice of the Mass is offered.- (Farnborough Monks in 'The Liturgy.)\n\n8 'At Mass there is offered to the Eternal Farther the very person of Jesus Christ, God and Man.

Faa di Bruno)\n\n19 'Hundreds of sinners will be saved through the prayers that are offered for them in the Mass.- (St. Laurence Justinian.)\n\n20 'We can offer Our Lord to His heavenly Father in the Mass as the Treasure belonging to us, and we shall be generously rewarded for this.- (St. Mechtildis.)\n\n21 'You offer up this sacrifice of propitiation not only for your own sins, but also for those of the whole Christian world, especially for great sinner's.- (Fr. Porter.)\n\n22 We are told, in the life of the holy Superioress of the Rosminian Sisters of Providence (Mother Agnes Amherst), that when there was a question, during her last illness, of choosing between hearing Mass and receiving Holy Communion, 'she would decide to assist at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, notwithstanding her longing desire to be united to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n23 'The Mass ought to be the true devotion of the Faithful, it is their obligation, their Sacrifice . . . in a certain sense they lose their individuality for the time being, and are more than ever members of the Catholic Universal Church.- (Dom Cabrol.)\n\n24 'Mass is an epitome of the life of Christ on earth.- (Fr.

Forster, S.J.)\n\n28 The four ends for which Mass is offered''Adore till the Gospel,\n\n'Give thanks till the bell,\n\n'Till Communion ask pardon\n\n'Then all your wants tell.'(Old Rhyme.)\n\n29 'God . . . receives from the infinite merits of the Mass infinite adoration, infinite thanksgiving, infinite atonement, and infinite petition.- (Father Laurence, O.D.C.)\n\nMARCH\n\n1 'How many Catholics seem to act as if they were sorry to have to go to Mass at all, even once a week.- (Fr. Forster, S.J.)\n\n2 'If Christians knew how to make use of the Mass, what wonders in the spiritual order would come to pass.- (Mgr. Gibergues.)\n\n3 'On Calvary the object of the Sacrifice was to pay the price of the redemption of fallen. man, whilst the purpose of the Sacrifice of the Mass is to apply to each of us individually the treasures of Grace merited and amassed by Christ on the Cross.- (Fr.

Laurence, O.D.C.)\n\n10 'Do not merely pray at Mass. Pray the Mass.- (Pope Pius X.)\n\n11High Mass is the ideal of the Liturgy, and might be called its culminating point.- (Fr. Forster, S.J.) 12 'Alas our praise of God is often very imperfect and worthless. We should, therefore, unite it with the infinitely perfect praise and adoration which our Head and Mediator, Jesus Christ, presents to His Heavenly Father (in the Mass). (Gihr.)\n\n13 'Nothing is so consoling, so piercing, so thrilling, so over-coming, as the Mass . . . it is not a mere form of words, it is a great action, the greatest action that can be, on earth.- (Cardinal Newman.)\n\n14 'Mass is something eminently worth hearing, for its own sake.- (Fr. Rickaby, S.J.)\n\n15 'The average Catholic is too often ignorant of the Church's liturgy, enshrining as it does such a wealth of Catholic doctrine.

Forster, S.J.)\n\n24 'How many Christians assist at Mass without understanding or appreciating its value.- (Mgr.

Rickaby, S.J.)\n\n28 'The daily offering of the Mass would give us . . . a good start to begin our round of duties.- (Fr. Forster, S.J.) 29 'If there is anything in human life absolutely divine, anything that the citizens of Heaven themselves might envy us, that certainly is the Sacrifice of the Mass.- (Pope Urban VIII.)\n\n30 'The important thing in Mass is not what is said, save for the words of Consecration, but what is done by the efficacy of these words.- (Fr.

Forster, S.J.) 5Mass is Christ's dower to the Church . . . it is the soul and life of the entire worship of the Church.- (Fr.

McGlade, S.J.)\n\n21 'It is certainly in and by and through the Mass that we most of all petition the Father in the name of Jesus.

Dignam, S.J.)\n\n30 'Consecration of the Bread alone would be the Eucharist . . . but not the Mass. The Mass requires the mystical slaying of the Victim, and this is done by the separate consecration of the chalice . . . which represents the death of the Victim.- (Fr. M. Scott, S.J.)\n\nMAY\n\n1 After the crucifixion the Mass is 'the greatest event in the history of humanity.- (Georges Goyau.)\n\n2 'There is not a single priestly vestment nor a ceremony of the Mass which does not point to some circumstance of the Passion.- (Fr.

Scott, S.J.)\n\n8 'If we fully realised what the Mass is, we should die.- (The Cure d'Ars.)\n\n9 'The Mass is the united prayer of the Church, and the laity in it, share in a general way in the priesthood of Christ.- (Rev.

Roche, S.J.)\n\n18 'On the Cross the Divinity of Christ was hidden; but His humanity remained. In the Mass all are hidden, both Divinity and humanity.- (Fr. Quinlan.)\n\n19 'Those who neglect to offer up the Mass in word and thought, lose much that they might gain. The due blessing of Mass does not consist merely in being present at It, but in uniting oneself in spirit to the priest, to Jesus Christ Himself '-(St. Francis of Sales.)\n\n20 'When you hear Mass the Sacrifice is your own, a gift from God the Father, as well as God the Son '-(Fr.

Pritchard.)\n\n28The Missal is our book of common prayer': it is The Mass book par excellence. You will never tire of it, so varied are its prayers. You will never regret the outlay in getting one (a Missal); for it makes the Mass yours as nothing else can.- (Fr. McGlade, S.J.)\n\n29 'If you start with a good sign of the Cross, God will help you to hear Mass well.

They remain sitting until they hear the warning bell, at the Elevation itself'(Rev. A. Hickie.) 9 'The words of the Mass, themselves, tell you that you are not present as though you were merely praying to God, but that you are actually joining with the priest, and with Christ Himself, in offering Sacrifice.- (Dr. Sheehan.) 10 'Even if Mass can be omitted without sin, its constant omission has very serious effects on an individual. Through living constantly without aid (of the Mass) people become careless and indifferent, and in this way their Faith grows cold, and they may finally give up the practice of their religion.- (Fr. Lattey, S.J.)\n\n11 'The Mass is the very life of the Church, the secret of her holiness, of her vitality.- (Dr. Sheehan.) 12 'The Mass is the mainspring of devotion, the soul of piety, the fire of charity.- (St. Francis of Sales.) 13 'No wonder that the spirit of darkness should halve inspired heretics with hatred for the Mass, for they knew when they strike the Mass they strike at the heart of the Church.'(Dr. Sheehan.)\n\n14 'In the Mass the Christian family finds its unity, its mutual love and forbearance.
