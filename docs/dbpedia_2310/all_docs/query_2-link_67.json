        "text": "Mrs. Dorothy M. Pickett\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Friday, July 26, 2024, 1:00pm - 7:00pm\n\nRosary: 6:00pm - 7:00pm\n\nLocation: Lakeview Memorial Funeral Home/2102 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Saturday, July 27, 2024, 11:00am\n\nRepose in Church: 10:00am\n\nLocation: St. Mary's Catholic Church/1512 Main Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/426 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nDorothy Mae Owens Pickett was born on February 15, 1935 in Bentonia, MS. Her mother Beatrice Ellis Owens, a skilled midwife, and father W.T. Owens, a well-known farmer, were the proud parents of three sons and two daughters. The Owens instilled in their children at an early age the importance of family and stellar work ethic.\n\nAlongside her siblings, Dorothy applied her work ethic towards mastering many skills including farming, gardening, cooking, and sewing. Her natural born talent and ability to produce excellence heightened her interest in acquiring higher education --and that is where her life’s journey truly began. Dorothy Mae Owens, aka “Dot”, found a love for equipping others with tools of excellence. Her career path was apparent and becoming an educator was her dream. Acquiring her Bachelor’s degree from Alcorn State University in 1961 and a Masters in Education from Mississippi College in 1973, Dorothy’s career in education was in full throttle.\n\nIt was during her educational pursuit that she met the love of her life Mr. Robert Earl Pickett, an Alcorn Hall of Fame athlete and scholar. It would only be a matter of time before Robert asked for Dorothy’s hand in marriage and their beautiful life together began. The Picketts were a dynamic duo. Robert accepted an opportunity on the Mississippi Gulf coast, and in 1957 the couple welcomed their first daughter Deborah Denise. Five years later, the budding family welcomed Ritchie Elyot. It was during this time yet another golden opportunity arose, and the Picketts found their forever home in Vicksburg, MS.\n\nRobert became a well-respected teacher, principal, and superintendent of schools, as well as president of the Hinds Community College Board of Trustees. Dorothy went on to become one of the district’s most popular educators, covering an array of disciplines from Home Economics to Science. During her tenure, Dorothy was proud to witness her beloved Robert be credited with transforming the Vicksburg Warren Public School District into one of the top school districts in the state of Mississippi -- something that Dorothy’s unwavering support made possible.\n\nAfter completing 36 years of service in Education, Dorothy retired from the Vicksburg Warren Public School District, and her impact on thousands of students was apparent. Be it at Kroger, church, or across the country, one was sure to hear, “..that’s my teacher, Mrs. Pickett!” Her sweet, yet direct demeanor was recognized near and far and her beauty, class and sophistication was well-known, cementing her as a pillar in the community. Dorothy was the recipient of many awards and recognized across the state for her dedication and service in Education. She was a member of many civic and social clubs such as the Paramount Social Club, one of her favorites. More notably, she was a charter member of the Vicksburg Chapter of Links, Inc., an American social and service organization for prominent Black women in the United States. Members include prominent women such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Marian Wright Edelman, and the late Betty Shabazz.\n\nIn her later years, Dorothy was blessed to enjoy her retirement with Robert, and was elated to watch her beautiful family blossom. She was able to witness both of her children Deborah and Ritchie marry and have beautiful families of their own, gifting her with 5 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.\n\nShe joins her beloved husband the late Robert E. Pickett, an infant son John; brothers, Fred, McKinley, and John Owens, sister, Christine Shaffer, and parents W.T. Owens & Beatrice Ellis Owens.\n\nShe leaves behind her beloved children Deborah Sanders and Ritchie (Belinda) Pickett; grandchildren Melanie Sanders, Ryan (Ashlee) Pickett, Rashad (Bryanah) Sanders, Kiana Sanders, and Evan Pickett; great grandchildren Ava’Rose, Jade, and Layla; her younger siblings Ernest Carter, Hubert Carter, Ernestine Carter, and Vanessa Carter. In addition to a host of friends and extended family, she will always cherish her beloved caregiver Carolyn Barnes.\n\nDorothy Mae Owens Pickett was blessed to live an incredibly full and beautiful life. Dot enjoyed spending time with her family, gardening, interior design, sewing, cooking, and scrolling through her electronic tablet. She also enjoyed keeping up with friends and family on Facebook, and watching and discussing her favorite reality tv shows. Though she was the epitome of a Southern Belle - beautiful, educated, sophisticated, poised, well- traveled, and kind - she was fearless and unashamed of hard work and sacrifice. She found joy is caring for and loving her family more than anything. To be born into this world and to leave behind a beautiful legacy is undoubtedly the life of a phenomenal woman. Her humble beginnings, love and respect for others, and unwavering faith in God shaped her into the unforgettable icon she was.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMrs. Laura Ann Holden-Lewis\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Thursday, July 18, 2024, 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nFamily Present: 5:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nLocation: Lakeview Memorial Funeral Home/2102 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Friday, July 19, 2024, 12:00noon\n\nRepose in Church: 11:00am\n\nLocation: Trinity Temple Baptist Church/1063 Meadow Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/426 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nNot Just a Small Town Girl\n\nIn the unincorporated community of Cayuga (Hinds County), Mississippi, on October 8, 1949, Joanna Holden and William Douglas welcomed their beautiful daughter to the world and named her Laura Ann Holden. Laura made her debut on a Saturday. Perhaps, her Saturday birth explains the “dancing fever” that seemed to penetrate her bones as she thoroughly enjoyed grooving and “livin’ for the weekend.”\n\nLaura was named after her paternal aunt, Laura Douglas Washington. Yet, the midwife who assisted with the delivery listed Laura’s name as “Lorraine” on her birth certificate and refused to correct the error. Joanna insisted that her daughter be called “Laura” because the name represents a symbol of victory. Laura Ann would later transform into the famous moniker “LauRann.” (phonetically, LA-RANN)\n\nIn John 1:46, the disciple Nathanael asks another disciple, Philip, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael’s question is in response to Philip’s proclamation about THE Messiah,\n\nJesus of Nazareth. How could something so amazing come from Nazareth, a little town with\n\nlittle regard? Small towns are often viewed as boring, with nothing to offer. Well, the small town of Cayuga was instrumental in introducing one of God’s most endearing souls to the world.\n\nWhen Tragedy Transforms Into Tenacity\n\nLaura enjoyed her childhood and she especially loved being a big sister to her younger brother, Curtis Robert Holden. As time passed, Joanna became ill and her illness marked Laura’s earliest childhood memories. Joanna dedicated her time to teaching and nurturing her children. Laura\n\nlearned how to read, write her name, clean and cook rice all by the age of six. Joanna died. Joanna’s death completely transformed Laura’s life. This moment is also the origin story of how Laura became a powerful Prayer Warrior.\n\nLaura and Curtis were cared for and reared by their grandparents, Beatrice Eatmon Holden (Momma Bea) and Henry Holden. It was Henry Holden who taught her the Lord’s Prayer. He instilled in Laura the importance of having a relationship with God. Laura and Curtis were also cared for and reared by their aunt and uncle, Lucy Holden Bingham and Jeremiah Bingham.\n\nThey were her “LuLu and Uncle Jeremiah.” It was Uncle Jeremiah introduced Laura to Bingham Memorial Baptist Church (currently Trinity Temple Baptist Church) and Laura served as an\n\nactive member.\n\nLosing her mother at such a young age allowed Laura to cultivate an incredibly strong bond with Jesus, her Lord and Savior. Laura said God always found subtle, yet profound ways to comfort her and give her the strength to cope with such a tragic happening in her life. Laura once shared a story about one of those comforting moments that happened when she was still a small girl grieving her mother’s death.\n\nLaura spoke about sitting on a bench, feeling very lonely. Out of nowhere, an elderly and kind gentleman carefully and slowly sat on the bench and asked her why she looked so sad. Laura told him that her mother died, and she did not want anyone else close to her to die. According to\n\nLaura, the elderly gentleman had a warm glow on his face and a very welcoming smile. Laura\n\nclaims the gentleman told her that the people who were caring for her and her brother Curt would not leave the earth until she and Curt became adults. Laura says she never informed the elderly gentleman about her brother or the village of people that rallied to care for them. Laura said the gentleman was, indeed, an angel sent to her by God. And, ALL the members of their village lived to see Laura and Curt become adults.\n\nGone with the Wind to Michigan\n\nPrior to beginning middle school, the family left the “country” and relocated to Vicksburg.\n\nLaura’s teenage years were spent on Ken Karyl Avenue with Curt, Rose, Henry and Jackie. Laura enjoyed watching television and most of all DANCING! Laura especially loved her LuLu, who allowed her to stay up late and watch television. Laura loved the film Gone with the Wind and appreciated the toughness of Scarlett O’Hara.\n\nLaura attended Rosa A. Temple High School, home of the Mighty Buccaneers. Laura played basketball and kept the stats for the teams. She made many acquaintances and established life- long friendships. Laura had wonderful mentors such as Mr. Eugene Jackson. Laura was a very industrious person and began after-school jobs at the age of 15. Her first job was working as a dishwasher at the Holiday Inn on Clay Street. Laura worked alongside some of Vicksburg’s finest, such as Robert (Vicksburg’s First Black Mayor, 1988) and Joseph Walker and her good friend, Shirley Diggs.\n\nAs already expressed, Laura loved to dance. There were numerous times when Laura left the house without permission to “spin a record” and “cut a rug” at places like the Kitchen and the Garden. The aftermath of Laura’s escapades incited a very upset Uncle Jeremiah navigating\n\nthrough Marcus Bottom looking for her.\n\nIn May 1968, Laura graduated from Rosa A. Temple High School. According to Laura, she only made the cut because of the help from her good friend, Shirley Diggs (Dr. Shirley Hopkins Davis). After graduation, Laura executed a plan with Shirley to spend the Summer of 1968 adventuring to Michigan. While the exact details of their summer excursion remain “confidential,” it can easily be deduced that they had a “good time.” After their rendezvous, Shirley and Laura returned to Mississippi with Laura headed to Utica Jr. College (currently Hinds Community College) and Shirley attending Jackson State University.\n\nYou’ll Never Find Another Love…\n\nAfter attending Utica Jr. College, Laura earned Associate of Arts (AA) degree in General\n\nEducation in 1970. Laura also attended Alcorn College (later Alcorn State University) for further studies. Later, she attended Vicksburg Community College where she received an AA degree in Secretarial Science around 1972. Laura always enjoyed partying and having a good time.\n\nIn addition to achieving higher education milestones, 1970 marked the year Laura would meet the guy who would change her life, forever. An avid fan of music, Lou Rawls and Barry White\n\nwere some of Laura’s favorite musical artists. One summer evening, while enjoying an outing at the Blue Room, Laura met Hardy James Lewis, Jr. Hardy was known around Vicksburg as “The Hardman.” Of course, Hardy fell hard for Laura’s gorgeous face and pretty smile. According to Laura, he was the most beautiful man she had ever seen in her life. And, the rest, as they say, “was history.”\n\nLaura has always described Hardy as the love of her life. Laura and Hardy’s love story is one of television soap operas and romance novels. Hardy taught Laura how to drive. After getting her driver’s license, Laura worked at the military PX and purchased a custom-ordered, yellow Ford Torino.\n\nTheir relationship faced many challenges and overcame some very painful obstacles. Between 1972 to 1975, Laura and Hardy would lose two children, with one only living for nine days.\n\nThey named him Eric Jerrell Holden Lewis.\n\nOn Friday, April 16, 1976, Laura managed to fall head over heels in love with another guy in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Hardy and Laura welcomed James Leonard Holden Lewis. James stole both their hearts. James was the miracle Laura prayed for, a true blessing from God. The joy James brought to Laura’s life was unimaginable.\n\nAs life happens, things can tend to get a little messy. Laura spent a brief moment in California in 1978, with the hopes of finding a profitable career path. Around 1979, Laura would eventually\n\nmake her way back to Michigan. Laura decided to become a welder and completed all the required certifications. She also assisted her Uncles with their various business. Laura enjoyed her time in Michigan and made several life-long connections with Queen Connerly, the Wilson Family, the Johnson Family and many others.\n\nCan’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\n\nIn 1983, Hardy set out to bring Laura and James back to Mississippi and he accomplished his goal. While their relationship was strained, it was NEVER broken. Laura and Hardy’s connection stood the test of time and distance.\n\nThey moved into a quaint apartment on Robinson Road. Laura worked as an office assistant for Dr. Earnest Rankin. Laura enjoyed being back in Mississippi. She resumed Christian fellowship at Bingham Memorial (Trinity Temple).\n\nAfter deciding to make Jackson their permanent city of residence, Laura and Hardy purchased a home on the corner lot at 4102 Cedar Street in 1984.\n\nDancing Down Cedar Street\n\nLaura enjoyed her family and their new home. In true “Laura” fashion, she continued to advance her career skills. Laura studied Business Administration at Hinds Community College and\n\nreceived an AA degree in 1984. Upon establishing residence in Jackson, Laura became an affiliate member in 1985 under watch care at New Hope Baptist Church, Dr. Jerry Young, Pastor. From a sermon Pastor Young preached, she often repeated: “Pray and Praise.” She internalized and understood well the scripture from II Chronicles 7:14: If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. (NIV)\n\nOn Thursday, September 5, 1985, Hardy and Laura FINALLY got married. Hardy’s father, Rev. Hardie, Sr. performed the service and Mrs. Malissa, Hardy’s mother, stood as their witness. In front of God and family, Laura and Hardy made a covenant before God to become man and wife.\n\nThen, life became even more interesting for Laura. On Sunday, November 3, 1985, Hardy and Laura welcomed a baby girl to the world and named her Angie Malissa Lewis. Marriage, a new house AND a new baby… there was much to celebrate on Cedar Street.\n\nIn 2000, Laura received a Bachelor of Science degree from Mississippi College in Business Administration. Laura’s longest career was in Compliance at Allstate Insurance Company for 16 years. Other professions following Allstate included MS State Tax Commission, Trustmark Bank, and Chickasaw Nation Insurance (CNI – Medicare/Medicaid). From the latter job, she\n\nretired.\n\nAt the recommendation of her Pastor, Laura began serving as a Deaconess at Trinity Temple, serving faithfully as a member for over 40 years. Laura’s spiritual gift is PRAYER. Laura could pray the paint off the walls. She encouraged other to “pray without ceasing.”\n\nOn July 5, 2024, Laura quietly and peacefully transitioned from this life and went to be with our Lord.\n\nLaura was preceded in death by her husband, Hardy Lewis, Jr.; her son, Eric Jerrell Holden Lewis; her parents, Joanna Holden and William Douglas; her maternal grandparents, Henry Holden and\n\nBeatrice Eatmon Holden; her sisters, Rose Bingham and Mattie Douglas Wilson; her brother, William Douglas, Jr.; maternal aunts, Annie Stewart White and Lucy Holden Bingham (and Lucy’s husband, Jeremiah Bingham, who raised and cared her Laura); maternal uncles, Leonard Stewart, Frank\n\nStewart and John Wesley Holden; paternal uncle, Robert Douglas; paternal aunts; Amanda Douglas Jackson and Laura Douglas Washington; and her grandson, Erik Hardy Lewis Hargro.\n\nTomorrow is Another Day!\n\nLaura leaves to cherish her beautiful life:\n\nChildren:\n\nJames Leonard Holden Lewis (Maxine Golden) of Jackson, Mississippi\n\nJames’ Children\n\nJerry Fisher Green of Santa Ana, California\n\nJamelyn JoAnn Angelique Walker of Jackson, Mississippi\n\nJamelyn’s Children - JaSummer Shardavia Jackson and JaNoah Caleb Walker\n\nAngie Malissa Lewis of Jackson, Mississippi\n\nAngie’s Children\n\nReginald K.

He was the son of the late Howard Hall and Lena Mae Smith. His mother passed away when he was an infant, and he was raised by his grandparents, the late Calvin and Mayr Tyler Smith.

Temple High School, Class of 1965.

He accepted Christ as his savior in 1957 at Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church under the leadership of Reverend J.R. Bingham. He was a dedicated and faithful member of Bingham Memorial Baptist Church, now Trinty Temple Baptist Church, where he served in various capacities, including a Deacon, member of the Benevolent Ministry, male chorus, and Sunday school. He also served as chairman of the board of deacons, president of the Baptist Training Union (BTU), and was involved with the usher board. Additionally, he participated for many years in the Progressive State Convention.\n\nHe was united in holy matrimony to Mary Helen Burns, and to this union, two children were born. A loving husband, father and “Pa-Pa”, Robert worked tirelessly to provide for his family, ensuring his children and grandchildren received a great education.\n\nRobert dedicated much of his time to caring for the elderly, visiting and ministering to nursing home residents, and was known for his ministry in song throughout Vicksburg. He supported his family, offering advice and bringing laughter to difficult situations. He cherished spending time with his family and was renowned for his exceptional barbecue ribs. He retired after 45 years of hard work and service with Interstate Brands, Inc.

The oldest of eight children (with three brothers and four sisters), she was a model matriarch of the Eastman family. Sarah was known for her quiet, calm, peaceful demeanor and had a heart of gold. Her beautiful smile, welcoming spirit and warm hugs made everyone feel loved and special. Although Sarah wasn’t rich by the world’s standards, whatever was placed in her hands or care,\n\nshe always found a way to multiply it and make it better. Sarah’s quiet strength and determination led her to overcome many challenges and obstacles in life. That strength, determination and perseverance is the legacy that she leaves to her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. One thing is for certain, to know her was to love her.\n\nSarah spent her early years in the Yokena and LeTourneau communities. She received her early education at Cedars Elementary School and Bowman High School in Vicksburg, Mississippi. She would later go on to receive her associate’s degree in early childhood education from Holmes Community College. Sarah, along with several other educators in the community, believed greatly in the need for early education for young children of color (to level the playing field with their Caucasian counterparts). Thus, she worked as a volunteer for an entire year as a HeadStart teacher with Mississippi Action for Progress (MAP), before beginning a 37-year career with them as a Lead Teacher and Home Teacher. Sarah was loved by her students and parents, which often led to there being a waiting list for children being placed in her classroom. Her passion for education was undeniable.\n\nSarah confessed Christ and was baptized at an early age at Mt. Givens Missionary Baptist Church, where she has served in various capacities. She sang in the choir, was the Church Secretary, Adult Sunday School teacher, Sunday School Superintendent, and in her later years was a devoted Mother of the Church. Sarah loved Mt. Givens and the Mt. Givens family loved her. In addition to her service at Mt. Givens, she was a faithful member of Old Come and See Missionary Baptist Church, where she was loved immensely. She also regularly attended Providence Missionary Baptist Church and El Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. Her service to God and to the House of God was something she took great joy in doing.\n\nSarah was united in holy matrimony to the late Pastor Erwin S. Cosey, Sr. on October 4, 1957, in which they remained devoted to one another for 63 years. To this union was born eight children. However, Aunt Sarah and Uncle Lil Man’s house (as they were affectionately called) became the house for every niece and nephew in the neighborhood. Even the grandchildren would come to Granny’s and Paw Paw’s and never wanted to leave. Sarah created a home that was always filled with good food and snacks, lots of love, and tons of laughter.\n\nPreceding her in death are her husband, Pastor Erwin S.

African Americans weren't allowed in hospitals, and as a result his paperwork was delayed, and his legal date of birth was recorded as March 12, 1933.\n\nClarence was raised on a farm. They had chickens, goats, and horses. He picked strawberries and cotton at a young age. His father passed away when he was three years old. He had to work and help mama with the bills.

When he got older, he worked inside and was responsible for pouring the Coca-Cola syrup into the soda. He also worked for Magnolia Trailers.

Together they had five children and later divorced in June of 1979. Clarence moved out west to Portland, Oregon in the 1960's in search of a better way of life. There were more opportunities for Black men to make more money working on the railroads and Black women to become nurse's aides and later nurses. He worked more than thirty years at ESCO, an electric steel foundry in Northwest Portland as a fitter. He also fathered three more children.\n\nClarence gave his life to Christ at an early age and his family church growing up was Travis Chapel AME. He later became a parishioner of Holy Redeemer Church in Portland, Oregan until his passing.\n\nAnyone who knew Clarence knew he loved football and enjoyed watching a good football game (although baseball was his first love). His favorite college teams included Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Grambling University. He was entertained during the halftime shows watching the marching bands and the drum majors \"get down\" on the football field. Clarence had a sweet tooth. He loved a good 7up cake that Shirley would bake and mail him. You could often find him nibbling on chocolate chip cookies, Oreos, a Mr. Goodbar, a chocolate Hershey bar or chocolate covered pecans from Minsky Pecan Market out of Lake Providence, LA. Clarence kept an appetite for hot tamales paired with an ice- cold Dr. Pepper or a ginger ale. He could eat a half dozen by himself. He loved fresh, hot, fried catfish, tripe, lamb chops, collard greens, buttermilk, and goat milk. Music was a favorite for him, his genre was \"The Blues.\" He enjoyed artists like Elmore James, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland and ZZ.

Adams Street, South Bend, IN.\n\nFuneral Services: Thursday, March 30, 2023, 12:00noon\n\nLocation: Greater St. John Missionary Baptist Church/101 N. Adams Street, South Bend, IN.\n\nInterment: Private\n\nOur Son, brother, uncle, cousin and friend, Kenneth Kynard Woods Adams was born to Ms. Bettie C. Woods Starling and Mr. Willie Adams March 6, 1973 in Oxford, Mississippi. Kenneth was affectionately known as “Red.” Great men and women are only born for the time that they are needed most, and surely his presence on this Earth has touched lives and transformed places around him.\n\nIn 1976, the family relocated to South Bend, Indiana while Kenneth was at the tender age of three.\n\nKenneth accepted and confessed his faith in Christ during his adolescent years. In obedience to God’s word, Kenneth was baptized at Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of Pastor Reverend Hardy Petty.\n\nKenneth received his formal education in the South Bend Public School system. He received his high school diploma from LaSalle High School in 1991. Kenneth went on to attend Indiana State University with a concentration in Communications. While attending Indiana State University, he was initiated as a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, the “Alpha Zeta” Chapter in the spring of 1993 K.S.4. Shades of Red.\n\nKenneth enlisted in the United States Army Reserves in 1991and served for several years. He proudly served as a Material Storage and Handling Specialist. As we all knew, he had the heart to serve, from the field to the community. During his military career he used his hard work ethic, education, and professionalism to gain his Ribbon of Recognition for his Army Service.\n\nKenneth took pride in caring for his loved ones, as well as himself. He worked many years as a talent acquisition. He adapted a skill set and passion in culinary arts. Everyone that knew Red was aware of his love for cooking and love for Kappa Alpha Psi, Incorporated. He took pride in his cooking abilities. His passion and vision for food service pursued him to launch his own catering business Kuisine by Ken. He had an eye for detail and took pride in his plating arrangements. Kenneth never turned down a challenge or an obstacle. Perhaps, his last challenge would be to answer God’s call into Glory. It seemed as if the last challenge would be impossible; a challenge that has shaken the very core of those left to remember him. Red accepted the challenge in which he DEFEATED HIS LAST EMEMY: DEATH. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. (I Corinthians 15:26KJV). All to life is to live and all the death is not to die, but a life without purpose has no hope and no end.\n\nKenneth departed his earthly home to rejoice in his heavenly home on Monday, March 20, 2023 at 10:30 p.m. surrounded by his loved ones, friends, and fraternity brothers. He was met at the heavenly gates by his grandparents: Cliff and Ruth-William Woods, Marion Roosevelt and Ruby Marzette Adams; his aunts and uncles, Johnnie Mae Woods, Stanley Woods, Willie and Bernice McEwen, Robert and Lula Ladmirault, James and Yvonne Adams, Mattie and Nathan Hodges, Inez and Jerry Nolls.\n\nKenneth leaves to cherish his fond and precious memories his mother, Bettie Woods Starling (Murray, preceded in death) South Bend, IN; his father, Willie Adams (Emma) Jackson, MS; his brothers, Michael Woods, (Savannah, GA); Kevin Adams (Houston, TX), and; Christopher (Mieko) Paige of Saint Johns, FL; and his special friend Charles Grant (Chicago, IL).

She accepted Christ at an early age and joined Yeager Street Church of God in Vicksburg.\n\nWhile attending Vicksburg High School, Nada participated as a color guard in the VHS marching band and graduated in 1972. She went on to attend Albany State University in Albany, Georgia where she studied Education. While living in Georgia, she met the love of her life, Melvin C. Sykes of Madison, Arkansas. They later married on March 31, 1979 and settled down in Brunswick, Georgia. In 1981, they started their family with their first son Kyle Anthony and two years later Kevin Charles. After relocating to Vicksburg in 1984, their family was complete with the birth of their third son Matthew George. For 33 years, Nada was a devoted wife to Melvin until his death in 2012. She was a wonderful mother who adored her boys and was extremely proud of them.\n\nNada had over 40 years in retail service and management. She was a store manager of Shoe City and Corning Revere in the outlet mall. Towards the end of her career, she worked at Home Depot and Porter Paints in Vicksburg.\n\nNada loved life and enjoyed spending time with her grandchildren and family. She always had an open-door policy welcoming anyone who happened to stop by. For many years, her home served as a gathering place for all family celebrations. She had a wonderful sense of humor and knew how to have fun. Having a heart of gold, Nada believed in helping her family and friends…..no questions asked. She was incredibly thoughtful and made sure to remember everyone’s birthday.\n\nShe loved the Lord and was a faithful member of Word of Faith Christian Center until her health began to fail. Several Sundays throughout the year she served as a greeter, greeting people with her beautiful, dimpled smile as they entered the church. She also loved working with children and often volunteered in the church’s nursery as well. To better understand the bible, Nada participated in a two-year course in Laymen’s Bible Study offered by the church, eventually graduating in 2015.\n\nDuring her illness, Nada’s faith never wavered. Every morning at 5:30 am, she along with her sisters had morning prayer. She made sure to send daily texts of the Daily Bread readings to her family and friends. Her favorite bible verse, “Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep His promise”, Hebrews 10:23.\n\nOn Saturday December 10, 2022, she made her transition surrounded by her sisters in Vicksburg, Mississippi. She is preceded in death by her parents, sister Rosa, brother Clarence, her husband Melvin, and mother-in-law, Charlene Sykes.\n\nShe leaves to celebrate her beautiful life: her three sons, Kyle (Mackee) Sykes of Pearl, MS, Kevin (Rhonda) Sykes of Calera, AL, and Matthew (Chavonn) Sykes of Vicksburg, MS: sisters, Arie Glenn (Wendell) Prejean of Spring, TX, Ruby Jeneen (Bobby) Williams, Jerre Sims of Vicksburg, MS and Renee Tillman of Jackson, MS; four brothers George (Marie) Gibson of Dallas, TX, Harold (Elaine) Gibson of Columbus, OH, Anthony (Marion) Gibson of Vicksburg, MS and Joseph (Valeria) Tillman of Jackson, MS; four in-laws: Ralph (Donna) Sykes of Los Angeles, CA, Sherrye Blakely, Shirley Ingram, and Iris Williams of Madison, AR; five grandchildren, Preston Isaiah, Kaden Charles, Carter Charles, Mikayla Yvonne and Bailey Grace as well as a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMrs. Mary E. Griggs\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Friday, September 16, 2022, 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nFamily Present: 5:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nLocation: Lakeview Memorial Funeral Home/2102 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Saturday, September 17, 2022, 11:00am\n\nRepose in Church: 10:00am\n\nLocation: Travelers Rest Baptist Church/718 Bowmar Avenue, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/326 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nIn the heart of the Delta, Mary Elizabeth Griggs was born in Wilmot, Mississippi in August 1931. For over half of her life, Mary celebrated her birthday on August 12—the date she believed to be her birth date. Many years later, Mary obtained an official copy of her birth certificate to discover that her recorded birth date was August 31, 1931.\n\nMary proudly lived her entire life in the state of Mississippi. From a very early age, she lived a life of service and devotion to others. A theme she would carry throughout her entire life. At various times, Mary took on the role of caretaker for members of her family. In 1952, Mary took on the role of her life – giving birth to her only child, Johanna, whom she loved and cherished - caring for her as she always would until her untimely death in June 2022.\n\nWith a high school education, Mary achieved greatness! She eventually began a career with the Vicksburg Public Schools as a cafeteria line worker. In early years, she also worked as a domestic worker for two families who each grew to love her as if she were a part of their own families. During her tenure at Vicksburg Public Schools, Mary worked her way through the ranks in various positions until she achieved the role of Lead Baker. Everyone coming through the cafeteria—teachers and students alike – were happy to say they had a cake baked by “Ms. Mary.” She loved her position and loved serving the students and teachers who came through her line each day. As she did with many things in her life, she took great pride and dignity in her work.\n\nMary retired from the Vicksburg Public Schools as a cafeteria worker after an esteemed 40+ year career. Although she retired, Mary continued her love of cooking and serving others. One of her greatest joys was baking cakes for friends, family, and loved ones! For a time, if you ever came through the Mississippi Welcome Center, chances are you enjoyed a cookie that she baked. Mary was a long-time member of the Cedar Grove Homemaker’s Volunteer Club.\n\nMary accepted Christ at an early age. In the early years, she was a member of Shiloh Baptist Church. Later in life, she joined Travelers Rest Baptist Church and was a member there for more than 30+ years. She loved her church and her church family dearly. During her many years at the church, Mary sang in the choir and took part in countless church programs and festivities. Over the years, Mary relished in cooking nearly every Easter dinner for the late Pastor Thomas Bernard and his family. She was a faithful servant who steadfastly believed in God’s word until her last days.\n\nMary loved music, reading the Vicksburg Evening Post, bargain shopping, and, of course, baking from scratch and cooking delicious meals for others. She was a fiercely strong and independent woman. When she made up her mind about something, good luck convincing her otherwise. She carried her own luggage (despite multiple attempts to stop her) and mowed her own large yard well into her 80s. Most of all, Mary loved her family – especially her daughter Johanna, with whom she shared a very special bond. Mary left an everlasting impression on anyone she met. A caring, warm, spirit that offered kindness and love to all who knew and loved her. She leaves behind a legacy of grace, strength, inspiration, service, and love.\n\nMary was preceded in death by: her parents, Bessie Whitfield and Robert Griggs; her siblings – brothers, Robert Griggs, Willie Griggs, Shedrick Griggs, and Ernest Griggs, and her sister, Bessie Griggs Kennedy (George); and her beloved daughter, Johanna Griggs Sampson Jones (Delbert).\n\nShe leaves to cherish her memory and legacy: her two grandchildren, Angela Sampson Allen (Leslie) and Mark Anthony Jones; two great grandchildren, Grayson Allen and Brayden Jones; her brother, Charlie Griggs (Lorraine); her nieces, Frances Kennedy Cowan (Fred) and Arbria Tillman; a nephew, George Kennedy, Jr. (Doris); the Jones Family, whom she treated as her own, complete with bonus grandchildren and great grandchildren; long-time neighbors, Austin and Ann Butler; and a host of cherished extended family members.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMr. David Jones\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Sunday, August 28, 2022, 1:00pm - 2:00pm\n\nLocation: Vicksburg City Auditorium/901 Monroe Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Sunday, August 28, 2022, 2:00pm\n\nLocation: Vicksburg City Auditorium/901 Monroe Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/326 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nOn May 12, 1951, inside the city limits of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on Halls Ferry Road, the Late Cornelius and Mary Jones welcomed a 10 pound 8 ounce son and they would name him…David Lee Jones. David was the youngest of seven children and grew up in a God fearing home. He accepted the Lord at an early age, and was baptized at Porter’s Chapel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nDavid graduated from Rosa A. Temple High School in 1969, which was one of the last all black classes before desegregation. He was active in school, singing majestically in the school choir and found favor among his friends being voted “neatest male” by his fellow classmates.\n\nDavid served in the United States Navy. Upon his return, he married his high school sweetheart, Frances. In 1972, a few hours after their wedding, the two left Vicksburg and headed North to Aurora, Illinois, where they would reside for the next 50 years. In May of 1974 the two would give birth to their only child, Makeba Jones-Campbell.\n\nDavid joined Gayles Memorial Missionary Baptist Church and participated in the choir. One of his noteworthy solos was “Jesus is love”. He was instrumental in changing the bylaws to allow youth to participate in the adult church choir. In later years David joined Main Street Baptist Church and served as an Usher.\n\nDavid was an avid reader and loved to recite poetry. One of his favorite excerpts was “Black is” by the Last Poets. David was a graduate of Wabonsee Community College and held many super-visory positions. From making Garbage bags and Dial soap, to ice cream sandwich cakes to cool you on a hot summer day. He spoke fluent Spanish and for many years operated his own janitorial service called “Domestic Engineers”. One of David’s most notable job titles was that of bailiff. He loved to introduce the judges and commanded attention with his deep baritone voice when he would say “All Rise……Court is now in session.”\n\nDavid loved to sing and his house was always filled with music. He had a plethora of albums ranging from Beethoven to James Brown. His love for music was strengthened as a DJ for a local radio station in Aurora. He often dreamt of doing voice over work for radio commercials and television.\n\nDavid enjoyed sports cars (the smaller the better), playing golf, taking pictures, sailing, car races, watching current events, sports and talking on the phone for hours with his siblings and childhood friends.\n\nDavid was a natural comedian and great story teller. He could imitate absolutely anyone, and tell jokes that would have you laughing for days. David loved nature and animals. He could train a dog better than any dog trainer and loved feeding birds and squirrels. He was an unofficial horticulturist and had an undeniable green thumb.\n\nIf say it loud I’m black and I’m proud was a person, it would look like David Lee. He would recite: “Black is the velvet of the midnight sky Black, is so beautiful it makes you cry. Black is short, Black is tall, let me just say that Black is all. And this is not all I have to find, I also found that black is mine.” He was an activist in his own right, participating in the million man march on Washington, and bringing awareness to the social injustices that so often plagued the black community.\n\nDavid was loving and kind, but one thing was certain, you were NOT going to disrespect him. If by chance you thought you could, trust and believe you would feel it, hence the nickname “knockout”.\n\nDavid loved his family and never missed an opportunity to tell them how much he loved them. He loved spending summers and holidays with his grandchildren, playing checkers, reading, and creating memories.\n\nDavid loved his home town of Vicksburg and was anxiously awaiting his return home. On August 16th, 2022 at approximately 7:59 a.m., God’s angel took charge of the final chapter of his life. His loving wife and daughter were at his side as his daughter sang him into eternity. God moved in his mysterious way and brought David Lee Jones home to glory.\n\nDavid was preceded in death by: his father and mother, Cornelius and Mary Jones; one sister, Rosetta Phillips Mitchell; three brothers, Darnell Jones, Curtis Jones, and Arthur Jones.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memory: his loving wife, Frances Jones; his daughter, Makeba Jones-Campbell (Corby); his three beautiful grandchildren, Taelah Majee’ Campbell “Prettines”, Coyia Demetris Campbell “Chubbs” and Jaloni Devon Campbell “Knucklehead”; his sister, Beatrice Totten of Justice, Illinois; his brother Cornelius Jones Jr. (Gloria), of Aurora, Illinois; special brother-n-law, Percy Shorter “me-me”; and a host of nieces, nephews, god-children, family, friends and classmates.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMs. Cassandra D. Jones\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Friday, July 1, 2022, 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nFamily Present: 5:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nLocation: Lakeview Memorial Funeral Home/2102 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Saturday, July 2, 2022, 1:00pm\n\nRepose in Church: 12:00noon\n\nLocation: Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church/3300 Grange Hall Rd, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/326 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nOn February 23, 1974 a star was born to the late Hattie Mae Washington Wilson and Avery L. Harris. Cassandra, who was celebrity- status in her mind, was often referred to by her friends as ‘Hollywood San’. Although her family acknowledged her pseudo-celebrity status, we affectionately referred to her as just ‘Sanda’. She was baptized at the age of 12 at Saint John Missionary Baptist Church in Yokena, Mississippi. She later attended Family Life Cathedral before her departure from Mississippi.\n\nSanda was raised in Vicksburg, Mississippi by her grandparents and grew up alongside many of her aunts, uncles, and cousins. Because they were raised together, Sanda was more like a little sister to her aunts and uncles instead of a niece. She essentially took the spot as the baby of the family, getting all of the attention and being spoiled by her grandparents. That’s probably where her stardom mentality was born.\n\nShe graduated from Vicksburg High School where she was a trackstar and known for the 100-meter dash hurdles. She also played the clarinet in the VHS “Pride” Marching Band. She later attended Hinds Community College where she was a member of the Bulldogs Cheer Squad.\n\nSanda moved to New Orleans, Louisiana where she was a valued employee for The City of New Orleans First City Court Evictions Department. She proudly took her Oath of Office as Deputy Clerk. Her coworkers all loved her and described her as ‘always having a smile on her face.\n\nOne of Sanda’s greatest roles in the movie of her life was definitely ‘Mother’. Sanda loved her daughters Akila, Jaylan & Jania more than anything. Each one of the girls had a special bond with their mother. Sanda enjoyed Facetiming, shopping, and cooking for her daughters. On the weekends, they would have a “Chick-Fil-LALA Day” where Sanda would make homemade chicken sandwiches - mild and spicy - and yell out “come get your Chick-Fil-LALA”. Akila later gave Sanda one of her greatest gifts and the person she was willing to share her spotlight with, a grandson named Karson. Karson was Sanda’s little prince and she was his queen. She would often say “I look good for a grandmomma, don’t I?” Nobody had to toot her horn because she tooted it herself. Sanda may not have received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but she was definitely a star to everyone in her life. Her Earthly light was dimmed on June 27, 2022.\n\nIn addition to her mother, Cassandra was preceded in death by her grandfather Little D. Petties, Sr., brother Derrick Funches, aunt Gladys Richards, grandparents Arthur and Pauline Harris.\n\nShe leaves to cherish her memories: her daughters, Akila Jenkins, Jania Blount and Jaylan Blount, all of Jackson, Mississippi; her father, Avery (Glory) Harris of Vicksburg, Mississippi; her grandmother, Mary Petties of Vicksburg, Mississippi; her grandson, Karson Quinn of Jackson, Mississippi; four sisters, Cheryl Wilson of Utica, Mississippi, Terrie Wilson of Jackson, Mississippi, Domenica Graham and Averianna Harris both of Vicksburg, Mississippi; three brothers, Billy Ray Wilson, Jr. of Edwards, Mississippi, Charlie Griffin and Terrence Harris both of Vicksburg, Mississippi; six aunts, Loriene Lyons of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Cleo (Larry) Thomas of Lewisville, Texas, Priscilla (Darryl) Smith of Natchez, Mississippi, Ramona (Glennard) Warren and Brenda (Lenny) Smith both of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Tracey (Kenneth) Davis of Hockessin, Delaware; two uncles, Little D. Petties, Jr. and Otis Petties both of Vicksburg, Mississippi; two step-children, Madison Blount and Deondrea Burks both of Jackson, Mississippi, and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends including Edward Petties, Anthony Petties, Jerry Blount, Howard Jenkins, the Brown, Harris, Petties,, Washington and Dee families.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMrs. Johanna Sampson Jones\n\nArrangements are as follows:\n\nVisitation: Thursday, June 23, 2022, 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nFamily Present: 5:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nLocation: Lakeview Memorial Funeral Home/2102 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nFuneral Services: Friday, June 24, 2022, 11:00am\n\nRepose in Church: 10:00am\n\nLocation: Triumphant Baptist Church (Kings Community)/224 RL Chase Circle, Vicksburg, MS\n\nInterment: Cedar Hill Cemetery/326 Lovers Lane, Vicksburg, MS.\n\nJohanna Griggs began life’s journey on September 11, 1952. She was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi to Mary Elizabeth Griggs and the late Joseph T. Bingham, Sr. Johanna was named after her great- grandmother, Johanna Whitfield, and would often take extra care to ensure her name was spelled and pronounced correctly. She grew up in Vicksburg and was a very proud member of the Rosa A. Temple High School Class of 1970. In high school, she was a conscientious student who excelled academically and participated in school activities like chorus and drama.\n\nAfter high school, Johanna attended Southern University for three years, majoring in Psychology. While at Southern, she continued her history of academic excellence with an induction into the 1972 Psi Chi Chapter of the Psychology National Honor Society. During her time in college, she met and married Harold Loyd Sampson. To this union, a daughter was born – one she already knew she would name Angela, after one of her\n\nfavorite soap opera characters. For the next 13 years, Johanna set the bar high by demonstrating an example of a hard-working single parent to Angela – showing her daughter firsthand how to be a strong and independent woman of class.\n\nIn 1986, Johanna married her fellow high school classmate, Delbert (“Bubba”) Jones. To this union, a son, Mark Anthony Jones, was born. From the day he was born, she forever cherished Mark and spent many hours praying over the life of her “baby” boy. Johanna also became a “bonus” Mom to Maurice, Daphne, and Latrisha—showing them each a love that far exceeded the role of stepparent. She also became part of a large extended family legacy, gaining new sisters and brothers “in love.” Johanna and Delbert were married for 35 years until her passing. She was the yen to his yang. Often when asked any questions about the household, Delbert’s reply was simply “ask Johanna.” Through life’s ups and downs, Johanna remained a steadfast, loyal, and devoted wife to Delbert.\n\nWith love and devotion, Johanna raised her children with Delbert in Vicksburg until the family moved to Woodbridge, Virginia in 1989. She would remain in Virginia for 22 years before returning to Vicksburg. Johanna lived the remainder of her life in her beloved hometown, re-establishing special connections with friends and classmates. Connections that she truly cherished.\n\nJohanna accepted Christ at an early age. She was an active member of Bingham Memorial Baptist Church (Mississippi) and later at Mt. Olive Baptist Church (Virginia). She was an active member of the church choir, with a voice that was able to sing both alto and tenor. At Mt. Olive, she was an active member of the Women’s Ministry and went on to become a deaconess. Throughout her life, she always believed in the power of God and trusted in His word and His power.\n\nJohanna loved music, her Alexa, bargain shopping, and she had a strong knack for decorating. She collected black artwork and figurines and often decorated around the holidays, especially her favorite time of year, Christmas.\n\nEarly in her career, Johanna was a HeadStart Program teacher at Ken Caryl. She later moved into the field of real estate and property management where she remained for the majority of her professional career. She ultimately retired after a career in retail management.\n\nJohanna was affectionately known as “Johanna”, “Joanne”, “Jo, “Mama”, “Mama Jo”, and “Nana” by those who loved her. She was the glue – the foundation and center of her family. Above all else she loved her family, especially her Mom, with whom she shared a cherished and unbreakable life- long bond. Johanna also had strong and lasting bonds unique to each of her children, with the gift of being able to offer each of them just what they needed. With her personality, spirit, and that rich powerful voice many loved to hear, she touched the hearts of those that she encountered throughout her life. It was easy to see and feel the shine of her beautiful light in this world.\n\nJohanna was preceded in death by her father, Joseph T. Bingham Sr.\n\nShe leaves to cherish her life and precious memories: her husband, Delbert M. Jones of Vicksburg; her mother, Ms. Mary E. Griggs of Vicksburg; her daughter, Angela Sampson Allen (Leslie) of Sterling, Virginia; her son, Mark Anthony Jones of Woodbridge, Virginia; stepdaughter, Daphne Johnson (Jamaal) of Natchitoches, Louisiana; stepson, Delbert Maurice Jones of San Diego, California; stepdaughter, Latrisha Washington of Biloxi, Mississippi; seven grandchildren, Grayson Allen, Brayden Jones, Devin Jones, Jayden Johnson, Jada Johnson, Delarrius Deere Jr., and Jordyn Washington; her brother, Joseph (Carolyn) Bingham, Jr. of Vicksburg, Mississippi; her uncle Charlie (Lorraine) Griggs of Chicago, Illinois; brothers and sisters-in-law, Lula M.

He also attended Jackson State University for 2 years.\n\nBennie enlisted later in the United States Army, receiving numerous medals and company rank of 1st Sergeant, and was serving as Master Sergeant before retiring.
