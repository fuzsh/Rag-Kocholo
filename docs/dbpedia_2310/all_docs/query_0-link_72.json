The moon was just on the wane and anyone on deck would have made out quite easily the silhouette of the Rock and the dim flicker of lights in the town. Bishop Henry Hughes, the Vicar Apostolic, was returning to Gibraltar. Amongst the other passengers aboard the “Royal Tar” was a group consisting of “a servant and five nuns”.\n\nThe ship had left Southampton eight days earlier with a consignment of\n\n“hams, bacon, cheese, rounds of corned beef, Dorset butter in crocks, fresh ditto in half-pound prints…”\n\ntogether with\n\n“porter and ale in quart and pint bottles, sherry in wood, claret…”\n\nand a variety of other goods, all of which were proudly advertised in the Chronicle a few days later as being on sale at Mr James Speed’s shop in Waterport Street. English people in Gibraltar would be buying their hams for Christmas; Gibraltarians, mainly descended from Genoese, had different Christmas traditions.\n\nAlthough the “Royal Tar” arrived on the Tuesday the passengers did not disembark until the following day. At that time vessels with a draft of anything more than about ten feet were unable to berth at the Commercial Mole at Waterport and the “Royal Tar” would have had to anchor west of the quayside. She probably arrived near or after Evening Gunfire (five o’clock on that day, according to the Chronicle) when the Port would have virtually closed down for the night. At Second Gunfire the gates of the garrison – Waterport, Landport and Southport – were locked, sentries were posted and no-one would have been able to enter or leave the town until the following day.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, December 17th, passengers were up on deck as a light Levanter mist gradually dispersed in the winter sunshine and every detail of the grand backdrop was revealed. Towards the west Europe and Africa approached one another almost appearing to touch; to the north in Spain lay the gentle slopes covered in small-holdings that produced fruit and vegetables for the ‘Campo’ area, rising into the brown hills covered in scrub, and climbing up into the purple mountains of the Sierra Morena, famous for bandits, highwaymen and smugglers. Directly south, on the coast of Barbary, the ancient town of Ceuta was clearly visible twelve miles across the Strait. West of that towered “Mons Abyla”, Gibraltar’s twin, the other Pillar of Hercules. Eastwards rose the steep cliffs of the Rock of Gibraltar itself, ranges of batteries rising from the sea, tier upon tier, extending along the entire sea-front. Every niche in the rock face bristled with artillery.\n\nWhen they were ready for disembarkation the passengers waited for the dozens of rowing boats crowding in the water about the ship ready to ferry them ashore. The Loreto nuns, the Bishop, a surgeon, a group of ten Army officers and men, a Miss Masina and a child, and the Shea family (father was at one time Spanish Consul in Gibraltar) were rowed ashore later that morning. On the sea journey from Southampton there would no doubt have been conversations amongst the passengers, those who had lived on the Rock explaining to the newcomers what Gibraltar was like and how it functioned.\n\nWednesday 17th was a clear winter’s day with a temperature of 55º Fahrenheit – approximately 13º Celsius – and though the weather was good there had been a severe storm a few days earlier when a troop ship bound for Jamaica had suffered damage and her departure was consequently delayed . One wonders about the plight of the “Royal Tar’s” passengers as they crossed the notorious Bay of Biscay.\n\nAs the Loretto Sisters – they still spelled themselves with two t’s – and the other passengers were being rowed towards the jetty they would have seen that the entire town was surrounded by a massive wall just a few feet in from the shore line. They disembarked near the Water Gate, the only gate through which civilians arriving by sea were allowed to pass. Somewhere near the Water Gate they might have read the notice stating:\n\n“No persons will be permitted to enter or leave this gate between the hours of eleven PM and four AM”.\n\nAll civilians entering or leaving Gibraltar needed special passes, and undoubtedly the nuns would have had permits of residence requested by the Bishop and authorised by the Governor. Only a very limited number of civilians not born in Gibraltar were allowed to reside in the town.\n\nHere at Waterport the nuns’ identification papers would have been examined by an official from the recently established Police Office, porters would have arranged for the collection and delivery of their luggage and no doubt someone was sent to meet and escort them by carriage. They were accompanied from the mole through the only route, a long and very noisy vaulted passageway built into the city walls. In the confined space the echo of rumbling carts was deafening; it encouraged shouting competitions amongst the crowds of pedestrians moving between the town and the mole. Men called out in a variety of languages, dialects and colloquial speech. The pandemonium subsided very slightly as they left the tunnel, entered Casemates Square and continued into the heart of the town along the narrow Waterport Street and Church Street towards the Cathedral. The main street was crowded with men, women and children, sailors and soldiers,horses and carts, dogs, goats, donkeys and mules. In a “Handbook to Spain” published in 1845 the passenger from the steamer arriving at Gibraltar is warned that he will be\n\n“tormented by cads and touts who clamorously canvass him to put up at their respective inns, all second rate and dear.”\n\nAt the main entrance to the Cathedral a small crowd had gathered and various dignitaries were ready to receive and welcome the nuns to Gibraltar. His Excellency the Governor, Lieutenant General Sir Robert Wilson, together with Bishop Henry Hughes (who must have preceded them) and the Junta of Elders waited to greet them formally. The Cathedral bells rang in welcome and the troops lined Waterport Street up to the Cathedral. In the previous October Bishop Hughes had, in fact, consecrated the altar at the new church at Loretto House, Rathfarnham and had deposited there the relics of St Cecilia, St Philomena and St Teresa. It seems clear that Bishop Hughes had arranged to escort the nuns to Gibraltar himself.\n\nThe group had left Rathfarnham on December 3rd and had headed for Southampton by coach and ferry. There they embarked for their journey to Gibraltar. Since Bishop Hughes was travelling with them we might assume that the Sisters would have heard Mass frequently during their eight-day sea journey. On the way the ship had called in to collect and deliver goods and mail at La Coruña, Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon and Cadiz.\n\nMother Angela Kelly, aged twenty-six, had been appointed Superior, and she and Sisters Vincent Clinch (twenty-eight) and Seraphia Rorke (twenty-one) were all teachers. Sister Placida Byrne (twenty-four) would look after the house.\n\nThere was a fifth Sister of whose name and age we have no definite record, but she may have been Josephine Underhill who was thirty-two in 1845 and who was Canadian by birth.\n\n2: First Impressions\n\nFifteen years earlier the young Benjamin Disraeli had written about Gibraltar:\n\n“…I write to you from a country where the hedges consist of aloes all in blossom: fourteen, sixteen feet high. This Rock is a wonderful place, with a population infinitely diversified. Moors with costumes radiant as a rainbow or an Eastern melodrama; Jews with gabardines and skull-caps; Genoese, Highlanders, and Spaniards, whose dress is as picturesque as that of the sons of Ivor.”\n\nA year before the arrival of the Loreto nuns William Makepeace Thackeray formed a similar impression of the people in Gibraltar’s main street:\n\n“In Main Street the Jews predominate, the Moors abound; and from the ‘Jolly Sailor’ or the brave ‘Horse Marine’, where the people of our nation are drinking British beer and gin, you hear choruses of ‘Garryowen’ or ‘The Lass I left behind me’; while through the flaring lattices of the Spanish ventas come the clatter of castanets and the jingle and moan of Spanish guitars and ditties. It is a curious sight at evening this thronged street, with the people, in a hundred different costumes, bustling to and fro under the coarse flare of the lamps; swarthy Moors, in white or crimson robes; dark Spanish smugglers in tufted hats, with gay silk handkerchiefs round their heads; fuddled seamen from men-of-war, or merchantmen; porters, Galician or\n\nPICTURE 1: Loreto House, Rathfarnham\n\nPICTURE 2: “Royal Tar”\n\nGenoese; and at every few minutes’ interval, little squads of soldiers tramping to relieve guard at some one of the innumerable posts in the town.”\n\nThe military were much in evidence. The nuns could hardly have avoided the impact of seeing one terrace after another mounted in those days with the latest and most terrible guns.\n\n“I tell you”,\n\nsaid a British soldier stationed in Gibraltar to an American acquaintance,\n\n“We’d make mince-meat of the nasty French if they ever tried to knock us off the Rock!”\n\nIt was clear that the Army was in charge, and the Governor’s word was law. The civilian population counted for little. There were numerous occasions when Governors for security reasons had actually made efforts to keep civilians out of the fortress altogether, hence the precautions over identity papers and the strict rules about entry to and departure from the garrison, right of residence and the right to own or lease property.\n\nIn the early days after the capture of the Rock in 1704 civilians had been tolerated only in so far as they served the requirements of the military. Inevitably a permanent civilian population attached itself to the Rock anyway, and over time the military authorities found themselves obliged to look after their basic needs if only to ensure their own garrison’s freedom from disease. Occasionally Governors took the requirements of the civilian population into account and made improvements for the collection of potable water, the regular supply of food from Morocco and – when not at war – from Spain, the hygiene in the markets, the sewage system and the sale of food about the town; sickness amongst the civilian population could affect the military and might have dire effects on the readiness of the troops to defend the fortress. The creation of the Alameda Gardens in 1815 was the result of one of these improvement projects.\n\n“There being no place of public recreation in this Garrison“ [General Don] “was induced to establish a walk around the Grand Parade, and form what is called in this country an Alameda, where the inhabitants might enjoy the air protected from the extreme heat of the sun”.\n\nMoney for the gardens was raised from public lotteries and voluntary contributions, and a Head Gardener and Horticulturist, Giuseppe Codali, was brought over from Italy specially to oversee the new project. Codali stayed on in Gibraltar, and just three years before the arrival of the Loreto nuns the Italianate sunken garden and bridge were opened and the Alameda project was completed. The South district, beyond Southport Gate, now became desirable as a residential area for those who could afford to live there, the open spaces and the development of these and other gardens offering a healthier living environment than the crowded town. But even in the Gardens Thackeray notes:\n\n“The horticultural and military mixture is indeed very queer: here and there temples, rustic summer-seats, &c. have been erected in the garden, but you are sure to see a great squat mortar look up from among the flower-pots: and amidst the aloes and geraniums sprouts the green petticoat and scarlet coat of a Highlander… From the terraces immense cannon are perpetually looking, surrounded by plantations of cannon-balls and beds of bomb-shells, sufficient, one would think, to blow away the whole peninsula.”\n\n3: Mission\n\nIn Gibraltar Catholics had enjoyed freedom to practise their religion since its capture in 1704. This had been one of the agreed conditions of the Spanish surrender. The business of the Catholic Church in Gibraltar nevertheless stumbled along as it faced considerable day-to-day problems, partly because of the difficulty of finding priests who could speak the language of the people.\n\nSince the Middle Ages the ‘lingua franca’ of the Mediterranean had been the ‘pidgin’ trade language used by various communities around the whole Mediterranean rim. Over the hundred and forty years since the Rock’s capture this trading language had almost died out. Its syntax had once been basically Arabic and its vocabulary taken from Ladino, Turkish, Catalan, French and Spanish. In Gibraltar a form of the old ‘lingua franca’ was revived and modified by the flood of new settlers: Genoese and French from Liguria and Piedmont, Moors and Sephardic Jews from North Africa, Catalans and Portuguese, and the fewer than one hundred Spaniards who remained on the Rock after its surrender to Britain. Proximity to Spain would ensure that the various languages of Gibraltar’s mixed civilian population would gradually blend and mutate into Spanish – with a distinctive slant. Here are some of the roots of what we now call “Llanito” (pronounced ‘Janito’ with an English ‘J’ and perhaps deriving from the Genoese ‘Gianni’, diminutive for ‘Giovanni’).\n\nThis Spanish with a lot of foreign words and strange expressions thrown in was peculiar to Gibraltar. It was the common language of everyday use, and hence the main language of the local Catholic Church. Its closeness to standard Spanish meant that Spanish-speaking priests were much in demand. However, the British authorities still considered Bourbon Spain ‘the enemy’ and they were naturally wary of allowing Spanish priests into the Garrison; there were few Spanish-speaking Catholic priests of British nationality available.\n\nEducation in Gibraltar also suffered from the linguistic divide between the resident British forces and the relatively new and growing civilian population, mostly of Mediterranean origin but – over time and when politics allowed – flavoured by the marriage of Spanish women to Gibraltarian men. Nevertheless in 1845\n\nPicture 3: Mother Vincent Clinch’s Grave\n\nat Rathfarnham\n\nPicture 4: “Femme de Gibraltar”\n\n19th Century Lithograph (P Blanchard)\n\nGibraltar was a British Colony in the Empire “on which the sun never set” and the English language was becoming more important for business and politics.\n\nAlthough there were many small private schools and private tutors on the Rock, responsibility for the education of Catholic children – especially the poor – fell heavily on the shoulders of the few local priests. These were mainly of Genoese, Maltese and Minorcan extraction; they were called upon to supplement the handful of often inadequate lay teachers employed in Gibraltar’s Catholic schools.\n\nIn the United Kingdom Catholics had had to wait until the 1829 Catholic Emancipation Act and the Reform Act of 1832 to be freed legally from the civil disabilities imposed on them by British law. After these Acts all religious groups in Britain had the right to be treated equally. Schools supported by non-Conformists, Roman Catholics and Jews were even entitled to financial aid from the Government amounting to a proportion of the sum they themselves managed to raise privately. Gradually these more tolerant attitudes spread to the Colonies – at least officially and legally, if not always socially – and what was new for the Catholic Church in Gibraltar was the availability of Government funding; this was welcomed on the Rock.\n\nThe Non-Conformists seem to have been first off the mark under the new conditions and Dr W H Rule, a Methodist missionary who was educated in several ancient and modern languages,lost no time in coming to Gibraltar to set up a school for poor children. He taught English through Spanish when necessary and this was his great advantage. The quality of education offered by his school attracted many Catholic students and Dr Rule admitted all comers. When girls also began to turn up to be taught Mrs Rule was called upon to help out and the school grew. But the enterprise was essentially proselytising in intention and all students including Catholics were required to attend Divine Service once a week. They were also expected to be present at scripture classes using the King James Bible, not the Douai translation favoured by Catholics.\n\nIt soon became clear that if the Catholic Church was to meet the quantitative and qualitative needs of Gibraltar’s Catholic children some radical rethinking of the educational programme would be required. Bishop Hughes had already taken steps to raise standards for the boys; he now appealed to Archbishop Murray of Dublin, his personal friend and supporter, for help in developing the education of Catholic girls. Archbishop Murray approached Mother Teresa Ball who sent the first Loreto Sisters to the Rock to educate the girls.\n\nBishop Hughes had known the Sisters of the Institute from the days of his appointment to the old penal chapel in Dublin popularly known as ‘Adam and Eve’s’.\n\n4: Gibraltarians\n\nIn the mid-1840s Gibraltar was enjoying a boom in trade. At the turn of the century the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar put paid to any possible threat from France and gave Britain control of the entire Mediterranean. Nelson had ensured British naval superiority for much of the 19th century. Gibraltar was Britain’s own port at the entrance to the Mediterranean and so local merchants made full use of their opportunities. The turnover of goods from Manchester in particular grew to immense proportions.\n\nThe civilian population now numbered about 16,000 in total, of which 4,000 were foreigners from France, Morocco, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Genoa. The British Gibraltarians – that is, those born in Gibraltar, whatever their ancestry which in any case was usually mixed, were beginning to exist as a distinct group, with roots in Gibraltar, a love of their homeland, and expressing a hotchpotch of a culture drawn from an amalgam of all the countries of their forebears. They numbered some 11,000 out of a total of 12,000 British Subjects. There were about a thousand civilians, mostly businessmen and their families, who hailed from the British Isles.\n\nThe nuns may not have been too startled by the fashions and customs of the English and of some of the other affluent members of the community whose attire at least would have been similar to that of Dublin or London. The assorted costumes of Genoese, Portuguese, Moroccan Berbers, Jews and Spaniards were a different matter. There was also a distinctive Gibraltarian outdoor mantle or cape which the women wore over their clothes. It was made of red material and edged with black velvet around the hood, hem, front panels and arm openings. This garment appears to have been peculiar to Gibraltar. It is interesting to note that at that time the British Military used a great deal of red in their uniforms and one wonders if bales of the famous ‘Stroud scarlet’ woollen material tended to ‘fall off the back of a cart’ now and then.\n\nThe poorer Gibraltarians lived for the most part at the eastern edge of the town, up the steep hills, and in the narrow streets, in the alleys and passages, and in the crowded ‘patios’. This was the area where the Loreto Sisters were soon to open their first free school. By December the following year a hundred and fifty pupils were attending this school.\n\nThe more affluent Gibraltarians lived in Main Street and its narrow branch streets, and also in the larger houses in the less crowded ‘South’ of the town. The strange mixture of English, Spanish and Italian architecture, the cosmopolitan crowds in front of the cafes, and the strange looking vehicles (small horse-drawn ‘gharries’) must have been a source of wonder to the newcomers.\n\nOn the day the Chronicle announced the arrival in Gibraltar of the nunsit also carried a number of short notices about other events:\n\n·Queen Victoria had recently visited Paris;\n\n·In County Clare the peasantry were “exaggerating the loss in potatoes as an excuse for refusing to pay rent”;\n\n·The public execution of William Cole, a prisoner, would take place at Rosia Parade. Cole had killed his Guard, Mr Walters, when the latter had reprimanded him “for idle performance of his work”;\n\n·Mr MacKay and Anthony Cozzanegra advertised their availability as tutors;\n\n·“Mr Villiers, Surgeon, Dentist and Cupper, has the honor [sic] to inform the inhabitants of Gibraltar that he continues to fit Artificial Teeth, from one to a whole set, in the most approved manner, affording ease to the mouth and facility of speech.” He operated at No 1 Convent Place, “near the Apothecary’s shop”.\n\n5: Getting Settled\n\nThe Sisters first occupied “a good house near the Protestant Cathedral”. This was probably “Don Place” on the north side of Governor’s Lane, just off Main Street. “Don Place” is carved into the stone archway over the entrance. It was in an excellent position in the town but unfortunately it had no grounds.\n\nIt was fitting that this should be the Loreto nuns’ first home; General Don, despite his evident dislike of Gibraltarians – on arrival he had originally devised a plan to relocate them all to Windmill Hill so as to leave more space in the town for the military – had occasionally allowed children of civilians to attend the military schools, if necessary free of charge, upon production of a certificate from the Catholic priest to the effect that they were unable to afford the fees.\n\nNevertheless schooling was difficult in Gibraltar. The wealthy could afford private tutors of course and some even sent their children to be educated in England, while the Army provided small regimental schools. But apart from a handful of very inadequate ‘dame schools’ (the fees were one peseta a day, and the children brought their own stools to sit on in the ‘teacher’s’ kitchen) and the efforts of local priests to run small literacy classes for a few boys there was little available for poor Catholic children. Naturally, when the new Protestant free schools were set up Catholic children flocked to them. Soon the Loreto nuns would alleviate the situation for the girls.\n\nDon Place is a pleasant house in a pretty little private patio. The patio floor is covered with large flagstones. There is an ornamental ironwork gate not far from the entrance. The patio was probably adorned with flowerpots on the wall and on the ground in the style of many private courtyards in Gibraltar. A heavily ornamented iron hand pump would have existed somewhere in the yard; water would have been pumped up from the underground water cistern which all refurbished houses and new buildings were obliged to have since the early 1800s when General Don had ordered the storage of rain water collected from the flat roofs.\n\nHeating would not have been a great problem in Gibraltar as winters are relatively mild, and in those days larger houses would have had coal or log fires. There was, of course, no gas until 1856 at the earliest, when the Gibraltar Gas Company was formed, and at first it only supplied some of the street lighting; but then Bray in County Wicklow, near Dublin, didn’t have gas until 1860 either. All cooking was done on a Mediterranean version of the Roman ceramic stove. This consisted of a high brickwork ‘table’ with several openings on the surface where cooking pots were placed over small charcoal fires. A plaited straw fan with a cane handle would be used to drive air through rectangular holes at the front of each small fireplace.\n\nHere in Don Place the Loreto nuns had their first Convent. It was called “St Aloysius”. Soon after their arrival in Gibraltar the Governor, Lieutenant General Sir Robert Wilson (renowned for his brilliant if sometimes erratic exploits during the Napoleonic Wars) and Miss Wilson, his daughter, visited their ‘neighbours’; Don Place is almost immediately opposite the back entrance to the Governor’s Palace, which incidentally is also called ‘The Convent’ because in Spanish times prior to 1704 it had been a Franciscan Convent. The Governor and his daughter expressed great interest in the mission of the Loreto nuns and wished them well for the future.\n\n6: First Schools\n\nAfter Christmas in January 1846 the first Loreto school was established in Gibraltar. It was opened in a large room in a house owned by the Dotto family at 50 Governor’s (then ‘Gunner’s’) Street. At Don Place a fee-paying day school followed soon after. Before long the Don Place premises proved too small for the nuns and their pupils and just over a year later they moved yards away to Southport Street (now the southern part of Main Street) to a building near the Supreme Court over what later became Roberts Pharmacy.\n\nThe nuns were beginning to settle in when they had to face their first heartbreak: just eighteen months after their arrival Sister Seraphia Rorke, one of the founder members of the new Loreto Community, developed TB and died in June 1847. She was only twenty-three.\n\n“The first death in a small community is always intensely felt. It seems like the breaking up of a family circle.\n\nSister Seraphia is buried in Gibraltar. She appears to have been unwell even before she came to Gibraltar. Mother Concepción Lopez (daughter of Elena Roberts, one of Mother Teresa Ball’s school friends at the Bar Convent in York) said that sometimes when she met Sister Seraphia, flushed and tired, on her way to the school in Bray she would often tell her to go back to her cell, that they would manage very well without her. Sister Seraphia would reply,\n\n“I don’t think you could, Mother. I am too famous for keeping your crowds in order.”\n\nNo doubt she also “kept the crowds in order” during her short time in Gibraltar. Sister Seraphia was seen by her contemporaries as\n\n“absolutely gentle and absolutely firm.”\n\nTwo months after Sister Seraphia’s death Bishop Hughes wrote to Mother Teresa Ball informing her that Sister Vincent Clinch, just thirty, was very ill. Bishop Hughes suggested that she should return to Ireland, which she did. Sister Vincent recovered once back in Ireland and lived to the age of ninety-four. She died in 1911 and is buried in the cemetery in the grounds of what used to be Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham.\n\nThere were now only three Sisters left in the Gibraltar community. Later in February 1847 Mother Helena Hanlon and Mother Frances Hennessy arrived, bringing with them from the Mother House in Rathfarnham books and stationery for the free school in Governor’s Street. The Community were five once again.\n\nThere were now as many pupils as could comfortably fit in the fee-paying day school in Southport Street. The number of children attending the free school grew rapidly, and very soon they had over two hundred pupils there. The school was subsidised by the Church, the Government and some charitable funds.\n\nThe children at Loreto’s free school in Dalkey who were taught the usual\n\n“writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, plain and fancy needlework”\n\nwere said to have\n\n“great advantages for mental arithmetic, geography and parsing”.\n\nThe free school in Gibraltar was using the same system as was in operation in Dalkey, the ‘Lancasterian System’ (named after its founder Joseph Lancaster). Its mechanical scheme of organization made it possible to teach large groups of children. Lancaster claimed that one teacher, by using the older pupils as monitors, could instruct one thousand pupils; he himself is said to have demonstrated its feasibility. There was one monitor for every ten students. The small-group peer interaction ensured that no one had a chance to get bored. Merit badges were awarded for excellence. The cost was approximately four shillings per year per child and boys and girls were taught according to the same curriculum, though the Loreto Sisters only taught boys up to the age of seven. Subjects taught went well beyond the basics and in the higher classes included algebra, nature study and foreign languages. The students wrote on (almost!) indestructible slate instead of on expensive consumable paper. One book per subject per class was used, each page separated and placed on a board suspended overhead. Each group of ten children studied a page as a lesson. Then the groups rotated. The system had been used successfully in the Loreto free schools in Ireland. Economically the scheme made education possible for all the children of a community on the basis of charitable and later of Governmental financial support.\n\nA topic of conversation in the town in 1848 would have been the discovery of a primitive skull blasted out of Forbes Quarry at the foot of the sheer northern face of the Rock. Eight years later a similar skull found in Germany resulted in the designation ‘Neanderthal Man’. Since the Gibraltar skull was that of a young female, Dorothy Ellicott (1901 – 1990) suggests it might have been more fitting if ‘Gibraltar Woman’ had been promoted instead of ‘Neanderthal Man’ . But Germany had been quicker off the mark in recognising the importance of their find.\n\nMeanwhile fourteen-year old Ellen Taylor arrived with her parents from Greece to live in Gibraltar. It is very likely that she attended school with the Loreto Sisters because seven years later she entered with them and became “Sister Scholastica”.\n\nBy 1851 Mother Angela Kelly, Mother Helena O’Hanlon and Mother Jane Francis Hennessy were teaching over seven hundred children at the school in Governor’s Street and seventy pupils at the Day School in Southport Street. Four nuns from Rathfarnham en route to Cadiz were impressed by the exquisite work and numerous drawings produced by the children and by the hard work of the Loreto Community on the Rock.\n\n7: Thoughts about Spain\n\nNow, six years after the Gibraltar Foundation Loreto was in a position to open a school in Spain in response to repeated requests from Teresa Ball’s old school friends, especially Teresa Magawley Countess of Cabry. Bishop Hughes accompanied the four nuns to Cadiz where they arrived on November 10th. They were taken by Teresa Magawley to\n\n“a palace with a big oratory, terraces, and sufficient grounds to take exercise in the open air.”\n\nIn Cadiz they took charge of a school of thirty pupils where for the past eleven years a lady had been teaching the children the most delicate flower-making. They kept the lady on at the school as an assistant so that she could teach the nuns her skill.\n\nThe Foundation seemed promising at first. Teresa Magawley had paid for the nuns’ equipment and their travelling expenses, and she would pay Loreto’s expenses in Spain for the whole of that first year. Unhappily the history of Spain for most of the 19th century was dominated by the dynastic dilemma resulting from the death without male heir of Fernando VII. His daughter took the throne as Isabel II but her uncle Don Carlos opposed her claim, and so began the Carlist Wars.\n\nPolitical disturbances in Spain in the summer of 1856 caused the nuns to be recalled to Ireland. The school in Cadiz was then taken over by two Irish ladies named Fallon who continued to run it from 1856 until 1887, in the hope that the nuns would one day return.\n\nMeanwhile the young Dr Scandella, a talented Gibraltarian priest, had recently returned to the Rockfrom a ten-year period as Vicar General to Archbishop Nicholson in Cyprus. He now became Bishop Hughes’ Secretary in Gibraltar.\n\nIn the South a new parish was beginning to emerge where a small number of Catholic Army families and some poorer Gibraltarians also lived. This district was known as St Joseph’s and, although there was no church there at the time, Sunday Mass had been celebrated somewhere in the area since at least 1834 when it wasrecorded that “Father Nicolás” was paid $15 (Spanish) a month for taking on the Chaplaincy of Europa.\n\nSome time between 1853 and 1856 Gabriel Femenías, the son of a hotel owner at Rosia Parade heard about a plot of rocky land in the South which had recently been granted by the authorities to Antonio Mateos, his employer. When Mateos died soon after, Gabriel Femenías suggested that Bishop Hughes might request it of the Mateos family as a site on which to build a church for the area. The family duly complied and after the transfer of the concession Bishop Hughes began preparations to build St Joseph‘s church.\n\nMeanwhile large numbers of British ships carrying troops paused briefly at Gibraltar on their way to and from the Crimea. On their return journeys back from the front soldiers counted every mile of their distance from Gibraltar and were relieved when the mighty Rock at last came in sight.\n\n“Captain Browne, only brother of Sister Mary Regis lost both arms at the war: one was shot off, the other amputated.”\n\nTwo years after the War the British Government brought to Gibraltar four Russian guns captured at the Crimea. Two are on display near the British War Memorial on King’s Bastion.\n\nHaving held office for some sixteen years the Bishop’s health was now failing. As a young man Henry Hughes had entered with the Franciscans. He completed his studies at the “ColegioFranciscano de Nuestra Señora de Regla”, near Chipiona. An able, hard-working and intelligent man, he duly became Provincial of the Franciscans in Ireland. His fluency in Spanish together with his other qualities of leadership made him an ideal candidate as Vicar General in Gibraltar, and so his appointment to this office in 1839 was strongly supported by his old friend Archbishop Murray of Dublin.\n\nDuring his time in Gibraltar Bishop Hughes had endured a difficult relationship with an especially difficult Governor, Sir Robert Gardiner. The correspondence between the Governor’s Secretary and the Bishop suggests that Gardiner treated the Catholic Church in Gibraltar as another Government Department and the Bishop as – in his opinion – a somewhat obstinate Departmental Head. Altercations between the two (via their respective secretaries of course!) continued by correspondence for years. But then Gardiner squabbled with everyone and frequently with the British merchants of the Commercial Exchange Committee, who eventually sent a delegation to London with complaints about the Governor; he was soon replaced.\n\nBishop Hughes had been ill with bronchial problems for some years and as the climate in Gibraltar did not suit him he sometimes spent time in Ireland convalescing. This too became a bone of contention and the Governor on several occasions demanded explanations of the Bishop regarding his “absence without leave” from the garrison. On one occasion the Bishop’s pay was docked!\n\nThe nuns had been on the Rock eleven years when on September 7th 1856 Bishop Henry Hughes left Gibraltar for the last time. He returned to Ireland and resigned on May 28th 1857. He was a great loss to the Loreto Sisters. He had been a good friend to the nuns and to their patron in Dublin, Archbishop Murray.\n\nDr John Baptist Scandella, Secretary to Bishop Hughes, was now appointed Vicar Apostolic in his stead. As a child John Baptist Scandella had been a pupil of the Christian Brothers during their two-year period in Gibraltar (1835 – 1837). He completed his studies for the priesthood at the Urban College of Propaganda Fide in Rome and graduated “Magna cum Laude”. Besides Spanish he spoke Italian and Greek well and had improved his English during the ten years he spent in Corfu.\n\nPICTURE 5: Mary Ward 1585-1645\n\nPICTURE 6: Frances Ball 1794-1861\n\nOn his appointment Bishop Scandella continued and developed the projects initiated by Bishop Hughesand in a bid to sort out the educational needs of the boys he took out a lease in 1863 on a large site with sprawling buildings and outhouses between St Bernard’s Road and what used to be called “Europa Main Road” leading southwards towards Europa Point. He later applied to the Colonial Government to have “an additional storey on one of the upper buildings” and “to build a chapel”; in 1867 once more “to build 2 rooms, to erect a porter’s lodge and to build another storey and a terrace.” Permission for the extra storey and terrace was refused.\n\nIn 1860 another of the five original pioneers, Sister Placida Byrne, died in Gibraltar aged thirty-nine. She had been on the Rock for fifteen years, since the foundation. A month later in October news was received that Bishop Henry Hughes had died in Wexford aged seventy-two.\n\nStories have been handed down the generations referring to the poverty of those first years for Loreto in Gibraltar. There were various reasons, but the fact of their poverty is referred to in several of Mother Teresa Ball’s letters.\n\n“Sisters at Gibraltar, from failure of the vintage, having 300 poor girls, are in want. We sent them £40 and posted up the enclosed notice. Mother Lopez will procure a vessel to sail with fancy work for bazaar, of which printed notice was forwarded to our houses.\n\nYou can send your contributions in work hither, we\n\nwill forward them to Gibraltar.”\n\nLess than a year later Mother Teresa Ball, the first General Superior and Foundress of the Irish IBVM, died on May 19th 1861. In 1803 Frances Ball had been sent to school at the age of nine to the Bar Convent in York. Her teachers were the “English Ladies” of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin which had been founded by Mary Ward in 1609.\n\n8: Mary Ward and Teresa Ball\n\nMary Ward began her innovative experiment in religious life in Elizabethan England. At the time, being Catholic in England frequently meant persecution and even death. Mary wanted her women’s group to be patterned on the model of Ignatius of Loyola’s Society of Jesus with the mobility and flexibility that the Jesuit rule provided. She wanted her women to dress like ordinary women and to be mobile, not cloistered as most women religious were in those days, and to elect their own General Superior. They were to be free to go wherever the need was to educate people in the faith. This was a wholly new kind of religious order. In implementing her dream Mary Ward’s actions raised more than a few clerical eyebrows. Her nuns were ridiculed and called “galloping girls” because of their propensity for travelling about on horseback. She was initially condemned by the Church and imprisoned by the Inquisition, and when she died in 1645 there was virtually nothing to show for her life’s work all over Europe. Most of her followers had been\n\ndisbanded.[33] However, a remnant of Mary Ward’s Institute had survived here and there in Europe, though the ravages of European wars severed their network of communications. One Community of the Institute survived in England against all odds. Mary Ward was still their ‘Chief Superior’ in London at the beginning of the English Civil War. In 1642 when things began to get difficult in London the companions moved to York where Mary Ward died in 1645.\n\nSome years later in 1686 Frances Bedingfield, who had been a contemporary of Mary Ward, was able to purchase a house at Micklegate Bar in York. Here they set up school, though at this time of persecution for Catholics they did not of course advertise the fact that they were Catholic Religious. This is where Frances Ball was sent in 1803, to be educated by Mary Ward’s successors “The Ladies of the Bar”.\n\nAfter Frances had finished her schooling at York she returned there in 1814 and entered the novitiate of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary where she received her religious training and made her Profession in 1816.\n\nAs Mother Mary Teresa she went back to Dublin in 1821 with two novices to establish the Irish Branch of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary for the instruction of children. She also brought with her a copy of Mary Ward’s original Constitutions which she had copied out by hand. In 1822 she opened the first Convent of the Institute in Ireland at Rathfarnam House, four miles from Dublin.\n\nMother Teresa Ball was a woman of great piety and administrative ability.During her years as General of Loreto she had been able to send fifty-four sisters ‘on mission’ to far-flung parts of the British Empire. A true disciple of Ignatius she was quoting him when she said that\n\n“We find God in the ordinary”.\n\nNot very different from Mary Ward’s assertion that\n\n“Many think it nothing to do ordinary things. But for us it is. To do ordinary things well… in every office or employment, whatever it be: to do it well: this is for us.”\n\nThe year Mother Teresa Ball died (1861) five more nuns arrived in Gibraltar to support Loreto’s developing mission. The new Superior was Mother Joseph Anne Hickey\n\n“…whose joyous heart and beaming face brightened everything…”\n\nUntil then she had been Superior at the new foundation in Killarney. She was accompanied by Susan Cousse Murphy (Sister Stanislaus), a convert to Catholicism, and Marcella Byrne (Sister Ignatius), both professed novices, aged twenty-five and twenty-two respectively, and by Sisters Veronica Mooney and Bernadine Lyons who would look after the house.\n\nThe most memorable event that occurred during this period was the great Civil War in America which began in 1861. In Gibraltar a Canadian, Major Charles A Boulton, was able to witness from the top of the Rock\n\n“the burning by the ‘Sumter’ of several vessels at more than a league distant from us on the Mediterranean side, and the quiet episode of the two American vessels which immediately afterwards occupied our waters in the Bay of Gibraltar. The Confederate cruiser ‘Sumter’, under the command of the celebrated Captain Semmes, had taken shelter under the guns, and the American war-vessel ‘Kearsarge’, Captain Winslowe in command, kept quiet watch in Algeciras Bay to see that she did not escape to commit depredations upon American shipping.”\n\nGibraltar was agog, and the Loreto sisters would certainly have heard about the events in the Bay and may even have witnessed the ships from the terrace of their house in Waterport Street. Captain Boulton remarked that it was interesting to see the commanders of these vessels occasionally reading together in the Garrison Library and the officers of both vessels being entertained in turn by the officers of the 100th Regiment. War was waged politely in those days.\n\nSadly Mother Joseph Anne Hickey, who was spoken of with great affection and respect, died in 1862 after only one year in Gibraltar. She was so loved and appreciated by the Gibraltarians that when she died the people asked for her coffin to be carried open along the Main Street towards the cemetery. Four years later on the occasion of the similar burial of a very popular Gibraltarian priest, Father Manuel Schiacaluga, the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed Bishop Scandella (via Governor Sir Richard Airey and his Secretary) that\n\n“such processions should be forbidden as well as the exposure of bodies in open coffins.”\n\nThe Governor informed the Bishop that he and all those who had taken part in the funeral procession had been liable to imprisonment and a fine, but assured him that he had no wish to bring legal proceedings so long as it was clearly understood that this would not happen again. It seems the practice of conveying bodies in open coffins was prevalent in Malta, though it was illegal there too, and perhaps the custom had been brought to Gibraltar by some of the new Maltese immigrants.\n\n9: “Noxious Miasma”\n\nIn 1862 Mother Berchmans Lenigan (Mother Xaveria Fallon’s aunt) was appointed Superior in Gibraltar in Mother Joseph Anne Hickey’s place.\n\nMother Berchmans was busy, energetic and adaptable, filling a number of different offices over time –\n\n“her eye and hand seemed to be everywhere”.\n\nShe had been one of those who had nursed Mother Teresa Ball during her last long illness. She had also been Mistress of Schools in Rathfarnham and the children there remembered her saying to them that it “cut her to the heart” when anything went wrong with Loreto. She had a great affection for Mother Teresa Ball, and said that she had no problem being sent to Gibraltar since\n\n“the whole world was the same to her from the day Reverend Mother died”.\n\nMother Berchmans was a very valuable member of the rising Institute.\n\n“Her occupations during her life were manifold. She was by turns, or rather almost at one and the same time, Superior and Dispenser, superintending in the kitchen and presiding at a concert, directing workmen and teaching a class – no duty was unfamiliar to her. A more generous heart was never known and in the struggling days of the Order, when religious poverty sometimes bordered on actual want, Mother Berchmans’ liberality was a wonder to those who knew how perplexed she often was to supply necessaries, not to speak of the comforts she managed to procure for the sick or overworked Sisters. Mother Berchmans nursed Mother Teresa Ball with great devotion and care during her last long illness and wrote an account of the last seven months of Mother Teresa’s life.\n\nShe was appointed Superior in Gibraltar in the 1860s, but found the climate too hot for her declining health. Before she returned to Ireland she implored the Bishop to ‘take the house at the South’ for the poor Sisters who were enduring so much. To her great joy he gave her his solemn promise that he would do so.\n\nAfter her return she was sent to Loreto Bray as Mistress of Music, and had charge of the choir. She presided in the school and was fully occupied daily until 9 p.m. Her busy, holy life came to an end on 13th September 1867 in Loreto Convent Bray.”\n\nThe Loreto records state generously, if not accurately, that it was the climate in Gibraltar that did not suit Mother Berchmans and that as a result she succumbed to an attack of “fever”; the doctors thought she would not recover from it unless she returned to Ireland. The fact is that, as the Chronicle put it:\n\n“The sanitary condition of Gibraltar has long been unsatisfactory, and for a number of years the rate of mortality has been gradually increasing, until it has at length attracted the serious consideration of the Government. Few of the inhabitants seem to be aware that, notwithstanding all the advantages of the climate, and the absence of manufactures and trades prejudicial to health, the death rate was considerably higher in Gibraltar than in the great capitals of Europe, or the crowded centres of manufacturing enterprise in the United Kingdom.”\n\nAccording to an Army Report completed in 1862 there were four main causes for the frequent appearance\n\nPicture 7: Captain Semmes & Officers\n\nPicture 8: Diego Corrientes\n\nof cholera and other ‘fevers’ in Gibraltar: shortage of potable water, inadequate housing and the crowded patios in the town, a very poor sewage system, the fact that no-one seemed to be in charge of ensuring that the rules of common sense hygiene were properly observed. In 1866 the duly appointed ‘Officer of Health to the Sanitary Commissioners’ reported as follows:\n\n“I have this day inspected the Wharf at Waterport, the offices of the Revenue Inspectors, and the rooms in Waterport Casemates, in reference to a Public Nuisance which has been a subject of complaints for some time past. Although it was high tide at the time of my visit, the waters around the Wharf and on each side of Waterport Bridge were in a very foul state, giving out a very sickening stench. I was informed by the Inspectors and by bystanders that at low water the stench was intolerable, to such a degree as to cause nausea and even vomiting. I consider the state of the Wharf and its neighbourhood to be highly dangerous to the Public Health and to Her Majesty’s Troops…”\n\nAt the time it was not generally understood that many of these ‘fevers’ prevalent in Gibraltar were water– and food-borne diseases and little was known about germs and viruses.\n\nOutbreaks of serious diseases in Gibraltar were significant in the following years:\n\nYellow Fever 1798, 1799, 1800(?), 1804, 1810, 1813, 1828\n\nCholera 1834, 1843, 1854, 1860, 1865, 1885\n\nIn addition there were occasional occurrences and epidemics of other diseases to contend with, notably influenza, bubonic plague and smallpox. 19th Century Gibraltar was not a healthy place.\n\nIt was thought at the time that the fevers were caused by the inhaling of pestilential ‘miasma’ emanating from decaying rubbish and stagnant water, and that this was exacerbated by the ‘moral habits’ of those contracting these diseases. Drunkards, layabouts and the idle were particularly prone to malady. Associating poverty and moral character was a form of denial practised by the better-off; the poor had only themselves to blame for contracting (for instance) cholera. Little wonder then that people were secretive about the causes of death within a family! Perhaps something of the same attitude lingered until fairly recently, when certain diseases were named only in hushed whispers, or by the use of euphemisms.\n\n“The intemperate, the irregular and the filthy”\n\nwere especially vulnerable; cholera was malignant\n\n“only to those who had somehow weakened themselves”.\n\nThus several Governors (Houston, Gardiner) believed that panic and fear predisposed people to contract the disease, as did a tendency to depression and excess of any kind. A particular victim was described as having been\n\n“… a man of dissolute habits much addicted to\n\ndrink who on the day of his death had eaten a quantity of raw cucumbers and had drunk plentifully of Spanish brandy”.\n\n10: A Change of Air\n\nWe may assume that poor Mother Berchmans Lenigan had not indulged to excess either in cucumbers or in brandy, and that her moral habits were above reproach. Although she spent a very short time on the Rock her presence helped to change the course of history for Loreto in Gibraltar. According toa manuscript account Doctor Scandella came to see Mother Berchmans before she left. He said to her,\n\n“You have killed yourself for us, Mother. Is there anything I can do for you?”\n\nShe replied,\n\n“For the sake of the poor Sisters who have to work in those crowded schools, will you promise me to take the house at the south side?”\n\nShe was referring to Dr Scandella’s great project, the new development on Europa Main Road, where he was planning to realise his dream of setting up a college for the boys of Gibraltar. Bishop Scandella replied to Mother Berchmans,\n\n“I’ll do my very best.”\n\nThe open spaces of ‘the South’ contrasted with the densely populated Town area. Bishop Scandella was hoping to develop part of this large site as a home for St Bernard’s Boys’ College, which over the years had been moved a number of times and had undergone several changes regarding its educational purpose.\n\nIn January 1865 on the Feast of St Francis de Sales the nuns and a few pupils from “St Aloysius” in Waterport Street moved into a cottage on the Europa Road side of the premises. The area for the most part was still a building site. Nevertheless in the surrounding area there were:\n\n“… beautiful gardens, public as well as private; a spacious parade, fine walks shaded with trees and handsome octangular arbours surmounted by cupolas, where persons may sit and enjoy the view of the Bay and the coast of Spain on the other side. Here is the New Mole Parade, Rosia and Bonavista [sic] forming separate villages, with their extensive barracks and hospitals, while the hill in the background rises to a height of twelve hundred feet, covered with scanty vegetation of prickly shrubs, thistles and short grass.”\n\nAlterations had to be made to the ‘cottage’ before it was suitable as a Convent.\n\nMoving to Europa with the nuns was Miss Ellen Taylor, now a postulant of some months’ standing. She had arrived in Gibraltar seven years earlier with her parents.\n\nAt about this time a dispute arose between the Admiralty and Bishop Scandella. A letter referring to the matter was sent to Dr Scandella on the 8th of August advising him not to incur further expense until the issue had been resolved. It seems that the Bishop’s buildings on the east side of the site had encroached upon Crown Property near the Admiralty’s boundary wall to the extent of about ten feet beyond what had been agreed. At first the Colonial Government decided it would have to be pulled down but Bishop Scandella came up with a proposal to which the Military Authorities agreed, and in the event the construction was allowed to remain on the condition\n\n“that there would be no further encroachments.”\n\nBefore the Bishop took out his first lease on the property this “cottage” had been rented since 1859 by Frederick Stanley Carpenter, the new Deputy Commissaries General. Having been advised by his predecessor Deputy Commissaries General Drake, he decided to rent a house “in the public quarter” instead of using the allocated officers’ quarters. In his Diary he writes:\n\n“I was fortunate to find a house out of town, to the south of the Rock. It was about a half mile up a hill and had a fine view of the Bay, Barbary Hills and Algiers [sic] opposite. In clear weather we could see Tangiers. We also had the sight of the Signal Station which was useful, as we could see the signals showing what steamer was expected and then to watch her coming round Tarifa Point.\n\nThe chief part about the house was that, being long, it had the drawing room and three bedrooms on one floor with the dining room and two sitting rooms above, on the second floor. There was a separate wing approached by a veranda, and a garden with marble statues in front above the road. Our drawing room opened on a terrace over the road.”\n\nWhen Deputy Commissaries General Frederick Stanley Carpenter moved out of his rented accommodation BishopScandella took out a lease on the site and though building works continued in the whole area the nuns and their handful of students were able to move in. The Bishop himself lived just above the convent in a separate building on the same site, to the north and east of their ‘cottage’. With him lived his sister Miss Jacinta Scandella, Father Thomas McAuliffe who was the Chaplain to the Forces and also acted as the Bishop’s Secretary, a coachman, a gardener (both Portuguese), a couple of maids and fifteen-year-old Mary Ann Fairchild, orphaned daughter of Mary Parody from Catalan Bay and George Fairchild her English soldier husband. She was the Bishop’s laundress.\n\nSoon the Sisters took in boarders, mostly from Spain where Mother Teresa Ball’s old school friends from the Bar Convent in York, Elena Roberts, Teresa Magawley and Cristina Gordon, had long been urging her to set up an IBVM school for their children in that country; York and Rathfarnham were inconveniently far away. In later years Gibraltarian girls whose parents were away on business or who lived in Spain were also taken as boarders at the school in Europa.\n\nIn 1865 Sister Eustochium Norton arrived in Gibraltar from Killarney where five years earlier she had been one of the first members of that house and Mother Joseph Anne Hickey its first Superior. The first contingent of five Sisters had had to work very hard to transform the “Torc View Hotel” into a convent and boarding school. Killarney was Mother Teresa Ball’s last Foundation before she died.\n\nThe following year, 1866, nineteen-year-old Isabel Garcia from San Roque (later Sister Trinidad) entered with Loreto in Gibraltar.\n\nSt Joseph’s Church was now completed and a school for the district was set up in the crypt of the new Church. This consisted of a large room divided in two by a partition. The school, of course, was called St Joseph’s. Ellen Taylor (now Sister Scholastica) was the first nun to teach at St Joseph’s. She taught the girls in one half of the crypt and in the other half boys were taught by male lay teachers. Sixteen years later the Christian Brothers returned to Gibraltar in 1878 after an absence of forty-one years. From 1882 the boys at St Joseph’s, separated from the girls’ by a glass door, were taught by Brother Virgilius Jones.\n\n“As there was no private room in which to take her lunch, Sister Scholastica had to fast from her breakfast at 7.30 till her dinner at 3 pm. This continued for 14 years.”\n\nThe first books for the girls at St Joseph’s were again sent out from Rathfarnham.\n\n11: Superiors and Generals\n\nNow the Loreto nuns were established in a more salubrious part of the Rock. The snag was, however, that they were living right next door to the Bishop and his entourage. In the mid 1830s, ten years before the arrival of the Loreto nuns, the Christian Brothers had had their baptism of fire during their short two-year sojourn in Gibraltar. In the climate of the times it was even more difficult for women to maintain their independence from the men of power, whether bishops, clergy, school committees or governments. It appears that since their move to Europa Bishop Scandella began to take over the running of the Convent.\n\nAs far back as 1703, at the time of the Approbation of the 81 Rules of the Institute and well before the first Loreto community was set up in Ireland, there had been much discussion about the government of the IBVM and the position of the Chief Superior. Clement XI had informally closed the discussion with the words:\n\n“Lasciate governare le donne dalle donne”.\n\nOver a hundred years later the Loreto Sisters had not yet managed to establish their entitlement to self-government under their own Chief Superior and to freedom from intrusion into their affairs, despite the Papal Bulls\n\nPICTURE 9: Cottage on Europa Site\n\nPICTURE 10: Entrance to Gavino’s\n\n“Inscrutabili” and “Quamvis Justo” which had been issued by Clement XI in 1703 and Benedict XIV in 1749. At about the same time, in 1858, Mother Teresa Ball was having similar problems with various Bishops in Ireland and in Canada who, it appears, were encouraging some of the Loreto houses to sever links with their Mother House at Rathfarnham. According to the Rules confirmed by Benedict XIV\n\n“the Chief Superior must have full power over all the houses of our Institute.”\n\nMother Teresa felt she had to take a stand with regard to the jurisdiction of some of the houses by appealing directly to Rome. Pius IX upheld Mother Teresa’s position when she sent Mother Concepción Lopez as her delegate to the Holy See requesting a decision over the dispute about governance.\n\nIn Gibraltar too the Bishop was taking over, even interfering in and sometimes altering the little customs and traditions the Loreto sisters had brought with them from Rathfarnham. The Annals complain that:\n\n“Dr Scandella made himself Superior General of the nuns, and ruled with a rod of iron”.\n\nHe made the lives of some of the nuns miserable and even went so far as to refuse them absolution after confession.\n\nThe Bishop came to the refectory ‘on state days’, said grace and dined with the nuns. On those occasions Sister Eustochium Norton was always appointed to serve the meal. Isabel Garcia, now Sister Trinidad, was required to prepare the bath for the Bishop’s Secretary, Dr McAuliffe, when he took one. In the days before running water this would have entailed heating water and carrying it up to the Bishop’s quarters in buckets.\n\nOn the Eve of Receptions and Professions each Sister was consulted by the aspirant about her suitability to join their Community. For some reason black gloves were always worn and the occasion became known as “the Ceremony of the Black Gloves”. Dr Scandella now decided he would preside at these rituals.\n\nThe story goes that on one occasion in the late 1860s or early ‘70s, when Encarnación Fernandez from Cadiz was to be received, Sister Christina O’Neill would not come down for the ceremony; she said Sister Encarnación had no vocation and should not be received. The Bishop refused to go on with the ceremony until Sister Christina was present so he sent Mother Elizabeth Boylan to fetch her. Mother Elizabeth found Sister Christina in her cell and implored her to come down. Allowing herself to be persuaded she appeared at the refectory door to be greeted by His Lordship with:\n\n“Bad nun! Bad nun!”\n\nIn fact Encarnación left the house some time afterwards.\n\nHaving taken over the running of the Convent the Bishop now decided he wanted to appoint a lay administrator over the Superior to deal with the financial affairs of the Community. Of course the Superior, Mother Angela Kelly, would not consent to such an arrangement. She protested and wrote to Mother Teresa Ball in Rathfarnham.\n\nMother Angela Kelly in Gibraltar received no reply from Mother Teresa. Bishop Scandella persisted. Feeling she was getting no redress from Rathfarnham, Mother Angela, having been Superior in Gibraltar for some thirteen years, left the Convent with Mother Josephine Underhill and Sister Helena O’Hanlon. Together the three opened a High School for Girls in the town.\n\nMeanwhile, at Rathfarnham Mother Angela was expected at any time. A reply to her letter had in fact been sent and beds were ready for her and her companions. It appeared that – not for the first or last time – the nuns’ letters were being intercepted.\n\nMother Angela and her two companions are recorded in the Gibraltar Census of 1878 as living over what is now the Cannon Hotel in Cannon Lane. Their school in the town was well patronised. It was probably situated not far from where they lived, in the vicinity of Pitman’s Alley or College Lane, or even possibly in the building where they lived; there were other small ‘schools’ in the area which had nothing to do with Loreto. Many of the Gibraltarians sympathised with Mother Angela, so much so that when in 1895 the Golden Jubilee of the nuns’ arrival on the Rock came around Bishop Canilla felt it would be imprudent to celebrate the event publicly since “Mrs Kelly” was still alive. Many Gibraltarian families confused Bishop Scandella with the Institute and as a result were alienated from the Community for some time afterwards.\n\nWhat communication took place between Mother Angela Kelly and Loreto Abbey Rathfarnham before she took the final step of leaving the Institute is now unknown. A member of the Rathfarnham Community at the time, who was still living in the very early 1900s, assures us that:\n\n“She was so certainly expected to return there that\n\ncells were prepared for her and for her two\n\ncompanions.”\n\nMother Joseph Fitzpatrick was now sent from Rathfarnhamto replace the Superior who had left. When she arrived she was told that the Bishop had already appointed his own Superior, Mother StanislausCousse Murphy. Mother Joseph had been a member of the Bray Community. Without a word of protest she accepted the situation, and became Assistant Superior to Mother Stanislaus. Someone who knew her well wrote:\n\n“She was a holy and just woman, a model of every virtue and excelling in humility and obedience”.\n\nThe Bishop’s appointed Superior, Mother StanislausCousse Murphy,\n\n“…gave in to Bishop Scandella in everything, some said for love, others said through fear.”\n\nThere are stories of ‘tussles’ between this Bishop and the Loreto nuns, no doubt as a result of misconceptions about who filled what role in which sphere of influence. Mary Ward and Teresa Ball would have understood the difficulties!\n\nIn 1864 Dr Scandella initiated negotiations with the church authorities in Algeciras and they agreed to return the 15th century effigy of Our Lady of Europa which they had held since the Spanish exodus from Gibraltar in August 1704. The condition was that he would arrange for Algeciras to be given an exact replica of the image. The original was duly brought to Gibraltar where the Loreto Sisters looked after it from the time they arrived in Europa in 1864 (officially in January 1865) until the Little Sisters of the Poor arrived twenty years later in 1883. Loreto’s Boarding School and Convent was now renamed “Our Lady of Europa” after the image and shrine situated just behind the property.\n\nThe Bishop used frequently to come to Mother StanislausCousse Murphy for money to defray the costs of the many building projects under way, some on the Europa Road site where his plan for St Bernard’s College for boys was being developed, and others about the town, in particular the proposed new Sacred Heart Church. There are still people in Gibraltar who refer to it as ‘la iglesia nueva’ though it is now well over a hundred years old.\n\n12: Grand Bazaar\n\nThe Bishop now decided that the Loreto Community’s finances needed improvement. He advised the nuns to organize a bazaar. Bazaars were arranged now and again as a means of raising money. The children’s families worked hard to open a very successful bazaar which was held on November 7th 1866 at the Theatre Royal, permission having first of course been obtained from the Governor, Lieutenant General Sir Richard Airey. Contributions were received from the great and the good. Pope Pius IX sent a cameo; Queen Isabel II of Spain\n\n“…was quite distressed when told of the bazaar as she thought she had nothing just then sufficiently valuable to give, but remembering that she wore a girdle of rubies and diamonds she pulled it off and presented it to the Bishop saying, ‘My Lord, I regret having nothing better to offer’ ”.\n\nIn June 1869 an earthquake was felt in Gibraltar. It caused damage to a house in Church Street but no one was injured.\n\nBishop Scandella went to Rome that year to attend the First Vatican Council and while he was there he met the Portuguese Holy Ghost Fathers. During the 19th century the Portuguese economy faltered and Republicanism took hold, leading eventually to the abolition of the Monarchy in 1910 and the founding of a Democratic Republic. Bishop Scandella discovered that the Holy Ghost Fathers were about to leave Santarem because of the political turmoil in Portugal and he persuaded them to consider coming to Gibraltar to staff his proposed College for boys.\n\nIn connection with the Europa building site application had already been made to the Colonial Governmentand approved\n\n“to convert stores into a refectory for St. Bernard’s College, and to raise a storey over.”\n\nIn 1871 Bishop Scandella again sought permission to build on the Europa Road property. This was the year the Holy Ghost Fathers arrived to take charge of the boys’ college, “St Bernard’s”, named after the Patron Saint of Gibraltar. This time the request was for:\n\n“two small rooms for music classes”\n\nand\n\n“to build a coach house”.\n\nThe Holy Ghost Fathers had hoped to run the school and to open a scholasticate and a novitiate for their Brothers. Having left Santarem when anti-clerical feeling developed in Portugal during the political upheavals of the late 19th century they expected that after the recent similar suppression of Religious Orders and Catholic schools in Spain many Spanish students would seek to be educated on the Rock. Besides, Gibraltar might be a source of vocations for their mission in the Congo.\n\nHowever, their expectations remained unfulfilled, the Spanish students did not materialise, and the Fathers felt obliged to leave Gibraltar by the end of 1872. Since their withdrawal after less than two years in Gibraltar Bishop Scandella’s hopes for St Bernard’s College on the Europa site faded away, and the boys once again moved down to their old premises in Rosia Parade where, for the next six years, they were taught by some of the local priests and a few male lay teachers.\n\nThe departure of the Holy Ghost Fathers was a blow to the Bishop who had already invested a great deal of money in the Europa project. He had built extensively on the land leased for the College. It was later said that\n\n“grief for the failure of that College brought on softening of the brain of which he died.”\n\nThis illness towards the end of Dr Scandella’s life might account to some extent for the difficulties experienced by Loreto in its dealings with the Bishop.\n\nThe Loreto nuns had contributed financially towards the building of the Sacred Heart Church. They also contributed towards the development of the Europa Road site, though the lease for the latter remained in Dr Scandella’s name.\n\nIn January 1873 Bishop Scandella renewed the lease, The new contract stipulated that:\n\n“the vegetables and flower garden must be kept in cultivation”.\n\nSince by this time St Bernard’s School had moved off the premises and back to Rosia the care of this garden must have fallen to the Loreto nuns. In the past the cultivation and upkeep of vegetable gardens had been essential as Gibraltar discovered only too well during the numerous sieges, or latterly when “cordons sanitaires” were set up by Spain in order to prevent the spread of disease from Gibraltar into that country. These little gardens had helped alleviate shortages of green vegetables at such times in the past.\n\nOnce the Convent of Our Lady of Europa Boarding School was opened Spanish girls who had been at school in York and Rathfarnham (some the daughters and granddaughters of Mother Mary Teresa Ball’s school friends) now found the Convent on the Rock nearer home and they began to travel in from as far away as Tarifa, Cadiz, Seville and Malaga to enrol as boarders. The 1878 Census lists thirteen boarders at the school in Europa of whom four were Gibraltarians but whose parents were living in Spain or in England; the rest were Spanish. They were:\n\nRosa Eschauzier\n\nAna Rivera\n\nEnriqueta Bosistoro\n\nTeresa Gil\n\nPilar Martinez\n\nJosefa Martinez\n\nVicenta Martinez\n\nAntonia Martinez\n\nCarmen Martinez\n\nMaria Sancho\n\nRafaela Sancho\n\nConcepcion Abren\n\nIsabella Sanchez\n\nMarie Ondot, aged twenty-five, was engaged as “Governess” to improve the girls’ spoken French. She had been in Gibraltar since she was nineteen.\n\nOn some evenings and on Sundays there would be band concerts in the Alameda Gardens and whether or not they walked in the gardens the boarders and the nuns at the Europa convent would no doubt have heard some of the repertoire of music played by an eighty-strong military brass and string band. In any case the nuns would take their boarders for a weekly walk on Sundays, often in the Alameda, where the young people of the town would be amongst the great crowd promenading on summer evenings.\n\nIn the late 1870s Reverend Mother Scholastica Somers’ term of office as General Superior was drawing to a close. When Mother de Britto Longford and Mother Elizabeth Burke-Gaffney arrived in Gibraltar from Ireland they were clearly disturbed by the state of Loreto’s affairs on the Rock. The day after their arrival Mother de Britto and Mother Elizabeth wrote to Reverend Mother Scholastica, closing their letters. The letters were returned to them opened, and they were informed that Mother Stanislaus Cousse Murphy was now “Mother General” in Gibraltar, according to the Bishop.\n\nMother Elizabeth decided to try writing via her brother. One Sunday morning while taking the boarders for their weekly walk Mother Elizabeth put the unstamped letter into the red pillar box which used to be near Loreto Convent at the junction of South Barrack Road and Europa Road (opposite Brympton). Given the nuns’ earlier experiences of interference with their post the Gibraltar Annals record Mother Elizabeth’s anxiety:\n\n“Poor Mother Elizabeth couldn’t eat or sleep for a day or two fearing the letter would be returned by the Post Office. The answer was a letter from Reverend Mother Xaveria recalling her and bidding Mother Stanislaus accompany her.”\n\nIn 1873 Mother Agnes Fitzgerald, a trained National School teacher, arrived in Gibraltar and joined Mother Scholastica Taylor at St Joseph’s. A small piece of the extra classroom given to the nuns by Father Femenías was boarded off to make a place in which the Sisters could at last take their lunch instead of fasting from breakfast until school broke up for the day! Father Femenías also gave them a small patio which the girls could use as a playground.\n\n1873 was also the year that the Christian Brothers arrived in Gibraltar for the second time. Two years later Brother Virgilius Jones took over the teaching of the boys at St Joseph’s, while Mother Scholastica continued teaching the girls there, now with Mother Agnes, until 1879.\n\nBishop Scandella died on July 27th 1880\n\n“… having made education his particular concern”.\n\nIt is undoubtedly true that Bishop Scandella was as passionate for the educational welfare of the children of Gibraltar as had been Dr Hughes. During his tenure of office he employed many more teachers, opened St Bernard’s Boys’ School at Rosia Parade, founded the Conference of St. Vincent de Paul in 1860 and pressed them to foster the education of children. The St Vincent de Paul Society, at the Bishop’s instigation, opened schools at Catalan Bay (whence Mary Ann Fairchild was recruited to be the Bishop’s laundress three years later), Lime Kiln Road, and two in the crypt of St. Joseph‘s Church.\n\nIt is unfortunate that in his attempts to provide education for Gibraltar’s children Bishop Scandella appears to have overstretched himself financially. Nevertheless his ‘memorials’ stand: the new churches, the many schools, and – with the indisputable achievements, sometimes underrated in the history books, of the Loreto nuns – a more robust foundation for a public educational system in Gibraltar.\n\nBishop Scandella was also instrumental in bringing back the Christian Brothers in 1878, after their initial two-year period in Gibraltar some forty years earlier. This time they returned having first agreed a clear and unambiguous contract with the Bishop. They had learned their lesson – not only in Gibraltar – and\n\n“…had had enough of being at the mercy of every successive patron or committee who assumed the responsibility of management of the financial and other affairs of the school”.\n\nDr Scandella was certainly very proud of the standard of education provided for the girls by the Loreto nuns. He felt that Our Lady of Europa Convent School compared very favourably with any good school in any European capital city, and the Annals record the successes during the annual inspections of the Government schools run by the Loreto nuns. Loreto offered quality education in all its schools and took every opportunity to have the Sisters properly trained, and sometimes certificated.\n\n“An organiser spent three months at Dalkey in the free school. She prepared every lesson the preceding evening and taught 150 day pupils without using a book. The Free children have great advantages for\n\nPicture 11: Pupils at Gavino’s\n\nPicture 12: Utopia Painting\n\nmental arithmetic, geography and parsing. The school requisites, given gratis by the Board, are of the first order – books, maps, etc. The organiser is paid by the Board, no expense to the Free School.”\n\nAnd later:\n\n“Two of our professed sisters went from\n\nLoretto, Manchester, to Liverpool with Very Reverend. Canon Toole to be examined during five days, for a certificate.”\n\n13: Putting Things Right\n\nWhen the Bishop died it was found that the lease on the Europa Road property had been drawn up in favour of Dr Scandella “and his heirs”. Legally the property devolved, therefore, on Miss Scandella. She appreciated that the wording of her brother’s Will was flawed and immediately passed on the property to the Church. In the confusion, however, the Loreto nuns were never remunerated for their loans to the Bishop which over time had amounted to some £6,000.\n\nIt was only in 1880 shortly before the death of Dr Scandella that the full import of the affairs of Loreto in Gibraltar came to light in Ireland. Earlier letters to Rathfarnham had been written by Mother Angela Kelly (who had since left the Convent and set up a school in the town), Mother de Britto Longford and Mother Elizabeth Gaffney. Some of these letters had certainly been intercepted as they were returned opened. There had apparently been no replies to the rest and there had therefore been no regular communication with the Mother House for some years. For most of the period new entrants to the Institute in Gibraltar had not been coming from Rathfarnham; many had entered locally and appear to have been Gibraltarians and Spaniards who were mostly past pupils; occasionally an Irish girl living in Gibraltar would ask to be received.\n\nOn 3rd January 1880 Mother Xaveria Fallon was elected third General Superior of Loreto succeeding Reverend Mother Scholastica Somers.\n\nSix months later, as soon as possible after Bishop Scandella’s death, Mother StanislausCousse Murphy took steps to re-unite the Community at Gibraltar with the Mother House in Rathfarnham. This suggests that in agreeing to the restrictions of Bishop Scandella’s rule over the nuns Mother Stanislaus had found herself in an impossible position. Should she accept the situation? Or should she leave the Convent as Mother Angela Kelly and her companions had done? Mother Stanislaus’ course of action was simply different from Mother Angela’s; neither had the ideal solution, but each had presumably acted according to her best judgement at the time.\n\nMother Stanislaus Cousse Murphy and Mother Elizabeth Burke Gaffney set off for Ireland in the summer of 1880 immediately after the death of Bishop Scandella. After a short stay in Ireland Mother Stanislaus returned to Gibraltar bringing back with her two young nuns.From this date the Gibraltar Community was once again subject to the Chief Superior at Rathfarnham which again began supplying Sisters for the schools on the Rock.\n\nThere was a great deal of controversy when on 8th March 1881 Reverend Gonzalo Canilla was appointed to succeed Dr Scandella, who had died the previous June. Bishop Canilla returned from England after his consecration to face a groundswell of opposition headed by the Junta of Elders. With their supporters they prevented him taking up office on his arrival. His opponents felt very strongly that they would prefer to have a non-Gibraltarian as their next Bishop, giving as one of their reasons that the Church Funds\n\n“had been inefficiently administered in the past by Bishop Scandella”.\n\nFor several months there were violent scenes in Church Street as the new Bishop was repeatedly denied access to his Cathedral. After considerable diplomatic efforts involving Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Derby, and the Governor Lord Napier of Magdala, the military and police were at last ordered to intervene. Eventually Bishop Canilla’s inauguration took place privately – almost furtively – on November 27th 1880 at Loreto Convent in the Shrine of Our Lady of Europa. The storm nevertheless raged on until March 1882, and even after that some Gibraltarians preferred to attend Mass in La Linea rather than be seen at the Cathedral. In due course tempers cooled as Bishop Canilla patiently and persistently worked to win over the people of Gibraltar, taking every opportunity to bring about reconciliation with his opponents. In the end he succeeded.\n\nHe was later remembered for his frequent visits to all the schools and his attempts at getting to know the children individually. On one occasion, after a long strike by the very poorly paid coal heavers, he organised the distribution to poor families (via their children at school) of a quantity of mutton that must have been donated by a charitable butcher! Emilia Cocklan, not particularly poor, put up her hand for ‘her’ share. When she arrived home with her prize she was roundly told off for diverting the goods from their intended destination. The mutton was immediately cut into portions and the little girl was required by her father to deliver the parcels to several of the families whose fathers were known to be on strike or out of work.\n\nBishop Canilla continued to develop the projects initiated by his predecessors, especially in the field of education.He was thirty-two at the time of his appointment and for the rest of his life until his death in 1898 he remained the firm supporter and friend of Loreto in Gibraltar.\n\nThe new Bishop now gave to the nuns Bishop Scandella’s part of the Europa premises. The house in Europa was becoming too small for the increasing number of boarders. Some of the areas of the previous bishop’s house were converted into cells and the old laundry became a second Community Room. The pupils at the town schools were also growing in number as was the Community itself. Until 1882 nuns from Europa had served the girls’ free and fee-paying schools in the town but transport being difficult the Superiors in Ireland decided that a second Community should be formed in the town. Mother Ignatius Byrne from Europa was appointed Superior of the new Town Convent. It was opened on September 1st 1882 and was dedicated to St Francis Xavier. There were now two Loreto Communities in Gibraltar and this remained the case until the Second World War.\n\nIn 1883 Doctor Canilla founded a new home for elderly men and women over sixty, of all creeds, who had little means of support. This was built near the shrine to Our Lady of Europa, yards to the south and east of the Loreto Sisters’ original ‘cottage’. It could accommodate seventy persons. The Bishop invited twelve Little Sisters of the Poor to run the home; when they moved in they took over from the Loreto sisters the care of the shrine to Our Lady of Europa.\n\nA building in Johnston’s Passage was now made available to the Church and Bishop Canilla asked the Loreto nuns to run a free school there for infant girls and boys. St Mary’s Infants opened here in 1885.\n\nThe following year Mother StanislausCousse Murphy returned to Ireland. For her next assignment she was offered the choice of returning to Gibraltar or going to India. She chose to go to India and was there until 1887.\n\nMother Pius Ward came to Gibraltar on Visitation that same year and remained as Superior until 1888. Her brief appears to have been to bring the organisation of Loreto in Gibraltar back into line with the accepted routines at Rathfarnham. She wasn’t able to do much in a year, but she made things a little easier for her successor Mother Stanislaus Murphy Gould, who went on to become Provincial of Spain after her period of office in Gibraltar.\n\nJane Murphy Gould had entered Rathfarnham from Cork. Her education began at the Mercy Convent in her native city, continued in Rathfarnham and was completed in the Institute’s House in Munich, one of Mary Ward’s early foundations which had survived since 1626. As Mother Stanislaus Murphy Gould she had been Superior of the Letterkenny and Killarney Houses and had founded Kenilworth Square in Dublin before setting out for Gibraltar in 1881.\n\nMother Xaveria Fallon, now General Superior, observed to Mother Stanislaus on her departure from Ireland:\n\n“You are going as Superior to Gibraltar, but that will only pave the way for the Spanish foundation.”\n\nJane Murphy Gould arrived in Gibraltar with Mother Xaveria’s words ringing in her ears. In Gibraltar the number of pupils at St Joseph’s School continued to increase and the Church Crypt was no longer suitable. In 1885 St Joseph’s district was raised to the status of Parish, and Monsignor Femenías, now Parish Priest, gave a basement room of his house to the Loreto nuns as a classroom for the bigger girls.\n\nBy 1886 as pupil numbers at the town fee-paying day school continued to increase new premises were again sought. Attempts were made to buy land to build a suitable convent and school, but the Sisters’ efforts came to nothing and still the numbers grew.\n\nPICTURE 13: Utopia Photo\n\nPICTURE 14: Loreto Europa 1893\n\n14: Gavino’s Passage, Cornwall’s Lane\n\nAt last in May 1888 a new house was rented in Gavino’s Passage, just off Cornwall’s Lane. Fortunately the building was not yet finished so alterations could be made to render it suitable for the requirements of a school and a convent. Here is a description of the house written a few years later:\n\n“At the entrance there is a very fine patio or\n\ncourtyard tastefully planted with flowers and shrubs. At the end of this patio there is a large statue of Our Lady of Lourdes in a pretty grotto covered with creeping plants. To the left another little grotto is seen which is dedicated to St Joseph. Opposite the hall door there is a sort of vestibule which has been converted into an oratory of the Sacred Heart. It is hung with crimson curtains and tastefully adorned with plants.\n\nThe schools and Convent are remarkable for their brightness and gaiety. On all sides religious objects meet the eye. The walls are hung with illuminated sentences which suggest holy thoughts. The Chapel, Oratory of the Blessed Virgin and Sacristy occupy one portion of the building; the nuns’ cells, Community Room, etc., another. The first floor is entirely devoted to school rooms.\n\nEnglish is the language of the school, but there is some difficulty in having it spoken conscientiously as Spanish is the language most familiar to all.\n\nChristian Doctrine is taught and the religious instruction given in Spanish as otherwise the younger and less advanced pupils could not grasp the full meaning of the knowledge most essential for them.\n\nA good library has been opened for the pupils, which has been the means of developing a taste for literature amongst them, also a depôt in connection with the Catholic Truth Society. From this latter many beneficial results are hoped for amongst the English speaking portion of the population.”\n\nGetting the girls to speak in English during school hours was an uphill task in all the schools since Spanish was the everyday language of most homes and therefore the language the girls found easiest to slip into during informal conversations amongst themselves. At the Boarding School at Europa there was the additional difficulty of teaching the Spanish pupils in English, a language with which in most cases they had had no contact at all.\n\nPast pupils from the Government schools who are now in their eighties and nineties also remember cards on the walls – rather like the ‘illuminated sentences’ mentioned above – stating:\n\n“English is the language of the school.”\n\nThe excerpt quoted earlier continues by saying that a very fine building had just been completed for the Government for use as a school placed under the charge of the St Francis Xavier Community. This was St Mary’s Elementary School on Hospital Hill, near the Infants’ School in Johnston’s Passage. About seven hundred children were in daily attendance there. St Mary’s Elementary School opened in 1890.\n\n“The early hardships and indefatigable labours of the Sisters to spread the Gospel of Christ in a town where owing to its commercial importance so many different races are being so constantly mingled will, we trust, entitle them to that reward which is promised unto those who ‘instruct others unto justice’.”\n\nEfforts to encourage children to practise their English continued down the years. Children in the playgrounds of the Infant Schools could be heard singing their ring games, mostly in Spanish, no doubt picked up from the many Spanish women who were now becoming the mothers of Gibraltarian families. But, with the moves to promote the speaking of English, attempts had obviously been made to teach the children English ring games, sometimes with idiosyncratic results. A favourite is still known locally as\n\n“Sany sany wosha …”\n\nIt takes some decoding to discern the original English:\n\n“Sonny, are you washed?”\n\n“Mother, washed are we.\n\nAnd wee sonny baby –\n\nHe cries for thee…”\n\nClearly a typical example of Victorian methods of teaching basic hygiene through song! Alas, it was lost on most Gibraltar children.\n\nIn Loreto Europa Mother Pius Ward succeeded Mother StanislausCousse Murphy as Superior. The latter returned to Ireland and then volunteered to go to Calcutta. Mother Pius’ special mission was to continue bringing the customs and observances of Europa into conformity with those of the Mother House in Rathfarnham.\n\nThe town Community at Gavino’s Passage was now responsible for running St Mary’s Elementary and St Mary’s Infants schools in Hospital Ramp and in nearby Johnston’s Passage as well as its own day school in the convent itself, St Francis Xavier’s.\n\nSoon the entire education of the girls of Gibraltar at both Elementary and Secondary level, both free and fee-paying, and of all the Infant boys up to the age of seven was in the hands of the Loreto nuns. They surely played a leading role in contributing to the development of Gibraltarian character.\n\n15: Highwaymen and Convent Girls\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century a great deal of smuggling took place in the area, both at sea in the Strait and on land in the surrounding area in Spain. Gibraltar was ideally situated as a base for the middlemen in this enterprise. Spain imposed high tariffs on imported tobacco and Gibraltar was a free port, so tobacco was a favourite commodity for smuggling into Spain and cigar-making became a cottage industry in Gibraltar. The export of these goods from Gibraltar was perfectly legal; not so their importation to Spain. The smuggler gangs often engaged in a little highway robbery as a sideline.\n\nVictoria Lassaletta (IBVM Spanish Province), whose family lived in Jerez, told me this story about her grandmother. In the 1860s Dolores Sanjuán y Toro, aged seven, travelled “by diligence” from Jerez to Puerto de Santa María, where she embarked for Gibraltar to attend school as a boarder at Loreto College, Europa. The coach journey took them along the road from Jerez to Puerto de Santa Maria and on to Cadiz. They passed through El Pinar de Coy, where some of the notorious “bandoleros” (highwaymen and smugglers) hid out, notably Diego Corrientes and his posse.The coachman would always carry a bag of gold coins to pay the horseman who would inevitably turn up to collect fees for allowing the diligence safe passage through the mountains. Horseman and coach driver, with his young charge, would then bid one another farewell and continue their respective journeys.\n\n“It was just an elaborate way of begging”, says Victoria. “They were poor people.”\n\nPoor little Dolores, having braved the bandits, arrived at Gibraltar for the first time to be welcomed by the Gibraltar Community – and was immediately taken into the chapel to see the laid out body of one of the nuns who had recently died! This could only have been either Sister Placida Byrne – one of those who arrived in 1845 – or Sister Joseph Anne Hickey; they were the only two who died in Gibraltar in the 1860s. Dolores survived the experience and was a pupil of Loreto Gibraltar for some years to come.\n\nToday the journey by car from Jerez to Gibraltar might take three hours at most, from Ronda two hours, from Malaga slightly less. In those days roads were bad and travel was dangerous; even the journey to Gibraltar was difficult for the Spanish pupils. An hour’s journey by car today would have taken half a day on horseback or by diligence. Spanish friends of Mother Teresa Ball continually pleaded with her for a foundation somewhere in the Cadiz region. To this end in 1887 Mother Stanislaus Murphy Gould, Mother Ignatius Byrne and Mother Paul Burke set out with Doña Javiera Romero, a Gibraltarian supporter and friend, to visit the surviving Miss Fallon at the school in Cadiz. By the following year Loreto was ready to return to Spain for a second attempt at a permanent foundation there.\n\n“On May 30th 1888 the pioneers of the new foundation in Spain M Stanislaus Ward, M Gonzaga Flood, SM Dolours and Miss Flood left Gibraltar for Puerto de Santa Maria. Their personal luggage and anything that could be spared from Europa arrived that same evening. On September 16th M Stanislaus Murphy, M Joseph Anne McEvoy, who had lived in Gibraltar as a very young nun, where she learned Spanish, M Columbanus O’Shea, M Matthew McMullan, M Afra Doyle, M Thomas Brophy, M Martina O’Brien and M Presentation Walsh arrived from Ireland and Gibraltar.”\n\nPICTURE 15: Dormitory, Europa\n\nPICTURE 16: Advert Europa\n\nThe young Mother Hildegarde Galbally in her early days in Gibraltar had heard the senior Sisters speak deprecatingly of the 1888 Foundation in Spain.\n\n“They took everything – even the clothes-line!”\n\nLater that year news was received of Mother Stanislaus Cousse Murphy whom Bishop Scandella had made “Mother General in Gibraltar” had died in Calcutta.\n\nMother Joseph Finn was now Superior in Europa and discussions were taking place at a meeting of the General Council in Rathfarnham to consider whether to close down the Convent at Europa. It was decided that it should be kept on if Bishop Canilla could allow the nuns to have it rent free.\n\nSister Ermenilda Gleeson arrived in Gibraltar in 1889. It was a busy year for the Institute worldwide. The canonisation of Mary Ward (1585 – 1645) was discussed at the Bar Convent in York and Mother Michael Corcoran, who had succeeded Mother Xaveria Fallon as General Superior of Loreto, was consulted. There were also discussions about a General Union of all the IBVM houses now present in every continent; the Institute had become fractured during the previous two hundred years partly due to political elements within the Church manipulating local events and partly as a result of the disruption to communications caused by the long European wars.\n\nOn August 6th 1890 Mother Josephine Richardson died aged forty-two. She had been in Gibraltar for sixteen years. The following year Sister Mary of Angels Colohan arrived from Ireland in time to witness the Utopia disaster, an event which lingers on in Gibraltar’s collective memory even into the 21st century.\n\n16: Disaster in the Bay of Gibraltar\n\nOn Tuesday March 17th 1891 Emilia Cocklan, whose father was a diver, was celebrating her eighth birthday. That evening a crowd gathered along Line Wall despite the dreadful weather. A gale was blowing and the wind and the thunder were deafening. It had been a long time since Gibraltar had experienced such a storm. Rain poured into all the houses with leaking roofs; buckets, tins, and all possible receptacles were used to collect the drips. When the wind dropped, the horrifying screams of terrified people could be heard. Then the searchlights from the battleships in the Bay picked out the SS Utopia and those of her passengers who were desperately climbing the rigging in their bid to escape the sinking ship.\n\nThe searchlights and the sounds of ships’ sirens would certainly have been seen and heard from the Convent in Europa; it might have taken longer for the Town Convent to hear about what had happened. Along the Line Wall the stunned onlookers heard and watched in horror as they began to understand the enormity of what was taking place. The driving force of the wind had rammed the Utopia on to the bows of HMS Anson. A gaping hole was cut into the ship’s side, and most of the nine hundred Italian emigrants aboard were facing death. Many small boats attempted in vain to rescue those passengers who had managed to get into the water, or on to the upper deck, or into the rigging, but the waves and the roaring winds kept the little boats away.\n\nWithin minutes Jimmy Cocklan was down in the bay helping the men in the rescue boats; he saw bodies blown out of the ship to come crashing down into the sea. Moments later dead bodies were floating face down in the water, beaten about by the violent waves. In seventeen minutes, six hundred and eighty of the nine hundred passengers were dead.\n\nThe SS Utopia was a small ship, packed to the gunwales with passengers and crew. It had left Trieste in Italy only a few days earlier with nine hundred poor emigrants bound for a better life in Argentina.\n\nNext morning, Wednesday March 18th, the storm had abated and the day dawned bright, sunny and – ‘innocent’. People in Waterport Street were distressed by the sight of so many poor people sitting along the pavements with their heads in their hands. These were some of the survivors of the previous night’s storm and its tragic consequences. The authorities and many ordinary people in Gibraltar, including Giuseppe Codali, did what they could to alleviate the sufferings of the survivors.\n\nThe event left its mark on Gibraltar for many years. People would not eat fish for months. Divers were employed by the salvage company to retrieve any valuable cargo on board, whether freight or small items from the Captain‘s and the Purser’s safes. These would have contained important personal items belonging to the passengers and crew such as jewellery and important documents deposited there for safekeeping. The divers also had to prepare the ship to be re-floated. Jimmy Cocklan told lurid tales of dead bodies floating towards the divers as they moved around under water within the ship’s hull, and of unscrupulous colleagues who cut rings off dead fingers, or stole lengths of silk from the hold by wrapping the material around their bodies as they helped themselves to the ship’s apparel and fittings and to the personal effects of the dead.\n\nThe next day from the terrace in Europa the nuns and the boarders would have been able to see the masts of the sunken ship and all the activity of the tugs and the salvage men as they worked on the wreck. Some of the pupils in St Joseph’s and the town schools were the children of rescue and salvage workers, divers and sailors, members of the Port Department, Dockyard officials and others who had been involved in one way or another with the events of the previous evening. The disaster would have been discussed for some time to come.\n\nIn 1892 Mother Angelica Canny moved from the town convent at Gavino’s to Europa as Superior. The following June Mother Agnes Fitzgerald died aged thirty-seven. She had been in Gibraltar for nineteen years since the age of eighteen.\n\nIn educational circles in Ireland and England there was talk of introducing registration for teachers and it was thought that soon it might be necessary for teachers to train and qualify. Reverend Mother Michael Corcoran and two Sisters from Rathfarnham visited the English IBVM nuns at Haverstock Hill in London to discuss the matter and to make plans. In that connection two Loreto Sisters who were Arts students were sent to Cambridge in 1894 to receive training.\n\nIn Gibraltar St Joseph’s and St Mary’s were now receiving financial aid from the Colonial Government; a condition was that an official yearly assessment must be carried out by qualified Inspectors. This was no problem for the nuns, whose results were greatly praised by the appointed officials. Mother Agnes Fitzgerald’s valuable skills and training had helped to maintain the high standards set by Loreto for the education of girls in Gibraltar. In December of the following year Mother Francis Hennessy died at the age of eighty after having lived and taught in Gibraltar for forty-eight years.\n\nIn 1895 the Loreto sisters celebrated the Golden Jubilee of their arrival on the Rock, albeit in a low key following Bishop Canilla’s advice. “Mrs Kelly” who as Mother Angela Kelly had been the first Superior of the Gibraltar Community at their first Convent, “St Aloysius”, was still living in the town and it was felt that public celebrations might not be appropriate. Mother Augustine Armstrong died that year aged forty-three. The sisters had lost three of their number in"
