        "text": "My thesis evaluates the educational practice of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini (1850-1917). Cabrini, a schoolteacher from Lombardy, founded the Institute of Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (MSC) in Codogno, Italy in 1880. When she died, a United States citizen in Chicago, USA, she had established 70 houses in Europe and the Americas. One thousand women had joined the MSC. Her priority was to work with some of the estimated thirteen million Italians who emigrated between 1880 and 1915. The literature review considers the relatively little work in the history of education on Catholic educational practice. The research addresses three questions: 1. How did Mother Cabrini understand Catholic educational practice? 2. How can Mother Cabrini’s understanding of Catholic educational practice be seen in the work of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? 3. How far did Mother Cabrini develop a coherent approach to...\n\nFocusing on Maria Montessori’s efforts to obtain official endorsement and financial support from Pope Benedict XV, this essay analyzes the Italian educator’s attempts to create an organization that would serve children distressed by war. Although such an organization was consistent with the initiatives promoted by the papacy during the First World War, the association Montessori envisioned was never created. Only one of the numerous letters and reports Montessori and her collaborators sent to the Pontiff actually reached him. This study argues that Monsignor Umberto Benigni intercepted and blocked the material. Through an analysis of archival materials and newspaper articles, it also demonstrates Benigni’s longstanding opposition to the educator’s initiatives. By drawing an exhaustive picture of the complex relationship between Montessori and the members of the Catholic Church throughout the 1910s and 1920s, this article furthermore sheds light on Montessori’s work in Catholic Cataluña, her collaboration with numerous prelates to develop activities for the moral growth of the child, and the complex relationship the educator had with Catholic intellectuals.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, many Italian intellectuals opposed women’s participation in the public sphere, maintaining that women could not engage in politics due to their exclusive love for their biological children. Contemporary feminists countered this notion by promoting the idea of social motherhood. Sibilla Aleramo and Maria Montessori, better known for their work in feminist literature and early childhood education, respectively, made important contributions to this debate by implementing, theorizing, and popularizing the notion of social motherhood. This essay traces the strategies the two intellectuals used to demonstrate how women could act as political subjects via a socialization of the maternal functions. In her novel Una donna, Aleramo offered a fictional portrait of the social mother. Influenced by it and by the feminist debate on motherhood, Montessori conceptualized the notion of social motherhood as both a socialization of maternal duties and the expansion of women’s maternal virtues into the social world. Montessori also applied this notion to her first pedagogical experiments in San Lorenzo (Rome) and with the orphans of the 1908 Messina-Reggio earthquake. An analysis of these intellectuals’ formerly overlooked contributions provides a new understanding of the role of social motherhood in the contemporary feminist debate in Italy.\n\nMontessori education has a long history, but its recent growth in American public schools has led to increased interest in research efforts, particularly in exploring the potential of the Montessori experience to moderate the effects of poverty and in gathering data to evaluate public investment in Montessori schools. To assist research efforts, this paper introduces a comprehensive visual model, or logic model, that depicts the core components, underlying assumptions, and intended outcomes of the Montessori approach. Logic modeling, which results in a visual representation depicting the connections among a program’s inputs, primary activities, and outcomes, is often used in program planning and research to provide a common framework from which to work. Developed over a 3-year period by a collaborative group of experienced Montessori researchers and practitioners, the Logic Model for Montessori Education presented in this paper is a valuable tool for researchers with the potential t..."
