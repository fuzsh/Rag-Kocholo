        "text": "The Hon. Catherine Dillon and her cousin Anne Nevill were Benedictine nuns in the French community of Montargis, which came to Bodney Hall in Norfolk early in 1793. There, near the Bedingfelds at Oxburgh and somewhat further from the Jerninghams at Cossey, the nuns educated young ladies in ‘every branch of useful knowledge becoming the delicacy of their sex.’ Letters from Catherine Dillon (Sr. St. François) and Anne Nevill (Sr. Ste. Agnès de Ste. Thérèse), written from Bodney to Lady Jerningham and Lady Bedingfeld during the period 1795 to 1806, can be found in the Jerningham collection at the University of Birmingham and at the Stafford Record Office. Egerton Castle's two-volume Jerningham Letters, published in 1896, draws upon the large collection of letters written to Lady Bedingfeld, but does not include any letters from her aunt Sr. François or her cousin Sr. Thérèse. Sr. François Dillon was Lady Jerningham's only surviving sister. Sr. Thérèse Nevill was Lady Jerningham's cousin and a sister of Cosmas Nevill of Nevill Holt.\n\n64 Pp. 116–117, Elegies and Other Small Poems by Matilda Betham, printed at Ipswich and sold at London and Ipswich, dedication dated 20 November 1797, includes at the end an advertisement for her father the Rev. William Betham's Genealogies of Sovereigns and his forthcoming four-volume Baronetage. Miss Betham's volume is dedicated to Lady Jerningham: ‘That you may long, very long, continue to bless your family, to adorn your rank, and console the unhappy, is the sincere prayer of Your Ladyship's most obliged humble servant, Matilda Betham.’ Matilda Betham's Poems and Elegies have been republished as part of the Garland Series on Romantic Context: Poetry: Significant Minor Poetry, 1789–1830, selected and arranged by Donald H. Reiman, the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library (New York and London: Garland, 1978). ‘Somewhat like Anna Jane Vardill, who published a sequel to Christabel in 1815 (see Reiman, D. H. in The Wordsworth Circle, VI [1975], 283–289),Google Scholar Betham is remembered chiefly as a hanger-on in London literary circles,’ (Introduction to Betham, Poems and Elegies, p. ix.)\n\n68 Princethorpe, p. 108: In the early days at Princethorpe, in the 1830s, ‘A French priest from the Cathedral of Arras, M. Carpue, offered to finish and furnish at his own expense a suite of rooms for himself and his two maiden sisters. The arrangement proved very advantageous, and they lived there for many years. Their friendliness attracted visitors from round about, and among the most frequent was the celebrated Mother Margaret Hallahan, the future foundress of the Dominican Convent at Stone. She was at that time keeping house for the Rev. Dr. Ullathorne at St. Osburg's, Coventry. Many an anecdote was told of ‘Sister Margaret’ (as she was then called), and her friends, the Carpues, who never failed to encourage her charity. She would spend many an hour soothing the old ladies’ scruples and worries.’\n\n96 C.R.S. 17, p. 172, School List of the Sepulchrines at New Hall; Anne, Fremantle, ed., The Wynne Diaries (Oxford University Press, 1935), 3, pp. 120, 128.Google Scholar In 1788 Lady Theresa Plunkett, only dau. of Arthur James, seventh Earl of Fingall and Henrietta Maria Woolascot, married James Dease, Esq., of Turbotston (son of Garrett Dease, Esq., of Turbotston who m. 1740 Susan, dau. and coheir of Oliver Plunkett, Esq., of Rathmore Castle, co.

Burke's Landed Gentry 1882.\n\nIn 1808 Lady Bedingfeld at Bath was acquainted with ‘Lady Theresa Dease, sister to Lord Fingali, about 44. A most pleasing woman, with 4 good humoured daughters, 2 only come out.’ Castle, 1, p. 326. In February 1809 Lady Jerningham wrote: ‘The Browne family dined with us yesterday, and Lady Teresa Dease and her daughter. Lady Teresa is sister to Lord Fingali, a widow with four daughters and two sons, the eldest now of age and the other at Old Hall Green. She is, without having ever been handsome, the most genteel pleasing woman that can be imagined. She was brought up at the Abbaye aux Bois. The match the most proper that could take place would be Lady Teresa and Lord Kenmare: birth, age, everything suitable. I wish some entremetteuse would arrange it.’ Castle, 1, p. 334. Valentine Browne, Earl of Kenmare, whose first wife had been the Hon. Charlotte Dillon, Lady Jerningham's youngest sister, on 4 September 1808 had lost his second wife, Mary Aylmer, of Lyons, Kildare. He died 3 October 1812 at 58 without marrying again.

SRO P/3/10/133, Preston, Sep. 8, 1802, Edward Jerningham to Lady Jerningham: ‘… On Sunday next however I leave Preston, and am extremely sorry to be under the absolute necessity of going up to London for 24 hours, in order to receive four thousand pounds on account of Mrs. Porter's executorship. I must distribute it immediately to the different legatees, who from being ignorant of business, are clamorous against me….’ SRO P/3/10/134, Lincoln's Inn Sep. 16, 1802, Edward Jerningham to Lady Jerningham: ‘… I enclose two drafts for £20 each, the one is on my own account, the other is your legacy for a ring,’ SRO P/3/10/135, Lincoln's Inn, Sep. 17, 1802, Edward Jerningham to Lady Jerningham: ‘… I have just received four thousand pounds on Mrs. Porter's account, and shall be all tomorrow writing drafts and discharging legacies.’\n\n126 Bellenger, p. 267: Jean François Elloi de Malancourt, b. 1752, had lived at Canterbury c. 1794—c.1798; was chaplain at Bodney c. 1805; was at Maynooth 1808; then at Acton Burnell and Downside with the Benedictines until his death, 1809–1824. Bellenger quotes Fanny Burney's diary, in a passage written around the time of her husband General Alexandre d'Arblay's death, which occurred at Bath May 1818: ‘Good Dr. Elloi again spent the morning with me. We were chiefly tête à tête… The worthy man, with many gentle apologies, entered upon religious topics. I heard him with real reverence, but took the first opportunity to let him see clearly that I was a hopeless subject as a convert, that I am a Protestant upon principle, and that such I should remain. He openly regretted not having had opportunity to instil into the spirit of my departed angel a desire to change his son to follow the Roman Catholic faith … He discourses in a truly Christian style, as conceiving the path of salvation open to both religions,’ (Burney Diaries V, ed. Dobson, p. 373)."
