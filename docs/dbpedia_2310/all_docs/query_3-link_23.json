        "text": "Putting the Whole in Holistic: Improving SEM Delivery through Applied Psychology & Systems Thinking\n\nThis paper was presented at the 2020 ACEEE Summer Study in Energy Efficiency in Buildings by Kjell van Zoen and Dave Hall.\n\nSEM is often referred to as “a holistic approach” to energy efficiency in an organization. Kjell and Dave take a dive into what this means, and they offer insights and best practices to improve program participation and drive increased energy savings.\n\nThis paper outlines details on retrofitting constant volume systems to variable volume systems using Advanced RTU Controls. It explores the following:\n\nWhere these retrofits are happening\n\nThe economics of retrofitting\n\nPresent obstacles to overcome\n\nControl methods, options and results\n\nCost-effectively verifying savings\n\nResults from hundreds of system retrofits, including: trend data, pre- and post-metered data\n\nEnd-user feedback after system retrofit\n\nKey takeaways for the reader will be to:\n\nUnderstand that there is now significant and cost-effective energy savings opportunity for packaged RTUs\n\nShare experiences in approaching a difficult market to engage\n\nExplore control options, retrofit methods and configurations\n\nThis paper documents Energy 350’s challenges, learnings, and technology solutions that we’ve discovered since Oregon’s legalization of recreational cannabis in 2015. The intent of this paper is to share knowledge and accelerate the learning process for states recently legalized or facing legalization. This paper will share breakthroughs in the following areas:\n\nHow to remove heat caused by dehumidification from the growing environment, which is typically dominated by the need to cool.\n\nHow to mitigate challenges in balancing indoor environment plant needs, which are CO2 enriched and clean, with traditional efficient HVAC design, which relies upon free or efficient cooling in cool weather without introducing impure air into the growing space and exhausting unacceptable amounts of CO2.\n\nHow to engage a historically unorthodox population of growers with little access to capital and even less time to consider efficiency.\n\nBuilding upon a successful direct-install campaign to better understand the energy savings potential of Tier 2 Power Strips, PG&E explored a retail delivery model in 2017. By offering Tier 2 products at a discount to over 1,000 select PG&E customers and following up with a 2-month post-install survey, we were able to answer critical questions needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of a future utility program retail delivery model. This paper will explore the Tier 2 promotion and survey methodology and present findings from the post-install survey to help answer several important program specific questions, such as:\n\nWhat was the initial installation rate and persistence over time?\n\nWhat reasons were given for removing the device over the 2-month post-install period?\n\nHow easy was the installation using the manufacturer provided instructions?\n\nHow satisfied were customers overall with the power strip?\n\nIs there a relationship between customer demographics and persistence?"
