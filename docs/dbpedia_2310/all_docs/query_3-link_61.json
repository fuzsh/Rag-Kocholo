        "text": "Addresses to Cardinal Newman with His Replies, etc.\n\nFrom the Jesuit Community, St. Beuno's College, North Wales\n\nFeb. 21, 1879.\n\nDEAR FATHER NEWMAN,\n\nThe good news that reached us yesterday, that the Holy Father has laid at your Reverence's feet the highest {2} honours of the Church, has caused us so much pleasure that we cannot refrain from sending you a few lines to express our heartfelt joy at the welcome announcement. It is by a happy coincidence that we are able at the same time to convey to you our sincere congratulations on the occasion of your 78th birthday. We rejoice to hear that, at the evening of a long life devoted to the service of God and His Church, the exalted dignity of the Church's princedom has been offered for your acceptance; we rejoice still more when we look back on the seventy years and more which are today completed, and think of all that you have done and suffered for the cause of Truth.\n\nYour Reverence is not unaware of the deep affection and high esteem in which you are held among us. We are all of us in some way or other indebted to you. Some of us are bound to you by the strong ties of personal gratitude. The best return we can make to you is the prayers we shall tomorrow send up in your behalf to the throne of God. Those of us who have the opportunity of doing so hope to offer for you the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar, and we shall all pray God that He may crown the years which still remain to you with the joy of one who has fought the good fight and earned the reward of peace and victory, and that in the Church Triumphant you {3} may wear the crown which is laid up for the Princes of the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nWe recommend ourselves to your Reverence's Prayers and Holy Sacrifices, and we remain,\n\nDear Father Newman,\n\nYours affectionately in Jesus Christ,\n\nThomas Rigby, S.J.; Victor Frinz, S.J.; Bernard Tepe, S.J.; Paul Rochford, S.J.; Wm.

FATHERS AND BROTHERS,\n\nI am too deeply moved, or rather too much overcome, by your letter to me of yesterday, my birthday, to be able to answer it properly. For such an answer I ought to be more collected than I can be just now.\n\nIf I were not writing to Religious Men it would be affectation in me and want of taste, to say, what is {4} the real truth, that at the moment I cannot address to you the thanks due to you for your most loving words, for I am full of the thought of the goodness of God who has led you to send them: Misericordias Domini in æternum cantabo.\n\nDo you in your charity, my dear friends, pray for me that I, an old man, may not fail Him who has never failed me; that I may not by my wilfulness and ingratitude lose His Divine presence, His Sovereign protection, His love, and that, having been carried on by His undeserved mercy almost to the brink of eternity, I may be carried on safely into it.\n\nYour humble and affectionate servant in Christ,\n\nJ. H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Prior Gasquet for the Benedictines of Downside\n\nST. GREGORY'S, Downside, Feb. 23, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FR. NEWMAN,\n\nIn my own name and that of the community of St. Gregory's Monastery, I desire to offer you our heartfelt congratulations on the honour our Holy Father has done you.\n\nWe can with truth say that there is no one whom we would more gladly see raised to the high dignity of Prince of {5} the Church than yourself, since there is no one we more venerate and admire.\n\nWe one and all can recall many signal benefits which you have conferred upon us by your writings; and many of us, in this way, owe you a debt of gratitude which can never be told.\n\nBegging you then, Very Rev. Father, to accept our humble congratulations,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely and with deep respect,\n\nFRANCIS A. GASQUET,\n\nPrior, O.S.B.\n\nTo Prior Gasquet, O.S.B., of St. Gregory's, Downside\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Feb. 24, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. PRIOR,\n\nThe reports about me, which I am neither at liberty to affirm nor deny, have been so far of immense gain to me, in showing me the affectionate feelings which so many of my Catholic brethren, so many members of holy communities entertain towards me.\n\nThe drawback is my sense of the impossibility of my answering them worthily, of paying the debt which I owe them for such kindness, and of showing that I feel how great it is.\n\nTo receive so kind a letter as yours from a Benedictine body is of special {6} gratification to me, in proportion as my love and admiration of the Benedictine order has been special.\n\nPray express all this to your good Fathers, and believe me, begging your and their prayers for me,\n\nMost truly yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Walford, S.J.\n\nBEAUMONT LODGE, Feb. 27, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FATHER,\n\nFrom Saturday afternoon till yesterday morning I have had to aid in entertaining a party of some forty old Beaumont boys, who came down to spend their Shrovetide at their old school. But for this, I should have sent you this line some days ago.\n\nI now write at the request of Fr. Cassidy, Rector, to convey to you in his name, and in that of the other Fathers and Brothers of our Community, our respectful and at the same time our heartiest congratulations on the high honour lately conferred upon you by the most august authority upon earth. It is a matter of sincere and great rejoicing to us that the services you have rendered to the Catholic cause in England, and to ourselves individually, by your writings and example, as well as by your union with the Society to which we belong in {7} loyal and unswerving devotion to the Holy See, have met with so signal a recognition and appreciation at the hands of the Vicar of Jesus Christ Himself. And you will forgive us if I add that, while we should have been glad on our own account, and on account of our fellow Catholics in England, to see you actually invested with the Sacred Purple, yet, as Religious of the Society of Jesus, we cannot but admire and sympathise all the more with the illustrious son of St. Philip, whose love of humility and retirement leads him, in the Spirit of his own Holy Father as in that of ours, to shrink from so exalted a position as that of a Prince of the Church.\n\nYou will, I am sure, allow me to add the assurance of my own special and peculiar joy on this occasion.\n\nCommending Fr. Rector, our Community and College, and myself to your prayers, with kindest regards to the Fathers of the Oratory,\n\nI remain, Very Rev, and dear Fr.,\n\nYours in all affection and respect,\n\nJ. T. WALFORD, S.J.\n\nTo Fr. Walford, S.J., of Beaumont Lodge\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 1, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. WALFORD,\n\nYou must not measure my gratification and my gratitude to your {8} Very Rev. Fr. Rector and the other Fathers and Brothers of your Community at Beaumont by the poor words I am putting upon paper; for I am confused and troubled by the greatness of the honour which, from what is so widely reported, I suppose there is a prospect of being offered to me, though in truth I cannot say it has. But nothing can undo the fact that the report has been so kindly received and welcomed by my own people, the Catholics of England, and next by such large bodies of our Protestant fellow-countrymen.\n\nIt will be a great relief to me if the great offer is not made to me—but, if made, my way is not clear. I have a reasonable apprehension that my refusal would be taken by Protestants, nay by some Catholics, as a proof that at heart I am not an out and out Son of the Church, and that it may unsettle some Catholics, and throw back enquirers. I know that Unitarians, Theists, and Anticatholics generally are earnest that I should decline, whereas I hear of a widespread feeling among Catholics that, if I decline, I am \"snubbing the Pope\".\n\nI have suffered so much from the {9} obstinacy of all sorts of people to believe that I am a good Catholic that this wonderful opportunity, if opened on me, of righting myself in public opinion must not be lost except for very grave reasons.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Chapter of Birmingham\n\nBIRMINGHAM, March 3, 1879.\n\nDEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nThe Provost and Chapter of Birmingham, having heard that the news of your elevation to the Cardinalate is confirmed, desire to offer you their heartiest congratulations on so joyful an event. On former occasions we have had to thank you tar eminent services rendered to our holy religion in this country under special critical circumstances, and we rejoice that those services should now receive the solemn seal of approbation from the Holy See, which invests you with the Sacred Purple.\n\nThe clergy and the faithful of the Diocese will, we know, desire to give similar expression to their own feelings as soon as they can communicate with one another for this purpose. But the Chapter being assembled today to celebrate the festival of St. Chad, Patron of {10} the Diocese, cannot separate without sending you these few words on so auspicious a day.\n\nWe remain, dear Dr. Newman,\n\nYours very sincerely in Christ,\n\nR. Provost Bagnall; J. Canon Northcote; W. Canon Tandy; M. Canon O'Sullivan, V.G.; E. Canon Knight; Thomas Canon Longman; Edward Canon Ilsley.\n\nTo the Provost and Canons of the Chapter of Birmingham\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 4, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR PROVOST AND CANONS,\n\nThe genuine kindness which has led to your addressing me in Chapter on the Feast of St. Chad, now that I am expecting the greatest event of my life, is but a fresh instance of the warm and welcome sympathy which you and your predecessors and the clergy of Birmingham and the diocese have shown me heretofore, on such various occasions and so opportunely. Never was a man supported and sustained more generously and affectionately than I have been in time of need. And now, when my course is nearly run, you end as you began some thirty years ago, bringing up before me the memories of the past, and renewing my gratitude for old and recent acts of friendliness {11} from you and from others who have gone to their reward. Praying that you may be repaid in full measure, as you will be, for all your goodness towards me,\n\nI am, my dear Friends,\n\nMost sincerely yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Jones, Provincial of the Jesuits\n\nLONDON, W., March 4, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nAs it is no longer doubtful that the Holy Father has offered to you a place in the College of Cardinals, and he has done this so as to secure acceptance on your part, you will allow me, I am sure, to offer you for myself and for the English Province of the Society of Jesus our affectionate and respectful congratulations. The news has been to us a source of singular and unmixed pleasure, and we have many reasons to thank God and the Holy Father for the wise and graceful act by which you are chosen for the highest dignity in the Church.\n\nI don't think anything less than this would satisfy the great body of Catholics in England and Ireland that the character and greatness of the services you {12} have rendered to the Church and to the Holy See were understood in Rome. We have at length reason to know that they are understood, and their recognition and approval will win the hearts of many to the Vicar of Christ and bind more closely to him those that are already his.\n\nI hope that God will spare you long to guide the hearts of many that are turning towards you, and to use the great influence that he has given you for the honour and service of our Mother, the Church.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nJ. JONES.\n\nTo Fr. Jones, S.J., Provincial\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, March 5, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. PROVINCIAL,\n\nYour letter was as great a surprise to me as a pleasure.\n\nI know we must look elsewhere for the true approbation of our doings; but in sincerity I say that there could not here below be a notice of me, favourable to my attempts in past times to serve religious objects, which is more grateful to me, or has given me more deep satisfaction, than the congratulations sent at this time by a body of men so highly endowed as your Fathers. {13}\n\nI am very conscious of the great imperfection of those attempts; but it is a great thing to know how kindly your Fathers think of the upshot of them, and how warm an interest they take in me personally.\n\nThat their generosity may be returned in blessings on themselves is the sincere prayer of\n\nYours most truly in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Fathers of The Oratory at Naples\n\nMarch 5, 1879.\n\nCHARISSIME ET REVERENDISSIME PATER,\n\nQuod Te, Reverendissime in Christo Pater, Pontifex Maximus inter Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinales nuper adsciverit, et fama nobis undique innotuit et animos nostros quam maxima lætitia affecit.

Capecelatro for the Fathers of The Oratory at Naples\n\nVERY DEAR AND VERY REV. FATHER,\n\nWe hear on all sides, to our very great joy, that the Holy Father has announced his intention to number you among the Cardinals of the Roman Church. We esteem you so highly, and love you so warmly, and a bond so close connects the English Oratory with that of Naples, that we look on all honour done to you, as our own.\n\nWherefore, in the name and on behalf of the Naples Congregation of the Oratory, I very cordially congratulate you on the dignity so duly and so deservedly conferred on you; and I do this the more readily, and from still higher motives, because I know that you, as becomes a worthy son of St. Philip, set small store by honours of this kind, for their own sake. But I feel very deeply that God, in His ever wise and watchful Providence, has raised you to this great dignity for the good of the Church, and especially in England; and I rejoice greatly and bless Him that He has vouchsafed to call so good a son of St. Philip to gather into His Church a still more abundant harvest.\n\nWith these thoughts and feelings both I and all the Fathers of our Congregation implore God to multiply more and more His grace upon you; and I very especially and earnestly ask your prayers, and those {17} of the Fathers of your Congregation, and hold myself bound to you, very Rev. Father, by every tie of reverence and loving regard.\n\nYour Reverence's\n\nMost Devoted and Affectionate\n\nALFONSO CAPECELATRO,\n\nSuperior.\n\nGiven at Naples, from the House of the\n\nCongregation of the Oratory, commonly called\n\nGirolamini, March 11, 1879.\n\nTo Fr. Capecelatro, Superior of The Oratory at Naples\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 16, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FATHER,\n\nYou have now, by the very welcome letter which I have today received, written in your own name and in that of your Community, put the crown to the long series of kindnesses and tokens of brotherhood in St. Philip, which your Congregation and its several Fathers have shown us all along in the years that are past.\n\nI embrace you all and cherish you with grateful heart for remembering me, an old man and infirm, with such cordial kindness and sympathy, now that the Holy Father has proposed, with unlooked for and wonderful goodness, to raise me to a dignity so high. {18}\n\nPray for me, my dear Father, you and all your Fathers, that I may well and happily end my course, now so nearly run out, in faith and hope and in the charity which covers the multitude of sins.\n\nYour Reverence's\n\nMost Devoted and Affectionate\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Abbot Smith, O.S.B.\n\nTHE PRIORY, LITTLE MALVERN, Mar. 8, 1879.\n\nDEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nNow that your elevation is happily assured, I, as Provincial of Canterbury, O.S.B., hasten to offer in the name of our Missionary Fathers our united hearty congratulations on the dignity and honour which have been bestowed upon you. To one and all of the English Benedictine Congregation it is a source of deep satisfaction. Please then accept this expression of our united congratulations, and our hope and prayer that you may live long to help forward, as hitherto, the honour and glory of Holy Church.\n\nYour faithful servant in Christ,\n\nTHOMAS CUTHBERT SMITH,\n\nProv. Cantuar., O.S.B. {19}\n\nTo Abbot Smith, O.S.B.\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 9, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR ABBOT SMITH,\n\nIt is a great consolation to me to receive such letters as yours, and I beg to return to you and your Fathers my best thanks for your congratulations.\n\nI hope you will not forget me in your holy prayers.\n\nYour faithful servant in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Amherst, S.J., Glasgow\n\nST. ALOYSIUS' COLLEGE, March 9, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nI have just seen in the Tablet of this week a confirmation of the report which we had heard, that our Holy Father was about to confer upon your Reverence the great dignity of Cardinal. I hasten to offer to you my humble congratulations, and to say how delighted I feel at the joyful news, not only because it will confer the highest honour upon yourself, who have rendered such extraordinary services to the Church, but also because the happy event is a great glory to our portion of the Church in England. You will receive many congratulations {20} more pleasing than mine, because they will come from old and intimate friends, but you will receive none more sincere. All the members of the Society in Glasgow share with me the sentiments I have expressed. Again, and in their name also, I beg to offer your Reverence our heartfelt congratulations.\n\nI remain, Rev, dear Dr. Newman,\n\nMost respectfully and sincerely\n\nyours in Christ,\n\nWM. J. AMHERST, S.J. {21}\n\nTo Fr. Amherst, S.J.\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 9, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. AMHERST,\n\nIt is an extreme pleasure to me to receive such letters as yours, and a special pleasure to be so kindly addressed on this solemn occasion, for so I feel it to be, by your Fathers both in England and now in Scotland.\n\nGod's ways are wonderful. I can say no more. I can but beg you and your Fathers about you to accept my best thanks, which are a poor return, but all I have to give.\n\nMost truly yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Gerard, S.J., St. Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool\n\nMarch 11, 1879.\n\nDEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nThe members both of our Community and College have commissioned me, on occasion of their anniversary of honour done by the Church to St. Philip and St. Ignatius,* to convey to you our most hearty sympathy for the honour which from the same source has come to you.\n\nWe are not so public a body as to entitle us to address you in what I may call official form, but while we feel it to be a benefit that we should spare you the necessity of a reply which such official demonstrations seem to demand, we cannot individually omit the opportunity of testifying our gratitude to one from whom so many of us have directly or indirectly received, under God, so much benefit.\n\nYou may be sure, dear Rev. Father—while we may still so familiarly address you—that there are many among us who do not cease and will not cease to make you the only return that is possible in their prayers and sacrifices, and who hope that they are not altogether without a share in yours.\n\nI remain, in the name of them all,\n\nEver yours very faithfully in Christ,\n\nJOHN GERARD, S.J.\n\n* [St. Philip Neri, St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Francis Xavier, St. Isidore Agricola, and St. Teresa were canonised by Pope Gregory XV. on the same day, March 12, 1622.

Gerard, S.J., St. Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, Mar. 12, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. GERARD,\n\nHow very kind your letter is! I thank you and the other members of your Community and College with all my heart for so welcome a message. Of course my first gratification, on receiving the great honour which is the occasion of your writing to me, is the approbation of me which it implies on the part of the Holy Father. But the next and my keen source of enjoyment is to receive the congratulations of friends. And I have been quite startled at receiving so many, and so warm—and not the least of these in affectionateness from the Houses of your Society.\n\nOf course I can't expect to live long—but it is a wonderful termination, in God's good Providence, of my life. I have lived long enough to see a great marvel. I shall not forget that I have your prayers—many thanks for them.\n\nMost sincerely yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN. {23}\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Purbrick, S.J., Stonyhurst\n\nSTONYHURST COLLEGE, March 14, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nBy passenger train today I am sending you an address from all the inmates of Stonyhurst.\n\nA formal address always reads to me cold and stiff, but I am sure you will believe that there was not any want of warmth in the feelings that prompted it.\n\nIndeed our joy has been and is enthusiastic, especially amongst our own Communities. No words could exaggerate the veneration, love, and gratitude we all feel towards you. Some of us know that under God we owe our very souls to you and all the blessings of admission into the Church.\n\nWhat can we do but unite our humble prayers on your behalf most fervently for every choicest grace and blessing now and for ever.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery Rev, and dear Dr. Newman,\n\nYour devoted, humble servant in Christ,\n\nE.

We not only rejoice in common with so many English Catholics at the personal mark of high esteem which His Holiness has thus shown you, but it is to us a great cause of thankful joy, that your theological labours and unremitting efforts for the cause of Christ and His Church, more particularly in this country, have implicitly received a sanction that must for ever in future stop the mouths of gainsayers.\n\nWe only hope that an event so joyous may not deprive us of the continuance of your dear presence among us, for so long as God in His mercy may spare you to aid us by your wisdom and sustain us by your bright example.\n\nEDWARD J.

RECTOR,\n\nMY DEAR FATHERS, BROTHERS, AND OTHERS OF THE COLLEGE AT STONYHURST,\n\nThe special honour which at this time has been conferred on me by the Sovereign Pontiff has been made still more grateful to me by the pleasure which it has given to my fellow Catholics, and still more and singularly so by the gracious message which has accompanied it from the Holy Father, that it was his express purpose, in raising me to the Sacred College, to do an act acceptable to the Catholic body and to my countrymen.\n\nTo this intention of the Holy Father you have, without knowing of it, responded in an address to me, as artistically beautiful in its appearance as in its wording it is affectionate, and which comes to me with an additional charm as uniting such various signatures, of young and old, of masters and scholars, of friends and strangers, of ecclesiastics and laymen, in one act of kindness and sympathy. {28}\n\nI thank you for it with all my heart, and shall take care to place it on our walls as a document for posterity. Some fifty or a hundred years hence it will, beyond dispute, have a fresh and distinct interest for Catholics, as being then found to contain names, which by that time will belong to history, as belonging to men, who in their day, in various lines of work, have done good services either to Holy Church or to their own country and people.\n\nBelieve me to be, with much gratitude, my dear Fr. Rector, Fathers and others,\n\nMost truly yours,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Abbot Burchall, President-General of the English Benedictines\n\nWOOLTON, LIVERPOOL, March 14, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FATHER,\n\nOn my return home yesterday evening I read in the Tablet a confirmation of the report that His Holiness has intimated his desire of raising your Paternity to the dignity of one of the Princes of the Church.\n\nPermit me, Very Rev., and dear Father, {29} in my own name and in the name of the English Benedictine Congregation to tender to you our united and heartfelt congratulations on your having been selected by the Head of the Church for this dignity. It is a pleasure to us to unite our congratulations with those of unnumbered friends and admirers of Dr. Newman.\n\nThat it may please God to bless you with health to wear the Purple for many long years to come and to continue your labours in the good cause is and shall be the prayer of\n\nVery Rev, and dear Father,\n\nYour faithful servant in Christ,\n\nR. BURCHALL,\n\nPresident-General of the English\n\nBenedictine Congregation.\n\nTo Abbot Burchall, President-General, O.S.B.\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, March 17, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FR. BURCHALL,\n\nI feel the extreme kindness of your letter written in your own name and in that of the English Benedictine Congregation.\n\nIt is wonderful to me that I should have lived long enough to have these great marks of kindness, and such great honours, both from the Sovereign Pontiff and my brethren, and I {30} thank you and yours for the part you have taken in them with all my heart.\n\nSay this to the good Fathers whom you represent, and tell them that I take their present charity to me as a pledge that, when my time is up and I am called away, they will not forget me in their good prayers.\n\nMost truly yours in Jesus Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\n[See p. 208.]\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom St. Edmund's College, Douai\n\nMarch 12, 1879.\n\nEMINENCE,\n\nBe good enough to accept the warm and sincere congratulations of the Prior and Community of St. Edmund's on the occasion of your being raised to the Cardinalate.\n\nTo one so thoroughly acquainted with whatever is peculiar to the Benedictine spirit, it is unnecessary to say much. You will guess our sentiments much better than we could express them. One thing, however, we must say. Since the memorable year 1845 our minds and hearts have ever followed you in your wonderful career, and no tongue could well describe the respect, affection, (and at times the sympathy), we have all felt for you. {31}\n\nWe have nothing amongst us which could engage you to visit us; but we think that the very ground we tread on, this holy place whence so many went forth to keep up Catholicity in England even at the cost of life, might possibly induce your Eminence to take Douai as a resting-place on your journey to Rome. A visit from you would make us all so happy, and we should endeavour to procure an extra supply of Benedictine simplicity for the occasion.\n\nI remain, Eminence,\n\nYour dutiful servant in Christ,\n\nE. A. O'GORMAN (PRIOR).\n\nTo Prior Gorman, O.S.B., of St. Edmund's, Douai\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, March 17, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR PRIOR GORMAN,\n\nThe kindness of your letter embodying the congratulations of yourself and your Community on the Holy Father's goodness to me cannot be duly answered in a formal letter. Considering the place the College at Douai holds in English Catholic History, it is wonderful that I should have received such a letter as yours, and should have lived long enough to receive such honour.\n\nI wish I could promise myself the {32} pleasure of availing myself of the invitation you give me, but I am not very strong and know nothing of the future.\n\nMeanwhile I feel sure you will not forget me in your good prayers,\n\nMy dear Fr. Prior,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Fr. Keogh, Superior of The Oratory, London\n\nTHE ORATORY, LONDON, Feb. 24, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FATHER,\n\nI hope you will let me say, for myself and in the name of all our Fathers, how much we feel for you and all your Fathers in the trying circumstances of the moment, and how constantly we shall pray for you; and at the same time with what affectionate rejoicing we have heard of so great a mark of honour and love on the part of the Sovereign Pontiff towards you.\n\nWhatever happens this at least will remain.\n\nBelieve me, My dear Father,\n\nAlways yours with great affection in St. Philip.\n\nEDWARD S. KEOGH,\n\nCong. Orat. {33}\n\nFrom Fr. Keogh, Superior of The Oratory, London\n\nTHE ORATORY, LONDON, March. 20, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR FATHER,\n\nI write on behalf of our Fathers to beg your acceptance of a little present (which I have just forwarded to Edgbaston) in the hope that you will sometimes use it in the functions of your dignity as Cardinal.\n\nWith it they beg me also to send you in their name the vote of our Congregation of which a copy is enclosed.\n\nWith all our kindest wishes, I am,\n\nMy dear Father,\n\nAffectionately Yours,\n\nEDWARD S. KEOGH,\n\nCong. Orat.\n\nFrom the Fathers of The Oratory, London\n\n(Sent) March 20, 1879.\n\nExtract from the Minutes of a General Congregation held March 6, 1879.\n\nThe Fathers of the London Oratory, assembled in General Congregation, desire to offer to Fr. Newman the expression of their affectionate congratulations on the announcement of the honour to be conferred on him by the Vicar of Christ in creating him a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church.\n\nWhilst sharing with so many others the general rejoicing at so high a recognition {34} of his great services to the Church and to souls, the Fathers of this Congregation feel a singular and special joy, inasmuch as they venerate in Father Newman him to whom, under God, they owe the happiness of wearing St. Philip's habit and of being St. Philip's Sons.\n\nEDWARD S. KEOGH,\n\nPræpos.\n\nThe Cardinal answered the above informally, and, as in the case of Oscott, the Diocesan Seminary, and elsewhere, a visit and a discourse took the place of a formal reply. While staying in London with the Duke of Norfolk, in May of the following year, he assisted in Cappa Magna at Vespers in the Oratory, and afterwards gave a discourse in the Little Oratory to the Brothers [See pp. 256-60.]. Before leaving London he held a reception of clergy in the Oratory house [See p. 321.].\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Chapter of Westminster\n\nWESTMINSTER, March 18, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FATHER,\n\nThe Provost and Canons of the Metropolitan Chapter of Westminster desire to express to you the heartfelt gratification with which they have learnt that His Holiness Pope Leo XIII. has intimated his intention of raising you to the rank of a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church. They rejoice in this recognition of the eminent services you have rendered to the cause of religion and morality, both before and since your submission to the Catholic Church, and in so conspicuous a testimony to the virtues of a life characterised {35} throughout by the most sensitive obedience to the dictates of conscience and the voice of authority.\n\nThe almost unexampled unanimity with which the announcement of your approaching elevation has been welcomed by the principal organs of public opinion, and in every class of society throughout the kingdom, is a manifest proof of the correctness with which the Holy Father has interpreted the feelings and anticipated the wishes of the people of these islands, by conferring this signal mark of favour and confidence on one so universally revered and beloved.\n\nThe Provost and Canons feel the sincerest pleasure in uniting their congratulations with those which you are receiving on every side, and they earnestly pray that you may still live many years to adorn a dignity so richly merited and so gracefully bestowed.\n\nSigned in behalf of the Chapter,\n\nWILLIAM PROVOST HUNT,\n\nGEORGE CANON LAST, Sec.\n\nTo the Provost and Canons of Westminster\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, March 22, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR PROVOST OF WESTMINSTER,\n\nI have delayed my reply to the most welcome congratulations addressed to me by yourself and the {36} Canons of Westminster, on occasion of the singular honour which the Holy Father graciously intends for me, simply because I have been confused at receiving words so very kind and so very earnest. How can I refuse a praise which is so pleasant? How can I accept what, according to my knowledge of myself, is so beyond what I can justly claim?\n\nHowever, such words at least are signs of your affectionate good-will towards me, and no misgiving about myself can deprive me of a right to them. As such I thank you for them with all my heart, and shall treasure them.\n\nIt is indeed a happiness as great as it is rare that those special feelings which are commonly elicited in a man's friends after his death should in my own case find expression in my behalf while I am yet alive.\n\nWith deep gratitude to those who have been so good to me,\n\nI am, my dear Very Rev. Provost,\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN. {37}\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Provost and Canons of Hexham and Newcastle\n\nOLD ELVET, DURHAM,\n\nSt. Cuthbert's Day, March 20, 1879.\n\nVERY REV. AND DEAR FR. NEWMAN,\n\nOur Chapter meeting was on Tuesday the 18th, and the Canons commissioned me to offer you our united, unanimous, and warmest congratulations on the high dignity to which you are about to be raised by the Holy Father. You have not more loyal or devoted friends than the clergy of this diocese, and I am sure it will please you to know that many of us are indebted to your writings for a deeper appreciation of the beauty and truth of our holy Faith.\n\nWe rejoice, therefore, exceedingly that your most valuable services to the Clergy and the Church have met with their fitting recognition and recompense. It is a special subject of congratulation to us that you, whom we have always looked upon as our champion and defender, should be the first amongst the second order of the English Clergy to be made a Prince of the Church.\n\nWe pray that your life may yet be prolonged to add lustre to the Purple, and to edify the Church by your writings and virtues.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nVery Rev, and dear Dr. Newman,\n\nWith much respect,\n\nYour obedient servant in Christ,\n\nEDWARD CONSITT,\n\nProvost of Hexham and Newcastle. {38}\n\nTo the Provost and Canons of Hexham and Newcastle\n\nTHE ORATORY, BIRMINGHAM, March 22, 1880 [sic].\n\nMY DEAR RT. REV. PROVOST OF HEXHAM,\n\nI do not know how adequately to express the great pleasure with which I have received the congratulations of yourself and your Chapter on occasion of the singular honour which the Holy Father proposes to confer on me.\n\nThat honour is the highest that I could receive at his hands. I should be utterly heartless if it did not touch and gratify me deeply. But it is no want of due appreciation of it or ingratitude to the giver if I say how greatly it adds to my happiness to find his condescension on my behalf so warmly welcomed, nay hailed with so generous an impulse, by my brethren in the priesthood and by ecclesiastics so highly placed as yourselves.\n\nI have no fear lest, so speaking, I should be mistaken by him who has been so good to me; for I have reason to know that, with an affectionate thought not only of me, but of his children in these parts generally, {39} and as realising my antecedents and my present circumstances in my own country, it has been his express intention, in bestowing on me this high dignity, to do an act which will be grateful to the Catholic body, and even to England itself.\n\nYou will understand how proud I am that what in you has been a spontaneous kindness towards me should have been in the Holy Father a sure anticipation of it.\n\nI take for granted that those who have been so considerate towards me in other ways do not forget how old I am and the needs of old men.\n\nI am, my dear Provost of Hexham,\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H.

For many years I have learnt to know you and to love you in your works in a way that I can only describe as being akin to the love which you yourself have somewhere expressed towards the \"Ancient Saints,\" known only to you in their words and works.\n\nI hope you will kindly forgive me for thus expressing my feelings, and believe\n\nVery Rev, and dear Father,\n\nYours very respectfully and sincerely in Christ,\n\nCUTHBERT ROBINSON,\n\nSup.

AND DEAR FATHER,\n\nWe, the Priests of the Congregation of the Oblates of St. Charles, in the diocese of Westminster, desire to offer you our sincere and heartfelt congratulations on the honour which is about to be conferred upon you by his Holiness Leo XIII. {41}\n\nWe are conscious that we are only uttering the common sentiments of all Catholics, whether clergy or laity—and indeed of all classes of our countrymen, of whatever religious profession—and of many others throughout the world—when we assure you of the very great satisfaction and pleasure with which we received the announcement of your proposed elevation to the Cardinalate and of your subsequent acceptance of the dignity by desire of the Holy Father. It would be superfluous for us to enlarge upon those merits to which so unanimous and just a tribute is being offered on all sides. But we are anxious to convey to you this special expression of our feelings, both personally and as Oblates of St. Charles—having received a mark of your regard, which we much prize, in the dedication of a volume of your Sermons on the occasion of the opening of our Church. Nor do we forget that the memory of our illustrious Founder and Patron is closely associated with that of your own St. Philip Neri.\n\nWe will only add our most earnest prayer that God may be pleased to prolong your years in the possession of this new dignity, in order that you may continue your labours for the advancement of His truth and the benefit of His Church in this land; towards which you have been enabled by His blessing to contribute so largely in your past life. {42}\n\nBegging you to accept this testimony of our respect and esteem, we remain,\n\nVery Rev, and dear Father,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nCuthbert Robinson, Superior; H.

It becomes the token of a faithful memory on your part of the interest which I took in you on your first establishment, {43} twenty-two years ago, and a graceful response to the lines which at that time I ventured to address to my old acquaintance your illustrious Founder.\n\nImpressed with this instance of good-will, I shall not be content unless you continue your religious thoughts of me in time to come, as generously as you have bestowed them on me in the extended period gone by.\n\nI am, my dear Fathers,\n\nYour faithful servant in Christ,\n\nJOHN H.

It is a pleasure to meet old friends, and it is a pleasure to meet new ones. But it is not {49} merely as friends that I meet you, for you are representatives of an ancient and faithful Catholic people for whom I have a deep affection, and, therefore, in receiving your congratulations of course I feel very much touched by your address; but I hope you will not think it strange if I say that I have been surprised too, because while it is a great thing to please one's own people, it is still more wonderful to create an interest in a people which is not one's own. I do not think there is any other country which would have treated me so graciously as yours did. It is now nearly thirty years since, with a friend of mine, I first went over to Ireland with a view to the engagement which I afterwards formed there, and during the seven years through which that engagement lasted, I had continuous experience of kindness, and nothing but kindness, from all classes of people—from the hierarchy, from the seculars and regulars, and from the laity, whether in Dublin or in the country. Those who worked with me gave the most loyal support and loving help. As their first act they helped me in a great trouble in which I was involved. {50} I had put my foot into an unusual legal embarrassment, and it required many thousand pounds to draw me out of it. They took a great share in that work. Nor did they show less kindness at the end of my time. I was obliged to leave from the necessities of my own congregation at Birmingham. Everybody can understand what a difficulty it is for a body to be without its head, and I only engaged for seven years, because I could not otherwise fulfil the charge which the Holy Father had put upon me in the Oratory. When I left with reluctance and regret that sphere in which I found so many friends, not a word of disappointment or unkindness was uttered, when there might have been a feeling that I was relinquishing a work which I had begun, and now I repeat that, to my surprise, at the end of twenty years I find a silent memory cherished of a person who can only be said to have meant well though he did little;—and now what return can I make to you to show my gratitude? None that is sufficient. But this I can say, that your address shall not die with me. I belong to a body which, {51} with God's blessing, will live after me—the Oratory of St. Philip. The paper which is the record of your generosity shall be committed to our archives, and shall testify to generations to come the enduring kindness of Irish Catholics towards the founder and first head of the English Oratory.\n\nJOHN HENRY CARD. NEWMAN.\n\n[This Reply to the Catholic Members of Parliament for Ireland, the first of Dr. Newman's public Replies, was of necessity unprepared, for he did not receive the draft of the Address until after the reception was over; but it was written down by him and Mr. Allies together at once after the gentlemen had left; and it contained, they believed, the very words he had used. He had not had any experience of proceedings such as this, and he was nervous and diffident about the result. However, on entering the room, he at once felt at ease, and his Reply, for its matter and delivery, and, indeed, in every respect, was considered a great success. He gained from this occasion a confidence in himself that he would be equal to similar and other calls upon him which his new position might bring.]\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Archbishop of St. Andrews, for the Bishops of Scotland\n\nTHE PRO-CATHEDRAL,\n\nEDINBURGH, April 8, 1879.\n\nDEAR DR. NEWMAN,\n\nAt a meeting of the Bishops of Scotland last week—the first that has been held since information was received that you were to be raised to the dignity of Cardinal—I was requested by the assembled {52} Bishops to send in their name and my own our united congratulations to you. We rejoice that it has pleased the Holy Father, by nominating you to a seat in the Sacred College, to show his sense of the services which by your writings and the influence of example you have rendered to the Church, and we sincerely hope, and earnestly pray, that the opportunity of continuing these services may be long granted to you along with the enjoyment of your new and well-earned dignity.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly in Christ,\n\nJOHN, Archbishop of St. Andrews\n\nand Edinburgh.\n\nTo the Archbishop of St. Andrews and the Bishops of Scotland\n\nApril 8, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR LORD ARCHBISHOP,\n\nNext to the approbation of the Holy Father as involved in the high dignity to which he has raised me is the rare token of good opinion and of good-will which your Grace conveys to me from yourself and your brother Bishops of Scotland.\n\nIt is this echo of the Sovereign Pontiff's voice which brings out to the world the force of his Holiness' condescension, {53} and gives such intenseness to my gratification.\n\nI expect soon to go to Rome; it is a great support to feel that your special blessing, as conveyed to me in the letter which I am acknowledging, will accompany me into the Holy Father's presence.\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Bishop's Seminary, Olton, near Birmingham\n\nApril 12, 1879.\n\nTO THE VERY REV. J. H. NEWMAN, D.D.,\n\nWe, the students of the Diocesan Seminary which at our Bishop's request you kindly inaugurated, venture to tell you with what pleasure we learn that you have been called by the Sovereign Pontiff to a throne among the Princes of the Church.\n\nWe rejoice that to your name has been thus added a new title of honour and to your person a fresh claim on our veneration.\n\nOur hearts are full of gratitude when we call to mind the noble services you have throughout your life rendered to the cause of truth and religion. You have fought the good fight, you have guided many to their true home.\n\nWhilst we gratefully acknowledge how {54} much we owe you, we raise our voice in common with our fellow country-men to thank the Holy Father who has been pleased to confer on you so distinguished a mark of his personal esteem and a crowning recognition of your services to the Church.\n\nGod grant you many years to wear the Sacred Purple amongst us, and in His own good time may He fill up the measure of your reward and clothe you in the white robes of those who reign for ever in the kingdom of their Father.\n\nE.

Fitzpatrick.\n\nAn account of the presentation of the Seminary Address on Holy Saturday, April 12, 1879.\n\nDEAR . . .,\n\nThis is the account of what took place when we presented our address—just as I wrote it down in my diary at the time.\n\nHoly Saturday,\n\nApril 12, 1879.\n\nWe took the Seminarists' Address to Dr. Newman, at the Oratory, Edgbaston, in company with Mr. Crewe. Beyond all our hopes we had an interview of near half an hour with the saintly old man. He took us by surprise, entering the room while we were expecting Fr. Pope. He sat down with us, and I asked him somewhat abruptly if he would not like to see the address at once. With some little\n\n{55} trouble in getting the string undone (Dr. Newman himself went and got us a knife to cut it), we brought forth the address, and put it on the mantel-piece, as it happened, in a position very favourable to its effect. Leaning on the mantel-piece he looked at it for a moment or two and then commenced to read it. He read it carefully through while we looked on in silence. As he came to the end he said: \"It is too much, of course, but I know that it is meant\". And then seeing the list of names he expressed his satisfaction, saying that to possess the names is something for the future. He again said that he felt that it was more than he deserved. Upon this I could not keep quiet any longer, and I protested that every word was meant. He then sat down and said, \"I am sure of that. Those things are not measured by words, but by the heart.\" And he expressed his sense of gratitude. He spoke, not preparedly, but in a sort of meditative way, in somewhat broken phrases, but from this very fact with an evident feeling that made one warm up with devotion to him. He then went on to talk about different subjects, about the Seminary and how far it was changed since the day of the opening, October 4, 1873.\"\n\nThe Cardinal (Dr. Newman as he was then) talked with us about twenty minutes or half an hour, but I do not remember anything definite of the conversation. At the end of that time he took leave of us at the door, and we went back to the Seminary.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\n. . .\n\n[For the Cardinal's visit to the Seminary, June 21, 1880, see page 290.]\n\n{56}\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom Madame H. Kerr, Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton\n\nCONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART, ROEHAMPTON,\n\nApril 12, Holy Saturday, 1879.\n\nDEAR FR. NEWMAN,\n\nSo many great people are writing to tell you of their happiness at your being named Cardinal that we feared to join ourselves to them, thinking we were too insignificant. Still, it is difficult to remain quite silent when one is full of joy and satisfaction, and numbers may perhaps compensate for other qualities, so you will allow the two hundred inmates of this house to tell you that nowhere are there more cordial rejoicings than here. We do not send you a grand address, but we ask you to see in this very unpretending little book-marker a token of our heartfelt congratulation, and a promise that many prayers and communions will be offered up for your intentions.\n\nWere you able to come here you would find many who, like myself, have inherited a filial love for your name. We hope some day you will come. Meantime, Rev. Mother Digby begs you to bless her and all her daughters.\n\nI am, dear Father Newman,\n\nYours very respectfully in Christ,\n\nHENRIETTA KERR. {57}\n\nTo Madame Henrietta Kerr of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton\n\nEaster Day, 1879.\n\nTo MADAME HENRIETTA KERR.\n\nWishing you, Rev. Mother, and all of you the best Easter blessings—\n\nThanking you and all of you for your good prayers and earnestly asking of you a continuance of them.\n\nJ. H. N.\n\n[Madame Kerr, in a letter of September 10, 1879, says: \"It was written on the back of a card, but coming by return of post made it very valuable.\"]\n\n———————\n\nARRIVAL IN ROME.\n\nDr. Newman arrived in Rome on Thursday in Low Week, April 24.\n\nAfter his audience with the Pope on Sunday, April 27, Dr. Newman scarcely left his apartments, being troubled with a severe cold and cough. Dr. Aitken was called in to see him, and at one time some anxiety was felt as to the condition of the illustrious Oratorian. However, no apprehension is now entertained, and it is believed that he will be able to attend the Consistory on May 25 to receive the Hat.\n\n{58}\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home\n\nFrom the Catholic Union of Birmingham\n\nBIRMINGHAM, 17th April, 1879.\n\nREV. AND DEAR SIR,\n\nWe, the members of the Birmingham Catholic Union, desire to address you to offer you our congratulations on the occasion of your elevation to the dignity of Cardinal of the Catholic Church, about to be conferred upon you by our Holy Father Pope Leo XIII.\n\nWe feel that we have a claim upon you to allow us this privilege, being inhabitants of the town you chose for your residence thirty years ago, and where, with rare intervals, you have dwelt since, which is therefore connected with so many events of your life, both of joy and of sorrow, and we have rejoiced and taken pride in the fact that in a certain measure we may claim you as belonging to us, we having constantly heard of you, seen you, and in the church of your Oratory been instructed by you. Neither have we forgotten that it was in this town, in the year 1850, you delivered the series of lectures, in one of which you denounced and exposed one of those shameless renegades who at that period attacked Catholicity, and thereby drew upon yourself a prosecution, hard to bear personally, but which effectually checked the success which had hitherto attended these men.\n\nOf your services to religion in the foundation {59} of the Oratory of St. Philip and church here, and of the labours of yourself and of the Fathers of your Community, we are also witnesses; nor can we pass over or forget your literary labours: the lectures on Anglican Difficulties, on Catholicism in England, on Education; your volumes of sermons, Grammar of Assent and other works, particularly those so familiar to us as Loss and Gain, the lectures on the Turks, Callista, the Dream of Gerontius, and, lastly, your Apologia, in which you make us acquainted with yourself, your feelings and innermost life from your earliest years, through the period of your conversion to our Holy Faith in 1845, up to the year 1864. You, as the author of these works, claim and receive from us earnest thanks for the instruction and pleasure we have derived from perusing and studying them.\n\nAnd now, Very Rev. and dear Sir, permit us to offer you, most sincerely, our congratulations that our Holy Father has thought fit to recognise your many services by conferring on you the dignity of the Cardinalate, and most earnestly do we pray that Almighty God may grant you yet many years of life to enjoy and adorn the dignity.\n\nJOHN B. HARDMAN, President.\n\nGEORGE J. REEVE, Hon. Sec. {60}\n\nTo J. B. Hardman, Esq., President of the Catholic Union of Birmingham\n\nROME, May 5, 1879.\n\nMY DEAR MR. HARDMAN,\n\nI had left Birmingham before your letter of April 17, in the name of the Catholic Union of Birmingham, came, and, since I received it, I have been prevented from answering it, both by indisposition and by the duties arising out of the great occasion which has brought me to Rome.\n\nAnd now when I take up my pen to do so, I am troubled with the difficulty of finding words which may fitly respond to so very kind and friendly an Address. I feel how poorly I have merited it, and I am ashamed to think that you have spoken of me in such terms. You have made much of very little; and I am grateful to you for overlooking all my shortcomings, and keeping in mind only those passages in the years which I have passed in Birmingham, in which, in some way or other, I have done service to the Catholic cause. This, however, I can say, that I have always wished to be doing service for the Catholic body, and it is generous in you to have taken the will for the deed.\n\nNothing indeed has pleased me {61} more on this great occasion than to know of your kind sympathy and interest in me; and I am sure I may rely on your making this clear to the gentlemen whom you represent.\n\nI am, my dear Mr. Hardman,\n\nVery sincerely yours in Christ,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.\n\nContinue\n\nTop | Contents | Works | Home"
