It represents the commitment of our entire university to lead and achieve in environmental stewardship and caring for Godâs creation â areas at the core of our mission to advance the common good. While St. Thomas has made remarkable progress toward sustainability over the past decade, we are just getting started. In May 2019, the Undergraduate Student Government General Council passed a resolution in support of sustainability initiatives. This plan identifies a vision for advancing this commitment. Through it, we will catalyze university-wide engagement and build a culture that prepares our students to be sustainability leaders today and tomorrow. This plan has ambitious goals, but I am confident in our ability to achieve them. One is a goal of carbon neutrality for St. Thomas by 2035. Here we have plotted a course to reduce our universityâs carbon emissions by half of what they were in 2007 within the next five years. Carbon neutrality â a dream a decade ago â is clearly within reach! I would like to express my deep gratitude to the many students, faculty, staff and alumni who have worked together to create this plan. Nearly 1,500 individuals engaged in the planning process through class projects, a community visioning brainstorm, a strategic plan workshop and nine work groups. This collective effort resulted in a plan to infuse sustainability throughout the academic, cocurricular, administrative and operational functions of our university. I look forward to seeing this plan grow as we continue to put our minds, ideas, strategies and initiatives to work for sustainability. I look forward to working with you as we rise to the challenge of protecting the environment to create a better world for present and future generations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJulie H. Sullivan, Ph.D. President\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSustainability requires responsibly using and managing natural resources to meet our needs today without harming the possibilities of future generations meeting their own tomorrow. Sustainability is central to the University of St. Thomasâ mission of educating morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good. In 2008, St. Thomas past President Father Dennis Dease signed the American College and University Presidentsâ Climate Commitment, and the Board of Trustees adopted a strategic priority on environmental stewardship and sustainability. Since then, St. Thomas students, faculty and staff have championed many initiatives to infuse sustainability into the universityâs academic programs, cocurricular activities and operations. This plan is the result of 18 months of assessment, community engagement and work group discussions to identify a vision, goals and concrete action steps that we can pursue to advance our commitment to sustainability. Representing the universityâs first attempt to develop a comprehensive sustainability strategy, this plan centers on the following overarching aspirations. ViSION: By catalyzing university-wide engagement, we will create a culture that prepares students to be sustainability leaders during their university years and beyond. GOALs:\n\nâ¢ Achieve a STARS gold rating by 2025 â¢ Achieve carbon neutrality by 2035\n\nOur understanding of, and commitment to, sustainability is grounded in our identity as a Catholic university. This plan embraces the principles of caring for creation, environmental stewardship and advancing the common good. These beliefs encompass a concern for social equity, economic prosperity and the healthy functioning of ecological systems both now and in the future. By implementing this plan, we aim to model sustainability in our own practices and to educate students who will improve lives today and build a better world for future generations.\n\n6\n\n7\n\nAnderson Student Center achieves LEED Gold certification\n\nSustainable Communities Partnership program begins Pollinator Path\n\nCollection of compostable materials begins at the Binz Refectory St. Thomas named Ashoka U Changemaker Campus 2017\n\nestablished on campus 2016\n\nOffice of Sustainability Initiatives created Sustainability Living Learning Community launched 2015\n\nStewardship Garden established on campus 2011\n\n2012\n\nAdopted Climate Action Plan with a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 First solar photovoltaic panels installed on campus (Brady Hall)\n\nNew sustainability minor offered\n\nAchieved STARS silver rating\n\nSt. Thomas appears in the Princeton Reviewâs Guide to Green Colleges 2018 Government passes resolution supporting sustainability first\n\n2010\n\nOUR HISTORY OF SUSTAINABILITY\n\nSt. Thomas President, Father Dennis Dease, signs the American College and\n\nUniversity-wide sustainability strategic plan published Undergraduate Student\n\nUniversity Presidentsâ Climate Commitment\n\nSt. Thomas Board of Trustees adopts a strategic priority on environmental stewardship and sustainability 2008\n\n2019\n\n8\n\n9\n\nGoLD STARS BY 2025\n\nSILVER STARS ToDAY\n\nThe Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education provides a framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance. The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) is a comprehensive rating system that addresses the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Institutions use STARS to assess sustainability performance in four main categories: academics, In 2018, the University of St. Thomas completed its first STARS report. This report informed the goals and actions for the different functional areas of this plan. St. Thomas proudly earned a STARS silver rating, with an initial score of 49.23. The university has set a goal to improve its score to a minimum of 65 to earn a STARS gold rating by 2025. engagement, operations, and planning and administration.\n\n2025 GOAL: STARS GOLD Minimum Score 65.00\n\n2018 STARS SILVER Initial Score 49.23 10\n\n11\n\nANNUAL CARBON EMISSIONS AND GOALS\n\nWhen the university published its first climate action plan in 2010, we adopted a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. For several years, the university purchased renewable energy credits through our electric utility. The university discontinued this practice in order to focus resources on strategies to reduce the consumption of energy on campus. In the past decade, the university has reduced emissions by 37% by implementing a variety of energy conservation measures in new and existing buildings. This plan reaffirms the university's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035 and proposes several goals and strategies that will advance the university's progress. These include â¢ Implementing energy conservation measures in existing buildings â¢ Pursuing LEED certification for new buildings â¢ Reducing emissions from university-owned vehicles â¢ Reducing emissions from student and employee commutes â¢ Offsetting emissions from study abroad air travel Collectively, the goals and actions in this plan will set the university on a course to reduce annual carbon emissions by 50% below 2007 emissions by 2024.\n\n70,000\n\n2007\n\n60,000\n\n50,000\n\n2018 37%\n\n40,000\n\n2024 50%\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n2035 CARBON NEUTRAL 13\n\nZeRO\n\n10,000\n\nMetric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO 2 e)\n\n1. Assessment Earning a silver rating for our 2018 Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) report established a comprehensive baseline of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability at St. Thomas. The university's complete STARS report is available online at link.stthomas.edu/stars . 2. Community Engagement Fall 2018: President Sullivan launched the community engagement process by inviting all students, faculty, staff and alumni to share their vision for sustainability on an interactive, digital idea wall, which received over 1,200 unique visitors over two months. In addition, students and faculty in four different courses conducted research projects, which included focus groups and surveys, to identify concepts for the universityâs sustainability vision. January 2019: The university convened a cross-functional group of nearly 60 students, faculty and staff for a workshop to reflect upon the community input and refine our sustainability vision. 3. Work Groups November 2018 â March 2019: Work groups of students, faculty and staff met to discuss the results of the community engagement process. To develop concrete goals and action steps for the sustainability strategic plan, they focused on the nine areas below: The universityâs Sustainability Council guided four major phases of work that informed the development of this plan. OuR PROCESS\n\nStudent Engagement\n\nFood and Dining\n\nFacilities Management\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nAcademics\n\nMission\n\nInvestment\n\nTransportation Procurement\n\n4. Review and Approval Spring 2019: University leadership reviewed and approved their unit's proposed goals and actions for the sustainability strategic plan. The President's Cabinet also had the opportunity to review the final draft of the plan. The plan takes effect in fiscal year 2020 and will guide the university's sustainability work through fiscal year 2024, ending on June 30. The university's Sustainability Council will periodically review progress and consider updates to the plan over the course of the five-year implementation period.\n\n1,200 students, faculty, staff and alumni contributed to a digital âidea wallâ on campus sustainability.\n\n14\n\n15\n\nInspired by Catholic intellectual tradition, the University of St. Thomas educates students to be morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully\n\nto advance the common good.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY AND OUR MISSION TO ADVANCE THE COMMON GOOD Care for creation and stewardship of natural resources are deeply rooted in the Catholic tradition and the University of St. Thomas itself. From the first pages of the Bible, to the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, and through the contemporary expression of faith, the Catholic tradition has been guided by three fundamental themes. First, we humans and our descendants are dependent on creation for our survival and flourishing. Second, through and in creation we experience our relationship with God and our connectedness to Godâs creation. Third, we have a moral responsibility to care for creation. As a Catholic university, the particular responsibility of the University of St. Thomas is education. In Pope Francisâ encyclical, Laudato Si, On Care for our Common Home , he calls our current ecological crisis âan educational challenge.â The curriculum of environmental education cannot be limited to âscientific information, consciousness-raising, and the prevention of environmental risks.â Rather, the challenge before us requires a comprehensive approach rooted in dialogue and encounter that âseeks ... to restore various levels of ecological equilibrium, establish harmony within ourselves, with others, with nature, and â¦ with God.â We âfacilitate making the leap toward the transcendent which gives ecological ethics its deepest meaning.â Our task is to help âpeople, through effective pedagogy, to grow in solidarity, responsibility, and compassionate care.â When we rise to meet this educational challenge, we foster the conditions for our students to advance the common good. With the university's strategic plan, \"St. Thomas 2020: Living Our Mission, Expanding Our Horizon,\" the university pledges âan ethic of the care for Godâs creation through curricular and cocurricular activities aimed at environmental stewardship and sustainability.â A commitment to sustainability is implicit in the seal of the University of St. Thomas, the symbol of our institution. Directly under the image of a book is a set of wavy lines signifying the Mississippi River â the inspiring wonder that borders our St. Paul campus and is a short walk from our Minneapolis campus. Additionally, our Rome campus overlooks the Tiber River. It is a constant reminder of the beauty of creation and our interconnectedness with nature. Sustainability, then, lies at the heart of our mission. By incorporating sustainability into all that we do â the curriculum, student life programs, facilities and operations, public engagement, and administration â we demonstrate our commitment to the common good to our students and the broader community. We will empower our students and be a model for other institutions.\n\nMI SS ION\n\n16\n\n17\n\nTHE WORK SO FAR\n\nCreated in 2015, the University of St. Thomas Office of Sustainability Initiatives has built a comprehensive system to support the integration of sustainability across the curriculum and confer annual awards for sustainability innovation in the classroom. As a result, St. Thomas offers 95 courses that address sustainability, originating from over 80% of academic departments. From environmental science to engineering and social work, our faculty guide their curriculum and research with sustainability-oriented learning goals. More than one in 10 of our faculty members conduct research on sustainability. Nearly 60% of departments have at least one faculty member engaged in sustainability research. Our Sustainable Communities Partnership initiative has integrated 114 regional and on-campus sustainability projects into 100 courses across 24 disciplines. We also provide Sustainability Scholars grants to support student-faculty research collaborations. WHERE WEâRE HEADED BY 2024 1. Align and support a sustainability culture throughout campus We will draw upon the principles of Laudato Si to explore the role of sustainability in the universityâs convictions through broad discussions with the university community and administration. We will establish a Sustainability Hub to link academic, cocurricular and operational initiatives on campus. The university will support sustainability work as valid interdisciplinary teaching and professional engagement in tenure and promotion decisions. 2. Offset emissions from academic travel We will investigate mission-appropriate approaches to carbon offsets, and implement a policy to offset carbon emissions from all study abroad air travel by 2024. We will also explore a policy to offset emissions from university-funded academic travel for professional development and research.\n\nACADEMICS\n\nEmpowering a new generation of ethical leaders By weaving sustainability throughout our curriculum, St. Thomas will educate the next generation of sustainability leaders who work to advance the common good. Faculty and student research will explore and advance campus sustainability and community resilience. Students will obtain real-world experience using campus and its operations as a living lab and through university-community collaborations. We will share the results of our work freely beyond the institution.\n\n18\n\n19\n\n3. Foster understanding of how education contributes to a more sustainable world We will work toward a goal of 50% of all degree programs adopting sustainability learning outcomes by collaborating with each academic unitâs appropriate curriculum committee. We will also develop the expertise to integrate sustainability into courses and programs through these aspirations: · Make annual sustainability training and credential program available for all faculty · Conduct institution-wide sustainability literacy assessments every two to three years · Build to 20% of all courses offered by the institution being sustainability courses · Build to 90% of academic departments offering at least one sustainability course · Create a graduate-level sustainability degree or certification 4. Coordinate interdisciplinary curricular engagement campus-wide We will ensure students understand how addressing major sustainability challenges advances the common good by integrating relevant content into the undergraduate core curriculum. We will also engage students and faculty in applied, experiential research and courses that investigate sustainability through community-based projects and campus as a living lab. 5. Become a campus of research excellence in sustainability We will support the expansion of sustainability research across all disciplines through increased donor funding, as well as the free and widespread sharing of such research knowledge, to achieve the following milestones: · 75% of departments have at least one faculty member engaged in sustainability research. · 15% of faculty and staff are engaged in sustainability research. · 15% of scholarly articles published by faculty and staff are deposited in an open access repository.\n\n20\n\n21\n\nTHE NEXT GENERATION STARTS NOW\n\nStudents have always played an active role in shaping sustainability initiatives at the University of St. Thomas. Together, we will develop a nationally recognized model for student engagement and learning that offers a holistic, innovative and integrated approach to sustainability. LEADING BY EXAMPLE On campus, students annually elect a sustainability representative to Undergraduate Student Government, lead multiple student clubs to address sustainability, and participate in a Sustainability Living Learning Community through Residence Life. Off campus, St. Thomas students engage in sustainability through a variety of ongoing initiatives such as the Food Recovery Network, BrightSide Produce and an annual Mississippi River cleanup, to name a few. TURNING DREAMS INTO REALITY 1. Launch a Sustainability Hub To create a culture that prepares students to be sustainability leaders and fosters an environment of collaboration among students, faculty, staff and alumni, we will introduce a Sustainability Hub. This physical space will demonstrate the universityâs commitment to sustainability and support:\n\nâ¢ Coordinated planning, implementation and assessment â¢ Communications and outreach\n\nâ¢ Cocurricular education â¢ Research and teaching\n\n2. Create a coherent sustainability culture for students outside of the classroom We will foster student leadership, awareness and education by incorporating sustainability into new student orientation, Welcome Days and other onboarding activities. We will develop an undergraduate student peer educator program, provide advising support for the Undergraduate Student Government Sustainability Coalition and create a sustainability certificate/pathway in Tommie Link. 3. Connect students to sustainability education at St. Thomas and career opportunities in the sustainability field We will connect students to sustainability degree programs and support the integration of sustainability into the curriculum across academic units. Our job panels and career fairs will engage alumni, hiring managers and donors that offer internships, jobs and careers in sustainability fields. 4. Engage prospective students through our commitment to sustainability We will feature information about our commitment to sustainability in recruitment materials, campus tours and other experiences for prospective students. 5. Engage and educate resident students in sustainable living practice s We will fully integrate sustainability into the residence\n\nhalls and Residence Life program. We will model practices to reduce waste, and conserve energy and water and measure our progress. We will grow the Sustainability Living Learning Community for first- year students and create an interest community for second-year students.\n\n22\n\n23\n\nEmPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nBLAZING A TRAIL OF RESPONSIBILITY St. Thomas has always encouraged employees to proactively educate themselves on important topics and initiatives, so they can then lead the way for both current and future Tommies. We envision a work environment that empowers employees to participate in opportunities that contribute to sustainability on campus. Pathways to success Currently, all St. Thomas staff receive annual performance assessments and have access to diversity and inclusion programming. Nearly half of all staff participate in training through the Leadership Academy, and a third utilize ongoing wellness programming. It is through these and other important avenues that we will focus our continued implementation of sustainability practices in the work environment. EDUCATING EMPLOYEES 1. Support employee peer-to-peer education We will pilot and evaluate an Employee Educators Program focused on implementing sustainability practices in the work environment. By 2024, 25% of all employees will be directly targeted by a peer-to-peer sustainability education program. 2. Introduce new employees to the universityâs sustainability goals To increase awareness of sustainability as a strategic priority for new employees, we will incorporate sustainability information into new employee orientation and onboarding activities, with a goal of reaching 85% of all new staff employees. 3. Assess all staff on sustainability competency Starting no later than 2020, sustainability will be added as a component to the Integrity competency in the Performance Assessment process. All staff (full-time and part-time) will have sustainability included in performance reviews. 4. Increase employee ability to engage in sustainability leadership practices We will increase employee awareness of sustainability initiatives and engage 50% of staff in Leadership Academy trainings related to campus sustainability by 2024. We will offer professional development on diversity and inclusion and sustainability to all employees, and we will distribute information on sustainability best practices for work areas. We will recognize employees with a sustainability badge through the Leadership Academy.\n\n24\n\n25\n\n[ FOOD AND DINING ] Dining Services at the University of St Thomas is committed to advancing sustainability on campus through procurement, diversion of food waste, and education while part- nering with all members of the campus community. ON THE MENU Dining Services has been working to create policy and procedures to support the sustainability effort on campus. Dining Services currently participates in diverting food waste to reuse, through the Food Recovery Network, hog farmers or composting. The department has worked to source sustainable food options for all locations. While these options currently represent a small portion of our food purchases, this is just the The first dramatic change our community will notice is the phaseout of single-use plastic straws and lids from all operations. To reduce waste from packaging and single- use plastics, we will: â¢ Implement sustainable, reusable to-go containers for residential and retail dining â¢ Sell reusable cups, mugs and straws and offer incentives to students and employees who use them â¢ Work with our trusted vendor partners to seek quality products offered in bulk rather than individual packaging 2. Expand and advertise sustainable dining options and operations We will educate resident dining students on sustainability projects, local sourcing and waste diversion. Through annual educational programming, posters and events, the campus community will see sustainability efforts within Dining Services. We will also expand sustainable dining options for catering, making it easier to host zero-waste events on campus. 3. Purchase more local and sustainably sourced food options We will make more local and sustainably sourced foods available through our retail, residential and catering dining options each year. start of some very visible, noteworthy changes coming. 1. Reduce plastic and single-use packaging\n\nLET'S MAKE\n\n26\n\n27\n\nOut of necessity as an urban university and as part of our mission to advance the common good, St. Thomas is working to build a culture of multimodal transportation, promoting it for the sake of sustainability and living a healthy lifestyle. We will continue educating our students, faculty and staff about the impacts of transportation on the environment as we seek out and employ transportation best practices. Building a multimodal campus A long-standing goal of the universityâs Parking and Transportation Services Office is decreasing traffic to and from our campuses. From discounted Metro Transit Metropass, increased bicycle access and support â even carsharing vehicle availability via HOURCAR, we continue to encourage a greater number of our community members to use alternative forms of transport. · 75% subsidies for the Metro Transit Metropass used by 131 employees. · 10% subsidies for the Metro Transit College Pass used by 762 students. · 39 bike rack locations across our campus with space to park over 1,000 bikes · Shower and changing facilities for cyclists available on the St. Paul campus · 6% of the universityâs fleet of vehicles currently meets STARS sustainability criteria\n\nStudentsâ and employeesâ primary mode of commute to campus (April 2018):\n\nMODE OF TRAVEL\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nDrive alone\n\n79.20%\n\n38.62%\n\nWalk, bicycle or use other nonmotorized means\n\n7.91% 3.65% 6.69% 0.36%\n\n51.93% 3.35% 4.58% 0.06%\n\nVan pool or car pool\n\nTake a campus shuttle or public transportation\n\nUse a motorcycle, scooter or moped\n\nNote: Some minor responses left out, resulting in totals less than 100%.\n\n1. Increase the percentage of commuters using sustainable modes of transportation Within the next five years, we will work to reduce single occupancy vehicle commutes to St. Thomas. Through increased awareness, assistance and access we will increase the number of students (by at least 7%), and employees (by at least 3%), using sustainable modes of transportation. We intend to create and communicate unique transportation enhancements, incentives, and resources for students and employees. We plan to promote active, sustainable transportation options to and from campus by: · Providing flexible parking passes for employees primarily utilizing the Metropass · Encouraging scooter and bike share programs · Exploring electric vehicle charging stations on campus · Improving bicycle infrastructure using Bicycle Friendly University best practices 2. Reduce carbon emissions from campus fleet by 2.5% By developing an inventory of all university-owned vehicles to assess energy use, technology and emissions, we will create a plan to increase the number of vehicles that use lower carbon fuels and energy efficient technologies. We will also adopt a no idling policy to reduce emissions on campus.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\n28\n\n29\n\n[ FACILITIES MANAGEMENT ]\n\nSince 2008, Facilities Management has completed over 200 sustainability projects in support of this commitment. · Continuous retrofitting of inefficient lighting to LED or more efficient fluorescent lighting · Installed lighting occupancy sensors throughout our buildings · Installed three solar array systems on building rooftops, producing 90.5 kW of electricity · Anderson Student Center achieved LEED Gold® certification for building design and construction · Significant upgrades, replacements and process technology improvements for our systems of HVAC, steam handling, water heating and seasonal boiler usage · Increased recycling rates from wastes produced on campus by 6% · Diverted our solid waste disposal from landfills to incineration for electrical generation\n\nBuilding a better tomorrow Building structures and land management have substantial impacts on the health and well-being of the people on this campus, and on the planet. They are costly to maintain and operate, utilize resources and generate waste. Due to this, Facilities Management must act as good stewards to protect the environment through sustainable practices. The Facilities Management team will continue to support sustainability goals by implementing energy efficiency strategies, constructing LEED-certified buildings and practicing sustainable operations in the maintenance and support of our building structures and land. The result of these actions will support our commitment to carbon neutrality, improve our sustainability performance rating as measured by our STARS reports, and create a culture that prioritizes ethical and responsible use of Earthâs limited resources. Cornerstones of Sustainability Facilities Management has been growing our sustainable operations and best practices over the past 25 years. Since the signing of the American College and University Presidentsâ Climate Commitment, the university has reduced carbon emissions by 37%.\n\n30\n\n31\n\nSINCE 2014, WE HAVE REDUCED UTILITY CONSUMPTION IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:\n\nWATER 8%\n\nELECTRICAL 17%\n\nNATURAL GAS 18%\n\nWEâLL KEEP LEADING THE WAY 1. Continue to reduce carbon emissions In support of the American College and University Presidentsâ Climate Commitment, we are on pace to reduce the annual carbon emissions by 19% below the fiscal year 2018 emissions by 2024. We will continue to partner with Xcel Energy to complete energy audits and recommissioning studies for existing buildings. We will also continue to pursue energy conservation measures and implement submetering of gas, electricity, water and steam for all buildings greater than 50,000 square feet in size. Finally, we will partner with Ever-Green Energy to identify preferred implementation strategies for carbon neutrality. 2. Design all new buildings to a minimum of LEED Silver standards We will adopt a policy for sustainable construction and ensure that all new buildings larger than 25,000 square feet will be designed and constructed to achieve a LEED Silver certification or better. For example, the current 2019 planned construction project for the second-year housing building will be designed and constructed to achieve LEED Gold certification or better.\n\nPercent of university-owned gross square feet (GSF) that achieves LEED certification:\n\nFall 2018 (Current)\n\nFall 2020 (Planned)\n\nFall 2024 (Projected)\n\nTotal Campus Gross Square Feet (GSF)\n\n3,191,084\n\n3,505,880\n\n3,617,418\n\nTotal LEED-Certified Space (GSF) Percentage of LEED Certified Space\n\n261,400\n\n628,491\n\n745,491\n\n8%\n\n18%\n\n21%\n\n3. Continue broad focus of sustainable operations and maintenance We will develop and implement a Sustainable Facilities Operations and Maintenance program that has a focus on waste minimization, responsible land care, formalized policies on indoor air quality, green cleaning and reducing energy and water consumption. We also plan to minimize waste through recycling, reuse, reduce and donation processes, and implement a campus-wide organics collection system to support a goal of diverting 65% of materials from solid waste by 2024 and 80% by 2030. We will adopt an integrated pest management program for all campus grounds, and adopt policies that result in a 10% reduction of water and energy consumed on campus by 2024.\n\n% Total waste/recycling 2016-17\n\n% Total waste/recycling 2017-18\n\n52%\n\n56%\n\n48%\n\n44%\n\necycling, compost, ganics, donations\n\nRecycling, compost, organics, donations\n\nRecycling, compost, organics, donations\n\naste\n\nWaste\n\nWaste\n\n32\n\n33\n\nA FRESH PHILOSOPHY FOR OUR FUTURE\n\nEXPLORING OUR OPTIONS\n\nThe Treasury Office is committed to the universityâs strategic priorities regarding sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. Inclusion of sustainability factors as part of the criteria on which investment managers are evaluated is a means to align the universityâs values with the Investment Committeeâs fiduciary responsibility. The Treasury Office will lead discussions with the Investment Committee during the 2019-20 academic year to consider the development of a sustainable investment policy statement.\n\n1. Review emphasis on sustainable investing We will work with, and seek approval from, the Board of Trusteesâ Investment Committee to incorporate sustainability guidelines into the universityâs investment policy. 2. Add new investment managers that incorporate sustainability We will explore the possibility of selecting investment managers that focus specifically on renewable energy sources. We will also consider adding sustainability to the criteria we use to evaluate prospective investment managers across all other asset classes to support both sustainability efforts and long-term potential for financial return. 3. Ensure existing managers prioritize sustainability We will start a dialogue with each of our current investment managers to make sure we understand how they assess Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks in the investment process, and our due diligence reports will incorporate information about managersâ sustainability efforts.\n\nIncorporating sustainability investments The University of St. Thomas endowment does not currently have an official mandate related to sustainable investments. However, we have been incorporating sustainable investments into aspects of the portfolio for some time. For example, through an external fund manager, we have investments in a group of plants located across Denmark that produce a renewable energy source called biogas. Biogas is a renewable energy produced from raw materials (farm animal manure, crops, food/industrial waste, sewage and other organic waste).

In the universityâs 2018 STARS report, St. Thomas achieved full points for IT purchasing as well as points in other categories including chemicals and paper purchasing. In addition, the procurement staff has worked with vendors on packaging and delivery schedules that minimize emissions and waste, and to track total air miles for the purpose of reporting on the universityâs carbon emissions. We are working to reduce paper usage in procure to pay processes. The following are some highlights from the recent STARS report: â¢ 100% of office paper is FSC certified or contains at least 10% post-consumer recycled content. â¢ 9.68% of office paper contains 90% or more post-consumer recycled content. â¢ 100% of expenditures on computers, tablets, displays and televisions meet the EPEAT Gold standard. â¢ 66% of cleaning and janitorial products meet third-party certified sustainability standards.\n\nTAKE WHAT IS NEEDED\n\nCONTINUED ACTIONS 1. Implement a campus-wide sustainable procurement policy 1. Implement a campus-wide sustainable procurement policy\n\nWe will draft and adopt a campus-wide sustainable procurement policy that addresses at least six of the STARS procurement categories. Additionally, sustainability clauses will be added to the RFP and contracts library to facilitate departmentsâ support of sustainable procurement. 2. Reduce the use of office paper We are currently in development of paperless processing in accounts payable for 30,000 annual multipage transactions. We will also research and implement paperless processing for the card program of at least 50,000 annual multipage transactions, as well as paperless payment to vendors in collaboration with banking resources. Additional initiatives, including reduced student paper use, are ongoing. 3. All office paper to contain 50% or more post-consumer recycled materials As we have already reached the milestone of 10% post-consumer recycled content in all paper purchases, we will phase in the procurement of higher levels for all office paper according to the following schedule:\n\nâ¢ 30% or more by fall 2020 â¢ 50% or more by fall 2021 â¢ Continue to review standards for recycled paper content post-2021\n\n36\n\n37\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nJim Brummer, Associate Vice President, Facilities Management Elizabeth Child, Marketing Writer Amy Gage, Director of Neighborhood Relations Angela Hasouris, Assistant Director of Residential Dining Aaron Macke, Associate Dean of Students and Director of Residence Life Emma Smith, Student, Undergraduate Student Government Sustainability Representative Mark Vangsgard, Chief Financial Officer Hannah Wallace, Student, Sustainability Club co-President TRANSPORTATION CO-CHAIR: Diana Kaardal, Manager of Operations, Parking and Transportation CO-CHAIR: Dan Meuwissen, Director of Public Safety Justin Amaker, Student Amy Gage, Director of Neighborhood Relations Jim Hoffman, Director of Facilities Maintenance Timothy Pate, Marketing Program Manager, Opus College of Business Theresa Ricke-Kiely, Executive Director, Center for the Common Good\n\nACADEMICS CHAIR: Elise L.
