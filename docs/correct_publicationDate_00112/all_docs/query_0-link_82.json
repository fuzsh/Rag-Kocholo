In 1984 his science fiction novel, Ambassador of Progress, was published in the genre in which the author, now writing as Walter Jon Williams, would settle. Ambassador of Progress takes place on an earth-like planet having feudal characteristics. The protagonist, Fiona, a visiting ambassador from a sophisticated world, gets involved in a power struggle between the planet's warrior and governing classes. The author's new course was not initially applauded: soon after publication, Fantasy Review labeled Ambassador of Progress a \"dreary tale.\"\n\nWilliams let only a year pass before the publication of Knight Moves, which proved to be more successful than his previous work. The story concerns a radically advanced earth and a \"world-shaper\" named Falkner whose inventive genius has made humankind immortal and has largely given him control of the planet. Thomas Dunn, writing in Fantasy Review, characterized Knight Moves as being \"suffused with elegiac warmth of the late, lamented Walter Tevis and with [Ursula K.] Le Guin's moral earnestness.\"\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Williams found himself beguiled by the then-emerging popular science fiction sub-genre called \"cyber-punk\" whose most widely known practitioner is William Gibson. Critics noted the influence of Gibson's innovations in Williams's novel Hardwired. Another, and openly acknowledged, influence was fellow science fiction writer Roger Zelazny, whose \"Damnation Alley\" was appropriated for the setting of Hardwired. Hardwired, with the minions of powerful off-earth multinational corporations called \"Orbitals\" as enemies, eventually aroused enough enthusiasm to spawn a video game. A second novel in the \"Hardwired\" series, Voice of the Whirlwind, appeared in 1987, along with the inauguration of a second series, not cyber-punk, concerning a stylish criminal of the future whose crimes are permitted because he performs them so cleverly. This thief, Drake Maijstral, first appears in The Crown Jewels, and then resurfaces the following year in House of Shards.\n\nCritical opinion was divided about Voice of the Whirlwind. The powerful multinational corporations described in Hardwired appear again, and this time the protagonist is a cloned soldier whose original died under the Orbitals' employ in mysterious circumstances. The clone sets out to uncover the truth about his original's death. A New York Times Book Review science fiction columnist reported that the bravura in Williams's narrative in the face of a horrifying and fractured future world was invigorating. However, other reviewers pointed to what they perceived as Williams's heavy borrowing from fellow science fiction writers.\n\nA later novel, Aristoi, explores the promise of some intriguing technologies. The Aristoi are the world's aristocrats and spend a great deal of time probing their inner natures via virtual reality. However, Williams again demonstrates his distrust of the power class: several of these god-like creatures have conspired to manipulate whole worlds and cause humanity trouble. Critics responded favorably to the book: an Analog contributor observed that in Aristoi Williams developed themes of religion and duty originally found in Days of Atonement, though in unexpected ways. The Aristois who manipulated worlds as a sort of social science experiment were attempting to act as gods. Fighting these Old Testament style \"mean-spirited, meddling\" gods is the hero, Gabriel, who acts as a guide and inspiration.\n\nMore recent novels include Metropolitan, which was characterized by Washington Post Book World contributor Tim Sullivan as highly readable \"due largely to pungent characterization and persuasive dialogue,\" and Rock of Ages. In Metropolitan, Aiah, an employee of the Plasm Authority—plasm being the force upon which the world, now one big city, operates—finds a well of plasm and experiments with it, and is soon swept up in a larger power struggle. Despite finding the book readable, Sullivan labeled the plot \"weary\" and noted the complexity of the drawing of the female protagonist as the book's redeeming factor. In Rock of Ages, Williams reintroduces the character Drake Maijstral, the charming thief of the Crown Jewels sequence. In Rock of Ages, Drake undergoes his typical picaresque and comic experiences, embarking on a number of adventures, including duels, love affairs, and the theft of his father's coffin.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nContemporary Popular Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1997.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAnalog, February, 1993, review of Aristoi, pp. 160-168.\n\nBookwatch, August, 1998, review of Frankensteins and Foreign Devils, p. 12.\n\nFantasy Review, January, 1985, review of Ambassador of Progress, p. 2; April, 1985, Thomas Dunn, review of Knight Moves, p. 30.\n\nKirkus Reviews, June 15, 1999, review of The Rift, p. 910.\n\nLibrary Journal, August, 1995, p. 123; August, 1999, Jackie Cassada, review of The Rift, p. 147.\n\nLocus, February, 1990, p. 23; August, 1999, review of The Rift, p. 19; November, 2002, Faren Miller, review of The Praxis, pp. 21, 23.\n\nMagazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, June, 1997, review of City on Fire, p. 25.\n\nNew Statesman, May 20, 1988, p. 27.\n\nNew York Times Book Review, August 2, 1987, review of Voice of the Whirlwind, p. 25; March 12, 1991, p. 37; May 14, 1995, p. 24; February 23, 1997, review of City on Fire, p. 20.\n\nPublishers Weekly, September 25, 1987, p. 100; August 17, 1992, p. 492; July 5, 1999, review of The Rift, p. 64.\n\nScience Fiction Chronicle, December, 1999, review of The Rift, p. 41.\n\nVoice of Youth Advocates, October, 1984, p. 207.\n\nWashington Post Book World, May 24, 1987, p. 6.; March 25, 1990, p. 10; April 30, 1995, Tim Sullivan, review of The Metropolitan, p. 8; February 23, 1997, review of City on Fire, p. 11.\n\nONLINE\n\nMervius.com: Fantastica Daily,http://mervius.com/ (February 12, 2003), review of Destiny's Way.\n\nSciFi.com Web Site,http://www.scifi.com/ (February 12, 2003), L.
