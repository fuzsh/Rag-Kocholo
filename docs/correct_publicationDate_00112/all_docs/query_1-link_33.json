        "text": "Welcome, Walterjon!\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the availability of your books! Someone seriously has to do something about that!\n\nOn a different note, I did recently read \"Dinosaurs\" in an Orsan Scott Card edited hardcover anthology. \"Dinosaurs\" has to be one of the most enjoyable pieces of short fiction that I've read . . . AND I MEAN \"EVER\"!!! (\"eat, eat, eat\" . . . I gotta worry about your sense of humor! Wicked!)\n\nWith any luck, I hope we all get to see an interview piece or \"Destiny's Way\" excerpt in an upcoming Star Wars Insider!\n\nI think we're all looking forward to hearing you share your voice in the Star Wars Universe.\n\n(Aside: In addition to your work, you'll note there lots of George R.R. Martin fans here as well!!!)\n\nBest,\n\nAna V\n\nMastadge, I don't know about the page count of the novel, because I haven't seen it in proofs yet. It's 135,000 words long, and I'd guess that when set into print it would be around 350 pages. But that's just a guess.\n\nPAd, working within the limitations of the shared world generally made the writing easier, because I didn't have to invent any of the characters or background, which is usually the hardest part. All I had to do was look stuff up.\n\nOn the contrary side, that also means that long-established characters like Luke, Leia, and Han are set in stone, and you can't change them, and there are few new insights you can give them. You just sort of wind them up and watch them as they go. The younger characters like Jacen and Jaina were more interesting to write, because they've been through some big changes recently, and their reactions to events could be fresh.\n\nThe character I had the most fun with was Vergere, because she's so extreme. Vergere was willing to torture Jacen for =ages= in the expectation it would make him an enlightened being! Wow! At last, a =good= guy who believes the ends justify the means! (Though this depends on your definition of \"good,\" I suppose.)\n\nI got to do a lot with Vergere, like explaining what she's actually been up to all this time, and why. She explains the philosophical basis for her actions, and she and Luke shrink-wrap each other's brains. It was fun.\n\nAna, there will be an interview in the Insider coming up about the time the book is released.\n\nAlso, thank for your comments on \"Dinosaurs.\" It's one of my best stories, I think. <brief commercial interlude follows> It and others of my stories can be downloaded at http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/WalterJonWilliamseBooks.htm\n\n<end commercial interlude>\n\nI'll tell GRRM that he's got many fans here. He'll be delighted, I know."
