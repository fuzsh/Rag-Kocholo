This is a debut epic fantasy from a new voice in the indie community. I saw the cover and was intrigued, and the author offered me a copy to give it a read. \n\nThis novel has the tone and scope of a classic fantasy. The reader can feel the world is large, rich in history, and that each place fits into the world for a different reason. There is culture, intrigue, and mystery, as well as one hell of an epic opening. \n\nLorian, an inquisitor and servant of the aristoi, travels the world seeking out those who break the rules and use forbidden magics. He is a formidable character who, while not entirely likable, sees his way into multiple situations where he is outnumbered our out-powered just to ensure others are safe. \n\nThere is definitely some notes of Martin within the story, where the undead, especially in the winter cold, bring to mind the whitewalkers, however there are some fouler beasts at play here too. And just like with Martin, I do wish the undead being included would have come to more of a head. Especially because I was so interested in them. \n\nWhile the opening is huge, the climax of the story is much more about the culmination of threads from earlier and the alleviation of the mystery, than any set of action beats. With that there is additional mystery, as well as room for so much more. This reads like a story spanning weeks/months within a series that could span even years. \n\nIn intriguing debut with an awesome cover, and so much lore that youâ€™re going to need book two immediately. \n\n#readwithConnor #readersofinstagram #booktok #fortheloveofbooks #bookhoarder #bookstagrammer #bookshelfie #booksofinstagram #bookobessed #bookcollector #alwaysreading #bookrecs #bookreviewer #homelibrary #currentlyreading #goodreads #bookclub #theblacksun #sebastianpmelang #fantasy #fantasybooks #fantasybook #fantasybookseries #fantasybookstagram #fantasynovel #mystery #mysterybooks #epicfantasy #epicfantasybooks #classicfantasy\".",
