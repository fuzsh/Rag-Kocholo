        "text": "You don't know about me without you have read a blog post by the name of What Are the Great SF Novels of the 1990s?; but that ain't no matter.\n\n{clears throat}\n\nYes, well, anyway, the voting seems to have ended (I didn't set a deadline), so now it's time to see what the top-ranking books of the last decade were (at least among the people who bothered to vote in my little poll).\n\nI asked this same question two places -- here on my blog and on Usenet at rec.arts.sf.written -- and the responses from the two groups were similar but not identical. So I'll list the differing preferences of each group, since -- as has already been established many times -- I love lists.\n\nBut first, the data:\n\non RASFW, 19 people voted for 74 books (and 51 alternates), casting 125 votes (and 55 alternate votes)\n\nhere at Antick Musings, 26 people voted for 79 books (and 13 alternates), casting 126 votes (and 14 alternate votes)\n\nSo the two groups are roughly comparable in vote totals, though that's partially offset by Joe Bernstein of RASFW, who listed 39 titles.\n\nAn \"alternate\" is either a vote for a second book by an already-listed author, a vote specifically designated as \"alternate,\" or just one thrown in at the end of a message that already had a main list.\n\nSome people voted for only one book, some for eight or ten, and some for more. I counted them all as votes, subject only to counting some votes as alternates under the rules above.\n\nAnd here are the lists:\n\nTop 10 (RASFW):\n\nVernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep (7 votes)\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash (6 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks, Use of Weapons (5 votes)\n\nRaphael Carter, The Fortunate Fall (4 votes)\n\nGreg Egan, Axiomatic (4 votes)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones (4 votes)\n\nMichael Swanwick, The Iron Dragon's Daughter (4 votes)\n\nWalter Jon Williams, Aristoi (4 votes)\n\nfive titles tied for 9th place with 3 votes: The Phoenix Guards by Steven Brust, Last Call by Tim Powers, The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell, Metropolitan by Walter Jon Williams and A Night in the Lonesome October by Roger Zelazny.\n\nTop 10 (Antick Musings):\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash (10 votes)\n\nNeil Gaiman, Neverwhere (5 votes)\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars (5 votes)\n\nMary Doria Russell, The Sparrow (5 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks, Use of Weapons (4 votes)\n\neight titles tied for 6th place with 3 votes: Mirror Dance by Lois McMaster Bujold, The Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler, Smoke and Mirrors by Neil Gaiman, A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, The Prestige by Christopher Priest, Hyperion by Dan Simmons, A Fire Upon the Deep by VernorVinger and Doomsday Book by Connie Willis.\n\nTop 10 (combined):\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash (16 votes)\n\nVernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep (10 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks, Use of Weapons (9 votes)\n\nMary Doria Russell, The Sparrow (8 votes)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones (7 votes)\n\nMichael Swanwick, The Iron Dragon's Daughter (6 votes)\n\nLois McMaster Bujold, Mirror Dance (5 votes)\n\nNeil Gaiman, Neverwhere (5 votes)\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars (5 votes)\n\nDan Simmons, Hyperion (5 votes)\n\nConnie Willis, Doomsday Book (5 votes)\n\nThe totals change somewhat if you count alternate votes, so of course I had to work those out as well.\n\nTop 10 (RASFW, including alternates):\n\nVernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep (7 votes)\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash (6 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks , Use of Weapons (5 votes)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones (5 votes)\n\nDan Simmons , Hyperion (5 votes)\n\nRaphael Carter, The Fortunate Fall (4 votes)\n\nGreg Egan , Axiomatic (4 votes)\n\nMary Doria Russell, The Sparrow (4 votes)\n\nMichael Swanwick , The Iron Dragon's Daughter (4 votes)\n\nWalter Jon Williams, Aristoi (4 votes)\n\nWalter Jon Williams, Metropolitan (4 votes)\n\nTop 10 (Antick Musings, including alternates):\n\nNeal Stephenson , Snow Crash (10 votes)\n\nNeil Gaiman , Neverwhere (5 votes)\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars (5 votes)\n\nMary Doria Russell, The Sparrow (5 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks , Use of Weapons (4 votes)\n\nNeil Gaiman, Smoke and Mirrors (4 votes)\n\nseven titles tied for 7th place with 3 votes: Mirror Dance, The Parable of the Sower, A Game of Thrones, The Prestige, Hyperion, A Fire Upon the Deep and Doomsday Book.\n\nTop 10 (combined, including alternates):\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash (16 votes)\n\nVernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep (10 votes)\n\nIain M. Banks, Use of Weapons (9 votes)\n\nMary Doria Russell, The Sparrow (9 votes)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones 8 votes)\n\nDan Simmons, Hyperion (8 votes)\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars (6 votes)\n\nMichael Swanwick, The Iron Dragon's Daughter (6 votes)\n\nConnie Willis, Doomsday Book (6 votes)\n\nLois McMaster Bujold, Mirror Dance (5 votes)\n\nNeil Gaiman, Neverwhere (5 votes)\n\nNeal Stephenson, The Diamond Age (5 votes)\n\nVernor Vinge, A Deepness in the Sky (5 votes)\n\nFrom RASFW, thirty books got at least two votes. From the comments here, twenty-two did (mostly the same titles). I might list those later, but, for now, I'm officially exhausted."
