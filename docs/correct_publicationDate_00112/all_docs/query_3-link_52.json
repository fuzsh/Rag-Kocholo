        "text": "I’ve only recently come across this book, having made it my mission back in the 80s to read all of the books in 100 Best SF Novels. (I still have about 5 to go.)\n\nI am a little surprised and somewhat disappointed at some of the choices and would seriously question the selectors’ definition of the word ‘Best’. Pringle’s criteria I imagine would be that the novels would be both important in terms of influence within the SF world and also be great works of literature. Certainly that applies with a large percentage of this selection but Difillippo and Broderick were well off the mark with the remainder.\n\nI suspect that some authors were included because of their prior reputations rather than the quality of that particular novel. Ballard and Vonnegut wrote far better years before and seem to have been included out of respect rather than merit. In some cases an arbitrary novel seems to have been picked out of a respected author’s canon where far better works could have been included. It does seem odd for instance that ‘Shadow of The Scorpion’ was the Asher choice rather than ‘Gridlinked‘ or Greg Bear’s ‘Queen of Angels‘ being the best thing he wrote in twenty five years. Louis McMaster Bujold, CJ Cherryh and Orson Scott Card write workmanlike SF novels, but they can’t surely be good enough to be listed in the best 101 since 1985. It is the omissions that are as surprising as the inclusions. Where is Dan Simmons’ ‘Hyperion‘ or Richard Paul Russo’s ‘Unto Leviathan‘, either of which would knock the Hunger Games into a cocked hat?\n\nI’m not even going to get into the debate about whether ‘The Hunger Games’ should be on the list. That one selection undermines the validity of the entire enterprise. Where are Peter F Hamilton, Robert Reed, Ian Watson? It doesn’t strike me as a list that has been properly thought through and one which was designed to please the lowest common denominator rather than being a truly critical choice. ‘Most popular’ seldom equates with ‘Best’."
