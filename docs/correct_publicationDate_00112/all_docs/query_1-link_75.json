        "text": "I prepared this text to post it on reddit, but I think I can post it here too\n\nAs in the title, I am looking for books (web novels, light novels, comics, manga, anime, movies and TV series are also fine) in which \"primitive\" people meet advanced technology.\n\nThey can be time travel, transition to another world (Isekai) or anything else. I'm a big fan of this plot and have already read a lot of it, but of course want more, and it's getting harder and harder to find something. I've gone through many topics where people are looking for similar things, but unfortunately I already know it all.\n\nRequirements:\n\nLanguage: Polish, English, Russian,\n\nPublished no earlier than 1980,\n\nAt least the trilogy or ~24 episodes or ~100 chapters,\n\nNo machine translation.\n\nThat's why I made a list of these types of books, first to show exactly what similarities I'm looking for and second for people who are also looking for these types of things. Well, and not to repeat titles I know.\n\nI divided it into several categories:\n\nTime Travel:\n\n\"Axis of Time\" John Birmingham, first book - \"Weapon of Choice\",\n\n\"Assiti Shards\" or \"Ring of Fire\" Eric Flint, first book - \"1632\",\n\n\"Alexander Inheritance\" Eric Flint, first book - \"The Alexander Inheritance\",\n\n\"Nantucket\" Stephen M. Stirling, first book - \"Island in the Sea of Time\"\n\n\"Conrad Stargard\" Leo Frankowski, first book - \"The Cross-Time Engineer\",\n\n\"Kirov Saga\" John Schettler, first book - \"Kirov\",\n\n\"Zipang\" - Kaiji Kawaguchi, it's a manga/anime,\n\n\"I Have a Mansion in the Post-apocalyptic World\" Morning Star LL, it's a web novel,\n\n\"My Father in Law is Lu Bu\" 大哥有枪, it's a web novel.\n\nTransition to another world (Isekai):\n\n\"Destroyermen\" Taylor Anderson, first book - \"Into the Storm\",\n\n\"Lost Regiment\" William R. Forstchen, first book - \"Rally Cry\",\n\n\"World of Prime\" M. C. Planck, first books - \"Sword of the Bright Lady\",\n\n\"Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri\" Takumi Yanai, it's a light novel/anime,\n\n\"Release that Witch\" Er mu, it's a web novel,\n\n\"Magic Industry Empire\" Eight O'Clock At Night, it's a web novel,\n\n\"Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece\" Chen Rui, it's a web novel.\n\nHelp of high-tech aliens:\n\n\"Safehold\" David Weber, first book - \"Off Armageddon Reef\",\n\n\"Dahak\" David Weber, first book - \"Mutineers' Moon\",\n\n\"The General\" Stephen M. Stirling, first book - \"The Forge\",\n\n\"Destiny's Crucible\" Olan Thorensen, first book - \"Cast Under an Alien Sun\",\n\n\"Worldwar\" or \"Colonization\" or \"Tosev\" Harry Turtledove, first book - \"In the Balance\".\n\nLife on another planet by accident:\n\n\"Arturo Sandus\" Peter Rhodan, first book - \"On the Rocks\",\n\n\"Out of Space\" Neo Koh, it's a web novel,\n\n\"Empire of Man\" John Ringo, first book - \"March Upcountry\".\n\nOther:\n\n\"Pomnik cesarzowej Achai\" Andrzej Ziemiański, first book - \"Pomnik cesarzowej Achai\",\n\n\"The Council Wars\" John Ringo, first book - \"There Will Be Dragons\",\n\n\"Bobiverse\" Dennis E. Taylor, first book - \"We Are Legion (We Are Bob)."
