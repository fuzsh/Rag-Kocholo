I am about 100 pages away from finishing this great book, and I know tonight when its over, I will be still be wanting something else to read. Since I normally go for thinsg in spurts, and try to keep most things in teh same vein when reading (buncha horror, buncha mystery, buncha sci-fi, etc.) I am hoping for something close to this, but still fresh and engaging at the same time. I'm trying not to make it a general YABT, so I narrowed it down to \"what's next after Snow Crash\". Suggestions?<BR><BR>TreeHouse\n\nI'd say you need to get out more. <BR><BR><I>A book list of Worthy Reads</I><BR><BR><B>The Hyperion novels by Dan Simmons</B><BR><BR>Hyperion<BR>Fall of Hyperion (the other half of the story, but not as good)<BR><BR>Endymion (not as good)<BR>Rise of Endymion<BR><BR><BR><B>The Culture novels: Iain M.

I have to say that SC pretty much stands on it's own wrt Neal S works. Not that the others aren't good, on the contrary, but they're different. Or should I say SC is different, it really is a unique book & I loved it. Gibson's Neuromancer/Count Zero/Mona Lisa Overdrive trilogy is very good, but don't tackle it expecting it to be anything like Snow Crash. IMO, you'll really like them if you don't but you'll be disappointed if you do.<BR><BR>As far as other stuff to read, I enthusiastically second the Hyperion Cantos (Dan Simmons), a bit uneven in spots, but overall some of the best scifi I have <I>ever</I> read. Also, you should definitely check out the \"Chung Kuo\" series by David Wingrove, it's outstanding.<BR><BR>edit;<BR>wtf am I thinking... almost forgot Gene Wolfe's \"New Urth\" series:<BR>Shadow & Claw: The First Half of the Book of the New Sun: <BR>The Shadow of the Torturer/the Claw of the Conciliator<BR><BR>Sword & Citadel: The Second Half of the Book of the New Sun: <BR>The Sword of the Lictor and the Citadel of the Autarch<BR><BR>then The Urth of the New Sun, and the Long sun & New Sun series, but I haven't gotten to those yet. If they're as good as the New Urth series, they won't disappoint...<BR><BR>[This message was edited by ranxerox on October 21, 2002 at 23:41.]<BR><BR>[This message was edited by ranxerox on October 21, 2002 at 23:42.]\n\nWalter Jon Williams 'Aristoi' is keen, and not many people have heard of it.<BR><BR>Larry Niven -- Ringworld, an excellent read, and Protector, which is even better. His 'Tales of Known Space' collection is triffic too.<BR><BR><B>Mr. Bojangles</B> wrote about not having reads some of Iain Bank's mainstream stuff: <BR><BR>I didn't mind Canal Dreams, it just wasn't up to his usual standard. Song of Stone was bilge. I also really disliked Whit. A weird one of his was 'Inversions' which was kind of a Culture novel, but only tangentally, same with his short story collection 'State of the Art'.<BR><BR>The recommendation of Heinlein is good -- some of his work is truly excellent, I enthusiastically second 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'.<BR><BR>I also support Lois McMasters Bujold -- her Vorkosigan novels are amazing -- full of light touches and great humour, and a lot of pomp and circumstance. Best to read from the beginning or else it's quite difficult to understand why the protagonist even exists, never mind functions.<BR><BR><h1>Hyperion Cantos</h1> is the one to read though. Very gosh-wow.<BR><BR>Excession"
