        "text": "One\n\nThe woman called Caroline Sula watched her commander die. She had liked Lieutenant Captain the Lord Octavius Hong, though she had distrusted his orders, and she was thankful that he didn’t stand the torture for long. He had been wounded during capture, apparently, and tortured once already to make him give up his communications protocols; and he was now too weak to last long under the knives. When he passed out, the loop of executioner’s wire was passed around his neck and he died.\n\nHong’s execution, as well as all the others, were broadcast live on the channel reserved for punishments, one long summer afternoon of blood and torment, entertainment suitable only for sadists and clinicians. Which am I? Sula wondered. Because she needed to hear the announcer read the names of the condemned, she couldn’t even turn off the sound to insulate herself against the moans, screams, and the eerie discordant chimes of dying Daimong. Though there were moments when she had to turn away, Sula steeled herself to watch as much as she could, and noted the names of every one who died.\n\nSo far as she could tell, the entire secret government died that afternoon, from Military Governor Pahn-ko all the way down to his servants. When Sula had first heard of the secret government’s existence, she’d pictured an underground bunker packed with communications gear or a lonely cave in the mountains reached only by a hidden path; but it appeared that Pahn-ko had been captured in a country house not far from Zanshaa City.\n\nThat was the secret hideaway? Sula thought with disbelieving scorn. Pahn-ko might as well have painted SECRET GOVERNMENT on the roof in large white letters.\n\nThe government’s military force died with its leadership. Junior Fleet Commander Lord Eshruq, the head of the action groups that had volunteered to stay behind under occupation, took a long time to die. Perhaps the knobby-limbed gray Daimong body was unnaturally hardy, or perhaps the torturers took special care, since one of Eshruq’s action groups had killed some Naxids on the day they rode in triumph into the captured city.\n\nBut most of the condemned went quickly. There were nearly two hundred loyalists to execute, and a limited number of torturers. Most of the torments were perfunctory, followed by the garotte, a death merciful compared to what the state could inflict when it had more time and leisure.\n\nFrom the bedroom came the amped sounds of saccharine music, mixed with murmurs and moans. One of Sula’s two teammates, Engineer First Class Shawna Spence, lay wounded on the bed watching a romantic melodrama, with the sound turned up so she wouldn’t hear her comrades dying.\n\nSula didn’t blame her.\n\nThe apartment was close and hot and smelled of dust and gun oil, disinfectant and sadness. Sula felt the walls pressing in, the dead weight of dead air. She couldn’t stand it any longer and opened a window. Fresh air flooded in, and the scent of onions frying on a stone griddle just below her window, and the sounds of the street, the music and laughter and shouts of the close-packed neighborhood called Riverside.\n\nSula took a few welcome breaths as she scanned the slow-moving crowds below. Her nerves hummed as she saw a pair of uniforms, the gray jackets and white peaked caps of the Urban Patrol. Her lip curled, an old instinct. Her upbringing, on faraway Spannan, had not been such as to instill in her the greatest respect for law enforcement.\n\nThe police traveled in pairs in a place like Riverside. These two were Terran, but Sula didn’t know if she could trust that fact to help her. They might not care who their orders came from, so long as their own position remained intact. They’d subjected people to the arbitrary justice that was a feature of the old regime, and the Naxids’ orders might not seem any different.\n\nNor were these two the sort to build confidence. As Sula watched from the window, one ear cocked for the sound of the announcer on the video, she saw one of the cops collect some graft from the lottery seller on the corner, and the other help himself to some spiced fry bread from a vendor.\n\nChoke on it, she thought at him, and withdrew into the apartment before they could see her.\n\nThe executions went on. Sula’s stylus jotted names and numbers as she busied herself with calculation. Lieutenant Captain Hong had led Action Group Blanche, which was composed of eleven action teams, each of three Terrans, plus his own headquarters group of six, with his extra servants, runners, and a communications tech. Action Group Blanche therefore had thirty-nine personnel. There were four other action groups, one each for the Cree, Daimong, Torminel, and Lai-own species, and though Sula hadn’t met any of their members, she assumed they were organized the same way as Action Group Blanche, so that Eshruq’s whole command would have constituted 195 members, plus his own headquarters group.\n\nThose identified as members of the action groups—rebel anarchists and saboteurs, as the Naxids called them, as opposed to the mere rebels of Pahn-ko’s administration—amounted to only 175. Ten, the announcers said, had been killed while resisting arrest, or in Hong’s luckless engagement on the Axtattle Parkway.\n\nThree more—Sula’s own Action Team 491—were supposed to have died in an explosion in their apartment at Grandview, a booby trap that Sula had set off to catch the security forces she knew were closing in. The story of their deaths was pure propaganda—unless by some miraculous coincidence the Naxids actually had found three burned Terran bodies in the wreckage—but Sula supposed she might wring some advantage in being officially dead.\n\nBut even counting Action Team 491, that added up to only 180. This left at least some of the loyalists unaccounted for, and as she added her columns of figures, Sula saw they were all Torminel.\n\nRelief eased her taut-strung nerves. She and her team weren’t entirely alone: there were at least some other Fleet personnel out there, armed and presumably ready to make the Naxids pay for the capital. Torminel might look like fat-bottomed plush toys come to life, but that was only until you saw their fangs. They were a species that Sula would rather have on her side than not.\n\nThe problem was, she had no means of contacting them. There were backup communications protocols, but these were the very procedures the Naxids had used to capture most of her comrades. Sula didn’t dare use them, and she presumed the Torminel wouldn’t dare either.\n\nNor could she communicate with any of her superiors. They were all off-planet, and none of the action teams were provided with appropriate transmitters. Hong had such a transmitter, but it had probably been captured along with him.\n\nThe executions continued, messy and bloody now that the executioners were tired. Sula told the video wall to turn off. She had learned all she could.\n\nDespair fell on her like soft rain. Her mouth was dry. She dragged herself to the kitchen and poured a glass of water, and saw the bottles of iarogüt piled casually on a shelf. Iarogüt was the cheapest drunk available, a palate-searing rotgut with a sickening herbal scent, the least attractive form of alcohol Sula knew, but still the sudden urge to drink struck her with the force of a hammer. One or two bottles, she thought, and the whole nightmare afternoon would spin away into chemical oblivion. . .\n\nHer heart throbbed in her chest. Her knees felt watery. She turned and walked back to the front room, clutching her glass of water as if it were her savior. She took a sip, and then another.\n\nJangly music floated into the room through the open window. \"It’s you, cried a voice from the bedroom. It’s never been anyone but you!\"\n\nSula opened the bedroom door and looked at Spence, who was sprawled on her bed, her wounded leg on one pillow, her straw-colored hair strewn over another. It’s over, Sula said. You can turn down the volume now.\n\nHer voice probably had more bite than she’d intended. Over the last few days she’d had her fill of Spence’s romantic videos.\n\nYes, my lady! Spence said in proper military style, and from a position on the bed that approximated attention commanded the wall to silence.\n\nSula was embarrassed by her overreaction. Lucy, Sula said. Call me Lucy. It was her cover name. Then, Do you need anything?\n\nI’m all right, Lucy, thanks. Spence shifted her sturdy hips on the bed.\n\nRight, Sula said. Call if you want something.\n\nSula closed the door and returned to the figures she’d scribbled on her pad. There was a tap on the door, and then it opened to reveal Constable Second Class Gavin Macnamara, the third member of her action team. Tall and curly-haired and ingenuous, he had been Team 491’s runner, traveling through the city on his two-wheeler to collect and distribute messages. But that had been in the days when there were people to send messages to. Now he wandered Zanshaa’s Lower Town at random, collecting what information he could.\n\nHe glanced at the video wall as he entered, his expression tentative. Is it over? he asked.\n\nYes.\n\nHow was it?\n\nShe gave him a look. A hundred and seventy-five reasons not to surrender.\n\nMacnamara nodded and sat on a chair.\n\nHow are people taking it? she asked.\n\nMacnamara’s open, friendly face clouded over. They’re trying to ignore it, I think. I think they’re telling themselves that the condemned were all military, and that it doesn’t apply to them.\n\nAnd the hostages?\n\nOn arrival in the city the Naxids had grabbed over four hundred hostages from the streets, and announced they would be killed if any more acts of resistance were mounted.\n\nPeople are still angry over the hostages, Macnamara said. But they’re starting to be scared too.\n\nThere are thirteen Torminel unaccounted for, Sula said. At least three action teams, plus their group commander.\n\nMacnamara absorbed this news thoughtfully. How do we find them?\n\nSula could only shrug. Hang around in Torminel neighborhoods till we hear something?\n\nIt had been a facetious suggestion, but Macnamara took it seriously. A good way to get arrested. Torminel cops are going to wonder what we’re doing there.\n\nEspecially as the Torminel were a nocturnal species. Terrans would very much stand out in their neighborhoods, both at night when the Torminel were active or in the day when they weren’t.\n\nSula gave it some thought. \"Maybe it’s better if we don’t contact them, she said. They’ve got all the supplies they need to conduct a war right where they are. So do we. If we’re not in touch, we can’t give each other away.\"\n\nMacnamara nodded. So we’re going to keep on fighting then, he said.\n\nThe option to quit had always been there. To stay where they were and do nothing, to wait for the war to end one way or another. No one would blame them, not once their superiors had died.\n\nOh yes. Sula could feel the tension twitching in her jaw muscles. We’re still at war. And I know just where we’re going to start.\n\nYes?\n\nWith Lord Makish of the High Court, Sula said. The Naxid judge who sentenced our friends to death.\n\nAn expression of satisfaction settled onto Macnamara’s face. Very well, my lady, he said.\n\nHigh Judge Makish lived in the Makish Palace in the High City, and for anyone who wasn’t a mountaineer, there were only two ways onto Zanshaa’s granite acropolis: a funicular railway for pedestrians, and a switchback road for vehicles. Since the seat of the entire government was in the High City, in the midst of a hostile population, Sula supposed the Naxids would be very careful about who got onto the acropolis and who didn’t.\n\nAfter buying Spence a meal from Riverside vendors, Macnamara and Sula went to the lower terminus of the funicular railway at suppertime, when many of the High City’s servants and workers would be returning to the Lower Town. The usual vendors and street performers had been cleared from the broad apron in front of the terminus, and Sula saw Naxid guards on the roof of the Central Station across the street, but otherwise civilian traffic seemed normal, and the line of buses and cabs on the street was reassuring, though fewer than usual.\n\nSee if you can talk to someone at the bus stop, Sula told Macnamara. I’ll go inside the terminal.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nMacnamara’s attempts to protect her from danger were endearing in their way, but in the end annoying. Sula said she was sure and walked across the highway.\n\nIn the funicular terminus she stood on the far side of the polished onyx rail and tried to act as if she were waiting for someone. Access to the funicular was controlled, she saw, by a squad of Naxids, all carrying rifles and wearing armor over their centauroid, black-beaded bodies. A petty officer with a hand terminal scanned some manner of list as his subordinates checked the identification of anyone trying to board.\n\nOnly a squad, she thought, but she knew more Naxids were on hand: they had requisitioned a number of hotels and apartments in this vicinity, and these were probably packed with troops.\n\nNearly half the departing passengers were Naxids, scuttling over the polished floors and dodging between the other commuters. Many wore the brown uniform of the civil service. Apparently, employment prospects had improved for their species.\n\nSula pretended she’d seen the person she’d come to meet, then joined a complete stranger for the walk to the outside. She found Macnamara waiting for her.\n\nRight now the Naxids are working off a list of everyone who lives in the High City, he said. Workers have to provide documentation from their employers that they’re needed. But the rumor is that special identification will be required soon.\n\nSula gave the matter some thought. That’s good, she said. \"A letter would have to come from a real employer, one already on the list—and they might check. It’ll be easier to get the special badges.\"\n\nShe had ways of getting false documents out of the Records Office.\n\nHer mind was already abuzz with plans.\n\nThat night she checked into the Records Office and found that Lieutenant Rashtag’s word for the day was Observance! The newly appointed head of Records Office security was fond of bombastic bulletins, and they always included the single-word exclamation intended to inspire the security staff.\n\nSula saw that the next day’s bulletin was already on file, and that its inspirational word was Compliance! For a moment she was tempted to alter it to Subversion! but decided to save that for another day, the day when the loyalist ships appeared above Zanshaa and the Naxid domination was at an end.\n\nShe wondered what single-word exclamation Rashtag would utter if he knew that she had free run of the Records Office computers, and with Rashtag’s own passwords. With a combination of luck, carelessness on the part of the previous administration, and one long night of caffeine-fueled programming, Sula had gained mastery of the Records Office system before the Naxids had even arrived. Any password created by the head of security was sent to her automatically, so even if she were detected and the passwords changed, she’d still have complete command of the place.\n\nShe was now able to access, alter, or create any personnel record. Birth and death certificates, marriage and divorce decrees, records of education, residence, and employment, primary and special identification. . .\n\nIdentification. Proper credentials were the key to survival in a world occupied by the enemy, and the key was in her hand. For a person’s identification card provided more than just a picture and a serial number. The identification card in Sula’s pocket held medical, employment, clan, credit history, and tax records. It was used as a driver’s license for anyone with the proper qualifications. It could be used in bank transfers, could carry cash in electronic form, was used for travel on trains and buses.\n\nIncidentally, it was also used as a library card. Even before the Naxid rebellion, the Shaa Empire had always been interested in the sorts of books and videos that people checked out of or downloaded from the library.\n\nThe official IDs weren’t foolproof, and there were always forgeries. But it was always possible for the forger to make a mistake, and by far the best and most foolproof of false identity cards were those issued by the government.\n\nThose issued by the Records Office.\n\nSula had used her command of the Records Office computer to issue her team multiple IDs. At present she carried the identity card of Lucy Daubrac, an unemployed math teacher evacuated from Zanshaa’s ring before its demolition. Macnamara and Spence were Matthew Guerin and Stacy Hakim, a married couple, also from the ring. Being from the ring explained why they were new in the neighborhood.\n\nSula checked to see if a High City identity badge had been designed, but found that if it had, it wasn’t as yet in the computer.\n\nAs long as she was in the computer, she downloaded every file they had on High Judge Makish and his family. He’d had a lackluster career at the bar, apparently, but his status as a Peer of the highest class had eventually got him a judgeship in one of the lower courts. The arrival of the Naxid rebels had resulted in his promotion to the High Court, where his sentencing of the two-hundred-odd loyalists to torture and death had been his first official act.\n\nShe pictured Makish lying in his blood on the Boulevard of the Praxis in the High City. She could feel the weight of the gun in her hand.\n\nBut who would ever know? she wondered. The Naxids were censoring the news. If she were to shoot Lord Makish, no one would know but a few witnesses. And even if word leaked out, the Naxids could claim that it was an accident, or an unlikely street crime, or hadn’t happened at all. . .there was no way to tell the population that this was a military act, an action by an officer of the Fleet against a traitor and killer.\n\nSula could feel the energy draining from her at this thought. The reason for the creation of the secret government and its military arm was to let the civilian population know that the war hadn’t ended with the fall of the capital, that the legitimate government, the Convocation, and its Fleet were still active, would return, and would punish the rebels and those who aided them.\n\nThe secret government had distributed its own clandestine newspaper, The Loyalist, sheaves of which Sula and her group had humped up and down the streets of the Lower Town, leaving copies in restaurants, bars, and doorways. Even that primitive form of communication was gone now.\n\nSula turned as Spence came out of their bedroom, limping only slightly on her wounded leg. She had been shot through the calf during Hong’s ill-advised fight on the Axtattle Parkway, and was lucky—no arteries hit, no infection. The swelling had finally receded, and most of what was left was stiffness. Sula had prescribed Spence a regular routine of stretching exercises, and of walking back and forth in the apartment to keep the wound from stiffening.\n\nShe hadn’t let Spence leave the apartment, even though she could have walked through the neighborhood with only a minimum of discomfort. Sula didn’t want Spence seen outside until she could walk normally. A limp attracted attention, struck the eye as a wrongness. In fact, she didn’t want anyone on her team to attract attention, not when the situation was so unsettled, not when the attention might come from the Urban Patrol or from an informer.\n\nWhy is the stranger limping? That was a question Sula never wanted her neighbors to ask each other, not when the news broadcasts were full of the Naxid triumph in a pitched battle on the Axtattle Parkway, and even an ordinary person might think of flying bullets and wounds.\n\nShe knew that it was perhaps irrational to take these precautions, but she had survived the Naxid occupation so far by taking precautions that others had thought irrational.\n\nHow’s the leg? Sula asked Spence.\n\nBetter, my la—Lucy. She made a turn about the room and gave a wistful look at the street beyond the window. Pity I can’t leave, on a lovely day like this.\n\nWork on your walking and your stretching, and you will, Sula said.\n\nHuman warmth is not my specialty, she thought.\n\nDidn’t you like your squid?\n\nSula looked in surprise at her supper, bits of squid grilled on a skewer, which had sat untouched by her elbow for the last hour.\n\nI forgot to eat, she said.\n\nLet me warm it, Spence said, and took the skewer—and the other skewer with mushrooms and vegetables—to the kitchen.\n\nSula heard the hum of the convection oven as Spence returned to take another turn around the floor.\n\nYou must be working hard on something, Spence said.\n\n\"I’d be a lot happier if I could work on it, Sula said. She looked down at the displays on the glossy surface of her desk and touched the pad to disconnect her desk from the Records Office computer. I was trying to think of a way to communicate with people in the city, let them know it’s not all over. Replace The Loyalist somehow.\"\n\nSpence considered this, her pug nose wrinkled in thought, then shook her straw-colored hair. I don’t see how. It took all of us several days to distribute those papers last time. An idea struck her. But Lucy, you’ve got access to the Records Office computer. Can’t you use that to send electronic copies?\n\nOnly if I want the security forces to go through every line of programming on that computer until they find me, Sula said. \"There are invisible tags on every piece of mail that tells you where it came from—and of course a duplicate of every mail goes to the Office of the Censor, and you can imagine what would happen if ten thousand copies of The Loyalist turned up in their buffer.\"\n\nSpence paused in her pacing, a thoughtful frown twitching at her lips. Lucy, she said, you’ve got high access. Couldn’t you just tell the computer to lie about all that?\n\nSula opened her lips to make a scornful reply, then hesitated. A subtle chime came from the kitchen, and Spence limped there to take Sula’s supper from the oven. When she returned, Sula had turned to her desk and was connecting once more to the Records Office computer.\n\nEat your supper, Spence said as she dropped the plate on Sula’s desk, over the flashing symbols that were appearing in its glowing depths. Juices sizzled faintly in Sula’s ear. She picked up the nearest skewer and ate a piece of squid. Reheating had turned the cuttlefish rubbery, but its texture, or for that matter its taste, were by now of little interest. She pushed the plate to one side as the Records Office directory appeared onscreen.\n\nMake good use of the help files, Spence advised.\n\nAs Sula ate her supper, and later drank the sweetened coffee that Spence provided, she discovered that all the Records Office mail—minus the interoffice communications, which remained within the department—went through the same broadcast node, a heavy duty model fully capable of handling the thousands of requests for information delivered to the office every day. The node tagged every mail with its own code before sending the original to its destination, and automatically copied every mail to the Office of the Censor, where it would be subjected to a series of highly secret algorithms to determine any subversive content.\n\nBut how easy was it to program the broadcast node? She followed Spence’s advice and checked the help files.\n\nVery easy indeed. She was surprised. For someone with the proper user status, the programming features of the node could be turned on or off nearly as easily as flipping a switch.\n\nHer eyes burned from hours of staring at the display. Sula went to the bathroom and removed the brown contact lenses she wore to disguise her green eyes. She looked at herself in the darkened old mirror above the rust-stained sink, checked her hair roots, then touched her skin. Her efforts at disguise extended to dying her blond hair black and giving herself carotene supplements to darken her pale complexion. She was going to have to use the hair dye again soon, she saw.\n\nHer nerves gave a leap as the outer door opened and she realized she was far from the nearest weapon. She tried to calm herself with the thought that it was probably Macnamara returning, and so it proved to be.\n\nGot to keep a gun in the bathroom, she thought as she returned to the front room.\n\nShall I sleep here tonight? Macnamara asked. Or shall I use my own place?\n\nOriginally, the Riverside apartment had been acquired only for meetings of the team, with the members actually sleeping in their own individual apartments, but the necessity of caring for a wounded team member had changed that.\n\nYou can go home, Sula said. I’ll look after Spence tonight.\n\nMacnamara glanced at the symbols glowing in the depths of the desk. Working on something? he asked.\n\nYes. A way to communicate with the population.\n\nMacnamara considered this. I hope it’s less work than the last one.\n\nAfter checking her work several times, Sula produced a program that would do a number of jobs in sequence.\n\nTurn off the broadcast node’s logging, so there would be no record of what followed.\n\nTurn off the function that appended an identification tag to the message.\n\nTurn off the function that copied the message to the censor.\n\nBroadcast a message.\n\nTurn on the function that copied messages to the censor.\n\nTurn on the identification function.\n\nAnd turn on the logging again.\n\nAfter which the program would remove itself from the node.\n\nShe tested her program by sending herself a message—The information you requested is not available at this department—and found that it worked. No record of her message, or any of the other tasks she had triggered, appeared in any of the Department logs.\n\nShe could send a message now, if she could only work out who to send it to and what the message was.\n\nBefore Sula cut the connection and turned off the computer, she checked Rashtag’s message for the next day and found that his word was Expedite!\n\nExactly, she thought.\n\nSpence had long ago gone to bed, but Sula had drunk too much coffee to sleep. She leaned out the window and took a deep breath of warm midsummer air.\n\nThe traffic was gone, the stalls and pushcarts carried away. Energy restrictions had turned off all signs and illuminated only every third streetlight. Under the nearest, a street away, she could see a few figures engaged in intense conversation, their arms gesturing broadly.\n\nShe grinned. It was so late that the hustlers could hustle only each other.\n\nSula left the apartment through the rear door off the kitchen, onto the building’s back stair, and climbed to the roof. The roof access had been wedged open for the benefit of some tenant’s cat, and she stepped soundlessly onto the flat roof, her shoes silent on the epoxide roofing material. Normally the city’s glare permitted only a few stars to be seen, but now the city’s subdued glow revealed a blazing spray of brilliants strewn across the night’s velvet canopy.\n\nAcross the sky gleamed a series of silver arcs, each separated from the next by starry darkness. These were the silent, empty remains of the accelerator ring that had once circled the planet, that had created the antimatter that fueled its economy, that had berthed its ships, warehoused its goods, and supported the lives of eighty million people. When it had been clear that the Naxids were going to capture Zanshaa, the ring was evacuated and then destroyed, its fragments separating as they rose to a higher orbit.\n\nThe ring had circled the planet for over ten thousand years, the greatest and most glorious technical achievement of the Shaa Empire, and it had survived the death of the last Shaa by less than a year. The fragments hanging in the sky, visible from all quarters of the planet, were a silent, reproachful reminder of the fragility of civilization, and of the uncertainty and violence of war.\n\nAnd it was all my idea. It had been Sula who first suggested destroying the ring, as a way of making it hard for the Naxids to rule the planet they had conquered. Somehow the credit for the idea had lodged with someone else, and somehow Sula herself had gotten lodged on the planet with Hong’s action group, instead of flying away with the rest of the Fleet.\n\nI should be up there, she thought as she looked at the stars. In a warship driving deep into enemy territory, bringing the war to the Naxids, instead of living a hunted existence on the surface of the planet, scurrying from one bolt-hole to the next.\n\nShe thought of one person she knew was flying among the stars with the Fleet, and a lump formed in her throat.\n\nMartinez, she thought, you bastard.\n\nTwo\n\nHe could touch the silk of Sula’s pale, perfect skin, feel the warmth and soft weight of her hair on his flesh. Her brilliant emerald eyes gazed at him fondly. He scented the rich fragrance of Sandama Twilight, her perfume. He tasted her lips. He felt the warmth of her breath as she whispered in his ear, and strained to catch the words.\n\nThe words remained forever beyond his grasp. Lord Gareth Martinez woke with a cry in the darkness of his cabin, and reached with a hand to catch at the phantom that had already fled.\n\nHe heard the steady roar of the cruiser’s engines, the engines that were propelling Illustrious from the Bai-do system. He heard the whisper of air through the ducts. He heard the tread of a pair of shoes outside the cabin door, and felt sweat drying on the back of his neck.\n\nMartinez undid the elastic web that kept him from floating out of his bed during occasional periods of weightlessness, and put his bare feet on the cool parquet floor. He rose from the bed and passed out of his sleeping cabin and into his office. He sat heavily in his chair and gazed down at his desk, at the images he’d set in its display, images of Lady Terza Chen, his wife.\n\nTerza was beautiful, intelligent, accomplished, cultured, and heir to the Chen clan, a clan of the highest possible social standing. In normal circumstances she would be far beyond the reach of someone like Martinez, who came from an affluent but provincial clan, and who spoke with a barbarous accent he’d been unable to polish away. Terza’s father served on the Fleet Control Board that determined Martinez’s professional future. Her aunt was Martinez’s commander. Their families had arranged their marriage just hours after the argument that had destroyed his relationship with Caroline Sula, and they had spent a bare seven days together before his duty called him away.\n\nDuring those seven days she had conceived his child.\n\nHe gazed down at the images of Terza and knew that he didn’t deserve her. He didn’t desire her either.\n\nHe touched a hand to his lips. He could still taste Caroline Sula.\n\nLights, he said. He blinked in the sudden brightness, then blinked again at the sight of the wall murals, which for some inconceivable reason were of naked, winged children. He called up the navigation plots for the wormhole jump from the Bai-do system to Termaine.\n\nChenforce, seven ships of war commanded by Terza’s aunt Michi Chen, had bypassed the Naxid fleet securing their conquest at Zanshaa, and had now driven deep into enemy-controlled space. They had wiped out a detachment of ten enemy warships at Protipanu, then raced through a series of systems, destroying merchant shipping, wormhole relay stations, and uncompleted warships.\n\nAnd several billion people. The raid had worked brilliantly until Chenforce had come to Bai-do, where the Naxids in command had refused Michi Chen’s orders and launched missiles from the planet’s accelerator ring. In response, Squadron Commander Chen had ordered Bai-do’s ring destroyed.\n\nTens of millions of people lived on the ring, and nearly five billion on the planet below. The great mass of the ring dropping onto the planet must have killed millions outright and imperiled the rest. Clouds of dust and debris rising high into the atmosphere from the impact would shroud the sun and smother the food crops. Without the elevators from the ring to the surface, there would be no way to deliver significant amounts of foodstuffs to the planet.\n\nMost of those who had survived the ring’s fall would die a slow, cold death from starvation.\n\nOne nightmare like Bai-do was bad enough. What was worse was that there could be more.\n\nIn a few days Chenforce would jump through one of Baido’s wormholes into the Termaine system. Termaine was a wealthy world packed with industry and rich farmland that produced an overabundance of exports. Under normal circumstances Termaine’s ring would host a hundred merchant vessels at a time. Naxid warships would probably be found under construction in its shipyards.\n\nAnd if those warships fired at Chenforce from the ring, as had happened at Bai-do? The ring would be destroyed, along with the billions below it.\n\nMartinez looked down into the depths of the three-dimensional navigation plot, at the little blue sphere, ringed with silver, that represented Termaine. He recalled the sight of the blue sphere of Bai-do as its doomed ring oscillated and then fell with slow, tragic majesty into the atmosphere. He remembered the sight of the impacts, the antimatter sparkling amid the great plumes of steam and dust and ruin.\n\nLet them not call our bluff again, he thought. Perhaps the Naxid high command thought it worthwhile to find out whether the raiders had the stomach for mass murder. But having found out, surely they would not sacrifice more than one world.\n\nHe wanted to reach down into the depths of the desk display, scoop up the little world, and carry it to safety.\n\nA zero-gee warning gonged through the ship. Martinez looked at the chronometer, saw that it was a scheduled course change and there was no need for him to strap himself in. Another warning sounded, the distant roar of the engines ceased, and Martinez floated weightless. He kept one hand clamped on his chair bottom to keep himself from drifting away—the chair itself was intelligent enough to know to adhere to the floor. An eddy in his stomach told him that Illustrious was rotating onto its new heading, and then there was another warning for the resumption of gravity followed a few seconds later by the punch of the engines. Martinez dropped into his seat again.\n\nThe ship was going through the orderly progress of its day. The heading was changed on schedule, watches came on and off, decks were cleaned, parts were replaced on schedule, drills performed.\n\nThe only person not going about his routine was Martinez, who was awake and staring into his desk display when he should be in bed.\n\nHe told the navigation plot to go away, and the display darkened for an instant, then filled with images of Terza.\n\nTerza smiling, Terza arranging flowers, Terza playing her harp.\n\nTerza, whose soft voice he could barely remember.\n\nHe doused the lights and returned to his bed and his uneasy dreams.\n\nThe High City was half deserted, with overgrown gardens of summer flowers that rioted beneath the blank, boarded-up windows of the great palaces. Even on the grand Boulevard of the Praxis, motor traffic was scarce. Half those pedestrians on the street were Naxids, and most of these were in uniform. Most prominent was the viridian green of the Fleet, along with the gray jackets of the Urban Patrol and the black and yellow of the Motor Patrol.\n\nBusinesses were adapting to the conquerors. Restaurants that had served cuisine tailored to Terran or Torminel tastes now advertised Naxid specialties, and the chairs that served their old customers were being replaced by the short, low couches on which centauroid bodies could take their ease. Tailors’ window displays featured Naxid dummies in sumptuous military splendor, chameleon-weave jackets automatically flashing Naxid scale patterns. Pulse-stirring Naxid music, created by beating on the tuned, hollow sticks called aejai, clattered from the doors of music stores.\n\nSula saw no military or police who were not Naxids. Their presence wasn’t particularly heavy except in the area of the government buildings clustered under the domed Great Refuge, on the east side of the acropolis, where there were checkpoints and armed Naxids on the roofs of at least some of the buildings. Otherwise, small units were posted at important intersections, and there were wandering patrols.\n\nIt’s going to be hard getting away, Sula said. Harder than doing the thing in the first place.\n\nShe and Macnamara had stationed themselves in the Garden of Scents off the Boulevard of the Praxis, where they could look down the boulevard toward the famous statue of The Great Master Delivering the Praxis to Other Peoples, and in the other direction to the Makish Palace, an ancient structure with five bulbous, ornamented towers, each shaped vaguely like an artichoke.\n\nTwo days after their reconnaissance to the funicular terminal, the government had announced the special identification card that would be required for all residents and workers of the High City. Sula looked up the requirements in the Records Office computer, then filled out applications for everyone on her team, approved them in the names of high-ranking administrators, and mailed them to the Riverside address. She made them employees of a fictional firm, at a fictional address, that was owned by Naxids—Naxids who were themselves far from fictional, all close relatives of Lady Kushdai, the governor and highest-ranking Naxid in the capital. Police would be unlikely to inquire too closely into Sula’s business once they saw those names.\n\nWhen the cards arrived in the mail, Sula retroactively altered all records of the mailing address to a fictional street number.\n\nThe identity cards worked perfectly when, dressed in laborers’ coveralls, boots, and caps, Sula and Macnamara had come up the funicular carrying boxes of tools.\n\nWe should just shoot Makish from here, Macnamara said. He had been one of the best marksmen in their firearms training course. He tilted his cap onto the back of his head and gazed up at the fragrant lankish trees overhead, all adrip with trailing pink blossoms. I could do it from one of the trees.\n\nThat would mean smuggling a rifle into the High City, Sula said. They didn’t have weapons with them at present, not knowing whether they could get them past the detectors at the funicular.\n\nMaybe a bomb then. Macnamara was undeterred. Plant it just inside his gate, detonate it from a distance when he steps in.\n\nTo Sula this seemed a more attractive proposition. The bomb would make a lot of noise, she said. Break a lot of windows. The Naxids could never pretend it didn’t happen.\n\nHere comes someone, our target maybe.\n\nSula tilted her cap brim over her face and busied herself with the contents of her toolbox as she cast covert glances at the three Naxids moving down the broad walk. Two wore the uniforms of the Fleet, the exact color of Zanshaa’s viridian sky, with the red cross-belts and armbands of the Military Constabulary. The third was in the brown jacket of the civil service, with badges of high rank and what seemed to be the orange and gold sash of a High Court judge over one shoulder.\n\nGood of him to walk home, Sula said.\n\nIt’s a nice day, why not?\n\nShall we follow?\n\nThey picked up their tools and strolled out of the Garden of Scents. The Naxids moved rapidly on their four feet—Sula had never seen one move slowly unless he was injured—and they had already sped past by the time she and Macnamara left the park. One of the Constabulary guards looked over her shoulder at them as they came out of the park gate but saw little of interest; she turned back to follow the judge, and her jacket flashed a bead-pattern to her partner.\n\nI wish I knew what she just said, Macnamara muttered.\n\nThe black beaded scales on a Naxid’s torso and long back were capable of a flashing red, and bead-patterns were used as a form of auxiliary communication. The chameleon-weave fabric of the Naxids’ uniforms duplicated the patterns on the scales beneath, so even Naxids in uniform were capable of communicating silently in a private language that few non-Naxids could read.\n\nI doubt she said anything interesting, Sula said.\n\nAre you sure that’s our judge? Macnamara asked. I can’t tell them apart, usually.\n\nI’m reasonably certain, Sula said. I got a glimpse of his face as he went past and it looked right to me. She offered the world a chill smile. But even if he’s not the judge we’re after, he’s important enough to rate a couple guards. As far as I’m concerned, that makes him a target.\n\nThe Naxids crossed to the opposite side of the boulevard, where the Makish Palace waited. Sula and Macnamara remained on their own side of the street and watched with what she hoped was an appropriate level of disinterest. The judge passed through an elaborate fence of gleaming silver alloy, then entered the house through the formal garden out front. One guard went into the palace with him, and the other stationed herself in the garden.\n\nSula’s eye had already moved on to the building next to the Makish Palace, another ornate structure, a palace of mellow gold sandstone with an intricate, carved facade of radiating, interlinking lines. The place was obviously shut down, and the garden out front had run riot.\n\nNo obvious security besides the two guards, Macnamara said.\n\nBeg pardon?\n\nMacnamara repeated his statement. Sula looked at the abandoned palace again.\n\nI’ve got an idea, she said.\n\nA gold-accented door opened in front of Sula, the door to a private club. In a whiff of tobacco smoke a well-dressed Terran, braided lapels and fashionably pleated trouser front, stepped out of the club and glanced left and right as he made a minor adjustment to his cuffs.\n\nThe door closed behind him. His mouth gaped under its narrow little mustache. Lady Sula! he gasped.\n\nShe stepped forward, took his arm, and steered him down the street. Macnamara, suddenly alert, kept a wary eye behind.\n\nYou’re dead! the man cried.\n\nFor all’s sake, PJ, said Sula, you don’t have to make such a fuss about it.\n\nThree\n\n\"Laredo is too far, said Fleet Commander Tork. His melodious voice sounded like wind chimes, and it took a modest effort to separate content from melody. A message would take eight days each way to Chijimo, and ten to Zanshaa. We are Fleet Control Board; we must remain near the Fleet.\"\n\nLord Chen had no desire to join the fleeing Convocation on Laredo, the home of his bumptious in-laws. He had no desire to accept the hospitality of Lord Martinez, and face the daily reminders of his dependent status. He had no wish to see his daughter Terza surrounded by the members of the parvenu family to whom he had sold her.\n\nOn the other hand, he was less than enchanted with what Lord Tork seemed to be proposing, if for no other reason than it offered fewer opportunities to escape Tork’s company.\n\nThe eight members of the Fleet Control Board were traveling together on the Galactic, a sumptuous passenger yacht the Fleet maintained in order to ferry dignitaries from one system to another. Though Galactic was a large vessel, it was stuffed full of evacuees from Zanshaa—a large staff of secretaries and communications staff, members of the Intelligence Section and the Investigative Service, bureaucrats from the Ministry of Right and Dominion, servants of the board members. . .all people who existed to serve the lords of the Fleet, and who Lord Chen was finding it difficult to escape.\n\nLord Chen was trapped on a small ship with his job, and he wasn’t enjoying himself. At Tork’s insistence, the board had followed the rules it had laid down for everyone else, and so Lord Chen was permitted only a single servant, and family members were forbidden to accompany—and in any case Lady Chen, who had strongly disapproved of the arrangement by which her only child and heir was married to a Martinez, would never have consented to visit Laredo. Since boarding Galactic, Lord Chen’s sole diversion had been frequent communication with his daughter Terza, who was on the Martinez yacht Ensenada, traveling a few days ahead.\n\nWhat do you have in mind, my lord? he asked Tork.\n\nA waft of air brought Lord Chen the scent of Tork’s decaying flesh, and he took a discreet sniff of the cologne he’d applied to the inside of his wrist. The Control Board met in a room that had been intended as guest quarters for important Fleet dignitaries. It was bright with mosaics that showed ships dashing through wormholes; but now a long table crowded the room and the air was rather close.\n\nThe Daimong turned his round black-on-black eyes on Chen and chimed again. We will divert to Chijimo and remain with the Home Fleet until the time comes for the recapture of Zanshaa.\n\nLord Chen could not imagine Lord Eino Kangas, who commanded the Home Fleet, being very pleased at the idea of his superiors hovering over him that way.\n\nMy lord, said Lady Seekin, shouldn’t we remain with the Convocation? We may need to contribute our expertise on important matters, and of course our votes.\n\nLady Seekin, a Torminel, was one of the civilian members of the board, and a convocate. Her comprehension of Fleet matters was imperfect, but she understood the political dimension of her career very well.\n\nThe important votes have already been taken, Tork said. Policy has been set and allocations have been made. It is our duty to make certain that the proper policy is implemented, and that no mistakes are made with regard to Fleet deployments and tactical doctrine.\n\nKangas was going to love this, Chen thought.\n\nI confess to reservations, he said. Aren’t we better employed being Lord Eino’s advocate with the Convocation? Few of the Lords Convocate have our experience in—\n\nWe are best employed by ensuring the destruction of the rebels and the restoration of the Praxis to the capital! Tork declaimed. His voice took on the harsh, clanging, dogmatic overtones that others on the board had learned to dread. Lord Chen tried not to wince as the discord clashed in his skull.\n\nJunior Fleet Commander Pezzini, the other Terran member of the board, gave a convulsive sneeze. Perhaps he’d gotten too strong a whiff of the chairman.\n\nMy lord, he said, if we sit on top of Fleet Commander Kangas that way, it’s going to look as if we don’t trust him.\n\nWe will be ensuring the correct employment of the Home Fleet! Tork said. His voice was like a razor blade shredding Chen’s nerves. Chen took another whiff of cologne.\n\nWe have entrusted Lord Eino to make those deployments, Pezzini said. His voice was firm. It’s not our task to second-guess him.\n\nWe must not take chances! In the small room the voice sounded like a blaring fire alarm. The Fleet has been undermined by subversive activity and unsound doctrines!\n\nThe Fleet, Pezzini said patiently, will be undermined by a crisis of confidence if we spend months looking over Lord Eino’s shoulders.\n\nLord Chen cast Pezzini a grateful look. He and Pezzini were often on opposite sides of board disputes, but at least Pezzini had been a serving officer, and understood how such a preemption of authority would look.\n\nTork, who had also been a serving officer, had either forgotten or never knew in the first place.\n\nKangas must not be permitted any latitude! Tork cried. He must adhere without question to the ways of our ancestors!\n\nLord Chen took a long breath. As Fleet recruits gradually built up a resistance to high gees, he and the others of the board had gradually steeled themselves against the chairman’s outbursts.\n\nFleet Commander Kangas is not a child, Chen said. He does not require a nursemaid standing over him, particularly a nursemaid in the form of a committee. As Tork turned his pale, frozen face to reply, Lord Chen slapped the table with his hand, making a sound like a gun crack. The others jumped.\n\nTork, Chen thought, wasn’t the only one in the room who could make a sonic attack.\n\nWe must obey the dictates of the Praxis! he said. \"The Praxis states that there must be a completely clear chain of command, from the Fleet Commander to the lowliest recruit. For the Control Board to interfere in that relationship is a violation of the empire’s. . .fundamental. . .law!\"\n\nHe slapped the table again on each of the last three words. Glasses of water and tea jumped. Tork gazed at Chen with his expressionless face, his gaping mouth and round eyes giving the impression of perpetual surprise.\n\nSo can we please go to Laredo? asked Lady Seekin, her voice a bit plaintive.\n\nOf course they compromised. In the end the decision was taken to go to Antopone, where the board could hover between Laredo and Chijimo, and also supervise the three cruisers that were being constructed on Antopone’s ring.\n\nAt least Galactic would berth on the ring, and Lord Chen knew he would have some time away from his colleagues. He had friends who had fled to Antopone from Zanshaa, and he could count on a gratifying reception from them.\n\nHe therefore wouldn’t have to put up with Laredo or the Martinez clan, with their rude accents and barbaric manners. And he would have at least a few hours of liberty from Tork and the others. He could look forward to Antopone with satisfaction.\n\nBut unfortunately Terza would not be staying with him. Her calm presence was the last reminder of his old life on Zanshaa, the days before Naxids and the Martinez clan became such oppressive presences in his life.\n\nDuring the weeks it took to reach Antopone, the press of business never slackened. Tork, whatever his other faults, was a peerless organizer: somehow he managed to keep in his gray, bald head the details of recruitment and training, ship building and repair, logistics, and support for the entire Fleet. He read reports and dictated memoranda. He ordered supplies to be shipped from one location or another. He supervised the deployment of recruits from the training camps, and deployed officers to the ships building in the yards.\n\nLord Eino Kangas, reasonably free of interference, remained orbiting the Chijimo system with Home Fleet, which had lost not only its home but most of its ships. The Home Fleet proper had been reduced to the five survivors of Magaria, all heavy cruisers, to which had been added an additional seven heavy cruisers of Faqforce, the Lai-own divisions commanded by Squadron Commander Do-faq. These twelve vessels were hardly a match for the nearest enemy, the forty-three Naxid ships known to be at Zanshaa.\n\nIf the enemy advanced, Kangas would have no choice but to fly before them, surrendering any systems the Naxids chose to threaten. But the Naxids didn’t seem to be interested in advancing. They remained at Zanshaa, guarding the capital while their government sank its roots into the soil below. They seemed confident that the remaining loyalists would surrender.\n\nBut the loyalists had no intention of surrendering. More than half the loyalist fleet, Chenforce under Michi Chen and Light Squadron 14 under the Torminel Squadron Commander Altasz, plunged on separate raids into rebel-held systems, there to demonstrate that while the rebels might have the capital, the rest of their domain wasn’t safe.\n\nThe strategy of abandoning the capital and defending nowhere while building forces and raiding into enemy territory was referred to as the Chen Plan. In fact the plan had been developed by Captain Martinez and Lady Sula, but neither of them were sufficiently important or free enough from controversy to deserve having the Fleet’s strategic aims named after them. So Lord Chen, who had first presented the plan to the board, had his name appended to it, and his career would rise or fall with its success.\n\nWhile Tork managed the business of the Fleet, while Kangas orbited Chijimo with his outnumbered force, while warships were building on many worlds, while the representatives of the Investigative Service bickered over fine points of interpretation with their rivals in the Intelligence Service, while the Naxids occupied the capital and Lord Chen’s sister and son-in-law advanced with their squadron into the unknown, Lord Chen occupied himself sending messages to his friends on Antopone.\n\nIt would be such a relief to see them again.\n\nSo much for my clever disguise, Sula thought. Blond hair dyed black, green eyes turned brown, pale skin darkened, and she couldn’t even fool someone of PJ Ngeni’s. . .extremely localized intelligence.\n\nPJ had recovered his equilibrium somewhat, and the reflexes of a man of fashion came to the fore. You must let me give you dinner at my club, he said.\n\nSula dropped PJ’s arm and indicated her gray coveralls. We’re not exactly dressed for it, PJ, she said.\n\nHe touched his little mustache. We’ll order in, then.\n\nSula felt a nervous giggle flutter like a butterfly in her abdomen. The jolt of adrenaline that had followed PJ’s blurting of her name was followed by an equally powerful impulse to break the tension with laughter.\n\nI don’t think you should be seen with us, Sula said through her breaking smile. We’re wanted by the Naxids. If you’re caught with us, you’ll be tortured and killed.\n\nPJ waved a hand. Oh, he said, that.\n\nLord Pierre J. Ngeni was a tall, slim, elegant man, not quite middle-aged, with a long balding head and clothes of a modish cut. It was generally believed he’d wasted his inheritance on the usual dissipations available to members of his class, and now—for a Peer—he was poor, and living largely on the charity of his clan.\n\nSula knew PJ because he’d once been engaged to Gareth Martinez’s sister Sempronia. This, Martinez had clearly explained to her, had been a sham engagement, yet another of Martinez’s attempts to clamber from his obscure provincial origins into the cream of Zanshaa society. An engagement to a member of his patron clan, the Ngenis, would guarantee access for Martinez and his siblings to the highest levels of the city. After Martinez and his family had won access, Sempronia would be at liberty to discover, to her horror, that PJ had led a scandalous life, and then break the engagement.\n\nThe chief fault of the plan was that PJ Ngeni, himself, had never realized his engagement was a travesty. He’d fallen in love with Sempronia, who in her turn had rebelled at the very idea of a burlesque engagement and run off with one of Martinez’s lieutenants. The resulting scandal had threatened to unhinge the relationship between the Ngenis and Clan Martinez, and another sister entirely had been offered as a family sacrifice. PJ traded a farce of an engagement for a mockery of a marriage.\n\nSince the Martinez family had sensibly cleared out before the Naxids arrived, as had the Ngenis, the fact that the new bridegroom had been left behind did not speak well for PJ’s conjugal condition.\n\nWe’ll bring in a nice dinner, PJ continued amiably, and open a bottle of wine. Oh—sorry—I forgot you don’t drink.\n\nPJ, Sula said, \"what are you doing here?\"\n\nPJ shrugged. I volunteered to stay behind and guard the family’s interests on Zanshaa, he said. Not that there are very many interests left, barring some property. But we still have clients here, and some old servants that we’ve pensioned off, and I’m doing my best to look after them. He looked at Sula, then glanced over his shoulder at Macnamara. Do I know your friend? he asked.\n\nI don’t believe so. Call him Starling. Which was Macnamara’s code name.\n\nPJ was amiability itself. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Starling.\n\nMacnamara gave a terse nod. My lord.\n\nPJ hesitated as he peered along the street. If I’m going to give you dinner, he said, \"we should be walking in the, ah, the other direction.\" He pointed the way they had come.\n\nYou’re staying in the Ngeni Palace?\n\nThe palace is closed. The servants have been dismissed, and the pensioners sent to our place in the country. I’m in a guest cottage.\n\nNo cooks? No servants?\n\nSomeone from an agency comes in to clean. And I either eat at one of my clubs or call for delivery from a caterer.\n\nSula looked at Macnamara, who gave her an equivocal look. Up to you, Sula read.\n\nIt sounds safe enough, she ventured. She turned to PJ. Go ahead of us, please. If we walked together it would look odd.\n\nPJ was bemused but led the way. He passed his smoking club again and then crossed the boulevard, where he led them past the Makish Palace. Sula tried to amble casually along, and as she passed the palace she paused to shift her toolbox from one hand to the next. She paid as much attention to the abandoned palace next door as she did to her target. From the name inscribed in a sunburst over the doorway, Orghoder, Sula assumed the empty building had been built by a Torminel clan.\n\nThe Ngeni Palace wasn’t on the Boulevard of the Praxis, but several streets behind, backed against the gray cliffside for a stunning view of the Lower Town. The palace itself was tall, faced with veined pink marble, and nearly a cube, with a huge glass-fronted, barrel-vaulted hall visible from the street. PJ didn’t enter the palace, but took them around by a side entrance, then past a huge old banyan tree that looked as if it might have been standing on the High City since the dawn of time.\n\nHis cottage was three stories tall and probably had twenty rooms, but PJ seemed only to be living in a small part of it. He ushered his guests into a parlor, one with a view of the flagstone terrace that overlooked the Lower Town. PJ went to the comm unit concealed in a dramatic commode of arculé wood, ordered dinner for three from a caterer who seemed to know him, then closed the commode and turned to his guests.\n\nWell! he said brightly. So you’re alive after all, Lady Sula!\n\nYes. The laugh that had been struggling to escape from her finally broke free, and she indulged it. I hardly expected to see anyone I knew.\n\nThat’s lucky, isn’t it? PJ seemed pleased. I’m glad I’m able to be of service. He reached for the drink trolley. What may I give you to drink? Whisky, Mr. Starling?\n\nSula looked at him. Whatever you’ve got that doesn’t have alcohol. And what did you mean ‘service’?"
