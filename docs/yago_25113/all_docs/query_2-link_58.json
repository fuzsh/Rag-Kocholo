        "text": "I’m writing this at the end of February, but by the time you read this we’ll all be at our 35th reunion in Hanover! I can’t wait for June 13-16.\n\nReunion has a lot going on for our classmates; I’m excited about helping to put together an alumni band that will play on Friday night. There’s no shortage of great musicians in our class and in the ’88s and ’90s, but right now the band will include myself, Eric Berlin on drums, Brad Drazen ’90 and Rob Crawford ’90 from Second Hand Jam, Alison Berger ’90 on vocals, Matt Greene ’90 on guitar, and Tim Burger ’88 on bass, Sue Abraham ’88 on vocals/guitar, Wayne Weil ’88 on bass and guitar, and Derek Pew ’88 and Andy Winslow ’88 on keyboards, vocals, and drums from the NRO band during our years. It will be odd doing mostly virtual practices, but we’ll be playing songs we all know. Regardless, it will be a blast! We also have two student bands playing, so it’s a great Friday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking of music, I recently drove out to Tucson, Arizona, to pick up a guitar amplifier and tried to see if I could grab lunch in Phoenix on the way back either with Anne Gazzaniga, Fred Miner, or Jacqueline Allen Tierney, but on short notice all were booked—totally understandable. Anne did mention a great place, Tacos Chiwas in Mesa—where she had taken Alec Scott and Karin Willinski when they visited—it was really good and will get added to my #nedsgoodeats list. I’m always looking for suggestions….\n\nWith reunion coming, please make the time to reach out to friends or reconnect with those you haven’t talked with.\n\nLet me know one best thing you experienced at reunion to have a full recap in our column after—or feel free to send restaurant recommendations. I’m not picky!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nIt’s the end of December as I write this, and we’re six months out from reunion! We have a lot of classmates who are interested and I’m hoping to see many of you in Hanover June 13-16!\n\nThis has been a challenging year; we lost two classmates in the past several months. Brian Frazier passed away on October 31, and Robin Buzby Galambos passed away November 30. Both of their obituaries will be on the 1989 “In Memory” page by the time you read this, and I encourage classmates to leave your thoughts in the “Class Reflections” section for each of them or email to me.\n\nI’m also dealing with the loss of Ed Gray ’88, who passed away November 25. Many of you knew Ed from Marching Band or just him being around campus. I knew Ed from seventh grade, and we stayed in touch long after—he was the best man at my wedding and was truly my best friend for 43 years. I was lucky enough to be able to visit him in Half Moon Bay, California, every quarter for the past two to three years. Despite all his health challenges, he was still Ed and had that same great outlook on life. Ed had a living celebration of life on November 18, and it was heartwarming to see so many Dartmouth alums there, including John Van Hooser, Jim Mills, Betsy Heafitz, Peter MacDonald, Bill Ruhl ’86, Roth Herrlinger ’90, Laura McEntee Bierwagen ’90, Dave Owens ’88, Becky Owens ’91, Joel Allison ’88, Derek LeLash ’88, Catherine Craighead Briggs ’88, Robin Joy ’88, Dana Beard ’88, Amanda Hanson ’88, Jeni Anderson ’88, Dan Estabrook ’88, Julie Pelkan ’88, and Kristen Steck ’88.\n\nWith reunion coming, please make the time to reach out to friends or reconnect with those you haven’t talked with. Losing a best friend such as Ed is making me cherish friendships and connections even more, and I really appreciate hearing from all the ’89s I reached out to—hoping to see as many of you as possible in June in Hanover.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWe’re a year out from our next reunion—35th! The theme is “Where the ’89s Are” and I can’t wait. We’re sharing it with ’88s and the ’90s, so stay tuned for more information. Antonia Rutigliano Nedder is our reunion committee chair and already people are excited to return to Hanover June 13-16—mark your calendars! If you’re interested in volunteering, let me know—happy to connect you with Antonia or the committee groups.\n\nWhat am I looking forward to at reunion? I’m eager to connect with other ’89s as well as ’88s and 90s; see the renovation progress on the Hop and the newly renovated Dartmouth Hall; enjoy good authentic Thai food at Tuk Tuk Thai (in the basement where 5 Olde used to be—it’s on my #nedsgoodeats list); some version of the different bands reuniting on the Green between Second Hand Jam, NRO, and The Distractions; try the maple vanilla soft-serve with maple sugar crumbles at McNamara Creamery; and see the wildflower plantings our class sponsored. That’s just a small amount of what I’m looking forward to—what are you looking forward to?\n\nWe’re about to be empty-nesters, with our younger daughter off to University of California, Davis, in September. I’m looking forward to traveling more, both to New Jersey to see my mom and to Tokyo to see hers, as well as friends in between. What have you ’89s who are now empty-nesters done with your free time? Enquiring minds want to know.\n\nPlease continue to reach out to other ’89s to connect, share stories, or tell me you’re coming to reunion in June!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nSummer’s here and while Summer Carnival is kicking up at Hanover, I’m enjoying the marine layer here in Redondo, California. It’s been great being back here with the family full-time in our L.A. office.\n\nLinda Salzhauer Swenberg shared the Mercury News story that our own Lt. Gov. Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis announced her bid for governor of California in 2026! Eli would be the first woman elected governor in state history! Eleni responded that she’s excited, and she’s still in touch with Julie Jordan Gunn, Patrick Munoz, Alec Scott, and a handful of alums from other classes here in San Francisco.\n\nLisa Collins, who’s been teaching art history, Africana studies, and American studies at Vassar since 1998, just published a new book, Stitching Love and Loss: A Gee’s Bend Quilt. Lauded by National Book Award-winning author Tiya Miles as an “achingly beautiful story of artistry, family, community, and place,” the book traces the story of a Gee’s Bend quilt to illuminate the perseverance and creativity of Black women quilters in a rural, Black-belt community. Gee’s Bend quilts are considered among the most important Black visual and cultural contributions to the history of art in the United States. The quilt in the story is currently at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where Lisa recently spoke in conjunction with the exhibit Called to Create: Black Artists of the American South. Lisa shared “I’ve been teaching at Vassar since 1998. My partner, Lee, teaches history nearby at SUNY New Paltz. We live in the funky river city of Kingston, New York, in the gorgeous Hudson Valley. Memphis, our oldest son, is a sophomore psychology major at the College of Wooster near Cleveland (where I’m from), and our youngest son, Sasha, is an electric guitar-playing ninth-grader at Kingston High School. All of us are looking forward to a summer full of art, music, and shows: Buddy Guy, Dead & Company, Alex G, Big Thief, Pixies, and (for the New Jersey-born and raised among us) Bruce. Personally, I’m secretly hoping for a chance to see Steve Lacy and Dijon!”\n\nYanna Yannakakis has published another book, Since Time Immemorial: Native Custom and Law in Colonial Mexico, from Duke University Press. It’s a fresh look at how customs were made and changed through time and by external colonial forces. Yanna said, “Thank you for your good wishes about my book—I am really happy that it is finally out. I am doing well, enjoying my work at Emory, playing pickleball (my new passion!), and reveling in springtime in Atlanta, which is hard to beat. My husband, Aiden, and I have two daughters, Marianna (20) and Maeve (15), and they keep us on our toes. We are currently in the middle of Maeve’s high school lacrosse season, which is a blast. We hope to travel to Greece this summer and see family after a long hiatus during Covid. I am in regular touch with Chris Gates, Anne Moellering, Liz Eilender, and Martha Boss Bennett—teammates and friends for life. I was last in Hanover in September 2021 with many of my former teammates to celebrate the endowment of the women’s lacrosse coaching position in Josie Harper’s name. It was an incredible weekend: an alumni game (hilarious) and a swim across the river afterward on an unusually warm fall day.\n\nWe’re a year out from our next reunion—35th! This one will be with the ’88s and the ’90s, so stay tuned for more information. Antonia Rutigliano Nedder will be chairing our reunion committee—stay tuned for opportunities to help make this the best reunion ever.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI want to thank again all the ’89s who wrote to me after reading my column. Thank you—the connection between all of us is truly special. Please be sure to reach out after reading this to your freshman dorm roommate, first-year trips people, or just anyone to see how they’re doing.\n\nI’m sitting in the apartment I rented in Rogers, Arkansas, for the past six months with it packed up and will be driving back to L.A. I’m still working for Walmart, but they have opened an office in L.A. so I can commute and come out to Arkansas a few days a month. Excited for me and my family and to be able to do fun stuff such as my band again.\n\nOne of the people I heard from was Liz Kraus. She had interviewed with Walmart in D.C. and she got the job! Liz will be coming to Bentonville, Arkansas, a couple of times a year! It would be great if it syncs up with when I’m going back—and two ’89s at Walmart! Soon we’ll be gaining on Jody Warden’s Dartmouth gang at Target.\n\nI also heard from Jeanette White, who is still a pediatrician up in Mill Valley, California, and remembered me doing a rap to Chaucer in one of our English classes—sadly, that rap, like some of Chaucer’s work, has been lost to time, probably for the better! Jeanette still keeps in touch with Karen Sprole, Christine Whalen, K.K. Lam, Jilann Spitzmiller Rogerson, Susan Morrison Lucey, Bonnie An Henderson, and Victoria Dalgliesh Kanaley.\n\nI talked with Susan Leong Yates to ensure she was okay following the natural damage in the North Island in New Zealand (she lives in the South Island). Their landline is working again and power is on too; no cell coverage. She phoned June Ying Ping the other day and talked about how she, June, and her friends “always put our hands up and volunteer to make things happen and better for others.”\n\nWe’re a year out from our next reunion—35th! This one will be with the ’88s and the ’90s so stay tuned for more information.\n\nAgain, thank you for connecting with me and please continue to do so and reach out to other ’89s to share stories, check in, or just say hi.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nIt’s the week before New Year’s and it definitely doesn’t feel like the holidays. I wish I were in the spirit and have tried—we made five gallons of my family’s eggnog recipe to give away to friends, but spirits were dampened by the death of my father and other challenges.\n\nI know many other ’89s lost family members this year as well, and I share in your grief and sadness. I’m incredibly grateful for the outreach from classmates and especially our ’89 Cares group, which is ready to help out classmates in need.\n\nFacebook instant messages continue to be a provider of content for my columns. I got a suspicious one from Dana Wakiji, and emailed her directly. Dana shared: “I lost both my stepmom and stepdad last year, plus my aunt and mother-in-law this year. It’s a tough thing being this age as we lose so many people. The good news is I am all right after dealing with breast cancer this year. They caught it early fortunately. I’m still looking for a full-time job. It’s kind of a Catch-22 since they want to fill sports jobs with young (read: cheaper) people and public relations and other communications jobs want you to have direct experience in those roles.” If you know, you know—Dana is an amazing sports writer whose career included covering the Detroit Red Wings, among other teams.\n\nSpeaking of hockey, Jeff Rosenthal emailed me “between periods of watching an Islanders game.” (I’d expect nothing less). “My wife, Jennifer, and I just became empty-nesters this fall. Both our kids turned their backs on Dartmouth with my daughter now a senior at Swarthmore and my son a freshman at Yale. Homecoming 2021 was my last shot to convince him to go green and yet, despite having an amazing time hanging out with a bunch of ’89s and seeing an exciting football overtime win over Yale, he decided a few weeks later to apply early to the losers of that game. I don’t see many ’89s that often (I always want to go to more of the N.Y.C. events) except Alex Simpson. We coached Little League baseball together for years and remain close. We bond nowadays over the fact that his kids also both decided not to go to Dartmouth (both of his are at Duke) and our never-ending heartbreak of being Mets fans.”\n\nDid you know about our class of 1989 pollinator project, which since the spring of 2021 has planted more than 12,000 square feet of plants for pollinator species? There’s a great article in The Dartmouth that explains it more in detail here: www.thedartmouth.com/article/2022/11/class-of-1989-pollination-project-b....\n\nOur class received an award during the fall Volunteer Officers Experience meeting for the pollinator project and its multiyear commitment to enriching the Dartmouth environment and community. Huge props to our class VP, David Hammond, and our service committee for all the energy they put into creating and spearheading this effort that is a lasting gift with not only an aesthetic but also an ecological benefit to the Dartmouth campus and surrounding Upper Valley.\n\nKathy Apruzzese Sherbrooke has written a new book, The Hidden Life of Aster Kelly, which is inspired by the true story of Kathy’s mother and her past as a model in 1940s Hollywood, with timelines from Los Angeles to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. It’s available this April.\n\nSend me your news, updates, or even fake Facebook instant messages—it would be great to hear from you.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI’m writing this in August, but by the time it comes out I will have been commuting from Bentonville, Arkansas, for my work in Walmart marketing back and forth to Redondo Beach, California. I figured commuting was better than moving the family during my younger daughter’s senior year in high school—I didn’t want the That Dad Award. I brought my mountain bike thanks to Winnie DelliQuadri, who told me how she and her son road-tripped to Bentonville to go mountain biking from Steamboat—yep, it’s that good.\n\nDavid Hammond recently shared in our class officers meeting about our class service project—planting wildflowers on campus and around the Upper Valley. David shared, “There are currently 11 sites around the Upper Valley—five around campus, downtown Hanover, three in the Old Dartmouth cemetery, a big hillside at the organic farm, and one at a White River Junction, Vermont, elementary school. The 11th site will be planted this fall at Anonymous Hall. If you go to Dartmouthservice.org you can see a Google map and images of the sites already planted.” It’s a great service project for our class that David spearheaded and leaves a lasting mark on the campus for our class. Take a look!\n\nNeil Abramson played football at Dartmouth and now his son, Parrish ’26, will be as well—also under Coach Buddy Teevens ’79 and also as a defensive back! Back at the end of August Neil said, “Very excited for my son. We’re taking him up next week and looks like I’ll be visiting campus a bit more in the next four years.”\n\nI also talked with Andy Wells, who shared, “My wife, Loey, and I moved to Alexandria, Virginia, three years ago, and I’m a director of the advanced manufacturing program at the National Science Foundation, making tens of millions of dollars in grants to people doing fundamental research on everything from semiconductors to 3-D printing to metal cutting. Loey is starting up a business as a personal coach, and our daughter lives nearby in D.C., where she’s a Congress and politics reporter at USA Today. I’ve been happy to see Tim Burdick a couple of times in the past year, as he’s traveled here for meetings from his home in Lyme, New Hampshire, where he and his wife, Kristin, are doctors at DHMC. I’ve also (virtually) run into Sarah Konrad at work, since she’s building scientific research communities in Wyoming when she’s not skiing, biking, or making beautiful art.”\n\nIf you’re on Facebook, sometimes you get random instant messages from friends that you realize didn’t come from them. Such a message appeared to come from Cathy Lee, and I reached out to her on email to let her know. Cathy said, “There are positives in getting hacked. I heard from you and Betsy Heafitz, whom I haven’t talked to in ages. We’re hoping to get together later this summer when she comes back to Massachusetts to visit with family. So there’s a silver lining! I’m almost an empty nester. I switched to a different investment advisory firm late last year. I’m mostly remote, enjoying the work and the people. My oldest is adulting in New York City. He’s a theater lighting person hoping to work his way up to being a theater lighting designer one day. My youngest is a rising senior at UMass Amherst studying mechanical engineering.”\n\nSo the next time you see what looks like a spam message on Facebook, email your classmate to let them know and catch up. And you never have to wait for a suspected spam from me to let me know your news. Happy holidays!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nDebra Roberson has now published four books available on Amazon and Barnes & Noble and worth reading! They include Listen and You Will Hear: Book of Short Stories and Poems; By F.A.I.T.H.: A Memoir; Flowers of the Ark-LA-Tex; and Cane River Chronicles: Surviving on the Prayers of Our Ancestors, which I read. Kudos to Debra!\n\nI’ve now been working for Walmart in marketing for more than six months, and the work is challenging and the people are great. It’s fun to go into any store and being able to talk to people there about new stuff I’m working on—big entertainment property marketing, such as Jurassic World Dominion, Netflix’s Stranger Things—and more. Fun fact: Classmate Ray Prado did the storyboards for Stranger Things in the first season, back when it was a “weird 1980s sci-fi show” that he told me about. And yes, I do have to watch all these shows on Netflix. If you have favorites, let me know. I won’t judge. So the job is a fun mix of my toy background and entertainment background with a very healthy dose of digital marketing. It’s always interesting, never dull.\n\nWhat keeps you busy—and happy? Who are you meeting up with? What’s on your iTunes or Spotify playlist? Class of ’89s want to know—email me!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nAnd just like that…two months have passed by since my prostate surgery, and recovery has been pretty swift. I’m super-grateful for my family and friends. Again, please get a PSA blood test with your next physical. It’s that easy and easily treatable if found early.\n\nDennis O’Connor wrote to tell me that in September he fought in his first boxing match in front of a crowd of 350, winning a three-round fight via technical knockout. Dennis also has volunteered to become the president of the Dartmouth Club of the United Kingdom and is working to relaunch the club there, which has died in the past several years.\n\nAlec Scott also wrote to share, “I’m a freelance writer based in Oakland, California, where I live in a small bungalow with my husband, David. Since moving here from Canada (for his work) I’ve been contributing to The Guardian, Sunset, the The Los Angeles Times, and Smithsonian magazine. A recent magazine piece had me learning how to play pickleball, and one of the people showing me the ropes was, by happenstance, the husband of another ’89, Kendra Ellis. This spring my first novel, Until It Shimmers, is being published by Ace of Swords. It focuses on a young Canadian who moves to Thatcher-era Britain, to London to come out into the thick of the AIDS crisis. A second one is to follow and looks at the younger brother of the one in the first. At the outset he heads to Dartmouth in the late summer of 1985 to join his freshman hiking trip through the Presidentials. The Freshman Book it’s to be called.\n\nLooking forward to catching up with some of you on our monthly Zoom (first Saturday of the month) or on Facebook.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nIt’s still fall here in Southern California (as much as it can feel like fall when it’s in the mid-70s) and I’m still a marching band roadie for my high school daughter. Unlike Dartmouth’s band, they actually do formations, move around, and have big percussion and electronics that need to get rolled on and off the field. Lots of fun; I can add driving a 26-foot box truck to my list of useful skills. But our 30th reunion bag is my go-to in the truck for snacks, USB power, etc. Our class has the best reunion swag!\n\nFresh off his re-airing on 60 Minutes I had lunch with David Frey on his recent trip to L.A. Great to catch up, as I hadn’t seen him in person since our 30th. David still leads the West Point Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.\n\nI had a great catch up with Kelly Jackson King. She is an obstetrician-gynecologist, as is her husband, and they now live in Atlanta, where they moved with their two kids after having lived in Las Vegas. Kelly went to Dartmouth Medical School after Dartmouth, but was an English major—as a premed, Kelly said how she was looking for balance rather than majoring in biology or chemistry. We realized we probably had multiple classes together—fun stuff! Kelly also helps small businesses to find advocates, legal counsel, financial planning, etc. Kelly still keeps in touch with Audrienne Walters Jordan, Damien Jordan, Melodee Armstrong ’90, and Sara Burbine Potter ’91.\n\nGive a rouse to Lenora Brown, who was named an Encore Network Champion. Encore Network brings together organizations and individuals focused on building more equitable communities and a global culture where older adults are vital contributors. As they said when giving her the award, “Lenora is transforming ideas about the value of older adults’ experience as a senior fellow with Cleveland Leadership Center and the director of Advanced Leadership Institute, inspired by Carl and Louis Stokes. Lenora launched and manages those programs that engage experienced leaders in civic issues and projects to drive long-term change that improves Cleveland and northeast Ohio. She brings an unusually varied skill set to her role, including nonprofit leadership, public-private partnerships and theater. Lenora serves on the Encore Network Leadership Council with a focus on communications.”\n\nI’m grateful in 2022 for more connections with our classmates, whether it’s the monthly Zoom meetings (first Saturday of every month), our Facebook page, or just meeting up with classmates in person. Feel free to drop me a line—it’s always great to catch up with ’89s!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nIt was great to be back on campus in July visiting our daughter during her Sophomore Summer. I saw Ray Prado (who’s working on storyboards for multiple new projects, but I’m sworn to secrecy) and his wife, Gesine, and am hoping that by the time you read this I will have seen many more ’89s at Homecoming this October.\n\nOn that East Coast trip I had coffee with Barbara Krautheimer in Amherst, Massachusetts, and it turned out she and my wife had colleagues in common—small world! Barbara is now the dean of the college of the humanities and fine arts at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I had tried to connect with Chris DeFrancis, Andrew McCallum, and Kyoungho Koh, but hope we’ll connect next trip.\n\nOur own Connie Womack Britton starred in the HBO series White Lotus. It’s a great look at what happens at a high-end resort in Hawaii and—no spoilers—worth a watch.\n\nI heard from John Sveen several months ago: “All is well. I live outside of Syracuse, New York, on Skaneateles Lake. My wife, Anne, and I have three daughters, Sarah (23), Mia (19), Lily (11). I’m an ophthalmologist and my wife is a pediatrician specializing in dermatology. Sarah will be starting Boston University dental school this summer, Mia is a sophomore at Colgate, and Lily is my little fifth-grade buddy. I reconnected with Chris Bailey and Deanna Emberley Bailey a few years back and we’ve had several nice summer visits. We are hoping to visit them one day in Bali now that they’ve moved! What a fun surprise to see my old roommate Dave Frey on 60 Minutes a week ago [on a segment about Camp Ritchie, the World War II military intelligence training center]! Super cool. Hoping he and Beth Wood Frey will stop by one day when they are visiting their daughter at University of Rochester Medical School!”\n\nI caught up with Greg Williams on our biweekly Zoom meeting; he recently spent two years running the nonprofit Hudson River Sloop Clearwater. Greg moved back to Seattle as his daughter wanted to finish high school there and is living in the CHOP neighborhood. He still keeps in touch with his sister, Laura Williams Gal ’91 and her husband, Christian Gal ’91; his sister-in-law, Bridget McCaffrey ’88; Jeff Zarse; Dave Heisterkamp; Marcus Weiss ’90; andLaurie Adams ’88, who is the CEO of Women for Women International, a nonprofit that is doing incredibly important work for the women in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nI asked on our ’89 Facebook page what was one thing people were hoping for this fall, and Kelley Busby Tiemens shared: “For the pandemic to get under better control, for people to be kinder to one another and for real stepping up, individually and collectively, around the climate crisis. It’s now or never.”\n\nWhat are you hoping for in 2022?\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nJustine Klineman put on a one-woman workshop (aka a work in progress) performance of solo show I’m An Asshole, and So Are You! April 3 on Zoom and it was great! In Justine’s words, the show “is about bringing our big human family together by liberating anger and conflict to access joy, connection, and accepting each other.” Jamie Heller and Kate Saunders Grove also attended. I talked to Justine and she talked about her path into acting, going back to doing a Meisner conservatory for two years and an apprentice program at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. Justine is most proud of her first one-woman show, Dancing with My Father: Tales of A Late Bloomer, which Justine wrote and directed as a way to deal with family, loss, and self-acceptance.\n\nKathy Apruzzese Sherbrooke has a new book out, Leaving Coy’s Hill, based on the life of pioneering feminist and abolitionist Lucy Stone. I’ve read an advance copy and it’s great—interesting how Kathy delineates Lucy’s friendship and then distancing from Susan B. Anthony. Worth a read!\n\nDAM featured the annual Pow Wow in the last issue, with paintings by our own Mateo Romero from the Dartmouth Pow Wow Suite he did for the Hood Museum years ago. This got me to asking classmates for their memories of the Pow Wow. Tito Basu says, “I remember feeling the drumming was so slow compared with back home in India. But then you get drawn into the slower rhythm and the spirit of it and the beautiful colors of fabric and feather and a feeling of something old and true.” Lenora Inez Brown says, “It was one of the few times I ventured to that area of Dartmouth’s property. I remember being in awe of so much.” Debra Roberson “I loved the Pow Wows and I still attend them today. We have Adai-Caddo Indians near where I live. I fell in love with fry bread and I embrace the Native culture, as my grandmother was Native Indian. I love the artwork that Mateo Romerodoes. I’m so glad I own some of his work.” Amala Devi says, “I attended a few times and always left feeling awestruck and also with a feeling of lacking of my own culture. The incredible depth of the experience—the intensity of energies, the potent concentration and absorption of the dancers, the sounds—I loved it. And I would feel ‘culture-less.’ I feel this way often here in Hawaii and also when I would attend dances on the pueblos of New Mexico.” Dave Heisterkamp says, “Two favorite memories are watching the dancers seek out the campus police officers and bring them into the dance circle freshman year at Occom Pond and watching Siobhan Wescott’s awesome dance moves in full regalia the year the Pow Wow was moved into Thompson Arena because of rain. The [May 14, 1988, Pow-Wow poster] has hung in my office for 27 years. Pow Wow is an attitude, not a physical location. It’s all about the interaction.” Dan Parish says, “I remember seeing Siobhan Wescott dance as well. My fondest Pow Wow memories came during my time in admissions when my colleagues Beth Paap ’87, John Sirois ’91, and Jarrid Whitney each danced or played a role in leading the dancers into the circle. The other great thing was that John Sirois successfully convinced the College to move the Pow Wow to the center of the Green—to the heart of the community—where it belonged!”\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nBy the time you read this, we will have been holding our weekly ’89 Zoom meetings for more than a year; we started them on the 89th day of 2020 as a way to celebrate our class, and through the pandemic they have been a great source of comfort for me and other ’89s to connect for a part of the day and see how we are doing, regardless of where we are in the world. I’m hoping that these Zoom meetings will continue, and I’ll try to be there every weekend at the afternoon and evening ones. If you’ve attended one of the Zoom meetings or you’ve never attended, feel free to come in for five to 10 minutes or stay longer whenever you want. All ’89s are welcome and it’s always great to see new and familiar faces.\n\nWhile I was back in New Jersey I did get to split some firewood and also replenish the supply in my parent’s garage; we had a year when we heated our house in New Jersey with only firewood, and that task consumed most weekends. I was talking to Ken Horton and Tim Derrick about this, as Ken reminded me that Tim’s dad was a wood-burning stove dealer in Vermont and Tim had to split wood throughout high school. Tim shared this update: “After returning to California (via reunion) from our world travels last year, we moved up to our cabin in the mountains near Truckee and have been here ever since. It has been an already socially distanced place to weather the Covid storm and I have had to rediscover my wood-stove roots and the wood-splitting experience that Ken and I shared during our summer at Moosilauke and the College Grant. We will use five cords in our wood stove this winter (that’s a lot!) and I have loved it (while my back may not agree with that statement)! Otherwise, all good on our side—family is healthy and I have been working on some wind projects in Nevada and (remotely) on my solar business in New Zealand, though it has been impossible to get back there at present. We may move the family to New Zealand for a couple years if and when the borders open up.”\n\nCongratulations to Betsy Johnston Scheffel and Heidy King-Jones ’04, who joined the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) board of directors/advisors in November. GBFB, the largest hunger-relief organization in New England, responded to historic levels of food insecurity in 2020. For more information, you can visit GBFB.org.\n\nI regret to inform the class that Verona Dorch passed away on February 24. Verona’s full obituary is on our 1989 class page and you can send me any remembrances of Verona to add to her page.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nBefore iTunes, before Spotify, we had two Dartmouth radio stations—WDCR 1340AM and WFRD “99 Rock FM.” Here are stories from fellow ’89s who brought us amazing music, news, sports, promotions, and events.\n\nMark Wachen says, “We had an absolute dream team with the Seths [Rosenblatt and Skolnik] as general managers, Carolyne Allen doing wonders with WDCR, Jennifer Avellino spearheading an incredible news department, Dave Kramer in sports, and everyone else too. Our weekly staff meetings were like having your 50 best friends all in one room, eating EBA’s, hanging out in front of that incredible mural of our logos that Catherine Truman painted.”\n\nSeth Skolnik says, “I went into Robinson Hall to sign up as a WDCR freshman trainee and made it my last stop before heading out of town in June ’89. For many of us the stations were where we chose to spend a significant portion of our time at Dartmouth.”\n\nSeth Rosenblatt says, “The radio station was my fraternity, and we will always have that bond. A bunch of us went to the local arcade over weeks and months playing those games where you collected tickets to ‘buy’ the station its first CD player. There’s not much I remember about many of my classes at Dartmouth, but I sure remember Dartmouth Broadcasting.”\n\nJennifer Avellinosays, “More than 90 percent of my radio time on WDCR and WFRD was doing news and I did a small amount of DJing on 99 Rock. Other news folks included Geeta Anand.”\n\nDave Kramer says, “WDCR was the ‘Voice of Dartmouth Sports,’ responsible for airing dozens of athletic events every year from all across the country. Because of the tremendous announcers and producers and countless MacGyver moments with equipment salvaged from middle school AV clubs, we somehow pulled it off.”\n\nPeter Zinman says, “Our senior year winter WFRD did a remote broadcast at Ascutney Mountain. An 11-year-old boy and his friend approached me and asked, ‘Are you Pete Zinman? Can I have your autograph?’ I signed both of their lift passes and gave them a pair of 99 Rock bumper stickers. I have never, before or since, felt so famous as I did at that moment.”\n\nCarolyne Allen says, “Some guys from a local band that often played the Tabard used to come into the station to try to get us to play their music. I don’t know if we ever did. That band was Phish.”\n\nJeff Gerst says, “I interviewed Don McLean; halfway through Seth Skolnik walked in and I madly motioned for him to switch the tape reels. I got Don to do all sorts of deep-cut stuff like chord structure on songs, inspirations, and a ton of IDs for the station. When we finally finished, I went to play back the tape and, unfortunately, it was blank!”\n\nMark Wachen remembered Karl Olguin: “I had trouble finding someone to be on-air during the Sunday 9 p.m. to midnight shift, and Karl was a metal fanatic. We came up with the ‘99 Minute Nightmare,’ where Karl could run wild. He relished that show and so did a fanatical following in the Upper Valley.” Carolyne Allen added: “Karl also did a Sinatra show! Such diverse music tastes.”\n\nApologies if I’ve missed any ’89s who worked on WDCR or WFRD—please email me your stories!\n\nMin Kocher has a new book out, Staying Out of Trouble in Pediatric Orthopaedics. As Min said, “The book is a different type of medical textbook. Really more the ‘art’ of medicine than the ‘science.’ Tips, tricks, advice, support to stay out of trouble.”\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nCongratulations to Geeta Anand, who was appointed dean of UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism! Previously she had been interim dean. Congratulations also to Scott McElhaney for being selected for inclusion in the Thomson Reuters 2020 Super Lawyers list as well as the 2021 Best Lawyers in America list.\n\nDuring Homecoming we held our weekly Zoom call but made it into our ’89 mini-reunion, and had numerous classmates from around the world, including Michael Ballard in Israel (who reminded us that Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo NES is celebrating its 40th anniversary) and Margo Miller in London, where she’s been now for 21 years. We heard from class president John Van Hooser, who has been volunteering doing mountain search and rescue during all of the fires in northern California. Linda Salzhauer Swenberg has been providing dyslexia intervention since 2009 after one of her children was diagnosed; she decided to take on the tutoring program herself and saw so much improvement that teachers started referring students to her. Andy Wells has a new job in Washington, D.C., with the National Science Foundation, giving money to companies in advanced manufacturing. Kristen Dillon shared that after 20 years living with her husband, Paul Blackburn ’88, in Hood River, Oregon, they moved to Washington, D.C., where she’s a health policy fellow. Per Kristen, “It’s been a wild year; we may go back to Oregon at the end of the year and we’ll take it from there! Back in Oregon Andy Wells lived 60 miles away and now we’re only 10 miles apart!” Wendy Mogan Phillips lives with her husband in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and has a freshman at Dartmouth (apologies, as I’m sure there are other ’89s with ’24s).\n\nWe also had multiple New York ’89s on the Zoom, including Peter Lurie, Diana Haladey, Russell Wolf, Bobby Jaffe (who has dogs named Nugget and Baker after Dartmouth places), and Alex Simpson. From Massachusetts we had Antonia Rutigliano Nedder and Joe Nedder, Ken Horton, Tracey Coleman, Laura Bordewieck Rippy, and Michael Conroy.\n\nKerry Kisiel Jones is an educator in Hartford, Connecticut, in this brave new world. She started a summer doctoral program at UPenn. Interesting factoid: Kerry was the principal for one of Mike’s kids’ principals for three years! We also heard from Laurie Fanger Reed and her neighbor Carolyn Gardella. Laurie is a teacher and Carolyn is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Washington.\n\nNicole Conte lives in Vermont, where she started working in a local elementary school when a preschool teacher didn’t want to go back. She’s enjoying working with 3-year-old children with masks on. Lenora Brown has been back in Cleveland for 10 years, working as senior fellow at the Cleveland Leadership Center, where she educates people on civic issues in the county and city and works to create partnerships to improve the city. Michael Hafner is living in Houston, enjoying hanging out with friends and grilling food. We also heard from Bridget Hust and Winnie DelliQuadri that D.D. Danforth Burlin has a Facebook Live cooking series—will have to hear more about this next issue!\n\nSpeaking of staying tuned, look for the next issue to cover the crazy story of ’89s who were left to run two licensed radio stations (WDCR and WFRD—99 Rock) and some of their tales from back then! If you have news, please feel free to send it to me!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nJeanne Shea has published an edited volume, Beyond Filial Piety: Rethinking Aging and Caregiving in Contemporary East Asian Societies, focusing on aging and caregiving in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and Korea; it examines emerging cultural meanings and social responses to population aging. Hardcover and e-book editions are available at www.berghahnbooks.com/title/SheaBeyond.\n\nMany ’89s who started knitting at or before Dartmouth are finding it’s still relaxing. Linda Salzhauer Swenberg taught herself back in Hanover from an encyclopedia. “I started with a bang (three sweaters) but now I’m knitting something completely mindless.” Bridget Hust knit a sweater for Dave Baldinger in exchange for a pair of skis; she feels Dave got the better deal! Anne Boardman Pohnert: “I tried to learn to knit a scarf for my dad once. It ended up as a cape for my Barbie doll.” Kris Pol-Williams: “I might have knit a bit on a random cotton thing [during lockdown]. I sell American brands of yarn here in the Netherlands via a small webshop, www.Woolly.nl, strangely named, as most of the yarn I sell is an acrylic or cotton blend.” Taraneh Azar: “I learned how to knit at age 5 from my paternal grandmother. During my language study abroad term in Germany, I knitted six sweaters. I remember Marie Polakowski Stimers learning how to knit that term. During the pandemic I dug out some old yarn and started a ‘patchwork’ sweater. I find knitting therapeutic. It relaxes me. Knitting has taught me patience and persistence. I also think knitting has improved my dexterity and creative abilities and has made me a better surgeon than I would have been otherwise.” Robin Byrd Winters told me, “Taraneh Azar taught me how to knit freshman year in New Hamp. I’ve made many sweaters since then. I’m inspired now to pick the needles back up. My daughter just learned to crochet this summer. Perhaps I’ll teach her to knit.” Tracy Coleman: “My grandmother taught me the basic stitches when I was young and I churned out a healthy supply of teddy bear scarves and Barbie doll blankets during my childhood. My freshman year undergraduate advisor, Molly Holt ’88, taught me how to read knitting patterns and I’ve been at it ever since. Siobhan Wescott and I knit coordinating Icelandic sweaters for Katharine Gagne and Geof Hobday as part of a wedding present! I have found knitting to be a great way to relax. I have definitely been knitting more during the last six months with the extra time at home.” Harmeet Dhillon: “I learned to crochet from my grandmother. When I came to Dartmouth I needed something to occupy myself on the long nights and weekends. I taught myself how to knit using a book. My college projects were mainly very nice scarves. I only began knitting for myself when I knit my husband, Sarv, two sweaters before we were married. In 2012, because Sarv really wanted a sweater made from local Sonoma County [California] sheep, I embarked on a multiyear project that involved negotiating with the shepherd to buy the year’s shearing, then getting it made into yarn in a local mill, some of it blended with softer California alpaca in different natural colors. I have a very stressful and all-consuming job as a trial lawyer and head of a firm. I’m also very actively involved in politics and run a civil rights nonprofit that I founded in 2019. I try to knit a little every day for sanity and to satisfy my creative urge.”\n\nWhat are you doing to relax, besides reading our Class Notes? Drop me a line to let me know.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nBy the time you read this in late August, some students will be preparing to return to Dartmouth and some will be preparing to take classes virtually. We still don’t know at this writing how it will be decided, but for ’24s, their first year will be radically different than our first year in Hanover. It’s unclear how first-year trips will be made up, but I’m hoping that Homecoming can happen October 2 safely for students and alumni by then.\n\nI’m writing this at the end of June and so much has happened since May 2, when I submitted our Class Notes for July/August. We were only 45 days into Covid-19 lockdown and George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were still alive. Suddenly, posting pictures of our kids, what I’m grilling, or cars seems less important. I know that fellow ’89s are hurting, and I want to understand and help. I want to listen and learn.\n\nOur 30th reunion theme of “Many Roads, One Spirit” seems incredibly pertinent, now more than ever. Our diversity and ability to respect the different roads classmates took to get to Dartmouth as well as the roads they have traveled afterward are all valid, we are united as one under Dartmouth. Our voices may be different, and it’s worthwhile to respect other voices and also understand how our words may affect others.\n\nOur own ’89 Cares group has been there for fellow classmates suffering from individual or community loss, and I want to reiterate that ’89 Cares is here to assist any of our classmates in need. You can reach it on our class site at 1989.dartmouth.org.\n\nAgain, I know I don’t have the answer, but I’m willing to be in conversations that may be uncomfortable, because I know my discomfort is slight in comparison to others. I look forward to our Saturday Zoom calls to have many conversations—difficult or not—with all of our classmates together. I’ll continue to post the details in our class Facebook page and class emails from time to time. The frequency may have changed by October, but I think the need will still be there to connect with classmates around the girdled earth, and we will make it happen.\n\nI regret to inform the class that Dennis Donnelly passed away on June 5. Dennis’ full obituary is on our 1989 class page and you can send me any remembrances of Dennis to add to the “Class Reflections” on his page.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWhen I started to write this, I was asking fellow ’89s what were two words that would describe Summer Carnival, but the coronavirus epidemic hit and suddenly that seemed less important.\n\nI’ve been heartened to hear of all of our classmates who are on the frontlines helping patients and fighting Covid-19. Thank you to every ’89 and Dartmouth alum who is working against this. With almost all of us sequestered to our homes, connection is the one thing I crave, as I’m sure many of you do. And although we can’t meet for a cup of coffee or lunch, our weekly Zoom calls have been a great way to connect with classmates around the world, from Europe, across the United States, and over in Asia. And we’re happy that our girls are both home with us—we’re passing the time baking pretzels, making different dishes, and reaching out to family and friends way more than we used to.\n\nI look forward to when we can get back together in person, visit family in different cities, go back up to Dartmouth—or even more than around the block. Whenever that is, I’m looking forward to it and in the meantime will be on Zoom every Saturday at 4 and 11 p.m. Hanover time.\n\nI talked to Frank von Hippel recently, as he has a new book that should be out in May, The Chemical Age: How Chemists Fought Famine and Disease, Killed Millions, and Changed Our Relationship with the Earth. Frank is teaching at Northern Arizona University, where his “research is in the area of ecotoxicology, primarily working with vulnerable communities impacted by pollution.” Frank also hosts a monthly podcast called the Science History Podcast. Frank also related, “My wife, Cathy Compton von Hippel, is also a member of our class. We have three kids. Our oldest, Max, is a first-year Ph.D. student in computer science and math at Northeastern; our daughter, Sophia, is a sophomore at the University of Arizona; and our little guy, Sam, is in sixth grade. I’m a close friend of Harvey Fracht, who is now a corneal surgeon in Pennsylvania.”\n\nKathy Appruzzese Sherbrooke has also finished a new novel, Leaving Coy’s Hill, and “the opening has been accepted into the spring issue of Embark Literary Journal, an online journal dedicated to showcasing select unpublished works of fiction. I’m thrilled to share it with you!”\n\nI regret to inform the class that Jay Warden passed away on March 1 due to complications from influenza and pneumonia. Jay’s full obituary is on our 1989 class page, and you can send me any remembrances of Jay to add to his page.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nIt’s the week before New Year’s, and it’s been great having my daughter, Maia ’23, home from Dartmouth; we flew out to Boston to get her and then drove down to New Jersey to have Thanksgiving with my parents and sister before flying back to California. Nowadays, winter break goes from the week of Thanksgiving to the beginning of January, so it’s extended—and makes more sense than when we’d have Thanksgiving off and some classmates would go home and some would stay. Since she’s been back, we’ve gone through all the Harry Potter movies, almost all of the Bond films. Will miss her when she goes back to Hanover in a week.\n\nSpeaking of my daughter, Mike Sowa now lives up in Quechee, Vermont. I saw him at our 30th reunion, and he emailed me this past fall saying he ran into Maia, who helped him with tickets at the Hop! Small world. Mike said, “Too funny seeing the next generation in operation on campus.”\n\nFiona Bayly emailed to let me know that for the third year in a row she won the USA Track & Field 15K Masters National Championship! Fiona Bayly is also the current Masters women’s age division 50-54 world champion in the half marathon and the new American record-holder in her age division for the road mile as of August, timed in 5:23 while racing in Flint, Michigan.\n\nTanya Timms Egenolf emailed and let me know, “We are just keeping busy in Oceanside, California, with three kids—17, 14, and 12. Starting to look at colleges and trying to keep them on the West Coast! I keep in touch with Stacy Higgins, Harriot Cato Pinkerton, Robin Byrd Winters,and Cortney Worrell.”\n\nHoping again to see many of you in my travels, and if you make it to southern California, let me know! If you have news to share, email me and I’ll include in our next edition.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWinter Carnival—that time of year when, 30 years ago, it seemed like buses of uninvited guests, or “randoms,” would show up and expect a place to sleep. But we had cool ice sculptures, both on the Green and around campus; we also had canoe and lunch tray sledding on the golf course. Here’s what some of our classmates said in a few words what Winter Carnival meant to them. I’ve loosely clumped them together where they made sense. Mitchell Dauchy, “Where the wild things are”; Anne Boardman Pohnert, “Tradition on ice!” and “Where the tiled things are”; Heather Killebrew, “Wild thing”; Michelle Erin Johns Flanagan, “Wild rumpus”; Beth Robischon, “Posters”; Michael Ballard, “Theta Delt snow slide”; Michael Conroy, “Ski jump”; Bobby Jaffe, “Skiing”; Linda Salzhauer Swenburg, Russell Wolf, Jim Mills, Gwendolyn Mogan Phillips, “Keg jump”; Tom Avril, “Downhill canoeing”; Nancy Obler Kaufman, “Sledding on the golf course on [Thayer] trays”; Diana Haladey, “Snow sculpture”; Andy Camp “Random visitors”; Katie Shubert Sawrey, “Jump randoms”; Libby Carrier Doran, “Random Invasion”; Jay Lott, “Randoms sleeping in hallways and lounges”; Anne Davis, “Outta dodge”; John Mitcham,“Damn cold”; Catherine Baggia Duwan, “30-below wind chill.”\n\nNicole Waldbaum Moser’s reply was, “Off term. I spent two summers at Dartmouth and avoided two winters; one on the foreign study program to Toulouse, traveling all over Europe with Gesine Albrecht, Julia Powell O’Brien, Kate Enroth, Yanna Yannakakis, and JillAnn Spitzmiller, to name a few, and then winter of 1987 working in Al Gore’s Senate office as a Rockefeller Center intern when he ran for president the first time around, living in an apartment complex with a ton of ’89s, including Julia Powell O’Brien, Heather McLelland, Dan Rivers, Dennis Morgan, and Tom Hogan. Essentially Dartmouth on location in D.C.—a much milder winter!”\n\nOn a serious note, I regret to inform that our classmate Geri Toyekoyah passed away October 12. Classmates remember Geri as a “sweet, caring, smart, funny, amazing person, devoted mother of three, loved by many. She was a treasure to all who knew her. I’m so sad that she’s left us.” We have updated our 1989.dartmouth.org “In Memory” section to include Geri; if you have any thoughts or remembrances of Geri to add to her class reflections, please send them to 89secretary@gmail.com and I will update the site.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWow. I’m still in awe of the connected feeling from our 30th reunion; it’s been two weeks, but it still has a hold on me. What a great time, and to experience it through my 13-year-old’s eyes was even better. She loved the Hop and all its music rooms. Baker Tower again did not disappoint—and the small discussions we had throughout Dartmouth Hall were powerful and seemed almost to be jumping-off points where we need to find a place to continue those discussions and not wait another five years. I loved that we were able to celebrate the lives of all 16 classmates who are no longer with us in a truly memorable experience; for those who want to read the words spoken on the Bema for each person, they are in the “In Memory” section of our 1989.dartmouth.org website. I know that it took a literal village of volunteers from our class to pull this off across multiple areas, but I have to thank our three reunion chairs for having the vision for our 30th and then recruiting people and in the end pulling it all together. Ken Horton, Shannon Reid, and Meg Wade, thank you so much for your commitment, determination, and enthusiasm, which made the 30th so memorable for so many of us.\n\nAnd thanks to everyone who showed up—some for their first or second reunion and some lucky ones who have been to all six reunions. Here are just a few ’89s summing up our reunion in one word: Andy Camp, “Silent-Disco”; Zach Levine, “Happy”; Ed Barker, “Short”; Alex Simpson, “Inclusive”; Tressa Munoz, “Reconnection”; Antonia Rutigliano Nedder, “Warm”; Everett McCassey, “Caring”; Millie Bahn, “Unexpected”; Lenora Brown, Jen Lois, “Rejuvenating”; Catherine Baggia Duwan, “Heartfelt”; Michael Ballard, “Friendship”; Russell Wolff, “Enduring”; Anne Boardman Pohnert, “Meaningful”; Paul Mahoney, “Vibrant”; Linda Kelly, “Nostalgic”; Shannon Gorrell Reid, “Glowing”; Beth Robischon, “Delightful”; Mike Conroy, “Crepe-tastic”; Tim Brody, “Surprising”; Evan Betzer, “Thrilling”; Jennifer Block Cromheecke, “Restorative”; and Martha Boss Bennett, “Verbose.” Mine would be “Connection.”\n\nSince this issue is coming out in the fall, I, along with 17 other ’89s, have incoming freshmen who will have already done their first-year trips, eaten green eggs and ham, and will be partway through their first term of classes. I’m super dad proud of my daughter for getting in and can’t wait to see what her Dartmouth experience is, as I know it will be different from ours, though there will be some things that are the same. I’m looking forward to having those talks with her, as I’m sure many of you are with your children regardless of where they go—it’s not just what are they doing, but how are they doing. It will be a big adjustment, both for our kids and for some of us as well.\n\nAt reunion I promised that when I was traveling, I’d reach out to ’89s in that area and try to connect. True to my word, I’m in Minneapolis this week for meetings and reached out to fellow ’89s Joe McCrae, Betsy Aldrich, Bridget Hust, Libby Carrier Doran, Kara Benson Barrow, Bill Dean, and Rob Albright—even though I’d seen many of them in Hanover!\n\nSuch is the bond of our class. I hope that as you travel this summer, either for fun or work, that you do the same to reach out to classmates—whether you know them well or not. Really, we all share the Dartmouth experience.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI’m writing these Class Notes 45 days before our 30th reunion, but by the time you read this, we will have had an amazing 30th reunion with all of our classmates. Really looking forward to taking my youngest daughter with me so that she can experience Dartmouth with her own eyes.\n\nTwo weeks ago I attended the Los Angeles Dartmouth Call to Lead presentation, and it was amazing—they really brought Dartmouth to L.A., complete with the wilderness, canoes, and a cabin! It’s a massive road show tour, but was well worth attending. It was great to see, albeit briefly, Anton Anderson, Jan Brzeski, Adam Glick, Rich Reilly, and Seth Skolnik. I was excited that my wife and older daughter, who is a ’23, were able to attend and meet other ’23s from the area as well as hear from President Hanlon and the amazing stories from Dartmouth grads and how they collaborated with their professors.\n\nAs we get ready for our oldest daughter to go to Hanover for first-year trips and her freshman year, I wonder what her Dartmouth experience will be like? What will be the same as mine and what will be different? It’s already different in terms of the dorms; she won’t get to live in South Fayer first year. I know I have my own Dartmouth experience, and I’m excited for her to have her own Dartmouth adventure with classmates, roommates, and professors. I just have to figure out how many times we’ll be visiting Hanover this year, which is always a nice problem to have.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nGreetings from in-flight reunion writing! It’s been a whirlwind two months and, by the time you read this, we’ll be a month away from our 30th reunion! There’s still time to sign up, and the reunion committee has done an excellent job of working to make it the most inclusive reunion we have had.\n\nI heard from Beth Frey, who wrote me about herself and her husband, David Frey, who will both be at our reunion June 12! “We have lived in Cornwall, New York, since 2004. I teach social studies (primarily AP U.S. history) in a public high school nearby and David is now a full professor of history and the director of the West Point Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies (CHGS). David absolutely loves his job teaching and mentoring cadets at West Point and he is also very busy developing educational programs and working on projects as director of the CHGS. His work on mass atrocity prevention has led him to make many meaningful connections at West Point, across the nation and around the world—it continues to be an exciting journey. Our three children (ages 22, 20, and 17) are now all out of the house and we are at that empty-nest moment in time when we need to develop a new rhythm. I’m trying to embrace the situation, but I’ll admit it isn’t my favorite. After 22 years of focusing primarily on the kids, it has been interesting to take some time to ponder what I personally want out of this next phase of life. I’m trying some new activities both at work and in the community to see which direction I want to take—I hope I will have my ‘aha’ moment soon!”\n\nQuick plug for Jan Brzeski, who manages the Bartlett Tower Society. We are just four people shy of our class setting a new record for Bartlett Tower Society membership before our 30th reunion. Joining is easy—it takes only five minutes when you log into your IRA or 401k account page. I’ve joined, and it was simple! If you have any questions, visit our class website for more info.\n\nIn reaching out to so many of our classmates to see if they’re coming to reunion, I know that many cannot make it—whether it’s timing, expense, or other reasons—but I urge you to visit our class page, 1989.dartmouth.edu, to enjoy reunion from wherever you are. It may not be the same as being in Hanover, but I hope it sparks the idea to reconnect with old classmates. Hope to see many of you in Hanover—I’ll be the guy wearing something green!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nThe year 2019—our 30th reunion and the 250th anniversary of the College—coincidence? Reunion is June 13-16, and reunion co-chairs Ken Horton, Shannon Reid, and Meg Wade are asking everyone to save the dates. Details are on our class of ’89 Facebook page and our ’89 class website (www.1989.dartmouth.org).\n\nIn this issue you see the 25 most influential Dartmouth alumni as voted by the faculty. But who were your most influential alumni? Steve Blank: “Ted Geisel ’25, Bob Keeshan ’42 (a.k.a. Captain Kangaroo), and Fred Rogers ’50.” Himraj Dang: “Mike Colby ’84. We share a deep common interest in environmental economics.” Lenora Inez Brown: “Jerry Zaks ’67. Knowing his theater background made it all the more possible.” Heidi Reich: “My answer is always Jeff Hoover ’88.” Maryann Mungovan Murphy: “My brother, John Mungovan ’86, and Dan Driscoll ’86, for introducing me to my husband, Tim!” Susan Allen Cera: “The Perry family, my next-door neighbors growing up. Father was Fred Perry. Three boys all went to Dartmouth in the late 1970s and early 1980s.” Catherine Baggia Duwan: “I applied early decision because I saw a picture of Charlie Winslow ’82 on the cover of a Men of the Ivy League calendar. Never met him, but his brother, Jon Winslow ’87, married Nellie Huang!”\n\nKaryn Olivier wrote, “Things are super hectic here, but great! I am an associate professor and program head of the sculpture department at Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. I was awarded the Rome Prize, an 11-month fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. My work often intersects and collapses multiple histories with present-day narratives. (I’ve completed two public works this past year that engage these complex histories—The Battle is Joined in Vernon Park in Philadelphia and Witness at the University of Kentucky.) Rome is the ultimate site to continue this investigation into multiple and conflicting histories. The end goal is to fabricate artworks that are in dialogue with my researched public artworks and sites. I am still very much in touch with Anita Hamilton in N.Y.C., Donielle Howard, Adriane Harris, and, of course, my twin, Karla Olivier!”\n\nColette Ellis writes, “My coaching business, InStepConsults, is my primary focus these days. Now living in Brooklyn Heights, N.Y.C. Happy times this summer were times I made it out to Rockaway Beach. I went up to Dartmouth last July when I was invited to speak for the Young African Leaders Initiative Mandela Washington Fellows Program that the College hosts every year.”\n\nJulia Powell O’Brien writes,“We had a great Hartford mini-reunion with Kerry Kiesel Jones, Catherine Baggia Duwan, Mike Blechner, Jason Lobo, and Russell Wolf. I am in touch with Jen Large Bowman, Gesine Albrecht, Nicole Moser, Bridget Fawcett, Mary Kay Caricato, Laurie Sammis, Martha Boss Bennett, Heidi Briggs Buonanno, Kate Enroth, and Jen Block Cromheecke. My husband and I have lived in West Hartford, Connecticut, for 22 years and we have three great kids. I am the VP and general counsel at BL Cos. and it continues to be a lot of fun.”\n\nOn a sad note, I regret to inform everyone that Chesley Adler passed away September 21, 2018. Chesley will be remembered for her spirit, humor, passion, and grace. We will honor and celebrate Chesley and our other classmates who are no longer with us at our reunion in June.\n\nIt’s sad to write in this column about two classmates passing in the same year. I urge you to reach out now to connect—or reconnect—with your fellow ’89s.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI heard from Lisa Rabbe, who with her husband, Francis Power, moved back to the United States after 20 years in London. “We are based in Marion, Massachusetts. I took some time out to press the career reset button. I have done a career and personal pivot from in-house corporate life to small startup life and from London to Massachusetts. I launched my own political risk and public policy-regulatory consultancy with tech, financial technology, and financial-sector clients on both sides of the Atlantic. I work on policy and regulatory challenges for 21st-century financial services companies, market infrastructure, and products including artificial intelligence, block-chain, and crypto assets. My company website is www.stratosphere-advisors.com. Francis and I have a small sailboat and are enjoying our new life in Marion, population 5,000, after many years of fun but intense life in London. Most recently, Francis and I just attended Professor Pease’s great lecture on Moby Dick on Nantucket, Massachusetts, this past weekend, where we caught up with Brian Freyermuth and Amy Holden. I also connected with Emily Glasser while on the island. I’m reconnecting with many old ’89 friends and new ’89 contacts on this side of the Atlantic and am keen to connect with more.”\n\nTracy Benchley Turner and I connected; we had been on our freshman trips canoeing, so it was great to catch up. “My husband, Chris, and I have lived in Rye, New York, for 15 years now, which is very hard to believe. Even crazier, our kids are almost all adults—our oldest, Will, 21, is a rising junior at Georgetown; our 19-year-old daughter, Cate, is a rising sophomore at Johns Hopkins University; and our youngest son, Michael, 15, is about to start high school. I see lots of ’89s, some frequently, some once in a while—Emily Glasser, Kristen von Summer Waldorf, Russell Wolff, Laura Fitch Mattson, Jen Large Bowman, Barbara Kuck Close, Jamie Heller, Leslie Timothy, Bobby Jaffe, D.D. Danforth Burlin, Sara May, Libby Carrier Doran. I’m a social worker by training and have been helping run bereavement groups for kids ages 5 to 18 who have lost a parent or a sibling, as well as simultaneous adult groups for the parents. It sounds rough, but it’s actually really wonderful and rewarding—the kids get so much out of the groups—just knowing that they’re not alone is the biggest gift.”\n\nMarnie Curry and her family are back in Alameda, California, after their multi-year adventure living in Peru. “We enjoyed our South American adventures tremendously. We were fortunate to travel extensively throughout Peru and enjoyed visits to Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia as well. Our biggest thrill was returning with two bilingual boys. I’m looking forward to returning to Hanover next June and reconnecting with other ’89s. I’ve been blessed this year to spend time with Nancy Felix Bernard, who moved to Pittsburgh near where I was raised. My other Dartmouth connection is the DOC of Northern California cabin up near Truckee (www.dartmouth.org/clubs/docnc/cabin.php). My family just spent a few days up there savoring the blue skies, star-filled nights, and beauty of the Sierras. It’s so impressive that a group of alums has managed to maintain this cabin for so many decades.”\n\nOn a sad note, I regret to inform that our classmate Marvin Masterson passed away July 17. I know that he touched the lives of many of us while at Dartmouth and afterwards as well. We will be honoring and celebrating Marvin as well as our other classmates who are no longer with us at our reunion in June.\n\n–Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nFall is here, which means students are back at Dartmouth, the leaves are changing, and I get to go back up to Hanover for Class Officers Weekend. And stock up on maple syrup from Mac’s Creamery. In the summer it makes its own maple syrup ice cream, and it’s amazing. Thanks to Ray Prado and his wife, Gesine, for introducing my family to it. I may stretch the carry-on limit coming back….\n\nClint Stinchcomb was named president and CEO of CuriosityStream, the award-winning documentary streaming service founded by John Hendricks (founder of Discovery Channel.) There, Clint is tasked with “building on the success of the streaming service, home to world-class original documentary films and series exploring science, technology, history, nature, health, and more.” Clint joined CuriosityStream as chief distribution officer and has been in traditional and digital media for more than 25 years.\n\nOur own Geeta Anand is joining the faculty of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism as acting professor of reporting, teaching students of differing experience levels in the school’s foundational reporting class. Geeta will also offer strategic guidance for the overall reporting curriculum, serve as a master’s thesis advisor for second-year students, and take part in school governance as a member of the school’s senate faculty. Geeta has been involved in journalism now for 27 years, with a career spanning The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, where she spent the past 10 years as a foreign correspondent in India.\n\nBy the time you read this, my oldest will be in the throes of her college applications, and we’ll be supportive of any school she wants to go to. Fiona Bayly responded to my column asking for favorite covers (hers are “Running Down a Dream,” “Got It Made,” “Broken Wings”) and then, as we went back and forth, Fiona remarked that “the ultimate endurance event is being a good parent.” Wow. That’s good stuff. What to you makes a good parent, aunt/uncle, or even a mentor? Would love to hear back from you all. We are now less than a year away from reunion, and I’m already getting excited. Mark your calendars for June 13-16. Thankfully, our oldest daughter’s high school graduation is not that weekend…so I know I’ll be there. I’m hoping that as many ’89s can make it as possible.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWow, what a whirlwind trip we had just a week ago, hitting 15 colleges and universities throughout all of New England. We heard from a lot of ’89s, but didn’t have time to meet with most (even though I wanted to), as I had to honor my daughter’s trip to find the school that fits her best. Stay tuned as I continue on this journey.\n\nMichael Herring is the new lacrosse coach at Blue Ridge in Virginia and has been busy since the fall working to change the way the team plays, both on offense and defense. “The way we do things is very different from how they’ve done them in the past, so it has been a challenge for the boys,” Michael says.\n\nDavid Groff was named in-house legal counsel for the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls! Before this David was chief deputy for 10 years in the Klamath County district attorney’s office, and he is also an adjunct professor at Oregon Tech in the humanities and social sciences department.\n\nMy mom is an orthoptist, which is an eye muscle therapist who works with ophthalmologists. We have several ophthalmologists in our class, but wanted to start off with Kristin Casale and Tara Sweeney. Here’s what Kristin had to say: “Tara Sweeney and I were both premed at Dartmouth and did a summer working at my dad’s office in the Bronx. We were technicians, and the office staff gave us all the patients that no one else wanted to deal with. We didn’t know any better so we saw them all. Tara loved it, and I was kind of ‘meh’ on the whole idea of ophthalmology as a career. I was more into pediatrics or biology—or so I thought. Tara graduated a year ahead of me and went into ophtho. She told me I would be crazy not to go into it and inherit my dad’s practice. She loved it, and she still does. We are still holding out as a single-doctor practice. She and I each work a few days a week and are essentially one full-time doctor. We have two people who work for us, and it’s great. Anyway, I’m the social one, and Tara does all the surgery. She’s sticks to the eye pathology and gets them in and out. So we are a good team. I see the patients with dry eye and blepharitis who need to talk, and she fixes the people with cataracts and glaucoma. It works pretty well.”\n\nI hope in a future article we’ll get to hear from Bonnie An Henderson, who was just named president of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery and is a clinical professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, as well as from Lisa Gamell and Francis Mah.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWow, how the time has gone! By the time you’re reading this, we’ll be 12 to 13 months out from our 30th reunion. I can’t wait and looking forward to seeing as many ’89s as possible. More to come over the next months from the team, but I’m excited.\n\nI’m lucky in that, with my travels, I had two mini-reunions in New York, first with Carrie Luft and Josh Adler, and then Chris Baldwin and Mike Ballard two nights later. Chris was my sophomore roommate, but I don’t think we had seen each other in 25 years. It felt great and wonderful to connect with these four alums while I was in New York for the annual Toy Fair.\n\nAt the end of that same week, we had our annual Los Angeles ’89 mini-reunion, hosted by Rich Reilly and Christie Neuberger Reilly at their home. It was a great Saturday night to hang out inside and talk with Anton Anderson, Eric Bunting, Jan Brzeski, Andy Camp, Chris Di Mauro, Sonya Ooten Frisina, Adam Glick, Justine Klineman, Matt Ridenour, Tammy Krutchkoff Saunt, Kim Buresh ’90 and Winnie Huang ’92. It was fun but colder in L.A. than it had been in New York the same week!\n\nWhile you may not have seen her on TV, our own Sarah Konrad, two-event Olympian at the Torino games, was in Pyeongchang behind the scenes, helping out the Team USA biathlon team as part of the massive team Dartmouth presence at the winter Olympics. She was looking forward to some powder skiing in Japan afterwards. She wasn’t able to connect with Cliff Bernstein this time, but perhaps her next trip.\n\nCongratulations to Deanna Emberley Bailey, who was named director of education at the Vermont Energy Education Program, or VEEP for short. Deanna previously had worked there and is currently working on her doctoral degree from the University of Vermont. She and Chris Bailey live in Huntington, Vermont.\n\nTom Cody was recognized recently for his work in helping with the capital campaign for Children Inc., whose mission is to fight poverty through high-quality education experiences for children and by supporting families through multi-generational approach.\n\nI also heard from Jeffrey Thomas, who wrote, “Our two oldest are in school right now (including a ’19). My steptwins started school this fall—Marquette and U of San Diego. We also have 9-year-old twins in fourth grade, so we are still deep into the kid business. I am involved in a variety of education businesses, as CEO, chairman or director. They are distributed around the United States—including in N.Y.C.; Raleigh, North Carolina; Chicago; and Oakland, California—which keeps me moving! My wife has her own student travel company, Quo, which is coming along nicely.”\n\nWho will you run into on a business trip? It’s worth connecting with fellow ’89s, either on our Facebook page or by email and letters. I can guarantee you that reaching out and having coffee, lunch, etc., with fellow ’89s is totally worth it. By the time you read this in April, I’ll have gone on a Northeast college trip for our oldest daughter (yikes!), and hope to have more news on ’89s we met on our college road trip. And, yes, Dartmouth is definitely one of the planned stops!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nFiona Bayly wrote in to let me know she is the 2017 National Masters Champion in the USA Track & Field 15k Championships that were held in sub-freezing weather in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late October. Fiona finished the year undefeated in her age group and turned 50 this summer, “trying to keep at it, as so many of us are, with just normal life stuff too!” Fiona remembers a tradition from Dartmouth fondly that she misses—“the daily ‘run’ to the Hinman boxes!”\n\nI’ve been in bands since grade school—actually in eighth grade with Eric Berlin. We still play out in bars and are always looking to add songs to our list that could make people get out on the dance floor and have fun. So without further notice, here’s some picks from the ’89s who responded to the question, “What three songs would you want to hear a so-so cover band playing in a bar?” Coincidentally, this gives us a head start on the playlist for the tent for our 30th reunion in June 2019! Alex Selby picked Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man,” Van Halen’s “Running with the Devil”; Anne Boardman Rohnert, Billy Joel’s “Downeaster Alexa,” Dexy’s Midnight Runners’ “Come On Eileen,” Steve Earle’s “The Galway Girl,” Eric Clapton’s “Lay Down Sally” and “I Shot the Sheriff,’ Paul Simon’s “Graceland” (Anne was on vacation and heard a great band playing and sent more suggestions mid-vacation); Bob Jaffe, Grateful Dead’s “Bertha,” Steve Miller’s “Dance Dance Dance,” The Band’s “The Weight”; Bridget Hust, anything NRBQ; Carolyn Allen, The Replacements’ “I’ll Be You,” Weezer’s “Buddy Holly”; Chris Baldwin, INXS’ “Don’t Change,” Rick Springfield’s “Jessie’s Girl”; Chris Drew, Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing,” Steve Miller’s “Jungle Love”; Eddie Barker, Dire Straits’ “Sultans of Swing,” Earth Wind & Fire’s “September,” Steve Miller Band’s “Fly Like An Eagle”; Eric Berlin, “all the songs our band played in eighth grade, plus a lot of Led Zeppelin”; Ken Horton, Foo Fighters’ “Learn to Fly,” Jimi Hendrix’s “Little Wing,” Spencer Davis’ “Gimme Some Lovin’ ”; Lenora Brown, Deep Purple, Journey’s “Stone in Love”; Martha Boss Bennett, Old Crow Medicine Show’s “Wagon Wheel,” Tears for Fears’ “Shout,” Three Dog Night’s “Shambala”; Meg Sommerfeld ’90, Joni Mitchell’s “Big Yellow Taxi,” Pretenders’ “Middle of the Road,” Tom Cochrane’s “Life is a Highway”; Todd Timmerman, Billy Joel’s “Piano Man.”\n\nThanks again to everyone who gave me suggestions. There are some songs on the suggestion list we already do, and others, well thank you for thinking more of our abilities. And now I’m curious what your three songs are—are they ones still around from when we were at Dartmouth? Are they ones you’ve picked up since then or from your kids? I’m finally realizing my girls know more about new music than I do, which is great. I teach them about the classics (anything pre-2004), and they keep me up to date on the new stuff. Here’s to continuing to learn, whether it’s from family, friends, classmates or any other sources.\n\nFeel free to email me, snail mail me, Instagram me your news, updates or even top three song picks. I can’t promise I’ll be able to play them, but will definitely take them for a spin.\n\n–Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nHappy New Year! My New Year’s resolution: Meet up with more ’89s on my trips ’round the girdled earth. What’s yours?\n\nBarbara Krauthamer was recently recognized by the Association of Black Women Historians. She and her husband, Noah (Columbia ’90), live in Northampton, Massachusetts, and says, “I spend the better part of my weekends shuttling from gymnastics meets to lacrosse games and tennis tournaments and also cheering for my husband, who started competing in triathlons. Somehow in the midst of all of this I manage to write books on African American history and made my way up the academic ladder to my relatively new position as dean of the graduate school at UMass Amherst. I see Joanna Morris from time to time as our sons are the same age. I try to keep in touch with Lisa Collins, Aaron Straight and Andy Fields. I talk to Kristin Roth pretty regularly. She lives in London, where she teaches Russian history at University College, which gives me a great excuse to do research in the British Library and U.K. National Archives at least twice a year!”\n\nCongratulations to Siobhan Wescott, assistant professor of public health at North Dakota State University, who received a four-year National Science Foundation grant for diabetes research. As Siobhan said to me, “In Fargo. And, before you ask, no one says, ‘Yeah, sure, you betcha’ except in jest. And usually it’s me! Keeping ridiculously busy on the board of directors of the Association of American Indian Physicians and as its representative to the American Medical Association. Still researching vitamin B12, so if anyone has stories or questions, please ask them to contact me at siobhan.wescott@ndsu.edu.”\n\nLaura Bordewieck Rippy LinkedIn with me, saying, “Lots of good things going on here. Happy healthy kids who are pushing all our buttons as they are 11, 13, 15. (Maybe that’s why my husband and I are now hooked on yoga.) I just started a new job (stay tuned as I don’t have LinkedIn updated).”\n\nJamie Heller wrote “I’ve become The Wall Street Journal’s business editor and people can feel free to call me with tips. Meanwhile, I’ve been enjoying hosting and attending ’89 mini-reunions.”\n\nSteve Savage wrote, “I had a nice trip recently to N.Y.C., where I hooked up with Mike Herzig, Scot Bateman, Eric Heaton and Bill Smith and then a couple of days later saw Leslie Timothy and Andrew Erlichson, the most ’89s I’ve seen since our reunion. Tammy Morse Savage ’91 and I just sent my daughter, Chelsea, off to Davidson College. We still love it here in Charleston, South Carolina.”\n\nI checked in with as many ’89s as possible with the recent storms in Houston and Florida. In Houston Michael Hafner emailed, “Perfect timing to move home [from London]! Chris Herron is also here in Houston and is fine.” Others safe included Evan Betzer, Rob Jones and Adrian Harris Arnold, who emailed, “watching the water rise was simply heartbreaking…the support and concern that has been pouring in from around the country has been truly uplifting.”\n\nIn Florida Brett Divers wrote, “We had just returned last Thursday night from dropping our kids (’18 and ’21) in Hanover—not exactly how we hoped to start the empty-nest phase of our lives but I guess it is a distraction that doesn’t make us miss them so much.” Others checking in safe included Jeannine Laz-Hall, Matt Garber, Brian Klett, Brendan Lesch, Marc Farraye, Todd Timmerman and Lisa Gamell.\n\nHope you’ll make a resolution to get in touch with more ’89s this year—I know I will be!\n\n–Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWinter time! I was bummed hearing that the College may close the golf course, as I remember sledding down the hills in one of the aluminum DOC canoes. But I’m guessing that sledding on the golf course has been gone for many years. As old traditions fade or change, new ones get made.\n\nBack in early January I was in Hong Kong for work and met up with Greg Dinges on his way back to Japan. Greg is head of international with Cole Haan and just announced a long-term distribution agreement with Sitoy Retailing in China, so he’s moving back to Hong Kong in September. Here’s hoping I’ll see him and other ’89s in Hong Kong in January.\n\nMy travels also took me to Minneapolis in late January and I had dinner with Jody Warden, Bridget Hust and Kathy Heafey ’90. Jody was in ski patrol back when I was a ski instructor at the Dartmouth Skiway; she moved back from D.C. to Minneapolis about a year ago and is still working for Target. Coincidentally, Bridget Hust was on the ski team while at Dartmouth; she now is running her own law firm. I also got to have an early breakfast with Libby Carrier Doran. Libby is principal at LymanDoran, an executive search and consulting firm. Great catching up in Minnesota!\n\nAs part of clearing out my parents’ house of clutter, I sent three Winter Carnival posters (1973, 1985, 1990) to Catherine Baggia Duwan, who will be adding them to the Dartmouth bar in her home, which has a “great collection of Dartmouth glassware and a vintage tin and lightbulb Dartmouth sign, which remains lit during the countless pool games and pong matches on my 8-foot handmade pong table.”\n\nCatherine writes: “This past year my family and I were lucky enough to spend a month in Italy touring around the northern half of the country, staying in various Airbnb apartments for a few days at a time each. The incredible journey culminated in a stay on the north coast of Lago di Garda, where we went sailing in a boat skippered by my teenaged son, Christopher. We made a very special visit to Carisolo, a ski-resort town at the foot of the Dolomite mountains and the hometown of my beloved late grandparents, Caterina and Rocco Baggia, who were born two days apart a few blocks away from each other back in 1897. I took countless photos sporting the Dartmouth swag at every photo-op locale. It was fantastic to spend so much time in off-the-beaten path places where my older son, Connor, and I spoke nothing but Italian since nobody understood English.\n\n“Back in Connecticut I recently enjoyed a visit from my dearest roommate, Dr. Carolyn Gardella, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle who also runs a clinic at the Puget Sound Veterans Affairs division. We got together with my neighbor Mike Conroy, who described ‘getting the posse back together’ as a too-infrequent event, much to the equanimity of local law enforcement. I continue my work as an admissions ambassador and as a board member of the Dartmouth Club of Hartford and recently joined the Bartlett Tower Society. After all that, work as a corporate lawyer is too boring to talk about!”\n\nSo what Dartmouth traditions do you miss or are glad are no longer there? What traditions are you keeping or creating with family and friends? I want to hear your thoughts on this, what you’re up to and I hope if I’m in your town, we can catch up in person!\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nWhere the heck does the time go? By the time you’re reading this, summer will be in full swing. We had a conference call yesterday with our class president Antonia Rutigliano Nedder and the rest of the class officers, and it’s crazy to think we’re two years away from our 30th reunion. Mark your calendars!\n\nConnie Britton finished up on her TV show Nashville, but on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert did not rule out coming back as an evil twin!\n\nThe ’89 L.A. mini-reunion was held Saturday, April 22, at Christie Neuberger Reilly and Rich Reilly’s house in Beverly Hills, California, and ’89s came out in force from all over Los Angeles, including Anton Anderson, Jan Brzeski, Eric Bunting, Andy Camp, Chris DiMauro, Sonya Ooten Frisina and Chris Frisina ’88, Adam Glick, Patrick Munoz and Matt Ridenour as well as Kim Buresh ’90 and Winnie Huang ’92. Great seeing this many ’89s and other alumni in L.A. in one place!\n\nEleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis is running for California lieutenant governor. You may remember that Eleni was appointed by President Obama to be our ambassador to Hungary and was the first Greek American female ambassador in U.S. history–best of luck to Eleni on her campaign! Eleni and her husband, Mark, live with their teenage sons in San Francisco.\n\nKen McDonald just released a book about digital marketing, How to Acquire Your First Million Customers, available on Amazon. Ken lives in Boulder, Colorado, and I caught up with him to ask about the experience. He said, “The book was definitely an adventure. I never thought I would write a book, especially when I was struggling through freshman English. I am still chief growth officer at TeamSnap, a sports app with 15 million users. On the side I coach two basketball teams of 8-year-olds. I also take advantage of the Colorado outdoors by skiing and mountain biking every chance I get. I was on the board of the local Dartmouth alumni club for 15 years, but I recently retired from that so I haven’t been as plugged into the Dartmouth scene lately.” You can see Ken’s book on Amazon here: amazon.com/dp/B06Y3ZLKQ3/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491604756&sr=8-1&keywords=first+million+customers.\n\nIf any of you follow me on Instagram (nedorama, if you’re really bored), you know that my feed consists of family, food, guitars and cars. Lots of cars. I happen to love lots of different cars, and have fixed up my own—a ’67 Pontiac Lemans convertible. Totally impractical in most of the United States, but in L.A. it’s a four-season car. Drove Clay Nichols to the airport and I think he’s now sold on it being better than Uber, although I’m still waiting for my five-star rating. But enough about me. Other ’89s who’ve been bitten by the car bug include Bryan Roberts, who restored a 1966 Ford Mustang with his son, and Jeff Pearce, who is currently in the middle of a nine-year restoration of a 1968 Ford Mustang Sprint 6. Jeff’s first car was a ’68 Mustang. Just to round out the Mustang talk, I still remember Justine Klineman’s blue 1971 Ford Mustang convertible driving around Hanover. I’m sure there are other ’89s out there who are in love with their cars, old or new—let me know! You never know, I may decide to make a road trip out to your next cars and coffee.\n\nI want to hear what you’re up to, who you’ve connected with from our class and anything and everything you’re passionate about so I can share it with our fellow ’89s. I’m on the road a lot with my job, so don’t be surprised if I show up in your town for a mini-reunion!\n\n–Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nEric Korenman—theformereditor of the Aegis, radiologist, pro photographer—is now the owner of a Synclavier synthesizer? To back up in time, in 1989 this was a million-dollar piece of recording equipment that people such as Sting and Stevie Wonder owned, and now Eric has joined that lofty group! In the last issue I wrote about people seeing things on Facebook or Instagram—Eric saw a picture of my Synclavier manual and other gear from my Music 55 class in spring 1988 with professor Jon Appleton and sent me a pic of the synthesizer he had just bought. I immediately sent him everything I had. Eric is having the Synclavier restored to original condition and I can’t wait to hear it!\n\nI also heard from Gretchen Kindel, who lives in Cincinnati with her husband and stepchildren. “After 15 years in San Diego I moved back to Cincinnati to be close to my parents (while they were still healthy) and two of my siblings. Hard to believe I’ve been here 12 years now. I’m a tax lawyer, or more accurately litigator, with (shh, don’t tell anyone) the IRS. It’s a good lifestyle and interesting cases. My cases involve large corporations so I learn some interesting things. I just settled a case involving a generic drug manufacturer. Last year I had a case with a medical device company.”\n\nLoss can be a good thing—as when after my 50th I realized I needed to lose weight—a little more than the freshman 15…. So I worked with an acupuncturist, stuck to a diet and had a ton of support from my wife. I dropped 60 pounds in three months and I’m keeping it off. And what was with me every day throughout this journey? My Dartmouth reunion lunch bag, of course, for every meal at work—once again, the power of our reunion swag! But loss can also be difficult and challenging, and sometimes we don’t know where to turn for support. My family and I realized that my father was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s in early May. It has been especially tough on my mother, but also on me, as I don’t get out to New Jersey enough to see them daily and help out. Now I’m working from New Jersey a week per month, but was losing sleep over wondering what else I should be doing.\n\nWhich is when I reached out to our very own 89 Cares group—all volunteers from our class who can offer help on numerous subjects. In no time I had a flurry of emails and then calls from ’89s to talk about things to be thinking of, as well as to commiserate with them for going through the same challenge. I know that this will be a difficult challenge, but knowing that 89 Cares is there for all of us is a wonderful gain, and I know I will be writing down all that I’ve learned so that I can help others in our class who may have to deal with similar issues.\n\nHow to get in touch with them? Go to our class page (1989.dartmouth.org) and click on the “89 Cares” link on the far right. The number of topics covered by classmates is invaluable, and there are too many ’89s to thank, but thank you sincerely to everyone I talked with who offered advice, shared their stories and gave me tools to help get through this challenge. You’re not alone—contact them today.\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI love when one contact turns into multiple touchpoints; in this case, one email to me about a classmate’s promotion turned into a “so who are you keeping in touch with?” question that showed how strong these Dartmouth bonds are 31 years after we arrived in Hanover freshman year.\n\nI recently caught up with Michelle Dauchy, who was also a classmate of my wife at Kellogg business school. Michelle is now the chief marketing officer for Mercury Marine, after having spent almost 20 years at S.C. Johnson. (She keeps in touch with Allison Polley Hirsch,who is still in Boston with her family, including children Matthew and Sarah.) “I joined a startup organization that helps students who were in foster care graduate from college, a strategic planning committee for local community organization and various stints with Community Consulting Teams (M.B.A.s doing pro-bono consulting work for nonprofits). I’m heading up to Dartmouth later this week for the Tuck advisory board, which I have also been part of for the last few years. Love to see anyone if they are in Boston for work or college visits!”\n\nMichelle and Allison also keep up with Ariel Tabor MacTavish, who has been in medical device marketing for almost 20 years—15 years for Johnson & Johnson (in Florida and then New Jersey) and then for the last four years in Colorado with Medtronic. “My daughter is 14, just started high school and requires much ‘ferrying’—gymnastics is her thing. It was fun to move to Colorado after being so long in one place—I feel like we used to move a lot and then we didn’t. We are outside of Boulder, which is truly God’s country. I was lucky enough to have Michelle and Renee Snow visit a couple years ago, and then in the last couple of years I have seen Renee when I have been out to visit my daughter at her summer camp in New Hampshire. Bryan Cooper is also out here—we actually live about four miles apart so we see him every few months. I also see Sue Shons Luria, Meredith McCredie Winter and Lindsay Brace Martinez at least once a year—our kids have grown up together like cousins.”\n\nI also heard from Renee Snow, M.D., who wrote: “I am just amazed at how much time has passed since we were up at Dartmouth. It still feels so tangible and memorable. I have been a part of a number of organizations and universities during the past 25 years, and the connection and persistent sense of belonging to Dartmouth and our class is incredibly meaningful—even if I don’t manage an update very often! I am based in Andover, Massachusetts, just north of Boston, with my husband and daughter. It has been wonderful to connect with Ariel and her family and I am hopeful we can see her family as well as Michelle’s this year. I also see fellow ’89 Shannon Roy Hartnett on occasion with her three grown daughters and husband here in Andover from time to time.”\n\nHimraj Dang wrote in, saying, “I am still working here out of Delhi, which is a miracle, as I believe younger people are more industrious and even smarter. My elder daughter applies to colleges this year, and that has been somewhat stressful for us both. I do not meet ’89s or Dartmouth alums here where I live, but do exchange emails regularly with Jennifer Avellino, Rob Eleveld (freshman roommate), Geeta Anand and Brooks Entwistle as well as Paul Wlodkowski ’88, Jeff Crandall ’88 and Mike Colby ’84.”\n\n–Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nOur annual Class Officers Weekend was just a few weeks ago in September (yes, I know it’s January when you’re reading this, please time travel with me) and saw a slew of ’89s, including Tom Beecher, Lenora Brown, Nancy Bernard Felix, Nicole Waldbaum Moser, Antonia Rutigliano Nedder, Andy Thompson and our special guest, Dan Parish. I also got to see Ray Prado and his wife, Gesine, both of whom I hadn’t seen since San Diego ComicCon several years back. Ray makes a mean cappuccino when he’s not storyboarding our favorite new Netflix show, Stranger Things.\n\nGot an email out of the blue from Eric Berlin, asking me if I wanted to have dinner. I jumped in the car and picked him up, since Eric and his wife, Laura Hartwell Berlin, live in the Chicago suburbs, but he was presenting in L.A. at a conference. Eric has spent most of his career at Jones Day, litigating bet-the-company cases, particularly on antitrust or heathcare issues. Classmate Ted Chung is in the office right next to Eric and is the practice leader for the investigations and white-collar defense practice; Sharyl Hirsh Reisman is in the New York office and is the firm-wide chair of recruiting.\n\nEric’s legal career has taken an interesting turn. As an extension of his advocacy and fundraising for digestive diseases (he’s the president of the University of Chicago’s gastrointestinal research foundation), Eric spent several years advocating, pro bono, for patients’ safe, legal access to medical cannabis. He worked with members of state general assemblies and other stakeholders to help create the Illinois medical program and more recently to revise and help get passed the Ohio bill. With these experiences and as demand for his paid services grew, Eric has become one of the nation’s leading cannabis law lawyers. He now represents multiple clients in or impacted by the cannabis industry, including large companies that sell into the industry, private equity interests devising financial and other solutions for the industry, hospitals and other healthcare organizations and cultivation centers in various states. Amazing stuff, and great to see Eric leading this charge.\n\nI heard from Kari Draper, who lives outside of Philadelphia with her husband, Thomas Manning. They met on the language study abroad to Arles (I wonder if they still call it “LS-Play”?) sophomore spring and have two daughters, 15 and 17 years old. Kari writes, “Thomas is an attorney and does mainly commercial litigation. I am the medical director of a large urban outpatient pediatric clinic (31,000 patients) of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where I have been since completing residency. In addition to seeing patients, I also teach residents and U Penn medical students. I ran into Adam Glick this summer on a college tour in Maine (Bowdoin College). His daughter was on her way to Dartmouth soccer camp and our daughter was on her way to Dartmouth crew camp—small world! It is always great to be back at Dartmouth (although it was not as attractive as usual this summer since both the Green and Baker were under construction).”\n\nI just got back from Hong Kong, and had emailed Cathy Lee to see if I could catch up with her while I was there for a trade show for a week. She emailed back to let me know that she had moved back to Boston, “working in financial planning with a local advisor for the last few years. Raising two teenage boys who have just started driving. Needless to say, sitting in the passenger seat has increased my number of white hairs.”\n\n—Ned Ward, 2104 Graham Ave., #B, Redondo Beach, CA 90278; ned@nedorama.com\n\nI’ve been traveling on a combination of work and retailer visits that also saw us visiting Princeton and Cornell in August at my older daughter’s insistence that she see more than Dartmouth and Smith. Chris Baldwin saw my Facebook post of the Princeton pictures and replied simply, “No.” My Dartmouth hat was the only one I had with me so, yes, I was that dad. I was wearing that hat while watching Abbey D’Agostino ’14 help another runner up during the race, truly exemplifying the Dartmouth and Olympic spirit.\n\nCloser to home, I finally got to have a beer with Clay Nichols in Venice, California. Besides running Dadlabs, Clay is also running marketing for Smartypants Vitamins, a "
