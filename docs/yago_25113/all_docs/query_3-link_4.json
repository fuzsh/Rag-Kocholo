        "text": "At the teary end of George Cukor's A Star is Born (1954), Judy Garland, as Vicki Lester, the star with the self-destructive, alcoholic husband (James Mason), famously announces, \"Hello everybody - this is - Mrs Norman Maine.\" There was a time when Garland could have proudly announced, \"This is Mrs Sidney Luft.\" Sid Luft, who has died aged 89, was Garland's third husband and manager, and the producer of A Star is Born, her remarkable comeback picture.\n\nGarland was married to Luft much longer than to any of her other four husbands, and he was responsible for helping her return to some semblance of stability when both her life (she had made several suicide attempts) and her career (she had been fired by MGM) were at their lowest ebb. He arranged for her triumphant appearances at the London Palladium and New York's Palace Theatre, and helped get her the Oscar-nominated role of Vicki Lester, probably her greatest achievement.\n\nBorn in a rough neighbourhood of New York, Luft moved to Los Angeles in the late 1930s and launched Custom Motors, a custom car company, in Beverly Hills. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940 and later served as a second world war test pilot for Douglas Aircraft, at one stage surviving a near-fatal plane crash that caused severe burns to his legs and hands.\n\nThe pugnacious Luft, who had been an amateur boxer, gained the reputation of being a heavy drinker, big-time gambler and bar-room brawler - he was nicknamed One-Punch Luft by nightclubbers. He worked briefly as a talent agent and produced two B-movies for the Monogram studio: Kilroy Was Here (1947) and the sequel, French Leave (1948), both starring former child stars Jackie Cooper and Jackie Coogan.\n\nBefore he met Garland in 1950, Luft had had some practice at being a film star's husband when he was married for seven years (1943-50) to Lynn Bari, a longtime Fox contractee. Bari, suing him for divorce on cruelty grounds, complained he took too long to buy his evening paper. He left her at six in the evening and came home in the early morning, explaining he had been \"out with the boys\". She also complained that she had advanced him $16,000 in cash and her $13,000 equity in property to invest in a motion picture, but that \"he threatened to sell or mortgage the properties in order to deprive her and their child of a share in the proceeds\".\n\nSo Garland knew the kind of character Luft was when she married him in 1952. He proclaimed at the time: \"I love Judy. I want to protect her from the trauma she once knew. I don't want her to be bewildered or hurt again. I want her to have happiness. Neither I, nor anyone else, can ever force her to do anything she doesn't want to do.\" Thirteen years later, after a marriage characterised by rows, legal battles and numerous separations, Garland told the judge at the divorce proceedings (where she won custody of their children, Lorna and Joey) that \"[Luft] struck me many times\", and \"did a lot of drinking\".\n\nShe went on to marry twice more, before dying in the bathroom of her London apartment in 1969, aged 47, of an overdose of sleeping pills. Luft also married twice more - in 1970, to Patti Hemingway, which lasted less then a year, and then, in 1993, to Camille Keaton, grandniece of Buster Keaton.\n\nIn 1993, reinforcing people's opinion of him as an opportunist, Luft tried to auction the 1939 Oscar that Garland won as best juvenile actress for her performance in The Wizard of Oz and the replacement statuette she received in 1958 after claiming the first one was lost. A federal judge in Los Angeles barred him from selling the trophies, and ordered him to pay $60,000 to the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences. In 1999, his daughter, the singer Lorna Luft, who had grown up in the shadow of her half-sister Liza Minnelli, wrote Me and my Shadows: a Family Memoir, in which she depicted her father in a rather unflattering manner.\n\nLuft was portrayed in a similar way in the 2001 television biopic based on the book. \"There were so many lies in that movie,\" he told an interviewer. \"I never mismanaged Judy's money - Lorna was only 15 when her mother died, so what the hell did she really know about what went on? Whatever bad things happened, you don't fall out of love with somebody like Judy. All I know is that, if anyone tried to save a woman who was breaking apart, I did. I did the best I could do, and it still wasn't enough.\"\n\nCamille survives him, as do his son by Bari, and two children by Garland."
