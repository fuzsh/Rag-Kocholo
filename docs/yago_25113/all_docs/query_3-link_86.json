        "text": "THE ex-husband of Judy Garland has claimed the 16-year-old icon was GROPED by the munchkins on the set of The Wizard Of Oz.\n\nThe shock revelations were found in a recently discovered memoir by Sid Luft, who died in 2005.\n\nHe said: “They thought they could get away with anything because they were so small. They would make Judy’s life miserable on set by putting their hands under her dress. The men were 40 or more years old.”\n\nJudy – who was married to Sid for 13 years from 1952 – became a Hollywood icon after the movie.\n\nBut the child star turned self-destructive diva and eventually succumbed to her life-long addiction to prescription drugs, dying of an overdose aged just 47.\n\nSid, the second of Garland’s five husbands, witnessed both her epic triumphs and chaotic descent from inside the showbiz bubble.\n\nAs Judy’s tour manager and film producer he oversaw a triumphant period in Judy’s career which saw her play a string of comeback concerts in the 1950s and get nominated for an Oscar.\n\nBut throughout their passionate relationship Sid watched helpless as his wife was trapped in a destructive cycle of pill-popping, dangerous dieting and suicide attempts.\n\nThe window into Garland’s chaotic existence has been laid bare by the publication of a memoir Sid began writing after their divorce in 1965.\n\nLuft died in 2005 and the unfinished book was discovered a year ago among among his archives and has now been published entitled, Judy and I: My Life with Judy Garland.\n\nThe couple’s relationship began amid scandal as Judy was still married to first husband Vincente Minnelli, Liza’s father, and Sid was in the process of divorcing his wife actress Lynn Bari.\n\nThey met at a Manhattan club and Sid was instantly smitten sensing an \"electrical force\" coming from Garland who was “glowing like a ripened cherry\".\n\nSid recalled: “It was virtually impossible to be cool around Judy since I lusted so entirely after her.”\n\nOf the first night they spent together he said: “I was to discover just how different Judy was from other women. She was uninhibited, giving herself over to her passions so completely.”\n\nBut during the heady days of their early romance the producer confesses how he couldn't bring himself to ask about the \"thin scars\" he spotted on the insides of Judy’s wrists.\n\nIt was only over time that he saw first-hand the actress’s heavy use of amphetamines and barbiturates which left her in black depressions, with suicidal thoughts.\n\nHe wrote: “She was married to the drugs before she met me, and she never really got divorced.”\n\nHe tells how Judy, born Frances Ethel Gumm, began to open up to him about the dark chapter in Hollywood history where executives at MGM studios fed uppers to top child stars like Judy, Mickey Rooney and Elizabeth Taylor so they could work long hours.\n\nBut after a while Judy began to get a buzz from the drugs , as Sid wrote: “Judy admitted she felt she grew inches when she took Benzedrine.”\n\nSid met Judy in 1950 when her career had hit rock bottom. At 27 she was out of work and had been dropped by MGM after two suicide attempts and a stint in hospital for drug abuse.\n\nSid helped reverse the actress’s flagging fortunes by organising acclaimed concerts at the London Palladium and on Broadway in New York.\n\nBut the success didn’t come without an emotional price. In the run-up to her Broadway show Judy revealed she was pregnant with Sid’s baby and he panicked about what it would mean for the production.\n\nHe admitted: “Because of my negative reaction, Judy didn’t confide in me where and when she was going to have the abortion. I wasn’t attentive. I didn’t send flowers.”\n\nAnd while Judy's career was resuscitated, Luft quickly began to realise her drug demons were far from banished.\n\nAn insomniac, Garland would roam their house at night or lock herself away before knocking herself out with sleeping tablets.\n\nSid wrote: “There was torment in her face. She picked herself up by getting speed from someone. Her eyes were red-rimmed and she became more and more remote.”\n\nEven on the nights they slept in the same bed he said it was obvious his wife was \"on something\".\n\nBut her drug use accelerated after the birth of their first child, Lorna Luft in 1952 when Judy found herself in the grip of postnatal depression.\n\nIt was during this period that Sid rushed home after receiving a call saying Judy had been found unresponsive in the bathroom.\n\n“I could feel my heart in my temples. Judy was wedged in between the bath and the door. I finally got it open and picked her up. Blood, bright red in sharp contrast to the whiteness of her skin, was pouring out of her neck. Judy had cut her throat with a razor blade.”\n\nDoctors were called to the house to perform a blood transfusion in her bedroom. The next morning Sid found his wife in cheerful form sitting up in bed and wolfing down a huge breakfast of eggs, pancakes, sausage and toast with extra marmalade.\n\nHe recalled: “She quickly ordered a three-string pearl choker from Saks and she never took it off. She wore it to bed.”\n\nSeveral years later, the couple were in Washington DC for a series of concerts Luft had arranged for Judy which she was reluctant to perform.\n\nOn the fifth morning Garland made yet another suicide attempt.\n\n“When Judy came out in her short white lace negligee, her arms were in front of her and she said, ‘Look, darling, what I’ve done!’ Her wrists had been slashed and she was bleeding profusely.”\n\nAgain Garland was patched up by a doctor and ordered a selection of pearl bracelets as a disguise for her arms.\n\nAlthough Sid claimed his wife would never admit she was a substance abuser, she had confessed it was virtually impossible for her to work in front of the cameras without some kind of medication.\n\nWhen she starred in 1954’s A Star Is Born which Sid developed and produced for her he put Judy’s doctor on the payroll for \"maintenance medication\".\n\nBut in the book he reflected: “In hindsight, I was enabling a lesser version of what MGM had blatantly and inhumanly jammed down her throat.”\n\nJudy’s drug use was also linked to her lifelong struggles with her weight which Sid believed stemmed from her days as a child star when she was constantly bullied to stay slim.\n\nJudy had always loved binging on cheeseburgers, chilli, spaghetti and Chinese food, and at 4 ft 11in she could be underweight and still appear heavy on camera, so she turned to amphetamines to shed pounds.\n\nIn the later years of their marriage Sid described how he became like a \"narco\" trying to police his wife’s pill habit and discover her stashes.\n\nHe eventually discovered numerous members of their household staff – from carpenters to butlers – were providing Judy with pills.\n\nOn one occasion, Judy received a new white towelling bathrobe from upmarket store Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nIt was sent by a friend but Sid discovered it had capsules of barbiturate Tuinal sewn into the lining.\n\nOn one raid of Judy’s room he found pills hidden in cigarette packets, her bath salts container loaded with sedative Seconal and the clothes hamper filled with empty beer and vodka bottles.\n\nWhen Judy came out in her short white lace negligee, her arms were in front of her and she said, ‘Look, darling, what I’ve done!’ Her wrists had been slashed and she was bleeding profusely.\n\nSid Luft\n\nWhen Judy began mixing her drug cocktails with alcohol she became a ‘raging pixie’ according to Sid.\n\nHe recalled that during these binges: “The children stayed in one wing of the house. Judy would pay them visits wearing her lounging outfit or a robe. If she was immobile, the children were told Mother wasn’t available.”\n\nIn later years Judy also turned to drug Ritalin, usually prescribed to children with hyperactivity disorder, to calm her down.\n\nBut a toxic reaction to the pills caused her to balloon with Sid describing his wife as ‘helium-faced.’\n\nBut Judy’s drug dependency didn’t halt her social whirl and the couple socialised with a galaxy of the era’s most famous stars.\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were neighbours, the disgraced Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis Simpson were frequent dining pals and Frank Sinatra was a lifelong friend to Judy.\n\nShe also became close pals with equally fragile actress Marilyn Monroe and the pair would stay up all night talking on the telephone because they both suffered from insomnia.\n\nSid said: “Marilyn would also visit us at the house. It was work bringing her out but of course she may have been on some pill. Marilyn was sweet but very unhappy. She was separated from one of her husbands, whom she complained was a nice person, but sadly didn’t know how to make love to a woman.”\n\nPresident JFK was another friend of Judy’s who would often telephone and ask her to sing ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ down the phone to him.\n\nSid tells how Judy’s Hollywood set became a kind of surrogate family to the star who was a estranged from her own mother Ethel.\n\nAlthough Sid tried to prompt a reconciliation, Judy saw her mother a ‘demon woman,’ a heartless stage mother who was put on MGM’s payroll to spy on her as a child.\n\nHe says: “Judy chose to feel permanently betrayed.”\n\nWhen Ethel died suddenly of a heart attack in a car park in 1953 Sid tells how Judy was worried how it would affect her public image.\n\nHe said: “I had the job of seeding quotes to the press to diffuse the ‘cruel daughter’ image.’\n\nHe planted stories about secret houses Garland had purchased for her mother, trust funds she had set up and a will which left everything to Judy.\n\n‘All lies’ Sid confessed in the book.\n\nSid reveals how late in life Judy also became obsessed with digging into rumours that her father Frank was a homosexual.\n\nThe salacious stories were true and Frank’s transgressions once prompted the Gumms to move from Minnesota to California but the family friend whom Judy quizzed kept her in the dark.\n\n“I didn’t see what sense it would have made to tell her”, he informed Sid.\n\nIn 1959 Sid noticed Judy was becoming increasingly bloating and persuaded her to see a doctor who discovered her liver was four times the normal and that she was close to death.\n\nMiraculously, Judy rallied and was eventually able to continue with her career.\n\nSid found her new managers who clinched Judy a string of concerts and a lucrative television show.\n\nBut it was during this period that their marriage began to fracture and he discovered Judy was having a fling with one of her new handlers, David Begelman.\n\nSid and Judy engaged furious rows and disputes over the custody of their children, with Sid claiming his wife once ‘kidnapped’ Lorna and their son Joey and took them to London.\n\nThey finally divorced in 1965 and Sid writes that the new managers embezzled large sums from Judy and by 1966 she was broke despite earning tens of millions throughout her career.\n\nSid tells how she said; “I have no money. I have no resources. I’m too sick to work. We’re going to be on the street.”\n\nOn June 22 1969 she died of an accidental overdose whilst in London with her fifth husband, American musician Mickey Deans, who she had wed just months earlier.\n\nSid said: ‘They say Judy had thirty or forty Seconal next to her bed. A lot of people took advantage of her. The years of abuse had taken their toll on her tiny frail body.’\n\nMore than 22,000 mourners filed past Judy’s glass-covered coffin.\n\nSumming up his former wife Sid wrote: “Judy Garland was a very rare mix of shattered nerves and insecurities, self-destructiveness and suicidal tendencies but also a true genius. She was to me the greatest talent who ever lived.”"
