        "text": "George was fine. I had known him for a long time. He was very, very professional. He did the scenes, never ruffled or angry. He didn’t exert himself other than in the acting thing, though; he had a girl comb his hair, a valet brushed his suits and put on his coat, and somebody drove his car home for him.\n\nLynn had much to say about Sid Luft and their marriage. In fact, she was never at loss for words when it came to Luft, a former RCAF flying officer and test pilot.\n\n“I thought he was a bit of a hero when I met him,” Bari reminisced. “I never met anybody else after my divorce. And he was so persistent – you know; we were going to get married and all this. I had filed for divorce from Walter Kane in November 1942. But it took a year to go through. So I wasn’t legally divorced from him until November 1943. The next day, like a damn fool, I married ‘dear’ Sid. Oh God.”\n\nActing honors in Henry Hathaway’s China Girl (1943) went to Lynn, portraying a sultry spy named “Captain” Fifi. Bari’s performance in the WWII actioner was a charged one, lending an interesting contrast to the passive turn delivered by the China Girl herself, Gene Tierney.\n\n“Gene was a nice kid,” Lynn related to me. “I liked her very much. But she was sort of ‘out-of-it’ all the time.”\n\nLynn very much liked making Tampico (1944). She had much to say about the film, an intriguing wartime mystery – in which she played a woman of mystery. Edward G. Robinson was her leading man here. “I was kind of in awe of Eddie,” Bari told me, “So he pretended to be frightened of me! He killed himself trying to break me down and make me feel at ease.”\n\nLynn Bari played opposite many illustrious film stars during her long screen career – and Foxy Lady features Lynn’s observations about almost all of these luminaries. The Barbara Stanwyck vehicle, Always Goodbye (1938), was the first ‘A’ film in which Bari was prominently cast. Lynn recounted to me her initial apprehension in working with the great Stanwyck; eighteen and insecure, she felt totally out of Barbara’s league. Bari’s fears were soon allayed when trouble came her way on the set and Stanwyck stood up for her. Lynn never forgot Barbara’s supportiveness, considering her one of the most kind and fair-minded people in Hollywood."
