        "text": "Post by timshelboy on\n\nJust finished reading FOXY LADY, Jeff Gordon's biography of Lynn Bari, who has been described as the definitive classic era contract player , \"Queen of the Bs\",,,, not to mention publicised by 20th Century Fox, where she spent most of her career, as \"The Woo Woo Girl\" and \"The Girl with the Million Dollar Figure\". She was a major pinup of servicemen in WW2\n\nShe broke into movies by lying about her age (13) , appearing as a showgirl in Crawford's DANCING LADY* and appeared in over 80 unbilled bits/chorus parts through 1938. In 1937 she got her first billed role in LANCER SPY and gradually worked her way up to leads in Bs - top billed in 1939's PARDON OUR NERVE. (* released after MEET THE BARON). She was very proactive in promoting herself within the studio - working out that Costume Depts got early scripts and she became friendly with said Depts to view the scripts then approach the director/producer/casting director and ask for a particular bit. When she was a bigger name she \"sponsored\" the film studio's \"cutters\" baseball team on the understanding they would resist efforts to edit her scenes (not always successful). She was generally well liked around the lot, and got along with most colleagues - Susan Hayward an exception (playing the big star) and she says Dan Dailey hated her! Lee Strasberg left her unimpressed too (Strasberg was hired to direct BON VOYAGE in 44 with Jeanne Crain, Joan Blondell & Lynn starring but was out of his depth on a movie set and the plug pulled on the movie after a week.)\n\nFOX began to promote her in the early 40s - her \"other woman\" in Sonja Henie;'s SUN VALLEY SERENADE a key stepping stone... although it did \"type\" her as \"other women\". She sang (subbed by Pat Friday) with Glenn Miller's Orchestra.\n\nThe peak of her career was the early/mid 40s... she got a lead in an an A THE MAGNIFICEENT DOPE with H Fonda and (billed above) Don Ameche... and apeared to great advantage in the film she is best remembered for - ORCHESTRA WIVES - again a band singer for Glenn Miller - and again the scheming hussy.\n\nA \"prestige\" loanout for THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY was a flop. She did get an A lead opposite Fred Macmurray in CAPTAIN EDDIE sadly not a big hit. She incurred the Wrath of Zanuck by turning down a role in WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE and found herself demoted to supporting Jeanne Crain in MARGIE. Her Fox contract was terminated a year or two later.\n\nShe freelanced in more mature \"mother\" roles in occasional 50s films and moved into stage and TV., and kept busy through the end of the 60s. Sadly a drink problem led to her not being able to work after mid 70s.\n\nThree unhappy marriages - second to a pre Judy Sid Luft - acrimonious divorce and custody battles.\n\nShe racked up 168 film/TV credits over 35 years,,,,,a few that stand out\n\nAt 19 she was mature enough to be Stanwyck's rival in ALWAYS GOODBYE - she was terrified but Babs was nice.\n\nHOTEL FOR WOMEN was 20ths riposte to STAGE DOOR\n\nFREE BLONDE AND TWENTY ONE - irrestible title and film is fun - one of several with Mary Beth Hughes\n\nSUN VALLEY SERENADE was a smash hit in 1941\n\nThis one I have never seen but supposed to be one of her best Anyone know of source?\n\nZanuck himself wrote the story for this next one the night of the Pearl Harbour attack and the film was rushed into production to be the first Anti Japanese flagwaver. Huge hit. Lynn hated it.\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT DOPE - her reward for 10 years hard labour! TWO A list leading men (and she got billed above the one with the tache)\n\nPlaying the diva with Glenn Miller in the wonderful ORCHESTRA WIVES\n\nShe stole the notices from Gene Tierney in CHINA GIRL as a foxy double agent leading George Montgomery astray.\n\nA big one but again as the \"heavy\" - but above the title!\n\nwith Francis Lederer and Akim Tamiroff in THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY\n\nMaybe not as pretty as George Montgomery she enjoyed working with EGR on TAMPICO\n\nHer favourite role CAPTAIN EDDIE's wife\n\nMARGIE may have been a \"demotion\" but its a cute movie - with Jeanne Crain\n\nI'm fond of this one - one of her first after leaving Fox\n\nHer best 50s movie was HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY GAL as the mother of a family, who becomes a spendthrift flapper after inheriting money. Piper Laurie, Rock Hudson and Chales Coburn starred.. Sirk directed and James Dean had a one line bit (Bari admits she couldn't recall him)\n\nAnother pet hate was this bizarre effort a \"sequel\" to MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY focusing on Fletcher Christians s widow (lynn) and son (John Smith)that has been described as a \"beach party/womens prison\" hybrid.\n\nWith Arleen Whelan on PITCAIRN island\n\nAny other Lynn fans?"
