        "text": "special.\n\nPART I\n\nManhattan, 1950\n\n1\n\nNEW YORK WAS A SCORCHER. It was September, and the entire Eastern Seaboard was having a heatwave.\n\nI’d returned to the city from Media, Pennsylvania, where I’d met with Sam Riddle, the owner of the great racehorse Man o’ War. I’d been working for a month to put together a film about the near mythical golden-red horse, a post–World War I symbol of greatness like Babe Ruth or Gene Tunney. Man o’ War had won the Lawrence Realization Stakes by as much as one hundred lengths. I’d been driven, in spite of the long odds on independent producers at the time, to make this Technicolor film. With two profit-making grade-B Monogram movies under my belt, I was eager to continue climbing the show-business mountain. I had no fear of heights.\n\nBob Agins, a lawyer I’d come to know during my not-yet-finalized divorce from the actress Lynn Bari, had accompanied me to Media. We needed script approval from Riddle before we could continue with the project. The screenplay had been written by W. R. Burnett, author of such megahits as Asphalt Jungle. We had high hopes.\n\nHowever, Riddle had just nixed the Burnett script. It was the first of many vetoes. It didn’t happen this way! was Riddle’s favorite response.\n\nAs I ducked into the air-conditioned refuge of the 21 Club to meet my golf pals Jock and Neddie McLean for lunch, I was thinking maybe I should have just stayed in Los Angeles. I was early and the bar was half filled. I ordered a double martini with olive and cooled off while reading the Daily News.\n\nTheater legend Billy Rose had devoted his entire column, Pitching Horseshoes, to Judy Garland. The column headline, LOVE LETTER TO A NATIONAL ASSET, was addressed to Judy at the Calvena Lodge in Lake Tahoe, where she was vacationing, and made reference to her recent bout with the jim-jams. Rose extolled Judy’s talent in a folksy story, telling how he’d recently wandered into her latest hit (and final film for MGM), Summer Stock. A hundred minutes later I walked out of the projection room with a slaphappy grin on my face. He finished off the lengthy piece with this advice to Judy:\n\nOne thing more: Next time you’re down in the dumps—if there has to be a next time—it might help you to remember that you’re only feeling the way most of us feel a good part of the time. Unfortunately, we’re in no position to ease your headache. You, on the other hand, through the medium of the neighborhood theatre, can do more than a million boxes of aspirin to ease ours.\n\nYour devoted fan,\n\nBilly Rose\n\nMGM had recently suspended the country’s favorite daughter. I’d been aware of the press reports: Judy’s attempt at suicide was considered unimportant, a bid for attention. I was all too familiar with the stress and strains of performers. I had a built-in reflex not to credit the press with accuracy.\n\nYou couldn’t live in Hollywood, as I did, and not be aware of little Judy Garland. In fact, our lives had crisscrossed a couple times over the years. On both occasions she sang, and I thought how talented she was.\n\nI’d seen Judy out on the town several times, once with Louis B. Mayer at the Trocadero nightclub, another time with her mother and friends at Victor Hugo’s, a popular supper club in the heart of Beverly Hills. But the first time we actually met was the day I visited my lover Eleanor Powell on the set of Broadway Melody of 1938. It turned out to be Judy’s fifteenth birthday. We were introduced. I thought she was full of beans, but she seemed a child.\n\nIn 1940, exactly a year before Pearl Harbor, I married Marylou Simpson, a Los Angeles debutante and an aspiring actress. It was also the year Judy Garland’s engagement to musician/composer David Rose was announced. I’m Always Chasing Rainbows was a hit song, and Judy’s rendition of the Chopin melody lifted by songwriter Harry Carroll seemed to be playing everywhere. Three MGM films starring Judy Garland were box office successes throughout the nation: Andy Hardy Meets Debutante, costarring Mickey Rooney; Strike Up the Band, directed by Busby Berkeley; and Little Nellie Kelly, in which Judy played both the child and the mother (George Murphy’s wife). She was allowed to grow up in this film.\n\nI understood it’s not the content that’s so important for an artist as much as how the artist uses it. That’s the difference between a genius and somebody who has some talent. Judy was a good example of genius. She performed in ordinary story lines, but the one distinguishing element was her tremendous gift: she was a great lyric reader and had the natural ability to coordinate her dance skills with her acting and voice. There was a reason George and Ira Gershwin, as well as Irving Berlin, wrote songs especially for her.\n\nThe second time I met Judy was several years later, when I joined Peter Lawford at the Hillcrest bowling alley, near the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Judy was part of the gang. By then I was married to Lynn Bari and Judy to Vincente Minnelli. She wore bobby socks and saddle shoes, reflecting the juvenile image she projected to the public.\n\nI was not at first attracted to her. Anita Loos said, Gentlemen marry brunettes, which was certainly true in my case. When I fell in love I got married. I thought my wives sophisticated, glamorous types, not wholesome apple-pie girls. So Judy Garland was not an erotic fantasy. How could it occur to me our lives would in any way be connected? And yet some invisible cord was shortening with every contact, no matter how casual or distant the meeting.\n\nThe McLean brothers, whom I was meeting for lunch that day in September 1950, shuttled between Palm Beach, New York, and Hollywood. Eastern Seaboard playboys, they came from a wealthy family that had owned the Washington Post, among other assets. Their mother, Evalyn, was eccentric, famous for owning the Hope Diamond. Neddie and Jock were constantly attempting to interest their pal Henry Ford II in putting up money for one thing or another. The brothers smarted from Henry’s refusals, as though someone had spanked them. Now, at the 21 Club over a London broil, they were attempting to persuade me to invest in a cemetery on Long Island. I told them, holding back the laughter, that maybe it was the way I grew up but the idea depressed me. Neddie and Jock seemed dejected by my negative response, but I suggested they keep me in mind for something else.\n\nI proceeded to tell them about my deal, Man o’ War. I would be meeting with Ted Law, a Texas oilman, in Saratoga the following week to shoot sample footage. Ted, who was my partner in Walfarms, our stable outside of Los Angeles, was also one of the investors in Man o’ War. I’d arranged for jockeys Eddie Arcaro and Sam Renick to ride, and we were going to re-create the 1919 Sanford Stakes, an allegedly fixed race that Man o’ War lost to the racehorse Upset. It was the only race that Man o’ War ever lost. I held Neddie and Jock’s interest through another martini, but I could see the idea of a racetrack movie didn’t thrill them as much as a cemetery. We made a golf date for later on in the month and went our separate ways.\n\nThat Saturday night, I took a date to Billy Reed’s Little Club in the East Fifties and ran smack into screenwriter Freddie Finklehoffe sipping daiquiris with the national asset, Judy Garland. Oh, I thought, she’s left Lake Tahoe. Judy looked very different from the last time we’d met in the Beverly Hills bowling alley. Freddie, who was a pal of mine, would have to say hello and introduce me to Judy. And Freddie could be extremely territorial.\n\nI’d become drinking buddies with him as a result of a bet. We both used to hang out at Ciro’s, an in watering hole on the Sunset Strip, but somehow we’d never talked to one another. Then one day as I was leaving for the Santa Anita track, Freddie asked if I’d place a bet for him. I did, and he won a considerable amount of money. Freddie was very impressed. By 1950 we’d shared a few adventures.\n\nHarvard-educated, small, bookish, Freddie dressed in a sort of sloppy, Ivy League fashion as opposed to my Savile Row style. He covered his prematurely balding pate with a jauntily worn fedora, giving him a devil-may-care appearance. Freddie had worshipped Judy from the early MGM years, when he wrote and collaborated on many of her films, including Strike Up the Band, Babes on Broadway, For Me and My Gal, Girl Crazy, and Meet Me in St. Louis.\n\nEveryone who worked with Judy respected her talent, and most everyone, including Freddie, was a little in love with her. Judy could memorize a script in one read, dance after simply watching the choreography, and perform in front of the camera in one take. In those years her coworkers were in awe. Joe Pasternak, who produced Summer Stock, said, Judy Garland half dead was better than anyone else.\n\nAt the moment Freddie was not happy. In the middle of a divorce from singer Ella Logan, he was actually going with a beautiful blonde, whom he eventually married. But for a long time he’d had a crush on Judy, whom he called chocolate drop. Their relationship was more of a hallucination on Freddie’s part, mesmerized as he was by Judy’s talent. It was one of those mythical romances.\n\nShortly before I left for New York I’d been out drinking with Freddie in Los Angeles. Just as Judy was finished with MGM, her manager, Carlton Alsop, whom Judy called Pa, was also leaving Hollywood, this time for good. His marriage to the actress Sylvia Sidney was ending, and as an ex-CIA man he was returning to Washington. Freddie knew Carlton was eager to sell his black Cadillac, and I wanted to buy it. So we went over to Carlton’s house for a late drink. I paid Carlton cash for his Cadillac, the black teardrop job, and he gave me the keys. There were other people around, enjoying themselves. At one point Carlton left the party room with a young woman. When it came time to go I looked around to say good-bye and wish Carlton luck, but we couldn’t find him. Freddie and I left the house by way of the front door. On our way out I spotted Carlton under the dining room table making love to his date, a young woman who went on to marry a Heinz, of ketchup fame.\n\nAlsop was a rangy man with longish, blond hair, a deep baritone voice, and a twinkle in his eye. He was an articulate person who seemed to be interested in producing films, although I never quite knew what Carlton did other than that he had personally managed Judy Garland in her later career at MGM. When I bought his Cadillac, I was unaware that the previous year he had been by Judy’s side in Boston, during her hospitalization at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital, a wing of the Harvard Medical Center.\n\nWhen I actually fell in love with Judy, I knew nothing of her medical history other than her recent problems at MGM. Apparently Judy had ignored her doctor’s advice and left the hospital too soon. She was feeling so much better and was eager to return to work. She shot Summer Stock, but she hadn’t confronted her substance abuse; right in the middle of work on her next film, Royal Wedding, she broke with MGM forever due to irreconcilable differences. Again, the rigors of staying camera slim became the excuse to return to medication—Judy’s direct path to chaos. Only in rare situations was she ever able to acknowledge the toxic effect of pills on her nervous system.\n\nAt the Little Club in New York City, Freddie reluctantly invited me to sit down. I demurred and thanked him, explaining I was about to leave the club with my date. But I sensed a kind of electrical force coming from the small, voluptuous Garland. She was glowing like a ripened cherry in the smoke-filled martini atmosphere. Judy’s brown-black eyes were made up to appear even larger, and they caught me in a kind of fierce, laughing eye contact. I noticed her hair was cut unconventionally short, like a boy’s, creating a disarming contrast. The plunging neckline on her black cocktail dress revealed alabaster white skin, and she wore ruby red lipstick. I thought her lips were more beautiful than Hedy Lamarr’s.\n\nI remembered the reaction I had when I saw Judy in For Me and My Gal in 1942, costarring with Gene Kelly. She appeared glamorous to me for the first time, only to have MGM return her to the Miss Wholesome America image. Of course, there was a war on, and she was more valuable to the studio as a morale booster than as a sexpot. In Hollywood, sexpots were a dime a dozen.\n\nJudy’s eyes darted all over me, through me. I hovered at the table locked into some sort of unexpected mutual attraction, which left Freddie muttering under his breath. When I returned to my date I felt as though I’d been through something I didn’t quite understand. Judy’s eyes coming on, her sensual lips, the small sleek head, the round, alabaster breasts showing off, all of it a heady potion to swallow.\n\nThe next day Freddie called me at the Hotel Ritz Carlton, where I was staying. Join us tonight? Judy and several friends—all men, as it would turn out—were planning to hear Billy Daniels sing at the Riviera Club in New Jersey. Without hesitation I said, Sure.\n\nFreddie explained Judy was on her own, although she was still married to Vincente Minnelli. She was staying at the Hotel Carlyle along with two attendants and her four-year-old daughter, Liza. I said, \"Isn’t it strange you coauthored Meet Me in St. Louis, which Minnelli directed, now six years later Judy’s left MGM, Vincente’s preparing An American in Paris, and neither of you are involved in the production?\"\n\nAnd Sid, came Freddie’s response, neither of us gives a fuck.\n\nThat night Judy’s limo picked me up in front of the hotel. She looked as glamorous as she had the night before. The two of us carried on a banter that excluded everyone. It drove Freddie crazy. I’d attempt to include others in the conversation, but Judy would find a way to single me out. I could tell it was a game. Again, her eyes were seductively penetrating.\n\nLater, I was to become conscious of her eyes in other ways. When our relationship eventually developed into a commitment, I could detect Judy’s pill intake by their expression, the pupils changing like a cat’s in the noonday sun. They would seem to cast long shadows as easily as the brilliant sparks that were flying over the table at the Riviera club. In the background there were the sound of altercations, disgruntled customers requiring good tables busily stuffing bills in the captain’s pocket, but we only had eyes for each other. We’d already had our photographs taken by news photographers who waited at the door for celebrities.\n\nFreddie was so jealous it was funny. He was warning Judy, Watch out for this guy. He didn’t have to worry. I was not going to run after Judy Garland, the big movie star who was a little cuckoo, a little exotic. But when I sat down next to her I thought, I’m going to help her. I don’t know why I thought that. I saw her profile, and I caught a certain look in those eyes, so beautiful and yet so sad. My head was full of thoughts. It was, in any case, out of my hands. And it definitively was out of Freddie Finklehoffe’s, because Judy had already taken aim.\n\nBack in the hotel, I read the newspapers, smoked, and roamed about in my pajamas. I couldn’t get Judy’s image out of my mind. I kept seeing her small hands, the unpolished nails short and smooth, the better to run her fingers through her hair, which she frequently did. With tiny feet in very high heels, she was barely five feet tall. Her legs were very developed, shapely, and she had a rhythmic kind of walk. Her voice was melodic, with a hypnotic effect, just like when she performed. Not self-conscious either.\n\nAll of this would have been of no consequence had she not focused her attention so exclusively on me, and had I not been so taken in. She had cast a spell, no question. I was certainly not wishing for any kind of involvement. I was not rushing into anything except the door of my hotel room, anxious to leave my $300 custom-made shoes out in the hallway to be shined. I took a deep drag on a Chesterfield, slammed down a shot of Jack Daniels, and went to sleep.\n\nA few days later I picked up my date at a Broadway theater where she’d been performing. We were on our way to a party at Jackie Gleason’s apartment when the Checker cab got caught in a nasty traffic jam. We were stopped near the Capitol Theatre’s big neon lights beaming Summer Stock. It was the sort of movie I rarely watched: Judy allows her sister to use Judy’s barn for a summer theater; Judy not only falls in love with the lead actor (Gene Kelly) but becomes a performer herself. Movie houses were not doing well that summer, but Summer Stock was pulling in the crowds because of Garland. Judy performed a memorable routine wearing a tuxedo jacket, black tights, high heels, and nothing else but a man’s felt hat pulled over her brow. It was styled like an early Eleanor Powell production number.\n\nWhat’s the holdup? I asked the driver.\n\nJudy Garland, he answered. She’s in a car by the Winter Garden at Fifty-First. I just came from there. Fans stopped her.\n\nI had a visceral response. Is she OK?\n\nMy date observed my interest, saying, I didn’t know you were such a Garland fan!\n\nI waited for the answer from the cabbie: Yeah. She loves it. The driver talked like a relative. She’s signing autographs out the car window.\n\nEdward Albee, the American playwright, would later remember:\n\nOnce upon a time. . . . I was sitting in the balcony of what was probably the Capitol Theatre, in New York, watching a Judy Garland movie which my memory tells me was Summer Stock. . . . When Garland finished singing, the audience watching that film was breathless for a moment and then, to a person, burst into sustained applause . . . Nothing has instructed and gratified me more than the time she convinced a bunch of afternoon movie watchers that a strip of celluloid was the real thing.\n\nAfter our previous meeting, Judy had asked me to ring her at the Carlyle. I was attracted, perhaps too much, and so I’d managed to put off the telephone call. When I finally did place the call one night, I didn’t get through. It was very late, and I’d been drinking at the Russian Bear. A scuffle ensued and I found myself in a brawl outside the club. My expensive watch was lost in the melee. Pulling myself together, I rang Judy at the Carlyle again, and this time I got through. She was incredibly supportive of my woes and immediately left her hotel and came to assist me in searching for my watch. We found it—crushed to bits. We laughed and went over to the St. Regis for a nightcap. We made a date, but it got postponed, and we hadn’t talked since.\n\nWhen the cab finally got through the traffic jam and arrived at Jackie Gleason’s, I saw Judy was there. I thought, My date is going to discover I’m a fan. Once again, Judy focused on me and excluded the rest of the world. She was enjoying the game. Judy found a way to keep dancing with me, and we danced well together. (I had been well trained by Eleanor Powell.)\n\nNow we were making another late night rendezvous. MGM had assigned a driver to Judy who, at three in the morning, cheerily took us wherever we wanted to go. Judy was wearing one of her plunging-neckline black cocktail dresses and a black onyx ring with a pearl in the center. I again noticed her hands, which will forever remind me of Willie Shoemaker’s—small and strong. She also wore a gold chain bracelet with a mesh charm containing a lucky penny.\n\nThat’s not the bracelet Gable gave you on your fifteenth birthday?\n\nHow’d you know?\n\nI was on the set the day of your birthday. You were showing it off to everyone, including me.\n\nShowing off anything else?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, I’m sorry, Mr. Luft, I don’t remember you.\n\nJudy looked fresh, as though she was starting out the evening. I know a place you’ll like, she said.\n\nIt was an after-hours club in a Midtown brownstone, a duplex, posh and dark. When we came in, Johnny Mercer was playing the piano. He was another golf buddy of mine from the California Country Club, where I’d been in the habit of going immediately after knocking off work in midafternoon when I was a test pilot for Douglas Aircraft. Judy sat down next to Johnny and began to sing with him.\n\nStanding by the piano was an obnoxious patron. He was drunk and proceeded to insult Judy. I would never instigate anything, but it wasn’t in my nature to ignore a slur, drunk or sober. It was a holdover from my old barroom habit of belting anyone who was unduly offensive. In this case, I could see the owner was aware that the man was bothering other patrons, so I wrestled him to the exit and threw him down the stairs.\n\nWhat did you do? Judy giggled.\n\nI threw him out. She loved it—here was someone willing to protect her on the spot. Punch and Judy!\n\nJudy and I knew many people in common, including Roger Edens. MGM’s musical supervisor was perhaps the single most creative influence in her life, at once both a mentor and a disciple. I told Judy how Roger, who was also a close friend of Eleanor Powell’s, would insist on driving me home from parties if he thought I drank too much. This was before the war, and Desi Arnaz was my neighbor at the time. Desi, a highly charged person, had a lot of charm. His energy overwhelmed me. He laughed a lot with his hands, and I had the impression he never heard anything I said. Desi wasn’t your average bongo player. It seemed he was on a fast escalator moving up, while I was on the one that got stuck. One night Roger was dragging me up the stairs to my apartment and Desi happened to be getting in at the same early hour. He glanced over, and despite my debilitated condition I noticed he was speechless at the sight. He wondered what I was doing with Roger, who was known to be gay.\n\nHe should’ve known the difference, Judy flirted when I told her this story. We had left the after-hours club on foot just before dawn. The car trailed us as we walked along Fifth Avenue, window shopping. The stores were filled with merchandise, the New Look—Dior’s invention—and other goods the likes of which we hadn’t seen for over a decade.\n\nIt was postwar, rebirth. I was thirty-four and Judy was twenty-seven. I’d been married twice. Judy was on her second marriage. She had married Vincente when she was twenty-four and he was forty-two.\n\nAs we strolled the avenue, Judy would take my arm or we’d hold hands. It was warm, affectionate. I sensed that she was emotionally tied up. She’d indicated that she and Vincente were not getting along—he was a company man, he couldn’t protect her. I wasn’t sure what she meant by protect. She never said she didn’t love him, but she was testing the waters.\n\n\"Where do you get your clothes?\" Judy asked.\n\nI explained how Leonora Luft, my mother, had weaned me on hand-tailored suits—handmade everything, in fact—a habit I never kicked.\n\nWe sat for a moment in the square at the Plaza. Judy said she’d never felt more free. We continued to hold hands, and she rested her head on my shoulder. Judy Garland was not usually allowed to go anywhere, because she would be mobbed by fans; it was not possible for her to take a walk, to shop. But the world was empty now except for us, and we seemed to be filling the space pretty good.\n\nI later learned that Judy’s personal makeup assistant Dottie Ponedel wrote about this episode in her unpublished book. Judy ran in [to the Carlyle Hotel]. . . . ‘Dottie, I met a guy, Sid Luft, and I’m in love and I’m going to have him. You see, Dottie, he was a pilot like your husband, and I’m going to see him again tonight.’\n\n2\n\nAFTER DAVID ROSE, Judy had gone through crushes and love affairs and wound up married to Vincente Minnelli, a creative, self-absorbed person who was apparently not able to focus his life around her. In my case, I’d felt I’d fucked up with Marylou, I’d fucked up with Lynn. These were fabulous failures in that they could have been repaired if I’d been so motivated. My gut feeling had been that these relationships were not destined to succeed. Lynn loved me but did not believe in me. I knew she would be difficult if and when I fell in love again. She was a vindictive person. Lynn was separated from her first husband when we met, and she was determined to leave him; she hated him. Whereas, clearly, Judy did not hate Vincente.\n\nJudy introduced me to her favorite bistro, Charles à la Pomme Soufflée. It was our first formal date. I picked her up around eight and was presented to her entourage: Liza, who was an adorable four-year-old with huge, luminous eyes, and Tully, who was married to Jim Tully, the so-called hobo writer. She was a wonderful, warm woman, as devoted to Judy as was Dottie Ponedel, who did her makeup and had replaced Judy’s mother in her affections.\n\nJudy had made a reservation and preordered the menu, which included coq au vin. The management was well prepared. We were seated in a booth and given the royal treatment. It was romantic: candlelight and flowers. After a bottle of Dom Perignon, Judy said softly, I was told about you, Sid.\n\nEncouraging her, I said, Tell me about it.\n\nAgain in her irresistibly melodic voice: You’re a very tough guy. Then she added, But a very well-dressed tough guy.\n\nI could see Judy was serious in her lighthearted way. You mean I’m a guy who flies off the handle as a way of life? Do I have to belt guys to know I exist?\n\nYeah, she said, her eyes telling me lots of other things.\n\nWell, I couldn’t turn the other cheek—I’m not Jesus Christ, I’m another kind of Jew.\n\nYou do have a reputation around town. She sipped her champagne. Freddie warned me to stay away from you.\n\nWe laughed at that. Judy, I said, I’ve been in at least a dozen fights on the Strip, or in nightclubs. It’s not in my nature to let an insult slide by. I explained I was from the rough-and-tumble school. Since childhood I’d always been attracted to what society would label macho interests: Wrong Way Corrigan was my hero. I respected derring-do. I hadn’t been a test pilot for nothing. And I’d had my share of publicity in Hollywood. I was a sitting duck for gossip columnists. I knew it was a hype, and deep down I wasn’t interested in whether the press presented me as Mr. Nice Guy. I wasn’t running for political office.\n\nI think you’re nice, Sid. How about going to El Morocco?\n\nPatrons were squashed against the Morocco’s purple velvet ropes, and the waiters kept bringing out tables, reducing the dance floor to a dime. We danced until it was not wise to hold one another in public. I wasn’t eager to be pegged Judy’s boyfriend, which, of course, is what happened anyhow.\n\nLater, over a coffee at the Brasserie, she explained she’d been working on the film of the Broadway hit Annie Get Your Gun when she was overcome with insecurities, insomnia, and a general state of anxiety that she felt was irreversible. She was taken off the film and admitted to the hospital, and she’d been replaced by an old friend of mine, Betty Hutton.\n\nAfter Judy returned from the Peter Bent Brigham hospital in Boston, feeling wonderful, she was asked to lose weight. That meant not eating. She wasn’t going to take pills anymore, and this was a problem, so in part of Summer Stock she appears round and in another part she looks thin. \"Couldn’t control my appetite to their requirements. Then they took me off Royal Wedding. At which point I made a scene. I knew she was referring to the scratch on the neck reported as a suicide attempt. Of course, it was the wrong thing to do. Such ominous reports: ‘It remains to be seen if she ever faces the camera again.’ She dropped her voice to a sort of bogeyman tone. So I went to Lake Tahoe for a vacation.\"\n\nAnd New York, I added. Very much New York, and very much a vacation. I felt this tremendous wave of caring. I wanted to keep her from harm’s way. I looked at the young woman—a robust, high-spirited, hearty, strong person who was clearly not on any kind of medication. It didn’t occur to me she should curb her appetite in any way. I agreed with Judy that nonstop performing in front of the camera could be a terrible pressure to withstand. I never took pills myself. I enjoyed booze, but it was generally in a social context.\n\nJudy had represented the home front, worked in uplifting films, sung chin-up, hope-filled tunes for a country that was losing its youth to a cruel war. Not to mention the bond tours, propaganda for Roosevelt, entertaining the boys. All this while I’d been testing aircraft for Douglas and flying for the Royal Canadian Air Force, delivering bombers to Europe and Russia. I thought, hell, I survived two marriages. And I was still young. I’d gotten through the insanity of the war. It was a new decade, and I was allowing myself to believe in the possibility of a new life.\n\nJudy asked me so many questions. She was clever in extracting information. There were moments I thought she might open up, tell me what was true. I’d noticed the fine scar lines on the inside of her wrists and I thought, well, she has really harmed herself to some degree. Somehow I wasn’t able to ask her about those tracks. It was simply inappropriate. And if I mentioned her mother, Ethel, she’d switch the subject. It was easy for her to redirect: she merely had to hold me in a long gaze. I knew nothing about the inner machinations of Judy’s life. As we sat together in the middle of the night in a public yet sequestered niche of the Brasserie, I listened to Judy talk, in the most general terms, about events leading up to the present moment.\n\nIt would take some years before she recorded, in her unfinished autobiography, what actually had happened the year before we came together:\n\nMy mother called me at night many times and said, in a very quiet voice, [that she thought] I had a brain tumor and the only chance I had would be to have an operation. I never heard from my sisters. I never heard from anybody, except for Carlton [Alsop] and [his wife,] Sylvia [Sidney]. They were really standing by, since I had been ill; Carlton was there all the time. This was after he had worked at the studio. But he believed in me, and he hated what they were doing to me. I was fired from Barkleys of Broadway. Sylvia took me down into her house on Beverly Drive, because that house on the hill was so lonely, and she moved me into her bed and cooked for me and fed me and, you know, was wonderful to me. Carlton too, but the press kept pounding away at me every day in the newspapers and on the front page.\n\nOne day I thought, between the calls from my mother, no help from my husband, [Vincente Minnelli,] no telephone calls from a soul, I thought, I can’t take it anymore. So I, in a burst of complete irrationality . . . it was morning, right after the morning papers had come in and nobody was there. So, I went in the bathroom and I took a razor . . . I went into bed and laid down, and I got weaker, weaker . . . there was blood all over the place and so the cook happened to come in. . . . I wanted to go to sleep. I just wanted to go to sleep. And so she was horrified, she called the doctor. . . . There were a series of doctors and he came up and . . . the nurse got in touch with Carlton and Vincente and anyway they kept me out of the hospital and there was no publicity about it. . . .\n\nI suffered a terrific feeling of guilt and awful shame after trying that, because actually I didn’t want to die. I had a baby to live for. It was just that the pressure had been too much for a minute. [In hindsight Judy was suffering from postpartum depression along with a dependency on pills.] I’d heard this doctor say that I was suicidal. My mother said there was something wrong with my brain. It was just too much for me.\n\nJimmy Tarantino in the Hollywood Nightlife started calling me a dope addict. It was a little scandal sheet in town, but it was a rotten thing in this town, because people really stayed away from me, as though I were a leper then. Of course, the first thing Carlton said: You’ve got to get out of this house and you’ve got to go right down to Romanoff’s with me for lunch and walk in and just face the whole damn town and let them see you, because you look fine and let them know that you’re not some kind of a nut the way they’ve printed in the papers, and so he started taking me out . . . three or four days later. I was wearing tall collars. We walked into Romanoff’s . . . but nobody would come to our table. When I walked in there’d be a kind of a hush that would fall over the room. The only one who would come to the table who was marvelous was Mike [Romanoff]. And he always came over and never mentioned anything. His expression for me was great dame.\n\nI kept going out and Carlton and Sylvia were tremendous help for me. Eventually Metro called me in and said how do you feel and I said I feel great. I didn’t. I still wasn’t right. I hadn’t had my year or six months off. . . . I weighed about a hundred pounds. They informed me they bought Annie Get Your Gun for me. There was an enormous banter, because MGM paid more money for that than they had ever paid for any property to date. Irving Berlin came out and there was pictures in all the papers and big announcements with Berlin and [Arthur] Freed and myself—I was going to do Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nI started rehearsal and I was still very tired and a very distressed woman. The first thing that happened was I started to lose my hair. My hairline started to recede badly. I went to the rehearsals and the costume fittings and unfortunately they put Buzz Berkeley on the picture. I think he’s a wonderful director. I think he did a fine job with the earlier pictures but psychologically Buzz Berkeley represented all of the years of Benzedrine, to work as hard as we could, and just exhaustion. To tell the truth he was in a very bad mental state himself doing Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nI said, I don’t think we’re a very good combination right now, but they said, Oh, we know what we’re doing, you just do as you’re told. So we started the picture and we did a couple of scenes and I knew I wasn’t good. The prerecordings were pretty good. But I was just in a daze. My head wouldn’t stop aching. . . . They called a new doctor in, Fred Pobirs. He walked in the room and I was sitting there, very charming and really with the birds. Pobirs took one look at me and decided on shock treatment for me.\n\nI went through a series of twelve shock treatments and it brought me out of it just fine, and after that I went with a nurse and my baby [Liza] and secretary to Sun Valley for a week, then I went to Lake Tahoe for a week, then I came home. I had put on maybe five or eight pounds but again I was back on pills for Annie Get Your Gun. . . . At any rate I went through it and we started to shoot and I was very bad. I wasn’t good and I knew it. I was really pitiful, because they had to keep putting black in my hairline because of my hair falling out badly and I had these heavy costumes and trying to play a terribly funny role. I kept plugging away and . . . I’m an Indian girl. Bob Alton was directing and I started being late again. I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I didn’t know, and I was trying to take direction from both Buzz Berkeley and Bob Alton and all of the music and the costumes and the chorus boys and everything were confusing me. I had a migraine headache constantly. So I went back to my dressing room one day for lunch and they had evidently looked at the rushes and I wasn’t good, I was being late, so they sent me another notice dismissing me at noontime. I really blew my top. [MGM publicist] Les Peterson, that rat, came to the door saying here’s a message for you. I opened it and read it. It said don’t bother to report back to work after lunch because you are dismissed from the picture.\n\nThey put Betty Hutton in the picture. By then I decided to go to Boston but I didn’t have the money. After so many years at Metro, perhaps they’ll lend me the money to get well. . . . I went to Louis Mayer’s office and told him that I felt I had to go to Boston, and he agreed. [Mayer’s personal physician] Jessie Marmorston and Carlton accompanied me, and Louie B. said, That’s the least we can do for you is to pay for your hospital bills . . . To clear it he picked up the phone, confident, and talked to Mr. [Nicholas] Schenck [president of Loew’s, parent company of MGM]. He put the phone down. Mr. Schenck suggests you go to a charity hospital, because we’re not in the money lending business. He looked at me, I’ll never forget what he said, he said, You know, if they do this to you, they’ll do it to me too.\n\nLouis got the train tickets for Carlton and myself. . . . He would go with me to Boston so I wouldn’t have to go all by myself. He [Mayer] said send all your bills to me. [MGM paid the hospital expenses: $40,000.]\n\nAll of these tests had to be made and no one called, except Frank Sinatra. He sent flowers every day and so forth. It was very sweet, as he is with all his people. But anyway he was very kind, he sent a record player and records and flowers and bed jackets and perfume and all kinds of stuff.\n\nCarlton was standing by every day and it was summertime in Boston and boy it was hot. And all he had to do was either stay at the hospital during visiting hours or sit in that hotel. We came to the last test and they said we’re going to take an electroencephalogram. I thought oh my God, I’ve passed all the tests, now they’re going to record my brain and they’re going to get down on paper my thoughts. I’m a dead pigeon because they’ll never let me out of here. . . .\n\nI was in Boston four months. In the meantime, one day Frank did bring a lot of people up to see me. I got well enough to have a press reception at the hotel.\n\nI didn’t hear from my mother or my sisters. I heard from Vincente. Carlton and I would go on visits for the weekend, we’d go to different people’s houses. They finally said I could go on a two- or three-week holiday on Cape Cod. My little girl [Liza] was with me.\n\nHugh Martin, who had done the songs for Meet Me in St. Louis, had a show, Best Foot Forward, running in a little theater on Cape Cod. We all went over to the theater, and of course Hugh was playing the piano—they didn’t have an orchestra, it was just a little road company. And the lights went on and there I was. Hugh and the whole cast just about died. We went out into the garden afterwards, where we had hot dogs, and then Hugh asked if I would sing for them. I hadn’t sung in four months. It was the first time in years that I really felt good. I had weight on me, I was sleeping and eating, I felt marvelous. I started to sing and I discovered an entirely new voice: a much more powerful voice. I’ve had that voice ever since.\n\nAll night long we continued to exchange stories about our past (though some were edited). A few of my tales struck Judy as hilarious, and she’d giggle or chortle, which was infectious, and soon we’d both be laughing uncontrollably as though we’d been smoking grass. She told me that in 1940 there’d been a kidnap threat against her. A young man, Robert Wilson (she’d not forgotten the name), had phoned the Los Angeles Police Department and threatened to kidnap her unless a ransom of $50,000 was handed over. Thursday was the maid’s day off, and Wilson and a friend were planning on breaking into her home on Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air. A teenage Judy had commissioned the home in 1938 and lived there for nearly a decade with her mother. Apparently the police captain arrested the boy right where he was calling from. Imagine what kind of condition I’d be in if I’d ever been kidnapped! She was sardonic.\n\nJudy talked about her early years at MGM with Mickey Rooney. She said in her mid-to-late teens she was obsessed by boys. She’d had a romantic nature, and neither her mother nor the moguls could subdue her imagination. She wrote poetry to express her passions. They couldn’t keep her altogether a performing slave. Mickey had taught Judy to play Ping-Pong. And she was a good player, but Mickey was table tennis champ from 1935 to 1940 in California.\n\nJudy and Mickey were shipped out on promotional tours, going from theater to theater. Tumultuous crowds waited for them. There were autographs to be signed, executives to meet, theater owners to be courted, luncheons, and press interviews, and their health was constantly threatened by overwork.\n\nJudy loved Mickey, but they were never boyfriend and girlfriend. Having known Mickey from my early years in Hollywood, I knew he went for the glamour gals, like Ava Gardner, who later became one of his wives. Mickey’s mother would have preferred her son to love and marry someone like Judy. Mickey was multitalented like Judy. And they were very much like brother and sister, equal in every way—except in the salaries they received. Mickey earned three times more per picture than Judy, and eventually he quit MGM to form his own company.\n\nBack in my suite at the Ritz Carlton, in the early morning light, everything I thought about Judy began to take on a definite shape. Her hair was silky, very fine on her forehead. Touching her continued to be altogether a new experience. Her white skin seemed to wrap around her limbs like satin. At the same time, there was nothing unformed about Judy: Her body had musculature. Judy was self-conscious about her shoulders, which she considered too round. Her legs were hard, and long for her size. She was short waisted, had full breasts with strong nipples. Other than her skin and her hair, she was not soft.\n\nIt was her enormous rib cage that gave her the advantage while performing—all the juice came from there. She was never to be winded onstage when at times, by all appearances, she might have been the walking dead. Her voice was bell-like, whether she was acting, reading a script, or just chatting. Her dialogue was thought out and very definite. She was not lazy in her speech. I could never mistake anything she said or did. Judy did not sound like any other woman, nor, as I would find out, did she make love like any other woman.\n\nUnlike my soon-to-be ex-wife, Lynn, who put down my projects, Judy was interested, especially about Man o’ War. She knew nothing about horses, and the idea of owning a stable as a business intrigued her. I told her the common perception that a person must be a millionaire to own horses was false. This was the beginning of her fascination with jockeys, racehorses, and people who are attracted to the world of racing. I’d have preferred to tell Judy of my exploits as a macho bomber pilot. Instead she wanted to hear about horses.\n\nJudy’s entrance to what Walter Winchell called the New York-iest spot, the Stork Club, was equal to a coronation. First an army would lead us to our seats. Owner Sherman Billingsley would send over champagne, along with French perfume that Judy would keep for Tully and Dottie. She had her own preferences, two different musky scents: Balmain’s spicy Vent Vert and Patou’s Joy, heavy with jasmine.\n\nBillingsley was quite a tyrant. He had a famous ongoing feud with Toots Shor, and he had eighty-sixed Jackie Gleason and Humphrey Bogart from the club. The Stork was later to take a dive from which it would never recover when Billingsley refused"
