        "text": "Born on this day in 1919, tall and sultry Lynn Bari is for me one of these performers who should have been a bigger star.\n\nIn films as early as 1933, Lynn spent quite a few years in uncredited parts before getting a contract with Fox where she stayed for 12 years.\n\nShe was adept in drama or comedy, yet Fox never groomed her for top stardom.\n\nI haven’t seen half of her output but always appreciated her talent .\n\nLynn and Lloyd were in four films together. i’ve Seen PIER 13 and SLEEPERS WEST. They made a good team.\n\nWith a young Dana Andrews and Jon Hall as KIT CARSON (1940).\n\nWith George Sanders In THE FALCON TAKES OVER . This film was based on Raymond Chandler’s “Farewell My Lovely”, with the Falcon substituting for Philip Marlowe. It would take RKO another two years to try again with the story and get it right with MURDER MY SWEET with Dick Powell.\n\nThe Falcon Takes Over is an ok entry in the Falcon series, but like early versions of The Maltese Falcon, chose to take a lighter tone with the material.\n\nOne of my favourite Bari films, she has a substantial role in this Raft picture,playing a character whom Raft falls,for even though he’s not sure if she’s a murderer.\n\nLynn’s second husband was Sid Luft who went on to marry Judy Garland.\n\nI’d love to see the 12 episode TV series Lynn starred in ,BOSS LADY (1952), costarring Glenn Langan. No sign of it on You Tube.\n\nThis 500 page biography by Jeff Gordon was published in 2010 and got excellent reviews. The paperback edition came out this year and I have just ordered it. The author had a long correspondence with Lynn in the years prior to her death in 1989 and he was also in contact with friends and relatives, including her son John Luft."
