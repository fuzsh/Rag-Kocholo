        "text": "Early life\n\nLuft was born in New York City, to Jewish immigrants from Russia and Germany. His family moved to Westchester County, where he grew up.\n\nCareer\n\nLuft was once an amateur boxer and bar-room brawler and had the nickname \"One-Punch Luft\". He was a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force and in the early 1940s was a test pilot for Douglas Aircraft Company.\n\nLuft's first Hollywood assignment was as the secretary and manager of dancer Eleanor Powell.\n\nHe is credited with keeping Judy Garland working and with setting up a deal with Warner Bros. to bankroll his wife's comeback film, a 1954 musical remake of A Star Is Born plus future projects. Luft's name is on the film's credits as producer. A Star Is Born was a major critical success. During its first release, the picture proved to be very popular with audiences and grossed an enormous amount of money, but it failed to recoup its production costs. This was considered a major factor in Garland not winning the Academy Award that year for Best Actress. As a result, the studio canceled the Luftâ€“Garland contract, which would have starred Judy in two additional Warner films and given Luft a berth at Warner's as a producer.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe was married five times:\n\nIn December, 1940 to aspiring actress MaryLou Simpson. They divorced in 1942.\n\nOn November 28, 1943 to actress Lynn Bari. They had two children, a daughter who was a stillborn and a son named John Michael Luft (b. 1948). They divorced on December 26, 1950.\n\nOn June 29, 1952 to actress Judy Garland. They had two children, Lorna Luft (born November 21, 1952 in Santa Monica, California) and Joseph Wiley \"Joey\" Luft (born March 29, 1955 in Los Angeles). They separated in 1963 and divorced in 1965. Garland accused him of drunkenness and abuse.\n\nIn 1970 New York, to Patti Hemingway, from whom he was later divorced.\n\nOn March 20, 1993 to Camille Keaton, who is related to Buster Keaton.\n\nDeath\n\nSidney Luft died on September 15, 2005 in Santa Monica, California, apparently of a heart attack, at the age of 89.\n\nFilmography\n\nKilroy Was Here (1947)\n\nFrench Leave (1948)\n\nGeneral Electric Theater (TV) (Episode: Judy Garland Musical Special)\n\nA Star Is Born (1954)\n\nFord Star Jubilee (TV) (Episode: The Judy Garland Special)"
