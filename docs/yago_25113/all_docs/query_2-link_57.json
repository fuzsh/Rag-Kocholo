        "text": "'IF I'm such a legend,\" Judy Garland once complained, \"why am I so lonely?\" Five husbands tried to fill the void, but the only one who lasted more than a few years was a Hollywood tough guy with the nickname \"One-Punch Luft\". At 85, Michael Sidney Luft rarely gives interviews and is usually reluctant to talk about his 14 stormy years with Judy.\n\nBut Sid, as he likes to be called, is in a good mood today. It's a balmy spring afternoon in Los Angeles, he has just poured his second glass of Scotch and is sitting at his kitchen table with his shoes off.\n\nPerhaps realising that his time for speaking out is running short, he seems anxious to talk about his marriage to a brilliant, troubled woman who has been dead for more than 30 years, but whose legend keeps growing.\n\n\"When we got married in the early Fifties, Judy was still very beautiful. She was only five foot tall - just a shrimp of a girl, really - but she had a very sensuous body and, up close, her skin was like porcelain, pure white. I was crazy about her. She had incredibly kissable lips.\"\n\nAnd what did such a famous actress see in One-Punch Luft? A rugged former test pilot with a reputation for hard drinking and bar-room brawling, he lacked the showbusiness polish of Judy's two previous husbands: orchestra leader David Rose, whom she married two years after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, and director Vincente Minnelli, the genius behind Meet Me in St Louis.\n\nAs one dubious wag in the press asked, sarcastically: \"So, Sid Luft is what a girl finds over the rainbow?\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I was no Minnelli, that's for sure,\" Sid says, with a laugh. \"I grew up in a rough New York neighbourhood and didn't put up with s--- from anyone. I'm a survivor, with the scars to show for it, and I think that appealed to Judy. She needed someone to lean on who wouldn't crack.\"\n\nHaving come of age in the sheltered world of the MGM studios, Judy must have found Sid's streetwise toughness thrilling. He was a real-life version of the characters that his friend Humphrey Bogart played.\n\nAnd, even today, he can sound like an ageing, gravelly-voiced wise guy who has escaped from the pages of a Raymond Chandler novel, especially when he talks about his old Hollywood pals in the original Rat Pack: Bogart, Sinatra and agent Swifty Lazar: \"Let's see, I met Bogie at Swifty's when Swifty was living with Frank. I picked Bogie off the ground and carried him around the room in my arms until he promised that he wouldn't give me any trouble and would be my friend. Then I kissed him and set him down.\"\n\nArrested at 11 for carrying a concealed revolver, Luft has a history of putting himself in danger and punching his way out of trouble. He played cards for high stakes, and enjoyed throwing a lot of money around at the race track and in nightclubs.\n\nInevitably, some people didn't appreciate his sense of style and got in his way. Sid didn't like that.\n\n\"I've got four successful noses,\" he says proudly, meaning he broke the noses of at least four men in various altercations. As his nickname suggests, he had a talent for knocking out his adversaries with a single blow. One victim was a doctor who witnessed a car crash involving Sid and made the mistake of blaming him for the accident and reporting him to the police.\n\n\"Punching that doctor ended up costing me $15,000,\" Sid laments. \"But as a lady judge, who was a friend of mine - and a wonderful dame, by the way - later said about the guy, 'Anybody who sticks his nose in Sid's business is going to get hit'.\"\n\nLuft came to Hollywood in the Thirties and married B-film bombshell Lynn Bari, second to Betty Grable as the favourite pin-up of American GIs. During the war, he risked his life flying test planes for Douglas Aircraft and, in 1943, suffered an almost fatal crash that caused severe burns to his legs and hands.\n\nAfter four years of marriage, Bari filed for divorce, claiming that Sid was often an absent husband. \"He'd leave the house in the evening to get a newspaper,\" she told a judge, \"and he'd come back at 6am.\"\n\nWhen he met Judy on the rebound in 1950, she had just been let go by MGM and was, in her own words, \"on the slippery slope to a fadeout\". Suffering from drug addiction and a chronic sense of insecurity, she was in danger of becoming a has-been at 28.\n\n\"I loved her and didn't want to see her kicked around. If MGM couldn't handle her, that was their problem. But she was so incredibly talented that I knew she could land on her feet if she had some help. So what if the movies didn't want her? She could always sing.\"\n\nAnd sing she did, first in sell-out performances at the London Palladium and then at the Palace in New York. Her career revived almost overnight. Sid claims much of the credit for engineering this comeback.\n\n\"I'd been around showbusiness long enough to know that Judy still had a place in it. So I became her agent and gave her the encouragement she needed. I wasn't going to let her fail. As a way to cap her live show each night, I had this idea that she should come down to the edge of the stage and sing 'Over the Rainbow'. It worked like a million bucks.\"\n\nIn fact, Garland's comeback was so successful that she and Sid were soon back in Los Angeles, living in a style appropriate for millionaires. After they were wed, Sid bought a big house next to Bogie's and began enjoying almost endless partying.\n\nJudy seemed to like her new life, and even agreed to sing a duet on American television with Sid's pal Frank. But she was never entirely at ease performing and often suffered anxiety attacks. Sid remembers her standing over a toilet and violently retching before a concert at Carnegie Hall. \"I thought: this girl isn't going to make it. We'll have to cancel the show. But she insisted on performing that night. And it was amazing. A few seconds before the curtain opened, she was really unsteady on her feet, but she pulled herself together and went out and killed them. It was a fantastic performance. I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nFor a few years, Sid's touch as a self-taught agent seemed golden. He produced several television specials starring Judy, Sinatra and Dean Martin. He even managed to get her back into films, featuring her in his own lavish production of A Star Is Born.\n\nBut the studio botched the editing of the film and Sid didn't hide his displeasure. He made enemies and some people began to spread rumours that he was wasting Judy's money at the race track and other places.\n\n\"Oh, sure, I was gambling, but I was a successful gambler. I made money, I didn't lose it. And, anyway, I wasn't gambling with Judy's money. I had my own, and I had a backer in Oklahoma, an oilman named Ted Law.\"\n\nAccording to Sid, when things started going wrong with Judy's career, she stopped listening to him and hired other managers who mishandled her money and lost most of it. One of these managers was the notorious embezzler David Begelman, who later stole millions as a studio chief and eventually blew his brains out. \"I have hundreds of documents showing how Begelman ripped Judy off. I have old cheques that he wrote for bogus expenses.\n\n\"He took thousands from Judy, and I tried to warn her. But she wouldn't listen to me. She thought I was just envious.\n\n\"I hated Begelman. When a friend called me and said that the bastard had shot himself, I said, 'Well, he sure as hell shot the right guy'.\"\n\nDrugs and money problems put an end to Sid's marriage and tore apart Judy's family, which included her daughter by Vincente Minnelli, Liza, and two children by Sid, Lorna and Joseph. Even if she had listened to her husband, she might not have salvaged her career. By the early Sixties, she was sliding further into drug abuse and was slowly killing herself. At one point, she had more than 20 doctors supplying her with drugs to keep her habit going.\n\n\"She was a pill taker and nobody could stop her. She couldn't think straight, and she certainly wouldn't listen to me. I watched my friend Dean Martin squander his talent and drink himself to death. I couldn't stop Dino, and I couldn't stop Judy.\"\n\nIndeed, Garland turned on Sid with a vengeance, putting all his belongings in a warehouse and locking him out of their home. They divorced in 1965 and, on her wild ride to destruction, Judy was married twice more in the next four years, each time vainly hoping that a new man would help save her life.\n\nIn 1969, she lost her battle, dying on the lavatory of an overdose. Ravaged by years of drug abuse, she was a shocking spectacle in her last days and looked much older than her 47 years.\n\nSid's critics say that he was always bad for Judy. It is alleged that the couple's domestic feuds were so violent that the police were sometimes needed to separate the two combatants. More recently, Sid has been accused of trying to sell her Academy Award statue on the internet. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Maybe she was doomed, but I also think her death was a kind of assisted suicide. A lot of people took advantage of her and made a bad situation worse.\"\n\nSid survived Judy's death and stayed in Hollywood, marrying again - twice - and making money in ways he can't always spell out. When I press him for details, he mentions a film tribute to Judy that he's producing, but beyond that, he is rather vague: \"Well, I made money on horses and - oh, yeah - I once helped a guy try to sell Indonesia an air force.\"\n\nA whole air force?\n\n\"We were going to start with 100 planes. He had them sitting somewhere in South America. But it didn't work out.\"\n\nThey don't make them like Sid Luft any more. As I leave our interview, I can't say for sure if he's had five or six glasses of Scotch. But he doesn't seem any the worse for wear, except for the emotional pain it costs him to remember life with Judy.\n\n\"Whatever bad things happened, you don't fall out of love with somebody like her. All I know is that if anyone tried to save a woman who was breaking apart, I did. I know that I did the best I could do, and it still wasn't enough.\""
