        "text": "Lynn Bari, an actress who appeared in nearly 50 movies,\n\nmost of them in the 1930s and '40s, died of a heart attack\n\non Nov. 20 in a Santa Barbara, Calif., hospital. She was\n\n75 and lived in the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta.\n\nBari, 75, often was the second lead, usually the \"other woman,\" in A\n\npictures\n\nand was the lead in B movies.\n\nAs a contract player at 20th Century-Fox for 14 years, she\n\nwas often assigned to play straight woman to Charlie Chan,\n\nMoto and the Cisco Kid, but she received good roles in a\n\nfew better 1940s' films, including \"Sun Valley Serenade,\"\n\n\"Orchestra Wives,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" and \"Margie.\"\n\n\"I made as many as three pictures at a time,\" she remarked\n\nin 1982. \"I'd go from one set to another shooting people\n\nand steling husbands. The pace was so fast I never knew\n\nwhat the plots were.\"\n\nHer greatest disappointment was \"The Bridge of San Luis\n\nRey,\" a 1944 film adaptation of the mystical novel by Thornton\n\nWilder about five 18th-century Peruvians hurled to their\n\ndeaths when an ancient rope bridge collapses.\n\nThe movie gave Miss Bari, playing a poor dancer who rises\n\nto power as a viceroy's consort, her greatest chance by\n\nleading a cast of celebrated performers, including Alla\n\nNazimova, Louis Calhern, Blanche Yurka and Akim Tamiroff,\n\nbut the film was marred by a pompous script and a hurried\n\nproduction schedule.\n\nFrustrated by her film roles, she was one of the\n\nearly Hollywood performers to test the waters of television\n\nin the early 1950s. She starred in two short-run comedy\n\nseries, \"Detective's Wife,\" which was shot live, and \"Boss\n\nLady,\" as well as many leading roles in plays.\n\nIn later years she occasionally performed in tours of \"Barefoot\n\nin the Park,\" \"Follies.\"\n\nBorn Marjorie Schuyler Fisher in Roanoke, Va. Bari She was married\n\nand divorced from Walter Kane, an aide to Howard Hughes; Sid Luft, a\n\nfilm producer and agent, and Dr. Nathan K. Rickles, a psychiatrist.\n\nSurviving is a son, John Luft.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
