Haggerty\n\nPostal Street Address: 12 Fischer Dr Apt 3E\n\nCity, State, Zip: North Kingstown, RI 02852\n\nSent: 6.59 PM - 12/31 2003\n\nHi Guys; How many of you are still around to celebrate New Years 2004. Remember New Years 1945. We (about 150 of us) were in railroad cars in the marshalling yards in Berlin. We were being transported from Dulag Luft to Stalag Luft I and parked in the railroad yard about noon on December 31,1944. We all sweated out a British bombing of Berlin to start the 1945 off right. Thank God they did not bomb that night. Sgt Hellman, how could you ever forget conning the German guards into\n\ngoing into the station and getting beer for the guys who swapped a couple of cigarettes for a bottle. I was the red head that helped collect the booty for the guards and will never forget your telling me after they left that they would probably shoot you if they knew you were Jewish. Anyhow, all ended well, you were in a room with my radio operator and nose gunner in North 3 and you were removed from the room in February because you were Jewish. Mel Ten Haken and Tom Byers were my radio operator and nose gunner. I ended up in North 2. My number was 7050 so any of you guys that have numbers surrounding that had to be on that train. We arrived in Barth on January 3,1945 and naturally were liberated by the Russians. Why do you suppose they kept us. VE day was the 8th of May and we didn't get out until the 13th,14th and 15th of May. The reason was because of Andrei Vlassoc. He was a Russian General who received no food, guns or ammo from Stalin early during the German advance into Russia. Because of this and the fact that his army was surrounded, he surrendered to the Germans. Count Von Staffenburg, the one with one arm who was instrumental in the plot to kill Hitler told Vlassov that the Germans would need strong Russian Leaders to help them run Russia when the war ended so he believing what he was told signed pamphlets that were dropped on the Russian front and many, many Russians surrendered to the Germans. Later in the War his army fought against the Germans near Prague and when the Americans got nearby they turned around and started fighting against the Germans. They then joined up with the Americans. The Russians knew this and they held on to us until Vlassov and his army were turned over to the Russians. A half hour after this happened the B-!7's were allowed to take off and get us.\n\nAs Paul Harvey Would say \"Now you have the rest of the story\" Good luck to all of you and if any of you are not getting your full benefits contact your VA. They are having a drive to notify you of what you have coming to you.\n\nName: Mindy Bent\n\nCity, State, Zip: Colorado Springs, CO, 80925\n\nSent: 1.52 PM - 12/31 2003\n\nI have just recently learned of Bassingbourn and am learning more as we speak! I was stationed at RAF Lakenheath from 1996 to 1998 and this was pretty much under my nose and I didn't even know it. I lived so close and spent many afternoons walking through Cambridge. I would have loved to visit the museum. I am yearning to go back to East Anglia and will make this a definite stop in my travels.

He's 80 years old and still actively involved in church and community in Wilmington, NC. When he visited us here in Tucson about five or six years ago, he saw an exhibit on Stalag Luft 1 at the Pima Air and Space Museum. The exhibit included a POW-printed newspaper from the time of liberation, and a handbook for prisoners with a title like \"Welcome to Stalag 1.\" Dad said he never got such a handbook, and we joked that he should complain to the German government about this.\n\nThe only other thing I know about his POW experience (other than that he was an Army Air Force navigator and that he spent time in a VA hospital afterward) is that (according to my mom) he spoke just enough German that he was once able to keep a another POW from being killed, and that he once heard from another ex-POW (circa 1990) who asked, \"Did you cut my hair?\" He had.\n\nKaren Funk Blocher, Tucson, AZ\n\nName: Paula S.

He only ever referred to it as being in Barth in the former East Germany. He had been the navigator in a Beaufighter and had been shot down during his first sortie. His pilot, a man I only ever heard him refer to as Morris was killed when their plane ditched and my father was taken prisoner. He had nothing but praise for the way in which he was treated by his captors who performed several operations on his arm which had been almost severed during the crash. He was a POW for 9 months until he was repatriated via Sweden before the war ended. I don't really know any more than that, although when he died he left some papers and a photo album from those days which are stored in my loft and which I have not yet looked through properly - I found it too upsetting in the early days after he had died and pressure of work has stopped me since! He's not on the list of prisoners on the web site but if anyone has anything whcih might enlighten me about his time there, I'd be very grateful to hear of it.\n\nWith thanks\n\nGraeme Atkins\n\nName: Nick Carter\n\nHometown: Hengoed, South Wales, UK\n\nSent: 9.19 AM - 12/27 2003\n\nJust visited the site, and have completed a history of 149 (East India) Squadron, No 3 Group Bomber Command, with John Johnston, who lives in Charlotte, USA.

However, I find your comment, \" the real veterans are from WWI and WWII plus the other wars\" highly disturbing. The men, many barely out of high school, that are dieing in both Iraq and Afghanistan as we speak are no less a veteran than the men who served 50 years ago. For that matter anybody who has donned a military uniform even during times of relative peace should and are referred to as \"veterans.\" I'm not sure about the statistics of our neigbors to the north, but here in the blessed U.S.A. fewer than 4% of our population ever wears a uniform in defense of our country. That should be enough to make our family's proud regardless if we are ever unfortunate enough to endear the tortures, embarrasment (many POWs were considered cowardly during WWII for being captured), pain, etc. Personally, I admire the men such as T/SGT Williams who came back and just resumed their lives. No whining, etc. They just picked up the pieces of their lives and left their days in captivity behind. They fought honorably and came back and lived their lives honorably. A good book on POWs of the Axis is \"The Last Escape; THe Untold Story of Allied Prisoners of War in Europe 1944-1945.\" It was written by John Nichol and Tony Rennel.\n\nNobody prays for peace more than the soldier.\n\nKG\n\nName: Austin Wilson\n\nHomepage: http://Yahoo.ca\n\nHometown: Greenwood, Nova Scotia\n\nPostal Street Address: P.O.

They all sacrificed unconditionally, with no thoughts of personal acclaim, so it was especially poignant for me\n\nto find your site recognizing dad and his contribution to such noble endeavor. I have his original \"Murder Inc. an American B-17 Heavy Bomber\" manuscript on the table next to me as I write this.

The 2nd was a B-17 group attached to the 5th Wing of the 15th. Our group was one of three B-17 groups, from the 5th Wing, which took part in the first large scale repatriation of U. S. and allied airmen from Bucharest, Rumania to Bari, Italy on August 31, '44. I was privileged to be lead navigator of the 2nd Bomb on this historic mission. The 28 plane groups flew at one hour intervals from our bases in Italy to Popesti Airdrome, Bucharest, Rumania, at 10,000 foot altitude and with 6 man skeleton crews, and boarded up bomb bays. Each plane carried 20 POWs back to Italy, and I had 6 of the POWs in the nose of my B-17 for the return to Bari. Upon landing at Bari, each POW fell to his knees and kissed the earth. I completed 50 combart missions on Janauary 8,'45 but never had a more thrilling or happy mission than the one returning the Pows to freedom.\n\nName: Jason Porter\n\nHometown: Toronto\n\nPOW Camp: Stalag Luft\n\nName of POW: F/S G.B Porter\n\nPostal Street Address: 22 Wineva Ave\n\nCity, State, Zip: Toronto, Ontario, M4E 2S9\n\nSent: 11.00 AM - 12/9 2003\n\nAny information on G.

I spent my childhood playing on the D-4 caterpiller and that old army truck that my grandmother called \"the little truck.\" My father explained to me that they had also owned a GMC semi tractor with flatbed trailer that my grandfather had built from a ww2 surplus duece and a half (this being the BIG truck)and that my father and grandfather where going to try going into the trucking business (a very slow trucking business lol)Being that my uncle traded our beloved 1937 caterpillar in for a wonderful new ford wheel tractor that does everyhing but give you a shave in the morning the two items left from the farm are the little truck and the 1948 Farmall tractor. Immediately after settling the estate I went to a military vehicle meet and found out all i needed to know about my prized truck, it is a 1943 Dodge Weapons Carrier 6x6 1-1/2 ton. Over the last 10 years i have built a new engine, installed an original transmission still in its unopened 1947 shipping crate and all new electrical wiring and military tires. Since my grand father tore off the silly little bed and dumped it into a field 40 years ago and the 6x6 configuration is not a common find these days i am stretching the center section of a weapons carrier bed from a 4x4 3/4 ton dodge. I hope to have it restored in time for a vet, any vet can enjoy a ride in it. My aunt married a man named Jerry Conrow in 1972 who i never felt i had anything in common to talk about. He passed away while we were settling the estate. After his death and then my sudden interest in ww2 i found out he was a P38 pilot in the South Pacific. My grand father had a brother 24 year his junior(which made him only 6 years older than my father)who came up to my aunts funeral 2 years ago. I had only met him as a small child and at that point he was becomming one of my last family connections to an era that i go back to to live in my Walter Mitty dream. During his brief visit i tried to learn as much of his 80 somthing years of history as i could and still allow him to get a word in edge wise with others at the reception. Here I learned that he had been a B-24 pilot in the South Pacific. One year later he has now passed away. When I'm finished restoring my grandfathers truck i would like to drive it down the back country road from the farm into town (Gilroy CA) like he did 40 years ago. I'm fast running out of time because the beautiful Day Rd. is now being considered to be turned into a four lane espress way to facilitate the further rampant south ward growth of the San Jose silicon valley megalopolis. So i turn to the stories like in this web site to absorb as much as i can about a bye gone era when large shiney Southern Pacific steam locomotives pulled elegant Dailight special passenger trains down the once beautiful Santa Clara valley of fruit orchards. I will try to find out what bomb and fighter groups my two uncles were in so i can try to find more out about them from a web site such as this, thank you for all of your hard research work the stories are amazing to read\n\nName: Laura Mills\n\nSent: 9.23 PM - 11/28 2003\n\nMy family came from Miskolc and Diosgyor, Hungary.

He is still alive.\n\nAs a young girl he took medication for nerves and I never new what for. Only a aunt could tell me what my dad had to go through for our country. I still don't know a whole lot. What I do know is he rode in jeeps with beheaded frenchmen, starved, and almost dead. I know that the german army was transfering them thru the town and he and 5 others POW's excaped thru the crowds and then met up missing 1 POW. They ran to a farm house that was unoccupied and found some bread and a can of beans, one of the POWs ripped open the can of beans and ate the whole can, the others witnessed his stomach expanding and then blowing up. My dad is now 100% disabled he is 84 and still can not talk about his ordeal. I'm hoping that I could the real story of what they went through. He has great benefits through the Veterans Hospital and has devoted so much of his time to the volunteers programs and has helped other vets with there demons. But still he can't talk about his. My dad is a hero and I wanted you to know that.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonni Newburg\n\nP.O.Box 1441\n\nSandpoint, Idaho 83864\n\nName: Joyce Park\n\nHometown: Londonderry, Ohio\n\nPOW Camp: Stalag 7A\n\nName of POW: Oral Wayne Cooper\n\nPostal Street Address: 415 Poes Run Road\n\nCity, State, Zip: Londonderry, Ohio 45647\n\nSent: 6.02 AM - 10/10 2003\n\nMy Dad passed away in December, 1998 of congestive heart failure.
