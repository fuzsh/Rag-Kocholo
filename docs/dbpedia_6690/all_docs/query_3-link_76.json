The use of the Insignia, Logotype and NASA identifiers is protected by law, and imagery is made available for use consistent with Media Usage Guidelines.\n\nNASA Images and Media Usage Guidelines\n\nNASA content – images, audio, video, and media files used in the rendition of 3-dimensional models, such as texture maps and polygon data in any format – generally are not subject to copyright in the United States. You may use this material for educational or informational purposes, including photo collections, textbooks, public exhibits, computer graphical simulations and Internet Web pages. This general permission extends to personal Web pages.\n\nNews outlets, schools, and text-book authors may use NASA content without needing explicit permission, subject to compliance with these guidelines. NASA content used in a factual manner that does not imply endorsement may be used without needing explicit permission. NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the material. NASA occasionally uses copyright-protected material of third parties with permission on its website. Those images will be marked identified as copyright protected with the name of the copyright holder. NASA’s use does not convey any rights to others to use the same material. Those wishing to use copyright protected material of third parties must contact the copyright holder directly.\n\nNON-COMMERCIAL USE\n\nFor educational or informational purposes\n\nNASA content – images, audio, video, related media and files used in the rendition of 3-dimensional models, such as texture maps and polygon data in any format – generally are not subject to copyright in the United States. You may use this material for educational or informational purposes, including photo collections, textbooks, public exhibits, computer graphical simulations and Internet Web pages. This general permission extends to personal Web pages.\n\nNews outlets, schools, and text-book authors\n\nNews outlets, schools, and text-book authors may use NASA content without needing explicit permission, subject to compliance with these guidelines. NASA content used in a factual manner that does not imply endorsement may be used without needing explicit permission. NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the material. NASA occasionally uses copyright-protected material of third parties with permission on its website. Those images will be marked identified as copyright protected with the name of the copyright holder. NASA’s use does not convey any rights to others to use the same material. Those wishing to use copyright protected material of third parties must contact the copyright holder directly.\n\nCOMMERCIAL USE\n\nFor use of NASA images in books, clearances may be necessary for images that include any NASA logos or NASA employees to be used as cover art or in promotional content. Otherwise, NASA imagery can be generally used editorially within published works that are not promotional in nature.\n\nIf the NASA material is to be used for commercial purposes, including advertisements, it must not explicitly or implicitly convey NASA’s endorsement of commercial goods or services.\n\nCommercials and promotional content cannot be filmed on NASA property.\n\nMedia including Identifiable Persons\n\nIf a NASA image, audio, video or media includes an identifiable person, using the media for commercial purposes may infringe that person’s right of privacy or publicity, and permission should be obtained from the person.\n\nAstronauts or employees who are currently employed by NASA cannot have their names, likenesses or other personality traits displayed or position title used on any commercial products, advertisements, promotional material or commercial product packaging.\n\nFor guidance on commercial use on merchandise please refer to NASA’s Merchandise Guidelines.\n\nFor more information on using NASA content for commercial purposes, please read NASA Advertising Guidelines and Merchandise Guidelines. Any questions regarding use of NASA content, or any NASA emblems, should be directed to Bert Ulrich in NASA’s Office of Communications at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\n\nAstronauts or NASA employees who are retired from the agency can grant permission for the use of their names, likenesses or other personality traits in their discretion, but their former affiliation with NASA may not be used to promote any product, service or activity. For deceased astronauts or employees, their estates may retain rights in the deceased person’s name, likeness or other personality traits, so permission may still be needed.\n\nThere are many images (moving and still) which have been made publicly available by NASA featuring astronauts in space suits where the astronauts face may be shielded or not easily recognizable, but where some other aspect of the photo may indicate the astronaut’s identity – like a name tag or simply the historical context of the photo. In such a case, the restrictions set forth above may still be applicable, so permission may still be necessary.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nAs a U.S. government agency, NASA makes its imagery and video publicly available for educational and information purposes, however, since NFTs are, in essence, digital tokens owned by someone as a “one of a kind” digital asset, NASA doesn’t wish for its materials to be used for these purposes. The agency also doesn’t approve any merchandising applications involving NFTs, and it’s unlawful to falsely claim copyright or other rights in NASA materials.\n\nIMAGE ACCESS\n\nNASA has extensive image and video galleries online, including historic images, current missions, astronomy pictures, Earth images and ways to search for NASA images. Generally, each mission and program has a video and image collection on the topic page. For example, Space Station videos can be found at https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/videos/index.html. Content can also be found on our extensive social media channels.\n\nContact\n\nFor questions about specific images, please call 202-358-1900.\n\nFor questions about specific video, please call 202-358-0309.\n\nImage and Media Resources\n\nNASA’s multimedia resources can be found online here.\n\nBelow are a condensed list of image, video, audio, data and 3d asset resources.\n\nNASA Image Libraries:\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\nNASA Image of the Day\n\nCatalog of Earth Imagery\n\nNASA Earth Observatory\n\nScientific Visualization Studio\n\nNASA GIPHY\n\nJPL Photojournal\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope Imagery\n\nNASA VR and 360 Multimedia\n\nHigh Energy Astrophysics Picture of the Week\n\nSolar Dynamics Observatory\n\nMODIS Image of the Day\n\nMars Perseverance Gallery\n\nLandsat Image Gallery\n\nHubble Imagery\n\nHiRISE Imagery\n\nTrek Galleries\n\nFaces of NASA\n\nScientific Visualization Studio\n\nLROC Lunar Imagery\n\nNASA Flickr Accounts\n\nNASA HQ Photo\n\nGlenn Research Center\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nJohnson Space Center\n\nKennedy Space Center\n\nLangley Research Center\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nNASA APPEL Knowledge Services\n\nRobotic Refueling Mission\n\nNASA on The Commons\n\nNASA Space Flight Awareness\n\nChandra X-ray Observatory\n\nNASA_SDO\n\nHubble Space Telescope\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope\n\nProject Morpheus\n\nNASA Streaming video:\n\nNASA+\n\nNASA YouTube Channel\n\nNASA Twitch\n\nNASA DailyMotion\n\nAudio\n\nAudio and Ringtones\n\nNASA Soundcloud\n\nNASA Podcasts\n\nNASA Spotify\n\nData\n\ndata.nasa.gov\n\nPlanetary Data System\n\nNASA’s Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center\n\n3D/Tactile\n\nNASA 3D Resources\n\n3D Printed Universe\n\nBlind/Low-Vision Accessible Materials – Chanda X-ray\n\nTactile Solar System Images\n\nSocial"
