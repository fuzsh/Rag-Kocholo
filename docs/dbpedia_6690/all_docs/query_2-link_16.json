        "text": "Cinematic Time Capsule\n\n1942 Marathon - Film #85\n\n‚ÄùWell, Captain, it looks like the Sybil Gray has joined the Navy‚Äù\n\nSo here‚Äôs a highly fantastical wartime plot that features a merchant marine ship with a group of Navy sailors who somehow manage take on several Nazi‚Äôs and really give ‚Äòem hell. And of course, even at sea, in the middle of a war, they still find time to shoehorn in an incredibly awkward shipboard romance.\n\n‚ÄùTom‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Myra?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, put your arm around me‚Äù ü§Æ\n\nThankfully, there‚Äôs at least a few highlights, including some well shot battles with Oscar Nominated effects.\n\nAND BONUS POINTS for the young Desi Arnaz in an early role as the eager, but language challenged Cuban sailor.\n\n‚ÄùI am very patriotic, but now this is a personal fight.‚Äù\n\nCinematic Time Capsule - 1942 Ranked\n\nI‚Äôve watched a lot of WWII movies made during the war, and rarely do the feature the merchant marines. In The Navy Comes Through, the story revolves around a navy gunnery crew assigned to protect a merchant marine ship. Familiar faces Pat O‚ÄôBrien and George Murphy begin a familiar story, but there are twists and turns I‚Äôve not seen before. I‚Äôm sure a lot of the heroics they performed were pretty far-fetched, but it was entertaining! Also features young Desi Arnaz as a singing Cuban sailor.\n\nHey, look! Pat O'Brien is in the Navy again. Seen him too many times as a commander of some sort, be it in the Navy or various aviation films. And this time he just goes with the script without adding anything extra to it. George Murphy was good as the serious kid, but it wasn't the type of production which let anyone shine too bright while trying to motivate the public for war duty."
