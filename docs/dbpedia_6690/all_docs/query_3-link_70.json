        "text": "Sean Connery (born August 25, 1930, Edinburgh, Scotland—died October 31, 2020, Nassau, Bahamas) was a Scottish-born actor whose popularity in James Bond spy thrillers led to a successful decades-long film career.\n\nConnery grew up in a working-class family. After a three-year stint in the Royal Navy and a series of odd jobs, he began practicing bodybuilding and became a model for student artists and men’s fashion catalogs. He competed in the 1953 Mr. Universe contest, which in turn led to work as an extra in stage productions. In 1954 he landed a small part in a touring production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific and eventually took the leading role. More stage and television work followed, including a much-praised performance as washed-up boxer Mountain Rivera in the BBC television production of Rod Serling’s Requiem for a Heavyweight in 1957. Connery made his film debut in Lilacs in the Spring (1954; U.S. title Let’s Make Up) and received top billing for the first time in the comedy On the Fiddle (1961; also released as Operation Snafu). His other notable films of the period included the Disney fantasy Darby O’Gill and the Little People (1959) and the World War II epic The Longest Day (1962).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nIn 1962 Connery was cast in the role of James Bond, Agent 007 of the British Secret Intelligence Service, in the screen adaptation of Ian Fleming’s spy thriller Dr. No. The immense success of the film and its immediate sequels, From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964), established the James Bond films as a worldwide phenomenon and Connery as an international celebrity. Not wanting to be typecast as the superspy, Connery continued to take other acting roles, notably in Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller Marnie (1964). After completing the next two James Bond films, Thunderball (1965) and You Only Live Twice (1967), Connery renounced the role of Bond. Four years later, however, he was persuaded to return to the role for Diamonds Are Forever (1971), which he declared was his last movie as Bond.\n\nHe spent the 1970s playing mostly in period dramas and science-fiction films, the best among them being The Molly Maguires (1970), Zardoz (1974), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Robin and Marian (1976), and The First Great Train Robbery (1978; also released as The Great Train Robbery). In 1981 he made a memorable appearance as King Agamemnon in Terry Gilliam’s time-travel fantasy Time Bandits, and two years later he delighted Bond fans by returning to the role of 007 in the slyly titled Never Say Never Again (1983).\n\nTwo films in the mid-1980s reestablished him as a major star. He won a British Academy Film Award for his portrayal of a monk turned detective in the film adaptation of Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose (1986) and followed this with a best supporting actor Academy Award for his role as a veteran Chicago cop in pursuit of Al Capone in The Untouchables (1987). In Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Connery played the title figure’s father, and in The Hunt for Red October (1990) he played a defecting Soviet submarine captain. Connery’s memorable films of the 1990s included Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), First Knight (1995), The Rock (1996), Dragonheart (1996), and Entrapment (1999). Connery officially retired from acting following his appearance in the film adaptation (2003) of the comic-book series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, though he went on to perform various voice roles."
