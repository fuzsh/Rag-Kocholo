His history and legacy span the district, from the one-room Antioch School he attended near Anamosa to his studio in Cedar Rapids to his home in Iowa City to a gallery of his work in Tipton. His stylized landscape paintings of the rolling landscape made a significant impact on the area's arts and culture during his lifetime.\n\nGrant Wood District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Grant Wood District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesMarch 6In-Person ContestMarch 14Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 15Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 16\n\nHistoric Highways District | Central College | Pella | Register Here\n\nThe first automobile highways to connect the nation from west to east (Lincoln Highway) and north to south (Jefferson Highway) crossed through this district and intersected at the Reed-Niland corner in Colo. The area was a hub of activity that increased in the late 1920s following a long-fought battle to develop the Great Whiteway (now Highway 6), which ran from Chicago to Davenport, Des Moines, Council Bluffs and Omaha.\n\nHistoric Highways District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Historic Highways District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesMarch 18In-Person ContestMarch 26Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 27Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 28\n\nMississippi River District | St. Ambrose University | Davenport | Register Here\n\nJust as it has carved the physical landscape, the Mississippi River has shaped a remarkable path through the history of human settlement. For the first Native Americans, early European pioneers, and modern-day Iowans, the river has influenced the cross-currents of migration, commerce, industry and recreation. Many of Iowa’s oldest towns hug the river’s west bank and reflect its rich history.\n\nMississippi River District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Mississippi River District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesFebruary 23In-Person ContestMarch 3Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 4Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 5\n\nMontauk District | Northeast Iowa Community College | Calmar | Register Here\n\nThis district is named for Montauk, the majestic home and farm of Iowa’s 12th governor, William Larrabee. Larrabee served as the Governor of Iowa from 1886 until 1890 and then retired to Montauk, his family mansion in Clermont which is now a State Historic Site. The Larrabee family furnished and maintained this two-story 1874 mansion and estate for more than 100 years, adapting with the changing agricultural life. Larrabee and his wife were also committed to ensuring the children in their community received the best education possible and in 1912 built and donated the Ideal School to the town of Clermont.\n\nMontauk District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Montauk District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesMarch 11In-Person ContestMarch 19Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 20Comments Forms ReleasedMarch 21\n\nSergeant Floyd District | Northwestern College | Orange City | Register Here\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through northwestern Iowa in August 1804. Sergeant Charles Floyd Jr. was the only member of Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery Expedition to die on the journey. He died on August 20 just south of present-day Sioux City and was buried on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River. The region has documented the history of the expedition at the Sergeant Floyd River Museum, Sergeant Floyd Monument, Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, M.V. Sergeant Floyd Inspection Boat, Lewis and Clark State Park and Keelboat, and numerous works of art in the area.\n\nSergeant Floyd District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Sergeant Floyd District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesMarch 3In-Person ContestMarch 11Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 12Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 13\n\nSpirit Lake District | Buena Vista University | Storm Lake | Register Here\n\nAlthough most Iowans associate the state’s three Great Lakes – Spirit Lake, plus East and West Okoboji – with sunny summer vacations spent fishing, boating and riding the old wooden roller coaster at Arnolds Park, the area wasn’t always so carefree. Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers erupted into the Spirit Lake Massacre during the winter of 1857 and marred the state’s generally peaceful record of Native and white relations. The site’s Abbie Gardner Sharp Cabin became one of Iowa’s first tourist attractions and still stands as a reminder of the state’s early struggles.\n\nSpirit Lake District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Spirit Lake District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesFebruary 25In-Person ContestMarch 5Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 6Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 7\n\nSullivan Brothers District | University of Northern Iowa | Cedar Falls | Register Here\n\nThis district is named in honor of the five Sullivan brothers, natives of Waterloo who enlisted in the U.S. Navy with the stipulation that they serve together. All were assigned to the U.S.S. Juneau, which was torpedoed during the Battle of Guadalcanal, and all five Sullivan brothers perished. As a direct result, the U.S. War Department adopted the Sole Survivor Policy to protect families from losing multiple members in combat and named a Navy ship for the brothers.\n\nSullivan Brothers District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2024 Sullivan Brothers District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesMarch 16In-Person ContestMarch 24Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 25Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 26\n\nVoltaire Twombly District | Indian Hills Community College | Ottumwa | Register Here\n\nThis district is named for Voltaire Twombly, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic efforts as a flag bearer for the 2nd Iowa Infantry at the Battle of Fort Donnelson (Tennessee) in the Civil War.\n\nVoltaire Twombly District ScheduleDateNHD in Iowa 2025 Voltaire Twombly District Contest Registration GuideAvailable January 6Registration OpensJanuary 6Registration ClosesFebruary 27In-Person ContestMarch 7Contest Winners Posted to Website and Websites UnlockedMarch 8Comment Forms ReleasedMarch 9\n\nWestern Trails District | Iowa Western Community College | Council Bluffs | Register Here\n\nThe region around Council Bluffs was a gateway to adventure and westward migration in the early to mid-1800s. In addition to the explorers Lewis and Clark, who explored Iowa’s western border, pioneers followed the Oregon Trail, hopeful gold miners rushed along the California Trail, and Mormons trekked along the Mormon Trail to seek religious freedom in the Salt Lake Valley. Many of these early travelers began their journey at the Missouri River crossing at Council Bluffs."
