        "text": "TO LAND the role as company commander Midshipman Lt. Cole in the new movie “Annapolis,” Tyrese Gibson did everything possible to get the upper hand — especially when he learned that the studio wasn’t planning to cast a African-American lead.\n\n“My challenge came straight out the door,” Tyrese said, promoting the film in a recent interview at a Los Angeles hotel. “Me and my theatrical team were of the mindset that we only had one shot. So if they were going to open up the door for me I had to come in and make them stop thinking white and go black.”\n\nTyrese even went to the surplus store to get gear to prepare for the audition. Not a man who operates with ego or arrogance, he says he paid his own money for military boots and fatigues. He put black stripes under his eyes and bought the dog tags and whistles to get into character.\n\nHe says, “I was convinced that I had to hammer and beat the part in and make them a believer. And I was able to do that. For all the movie posters that I’ve seen my face on, I look at this one and am really proud.”\n\n“Annapolis,” which also stars James Franco and Jordana Brewster, opens today.\n\nPlaying a tough guy who’s reminiscent of the Lou Gossett Jr. character in “An Officer and a Gentleman” was fun for Tyrese, who particularly enjoyed visiting the real Annapolis and working with consultants from the military academy.\n\nGetting into shape for the role was a slightly bigger challenge. Calling it the hardest training he’s ever done for a movie, he says it not only involved physical and mental training, but also dealing with tension on the set — some of which came from adjusting to co-star Franco, who prefers Method acting.\n\nWhile he realizes that “at the end of the day, whether you are naturally good or you have to go to a certain place to become good, the bottom line is you wind up giving your all and doing the best job possible.” He says he personally likes to crack jokes and have a good time between takes: “I can drop out of character, but James — he’s full on. He’s that character. But I can respect that and can learn from that.”\n\nGrowing up in the mean streets of Watts in Southern California, Tyrese, 27, learned how to adapt to many kinds of situations. Always a realist, he never dreamed of being an actor or musician. He had his sights set on becoming a trash man, of all things.\n\n“TV and movies aren’t reality,” he says. Living in the ‘hood, he says, he thought he’d never meet any Hollywood types. “You’ll never be part of that red carpet, the Golden Globes or the Oscars because it’s not part of your reality. What was my reality was seeing electricians, policemen, firemen, plumbers, trash men and the guys that checked your meters. These were the people that I was exposed to and all that I knew.”\n\nBut his horizons started to expand when he got tired of not having things and not having access to things. He was tired of wanting to help his mother and not being able to. He was tired of being hungry. He says, “I got tired of not having a quarter and getting to school. Where I grew up you had people that didn’t want to go to school. They were into gang banging, slinging drugs and being a Crip or a Blood. That wasn’t my life. I was around it but that’s not what I wanted to do. So that was my turning point.”\n\nSinging a jingle for a Coca-Cola commercial launched his music career. At 19, Tyrese released his debut album. The mainstream exposure combined with his good looks led to a lengthy career modeling for Guess and Tommy Hilfiger. He made the leap from music to film with his debut in John Singleton’s “‘Baby Boy.”\n\nHis role in the movie earned him an Image Award as Outstanding Actor. Since then, he has appeared in “2 Fast 2 Furious,” “Flight of the Phoenix” and last year’s “Four Brothers.”\n\nA new double album, “Alter Ego,” is scheduled for release in spring.\n\nWhile Tyrese has put a lot of effort into his work, at times he’ll stand back and take inventory of where he’s been and where he’s going.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed sometimes by the success,” he says, “But I’m one to fly with the eagles of the world. Eagles don’t fly in packs. They take their own way. Ducks, buzzards and leeches, they all roll together. So I fly with the eagles. … I don’t know how long it’s going to last. But while I’m here, I’m hoping to take full advantage of it because it might end tomorrow.”\n\nLana K. Wilson-Combs is a syndicated music and entertainment writer. Contact her at"
