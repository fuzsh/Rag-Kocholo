Hazard himself was a newspaperman at the time of his appointment to the ship, which became known as The Flying Teakettle. After many unsuccessful trial runs, some of which ended in near-disaster, the ship was de-commissioned in Dec 1944.\n\nThe Twentieth Century-Fox Records of the Legal Department, located at the UCLA Arts--Special Collections Library, reveal that Richard Sale and Mary Loos prepared an adaptation of Hazard's story in early Mar 1950, although their work was not incorporated into the completed screenplay. According to a Mar 1950 HR news item, the picture was originally to star William Lundigan. Although a Dec 1950 HR news item includes John Dugan in the cast, his appearance in the completed film has not been confirmed. Contemporary sources note that portions of the picture were shot on location at Newport News and Norfolk, VA. Although HR production charts credit Robert Fritch as the film's editor, only James B. Clark is listed in the picture's onscreen credits. According to a Jun 1954 memo in the legal records, the film had a net loss of $122,000. The picture marked the screen debuts of actors Lee Marvin (1924--1987), Jack Warden (1920--2006) and Charles Bronson (1920--2003), who was known as Charles Buchinski at the time.\n\nIn Mar 1953, author Arthur Curtis filed a $100,000 lawsuit against the studio, claiming infringement upon the title of his 1944 novel Hey, Mac! You're in the Navy Now. In Jul 1953, a Superior Court jury ruled in favor of Twentieth Century-Fox. Curtis appealed the decision, but the studio again received a favorable judgment in Apr 1956 from the California District Court of Appeals.\n\nLess\n\nDuring World War II, Rear Adm. L. E.

Annoyed by Harkness' failure, Reynolds reminds him and the other officers of their training, and of the importance of proving the efficiency of their ship.

However, the boiler, which converts salt water into distilled water, explodes during the first trial run, stranding the ship, which does not even have enough power to operate the radio. After the humiliation of being towed back to shore by a battleship, Harkness is further irritated by Reynolds, who declares that the crew will receive no shore leave until a successful trial run is completed. With his ship jokingly christened the U.S.S. Teakettle , Harkness grimly sets about his task, although a series of trial runs proves disastrous. The ship's erratic performance makes the crew the butt of many jokes, and after tough sailor Wascylewski gets into a fight, Harkness and his officers realize that they must boost morale. Harkness arranges for the men to have shore leave, but their dispirited attitude prompts him to enter Wascylewski in the base boxing tournament. As the days pass, the crew enthusiastically watches Wascylewski's training, and Harkness arranges to place an $1,800 bet for them. The crew becomes depressed, however, when they realize that the next trial is scheduled for the day of the fight, and that if they again get stranded, Wascylewski will not be able to compete. Unknown to Harkness, the men bring aboard distilled water and the run is successful, although Wascylewski is injured during the trial and cannot fight. Harkness discovers the water bottles and attempts to report the truth to Reynolds, but the commander is too busy congratulating him to listen. Harkness is dismayed to learn from Ellie that Tennant and the rest of the research board will be coming to Norfolk soon to put the Teakettle through its paces. Fearing that the men will be too upset after losing the bet to complete the run, Harkness is astonished when he returns to the ship and learns that the crew has won their wager, for Barbo entered the fight under Wascylewski's name and trounced his opponent. The next day, Tennant and Reynolds are bewildered by the lengths to which the crew must go to make the juryrigged steam engine run. The voyage fails, however, when the ship smashes into an aircraft carrier after the throttles freeze open. Later, Harkness is summoned before a board of inquiry, and he angrily complains that the inexperienced crew members were incapable of operating the intricate machinery, despite their sincere efforts, and that if the Navy wanted the experiment to succeed, it would have staffed the ship with experienced men. Tennant then explains that the Navy does not have time to train all of its reserves during wartime, and needs to ensure that new equipment can be operated by new sailors. Tennant compliments Harkness on his men's efforts and gives him a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy. Soon after, the men cheer as a diesel engine is fitted into the Teakettle , and prepare to join a convoy of ships bound for sea duty.\n\nLess"
