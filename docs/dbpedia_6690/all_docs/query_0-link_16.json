My thanks to directors Norman Jewison and Curtis Harrington, producer Nancy Malone, camera operator Michael Ferris, agent Hillard Elkins, dolly grip Chico Anzures, and actors Theodore Bikel, Alice Ghostley, and Anthony Franciosa. Actor Gloria Manon offered invaluable comments on Blondell at the end of her career, and special mention must be paid to the witty testimony of the Here Come the Brides crowd: actors Robert Brown, Bridget Hanley, and Susan Tolsky, and story consultant William Blinn. Jill Jackson and Rose Lundin, two who knew Blondell but did not work with her, provided additional keen perceptions. Thanks, also, for responses from actors Lauren Bacall, Joan Fontaine, Karl Malden, Elizabeth Taylor, Vera Miles, James Garner, Gigi Perreau, Elliott Reid, Kay Armen, John Saxon, and Jean Simmons, and director Robert Wise. Good advice and support came from entertainment writers, critics, editors, and historians, including Cari Beauchamp, John Kern, Gary Morris, Miles Kreuger, Karen McHale, Thomas Gladysz, André Soares, Leonard Maltin, Rex Reed, Roberto Friedman, Sam Staggs, and Mark Vieira. Ronald L. Bowers and David Martin were gracious in sharing their writings that pertain to Blondell. James Robert Parish has bestowed more wisdom and friendly guidance than I could possibly summarize. Without collectors, I would not have been able to see many of Blondell’s rare movies and television. For loaning hours of video, appreciation goes to Randy Beucus, Eric Chadbourne, Marc Kagan, Martin McQuade, Tom Kleinschmidt, and ix\n\nx ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nSidney Bloomberg. Nick Davis and Eleanor Knowles Dugan came through like champions in the rare film search. Amazing Larry Chadbourne lent dozens of films to me from his vast collection, and what he didn’t have he found elsewhere. Archivist and librarians who unearthed brittle clippings and little known facts, and who have my thanks, include Charles Silver of the Museum of Modern Art, Julie Graham and Lauren Buisson of the Special Arts Collection at UCLA, Mark Quigley of the Research and Study Center at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, Mark Swartz of the Shubert Archive, Caroline Sisneros of the American Film Institute’s Louis B. Mayer Library, Jane Klain and Richard Holbrook of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York, Anne Coco and Barbara Hall of the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Kim Cupit of the Denton County Historical Commission. Researching at the Warner Bros. Archives is always a pleasure thanks to the thoughtful oversight of director Randi Hokett and curator Haden Guest. Ned Comstock found what appeared to be every published reference to Joan Blondell in the entire Cinema-Television Library at USC. Thanks, also, to those who provided well-timed help with referrals and suggestions: Susan White, Yannek Aga Khan, publicist Larry Bloustein, Kim Briggs, Nick Langdon, Marge Meisinger, Henry Traub, Allan Taylor, and the ever-supportive Casey Searcy. I remain beholden to those friends who offer salient quips, subtle perceptions, and good-humored rapport: Mike Blubaugh, David Bowman, Eddie Hosey, Ralph Cole Jr., Stan Godin, Vi Klaseen, Joanna Pace, David Perry, Eric Lynxwiler, and Phil McKinley. Mark Cromwell does more than amuse and enlighten. For him and me, archives offer a peculiar comfort, and the benefits of his research are immeasurable. Abiding thanks to family for varied and valuable contributions, be it editing from sister Anne Peterson, research in New York from niece Elliott Kennedy, or “accidental” editing from cousin Walter Kennedy. My mother did not live to see this book published, but her love is on every page.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS xi\n\nI am humbled and thankful that Joan Blondell’s family has been so generous with time, history, memory, ephemera, and feelings. They, more than any print sources or film footage, help me understand the singular person that was their “Matey.” My sincerest thanks to grandchildren Sandra Powell Espe, Scott Powell, and Stephanie Powell Murphy, niece Kathy Blondell, and former daughter-in-law Ann McDowell Traub. Granddaughter Joan Hayward Krooms recalled loving details, many of which are in the book. Daughter-in-law Ellen Levine was a source of referrals, scrapbooks, mementos, photos, and careful editing. Norman Powell’s taped accounts of his mother’s life were a blessing of clear-eyed and loving recollections. Daughter Ellen Powell’s contributions are inestimable. She read each page with an eagle’s eye for detail and meaning, but more importantly she helped me to see the large themes of her mother’s life. Ellen’s spirit, strength, courage, and talent have been inspiring. Director Seetha Srinivasan, assistant editor Walter Biggins, and the entire staff at the University Press of Mississippi were a true pleasure to work with, as was copy editor Karen Johnson. Thanks as ever to my agent, Stuart Bernstein, who shepherds this writer with uncommon finesse. Finally, to my partner, Jeffrey Reid, who had a gentle and loving hand in the creation of this book. Errors found herein must not be attributed to any of the above-named good people, but to the author alone.\n\nJoan Blondell\n\nIntroduction Without work, what is life? —Joan Blondell\n\nJoan Blondell has always been an enigma. As a beloved actress, she was in front of the cameras for five decades, yet was adamant in her priorities to family and home life. She made good money due to an exhausting schedule, yet was never far ahead of the bill collectors. She was one of the most reliably good actresses Hollywood has ever seen, yet she was rarely showcased and never won a major award. She was a most steadfast friend to many, yet her three marriages ended badly. Blondell’s multiple contractions drew me to her as an irresistible subject of biography. If stereotypes of early and mid-twentieth-century womanhood are dominated by unremunerated domesticity, then that fact was lost on her, who began in show business in 1909 when she was three and didn’t stop until her death in 1979. In writing this book, I wanted to recreate what it means to be always gazed upon, and how public expectation might vie with self-doubt in the life and mind of an actor. Work was always a performance but never the same performance. And what did it mean to be just short of major stardom, yet always in some degree of demand? 3\n\n4 INTRODUCTION\n\nJoan Blondell, it turns out, is the perfect subject for pursuing these questions. As a child of vaudevillians, she was introduced to show business in the womb, and she never knew anything else. In examining her life, one fact stands above all others: She worked hard, really and truly hard, for over seventy years. Looking back more than a century after her birth, the reasons for her astonishing survival are not hard to define. Throughout her career, she was fun-loving, warm, and assertive without ever sacrificing her femininity. If she was typecast, she was a type we welcomed again and again. Perhaps it was her voice that first took you in. “Her voice was low-pitched, nasal, and gave the impression that there was a marble rolling around in her mouth somewhere,” noted film historian James Robert Parish. Even with that distinctively husky tone, her line readings were a wonder of effortless precision. Her diction was flawless, and her rapid-fire delivery could give even Rosalind Russell a run for her money. She came with many natural gifts. The architecture of her mouth, simultaneously sharp and soft, suggested Cupid. She had a radiant smile, straight white teeth, pillowy lips, and easy curls in her gamboge blonde hair. Two beauty marks to the east of her nose attractively punctuated her fair complexion, though they were often covered with pancake. Her figure was voluptuous, at one time measuring 37–211⁄2–36. Her translucent, saucer eyes merit special attention. Whether in black and white or color, they were spellbinding on screen, and apparently more so in person. Granddaughter Joan Hayward Krooms described them as “martini olive green with a coffee bean perimeter. Her pupils were encircled by a flaming light brown that glistened in the light. One eye had what looked like a freckle, which later was found to be caused by her near death from scarlet fever and diphtheria. Once you looked into her eyes, you were drawn to her like a moth to a flame.” Actress Susan Tolsky remembered that they “always sparkled, no matter what time of day or night, no matter how tired she was. It was her soul, that pure, wonderful soul that bubbled up and popped out of her eyes.”\n\nINTRODUCTION 5\n\nDue to family demands, idling was rarely an option, and time and again Blondell found ways to enliven and dignify questionable material. Producers and audiences knew this and responded by keeping her working. The sheer volume of her output is impressive, but there is ample quality, and many of her films survive as classics: The Public Enemy, Gold Diggers of 1933, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Nightmare Alley, Desk Set, The Cincinnati Kid, Opening Night, and Grease. Other titles (Blonde Crazy, Bullets or Ballots, Blondie Johnson, Stand-In, and Three Girls about Town) remain lesser-known worthwhile gems on her resume. Time has confirmed what a fine and underappreciated actress she was. Hers was the three-dimensional face on a two-dimensional screen. She was full of surprises, one moment as tough as Joan Crawford, the next as fragile as Margaret Sullavan, and the next as saucy as Mae West. Her powers of empathy were magnificent, as when she urged her niece to unleash a torrent of cathartic tears in a memorable scene in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. She could even cry on cue, a talent sorely envied by Bette Davis. She excelled in a wide variety of genre pictures, including mysteries, romantic comedy, film noir, musicals, westerns, screwball comedies, family dramas, and satire. Joan’s career took her from Warner Bros. to MGM, Columbia, Fox, RKO, Goldwyn, Paramount, United Artists, and Universal. Her work at each offers a tapestry of studio system politics and creativity at its best and worst, but her Warner Bros. tenure in the 1930s stands out. During the Great Depression, she appeared in no less than fifty-two films over an eight year period while supporting her parents and younger brother and sister. Her naturally lighthearted disposition was most often used for comedic roles, but occasionally she was allowed to show real dramatic power. Along the way there were nine features with Dick Powell, two each with Barbara Stanwyck and Ginger Rogers, three with Humphrey Bogart, and assorted others with Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, John Wayne, William Powell, and Errol Flynn. She made seven movies with James Cagney, more than any other female costar. Warner Bros. paired her with Glenda Farrell, another\n\n6 INTRODUCTION\n\nsnappy wisecracker, eight times. They were ideally matched, and it seemed Warner Bros. could not work her hard enough or fast enough. In the assembly-line sweatshop, she managed to be fresh and wise in every role given to her, no matter that she was suffering nervous exhaustion from playing another secretary, chorus girl, or gun moll for the umpteenth time. As an older character actress, her stock roles were madams, nannies, mystics, and matchmakers. She is best known to baby boomers as Lottie, the wise saloonkeeper in the late 1960s ABC-TV series Here Come the Brides, and as Vi, the harried waitress of the 1978 hit musical Grease, but quantity too often trumped quality in Blondell’s career. The volume of her work presented a challenge for this writer. An accounting of so many movies and TV spots invites literary torpor. For the sake of narrative pacing, some Blondell work assignments that were quick and unremarkable are not mentioned in the text, while a complete list of her film and television credits can be found in the back of the book. Joan was an object of desire for men and a symbol of trusting and loyal friendship for women. Though she had bad luck with romance in her private life, she always presented herself as in control and ready for fun. “Ann Sothern, who played types not unlike Blondell, would hold her nose up in the air when a man whistled after her as she walked by, though you could tell that she really liked it,” remarked film historian John Kobal. “Joan, in a similar situation, would merely have smiled. ‘Isn’t that what men are like? God love ’em.’ ” Her longevity cannot be attributed solely to good looks and a deeply appealing on-camera personality. Blondell was a professional down to her painted toenails. She knew her lines, hit her marks, and didn’t complain. She was one of those rare movie stars who was equally liked by the cast, crew, and director. “She made everybody’s job easy,” said dolly grip Chico Anzures, who was briefly married to Joan’s niece. “People don’t realize the difficulty of remembering lines, staying in character, doing what the director wants, and moving so that you stay lit and in focus. Joan could do it all. She was up there with the best.”\n\nINTRODUCTION 7\n\nJoan took pride in her unassailable reputation, but she did not live for great parts in great movies. She was more focused on home and family. She loved animals and always had at least one pet in the house. She doted on her grandchildren incessantly. To her close friend, the acclaimed screenwriter Frances Marion, Joan was “impulsive, passionate, overgenerous; her life has been a kaleidoscopic shifting of incidents from comedy to drama. Rarely has she been able to stroll through peaceful meadows, though her sole purpose in living is to create an atmosphere of peace for those she loves. We who have known Joan since she was a young girl in her teens, and have seen her through some of the most grueling situations, never doubted that she would survive them and keep her sanity—not with her strength of character and strong fiber. We were always amused when people met her for the first time, saw her round and dimpled face, heard her rippling laughter, and said, ‘What a jolly, carefree life she must have had!’” To another friend, columnist Jill Jackson, Joan was “the most generous person [she] ever knew. Giving, loving, highly dramatic, volatile, mad quickly and glad quickly.” Bridget Hanley, her costar on Here Come the Brides, said, “I don’t know how she had time to be friends to so many people.” Her husbands constitute one of the most intriguing marital trinities in Hollywood history, and she once said that the best of all three would make for perfection. George Barnes was the Academy Award–winning cinematographer of Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca. Second husband Dick Powell was one of the most popular singers and actors of the 1930s and Joan’s frequent costar. After their divorce, he went on to marry June Allyson and enjoy an immensely successful career as president of the groundbreaking Four Star Television production company. Joan’s third husband was master showman Mike Todd. Before his famous marriage to Elizabeth Taylor and early death in a plane crash in 1958, he developed and marketed the ToddAO film process that culminated in his Academy Award–winning smash, Around the World in 80 Days. A loving home life was Joan’s elusive goal, and the failure of her marriages was her greatest sorrow.\n\n8 INTRODUCTION\n\nLooking over Blondell’s life, one is seized by the breadth of her accomplishments and the endurance of her charm. Arthur Bell of the Village Voice noted that her filmography is “an incredible history of the talking film, a sociological documentation of the tastes and trends of America during the mid-20th century. Joan personified the Depression. She was the Kansas City Princess who fought the war in Cry “Havoc” and was there when Gable came back and Garson got ’im. She wisecracked through the Jayne Mansfield ’50s and dealt with Steve McQueen and Tuesday Weld in the ’60s and entered the ’70s with Elvis and James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette. Along the way there was vaudeville and radio and television and stock and Broadway.” Put differently, her film career stretches the approximate time span from The Jazz Singer to Star Wars. Such deep entanglements with American entertainment reached beyond sound stages and into the most personal corners of her life. Her husbands all made indelible contributions to the movies, but almost everyone close to her was in show business. Her brother was a studio electrician; her sister, an actress. Her son became a noted producer-director, while her daughter and niece both became movie and television hairstylists. A grandson is a film editor; another is a musician. Among her in-laws there were two producers and a stunt man. Each may draw strength from the sister, mother, aunt, and grandmother who set the standard for professional integrity. Joan did not see most of her ninety-two movies or countless television appearances. She was working too hard, and moviegoing was not a priority. But work gave her a purpose and control over her life that was forever missing at home. The sacrifices she made to family over three generations were made without self-pity or martyrdom. She worked out of need and desire, while her unending generosity was tempered by a sincere gratitude at being in show business. The costs were enormous, and when the women’s movement hit its stride late in her life, Joan took notice. Her children and grandchildren were living in a different world, and perhaps she had been too pliant, too humble, and had taken too much responsibility for other people’s happiness.\n\nINTRODUCTION 9\n\nJoan never had an easy time of it and certainly made her share of mistakes. Her unfulfilled yearning for a permanent home is perhaps the most poignant consequence of her unstable childhood and failed marriages. But she would not be defeated by hard luck or the dark intentions of others. She fought husbands and ill health, raised two kids and a granddaughter, turned in performances that still offer much pleasure today, and won the affection of fans worldwide. Hers was a life dedicated to giving—time, money, and material gifts, most obviously. But she made an even greater impression in what she gave of her body, mind, heart, and spirit. And she is still giving, her presence brightening miles of film stock and videotape, while her memory brings tears to those who knew and loved her. Hers was a gaudy, spectacular, and troubled life, yet there is much to emulate and admire in how she lived it.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Next Town Can I borrow your toothpaste? I left mine in Cleveland. —Joan Blondell, Goodbye Again\n\nWhen Joan Blondell published Center Door Fancy in 1972, it was labeled a novel, but everyone knew better. She maintained that virtually all events in the book were from her life. No one questioned her; the parallels were too transparent. The names were changed, but it was easy to figure out who was who. She was Nora Marten, vaudeville charmer turned movie star. David Nolan was George Barnes, cinematographer and first husband. Jim Wilson was Dick Powell, her singer-actor-producer husband number two. Jeff Flynn was Mike Todd, her volatile third and last husband, who offered eroticism alongside jealousy, public humiliation, and physical abuse. And Kern Brothers studio was Warner Bros., Joan’s rewarding but oppressive employer for most of the 1930s. The roman à clef included her vaudeville trouping childhood, her days as a fizzy comedienne of the talkies, and her doomed marriages. The stories she heard about her father’s childhood were in there, too. Family oral history noted his French illegitimate birth, early life in an orphanage, and servitude to mean foster parents. He escaped, still a young man, via steamer bound for New York. Another story draws an obscure relationship between 10\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 11\n\nBlondell and Richard the Lionhearted. Inexact U.S. census records have him born of French parents in Indiana in 1866 or 1869. It appears fairly certain that Joan’s father, Ed Blondell, traveled as a circus aerialist in his youth. On the worst day of his life, an accident of timing killed his trapeze partner, who was also his best friend. Out of fear, in tribute, or because of a haunting sense of responsibility, he never returned to the swing. His descendants avow that the story of the high flyer is true, and that is how Ed became a clown. In an era before unions, they painted a funny face on him and sent him out into the spotlight only minutes after his friend’s heart stopped. Ed was in so much pain that the audience laughed at the strange expression on his face. Joan’s mother, Kathryn (“Katie”) Cain, was born of pure Brooklyn Irish stock on 13 April, Easter Sunday, of 1884 (alternate records state 1890). She, too, lacked ongoing parental upbringing, as her seven older brothers took greater care than did her overextended parents. By the time she was a teenager, she had grown into a full-figured beauty with porcelain white skin and silky dark red hair. Ed Blondell had since matured into adulthood, his broad face complemented by straight brown hair and a wide smile. He was making a modest living performing and producing vaudeville when he spotted Katie in the audience of a matinee. He introduced himself after the performance, then proceeded to court her in the Cain’s parlor, always in full view of at least one brother. He was about two decades older than Katie, but there was a mutual attraction. Not surprisingly, he had a challenge in squiring a pretty young woman with so many protective older brothers. Katie was eventually convinced of his sincerity, as was her family. In 1898, thirtysomething Ed married teenager Katie. In 1887, the “Katzenjammer Kids” began as a newspaper comic strip by Rudolph Dirks. It told of two young twin brothers, Hans and Fritz, who were forever bedeviling hapless grown-ups. The kids were enormously popular, and in an early case of multiple media saturation, Ed mounted a stage version of their precocious antics in 1901. It played the Brooklyn\n\n12 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nMusic Hall under the advertised promise of “streams of laughter from start to finish. Comedy bubbling over with yours and other people’s troubles.” The show was a hit, and for the next few years it would sustain Ed and Katie on the vaudeville circuit. From the Katzenjammer Kids emerged a new entertainment that brought Ed even more success. On 30 January 1905, he premiered a vaudeville skit called The Lost Boy at New York’s Murray Hill Theatre. The title character was Reuben Plump, an oversized farm boy played by Ed who forever gets his hand caught in the sugar bowl. Plump was a slow fellow, and when his placid face registered the slow dawning of an idea, it made for excellent comedy. The routine, done in pantomime, was tinged with pathos and featured silly roles such as the ancient maid Gladys Passe, mummy King Ho Ho, and chief warrior Gadzooks. Early performances were met with sustained applause, and Ed Blondell and Company was soon touring on the Orpheum Circuit. Upon returning to New York in the fall, The Lost Boy played a week at the Hammerstein’s Victoria Theatre on Forty-second Street and later at the Alhambra Theatre in Harlem on a bill with Harry Houdini. Rarely did The Lost Boy accompany such a big headliner. More often it shared the spotlight with burlesque minstrels, xylophonists, trained dogs, sword swallowers, gymnasts, contortionists, fire eaters, yodelers, impersonationists, rope wranglers, or other specialty acts. If there was a major star on the bill, it might be cyclonic Eva Tanguay, ethereal Lillian Russell, or satiric Eddie Foy. For Ed and Katie, money was usually tight. Expenses such as costume repairs, transportation, food, and lodging were all the burden of the performers. With income a never-ending concern, the Blondells had mixed reactions to the news in early 1906 that Katie was expecting a child. Ed continued to perform in The Lost Boy, as did Katie until her pregnancy was too obvious to hide. Just as Ed was preparing for a matinee performance, Rose Joan Blondell was born on Monday, 30 August 1906, in New York in a hotel room on Ninety-first Street off Central Park West. Her first cradle was a prop trunk and her first nursery was a backstage dressing\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 13\n\nroom. The Blondell act was doing well when Joan was a newborn, and she spent her infancy touring with her parents through Europe. Her first birthday was spent in Paris. Show business legend has it she made her debut at fourteen months, toddling on stage during her parents’ routine wearing nothing but a strip of flannel cloth around her waist. Childhood was spent one week to the next in different cities. Joan’s second birthday was celebrated in Paris, as was her first, but there were dozens of stops in-between. The young family was surviving on The Lost Boy, with New York most resembling a home base. They played a number of stages there, including the Novelty, Young’s Pier, Colonial, and Keith and Proctor’s Fifth Avenue Theatre. A son was born to the Blondells in Brooklyn in July 1909. He was named Edward Jr. and promptly acquired the nickname “Junie,” which he kept for life. Joan’s third birthday, occurring when Junie was a month old, was spent backstage in Vancouver. She had grown into an adorable light-brownhaired, pigtailed child with a ready smile. She could be shy, but never when it came time to entertain. It was in Australia that she was formally integrated into The Lost Boy. She invigorated the act so much that an Englishman approached Ed to offer his services as international agent. At this time, Ed could afford to be discriminating. “This is a nice little contract,” he said to a Variety reporter. “All they want me to do is to work for $200 less than my regular salary, and pay my fares over and back. Then they agree to give me four weeks, and if the first manager doesn’t like me I can be canceled. All I have to pay the agent is 10 percent. I’ll bet a hundred that there is a clause around here somewhere saying that there is an option on me for a longer time at that same $200 cut if I make good.” There was indeed was such a clause, and Ed told the Englishman what he could do with his contract. The Lost Boy toured Europe nonetheless; Joan turned four on stage in London. Baby Rosebud, as Joan was called, later recounted some of her early adventures. She rode a Russian wolfhound in Paris and a huge turtle in Pago Pago. “In Australia, a man tried to get me behind the bushes with a bar of candy,” she said. “Luckily, I was told to stay away from men with bars of candy.”\n\n14 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nAt forty-four, Ed was at the top of his game. If anything, the act was a bigger success in Europe than in North America. One correspondent noted, “The Americanisms of Edward Blondell in The Lost Boy at the London Hippodrome are quite joyous, and this broadly comical visitor should have a triumphant tour in this country. To him ice is a ‘hunk of water,’ and he recommends a stuttering maid not to hold her words till they bust, but to scatter them around. He objects to a fork on the grounds that it leaks so badly when soup has to be dealt with and a tough steak which evades his knife is described as a nervous piece of meat. When asked if he is hungry this huge ‘boy’ admits that he fancies he could nibble away the edge of a bean, and he informs the stuttering girl that if she drinks like she talks she would be gargling all the time.” The act was not favored everywhere. Ed scored a snide payback to a dead house in Dixon, Illinois: “Kind audience: You will pardon me but I am going to leave you flat,” he announced in front of the curtain. “I came to Dixon to amuse, not to educate you. You will permit me to recommend an undertaker for this town.” The vaudeville life meant money in and money out. During flush seasons, the Blondells wore fine clothes and ate in good restaurants, despite their low status as traveling actors. From the beginning, the parents decided to keep the kids close by, even if servants could be afforded. As a result, Rosebud and Junie’s childhood was spent in an endless succession of theaters, boardinghouses, hotel rooms, and trains. Daily rituals involved sweatstained costumes, collars smeared with pancake, and the uncertain reactions of so many shadowy people behind blinding footlights. When Ed and Katie were on stage, fellow performers took turns at baby-sitting. The family usually went by rail, less often by bus. If an ocean was involved, they would go by steamer or cattle boat. Katie became adept at turning a hotel room into a cozy family retreat for the length of their stay. They would have their separate trunks with pots and pans, a Bunsen burner, table cloth, clothes, and whatever they needed to make a hotel room feel like home. Vaudeville proved to be a fantastic, rigorous training ground for Joan. She learned the secrets of delivery, timing, and body language on the\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 15\n\nroad from her parents and their colleagues. Not that she was always a considered artist. She did impersonations that in retrospect she was certain were terrible. But she was often surrounded by the best. In August 1912, she and her family were en route to Australia with the robust comic Trixie Friganza, pianist-composer Willie Paderewski, George M. Cohan acolyte Fred Niblo (later a film director), Al Jolson, the Dolly Sisters, and the Singer’s Midgets. “Life on the boat was just one mad whirl,” she said. “Costume parties, marvelous entertainment by these world-famous performers. Yes, and there was kid Joan herself right in the midst of the fray, begging to get in the excitement and being petted and amused and entertained by the stars themselves.” Formal education was strictly hit and miss. “I became educated with no schooling,” said Joan. “Once in a while I’d go to a school, but not often. If the authorities were alert in some towns, they’d come backstage and say, ‘Let’s get to school.’ I must have gone to anywhere from forty to fifty schools in my life. For a week.” She was never anywhere long enough to grasp the principles of math, or make friends, or even find her way around the playground. She did, however, learn how to read by virtue of playbills and marquees. In the early twentieth century, schools were incubators for disease. In one of those rare moments that found Joan in a classroom, she contracted scarlet fever and diphtheria. The doctor nailed a quarantine sign on the door, then told Ed and Katie to expect her death within days. During Joan’s illness, Katie walked the streets and met a stranger who “declared the truth,” as the Christian Scientists say. She told Katie to pray for truth and understanding of God’s ways, to be humble in seeking guidance, and the healing would follow. Soon after that encounter, Joan’s fever broke, her painful red rashes cleared, and she recovered. Katie’s Irish Catholicism had offered little solace after the doctor had given up hope, but Christian Science did. She was henceforth a dedicated convert. Convinced that Christian Science brought about Joan’s cure, Katie’s belief in the efficacy of her new religion was absolute and lasted the rest of her life.\n\n16 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nBy 1914, The Lost Boy was still politely attended, though the act was now called “old” in the trade papers. Vaudeville was beginning its long death march as “flickers” routinely accompanied live acts. The advent of the multi-reeled Judith of Bethula and Tillie’s Punctured Romance heralded the coming dominance of feature films. But still Ed Blondell and Company toured. The family was in Australia during the outbreak of World War I. Katie suffered a miscarriage in the middle of the night while on a Midwestern tour, landing her in a hospital for two weeks. The medical emergency did not disrupt the schedule. Joan went on in her mother’s place, cannily playing an adult in skits she knew by heart. Vaudeville did not pay what it used to, and the family started to suffer. Flophouses and greasy spoons became the norm. Everyone, including a reluctant Junie and a recovering Katie, had to be in the show. Rehearsals were ongoing, and the eighteen-minute act was forever being polished to stay competitive and keep the offers coming, however low they paid. The family diet consisted of doughnuts and coffee during the day, meat and vegetables for dinner, and chop suey once a week in a Chinese restaurant. “When vaudeville was going downhill and things were really rough, my mother and father made a miraculous home life for us in cheap hotels and rooming houses,” Joan said. “We learned the importance of our profession, [and] the importance of giving a good performance no matter how exhausted we were. We learned to cook on a Sterno stove and to sew; we learned compassion and we learned how to work.” Katie delivered a girl, Gloria, on 16 August 1915 in New York. By early 1916, the revamped family act was called The Best Boy and featured clever funny woman Gertrude Perry. Joan’s portion of the act involved imitations, a gypsy dance, and a song or two. When she was learning the ropes, her father gave her advice that was as true as it was corny, and she remembered it forever: “Just go out there and love ’em; then they’ve got to love you back.” When the Blondells played the greatest vaudeville house of them all, the Palace in New York, they were tucked away in the second act. When the show was again overhauled in 1917 and renamed The Boy from\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 17\n\nHome, Katie was back on stage. The new routine went over well. “There is a lot of fun and just a soupçon of pathos in this bit of human nature, and Ed knows how to put both of them over,” wrote the Los Angeles Times. Joan was happy to perform, avoid school, and dote on little Gloria. “I always thought of my sister as my own baby,” she said. “I took her out in her little buggy, or walked along the street holding her hand, as she toddled beside me, people would stop and ask me whose baby it was. I always said she was my baby. I believed it.” A highlight of childhood came when father bought a Ford Model T. Everybody owned one, but it was a temperamental product. It would not start in the cold, and it rattled and overheated easily. It needed a running start to get up hills. It did forty-five miles per hour tops, but its greatest drawback was the crank start. If it kicked back, broken arms and wrists were the common result. The new car did not improve Junie’s increasingly sullen disposition. Of all the Blondells, he was the most discontent with nomadic life. When Joan realized how unique her young life was, she began to enjoy school. It became another kind of theater, and her classmates another kind of audience. They were enthralled at her stories of the gypsy life. This led to wild sagas that impressed even her teachers, though they were less gullible in believing them. One whopper involved a vomited lunch of ice cream and pickles. Joan explained that the cuisine was not to blame. She announced to her teacher, “I got a serious disease in the jungle when traveling with my father and every so often I have spells of throwing up.” To satisfy the law, Ed received a special dispensation that allowed his children to attend various schools nationwide for short periods. Time and again, Joan would enter a classroom as a stranger among friends. To win their favor, she performed a few magic tricks she learned from her extended family backstage. After that came the stories of the Orpheum Circuit and life on the road. As soon as she had won their affection, she and her family would disappear to another town, another classroom, and another stage.\n\n18 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nBetween tours, the family stayed on Westminster Road in Flatbush. Much of Katie’s family lived in Brooklyn, and Flatbush was a subway ride away from Manhattan theaters. Joan enrolled in middle school, but was getting too old to rely on charming recitations for passing grades. Katie insisted that she take piano lessons. “With me protesting every foot of the way, she loaded me on a trolley and escorted me to downtown Brooklyn, to the music studio of a man with a name something like Rumpelstilskin,” said Joan. “For one solid hour, sitting at his piano, I suffered acutely. All the way home, I pleaded with my mother not to make me go back there again. She said firmly, ‘You’re going to learn how to play the piano. You’re going to have a lesson every Saturday. The only thing that could prevent you from going back to Mr. Rumpelstilskin would be for him to drop dead.’ The very next day, Mr. Rumpelstilskin did drop dead. And it gave my mother such a turn, after what she had said, she never mentioned piano lessons again.” Lack of stability nagged at Ed. When the Blondells were performing in San Diego, he attempted to settle his brood there and live on speculative real estate investments. He found a three-bedroom cottage in the suburbs on a dead-end street that suited everyone. There was a large, handsome pepper tree in the backyard for climbing. A grassy, undeveloped canyon nearby was ideal for thirteen-year-old Joan and ten-year-old Junie to explore. Joan found a “worry rock,” a flat granite boulder on the edge of the canyon, where she told her secrets. During her time as a Girl Scout in San Diego, she felt an early rush of pride at winning a medal for life saving. San Diego did not last long. The Blondells loaded the Model T and drove up the coast to the oceanside, canaled town of Venice, immediately south of Santa Monica, where they lived for eight months. It was here that Joan conducted herself as a more typical adolescent. She became a champion swimmer, was president of the drama club, and even played baseball on a boys’ team. Ed rented dogs and cats for the intended benefit of his kids. He rented bicycles, too, and after a month or two, everything would be returned. Katie became a reader at the local Christian Science Church.\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 19\n\nShe and Ed devoted time every day to reading a quote by Shakespeare, Plato, or Aristotle to their children, a tradition that continued when Joan had children of her own. In 1919, Joan met Johnny Kenney, president of the eighth grade. Johnny borrowed the family’s car, drove Joan to a private spot three blocks away, and parked. They began kissing. She pushed him away when she worried that she might get pregnant. Her anxieties were relieved when Johnny gave her an introductory course in human reproduction. Joan’s first menstruation took place during baseball practice, and she ran home frightened and confused. Katie merely looked down at her, smiled, and said, “My little woman.” That was hardly comforting to Joan. It would be years before she developed ease and confidence in her sexuality. Large breasts added to her adolescent embarrassment as garbage men and truck drivers blatantly ogled her. Ed opened a neighborhood tea room in Santa Monica called Fine De Lux Food (And Beaucoup of It), but no one stopped in for the first two days of business. Finally an elderly woman came through the front door, and the new Blondell restaurateurs turned solicitous. “We gave her vast tureens of soup, several steaks, gobs of potatoes, and a huge salad bowl,” said Joan. “I think the poor little thing died of overeating.” Fine De Lux Food suffered from the Blondells’ priorities. They hung the “closed” sign if Joan was in a school play or Junie had a football game. The family reluctantly confessed they were ill-suited for a food business, and the stage act was resurrected. The resulting tour to Honolulu, Australia, and New Zealand was a dream. Joan remembered the white sand beaches of Hawaii and running through a rice field wearing only a bra and shredded-wheat skirt. In Australia she had a romance of sorts with the son of a hotel manager. The park-filled Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand was a favorite stopover. “I have seen many lovely places,” she said, “but never one as lovely as that quaint little town.” There were horrors in life on the road. While driving through the South, the Blondells saw something that looked like a meeting in a field\n\n20 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nunder a large tree. As they approached, Katie could see that several black men were being strung up. She instinctively seized young Gloria and clutched her to her bosom saying, “It’s a party. Look somewhere else.” Joan was too far from her mother’s protective embrace to miss seeing the lynchings. Whatever strength Joan gained by an early life in the theater, she never hardened to the violence in human nature. This was a young woman who avoided meat out of compassion for the animals she watched passing by from train windows. She never spoke of the lynchings. Joan yearned to expand beyond vaudeville, and she found her chance back in New York in late 1923. She secured a small role in Gilbert Emery’s Tarnish at the legitimate Belmont Theatre on West Forty-eighth Street. The drama starred silent film actors Tom Powers and Fania Marinoff and was directed by John Cromwell, later a respected film director. It made no great waves, but it did win Joan a scholarship offer from a talent scout at the John Murray Anderson Drama School, the launching pad for Lucille Ball and Bette Davis. “I couldn’t take it,” said Joan. “The family needed whatever I could earn and the scholarship was for tuition only. My ambition at the time was to make a buck so we could get the act together again and go again.” Before going back on the road, Joan was entangled in another production wholly different from vaudeville. She was an extra in director Max Reinhardt’s spectacular Cathedral pantomime of The Miracle staged at the Century Theatre on Central Park West. There was movable scenery, fortytwo windows, 470 costume designs, a choir, orchestra, fifty stage hands, forty electricians, and twenty-two assistant directors rehearsing the giant cast as it clump-clumped wooden shoes to effect the sound of teeming multitudes. The stage apron was thrust into the orchestra for more space, necessitating the removal of several hundred seats. The pageantry suffered from such characters as the Piper and a Blind Peasant, both of whom could not explain themselves as the production was without dialog. The six-hundred-person crowd remained The Miracle’s strong point, bursting through the lobby and down the widened aisles to the enlarged stage in mimicry of frenzied medieval devotion. “It produced an effect that was at times overwhelming,\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 21\n\nstupendous,” announced the New York Times. Somewhere in that crowd was Joan and another show business newcomer, Bette Davis, both playing nuns and getting paid just enough for carfare. The production closed on 8 November 1924 when ticket sales could no longer cover the gargantuan weekly payroll of $40,000. Joan had left the production months earlier, celebrating her eighteenth birthday on stage in Albuquerque with her father in a vaudeville routine. After closing in Grand Rapids, Ed decided again to quit show business for good. For reasons no one could remember, the Blondells moved to Denton, Texas, north of Dallas, where the sandy East Cross Timbers meet the black soil prairies to cut a swath down the middle of the county. The Blondells found a comfortable, small home on Oakland Avenue near the town center, then opened a dress shop. “It was a screwy thing to do, for there isn’t a business brain in the family,” said Gloria later. Denton had a significant impact on the family. North Texas State Teacher’s College (now the University of North Texas) was there, and Joan enrolled with the intention of becoming a teacher. She worked in the dress shop, but she flunked algebra and did not do much better at English and science. She gravitated toward theatrics yet again, appearing in a production of George Bernard Shaw’s Candida produced by a local troupe. She enjoyed Candida and other forays into music or theater, including a minstrel show fund-raiser for the Kiwanis Club, but still she denied the greasepaint in her veins. Dress-shop saleswoman, teacher, even firefighter were higher on her wish list of professions. Twelve-year-old Gloria was showing a flair for drawing, and her work appeared on receipts, scraps of paper, and on mirrors in lipstick. Denton had the biggest impression on teenage Junie. He was smitten with a local girl named Eloise, and he soon announced his intention to marry her. He was itching to break free of the family and was looking for the right time. He never wanted to prance on stage, and he certainly did not want to roam the globe indefinitely. Joan heard from a local girl that a search was underway for Miss Dallas in an upcoming bathing-beauty pageant. The winner of the contest\n\n22 THE NEXT TOWN\n\nwould receive two thousand dollars and the chance to represent the city at the fall contest in Atlantic City. Joan grabbed an application and got to work. She bought a white bathing suit and dyed it regulation pink. She invented one tall tale after another, passing as native-born Rosebud Blondell. “It was a dirty trick to play on those Texas girls, the authentic Texans, I mean,” she said. “But I had used a Southern dialect in our vaudeville act and I’m afraid my bootleg accent was even more real than the Texas brand! There was a judge on the committee from Kentucky, so I proceeded to ‘indeedy’ and ‘suh’ him to death. He later told me it was a relief, ‘ma’am,’ to hear a real Southern accent after all this Texas twang!” Joan made the cut to the final five. “Girls, you are all too beautiful,” said the presiding judge. “We’ve decided to pick the girl who has the most pleasing personality. Miss Blondell, step forward, honey.” After the congratulations and shock abated, Joan telephoned Katie. “Mom—Ah’m Miss Dallas and you all has got to chaperone me to Atlantic City!” she cried. “If we thought Dallas had been enthusiastic, it was a mild splurge compared to the one stage in Atlantic City,” said Joan. “I tried to make it up to Texas, for posing as a native daughter, by being a peppy and popular representative of their state. On the hotel menu they featured a ‘Miss Dallas Salad,’ a ‘Rosebudy Blondell Steak,’ and a ‘Texas Ice Cream Pie’!” She wore a cowgirl outfit, hollered “yip-pee,” tossed ropes in the air, and shot toy guns. While there, she enjoyed sunbathing with the Misses Biloxi, Omaha, Seattle, and Minneapolis, her new-found and short-lived girlfriends. Miss Dallas took her place among the contestants in her skin-tight pink one-piece bathing suit and high heels. Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Illustrated News reported 5’ 21⁄2” tall Rosebud as “a pretty Texas lassie” who “made a deep impression on Pageant visitors for her continuous good nature.” The Atlantic City Fall Pageant was judged by a point system: fifteen for “construction of the head,” ten each for eyes, facial expressions, torso, legs, arms, hands, and “grace of bearing.” An additional five points each was assigned to hair, nose, and mouth. When the numbers were tallied, Joan took second prize in the Southwest Division.\n\nTHE NEXT TOWN 23\n\nThough “Rosebud” did not bag the top prize, there was a party in her honor back in Dallas. When it was late and she grew tired, she accepted a ride home from an Oklahoma millionaire she believed to be “an awfully nice old guy.” When they were in the car and on a dark street, he pushed himself on her for a kiss. She refused. “What are you playing me for, a sap?” he said. “I gave those girls [at the party] $200 for fixing this date with you. Now, little girl, don’t pretend you weren’t in on it.” As she struggled to break free, he tore her dress and slapped her hard on the face. Joan was bleeding when he drove the car down a highway with steep embankments on each side. She jumped out and tumbled fourteen feet before landing in a gully. One ankle was broken, and one was fractured, but she hobbled to a gas station a mile away. She went home, a doctor came, and she was on crutches for three months. A Dallas lawyer took pity and told Joan she could send her assailant to a penitentiary, but the idea of court action and further confrontation terrified her. She declined the offer. Texas ended badly. After the attack, the dress shop went under. The family was again on the road, with the palpably miserable Junie drafted to tote luggage and props. At some early age, Joan took up the family tradition of smoking to make her look more sophisticated, though she was too naive to be a Jazz Age flapper and too buxom to epitomize the current flatchested ideal. She did, however, bob her hair. Joan learned many things in her early years. She learned how to work through bone-deep fatigue, to avoid involvement with people she would have to leave, to get by in small, deprived living quarters, and to endure the conflicting personalities of her family. She learned to flirt simply by batting her eyelashes and to endure simple, low-cost food, clothing, and accommodations. She learned how to practice child care for a sister who was younger by nine years. Most of all, she learned how to troupe. She would not, however, learn emotional selfsufficiency. That would be forced upon her much later and under particularly cruel circumstances. Finally, the Blondells were back in New York in 1927, and Joan was again looking for something beyond vaudeville. She spent much of her\n\n24 THE NEXT TOWN\n\ntwo thousand dollar Miss Dallas winnings on clothes, housing for the family, and revising the act. With the remaining money, she bet that Jack “Manassa Mauler” Dempsey would win over Gene Tunney in their Philadelphia matchup. When Tunney won, Joan never gambled again and lost her stomach for prize fighting. The Blondell’s New York apartment was a one-room flat at Eightyfourth Street and Lexington. Crowded into the tiny space were five cots, three stools, a gas stove, and an icebox. The toilet was down the hall. Ed managed to get vaudeville work, but it was low paying. Joan needed to bring in money for the family. She tried out for the Ziegfeld Follies chorus and proudly told the dance director that she was a beauty contest winner, Miss Dallas, to be exact. The noted choreographer and casting director Sammy Lee shot back that he didn’t care if she was “Miss Manhattan Transfer!” Despite that inauspicious introduction, she was briefly with the Follies, then took a chorus job in the musical Rosalie with famed dancer Marilyn Miller. But Joan’s ankles were still too weak for strenuous dancing since the attack in Texas, and she was soon unemployed again.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nStarlight Her effectiveness in movies comes from her ability to be herself in front of a camera, to allow her personality to operate as freely as it does when she is taking a stranger into her home. —Don Bachardy, Stars in My Eyes\n\nWhen the Blondells arrived in New York for an indefinite stay, they were close to destitute. Twenty-year-old Joan and eleven-year-old Gloria took odd jobs, hating every one of them. Junie had a paper route. Father Ed did a solo routine as the live act before picture shows, but he never brought in more than ten dollars for a day’s work. The reduced conditions of vaudeville necessitated his absence for weeks. Joan waitressed a bit, but didn’t keep up with the practical skills she learned at the North Texas State Teachers College. Her tenure as purse salesgirl at one of New York’s swankier department stores didn’t last long either. She loathed the posturing formality of standing at attention waiting for customers to approach. Joan secured a job in a circulating library at Broadway and Eightyninth for eight dollars a week. Her shift was typically 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., then again from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., which was perfect for attending midday auditions. Her boss, kindly Esther Wright, recalled that Joan “was a good clerk on account of she would not let boys have dates with her unless they joined [Esther’s] circulating library. One night there were seventeen boys 25\n\n26 STARLIGHT\n\nlined up to join.” Joan wrote their numbers on the wall near the telephone behind the circulation desk, which eventually looked like a directory of Manhattan’s available young men. Because of cramped accommodations and fevered emotions at home, Joan often slept in the back of the library on a small cot provided by Wright. One night at closing time, a police officer came in. He engaged her in friendly conversation and said he had noticed her ever since she started working for Wright. As Joan began the closing ritual for the store, he urged her downstairs where packing boxes and business supplies were kept. The two were there alone, the light was faint, and the front door was already locked upstairs. His assault was fierce and sudden. He knocked her legs out from under her and she fell on the concrete floor. He went down with her, forcing a hand up her dress and tearing at her panties. From underneath him, Joan did everything she could to resist, first kicking and punching, then screaming for help. No one heard. When he was finished, he reassembled his uniform, warning Joan that he would kill her if she ever told anyone what happened. It was nearly midnight and the street was empty. Joan wandered in bewilderment, her wobbly legs barely able to support her. Eventually, she reentered the library to spend the night on her cot in the back. Sleep was impossible; she was taut from the shock and a jabbing pain in her lower back. There were precious few resources for a rape victim in 1927, and Joan was ignorant of options, so she honored his demand of silence for decades. Only much later did she tell her grown daughter, and later still she went public in her thinly disguised memoirs, Center Door Fancy. But one detail is missing from the book: about the policeman using his big, blunt hands to bend her feet back until she writhed in agony. It would be months before Joan saw a doctor for ongoing lower back pains she suffered from falling on the rock hard floor, telling him that she slipped on icy pavement. X-rays revealed a fractured coccyx, and he recommended no heavy lifting, plenty of hot baths, and no motherhood. When Joan returned to the theater, she was cast in a touring production of the courtroom drama The Trial of Mary Dugan, produced by the\n\nSTARLIGHT 27\n\nestimable cigar-chomping Al Woods. During the seven months she was on the road as a lisping chorus girl and understudy to the lead, she sent most of her paycheck to her family in New York. When the tour was over, she was back at the library, but she made sure never to be there alone. She secured a raise to eighteen dollars a week, the same salary she had made during the best of times at the dress shop in Denton. She earned no more than spare change in My Girl Friday, a tawdry production at the small but prestigious Provincetown Theatre in Greenwich Village. Joan contended with her parents’ worsening marriage. When Ed came back from one of his extended, wheezing vaudeville tours, he accused Katie of infidelity. After screaming and tears, and admissions by Katie that her life was a disappointment, Ed left again. One early morning soon after, Katie found a short note on the dining table. It was from Junie, announcing that he had run away to marry his Texas girlfriend. He added that he hoped father would show up again soon, but his departure was as much an effort to get away from his warring parents as it was to be with the girl he loved. The police recorded his disappearance as a teenage runaway and were not about to devote resources to finding him. Then Ed returned. Both he and Katie kept sparring, but they stayed together and kept the same address in hopes that their son would contact them. Everyone was relieved when Junie began writing letters, one announcing that he had married Eloise and another that he had landed a job in Denton dressing windows for the Woolworths Department Store. While she was struggling to make a stage career, Joan and millions of others observed the singular phenomenon of Al Jolson opening his mouth to talk in The Jazz Singer. In 1928, she saw Lights of New York, the first alltalking movie, and took special notice. Movies with sound were quickly becoming commonplace. If movies were going to talk, then wouldn’t they be needing theater actors with vocal training? Joan could not pursue the promise of the movies, as survival took the Blondells in different directions. Ed was ill and in need of warmer climate, so he and Katie collected their meager cash and drove their Model T\n\n28 STARLIGHT\n\nto Oakland, California, where Junie had moved with wife, Eloise, and their one-year-old daughter, Patricia. Gloria would stay with Joan, and both would send them whatever money they could. After an emotional parent-child parting, Joan was cast as Isabel Dawn’s baby sister in a forgotten comedy at the Blunkal Players in South Brooklyn. Money was still tight. “The first day of rehearsing, my sister, Gloria, took the subway out to Brooklyn to have lunch with me—and me with only a nickel to get home on,” recalled Joan. “So, I asked Isabel how I could get an advance on my salary and she gave me 50 cents, with which the Blondell sisters had a hearty lunch of tuna fish sandwiches and chocolate sodas at the corner drug store.” With all the demands on Joan’s time, she scarcely could look after Gloria, who, at twelve, was still young enough to need supervision. Joan went to the wealthiest person she knew and trusted, producer Al Woods, and borrowed one hundred dollars to pay for a car, driver, and expenses to send her baby sister safely across the country to reunite with her parents. Everyone was now gone, and the moment was terrifying. A childhood in vaudeville brought discipline, excitement, and ever-changing surroundings, but not solitude. To compound her despair, Joan was closer to abject poverty than at any point in her life. Esther Wright had another hard-luck case using the cot in the back of the library. When friends failed her, Joan was very nearly on the street. “I’ve known what it is to wonder where I was going to sleep when night came,” she said. “I’ve been at a stage of pocketbook flatness when half a sandwich, shared with another girl in the same predicament, was a banquet.” Joan was drinking black coffee and smoking a cigarette at the counter of a Broadway cafeteria when a young actor came in and sat on the adjacent stool. They began a conversation. He told her about an audition across the street for a new play called Maggie the Magnificent by the Pulitzer prize–winner George Kelly, who was all the rage after his recent stage hits The Show-Off and Craig’s Wife. Joan was suddenly animated, gulped down the remaining coffee, tamped out her cigarette, and hurried across the street.\n\nSTARLIGHT 29\n\nWhen she arrived at the audition, she found the place overflowing with hopefuls. “Every actor and actress alive wanted a part,” she remembered. “There were so many waiting I was sure I’d never get to see Kelly. Finally I got into his outer office and found myself jammed up against a red-haired mug. He looked at me and said, ‘Your eyes are so big they look like they’re about to pop out of your head. What’s there to be afraid of?’ ” His forthright, cocky manner was instantly appealing, but they did not introduce themselves. When Joan finally got into Kelly’s office, she found him to be polite and calming. “He sat me down and quietly began reading a few scenes from Maggie, sort of acting them out,” she said. “I howled. It was so funny. The writing was so good. I guess he could see that I really dug it, felt it. I got the part. And he never asked me to read a line.” Joan was cast in the supporting role of Etta, the brazen, gum-chewing wife of a bootlegger. James Cagney, the magnetic fellow who commented on Joan’s popping eyes, was also cast. Rehearsals started the next day. Kelly assembled the cast and said, “Now, boys and girls, we have hired you because we know you are experienced. I want the full benefit of all that experience. We think you know your business. Anything that occurs to you, please let me know—because I can’t think of everything. So—if you would do me that favor of speaking up? All right now, let’s go to work.” The play was in rehearsal for four weeks, and Joan was overjoyed to be featured in the first quality drama of her life. Kelly proved to be a fantastic teacher, coaxing Joan to a level of performing she could only achieve with sensitive and encouraging guidance. Maggie the Magnificent previewed in Boston and Atlantic City before opening in New York on 21 October 1929. Esther Wright was there, beaming. An assortment of Joan’s uncles, aunts, and cousins were there, too, but the immediate family wasn’t. Telegrams came from Ed, Katie, Junie, and Gloria in California. Joan was paralyzed with stage fright, but when the curtain went up she did her job as best she could, then accepted well wishes in her dressing room after the performance. The crowd dispersed, and Joan went back to her one-room apartment alone. She tried to call her parents and sister from the phone in the lobby of her residential hotel, but\n\n30 STARLIGHT\n\nshe couldn’t get through long distance to California. Finally, she tried to sleep amidst the giddy thrill of the evening. At some unnamed hour of the morning, Joan awoke to incessant knocking on the door. It was Esther Wright, breathless under a load of latest edition newspapers. Each one had a review in it lauding this new discovery, Joan Blondell. A more accurate title might have been Maggie the Mediocre; the play was not one of Kelly’s best. Here was a story of mother-daughter friction that was neither innovative nor particularly interesting dramatically. But Blondell and Cagney made sparks, and they were routinely praised as the best part of an otherwise dull evening. Both of them made their work seem easy, but each was a coiled spring backstage. According to Joan, “Jimmy Cagney made such a big hit in that first show we did together, he had to have a bucket in the wings so he could throw up every night before he went onstage. He was so nervous it was unbelievable, yet look how cool he always looked.” No doubt due in part to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Maggie the Magnificent did not do well at the box office, lasting only thirtytwo performances. Joan was hoping to “make good for [her] family, and maybe buy a new dress,” but she was disappointed. “No one was going to the theater,” she noted caustically. “Too busy jumping out windows.” Joan was in an agitated state herself, for reasons both personal and financial. In January of 1930, she was yoked to a miserable new play that closed during its out-of-town run in Pittsburgh. She was also caught in the heat of romantic yearning, and the object of her ardor was a fellow actor. “I believe it was the first time in my life I completely lost my sense of humor,” she remembered. “I was just the girl who was crazy about him. I worshiped the ground he walked on, but he nearly wrecked my life through worry. His main ambition seemed to be to try and drink himself to death. I was the most miserable person in the world during the time I was in love with him. He was so darn good and sweet—but such a drunkard.” In a moment of self-possession, she decided to sever contact with him and redirect her energies wholly to acting. It would not be the last time a man would cause her distraction.\n\nSTARLIGHT 31\n\nWilliam Keighley, an ambitious young producer-director who was preparing a play for Broadway, never forgot that dazzling couple he saw in Maggie the Magnificent on closing night. “Manna from heaven,” he declared. “I was looking for an attractive yet tough young cookie and a strong, beautiful broad, and here were [Cagney] and Joanie on that stage, the living breathing counterparts of the two I needed for Penny Arcade.” He contacted both of them, and they signed on in early February. Keighley was beginning a career in film while still producing on Broadway, and he simultaneously cast Blondell in the ten-minute short Broadway’s like That with Ruth Etting and newcomer Humphrey Bogart. Under the aegis of Warner Bros.’s subsidiary, Vitaphone, Joan appeared in two more shorts, The Devil’s Parade and The Heart Breaker, during the rehearsal period for Penny Arcade in the early weeks of 1930. A light rain fell over Manhattan as Penny Arcade opened at the Fulton Theatre on West Forty-sixth Street on 24 March. A rough three-act drama of bootlegging and murder set in an amusement park, Penny Arcade’s seedy milieu was faithfully reproduced down to a hot-dog stand and the outline of a roller coaster against the cyclorama. But visual details did not compensate for dialogue that failed to reproduce the argot of the outdoor showman or cover up the transparent mystery surrounding the murder. Penny Arcade was strictly humdrum melodrama, but Cagney and Blondell in support took the attention away from leads Eric Dressler and Lenita Lane. Al Jolson bought the film rights to Penny Arcade for $20,000, and he had a plan. He quickly sold it to the Warner Bros. film studio in California, but only under the agreement that Blondell and Cagney came attached with a three-week contract to film the play. Mighty Jack Warner hardly enjoyed being told who to cast in his movies, but he bought the property from Jolson with the rider that kept the two stage actors attached to the project. Blondell showed rare charm in her Vitaphone shorts, and Warner figured casting her in one movie was a minor risk. In a flash Joan was packing for Hollywood with the minimum promise of $250 a week for three weeks of moviemaking. The last Blondell in New York then trekked cross country by\n\n32 STARLIGHT\n\nherself, stopping only for gas, food, or sleep. She made her way westward in a dented old Ford Model T bought for the occasion. When she arrived in Southern California, dirty and drawn, she checked into the new Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard and awaited day one on the set. When Blondell and Cagney reported to work, they were met by Darryl F. Zanuck, the dynamic head of production at Warner Bros. “Well, we’re stuck with you for one picture,” he said. “Do you think you can play the roles?” “No,” answered Cagney and Blondell in sarcastic unison and without looking at each other. Both learned a lesson that day, as Zanuck took them literally and gave the top-billed roles to Grant Withers and Evalyn Knapp, while the two Broadway kids kept the smaller parts they had played on stage. Joan had the role of Myrtle, a tough-talking floozie, while the movie’s name was changed meaninglessly to Sinners’ Holiday. She was not photographed flatteringly with her naturally brown hair and splotchy makeup, but she showed an immediate ease with the camera. Once production was underway, and Warner viewed the rough footage with Cagney and Blondell, all uncertainties about their futures disappeared. Recalled Blondell: “Cagney and I had done our scene the day before and we were [on the back lot] to do a little more. All the bosses came down: Warner, Zanuck, and all of them, with a contract, a long-term, five-year contract, and they signed us on that back lot in the broad daylight. So that’s how that started, and from then on, it was one picture after another.” By the terms of her original long-term contract, dated 23 June 1930, Joan was to be paid $250 per week, with the option of a first annual raise of $150 week, and $200 thereafter over four years, topping out at a gross income of $1,000 per week by 1934. Immediately she signed with William Morris Agency and shaved three years off her age, immaturing from twenty-three to twenty in an instant. Cagney, already showing his moxie as a shrewd negotiator, started at $400 per week. Happily for Joan, the new contract meant the Blondells could afford to be reunited. Ed Senior, Katie, Joan, and Gloria moved to a bungalow on a quiet street in outland North\n\nSTARLIGHT 33\n\nHollywood in the San Fernando Valley, where farm-bred white leghorn chickens still outnumbered humans fifty to one. Soon the studio publicity machine was engaged, and reporters descended to scrutinize the two highly touted newcomers. Cagney withdrew from the glare, but Blondell kept them entertained. When one of them remarked on her beauty, she said, “Compliment my mother.” When another remarked on her timing, she said, “Compliment my dad.” Warner Bros. was poised for Hollywood supremacy in 1929 with its takeover of the production and distribution company First National. The studio had room to sprawl in suburban Burbank, and profits peaked at a whooping $14 million. The Crash put a stop to empire building, and by the following year profits were cut in half. Warner Bros. quickly grew lean and became the studio most modeled on assembly-line principles of the Industrial Revolution. In the early 1930s, Warner Bros. movies were fast, cheap, urban, and tough. Many of their topics were contemporary, drawing on modern vernacular and headline news, usually to do with city corruption, violent crime, and bootlegging. Apart from their substantial value as entertainment, they are enduring nuggets of sociology and history. Warner Bros. depression movies had an on-the-street immediacy and the authenticity of Edward Hopper’s paintings, Dorothea Lange’s photographs, and John Steinbeck’s novels. Its first generation of sound actors embodied gritty realism. Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, and Paul Muni were not exactly upstanding family men in most of their early films at the studio. They were, simply, thrilling powerhouse actors. So, too, were the women, led in the early 1930s by the soon-to-be stars Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Ann Dvorak, and Glenda Farrell, in addition to Blondell. The directors took no less a visceral approach to their work. Men like Mervyn LeRoy, William A. Wellman, and Michael Curtiz were above all muscular filmmakers who believed in telling adult stories and pulling no punches. The pace at Warner Bros. meant that quality had to be sacrificed too often, but the talent was there to make amazing movies with the right combination of story and personnel. On backward reflection, it can be said that\n\n34 STARLIGHT\n\nJoan found herself in the company of an unusually capable and energetic group of filmmakers. Joan’s schedule was punishing from the start. Her second movie, The Office Wife, was made so fast it was finished and released before Sinners’ Holiday premiered. Apart from her passing appearances in the three Vitaphone shorts, The Office Wife, not Sinners’ Holiday, offered the movie world its first glimpse of Joan Blondell. Lovely Dorothy Mackaill was the star, playing a secretary who entered into complicated affairs with two men. Joan, her hair still a darker brown than it would later be, had a supporting part as Mackaill’s sister. Joan was pretty and charming, and the camera loved her. She teased the audience in her opening scene as director Lloyd Bacon maneuvered the camera while Joan rolled out of bed, took off her lingerie, and drew a bath. A careful listen will reveal that she stumbled on not one but two of her lines, while the hurried pace of production ensured the camera kept rolling and the takes were used. Such gaffes made no tangible difference in the movie’s financial success. Louella Parsons opined that The Office Wife “is what some of our slangy friends call a ‘natural,’ a story that will hold the interest of ‘fifty million’ wives and equally as many secretaries.” Considering that it was based on a novel by Faith Baldwin, who made a fortune from topical yarns of women at work, Parsons was not taking great risk in her augury. When Sinners’ Holiday was released a month later, it was an unofficial audition for the Cagney-Blondell team, and they both came through spectacularly, especially Cagney. As the high-strung murderer, Cagney set the standard for his signature roles to come in The Public Enemy and White Heat. If Joan created a lesser stir than Cagney, there were no complaints. “We were getting paid, and times were tough, so we were happy and grateful!” she said. In the early days, Joan rebelled only when Jack Warner suggested she change her name to Inez Holmes. It was absurd, and she dared to tell him so. Why would anyone want to change a name as evocative of bright stardom as Blondell? It was so perfect, in fact, that it already sounded like an invention of studio marketing. Warner came to see the wisdom of her\n\nSTARLIGHT 35\n\nview, and eventually she would overcome her inherent shyness to again confront the boss. Other Blondells were settling in Southern California. Gloria enrolled at Beverly Hills High School, earned excellent grades, and pursued her interest in the visual arts. Ed and Katie moved from Oakland to live with Joan. Ed took bit parts at Warner Bros. while Katie ruled the North Hollywood home, since Joan’s one-movie-a-month work schedule hardly permitted her to shuck peas or trim the hedge. Katie still maintained her own life. She started going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings because she found the seriocomic human parade of cases fascinating to behold. Where does humor come from if not from the worst tragedy, she reasoned. Word got out that Joan Blondell’s mother was a drunk, so Joan had to ask her to stop going to the meetings. Joan meanwhile won fans at the studio, and none more ardent than James Cagney. He nicknamed her “Grandma” and declared her “a great taker of direction.” His praise was unequivocal: “She could have done many better things than the roles they gave her. If she hadn’t looked like a tootsie she’d have made a great Lady Macbeth.” She was entranced by smart, tall, athletic Lewis Warner, son of studio boss Harry. But their brewing romance was destroyed just months after they met by Lewis’s cruel death at twenty-two from pneumonia. Joan was rushed into another supporting role in Illicit, a louche potboiler built around the emerging talents of fellow Warner’s newcomer Barbara Stanwyck. Blondell played Stanwyck’s friend “Duckie,” a goodtime girl too naughty to bother with undergarments. Blondell’s character is drawn to be as wanton and exciting as Stanwyck’s, but isn’t given the screen time to prove it. Illicit is quite blue until the conventional finale, which has reformed playgirl Stanwyck becoming a dutifully adoring wife. Louella Parsons judged Illicit to be “as smart as next year’s frock, as modern as television, and as sophisticated as a Parisian hotel clerk,” while Joan’s sharp performances inspired her to add that “Little Blondell has been scoring with unfailing regularity since her success in The Office Wife.”\n\n36 STARLIGHT\n\nShe was sporting an attractive new look in Illicit, as her lightened hair ideally complemented her bright, round face. So far Joan’s roles were limited to four types: sister, floozie, girlfriend, and gold digger. A pattern emerged, and Joan began to see what the business had planned for her. At Warner Bros., she was initially walked through minor roles in inconsequential movies, always managing to sparkle amidst mediocrity. Other Men’s Women, a drama of rail men, featured Joan’s first reunion with James Cagney. The set was made enjoyable by the presence of costars Regis Toomey and Mary Astor, who became good working friends to Joan. She played a diner waitress, and under the guidance of a quality director like tough-talking, hard-living William A. “Wild Bill” Wellman, she made a fine if brief impression. Her gift for one-liners decongested the movie of heavy drama: BLONDELL,\n\nto two customers. Anything else you guys want?\n\nCUSTOMER\n\n#1, looking at her rear end. Yeah, give me a big slice of you on\n\ntoast—and some French fried potatoes on the side. BLONDELL.\n\nListen, baby, I’m A. P. O.\n\nCUSTOMER\n\n#1, to CUSTOMER #2. What does she mean, A. P. O.?\n\nBLONDELL.\n\nAin’t Puttin’ Out.\n\nShe thought nothing of the dialogue. She memorized what she was given and did what she was told. After spending her youth in flophouses and backwater theaters, she was only too eager to succeed in Hollywood. “God, the weather here,” she said. “How can you beat that? Good weather, and a decent paycheck. If only they didn’t overwork us.” On 14 January 1931, Warner Bros. announced production of The Public Enemy, a cautionary tale on the criminal underworld plaguing America’s big cities. It was to be based on real mobsters who rocked Chicago in the gangland wars of the 1920s. Filmed in twenty-six days for $151,000, The Public Enemy distinguished itself as something above the routine crime dramas for which Warner Bros. was known. It endeavored to explore the root\n\nSTARLIGHT 37\n\ncauses of law breaking, suggesting that young boys begin with petty crime, join gangs, then graduate to armed robbery, bootlegging, and murder until they are saved or come to a bad end. Prohibition, the constitutional amendment intended to curb vice, is seen here as contributing to a lethal new black market. All of the film’s merits as social drama are eclipsed by its greatest asset—James Cagney. He shot to the highest levels of stardom with The Public Enemy, but there are weaknesses in his breakthrough movie. Beryl Mercer overplays her role as his long-suffering mother, and Blondell as a gun moll is given too little to do. But mostly The Public Enemy is a startling series of potent images made possible by the collaboration of director William A. Wellman and Cagney. It remains a prototypical gangster drama, and certainly the most important film of Joan’s career to date. Wellman promised Zanuck that he would direct “the toughest, the most violent, most realistic picture you ever did see.” Wellman delivered. In keeping with The Public Enemy’s cynicism, Joan and Mae Clarke are a pair of nightclub tarts we meet at a table shared by two men passed out drunk. Before the film is over, we get kidnapping, the senseless killing of a horse, machine-gun spray, sensational murders, and one unforgettable moment with Cagney, Clarke, and half a grapefruit. In Night Nurse, a rookie nurse (Barbara Stanwyck) must fight a plot to murder two fatherless children. Sidekick Joan was insolent and gumchewing this time, with a quip always at the ready. With The Public Enemy’s Wellman in charge, Night Nurse was coarse and uncompromising even by Hollywood pre-Code standards. Just as Wellman quickened heartbeats across America with the harsh sounds of bullets, screaming, and falling bodies in The Public Enemy, so, too, does he excite the screen in Night Nurse with screeching ambulances and inherently dramatic hospital props. As an amoral chauffeur, newcomer Clark Gable had an animal magnetism that caused Blondell and Stanwyck to swoon. “When he showed up the first day, Barbara and I had to sit down,” said Joan. “There was something about him that was overpowering.” In the history of Hollywood lingerie,\n\n38 STARLIGHT\n\nNight Nurse deserves honorable mention. Throughout the movie, Stanwyck and Blondell doffed their street clothes and medical uniforms so as to display silky private apparel. Joan’s complicity paid off. The raise promised by her original contract came six weeks early, with her earnings now up to four hundred dollars a week as of May 1931. In public, Joan adapted to growing fame. She observed with a smile, “When I first got into pictures, there would be something on the marquees saying ‘Dallas’ Own Joan Blondell,’ or ‘Battle Creek Michigan’s Own Joan Blondell’ or ‘Chicago’s Own Joan Blondell,’ because someone would remember that I’d been to school there for a week. [So I became] America’s own Joan Blondell.” At home in North Hollywood, however, she and Gloria were treated like children living with their parents. Since Lewis Warner’s death, there was no romance for Joan, only the growing affection of friends confined to the studio. As a talented and successful young actress, she was kept under glass. Her world was small, and her earnings were not hers. The Blondell’s vaudeville ethos remained in place. Whatever was made was shared, sometimes excessively so. Even at four hundred dollars a week, Joan had to take an advance on her wages in July. The reserved girl backstage at the vaudeville theater had not really gone away, and Joan was feeling a greater disconnection between her screen image and the real woman. She shunned public events such as premieres and large benefits. “The shyness only leaves me when I work,” she once said. It left her in The Reckless Hour, released in August of 1931. Joan was called upon to wisecrack yet again, this time as the jealous glove-selling sister to haughty Dorothy Mackaill. Joan got whatever good reviews the movie earned. “Miss Blondell has a way about her that is fascinating because she can spout off the most obvious lines without making them the least bit obvious,” noted the Los Angeles Evening Express. “It’s her knack—and a good one.” To Variety, Joan “nearly steals things.” In August of 1931, Joan signed a new long-term contract at Warner Bros. amidst much hope for the future. Jack Warner saw great promise in her, and it was his intention to focus on her potential for stardom. She was part of\n\nSTARLIGHT 39\n\nthe wave of new blood that infused the movie industry as silent stars floundered under the microphone. Not coincidentally, many of the first generation of sound actresses who made it big in Hollywood came with New York stage credits. Joan belonged to a breathtaking sorority: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Barbara Stanwyck, Kay Francis, Ruth Chatterton, Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Joan Crawford, Nancy Carroll, Irene Dunne, Ann Harding, and Sylvia Sidney all did stints on Broadway before movie contracts lured them westward. On consideration, Joan did not have to wait long for a major break; she was in Hollywood just over a year before Blonde Crazy came along. But already she was the veteran of eleven movies, and it must have seemed to her that she was bumping around that town forever. Blonde Crazy was the happy reunion of Blondell, Cagney, and writers Kubec Glasmon and John Bright, all contributors to The Public Enemy. And just as Blonde Crazy was shooting, Joan received the good news, in September of 1931, that the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers (WAMPAS) had selected her as one of Hollywood’s “Baby Stars,” i.e., a real up and comer. The WAMPAS honor was well timed. Joan had appeared in two movies, The Public Enemy and Night Nurse, that would endure as classics of the Warner Bros. tradition, but Blonde Crazy was the first time she was given a movie worthy of her talent and a leading role. Shot in the fall of 1931, Blonde Crazy was the fourth of the seven Cagney-Blondell matchups. Cagney once again gives us the hardened but sympathetic street mug, while Blondell juggles both worldliness and innocence in one adorable twenty-five-year-old package. Much of Blonde Crazy plays as a delightful, fast-paced comedy of lovable immorals out to fleece the rich. In an era that saw every imaginable grift, these two were just what audiences wanted. “The age of chivalry is past,” Cagney announces to Blondell, his new partner in crime. “This is the age of chiselry.” How Cagney, fellow con man Louis Calhern, and Blondell execute their various scams and counter-scams involving jewels, counterfeit money, and horse racing is wholly good-natured. As is noted in Blonde Crazy, “honest men are as scarce as feathers on a frog.”\n\n40 STARLIGHT\n\nBlonde Crazy changes tone in the last half hour to become a more hard-boiled vengeance drama. The transition isn’t satisfying, but the attraction of Blonde Crazy comes from the fantastic time Blondell and Cagney have working off each other. Joan exhibits a delightfully casual relationship with the camera in a bathtub scene where she gently chastises Jimmy for his voyeuristic interest, all the while giving the audience a sideways glance at her shapely and unfettered right breast. She makes it look easy, without pretense or self-consciousness. Considering her lack of experience with men, seduction, and romance, her acting here is remarkably instinctive. As testimony to his great rapport with the screen, Cagney toys with Blondell’s panties and bra without making an ass of himself, while Blondell lets it be known that she’s no mere trifle. “Blondell’s beauty as a ‘broad’ is that she can outsmart the man without unsexing him,” wrote film scholar Molly Haskell. “Cagney’s beauty as a male is that he can be made a fool of without becoming a fool.” Indeed, the incongruously amusing sight of him in a bellboy’s uniform lets us in on the joke. Cagney’s masculine power allows him to be subservient to no one, even when he is dressed in a uniform of capitalist oppression. Blondell’s feminine power comes from her easygoing sexual selfconfidence that never lapses into vampish excess. Together they create a barely contained erotic heat. And it may be said that Blonde Crazy has some of the wittiest indignant slaps in movie history. The shenanigans of the two mischievous stars are so endearing in Blonde Crazy that the tilt toward straight ahead drama feels like stealing candy from children. Blonde Crazy was released in November of 1931 and was a sizable hit. Cagney received no raise after The Public Enemy, but held out and demanded one above his current $450 a week rate after Blonde Crazy. He was told no, so he walked, the first star to do so. He told Joan to follow him, but she couldn’t. She did not have his early track record, she had no hit on the level of The Public Enemy to call her own, and she had a family to support. Neither was she inclined to be self-promoting or demanding of others. After much negotiating, Cagney came back for $1,000 a week. Joan stayed quiet, happy to earn her keep and add to the household account.\n\nSTARLIGHT 41\n\nWith Blonde Crazy such a success, Joan was beginning to understand her appeal. “I would get endless fan mail from girls saying ‘That is exactly what I would have done, if I’d been in your shoes, you did exactly the right thing.’ So I figured that was my popularity, relating to the girls,” she said. “They just wanted more of the same thing. All you got were new clothes and new sets, but the stories were pretty much alike and I was the same type. But those early days of talkies were incredible, what with the soundproof camera booth and everything. I think that’s why they signed Cagney and me so fast, ’cause we just went through it like we were on a stage and they weren’t used to that. We were showing something different, something fast and to the point.” Joan was next cast as a tainted chorus girl in Union Depot, a wellreceived ensemble effort set in a busy train station. Right on top of it came The Roar of the Crowd. There was concern that Joan would have to be replaced because Union Depot would not be finished on time. But Warner Bros. sped up its conveyor belt, and Joan was scheduled to begin one movie while the other was wrapping. In The Roar of the Crowd, she was to play Lee, Cagney’s skittish girlfriend, while Ann Dvorak was to play Anne, the romantic interest to Eric Linden, a boyish actor playing Cagney’s younger brother. When filming began, however, Blondell said, “I can’t play a neurotic,” and Dvorak said, “I can’t play an ingénue.” The two switched roles with the full blessing of director Howard Hawks. Executives were watching costs on The Roar of the Crowd, renamed The Crowd Roars, since it required location scenes at Indy, Ventura, and Ascot Motor Speedway. The investment was worth it, for the racing footage of professional drivers is shockingly realistic. Hawks portrays the sport as gladiatorial, the dust, grease, and noise mingling with hysterical fans screaming as cars corkscrew through the air and burst into flames. Anne was a thankless role in a man’s movie, and Linden did not offer the on-screen interest Cagney did, but Blondell generated some heat. Her emerging dramatic skill kept her character sympathetic even when she said, “You can take those hard-drinking, hard-riding men and put them in a truck and\n\n42 STARLIGHT\n\nshove them over a cliff.” Certainly we were meant to feel the pain of all women who get too close to daredevils, but the script asked her to be too embittered for a background ingénue. At the end of 1931, just as James Cagney more than doubled his income, Warner Bros. cut salaries 20 to 30 percent to stave off Depression bankruptcy. With a $14 million debt, there was also talk of selling assets such as Warner’s theaters. Joan became an ever more valuable commodity as she played variations on the same character in inexpensive quickies. She was hustled into The Famous Ferguson Case in early December, with a schedule that overlapped with the making of The Crowd Roars. Ferguson offered a stale critique of yellow journalism as Joan played a New York sob sister. The production’s rushed schedule showed; director Lloyd Bacon let his actors over speak or stand idly by looking tentative. True to the studio’s interests, it capitalized on current trends. Ferguson played off the rise of women in American journalism. More renowned fictional embodiments, Lois Lane and Brenda Starr, most notedly, soon invaded the marketplace of popular culture. It was now clear to Joan just how rough this Warner Bros. gig was going to be. The studio was a place of “hard, hard labor and gruesome hours,” she said. “The studio did protect you because you were a moneymaker— but it was backbreaking and it was a good thing that you were young or you couldn’t have stood it. The biggest treat was when you got time off to go to the bathroom.” Contracted actors “were put on the payroll like bank clerks,” according to film historian Charles Higham. They were “given strictly limited vacations—which could be canceled at a moment’s notice— and put on suspension or even dismissed without recompense if they refused to play the roles to which they were assigned. The corps of producers and writers had strict instructions from Jack Warner to make sure that absolutely nobody was ever left idle for a moment. If no vehicle was fully prepared for a star, Jack Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck were to be seen pacing uneasily about, chewing hard on their expensive cigars.”\n\nSTARLIGHT 43\n\nJoan’s daily grind reflects this pre-union corporate ethic. She awoke at 4, made grotesque faces in the mirror to warm up, slammed down coffee and toast, then drove her battered old Ford Model T to the lot. Traversing the empty streets as the morning light began to shine was the only time of an average day that Joan could be alone without immediate responsibilities to anyone. “We started work at 5 in the morning,” she said, “makeup, all that junk, then whammo on the nose! Straight over to the set at 8, knowing all your lines. We’d work clean through the day until after sundown, then on Saturday and always right through Saturday night. They’d bring in sandwiches like straw for the horses and we’d finally make it into bed on Sunday morning as the sun hit the pillows.” Menstrual cycles were charted, with two days allowed off each month for cramps. “They’d even plan us going to the ladies room,” laughed Joan. If she was in command of tomorrow’s shoot, she could enjoy a few pages of a novel, instead of a script, before falling asleep. Warner Bros. movies of the early 1930s were usually shot in less than four weeks. Lloyd Bacon, who directed Joan eight times, actually used rehearsal footage in final prints. “Writers were pressed to crank out their stuff by the yard,” wrote Cagney. With such a schedule expected of actors, directors, writers, and technicians, it is no surprise that much garbage was unspooled in movie houses across the country. But the industry remained solvent. Movies were the form of mass entertainment in an age when choices were few and two hours in the dark was a distraction from bread lines, bank runs, and foreclosures. There was enough talent, drive, and care to ensure that Joan and others of the Warner Bros. stable occasionally found themselves in movies of real distinction. Much has been said about how many movies Joan made during her years at Warner Bros., but less has been said about how good some of them remain to this day. In less than two years in the business, she had already made The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy. Joan was having trouble falling asleep one night. She was due the next morning on the set of a new studio, Goldwyn, where she was on loan for one\n\n44 STARLIGHT\n\nmovie. When she arrived just after sunrise, she was struck by the difference from her professional home at Warners. The sets were more plush, and the actors were treated to afternoon teas, soft music, private makeup artists, hairdressers, personal maids, and haute costumes. The Chanel gowns she wore glittered and clung seductively under hot lights, and her five-hundreddollar-a-week paycheck was the result of a minor bidding war. Joan was platinum blonde here, with exacting attention paid to eye liner and dark lipstick. She looked gorgeous and, not surprisingly, she loved the indulgence. She was making The Greeks Had a Word for Them, a comedy packaged by the industrious Samuel Goldwyn. She had come by it though indirect means, as a replacement for Carole Lombard, who dropped out after two weeks of illness. “Nobody believed she was sick,” said cast member Ina Claire. “I think she knew it was a lousy movie and she just wanted out.” Claire underrated Greeks, a breezy concoction about three mantraps adept at lightening the wallets of their blinded prey. The source material, Zoë Akins’s Broadway play called The Greeks Had a Word for It, was considered too suggestive by the censors. “It” became “Them,” as though audiences would not catch the innuendo anyway. Even with petty intrusions, Greeks was a step above the gruel Joan was usually fed at Warner Bros. The bracing dialogue and keen timing of the women offered worthwhile amusement. They spent the better part of the movie stealing each other’s men, falling in and out of love, then kissing and making up over “drinkies.” The Greeks Had a Word for Them was hardly a landmark movie, but it was momentous in Joan’s life. In the months that she had been in Hollywood, there was scarcely time to breathe, much less find romance. But behind the camera of The Greeks Had a Word for Them was slender and stylish George Barnes, a cinematographer who gave loving attention to Joan’s photogenic beauty. Joan flirted, and George made his moves, first pursuing her before she hurried off the lot and home to her parents. Idle conversation led to dinner. When they began dating, Joan suddenly found herself in the society of Hollywood elites. She was appropriately star struck. “I had been one\n\nSTARLIGHT 45\n\nof those kid fans of Ronald Colman,” she said. “To me, Ronnie’s home was the most homey I’d seen. The evenings were fabulous there. He and his friends were so distinguished, and he had divine humor. We’d all tell stories, and sometimes he’d get up and act them out while we’d all be sitting crosslegged on the floor and couch. Those were beautiful, wonderful evenings.” Barnes began as a still photographer and at thirty-seven had become one of the best cinematographers in the business. By the time he first worked with Joan, he had already earned four Academy Award nominations. His expertise was in soft-focus photography, which was particularly flattering to women. The look at Warner Bros. in the early 1930s was harsh realism. Under Barnes’s thoughtful play of light and shadow at Goldwyn, Joan at last embodied the glamorous and radiant 1930s movie star. Here was a man who promised to take care of her, to spoil her even, at least for the length of the shoot. He was much more than a technician. His steady attention from behind a lens had an undeniable erotic charge. What did Joan know of men sexually, except that some of them were rapists? Here was George Barnes giving her gifts and seducing her with mood music and liqueur by fireside on Saturday nights. On one of those nights, they made love for the first time.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nHammer and Tongs People like her never won awards. They just saved movies. —John Kobal, People Will Talk\n\nThanks to George Barnes’s connections, Joan was enjoying high-class company, but she remained unostentatious, disliking showy hats, jewelry, and makeup. She went to premieres only when ordered by the studio, as she was when Union Depot had a pull-out-the-stops opening at Warner’s Hollywood Theater. It distinguished itself as a sharp, engaging drama that refused to go soft for an artificial happy ending. Joan invested the penniless chorus girl with a waiflike vulnerability that more closely approximated who she was than all those brassy, in-charge dames she usually played. Joan, meanwhile, was grappling with her sexual attraction to George. “Here was a young woman who has been completely isolated, her life had been family and work,” said Joan’s daughter many years later. “She was not worldly. When she gets to George Barnes, she doesn’t have a clear picture of what to look for in a man. She had her father, who adored her, but even her mother was jealous of that relationship. Like Ed and Katie, there’s a major age difference between Joan and George. There you are, six days a week—your world is small. She was very pretty and very naive. He was kind and gentle.” George had a short neck and narrow shoulders, but he dressed well, was gentlemanly and good-looking. He also had a soft-spokenness that Joan 46\n\nHAMMER AND TONGS 47\n\nand other women found appealing. In fact, George was a serial monogamist who was in his third marriage when he met Joan. It was all but over by 1932; he was in Hollywood and she was in New York. More seasoned friends, both male and female, told Joan that George was notorious for being a silver-tongued Romeo. Joan did not, or would not, listen to such warnings, instead telling movie magazines that she pursued him, not vice versa. And then there was the matter of his vocation. It is no surprise that she was seduced by a man who was charged with making her look every inch the alluring movie star. Actresses married cameramen with some regularity in Hollywood. The Crowd Roars and The Greeks Have a Name for Them came out side by side in March of 1932 to strong reviews. The "
