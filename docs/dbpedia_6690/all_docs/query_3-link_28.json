        "text": "Welcome to the California Film Commission!\n\nThe California Film Commission is your one-stop resource for film, TV, and commercial production across the Golden State. California is home to the entertainment industry … and for good reason. We have the best weather (315 days of sunshine), wildly diverse locations (from 840 miles of coastline to vast desert sand dunes), highly skilled crews and the best production infrastructure.\n\nOur vast array of tools and resources will help you navigate all sorts of production issues, from work permits to on-set safety. Find links and contact info for relevant government agencies, industry associations, guilds and unions, production directories, entertainment job listings and more. Find useful charts for studio zones weather and college locations to name a few.\n\nWe look forward to helping you make your next project in California a success!\n\nOur Commitment to Growing California’s Film/TV Production Industry Has Never Been Stronger!\n\nOn July 10, 2023, Governor Newsom signed legislation to extend and expand California’s Film and TV Tax Credit Program for an additional five years through 2030-31. This decisive action will directly create an estimated 60,000 production jobs and $10 billion in related investment across the state.\n\nThe fourth-generation tax credit program (Program 4.0) demonstrates California’s commitment to retaining our status as the media production capital of the world. It is a vital and necessary tool to keep and grow production here at home, where it belongs.\n\nIn all, California’s Film and TV production industry supports well over 700,000 jobs and nearly $70 billion in wages for in-state workers. It is an economic engine that powers everything from production employment and tourism to our extraordinary creative spirit.\n\nIn addition to the five-year extension, Program 4.0 will make tax credits refundable, opening the program to a broader range of applicants and generating even more jobs, spending and opportunity. Another key aspect of Program 4.0 is its enhanced focus on workforce training, diversity and inclusion. Several expanded and new features will create opportunities for individuals from underserved communities. The goal is to help reduce economic, geographic and social barriers to career access and success. There are also specific policies for addressing harassment and increasing industry representation of women and monitories.\n\nI’m proud to report that California is committed to offering the film/TV production industry the best value, as well as the best values.\n\nThe team here at the California Film Commission is ready to assist in making your next project a success!\n\nColleen Bell, Executive Director\n\nCalifornia Film Commission"
