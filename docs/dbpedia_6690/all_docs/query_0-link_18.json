For whether we like it or not, and whether for good or ill, we are all vitally connected to the past, involved in it through its enduring influences on our lives. And if we doubt this statement, all we need to do is think about the personal legacy of our parents and grandparents in our own lives. We may escape from our ancestors, leave home forever and leave them to their deaths, but we only fool ourselves if we think we are truly free of them.The past does not necessarily predetermine present and future events; but if we remain ignorant of the past, then we cannot really understand the nature of our own lives now, and we increase the risk of dooming ourselves to allowing the past to decide the continuing course of events. That is, in order to influence how the present and future will develop, we must know the past—whether we speak of the collective human past or of our own personal lives. Surely that is reason enough to study history. Surely that is more than reason enough to study the era of the Great Depression, which has had such an enormous impact on subsequent events worldwide and on the lives of people we know personally. So what can we confidently know about the past? Any historic work probably should contain a warning to the reader. For despite protestations of objectivity, historians inevitably bring some bias to their accounts. Quantitative analysis supposedly achieves objectivity; but interpretations of statistics depend upon the thesis the analyst has begun with, the nature of the questionnaire or other instrument used to gather data, and the formulas the analyst applies to the data, not to mention the final “massaging” the analyst performs. A thesis may prescribe outcomes by determining the questions asked; respondents sometimes misinterpret questions, give misleading answers, or even lie; analysts apply formulas that suit their own biases—we need only listen to how three different economists, let us say, interpret the same set of economic data in order to agree to the validity of this statement. If bias influences statistical analysis, then it seems most unlikely it would not enter into narrative history. For one thing, sources can be misleading, frequently on purpose. For example, Herbert Hoover is known to have made numerous factual errors in his Memoirs, so anyone who uses them should be wary; but how does one know that in advance of reading them without knowledge of the subject and of historic commentary? Inaccuracy, of course, is common in memoirs—recollections are often faulty or self-serving. In addition, the historian who interprets the sources cannot help bringing personal biases to the interpretation. If the historian’s biases are clearcut, then fair enough. For example, no reader will mistake that, in general, Robert S. McElvaine, in his highly readable The Great xi\n\nxii\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nDepression, evidences some disdain for the Hoover administration and some admiration for Roosevelt. Furthermore, concerning the historian’s bias, there is an obvious problem involved in selecting materials and information. As the great historian Charles A. Beard, not one to hide his own biases, once commented, “Writing any history is jut pulling a tomcat by its tail across a Brussels carpet.” Only those tufts of wool that snag in the claws get used, but the vastness of the carpet and the intricacy of its design remain unpenetrated. And there is still another problem. Regardless of how voluminous may be the writings, speeches, letters, memoirs, or recorded conversations any individual leaves for the researcher to peruse, finally that individual’s ultimate motives and precepts remain elusive—sometimes they are purposely obscured, sometimes they are not even known to the individual.You cannot, after all, get inside another person’s mind. Eleanor Roosevelt once said of her husband, the president, that she recognized he was a great man but that she did not really understand who he was. So the absolute truth about the past events cannot be known, but we can at least approximate the truth closely enough to make knowledge of the past both amply reliable and highly useful for understanding the present. That’s what I have hoped to achieve for readers in this book. The central format of the book—brief narrative overviews, chronologies and excerpts from sources— lends itself, I believe, admirably to such an achievement by allowing the reader to step into the era at any point. This format, along with the photographs, biographies, texts of sources, and bibliography, also allows readers plenty of scope for coming to their own understanding of the Great Depression. Readers of this book are not told, “Here is exactly what happened and this is how you should interpret it.”We read usually on our own, privately, in silence, and the end result is of our own making. Reading a history is like reading a novel—it finally means whatever it means to you personally. Just so, readers of this book are left free to draw their own conclusions. But then, having said that, I think I must add one final warning: Even I might be biased. Make your own judgments.\n\nPREFACE TO THE UPDATED EDITION For this edition I have provided significant new material to both the narrative and the Eyewitness Testimony sections of every chapter as well as the biographies, and I have expanded the bibliography with scores of additional sources, including many published since the original edition of this book appeared. More than two dozen new photographs and charts have been added. And a modest update of the introduction also provides some reflection on the legacies of the New Deal informed by more recent scholarship. To the narrative sections I have added extended commentary on the longterm effects emanating from the Treaties of Paris and Versailles that ended World War I; commentary on Gertrude Ederle’s conquest of the English Channel and curious fads of the 1920s; a lengthy insertion on the possible causes of the Great Crash; a focus on the early achievements of Robert Hutchins Goddard; an overview of the tax rebellions of the early 1930s; material on the youths of America joining the ranks of the hoboes; expanded treatment of the experiences of African Americans and women during the depression years; a segment on the popularity of comic strips and comic books; a discussion of horse racing and the career of Seabiscuit; insights into the Roosevelts and the movie industry; and a sidelight on the development of major art collections by American entrepreneurs. The Eyewitness Testimony sections now contain new text reflecting the views of Eleanor Roosevelt; Irving Fisher and other prominent economists; reminiscing hoboes; Franklin D. Roosevelt in his fireside chats; and many other commentators. I sincerely hope that readers will find all of this new material both interesting and valuable.\n\nxiii\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS It is impossible to thank all of those whose work I have depended on in writing this book, so I would like to offer a blanket expression of appreciation to scores of historians who have published books and articles on the depression era. I would also like to thank, once again, the staff of the University of Kentucky M. I. King Library, whose resources have always proven a splendid benefit; I wish in particular to thank Thomas M. House for his help in the library’s Photographic Archives, Special Collections. My thanks also go to the staff of the Library of Congress, most especially Michael Cooper of the library’s Photoduplication Service. And, as always, I wish to thank my wife, Helen Rendlesham Burg, for her patience and support.\n\nxv\n\nINTRODUCTION FROM THE FIRST EDITION Some events have had such profound and enduring impact on subsequent history that they emerge from the past as pivotal events, forming a definable break between what came before and what followed. The Great Depression of the 1930s stands out as such an event. Lasting for a decade, the depression and the enormous social, economic, and political changes it wrought altered the course of the entire remaining 20th century in ways that no one could have anticipated even as the 1920s were ending. During the 1920s, American politicians and the general populace as well may have been especially myopic about foreseeing the likelihood of the coming depression—let alone its enduring effects. P reoccupied with that decade’s economic surge, t h ey appear in re t rospect to have enthusiastically embraced the faith that the historic cycle of economic boom and bust had finally been ove rcome and that the new prosperity would last forever. Some knew better, of course. Among them, American farmers and bl a c k s , who mostly endure d the prosperous decade of the twenties, we re struggling to survive. Others suddenly began to sense their faith’s possible fragility when the Great Crash of the New York stock market occurred in the fall of 1929. Although economic decline did not begin precisely at that moment, the crash was a wa rning of things to come. The collapse of prosperity that followed in the early thirties took an enormous toll. Millions of American workers lost their jobs, with no hope of finding other work that could maintain their livelihoods. Fo l l owing the loss of work ensued lost savings, lost homes, lost security, lost pride, and lost hope for many who had never before experienced such extreme deprivation. Investors went bankrupt, banks failed, factories closed, corporations foundered, farmers lost their farms, sharecroppers lost everything. Politicians initially displayed confidence but offered no solutions. The majority of Americans who remained employed evidenced their compassion and caring through communal efforts to re l i eve the hunger and homelessness of the less fortunate. But private as well as state relief efforts have their limits, of course; and as the depression persisted through 1932, the demand for remedial action by the federal government grew.The hesitancy of President Herbert Hoover’s administration to respond cost him reelection and swept Franklin Delano Roosevelt into the pre s i d e n c y. Roosevelt’s inauguration in March 1933 marked the beginning of an unprecedented political transformation. The federal government would now xvii\n\nxviii\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nassume varied roles that it had never before been expected to perform. Although lacking a defined vision of a comprehensive, long-term plan for change or of the potential outcomes his policies might effect, Roosevelt asserted the willingness to act, to experiment, and to improvise in hopes of overcoming the depression. His New Deal generated a vast array of economic and social programs that largely endure to this day and have influenced the life of every American alive during the past 70 years. These programs encouraged labor unionization; instituted regulation of banking and investment; promoted soil and forest conservation; funded massive public works projects; provided oversight for interstate commerce, communications, and transportation; established a process for subsidizing and controlling agricultural production; and, perhaps most important of all, created a social insurance system whose keystone is Social Security. The New Deal changed forever American social, economic, and political realities. Ironically, however, the bold experiment failed to end the Great Depression. In Europe and Asia the depression provided the context for the burgeoning of extreme militaristic and nationalistic movements in Germany and Japan that culminated in World War II, with its eruption of terrible destruction, horror, and inhumanity.That war forced the United States to become not only a major participant in world events but also the primary defender of democratic and capitalistic systems in the cold war hostility with the Soviet Union (USSR) that followed.That protector and policeman role persisted until the hegemony of communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe began to unravel rapidly following the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989. But many remnants of the Great Depression endured through these cataclysmic events. As economic cycles of growth and recession have continued, for example, governments throughout the world have combatted the downturns with policies that were initiated during the depression years. In the United States, opponents of the New Deal legacy have continuously battled against some federal and state programs it created—such as regulations of commerce and relief payments—and others spawned in later years through its ongoing momentum. Even now conservative candidates for the presidency and the Congress campaign as advocates of dismantling or drastically revamping these programs, while liberal candidates ardently defend them and propose their expansion. Both opponents and proponents thereby acknowledge that the New Deal’s influence still pervades current U.S. social and economic systems. Thus the ghost of the New Deal haunted the Capitol during the 1994 failed struggle to create a national health insurance system, a program the Social Security Act of 1935 had overlooked. And as the debate over passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution proceeded in early 1995, opponents invoked the presumed sanctity of Social Security—expressing their fear its funding might be imperiled by the amendment—as ample reason to vote against it. Major conflict has focused on revising the “welfare system,” whose initial programs emerged during the New Deal, and on scrapping funding for the arts, a New Deal innovation that was phased out before World War II and reemerged in altered form in the 1960s and 1970s. In just such ways, and others probably more significant and pervasive, perhaps beneficial or perhaps detrimental, the legacy of the Great Depression endures. And the events of 70 years past continue to unfold into the future.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFOR THE UPDATED EDITION The overview presented in the original introduction still applies, as may be affirmed, for example, by the continuing debate over the future of the Social Security system. The administration of George W. Bush appears intent upon promoting revision of that system to allow wage earners who so desire to invest a certain percentage of their incomes that would be subject to the Social Security tax in private investments rather than having it subsumed into the Social Security fund. The impact such a change, if translated into law, would have on the Social Security system and on the retirement prospects for the socalled baby boomers generation remains to be seen. Deserving of mention here is recent scholarship arguing that the New Deal, while widely viewed as having secured the primacy of traditional American political liberalism and the various reform programs its adherents had supported for many decades, actually subverted traditional liberalism in favor of a collectivist-oriented liberalism (in other words, socialist or marxist), a collectivist image of government, and the aggrandizement of power in the presidency.This is not entirely a new argument but actually a revival of objections presented during the New Deal era by both conservative opponents and disaffected liberals such as Senator Hiram Johnson, who at the time expressed grave concerns that the New Deal, perhaps especially during the years 1935 to 1938, was propelling the nation toward socialism and dictatorship. It should be pointed out, of course, that such concerns emerged within a background context of ascendant fascism and Stalinism in Europe and elsewhere. This argument as currently stated is ably expressed by Gary Dean Best in his The Retreat from Libera l i s m (2002). Best points out that traditional liberals sustained their faith in capitalism and its ability to reverse the depre ssion through rev ived and increased industrial pro d u c t i o n , while the new c o l l e c t ivist liberals—Felix Frankfurter prominent among them, Best say s — embraced the view that capitalism was either mori bund or dangerous (the latter evidenced by fascism in Italy and Germ a ny) or both and there f o re needed to be replaced by a collectivist system. The collectivist liberals had been persuaded by the advocacy of Harold J. Laski, well-known British Labour Party official and marxist, says Best. He quotes Rexford Tugwell as stating that these new liberals perc e ived Congre s s ’s sole purpose to be transferring “wide emergency powers” to the White House. “Thus,” observes Best, “the Congress elected by the people was not re g a rded as a partner in government, nor even as part of a system of checks and balances, but as a rubber stamp on policies formulated without public debate by the White House junta.” Best adds, “The subsidization of America under the New Deal for the sake of the leader’s political fortunes obscured the loss of liberty that was taking place under it.” To the extent that the collectivist liberal agenda succeeded, the New Deal failed totally in its efforts to remedy the depre ssion, in Best’s judgment. Whether Best’s view has validity will likely be re s o l ved by the debate that is certain to develop over future ye a rs. What can be said with certitude for now at least is that the collectivist liberal agenda Best outlines foundered upon congressional and judicial opposition and finally upon the pressing need for re n ewed dependence on America’s capitalist production system to confront the challenges of wa r. In short, events\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nbeyond the collectivist liberals’ influence or the president’s control determined the outcome. Nevertheless, the issues of governmental checks and balances, the magnitude of presidential power, and rival visions of what the nation’s government should be and do merit continuing argument—as they have since the administration of George Washington.\n\n1\n\nPrelude to Crisis 1919–1928\n\nTHE TREATY OF VERSAILLES Although historians frequently cite 1929, the year of the Great Stock Market Crash, as the beginning of the Great Depression, they generally agree that the origins of the depression trace to the decade that preceded it and even to the cataclysm of World War I that predicated major events of the twenties and thirties. Certainly for the United States, World War I and its immediate aftermath, including the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, set the stage for subsequent trauma: the foundering of Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, postwar disillusionment over the Allies’ aims, American isolationism, the Red Scare, race riots, Prohibition, the emergence of the mob. So the era of the Great Depression cannot be fully understood without first garnering at least some modest knowledge of the decade that preceded it. The Treaty of Versailles, finally signed on June 28, 1919, after months of haggling, is a good starting point. This controversial settlement partitioned the Austro-Hungarian Empire into autonomous states; awarded the Danzig (Gda´nsk) corridor to Poland, dividing Prussia into separated areas; ceded Germany’s Saar coal mines to France; mandated Allied occupation of the Rhineland for 15 years; granted the Allies the right to try Kaiser Wilhelm II for war crimes; awarded German colonies in Africa to the Allies; and imposed a monumental reparations bill on Germany—among other onerous stipulations. The only concession that President Woodrow Wilson had won at the Paris Peace Conference in his quest for a “just and honorable peace” based on his Fourteen Points was the creation of the League of Nations (a precursor to the United Nations). The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Great Britain’s prime minister David Lloyd George observed at the time, predestinated a German hunger for revenge and set the stage for a larger war within 25 years. Whether the Treaty of Versailles directly fomented the advent of World War II in Europe—and prevailing historical judgment argues that it did not— the treaty’s terms, perceived by the Germans to be a “dictated peace” (Diktat), most certainly provided the catalyst for resurgent German nationalism and the political destabilization of the Weimar Republic during the 1920s. The treaty’s stipulations bred the widespread view among Germans that their generals and politicians had betrayed them—that they had been “stabbed in the back” and 1\n\n2 The Great Depression\n\nforced to accept a dishonorable peace settlement that violated Wilson’s Fourteen Points, even though they had never actually been defeated. As peoples’ actions and responses derive from their perceptions of reality, from what they believe to be true but more than likely is not, so for the Germans the prevailing view of the Diktat provided a compelling dogma that generated desires for exoneration, remediation, and vengeance. Adolf Hitler and other extremists would exploit these perceptions and desires aggressively.The Weimar Republic, plagued as well by severe economic turmoil and inflation resulting largely from the financial burdens imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, foundered as a consequence. Furthermore, in the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Asia, and Africa, the Peace of Paris and its related developments established conditions and mandates—including arbitrary boundaries for new nations in the Balkans, creation of Iraq under British control, denial of promised Arab independence, recognition of the Zionist movement’s claims for inhabiting areas of Palestine, and other circumstances—whose repercussions continue to trouble the world to the present time. Ironically, the one concession Wilson achieved, the League of Nations, proved to be his undoing. On July 10, the president personally delivered the Treaty of Versailles (264 pages in length) to the U.S. Senate; the treaty would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote. The Senate rejected the treaty in November and again in March 1920 on a second consideration. The major reservation to the treaty motivating his Senate opponents was recognition of and membership in the League of Nations. Wilson, his health destroyed by his strenuous effort to secure ratification (he had traversed more than 8,000 miles in a single month of speech-making) and his stature reduced by the vitriolic comments of Senate opponents such as Henry Cabot Lodge and William E. Borah, was a broken man, unable to fulfill his duties after suffering a stroke.\n\nPROHIBITION, RACISM, LABOR UNREST Coincident with the struggle over the treaty came the onset of Prohibition. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution secured ratification by the requisite number of states in January 1919. In October 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act, enabling legislation for enforcement of Prohibition to begin in January 1920. The act defined an “intoxicating” beverage as one containing more than 0.5 percent alcohol and resulted in creation of the bootlegging industry to satisfy Americans’ desire for stronger stuff. Gangster “Scarface” Al Capone moved from New York to Chicago to be in the right place to take best advantage of the boot-legging opportunities presented. Within a few years he had 700 hoodlums and the suburb of Cicero under his complete control. Chicago was also the scene of one of the worst race riots of the century. Demobilized African-American troops, believing their contribution to the fighting had earned them a better stake in America, found a new spokesman for militancy in Marcus Garvey when they returned home from Europe and World War I. But whites had little desire to make concessions, and race riots broke out all over the nation in the summer of 1919. In the Chicago riot, which lasted 13 days, 38 people died and more than 500 were injured, mostly blacks. Partly in reaction to the riots but also reflecting a rising intolerance of\n\nPrelude to Crisis 3\n\nimmigrants, Jews, and Catholics, the Ku Klux Klan experienced a rebirth in the early twenties, gaining enormous political clout not only in the southern states but also in some states of the Midwest and even the Pacific Coast.Through the efforts of Edward Y. Clarke of the Southern Publicity Association and Imperial Wizard Hiram W. Evans, the Klan attained some 4.5 million members by the end of 1924. The social and political tensions that racial animosity exposed were made worse by labor unrest in the fall of 1919 in the midst of a postwar depression that threw hundreds of thousands out of work while the cost of living spiraled upward. In September the Boston police went on strike, demanding higher wages and better working conditions. Subsequent riots and looting resulted in the intervention of the Massachusetts militia.The police capitulated and agreed to return to duty; but the police commissioner, supported by Governor Calvin Coolidge, dismissed them all and hired a new force. Also in September, 300,000 steelworkers, some belonging to the American Federation of Labor (AFL), began a nationwide strike to secure a shorter workweek—in some mills the workers toiled seven days a week, 12 hours each day.Violence followed in\n\nMembers of the Ku Klux Klan parading down Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C., 1926 (Library of Congress)\n\n4 The Great Depression\n\nsome mill towns, causing the dispatch of federal troops, and by the year’s end the strike had failed. Coal miners belonging to the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), led by John L. Lewis, struck for higher wages and a shorter workweek. A board of arbitration awarded the strikers a 27 percent wage increase but no reduction in hours.\n\nTHE 1920 ELECTION The presidential election year of 1920 was a turning point in the United States. For one thing, it marked a milestone for American women, as the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution attained ratification in August, awarding women the right to vote in subsequent national elections. And those elections would offer a far broader choice than many previous ones. For example, in the presidential election of 1920 seven parties fielded candidates— Republican, Democratic, Farmer-Labor, Single Tax, Prohibition, Socialist Labor, and Socialist. The Socialists, originally one party, had split into two camps, with the courageous Eugene V. Debs heading the Socialist Party. Imprisoned by the Wilson government along with some 20,000 others for sedition because of his public opposition to World War I, Debs campaigned from his cell—the first imprisoned man ever to run for president—and received nearly a million votes. Socialist activity worldwide, linked with the labor strikes in the United States, the perceived threat of communism resulting from the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, and the deployment of Allied troops (British, French, and American) in Russia in 1919 to try to destroy the Bolsheviks and restore the czarist government, contributed to the Red Scare of 1920 and the resultant massive arrests of anarchists and other political agitators. Bomb plots abounded, fueling the scare. One bomb detonated on Wall Street in September 1920 caused 38 deaths. The so-called Palmer Raids—launched by Wilson’s attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, and the Justice Department’s new head of the Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, to suppress the “Reds”—rounded up thousands of suspected radicals, including hundreds of aliens who were summarily deported. Many Americans protested against the raids as violations of civil liberties. The Republican candidate for president, Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, with Coolidge a vice presidential candidate, won the 1920 election handily with the promise of a return to “normalcy” following the tumult of war, revolution, race riots, labor unrest, and political hostility between president and Congress. His inauguration in March 1921 brought Republican dominance of the federal government and policies to encourage capitalist enterprise, ushering in the Roaring Twenties, sometimes referred to as the “age of excess.” Ironically, it was the ostensibly conservative Harding who would pardon Debs, freeing him from prison, an act Wilson had adamantly refused to consider.\n\nTHE HARDING YEARS The war years had brought prosperity, but the Harding presidency began in depression. The United States’ gross national product (GNP, the total value of goods produced) had nearly doubled from $37.1 billion in 1902 to $73.3 bil-\n\nPrelude to Crisis 5\n\nlion in 1920, with commensurate increases in productivity in both agriculture and manufacturing. Union memberships soared along with the economic growth. Stimulants to the economy during the war years included booming exports of agricultural products, federal price supports for crops, loans to Great Britain and France, and greatly expanded demand for manufactured goods, especially war supplies and cars. Motor vehicle registrations rose from 468,000 in 1910 to more than 9.2 million in 1920. The federal budget increased tenfold, from $500 million in 1902 to $5 billion in 1920. Unfortunately the war had also generated $21 billion in federal debt. With the war’s end, economic collapse ensued. Perhaps hardest hit by the collapse were America’s farmers.They had prospered during the war. Estimates indicate that the value of farm produce rose from $4 billion in 1914 to $10 billion in 1918, providing farmers with an\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon (Library of Congress)\n\n6 The Great Depression\n\nenormous increase in income and purchasing power; many of them invested this windfall in more land, and land prices had skyrocketed, especially in the Midwest. Now as wartime demand for American produce dissipated and European farms began returning to production, the prices American agricultural products could command abroad began to fall. At the end of May 1920 the Harding administration announced the end of wheat price supports. Wheat subsequently dropped from $2.50 a bushel to under $1.00, and the prices of all other agricultural products soon dropped also. Farmers faced disaster— bankruptcies, foreclosures, dispossessions.They would experience little hope of recovery throughout the twenties, despite federal programs to provide low-cost loans and to impose higher tariffs on agricultural imports. Big business, however, confronted a bright future. The corporations had stalwart champions in Harding’s secretary of the treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover. An unyielding opponent of progressive taxes, most certainly those created by the Wilson administration to help pay for the war, Mellon set about pressuring Congress to reduce taxes for corporations and the wealthy and to transfer the tax burden largely to those in the middle- and lower-income brackets. Business leaders could also take heart from Harding’s approval of an act to rationalize the budget process by creating a budget director to advise the president on the annual budget and a comptroller general to audit all the government accounts. New legislation (the FordneyMcCumber Tariff Act) canceled the lower tariffs instituted by the 1913 Underwood Act, substantially increased tariffs on manufactured goods, and gave the president the authority, in some circumstances, to raise or lower tariffs as much as 50 percent (Harding would mostly raise them). American oil companies’ interests in particular were favored by the Harding administration’s policies, especially by approval of a revived treaty with Colombia that eased that nation’s lingering disgruntlement over the United States’ intervention to effect the independence of Panama. Both domestic and foreign policies, then, became means of benefiting American commercial interests. Harding’s presidency, most historians judge, marked a new record for nonachievement and corruption. Not that Harding was hopelessly incompetent; but he was, even by his own admission, some contend, out of his depth. Nor apparently was he corrupt personally, but he allowed his administration to be exploited by associates who were. Actually the judgment that Harding achieved little or nothing during his tenure as president may be overly harsh, given the brevity of his administration. His able secretary of state, Charles Evans Hughes, assisted by members of Congress as delegates to the Washington Conference held in November 1922, negotiated reductions in naval forces among Great Britain, Japan, the United States, France, and other nations; prohibition of the use of poison gases; and recognition of the rights of the signatories to their territories in the Pacific—a rare instance of international cooperation. The president secured congressional approval of the SheppardTowner Maternity Act, which provided federal funding to states that established health care programs for mothers and infants—social welfare legislation that anticipated New Deal proposals. Harding made four appointments to the Supreme Court—former president William Howard Taft, George Sutherland, Pierce Butler, and Edward Sanford—but none emerged as a distinguished jurist. Evidencing some enlightenment, especially compared to his Progressive\n\nPrelude to Crisis 7\n\npredecessor who had appointed avowed racists to important posts in his administration, Harding publicly criticized the system of segregation in the South and sought passage of a law that would give federal courts jurisdiction over trials for lynchings. As for corruption, that charge sticks. Cronies known as the “Ohio Gang” (Harding’s home state) had succeeded in getting Harry M. Daugherty installed as attorney general. In this post Daugherty was able to provide protection to his bootlegger friends and defraud the government of funds from bonds. As head of the Veterans’ Bureau, Charles I. Forbes apparently siphoned off $200 million from his agency through sales of supplies and through fraudulent land and construction deals.There were numerous other scandals. Most notorious of them all was the Teapot Dome scandal. Teapot Dome in Wyoming was the site of naval oil reserves that Albert B. Fall, Harding’s secretary of the interior, managed to get control of from the navy in exchange for other reserves in California; Fall then accepted bribes to lease the Teapot Dome reserves to private firms. None of these scandals became known to the public until after Harding’s sudden death in San Francisco on August 2, 1923.\n\nCOOLIDGE PROSPERITY As vice president, Coolidge succeeded Harding. Since he largely shared his predecessor’s economic views—Coolidge would declare succinctly that “the business of America is business”—there was no change in policy except for a new emphasis on honesty. All but one of Harding’s cabinet officers retained their posts. The exception was the suspect Daugherty, who was replaced by Harlan Fiske Stone, whom Coolidge would later appoint to the Supreme Court. Under the authority of the Fordney-McCumber Act, Coolidge continued Harding’s policy of raising tariffs on imports, which decreased American foreign trade and exacerbated the farmers’ problems. This policy also crippled the European nations’ ability to repay war debts. Nevertheless, the great economic boom of the twenties now replaced the postwar depression—except, unfortunately, for farmers, African Americans, and Hispanics. The depression, along with the ending of wartime government protection of each worker’s right to join a union, had also diminished organized labor’s influence in seeking better wages and hours, and the numbers of union members would fall through the remainder of the decade. Having secured the blessing of America’s business leaders , Coolidge easily won the Republican nomination for the presidency on the first and only ballot at the party’s convention in 1924. As part of its platform, the party advocated opposition to nullifying war debts and to the League of Nations and acceptance of the World Court. At their convention the Democrats quarreled over the League of Nations and the Ku Klux Klan.The delegates fudged the League issue, rendering dead any hope of official American recognition of that institution.The conflict between urban and rural elements of the party over the Klan ended in stalemate, with no mention of the Klan in the platform. But the vehemence of the conflict exacted a heavy toll: It took 103 ballots to nominate John W. Davis, a lawyer from West Virginia and former congressman and ambassador to Great Britain.With the slogan “Keep Cool with Coolidge,” an appeal to continuing the economic good times most Americans were experiencing, the president had no\n\n8 The Great Depression\n\ntrouble defeating Davis and all the minor party candidates, including the popular Wisconsin liberal Senator Robert M. La Follette, candidate of the Committee for Progressive Political Action (CPPA). Coolidge’s decisive election enabled the success of his policies in Congress. Secretary Mellon finally got his way with taxes: The tax law of 1926 reduced both the federal surtax and estate tax rate from 40 percent to 20 percent and eliminated the gift tax—adding up to a boon for the wealthy. Business leaders persuaded Coolidge of the virtue of expanding credit, thereby fueling the economy. The money flowing into the financial network encouraged banks to buy government bonds and to loan investors funds for purchasing stocks and bonds, including European securities, and real estate. The banks also prompted installment buying (credit financing). However questionable the easy credit policies may have been—resulting in a growing burden of indebtedness and many uncollectible loans—they generated enormous prosperity in the United States and a semblance of it in Europe. Corporate net income in the United States surged from $8.3 billion in 1923 to $10.6 billion in 1928, a 28 percent increase. The great majority of Americans, again excepting the farmers, shared in the prosperity. Even industrial workers saw their earnings increase during these five years by 8 percent, while the average workweek shortened by nearly two hours to 45.7 hours. Average unemployment never exceeded 3.7 percent. The boom was enhanced by increased mechanization of production; cheaper electrical power; and new growth industries, such as automobiles, refrigerators, radios, and movies. Continuing an anti-immigration policy begun by the Harding administration with the 1921 Emergency Quota Act, the Coolidge administration imposed further restrictions through still lower quotas based on national origins mandated by the Immigration Act of 1924, which reduced the average influx of immigrants from 700,000 per year to 300,000 (by 1927 to only 150,000) and effectively excluded Japanese immigration. The act generated resentment in Europe. Even Coolidge’s adamant insistence on the repayment of war debts further irritated relations with the European nations, already distressed over high American tariffs. Germany, reconstituted as the Weimar Republic following the war, defaulted on paying most of its reparations bills, but the burden of the payments it did make and the lingering effects of its war-shattered economy generated explosive inflation and threatened it with economic collapse. The Dawes Plan (named for Director of the Budget Charles Gates Dawes), put forth by the Americans and accepted by the Allies and Germany in September 1924, provided for a five-year graduated schedule of payments by Germany and reorganization of the German currency and the Reichsbank. The Coolidge administration fostered the plan, of course, because reparations payments would help the Allies pay their debts to the United States. Germany was able to meet the payment schedule, but only through borrowing heavily abroad (especially in the United States); and during 1925, the German economy finally began to show signs of ultimate recovery. Such efforts to encourage prosperity abroad in order to sustain it at home were nearly the sum of the Coolidge foreign policy, given mostly to isolationism, except for continuing though lessening the United States’ recurrent interventions in the affairs of the Latin American nations and the administration’s\n\nPrelude to Crisis 9\n\ninvolvement in two initiatives to engender world peace. The first peace initiative was a conference in 1927 at Geneva to discuss further reductions in naval forces that Coolidge sponsored in the wake of the so-called Locarno Treaty, a series of nonaggression agreements the Europeans had negotiated at Locarno, Italy—these included demilitarization of the Rhineland, German treaties to arbitrate differences with neighboring nations, and French mutual assistance pacts with Poland and Czechoslovakia. Unfortunately the French and Italians rejected participation in the Geneva conference, which meant only Great Britain, Japan, and the United States were involved and that nothing of substance was accomplished. The second initiative was a “declaration renouncing war as an instrument of national policy” and promising the resolution of disputes by “pacific means”; it was designed by Foreign Minister Aristide Briand of France and Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg, who succeeded Hughes in 1925.The Kellogg-Briand Treaty, as it was known, became the Pact of Paris in August 1928 with the endorsement of 15 nations. Afterward it was signed by the Soviet Union, which the Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge administrations refused to recognize as a sovereign nation because of their opposition to communism.\n\nPASTIMES AND PLEASURES With developments abroad relatively peaceful and at home unusually prosperous, Americans turned to the pleasures afforded by automobiles, radio broadcasting, motion pictures, sports, and other indulgences. Americans’ love affair with the car began in the twenties. By 1929 the automotive manufacturers were producing 4,455,000 cars per year (plus thousands of trucks and buses), and more than 23 million cars were registered to owners. The federal government did its share, by providing assistance to pay for constructing 190,000 miles of road. And the automotive industry had become the nation’s most important business; its annual production at the end of 1930 was valued at $3.5 billion.The industry also fueled the growth of numerous other industries (steel, rubber, oil) and created new ones (service stations, garages, roadhouses)—all, of course, contributing to increased water, soil, and air pollution. The petroleum industry, for example, leaped ahead, stimulated by a 500 percent increase in the consumption of gasoline during the decade. But cars did not merely spur the economy; they caused major changes in the way Americans lived. Cars brought mobility to farmers, forced the revamping of city streets, accelerated the development of suburbs, and may have provided a major impetus for revolutionizing women’s fashions (with skirts rising to knee length making it easier to get in and out of cars). Although preeminent, cars were not the only fascination for Americans among changing modes of transportation.The airplane also commanded attention. More than likely, the interest derived largely from public enthrallment with the solo flight of Charles A. Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927 and the hero worship his feat evoked. Additional interest ensued when Amelia Earhart became the first woman aviator to make a solo transatlantic flight the following year. It was during the twenties that radio was born. On November 2, 1920, KDKA in Pittsburgh, operated by the Westinghouse Electric Company,\n\n10\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nbecame the first broadcasting radio station in the nation. Twenty-one other stations had joined KDKA by 1922, and by 1929 there we re 606 stations nationwide, about one-third of them controlled by either the National Broadcasting Company (NBC, founded in 1926) or the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, founded in 1927). Another new industry was born. Total annual sales of radios jumped from $60 million in 1922 to more than $842 million in 1929. In an effort to systematize broadcasting, Congress establ i s h e d the Federal Radio Commission in 1927 to awa rd licenses and wavebands. The new radio network introduced regular broadcasting of new s , re l i gious services, sports, mu s i c, and entertainment programs. It offered regular bro a dcast features such as Amos ’n’ Andy, Bing Cro s by, Jack Benny, and Rudy Vallee and created a new means of advertising. The burgeoning popularity of motion pictures during the twenties created yet another giant industry, including the construction of palatial cinemas in cities and towns throughout North America. Receipts from ticket sales more than doubled from $301 million in 1921 to $720 million in 1929 as average attendance climbed from 40 million to 80 million per week. By the end of the decade Adolph Zukor’s Paramount Pictures alone controlled 1,600 movie theaters; Paramount’s rivals Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer controlled hundreds more—all three firms we re major film producers as well. Sound began creeping into the theaters by 1925, and in October 1927 Warner Brothers released the first movie with spoken dialogue plus singing, The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson.The star system had emerged, transforming actors such as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford , Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson, G reta Garbo, John Barry m o re, and Douglas Fairbanks into celebrities as Hollywood assumed dominance in the international film industry. Baseball continued as the national pastime—despite being rocked by stories revealing the scandal of the “fixed” 1919 World Series that occupied the sports pages in 1920. Annual attendance at major league games averaged between 9 million and 10 million throughout the decade. Babe Ruth was the king of the sport, hitting his record 60 home runs in 1927. That was also the year of the second heavyweight championship boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney—a Chicago rematch of the renowned 1926 fight that brought in $2.6 million. Bobby Jones was the star of the professional golf circuit; Bill Tilden, of tennis. Knute Rockne, coach of the Notre Dame University football team, held similar stature in his sport. To an unprecedented degree, Americans indulged themselves in spectator sports, but they also—men and now women as well—took up tennis, swimming, golf, and bowling on their own in increased numbers. Of some note, the swimming scene became transformed when, in September 1921, Atlantic City held its first Miss America Beauty Pageant, in which contestants introduced one-piece swimsuits that exposed the legs to above the knees. On a quite different level, Gertrude Ederle excited public attention in 1926, when she became the first woman to swim the English Channel. Five men had preceded her in swimming the channel, but Ederle surpassed the record swim by more than two hours, despite encountering hard rains, turbulent waters, riptides, huge waves, flotsam, and even sharks. Following her return home to the United States, the 19-year-old reaped acclaim nationwide, with a\n\nPrelude to Crisis 11\n\nBabe Ruth (Library of Congress)\n\nticker-tape parade in her home city of New York, numerous celebrations and receptions, a meeting with President Coolidge, a vaudeville tour, and a role as herself in the movie Swim, Girl, Swim. Fads seem to be an ever-present feature of American society, and, perhaps symptomatic of the decade’s exuberance, the twenties witnessed a plethora of them. Some we re bizarre, others punishing. Among the latter, marathon dancing propelled couples into at times hundreds of hours of dancing, re s u l ting in extreme fatigue and incapacity. Perhaps the most bizarre of the 1920s fads, flagpole sitting emerged in Hollywood in 1924, when former sailor and inept boxer Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly ensconced himself atop a flagpole for 13 hours, 13 minu t e s . The feat garnered Kelly so much publicity that he traversed the nation to replicate it in nu m e rous cities. For the remainder of the decade Kelly’s exploits inspired others, including many teenagers, to follow his example. By 1929 youngsters nationwide battled for fame as winners of the Ju venile Flagpole Sitting Championship of the World.\n\nARTS AND LITERATURE The twenties marked a golden age in American literature and significant d evelopments in painting, a rc h i t e c t u re, and mu s i c.The names alone of A m e rican writers of the “lost generation,” so dubbed by Gertrude Stein, reveal the literary achievement: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, E. E. Cummings, Langston Hughes, William Faulkner, John Dos Pa ssos, and Eugene O’Neill. T h ey joined predecessors such as Willa Cather, Wallace Stevens, and Sinclair Lew i s , who produced major works during the\n\n12\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nd e c a d e. In fact, all of Lewis’s notable work—such parodies of the middle class as Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith— a p p e a red in the twenties; he was the first American writer to re c e ive the Nobel Prize in literature, in 1930. Theodore Dre i s e r ’s literary monument, An American Tra g e dy, also appeared in 1925. (On a rather different plane, but of long-term import, in 1922 DeWitt and Lila Wallace founded Reader’s Digest in the basement of their Greenwich Village home; by 1940 the magazine would have a nationwide re a d e rship of 7 million.) This was also the era of the so-called Harlem Renaissance, a literary flowering centered in New York City’s black community of Harlem. Among its most accomplished writers we re James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes—and later Zora Neale Hurston. Painters and sculptors, such as A a ron Douglas, Meta Warwick Fuller, William H. Johnson, and Palmer Hayden we re also involved. Harlem was also a major source of jazz creativity. In addition, historians and sociologists produced re i n t e rp retations or seminal studies of life in America past and pre s e n t , such as Charles and Mary Beard ’s monumental history The Rise of American Civilization (1927) and Robert and Helen Lynd’s revealing study of life in a “typical” city, Middletown (1929). Reflecting such European art developments as cubism, American painting moved in new directions.The famous photographer Alfred Steiglitz introduced the works of American abstractionists—Arthur Dove, Charles Demuth, and Georgia O’Keeffe—at his gallery in New York City. Other artists, such as George Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton, Edward Hopper, and Charles Sheeler, whose works more clearly reveal the preoccupations of the era, pursued a native realist tradition. The opening of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1929, however, suggested the beginning of a more experimental art era. In architecture the skyscraper, invented by the Chicago school of architects (William LeBaron Jenney, Louis Sullivan, John Wellborn Root, and others) before the turn of the century, came into its own, not by way of new styles or developments but rather by its proliferation in cities across the continent. The popularity of Raymond Hood’s Tribune Building (completed 1925) in Chicago and William Van Allen’s Chrysler Building (completed 1930) and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon’s Empire State Building (completed 1931) in New York symbolized the skycraper’s dominance and the prevailing taste as well. The decade was distinguished for advancements in building technology and height, though not in design. Nevertheless, Frank Lloyd Wright returned to the United States in 1922 after a four-year stay in Japan and resumed work here on a small scale at least, designing houses to suit the Southern California terrain. And immigrant European architects Raymond Schindler, Richard Neutra, William Lescaze, and Eliel Saarinen introduced new, unadorned, cubistic forms into American architecture though remaining relatively unknown during the decade. In American mu s i c, a c h i evement approaches that for literature. It was apt that F. Scott Fitzgerald christened the twenties the Jazz Age. Introduced through Dixieland jazz music in the war years, jazz flourished in new styles during the twenties. Paul Whiteman’s orchestra made jazz a familiar sound nationwide after 1924. But the new jazz took its most fruitful inspiration from the blues performed by legendary African-American singers and performers such as Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter) and Bessie Smith. White\n\nPrelude to Crisis 13\n\nmusicians joined in. Jazz greats Louis Arm s t ro n g , Bix Biederbeck, Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, and Benny Goodman saw their care e rs blossom by mid-decade. It was the hey d ay of New York’s Cotton Club and other night spots devoted to the new mu s i c. George Gershwin’s career as a composer arose out of this jazz scene to attain fruition with R h a p s o dy in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928). Musicals such as Sigmund Romberg’s The Student Prince (1924) and The Desert Song (1926) and Jerome Ke rn’s Showboat (1927) sustained the popularity of this genre. Classical music also bu r g e o n e d . The three most re n owned music schools in the nation—Eastman in Rochester, New York; Ju i l l i a rd in New York City; and Curtis in Philadelphia—we re founded in the twe n t i e s . Well-known conductors such as Leopold Stokowski and Arturo Toscanini guided orchestras in major U.S. cities to international pre e m i n e n c e.These orchestras performed A a ron Copland’s new compositions, some adopting jazz rhythms and themes.\n\nCAUSES, SCIENCE, AND CRUSADES Thus, beneath the surface calm of the Harding and Coolidge presidencies the nation evidenced fermenting cultural change. And many of the intellectuals involved in the literary and artistic developments of the twenties also became involved in other events that indicated fundamental tensions and conflicts in American society. Among the most noteworthy of these events were the trial and execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti and the trial of John Thomas Scopes. During the Red Scare period, a period in the 1920s of strong anticommunist sentiment, a shoe factory robbery in South Braintree, Massachusetts, resulted in two deaths. The Italian immigrant anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for the crime. Intellectual leaders such as Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter, novelist John Dos Passos, and poet Edna St.Vincent Millay protested the trial and sentencing as an injustice; despite their efforts, the two men were executed on August 23, 1927. By contrast, not politics but religion formed the context of the 1925 trial of Scopes, accused of teaching the theory of evolution to his high school classes in Dayton, Tennessee, in violation of state law. Scopes was in fact guilty, he had broken the law to provide a test case of its constitutionality.The renowned lawyer Clarence Darrow, who had the year before successfully evoked an insanity plea that spared murderers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb from execution, came to town to defend Scopes. His opponent was William Jennings Bryan, frequent presidential candidate and Wilson’s first secretary of state, whose intent was to uphold the Genesis creation myth and the sanctity of the Bible.The trial generated extensive newspaper coverage, with the caustic journalist H. L. Mencken on the spot to denounce Bryan’s supporters as bigots.The jury found Scopes guilty. Despite the theatrics surrounding the trial, it highlighted the confrontation between science and religion. Science, perhaps most notably the relatively new discipline of psychology, enjoyed a major vogue during the twenties. Sigmund Freud’s theories on human sexuality contributed to changes in child-rearing techniques and sexual mores. J. B.Watson’s behaviorist concepts emphasized the role of environmental\n\n14\n\nThe Great Depression\n\ninfluences in the development of personality. Carl Jung propounded theories of personality types, such as extroverts and introverts. In short, psychology inspired intense interest in behavioral and personality analysis.The cosmos itself also assumed new contours as the theories of Albert Einstein, who achieved worldwide renown with verification of his theory of relativity in 1919 and the award of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921, revolutionized concepts of time, light, mass, and energy. Americans Robert Milliken and Arthur Compton won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1923 and 1927, respectively, enhancing the stature of scientific inquiry in the United States, where the sciences enjoyed increased emphasis in the curricula of colleges and universities, and student enrollments nearly doubled during the decade.The general high regard for scientific knowledge and method of course had some impact on traditional religious beliefs. Still, re l i gion continued as a major influence in American life, one that in many ways curiously mirrored the business climate of the 1920s. Fundamentalist denominations gained adherents during the decade, and the mill i o n a i re evangelist Billy Sunday retained his huge following. From his pulpit in the Tabernacle in Indianapolis or at rev ivals at Winona Lake and in major cities, he railed against socialists, immigrants, dancing, the “ n ew woman,” and other presumed threats to the stability of American society. In Los Angeles evangelism’s promoter was Aimee Semple McPherson, who forged a national audience through radio broadcasts (on her own station) from her Angelus Temple, w h e re in 1926 she founded the International Church of the Fo u rs q u a re Gospel. In that same year she created a sensation by disappearing for more than a month. When she re a p p e a re d , she claimed she had been kidnapped, when actually she had been on an extended tryst with her married lover, but her flock never knew for sure and never lost faith in her leadership and healing. McPherson also created a business empire and a sizable fortune by presenting re l i gion as Hollywood spectacle. Perhaps the greatest evangelist of the time, however, was the man who made a religion of bu s i n e s s . That man was advertising entre p reneur Bruce Barton, whose re i n t e rpretation of Christ’s ministry, The Man Nobody Knows, was the bestselling nonfiction work in the nation in both 1925 and 1926. Ascribing to Jesus such qualities as “the will to success,” Barton touted Jesus as “the founder of modern bu s i n e s s .” No wonder the twenties reaped such exceptional prosperity. Americans’ fascination with novel or exotic fads and diversions also materialized in the twenties. Mah-jongg, a Chinese game played with engr aved tiles and adapted for Western use, was extremely popular, for example. People avidly followed reports on explorations of the chambers of Tutankhamen’s tomb in the years following announcement of the tomb’s discovery published in December 1922. In 1925 newspaper attention transformed the entrapment of Floyd Collins in a Kentucky cave into an ongoing headline story. It was perhaps the new s p a p e rs that set the tone for people’s preoccupations.This was the period in which chains such as Scripps-Howa rd and Hearst gained control of papers in cities throughout the country and could there by channel feature s , comics, editorials, and stories of their choice to a national readership—an inducement towa rd nationally shared tastes, interests, amusements, and preoccupations.\n\nPrelude to Crisis 15\n\nThe frothy context of the 1920s—profound disillusionment with concepts of valor, honor, and service following the war; a fringe area of radical politics; strikes, racial conflicts, political and business scandals; Prohibition, bootlegging, organized crime; the huge popularity of cars, radios, movies, and the new values they entailed; the emergence of giant corporations and entirely new industries—supposedly caused a revolution in Americans’ values, morals, and behavior. Certain changes are readily apparent, of course; others remain arguable. Organized crime, for example, effectively transformed crime into a corporate business, and its major source of revenue, bootlegging, changed American drinking habits: Before Prohibition beer had been the most favored drink; now hard liquor prevailed. There was a clearly significant demographic change: The population grew from 106 million in 1920 to 123 million in 1930 and at the same time became largely urbanized—a dramatic shift from 54 million urban dwellers in 1920 to 69 million in 1930, while the farm population fell from 31.6 million to 30.4 million in the same period. The remaining 23.6 million lived in small towns. City living in itself no doubt suggests differences in values and behavior. Fitzgerald, whose novels perhaps come as close as any fiction can to chronicling the life of this urban milieu, summarized the twenties in one sentence in his posthumously published work The Crack-Up: “It was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire.” In many ways, then, it seemed an age that debauched or denied traditional values in all aspects of American life, not taking either itself or its legacy quite seriously; or at least it was an age perceived by many—both advocates and opponents of change—as a period of rebellion against the prevalent values of the prewar era. This perception of revolutionary change perhaps best suggested itself in the lives of women.\n\nWOMEN’S EMANCIPATION Women had gone to work in traditionally male jobs during the war, but they returned to homemaking afterward. Nevertheless, in the twenties, 2 million women entered the workforce, although mostly in nursing, teaching, clerical, and clerking jobs where their presence had long been accepted. Electricpowered, laborsaving machines—refrigerators, clothes washers, vacuum cleaners—eased the burden of women’s traditional household duties, as did new products such as packaged and frozen foods. Other new products such as sanitary napkins and contraceptive devices—crusader Margaret Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921—provided women greater independence. Women intellectuals embraced Sigmund Freud’s concepts as a rationale for pursuing freer sexual behavior. Changes in women’s fashions also reflected a growing liberalization of behavior, with hemlines rising above the knee and with exposed necks and shoulders. The “flapper” look defied prewar rules of decorum and in some states prodded legislators to introduce bills that would regulate skirt lengths and other features of women’s clothing. Many women now felt comfortable smoking and drinking in public.They styled their hair in short “bobs” and wore makeup—overt rebellion against earlier standards. (Despite Prohibition, it was now chic to drink for both men and women; the\n\n16\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nspeakeasies thrived as the public flouted efforts to enforce Prohibition, ineffectual as they were, and bootlegging became a major industry.) Beauty parlors mushroomed along with spectacular growth in the cosmetics industry, clearly indicating that the “new woman” took a keen interest in her appearance, with whatever sexual or moral overtones that suggested. Not all women joined in the revolution, of course. Some older feminists in fact chastised the young who embraced the “new woman” lifestyle as self-indulgent and indifferent to the struggle for women’s equality. Perhaps the critics were right, as voting rights and greater independence in fact did not translate into increased involvement of women in public life, politics, or even voting.\n\nTHE 1928 ELECTION In August 1927, as election year 1928 approached, Coolidge announced that he would not again seek the pre s i d e n c y, his for the asking. In June the following year the candidacy of the Republican Party fell to Herbert Hoover, a Quaker, a California engineer, a self-made millionaire, a nonpolitician who had never run for elective office but was highly re g a rded by the public for his humanitarianism as head of the American Relief Committee and the United States Food Administration during the war years and for his achievements as secretary of commerce. The Republican convention nominated Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas to be Hoover’s running mate.The Democratic Party also convened in June and nominated A l f red E. Smith, governor of New York, product of the Tammany Hall political machine, Roman Catholic, and a strong foe of Prohibition. His running mate was Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, a strong proponent of Prohibition. Smith’s religion became an issue, costing him many votes among Protestants, and public contentment with prosperity served Hoover.The result was pre d i c t a bl e : Hoover carried 40 states. He reappointed Mellon as secre t a ry of the tre a s u ry; Henry L. Stimson became secre t a ry of state.With prosperity now considered a permanent state, it appeared all Hoover had to do was more of the same—continue the Coolidge legacy. Unfortunately for him and the nation, for the world in fact, that would not prove possibl e.\n\nASIA AND EUROPE While the majority of Americans, including the nation’s leaders, pursued life in the twenties as if they pre f e rred not knowing what was happening abroad, events in Asia and Europe moved slowly but in retrospect almost inexorably towa rd the crises that would erupt in the 1930s. As nationalism flared in China, w h e re wa r l o rds battled among themselves for dominance and the formation of a unified central government seemed a very unlikely prospect, Japan assumed an ever larger ro l e.The naval treaties of the early twenties had p recluded the threat of a naval arms race between Japan and the United States while freeing the Japanese to assume effective control of the Pacific. By the late twenties they we re the dominant influence in Manchuria. In Shanghai and Nanjing (Nanking), the military leader Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) was in control, espousing his intent to unify China. C o m munist leader Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) had united with Chiang in the unification\n\nPrelude to Crisis 17\n\nJoseph Stalin (Office of War Information, Library of Congress)\n\neffort but bro ke with him in 1927 following massacres of Communists by Chiang’s forc e s . In Europe ominous signs of possible traumas to come were ev i d e n t . In Germ a ny the Weimar government had been beleaguered by commu n i s t insurrectionists and paramilitary bands of right-wing radicals since its establishment in 1919. By early 1920 among the right, the National Socialist German Wo r ke rs (Nazi) Party appeared with an obscure yet spirited propagandist named Adolf Hitler as spokesman. By the following summer Hitler had become his party’s leader. In November 1923, trying to take advantage of economic instability resulting from hy p e rinflation, Hitler led an attempted coup (the so-called Beer Hall Putsch) in Munich.When the effort failed,\n\n18\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nhe was tried and imprisoned in 1924 in Landsberg, w h e re he would write Mein Kampf, a bl u e p rint for the future T h i rd Reich. By the end of the year, Hitler was set fre e, his book appeared in print in 1925, and the Nazi Pa rty’s membership grew slowly to the end of the decade. In 1928 the party capt u red only a dozen seats among the Reichstag’s 491, but astute observers sensed something fore b o d i n g . Furtherm o re, by 1928 Joseph Stalin had emerged as sole leader in the USSR, and Benito Mussolini had solidified his power as Fascist dictator of Italy after being granted authority in 1926 to rule by decre e. The players we re in place for the tragic drama to come in Europe and Asia.\n\nPrelude to Crisis 19\n\nCHRONICLE OF EVENTS 1919 January 18: Delegates from 27 nations (there is no delegate from Russia) involved in the war against the Central Powers formally convene in Paris to discuss terms of a peace treaty to conclude the 1914–18 war (World War I). The Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey) have no representation at the conference. The defeated nations will each be presented with a separate treaty, concluded in a suburb of Paris, that contains the final terms for peace and be requested to accept them. January 25: At the Paris Peace Conference, work begins on drafting a covenant for the League of Nations. President Woodrow Wilson of the United States chairs the committee selected to draft the covenant. February 14: Delegates to the Paris Peace Conference complete a draft of the Covenant of the League of Nations. May 7: Representatives of the German government, called to Versailles weeks earlier, receive the treaty containing the final terms for peace resulting from deliberations at the Paris Peace Conference. June 28: German re p re s e n t a t ives at Versailles sign the peace treaty presented to them in May — t h ey have no altern a t ive. Among the many treaty conditions hateful to the Germans is Article 231, which f o rces them to accept sole and total responsibility for causing the war and all the losses resulting from it. July 10: President Wilson presents in person the Treaty of Versailles to the U.S. Senate, in his speech focusing on the League of Nations as a matter of life and death concern to the future of humanity. September 3: Wilson, stung by the criticism of his Senate opponents, leaves Washington, D.C., by railroad to begin a strenuous cross-country speaking tour of 17 states, taking his case for ratifying the peace treaty to the American people in a doomed effort to pressure the Senate. September 11: Senators William Borah and Hiram Johnson begin a speaking tour to voice opposition to American participation in the League of Nations. October 2: Having returned to the White House after his arduous speaking tour,Wilson suffers a stroke, leaving his left arm and leg paralyzed.\n\nOctober 28: Overriding the president’s veto of the previous day, Congress again passes the Volstead Act, a law providing for the enforcement of Prohibition. November 19: Senate Democratic supporters of Wilson, joined by a number of Republicans, defeat a resolution of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge that contains 14 reservations to the Covenant of the League of Nations as a condition for ratification of the peace treaty. 1920 January 2: The Justice Department led by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducts largescale arrests of suspected communists and socialists. About 2,700 suspects are taken into custody by the time the Palmer Raids conclude. January 8: At the Jackson Day dinner in Washington, D.C., the chairman of the Democratic Party reads a message from Wilson criticizing Senate opponents of the Treaty of Versailles and asserting that the majority of the American people favor the treaty.The president makes a plea for a national referendum on the treaty. January 10: The League of Nations begins formal operations in Geneva, Switzerland. January 16: The Volstead Act, empowering the Treasury Department to enforce the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the manufacture, transportation, or sale of intoxicating liquors (0.5 percent alcohol by volume) officially takes effect. February 7: Admiral Alexander Kolchak, leader of White Russian forces (loyal to the czar) supported by the Allies intent on defeating the Bolsheviks, is executed in Siberia. He had failed in military engagements with Soviet armies in his march toward Moscow and had fled to Siberia, hoping to find safety among the Allied forces there, but was betrayed by the Czech Legion that had fought for the Allies and was turned over to the Bolsheviks. February 9: The Senate votes to reconsider the Treaty of Versailles and refers it back to the Foreign Relations Committee. February 10: The Foreign Relations Committee presents to the Senate the committee’s report on the Treaty of Versailles, still containing the 14 reservations of Senator Lodge regarding the League of Nations, which he and other opponents see as a threat to American independence.\n\n20\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nF e b r u a ry 13: At Wilson’s request, Secretary of State Robert Lansing, who had disagreed with the president on policies at the Paris Peace Conference and on details of the League of Nations Covenant but had advocated ratification of the treaty by the Senate, resigns his position. Since Wilson’s stroke Lansing has directed foreign policy and presided at cabinet meetings. March 13: After President Friedrich Ebert and other members of the German Republic government flee Berlin for Dresden, rightist dissidents led by Wolfgang Kapp seize the Chancellory. March 17: When military support fails to materialize, the Kapp Putsch collapses, and Kapp flees to Sweden.The Ebert government is restored, apparently assuring survival of the Weimar Republic, but the attempted coup arouses the government’s suspicions of the military. March 19: The Senate votes 49-35 in favor of ratifying the Treaty of Versailles with the Lodge reservations, falling short of the needed two-thirds vote.Thus both the treaty and the reservations opposed by Wilson fail to win approval.Technically the United States remains at war with Germany. April 1: American troops, sent to Russia as part of the Allied effort to defeat the Bolsheviks, withdraw from Siberia. April 4: General Anton Denikin, commander of the White Russian forces on the southern front, who had driven within 80 miles of Moscow before being routed by Bolshevik counterattacks, turns over the remnants of his command to General Baron Peter Wrangel in the Crimea and leaves for sanctuary in the United States. April 15: In South Braintree, Massachusetts, robbers steal the payroll of a shoe factory and kill the paymaster and his guard. May 5: New York City police arrest anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti and charge them with the April 15 South Braintree robbery and murder. They will be sent to Dedham, Massachusetts, for trial. May 8: The Socialist Party of America nominates Eugene V. Debs, currently in federal prison after being convicted of violating the 1918 Espionage Act, as the party’s presidential candidate. May 20: In a joint resolution of both houses, Congress declares an end to the war with Germany. An angry Wilson vetoes the resolution—a veto Congress fails to override.\n\nJune 8: The Republican Party Convention meets in Chicago and nominates Senator Warren G. Harding as presidential candidate; Governor Calvin Coolidge is his running mate. June 25: The International Court of Justice is established at The Hague, Netherlands. June 28: The Democratic Party Convention meets in San Francisco and nominates Governor James M. Cox as presidential candidate; Franklin Delano Roosevelt is his running mate. July 2: In a joint resolution, Congress declares war with Germany and Austria-Hungary at an end, reserving all rights secured for the United States by war, armistice, and treaty.Wilson refuses to approve or sign the resolution. August 26: The Tennessee legislature approves the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, securing its ratification and granting women the right to vote in national elections. November 2: Harding defeats Cox in the national election, winning the presidency. November 30: General Wrangel has admitted defeat in the Crimea, and with the help of the French fleet, 150,000 White Russians—both civilians and military—have left for Constantinople (now Istanbul) and permanent exile.The Bolsheviks are in control of Russia. December 2: Wilson and Leon Bourgeois, French member of the committee that drafted the Covenant of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference, are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1919. December 23: The Better Government of Ireland Act proposed by British prime minister David Lloyd George is approved by the British Parliament; the law divides Ireland into the Irish Free State, with its own parliament, and Ulster, the six Protestant counties that become part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.This division is unacceptable to Eamon De Valera, leader of the radical wing of the Sinn Fein independence movement, resulting in continuing civil war in Ireland. 1921 March 4: Warren G. Harding is inaugurated as president of the United States. April 20: With the support of President Harding, the Senate overwhelmingly (69-19) ratifies the Thompson-Urrutia Treaty by which the United States makes amends to Colombia for instigating the\n\nPrelude to Crisis 21\n\n1903 revolution in Panama to gain control over the isthmus—in effect apologizing for the action and paying Colombia $25 million as reparations in exchange for concessions granting U.S. companies opportunity to invest in Colombian oil fields. May 19: With Harding’s signature, the Emergency Quota Act becomes law. It restricts the number of aliens of each nationality admitted to the country during a fiscal year to 3 percent of the number of foreign-born residents of that nationality based on the 1910 census. May 27: Harding signs the Emergency Tariff Act, imposing enormously high tariffs on 28 agricultural items. June 10: Harding signs the Budget and Accounting Act creating two offices: the director of the budget to help the president prepare annual budgets and the comptroller general to audit all government accounts. The act gives the president authority to appoint both officials. June 21: Harding appoints Charles Gates Dawes as first director of the budget. July 14: At the conclusion of the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, the jury finds the defendants guilty of murder. November 12: Postponed by one day so that delegates could attend entombment of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery on November 11 (Armistice Day), the Washington Conference convenes to negotiate international arms limitations— representatives of the major European nations (except for Russia, which was not invited), China, and Japan attend. 1922 February 6: Delegates from the United States, Great Britain, France, and Japan at the Washington Conference sign a separate Four-Power Pact that recognizes the rights of the four nations in their island holdings in the Pacific Ocean and commits them to consulting on any controversies occurring in the Pacific. Also signed is the Five-Power Treaty, in which Italy joins the four nations already mentioned in agreeing to cease building battleships for 10 years and to reduce their fleets by fixed ratios and total tonnage (one article also commits the United States, Great Britain, and Japan not to build new fortifications or naval bases in the Pacific); and the Nine-Power Treaty, which recognizes China’s independence and supports the Open\n\nDoor policy but leaves virtually unchanged any concessions Japan and other nations enjoyed in China. The conference ends. April 1: About 500,000 bituminous coal miners, led by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) and its president, John L. Lewis, go on strike after mine operators refuse to renew existing contracts and propose drastic wage cuts. April 7: Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall secretly leases oil reserves at Tea Pot Dome in Wyoming to Harry F. Sinclair, representative of the Canada-based Continental Trading Company. April 25: Fall secretly leases oil reserves at Elk Hills in California to Edward L. Doheny of the Pan American Petroleum Company. June 30: Secretary of the Interior Fall is indicted for bribery and conspiracy. July 1: Railway shopmen, threatened with decreased wages, go on strike, but members of the four major railway brotherhoods do not join them. September 1: Attorney General Harry Daugherty secures a federal court injunction effectively making the railway shopmen’s strike illegal and bringing it to an end. September 19: Harding, a consistent opponent of granting a bonus to veterans for their services during the war, vetoes a bill passed by Congress that would have granted certificates for bonuses that could be redeemed immediately or held for 20 years. September 21: Harding signs the FordneyMcCumber Act, which establishes the highest tariffs on imports in the nation’s history to this time. October 30: Menaced by the “March on Rome” of Benito Mussolini’s fascisti (organized in March 1919 and having grown to 300,000 strong) and by the Italian army’s incapacity to resist, King Victor Emmanuel has summoned Mussolini from Milan to assume the premiership and form a cabinet and a new government; the leader of the Fascists arrives triumphant in Rome. November 7: Archaeologist Howard Carter reaches the sealed entrance to the tomb of Tutankhamen in Egypt. December 30: Delegates to the Tenth Congress of Soviets, which becomes the First Congress of Soviets of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, ratify a treaty of union proposed by Stalin, officially creating the USSR.\n\n22\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nBenito Mussolini (Library of Congress)\n\n1923 January: On orders from President Raymond Poincaré, disgruntled because an economically blighted Germany has repeatedly failed to deliver on reparations payments to the Allies, French troops occupy the Ruhr region, supplier of four-fifths of Germany’s coal and steel, thus further crippling the German economy. March 25: The fifth Pan-American Conference meets in Santiago, Chile, to draft a treaty specifying that any controversy between American nations that is not resolved through diplomacy or arbitration will be submitted to a commission for settlement before military force is used. April 9: The Supreme Court, in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, decides that a District of Columbia law limiting the workweek for women to 10 hours is unconstitutional.\n\nJune 20: Concerned about revelations of wrongdoing by members of his administration and the apparently declining popularity of his presidency, Harding sets out from Washington, D.C., with government officials and his wife on a nationwide speech-making tour to mend fences. August 2: Harding, who has become ill on his speech-making trip in the West, dies during the night in his San Francisco hotel room, apparently as a result of a burst blood vessel in his brain. August 3: Shortly before 3:00 A.M., Calvin Coolidge is sworn in as president by his father, a notary, at the family’s home in Plymouth Notch,Vermont. August 31: In the so-called Bucareli agreements, President Álvaro Obregón of Mexico commits his government not to expropriate subsoil holdings owned and developed by foreign firms prior to 1917—a boon to U.S. oil companies. September 26: German chancellor Gustav Stresemann proclaims the ending of passive resistance efforts against the French in the Ruhr and plans to resume making reparations payments to the Allies. October 22: German anger over French occupation of the Ruhr has led to riots; separatists seize public buildings at Aix-la-Chapelle and declare a Rhineland Republic, independent of both France and Germany. November 8: Troops of the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler (head of the party since July 1921) and General Erich Ludendorf (commander of the German armies during the war), stage the so-called Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. November 9: The Beer Hall Putsch fails under police and military resistance; Ludendorf is arrested; Hitler, Hermann Goering, and other leading Nazis, some wounded, flee. December 4: Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and representatives of the five Central American republics meet in Washington, D.C., in a conference intended to draft treaties to maintain the peace in Central America. December 15: Coolidge announces appointment of Charles G. Dawes and two other members to a special committee of the Reparations Commission to devise a plan for curtailing inflation in Germany so that the German government can achieve solvency and begin paying reparations. In January, when the French seized control of the Ruhr, the German mark fell to a value\n\nPrelude to Crisis 23\n\nof 18,000 to the dollar; by August, to 1 million; by November, to 4 billion—generating economic chaos and the total collapse of Germans’ faith in their nation’s economy. 1924 January 16: The McNary-Haugen Bill, intended to achieve “parity” in the prices of agricultural commodities, is introduced in both houses of Congress. It would create an Agricultural Export Corporation authorized to buy commodities in the U.S. markets. The corporation would set the prices of the U.S. commodities much higher relative to foreign commodities and sell them abroad for whatever prices they could bring—farmers would pay a tax to cover at least part of the differences in prices. January 21: Vladimir Lenin, leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and of the Russian government, dies in Moscow. A struggle immediately begins between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky to inherit Lenin’s position of leadership of the Communist Party and the nation. January 22: With the support of the Liberal Party, headed by H. H. Asquith, Ramsay MacDonald, head of the Labour Party, becomes both prime minister and foreign secretary of Great Britain, succeeding the Conservative Party’s Stanley Baldwin, who had been prime minister only since May 22. MacDonald is the first Labour prime minister in history. February 3: Former president Woodrow Wilson dies in Washington, D.C. February 26: The treason trial of Hitler and other leaders of the Beer Hall Putsch begins in Munich. April 1: The defendants in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch are sentenced to prison. In defending himself through the trial, however, Hitler has won adherents and received worldwide newspaper coverage. April 9: The committee of the Reparations Commission proposes the Dawes Plan, named for Charles Dawes, which provides for a $200 million international loan to Germany, creation of a new German currency, and a series of graduated reparations payments by Germany. May 19: Overriding Coolidge’s veto, Congress again passes the Adjusted Compensation Act, which provides insurance policies to veterans against which they can borrow money (up to one-fourth of the policies’ face value).\n\nMay 26: Coolidge signs into law the Immigration Act of 1924, which establishes the principle of “national origins” rather than census data as the basis for restricting immigration, effective in 1927—until then quotas will be reduced to 2 percent and based on the 1890 census.The intent is to reduce immigration from eastern and southern European nations. June 3: The McNary-Haugen Bill suffers defeat in the House of Representatives. June 10: Meeting in Cleveland, the Republican National Convention nominates Coolidge for the presidency, with Charles G. Dawes as his running mate. July 4: In Cleveland the Committee for Progressive Political Action (CPPA) nominates Robert M. La Follette as its candidate for the presidency. July 7: The Democratic National Convention, ending a tumultuous meeting in New York, nominates John W. Davis for president and Nebraska governor Charles W. Bryan, brother of William Jennings Bryan, for vice president. July 11: The Communist Party nominates William Z. Foster as U.S. presidential candidate. The Socialist Party and other left-wing groups support La Follette, who will not accept Communist support. September 1: The Dawes Plan, accepted by both Germany and the Allies, goes into effect. N o vember 4: Coolidge defeats both Davis and La Fo l l e t t e, polling more votes than both of his major opponents combined. His sweeping victory is reflected in the large Republican majorities gained in both houses. The Senate has 56 Republ i c a n s , 39 Democrats and one Farmer-Laborite; the House has 247 Republ i c a n s , 183 Democrats, two Socialists, and two Farmer-Laborites. In Great Britain Stanley Baldwin again becomes prime minister, as MacDonald resigns following loss of the Labour majority in Parliament. December 20: Hitler is released from Landsberg Prison. 1925 January 30: An obscure young man named Floyd Collins begins exploring an underground passage in Sand Cave, five miles from Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, in hopes of discovering an attraction to draw tourists; a huge rock loosed by a cave-in pins his foot, and he lies trapped about 125 feet from an opening to the surface.\n\n24\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nFebruary 4: Charles Forbes, who was head of the Veterans Bureau until Harding (who had appointed him) asked him to resign in 1923, is indicted for fraud, conspiracy, and bribery. February 16: After two weeks of hoopla initiated by a reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal through a series of interviews with Floyd Collins that attracted hundreds of onlookers to Sand Cave, the trapped cave explorer dies. April 27: Following the death of Friedrich Ebert, Field Marshall Paul von Hindenburg, co-commander of the German armies during the war, wins election as president of the Weimar Republic. June 18: Robert M. La Follette dies. July 10: The trial of John T. Scopes on charges of illegally teaching the theory of evolution begins in Dayton, Tennessee. He is defended by Clarence Darrow, representing the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); William Jennings Bryan takes part as the prosecutor and defender of the Bible. July 21: The Scopes trial, referred to as the “monkey trial” because of its focus on the theory of evolution, comes to an end. The jury finds Scopes guilty, and the judge fines him $100. July 26: William Jennings Bryan dies in Dayton, Tennessee. December 1: Representatives of the European nations meeting in Locarno, Switzerland, sign several agreements—referred to as a whole as the Locarno Treaty—intended to ensure peace. A pact among Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany provides a guaranty for Germany’s western boundary and for the demilitarization of the Rhineland. Another pact among France, Belgium, and Germany commits the signatories never to attack, invade, or begin a war with each other except with approval of the League of Nations or for some terrible transgression. Germany also agrees to arbitration treaties with all of her neighbors. 1926 January 27: The Senate votes 76-17 in favor of United States membership in the World Court, but with a series of five reservations (one by the Senate even curtailing the court’s right to provide advisory opinions) concerning the court’s authority that foredoom American participation. May 9: Lieutenant Commander Richard E. Byrd of the U.S. Navy, accompanied by Floyd G. Bennett,\n\nflies from Spitsbergen, Norway, over the North Pole and back in 16 hours. May 18: Evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson disappears; newspapers headline speculations of her drowning since she had been seen swimming in the ocean; 15,000 of her followers gather for a vigil at her Bible school in Los Angeles. June 23: Aimee Semple McPherson reappears, walking out of the desert near Douglas, Arizona. She contends she was kidnapped and confined in a cabin, from which she escaped. Her story cannot be corroborated. July 30: Mexican president Plutarco Elias Calles’s government has decreed the nationalization of church property, prohibited religious teaching in private primary schools, expelled foreign nuns and clergy, and limited the numbers of practicing priests in each state. Now, in retaliation, the Roman Catholic hierarchy issues an interdict that places lay groups in charge of caring for churches and limits the rites clergy may perform in public. August 6: Gertrude Ederle, a 19-year-old swimmer from NewYork City, swims the English Channel, becoming the first woman in history to do so.

Prices of both land buildings had skyrocketed during the seven years following the war, driven up in many cases by unscrupulous speculators; Miami’s population had grown from 30,000 in 1920 to 75,000 in 1925 as a result of the boom.

Congress fails to override the veto. April: Coolidge taps Henry L.
