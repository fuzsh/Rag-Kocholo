        "text": "< SHIVERS FAMILY CHRONICLES AND CONNECTIONS: A Workbook Compiled By Thom Montgomery, PhD. Pittsburgh, PA 1995\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nAmong the most quietly distinguished families in Great Britain, Ireland, Europe and the United States is the House of Chevers.\n\nAs a recognized family, the name Chevers first appears about the year 1000 AD, and was firmly established by the time of William the Conqueror, and is derived from the Latin CAPRA.\n\nA Guillaume La Chievre, reportedly the son of Roger La Chievre, is listed on the roll of companions of William the Conqueror at Falaise, Normandy, France, and is the founder of the House of Chevers in England and Ireland. Guillaume held lands in Normandy through 1070 and had 47 lordships in barony in England listed in the Domesday book. His origins appear to have been in La Maniche.\n\nThe book LES VIEUX NOMS DE LA FRANCE L'OUEST ET LES FAMILLES D'ORIGINE FRANCAISE AU DELA DES MERS (M.L. d'Armagnac del Cer, Comte de Puymege; \"La Vielle France\" 12 Rue Caumartin, Paris) states that in France \"The old and noble house of Chivre, originating from Anjou,\" was in place as early as 1075. In addition, this work cites the fact that many of the family died on the field of battle in and for France, beginning in 1096.\n\nA descendant of this branch, Francoise Marguerite de Chivre, was a niece of Cardinal Richelieu, and married Antoine de Gramont, duc de Gramont. Their daughter, Catherine Charlotte, married Louis I, Sovereign Prince of Monaco, from whom Prince Rainier descends. There is some indication that members of this family migrated to Scotland in the 15th Century forming the House of Chivas, but that is not confirmed and is contested.\n\nThe American branch with which we deal had its origins in Virginia in 1654, spreading to Maryland and New Jersey by the 1690s, and from those states (colonies, then) to the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere by the 1700s.\n\nEnglish, French and American Chever families boast many outstanding figures, and the families are allied with most of England's, Europe's and America's leading families, from Hugh Capet, King of France, to the royalty of England from Saxon times to the present, and including Revolutionary figures in the U.S. such as John Eager Howard, as well as the Todd family, founders of Annapolis.\n\nThere is, as yet, no definitive book on the American branch of this family, although in the 1940s a Marcus Shivers made a strong effort, completing much research at a time when few resources were available, and no computerization: modern technologies and fifty years of the research of others have provided much additional information since Marcus Shivers' first attempts to catalogue this family, bringing us closer to his dream of completing the family genealogy.\n\nWe know, for example, through a non-cupative (verbal) will that the founder of the family, Thomas Chevers, arrived in Virginia aboard the ship RICHARD AND BENJAMIN (Capt. John Whittey commanding), and through a variety of other sources, including correspondence with the current head of the House of Chevers, we know that he was the second son of a second son, driven to make his own fortune by circumstance of birth and the sharp edge of the politics of the day. This was an item not located by Marcus Shivers, being buried in the archives of Lancaster County, Virginia, but uncovered through others' research since then.\n\nA charming story of a pair of gourds for gunpowder matched by parting brothers applies to John and William Shivers, younger sons of progenitor Thomas Chevers, as they separated in Virginia (where William remained) and John left for Maryland and eventually New Jersey, where he finally settled.\n\nFor the purposes of this initial study, we are limiting ourselves to the line of Chevers (in England and Ireland) and the line of Shivers which went from Virginia to Maryland. Later versions may trace the New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia and North/South Carolina branches as they spread through the United States.\n\nSince early generations may be found in Burke's Peerage, those generations of Chevers in England and Ireland will be listed here in lineal descent with brief biographical notes and some anecdotal material. The same will necessarily be true of the early U.S. members, since research is continuing and many proofs are not yet in. Full stories will be revealed in later editions - when more is known and proven.\n\nFor now, we begin with Guillaume Chievre, Normandy at a time when Haley's comet spread wonder through Europe and William, Duke of Normandy, conquered England.\n\nGENERATION I\n\n1. William Chever fl. 1066\n\nThe Chateau of William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, can still be seen in Falaise, Normandy. Undoubtedly, William Chever, walked in its halls.\n\nWilliam's father is reported to be Roger Chever (to anglicize the French/Latin family name), and his mother Petronilla. While this is not proven, there was a Rodger Chievre in La Maniche with a wife Petronilla and a son William, mentioned in a list of grants to the Abbey of St. Mary du Val, Bayeaux.\n\nWilliam had two brothers - Raul de Pomerai and Hugue de Pomerai - and a sister, Beatrix. In addition, he had a brother or cousin, Aegidio de Chivre d'Anjou from whom the French House of Chievre descends, connected to the houses of Grimaldi, Gramont and Hainault.\n\nListed on the roll at Falaise, William also appears in the Domesday Book as holding 47 lordships in barony in Devon along with two houses in Exeter.\n\nAn undertenant of his was Anschitillus.\n\nHe had a son William.\n\n2. Raul de Pomerai fl. 1086.\n\nFounder of Britain's noble house of Pomeroy, with a manse that remained in the family over 500 years. 3. Hugue de Pomerai fl.1086\n\nExisted.\n\n4. Beatrix Chever\n\nBecame Abbess of St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, a replica of Mont St. Michel.\n\nGENERATION II\n\nWilliam Chever fl. 1096\n\nWilliam fathered a son, Gosfred, and a daughter Sibylla.\n\nTogether with his son, he was probably the William Capra of William and Gosfred Capra who witnessed a charter at Montacute.\n\nGENERATION III\n\n1. Gosfred Chever fl. 1100\n\nGosfred, with his father, was a witness to a charter at Montacute, Somerset, in 1100.\n\nHe was father to William and Captain Rufus Chevers\n\n2. Sibylla\n\nMarried Robert Cuilly, Prince of Tarragona (Spain), who achieved his title by working to help rebuild the Spanish city of Tarragona.\n\nRobert was the son of Hugh Cuilly, of the Norman family of Bourdet, who were present in Anjou in 1050.\n\nRobert, \"undertaking to rebuild the city of Tarragona in Spain, obtained the suzerainty with rank of prince of Tarragona.\" At the battle of Fraga in 1133, at the head of his Norman cavalry, he rescued Alfonso, king of Aragon and his army from destruction by the Saracens.\n\nGENERATION IV\n\n1. William Chever fl. 1172\n\nSir William Chever was the founder of the Irish house, having accompanied William Strongbow in the conquest of Ireland in 1172. He received a knight's fee of land in Wexford, and was titled Sir William Chevers. His descendant married Strongbow's.\n\nHe was a witness to the foundation charter of the famous Tintern Abbey of that county.\n\nHe had known children Nicholas and Hamon.\n\n2. Rufus Chevers fl. 1172\n\nStyled Captain Rufus Chevers.\n\nGENERATION V\n\n1. Nicholas Chever, fl. 1247\n\nMarried Sibilla, daughter of the Lord of Rathgulby.\n\nChildren known: David; William; Patrick.\n\n2. Hamon Chever fl. 1210\n\nKnown as Hamon of Chevers Manor, Norfolk.\n\nGENERATION VI\n\n1. David Chevers, fl. 1281\n\nMust have died without issue prior to his father.\n\n2. William Chevers\n\nHad sons Heyn, who continued the Chevers line in British and Irish history, and Richard.\n\n3. Patrick Chevers fl. 1307\n\nWas strongly allied with the Earl of Pembroke, and was a witness to that Lord's charter of Wexford. In addition, Patrick held a knight's fee of land through the Earl of Pembroke, in Ballyhealy, County Wexford.\n\nGENERATION VII\n\n1. Heyn Chever fl. 1355\n\nHad a son John.\n\n2. Richard Chevers fl 1356\n\nGENERATION VIII\n\n1. John Chevers fl. 1405\n\nLived in Ballyhealy, and was Justice of the Peace for Wexford and Waterford, and Grand Seneschal for Wexford in 1416.\n\nKnown children: William and John.\n\nGENERATION IX\n\n1. William Chevers fl. 1425\n\nProperties in Ballyhealy, Ballyclemhay and Ballycullen, County Wexford, Ireland, receiving confirmation from the crown of these manors in 1425, and was appointed 2nd Justice of the Court of Common Pleas on the 24th of March in the 13th year of Henry VI.\n\nHad known children: Walter Chevers.\n\n2. John Chevers fl. 1459\n\nWas Keeper of the Rolls in 1459 and had a grant of a Royal manor of Esker, County Dublin.\n\nGENERATION X\n\n1. Walter Chevers fl. 1483\n\nHeld properties in Ballyhealy, County Wexford and Macetown, County Meath, Ireland, and was listed Chief of his name according to a funeral entry.\n\nMarried Ellen, daughter of Sir William Wells, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, tying the Chevers to many well-placed barons of the Magna Carta.\n\nKnown children: Nicholas; Margaret.\n\nGENERATION XI\n\n1. Nicholas Chevers fl. 1490\n\nProperties in Ballyhealy and Macetown.\n\nMarried Allison, daughter of Robert FitzSimon and sister of Walter FitzSimon, Archbishop of Dublin. Allison married as her second husband (and his 3rd wife) Baron Howth, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and married 3rdly ________ Plunkett of Loughcrew. (For more on the FitzSimon family, see appendices.)\n\nChildren: Walter; Joan.\n\n2. Margaret Chevers d. 20 September 1514.\n\nMarried Bartholomew Aylmer of Lyons, County Kildare.\n\nGENERATION XII\n\n1. Walter Chevers\n\nHad properties in Macetown, County Meath.\n\nMarried Eleanor St. Lawrence, daughter of the 3rd Baron Howth, Lord Chancellor of Ireland (making his mother his step-mother-in-law). Through this family, are formed ties to Edward III of England, thusly: Eleanor's grandmother was the Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, son of John, himself the son of John of Gaunt, the son of King Edward III. This ties the Chevers lineage to virtually every royal family in the world, certainly every royal family currently ruling. Howth Castle still stands, across the bay from Dublin.\n\nChildren: Christopher; John; Thomas\n\n2. Joan Chevers\n\nMarried William Hore of Harperstown, County Wexford.\n\nGENERATION XIII\n\n1. Christopher Chevers fl. 1579 d. 20 March 1581.\n\nProperties in Ballyhealy and Ballycullen, County Wexford. Knighted in 1566, he was Commissioner for Muster in County Wexford in 1579, and acquired the Lordship of Tartaya in County Meath.\n\nHe married as his first wife, Maud, the daughter of Alderman Walter Kelly of Dublin, and, as his second wife, the Lady Anne Plunkett who brought him estates in Macetown, County Meath, Rathmore, County Wicklow, along with large estates in Counties Kildare and Carlow.\n\nA brief study of the Chevers family written by Dr. Beryl F.B. Moore in her history of County Meath in 1977, states:\n\n\"This Christopher Chevers is said to have been knighted in Drogheda in the early part of the year 1581. He was buried in the little church of Macetown erected by himself, likely in the vault underneath the chancel....The Chevers family...lived in Normandy France before 11th Century and were a mountainy people and had for their crest 3 mountain goats...as the French word for 'goat' is 'Chevre' they bore the name of Chevers. They were amongst the first families to join William the Conqueror...they asked for mountainy land and got 'the backbone of England' and called it the Cheviot Hills. They are said to have brought over from France their French home sheep and goats, the former still being called Cheviot sheep...This family also gave the English language the expression 'Chevy Chase' which refers to the famous hunt they started over the Cheviot Hills. 'Chevy Chase' is said to mean 'noisy hunt.'... Sir Christopher was a member of this senior branch and a widower and came up to County Meath to marry as his second wife the young Lady Anne Plunkett who had no sisters or brothers or paternal uncles alive and was sole heiress of Macetown Castle and all the land around it...A direct descendant of his was Augustine Chevers born about 1686 in Galway who was educated on the Continent from the age of 14 years and became Bishop of Meath in 1756...MACETOWN CASTLE...At the present day only a small high piece of this old building has survived...a large heap of stones lie scattered about the ground around the ruin...The ruin stands in a small square field by the east side of the road and there is a small, old fashioned ruined gatelodge.\n\nChristopher Chevers emblazoned his wife's coat of arms along with his on a mantel piece stone, which was last seen in 1899.\n\nChildren: By 1) John; Nicholas; Walter; Patrick; Thomas; a daughter; Margaret; Katherine. By 2) Elenor; Ella; Janet; Margaret.\n\n2. John.\n\nNothing known.\n\n3. Thomas.\n\nNothing known.\n\nGENERATION XIV\n\n1. John Chevers b. 1549 d. 30 April 1599\n\nMarried 1) Katherine, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Travers/Trevers of Monkstown, County Dublin. Her grandfather, Sir John Travers, Knt. of Monkstown, had settled his considerable estates, including Carrickbannon and the hamlets of Thomastown and Newton of the Strand, among others, on his granddaughters, thus making Katherine's inheritance an important one. 2) Elinor Segrave\n\nChildren: By 1) Christopher; Henry; Richard; Jennett; Frances; Elinor.\n\n2. Nicholas Chevers\n\nHad land in Donnacarthy, County Meath. Probably the Nicholas Chevers of Macetown renting land from Christopher Dowdall 1 May 1577.\n\nChildren: Katherine, md. William Locke of Colmanstown, County Dublin.\n\n3. Walter Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n4. Patrick Chevers d. 1585\n\nNo more known.\n\n5. Thomas Chevers\n\nBorn c. 1562. Died unmarried. Will dated 1651.\n\n6. Daughter\n\nMarried ___________ Golding. No more known.\n\n7. Margaret Chevers\n\nMarried Robert Kent of Danestown.\n\n8. Katherine Chevers\n\nMarried Patrick Talbot, eldest son of William Talbot of Malahide, Garristown, Louth, Ashe, Castlering, etc. Died 6 Feb. 1620.\n\n9. Elenor Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n10.Ella Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n11.Janet Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n12.Margaret Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\nGENERATION XV\n\n1. Christopher Chevers b. 1580 d. 7 November 1640\n\nHad land in Macetown, County Meath.\n\nGiven the dignity of a barony by King James I, but no patent appears to have followed. Had a grant of the manor and castle of Rathmore, County Kildare, and of the manor, mansion house and castle of Grangeforth, County Carlow on 10 October in the 9th year of King James I, as well as the castle of Haystown and the townlands of Three Castle, and several properties of the attainted James Fitz-Gerald.\n\nMarried: 1) Eleanor Nugent, Dtr. of Christopher, Baron Delvin, and Lady Mary Fitzgerald (dtr. of Earl of Kildare). 2) Jane, daughter of Jerome Bath of Edickstown, Co. Meath.\n\nChildren: By 1) John; Christopher; Garrett; Anthony; Richard; Peter; Mary; Bridget; Anne. By 2) William; Jerome.\n\nSince we will be leaving this branch and moving to the United States for continuation, it might be well to note that of the children above listed, John was banished to Connaught, as was his nephew, Walter, during Cromwell's time, and founded the illustrious Chevers of Killyan clan. It was with the assistance of one of John's descendants, Michael John Joseph Chevers, that some of the information herein contained about this line was verified and specifically the Chevers' U.S. arrival. Among John's children, one son, Richard, fought for Charles I and Charles II, another son, Edward, was made Viscount Mount Leinster and Baron Bano by King James II, having remained loyal to that deposed monarch in the Williamite wars. These titles were never recognized by the successful King William, and Edward died, loyal to his chosen chief, in France.\n\nAlso, among the children above, Jerome is noted for being sheriff of Drogheda in 1671 and a friend of Chief Justice Singleton, the companion of Dean Swift. Jerome's grandson William was killed in action in the American Revolution, a war that on the other side saw service by his kinsmen.\n\n2. Henry Chevers d. 30 June 1640\n\nHead of the junior branch of the Chevers family, had property in Monkstown. Married Catherine, the daughter of Sir Richard Fitzwilliam of Merrion, County Dublin, a sister of the 1st Viscount FitzWilliam.\n\nChildren: Walter; Thomas; Patrick; Margaret.\n\n3. Richard Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n4. Jennett Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n5. Frances Chevers\n\nNo more known.\n\n6. Elinor Chevers d. 1610.\n\nMarried Thomas Luttrell of Luttrellstown, County Down.\n\nAs epilogue to the above Norman/Irish histories, and prologue to the times that resulted in the migration of the Chevers family to Connaught and the colonies, it is noted here that several of the Chevers family in the above and following generations allied with the Royalists in the Cromwellian times and struggles. They were also strongly loyal to the Catholic cause.\n\nIn the reign of Elizabeth I, an Edward Chevers of Wexford, a sailor, was hung, drawn and quartered for his role in assisting catholic priests to escape to the continent, in the Devereaux affair. In the 1620s, a Walter Chevers of Wexford was proposed as Bishop of Ferns.\n\nWhen Cromwellian troops massacred the women of Wexford at the Crosse, seven Franciscans - five priests and two lay persons - were also massacred: Priests John Esmond, Peter and Raymond Stafford, Paul and Richard Sinnott. Lay Persons: Didacus Chevers and Paul Rochford.\n\nThe several lands of John Chevers, Esq. of Macetown were confiscated by the Cromwellian government, as were the lands of his kinsmen, George Chevers, Esq., Arthur Chevers, Walter Chevers, Haymon Chevers, Thomas Chevers and Marcus Chevers. At the start of the Cromwellian troubles, the Chevers family were possessed of considerable lands and manors: seven in County Wexford alone, plus the Macetown and Monkstown properties of the senior and cadet branches. While neither Walter nor Sir John Chevers fought for the king, others in the family did: Among the officers of the royally aligned troops who had seen service prior to 5 June 1649 (who received payment in the restored rule of Charles II for their service to himself and his father, the executed Charles I) were Barnaby, Christopher, John, Richard, Thomas and William Chevers.\n\nGENERATION XVI\n\nCHILDREN OF HENRY CHEVERS AND CATHERINE FITZWILLIAM:\n\n1. Walter Chevers d. 20 December 1678\n\nMarried: Alison, 3rd daughter of 1st Viscount Netterville.\n\nChildren: Six, of whom one, Henry, died an infant and only one, Maria, survived him. In 1678 Maria married John Byrne of Cabinteely, of the distinguished Irish family of O'Byrne, descended from Dumhlan Dubhcluasach, younger brother of Donal na Scath. John and Maria's marriage is recorded in Dublin as occurring or being licensed in Dublin 23 June 1678. Catherine married 1) Harry Barnwall of Kingsland, and 2) Nicholas Harrold. Walter's son Nicholas died of hydrophobia, his son John drowned, and his eldest son, Walter left Bristol for Virginia in August 1661, apprenticed to Richard Homewood, a neighbor to his uncle Thomas, apparently dying prior to 1678 when his sister stood as sole heir to their father.\n\nThe story of Walter Chevers (Sr.) is best told in CHEVERS OF KILLYAN by Frederica Sophia Chevers, privately printed for the family:\n\n\"The Chevers family can claim direct descent from royalty, in fact from Edward I, through the marriage of Walter Chevers of Macetown, Co. Meath, to Eleanor, daughter of the 16th [3rd, actually. Ed.] Baron Howth...In 1641 a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule, broke out, it was speedily subdued, but the unfortunate result of this rising was, that many innocent Irishmen...were made to suffer. George Chevers of Wexford had his lands taken from him...and in 1641 John Chevers of Macetown was attainted and so likewise was Walter Chevers of Monkstown Castle. At the present time, the only part that remains of the original mansion is part of the tower and a small portion of the chapel. Over the doorway of the latter, carved in stone, is a head representing the Blessed Virgin; legend tells that one of the Cromwellian soldiers levelled an insult at the holy statue and was at once smitten with blindness...At the present day a stone cross still stands in the middle of Blackrock village (Co. Dublin) and ...On a certain day every year a representative of the family came to throw a spear over the cross in order to assert their claim to the land as far as where he stood...(O)n December 16th, 1653, Walter Chevers was ordered to proceed to Connaught...and was required to supply the English authorities with a statement of his goods and a description of all who were to accompany him. This document reads as follows: 'Walter Cheevers, of sanguine complexion, brown haire, and indifferent statue; his wife Alison Netterville...otherwise Cheevers, with five children, the eldest not above seven years old; four women servants and seven menservants; viz Daniel Barry...Thady Cullen... Morgan Cullen...blind of one eye...Philip Birne aged about 40 years...William Birne...aged 35 years...Patrick Corbally, aged 40 years...The said Walter doth manure twenty colpe of corn and hath twenty cows, sixty sheep, thirty hoggs, two ploughs of garrans...The transplanted had been promised good lands in Connaught with a substantial house upon them, but this promise was not fulfilled and we find Walter Chevers complaining to the council in a letter dated August 6th, 1656, that the land given him was insufficient and that he was given no residence. His plea, however, was unavailing and so he, with his servants and retainers, laid the foundation of Killyan House in Co. Galway, at first a thatched dwelling. Here also was built one of the first Catholic Chapels in Connaught and to this day the roofless walls of the little church can still be seen...a lasting testimonial through the ages to the faith of the Chevers family, who were offered by Cromwell 'Hell or Connaught' (Hell if they renounced the Catholic religion and kept their possessions, Connaught or banishment if they refused)...Just inside the tiny chapel is a holy water font, hewn out of stone and quite shallow, but no one has seen it completely dry, even in the dryest summer, although there exists no water supply in connection with it...\n\n2. Thomas b. c. 1607, Monkstown, Dublin, Ireland d. February 1663/4 in Surry County, Virginia.\n\nPossibly the Thomas, who, with others of the family, was listed as an officer of the 1649 lot loyal to King Charles I and King Charles II thus losing his lands in the Barony of Bargy, County Wexford, by Cromwellian confiscation.\n\nIn the same month and year that his brother was banished to Connaught, Thomas set sail for the colony of Virginia, in the ship RICHARD AND BENJAMIN, commanded and outfitted by Captain John Whitty. They sailed from London and landed in Lancaster County, Virginia in January, 1654/5. Other passengers included Thomas Chetwood, Robert Osborne, William Moult - and Thomas Crowder, who died and left a non-cupative will witnessed by Thomas Chevers. Crowder's was not the only death on that long voyage: Seth Hayward, Jr., also died. Seth left no will nor witnesses to his intent. Both Hayward's and Crowder's belongings were returned to their heirs by Captain Whitty.\n\nThomas Chevers brought with him at least four children: Thomas, Peternell, Elizabeth and John. His wife appears to have accompanied him, and they had at least one, if not two, more children in the New World.\n\nThomas's son John is the founder of the New Jersey line of Shivers, his son Thomas (Jr.) is the founder of the Maryland line, and William is the founder of the Georgia and Carolina lines.\n\nWhile Thomas's occupation was listed as chirurgeon (surgeon), no record exists of him studying at any of the known medical schools of the day. While an archivist at Trinity College, Dublin, stated that it was likely he studied with a physician rather than in an academic setting, there is no record of Thomas practicing as a surgeon in Virginia. By all accounts, he became a landowner and practiced husbandry.\n\nHe was also engaged with community affairs. He does not appear to have lingered long in Lancaster County. 1658 sees him serving on a grand jury in Isle of Wight County and by 1660, the approximate year his son William was born, he purchased land of one Ralph Creed. It is the purchase of this land that presents us with Thomas Chevers, planter and practitioner of husbandry\n\n\"For and in consideration of two good Young Cowes to be such as shall be chosen by me Ralph Creed out of ye whole stocke of Tho: Chiffers his cattle upon demand as also for ye payment of ffower Thousand pounds of good Tobacco and Corke payable 10th of October next and foure thousand pounds more of like tobacco and Corke to be paid the 20th day of October thence next comeing which shall be in ye year 1660 I the said Ralph Creed have bargained and sold unto Tho: Chiffers...Eleven hundred and odd Acres of Land At ye head of Sunken Marsh neare upper Chippoakes in Surry County...to be held by ye said Tho: Chivers...\"\n\nIt was Thomas's children who eventually settled the spelling of the name into its current form, Shivers.\n\nIt is apparent from the deed quoted above, and from the lack of evidence of surgical practice, that Thomas had come to this country equipped much as his brother Walter had been for Connaught: with family and possibly livestock. Or, he may have used the arrearages for service granted him (after his migration) under Charles II, if collected, to purchase livestock. The intent would have been logical: to start a new life and, as the second son of a second son, to make a better place for self and family.\n\nSome idea of Thomas's way of life in the New World can be gleaned from elements of his will quoted by his son William in various land conveyances. An example is the conveyance of the old Ralph Creed land, the last family homestead, to Benjamin Harrison on 6 October 1691, which mentions that the land is sold with \"houses, orchards, gardens, woods, ways and waters, with free privilege of hunting, hawking, fishing and fowling.\" The phrases well describe the lifestyle of a 17th century landowner. The mention of orchards is especially important, as orchards represented an attempt to diversify from the staple money crop, tobacco. Thomas's grandson, John Shivers of Maryland, in one lease of land was charged with setting out an orchard (1701 lease from John Cross of Anne Arundel County, Maryland).\n\nFollowing the restoration of Charles II to the throne, Thomas's uncle in Ireland applied for and was eventually restored to some of the Chevers land, most particularly, the land at Killyan. Thomas made no effort to return to Ireland. He must have been satisfied with his lot in the new world he was helping to construct. He died, probably, in February 1663/4. His son William later stated that he had received the Ralph Creed land in his father's will dated 8 February 1663/4. The will is missing, but probably provided for all of the children, now scattered: Thomas had gone to Maryland in June 1663 to work for Benjamin Rozer of Charles County. Peternell followed, being in Calvert County as early as 1665, transported by Edward Dorsey. John arrived later, transported by 1675 by Maurice Baker. Peternell has documented contact with the Quakers of Calvert County, and John likely also joined the Society of Friends in Maryland. Fox's preachings and that of many other Quakers were making a considerable stir in the area. Elizabeth remained behind. Past the age of 14, she was able to choose her own guardian. which she did. In the papers filed at various times relating to Elizabeth and her brother William, it is stated that the guardian owed her money to buy a horse.\n\nShe appears to have been caretaker for William, and probably for John. William would have been an infant or no more than four when his father died: William was most likely born about April of 1660, able to choose his own guardian in 1676 and claiming his inheritance in 1681. The date of birth of John Shivers of New Jersey was estimated at 1650: it could easily have been 1652 or 1654, leaving him a minor at his father's death and establishing the basis for the later story of the brothers who parted.\n\n3. Patrick Chevers\n\nOther than the fact he died unmarried, no more is known at this time of this man.\n\n4. Margaret Chevers.\n\nDied without issue"
