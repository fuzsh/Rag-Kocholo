        "text": "F\n\nFaa, Camilla - (1599 - 1662)\n\nItalian courtier and memoirist\n\nCamilla Faa was born at Casale in Montferrato, the daughter of Ardizzino Faa, an ambassador. She was brought to the court where she became the mistress of Duke Ferdinando di Gonzaga of Mantua (1587 - 1626). When she became pregnant the duke married Camilla secretly. However political considerations caused the duke to abandon her in order to make a dynastic marriage with Princess Catherine de Medici of Florence. Camilla was seperated from her son and sent from the court. Her family wished her to be married as was appropriate to her rank, but Camilla wished to enter a convent and live as a laywoman. After resisting the efforts of her family to marry for several years she was permitted to enter the convent of Corpus Christi in Ferrara (1622) where she became a nun of the Clarissan order and remained for the rest of her life. She produced the memoir entitled Storia di donna Camilla Faa di Bruno Gonzaga.\n\nFabbiri, Inez â (1831 â 1909)\n\nAmerican soprano\n\nBorn Agnes Schmidt in Austria, she trained as an operatic performer, and with some considerable vocal talent, she achieved fame in New York (1866) with a well publicized feud with the Italian soprano Adelina Patti. Inez Fabbiri later performed in Canada and during the (1875 â 1876) season both directed and performed in over sixty separate operas. After her retirement from singing, Inez founded a company of German actors in San Francisco, California.\n\nFaber, Cecilia Boehl vonÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Caballero, Fernan\n\nFabia Aconia PaullinaÂ Â Â Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Â Paullina, Fabia Aconia\n\nFabia Ambusta â (fl. 376 BC)\n\nRoman Republican patrician\n\nFabia Ambusta was the elder daughter of Marcus Fabius Ambustus. She was married to the wealthy patrician, Servius Sulpicius, one of the military tribunes (376 BC). Her younger sister, Fabia Ambusta Minor, became the wife of Gaius Licinius Stolo (living 357 BC), who served as tribune of the plebs (376 â 367 BC).\n\nFabia Eudocia â (593 â 612)\n\nByzantine Augusta\n\nFabia Augusta was the daughter of Rogatus, governor of Africa, and became the first wife (610) of the Emperor Heraklius I (575 â 641). She was crowned as Augusta (Oct 7, 610) when she assumed the additional name of Eudocia. Fabia Eudocia was the mother of a daughter, Epiphania Eudocia, who died a nun, and of the future emperor Constantius III (612 â 641). The empress was the matriarch of an Imperial line which ended with Justinian II (711). She died at the Blachernae Palace in Constantinople of an attack of epilepsy, whilst recovering from the strain of childbirth, and was interred in the church of the Holy Apostles. Her funeral was marred by the indiscretion of a servant girl, who unintentionally spat upon the empressâs robes, and she was burned alive on the empressâs tomb for this involuntary insult.\n\nFabiola â (c340 â 399 AD)\n\nRoman Christian philanthropist and pilgrim\n\nFabiola was born into the ancient and illustrious gens of the Fabii, and was a member of the strict religious group that gathered around the saintly Marcella âthe First Nun.â Fabiola performed public penance at the side door of the church if the Lateran in Rome, after the death of her second husband, from whom she had been divorced, the church having not recognized that divorce. She is chiefly remarkable for having drawn from St Jerome the denouncement of double marriage, the earliest utterance of the church on that subject, contained in his fifty-fifth letter.\n\nFabiola then sold her estates and with Pammachius, she founded and organized a public hospital at Ostia (Porto), near Rome, the first such establishment recorded in Europe, participating herself in the day to day nursing of patients and other activities. She then visited Palestine (394 â 395 AD) and stayed with Paula in Bethlehem, where she received instruction from St Jerome. However, the fear of an invasion of Jerusalem by the Huns caused Fabiola to return to Rome, where she established a hospice for Christian travellers and pilgrims, the fame of which reached as far afield as Egypt, Parthia, and Britain. The church honoured her as a saint (Dec 27).\n\nFabres, Lucia â (fl. c1730 â 1761)\n\nFrench dancer\n\nLucia Fabres first performed at Covent Garden, London in 1742, dancing the Old Woman and Air in, The Rape of Proserpine.

Madame Fabricius was the author of the tragedy Heinrich der Vielgeliebte oder die Wurde der Protestanten (1802), and bequeathed a five decade legacy to the University of Kiel in Holstein (1820 â 1868). Anna Fabricius died (March 3, 1820) at Kiel, aged sixty-eight.\n\nFabricius, SaraÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Sandel, Cora\n\nFabris, Eleanora â (1840 â 1910)\n\nItalian contralto vocalist\n\nEleanora Dorodi was born in Italy, the daughter of Camillo Dorodi, the famous baritone under whom she trained.

Eleanora was married to the tenor Cristoforo Fabris, and the couple joined the Lyster Opera Company. In 1876 the couple came to Sydney, Australia with Lysterâs and Eleanora appeared in numerous operatic roles and concerts, being especially noted in the role of Azucena the gypsy in Giuseppe Verdiâs Il Trovatore. Upon her retirement (1890) a benefit concert was held for her at the Sydney Town Hall. Eleanora Fabris died (April 14, 1910) in Sydney, and was interred with her husband in Waverley cemetery.\n\nFabrizzi, Orsola â (fl. c1790 â 1797)Â\n\nItalian vocalist\n\nHer first recorded performance in England was as Lenina in I Traci amanti at Kingâs Theatre, London (Feb, 1796). Her successive roles included Madame Perlina in, La modista riggiatrice and Limpida in, Il tesoro. Her roles during her second season (1796 â 1797) were not as prestigious, despite the fact that her strong, clear voice, and comic performances were admired by contemporaries.\n\nFaccia, Rina PierangeliÂ Â Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Â Aleramo, Sibilla\n\nFaccio, Adele â (1920 â 2007)\n\nItalian politician and organization founder\n\nFaccio was born (Nov 13, 1920) in Pontebba, Udine. She established herself in Italian politics and rose to become deputy of the Partito Radicale (Radical Party). Faccio strongly supported the female right to abortion, and was an equally strong beliver in birth control. These beliefs led to her establishing (1973) the Centro dâInformazione sulla Sterilizzazione e sullâAborto (Information Centre on Sterilisation and Birth Control). Adele Faccio died (Feb 8, 2007) in Rome, aged eighty-six.\n\nFachiri, Adila Adrienne Adalbertina Maria â (1886 â 1962)\n\nHungarian-Anglo violinist\n\nAdila dâAranyi was born in Budapest, the elder sister to Jelly dâAranyi, being the daughters of Taksony Zranyi de Hunyadvar, they being great-nieces of the noted violinist, conductor, and composer, Joseph Joachim (1831 â 1907).

Adila later visited England and settled in London (1913), where she was eventually married to a lawyer and barrister, Alexander Fachiri (1915). Fachiri performed publicly in many duets with her sister, and they gave together the first performance of Concerto for 2 Violins (1930), which had been especially written for them by the composer Gustavus Holst (1874 â 1934). Adila Fachiri died (Dec 15, 1962) in Florence, Italy, aged seventy-six.\n\nFacinolaÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Felicula\n\nâFadetteâÂ Â see Â Â Reeves, Marion Calhoun\n\nFadia â (c80 â c48 BC)\n\nRoman Republican patrician\n\nFadia was the daughter of Quintus Fadius Gallus, a wealthy freedman, and became the first wife (c64 BC) of Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony), the future triumvir and lover of Cleopatra VII. Fadia brought Antony an impressive dowry and bore him several children, who all died in infancy. Divorced c55 BC, there is no record of her having remarried. Her family tree and that of Antonyâs later wife Fulvia were torn to shreds by Cicero, in revenge for an insult sufferred to Octavian (Augustus) from Antony.\n\nFadia of Egypt â (1943 â 2002)\n\nPrincess\n\nFadia was born (Dec 15, 1943) at the Abidin Sarayi, Cairo, the third and youngest daughter of King Farouk I (1936 â 1952) and his first wife, Farida Hanim, and was half-sister to Crown Prince Ahmed Fouad, the son of Queen Narriman. When her father was ousted from power (1952) she accompanied her father to Italy, though she later was sent to a Swiss boarding school (1954) for her education, and where she studied painting and became an accomplished horsewoman. Fadia was later married in London (1965) to the Russian Ã©migrÃ©, Prince Pierre Orlov (born 1938) to whom she bore two sons. He converted to Islam and took the Arabic name of Said. Fluent in several languages such as English, Italian, Spanish, Arabic and French, the princess worked as a translator for the Swiss Ministry of Tourism. She returned to Egypt only once after leaving, in order to attend her motherâs funeral (1988).\n\nTogether with her sisters the princess attempted to legally regain possession of one of the royal palaces and of some land in the Nile Delta region, claiming that the properties had once belonged to Queen Farida. However, the court ruled against the family, on the grounds that Queen Faridaâs divorce (1948) predated the revolution which resulted in the confiscation of all royal properties. Princess Fadia died (Dec 28, 2002) aged fifty-nine, at Pully, near Lausanne, Switzerland. Her body was taken transported back to Egypt for burial beside her father at the Al-Rifaâi Mosque in Cairo.\n\nFadilla, Annia Aurelia â (159 â before 213 AD)\n\nRoman Imperial princess\n\nAnnia Aurelia Fadilla was one of the younger daughters of the emperor Marcus Aurelius and his wife Faustina II, the daughter of emperor Antoninus Pius.

With the help of one of her sisters she uncovered and revealed a palace conspiracy aimed at the removal of her brother (189 AD). She predeceased her sister Cornificia, who was the last surviving child of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nFadrique, Maria â (1370 â 1395)\n\nSpanish heiress\n\nMaria Fadrqiue was the daughter of Louis Fadrique de Aragon, Count of Malta and Gozzo, Lord of Salona, and his wife Helena Asenina Cantacuzena, the daughter of Matthew Cantacuzene, Despot of the Morea, and she inherited the burgraviate of Siderokastron in Greece, and the county of Salona. Maria was engaged to marry four times, firstly to Geoffrey de Rocaberti, then to his brother Bernaduc, thence to Stephen Dukas Nemanjic of Serbia, and lastly Matthew de Moncada. None of these proposed marriages eventuated, and finally, she was given in marriage at Salonika (1395) to the Ottoman sultan of Turkey, Bayazeit I, or, more properly, entered his harem. The union proved short-lived, as Maria died before the end of the same year.\n\nFagan, Agnes Blanche â (1844 â 1928)\n\nAustralian diarist\n\nAgnes Fagan was born into a Catholic family, the daughter of John Thomas Baptist, of Surry Hills, Sydney, New South Wales, and his second wife Emma Phillips.

They resided at Woollahra in Sydney, and were friends of the poet Henry Kendall. Two sons died in infancy, and only their daughter, Erina Fagan Compton (1889 â 1977) survived to adulthood. She was widowed in 1924.\n\nHer diary was an account of a trip to Gosford, and chronicled a three week visit to that NSW town (Sept â Oct, 1885). She revisited in Oct, 1886, and added to her original recollections. Agnes Faganâs papers were organized for publication by her only grandchild, Keith Compton, edited by Philippe Tabuteau, and were published as, Agnes Faganâs Diary 1885 (1991). Agnes Fagan died (March 15, 1928) aged eighty-three.\n\nFagan, Audrey â (1962 â 2007)\n\nIrish-Australian police officer\n\nFagan was born in Ireland, and immigrated to South Australia with her parents as a child (1971). She joined the AFP (Australian Federal Police) at the age of eighteen (1980) and spent all her subsequent career in the force. Fagan had a highly creditable career in policing and was awarded the Australian Police Medal (2004). Soon afterwards she was appointed as assistant commissioner and Chief Police Officer for the ACT (Australian Capital Territory) (2005).\n\nHowever, despite her excellent record, untrue allegations of corruption brought by irresponsible media and the scrutiny of police treatment of detainees in Canberra cells, led to general questioning of her competency. Due to stress of the situation she committed suicide (April 20, 2007) whilst on a trip to Hayman Island in Queensland.\n\nFagan, EleanoraÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Holiday, Billie\n\nFage, Mary â (fl. 1637)\n\nEnglish writer\n\nMary was the wife of a gentleman, Robert Fage, the younger.

Three of her verses in this work were dedicated to the Stuart princesses, Mary, Elizabeth, and Anne, the daughters of Charles I (1625 â 1649) and his wife, Queen Henrietta Maria (Mary). Some believe that the work, considered of mediocre merit, was acutally written by her husband.\n\nFagniani, Constanza Brusati, Marchesa â (1747 â 1805)\n\nItalian dancer, singer and society figure\n\nConstanza Brusati was born (Dec 6, 1747) the daughter of the Marchese Gian Pietro Brusati, and was stepdaughter of Conte Barbaron, the castellan of Milan Castle. She had performed as a dancer and vocalist with the Italian opera before making a suitable marriage (1767) with Giacomo Fagniani (1740 â 1785), fourth Marchese di Gerenzano, of Milan, Lombardy. They are usually referred to by the Fagniani name. With her husband, the marchesa became a member of fashionable society, and both freely indulged in romantic liasions.\n\nThe marchesa became the lover of the English Lord Pembroke, before passing into a liasion with William Douglas, fourth Duke of Queensberry, known famously as âOld Qâ residing with the old roue in his Piccadilly mansion in London. She was the mother of his daughter, Maria Emilia Fagniani (1771 â 1854), known as âMie-mie,âwho later became the wife of the third Marquess of Hertford, though she left the child to be raised by Queensberryâs friend, George Selwyn. Her husband degenerated into insanity, and became blind before he finally died in Milan (1785). The marchesa continued her perapatetic lifestyle as a widow. Her younger daughter, Antonia Fagniani (1778 â 1847) became the wife of Marco Arese Lucini (1770 â 1825), sixth Conte di Barlassina, and left issue.

Maria was adopted and raised by the dukeâs old friend, George Selwyn, who nicknamed her âMie-Mie.â An early infatuation with Richard, Earl of Barrymore, did not last, and she eloped with Francis Charles Seymour-Conway (1777 â 1842), then Earl of Yarmouth, and later third Marquess of Hertford, and was married to him at Southampton, near London, as his second wife.\n\nThough Mariaâs father had heartily approved of the marriage, the Seymour family took some time to come around The couple later resided in Paris for several years. During this time her husband took a mistress, and Lady Yarmouth became the particular friend of the Princesse de Talleyrand. A woman of great beauty, but of a promiscuous nature, the Prince Regent is said to have admired her. Maria returned to London where her son, Lord Henry Seymour was born (1804). Lord Yarmouth accepted the child as his, but he was probably fathered by the French Comte Casimir de Montrond.\n\nWith the Duke of Queensberryâs death (1810), Lord and Lady Yarmouth inherited all his estates and properties for their lives, and after their deaths, to their daughter, Lady Frances Seymour Conway. On top of this Lady Yarmouth received a personal bequest of one hundred thousand pounds. Lady Yarmouth returned to reside in France, where she became involved in a liasion with the Bonapartist General Andoche, and refused an attempt made by her husband to become reconciled (1811). Her daughter, Lady Frances Seymour-Conway (1797 â 1822), the comtesse de Chevigne died, and then her husband succeeded his father as marquess of Hertford (1822 â 1842). Lady Hertford survived her husband as Dowager Marchioness of Hertford (1847 â 1856), but remained resident in Paris. Lady Hertford died there in the Rue Tailebout (March 2, 1856), aged eighty-four, and was interred in Pere Lachaise cemetery, having left her considerable welath divided equally between her two sons, of whom the elder was Richard Seymour-Conway (1800 â 1870), fourth marquess of Hertford (1842 â 1870).\n\nFahey, Myrna â (1933 â 1973)\n\nAmerican television and film actress\n\nBorn (March 12, 1933) in Carmel, Maine, Fahey worked for a year with the Pasadena Playhouse before getting her first break in television with her first appearance was in Cavalcade of America (1954).

Margeurite worked at the Folies Bergere (1912) and also, reputedly, in a brothel, and was said to have married Charles Laurent. A member of the demi-mondaine society at Deauville and Biarritz, she eventually married (1922) the incredibly rich Prince Ali Kemal Fahmy Bey (1900 â 1923) ten years her junior.\n\nIn July, 1923 whilst staying at the Savoy Hotel during a visit to London, she gunned down her husband in the hotel corridor. The case generated great public interest, her defense being conducted by Sir Edward Marshall Hall, and the newspapers referred to her as âThe Tragic Princess.â With the revelation of sexual details concerning her marriage, and her husbandâs marital cruelty, the affair became the most sensational scandal of the decade. Ultimately acquitted, though almost certainly guilty, Margeurite became involved with dubious and unsuccessful schemes to extort money from the relatives of her late husband. Princess Fahmy Bey survived the notoriety of these events by more than fifty years and remained in quiet obscurity. Princess Fahmy Bey died (Jan 2, 1971) aged eighty, at Neuilly, in Paris.\n\nFahrelnissa Zeid â (1901 â 1991)\n\nPrincess of Jordan\n\nFahrelnissa Zeid was born in Istanbul (Constantinople) into a prominent Ottoman family. Artistically talented, she began to paint at a young age (1915), and became one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul, where she studied under Namik Ismail, and then studied abroad in Paris under Roger Bissiere.

She then remarried (1934) to Prince Zeid el-Hussein of Jordan, the brother of King Faisal I of Iraq, for whom the prince served as minister plenipotentiary in Turkey.\n\nThe princess was prominent in the art world during the period of the 1950âs and 1960âs as a talented exponent of the Paris School, and was especially admired for her blend of Islanic and Byzantine art with abstract and other Western influences. She was particularly known for her oil and water colour paintings. One of her larger exhibitions was held at the Hittite Museum in Ankara (1964). Her work was exhibited abroad in New York, Paris and Brussels, and the Royal Cultural Centre in Amman featured a retrospective exhibition of her work (1983).

She was daughter-in-law to the infamous Queen Brunhilda, but the two women appear to have remained on amicable terms, Gregory of Tours recording that the amity that existed between them was unusual enough to provoke comment.\n\nAt Andelot (587) the properties, revenues and cities of Queen Faileuba and her mother-in-law were guaranteed by decree of King Guntram of Burgundy, as was their free disposal of these properties and received incomes. Gregory of Tours recorded that the queen warned her husband when she was apprised of a plot against herself and Brunhilda, one of the conspirators being Septimina, the nurse of her own children.

Her eldest brother was George Augustus Frederick Fitzclarence (1794 â 1842), the first Earl of Munster. Amelia was married (1830) to Lucius Bentinck Cary (1803 â 1884), tenth Viscount Falkland, and was the mother of his heir Lucius William Cary (1831 â 1877). Her son was styled master of Falkland, but he predeceased his father. He had married but died childless and the title passed to an uncle.\n\nWhen her husband was appointed as governor of Bombay in India (1848 â 1853), Lady Falkland accompanied him there. She was intrigued by the life and customs of India, and made several expeditions in the Deccan region. On their return to Britain, the couple visited Egypt and Palestine. Lady Falkland left an account of these travels, which were published in two volumes as, Chow-Chow: Being Selections from a Journal kept in India, Egypt, and Syria (1857). Lady Falkland died (July 2, 1858) aged forty-one.\n\nFalkland, Christina Anton, Lady â (c1775 â 1822)\n\nBritish peeress and literary figure\n\nChristina Anton became the wife (1802) at the Church of St Clement Danes in Middlesex, London of Charles John Cary (1768 â 1809), the ninth Viscount Falkland and she became the Viscountess Falkland (1802 â 1809). She was the mother of Lucius Bentinck Cary (1803 â 1884) who as a child of six succeeded his father as the tenth Viscount Falkland and held the peerage for almost seventy-five years (1809 â 1884).

Falkland had been a friend to the poet Lord George Byron, and after his death, Byron left Lady Falkland five hundred pounds as a gift when he visited home. He secreted the money in a breakfast cup so that it would not be discovered until after he left, despite that fact that he was in debt himself. However Byronâs generous had caused a result that he had not expected. Lady Christina imagined that Byron was in love with her and she became infatuated with him. When she read his work Childe Harold she deluded herelf that all the love passages in it were directed to her as her letter to the poet revealed when she wrote â Tell me, my Byron, if these mournful tender effusions of your heart to that Thyrza â¦ were not intended for myself.â She even believed that the âMaid of Athensâ was âyour own Christina.â\n\nLady Falklandâs infatuation caused Byron some considerable embarrassment, so much so that he eventually handed over her letters to his lawyer, and when Lady Christina was informed that he would neither read nor answer them, her passion did not diminish, and resulted in continued plaintive letters. Lady Falkland died (July 25, 1822) at Vauxhall in London.\n\nFalkland, Elizabeth Tanfield, LadyÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Cary, Elizabeth\n\nFalk-Mehlig, Anna â (1846 â 1928)\n\nGerman pianist\n\nFalk-Mehling was born in Stuttgart, Wurttemburg, and studied at the conservatory there under Franz Liszt.

She sometimesd appeared under married name after she wed (1748) William Donaldson, the son of a linen draper, to whom she bore a son.\n\nLater, apparently with her husbandâs acquiescence, Anna Maria resided with George Montagu (1716 â 1771), second Earl of Halifax, as his acknowledged mistress, and may have acted as governess to his two daughters. He provided her with a house at Hampton Green, where she resided for several years with the two children she bore Halifax. The earlâs patronage and support ended with his death (1771). Over a decade later Donaldson died (1784), and five years later Anna Maria remarried to Colonel Charles Lumm. Nothing is recorded of her life after this date.

Falleni now adopted the identity of âHarry Leo Crawfordâ and worked various low paid or menial jobs as a man without detection.

By the time Falleni was apprehended (1920) he had remarried another unsuspecting âwife.â\n\nFalleni confessed her true sex, was confined in the womenâs prison, and the press and media had a field day with the story.

A member of the Stoic group she was persecuted by the emperor Domitian (93 AD), who ordered her banishment and the confiscation of her property, after Herennius Senecius revealed at his trial that he had written a biography of Helvidius at Fanniaâs request. The senate ordered the books in question to be destroyed, but Fannia managed to save them, and took them with her into exile. Â After Domitianâs assassination, the emperor Nerva rescinded the banishment order and she was permitted to return to Rome, her estates being restored to her.

Fannia had been married to one Titinnius, who divorced her, whereupon she demanded back her large dowry. Titinnius responded by accusing her of adultery, and the case was tried by Marius (100 BC). The historian Plutarch recorded, âIn the course of the proceedings it became clear that Fannia had led a dissolute life, but that her husband had known this when he married her and during the long time that he had lived with her. Marius therefore took a severe view of both of them. He ordered the husband to pay back the dowry, and fined the woman four copper coins as a mark of âdisgrace.â\n\nFanning, Kay â (1927 â 2000)\n\nAmerican editor and journalist\n\nBorn Katherine Woodruff (Oct 18, 1927) in Joliet, Illinois, she attended Smith College.
