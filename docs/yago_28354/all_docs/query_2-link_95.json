        "text": "As promised, I am holding a drawing for a signed hardback copy of Lionheart. Any one who leaves a comment on this blog will be eligible to win. I usually keep the drawing open for two weeks, but this one may run longer as we all get caught up in the holiday hoopla.\n\nFirst, quick updates. I have been assured by my publisher that the Lionheart audio book will be available within the coming week. Here is the link for anyone who’d like to listen to Emily Gray, the woman who’ll be doing the reading. http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/gvpages/a1571.shtml Lionheart will also be available in large print, although I don’t have the date for that yet. It is now available as a trade paperback Down Under and should be available as an e-book there very soon. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, it will be published as a hardback in the U.K. next April. And I am very happy to report that the American edition is in its third printing.\n\nOkay, now on to other issues. National Public Radio asked me to do a brief article on the Best Historical Novels of 2011, which ought to be up on their website http://www.npr.org/ in early December. And I had fun doing a slideshow for the Huffington Post about New Jersey writers. Here is the link, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-kay-penman/12-authors-you-didnt-know_b_1108262.html I was surprised that so many renowned writers were born and bred in New Jersey, which is often an object of ridicule for the rest of the country. I’d originally created seven categories: Those Fluent in Sarcasm, Trail Blazers, Historical Novelists, Poets, Miscellaneous, Writers We Stole from NYC, and Newark, which unexpectedly emerged as a literary Eden. The powers-that-be at the Huffington Post asked me to trim it back, and we eventually ended up with twelve slideshows, one for each of the following New Jersey stars: Norman Mailer, Dorothy Parker, Phillip Roth, Janet Evanovich, George R.R. Martin, Stephen Crane, James Fenimore Cooper, Allen Ginsberg, Judy Blume, Harlan Coben, and two we “borrowed” from NYC, Jon Stewart and Peter Benchley. I was able to praise the Ice and Fire series, explain that Jaws was actually based upon a horrific series of attacks off the Jersey coast by a Great White shark in 1916, and showcase my favorite Dorothy Parker quote; she was once challenged at a dinner party to use “horticulture” in a sentence, and without pausing for breath, she purred, “You can lead a whore to culture, but you can’t make her think.” Another Parker response I like is when she was sitting morosely at a bar and when the bartender asked, “What are you having?”, she sighed, “Not much fun.”\n\nBut there were a number of other gifted New Jersey writers who didn’t make the final cut simply because the Slideshow space was limited. I felt badly that I couldn’t even mention them. Fortunately, I have a blog.\n\nSo…in addition to the above-named dazzling dozen, New Jersey can boast the following native-born sons and daughters:\n\n1) Fran Liebowitz–writer, columnist, and social critic, known for her acerbic wit and one of the world’s worst cases of Writer’s Block, as she has been working on one novel for decades.\n\n2) Gay Talese–writer, reporter, essayist, noted for what is often called the New Journalism.\n\n3) Robin Maxwell, novelist, screenwriter, and blogger. Among her novels are The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn, and her most recent work, O Juliet, an imaginative retelling of the story of Shakespeare’s doomed lovers; she is currently working on a novel about Tarzan and Jane.\n\n4) C.K. Williams, acclaimed poet and Pulitzer Prize winner.\n\n5) Amiri Baraki—poet, novelist, dramatist, essayist, teacher, often embroiled in controversy, a former Poet Laureate of NJ.\n\n6) Alfred Joyce Kilmer (1886-1918)—journalist, poet, critic, editor, best known today for the poem so many children have memorized as a class assignment, Trees; he died in WWI at the Second Battle of the Marne.\n\n7) William Carlos Williams (1883-1963)—a major American poet, novelist, essayist, and physician, mentor to Allen Ginsberg, Pulitzer Prize winner, and member of the New Jersey Hall of Fame. (Yes, we have one!)\n\n8) Anne Morrow Lindbergh (1906-2001)—author and aviator, best known for Gift From the Sea, probably better known to the general public as the wife of Charles Lindbergh.\n\n9) John Angus McPhee—author, staff writer for the New Yorker, Princeton professor, Pulitzer Prize winner.\n\n10) Jacqueline Friedrich, a writer who focuses on a subject dear to my heart—wine; check out her blog, The Wine Humanist. http://www.jacquelinefriedrich.com/\n\n11) Albert Payson Terhune (1872-1942)—author of the collies of Sunnybank books; his Lad was almost as beloved in his time as Lassie. I’d originally put Terhune in the Newark slideshow, although I wasn’t sure he belonged there. Wikipedia says he was born in Newark, but I couldn’t confirm it. While I loved his books as a child, when I reread them years later, I was startled by his casual bias against those not of his “class.” He was a believer in bloodlines—for dogs and people—and scornful of those he considered members of the lower order: immigrants, laborers, people of color, dogs that were not purebred. So it appealed to me to think of this aristocratic, rather pompous man being born in a gritty, blue-collar city like Newark. (The other writers able to claim Newark as their hometown are Harlan Coben, Stephen Crane, Allen Ginsberg, Phillip Roth, C.K. Williams, and Amiri Baraki.)\n\nWe were having a lively discussion on my Facebook page recently about “celebrity” authors, people who are famous for being famous, and then parlay their notoriety into book deals. It was triggered by my discovery that a novel written by the Kardashian sisters (Kim, Kloe, and Kourtney), about three high-profile sisters named Kamille, Kassidy, and Kyle, is on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list. One of my readers then suggested, tongue firmly in cheek, that we add Snookie from Jersey Shore to the list of NJ writers for her novel, It’s a Jersey Thing, in which she becomes a local celebrity after she—according to the book description—nearly burns down her rented bungalow, invents “tan-tags” (don’t even ask) and rescues a shark. I confess I was almost tempted to read about the shark rescue. But I decided Snookie didn’t make the cut. To borrow Voltaire’s comment that the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire, Snookie is not a writer and I don’t think she is even from New Jersey.\n\nSince this blog began with Lionheart, it seems right to end it with A King’s Ransom. Some of my readers have asked for reports on its progress—or the lack thereof. Well, I have just finished a chapter in which Richard was shipwrecked twice, so he is not in the best of moods. I am putting up photos of the site of his first shipwreck—the island of Lokrum, one-half mile from Dubrovnik; in Richard’s time, they were known as La Croma and Ragusa. In Lionheart, Eleanor crossed the Alps at Mont Genevre, which is today a posh ski resort, and I wondered what she’d make of that. Well, the place where Richard came ashore on Lokrum is now a celebrated nudist beach! The chapter ends with the second shipwreck, where they find themselves in a desolate, barren, deserted marsh, and Richard speaks for them all when he says, “Where in God’s Holy Name are we?”\n\nIn case I don’t get another blog up before Christmas, I want to wish everyone the best of holidays. Let’s hope the New Year is a better one for us all, especially Mother Earth.\n\nDecember 2, 2011"
