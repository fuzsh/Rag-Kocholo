        "text": "Not to be confused with Catalan Countries.\n\nThe Catalan counties (Catalan: Comtats Catalans, IPA: [kumˈtats kətəˈlans]) were the administrative Christian divisions of the eastern Carolingian Hispanic Marches and the southernmost part of the March of Gothia in the Pyrenees created after their rapid conquest by the Franks.\n\nThe various counties roughly defined what later came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia.\n\nIn 778, Charlemagne led the first military Frankish expedition into Hispania to create the Hispanic Marches, a buffer zone between the Umayyad Moors and Arabs of Al-Andalus and the Frankish Kingdom of Aquitaine. The territory that he subdued was the kernel of Catalonia (not yet known like that since the first written mention of Catalonia and the Catalans as an ethnicity appears almost a century later in 1113 at the Liber maiolichinus) which was already a no man's land since the defeat of the Visigoths and the arrival of the Muslims in 714 who crossed the Pyrenees with an army to be defeated in 732 at the Battle of Tours. In 781, Charlemagne made his 3-year-old son Louis the Pious (778 – 840) king of Aquitaine, who was sent there with regents and a court in order to secure the southern border of his kingdom against the Arabs and the moors and to expand southwards into Muslim territory.\n\nThese counties were originally feudal entities ruled by a small military elite. Counts were appointed directly by and owed allegiance to the Carolingian (Frankish) emperor. The appointment to heirs could not be taken for granted. However, with the rise of the importance of the Bellonids and strong figures among them such as, Sunifred (fl. 844–848) and Wilfred the Hairy (c.870-897), and the weakening of Carolingian royal power, the appointment of heirs eventually become a formality. This trend resulted in the counts becoming de facto independent of the Carolingian crown under Borrell II in 987, starting since, to call themselves and to be known as dei gratia comes (counts by the grace of god) and dux catalanensis (Catalan dukes) or even Hispaniae subjogator (attorney of Hispania) and Propugnator et murus christiani populi (wall and defender of the Christian folk).\n\nThe many counties (aside from the counties of County of Pallars, County of Urgell and County of Empuries) were to be soon absorbed into the County of Barcelona. A Count of Barcelona, prince Ramon Berenguer IV, married princess Petronilla of Aragon of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1150, uniting as equals the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon. Thus, their son, Alfonso II of Aragon, became the first king of the Crown of Aragon, ruling over both the Catalans and the Aragonese.\n\nCreation\n\nThe reconquista from the Moors by the Franks began in 785. In 785, Rostany (or Rostaing) was made Count of Girona, the first of the Catalan counties to be established. Besalú and Empúries were originally part of Girona. In 801, in the greatest military triumph of his long career, the young Louis took Barcelona, the greatest city of the Catalan littoral. When Urgell and Cerdanya were subdued around 798, they were also made counties and Borrell was made count. He took a very active part in the subsequent conquest of Osona in 799 and the successful siege of Barcelona in 801. He was made count of Osona in 799, perhaps as a reward for his services. In 801, the greatest of the counties, Barcelona, was established under Bera. In 812, Count Odilo of Girona (which included Besalú and Empúries) died and the county also passed to Bera.\n\nIn 804 and 805, Borrell participated in the expeditions to Tortosa, but not in the subsequent campaigns of 808 and 809. On Borrell's death in 820, Osona was given to Rampon and Urgell and Cerdanya went to Aznar Galíndez. Also in 820, Bera went into political disfavour and lost the countships of Barcelona and Girona, which also went to Rampon.\n\nAround 813, Empúries became a separate county under Ermenguer, and in 817, it was united to the County of Roussillon. From 835 to 844, Sunyer I was count of Empúries and Peralada while Alaric I was count of Roussillon and Vallespir.\n\nBesalú was made a separate county in 878 for Radulf on the condition that it pass to the heirs of Wilfred the Hairy on his death. It went to Miro I the Younger in 912.\n\nBarcelona soon overshadowed the other counties in importance, especially during the reign of Wilfred the Hairy in the late 9th century. At that time, the power of the Carolingians was waning and the neglected Hispanic march was practically independent of royal authority. In the early 11th century, Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, was able to submit to Sancho III of Navarre as his suzerain, even though he was still legally a vassal of Robert II of France. With the accession of Robert's father, Hugh Capet, the first non-Carolingian king, in 987, most of the Catalan counts refused to pay homage to the new dynasty. Over the next century, most of the Catalan counties came into the hands of the counts of Barcelona. In time, one of the Counts of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer IV, married the heiress of Aragon, Petronella, uniting the counties under the count's power to that kingdom, creating the Crown of Aragon. Several of the later kings re-created some Catalan counties as appanages for younger sons.\n\nCatalan Counties and Viscounties\n\nCatalan Counties Catalan Viscounties\n\nCounty of Barcelona\n\nCounty of Berga\n\nCounty of Besalú\n\nCounty of Cerdanya\n\nCounty of Conflent\n\nCounty of Empúries\n\nCounty of Girona\n\nCounty of Manresa\n\nCounty of Osona or Ausona\n\nCounty of Pallars\n\nCounty of Pallars Jussà (Lower Pallars)\n\nCounty of Pallars Sobirà (Upper Pallars)\n\nCounty of Ribagorça\n\nCounty of Rosselló\n\n(often referred to as Roussillon, its French name)\n\nCounty of Urgell\n\nViscounty of Àger\n\nViscounty of Besalú or Bas\n\nViscounty of Cabrera\n\nViscounty of Cardona\n\nViscounty of Castellbó\n\nViscounty of Cerdanya\n\nViscounty of Illa (Ille sur Tet in French)\n\nViscounty of Jóc (Joch in French)\n\nViscounty of Fenollet or Fenolleda (Fenouillèdes in French)\n\nViscounty of Pallars, Siarb or Vilamur\n\nViscounty of Peralada\n\nViscounty of Rocaberti\n\nViscounty of Tatzó (Argelès in French)\n\nViscounty of Urtx\n\nViscounty of Vallespir or Castellnou\n\nAppointed Rulers\n\nRuler Born Reign Death Ruling part Family Notes Rostany ? 785-801/11 ?

The Catalans confronted him during the Catalan Civil War and afterward reinstated him as Count of Barcelona. Ferdinand II 20 January 1479 – 23 January 1516 He was the son of John II. Joanna 23 January 1516 – 12 April 1555 She was the daughter of Ferdinand II. Her rule was nominal as it was his son Charles who co-ruler.\n\nThe Houses of Habsburg and Bourbon 1516-1808\n\nSee also: House of Bourbon\n\nName Portrait Reign Notes Charles I (emperor) 14 March 1516 – 12 April 1555 (as regent)\n\n12 April 1555 – 16 January 1556 (as sole ruler) He was the son of Queen Joanna and Philip I of Castile. Till the death of her mother, in 1555, he was regent but the de facto ruler. From 155 to 1556, he was the sole ruler. As he was not the Count (till her mother died) and had good relations with Catalan authorities, they awarded him the title of Prince of Catalonia. Philip I 16 January 1556 – 13 September 1598 He was the son of Charles I. Philip II 13 September 1598 – 31 March 1621 He was the son of Philip I. Philip III 31 March 1621 – 1641 He was the son of Philip II. He wanted to reduce the Catalan sovereignties, and the Catalan authorities confronted him during the Reapers' War. The title of Count of Barcelona was transferred by the Catalan Courts to the House of Bourbon in France. Louis I\n\n(Louis XIII of France)\n\n27 September 1601 – 14 May 1643 1641–1643 During the Reapers' War, the States-General (Braços Generals) of the Principality of Catalonia on 21 January 1641 declared the French king Louis XIII Count of Barcelona as Louis I.

In 1652 he renounces the title in favor of Philip III in exchange for the Roussillon. Philip III 1641 – 17 September 1665 He was the son of Philip II. He was reinstated as Count of Barcelona. Charles II 17 September 1665 – 1 November 1700 He was the son of Philip III.

On January 9, 1698, Catalonia is returned to Charles II after signing the Treaty of Rijswijk. Philip IV 1700 – 1705 Philip was a great-grandson of Philip III, and Charles was a cousin of thesame king. Charles II's testament in favor of the former destabilized Western Europe because it meant too much power for the Kingdom of France. The rest of the European powers tried to impose another pretender to the Crown of Spain: the Archduke Charles of Austria. The Catalans were caught in the middle of this major conflict: the Spanish Succession War. They initially supported Philip of Anjou but afterward shifted their allegeance towards Archduke Charles, who was committed to maintaining the composite monarchy system and thus respect the Catalan Constitutions. In 1714, Philip owned the Spanish possessions of the Habsburgs. Charles III 1705 – 1714\n\nHouse of Bourbon (Spanish branch) 1714-1808\n\nSee also: House of Bourbon\n\nIn 1714, Catalan lost their war (within the Spanish war of Succession conflict) against the remaining sole pretender to the Crown of Spain: Philip of Anjou. Through the Nueva Planta decrees, the new king Philip V abolished the Catalan Constitutions and dissolved the Crown of Aragon. The Principality of Catalonia became another province of the Crown of Castille, and thus the title of Count of Barcelona was emptied of real political significance and power. Since then, the numbering of the Counts of Barcelona follows that of the Crown of Castille. That is the reason why Philip of Anjou was called by the Catalan Authorities 'Felip IV' in 1702 but called himself 'Felipe V' when he sized the title of Count of Barcelona in 1714, after winning the war against the Catalans.\n\nHouse of Bonaparte 1808-1813\n\nSee also: House of Bonaparte\n\nIn 1808 Charles IV and his son Ferdinand resign from their Crown of Spain titles and transfer them to Emperor Napoleon, who kept for himself the title of Count of Barcelona. By 1812, once he had full military control over the Principality of Catalonia, he separated it from the Crown of Spain and annexed it to the French Empire.\n\nName Portrait Reign Notes Napoleon I, Emperor 1808–1813 Napoleon annexed Catalonia to the French Empire as 4 new departments.

During the 2nd Spanish Republic and Francoist Dictatorship the Bourbons remained in exile and retained their dinastic titles, including 'Count of Barcelona'. Although on 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, no monarch was designated until 1969, when Franco established Juan Carlos of Bourbon as his official heir-apparent. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain.\n\nName Portrait Reign Notes John III\n\n(Juan III) 1977–1993 claimed the title from 1941; officially granted by his son Juan Carlos I as a courtesy in exchange for renouncing his claim to the Spanish throne\n\nTimeline\n\n$\n\nSee also"
