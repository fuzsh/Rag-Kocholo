Thus our king Sigismund, a titan of administration and genius of diplomacy not only greatly increased the personal fortune of Polish kings, but surrounding himself with most brilliant statesmen of the age, conducted slow but highly successful administrative, political, economic and military reforms of the Commonwealth, all the while trying to avoid unneccessary foreign adventures (Though he was an enthusiastic supporter of foreign adventures he considered necessary, beginning from screweing over Brandenburgian Hohenzollerns WRT the Prussian inheritance even before he ascended to the PLC throne, although, realizing his limitations on the military field, he preferred leaving the details to his hetmans and generals). His long rule was generally considered the new golden age of Poland.\n\n(2) King Sigismund claimed the regency of Prussia already in 1603, using his wife's rights as the pretext, and after the death of Albrecht Frederick he claimed the duchy for himself and granted it to his younger son, Prince Kazimierz Karol. The Duchy became Bathory hereditiary duchy inside PLC. Sigismund's marriage with Duchess Sophie initially wasn't particularly well received in the Commonwealth, as a marriage with a subject, and not particularly pretty or rich to that, but gained her subjects' respect as mother of many children and good administrator of her possessions. The position and power of dukes of Prussia decreased with time, nevertheless, no Sejm was capable of removing Bathorys from its throne.\n\n(3) With the extinction of Kettlers, the Duchy of Courland was granted for life to Prince Władysław Jerzy, a famous military commander and major force behind modernization of PLC's army. Following Prince Władysław's death, the duchy was incorporated into the Commonwealth.\n\nWORKING PROGRESS\n\nCatherine of Braganza, queen consort of Charles II, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, dies during her third miscarriage due to heavy bleeding, and Charles II marries again.\n\nCharles II (29 May 1630-6 February 1685) m. 1662, 1} Catherine of Braganza (25 November 1638– 1668) m.1670 2} Princess Elisabeth Charlotte of Palatinate [1] (27 May 1652-8 December 1722)\n\nPrince Charles of Wales (2 July 1673 – 16 March 1676) [Died young]\n\nKing Henry IX [2] (2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723) m. 1695 Princess Magdalena Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst (13 October 1679 – 11 October 1740)\n\nElizabeth, Princess Royal (30 May 1697–29 November 1703) [Died young]\n\nCharlotte, Princess Royal (18 July 1698 – d. 13 November 1768) m. 1726 William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland (1 March 1709 – 1 May 1762)\n\nLady Elizabeth Bentinck (Welbeck Abbey, 27 June 1735 – 25 December 1825) m.

(I’ll get to this later lol)\n\n[3] Named in honor of his godfather, father's friend, and uncle-by-marriage, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.\n\nAlso, would anyone be interested in a thread on this???\n\nCouple questions:\n\nWhy is Arthur only king until 1540, yet dies in 1542? Who succeeds him?\n\nA duchess of Mantua seems a pretty low match for an emperor's granddaughter. Had Margarethe of Austria had a child by her Savoyard husband, perhaps. But Margarethe's daughter by a ROYAL husband, no doubt she'd do somewhat better. In fact, I could see HER marrying Frans of Denmark and her older sister wedding Karl V.\n\nLastly, ISTR in a prior thread where Henry Tudor ALSO wed before reclaiming the throne it was mentioned that he'd LACK the Yorkist support he had OTL, even if first sife was dead and buried by the time of Bosworth. Yes, Henry went to great lengths to ensure his claim WASN'T via Elizabeth, but he owed his throne as much to the promise to marry her (and the accompanying Yorkist support) as he did to Stanley turning coat and Percy not engaging.\n\nCouple questions:\n\nWhy is Arthur only king until 1540, yet dies in 1542?

Honestly, part of the reason why I posted this was because I'm really not sure what will happen when Arthur dies. As far as young Margaret Tudor's marriage, I was thinking about about a match with John III of Portugal as well...\n\nHonestly, it seems to me like OTL Henry Tudor didn't get support until the early 1480s, at which point in TTL he could still pledge to marry Elizabeth of York in 1483, thus setting him up for similar support as OTL? Unless I'm mistaken?\n\nArthur's reign dates were a flub on my part, I went back and changed it lol.

However, the alliance is still improtant enough for Karl V to want a match between his sister and the king of Portugal. Chances are good that with an of-age candidate, Eleanor Tudor winds up as Empress instead of Isabel of Portugal (who winds up in a convent here, since she refused to marry anyone else but Karl).\n\nHonestly, it seems to me like OTL Henry Tudor didn't get support until the early 1480s, at which point in TTL he could still pledge to marry Elizabeth of York in 1483, thus setting him up for similar support as OTL?

There's no way of sidelining said male heir except by Harry Tudor claiming the crown through Elizabeth, and thus their kids inheriting the crown while Artie gets only Richmond. Since Harry didn't do this OTL, and the Yorkists would be iffy about the marriage unless Artie were to bedisposed of, very quickly (a la Princes in the Tower)."
