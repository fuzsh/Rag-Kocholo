Earlier, King Ferdinand had offered James 150,000 florins, the title of Duke of Montblanc, and proposed an alliance between his son Henry and their eldest daughter, Isabella, but James had refused Ferdinand's offer on the advice of his mother. In addition to the loss of his title and assets, James was later tried, condemned, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe couple had five children:\n\nIsabella of Urgell, Duchess of Coimbra (12 March 1409 – 29 August 1443). Married Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra and was mother of Isabella, Queen of Portugal\n\nPhilip of Urgell (died 1422)\n\nEleanor of Urgell (1414 – after 1438).
