        "text": "A court in Russia's Krasnodar region said on August 2 that it had handed prison sentences to the first group of participants in anti-Jewish mob unrest in the North Caucasus region of Daghestan in October 2023.\n\nThree men -- Anvarbek Atayev, Islam Ibragimov, and Salik Ramazanov -- were sentenced to 6 years and four months in prison each, while another defendant, Magomed Omaraskhabov, was sentenced to 6 1/2 years.\n\nThe four were found guilty of taking part in mass unrest. A fifth defendant, Rabadan Radzhabov, was also convicted of attacking a police officer and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nThe court concluded that the defendants’ actions at the airport in Makhachkala airport had been based on \"ethnic and religious hatred,\" adding that their actions blocked the operations of the airport for a significant period of time.\n\nThe five men had pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe violence occurred on October 29, 2023, when hundreds of protesters, angry over the situation surrounding the ongoing war between Israel and the extremist group Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, broke through doors and barriers at the airport to get access to a plane that landed from Tel Aviv.\n\nThey stopped passengers who arrived from Israel, checking their ethnicity and citizenship by demanding that they show their passports.\n\nIn all, some 1,500 people took part in the unrest, with 136 of them subsequently being charged with participating in a riot and attacking law enforcement officers.\n\nThe Daghestani Prosecutor-General's Office said at the time that some 30 police officers were attacked while trying to restore order at the airport, some of whom sustained serious injuries.\n\nThe Kremlin blamed the unrest on \"outside interference\" and without showing any evidence accused Ukraine of involvement, which Kyiv rejected.\n\nThe Middle East conflict broke out after Hamas militants stormed Israel on October 7, killing hundreds of people and taking more than 200 hostage. Israel retaliated with a military campaign against Gaza, leading to the deaths of thousands of people and the destruction of much of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 23 again called for peace as he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a historic first visit to Kyiv as the war triggered by Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine neared the two-and-a-half-year mark.\n\nModi, who arrived by train from Poland, sat down for talks with Zelenskiy after both men visited a memorial exhibition in Kyiv dedicated to the children killed during the war.\n\n\"We have stayed away from the war with great conviction. This does not mean that we were indifferent,\" Modi, seated alongside Zelenskiy, said in remarks to the media posted on his X account.\n\n\"From day one, we were not neutral. We have taken one side, and we stand firmly for peace.\"\n\nModi did not elaborate on his vision for a peaceful resolution of the war, which was started by Russia, traditionally India's ally.\n\nIndia came under fire from some Western countries after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, which coincided with a deadly Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv that elicited harsh international condemnation.\n\nThe United States was particularly concerned with Modi’s two-day visit to Russia as it sees New Delhi as an important pillar in its strategy to contain an ascendant China.\n\nZelenskiy at the time had harsh words for Modi's trip, too, saying it was a \"huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\"\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nOn August 23, Modi offered his country's humanitarian support for war-wracked Ukraine.\n\n\"Whatever help is required from a humanitarian standpoint, India will always stand with you and will go above and beyond to support you,\" Modi said.\n\nZelenskiy did not make any remarks, but posted a message on X accompanied by a video of him and Modi visiting the exhibition commemorating children who have died in the war.\n\n\"Today in Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I honored the memory of the children whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. Children in every country deserve to live in safety. We must make this possible,\"Zelenskiy said in his message.\n\nModi's trip is the first by an Indian leader to Kyiv since the countries established bilateral relations more than 30 years ago. He has said he plans to also discuss \"deepening the India-Ukraine friendship.\"\n\nUpon his arrival from Poland by train, Modi met with members of the Indian community in Kyiv.\n\n\"Reached Kyiv earlier this morning. The Indian community accorded a very warm welcome,\" Modi wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking during his trip to Poland on August 22 ahead of his arrival in Ukraine, Modi urged Moscow and Kyiv to find a path to peace \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I look forward to the opportunity to...share perspectives on a peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict,\" Modi said in Warsaw. \"As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nIn comments to Reuters, Zelenskiy's presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said Modi's visit to Kyiv was significant because New Delhi \"really has a certain influence\" over Moscow.\n\n\"It's extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is -- and that it is also in their interests,\" Podolyak said.\n\nThe New York-based Human Rights Foundation (HRF) said on August 22 that it had filed a submission with the Special Procedures division of the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of Marat Zhylanbaev, the imprisoned leader of the unregistered Algha Qazaqstan (Forward Kazakhstan) political party.\n\nZhylanbaev, a noted human rights activist and athlete, was arrested in May 2023 and initially sentenced to 20 days in jail for holding a picket two months earlier to demand the release of political prisoners and to ask Western nations to impose sanctions on Kazakh officials for \"helping\" Russia evade sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZhylanbaev was later remanded in custody on charges of taking part in a banned group's activities and financing an extremist organization.\n\nIn late November 2023, a court in Astana found Zhylanbaev guilty and sentenced him to seven years in prison while also banning him from engaging in social and political activities.\n\nIn June 2024, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan rejected Zhylanbaev's appeal against his incarceration.\n\nInvestigators say the activities of Zhylanbaev and his followers were coordinated by the fugitive critic of the Kazakh government, Mukhtar Ablyazov, whose Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK) movement was labeled as extremist and banned in the country in March 2018. Zhylanbaev is also accused of transferring money to supporters of DVK twice.\n\nZhylanbaev rejects the charges against him, calling them politically motivated.\n\n\"Kazakhstan failed to release Mr. Zhylanbaev when his pretrial detention was set to end in July 2023 and held him in a cell with a convicted individual while awaiting trial. His closed trial took place before a tightly controlled judiciary, and all but one of his requests to call witnesses was denied. His detention cannot be justified under these circumstances,\" HRF International Legal Associate Kaitie Holland said.\n\n\"The Kazakh regime has demonstrated a pattern of suppressing dissent by consistently classifying the opposition as 'extremist.'\"\n\nHRF asked UN Special Procedures to investigate Zhylanbaev's case and called on Kazakhstan to release him immediately.\n\nCIA director William Burns held talks on August 23 in Pristina with Prime Minister Albin Kurti before concluding his two-day visit in Kosovo, the Kosovar government said in a statement.\n\nKurti thanked Burns for Washington's continuous support for Kosovo and voiced Pristina's dedication to deepening bilateral cooperation while reaffirming his country's unwavering commitment to democracy, rule-of-law, and Euro-Atlantic integration, the statement said, calling Burns' visit \"historic.\"\n\nOn August 22, Burns met with Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani and the head of Kosovo's Intelligence Agency (KIA), Petrit Ajeti, according to a Facebook post by Osmani, who wrote on August 23 that her country's alliance with the United States was \"a guarantee of security, peace and success.”\n\nBurns, who arrived in Kosovo after reported stops earlier this week in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia during an unannounced tour amid concerns about U.S. relations with Kosovo and Russian influence in the Balkans, did not make any comment at the end of his visit.\n\nAccording to the flight-tracking website Flightradar24, a U.S. military plane believed to be used to fly the CIA chief made stops in those countries although his tour was not confirmed officially by U.S. authorities.\n\nBurns' visit to Kosovo follows concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nIn an interview last week with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Jeffrey Hovenier said the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government and the “quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department has urged Kurti to return to \"constructive and close engagement\" with Washington, the European Union, and NATO.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media

Albanian-majority southern side and a Serb-majority northern side,.\n\nSanctions-hit Belarus has announced that it will sign a free trade deal with China for services and investment, as well as agreements to strengthen cooperation in security, energy, and finance.\n\nThe new pact was announced in a joint statement released on August 23, a day after a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to Minsk where he met with Belarusian Prime Minister Raman Halouchanka and authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka, and promised to deepen cooperation to improve industrial supply chains and reduce costs.\n\n“One of them can definitely be called historic -- an agreement on the creation of a free trade zone for services and investment,” the statement quoted Lukashenka as saying about the agreements.\n\nBelarus said that the trade deal would create “transparent and predictable rules,” which would help the country’s economy by increasing its exports to China by at least 12 percent and boosting Chinese investment into Belarus by 30 percent in the next five years.\n\nSpeaking with Li, who arrived in Minsk after a multiday visit to Moscow, Lukashenka said he wanted to see a “large influx of Chinese technology” into Belarus over the coming years -- a move that could signal an increasing reliance on Beijing for trade and economic growth moving forward.\n\nChina is already Belarus’s second-largest trading partner after Russia, with the state-run China Daily saying that bilateral trade surpassed $8.4 billion in 2023.\n\nBelarus has been one of Russia's closest allies following its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing logistical support and air bases for the war and recently deployed Russian tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.\n\nBut while Minsk still relies heavily on Moscow for political and financial support, it has also looked to balance that dependence with closer ties with Beijing.\n\nThat need for diversification has grown in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with Moscow directing its political and economic resources toward the war.\n\nCut off from Brussels in 2020 following a crackdown triggered by his disputed reelection that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged, Lukashenka has courted China for loans, investment, and, increasingly, military and political support.\n\nIn July, Belarus became the 10th member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and also hosted Chinese troops for joint military exercises in the western part of the country, some 5 kilometers from the Polish border.\n\nOnce an active investor in Belarus for infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology ventures, China had not offered a new project or loan to Minsk since 2019 and seemed to have stepped back from the country amid its domestic crisis, which cut Lukashenka off politically from the European Union and made him a less appealing economic partner for Beijing.\n\nBut despite the years of limited economic engagement, Beijing and Minsk have maintained close political ties, which have now led to Lukashenka securing fresh Chinese investment.\n\nAmong the various agreements included in the series of deals, five industrial projects totaling $1 billion are set to be launched and 12 more industrial projects worth $2 billion are under approval, according to the joint statement.\n\nTheagreements signed also plan to set up closer cooperation between Belarus and Chinese provincial governments in Chongqing and Shaanxi.\n\nGermany’s decision to select Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof’s latest movie to represent the country in the 2025 Oscars in the international feature category shows that Iranian independent cinema is making strides, the director has told RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nRasoulof’s The Seed Of The Sacred Fig was selected by an independent jury of experts from among 13 submissions, according to German Films, which represents German cinema interests abroad.\n\nIn a brief message to Radio Farda on August 22, the Golden Bear-winning director said he was “happy” for various reasons.\n\n“First of all, the voice of Iranian independent cinema appears to be on a new path,” said Rasoulof, who fled Iran earlier this year.\n\n“Secondly, the movie offers a picture close to the reality about the women's protests in Iran,” he added, referring to the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ protests in 2022.\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death in morality-police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish-Iranian woman who was detained for allegedly flaunting the country’s strict dress code for women.\n\nThe unrest lasted for months, with rights groups estimating that more than 500 protesters were killed as security forces clamped down on the demonstrations.\n\nRasoulof said he was also happy because the movie’s submission as Germany’s hope for the Oscars was a recognition of the efforts and hardships endured by the cast and crew of the film in Iran.\n\n“This highlights the efforts of a group that tried to be an honest narrator of the truth despite the restrictions,” he said.\n\nRasoulof revealed in May that he had fled Iran after being informed that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison and flogging on security-related charges.\n\nAn outspoken critic of the Iranian establishment’s crackdown on protests, Rasoulof was convicted of “collusion to act against national security.”\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media

Festival.\n\nRasoulof attended the festival after leaving Iran, receiving a 12-minute standing ovation after the screening of his film. The movie won multiple awards at Cannes, including the Competition's Special Jury Prize and the Prix Francois Chalais for Best Film.\n\nThe film tells the story of an Iranian judge struggling with paranoia. His mistrust intensifies after his gun goes missing amid growing nationwide protests. He suspects his wife and daughters of stealing his weapon and imposes heavy restrictions at home.\n\nRasoulof won the Golden Bear -- the Berlin Film Festival’s top prize -- in 2020 for his film There Is No Evil, which tells four stories loosely connected to the themes of the death penalty in Iran and personal freedoms under oppression. He was barred by Tehran from travelling to Germany to receive his award.\n\nAs many as 11 policemen have been killed and 10 others injured in an August 22 ambush by robbers in Pakistan’s eastern Punjab Province, one of the deadliest attacks against law enforcement in the restive region in recent times.\n\nThe robbers, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and guns, attacked the officers while the two vehicles they were traveling in stopped along the road after one experienced mechanical problems, the police said.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and ordered \"immediate and effective action\" against the bandits. Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab Chief Minister, said in a statement that the attack “will not go unavenged.”\n\nThe ambush comes three weeks after six police officers from Punjab and Sindh provinces were killed by robbers in two separate attacks in the region on July 31.\n\nThe riverine region along the border of Punjab and southeastern Sindh Province is considered a no-go zone for citizens, and law enforcement agencies do not have much control of it.\n\nThe area, a combination of forests and uncultivated land owned by the state, is spread out over hundreds of square kilometers on both sides of the Indus river.\n\nArmed bandits have been present there for many years, engaging in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, and murder. Police and other law enforcement agencies began operations to combat their activities in 2021.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a non-governmental, independent body, said in its fact-finding report last year that at least \"300 cases of kidnapping for ransom were registered\" in 2022. The robbers make an estimated 1 billion Pakistani rupees ($3,580,400) a year from their illegal activities.\n\nExperts believe that local influential politicians and landlords are behind the gangs as they seek to profit from the land.\n\nWASHINGTON – In a historic speech at the Democratic National Convention, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris promised to continue military support for Ukraine and strengthen NATO as she accepted the party’s nomination for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe 59-year-old Harris, the first woman of color to top the presidential ticket of a major U.S. party, sharply criticized her Republican challenger Donald Trump for cozying up to authoritarian leaders.\n\nSpeaking to thousands of cheering supporters on the fourth and last day of the convention inside the United Center in Chicago, Harris, just a month after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed her to replace him atop the Democratic ticket, accused Trump of disowning Ukraine and allies and of denigrating the United States.\n\n“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies,” Harris, said on August 22 during the 40-minute speech.\n\n\"I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand,\" she added, contrasting her position with Trump and running mate JD Vance, who have repeatedly questioned U.S. backing for Ukraine.\n\nHarris, the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination, delivered an upbeat view of the United States and its standing in the world, a sharp contrast to the doom-and-gloom picture Trump painted at the Republican convention last month.\n\n“I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America,” she said.\n\nCraig Allen, a communications professor and political commentator at Arizona State University, told RFE/RL after the speech that while Harris was “inspiring,” especially when she spoke about family and her personal journey, her comments on Ukraine weren’t anything “that Biden hadn't already said.”\n\n“She did not elaborate on what she was going to do for Ukraine,” he added.\n\nTurning to the war between Israel and Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, Harris vowed to work toward ending the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe vice president said that as president she would \"always stand up for Israel\" and would \"never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists.\"\n\nThe address, watched by millions of Americans around the country, is the first time many voters have gotten to see the new Democratic candidate up close.\n\nHarris emerged as the party’s frontrunner on July 21 when Biden took the unprecedented step of bowing out of the race after winning the primaries.\n\nThe 81-year-old president faced intense pressure from senior party officials to withdraw after he appeared frail and confused during a June 27 debate against Trump, deepening widespread concern he was too old to serve another four years.\n\nWhile Harris oversaw key issues such as illegal immigration and abortion rights, like most vice presidents, she had been largely out of the public eye during her more than three years in office.\n\nIn a recent poll, more than a third of Americans said they don't know Harris or her positions well.\n\nWearing a blue suit, Harris talked about growing up in a middle class family of immigrants and going on to become a prosecutor to protect people.\n\nShe laid out some of her priorities as president, including increasing the supply of affordable housing and protecting abortion rights.\n\n“They are out of their mind,” Harris said about the Trump's campaign stance on abortion.\n\nThe former president took to social media and then called into Fox News to comment further, to criticize the speech for not talking about China, oil fracking, or crime, issues that Trump has pushed consistently.\n\n“It was a lot of complaining,\" he said.\n\n“Why didn’t she do the things that she’s complaining about?”\n\nIndependent polls taken days before the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention showed Harris, who if elected would become the first female president in the history of the United States, slightly edging out Trump in a hypothetical national vote.\n\nAnalysts say even 100,000 votes across a few swing states could determine the outcome of the November 5 election.\n\nHarris' campaign has enjoyed a momentum not seen by a Democratic candidate since former President Barack Obama’s first bid in 2008, party members say.\n\nEven though Trump and Biden easily won their respective primaries earlier this year, a significant number of American voters said they wanted new candidates on the ballot. The two men faced off in 2020.\n\nHarris's entry into the race has energized some voters – especially younger women – who had shown little enthusiasm for either Biden or Trump, experts said.\n\nRussia's secret service agency, the FSB, said it has opened a criminal case against CNN journalist Nick Paton Walsh and two Ukrainian correspondents saying they illegally crossed into the country to film reports on Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory.\n\nThe journalists -- which include Paton Walsh, a British national, and Ukrainian journalists Diana Butsko and Olesya Borovik -- reported from the Sudzha area of the Kursk region, where Ukraine has surprisingly taken a foothold inside of Russia in recent weeks.\n\nThe incursion is the biggest into Russia by a foreign power since World War II.\n\n\"In the near future, they will be put on the international wanted list,\" the FSB said in a statement on August 22, adding all three face up to five years in prison.\n\nThe journalists entered Russia embedded with a Ukrainian military convoy and travelled to the town of Sudzha in a reporting mission CNN said was a legitimate reporting trip.\n\n\"Our team was invited by the Ukrainian government, along with other international journalists, and escorted by the Ukrainian military to view territory it had recently occupied,\" CNN said in a statement.\n\n\"This is protected activity in accordance with the rights afforded to journalists under the Geneva Convention and international law,\" it added.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:51 0:00\n\nThe FSB move comes on the heels of a similar case launched last weekend against two Italian journalists who reported on Ukraine's offensive in the Kursk region.\n\nSimone Traini and Stefania Battistini were also accused of illegally crossing the border.\n\nMoscow subsequently summoned Italy's ambassador to Moscow, Cecilia Piccioni, who informed Russia's Foreign Ministry that Italian state broadcaster RAI, \"and in particular the editorial teams, plan their activities in a totally free and independent way.\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry earlier this week also summoned the U.S. Embassy's Deputy Chief of Mission Stephanie Holmes to protest what it called \"provocative\" reports by U.S. journalists from the Kyiv-controlled part of Russia's Kursk region who \"illegally\" crossed the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian forces sank a Russian ferry carrying fuel tanks in a missile strike on a port in Russia's southern Krasnodar region on August 22, Russian officials said.\n\n\"As a result of the damage, the ferry sank in the waters of the Kavkaz port,\" the Krasnodar region's operational headquarters said on Telegram.\n\nThe headquarters reported earlier that \"a railroad ferry with fuel tanks in the Kavkaz port was attacked\" and that emergency services had been dispatched. Images circulating on social media showed a plume of dark smoke rising in the area of the ferry crossing.\n\nThe port sits in the Kerch Strait separating Russia from Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine has issued no official comment on the incident, but Darya Zarivna, a communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a photo on Telegram showing a large fire at the port and the word \"Beautiful.\"\n\nFyodor Babenkov, the district head of the Russian town of Temryuk, was quoted by Reuters as saying the ferry was carrying 30 fuel tanks. The vessel sustained significant damage as a result of the attack, which caused a fire, Babenkov said.\n\nThe Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti said five people were on the vessel at the time of the attack and were unaccounted for. The Russian online news channel Baza reported that the number of people on board was 15 and all were missing.\n\nAll port employees were evacuated, TASS reported citing the Transport Ministry.\n\nUkraine in recent weeks has taken bold steps, including a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region and attacks on fuel storage facilities and airfields inside Russia used to conduct attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, in an effort to turn the tide of the war.\n\nA drone strike earlier on August 22 on an airfield hundreds of kilometers inside Russia was the work of Ukraine's military intelligence, security sources told RFE/RL.\n\nZelenskiy, meanwhile, traveled to Ukraine's Sumy region that borders Kursk for the first time since the start of Ukraine's invasion there on August 6.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:51 0:00\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) together with the Special Operations Forces early on August 22 struck the Marinovka airfield in Russia's Volgograd region, located 275 kilometers east of the Ukrainian border, SBU sources told RFE/RL on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAfter the impact, \"plumes of black smoke and a powerful detonation\" occurred on the airfield surface, the SBU source said.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe strike targeted a storage site for fuel, antitank missiles, and glide bombs, the security source said.\n\nEarlier, Russian Telegram channels, citing eyewitnesses, reported a series of explosions at Marinovka, and the Astra channel on Telegram posted a video showing what appeared to be a large explosion and plumes of black smoke rising above the airfield.\n\nVolgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said drone strikes ignited a fire at a military facility in the region but claimed the attack had been repelled.\n\n\"As a result of the UAV crash, a fire broke out on the territory of a ministry facility. Fire and rescue services quickly began extinguishing the fire,\" Bocharov said on Telegram, adding that there were no casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, the airport of regional capital Volgograd, a city of some 1 million people 55 kilometers east of Marinovka, restricted the arrivals and departures of commercial aircraft.\n\nVolgograd is the current name of Tsaritsyn, which from 1925 to 1961 bore the name Stalingrad, after Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Stalingrad became famous for its repelling a monthslong Nazi siege in 1942-1943 during World War II.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian military said late on August 22 that 135 combat clashes had taken place at the front during the day, and that Russia continues to concentrate its main efforts in the Pokrovsk area, where it attacked Ukrainian positions 53 times.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:47 0:00\n\nA Russian military strike killed a 56-year-old man and injured eight others in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said .The injured included a 15-year-old boy, while residential buildings were also damaged.\n\nAfter Zelenskiy met with Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, in Sumy, a Russian drone attack killed two civilians and wounded a third.\n\nDuring his visit to Sumy, Zelenskiy was briefed by Syrskiy on the operational situation in the area controlled by Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk, Ukraine's presidential administration said in a statement.\n\nSumy Governor Volodymyr Artyukh told Zelenskiy that following the start of Ukraine's operation in Kursk, the number of cross-border shellings and the casualties among civilians had dropped drastically, also allowing the start of infrastructure repairs badly needed after months of incessant Russian bombardments, the statement said.\n\nUkraine's leadership has repeatedly stated that its bold move into Kursk aims to establish a buffer zone inside Russia meant to protect Ukrainian civilians from cross-border Russian shelling.\n\nUkraine has also said it is not pursuing territorial gains from Russia.\n\nALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Prosecutors on August 22 asked the Specialized Inter-District Court in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, to sentence the imprisoned former wife of a convicted nephew of the Central Asian nation's former authoritarian president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, to 12 years in prison on charges that include the illegal deprivation of liberty and extortion.\n\nInvestigators say Gulmira Satybaldy, with the assistance of her driver, forcibly held her former business partner and relative Abai Zhunusov in isolation against his will for 165 days in 2019 to force him to give up his stakes in several businesses.\n\nSatybaldy is concurrently serving two sentences -- eight years for embezzlement and the illegal appropriation of shares and assets of several enterprises, and seven years for abduction and actions aiding the commission of a crime.\n\nThe sentences were handed down by a court in May and June last year.\n\nProsecutors are now asking the court to rule that the new 12-year sentence they are seeking for the defendant be served partially concurrently, meaning that the total time to be spent in prison by Satybaldy would be 13 years.\n\nGulmira Satybaldy was arrested along with her ex-husband Qairat Satybaldy in March 2022. He was tried separately in September 2023 and sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of fraud and embezzlement.\n\nLast week, a court in Kazakhstan's eastern city of Oskemen replaced Qairat Satybaldy's six-year prison sentence with a suspended sentence.\n\nCourt No. 2 in the capital of the East Kazakhstan region ruled on August 16 that Qairat Satybaldy must be released with a suspended 40-month sentence, stressing that the once extremely powerful businessman and politician had returned all the money he was accused of embezzling to the State Treasury.\n\nThe probes launched against the couple were part of a series of investigations targeting relatives and allies of Nazarbaev following unprecedented anti-government protests that turned into deadly mass disorders in early January 2022.\n\nAfter the deadly events, the Kazakh regime began to quietly target Nazarbaev, his family, and other allies -- many of whom held powerful or influential posts in government, security agencies, and profitable energy companies.\n\nCIA director William Burns has arrived in Kosovo after stops earlier this week in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia on an unannounced trip amid concerns about U.S. relations with Kosovo and Russian influence in the Balkans.\n\nBurns was seen on August 22 entering the building of Kosovo’s presidency.\n\nA U.S. government official confirmed to RFE/RL earlier this week that Burns arrived in Sarajevo and met with his Bosnian counterparts, members of the presidency, and the foreign minister.\n\nBurns is believed to have traveled from Sarajevo to Belgrade, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia before arriving in Kosovo. According to the flight-tracking website Flightradar24, a U.S. military plane believed to be used to fly the CIA chief made stops in those countries. On August 22, it was seen parked at the VIP gate at Pristina's international airport, according to an RFE/RL photographer.\n\nBut there has been no confirmation of Burns’ visit to Kosovo from the U.S. Embassy in Pristina, the Kosovar presidency, or the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe U.S. government official who confirmed Burns’ visit to Sarajevo said the CIA chief was in the Bosnian capital to discuss the “worrying secessionist rhetoric and actions” of the pro-Russian president and government of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Serb entity.\n\nBurns' visit to Kosovo follows concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nIn an interview last week with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Jeffrey Hovenier said the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government and the “quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department has urged Kurti to return to \"constructive and close engagement\" with Washington, the European Union, and NATO, while the United States is also urging Kosovo not to reopen a bridge in Mitrovica because of security concerns.\n\nBurns did not meet with Kurti because the prime minister is in Chicago attending the Democratic National Convention at the invitation of the National Democratic Institute.\n\nFormer Kosovar security forces commander Kadri Kastrati said Burns’ visit may be linked to Russia’s activities in the western Balkans, where he said Moscow is waging a “hybrid war.\"\n\nKastrati said the greatest risk of conflict is in Bosnia through Republika Srpska and in northern Kosovo.\n\nBurns’ visit shows that the CIA has “enough information about Russian efforts -- through its satellite, Serbia --- that this part of Europe is at risk of a potential conflict,” Kastrati said. \"They came here to give their recommendations.\"\n\nWhen Iran’s reformist President Masud Pezeshkian submitted nominees for his 19-member Cabinet, many expected the hard-line parliament to reject at least some of his picks.\n\nBut in a rare move, lawmakers accepted the entire slate of ministers without a change, the first time a president has managed the feat in over two decades.\n\nPezeshkian hailed the move as a win for consensus in the divided country. But critics said the unanimous approval of his cabinet showed the limits of the president’s powers in Iran’s clerically dominated political system.\n\nThat is because Pezeshkian, addressing parliament before they voted on his nominees, said that the names were selected in “coordination” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and preapproved by him.\n\nSome Iranians saw Pezeshkian’s comments as an admission that the government is controlled by the supreme leader, who has the final say on all important matters of the state.\n\nHamid Aboutalebi, a former Iranian ambassador to Australia, said Pezeshkian may have “won the battle in parliament” but had “lost [Iran’s] century-long war for constitutionalism and republicanism.”\n\nSome Iranian social media users said the presidency had lost all legitimacy and Pezeshkian was effectively a prime minister reporting to Khamenei.\n\n“Get rid of this meaningless position of president and appoint a prime minister,” said political activist Hossein Razzaq.\n\nRazzaq added that Khamenei should pick the head of government so that public funds are not spent on holding “ridiculous elections for show\" in Iran, where votes are tightly controlled.\n\nIn many countries, including Iran, a president is elected by the people. A prime minister, a role that does not exist in Iran, is typically chosen by parliament or the head of state.\n\nSome Iranians argued that Khamenei had finally realized what they said was his yearslong goal of abolishing the presidency and installing a prime minister, arguing that in Pezeshkian, he had accomplished it without the need to change the constitution.\n\nIn 2011, Khamenei said there would be “nothing wrong in changing” the system of government if “one day in the distant future it is felt that a parliamentary system is better than a presidential system for appointing officials.”\n\nGetting rid of the presidency would further widen Khamenei’s powers.\n\nIran abolished the position of prime minister in 1989, a decade after the Islamic Revolution. The prime minister’s duties were divided between the president and the newly established position of first vice-president.\n\nUnder the Islamic republic, the prime minister was nominated by the president and approved by parliament. He served as the head of the government.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Russia and Ukraine to find a path to peace \"as soon as possible\" ahead of his historic visit to Kyiv.\n\nModi was in Warsaw on August 22 to meet with Polish officials before heading to Ukraine, the first trip by an Indian leader to Kyiv since the countries established bilateral relations more than 30 years ago. His visit also marks the first trip by an Indian prime minister to Warsaw in 45 years.\n\n\"It is India's strong belief that no problem can be resolved on a battlefield,\" Modi said while in the Polish capital, adding that his country supported \"dialogue and diplomacy for restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible.\"\n\nIndia came under fire from some Western countries after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, which coincided with a deadly Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv that elicited harsh international condemnation.\n\nThe United States was particularly concerned with Modi’s two-day visit to Russia as it sees New Delhi as an important pillar in its strategy to contain an ascending China.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said as he welcomed Modi that \"history has taught our nations the importance of respecting the rules, respecting borders, [and] territorial integrity.\"\n\nModi said in a statement published before he left for Poland that \"as a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nThe statement added that Modi will hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and \"share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict.\""
