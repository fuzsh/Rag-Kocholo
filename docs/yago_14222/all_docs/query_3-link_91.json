        "text": "Hajia Turai Yar’Adua, Nigeria’s immediate former First Lady, stayed mostly in the shadows of her now fallen husband. But stealth, rather than laid back is the way most Nigerians know her.\n\nCalculating rather than unassuming is the indelible memory they will keep, at least according to the widespread coverage she received in the ailing months of her husband Musa Yar’Adua.\n\nTrawling the Internet for information about Mrs Yar’Adua, one can hardly tell fact from fiction. Little is officially known about her but numerous news reports quote unnamed sources casting the image of a power baron – feared in some quarters and despised in others in equal measure.\n\nThis Day newspaper reported recently that Mrs Yar’Adua was a very quiet and unassuming woman even as the wife of Nigerian president Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.\n\n“Turai is one First Lady that is seen but hardly heard. Yet, she is perceived to be very influential in government and over her husband, President Yar’Adua till death. Some of the beliefs about her was that certain decisions believed to be taken by President Yar’Adua were indeed taken by her,” reported the paper.\n\nNot-in-your-face woman\n\nHer late husband’s spokesperson, Segun Adeniyi, described her as “a warm, caring, not-in-your-face woman who wants her husband to succeed and who is eager to ensure stability on the home front and leverage her moral power for the greater good of the society”.\n\nBut he seems to have only a few on his side. The Punch reported recently that Mrs Yar’Adua has attracted more of negative news than positive in the few months preceding her husband’s death.\n\nDuring this time, angry Nigerians said she was a shame to womanhood and called for her arrest for allegedly blocking access to the late president.\n\nMrs Yar’Adua was said to head a close-knit clutch of gatekeepers and aides who keep the president off-limits. Those who wished to see him had seek permission and this was often denied by the first lady.\n\nEven Goodluck Jonathan, then the acting president, was reportedly hardly allowed to see his president. Mr Yar’Adua was already ill when he took office in 2007. He has periodically sought treatment abroad for a chronic kidney condition, the details of which have never been disclosed.\n\nWhen he disappeared in November, his doctor said he was also suffering from pericarditis, an inflammation of the heart’s lining. But no updates were issued afterwards.\n\nIn this information vacuum, rumours of all manner flew in every direction. While Nigeria’s ailing president remained unseen abroad and after he was flown home under the cover of darkness, Mrs Yar’Adua stepped into the spotlight in the oil-rich nation.\n\nThe first lady — not her husband — planned to meet privately with acting president Goodluck Jonathan shortly after the president’s return to Nigeria. Details on the planned encounter were not released.\n\nShe controlled access to her husband while he was hospitalised for three months in Saudi Arabia, allowing only very close family members and a few aides to see him.\n\nMany Nigerians believe she also organised a military convoy that escorted Yar’Adua from Abuja’s international airport when he returned home unannounced. At one point, a headline in The Daily Sun newspaper proclaimed “Turai takes over.”\n\nCalling the shots\n\n“She is indeed the person I think is calling the shots,” John Campbell, a former US ambassador to Nigeria who now is a fellow with the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations told the Associated Press at the time.\n\n“The basis of her ability to do it is because she controls access to the president.”\n\nOne of her critics, Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka, described the fallen president as a victim of spousal abuse.\n\n“For me, this is sacrilege, acute sacrilege and I think we should begin criminal proceeding against Turai for kidnapping and false imprisonment of her husband.\n\n\"If it were in a civilised society, this woman should be in court by now for kidnapping and false imprisonment. Far even worst than abusing her spouse, she is also abusing a nation, abusing and insulting the intelligence of a nation,” Prof Soyinka said.\n\nAnd when the president died, Prof Soyinka did not mince words about how her sees the Nigerian presidency.\n\n“What passes for the Nigerian nation is nothing more than a tragic arena, and Yar’Adua is only the latest tragic figure.\n\n\"The vampires, including those within his own family, turned him into a mere inert resource for their diabolical schemes. They have a reckoning with their conscience, assuming they know what the word means.”\n\n“One can only hope that, while mouthing sanctimonious platitudes such as ‘Power belongs to God,’ they have now learnt that the politics of Do-or-Die cannot guarantee who does and who dies. They must stop playing God. I pray for the repose of the soul of their latest, much abused, innocent victim,” said the professor."
