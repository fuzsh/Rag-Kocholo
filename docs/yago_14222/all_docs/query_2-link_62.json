        "text": "Raising children to be great in future takes a lot of work. It takes great mothers to produce great children.\n\nMothers cannot predict the future of their children but they play the most important role in making a child a better person.\n\nHajia Aya Dada Yar’Adua, the wife of former minister Musa Yar’dua is a proud mother and a grandmother. All her children are great men.\n\nHajia Yar’Adua is the mother of late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua who was also an ex-Governor of Katsina State.\n\nShehu Musa Yaradua, Vice President of Nigeria from 1979 to 1982 is also a son of Hajia Yar’Adua. Alhaji Murtala Shegu Yaradua, who was former minister from 2009 to 2011, is also a grandson of the woman.\n\nThat is not all, three of her granddaughters are married to Governors in some Nigerian states.\n\nOTHER STORIES:\n\nShatta Wale causes stir with ‘kaba and slit’ outfit [photo]\n\nLydia Forson breaks the internet with raw chest in see-through s3xy dress (Photo)"
