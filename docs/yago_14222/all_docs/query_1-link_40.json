        "text": "Much of what is known about the late Nigerian President, Umaru Musa ‘Yaradua, who died on May 5 2010, was his two and half years as the president of Nigeria. During the period, and despite the global recession and the season of uncertainty that followed it, the Nigerian economy was growing, and the citizens were better off. Before becoming the president, ‘Yaradua was the Governor of Katsina state in northwest Nigeria. Little was known about him as a governor due principally to his philosophy: ‘what you do judges you more than what you say’. What he did in the eight years as the governor was adjudged as one of the best performances in Nigeria, an achievement that endeared him to his party leaders and that influenced his choice as the party's presidential flag-bearer. This presentation highlights some of the achievements of ‘Yaradua, the governor, including his austere lifestyle, his prudence in government and how he was able to transform the state from a non-performing to one of the top-performing states. A mixed method analysis including document review, ethnography and interview were adopted for the study. As the author was a member of the state cabinet, the recollection of experiences during cabinet meetings, especially, before major decisions were taken and direct talks with the governor on some government policies shaped the opinion presented. It is hoped that leaders at both the levels of government will learn from ‘Yaradua's style of leadership. Keywords: Pro-poor policies, Governance, ‘Yaradua, Presidential Villa, Katsina state,\n\nKatsina State Northwest Nigeria, like most developing societies, is faced with many challenges. The State is said to be one of the educationally disadvantaged states, it has the highest number of poor people amongst states in Nigeria and so on. Since the creation of the state in 1987, several governments have designed and implemented programmes and projects aimed at solving those mounting challenges with little or no success. As all problems have solutions, this paper theorises that Katsina State as presently constituted, is incapable of addressing those problems effectively and that to be able to overcome the challenges, extensive reform is essential. The paper is rooted in the proposition that the design of decision-making systems greatly affects their legitimacy and effectiveness. The paper, thus, proposes numerous systemic improvements, largely by indicating ways by which the interests of all should be considered while making decisions, that is, constituting a pro-people government. The aim is to establish a workable Katsina State committed to sustainable development. The paper further proposes a model that suggests designing governance, economic and financial systems that shall be able to sustain the government and make it viable. The suggested model when implemented shall be able to address the numerous challenges. Keywords: Katsina State, Transformation, Pro-People Governance, workable governance model, Umaru Musa ‘Yar’adua\n\nThe Nigeria's 2015 Presidential election held on the 28 th March, 2015 was the 5 th quadrennial election of the Fourth Republic which defiled military interruption for sixteen (16) years. Apart from being the fifth election, the election was historic and will ever remains so for its uniqueness. The votes received by General Mohammadu Buhari (Rtd) was the most nationally spread votes cast since Nigeria's political independence in 1960 and secondly, for the first time in Post Independence Nigeria a Presidential Candidate (General Muhammadu Buhari, Rtd) defeated an incumbent President (Dr Goodluck Ebelle Jonathan) in a presidential poll. This paper therefore, heavily relied on documentary evidences from books, journals, conferences, seminars as well as on printing and electronic media and other related previous relevant literatures provides an explanatory discussion on the reasons behind the defeat of Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan by General Muhammadu Buhari (Rtd) at the 2015 Presidential race.\n\nPolitical power to the people is the key to democracy. The famous Abraham Lincoln saying, government of the people, for the people and by the people, provides the basic structure of a democratic system. If the general masses are the custodian of power, then there must be a mechanism which should make the people the trustee of power. Election of the person or group of persons to exercise that power is the mechanism needed for the system. Nigerians love democracy. After much trial and tribulation, they have adopted a presidential democratic system. The next Presidential election in Nigeria will be held in February 2023. The election process is so lengthy and cumbersome that it takes a year from the day when political parties announce the names of their candidates till a voter comes out from his home to the pooling booth to cast his/ her vote in favor of his chosen candidate. Nigeria is beset with the problems of regionalism, ethnicity, religious favoritism. Cultural diversity, politic...\n\nNigeria is located in African continent. Nigeria had unified north and west in 1914 by Frederick Lugard. October 1, 1990 they declared and recognized as a state.1 In 1963 Nigeria became a republic within the Commonwealth. The capital city of Nigeria is Abuja since 12 December 1991. Before this the capital city of Nigeria was Lagos.

Nnamdi Azikiwe became the republic’s first president. The current president is Goodluck Jonathan who just being elected as a president in May 6, 2010 because of died of President Yar'Adua on 5 May 2010 in the Presidential villa, in Abuja, Nigeria.2 The next presidential election are expected will be held on April 2011.
