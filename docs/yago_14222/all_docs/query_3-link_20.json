        "text": "Reps. Spokesman, because your kinsman was killed the reason for the open display of tears and😭 😭. What about thousands of people killed by these same Fulani invaders in Southern Kaduna, Plateau and Benue? On Christmas Eve, more than 200 helpless Plateau indigenes were killed, did you 😭 on their behalf? For us to live, Nigeria must die. For Nigeria to live, Nigerians must die for the Fulani to own Nigeria. The choice is entirely ours as there is no amount of crying 😭 that will stop the Fulani Jihad on Nigerians. The only thing that can stop ⛔ them, today, January 31, 2024, is if we collectively join the NINAS Movement in decommissioning and dismantling the 1999 Constitution. Reps spokesman crying is not the solution, keep working with the 1999 Constitution and watch your people become victims of the Fulani invaders. Anyway, those who do not want to fall victim to the Fulani Terrorists should join 👉NINAS -www.ninasvoice.org to Take Down the 1999 Constitution\n\nThere is something so many people have not really understood from this new national anthem. Nigeria National Anthem: \"Nigeria we hail thee, Our own dear native land, Though tribe and tongue may differ, In brotherhood we stand, Nigerians all, and *proud to serve* *Our sovereign Motherland* Our flag shall be a symbol That truth and justice reign, In peace or battle honour’d, And this we count as gain, To hand on to our children A banner without stain. O God of all creation, Grant this our one request, Help us to build a nation Where no man is oppressed, And so with peace and plenty Nigeria may be blessed\" This was the national anthem during the colonial government. The pledge was to proudly serve* *Our sovereign Motherland* which is England. The new national anthem talked about serving our fatherland which is Nigeria . I can perceive conspiracy theory in this new anthem. Some people are committed to taking us back to Egypt. With this new anthem, we pledge to serve our motherland which is ENGLAND instead of our Fatherland which is NIGERIA. Is it that our leaders are up to something or are they acting based on ignorance?\n\nNavigating your 20s can feel overwhelming, especially in the dynamic environment of Nigeria. The journey often seems filled with frustration and doubt. I recently saw a friend’s success on social media and felt an immediate wave of envy. But then I reminded myself of a powerful verse: Jeremiah 29:11 – “For I know the plans I have for you… plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” In Nigeria, we’ve faced significant challenges, including the recent #EndBadGovernance protests. Despite these hurdles, our spirit remains unbroken. It’s crucial to trust the process and understand that every setback is a setup for a comeback. As the Yoruba proverb says, “Órò àgbà ni ń f’óró tán ara rẹ̀.” (The wisdom of the elders is always relevant.) Let’s not be intimidated by others’ success but instead, celebrate it. Each of us has our unique path. Let’s stay resilient, support each other, and trust that our time to shine is coming. #TrustTheProcess #Resilience #EndBadGovernance #NaijaSpirit\n\nDo you understand why no foreign news outlet are allowed in Gaza??? The amount of destruction is beyond imaginable. The terror state of Israel has reduced to a rubble the whole strip. Nothing is left. They have and they are committing so many war crimes, I feel sick only thinking about them.Yet, the international community is doing nothing to defend civilians in Gaza. Over 13,000 children have been murdered by the occupation forces. How can people carry on with their lives and not even spending a word on this GENOCIDE? Are they not human beings? The Western mainstream media has spent so much effort in dehumanising Arabs and Muslims, and people just fell for it. Isn't a child from Gaza not the same as a child in Ukraine??? Your silence means complicity in the genocide. If you wonder how you would have behaved during Nazi Germany, you are doing it now. And we wonder how the Holocaust happened? History is repeating itself and the world learnt nothing. This hasn't started on October the 7th. It started long time ago, for over 75 years Palestinians have been subject to the oppression and forced displacement by the terror state of Israel, born in 1948 as a consequence of violent acts of genocide. End the Apartheid, end the occupation, end the genocide NOW. The key is education. Educate yourselves! Palestine has been illegally occupied for decades. When occupation is the law, resistance is a duty. #freepalestine #endapartheid #endoccupation #ceasefireingazanow\n\nDear Friends, 23 years ago Jazz for Peace™ brought as Israeli’s, Palestinians and Americans together at the United Nations.

Here's the thing: you've already been ian enabler to the problems that we've been having.\n\nTHE PEOPLE👨👩👧👦 VS THE GOVERNMENT👨✈️👨✈️. If you have seen the newest short film acted by Mofe Duncan and Rita Edwards, you will be in a relative state to this write up. The film depicts the double edged nature of Nigeria’s problems🪃 The boomerang effect that is reoccurring in the country. The government stands on “…if I do, una go talk. If I no do, una go talk…” because it depicts their frustration. It also says “…when election come, dey go tan da for house…then your people wey come vote go line up make me arrange with wrappa, rice and onions…and then you blame me for lack of power…” It claims “I am not corrupt!” 🤷🏾 On the other hand, the people say “…YES! We supported, voted and put you in that chair, we are rice, tied wrappa but wetin we for do, when we know say na every 4 years you go remember say we be your people too” “…how you go flog pikin tell am say make e no cry?” And they claim, “I am not corrupt!” 🤷🏽♀️ **************************************** As a fellow Nigerian writing from an objective perspective, I have questions. Who, then, is corrupt? 🤔 Who is the problem of Nigeria? The government, the people or both? 🤔 Should our actions be justified upon these excuses? 🤔 Today is the 1st of August. The day planned to begin the protest. How many lives will be lost?🤔 Are the people justified to protest? 🤔 Or is this not a situation for both sides to realize that they are both at fault, beginning with the government, as the father of the house, and coming together for mutual understanding?🤔 What do you think? Let’s discuss in the comment below 👇 May God save the nation!✊ You can find the video here: https://lnkd.in/dN7gwxJw #nigeria #nigerianleadership #governance #thepeopleofnigeria #peace #peacefulprotest #nigerianprotest #prayfornigeria\n\nFrom A Drug Lord To Presidency..The NIGERIA SORRY FAILED STATE STORY. Dumping your indigenous National Anthem for a colonial hymn in austerity time, is all the proof you need. Old men were feeling nostalgic; they were craving for the good ol' days. So they decided it was okay to force a colonial song down your throats. There’s little hint of austerity in those in charge of Nigeria. But how did we even get here? This is by far the sickest Executive + National Assembly since 1960. And I've put it mildly. To mark his First Year in Office, a Peter Obi won’t have signed a National Anthem Bill. Rather, he would have addressed Nigerians, & engaged the media LIVE. There'll be no prerecorded broadcast. Obi would have held at least 6 LIVE Media Chats within his first year. Foreign Investors & Diaspora Nigerians won't have to rely on surrogates & on gangsters to know his body language. There'll be clear-cut policies on everything. No one will have to second-guess his every move. Indeed, THE PRESIDENT MATTERS! Now tell me why Bola Tinubu did not address Nigerians & possibly engage with the media to mark his First Year in Office? All we got were some chaotic announcements from his media gansters. No regard for Nigerians & that office. Nigeria devalued its orphaned Naira (₦), & floated it for them as well. Nigeria raised interest rates 3x for them. Nigerians suffer the consequences of the attendant inflation & the stagflation, all at once. You have become poorer for them as well. What more does the IMF & the World Bank want? Bola Tinubu is not his own man. He'll continue to do the bidding of those that put him there. This is why Nigerians voted for Peter Obi. No country makes economic policies for foreign investors. You only need to make your country conducive for investments, & investors will come. You rollout sound economic policies for the benefit of your people. Foreign investors come when they see that those policies will favor them. Bigotry won't attract investors by the way; it won't make TotalEnegies & other foreign brands to increase their stakes. Propaganda made things worse. Investors don’t know who to believe when the presidential media gangsters are singing from different hymn books. Electricity, the fundamentals & the infrastructures are lacking; WE KNOW THAT! But other African countries that lack these structures are receiving massive investments. Maybe the old National Anthem will bring back those investors, & stabilize the orphaned Naira as well? Angola, Congo, Tanzania, Botswana, Mauritius, Kenya, Rwanda & others, are no bigger than Nigeria in size & GDP. But investors are pouring in there; leaving Nigeria in the cold. So it is more about the Economic Management Team than the absence or lack of structures. At the end of the day, credibility & legitimacy are all to play for. No civilized nation can accept what we digest in Nigeria, even IF Tinubu reintroduce Slavery people will just complain and move on. We Hail thee"
