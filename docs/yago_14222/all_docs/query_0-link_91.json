        "text": "The wife of former President Musa Yar’Adua, Hajiya Turai Yar’Adua has revealed details of the last moment of her husband on earth and how he later died.\n\nAccording to her, she had been fasting every day since her husband took ill, and on that particular day that her husband died she was about to go and break her fast but as she was about to leave him, she felt like he didn’t want her to leave his side.\n\nShe narrated that shortly after she left her husband’s side to break her fast, she was called back and met the former President struggling to breathe.\n\nAccording to her, she has never forgotten that moment and even blames herself for leaving his side when she did.\n\nNaija News recalls Yaradua is a former Nigerian president who died in office on 5th May, 2010\n\n”I was fasting on that day. In fact, I’ve been fasting nonstop from when he fell ill, even after he died I did not stop. So when it was time for me to break my fast, he was lying down looking at me.\n\n“I felt he does not want me to leave. I told him I was going to break my fast. He then shook his head and I left. I was later called and I met him struggling with his breath. That moment still lingers in my mind. I even queried myself on why I left to break my fast, I should’ve stayed,” Turai stated in an interview on Saturday with BBC Hausa.\n\nOn how she felt after what happened, she explained that ” I’m a Muslim. I know life and death are realities. I know Allah gives and takes life. So what can I do ? I can only thank Allah who gave me and had taken away. I can’t be angry with Him for taking his life. Praise be to Allah.”\n\nI Still Miss Him\n\nDuring the interview, the former first lady revealed that she still misses her husband.\n\nShe said, “Praise be to Allah. I don’t feel anything. I’m used to it. I think about him every day. Every day seems like any other day. The only difference is that today; people gathered to pray for him, eulogize him and I’m happy. I thank them.”\n\nHe Wasn’t Corrupt\n\nTurai added that all through the life of her husband, he was a very simple man who wasn’t concerned about amassing worldly wealth.\n\n“He was simple. He was not carried away by worldly things. For example, he can be using a wrist watch continously until the strap gets broken into two.\n\n“Unless if I see it, he would continue to use it like that. He was a very simple person who did not attach importance to worldly things. Even leadership, Allah destined he would be but he wasn’t that ambitious about it.”\n\nShe explained that they had a close and happy marriage.\n\nOn the happy moments with him, she said, “Our marriage was full of happiness. In fact people were saying they had never seen our kind of relationship. I was like a new bride everyday. That was why he always returned home straight, from the office.\n\n“So, even if I travelled, once I reached my destination he would be the first person I would call. That was what I really missed. The first time I travelled and no one called me to say “Turai how was your trip?” That was the first time I cried over his death.”\n\nLife After Office\n\nThe former first lady said she wasn’t too much involved in political activities and she only went to the office when there is work to be done.\n\nShe said, “Thanks be to Allah. Even while in government, I was not deeply involved. In my life, I value the home front. I was with my children and grand children. If you see me going to the First Lady’s office, then there was work to be done.\n\n“If there’s no work to be done, I can stay home for 3 months without going to the office. I belonged to the home and even after his death, I continued looking after the children and grand children. I thank Allah, they are all very successful. None has gone astray. I thank Allah for that.”\n\nOn Goodluck Jonathan And Politics\n\nOn her relationship with his political associates particularly during President Jonathan’s administration after her husband’s death, she said, “We thank Allah. We’ve been together. But truly, I’m a woman who does not involve myself in affairs that are not mine. Even after his death, most of my children were in London studying. So most of the time I was there. But if I meet them, we exchange pleasantries as normal. But truly, there’s no problem.”\n\nThe former first lady added that she didn’t get herself involved in politics after her husband died.\n\n“No no, I don’t. I knew what’s politics. I was in politics during my school days when my husband was President of Katsina Students Union. I was an executive member. I was in politics since then. But when Umaru died, my politics also died. But the children and grand children, by the will of Allah.”\n\nBe Patient"
