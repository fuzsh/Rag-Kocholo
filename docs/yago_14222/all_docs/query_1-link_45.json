No one has seen him in public since November.\n\nBut in the latest odd twist, a group of religious leaders in Nigeria claim to have met the president, with whom they offered prayers but didn’t speak. He appeared to be conscious, or \"in his senses,\" as one put it.\n\nMeanwhile, Sahara Reporters, a diaspora-based news site that has a knack for being right, reports that Yar’Adua’s wife, Turai, is on a push to convince the country that her husband is nearly well — and well be back, as Nigerians like to say, \"any moment from now.\" (I will leave it to your imagination what kind of timeline that indicates. Translate it literally and you’ll be pretty close… literally any moment, from now until….)"
