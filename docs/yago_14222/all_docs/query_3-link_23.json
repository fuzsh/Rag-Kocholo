        "text": "Hajiya Turai and Hajiya Hauwa Yar’Adua are unhappy women. This is because Nigeria has forgotten the late former president, like the dust and silence of the upper shelf. Turai’s heart bleeds like a freshly bruised vein as you read. And the reason is not farfetched. Six years after her beloved husband, former President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, died after a protracted ailment, Nigerians seem to have forgotten him. As the two women in his life mark the sixth anniversary of their husband’s death, they wonder if memories of Yar’Adua and his legacies as a former president and governor of Katsina State have eroded with the passage of time.\n\nSources close to Hajia Turai revealed that it was heartrending for her to note that memories of her husband have faded from the hearts of even his trusted aides and political associates while he was Head of State. It was even more heartbreaking to note that no newspaper or broadcast station remembered the milestone in the life of the Yar’Aduas. There was no paid advertorial in remembrance of the late president who was widely regarded as a gentleman and unpretentious statesman.\n\nIt was only the immediate family members of the former president who died on May 5, 2010, that were in London last week to hold special prayers to mark the sixth anniversary of his demise. A source in the family said they were led by Yar’Adua’s widow, Hajiya Turai and offered special prayers for the repose of the former Nigerian leader’s soul. Yar’Adua’s former wife, Hajiya Hauwa, who is also in London, said they also converged to remember the former president as part of activities marking the anniversary of his death.\n\nSimply Herbert! The Perfection of a brilliant banker, Herbert Wigwe\n\nAngels fly because they take themselves lightly. They do not think too much of themselves, so does Herbert Wigwe, the MD of Access Bank. Like an angel, Herbert takes himself very lightly despite his socio-economic weight. He wears his badge of temperance and humility in the shape of a bow of ribbon; thus affirming that he isn’t what many of his disparagers make him out to be. Contrary to misconceptions about his character, Herbert, according to sources close to him, is actually a modest, compassionate, accommodating and understanding man.\n\nHis only shortcoming if at all it could be considered ‘shortcoming,’ is his lack of tolerance for sycophancy, bribery or any form of corruption. The miracle-working banker is more of polished diamond among the rough, tarnished czars of Nigeria’s banking industry. It is often said that he who rides the tides of industry influences the thought of his times. Eventually, he commands the epochs that follow and impresses his name on eternity. Such an individual no doubt sways the applause of listening Senates. If he is cut of the rare stock that Wigwe hails from, he effortlessly attracts the patronage of leaders of men.\n\nHerbert like most great men, did not attain his current height by sudden flight. While most of his rivals and other peers slept, he was toiling upward day and night. As head honcho of Access Bank, Wigwe understands the need to abide by the company’s corporate philosophy which is to become the world’s most respected African bank, thus he would never engage in any act or association that would be inimical to the progress and good image of his organisation.\n\nRich, spoilt, dead! The pain of a father\n\nChildren are meant to be bearers of joy and everlasting bliss to their parents. But Ibrahim Uwais became a harbinger of pain and misery to his parents thus stifling their joy and harming their reputation. The late son of former Chief Justice Mohammed Uwais unfurled like a blemish on his father’s reputation when he turned radical and joined deadly terrorist sect, ISIS, in 2015. Recently, Ibrahim suffered excruciating death on his deadly campaign with ISIS mates. Consequently, his father is heartbroken. There is no gainsaying sadness invaded the household of the retired legal luminary when news of his son’s enlistment with ISIS broke out but at his death, Justice Uwais and the entire family are devastated.\n\nLate Ibrahim Uwais left Nigeria in 2015, telling close family members he was travelling to Turkey to explore business opportunities. He took along his two wives and five kids. However, he slipped from Turkey into Syria with his entire family and joined the burgeoning army of volunteer fighters who travel from different parts of the world to enlist with ISIS, a group whose agenda is to carve out an Islamist caliphate.\n\nJust like Alhaji Abdulmutallab whose son, Umar Farouk, attempted to blow up an American plane in flight, Justice Uwais cared and loved his son dearly. He gave him the best education and treated him to the finest luxury money could buy. However, after spending lavishly on Ibrahim, the latter chose the path of dishonour to the consternation of his father and other loved ones."
