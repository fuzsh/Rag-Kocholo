As a result of the Strategic Review instigated by the Board, Pinewood now has the prospect of a funding structure for the future.\n\n\"The Board is encouraged by the commitment Bidco has already shown to management, to Pinewood's strategy for growth, and to the future of the iconic Pinewood Studios.\n\n\"The Board believes that this transaction provides our shareholders with an attractive offer. Moreover the Board believes that following the transaction, Pinewood and clients will benefit from greater opportunities in the years ahead and the Board intends to recommend the offer unanimously.\"\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\nFour ingredients that helped Mahindra Thar leave Maruti Jimny and Jeep Wrangler behind\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
