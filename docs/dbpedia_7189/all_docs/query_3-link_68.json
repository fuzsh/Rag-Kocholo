        "text": "The BFI, filmmakers and industry leaders today overwhelmingly welcomed the introduction of a 53% expenditure credit (equating to a tax relief of approximately 40%) for UK film productions with a budget up to £15m.\n\nThe intervention was announced today in the Government’s Spring Budget to support this vital, but severely challenged, part of the UK’s film industry. This follows work from the BFI and industry and Pact’s proposal to model how tax relief could be made more effective and is welcomed by filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Emma Thomas, Idris Elba, Tilda Swinton, Edgar Wright, Mike Leigh, Andrew Haigh, Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Barbara Broccoli, David Heyman, Kenneth Branagh, Daniel Kaluuya, Danny Boyle, Riz Ahmed, Gurinder Chadha, Sam Mendes, Steve McQueen, Elizabeth Karlsen, Alex Garland, Alfonso Cuaron, Andrea Arnold, Asif Kapadia, Emerald Fennell, Gareth Edwards, Joanna Hogg, Joe Cornish, Nida Manzoor, Paul Greengrass, Paul King, Andrew ‘Rapman’ Onwubolu, Richard Curtis, Ridley Scott, Steven Knight and David Puttnam.\n\n“The Government’s new tax credit is a game changer for UK filmmakers, creating jobs and ensuring great British stories continue to be told,” says Jay Hunt, BFI Chair. “By introducing the uplifted rate, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor are fuelling the growth of the wider screen sector that contributes billions to the UK economy.”\n\nBen Roberts, BFI Chief Executive, says: “This is a dramatic moment for UK film, and the most significant policy intervention since the 1990s. The positive impact will be felt across our industry, and through all the new films that audiences will get to enjoy. The films we make are vital to our culture expression and creativity — they reflect a diverse and global Britain, and build careers — and we’re grateful to Government, the DCMS, the industry and our friends at Pact for working together to realise this historic initiative.”\n\nThis uplift in the expenditure credit is for UK films with a budget up to £15m range (with either a UK writer, or UK director, or certified as an official UK co-production) marks a transformative moment for the sector as producers and filmmakers have increasingly struggled to finance films at this level and get them into production in the UK. Films that meet the criteria will be able to claim an increased Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC) at 53% (up from 34%) from 1 April 2024. This recognises the crucial role that making these films play in the whole ecosystem of film – from creative risk-taking and telling stories that reflect the diversity of the UK, to developing talent working both in front of and behind the camera. (The AVEC replaces the Film Tax Relief rate which has provided 25% of qualifying UK expenditure on up to 80% of a film’s total production budget. The AVEC at 53% equates to a relief rate of approximately 40% under the Film Tax Relief.)\n\nBFI statistics show that overseas investment in film and high-end television production in the UK has grown significantly in recent years, and last year accounted for 78% of the total £4.23 billion spent on making new productions in the UK. However, getting UK films into production budgeted under £15m has become increasingly challenging. In 2023, the spend on making UK domestic films dropped to £150m, just over 11% of the total £1.36bn spent on making new films in the UK; this downturn followed an even sharper 31% decrease in spend on the previous year. Within a highly competitive global market for film production, where countries worldwide are offering increased tax incentives, UK films are having to consider going overseas if they are to be made. As a consequence, this would limit opportunities across the UK for crews, production services and locations at a time when the sector is seeing significant investment in state-of-the-art production facilities.\n\nThe complexity of the challenges facing the sector has been investigated through BFI-published research and evidence, including An Economic Review of UK Independent Film (2022). The review recommended an increase in film tax relief specifically for independent film, would have a significant positive impact and far-reaching positive impacts for the wider sector. This report also built on the BFI’s Commission on UK Independent Film, published in 2018, which highlighted seismic shifts in the industry which were impacting UK independent film more acutely.\n\nFollowing the recommendations in An Economic Review of UK Independent Film producer organisation Pact undertook detailing modelling on how the film tax relief could be made to work even more effectively for films with production budgets up to £15m, working closely with the BFI and UK Government. Modelling concluded that a 53% AVEC (approximately 40% under the Film Tax Relief) would deliver significant benefit for the UK independent film sector.\n\n“I’m pleased that the Government has recognised the important role the British independent film sector plays in developing key talent and sustaining jobs across the economy,” says John McVay OBE, Pact CEO. “The sector has reached a critical point and this intervention will provide a lifeline to indie film producers by allowing them to access funding which will attract key creative talent and in turn give them the ability to recoup their initial investment.”\n\nThe package of measures announced today as part of the Government’s Budget also a 40% relief on gross business rates bills for eligible film studios in England, until 203; funding for an extension at the UK’s world-leading National Film and Television School; and a 5% increase in tax relief for UK visual effects costs in film and high-end TV, under the Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC). UK visual effects costs will be exempt from the AVEC’s 80% cap on qualifying expenditure\n\nProducers and filmmakers who have created some of the most loved films by audiences and have showcased UK filmmaking talent and creativity have universally welcomed the new level of tax relief independent UK films.\n\nComments from industry and filmmakers\n\nChristopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, writer/director and producer, nominated for 13 Oscars for Oppenheimer:\n\n“Independent and lower-budget filmmaking is where we had our start and where new voices and innovations vital to the entire industry are born. This enhanced tax relief builds on the incredible work already being done by British filmmakers and will create new opportunities for British crews, filmmakers and cast members for years to come.“\n\nBarbara Broccoli CBE, producer, Eon Productions, Film Stars Don’t Die In Liverpool, Ear For Eye, Bond films:\n\n“The support for independent filmmaking announced by the Prime Minister and Chancellor today is game changing. It will ensure that our screen industry will continue to thrive by giving opportunities to a diversity of new talent both on and off the screen for future generations of filmmakers.”\n\nAndrew Haigh, director, All Of Us Strangers, 45 Years, Weekend:\n\n“Like many independent films, mine can feel very personal. But I think the reason that my latest film All Of Us Strangers has found an audience is because it’s really about human relationships and how we communicate and connect with each other. Getting films made is always tough, and I’m lucky that I get to make my films here and work with incredible actors and crew. This investment in filmmaking in the UK is great news and feels like a vote of confidence — we have such an amazing legacy to be proud of, and continue.”\n\nSteve McQueen, writer/director, Hunger, 12 Years A Slave, Widows:\n\n“I strongly back the proposal for enhanced tax relief for low budget independent films. Independent films are extremely important.”\n\nRiz Ahmed, actor/writer Sound of Metal, Fingernails, The Night Of, The Long Goodbye:\n\n“Independent film is so important for freedom of expression here in the UK. It’s a space where creators have liberty to pursue their artistic vision, to spotlight stories that might otherwise be sidelined, and to showcase new talent from underrepresented groups. It affords us the opportunity to explore different narratives of Britishness. At a time when it’s become increasingly difficult to get independent films financed, this additional support will be vital to ensure the dynamism and influence of British artists on the global stage.”\n\nJonathan Glazer, writer/director, The Zone of Interest nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director:\n\n“There’s a risk we are not nurturing the creative filmmakers of tomorrow as it’s increasingly hard to finance films at this budget level in the UK. I welcome the additional support which would ensure and enable creativity and risk taking.”\n\nJim Wilson, producer of The Zone Of Interest nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director:\n\n“It’s more difficult than ever to finance UK independent films right now, which is saying something. This additional support is absolutely crucia in such a tough landscape. Creatively-driven UK films are vital and, as The Zone of Interest shows, supporting risk-taking projects (via the tax credit?) can create films that successfully reach and connect with UK and international audiences.”\n\nTim Bevan and Eric Fellner, Co-Chairman of Working Title Films:\n\n“We’ve been proud to make UK independent films for over 40 years, working with brilliant UK talent to create films that showcase the complexity, obsessions, humanity and humour of British lives and characters. This lower budget vibrant and creative industry which nurtures and develops often first-time talent is sadly increasingly in crisis, so this additional support targeted directly at the issue is vital in ensuring filmmakers can continue to take risks and produce creatively driven UK films that connect with audiences and showcase crucial parts of our culture.”\n\nGareth Edwards, director, The Creator, Godzilla, Monsters:\n\n“Watching Star Wars as a child, I always assumed blockbuster filmmaking was just a distant dream for someone growing up in the UK. But then, as I watched the behind the scenes, I suddenly realised it was all filmed in a studio just outside of London. And that making ambitious commercial films is totally within the reach of British filmmakers. When I finally got to make my first film Monsters, it was made in the true independent style – with a small cast and crew, a tiny budget and shot in just a few weeks. I learnt so much, so fast, and would definitely describe it was one of the most creative experiences I’ve ever had. Without that opportunity I would never have been given Godzilla, Star Wars and The Creator… And now as we organise shooting the new Jurassic Park film in ‘a studio just outside London’, I hope we inspire other new filmmakers to shoot small, but always dream big.”\n\nGurinder Chadha, director, Bend It Like Beckham, Viceroy’s House, Bhaji On The Beach, Bride & Prejudice, Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging:\n\n“Working in independent film is where I have built my career and without the support of public funding, it simply would not have been possible for me to make films such British films as Bend It Like Beckham, Bride & Prejudice and Bhaji On The Beach — films that celebrate our lives and how we seen ourselves as a rich and beautifully diverse nation. What today’s momentous news has the power to do is to open the door wider and enable more talented filmmakers with the imagination, creativity and skills to make great films, that not only reflect and contributing to both society and to the success of the wider film industry. Thank you for listening to us.”\n\nElizabeth Karlsen, producer, Living, Carol, Colette, The Crying Game:\n\n“Based on three decades working in independent film in the UK I can say with absolute confidence that this announcement will have a profoundly positive and far reaching impact on British independent film; nurturing new talent, supporting established talent and ensuring our global reputation for producing outstanding cinema. The creative and economic benefits will be felt through the industry and beyond. I am delighted and look forward to working many more years in an industry I love. Everyone who has worked so hard on and supported this incentive deserves an enormous thank you.”\n\nMike Leigh, director, Peterloo, Mr. Turner, Another Year:\n\n“I’ve been making independent British films for over 50 years; I’ve made nearly thirty of them. All my stories are about real people and the way we live our lives — stories that can only be told through independent film. But getting independent films made has always been hard, and it’s getting harder. We have so much talent here in the UK and I want to see our film industry stay truly creative, enabling filmmakers to take risks. Young filmmakers must have support, encouragement and proper unconditional funding. We must bring through new voices with things to say that are going to change and challenge our views. Having this extra support is going to go a long way to making sure that happens.”\n\nMolly Manning Walker, writer/director How To Have Sex; cinematographer Scrapper:\n\n“As a filmmaker all I want to do is put the money on screen. There is no way How To Have Sex would have been the film it is without a 40% tax credit in Greece. Currently I am finding it almost impossible to shoot my films in the UK because money goes so much further elsewhere. Lots of the successful debut films in the last few years have shot out of the UK: Aftersun, How To Have Sex, Earth Mama. It is a shame that I’m constantly looking for stories away from home. I am encouraged by the new support announced today, as I truly believe that when you’re already working with a small budget the extra boost pushes your work into another level.”\n\nPaul King, director, Wonka, Paddington films, Bunny And The Bull:\n\n“I made my first feature film, Bunny and the Bull, with a small budget and a passionate young team. It gave me and many others a fantastic opportunity to learn and develop, and there is no way I could have made Paddington 1 or 2 or Wonka without that experience, so I am so delighted about this news.”\n\nIdris Elba, director/actor, Yardie, Beast, Mandala: Long Walk To Freedom:\n\n“Independent films are a training ground for talent and an opportunity to show the world who we are. We have some of the best loved filmmakers out there but these films are becoming almost impossible to make and we risk losing them completely — so this support is great news, and will have a massive impact on our British film culture.”\n\nJacqueline Durran, costume designer, Barbie, Allelujah, The Batman, 1917, Peterloo:\n\n“Making films in the UK has offered me the most amazing range of costume design challenges — from period dramas with Joe Wright, to the huge scale of The Batman and Barbie. Like so many others, my career began in independent film, and in my case working with Mike Leigh, who I’m still fortunate to work with. I’m delighted that the government has decided to provide this additional support for our brilliant industry.”\n\nRuth Wilson, actor, See How They Run, True Things, Dark River, The Little Stranger, Locke, Suite Francaise, Saving Mr. Banks:\n\n“As an actor and filmmaker I know how important it is to tell stories that truly reflect who we are — in all our messy, complicated glory. Stories that push boundaries and make people think and care and see themselves on screen. Independent films are where these stories are told best, where we see a true reflection of British culture, and where new exciting talent is discovered so it is a relief to know that there is now economic support to help them continue to thrive.”\n\nPaul Greengrass, director, News Of The World, Jason Bourne, United 93, Bloody Sunday:\n\n“Whatever the size of the budget, I try to make all my films with the same approach that I used making television and independent films earlier in my career, basing them wherever possible here in the UK. UK talent — both in front and behind camera — is the secret of the success of our industry and it’s so important that we continue to develop the next generation. This announcement is great news for filmmaking full stop, but most of all because it will create so many more career opportunities across the industry.”\n\nPippa Harris, producer, Empire Of Light, 1917, Revolutionary Road:\n\n“Independent film making in the U.K. is a vital part of our creative economy, allowing new, diverse and exhilarating stories to be told. This intervention is hugely welcomed and will support investment in lower budget movies, creating much needed employment and bringing joy to audiences around the world.”\n\nRebecca O’Brien, producer, The Old Oak, I, Daniel Blake, Lynn + Lucy, You Were Never Really Here:\n\nThis hugely welcomed and timely fiscal uplift to support independent film production provides an essential lifeline to our struggling sector. Our indigenous films tell us stories about ourselves and our culture and we’ve been struggling for many years to be able to afford to make them. This intervention provides the industry with the impetus to revive and provides much needed support for jobs and creativity which will boost the whole industry and entice new people into this exciting work.\n\nSir Ridley Scott, director, The Duellists:\n\n“Expanding tax relief to support UK independent film has never been more needed if this vital part of the industry is to survive and thrive. Over the course of my career I’ve seen how creativity is born and lives within independent filmmaking, and has been intrinsic to the industry’s growth and success; as well as being the source of important stories that matter to society. It also happens to be something we do spectacularly well – expanding tax relief will help ensure we continue the pipeline of great British stories and talent, both in front of and behind the camera.”\n\nRosie Alison, producer, Paddington films, Wonka, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas:\n\n“Lower budget independent films always have been and will continue to be the crucial seedbed of UK cinema. The place where film makers can first find their voice. The top three films at the UK box office over the last year (Barbie, Wonka, Oppenheimer) were all made by distinctive writer-directors who began with a small independent film. Without the expansion of the tax relief as a way to support UK indie cinema, the lifeblood of the industry will drain away. It is so clear that to support UK indie cinema is to support the future of our film industry.”\n\nAndrea Cornwell, producer Love Lies Bleeding, Saint Maud, Apostasy:\n\n“An enhanced UK tax credit is a vital intervention that will allow British producers to boost employment, attract outside investment, and showcase British creativity to audiences on the world stage. It will allow stories to be told about ourselves, with the vital resources to make our films more successful creative exports, and hence build a stronger and more stable industry.”\n\nDavid Puttnam, producer, Chariots Of Fire, Local Hero, Midnight Express, The Mission:\n\n“Fifty years ago, as a young producer trying to forge a career, I was hugely enabled by Government support then available in the form of the Eady Fund. Today’s young producers, already doing better work than I ever aspired to, need a similar boost if they’re to deliver the success the industry needs, and the nation craves for. The need is critical, the moment is now.”\n\nDavid Parfitt, producer The Father, My Week With Marilyn, Shakespeare In Love; Chair of North East Screen:\n\n“Independent film is in desperate need of support despite its global reputation and I am delighted that the Government has stepped up at this critical time – a successful industry will pay back in spades.”\n\nEdgar Wright, director/producer (Last Night in Soho, Baby Drive, Shaun of the Dead):\n\n“I owe my career to independent film in Britain, and love making films in the UK to this day. So many of the talented cast and crew that I’ve worked with have gone on to have great international success, and indie films are where it all starts. It has definitely become increasing difficult to make independent films in recent years, so this is brilliant news and will a huge difference to so many existing and aspiring filmmakers.”\n\nTim Davie, Director-General of the BBC:\n\n“We welcome this additional support and recognition of the cultural and economic importance of supporting stories and talent from across the UK, which is so central to the BBC’s work.”\n\nEva Yates, Director, BBC Film:\n\n“This is fantastic news for independent filmmakers and all those who care about bringing ambitious, authentic UK stories to the screen. I hope today’s news will boost confidence in this most creative and dynamic of sectors, and provide some welcome relief for the many independent producers who have worked through unprecedented challenges in recent years to create work of international acclaim. We commend the work of Pact and the BFI in making the case for this vital intervention. This is an exciting moment for UK film and creativity.”\n\nAlex Mahon, CEO of Channel 4:\n\n“I very much welcome the Chancellor’s announcement today to introduce an enhanced tax relief for lower budget British independent films. This much needed intervention, which really recognises British filmmaking, will enable Film4 to continue to nurture and work with the most distinctive and innovative talent in the UK. It is not only important for jobs but will help ensure the future sustainability of the British film industry and enable culturally significant films to continue to be made.”\n\nOllie Madden, Director of Film4:\n\n“We warmly welcome the Government’s commitment to introduce an enhanced tax relief for British independent film. This is a vital move that will provide a major boost to filmmaking across the country, help grow commercially successful, British-owned intellectual property, and strengthen the foundations of the UK’s vibrant film production sector.”\n\nFaye Ward, producer, Rocks, Suffragette, Stan & Ollie, Wild Rose:\n\n“We have a magnificent history of film making and talents in Britain, in front of and behind the camera. It’s important that we continue telling British stories. The indie sector is a true gateway to new voices and will continue to highlight a range of diverse talent.”\n\nDominic Buchanan, Co-CEO/producer, Lilting, The End Of The F***ing World:\n\n“This is such wonderful news, the transformative effect this will have is immediate, it gives everyone in the industry confidence to truly invest in British talent at the level needed to stay competitive; especially those inclusive voices, which are often seen as risky. It allows producers like myself to help sustain, and in fact grow our businesses.”\n\nCharlotte Regan, writer/director, Scrapper:\n\n“The British film industry is at the forefront of diverse risk-taking cinema. British cinema is unique, its joyful, it’s sad its cinematic. It makes you feel everything. I want to be a part of a world where we’re supporting those voices and forging a world where people with no connection to the industry are allowed to create and be a part of it. The new enhanced tax relief can be a big part of creating that world. It’s what allows small independent producers to tell new interesting stories. It’s what brings work to the industry for local crew. It’s essential.”\n\nKevin Loader, producer, The Lady in the Van, The Death of Stalin, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry:\n\n“British independent films have been one of the great success stories of the last thirty years, from My Beautiful Launderette to All of Us Strangers. Recent failures in the financing model have made them an endangered species — which is depriving British audiences of the chance to see their culture and lives on screen, and losing the opportunity to connect worldwide audiences to Britain, its history and its present. Increasing the tax credit for culturally British films in the mid-budget range will keep ensure these films continue to be made for today’s generation. Many of us are seriously modelling making our UK-set films in Hungary, Austria or Australia, all of which have more generous tax reliefs in place than the UK — which is where we would most like to be creating jobs and supporting businesses.”\n\nHakan Kousetta, executive producer, Slow Horses, Hijack and The Essex Serpent:\n\n“This is a brilliantly timed and welcomed intervention by Government. A thriving independent film sector is a vital part of the industry ecology. It’s where myself and many others started our careers and is essential if we are to continue to beget some the world’s best screen talent both behind and in front of the camera.”\n\nIvana MacKinnon, producer, How to Have Sex, Tuesday, Beast:\n\n“It’s amazing to be able to count on this enhanced support for UK independent film which will enable us to shoot more projects in the UK rather than seeking higher tax credits abroad. This is a much-needed intervention in a sector which is struggling to navigate multiple industry changes, and will help UK producers to support our world class talent and crews.”\n\nJoanna Scanlan, actor, Boat Story, After Love, How To Build A Girl:\n\n“Government’s increased tax relief for independent and lower budget film announced this Budget is a huge and very welcome advance for the creative and cultural industries, so vital to the nation’s economic balance sheet. Most importantly, cinema can continue to delight, mesmerise and illuminate our lives.”\n\nJoy Gharoro-Akpojotor, producer, Boxing Day, Blue Story:\n\n“Independent cinema is a vibrant space where innovation thrives and audiences can find reflections of themselves. This support means that we are able to sustain an industry that both young and old will be able to call home. It also means we can create a sustainable working environment, keeping thousands in jobs.”\n\nOl Parker, director, Ticket to Paradise, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, Now Is Good:\n\n“All I ever want to do with any film, whether I make it independently or with a studio, is to strike a chord with audiences. This news from the government will make a real and positive difference, transforming the landscape of independent filmmaking, and offering not just genuine and much needed support for filmmakers, but the prospect of future British crowd-pleasers to be enjoyed around the world.”\n\nYvonne Isimeme Ibazebo, producer Rye Lane, Top Boy, Guerrilla:\n\n“An increase in the tax relief for smaller, non-studio films will help with financing local productions. We’ve seen with Rye Lane, which I produced with Damian Jones, that UK creatively driven stories can and do punch above their weight. With this new relief, I hope I can support other talented filmmakers like Raine Allen-Miller to create authentically British stories that resonate with audiences around the world.”\n\nAlice Lowe, director/actor, Prevenge, Eternal Beauty, Days Of The Bagnold Summer:\n\n“Lower budget films are the training ground for the talent we have in the UK in spades. It’s essential to give the grassroots filmmakers impetus to generate work in the UK, sowing the seeds of a bigger and more profitable film industry.”\n\nIsabel Davis, Executive Director, Screen Scotland:\n\n“This support comes at a critical time for independent film, and will go a long way to sustaining the creative ecosystem across the UK.”\n\nLee Walters, Chief Executive, Ffilm Cymru Wales:\n\n“Today’s announcement represents an important and exciting intervention in the sector that will deliver real value for our nation of storytellers. These are challenging times for the independent film sector and UK and Welsh filmmakers remain vital cultural voices for audiences to hear.\n\nRichard Williams, Chief Executive, Northern Ireland Screen:\n\n“This hugely welcomed and timely fiscal uplift to support independent film production provides an essential lifeline to our struggling sector. Our indigenous films tell us stories about ourselves and our culture and we’ve been struggling for many years to be able to afford to make them. This intervention provides the industry with the impetus to revive and provides much needed support for jobs and creativity which will boost the whole industry and entice new people into this exciting work.”\n\nFilmmaking talent welcoming the expanded expenditure credit\n\nAdam Ackland, producer (The Courier, The Electrical Life of Louis Wain, The Mauritanian)\n\nAlex Garland, writer/director
