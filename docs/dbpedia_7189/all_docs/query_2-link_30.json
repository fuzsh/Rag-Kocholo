        "text": "The Pinewood Group is looking to build a visitor attraction next to its iconic U.K. studios in Buckinghamshire, famed home to the Star Wars and James Bond franchises.\n\nThe 350,000 sq. ft ‘Pinewood Studio Experience’ — the studio’s first public attraction — is part of a newly proposed Screen Industries Global Growth Hub, called Screen Hub UK, which Pinewood says has a total investment of £450 million ($583 million).\n\nBased on a 77 acre site immediately adjacent to the studios, the hub would also include an educational training and skills hub, a creative industries business growth hub, and a green campus. Pinewood has estimated that the development would create around 3,500 new jobs, and annually add £230 million ($297 million) into the local economy and £125 million ($162 million) into the tourism industry.\n\n“The Government and Buckinghamshire LEP have recognised Pinewood Studios as a major economic asset to be enhanced with the creation of a screen growth hub for the UK. We are pleased to be able to respond with this scheme,” said Pinewood Group chairmen Paul Golding.\n\n“We have been looking at a visitor experience for some time and feel that now is the right moment to bring it forward. The project will strengthen UK film and bring much needed jobs and spending. We hope our planning application will receive widespread support.”\n\nPinewood is preparing the application and will start consultations with the local community and wider stakeholders later this month."
