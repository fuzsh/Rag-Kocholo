        "text": "Can a man truly change? That’s the question short film maker Simon Cookson seeks to answer in his film concept, ‘The Light’, which has won The Pitch, an international short film competition offering £25,000, production support and advice from top industry professionals to develop a short, contemporary film drawing upon the Bible.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nWatch Simon Cookson’s winning entry to The Pitch, here.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nSimon Cookson’s short film idea ‘The Light’ was considered the best by a top industry panel including Oscar winning animator Nick Park. Simon’s story is based on the conversion of Saul on the road to Damascus. It is set in American in the 1950s during the Red Scare era. A police lieutenant rejects his former oppressive ways, but realises the biggest struggle will be to convince everyone else he’s truly a changed man.\n\nPresenting Simon with his trophy at Pinewood Studios, Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park said, “this is my fourth year on the jury – the standard of storytelling is going up each year. The Bible is full of interesting characters which is brilliant material to base films on.”\n\n“I’m still in a dream – it feels amazing!” said Cookson. “I adore this story so can’t wait now to get to work on developing it further.”\n\nLuke Walton, project director for The Pitch added, “Simon stood out to the judges with his particularly fresh original context. By going back to the McCarthy era in the States, I think was a clever way of replaying the story of Paul. He’s a talented young man.”\n\nStory first published in ‘Word in Action’ from Bible Society UK."
