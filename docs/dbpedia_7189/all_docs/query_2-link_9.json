        "text": "Bond next\n\nNext year we'll see him as the mysterious character Waldo in the twenty-fifth Bond film No Time to Die.\n\n- Bond is a franchise that employs actors from different parts of the world. That's something that spoke in my favor. I auditioned for Skyfall in 2011. Unfortunately I didn't get that role. But I have kept in touch with the Bond films' casting manager. She remembered me when she worked on No Time to Die. I was flown to London and met the film's director Cary Fukunaga. It took many months before I finally landed the role.\n\nThe production of No Time to Die has been pursued by accidents. Daniel Craig injured his foot and there was also an uncontrolled explosion. Originally, the film was supposed to be finished in August, but it won't be finished until the end of October. He's still had fun and excitement on the Bond set:\n\n- There's something regal about Bond. This franchise is an important part of movie history and something that audiences around the world have a relationship with. It appeals to me.\n\nMonths in the studio\n\nThe Bond production brought Dencik to the Caribbean, more specifically Jamaica where writer Ian Fleming created James Bond. No Time to Die is the third Bond film shot in the idyllic island state.\n\n- It was a very long journey with several stops and I lost my luggage. But when I first arrived in Jamaica it was super cool. I've always been a big fan of reggae, so it was great to visit the reggae music's homeland!\n\nHe has also spent several months at Pinewood Studios, outside London where almost all the Bond films have been shot.\n\n- I probably didn't realize how legendary this movie studio is before I did scenes there. It was incredibly fun. One notices how resourceful this production is. I was very impressed with all the big sets. It doesn't seem like there is an upper budget limit, though it probably is, Dencik concludes.\n\nSo would they really wait until Christmas/December to release a trailer?\n\nMaybe they had a teaser but said hey let’s wait for the Matera scenes to be edited so we can throw the car chase in? Plus the re-shoots and scenes being filmed that were missed?\n\nSounds like we originally were getting a trailer in October since filming was done in August.\n\nYet it got pushed back to filming being done in October?\n\nEven though Barb said the teaser is done? Just weird.. Not sure why they would miss out on “Joker”.\n\nWhat other big films are coming out in November?\n\nThe film was pushed to October as far back as the Prince Charles set visit (presumably due to Craig's injury). So surely that can't be the reason."
