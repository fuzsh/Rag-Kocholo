David Ayer directed the film, which features actors such as Brad Pitt, Michael PeÃ±a, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, and Jason Isaacs. Set during the last days of World War II in 1945, the movie follows tank commander Staff Sergeant Don âWardaddyâ Collier(Pitt) and his five-man crew as they embark on a dangerous mission deep behind enemy lines. With only their Sherman tank to rely on, Wardaddy must ensure his team completes their task against all odds.\n\nThe movie shows the characters' intense struggles inside and outside their tank as they are forced to confront the realities of conflict. With its action-packed sequences and powerful performances from its ensemble cast, Fury delves into some of the worst atrocities endured by soldiers during World War II. Ayer searched for genuine uniforms and weapons that were suitable for the end months of the war in Europe. The movie was filmed in the United Kingdom mainly because functioning tanks from the World War II era were readily available.\n\nFury was well-received by critics for its thrilling action scenes and thorough exploration of wartime themes such as camaraderie, loyalty, courage, friendship, and sacrifice. The movie was nominated for several awards, including three Satellite Awards for Best Art Direction & Production Design, Best Editing, and Best Original Score.\n\nFury Locations\n\nThe 2014 war drama Fury was filmed in two of Englandâs most beautiful regions: Oxfordshire and Hertfordshire. Most scenes were shot in the rural setting of Oxfordshire, a county steeped in history and adorned with picturesque villages and rolling countryside.\n\nThe production team built a muddy German village on the grounds of Bovington Airfield in Hertfordshire, where viewers can get a glimpse into how tanks rolled through the town square. Both regions provide a stunning backdrop for Fury, with impressive landmarks such as Blenheim Palace, Windsor Castle, and Hampton Court Palace just an armâs length away from the locations used in filming.\n\nA visit to these locations would let you relive some iconic moments from the film and explore all each area has to offer. In Oxfordshire, tourists can marvel at the grand architecture or follow one of many walking trails that traverse through ancient sites such as Uffingtonâs White Horse chalk formation or Blenheim Palaceâs sweeping gardens. Meanwhile, Hertfordshire offers plenty of attractions, including Hatfield House, which is featured as Mansion Hill in Furyâs battle scenes. With so much to see and do, it is no wonder these regions were chosen for this intense war drama. Their beauty will surely leave any visitor captivated and inspired.\n\nThese scenes happen in the U.S. Army camp where Wardaddy and his crew of four soldiers are stationed. It is a war-ravaged site filled with tents and other military structures, which serves as the backdrop to their mission. The crew includes loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal), gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), driver Trini Garcia (Michael PeÃ±a), and assistant driver and bow gunner \"Red.\" Sadly, Red is killed in a tank battle and replaced by a new member, Private First Class Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), who previously worked as a clerk for V Corp.\n\nThese scenes were filmed in the area around Watlington, Oxfordshire, England. Pinewood Studios notified the residents of Watlington beforehand that they would hear gunshots and explosions during the filming of Fury. This small village is nestled amidst rolling hills and lush pasturelands, providing a beautiful backdrop for this momentous scene. Visitors can walk along quiet cobblestone paths or sit in old-fashioned pubs while admiring the townâs picturesque scenery.\n\nTo get to Watlington one can take a train from London Paddington station to Oxford Station, then take a local bus or taxi to Watlington. Alternatively, one can drive directly from London or any other city in southern England via the M40 motorway and A40 road into Oxfordshire before continuing on smaller roads into Watlington village itself.\n\nBrowse Surrey Filming Locations\n\nUpon capturing a small town, members of the platoon search for shelter. They come across an apartment occupied by German women. Don pays them for a hot meal and use of hot water for shaving. Norman and Emma (Alicia von Rittberg) bond and at Don's suggestion, they enter the bedroom to find a more intimate setting. The four subsequently have a meal together when the rest of the platoon, who are drunk, interrupt and harass Irma (Anamaria Marinca) and Emma while bullying Norman. However, Wardaddy intervenes and sternly reprimands them. But as they are getting ready to leave for an urgent mission, the town is hit by German artillery strikes, resulting in Emmaâs death and further traumatizing Norman.\n\nThe scene in the apartment is an important moment since it defines the relationship between Wardaddy and Norman and reveals the formerâs softer side. It is also a heartbreaking moment as it ends tragically with Emma's death. This scene shows how war affects ordinary people and conveys the idea that not all soldiers are cruel or insensitive to humanity.\n\nThis iconic scene was shot in Pinewood Studios, one of the largest studios in Europe located in Buckinghamshire, England. The studio has been used by many movies and television programs since 1936 and provided the perfect location for director David Ayer to create his war drama masterpiece.\n\nFor visitors interested in visiting this studio, Pinewood Studios can be easily accessed around 21.5 miles away from central London. There are several transportation options available to get there from anywhere in the city, such as bus, train, or car.\n\nCheck Brighton Filming Locations\n\nThe crossroads scene of Fury is set in a rural landscape of northern Germany, where the American forces are trying to capture and hold a vital crossroads. The crossroads are guarded by German troops who have already spotted allied forces in the distance. In order to protect their vulnerable rear lines, the platoon advances forward with their M4A3E8 tank and quickly finds itself under attack from a Tiger tank. In an intense battle, Don courageously maneuvers the tank around and eventually destroys the enemy tank by firing into its weaker rear armor. Now stranded in enemy territory without any radio contact to their superiors, he decides they must carry on with their mission and take control of the crossroads at all costs.\n\nThis scene is often regarded as one of the most iconic moments in Fury, as it showcases both Wardaddyâs bravery and his tactical skills during battle. It also serves as evidence for how difficult it was for allied forces to penetrate German lines during World War II.\n\nThe scene was filmed at Model Farm, located at Watlington in England. To get there, youâll need to head a little over two miles north from the center of Watlington, and itâs about a 45-mile drive from the center of London.\n\nFilming Locations Finder\n\nOverall, David Ayer's movie Fury was a technically impressive film with well-crafted battlefield sequences and a high level of realism. However, for some critics, the lack of an in-depth and compelling storyline means that the action scenes lack the emotional resonance they could have had. While some may appreciate the throwback to classic war movies of the 1940s, it is difficult to appreciate fully due to the shallow story elements.\n\nAnd if you want to check out the locations where some of the movieâs most memorable scenes were filmed, you donât need to travel to Germany. Instead, book yourself a flight to England and headout into the countryside to take in some of the UKâs best scenery."
