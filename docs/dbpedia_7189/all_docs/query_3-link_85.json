        "text": "SCOTLAND could miss out on one of the biggest booms in film industry history because of a lack of a dedicated film studio.\n\nThat's the warning from Scots Star Wars co-producer Tommy Gormley who has written an open letter to Scots MSPs backing the need for a new studio facility to revitalise the industry north of the border.\n\nIn the letter, he appealed to Scottish Parliament committee members involved in discussions about a studio and claimed that the organisations responsible for the much talked about studio project are showing a shocking lack of ambition in getting the project off the ground.\n\nGormley has just finished making Star Wars at Pinewood Studios, is now shooting Wonder Woman at Leavesden Studios near London and said the film industry in the UK is booming as the most popular destination for directors in the world thanks to tax breaks, with every studio in London booked.\n\nHe told the Record: \"It's boom time for filming in Britain at the moment, you can't get a studio in London because everything is full.\n\n\"It's a combination of a very attractive tax structure right now and world class crews, which Scotland has many of. We have the personnel but Scotland is not taking advantage of it.\"\n\nScotland is massively missing out.\"\n\nOf the four nations in the UK, Scotland is the only one without a studio. And these are successful, they are not white elephants.\n\n\"There is a demand for it, and it would be successful. I'm not saying the next Star Wars will be there or the next Wonder Woman, I don't have a crystal ball but the lack of a facility is a huge problem.\n\n\"We couldn't make Wonder Woman anywhere else, we need to be based at a studio. That's how films are made.\n\n\"I know it's very complex and I knew there are issues with state aid and finance, but why are there two in Northern Ireland and two in Wales? It's lack of ambition and drive.\"\n\nTommy Gormley, who has also worked on blockbusters like Star Trek and Mission Impossible 3, spoke out in response to a recent meeting of the Scottish Parliament’s Economy, Energy and Tourism committee where officials from Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise discussed plans for a studio in Scotland.\n\nGlasgow born Gormley said he was more than disappointed at the lack of progress and said that only three percent of UK film/TV production takes place in Scotland, with a new facility vital to revitalise the business in Scotland.\n\nHe wrote: “I found the contributions from David Smith (Director of Creative Industries, Scottish Enterprise), Janet Archer (Chief Executive, Creative Scotland) & Natalie Usher (Director of Film and Media, Creative Scotland) to be troubling in the extreme.\n\n“I found their responses to be complacent, oblique and uninspiring, but most worryingly, quite obviously lacking in any true ambition to deliver a studio as a matter of national urgency.\n\n“The whole impression the three gave to the public is I feel best summarised by the position that a purpose built film studio would be nice, but isn’t really actually a necessity.\n\n“The palpable lack of ambition for our film and TV sector was shocking. All the more so that it comes from the very people who are meant to be leading the charge.”\n\nThe issue of a Scottish film studio has been a hot topic in the creative industry for years, but has been highlighted recently by some high profile missed opportunities.\n\nHBO series Game of Thrones shot some scenes for its pilot in Scotland, but relocated to Belfast as a permanent base reportedly due to the studio facilities available in the city.\n\nCreative Scotland’s Natalie Usher told the committee that they had been working on organising convertible studio space on an ad hoc basis, as was the case with US hit series Outlander, filmed on location and at a former factory site in Cumbernauld.\n\nThere have been various proposals for studios in Cumbernauld, Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nGormley added: “The harsh, inescapable and unacceptable truth is that Scotland has around three percent of UK production spend, nowhere near what it should be. It is a catastrophically low percentage.\n\n“I was distressed to hear Natalie Usher’s comments that ‘the lack of a shiny new studio’ was not a barrier to growing the film and television business. “I sincerely believe this to be in point of fact 100 percent wrong.\n\nIt is quite simply not the case.” The Association of Film and Television Producers in Scotland issued a statement criticising the agencies.\n\nA spokesperson said: “AFTPS believes that Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise are monumentally failing the industry that they are charged to support.\n\n“Every other nation in the UK and indeed most countries globally have a dedicated Screen Agency to encourage growth in the sector due to the economic significance of the screen industries. The Scottish industry would be better served with a dedicated screen agency and the evidence for this can be seen in Wales and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nTommy Gormley added: “I truly believe, with all my experience and knowledge of this field, that a film studio would a true hub for our industry, and would gather together the critical mass required, in terms of skills, crewing and ancillary support, to be a game-changer for film making in Scotland.“\n\nA spokesman for the Scottish Government, Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise said: “The Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Creative Scotland are firmly committed to supporting the screen sector to grow and develop further, as underlined in Creative Scotland’s Film Strategy and through the record £24.1 million public sector funding awarded to support the industry in 2014/15.\n\n“We recognise the importance of ensuring additional screen infrastructure is developed in Scotland and the Film Studio Delivery Group, comprising the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Creative Scotland, remains committed to doing whatever we can within EU State Aid rules to make this happen.\n\n“A private-public proposal with the potential to meet our aspirations remains at a critical stage of consideration. We have been navigating incredibly complex and shifting terrain with this proposal, and there have been several iterations. Studios are notoriously difficult to make work commercially, which is why we are taking the time to get this absolutely right.”\n\n“We appreciate the sector’s patience on this matter.”"
