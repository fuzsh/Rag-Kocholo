        "text": "THIS is the terrifying moment a fire broke out at Pinewood studios during filming of Snow White.\n\nShocking footage shows huge flames blazing through the inside of the set beside a thatched cottage at the David Attenborough stage in Slough, Berkshire.\n\nMassive plumes of black smoke were seen billowing through the set of the movie, which will star Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler.\n\nThe terrifying clip shows parts of the set crashing from the ceiling in a ball of flames before a thatched cottage belonging to the Seven Dwarfs caught fire.\n\nIn the video worker is heard saying: \"A tree caught on fire, I don't know how\".\n\nAn alarm is heard as lighting fixtures and electronics sway in the smoke.\n\nIt's thought the studio was producing a live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nThe movie, expected to be released in 2023, will see Gadot star as the Evil Queen while Zegler will play Snow White.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"A set made up of a lot of wood, and trees etc was currently being built in the Richard Attenborough stage.\n\n\"Rumour is a piece of set has caught alight and spread across the rest of the set.\n\n\"Six fire engines from local stations have arrived and currently tackling the fire.\n\n\"Some crew in the studio were shaken but evacuated without injury.\"\n\nA second witness added: \"It was just mental. I didn't see it start but I was told first a tree went up.\n\n\"By the time I got there the flames were massive, going right up to the ceiling.\n\n\"Then bits of the set started falling into flames and the thatched cottage started lighting up.\"\n\nPinewood has also been home to the James Bond stage since 1976, with its construction costing $1.8 million (£1.3 million).\n\nThe set burned to the ground in June 1984 towards the end of filming Ridley Scott's Legend but was rebuilt and reopened in January 1985.\n\nIn July 2006, another fire occurred after production ended on the James Bond film Casino Royale.\n\nThe set was later demolished and rebuilt in under six months.\n\nThe Sun has contacted Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service for comment."
