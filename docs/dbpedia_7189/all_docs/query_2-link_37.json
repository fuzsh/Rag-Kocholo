        "text": "Locations around the country are benefiting from the high levels of film production in the UK, as filmmaking ripples out from studios around London.\n\nFilm is now a major economic driver for the UK. Recent BFI figures show that £1.1bn was spent on film production in the UK in 2013, up 7.5% on 2012. The picture is of a thriving film production sector, one that is increasingly geared to large scale inward investment films. Indeed, 37 inward investment films last year accounted for 81% of the total UK production spend, including Guardians of the Galaxy, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Imitation Game and The Monuments Men.\n\nThis spend is largely concentrated on London and the studio bases around the capital that house the films. But it is also rippling out across the UK, with films shooting on location throughout England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nListed below are many of the films that have recently shot or are shooting outside the capital.\n\nCreative England, which helps productions arrange location shoots around England, says its Production Services team supported a record £80.5m of location filming in the 2013/14 financial year, including 95 feature films (29 inward investment) and 89 TV dramas (11 inward investment).\n\nAs has been well documented, the big budget inward investment films are attracted here for various reasons, including the skilled production talent base and infrastructure in the UK as well as the competitive tax reliefs on offer.\n\nLocation managers confirm that it is a busy time. “We are enjoying a bit of a boom time at the moment, says Jonah Coombes, whose credits include Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, Rush, The Social Network and Paddington. “I’m getting lots of calls about projects and enquiries about my availability.”\n\nIn fact, he says it is so busy that it is becoming difficult to crew up. “There seems to be so many high pedigree projects running at the moment that it is really quite difficult to find the right people. It is frustrating – but obviously great at the same time.”\n\nLocation manager James Grant, whose credits include Alice Through the Looking Glass, World War Z and Skyfall, also says it is busy time for film production in the UK. “It’s very often feast or famine. But, for the time being, location managers find themselves in the position of being in demand.”\n\nHowever, he adds: “It will be interesting whether it continues to be busy.” Grant says he worries that some departments might be taking advantage of current demand, becoming increasingly work to rule in terms of overtime and hours on the clock.” He warns that the industry musn’t “bite the hand that feeds it,” pointing out that the US studios could quickly shift production to rival territories if the UK is perceived to be too difficult and expensive to work in.\n\nThat said, location managers say that the UK remains a pretty good place to shoot, with local authorities increasingly recognising the value of attracting film productions. London, however, is now very expensive to shoot in. “If you want to film in central London on a large feature film, you would have to budget £50k-£60k a day,” says Grant.\n\nCoombes says that the likes of Film London and Creative England regional film offices have helped put measures in place to make shooting on location a more accountable, predictable and generally smoother process. Coombes recalls working on 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later, and having to make London look like it had been abandoned for six months. “What we achieved on that project let me to believe that, given the right approach, anything really is possible.”\n\nCoombes says that once productions get out of London, there is a “tangible difference in terms of how you are received when you propose to bring the circus to town.” Perhaps because large-scale shoots are much rarer, they are more likely to be received with more interest and enthusiasm, he says.\n\nHe stresses that films can – and should – make themselves more welcome on location by opening up to the local community, where appropriate offering employment and work experience on the production. Says Coombes: “It’s not always viable or required, but if it’s an ambitious proposal and you are moving into a small community, it is important for the production to recognise that and offer something back over and above a donation to their residents association.”\n\nFilms that have shot outside London\n\n’71\n\nProducer Crab Apple Films\n\nLocations Lancashire, Merseyside, Yorkshire\n\nAlice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass\n\nProducer Walt Disney Studio Elstree\n\nLocations Gloucestershire\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\nProducer Marvel Studios\n\nLocations Hampshire, Surrey, Kent, Norwich\n\nDracula Untold\n\nProducer Universal\n\nLocations County Down, Antrim, Omagh, Beflast\n\nEdge of Tomorrow\n\nProducer 3 Arts Entertainment\n\nStudio Leavesden\n\nLocation Hampshire\n\nFrankenstein\n\nProducer Davis Ent/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nLocations Aberdeenshire, Manchester, Greenwich\n\nFury\n\nProducer Le Grisbi/Columbia Pictures\n\nLocations Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire\n\nGirls Night Out\n\nProducer Ecosse Films\n\nLocation Yorkshire\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nProducer Marvel Studios\n\nStudio Longcross\n\nLocation Essex, Hertfordshire\n\nHow I Live Now\n\nProducer Cowboy Films\n\nLocations Carmarthenshire\n\nMacbeth\n\nProducer See-Saw Films\n\nLocations Isle of Skye, Cambridgeshire\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nProducer Warner Bros\n\nStudio Leavesden\n\nLocations Kent, Surrey, Sussex\n\nThe Monuments Men\n\nProducer Columbia Pictures\n\nLocations Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Kent & Oxfordshire\n\nMr Turner\n\nProducer Thin Man\n\nLocations Cornwall, South Yorkshire\n\nMuppets Most Wanted\n\nProducer Walt Disney Pictures\n\nStudio Pinewood\n\nLocations Kent, Oxfordshire\n\nPaddington\n\nProducer Heyday/Warner Bros Studio Elstree\n\nLocations Hertfordshire\n\nPan\n\nProducer Warner Bros\n\nStudio Leavesden Studios\n\nLocations Buckinghamshire\n\nPride\n\nProducer Calamity Films\n\nLocations Neath Port Talbot, Berkshire\n\nRobot Overlords\n\nProducer Tempo\n\nLocations County Down, County Antrim, Belfast\n\nSpooks: The Greater Good\n\nProducer Kudos Film and TV Studio Shepperton\n\nLocations Warwickshire, Isle of Man\n\nStar Wars Episode VII\n\nProducer Lucasfilm Studio Pinewood Studios\n\nLocations Gloucestershire\n\nSuffragette\n\nProducer Ruby Films Studio Elstree\n\nLocations Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Kent\n\nTarzan\n\nProducer Warner Bros Studio Leavesden\n\nLocations Derbyshire, Gwynedd, Berkshire\n\nTestament of Youth\n\nProducer Heyday Films\n\nLocation Yorkshire\n\nVampire Academy\n\nProducer Angry Films Studio Pinewood\n\nLocations Buckinghamshire, Surrey\n\nTim Dams\n\nShare this story"
