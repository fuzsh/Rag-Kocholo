        "text": "It is a big year for the Greengrass boys from Gravesend. Not only is Paul's second blockbusting action thriller about to be released, but his brother, respected academic Mark Greengrass of Sheffield University, is to launch another work of some significance: a study of peace and reform in France between 1576 and 1585, entitled Governing Passions.\n\nThis 448-page Oxford University Press volume is inevitably destined for a smaller audience than his brother's new film, The Bourne Ultimatum, in cinemas this month, and, unless we are badly misinformed about academic publishing budgets, it will not have cost $125m to put together either.\n\nIn spite of the contrast between the careers of the brothers, there are some points of contact. The film-maker's life may be all red carpets and flashbulbs at the moment, but he does have a reputation for attacking each project with a kind of zeal and attention to research that is close to academic rigour.\n\nThis is the third of the Bourne films, a series based on the bestsellers by Robert Ludlum, and it has already been saluted in America as more proof of Greengrass's bold take on the mainstream thriller. In 2002, cinemagoers were introduced to the amnesiac and homicidal CIA agent Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman. But it was when Greengrass inherited the director's chair for The Bourne Supremacy three years ago that the critics sat up.\n\nThe series, with its darkly blank hero played by Matt Damon, has given us a grim James Bond for the modern age. Bourne films have become a brand the New York Times styles as 'unusually smart works of industrial entertainment'. Bourne arrives in London this time for his 'ultimatum' and, despite the bleak outlook for our forgetful assassin, the tone of the film is, at last, redemptive. His mission is, as David Denby puts it in the New Yorker, to 'reclaim himself from his induced oblivion'.\n\nGreengrass's new offering follows close on the heels of United 93, his highly acclaimed and compelling reconstruction of the hijacking of the fourth 9/11 plane. Known as 'the feelbad movie of the year' in America, it was distinguished by nominations for two Oscars, one of them the prestigious best director award. The director shot most of the film in England at Pinewood Studios inside a salvaged Boeing 757, a decision he took because he wanted to shelter his actors from the controversy surrounding the project in America and not because of any dislike of Hollywood. In fact, he has confessed to 'a great love affair' with the place, saying soon after the success of The Bourne Supremacy: 'It's not been at all as I thought. It is a director's town, Los Angeles, without a doubt.'\n\nGreengrass was chosen for the first Bourne sequel at a meeting between Universal bosses and its star, Damon. They all wanted someone with 'no formal style or commercial background' and when his name was suggested by a screenwriter, Damon was in the dark. 'I said, \"I feel like an idiot, but I don't know who that is,\"' he has admitted. After viewing Bloody Sunday, Greengrass's Bafta-winning treatment of the massacre by British troops of civil-rights marchers in Londonderry in January 1972, the actor called Universal and urged them to hire its director.\n\nIt would be easy, then, to see this as an overnight success. After all, not many Crystal Palace supporters make it big in LA. The truth, though, is that Greengrass is well used to being in the public eye in Britain. In the mid-Eighties, he co-wrote the banned book Spycatcher with renegade MI5 agent Peter Wright and his TV feature about the death of a black teenager in London, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, was hailed as a controversial triumph. Similarly, the film he wrote and produced about the Omagh bombing (Omagh) created many headlines.\n\nA big-faced, hairy man with strong arms and a force of determination to match, friends have the sense that Greengrass dons his little round glasses and wears his hair long and flowing to soften the imposing effect of his form. He now lives on a farm in Oxfordshire with Joanna, a television agent, and their three young children. He also has two grown-up children by a previous marriage to his teenage sweetheart.\n\nMost colleagues feel nothing but awe for this sturdy powerhouse. His friend and fellow director Stephen Daldry, for instance, believes he is 'a total down-the-line genius' and also that 'he is the nicest man in the world, the most affable and delightful. He is hysterically funny, too, and has a huge heart'.\n\nFilm producer Pippa Harris, late of the BBC's drama department, has been impressed too. 'He's extremely nice to deal with because he is straightforward and there is no edge,' she says. Others, however, have reservations. One former television colleague said: 'His films are brilliant, but there are few people who have as many former friends as Paul. He has a great ability for fixing on to the right people and the right subject at the right time, and then moving on.'\n\nGreengrass went to school in Kent, winning a scholarship to Sevenoaks School, and started his film-making career with a super 8 camera he found in the art room. He made a series of animated horror films, using old dolls and bric-a-brac props. He went on to Queens' College, Cambridge, and then, inspired by the story of Woodward and Bernstein's uncovering of the Watergate scandal in All the President's Men, decided to become an investigative journalist. He dreamt, he has since said, of bringing down governments, and bought a coat he could wear with the collar turned up.\n\nJoining Granada TV's World in Action, he worked on documentaries in the Far East, South Africa and, influentially, Northern Ireland and he seems to have picked up much of his trademark 'verite' style at this early stage. It was a period that he later characterised as: 'A festival of puerile self-importance, intense paranoia, fiddled expenses and brilliant creativity.'\n\n'He is incredibly talented to have made that move, from documentary to docu-drama to action feature films,' says Harris. 'What makes his new films so good is that he was able to bring a freshness to the genre. They have a sense of truth that brings an intensity. It is partly that documentary background that gives him an eye for a story and for an issue that perhaps others might not have.'\n\nDaldry argues that Greengrass has actually reinvented the thriller by bridging the creative gap between a political documentary and a blockbuster. 'He has taken a journalistic style, eavesdropping on the characters and then, in the case of the Bourne films, creating a super-reality. This gives them a vitality, instead of the over-refined stuff we have been getting.'\n\nThe films have a fast pace and handheld camera work that is not popular with all. Bourne fans blogging on the web are divided: 'Greengrass is trying for the effect of the handheld camera being in the moment with the action, but to me it looks dizzying and confused,' complains one, while another points out: 'There's a difference between not pleasing everyone and making a percentage of your potential audience physically ill.'\n\nThe comments of the professional critics are generally more complimentary. The New York Times has welcomed the film. 'There's no one in Hollywood right now who does action better, who keeps the pace going so relentlessly, without mercy or let-up, scene after hard-rocking scene,' its critic wrote last week.\n\nThe director himself seems happy now to be classed as an entertainer, regardless of his provocative track record (one of his typical but lesser-known scripts, Epitaph for the Official Secrets Act, was performed in workshop at the RSC and goaded the establishment by telling the David Shayler story sympathetically). He would just be 'a wanker', he says, to call himself a political film-maker, but he does confess he is 'attracted to the pressing and the contemporary'. He has amplified this point recently, saying: 'I am interested in seeing if you can create on film pieces that feel contemporary and urgent.' Even his new thriller comments backhandedly on current moral neuroses, featuring, as it does, scenes of illicit torture techniques, such as hooding, that echo events in Iraq.\n\nNext up for the 51-year-old director are two overtly political subjects: Vietnam and Iraq. Both films will be adaptations of powerful, journalistic books: They Marched Into Sunlight, by David Maraniss, tells of America's sudden disillusionment with the Vietnam War, while Rajiv Chandrasekaran's Imperial life in the Emerald City reveals the surreal world inside Baghdad's Green Zone at the start of the Iraq occupation. In a neat coincidence, the author is a former Iraq bureau chief of the Washington Post, the newspaper that uncovered Watergate and first inspired the young Greengrass. For someone who claims he is no political film-maker, there are a lot of news headlines still around the corner.\n\nThe Greengrass lowdown\n\nBorn: 13 August 1955 in Cheam, Surrey. His father was a merchant seaman and river pilot and his mother a teacher. Educated on a scholarship at Sevenoaks School and at Cambridge University.\n\nBest of times: Last year, United 93, his story of the fourth plane to be hijacked on 11 September, earned two Oscar nominations.\n\nWorst of times: The mid-Eighties, when Margaret Thatcher threatened to confiscate all his earnings after his co-authorship, with Peter Wright, of the Spycatcher book, which was banned under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nWhat he says: 'I am interested in seeing if you can create on film pieces that feel contemporary and urgent. You wouldn't expect to see me making Pride and Prejudice.'"
