        "text": "A lowly filing clerk in a Whitehall ministry, Norman, finds himself propelled to head of the office when both of his superiors are away, one ill and one on leave.\n\nMeanwhile, developments around the Pacific have put Tawaki - a small, independent island nation - at the centre of world affairs: its unique geology makes one of its outlying islands the perfect location for a world power to establish a new strategic outpost. Many have been making representations to the island's Queen, but so far she has yet to make a decision.\n\nHoping to impress the British case upon her, the ministry dispatches a delegation to an international conference in Geneva - and they are in need of a filing clerk to assist.

Attempting to tip some dirty shaving water out of the ceiling-level window, he instead drops the whole bowl, which smashes on the head of one of the British delegates, who happens to be standing on a balcony below.\n\nWith one of their number incapacitated, the other officials from the department are forced to call Norman in to take his place at the following day's meetings - but when his idol, a beautiful film star named Sonia, arrives in the VIP gallery Norman becomes rather distracted and unintentionally uses a veto power against British interests!\n\nThe vote, however, pleases the delegation from Tawaki and Norman soon finds himself - personally - in great favour with their Queen. As the world's major players seek his influence for their own interest over the Pacific nation, Norman finds himself repeatedly on the run and even under threat of assassination..."
