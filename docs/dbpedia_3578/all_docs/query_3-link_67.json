        "text": "Ethnic Armenians worldwide marked the 100th anniversary of a genocide at the hands of Ottoman Turks that claimed the lives of about 1.2 million Armenians from 1915 to 1918. The Turkish government continues to dispute that a genocide happened, and Armenian Americans are frustrated that President Obama did not use the word \"genocide\" this week to refer to the massacre. More than 130,000 commemorated the centennial in Los Angeles with a march on Friday.\n\n4:36 P.M.\n\nWrapping up\n\nWe're winding down our live updates about the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, but you can read more about the massive Los Angeles march here or find worldwide coverage of the anniversary here .\n\n4:04 P.M.\n\nCrowd estimated at 130,000+\n\n3:26 P.M.\n\nTurkish consulate general: 'We do not deny the suffering of the Armenians'\n\nRaife Gülru Gezer, the Turkish consulate general in Los Angeles, spoke out about the Armenian genocide in an interview on KTLA-TV Channel 5 on Friday afternoon.\n\n\"We do not deny the suffering of the Armenians and we do not deny the fact that hundreds of thousands of Armenians did die during the First World War,” she added.\n\nBut genocide is a “legal term” that is being “used loosely,” she said.\n\nGezer also challenged the number of victims, 1.5 million, that is cited by many Armenians. She said there were not that many Armenians living in the territory in question.\n\n\"The number is debatable, frankly speaking,\" she said.\n\n--Howard Blume\n\n2:57 P.M.\n\nAfter chants, a song for Armenia's heroes\n\nThousands of people marched down Wilshire Boulevard, waving flags and chanting \"shame on Turkey.\"\n\nThe crowd stopped in front of a stage, where a man sang to the crowd in Armenian.\n\n\"It's a hail to our heroes,\" said Argishe Minasyan, a Glendale resident.\n\n\"We love all of L.A. taking action,\" he said. \"We appreciate everyone here.\"\n\n--Brittny Mejia\n\nRead more\n\n2:46 P.M.\n\nTraffic stemming from march riles up residents\n\n2:13 P.M.\n\nMarchers approach Turkish consulate on Wilshire Boulevard\n\nRead more\n\n2:03 P.M.\n\nMarch takes route to Turkish consulate\n\nThe procession that continued Friday afternoon along a six-mile route, beginning in Little Armenia and ending at the Turkish consulate, was multi-generational, with small children riding atop parents' shoulders and older women linking arms for balance as they moved forward.\n\nMorning traffic was especially bad on the 101 Freeway on Friday between the San Fernando Valley and downtown, possibly due to the events, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nThe march is scheduled to officially conclude at 6 p.m.\n\n--Brittny Mejia and Taylor Goldenstein\n\nRead more\n\n1:04 p.m.\n\n'Resilience pays off'\n\nPasadena resident Sophie Jihanian, 48, holding a large French flag with a small Armenian flag stuck in the top, put her left hand to her mouth and led a chant in Armenian at the Hollywood Armenian genocide anniversary march.\n\n\"Barkar minchev verch!\" she yelled, which translates as \"Resilience pays off.\"\n\nHer husband, Cedrik, whose family immigrated to France, said the lack of Turkish recognition has prevented him and many others from healing.\n\nSophie Jihanian said she's fighting not only for the rights of her people: \"We also believe tremendously that this will help all genocides in the world be eradicated for all people. Had it been recognized, perhaps we wouldn't have had the Holocaust.\"\n\n--Taylor Goldenstein\n\nRead more\n\n12:28 P.M.\n\n'They buried us but did not know we were seeds'\n\n12:18 P.M.\n\nScenes from the Los Angeles march\n\nRead more\n\n12:15 P.M.\n\nSigns of support for the crowd\n\n11:55 A.M.\n\nJerusalem bells ring 100 times; protesters gather\n\nChurches across Jerusalem rang their bells 100 times before ecumenical services Friday at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n\nFor the first time, Christian churches of various denominations in East Jerusalem joined their Armenian brethren in marking the anniversary of the massacre.\n\nAs well, hundreds of protesters carried the red, blue and orange Armenian flag and signs reading \"Turkey guilty of genocide\" at a demonstration near the Turkish consulate in East Jerusalem on Friday.\n\n--Maher Abukhater\n\nRead more\n\n11:39 A.M.\n\nIn Tehran, a march from church to embassy\n\nThousands of Iranian Armenians rallied in Tehran on Friday, protesting in front of the Turkish Embassy to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n\nMany in the crowd, who marched from the Armenian church in Tehran to the Turkish Embassy, held signs in Farsi and English asking the international community to recognize the genocide, while others chanted slogans calling for justice and the downfall of the Turkish government.\n\n“What Armenians demand now is that the Turkish government recognize [the massacre] as genocide and accept its legal consequences,” Karen Khanlari told Iran's Press TV during the protests.\n\n--Sarah Parvini\n\n11:34 a.m.\n\nBittersweet mood during march\n\nPeople at Friday's Armenian genocide memorial dedication and march in Hollywood were happy about the sense of community, yet sad about what the 100th anniversary represents.\n\n\"We're commemorating their victimization 100 years ago,\" Josephine Camalian, 42, of Burbank said of those killed. She said her grandfather at age 8 was in an orphanage because he lost both parents.\n\n\"We're sad, this is a sad day for us. This is the blackest day of our history,\" she said. \"We hope that our voice once heard will allow for this history to never happen to anyone else. We don't want anyone else to go through what we went through.\"\n\nSome in the crowd wiped away tears as they watched the sea of Armenian flags wave as an Armenian song played.\n\n--Brittny Mejia\n\nRead more\n\n11:28 A.M.\n\nWatch the march live\n\n11:11 A.M.\n\nObama booed by marchers\n\nA large group of marchers gathered near a stage on Sunset Boulevard as a woman took the stage.\n\nShe called for official recognition of the Armenian massacres as a genocide, and mentioned President Obama, which prompted a chorus of boos from the audience.\n\n\"Mr. Obama, it really is time to learn the lesson of our history,\" she said.\n\n--Brittny Mejia\n\nRead more\n\n11:10 A.M.\n\nSongs and signs along the march\n\nAs the march began, the crowd was a blur of brightly colored flags in stark contrast to the muted gray sky.\n\nMany marchers held identical azure signs: \"Thank you ___ for recognizing the Armenian genocide,\" and in the space was the name of a different country.\n\nSome signs were more forceful: \"We Demand Justice\" and \"Turkey Must Pay.\"\n\nA group of people in the crowd began to chant a historical song, the sounds of their voices broken by the loud humming of helicopters overhead.\n\n--Taylor Goldenstein\n\nRead more\n\n10:55 A.M.\n\nWho invented the word 'genocide'?\n\nWriter Thomas de Waal in Foreign Affairs discusses the politics that come into play when the word \"genocide\" takes a seat at the table. A State Department official once told him that resolutions related to the Armenian genocide took up more discussion hours than any other congressional issues.\n\nThe word came from Polish-born Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, De Waal says. He invented the word in 1944.\n\n“I became interested in genocide because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, and after the Armenians, Hitler took action.”\n\nRead more\n\n10:52 A.M.\n\nFamilies' missing pieces\n\nTarzana resident Anna Karapetian, 31, said her family was torn apart after the genocide, and of those who survived, some were never found. The genocide has left a scar on many families, she said.\n\n\"They're not the same,\" Karapetian said. \"There's always a missing puzzle, a missing piece in their families as far as who they are and who they're going to be ... regardless of how many years go by.\"\n\nKarapetian brought her 6-year-old daughter, Sofie Tigeranian, to the Armenian memorial dedication. Sofie proudly sported a purple forget-me-not flower and Armenian flag on her face.\n\nPassing on her language, religion and culture is one way to ensure the tragedy won't be forgotten and future generations will know where they came from, Karapetian said.\n\n--Taylor Goldenstein\n\nRead more\n\n10:43 A.M. | statement\n\nThere cannot be closure on an atrocity of this magnitude if we do not call it by its name.\n\nBill de Blasio, New York City mayor\n\nRead more\n\n10:28 A.M.\n\nPoetry from genocide pain\n\nAzniv Derdzakyan, a senior at Hollywood High School, wrote a poem to commemorate the anniversary.\n\nHere's an excerpt from the poem, posted to HS Insider, titled \"Never forget\":\n\nBlood flows through my body/ It reminds me of my roots / I feel the torture / The pain that my ancestors / And many more felt\n\nHS Insider is a digital platform started by The Times to help high school student journalists tell stories important to them and their communities.\n\nRead the full poem by clicking below.\n\n--Christine Mai-Duc\n\nRead more\n\n10:21 A.M.\n\nNever too young\n\n10:21 A.M.\n\nTeaching the children\n\nSome in the crowd at the Armenian Genocide Memorial Square brought their children to remind them of their history.\n\nSteve Nersesyan, 37, came with his two kids and his niece and nephew.

Marks wrote a novel, which was published two weeks ago, she said.\n\n--Brittny Mejia\n\n9:50 A.M.\n\nCrowd marches down Western Avenue\n\n9:43 A.M.\n\nCheering the memorial square sign\n\nThe crowd cheered and clapped as each government official asked for remembrance and recognition of the genocide.\n\nMany held phones up to capture the moment. A little girl dressed in purple sat on her father's shoulders, waving an Armenian flag as she waited for the Armenian Genocide Memorial Square signs to be unveiled. Many people chatted in Armenian, the mood a happy one. A few boys wore hats that read \"1915.\"\n\n--Brittny Mejia\n\n9:27 A.M. | Statement\n\nWe all have a moral responsibility to remember the Armenian genocide for what it was -- for if we ignore history, we know we are condemned to repeat it.\n\nU.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\n\n9:33 A.M.\n\nMemorial square's sign officially unveiled\n\n\"This morning we dedicate the Armenian Genocide Memorial Square to honor those who perished during the 1915 genocide,\" said L.A.
