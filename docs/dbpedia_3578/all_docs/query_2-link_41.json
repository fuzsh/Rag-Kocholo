        "text": "All,\n\nA short poem that was posted on a Facebook group sent me on another deep look at Beersheba War Cemetery. Although I knew about it – I never looked at the details of a single Indian war dead buried there. As there was no Indian involvement in this area – I assumed that it was a secondary burial site from one of the small cemeteries scattered along the Gaza-Beersheba front, from the period before Gaza III and the Capture of Beersheba, and it will be a British person from the Indian Army. The reason I thought so is that it can't be a Muslim, as there are no crescents in this cemetery; it can't be a Sikh or Hindu, as they are cremated, not buried. So, it had to be a Christian.\n\nThis time I looked at the details and said to myself: Wow! This is weird!\n\nSo, the name is Armenac Kemkemian – Without a doubt, an Armenian name. According to CWGC records, he was an interpreter, from the Corps of Guides and Interpreters, Indian Army. This of course is the reason he appears in CWGC records as an Indian casualty. He was attached to the Supply Section, 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Killed from an aerial attack with a few Australians and buried at Shellal, as can be seen in this photo, from the AWM collections: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C293963\n\nI found that Armenac Kemkemian was mentioned on this 2010 GWF thread, by my friend Michaeldr (Pages 2-3): https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/148377-beersheba-war-cemetery/. Reading the thread, it seems there are a few updates in his CWGC records since 2010.\n\nBeing an interpreter means that he was either an Arabic or Turkish speaker (or both), which suggests that he was most probably a local (Middle East) recruit. Note this:\n\nHe could be recruited from the Armenian community in Egypt, but let me go wild for a minute – Maybe from the refugees of Musa Dagh, brought to Alexandria; Or maybe from the refugees, Jewish and Christian (Including Armenians), that were deported from the Holy Land and arrived in Alexandria on American ships.\n\nOver the last few years, I initiated a few events with the local Armenian community in Israel and the Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem, regarding the Armenian involvement in the EEF, through the Armenian Legion, also known as the Legion de Orient. I called someone from the Patriarchate, to look if they have this surname, Kemkemian, in their records (long shot, but worth a try).\n\nI guess that somewhere, there are some records of his recruitment. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nEran\n\nFrom the brief time I spent looking at interpreters, these men were employed locally by HM Forces. I would imagine it were similar to the arrangements for interpreters for British and Australian forces (Operation Herrick and Operation Slipper + Operation Highroad respectively) over the past 20 or so years.\n\nI think that the administrators at CWGC have made a big leap by assuming they were formally recruited into the Indian Army's Corps of Guides and Interpreters as the only formal body of interpreters in the military forces of HM King George V. What use would a Greek interpreter be of on the North West Frontier?\n\nHad it been the case they were part of the Indian Army, these men would not appear in a British Army civilian medal roll. Instead they would be in records compiled by the India Office and since destroyed.\n\nThe medal rolls for the interpreters, like that of the London Regiment, are useful insofar as they record the period of time whilst in a theatre of war. This is the nearest that you will get to a service record. In order to be eligible for a BWM from the War Office, the recipients had to have been 'members of duly recognised or authorized organisations'. As a consequence of such service, and to have therefore 'rendered approved service overseas.. between 5th August 1914, and 11th November 1918, both dates inclusive', they became eligible for the British War Medal. Regarding the first quote in blue font, the \"recognised organisations\" had their own medal rolls. The interpreters that had been employed by the MEF/BSF and EEF therefore had their own respective rolls. In a similar manner, those who served in medical units would likewise have their own rolls too. (Sourced from Army Order 266 of 1919.)\n\nLocal interpreters in Egypt and Palestine appear in the medal roll WO 329/2340, Egyptian HQ\n\nImages 354 to 417 inclusive (of 424) of this medal roll (via Ancestry) list various names, Taranto, M being the first. Upon reading the list, a lot of Armenian family names are appearing.\n\nGiven they were not formally engaged as soldiers in the British Army, they were not eligible for the Victory Medal.\n\nHi Steve and Keith!\n\nSteve - Yes, I read the article you mentioned. Doesn't help that much regarding the specific Corps of Guides and Interpreters, Indian Army. As a matter of fact - Can't find a word regarding this unit.\n\nKeith - Found your remarks on this on older threads, and I was planning to send you a PM, but here you are...\n\nHave you got any details about this unit? How come it is not mentioned anywhere in the detailed lists of the EEF? There must be some HQ/center that would send those interpreters to the various units, like the case of Armenac Kemkemian, attached to the 2nd ALH Brigade.\n\nBoth Armenians and Jews in the region were better educated than most ethnic groups around the Middle East at that time (Very typical of minorities), including knowledge of several languages. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that some of them will be recruited as interpreters. I found that many Armenians and Jews were recruited into the Ottoman Army and it should be no surprise that the same thing happened with the EEF. You wrote: \"Local interpreters in Egypt and Palestine appear in the medal roll WO 329/2340, Egyptian HQ.

(I'm not on Ancestry).\n\nEran\n\nEdited 28 July , 2023 by Eran Tearosh\n\nHi Eran,\n\nI had not accessed Ancestry to capture this info, and requests for lookups are understandably forbidden by the terms of the forum. I merely made a note to self of where the records start, and where they end.\n\nAfter some sleuthing, I was able to come across the following grouping which may be of interest to you, It should be possible to identify Armenian interpreters. You can download this as a csv file.\n\nhttps://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/community/385\n\nRegarding the employment of local translators, I can well imagine they were classified as \"lines of communication\" and administered by the 3rd Echelon of General Headquarters of the \"big formation\", in this case the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. (Whether administered by (i) the Adjutant General branch or by (ii) the Quarter Master General branch of the General Staff I do not know but would imagine other forum members can advise further.) The records being kept for locally hired staff, on a pro-tem basis, would have facilitated the creation of a medal roll for those men who served.\n\nFor these men, like the Chinese Labour Corps or Egyptian Labour Corps, it seems highly unlikely that anything other than medal roll documentation has survived. I can imagine it was destroyed upon disbandment of the EEF.\n\nA quick perusal of interpreter MICs seemed to contain some Italian surnames. This reminded me that there has been an Italian community in Egypt, and that some of them may have served as interpreters too.\n\nFirst, thank you all (Steve, Keith & Maureen) for the help so far. As you'll see in a minute, it gets even more complicated…\n\nBefore I go into that, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\nIn CWGC records we find a Corps of Guides and Interpreters, Indian Army, that we never heard about before, and seems not to be recorded anywhere else (So far…). In their records, there are 4 dead listed under this 'unit' - 2 in Egypt, 1 in Mudros (Greece), and 1 in Palestine (Beersheba). By their names, two of these are definitely Armenian, yet they are recorded as Indians, as the unit is recognized as such.\n\nKeith pointed out that there were a few Armenians that served in EEF, and Steve added at least two more Armenian (Yes Steve – definitely Armenian) interpreters. We don't know yet who recruited these interpreters and who was in charge of their attachments to the various units. Steve thinks it might be through the Egyptian Army, and that might be the case regarding the recruitment part, but that's just a guess. Keith points towards The EEF HQ, and that makes sense regarding the deployment of the interpreters (Interesting challenge to try to find records about this in EEF's HQ files, if they survived). Still, just guesses.\n\n___________________\n\nMaureen – I know The Guides very well; they were infantry battalions here, and I couldn't find any connection between The Guides and Interpreters. The 1st Battalion was here all 1918 and the new 2nd Battalion joined in quite late, just before the Megiddo Campaign. A couple of years ago I spent quite some time studying in the field the event known as The Action of Arsuf or The Action of the Sisters (8/6/1918). Unfortunately, the pocket maps of The Guides book are not scanned. My main interest would be the specific map titled Palestine, 1918, and Action of the Sisters, 8/6/18. Any chance you or anyone else could help me with that? (I have the map from the Black Watch's book of the same event. They were operating to the left of The Guides).\n\nNever heard about the LHF! I'll try to approach them.\n\n____________________\n\nI decided to try to look at the interpreter issue from a different angle – This time I searched the CWGC records for Israel & Gaza Strip using 'interpreter' as a rank. Two results came up: Armenac KEMKEMIAN in Beersheba and one, J. M. ATTIRGI, buried in Jerusalem and commemorated in Ramleh.\n\nhttps://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2000657/j-m-attirgi/\n\nVery interesting. Lots of details I'll try to check here, using some local Greek-Orthodox contacts. For our discussion, note his original unit: Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides Cavalry (F.F.) (Lumsden's). Attached to Staffordshire Yeomanry. Service number: KL/758 (Armenac KEMKEMIAN has no Service Number). Looking into finer details I found this (note the Regiment name):\n\nIs this the missing link? Is the Q.V.O. Corps of Guides (Cavalry) the unit we're looking for? I'm not sure. First, as far as I thought I know, this unit was never in the Palestine front and I can't find them in any list (Including no reference I found in The History of The Guides). Second - still, CWGC records show 3 dead (A Naik & a Sepoy of the 1st Battalion, both buried in Ramleh + ATTRIGI in Jerusalem). Third, it seems that even if a part of the Q.V.O. Corps of Guides (Cavalry) made it here, and even if that's the source of that 'Corps of Guides & Interpreters' mistake – They could not have been here before early 1918, which means that this is maybe a part of the answer, but not the full one, as Armenac KEMKEMIAN was killed in 1917.\n\nLove it when it gets complicated…\n\nEran\n\nEdited 29 July , 2023 by Eran Tearosh\n\n18 hours ago, Eran Tearosh said:\n\nThanks, Keith!\n\nOf course, I wasn't asking for a lookup on Ancestry - I hoped that you had that list, and from there - something specific regarding Armenac Kemkemian ...\n\nThat link you sent is fascinating! However, unfortunately, Armenac Kemkemian is not mentioned.......\n\nHello again Eran,\n\nI just wanted to go back to this for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, I believe that you thought I had taken an interest in the locally hired interpreters of the EEF, and that my interest was so great, that I downloaded the details of the roll, the names etc. To this end, you asked if I was able to share this. My interest in July 2019 was limited to finding where the roll started, and where it ended.\n\nFor completeness, below is the corresponding medal index card for J Benlian. Whilst it had been my misunderstanding that his entitlement was BWM only, the medal roll (WO 329/2340) and the medal index card (reference WO 372/2/96473) document his entitlement to both BWM and Victory Medal too.\n\nMedal index card below, © 1997-2023 Ancestry.com\n\nIt may seem like I went overboard earlier, but I did want to prove, chapter and verse, that the limited sharing of documents on this particular thread is indeed within the terms and conditions of Ancestry and of the forum. I am a contributor to FMP, and whilst I do not make any financial gain, it is important that the mechanism of FMP and Ancestry as sustainable businesses which provide new sources of genealogical research data, is able to continue in this manner.\n\nSecondly, when I performed a global search on Ancestry for Armenac Kemkemian, the only result was the link to his profile on FindAGrave.\n\n1 hour ago, Eran Tearosh said:\n\nIs Armenac KEMKEMIAN mentioned there? (From what you wrote before, I'm not sure)\n\nOf course, I won't use this!!!\n\nEran\n\nOops I posted the comment too soon. So in answer to your question above\n\nQuote\n\nwhen I performed a global search on Ancestry for Armenac Kemkemian, the only result was the link to his profile on FindAGrave.\n\nOn 29/07/2023 at 21:31, Keith_history_buff said:\n\nI've added all that I can, so will stop here, as all I can \"contribute\" is a repeat of what I have already posted.\n\nKeith!\n\nThank you for everything! Maybe I should add a few words to explain why I'm so 'in' to this Armenian person and into Armenians in the Palestine Campaign in general:\n\nOne of the goals of my work here is to try to promote interest and proper commemoration of the many nations that were involved in the campaign here. I'm especially fascinated and interested in the smaller and less-known contingents that were a part of the campaign. It's a long process that takes years and this is not the place to go through all these activities - some with more successful results and some less, at least at this stage...\n\nThe Armenians are very unique - in general, and for me personally. In 2018 I managed to convince the Jerusalem Patriarchate and community to hold a moving event to commemorate the centennial of The Battle of Arara, where the Legion de Orient fought courageously, under the French Flag (But as a part of the EEF), as a part of the opening stages of the Megiddo Campaign. The fallen were buried at the battlefield, and in 1925 were moved to the Armenian Cemetery of Mount Zion, where an Obelisk was erected, and that is where we started the 2018 event. Last year I managed to bring representatives of the Armenian Embassy & Jerusalem Patriarchate to the Ramleh Cemetery Remembrance Sunday ceremony - I found there a few Armenian graves, unknown to the Armenians till that day. Their faces told the whole story:\n\nSame thing when I informed them of the name of Armenac KEMKEMIAN.\n\nThere's a new Armenian Museum (Beautiful!) that opened in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. At the moment, the Legion de Orient and the Armenian contribution to the Palestine Campaign are not presented well enough and I'm working with the Museum to put things right.\n\nIn light of this, I think you'll understand why I was maybe a bit too 'pushy'. Please accept my apologies.\n\nThanks again!\n\nEran\n\nEdited 2 August , 2023 by Eran Tearosh"
