        "text": "On May 10, 1935, Hairenik Weekly published a statement made by the vice-Mayor of Bucharest, Romania:\n\n“The Armenians have helped us Romanians not to become slaves of the Jewish elements.”\n\nHistory has recorded that Romania was in the forefront of anti-Semitic states within the Nazi occupied lands.\n\nOn August 9, 1935 ,the Hairenik Weekly explained that the reason Armenians and Greeks killed so many Jews in Salonica was because of Jewish love of gain.\n\nThe Daily Hairenik, not to be outdone by the Weekly Hairenik, joined in supporting the German cause. On August 19, 1936:\n\n“Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements [Jews] when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it becomes necessary for a people (Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During a surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing. Under such conditions dictatorship seems to have the role of a savior.”\n\nThe very next day, this Armenian newspaper published the statement,\n\n“Jews being the most fanatical nationalists and race-worshiper, are compelled to create an atmosphere of internationalism and world-citizenship in order to preserve their race. As British use battleships to occupy lands, the Jews use internationalism or communism as a weapon.”\n\nConsider the fact that just eighteen years before the Armenians were begging arms, ammunition and military supplies from these same British they now attack on behalf of Germany.\n\nOn September 17, 1936, the Hairenik praised Hitler and the Germans:\n\n“and came [to power] Adolph Hitler after Herculean struggles. He spoke to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the fountain if his national genius.”\n\nThe September 25, 1936, edition of the newspaper published:\n\n“…the type of Jews who are imported to Palestine is not anything to be proud about. They have loose morals and vices…. And on top of all, their Communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab criticism.”\n\nThis issue of the Hairenik was printed in English and edited by Armenians living in Boston, Massachusetts. Perhaps this is the reason the Armenian Revolutionary Federation’s archives in Boston are not open to the public for research work. Perhaps the Armenians do not want fair and honest historians to examine the records of their active support for Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nIn 1942, many Armenian youth were recruited and were active in support of the Nazi war effort. Suren Bezzadian Paikhar organized and led the Armenian National Socialist movement called Hoassank (which means “lighting”). This organization became popular throughout Europe and with young Armenians living in Turkey."
