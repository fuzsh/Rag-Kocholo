During this time, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians lost their lives at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.

        "text": "Russian troops gained victories both on the Balkan and the Caucasian fronts during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. The Russian troops occupied Bulgaria and advanced to the outskirts of Istanbul, while on the Caucasian war stage, they took Ardahan, Bayazet, Alashkert, Kars and Erzurum, i.e., a considerable segment of Western Armenia, as well as Batumi. The Turks had to terminate the war operations and seek for peace.\n\nThe Peace Treaty between Russia and the Ottoman Empire was signed on March 3, 1878, in the township of San Stefano in the vicinity of Istanbul. It verified the victories, gained with the Russian weapon. In the Treaty of San Stefano a special Paragraph 16 was added about the application of reforms in Western Armenia.\n\nThe Congress of Berlin met on June 13, 1878, presided over by Bismarck. England and Austria-Hungary, supported by Germany, France, and Italy, succeeded in revising the decisions of San Stefano, weakening Russia’s positions, while their own positions and influence on the Ottoman Empire, vice versa, were reinforced. By the decision of the Congress, Russia returned Alashkert with the valley and Bayazet to Turkey. Ardahan, Kars, as well as Batumi remained with Russia. The Treaty of Berlin contained a specific Paragraph 61, all dedicated to the Armenian Question. It differed from Paragraph 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano in several very principal aspects, and this not to the benefit of Armenians. If, under the Treaty of San Stefano, the reforms in Western Armenia were to be carried out in the presence of the Russian troops, which presented a certain guarantee of said implementation, now, under the Treaty of Berlin, the Russian troops were withdrawn to leave everything to the discretion of the “bloodthirsty Sultan”.\n\nParadoxical was the fact that the powers entrusted the Sultan “to ensure Armenians’ security from Kurds and Circassians’”, whereas the Sultan himself was the principal instigator of all the anti-Armenian deeds of the Kurds and Circassians. A perfect example of this is that, right after the Congress of Berlin of 1891, by the order of Abdul Hamid II, a cavalry, named “Hamidie” after the Sultan, in which only Kurds were enlisted, was set up and kept at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. It consisted of 30 regiments which were not integrated in the system of the Ottoman army and were kept as a separate military unit, located in the Armenian town of Erzinkan. The foremost goal of the “Hamidie” was to organize carnages of Armenians all throughout the Empire, which they executed perfectly in 1894-1896 and during the ensuing Armenian massacres.\n\nThe Armenian massacres of 1894-1896 marked the apex of Ottoman Empire’s violence against the Armenian population. It began with the destruction of Sasun in August 1894, followed by massacres in major cities and towns like Trabzon, Erzinka, Marash, and many more. In total, it is estimated that around 300,000 Armenians lost their lives during this period. Additionally, 100,000 Armenians were forcibly Islamized and the same number were expelled from their homeland. The Ottoman Empire attempted to organize pogroms in Zeytun, but the locals successfully resisted the threatening Turkish troops.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Young Turks emerged as a movement with the aim of unseating the authoritarian Sultan and his regime. They founded their own party, the Committee of Union and Progress, and organized a successful coup in 1908, depriving Sultan Abdul Hamid II of power. The people, including Armenians, welcomed the overthrow with open arms, but it soon became clear that the Young Turks were ardent nationalists who continued the policy of oppression and slaughter. They advocated for the assimilation of all nations in the Ottoman Empire to create a “pure” Turkish nation, resorting to mass slaughters to achieve that goal.\n\nThe Young Turk Revolution initially brought hope for a better future for all nations in the Ottoman Empire, but only a year later in April 1909, Turkish chauvinists incited a crowd to commit wholesale atrocities against the local Armenian population in Adana, Cilicia. The massacre spread to other Armenian settlements and resulted in the death of over thirty thousand Armenians. Armenians who had initially supported the Young Turk Revolution faced serious doubts and fear for this new proto-fascist regime.\n\nGermany’s construction and control of the Baghdad railway in the late 19th and early 20th century was part of a larger plan to assume control over the Ottoman Empire and weaken England and Russia’s positions in the region. In order to establish Turkish homogeneity in North-Eastern Anatolia and provide skilled manpower for the railway construction, Germans suggested resettling Armenians and replacing them with Muslims brought from Trachea and Russia. This idea became a basis for the Young Turk policy of annihilating the Armenians in their homeland, leading to the Armenian Genocide.\n\nThe decision to solve the “Armenian Question” through genocide was made by the Young Turks in the early 1910s during a number of secret meetings and conferences of the Union and Progress Party’s Central Committee. The 1911 Salonika conference, in particular, resulted in the leadership explicitly deciding to Turkify all non-Turkish nations of the Ottoman Empire, which most acutely impacted the Armenians. These decisions became the official strategy of the Young Turk policy, and secret orders were signed by Talaat and sent to local authorities for the extermination of the Armenians.\n\nThe Balkan Wars between the Balkan Alliance and Turkey from 1912 to 1913 resulted in Turkey’s defeat and accelerated the unleashing of World War I. Turkey’s defeat in the first Balkan War prepared the ground for the revisiting of the Armenian Question and the Reforms Question of Western Armenia. Thanks to the participation of Armenian public circles and the Russian government, the human rights issue became a discussion point of international diplomacy.\n\nIn anticipation of war, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation held a congress in Erzerum where two representatives from the Young Turk authorities demanded that the Armenians declare loyalty to Turkey, form detachments to fight against Russians, and foment a revolt in the Caucasus. They promised that after the war, Armenians would be given the right to establish an independent state. However, the congress rejected these demands, declaring that Armenians of Turkey and Russia would appear in different camps, and that the congress could not speak on behalf of the Armenians of Russia. The Young Turk representatives were dissatisfied and one of them, Shakir Behaeddin, later became one of the organizers of the Armenian Genocide.\n\nOn August 1, 1914, World War I began, lasting for four years and involving 33 states, including two military-political alliances: the Entente and the Central Powers. The Ottoman Empire officially joined the war on October 29, 1914, citing threats from Russia and England. The war drew in 1.5 billion people, or 75% of the world population, with over 74 million people mobilized. The death toll amounted to 10 million, and another 20 million were injured during various episodes of the war.\n\nAtrocities took place in Sebastia, where 10,000 soldiers working in labor camps were killed, in the West of Karin where 9,000 were killed, in Zara where 1,000 were killed, and in a place called Reshatie, in the region of Tokat, where 1,000 Armenians were killed. The massacres ended on July 13, with a total of 21,000 Armenians murdered.\n\nThe Bolshevik leaders of Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the anti-Entente states – Germany, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria, by which it withdrew from the Entente and joined its former antagonists. The treaty put the Armenians living in the Caucasus in an extremely difficult situation, as it invalidated the decision of December 29, 1917, on the right of self-determination of Eastern Armenian lands, instead adopting the decree on returning the same lands to Turkey.\n\nAn armistice was signed between the Entente states and Turkey on October 30 in the city of Mudros, with provisions for the return of Armenian survivors to their homes. However, the Entente states did not enforce the implementation of the Mudros armistice, and the Turkish government of Ankara later rejected it, invalidating it.\n\nAmidst the Franco-Turkish conflict that occurred in Aintab between 1920 and 1921, Armenians found themselves in a precarious situation as they attempted to navigate a path between their previous oppressors and a French army that had invaded the region. In order to protect themselves, they were forced to take up arms and fight against hostile forces independently.\n\nA heroic battle in Aintap (now Gaziantep) began on April 1, 1920, and ended on February 8, 1921. It appears that the well-known battle of Aintab was not just a struggle against an occupying force, but also a calculated effort by a group of Turkish individuals who had benefited from the Armenian genocide and sought to retain their ill-gotten gains. The resistance movement aimed to intimidate Armenian repatriates and make it impossible for them to return to their homes, ultimately forcing them to flee once again. Essentially, the local elite, which included landowners, industrialists, and civil-military bureaucrats, not only spearheaded the resistance but also financed it, all in an attempt to rid Aintab of its Armenian population.\n\nTalaat, one of the organizers of the Armenian Genocide, was assassinated in Berlin by an Armenian student, Soghomon Tehlirian, which was the beginning of the “Nemesis” operation. The aim of the operation was to execute the death sentence of Young Turk leaders in Turkey. The operation was implemented by Armenian avengers seeking justice.\n\nA week before the invasion of Poland and the start of World War II, Adolph Hitler spoke of his orders “to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish race or language,” and concluded his remarks by asking, “Who, after all, speaks today of the extermination of the Armenians?”\n\nA series of violent attacks against the Armenian, Greek, and Jewish communities in Istanbul took place, resulting in the deaths of several people and the destruction of many homes and businesses.\n\nThe pogrom resulted in the displacement of thousands of people from the targeted communities, many of whom fled Turkey. The violence also marked the beginning of the end of the once-vibrant Greek and Armenian communities in Istanbul, which had existed in the city for centuries. Today, only a small fraction of these communities remain in the city. The Istanbul Pogrom remains a controversial and sensitive topic in Turkish history, and it continues to be debated and studied by scholars and activists."
