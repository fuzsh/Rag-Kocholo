        "text": "In October 1916, the French government agreed with Armenian political elites to establish a Légion of Armenian volunteers in British Cyprus to fight the common Ottoman enemy. Despite British, French, and even Armenian rejections of such a Légion during different times throughout 1915 and early 1916, all sides overcame earlier concerns. Understanding how they managed to overcome these concerns will allow for this little-known episode in the history of the Great War in the eastern Mediterranean to contribute to the knowledge on (1) the complex French and British wartime stances towards this region, driven by imperialism and humanitarianism; (2) the ability of local elites to draw concessions from the Allies; (3) the important role played by local British and French colonial and military officers; and (4) broader historiographical debates on the responses to the Armenian Genocide. This article explores the origins of how the Entente co-opted Armenians in their eastern Mediterranean campaigns, but also made them into pawns in the French and British reinvention of their imperial rivalry in this region in order to achieve their post-war imperialist agendas.\n\nThroughout history, colonial and foreign legions have been a part of larger armies but rarely have they been as politically ‘loaded’ as the three proposed during the Great War to the British government. Cypriot, Armenian and Jewish political elites proposed the formation of volunteer legions in the British army in late 1914 and early 1915. These were all initially rejected. It would be easy to assume that the British rejected them on purely military grounds, but the primary sources show that they were rejected for political as well as military reasons. In 1916 the British agreed for the French to establish the Armenian legion, while in April 1917 the British agreed to establish a Jewish legion. When the French and British authorities accepted the Armenian Legion in the French army and the Jewish Legion in the British army respectively, the same political reasons for initially rejecting them were overcome or set aside. Imperialism was the key to understanding both the initial rejecting of all three and then the acceptance of those two: the Cyprus proposal threatened British rule in Cyprus and so was never accepted; the Armenian proposal did not play into British imperial interests, but once the British accepted French imperial interests in Cilicia in the Sykes-Picot Agreement the British accepted it; while the Jewish Legion was accepted after the British embarked on their conquest of Palestine. Using British, French and Cypriot archives, this article explores the official British reasoning for rejecting offers of Cypriot, Armenian and Jewish Legions and then accepting the latter two during the Great War.\n\nThe final dissertation for the LSE MSc Programme Theory and History of International Relations, this paper analyses the fluctuating British foreign policy in regards to the Armenian Question. It argues that while humanitarian politics existed inside the civic sphere and translated to soft interventionism under the liberals in 1895, the nascent and wide humanitarian movement failed to convert rhetoric into praxis on the international stage. Thus, humanitarianism prior to 1945 was an historical chimera in two senses: scientific in that it was constructed of numerous parts, and literal in that it failed to change the face of foreign policy.\n\nIn the context of the commemorations of the Great War, it is worth recalling the Gallipoli or also know as the Dardanelles campaign in 1915 as a turning point on the eastern front of the war and as an event that meant the end and the beginning of events that are Of vital importance today, a century later: The end of the Ottoman Empire as an administrative organ that ruled in the Middle East for almost five centuries and the beginning of imperialist intervention in this region, with its consequent generation of conflicts. As well as a new beginning for hundreds of immigrants from the Ottoman dominions that arrived until Colombian coasts. Gallipoli synthesizes the end and the beginning of a new world in the middle of an impossible battle. At last the year has come, the date many historians, especially those who study war or military affairs, looked forward to rediscover, rethink and rewrite the history of the Great War. 2014 marks the beginning of a series of commemorations, events and publications that will once again bring to the forefront one of the most definitive and defining armed conflicts in the history of humanity on the occasion of its centenary. But in spite of this, one can approach the main bookstores in any city, and see in the canopies and shelves, illustrated books on the Wermacht, on Sherman or Panzers tanks, in better locations-and surely sales-than books that commemorate the hundred years of the Great War."
