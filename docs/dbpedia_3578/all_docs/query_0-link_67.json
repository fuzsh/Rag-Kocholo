        "text": "Bronze Age\n\nFrom times immemorial, the two areas [of Upper and Lower Cilicia] belong together. In the second half of the the second millennium BCE, the entire region, known as Kizzuwatna, was part of the Hittite Empire. Contemporary sources mention the two main cities on the plains: the residence known as Tarša (Tarsus) and Adaniya (Adana). The most important language was Luwian. In those days, the region was ruled by a prince from the Hittite royal family, who was called “priest”.\n\nIron Age\n\nAfter the fall of the Hittite Empire (after 1190 BCE), the two areas were included in a new, “Neo-Hittite” kingdom called Tarhuntassa, which had its capital somewhere in Pamphylia. It is not known how long this state existed. When the Assyrians discovered the region in the ninth century, they called the fertile eastern area Qu’e (with important towns in Karatepe and Adana), and the western area Hilakku (…).\n\nThe plains of Qu’e (also known as Awariku) were first conquered by the Assyrians. King Tiglath-pileser III (744-727) appointed a governor, whose residence was Adana. However, it was not a secure possession of the Assyrian empire: after the death of Sargon II in 705, it became independent again under the old dynasty, the house of Muksa. The ancestor of the Qu’ean royal family is known from Phoenician sources as Mpš, and can (according to an inscription from Karatepe) be identified with the Mopsus from Greek legend, who is said to have founded a town and an oracle in Cilicia. The Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680-669) reconquered the area.\n\nMeanwhile, Hilakku remained independent. The Assyrians were not interested in the underdeveloped mountain area and its poor tribes. However, during the reign of Aššurbanipal (668-631 BCE), Hilakku was threatened by the Cimmerians, a nomadic tribe from the northeast that had already overrun Armenia. Therefore, Hilakku placed itself under Assyrian protection.\n\nIn 612 BCE, the Babylonians and Medes captured the Assyrian capital Nineveh (more). Hilakku survived the collapse of Assyria. A new kingdom came into being, in which both areas were united. Its capital was Tarsus. The Greeks rendered the title of its kings, suuannassai, as syennesis, and the name of the country as Cilicia.\n\nThe first syennesis we know about, is mentioned by the Greek researcher Herodotus of Halicarnassus (fifth century BCE). He tells that in 585, the syennesis and one Labynetus of Babylon (probably the future king Nabonidus) negotiated a peace treaty between king Alyattes of Lydia and Cyaxares, the leader of the Medes. The story confirms that Cilicia was at this time an independent power and did not belong to the Babylonian empire of king Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nThis syennesis was succeeded by one Appuašu, who withstood an invasion of the Babylonian army under king Neriglissar in 557/556 (ABC 6). It had been argued that Cilicia was invaded because it had become a protectorate of the Median empire, or may have appeared to have become a Median subject. We cannot know.\n\nPersian period\n\nIt is certain that in 547/546, the Persian king Cyrus the Great campaigned in the countries west or north of the Tigris. Unfortunately, our source (the Chronicle of Nabonidus) contains a lacuna. It is not impossible (but unlikely) that Lydia is meant, where king Croesus was defeated. However, this may be, at some time in the 540s, Cyrus added Cilicia to the Achaemenid empire, making the syennesis (perhaps Appuwašu) a vassal king. Babylonian sources do not mention imported Cilician iron after 545, which strongly suggests that there were no trade contacts any more.\n\nAfter the reign of a man named Oromedon, who is just a name, the next syennesis is better known. The Persian king Xerxes chose Cilicia to gather a large army to attack the Greek homeland (481 BCE). Next year, the syennesis served as one of the commanders in the Persian navy. He is known to have married his daughter to Pixodarus, a Carian leader.\n\nAt this stage, we begin to know a bit more about the way the Persians governed and used Cilicia. Its capital was Tarsus, where the loyal syennesis had its residence. We may assume that there was a Persian garrison. At several other places, we find military bases, mostly along the sea coast. The coastal plain often served to assemble armies. Although Cilicia had a native king, it had to pay tribute: 360 horses and 500 talents of silver, according to Herodotus.\n\nDuring the Persian era, the fertile Cilician plains were the most important part of the satrapy. The relations between the inhabitants of the cities and those of the villages in the eastern mountains were sometimes less than friendly. After all, the people from the plains were sedentary agriculturalists and the mountain people were roaming herdsmen. It is certain that in the fourth century, the two groups sometimes came to blows, and we may assume that this was also true in the fifth century.\n\nThere were several important sanctuaries that remained more or less independent from Persian rule. One of the most important was that of a mother goddess that was called Artemis Perasia by the Greeks and Cybele by everybody else. Her shrine was at Castabala in the northeast. During the reign of king Artaxerxes II Mnemon, the Castabalans briefly revolted, but they were subdued by general Datames.\n\nAnother sanctuary was Mazaca, which must have been more to the Persians’ taste. Here, the sacred fire was worshipped. Another site of religious importance was the oracle at Mallus.\n\nAt the end of the fifth century, the third known and probably last syennesis was ruling Cilicia. He became involved in a civil war between Artaxerxes II and his brother Cyrus the Younger. When the latter approached the Cilician gate, the syennesis was forced to side with him. However, after the defeat of Cyrus at Cunaxa near Babylon, the syennesis’ position was difficult and he was dethroned. This marked the end of the independence of Cilicia. After 400, it became an ordinary satrapy.\n\nOne of its satraps was the Babylonian Mazaeus (361-336). His successor was expelled by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great, who conquered Cilicia in the summer of 333, and fell ill at Tarsus (text). After some time, he recovered and attacked the Cilicians of the Taurus mountains. This was probably a police action against the herdsmen. The new satrap of Cilicia, a man named Balacrus, was given special orders to attack the mountain people. Unfortunately, he was unable to overcome the herdsmen of Isaura, a tribal formation that now appear in history and was to play a role in the following centuries.\n\nHellenistic Period\n\nAfter the death of Alexander in Babylon (11 June 323), Cilicia was first part of the kingdom of Antigonus Monophthalmus, who had been appointed as satrap of Phrygia. When he was defeated at Ipsus (301), Cilicia was divided by Ptolemy I Soter and Seleucus I Nicator, two former friends of Alexander. From now on, the coastal towns belonged to the Ptolemaic empire, and the interior became, after some confusion, part of the Seleucid empire. Twice, the region was contested: in the Second Syrian War (260-253), the Ptolemaeans gained ground, but in the Fifth Syrian War (202-195), king Antiochus III the Great captured several Cilician towns (e.g., Anemurium) and all of Cilicia became Seleucid. It remained so for a century, and was thoroughly hellenized. New cities were founded, and the old Luwian language was gradually superseded by Greek.\n\nHowever, after c.110 B.C., the Seleucid power was waning, and the inhabitants of “rough Cilicia”, which had always retained some of their independence, started to behave as pirates. Although both the Seleucid and Roman authorities sometimes launched expeditions against the Cilician pirates, the two governments did not really care. After all, the pirates sold the slaves that the ancient economy could not do without.\n\nIt was only after 80 B.C., when it became clear to the Romans that the Seleucid empire was disintegrating and a power vacuum was growing, that the legions intervened. In 78-74, Publius Servilius Vatia subdued western Cilicia. To commemorate his victory, he received the surname Isauricus. Eastern Cilicia became part of the empire of Tigranes II the Great of Armenia. However, the Cilician pirates remained dangerous, until Pompey the Great attacked them. He settled them in towns and gave them land (67). This turned out to be an excellent settlement. The last Cilician war was conducted by Marcus Tullius Cicero (51-50), who defeated the last independent Cilicians.\n\nRoman Period\n\nDuring the next decade, the Romans were unable to establish their power, because they were involved in two civil wars, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great (49-48) and then between on the one hand Caesar’s heirs Mark Antony and Octavian and on the other hand Caesar’s murderers Brutus and Cassius. When Octavian became sole ruler (after 30 BCE), Cilicia was finally pacified. Parts were given to vassal kings, and the remainder became an appendix to the province Syria. Although the governor of Syria sometimes had to fight against the mountain tribes (e.g., Lucius Vitellius in 36 CE), Cilicia was now a quiet part of the Roman world.\n\nThe emperor Vespasian reunited Cilicia in 72 CE. More than two centuries later, it was divided into two parts by Diocletian: the mountainous west became known as Isauria, and the plains retained the name Cilicia. In the late fourth or early fifth century, the remainder of Cilicia was again divided into two parts, simply called Cilicia I (Tarsus and environs) and Cilicia II (the eastern plains).\n\nLate Antiquity\n\nThe fifth and sixth centuries saw great affluence, but in the seventh century, it became a border zone where the Byzantine Empire was defended against Arab incursions. About 700, the country became Muslim, but it became Byzantine again in 965. Many Armenians were settled in Cilicia, and the country became known as Lesser Armenia. During the Crusades, it became independent. In 1375, this last period of Cilician independence came to an end, when the country became part of the Ottoman empire.\n\nExcerpted from: https://www.livius.org/articles/place/cilicia/\n\nYesaian’s reportage In the Ruins, published in 1911, contains the personal impressions, research, and\n\neyewitness accounts the author gathered in 1909 as a member of a delegation sent by the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate to Constantinople into the province of Adana. After massacres of the Christian population, Armenian orphans were to be located and arranged for help. However, since the possibilities of the delegation were extremely limited, this succeeded only for 500 orphans. Overwhelmed by the overall misery and her own impotence, Yesaian broke off her stay after two and a half months and returned to Constantinople to write – as a ‘means of survival’ to escape mental disruption and an over-identification with the victims.\n\nThe contemporary Armenian elite reacted differently to the mass murder of 1909: while the poets Siamanto and Daniel Varujan, for example, completely lost faith in the Young Turkish ‘revolutionaries’ and called on their readers to fight and resist, Yesaian, despite the mass extermination she documented, clung to the hope that the murdered would remain the last ‘victims for freedom’; however, she did not broach the issue of the Young Turks’ complicity in the crimes. As a truthful reporter, however, she did not conceal the doubts that her interlocutors in Cilicia harbored. She quotes a surviving widow as saying: “As long as we are in this country, we will remain their prisoners. Who can guarantee us that such things will not happen again?” Just five years later, the extermination of the Armenian and Syriac populations began almost nationwide.\n\nThe reprinting of Yesaian’s account by a Turkish publishing house in Istanbul, almost 100 years after its first publication, not only forms a belated tribute in the author’s hometown, but also testifies to current journalistic attempts to come to terms with modern Turkish history. The Armenian literary scholar Marc Nichanian regarded Yesaian’s reportage as one of the most important works in the Western Armenian language.\n\nIn the ruins (1911, excerpt)\n\nWhen it had become very late, we declared the distribution of clothes and other relief supplies finished for the day. The stricken people gathered in the churchyard left in groups, according to their village communities, lamenting their hardships. Silently, we packed the relief supplies for the coming day, when a sharp, piercing voice startled us. Involuntarily, we stepped outside the door. A woman dressed in black and in tears stood before us, surrounded by other women who had suffered the same thing. Silently, they watched her. Not far away, leaning against the wall, a blind woman sang a lullaby. Who knows for which of her missing loved ones?\n\n“His voice still echoes in my ears,” said the weeper. Overwhelmed by memories, she sank to the floor. For a while she could neither speak nor cry. She slapped her hands on her knees, and when her breath ran out, she bent her head back. Her neck stretched, and in a hoarse voice she cried, “O woe, o woe…”\n\nOne cannot imagine the extent of human misfortune. As she fixed her black eyes, filled with tears and pain, on us, we felt uneasy, seized by dizziness. One of our staff went to take her to the Prelacy’s reception room. When he took her hand to help her walk, the sad-filled woman trembled like a child with every step: “O woe, o woe…”\n\nFor a long time we heard nothing, because every time she tried to speak, her voice failed her with sobs. At times her eyes took on the confusion of a madwoman. We had her placed in an armchair, in a resting position, and we tried to soothe her pain. To calm the nervous twitches that her desire to speak had triggered, we left her alone for a while. A little later, stunned by her suffering, she fell asleep leaning on her arm. In her unusually pale face the half-lowered eyelids had turned blue, and through the opening the whites of the eye could be seen, and sometimes the pupil, motionless and pale as in a blind person.\n\nMeanwhile night had fallen, and the light of a candle illuminated the room, though incompletely. The woman had awakened, and as her crisis had subsided, we now learned her horrible story:\n\nThree days after Easter, my husband left the village. To buy wood, he went to Ziyamet with a Turk, Kel Musruh.[10] He was a farmer from our village. Towards evening, we learned from other farmers that my husband had been murdered by his companion. We cried, unaware of what else was written on our black foreheads. The next day, news of the riots reached us, but a friend of our family came and defended us, not allowing anyone to touch a hair on our heads until the evening. My daughters and my son, 18 years old, sat with me and reminded each other all the things their father had planned for the winter. O woe, how did he die? From what weapon? We didn’t know. We were as pale as the wall. And when my daughter rose, she looked like a banshee.\n\nIn a distance we could hear the thunder of firearms. Outside, the dogs were howling, and when they came near an entrance door, their muzzles were open, and they howled for hours. The Turk who was supporting us got confused. Some came from outside, they talked to each other, whispered and soon went on their way, with dirty hands, twisted eyes and foaming at the mouth. Shortly before daybreak, the befriended Turk left us, whether out of fear or on someone else’s orders I don’t know exactly.\n\nA little later they came. Oh horror… everything was looted. When the house and the store were completely empty, the owner appeared, locked the store door, sealed it and took all the documents with him.\n\nWe were left alone and in an inconsolable state, but soon realized that our suffering was not yet over.\n\nMy main concern was not the loss of goods, but the children. I did not know for whom I should weep more. Towards evening, the village chief, Aghze Ganle Mehmet Ağa, came and tried to convince us to seek refuge in his house. My home now lay in ruins, my heart burned as if by fire… My husband had been murdered, I was left all alone in this world… here I had lived, here I was happy: “I will not leave the threshold of my house, I am ready to die here. Leave us here!”\n\nFor a while he remained silent. He was hesitant, soon taking in my son, soon my daughters. He had experienced how my children, playing with his children and grandchildren, had grown up. I could tell he was moved inside. His breath came in gasps, and sweat broke out on his forehead. “Alas, alas,” he said at last, “the day we were born must have been cursed. Pain is written on our foreheads. And we burn, you with one pain, and we with the other pain…”\n\nThen he approached me and whispered in my ear, “From the gatherings out there, I know for sure: they will slaughter you all! I want to take you to my home! You can come or stay here. The choice is yours!”\n\nI threw myself at his feet screaming, “I have lived my life, my hair has turned white. It is not for my sake that I beg you, but for the sake of the children. You are my brother, my supporter. Since there is no other way out, let your will be done!”\n\nSo, together with my children, I went to the house of the village chief.\n\nWe were led into a room from which the chief’s family was retreating: the women were frightened and fled screaming when they saw us, as if we were dead men risen from the dead. There we sat side by side and wept. My hand was on my son’s head, I was stroking my children, one by one. I held my son, my Karapet, close to me. I could only see him in a blur because of my tears. My longing parched my throat like thirst, my mouth, my love… At that moment I had almost forgotten my husband. When my children asked: “Mother, we are safe here, why are you crying?”, I replied: “Because of your father”. Then my children raised their voices, and together we looked at my Karapet. Pale as death, with trembling hands and legs, he walked up and down the room, came and sat down opposite us.\n\nShortly after we entered the village chief’s house, our Turkish neighbor appeared and reported, “Bad, very bad, the news is bad… Burning everywhere, destruction, no more Armenians, no more churches… the Armenian people have been destroyed, their roots uprooted.”\n\nHe stayed a little longer, moving his head back and forth, and spoke, “If you convert to Islam, you will be saved. Otherwise, you will be killed, that much is clear!”\n\nMy elder daughter and I replied in one voice, “Let it be so… since everyone is dead, we too will die. We have been destined for a short life, more of which would not be allowed!”\n\nThe Turk cradled his head and repeated, “It is clear that you will be slaughtered!” Karapet, who had been leaning against the wall, turned yellow as wax, even the flesh on his face trembled. Slowly he came toward us, and with each step his whole body shook. As if he had forgotten how to walk and talk, he opened and closed his mouth a few times, but no voice came out.\n\nWhen he came to us, he embraced my knees, looked at me, then at his sisters, and pleaded: “I am not yet eighteen years old and have not yet lived! Have mercy on me! I want to live, live I want… Let us embrace Islam, what harm if we convert to Islam to live! Mother, I don’t want to die!”\n\nAt first my daughters and I refused and rebuked him, “Living this way is worse than death. Shame on you! The way your father went, we will continue. Our blood is not redder!”\n\n“Mother, I want to live! Live! Live!”\n\nThe Turk was still standing beside us, and every now and then he repeated, “It has been decided to slaughter you!”\n\nFinally, I could no longer bear my son’s pleading, and to save his life, we embraced Islam.\n\nShortly after that, the chief arrived. His eyes slid indecisively over my daughters and son. He acted as if he had pity, making an effort to appear cheerful: “It has filled my heart with joy that we are now fraternized in the same religion. This makes you holy to us… May the cloud of pain and sorrow be passed over your heads!”\n\nFor a while he looked at the Karapet, frozen and pained, then suddenly he reflected and directed his gaze to the ground. For a while we were all silent.\n\n“Bad, bad,” he then raised his voice like the other Turk. “You have converted to Islam and saved your necks from the noose. But it could happen that you are not believed and the authenticity of your faith is doubted… the coming hours are full of sorrow and suffering… I saw the mob like a sea stirred by the storm. They ran through fire and blood, and their bodies and clothes were smeared with blood.”\n\n“Who? What?” I asked, startled.\n\nThe village chief looked me in the eye and said mysteriously, “The mob!”\n\nThen he suggested that I marry my two daughters to Turks in order to inspire confidence among former enemies.\n\nMaral jumped up and cried like a wolf: “Such a thing shall never happen and will not happen! Have you no heart? Are you not human? Have you experienced no suffering, no pain in your lives? Your heart has never had compassion for your children? How dare you make such a proposal to me on such a day of pain?”\n\nThey reassured me and said that the marriage was a mere formality, and that my daughters – the younger one was just twelve years old – would stay with me for another two or three months, and then we would see what happened next. On this assurance, my daughters were married.\n\nWe spent the night, that black night, crying and in mourning, with doubt in our hearts and full of fear. The next day, Mustafa the barber, who had been a professional rival of my husband Karapet, had notified a worker of Khadir Efendi that the village chief had taken in Armenians in his house. Shortly thereafter, unrest arose in the village. We did not know anything for sure, but listened for the noise outside. Was it the noise before the storm? Was it dogs howling or human noise? Or all of them together? Suddenly we heard gunshots, then silence, then storm again. People screaming like wild animals, more rifle shots, then a little silence.\n\nI rose, opened the door of the room and waited. A Turkish woman who was part of the household came over. “For the love of God, what’s going on out there?” I asked her. She covered her face with a dark red headscarf and I could not recognize her. At first she didn’t want to answer and walked past, but then stopped, looked at me and was silent for a while. There were flashes from her eyes, although the opening for the face was in semi-darkness. From the red headscarf I saw her eyes flashing:\n\n“Pigs, Gavurs[11],” she finally said. “Because of you, the peace of our house is violated. Our food and sleep have been desecrated. Like dogs, you have become rabid. Who told you to revolt? With flags in your hands and armed, you stormed into the village to trample it… Where are your fidayins[12] now ? Where are your supporters from the ‘Freedom’ Party Hürriyet ve İtilaf[13]? May the Freedom Party go blind in both eyes, since it has driven you out of your minds!”\n\nBreathing heavily for a while, and still incensed, she continued, “What then was the fault of our Sultan Abdülhamit? What bad thing did he do that they expelled him and put the Freedom Party Hürriyet in his place? Your Gavur-Hürriyet!”\n\nI tried to answer her, but that upset her even more. Almost shouting, she added, “Because Hürriyet is not Islam, can never be Islam!”\n\nAn indescribable noise interrupted our conversation. I couldn’t tell if she was laughing or continuing to rant, but her eyes sparkled under her headscarf, “Damn people! Wherever you appear, you bring sorrow and suffering. They have come to burn down our house just because of you! Your evil existence, when will you leave us? Go away from here, seek refuge elsewhere, and don’t put more people in danger!”\n\nWeary and weak, silent and silenced I cried. Finally, the Turkish woman left, complaining and scolding. In the meantime, Aghze Ganli had sent word for me and my Karapet to come to the Turkish house next door, to the man who had asked us to accept Islam. I was to leave my two small “married” daughters with their families.\n\nThe mob had reached the threshold of the house where we had taken refuge. Through the fanlight we could sometimes see black arms and barrels of firearms. The mob roared like rabid animals.\n\nCrawling through the back door, I went with my son to the Turkish house next door. My daughters, hiding under a mat, stayed behind. Later I learned that the murderers had discovered them there and dragged them outside to kill them. But all at once one of the mob shouted, “We should not kill the women. Also the old, the blind, the severely handicapped, let them live! The rest take with you!” And because they had heard that my two daughters were “married,” they were taken back to the house of the village chief.\n\nThen the crowd flooded toward the house where we were hiding and besieged it, threatening the inhabitants that they would burn the house down if they did not hand over the gavurs.\n\nAfter that, the Turkish women of the house came to us angrily, with angry eyes, and dragged us out. On the doorstep I stood between two swords. My Karapet was as pale as a dead man and unable to hold himself upright. I covered him with my body and shouted, “First you must kill me!”\n\nA black, scrawny face almost touched mine and laughingly said, “There is no order to kill the women! Get lost!”\n\nThen I heard a sound like snoring, as if someone was suffocating. I turned around as… how did I get over that moment… Someone grabbed Karapet’s arm and pulled him. And he resisted. He was pushed to the ground, but managed to free himself from the murderer. In a voice that was strange to me, he shouted, “I am a Muslim! In honor of the Prophet, let me live!”\n\nMy son looked at me without recognizing me. He looked at the crowd, looked at the one who had dragged him to the ground, and moved his mouth to say something else. His breathing was so heavy that it could be heard from far away.\n\n“Well, well,” many answered him, “let’s get you circumcised!”\n\nA few people attacked him at the same time and dragged him away. My son sat down again. His clothes were torn, his knees cracked as they dragged him across the ground. On the ground were the traces of his blood.\n\nScreaming, he tried to turn back: “Mother, they want to kill me! Mother, I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die!”\n\nOh my God! Since then there is not a moment when I do not hear this voice and Karapet’s pale face does not appear before my eyes, because his voice is caught in my ears. His death throes have been imprinted on my eyes.\n\nI ran after him, but did not reach him. I ran back and forth… It seemed to me that everywhere I heard my son’s voice, and so I lost my way, lost my way. After a while, Mrs. Safiye came to me, the sister of Aghze Ganli, grabbed my hand and led me to her home.\n\n“It behooves you to stay with your daughters!”\n\n“And my Karapet?” I asked, almost choked by my tears.\n\n“God’s mercy is great,” she answered, “he did not suffer much!”\n\nI had been expecting the news of my son’s death, but I didn’t want to believe what I was hearing. Petrified with pain, I stopped in front of Mrs. Safiye.\n\n“Sit down,” she said in a saddened voice, taking my hand and forcing me to sit down on the grass where she told me everything. “I was there, I saw everything with my eyes and heard everything. People were like drunk, insane, the son ready to kill his father and the brother to kill the brother. God has ordained such evil moments for us. And to such a moment your son fell a victim!”\n\n“My boy, my boy!” I exclaim. “Your sun went out! Life was so sweet to you. With which weapon did they kill thee? Where were you hit? Where did your wounded body go? Would that I could give you life for the second time! Take light from the light of my eyes, breath from my breath and look around you! Get your fill of life, my boy! How did they kill you?”\n\n“He was taken to the riverside,” Safiye answered, “and there Habib met Karapet: ‘Born on the same earth, lived under the same sky – Habib, between us there is the law of salt and bread! From the same vessel we ate, from the same cup we drank! Spare my youth! ‘ But they did not listen to him and tied his hands. Habib pulled the knife from his belt and stepped closer… ‘I am afraid of the knife! Throw me into the river! ‘ Karapet said for the last time. But Habib approached smiling and plunged the knife to the hilt into his friend’s neck. Then they threw him into the river… The crowd watched as twice the bloody body floated to the surface and then was carried away by the water current. Resulunoğlu Khedir shouted that the river water reddened where the body of the gavur floated along. ‘Perhaps he is still alive?’ The third time Karapet’s body floated to the surface, he shot at him.”\n\n“The world went black for me, Safiye,” I told the Turkish woman, weeping. “All the flashes of God’s wrath are not able to punish your crimes. What day will bring your repentance? You will drown in the tears of mothers, widows and orphans!”\n\nThe more I talked, the paler Safiye became. Trembling, she took my hand and tried to comfort me, “Don’t cry, don’t cry! He was not tormented much! Thank you Allah, he proved to be merciful to you, because how many killed there are who were tortured! What is not told… There is Armenian blood under everyone’s nail!”\n\nShe took me to her brother’s house, where my two daughters were also. Reunited, we cried, but they would not leave us alone. The women of the house and the neighbors were around us. Some mocked our suffering, “Where is Hürriyet now?” Some showed compassion, but the rest reproached us, “You are not crying because of your father or son, but your tears are for your millet, your nation of faith! In each of your tears there is curse and poison for us…”\n\nHalf an hour later the Turkish women came and declared that they had to take the brides away.\n\n“Leave us alone!” I exclaimed, “I have no more strength to argue with you! Let us weep for our losses!”\n\nRealizing that no one was listening to me, I turned to the village chief and reminded him of his promise. But he replied that there was nothing he could do. Together with the Turkish women, gunmen had come to take my daughters away by force, so I was compelled to comply.\n\nA month passed. My husband and son had been murdered, my two daughters kidnapped, my house looted empty. I no longer possessed any hope in this world, when one day a policeman came by and announced that he would accompany me to the military tribunal if I wished to file a complaint.\n\nThe first time, in the face of threats, I told him verbally that I had no complaint, but after a while I did see some hope of punishing the criminals and freeing my daughters. So I found ways and means to send a message about my situation to the delegation of the Armenian Patriarchate based in Adana. Two weeks later, a policeman came to see me again. There was talk that some Turkish criminals had been hanged and many more were full of fear of prosecution. I was allowed to come to Adana under police escort.\n\nIt had until then appeared to me that there was no woman more unfortunate than me, but when I was in Adana I heard thousands of similar stories. I suppressed the sorrow in my heart and submitted a request to the military court three times. But my three petitions remained unanswered. Today I was at the place where the tents for homeless Armenians are set up, and there I also met a Turk from our town.\n\n“I have been looking for you,” he explained courteously, “the husband of your youngest daughter sends word that your accusation is useless. He has heard that you have brought charges against him, as well as against the murderers of Karapet and your husband. But all this is in vain. Look, we are all still on the loose and moving freely.”\n\nI felt sick. Immediately I ran to the military court. My anger was such that none of the bailiffs at the court entrance could restrain me. When I entered the courtroom, everyone was busy and wanted to turn me away, but I spoke loudly about all my sufferings, about everything I had experienced. I suffered a dizzy spell in between, but they didn’t notice because I kept telling.\n\nI told them how my son was dragged back and forth on the floor and how they plunged the knife into his neck, I told them how cruel the women were, how hard-hearted the men were. And further I said how my mother’s heart was stabbed, and how they laugh at me today, sending me the message that I should not hope for my petition and the military tribunal, because all this is a hoax and irrelevant. And behold, the perpetrators move freely, and so it will be until the end.\n\nWhen I had finished, it had become quiet in the hall. I thought no one was there anymore, I was alone. But when I woke up, I found that the staff members who had been sitting there behind the table listening to me were petrified with excitement.\n\nFinally, one began to speak, “The dead do not come back to life. You, woman, find comfort in your children who are still alive… Calamity passes like an evil storm after causing destruction… You must be able to forget the past…”\n\n“The past? The past is my son killed, is my husband slaughtered, my daughters stolen! The past is inscribed in my heart with letters of fire!” One of the military men looked at me intently and wiped the tear track from the corner of his eye with a small pencil. His lips were white, and as his excitement increased, he looked into the notebook opened before him as if he were reading.\n\n“You are young and on the threshold of life! Consider, after all, why I was deprived of my son. Living in this world has become a great burden for me. I hope to find my peace with death. What I have seen and heard is enough to poison the lives of a hundred mothers. I no longer possess any hope. But I have come here to tell you: be just and punish the criminals!”\n\n“What is done is done! Whom shall we punish? Enough blood has been shed. Forget the past!”\n\nThey whispered among themselves, and one of them asked me, “Who looted the goods from your store? Who took the inventory of goods? What amount of money do you still have to get in the village? The military court will do everything necessary to make up for the material damage!”\n\n“I did not come here to get back the looted household items and the inventory of the store. I came here so that the guilty parties would be punished!”\n\n“Before the disaster, we were siblings! Forget about the incident. From now on, we will live like siblings again. Retaliation causes enmity, and peace in this country will not be restored. Also, it will be a good example if you love your enemies as your religion dictates!”\n\nRealizing that they had already forgotten the meaning of my narration and were becoming impatient, I took out my veil and said, “Since you do not want our lawsuit to be litigated, may God judge you. You and your future generations shall be cursed!”\n\nThe hall spun around me, the sound of chairs being moved made me fall silent. They rose, and then they sat down again. And at that moment it seemed to me that the whole world heard my voice:\n\n“Be accursed! Be accursed!”"
