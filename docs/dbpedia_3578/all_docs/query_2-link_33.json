        "text": "In October 1916, the French government agreed with Armenian political elites to establish a Légion of Armenian volunteers in British Cyprus to fight the common Ottoman enemy. Despite British, French, and even Armenian rejections of such a Légion during different times throughout 1915 and early 1916, all sides overcame earlier concerns. Understanding how they managed to overcome these concerns will allow for this little-known episode in the history of the Great War in the eastern Mediterranean to contribute to the knowledge on (1) the complex French and British wartime stances towards this region, driven by imperialism and humanitarianism; (2) the ability of local elites to draw concessions from the Allies; (3) the important role played by local British and French colonial and military officers; and (4) broader historiographical debates on the responses to the Armenian Genocide. This article explores the origins of how the Entente co-opted Armenians in their eastern Mediterranean campaigns, but also made them into pawns in the French and British reinvention of their imperial rivalry in this region in order to achieve their post-war imperialist agendas.\n\nThroughout history, colonial and foreign legions have been a part of larger armies but rarely have they been as politically ‘loaded’ as the three proposed during the Great War to the British government. Cypriot, Armenian and Jewish political elites proposed the formation of volunteer legions in the British army in late 1914 and early 1915. These were all initially rejected. It would be easy to assume that the British rejected them on purely military grounds, but the primary sources show that they were rejected for political as well as military reasons. In 1916 the British agreed for the French to establish the Armenian legion, while in April 1917 the British agreed to establish a Jewish legion. When the French and British authorities accepted the Armenian Legion in the French army and the Jewish Legion in the British army respectively, the same political reasons for initially rejecting them were overcome or set aside. Imperialism was the key to understanding both the initial rejecting of all three and then the acceptance of those two: the Cyprus proposal threatened British rule in Cyprus and so was never accepted; the Armenian proposal did not play into British imperial interests, but once the British accepted French imperial interests in Cilicia in the Sykes-Picot Agreement the British accepted it; while the Jewish Legion was accepted after the British embarked on their conquest of Palestine. Using British, French and Cypriot archives, this article explores the official British reasoning for rejecting offers of Cypriot, Armenian and Jewish Legions and then accepting the latter two during the Great War.\n\nThis book brings to light one of the least known, yet most turbulent periods in the history of the Armenian military and its complex relationship with the Byzantine Empire. In its first part, Armen Ayvazyan embarks on a military-historical analysis of the Armenian uprising against Emperor Justinian’s government in 538-539. While revealing and evaluating various tactical elements and stratagems employed by the Armenian forces, he carefully considers earlier and later evidence regarding their military operations, including both conventional warfare and high risk missions such as targeted killings of enemy commanders-in-chief and assassination plots against the heads of colonial administrations. And in the second part, Ayvazyan examines the Byzantine attitudes towards the Armenians and their armed forces, revealing, inter alia, that the underlying source for continuity of the anti-Armenian images with the analogous Roman tradition of prejudice was essentially geopolitical. \"The Armenian Military in the Byzantine Empire: Conflict and Alliance under Justinian and Maurice\" can be read page per page at: https://www.calameo.com/read/000260618b56f011005a3"
