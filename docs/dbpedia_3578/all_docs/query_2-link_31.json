        "text": "In October 1916, the French government agreed with Armenian political elites to establish a Légion of Armenian volunteers in British Cyprus to fight the common Ottoman enemy. Despite British, French, and even Armenian rejections of such a Légion during different times throughout 1915 and early 1916, all sides overcame earlier concerns. Understanding how they managed to overcome these concerns will allow for this little-known episode in the history of the Great War in the eastern Mediterranean to contribute to the knowledge on (1) the complex French and British wartime stances towards this region, driven by imperialism and humanitarianism; (2) the ability of local elites to draw concessions from the Allies; (3) the important role played by local British and French colonial and military officers; and (4) broader historiographical debates on the responses to the Armenian Genocide. This article explores the origins of how the Entente co-opted Armenians in their eastern Mediterranean campaigns, but also made them into pawns in the French and British reinvention of their imperial rivalry in this region in order to achieve their post-war imperialist agendas.\n\n8 Krikorian, Robert O., ‘In defence of the homeland: New England Armenians and the Légion d'Orient’, in Mamigonian, Marc A., ed., Armenians of New England: celebrating a culture and preserving a heritage (Belmont, MA, 2004), pp. 24–31Google Scholar. Not much academic material exists, mostly memoirs. Of note is the exhibit honouring the Armenian Légion titled ‘Forgotten heroes: the Armenian Légion and the Great War’, which was held in the Armenian Library and Museum of America from Sept. 2001 to the end of Feb. 2002.\n\n17 For British liberal imperialism in the Ottoman Empire, see Varnava, Andrekos, British imperialism in Cyprus, 1878–1915: the inconsequential possession (Manchester, 2009)Google Scholar; and Varnava, Andrekos, ‘British and Greek liberalism and imperialism in the long nineteenth century’, in Fitzpatrick, Matthew P., ed., Liberal imperialism in Europe (London, 2012), pp. 219–40CrossRefGoogle Scholar.

He was in charge of the first fort at the Dardanelles entrance and was awarded for his bravery in stopping the British attempt to force the Dardanelles.
