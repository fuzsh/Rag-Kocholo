B. Dirks, G. Eley and S. B. Ortner (eds) Culture/Power/History: A Reader in Contemporary Social Theory (Princeton University Press) 336–72.\n\nThe hyphenated term S-LD refers to a diverse global diaspora of out-migrants from the Syrian provinces and Lebanese mountains of the Ottoman Empire, which at the close of the First World War contributed to the articulation of various visions of post-Ottoman political community in the Eastern Mediterranean (and in their varied countries of residence), even as the emergent political units that later became Syria and Lebanon had not yet crystallised during a period of political flux that culminated in two decades of joint rule of those countries — as a League of Nations ‘A’ Mandate — by France. Names of diaspora members known for their writings are rendered in keeping with the conventions of Arabic transliteration, while all others are given as listed in archival documents.
