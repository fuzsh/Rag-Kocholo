        "text": "PARIS (AP) ‚Äî When France hosts grandiose ceremonies commemorating D-Day, the heroic role of Missak Manouchian and other foreigners among French Resistance fighters in World War II is often overlooked. French President Emmanuel Macron sought to change that Wednesday by inducting Manouchian into the country‚Äôs Panth√©on national monument.\n\nA poet who took refuge in France after surviving the massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turks, Manouchian was executed in 1944 for being a leader in the resistance to the Nazi occupation.\n\nMacron praised Manouchian‚Äôs ‚Äúlove for France to the point of giving his life‚Äù in a speech at the Panth√©on, the resting place of France‚Äôs most revered figures, in the presence of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.\n\n‚ÄúHe wanted to be a poet, he became a soldier in the shadows,‚Äù Macron said.\n\nThe moving tribute also honored 23 other members of Manouchian‚Äôs Resistance group. Their names, to be mentioned on a commemorative plaque, were read one by one, followed by the phrase ‚ÄúDied for France,‚Äù a high honor in the country.\n\n‚ÄúThis is how great men in France live for eternity,‚Äù Macron said.\n\nThe coffins of Manouchian and his wife, M√©lin√©e, both covered with the French flag, were carried in the street in front of the Panth√©on by soldiers of the Foreign Legion.\n\nM√©lin√©e, also a member of the Resistance who survived the war, will be buried alongside her husband.\n\nThe move comes as France gets ready to celebrate the 80th anniversary of D-Day this year in the presence of heads of states and World War II veterans.\n\nHistorian Denis Peschanski, who led efforts to honor Manouchian‚Äôs memory, said Wednesday‚Äôs ceremony was above all an homage to ‚Äúall foreign Resistance fighters.‚Äù\n\nOn Tuesday, a homage was held at Mont Val√©rien, where Manouchian and his group members were shot by the Nazis. The site has become a memorial to French WWII fighters. The Holocaust Memorial in Paris also was holding an exhibit in his honor\n\nBorn in 1906 in the then-Ottoman empire, Manouchian lost both his parents during the massacre of some 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1916. Scholars widely view the event as the first genocide of the 20th century, but Turkey denies that the events constituted genocide and says the number of people killed was much lower.\n\nManouchian was sent to an orphanage in Lebanon, then a French protectorate, where he discovered French language and culture.\n\nHe came to France in 1924. Living in Paris, he wrote poetry and took literature and philosophy classes at the Sorbonne University ‚Äî while working in factories and doing other odd jobs.\n\nHe joined the communist party in the early 1930s within the MOI (Immigrant Workforce Movement) group and became editor-in-chief of a newspaper for the Armenian community.\n\nDuring World War II, he joined the French Resistance as a political activist with the then-underground MOI group.\n\nIn 1943, he became a military chief in the armed organization of the communist party, the FTP-MOI group of about 60 Resistance fighters that gathered many foreigners from Armenia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain, including many Jewish people.\n\nManouchian is the first foreign and first communist Resistance fighter to be inducted into the Panth√©on, Peschanski noted.\n\nHis group led dozens of anti-Nazi attacks and sabotage operations in and around Paris between August and November 1943, including the assassination of a top German colonel.\n\nTracked down by the French police of the Vichy regime that collaborated with Nazi Germany, Manouchian was arrested on Nov. 16, 1943 along with most of the group‚Äôs members. He was sentenced to death in Feb. 1944.\n\nNazi propaganda officers ordered a poster to be made with the photos and names of 10 Resistance fighters, including Manouchian, displayed in Paris and other French cities.\n\nThe so-called ‚ÄúRed Poster‚Äù sought to discredit them as Jews, foreigners and criminals, and Manouchian was ‚Äúobviously the first target,‚Äù Peschanski said. Yet the campaign didn‚Äôt convince the French population, he said: The poster, while ‚Äúaiming to present them as assassins, made them heroes.‚Äù\n\nIn his last letter to his wife, Manouchian wrote: ‚ÄúAt the moment of death, I proclaim that I have no hatred for the German people ... The German people, and all other people will live in peace and brotherhood after the war.‚Äù\n\nFrench poet Louis Aragon wrote a poem in 1955 inspired by the letter that singer L√©o Ferr√© set to music under the title ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAffiche Rouge‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Red Poster‚Äù), keeping the memory alive and making the song a French standard.\n\nDuring Wednesday‚Äôs ceremony, French rock band Feu! Chatterton performed the song, while a big reproduction of the Red Poster was set up in front of the Panth√©on.\n\nA lighting show on the monument‚Äôs facade recounted Manouchian‚Äôs life. The homage also included touching excerpts from his letters and notebooks.\n\n‚ÄúMissak Manouchian, you enter here as a soldier with your comrades, those of the poster, of the Mont Val√©rien ... and with all your band of brothers who died for France,‚Äù Macron said.\n\nRecent research about Manouchian brought to light the fact that dozens of the 185 foreigners shot to death by the Nazis at Mont Val√©rien had not been officially declared ‚ÄúMorts pour la France‚Äù (‚ÄúDied for France‚Äù) ‚Äî ‚Äúmostly because they were foreigners,‚Äù Peschanski noted. The French presidency said the issue was addressed last year to give them the honor.\n\nThe Panth√©on is the resting place of 83 people ‚Äî 76 men and seven women ‚Äî including Manouchian and his wife."
