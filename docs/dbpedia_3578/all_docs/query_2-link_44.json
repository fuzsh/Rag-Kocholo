        "text": "The photographs, documents and objects displayed on this page are part of Peter, Steve, and Aris Jr. Ohanessians' collection in Buffalo, New York. The Ohanessian brothers graciously put their family archive at Houshamadyan's disposal. The photographs depict Peter, Steven and Aris Jr.'s grandmother, Satenig Kaynakian (née Kizirian), born in Gurin/Gürün in 1902 and died in the US in 1996, and their grandfather, Dikran Kaynakian (also spelled Dickran), who was also born in Gürün in 1893/1894 and died in the US in 1975. Dikran Kaynakian’s father was Kevork Kaynakian, while his grandfather was Manoug Agha Kaynakian.\n\nThe Kaynakian family is originally from Gürün; we know that in 1913, Dikran Kaynakian had left his native Gürün and gone to Nashua and Manchester (New Hampshire, United States), to work in a shoe factory. Dikran had 4 brothers: Hovhanness, Soukias, Manuel and Samuel, and one sister, Takouhi. Dikran’s brothers Manuel and Hovhanness lived in Sivas/Sepasdia while Dikran’s parents continued to live in Gürün. His mother's name was Mary Vranian (later Kaynakian). In 1920, Dikran’s sister Takouhi immigrated to the US along with her parents, they settled in Richmond Virginia.\n\nLike many other families, the Kaynakian family members were also dispersed as a result of the Genocide. Many of them died, while some of the family members who survived settled in Cilicia in 1919, like many other survivors. We also know that in 1917, Dikran would leave the States and would first go to France, then to Egypt to join the Eastern Legion, which was later called the Armenian Legion. While having joined this unit fighting alongside the Allied armies, we find Dikran in Beirut, Adana, Marash, Kurtkulağı, and later again in Adana.\n\nDikran and Satenig would marry in Adana in August 1920. The following month they would leave Cilicia. They stayed in Marseilles, France for a few months and later went to the States.\n\nThis photograph was taken in 1920 in Adana or Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nWe know that Satenig and her family lived in Beirut after her father died but we don’t know for how long. It is possible that the photo was taken when Dikran was visiting Beirut while Satenig was there. It is also possible that the photo was taken back in Adana, as it is around the same time that Dikran and Satenig got married in Adana.\n\nThe gentleman sitting in the center is Dikran Kaynakian, born in Gürün in 1893 or 1894. He was the grandson of Manoug Agha Kaynakian, and died in Richmond VA in 1975. He was a volunteer in the Eastern Legion (later also the Armenian Legion).\n\nThe women standing from left to right are:\n\nYeghsapet Canarian (Satenig’s sister in law’s sister in law).\n\nTakouhi Vartanian (née Kaynakian, Dikran's sister).\n\nMargaret Kazarian (the wife of Satenig’s and Manea’s uncle, who died in Argentina).\n\nSatenig Kaynakian (née Kizirian, Dikran’s future wife).\n\nSitting from left to right are:\n\nMariam (surname unknown), she is Satenig's sister's, Manea Kazarian’s sister-in-law.\n\nSergeant Dikran Kaynakian wearing his Armenian Legion uniform.\n\nSatenig's sister Manea Kizirian (the latter’s husband died fighting on the Russian front during WWI).\n\nAram (surname unknown); he is Dikran’s nephew (his sister’s son, she is not in the photo), Aram later died in South America.\n\nA letter from Manuel Kaynakian written on 26 October 1914, in Sivas/Sepasdia, addressed to his brother Dikran Kaynakian, Manchester, New Hampshire, USA.\n\nFrom the letter, it is revealed that some members of the family live in Sivas while Manuel and Dikran’s parents live in Gürün. Among those living in Sivas are the following: Dirouhi, Yeranouhi, Verohitsa (?) and George (they are family members of Dikran’s brother Samuel). Manuel also tells his brother that in order to address a letter to their father, Kevork Kaynakian, he needs to write the address of the Prelate in Gürün on the envelope. We also learn that Manuel and Dikran have another brother named Hovhanness.\n\nRegarding the reigning incertitude at the time, Manuel writes: “We have currently an indefinite situation, the present is not certain and neither can we foretell the future.”\n\nA letter from Takouhi Kaynakian addressed to his brother Dikran Kaynakian, dated: 18 November 1919, Adana.\n\nWe understand from this letter that Dikran was first in Marash, then in Kurtkulağı (in the Cilician plain, to the south of Hamidiye/Cihan) supposedly as a soldier in the Armenian Legion. Takouhi had reached Adana through Beirut. After WWI, Beirut – just like other big Arab cities – had become the meeting place of exiled and surviving Armenians from Syria, Mesopotamia and Bilad al-Sham. After spending some time in these cities, the surviving immigrants would be sent back to Cilicia. It is very probable that Takouhi also went through this route.\n\n1) During WWI, Dikran left the United States and went to Egypt to join the Eastern Legion. We learn from this document that Dikran first reaches the port city of Bordeaux in France, and registered as a volunteer in the French army on 9 July 1917. This document was issued on 6 May 1920, when Dikran was in the process of leaving his services in the Armenian Legion.\n\n2) A certificate of appreciation for Dikran Kaynakian, dated: 30 September 1918, and signed by lieutenant-colonel Romieu of the Eastern Legion. The document mentions Dikran’s heroism in battle, thus he was awarded the bronze War Cross 1914-1918 (Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 avec étoile de bronze)."
