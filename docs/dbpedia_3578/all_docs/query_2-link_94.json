The document discusses the Armenian Legion, which was formed in 1916 on Cyprus during World War I and the Armenian Genocide. The Legion consisted of over 4,000 Armenian volunteers who were trained by French officers to liberate Cilicia from the Ottoman Empire and establish an Armenian state. The volunteers trained for over two years in a camp in Cyprus before being deployed to Palestine and Cilicia. Though the Legion was dissolved in 1920, it played an important role in modern Armenian history and the memory of the volunteers is commemorated at a group grave in Cyprus.",
