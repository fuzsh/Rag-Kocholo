        "text": "Public health promotes and protects the health of all people and their communities.\n\nThis science-based, evidence-backed field strives to give everyone a safe place to live, learn, work and play.\n\nWhy is public health important?\n\nPublic health improves our quality of life, helps children thrive, reduces human suffering and saves money.\n\nEvery day, the public health field is working – often behind the scenes – to prevent hazards and keep people healthy. For example, public health is responsible for:\n\nTracking disease outbreaks and vaccinating communities to avoid the spread of disease.\n\nSetting safety standards to protect workers.\n\nDeveloping school nutrition programs to ensure kids have access to healthy food.\n\nAdvocating for laws to keep people safe, including smoke-free indoor air and seatbelts.\n\nWorking to prevent gun violence.\n\nAddressing the impact of climate change on our health.\n\nDeclaring racism as a public health crisis.\n\nSign up for APHA’s newsletters to stay informed on the latest in public health.\n\nWho are public health professionals?\n\nPublic health work spans government, business and nonprofit sectors. Here are some examples of public health professionals:\n\nRestaurant inspectors Health educators Community health workers Scientists and researchers Nutritionists Community planners Social workers Epidemiologists Public health physicians and nurses Occupational health and safety professionals Policymakers Sanitarians First responders Biostatisticians\n\nWhat’s the difference between health care and public health?\n\nThe health care industry treats people who are sick, while public health aims to prevent people from getting sick or injured in the first place.\n\nPublic health also focuses on entire populations, while health care focuses on individual patients.\n\nHow does the American Public Health Association advance public health?\n\nAPHA champions the health of all people and all communities. We strengthen the public health profession. We speak out for public health issues and policies backed by science.\n\nWe are the only organization that combines more than 150-years’ perspective, a broad-based member community and the ability to influence federal policy to improve the public’s health.\n\nAPHA publishes the American Journal of Public Health and The Nation’s Health newspaper. At our Annual Meeting and Expo, thousands of people share the latest public health research.\n\nWe lead public awareness campaigns such as Get Ready and National Public Health Week. We work closely with our affiliates to improve health at the state and local level.\n\nTogether, we are creating the healthiest nation. Explore the topics and issues APHA is currently working on.\n\nHow can I get involved in APHA?\n\nBecome a member and join more than 25,000 public health professionals who are committed to building a healthier nation in one generation.\n\nSpeak out for public health and shape the national debate on critical policy issues.\n\nFollow APHA on social media and subscribe to our newsletters to stay connected.\n\nDonate to APHA to invest in our mission with a tax-deductible contribution.\n\nLearn more about public health from APHA members in this video:"
