As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers.”\n\n27. “Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are.”\n\n28. “To Desire is to Obtain to Aspire is to Achieve”\n\n29. “Cherish your visions.
