        "text": "Fired up NCAA 25 in the name of research this afternoon and took on Illinois for my first test run in the latest entry of the series and the first college video game since 2013.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n— Let's start with a big one right away. I am no longer good at video games.\n\nIt's fair to wonder if I ever was, but I had a nice run in an eight person online dynasty in 2012 and I managed to get second in a few tournaments held for Madden and NCAA Football at various times in my life, usually by choking the life out of the opponent with a combination of strong defense and the world's most methodically boring run heavy offense, while waiting for the right opportunity to hit a pass over the top.\n\nBut Monday's opening contest of NCAA 25 cemented something I've been dreading and that's the reality check of next-generation gaming, a decade of ignoring Madden and simply not being able to see and process the field very well. Perhaps I'll get better, but it's far more likely I've peaked and the current result remains hideously bad.\n\n— Played my first game as Nebraska against Illinois at home. The opening graphics of the contest included a shot of Memorial Stadium, players hitting the horseshoe and a condensed Tunnel Walk type scene as they entered on the field.\n\nThe crowd was hot for the action and I kicked off to the Illini. Since I picked up the game cold and didn't know what I was doing I neglected to add any power to the kick and Illinois fielded it at the 30 and added a few more yards before Donte Dowdell ran into the return man.\n\nAfter a mistake on defense I found my sea legs and proceeded to shut down Luke Altmeyer and the Illini offense, forcing a punt that was shanked out of bounds.\n\nAfter a pair of early runs picked up a quick first down I decided to put the ball in the air. And what a mistake it proved to be.\n\nAfter noticing Thomas Fidone, my first choice on the play was covered, I realized Jahmal Banks had sat down and was open on a curl. I hammered the corresponding button and the Illini defender easily jumped the route for a Pick-6.\n\nWhat a start to video game Dylan Raiola's career and what a realization for how bad things were going to get for me.\n\n— On the subsequent drive I ran Rahmir Johnson a few more times, realized the short passing game was going to be effective and moved into Illini territory, where once again I made a terrible, terrible decision and the Illini made me pay.\n\nThis time the interception didn't go for a touchdown, but it allowed Illinois to make a 48-yard field goal (Big Ten special teams) and I was down 10-0.\n\nThat's when a video game truism happened — just chuck deep to a fast guy. I called a route that saw Jaylen Lloyd fly by a safety caught in coverage and Raiola hit him in stride. It was a moment so beautiful that it seemed to galvanize the team.\n\nFrom there the virtual Blackshirts forced a pair of interceptions, setting up a tying field goal before half.\n\nAnd on the opening drive I learned from my mistakes and ran it down the Illini's throat. Johnson left. Johnson right. Johnson up the middle. Impact player Bryce Benhart ate some poor defensive back's lunch on a stretch play and it opened up a big hole.\n\nEventually, while carefully avoiding the temptation to pass, Johnson powered into the end zone and I had successfully finished off a long clock chewing drive. The Blackshirts were flying around. Memorial Stadium was buzzing.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n— The computer tended to have scattershot play calling during the first two-plus quarters but late in the third and throughout the fourth AI Illinois lit up Nebraska's secondary. Suddenly every play featured some Illini receiver wide open while I couldn't generate any pressure. I also inadvertently messed with the camera angles so suddenly I was playing from a pulled out view and then a side broadcast view.\n\nMaking matters worse impact player Tommi Hill, who picked off a ball earlier, became a whipping boy for Mario Sanders II and Malik Elzy. I'd press in coverage to try to help my pass rush and Altmeyer would flick a go-route to Sanders and Elzy, who somehow outran Hill on consecutive long plays.\n\nRattled I reverted to my own poor play again, tossing an interception yet again. The Illinois took the lead. I battled back to tie it at 24.\n\nThen Elzy broke free again. This time for a 75-yard score. I tossed another interception on a 4th and forever and it was over. Even virtual Nebraska struggles with Illinois. Or at least when I'm in charge.\n\n— Raiola is going to be fun for people to play with as the quarterback has enough speed to be a threat to run, but can also hit on some nice passes.\n\n— The drag routes to Fidone seem like the perfect underneath plays pending defensive coverages.\n\n— That Jaylen Lloyd speed is nice on outs, ins, drags and, of course, the verticals.\n\n— I don't think I got close to a sack all game. Not sure if that's me or the ratings of Nebraska's players.\n\n— Despite the loss the game is definitely addicting and, at least for me, challenging. The computer defense will close windows quickly. You have to throw open receivers to spaces on the field with a little more urgency than in previous iterations. Defensively it's harder to use a lineman and wreck a play. Several times I'd try to switch defenders while the ball was in the air and I'd find myself running away with a safety behind the receiver then with the cornerback who should be in stride.\n\n— Nebraska's roster is interesting. Someone named M. Beckwith is the starting running back. Gabe Ervin doesn't appear to be on the game at all. Ben Scott and Micah Mazzccua have some odd ratings given their success as linemen in college football. The same could be said for Ty Robinson, who should probably in the 80s.\n\nThere's no Ceyair Wright but that seems like something that could be changed with a roster update.\n\n— Even with my poor showing it's easy to see all the hours that will be logged as I try to figure out if my video game skills are completely diminished or just merely rusty."
