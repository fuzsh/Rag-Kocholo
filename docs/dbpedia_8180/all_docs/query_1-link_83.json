Andrews Forestry Sciences Laboratory”.\n\nView All »\n\nDoes 8 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1969 to May 1978, Allen missed 165 of 4,867 roll call votes, which is 3.4%. This is better than the median of 12.1% among the lifetime records of senators serving in May 1978. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the numbers...\n\nTime Period Votes Eligible Missed Votes Percent Percentile 1969 Jan-Mar 17 0 0.0% 0th 1969 Apr-Jun 26 0 0.0% 0th 1969 Jul-Sep 44 1 2.3% 18th 1969 Oct-Dec 158 13 8.2% 18th 1970 Jan-Mar 100 3 3.0% 14th 1970 Apr-Jun 92 0 0.0% 0th 1970 Jul-Sep 123 0 0.0% 0th 1970 Oct-Dec 106 10 9.4% 35th 1971 Feb-Mar 25 1 4.0% 11th 1971 Apr-Jun 89 6 6.7% 10th 1971 Jul-Sep 109 0 0.0% 0th 1971 Oct-Dec 202 2 1.0% 2nd 1972 Jan-Mar 119 4 3.4% 10th 1972 Apr-Jun 130 1 0.8% 3rd 1972 Jul-Sep 206 1 0.5% 2nd 1972 Oct-Oct 75 0 0.0% 0th 1973 Jan-Mar 67 0 0.0% 0th 1973 Apr-Jun 192 13 6.8% 25th 1973 Jul-Sep 167 13 7.8% 49th 1973 Oct-Dec 168 21 12.5% 61st 1974 Jan-Mar 94 3 3.2% 26th 1974 Apr-Jun 179 5 2.8% 19th 1974 Jul-Sep 138 0 0.0% 0th 1974 Oct-Dec 133 7 5.3% 29th 1975 Jan-Mar 118 1 0.8% 15th 1975 Apr-Jun 141 10 7.1% 38th 1975 Jul-Sep 170 12 7.1% 44th 1975 Oct-Dec 182 27 14.8% 77th 1976 Jan-Mar 109 0 0.0% 0th 1976 Apr-Jun 263 0 0.0% 0th 1976 Jul-Sep 315 1 0.3% 4th 1976 Oct-Oct 13 0 0.0% 0th 1977 Jan-Mar 92 0 0.0% 0th 1977 Apr-Jun 178 0 0.0% 0th 1977 Jul-Sep 233 0 0.0% 0th 1977 Oct-Dec 133 9 6.8% 37th 1978 Jan-Mar 78 1 1.3% 0th 1978 Apr-Jun 83 0 0.0% 0th"
