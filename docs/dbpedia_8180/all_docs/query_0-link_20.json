        "text": "No one actually goes to Firebaugh, California, just to go there. Most likely, if you’re in Firebaugh, you were on your way to or from someplace else and your GPS went haywire and diverted you off Interstate 5 — which runs north-south through the spine of the state, about 20 miles to the west of the two-stoplight town where Buffalo Bills rookie quarterback Josh Allen was born and raised.\n\nThe locals in Firebaugh, about 7,600 in all, have most of the requisite needs and services — police and fire department, a school district, a library, gas stations, a supermarket, auto parts and tire stores, farm supply businesses, boutiques, some dollar stores and thrift shops, and a couple of public parks.\n\nThere are several places to get a bite to eat, such as the Blue Flame Diner, Giant Burger, the Pizza Factory or Hottie Biscotti, though if you’re looking for mainstream, the nearest McDonald’s, Burger King or Taco Bell is 10 miles south on State Road 33 in the thriving metropolis of Mendota. The closest Walmart is 25 miles due east in the town of Madera, and the closest notable city is Fresno, another 20 miles further east and south past the Walmart.\n\nMore: Bills' brass thought Terry Pegula's private plane was going to crash on Josh Allen visit\n\nIn short, when California’s tourism bureau produces videos extolling the virtues of the third-largest state in the union in terms of land mass, No. 1 in terms of population, Firebaugh’s tiny swath of rain-deprived territory in Fresno County is not making the cut.\n\nBut a few years ago, if you were someone involved with the recruitment of high school football players, there was a very good reason to make the trip to Firebaugh. Not that anyone did, mind you.\n\n“I had no offers because no one had ever come out of Firebaugh for football,” Allen said. “It’s not what we’re known for, so coaches didn’t get around to seeing much film, coaches didn’t get out to see me in person.”\n\nHow growing up on a farm shaped Josh Allen\n\nFrom an early age, Allen knew what he didn’t want to do: follow his hard-working father, Joel, into the third-generation family farming business. There was no one in the world he respected more, but farming those 2,000 acres that primarily produce cotton, cantaloupes and wheat was not going to be his calling.\n\n“I had, in my opinion, the greatest role model in the world in my dad,” Allen said. “The things he did for our family to keep food on the table, he’s a smart businessman and a hard worker. It’s something that I look up to, how hard he works to support our family. Having to see your dad wake up before sunrise, coming home after sunset, and helping him in the 105-, 110-degree weather &mldr; there’s no days off. It’s something that’s special to me, something that I believe has helped me get to where I am today.”\n\nWhich is, on an NFL roster, about to embark on a career in professional football, thus fulfilling the dream he’s had since he was a young boy. “A few years ago, I was in junior college, so taking this all in, it's a really surreal moment, just kind of seeing everything that I've dreamt of as a kid is kind of falling into place,” he said.\n\nGrowing up, Allen was a multisport athlete, if for no other reason to avoid having to work on the farm. “Our out was sports and that's what we did,” he said, speaking of himself, his brother Jason, and his two sisters, Nicala and Makenna. “We stayed competitive year-round to try to stay off the farm as much as we could, though we did help out quite a bit.”\n\nAllen was involved in everything from the mainstream sports such as football, basketball, soccer and baseball to karate, gymnastics and swimming, but football was always his best game, the one he hoped would catapult him out of Firebaugh.\n\n“For as long as I can remember, sitting there in our living room watching Monday Night Football, running around the living room table,” Allen said when asked when his interest in football first brewed. “Me and my brother made tracks around that. We’d run around it and my dad would throw us the ball while he was watching the game. There were a few dents in the walls, some broken cases, stuff like that.”\n\nHe moved through the youth football ranks before enrolling at Firebaugh High, which was built in the 1970s on land donated by Allen’s grandfather, Buzz, making it the first high school in town. Previously, once the kids of Firebaugh left eighth grade, they had to attend Dos Palos High which was 15 miles up route 33. Buzz Allen didn’t like it, and he did something about it. The gymnasium was dedicated and renamed in Buzz’s honor in 2014 shortly after he passed away.\n\nHow Josh Allen grew into an NFL prospect\n\nAllen didn’t become the starting quarterback until his junior season, and after throwing for 2,208 yards with 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, he followed that with a superb senior year when he threw for 3,061 yards and 33 TDs and led the Eagles to a school-record 10 victories.\n\nYou know the old saying, “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” That’s germane to Allen’s high school football career. There were no recruiters beating a path to Firebaugh, mainly because, as Allen said, no one is looking for football players in Firebaugh.\n\nBut besides geography, what also worked against him in the recruiting process is that he wasn’t a football-specific athlete. While other QB prospects were honing their craft in the offseason at places like the Manning Passing Academy or Elite 11, Allen was playing on the Eagles’ baseball or basketball teams when he wasn’t working for his father on the farm, or for his mother, LaVonne, in the restaurant she operated in town.\n\nOne of the few schools that knew anything about Allen was nearby Fresno State, but the since-fired coach, Tim DeRuyter, essentially told Allen that because of his low level of high school competition, he didn’t think Allen could compete at the Division I level. When DeRuyter was fired in 2016 and replaced by Jeff Tedford, during Tedford’s introductory press conference athletic director Jim Bartko quipped that Tedford knew where Firebaugh is.\n\nThe truth is, DeRuyter wasn’t alone in his assessment of Allen. When he was in high school, Allen was 6 feet 2 but weighed only 180 pounds (he’s now 6-5, 237), and when you combined that with the level of competition and the fact that he’d had no exposure in the recruiting universe, that’s how he ended up at Reedley Community College on the other side of Fresno, about 75 minutes from Firebaugh.\n\nIn his one season there, it took him until the fourth game to become the starter, whereupon he threw 25 TD passes to just four interceptions. He called it “a necessary steppingstone to get to where I am today,” but even then he barely got a sniff from Division I.\n\nWith no one calling, Allen took it upon himself to send out what he estimated were about 1,000 emails to every head coach, coordinator and position coach across the country, essentially begging for a chance.\n\nHow Syracuse quarterback Eric Dungey helped Josh Allen get a scholarship\n\nThe email read: “Hello coach, my name is Josh Allen and I am a quarterback at Reedley JC out of California. I stand at 6’5” 210 lbs and am a full qualifier, and feel like I would be a great fit in your offensive scheme!” He then invited them to view his highlights by providing a link, and closed the email by saying “Please get back to me at any convenience! Thank you.”\n\nOnly two schools, Eastern Michigan and Wyoming, showed interest, and Wyoming coach Craig Bohl did so only because Oregon high schooler Eric Dungey, whom Bohl thought he had locked up, bailed at the last minute to sign with Syracuse. Once Dungey headed to the Carrier Done, Bohl gave his scholarship to Allen.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it,” Allen said regarding the lack of interest he generated. “I definitely had a chip on my shoulder any time I went to practice or worked out or stepped on the field. It was definitely a big motivating piece of why I played the game.”\n\nAllen missed almost all of his first year and redshirted in 2015 due to a broken clavicle, but then in his two seasons as starter, Allen created a stir in the NFL scouting community. Everyone was intrigued by his perseverance and was blown away by his obvious athletic ability and freakishly strong arm, but people were skeptical of his in-game performance as he finished his time with the Cowboys completing a mundane 56.2 percent of his passes for 5,066 yards with 44 TDs and 21 picks.\n\nAs you might imagine, given that they ultimately chose Allen No. 7 overall in the first round, the Bills did exhaustive due diligence on him. It started with film study of his performance from the 2016 season, and continued when general manager Brandon Beane and other members of the personnel department went to see him play in person in 2017, the same process they employed for all the top quarterbacks.\n\n“The great thing about seeing a guy play live at quarterback is yes, I can see all the stuff that I can watch on film, but I can see all the stuff in pregame,” said Beane. “How’s he interacting with his guys? When they’re going through stretch lines, is he patting them on the butt and getting them going? When they go three-and-out two series in a row, what’s he doing? When he comes off, who’s he talking to? Is he talking to one guy, is he screaming at people, is he a mute? What’s his leadership like? It’s such an important part of playing that position because we all know you’re going to have those days or weeks when you lose three in a row, how’s he going to respond, and can he handle adversity?”\n\nAllen’s underwhelming statistics may have turned off some of the so-called draft gurus, but not the Bills. They watched every throw, multiple times, and assessed things far beyond complete or incomplete, plus tried to project what other top QBs in the draft might have done on a particular play.\n\n“What were his options here?” Beane said. “What would Baker Mayfield have done here? What would Sam Darnold have done? What would Mason Rudolph, any quarterback that was in this thing, how would they have handled it, because they’re all playing at different skill sets, they’re all playing in different offenses.”\n\nOne attribute that was important to Beane is that Allen had “no gimme throws” meaning the short bubble screens that basically require no talent and can easily inflate quarterback statistics. “It was all a traditional pro style, throwing the ball vertically, and you basically have to do your own stats,” Beane said of the Wyoming offense. “How many times did he bail out of there and throw it away, which is an incompletion? How many times did he have to do that vs. this guy and vs. that guy? And you also looked at when he should have made the play, what’s going on?”\n\nHow Josh Allen won the Buffalo Bills over\n\nAfter all the live evaluation and the film review, the Bills met with Allen for the first time at the Senior Bowl, and he came off as extremely likable and intelligent. “That was the first time I got to sit down with him and that was the first time Sean (McDermott) got to see him throw live,” said Beane. “We spent like 30 minutes with him and some other guys there and we really found out how smart he was.”\n\nBeane smiled recalling the interview because he noted that Allen seemed nervous, especially when newly hired offensive coordinator Brian Daboll was peppering him with questions, but when it was done, the Bills’ brain trust came away impressed.\n\nThings only improved once their visit to Wyoming, where they worked him out privately, was complete. “When we left Laramie, we felt really good about Josh,” Beane said.\n\nOn draft night, the Bills began with two first-round picks, Nos. 12 and 22, so they had ammunition to move up to hopefully get Allen. There had been speculation that the top four quarterbacks — Allen, Mayfield, Darnold and Josh Rosen — might all be taken within the first five picks, so Beane knew the price could be costly.\n\nHowever, Mayfield went No. 1 to the Browns, Darnold went No. 3 to the Jets, and with the Giants (2), Browns (4), Broncos (5) and Colts (6) not picking a quarterback, it left Allen and Rosen available in Tampa Bay’s No. 7 slot.\n\nKnowing that one of the other QB-needy teams, namely the Cardinals and Dolphins, might be working the phones to move up, Beane knew it was time to act. He called the Buccaneers with a package that included Buffalo No. 12 pick and both of its second-rounders at 53 and 56 to get his man. As a bonus, Beane retained No. 22, and after he selected Allen, he was later able to package that pick to move up to No. 16 to get linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, giving the Bills what could turn out to be a magnificent first-round haul.\n\nCan Josh Allen be the Bills' starting quarterback in 2018?\n\nIf the spring workouts were any indication, the Bills intend to bring Allen along slowly. They have free agent A.J. McCarron and holdover backup Nathan Peterman, and there’s a chance Allen never gets on the field in 2018. Of course, there’s also a chance he lights it up at St. John Fisher College and in the preseason games, and starts day one in Baltimore.\n\n“There’s been moments along the way through Josh’s career as a Bill to this point where you’re saying, ‘I knew he was here (at this level), but in fact, we think he’s a little bit further along than that in some areas,’” McDermott said. “That said, (there is) still a lot of work to do. We’re not going to put him out there unless we feel like he’s ready and that’s the important part of this, that we develop a nice foundation of strong fundamentals and football knowledge so that he can go out there and execute.”\n\nThis is a kid who hails from Firebaugh, began his post-high school career at a community college, had to beg and plead to get even one Division I offer at Wyoming, and from those humble beginnings worked himself to the upper echelon of the NFL Draft. Working hard has never been an issue, and Allen is ready to put the time in.\n\n“Everybody wants to play, but there can only be one quarterback on the field at one time,” said Allen. “The coaches have talked about it, and they’re going to play whoever’s ready to play. They’re not going to put any pressure on me to be the man before I am the man, and even if I’m not the man, they just want me to become the best quarterback I can be. In turn, be the best teammate I can be.”\n\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\n\nMore: Josh Allen was seventh pick in NFL draft, but remains third string with Buffalo Bills\n\nMore: Is it possible that AJ McCarron or Nathan Peterman will be the Bills' opening day QB?\n\nJosh Allen\n\nPosition: Quarterback\n\nHeight/weight: 6-5/237 pounds\n\nAge: 22\n\nExperience: Rookie\n\nCollege: Wyoming"
