        "text": "When you work on the right thing, it doesn’t feel like work. As Naval Ravikant says above, it looks like work to other people, but it feels like play to you.\n\nYou know if you’ve had this feeling before. Time melts away and suddenly it’s three hours later and all you did was mess around and try and make something cool.\n\nI get this feeling most often with writing. It doesn’t feel like work, but it looks like work to other people. And that’s the secret.\n\nThe Best Kind Of Work Feels Like Play To You But Looks Like Work To Others.\n\nWhen you’re in the flow state of play, you’re creating for the sake of creating. You have an end goal, but you’re mostly experimenting to see what works and what doesn’t. You’re being creative because it’s fun.\n\nStephen King describes this feeling in his book, On Writing:\n\n“Writing is at its best— always, always, always— when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer. I can write in cold blood if I have to, but I like it best when it’s fresh and almost too hot to handle.”\n\nRemember, you’ve found the right kind of work if it looks like work to other people from the outside.\n\nAnyone watching Stephen King slave over his next novel would say it looks like work. And it IS work - he just loves it.\n\nIf what you love to do doesn’t look like work, then it has no utility. You’re not producing any value, or at least there’s no obvious market for the thing you’re doing or creating.\n\nThe last six months of my life have been writing and reading feature film scripts. This feels like play to me but looks like work to other people. Not everyone gets a thrill from writing and reading. I do.\n\nMost importantly, though, there’s a clear market for the products I’m trying to create. Not every project will go forward (in fact, most won’t) but there’s a market for them. And that’s what matters.\n\nThe internet has vastly increased the potential market for the stuff you create. If no one thinks what you’re doing is actual work, test it out on the internet. See if anyone is willing to pay for the stuff you make that you think is cool. You may be surprised.\n\nThe Best Kind of Work Gives You Energy Back.\n\nPlay is play because it’s fun. It gives you energy back as you do it. You feel energized and alive, not exhausted and burnt out.\n\nThat’s why you want to find a career that fires you up - that gives you loads of energy back, no matter how much time you spend doing it.\n\nMy wife knows she’s in the right career because when she’s on set for 12+ hours acting, she has more energy than she’s ever had in her life.\n\nI know I’m in the right place because I can talk about ideas and writing and structure and scenes all day long. I can’t get enough. That’s what you’re looking for.\n\nWhen You Find The Right Thing, No One Can Compete With You.\n\nWhen you’re “playing,” you’re doing it for its own sake. You’re not doing it only for a specific outcome, like to get rich or famous.\n\nYou’re doing it because it lights up your soul - it engages that thing inside you that makes you feel like you’re capable of anything.\n\nAnd because you’re not married to an outcome, over time, you are going to outcompete everyone else who is doing it as “work.”\n\nHere’s Naval explaining how this functions in his own life:\n\n“I’m always ‘working.’ It looks like work to others, but it feels like play to me. And that’s how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing, for sixteen hours a day. If others want to compete with me, they’re going to work, and they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week.”\n\nThat’s the power of finding something that feels like play to you but looks like work to others. For you, it’s like art that’s done for its own sake. It creates meaning in your life. Here’s Naval again:\n\n“Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there’s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing. To me, creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it’s fun, because I’m into the product.”"
