        "text": "Proverb suggesting that lack of free time encourages lack of spirit\n\n\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" is an old proverb that means without time off from work, a person becomes both bored and boring. It is often shortened to \"all work and no play\".[1] It was newly popularized after the phrase was featured in The Shining.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThough the spirit of the proverb had been expressed previously, the modern saying first appeared in James Howell's Proverbs (1659).[3][4][5] It has often been included in subsequent collections of proverbs and sayings.[6]\n\nSome writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in Harry and Lucy Concluded (1825) by the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth:\n\nAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\n\nAll play and no work makes Jack a mere toy."
