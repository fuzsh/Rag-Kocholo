        "text": "Jim Allen leads cyber across the National Security Sector in collaboration with the Booz Allen’s National Cyber Platform. He also enables cyber-related business in other parts of government and in our commercial and international markets.\n\nJim has over 40 years of experience leading or supporting cyber and intelligence missions in the U.S. and abroad. He has advised U.S. and foreign intelligence organizations on intelligence, cyber, technical, and organizational issues; served on advisory boards; and provided expertise to nonprofit and research organizations. He was an adjunct professor for cyber warfare at Georgetown University from 2012 to 2014.\n\nJim joined Booz Allen in 2004 after a distinguished career at the National Security Agency (NSA), including service as deputy director for analysis and production. His assignments included positions with other members of the intelligence community.\n\nPrior to joining the NSA, he served in the U.S. Navy as a cryptologic officer and surface warfare officer, with service afloat and ashore.\n\nJim holds an M.A. in telecommunications from The George Washington University, an M.A. in national security studies from Georgetown University, and a B.A. with distinction in Russian from the University of Virginia.\n\nWhat excites you about working in cyber at Booz Allen? I love that we approach cyber from the bottom up rather than from the top down. We empower tremendously talented people to drive that approach. My job is to create the conditions to support them.\n\nWhy is Booz Allen an ideal firm for you? First, our purpose and values. Through all kinds of challenges, those values have allowed Booz Allen to grow as a firm and me to grow as a person. Second, the firm’s commitment to excellence means that we’re the premier provider in our market, particularly in cyber.\n\nHow do you help your clients prepare for the future? We anticipate the challenges on the horizon. We don’t come to our clients when they already have a problem. We lean forward and help them prepare for what’s coming.\n\nWhat is one of the most pressing needs in cyber? Change the paradigm. There will never be enough cyber professionals to secure what is inherently an unsecured system. That’s the paradigm we have now: Defend systems that are operating in place. We need a preventative and automated approach, rather than a predominately reactive one.\n\nHow do you manage and motivate your people? I help people realize their aspirations. People also have to realize that they really can realize those aspirations, and that we’re here to help them do that.\n\nWhat mentorship advice would you give someone who took on a new leadership role? Listen. Sometimes mentors feel that they need to just give the answers. It’s better to listen and help someone on their journey toward the answer."
