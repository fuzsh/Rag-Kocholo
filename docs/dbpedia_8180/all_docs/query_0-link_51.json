        "text": "John Meillon\n\nWhile the movie may be called Crocodile Dundee, it was actually John Meillon’s character, Wally, who stole the show as Dundee’s on-screen partner. It was such an important part of the movie that John would get to reprise the role of Wally in the Crocodile Dundee sequel that followed!\n\nUnfortunately, Wally would pretty much be the final role he played. John passed away in 1989 from cirrhosis of the liver. He left behind a legacy filled with accolades for his work in theater. His career began early on as a child star on ABC’s “Stumpy.” Shortly after, he made his first appearance on stage. He went on to tour with the Shakespeare touring company at the age of 16. He has said that his work in theater really shaped his career and helped him learn discipline.\n\nMark Blum\n\nSince his portrayal of Richard, the sleazy editor who continuously gets in the way of true love in the movie Crocodile Dundee, Mark Blum continued to rack up some great credits in the industry.\n\nWhile the name Mark Blum might not immediately jog your memory, you have definitely seen him in various films and TV shows. Maybe you remember him as the journalist in \"Capital News?\" He also co-starred in newer TV shows, like \"Mozart in the Jungle.\" When he wasn't acting in front of the cameras, he often took on roles on Broadway. Sadly, the much-loved actor passed away in 2020.\n\nReginald VelJohnson\n\nReginald VelJohnson has become one of the more famous character actors in Hollywood after his minor role as a limo driver in the first \"Crocodile Dundee\" movie. While his role may have been small, he did not let that stop him, and shortly after, his career started to blow up, and the roles kept on coming!\n\nWith co-starring roles in \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard 2,\" and the unforgettable role in the hit show \"Family Matters,\" he quickly became a household name. VelJohnson is well known for playing police officers on television and on the big screen. VelJohnson has an incredible 99 credits to his name.\n\nDavid Franklin\n\nDavid Franklin has acted in 21 films, and is no stranger to the TV world, he has been in over 20 T.V. shows since 1977. What a career! But don’t worry if you have trouble remembering him from the film \"Crocodile Dundee\" in Los Angeles - his career is so much more than that little piece.\n\nDavid Franklin is typically remembered for his smashing roles as Meeklo Braca in the science fiction television series \"Farscape,\" and as Brutus in \"Xena: Warrior Princess.\" Perhaps you recognize him from \"The Matrix Reloaded?\" David Franklin also seems to have found the greatest weight loss program, as he has lost nearly 50 pounds ever since going on a diet containing only vegan food.\n\nDavid Gulpilil\n\nDavid Gulpilil is remembered for starring alongside Paul Hogan in \"Crocodile Dundee\" as Neville Bell. People were impressed with David, who showed some real talent on set. His career would go on to rise with appearances in films such as \"The Proposition\" and \"Charlie’s Country.\" Despite his massive talent, David unfortunately had several run-ins with the law. Instances included violent offenses, such as an arrest for domestic violence for breaking his wife’s arm.\n\nWhile he is not the nicest guy, he continues to wow audiences and is very talented. If you are the kind of person who can separate the actor and his talent from his personal life, then David Gulpilil might just be your guy. If not, then you’re probably hoping that Hollywood stops giving a pass to violent offenders on the basis of talent.\n\nErnie Dingo\n\nErnie Dingo played the role of Charlie in the second \"Crocodile Dundee\" film. After that stint, he continued to find success and went on to become a very busy character actor. While Dingo may not necessarily have reached star status in Hollywood, he has managed to stay really busy.\n\nErnie Dingo has over 34 credits to his name, with his most recent credit being on the TV show \"Redfern.\" If you want to get a taste of his work, the best way to catch him onscreen is online since most of his gigs are pretty much under the radar in the US.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nRick Gonzalez has come a long way since playing bit parts in \"Crocodile Dundee\" in Los Angeles. He has had so many huge roles that it is almost impossible to remember Rick in a role as minimal as his in \"Crocodile Dundee\" in Los Angeles.\n\nHe went on to play many significant roles, such as Timo Cruz from \"Coach Carter\" and Ben Gonzalez on the hit TV series \"Reaper.\" Don’t forget his role as Naps in \"Roll Bounce.\" Currently, he plays a vigilante superhero named Rene Ramirez, “Wild Dog,” on the CW superhero drama series \"Arrow.\"\n\nSteve Rackman\n\nSuperfans of the \"Crocodile Dundee\" films will never be able to forget Steve Rackman as the meathead named Don, especially since he was the one and only guy to kiss Paul Hogan’s character in the first \"Crocodile Dundee.\" Fans remember Rackman, and he would go on to reprise his role in all of the following \"Crocodile Dundee\" films before retiring and moving back to Australia.\n\nSteve moved to Australia when he was just a teenager. From 1973 to 1978, he wrestled in Australia for World Championship Wrestling on the Nine Network. Fans of wrestling in the ’80s will never forget Steve Rackman for his time inside of the wrestling ring as the famous brawler crusher. Today, Steve is a personal trainer at the gym that he runs.\n\nTerry Gill\n\nGill is a well-known character actor. Even though he only appeared in one of the \"Crocodile Dundee\" films, his character is remembered by anyone who has seen it! He portrayed the leader of a group of kangaroo hunters whom Dundee had to fight in the hotel bar. In that memorable scene, Dundee later used a dead kangaroo as a cover to scare the hunters. Since his role in \"Crocodile Dundee,\" Gill would go on to act in a total of 71 films!\n\nTerry was also seen in the recurring role of Detective Jack Grace in the women's prison drama Prisoner. He was also a regular cast member in \"The Flying Doctors\" and played another starring role in \"Blue Heelers.\" He also had a guest role on \"Neighbours.\" He passed away at the age of 75 in 2015.\n\nGerry Skilton\n\nCrocodile Dundee heartthrob Nugget O’Cass was played by Gerry Skilton. Gerry went on to have appearances in all three of the \"Crocodile Dundee\" films. Unfortunately, those appearances would be the only roles on his resume. For some reason, Hollywood stopped sending Gerry audition notices and information, so unfortunately, Skilton had no choice but to retire from acting in 2001.\n\nHis last film was \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles\" — just like so many other actors on this list. He reprised the character in 2010 for a proposed outback-adventure reality series, \"Nugget Gets A Life,\" with permission from Paul Hogan, which he self-financed and had hoped to sell to a network.\n\nJonathan Banks\n\nJonathan Banks has probably had the biggest career success story after being a part of the \"Crocodile Dundee\" films. He has become one of the most in-demand character actors on television today. Prior to Dundee, he was in the films \"Airplane!\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop.\" He got his first big break on the TV series \"Wiseguys.\"\n\nHe has most recently hit it big in his role as a former police officer who turns into a hitman in the AMC series \"Breaking Bad\" and its spinoff, \"Better Call Saul.\" This has even led to Academy Award recognition for the burly character actor, as well as five Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nPaul Rodriguez\n\nThe \"Crocodile Dundee\" films will always remember Paul Rodriguez as Diego, in the third and final installment of the Dundee films. Born in Mexico but raised in Los Angeles, Rodriguez has developed into a diverse and multi-talented entertainer. When it comes to comedians, Paul Rodriguez has had quite a long and incredible career. Rodriguez has starred in many acclaimed films, like \"Ali\" and \"Blood Work.\"\n\nIn 2004, he was ranked #74 on Comedy Central’s list of the \"100 Greatest Standups of all Time.\" Aside from acting, he also received the \"Humanitarian of the Year Award\" for his contribution toward water conservation in the City of Fresno.\n\nJere Burns\n\nDonning the ultimate ‘bad guy’ look, Jere Burns remains one of the most memorable cast members in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,\" playing the role of Arnan Rothman. Jere has had quite an impressive career since the ending of the Dundee trilogy.\n\nHe has gone on to get some huge TV roles on his resume - working on projects like \"The Muppets,\" \"From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series,\" and the hit TV series \"Justified\" as Wynn Duffy. Jere Burns has also appeared on Broadway! His Broadway credits include \"Hairspray\" and \"After the Night and the Music.\"\n\nCharles S. Dutton\n\nCharles Dutton is well known as Leroy Brown in \"Crocodile Dundee II,\" but that is just a small piece of his long-acting resume. He has gone on to star in many well-known films and television shows. Some of his best-known works are his roles as Fortune in the film \"Rudy,\" Dillon in \"Alien 3,\" and his starring role in the TV series \"Roc,\" where he played the title character.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Charles picked up some Outstanding Guest Actor Emmy Awards for his roles in \"The Practice\" and \"Without a Trace.\" He also had a nomination in 1999 for his guest-starring role as Alvah Case in the HBO drama \"Oz,\" but he did not win. For his role in \"Oz,\" he was also nominated for an NAACP Image Award.\n\nAida Turturro\n\nHaving a bit of a role in the third and final \"Crocodile Dundee\" film did not stop Aida Turturro from racking up some serious credits on her resume. Aida Turturro landed her first film in 1989, but it did not make her a well-known personality. She remains most well known for her starring role as the sister of Tony Soprano in the HBO series, \"The Sopranos.\"\n\nAside from her role on \"The Sopranos,\" Turturro has stayed quite busy with TV work on \"Law & Order\" as Judge Felicia Catano. She has a multitude of films under her belt, such as \"True Love,\" \"What About Bob?,\" \"Jersey Girl,\" \"Illuminata,\" \"Sleepers,\" and \"Deep Blue Sea.\"\n\nStephen Root\n\nCan you believe that the amazing Stephen Root’s very first role was in \"Crocodile Dundee II?\" He portrayed a DEA Agent named Toilet, and the rest was history! Since then, Root has proved his worth as an actor, comedian, and voice actor and has landed some major roles.\n\nHe has starred as Jimmy James on the TV series \"NewsRadio,\" as Milton Waddams in the comedy \"Office Space\" in 1999, and as the voices of Bill Dauterive and Buck Strickland in the animated series \"King of the Hill.\" His resume also includes roles in the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" two-part episode \"Unification\" and in the movies \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?,\" \"DodgeBall,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" and \"Get Out.\" He also has a ton of supporting roles in a variety of HBO series.\n\nCaitlin Clarke\n\nClarke landed a minor role in \"Crocodile Dundee\" as Simone. She would then go on to land a few more gigs in her short but sweet career. Caitlin got her to start stealing the hearts of kids everywhere when she played the beautiful and fierce Valerian in the \"Dragonslayer\" film pre-Dundee back in 1981.\n\nShe was best known for her role in \"Dragonslayer\" and later for her role as Charlotte Cardoza in the Broadway musical \"Titanic\" during the years 1998–1999. Sadly, the lovely Clarke passed away from cancer at only 52 years old, well before she ever really got to show off all of her many talents.\n\nHechter Ubarry\n\nWhen Hechter Ubarry was just a kid living in New York, he discovered his acting and singing abilities. He was encouraged to study opera, and so he did with a cantor named Maurice Jampol. He gave him lessons despite Ubarry not having the funds to pay them. He always said he could pay him when he could, and luckily, he was able to!\n\nHe then utilized his skills and landed himself a role as the drug king Rico in \"Crocodile Dundee II.\" After this amazing role, he started to receive many offers and would eventually return to Broadway. Hechter still performs live on Broadway and also stars in his own cabaret show, which has been running since 2000.\n\nPeter Faiman\n\nThe man behind the camera when it all started was Peter Faiman, the director of the original \"Crocodile Dundee\" film. Though Faiman would go on to gain some serious honors in Australia, becoming a Member of the Order of Australia, he would never really get another major gig as a director.\n\nIn 1994, he assisted with the launch of the FX network in New York and was the coordinating director for the opening and closing broadcasts of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games with the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation. Since returning to Australia in 2002, he has been a consultant for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. There he has been acting as a producer on \"Strictly Ballroom,\" \"Spicks and Specks,\" and \"The Pet Show.\"\n\nPaul Hogan\n\nFor a while, it looked like Paul Hogan was destined to be a huge star in Hollywood. He scored the \"Crocodile Dundee' trilogy as his first major series of gigs, and most would have assumed that would lead to instant fame. Hogan also co-wrote the movie, which was a massive success all over the world. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for Best Actor at the BAFTAs.\n\nThe screenplay of the film was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and a Saturn Award. Hogan also co-hosted the 59th Academy Awards with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. A scandal linking him with offshore bank accounts and tax evasion would tarnish Hogan’s name, and soon after the scandal, the Australian star retired. His last role was a guest-starring part in the TV series \"Open Slather.\"\n\nLuis Guzmán\n\nMany people have no idea Luis even starred in the second \"Crocodile Dundee\" film. The Puerto Rican-born American actor is easily recognizable for his many roles since, though. Luis has played character roles such as sidekicks, thugs, and policemen for much of his career, and he does it well!\n\nGuzmán starred in the films \"Out of Sight,\" \"The Limey,\" \"Traffic,\" \"Boogie Nights,\" \"Magnolia,\" and \"Punch-Drunk Love.\" He’s also been successful on TV, starring in the HBO series \"How to Make It in America\" and the hit Netflix series \"Narcos.\" He also starred in the medical drama \"Code Black,\" where he portrayed nurse Jesse \"Mama\" Salander.\n\nClare Carey\n\nClare Carey has acted in many films, including, of course, \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\" However, that wasn’t her claim to fame. She is best known for her roles in episodic television. Most know her for her role as Kelly Fox on the sitcom \"Coach\" and her role as Macy Carlson, the Olsen twins' mother, on the ABC Family series \"So Little Time.\"\n\nShe has had recurring roles on \"Point Pleasant,\" \"Jericho\" as Mary Bailey, and \"Crash\" as Christine Emory. She also made a guest appearance in \"Eli Stone\" as a lawyer. Carey had a cameo role in the Showtime film \"La Cucina.\" She also had a part in the \"NCIS\" episode \"Life Before His Eyes\" as Ann Gibbs, opposite Mark Harmon. She later guest-starred on \"NCIS: New Orleans,\" playing villain Anne Boudreau, in the episode \"Sic Semper Tyrannis.\"\n\nMichael Lombard\n\nMichael Lombard is best known for his performances in \"Guiding Light,\" \"Pet Sematary,\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair.\" But of course, fans of \"Crocodile Dundee\" will forever know him as Sam Charlton. He received a nomination for a Drama Desk Award for his stunning performance in \"Otherwise Engaged.\" He also won an Obie Award for his performance in \"What's Wrong With This Picture?\" On TV, he played the role of Marshall Beck in all 15 episodes of \"Filthy Rich\" until 1983.\n\nHe had guest roles in a multitude of popular television shows like \"Kojak,\" \"The Mary Tyler Moore Hour,\" \"The Rockford Files,\" \"Three’s Company,\" \"Riptide,\" \"Spenser: For Hire,\" \"Miami Vice,\" \"The Cosby Show,\" and many episodes of \"Law & Order\" and all of its spinoffs. Sadly, Michael Lombard passed away in 2020, leaving behind him his legacy.\n\nJohn Snyder\n\nSnyder’s role was merely a pimp in the \"Crocodile Dundee\" film, but despite that fact, he has appeared in many TV series and films, dating from 1979 to 2004. Snyder played the role of a gas station attendant in the film \"The Warriors.\" He took on the role of Soul Hunter #2 in \"Soul Hunter\" and Orin Zento in \"By Any Means Necessary,\" episodes of \"Babylon 5,\" and as Aaron Conor in the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"The Masterpiece Society.\"\n\nHe also played the role of the Romulan Bochra in the episode \"The Enemy.\" From 1979 to 2004, he appeared in many TV series and films. Aside from his work in stage and film acting, he has also done voice work in anime and video games for studios such as Animaze, Bang Zoom Entertainment, and New Generation Pictures.\n\nAnne Francine\n\nAnne Francine is a cabaret singer and actress. She played the role of Fran in \"Crocodile Dundee.\" In addition, she played the Evil Queen in the live TV version of \"Snow White!\" Even still, most knew her due to her villainous role as Flora in \"Harper Valley PTA.\" In 1954, she made her Broadway debut with Shirley Booth in \"By the Beautiful Sea.\" She stepped in for the legendary Bea Arthur as Vera Charles in the 1966 Broadway production of \"Mame,\" starring the late Angela Lansbury.\n\nIncredibly enough, she and Lansbury reprised their roles in the 1983 Broadway revival. In 1987, she made her last appearance on Broadway as Mrs. Harcourt in the revival of \"Anything Goes,\" starring Patti LuPone. Unfortunately, Fran was her last role, as she passed away in 1999.\n\nAnne Carlisle\n\nThe actress, teacher, author, and model has starred in a handful of films and TV series. Anne Carlisle clearly wore many hats in the entertainment industry. She is best known for writing and portraying both the lead female and male roles in the film \"Liquid Sky.\" In 1985, she also played the small role of Victoria in the Susan Seidelman film \"Desperately Seeking Susan.\"\n\nShe played a memorable role as transvestite Gwendoline in \"Crocodile Dundee\" and starred in an episode of the TV series \"Miami Vice.\" Carlisle also adapted and wrote a novel version of her cult film \"Liquid Sky.\" Carlisle also posed for the famous Playboy Magazine in 1984.\n\nIrving Metzman\n\nIrving Metzman was actually born Douglas Kahn but changed his name to \"Irving Metzman,\" the name of his character in the second play he did. He had planned to change his name for each appearance to that of his character in the play before, but he didn't follow through and has continued to be known as \"Irving Metzman.\"\n\nHe is best known for his roles in \"WarGames,\" \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" and Irving the Doorman in \"Crocodile Dundee.\" Irving is also a published playwright. The play Irving wrote, entitled \"Partners,\" was published and appeared in Dramatics Magazine in its March/April 1979 issue.\n\nNancy Mette\n\nMost people probably don’t remember, but Nancy Mette played the role of Karla, a New York prostitute, in the film \"Crocodile Dundee.\" Since those days, she has maintained a very low-key Hollywood career, gaining a mere 19 acting credits. She’s had roles in projects such as \"Meet the Hollowheads\" and \"Terms of Endearment.\" She may never have become a star, but Nancy Mette had found a unique niche in movies, playing small but demanding roles.\n\nIf a director needed to fill a minor role calling for a difficult line or a quirky delivery, he could always pick up the telephone and ask whether Mette was available. Her last role was as a guest star on \"Monk.\" She has been married to Hollywood director Barnet Kellman since 1982.\n\nJuan Fernández de Alarcon\n\nJuan is a Dominican actor best known for his roles as the evil character in his movies. Fernández was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He made his film acting debut in the film Salome and since then has gone on to star in over 30 movies. He is best known for \"A Man Apart (2003),\" \"The Collector (2009),\" and \"Crocodile Dundee II (1988).\" Aside from acting in movies, Juan also worked as a model for various designers.\n\nHe has worked for numerous high-end clients, including Yves Saint-Laurent, Nino Cerruti, Zandra Rhodes, Ossie Clark, and Giorgio di Sant'Angelo. Additionally, he’s modeled for various artists, like Salvador Dalí.\n\nDennis Boutsikaris\n\nDennis Boutsikaris has won the Obie Award two times! He was also the first American actor to play Mozart on Broadway in \"Amadeus.\" It seems like \"Crocodile Dundee II\" paved the way for many incredible actors. Dennis has done over 140 recordings for Audiobooks for publishers around the world, portraying the works of authors such as Phillip Roth, Stephen King, Jeffrey Deaver, and Don Delillo. For his voice work, he won an Audie Award.\n\nHis film credits include lead roles in \"*batteries not included,\" \"The Dream Team,\" \"Crocodile Dundee II,\" \"Boys on the Side,\" and \"In Dreams,\" among many others. Most recently, he was in the films \"Cherry Crush,\" \"The Education of Charlie Banks,\" and \"Calling it Quits.\" In 2012, he co-starred in \"The Bourne Legacy,\" the fourth film of the successful \"Bourne\" franchise. He is still going strong, as last year he starred in \"Better Call Saul.\"\n\nPaul Greco\n\nPaul Greco can be best remembered as the leader of the not-so-tough gang, The Orphans, in the cult classic, \"The Warriors.\" He is fondly remembered as one of two thugs out to kill Woody Allen's title character in Broadway’s \"Danny Rose,\" and the New Yorker who does a double-take reaction to the guy from Australia, Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) in Crocodile Dundee.\n\nHe then went on to appear in numerous films and television shows throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including an episode of Miami Vice. Sadly, he passed away from lung cancer in 2008 at age 53, with just 20 credits under his belt.\n\nSerge Cockburn\n\nAustralian actor Serge Cockburn is pretty much only known for his role as Mikey Dundee in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,\" where he portrays the son of Crocodile Dundee. Serge's parents read an ad in the paper that a local production company, Bangalow Productions, was looking for a little boy to play Mick Dundee's son in \"Crocodile Dundee in L.A.\" so they made a short video of Serge talking to his Grandpa about his pet lizard, Huffy. Casting director Maura Fay was \"knocked out by his performance,\" and he scored the role.\n\nAside from his success in acting, Serge also plays soccer and loves reptiles. He has five pet snakes, a gecko, a pink-tongued skink, a blue-tongued lizard, and a dog! His only other acting role was three years after Dundee in \"Danny Deckchair.\"\n\nAlec Wilson\n\nActor and director Alec Wilson is probably best remembered for his roles in \"Crocodile Dundee II\" and \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\" Wilson played the character Denning in the second Dundee film that came out in 1988. Weirdly enough, in \"Crocodile Dundee II,\" he played one of the bad guys. But he went on to play one of Mick’s friends, Jacko, in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\"\n\nAlec Wilson, like Paul Hogan, is also a fellow Australian, which made him a great choice for the film since he already had the accent. Those accents are pretty hard to do! Since his appearances in the Dundee films, he has been in a few more movies, but after 2013, he disappeared completely from the big screen.\n\nKaitlin Hopkins\n\nKaitlin Hopkins portrayed Miss Mathis in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\" She went on to be quite the stage, screen, and television actress. Apart from film and television, Hopkins could always be found starring in plenty of theatre roles. In 1994, at the young age of 30, she was cast in the rock opera \"I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky\" by Peter Sellars.\n\nShe spent the next year on tour, traveling the world with the production, performing in Paris, Hamburg, Helsinki, and Montreal, as well as at the Edinburgh Festival, among other locales. Currently, she stepped aside from acting and is the new Head of Musical Theatre at Texas State University.\n\nKenneth Welsh\n\nKenneth Welsh has such an extensive resume that you probably don’t even remember him from Dundee. He has played many historical figures, including Colin Thatcher, Harry S. Truman (not once but twice), Thomas Edison, James \"Scotty\" Reston, General Harry Crerar, and James Baker. He has made appearances on the TV series \"Due South\" and \"Slings and Arrows.\"\n\nHe was nominated for a Best Actor Genie Award for his role as Reno Colt in the film \"Reno and the Doc.\" In 1997, he directed the play \"SoHo Duo\" at the West Bank Theatre in New York City. His role as the Vice-President of the United States in the 2004 film, \"The Day After Tomorrow,\" sparked major controversy due to his resemblance to Dick Cheney, who at the time was the actual Vice-President.\n\nMatt Winston\n\nWinston is an actor and producer who is probably less known for his role as the taxi driver in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles\" than any other credit. He is usually known for \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,\" and \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence.\" That being said, he is probably best known for his television roles.\n\nHe was on \"Six Feet Under,\" \"John from Cincinnati,\" and \"Star Trek: Enterprise.\" Along with the company of Jeffrey Combs and Gary Graham, he is one of only three actors, aside from the regulars, of course, to appear in all four seasons of \"Star Trek: Enterprise.\" He has been married to Amy Smallman since October 1998.\n\nJohn Billingsley\n\nJohn Billingsley played the role of Barry in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\" Since his Dundee days, he’s had both small and large roles in film and television. John is definitely type-cast, and he frequently plays scientific characters, such as doctors or professors.\n\nYou probably know John as Doctor Phlox from the television series \"Star Trek: Enterprise.\" In \"Stargate SG-1: The Other Guys (2002),\" he plays a scientist with a fascination for \"Star Trek\" (his character even states that he dresses up as a Vulcan at Star Trek conventions). In \"Star Trek: Enterprise (2001),\" he portrays the medical officer Dr. Phlox, whose shipmate is a Vulcan named T'Pol.\n\nNicholas Hammond\n\nLifetimes before his small stint in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles\" as a curator, Hammond portrayed the world-famous role of Friedrich von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music,\" and the iconic Peter Parker “Spider-Man” on the TV series \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" When Nicholas was only 6 years old, his family moved to Europe. In 1959, his mother took him to see the musical \"My Fair Lady\" starring Julie Andrews in London.\n\nAfter seeing this incredible piece, Nicholas decided he wanted to be an actor. His family returned to the US when Nicholas was 10 years old. It was then that he landed his first part (a small role in the movie \"Lord of the Flies\"). At a whopping six feet tall, he is the tallest actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-man. He retired from acting in 2016.\n\nKeli Daniels\n\nKeli Daniels had a rather small role in \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,\" which is why she’s best known for her work in \"American Crime Story,\" \"The Fosters,\" and \"Masters of Sex.\" Her daughter is actress Wyndoline (Wyni) Landry. Keli appeared in one episode (S.2 E.12) of the TV series \"Switched at Birth\" alongside her daughter. Keli starred in and wrote a one-woman show about her life as both a mother and actress called \"Are We There Yet?\"\n\nShe currently writes and performs all around LA on a very regular basis. She has also been teaching and coaching, both privately and in group settings, for the past 10 years. Keli has also done a number of commercials for big brands, such as Jif, Miralax, Sutter Health, and Alka Seltzer.\n\nLenny Citrano\n\nCharacter actor Lenny Citrano is certainly very well known, he has starred on so many hit TV shows. His film and stage credits, though, tend to have him playing shady characters that ultimately get what's coming to them… but not without a few laughs thrown in first.\n\nHis television credits include hit shows like “Vegas,” “Justified,” “Friends with Benefits,” “Lie to Me,” “Castle,” “ER,” “Without a Trace,” “Crossing Jordan,” “Matlock,” “NYPD Blue,” “Babylon 5,” “Columbo,” “Cheers,” “Who's the Boss?,” “Murder She Wrote,” and “Baywatch.” He has also done voice-over work for video games like Red Dead Redemption. It is pretty funny that with such a successful acting career, he also holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Ornamental Horticulture.\n\nGrant Piro\n\nPiro has starred in a bunch of roles after \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.\" He is best known as the host of a children’s TV show, \"Couch Potato,' on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He has also become one of Australia's most respected theatre actors, with performances in \"Under Milk Wood,\" \"Moby Dick,\" \"Whose Life Is It Anyway, and many more. His performance in the Melbourne Theatre Company's production of \"Realism\" got him critically recognized for his use of the acting technique known as biomechanics.\n\nHe appeared as several characters in the Rolf DeHeer film \"Bad Boy Bubby,\" worked with director Scott Hicks on his films \"Call Me Mr. Brown,\" \"Sebastian,\" and the \"Sparrow,\" and appeared in the French feature \"L'Amour En Ambuscade\" for Carl Shultz, and the films \"The Outsider,\" \"Falls,\" \"The Condemned,\" \"Darkness Save Your Legs,\" and \"Crime & Punishment.\"\n\nMaggie Blinco\n\nIn the first and second films of the \"Crocodile Dundee\" trilogy, Maggie Blinco played the character of Ida. Maggie’s up-and-coming career didn’t end after \"Crocodile Dundee II\" - thankfully for her, it continued to flourish. She went on to star in films such as \"Flirting,\" \"Cheek to Cheek,\" and \"Doctor Doctor.\"\n\nAt over 80 years old, Australian actress Maggie Blinco feels she is in a category all her own as far as roles go. She has played her fair share of dementia patients of late but is excited to be playing a politically incorrect nanna in a new comedy. More recently, Maggie appeared in a short film called \"BABA.\"\n\nPaul, Linda, & Chance\n\nDuring the days of shooting the Dundee films, the Hogans were nothing more than a picture-perfect family of three. But, of course, a lot can happen in a day, and that means so much more can happen and change over time. Sadly, this is the case for the Hogans. The divorce was very hard for all three of the family members, but especially for Chance.\n\nHogan and his first wife, Noelene Edwards, got married in 1958. They separated and then divorced in 1981 and remarried less than a year later. A second divorce in 1986 was considered one of Australia's messiest celebrity divorces. Hogan then married his \"Crocodile Dundee\" co-star Linda Kozlowski in 1990. Paul has five kids with his first wife and just one with his second. In October 2013, Kozlowski filed for divorce from Hogan, saying the pair had irreconcilable differences.\n\nTatyana Ali\n\nTatyana Ali may not look so familiar, or maybe she does, but certainly not from \"Crocodile Dundee I.\" The ever-so-lovely Tatyana Ali starred only in the second film of the trilogy, \"Crocodile Dundee II.\" She portrayed the role of “park girl.” Not so memorable.\n\nBut get ready for this! This beautiful actress and the adorable little girl from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" are the same person! The little kid we watched grow up on “Fresh Prince” is now a major Hollywood star. Today, she is working on her new album and has starred in many box-office films. She is certainly creating quite the name for herself. Bravo!\n\nGregory Jbara\n\nWhile we are talking about stars from the film \"Crocodile Dundee II,\" let's move to Gregory Jbara. This star played the part of Young Cop in the second film. He is an award-winning actor with a massive career spanning 30 years. Jbara can be spotted in some of the biggest hit TV series, like “Frasier,” “Friends,” “Law & Order,” and “Nurse Jackie.”\n\nHis biggest and probably most well-known role is as Garrett Moore in CBS’s \"Blue Bloods\" (2011-2017). Born and raised in a suburban Detroit town, he stayed a New York resident through 1997. Jbara now lives with his wife Julie and their sons Zachary and Aidan in sunny Los Angeles.\n\nSusie Essman\n\nSusie Essman was also in \"Dundee II\" as the tour guide, which does not sound too big, but it was a major role considering the film was located in South Africa. Susie has come very far since her tour guide days in Dundee. She has been touring and doing shows at clubs throughout the country for more than twenty years. She was a guest on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\" in 1989. Her first major half-hour special was put on Comedy Central in 1992.\n\nMuch of her comedy draws from her Jewish background - because of this, she has been featured in documentaries such as \"Heroes of Jewish Comedy\" and \"A History of Jewish Comedy.\" As both an actress and a writer, Susie has become very well-known for her roles in “Bolt,” HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” and “Keeping the Faith.”\n\nGus Mercurio\n\nGus wore many hats. He was well-known as a character actor and as a former pro boxer. Gus Mercurio had also served in the United States Marine Corps and was a chiropractor! Mercurio was an international boxing judge, where he was even seen refereeing a world title fight, and was a well-known boxing promoter. He became the president of the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame – where he was inducted in 2008.\n\nAs an actor, Gus was known for playing the role of Frank in \"Dundee II.\" Thanks to the actor’s unique and raspy voice, wild personality, and natural talents, he was quickly recognized by TV production houses in Australia. Gus, of course, was not a stranger to the camera, appearing in several TV shows as well as hit films like \"Crocodile Dundee II.\" Sadly, Gus passed away in December of 2010.\n\nCarlos Carrasco\n\nCarlos will always be remembered as Garcia from the second \"Crocodile Dundee\" film. Carlos is also doing very well in Hollywood, well enough to be cast in some of the biggest box-office films, like \"Star Wars\" and \"Jurassic Park.\" Carlos spends his time being heavily involved in the Latino/Hispanic community in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nCultivating a career in arts administration, Carrasco has been the Executive Director of the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors in New York, a panelist for the New York State Council on the Arts, and also a co-director of the JACK Arts Ensemble, based in Los Angeles.

In the television movie \"Sinbad and the Minotaur,\" he played the role of Al-Jibar. Steven Grives lives in Australia with his wife and five children.\n\nLinda Kozlowski\n\nHow could we forget Linda Kozlowski and her role in Dundee as the beautiful Sue Charlton? Kozlowski and her co-star Paul Hogan had such amazing chemistry on set that they would end up becoming a romantic item, which led to Hogan divorcing his wife for this new relationship. The two would end up married for over 10 years and have one child together before calling their relationship quits.\n\nSince that time, she has appeared in \"Almost an Angel\" in 1990, \"Backstreet Justice\" (with Paul Sorvino), \"The Neighbor\" (with Rod Steiger) in 1994, and \"Village of the Damned\" in 1995.
