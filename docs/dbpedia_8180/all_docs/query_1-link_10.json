        "text": "The LGBTQ Institute's Jim Allen's papers, 1956-2016 (bulk 1989-1993) consist of documents surrounding his work as an AIDS Activist in Atlanta with the group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), from the late 1980s to late 1990s, with the motto \"Silence = Death\". Much of the gay community was trying to understand and fight the AIDS epidemic. The papers consist of flyers, fact sheets, correspondence, articles, surveys, questionnaires and a variety of ephemera from the many demonstrations and activist activities he was championing.\n\nGeorgia State University is the owner of the physical collection and makes reproductions available for research, subject to the copyright law of the United States and item condition. Georgia State University may or may not own the rights to materials in the collection. It is the researcher's responsibility to verify copyright ownership and obtain permission from the copyright holder before publication, reproduction, or display of the materials beyond what is reasonable under copyright law. Researchers may quote selections from the collection under the fair use provision of copyright law.\n\nJames E. Allen (born 1954) was raised in Winter Park, Florida, within an Irish Catholic family of 11 brothers and sisters. He has always liked the rare and unusual and has a passion for Civil Rights memorabilia. He became a \"picker\" of antiques, some of which are now housed at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. He amassed a major collection of lynching photographs and postcards and photographs in his antique business. In 2000, Allen published Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America (with contributions by Representative John Lewis, Leon Litwack, and Hilton Als) from his collection. The following year he placed the photos on exhibit in New York to help draw worldwide attention to America's history of racial violence. When the National Center for Civil and Human Rights opened in 2014, it displayed the exhibit as part of its permanent collection.\n\nDuring the AIDS crisis in the mid to late 1980s he became an Atlanta activist with the group \"AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power\" (ACT UP). ACT Up was a diverse, non-partisan group united in frustration and committed to ending the AIDS crisis through protest and other forms of civil disobedience."
