        "text": "BOOK REVIEW: Piranesi\n\nTITLE: Piranesi\n\nAUTHOR: Susanna Clarke\n\nPUBLISHER: Bloomsbury Publishing\n\nDATE: 2021\n\nI don’t know how to write about this book. In these reviews I usually talk about plot, characters, tropes, world-building, what I thought the author did well, what I thought they failed to accomplish. But Piranesi is such a strange, haunting piece of work. There’s a plot and characters, sure, but most of what makes it so unforgettable is atmosphere, implication, description. The actual events of the book could be summed up in just a few sentences, but that would miss everything great about it–like reading the lyrics of a song without the melody. I don’t know how to talk about this book, but I liked it so much that I really want to try. I’m going to try and avoid spoiling too much, but if you haven’t read it yet, you might want to skip this post, because it’s a book that really really rewards going in totally blind.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nPiranesi lives in the House, which is also the World. The House goes on–so far as he can tell–forever, an endless labyrinth of halls, vestibules, and staircases, distinguished only by the forests of statues displayed in every one. There is an ocean in the lower levels, and tides wash through, and rain falls from the upper floors. Piranesi has always lived here, and has always spent his days studying and cataloging the House with his friend, the Other. They are–as far as he can tell–the only people who exist. The Other wishes to find the Great and Secret Knowledge concealed somewhere within, but Piranesi cares more about studying his World than anything else. It is a strange, hermetic existence, but a happy one, for “the Beauty of House is immeasurable, its Kindness infinite.” (Piranesi, pg. 4). And then one day, everything begins to change.\n\nWHAT I LIKED:\n\nAlmost the entirety of Piranesi takes place within the House, a universe that works differently from ours, and so much the spell of this book comes from the way in takes you inside it. Piranesi (the character) is not an outsider to this world, he is one of its sole inhabitants, and its foremost expert. Much of the text is his investigations and explorations of the House, and his attempts to catalogue its mysteries, and to understand them. But he approaches it from a totally different perspective than we would, an acceptance of the fundamental rightness of this world, an assumption that this is how the universe should work. It’s this fascinating mixture of scientific exactitude (cataloging statues, making fishing nets from dried seaweed, counting hallways and corridors, calculating the tides) and incomprehensible mystery–reading the future in the flight of birds between the rafters, bringing offerings to water lilies to the skeletons that he has found hidden away in various nooks and crannies. Piranesi never seems to wonder where he came from, or how he knows how to read and write, or why he instinctively knows what the different statues represent, and Clarke pulls us seamlessly into this worldview, this totally alien way of seeing.\n\nPiranesi is an epistolary novel, which is to say that the entirety of the book consists of journal entries from the protagonist, recounting events. In some ways, I think this is inevitable, given how few characters there are in the book. By necessity, we spend most of our time inside Piranesi’s mind, engaged with his reflections and commentary on the World around him. But the journalistic style also helps engross us fully in this alien worldview. We’re never getting an “objective” view of the events that occur, we’re getting his recollections and interpretations of them, colored by his unique understanding, and oblique way of thinking. We get his transcriptions of conversations, interspersed with catalogues of “Every Person Known to Have Existed”, and when he starts delving into journal entries from other perspectives, the dissonance is sharp and inescapable.\n\nOne of the major inspirations for this book, according to Clarke, is the Jorge Luis Borges story “The Library of Babel“. Written as the last testament of a dying Librarian, “The Library of Babel” tells us of a universe that consists of nothing but endless chambers, filled with books, containing every single combination of letters possible. This means, of course, that the Library contains the total sum of all human knowledge. It also means, that it contains untold multitudes of gibberish and nonsense, and that anything of actual use is but a tiny, infinitesimal fraction of books, buried in an infinite ocean. Librarians spend their whole lives searching, and find only a few legible sentences, at best, though they dream and hope of secret catalogues and indexes that might reveal the Truth. The conceits are very similar, but in “The Library of Babel” the infinitude of the universe is a depressive, stultifying force, driving the Librarians to despair and insanity at the paradox of their world. In Piranesi, he finds joy and fulfillment in the endless mysteries. He knows he will never understand all of the House, or discover its “purpose”, but he loves it for its beauty anyways.\n\nIt is interesting now many works there appear to be in this genre of “stories about houses that contain an entire universe.” We mentioned “The Library of Babel” above, but there’s also Hayao Miyazaki’s 2023 film The Boy and the Heron, Garth Nix’s The Keys to the Kingdom series, and Genevieve Cogman’s Invisible Library books. There is something very appealing, or enticing, about that idea, of the reversal of the fundamental divide between Outside and Inside, between Order and Chaos, between the House and the Wild.\n\nPiranesi is, essentially, a mystery, in which we slowly learn the truth of our protagonist’s identity, and how he came to be where he is, and what this place that he lives in is. But if it’s a mystery, it’s one that Piranesi never knows he’s solving. Throughout the story, clues are slowly discovered, but in many cases, Piranesi does not have the context to understand what they are, or to comprehend the implications. We, the reader, see the connections that he doesn’t, and can glimpse the lies and paradoxes surrounding him long before he begins to. It’s a mystery that never knows that it’s a mystery, told from an oblique and ignorant perspective, and that makes it all the more interesting.\n\nI can only describe Piranesi as a “minimalist” book. There are only four real characters, and almost no actual events occur in the plot. It’s a book that consists in great part of atmosphere, description, and internal monologue. And yet, it also manages to contain, in its margins, the outline of a very different story, a rich, tortured drama about the unraveling of a 1970s Neo-Pagan cult, and the terrible secrets they found, and the horrible deeds they committed. We only ever catch glimpses of this, journal entries and interviews and third-hand accounts of memories of events that occurred long ago, but Clarke manages to make it feel like you’re on the edge of something deep and complex and terrifying, without ever letting you quite look at it in the eye.\n\nThis is getting into SPOILER territory, so you might want to skip this, but one of the major plot threads, early on, is the search for the Great and Secret Knowledge, a kind of power that the Other believes is hidden somewhere within the House. This is described as having aspects and permutations–the ability to live forever, to turn into birds and fly, to feel the turning of the stars within your mind, to control lesser minds, etc. In short, it is magic, but more than, it is a different mode of observing and relating to the world. “When they observed the world, the world observed them back. If, for example, they traveled in a boat on a river, then the river was in some way aware of carrying them on its back and had in fact agreed to it. When they looked up to the stars, the constellations were not simply patterns enabling them to organize what they saw, they were vehicles of meaning, a never-ending flow of information. The world was constantly speaking to Ancient Man.” (Piranesi, pg. 147). Like so much of this book, “magic” here isn’t about learning rote rituals and spells, or solving a puzzle, it’s about learning to understand the World in an alien way, to bend your perception in a direction you’re not used to.\n\nThe other thing about the Great and Secret Knowledge (SPOILER) is that it turns out to not be very important. Oh, presumably, if you could somehow recapture it, you’d gain all the abilities that Ancient Man once had, but it’s gone, departed, slipped away through the cracks in the Universe. The Other seeks desperately to track it down, to discover where it’s hiding, but in this, he fails to understand the World. “But [the Other] is an egoist. He always thinks in terms of utility. He cannot imagine why anything should exist if he cannot make use of it.” (Piranesi, pg. 89). Earlier in the book, we spend time studying rituals, planning a mystical journey, trying to discover how to unlock the secrets of the House. But it all turns out to be incidental, a distraction from what’s really important.\n\nThe problem with this sort of book, usually, is that the mystery is more interesting than the solution. The sense of awe and dread inspired by your lack of knowledge is more fun than whatever answer the author comes up with. But, of course, refusing to answer anything is just as frustrating. I think Clarke handles with really well though, giving us enough of a solution to satisfy, without ever letting us feel like we truly understand the House. We learn many things about it, where it came from, its relationship to our world, who Piranesi is, why he is there, but it remains fundamentally incomprehensible. And on a thematic and emotional level, these answers do not solve any of our protagonists’ problems. Learning the truth does not necessarily make Piranesi happy, and the book ends on a deeply ambiguous note, with a haunting sense of melancholy. You move forward, you learn new things, and you try and assimilate them into your sense of being, your sense of self, but maybe you’d be happier just spending your days fishing and cataloging statues. But whatever happens, you learn to appreciate and love it for what it is.\n\nWHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:\n\nMy only real complaint is that I wish it were longer, because I just wanted to spend more time exploring this universe.\n\nWILL YOU LIKE IT:\n\nDo you like fantasy? Do you like the sense of being transported to another world, or forced to view the universe through an alien lens? Do you like slightly terrifying mysteries with deeply disturbing implications that are, nevertheless, deeply beautiful? If so, you should read this book. Piranesi is a powerfully strange novel, one that uses a light touch and a deft hand to paint a deeply evocative picture that cannot help but draw you in. It’s one of the best books I’ve read in a long time, and I can’t stop thinking about it. I hope that you won’t be able to either.\n\nThen may your Paths be safe, your Floors unbroken, and may the House fill your eyes with Beauty\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
