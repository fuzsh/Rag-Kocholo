        "text": "III. Places\n\nIII. Places\n\nOver the centuries, artists have stirred interest in places familiar and unknown. Even if we have not visited them, famous places—Rome, Venice, Paris—have become immediately recognizable as a result of print reproductions. Similarly, prints express the lesser known: What do the lochs of Scotland look like? The French countryside? The ever-changing American city? Prints also deepen our connection to places with personal or sentimental attachments. And they evoke moods or emotions, in addition to providing visual information. Moreover, some prints portray places that exist only in the imagination.\n\nThe May Collection is especially rich in prints of places that attempt to express ideals of life, civilization, and beauty. The definition of what constitutes a “place” and how it should be portrayed is fluid, allowing artists across time, styles, and nationalities to offer distinctive interpretations of the genre.\n\nClaude Lorrain (1604-1682)\n\nFrench Landscape (1645)\n\nEtching\n\n8 7/16 × 10 13/16 (21.4 × 27.5 cm)\n\nCollection of Jack May\n\nOften celebrated as one of the greatest idealizing landscape painters of all time, Claude Lorrain also produced some forty-four landscape etchings. In order to appeal to the tastes of the Baroque era, Claude frequently included small scenes from the Bible or classical culture in his compositions. French Landscape exemplifies his fondness for the peaceful, pastoral world of shepherds and their flocks. In this etching, two peasants, a man and a woman, converse about the world around them, while their cows and goats amble out of a luxuriant forest toward a tranquil lake. The figures in dialogue evoke the utopia of Vergil’s Bucolics, poems in which shepherds reflect on philosophy, politics, art, and love. A quiet harmony between people and animals resonates through the landscape—perhaps expressing a longing for the unending beauty of nature. And yet, a bridge and roadway in the distance may indicate a connection to the more turbulent world of the city and court beyond.\n\nLorrain’s etching may echo the biblical Garden of Eden, wherein Adam and Eve live in perfect harmony with nature. Possibly, the woman’s gesture, pointing at the bridge that may lead to the real, corrupted world, could be a subtle nod to Eve’s decision to eat the forbidden fruit and convince Adam to do so also, expelling them from utopia.\n\nPeter Stidman\n\nLaw, History, & Society\n\nClass of 2023\n\nImmersion Project\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nMannocci, Lino.

He includes staffage figures to establish the scale and the looming weight of the structure, while the stark chiaroscuro creates an ominous atmosphere. Piranesi’s reliance on both actual architectural principles and pure fantasy evokes a dreamlike suggestion of the great ruins of Roman architecture—the Carceri d’Invenzione are both technical and psychological marvels.\n\nSarah Treadway\n\nMedicine, Health, and Society and Child Development\n\nClass of 2021\n\nImmersion Project\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nMarchesano, Louis. “Invenzioni Capric Di Carceri: The Prisons of Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778).” Getty Research Journal 2 (2010): 151–160\n\nRobison, Andrew.

In addition to realistic cityscapes (called “vedute”), Canaletto developed a special subgenre called “capriccios,” compositions that blended buildings from actual Italian cities with imaginary architecture and settings. His prowess for depicting fantastical landscapes likely stems from his early training as a designer for theater sets.\n\nThe Market at Dolo, a fanciful depiction of a Venetian village on the mainland, is one of his later capriccios. It exemplifies his theatrical yet realistic style, with tradespeople working in the foreground of the Venetian lagoon, against a backdrop of stately buildings and a majestic mountain. Even in the absence of coloring, Canaletto demonstrates his prowess with handling light. He illuminates the workers and the building nearest the viewer, while obscuring a distant façade and the lower portion of the mountain, precisely fixing the sun’s position, while its rays are felt in every corner of the image.\n\nPeter Stidman\n\nLaw, History, & Society\n\nClass of 2023\n\nImmersion Project\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nBaetjer, Katharine, et al.

Tourist travel boomed in the nineteenth century as the romantic notion of sightseeing captured the popular imagination and families set out on pilgrimages to see the beauty of the Japanese landscape. The government set up fifty-three stations along the scenic Tōkaidō as stopping points for travelers to rest, marking the road with clusters of inns, restaurants, shrines, and shops.\n\nHiroshige’s Fifty-Three Stations of the Tōkaidō combines the beauty of the natural landscape, the romantic myth of travel and exploration, and realistic images of everyday life and work into a collection of souvenir prints. Driving Rain at Shōno, which could be collected at the forty-fifth stop along the route, captures a moment of frantic panic. Confusion abounds as figures wearing bamboo raincoats scramble to find shelter from the pouring rain. In this tour de force of the woodcut medium, Hiroshige creates an atmospheric setting by layering washes of diagonal rain against receding thickets of bamboo, illustrating each successive layer with less detail to construct a sense of mist and depth.\n\nCainie Brown\n\nAnthropology and History of Art\n\nClass of 2022\n\nImmersion Project\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nCalza, Gian Carlo.

Although the Putney Bridge may no longer be functional in the etching (it was demolished within months of this composition), Whistler celebrates its inherent beauty and delicacy, transforming it into a serene, natural landscape on the edge of London. With this image of the elegant fragility of an obsolete bridge, Whistler may be demonstrating the ideal of art for the sake of art (l’art pour l’art), although it may be a sentimental look at the passage of time and the decay of all things human-made. Either way, Putney Bridge challenges our expectation that functionality and utility are defining characteristics of an urban landscape.\n\nPeter Stidman\n\nLaw, History, & Society\n\nClass of 2023\n\nImmersion Project\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nLochnan, Katharine.

Jack May’s father, Dan, knew a deal when he saw it and, foreshadowing his son’s collecting passion, subscribed.\n\nOne of the six prints is Marin’s Downtown, the El, a dynamic image of New York City’s elevated train line. The bold diagonals and fractured planar forms convey the hustle and bustle of a city in motion. In the background, the soaring Woolworth Building, the tallest structure in the world at the time, accentuates the skyline’s explosive upward growth. Not only does Marin represent the complex metropolitan ecosystem of pedestrians, transportation, and skyscrapers, but his quick sketch-like style also captures the excitement of the distinctively American cityscape emerging in the modern world.\n\nAlthough most subscribers received a copy of Downton, the El, Marin’s art promoter Alfred Stieglitz initially suggested that The New Republic use a different print titled Brooklyn Bridge, No. 6 (1913). Several inches larger than the rest of the works in the set, only a few prints were made from this initial plate before the magazine switched to the smaller Downton, the El. Fewer than fifty initial subscribers received signed copies of the larger print.\n\nCainie Brown\n\nAnthropology and History of Art\n\nClass of 2022\n\nImmersion Project & HART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nFine, Ruth E.

As exemplified by Night Shadows, his prints often transform realistic New York City scenes into edgy dramas that evoke the cinematic style of film noir. By contrasting heavily etched intaglio line against the stark white paper, he vividly portrays the movement of a lone figure, traversing a gloomy cityscape. The unusual composition heightens its suggestions of alienation by imposing a physical and emotional distance between us, the voyeuristic viewers, looking from an undefined perch above, and the solitary man walking below. Intentional sensory imagery makes hollow footsteps sound eerily on the sidewalk as we spy on him. With its artificial light and shadow, Night Shadows captures the psychological unease of the rapidly modernizing city.\n\nNight Shadows was also in the portfolio of six prints from The New Republic magazine promotion.\n\nSophia Moak\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nClass of 2020\n\nHART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nLevin, Gail.

He trained in Indianapolis, Chicago, Boston, and Paris, and studied mural painting under Diego Rivera. Active during the Great Depression, Woodruff had a successful teaching career as professor of art at Atlanta University and New York University. Bold, curvilinear expressiveness, as evident in this linocut, remained a salient element of his style throughout his career.\n\nCreated during his Atlanta period (1931-1946), Relics presents a triste image of a dilapidated barn and a gaunt donkey, a synecdoche for the plight of the South during the Great Depression. Woodruff focused on the socio-economic impact on Black southerners, saying that he was “expressing the South as a field, as a territory, its peculiar run-down landscape, its social and economic problems of the Negro people.” This print may have Christian undertones, evoking a manger scene, thus alluding to the humble origins of a messiah and the promise of a brighter future.\n\nThis is the first acquisition made with the Jack May History of Prints Fund, established by his family at Vanderbilt University in 2019, on the occasion of May’s 90th birthday.\n\nChloe Davis\n\nHistory of Art and Anthropology\n\nClass of 2020\n\nHART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\n“Woodruff, Hale.” Grove Dictionary of Art.

Thomas Hart Benton, a leader of the American Scene, contended that subject matter rather than style defined a work of art. Benton casts the artist as a visual social historian.\n\nHomestead, a lithographic version of a 1934 mural, depicts a modest farm during the Depression and emphasizes the discontinuity between the romantic ideal of the American farm and the grim realities of the era. Despite his rejection of abstract art, Benton was influenced by Synchronism, an early twentieth-century movement that associated visual art and music. This is evident in the sinuous forms and rhythmic lines of this composition.\n\nBenton’s final project was The Sources of Country Music, a mural for Nashville’s Country Music Hall of Fame left unfinished at the time of his death.\n\nChloe Davis\n\nHistory of Art and Anthropology\n\nClass of 2020\n\nHART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nFath, Creekmore West.

At the height of a successful international career, he was appointed the first professor of graphic art at the Bauhaus, the most influential school for modern design.\n\nOff the Coast (Vor der Küste), inked near the end of the artist’s life, synthesizes Feininger’s various modernist influences. The print combines Cubism’s angular forms with the emotionality of German Expressionism, while the medium itself draws upon the Bauhaus’s promotion of mass production. Starting in the 1920s, the Nazi Party condemned these movements for their supposed Jewish, Communist, or otherwise “un-German” elements. Several of Feininger’s works were featured in the infamous 1937 exhibition of Degenerate Art (“entartete Kunst”) as examples of art that subverted Nazi ideals of beauty. Later that year, Feininger fled Nazi Germany for America.\n\nUsing harsh lines and discordant shading, the artist undermines the clichéd idyll of a sailboat on water. Though the print captures the beauty of the Baltic seascape, it also recognizes the stormy conditions of German political and social life.\n\nCainie Brown\n\nAnthropology and History of Art\n\nClass of 2022\n\nImmersion Project & HART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nLuckhardt, Ulrich.

Escher presents an imaginary space composed of thought and theory. At first glance, the depiction of water cascading from a raised platform seems fairly straightforward. Further scrutiny, however, reveals the perplexing detail that the water is flowing upwards from the base of the falls in defiance of gravity. Employing “impossible tribars,” a type of “impossible object” described by mathematician Roger Penrose and psychiatrist Lionel Penrose, Escher aligns his canals at paradoxical angles. The viewer is left with the futile struggle to reconcile the overlaid points of view, while a sense of the unnatural is further accentuated by the large polyhedrons placed atop the impossible structure. Moreover, the artist playfully alludes to elements of the real world: the miller needs to add the occasional bucket of water to offset evaporation and quaint old-fashion structures surround the mill, clashing with the initial impressions of unfamiliarity.\n\nIn addition to his artistic appeal, Escher is a fan favorite of mathematicians and scientists. While posters of his works are a staple in math classrooms, his designs have been used as the framework for complex or seemingly paradoxical scientific phenomena including transition metal atomic behavior, topology optimization, and group rationality.\n\nCainie Brown\n\nAnthropology and History of Art\n\nClass of 2022\n\nImmersion Project & HART 2775: History of Prints\n\nRecommended Sources\n\nLocher, J.
