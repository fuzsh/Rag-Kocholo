        "text": "A beautifully rendered book that is the most important study of Piranesi’s drawings to appear in more than a generation.\n\nIn a letter written near the end of his life, Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–78) explained that he left his native Venice because no patrons were willing to support “the sublimity of [his] ideas.” Residing in Rome, he became internationally famous as a printmaker and designer, among other numerous pursuits. While Piranesi’s notoriety stems from his etchings, he was also an accomplished draftsman who first developed much of his work in drawings."
