        "text": "Giovanni Battista Piranesi's De Romanorum magnificentia (in Italian, Della Magnificenza Ed Architettura De' Romani; in English, On the Magnificence and the Architecture of the Romans) was a contribution to the debate as to whether Greek art and architecture is superior to that of Rome. In the 1750s, intellectual circles were increasingly in favor of Greece. Piranesi had completed Le Antichità Romane in 1756-1757 and when Julien-David Le Roy published Les ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Grece (Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece) in 1758, Piranesi responded with Della Magnificenza. In Della Magnificenza, Piranesi argues in favor of Roman architectural ornament by drawing comparisons with specific examples from Le Roy's text. This is why many of the plates in this volume contain visual and textual references to Le Roy.\n\nPiranesi advanced the view, shared by other scholars, that the Romans had learned not from the Greeks—as British and French scholars had begun to argue—but from the earlier inhabitants of Italy, the Etruscans. Piranesi used his knowledge of ancient engineering accomplishments to defend the creative genius of the Romans, but devoted even more space to a celebration of the richness and variety of Roman ornament.\n\nSource: https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pira/hd_pira.htm\n\nThere's a downloadable edition from the University of Heidelberg in Germany."
