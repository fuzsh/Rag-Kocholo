Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) was an Italian artist and architect who is best known for his engravings of Rome and its ruins. Born in Venice, Piranesi studied architecture and set design before becoming a prolific printmaker. His etchings of Rome's ancient architecture and ruins are highly detailed and dramatic, often featuring exaggerated perspectives and dramatic lighting to create a sense of grandeur and awe. Piranesi's work was highly influential in the development of the Romantic movement, and he is considered one of the greatest printmakers of all time. In addition to his printmaking work, Piranesi also designed and built several important buildings in Rome, including the Church of Santa Maria del Priorato and the Villa Adriana.
