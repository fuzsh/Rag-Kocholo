        "text": "Methods\n\nDesign and participants\n\nThis survey is nested in the French CONSTANCES population-based cohort8 which includes approximately 200,000 adults aged 18 to 69 at inception. Since 2012, participants have been selected from the French adult population affiliated with the National Fund for Health Insurance according to a random sampling scheme stratified for age, gender, socioeconomic status and region of France to be representative of the source population, and have been followed by repeated yearly questionnaires and linked by administrative databases. CONSTANCES is also one of the three adult cohorts that is involved in the SAPRIS-SERO (\"Santé, Pratiques, Relations et Inégalités Sociales en population générale pendant la crise COVID-19\" - Serology) survey, whose aim is to quantify the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the French population using the dried blood spot (DBS) test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.9 In this specific COVID-19 survey, 66,848 CONSTANCES participants being followed-up by internet were asked to complete two self-administered e-questionnaires between April 6, 2020, and June 15, 2020. Variables included socio-demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 diagnosis, and a detailed collection of 12 acute symptoms present in the participants during the 15 days before each questionnaire. These two questionnaires were used to classify participants according to whether or not they experienced a COVID-19-like illness during the first wave of the epidemic, but also to evaluate the number of acute symptoms experienced during the initial episode. Between May 4, 2020, and November 30, 2020, DBS was also collected. Then, between December 2020 and February 2021, a third follow-up internet questionnaire including questions on clinical symptoms was completed by the participants. Overall, 35,852 participants completed the first 2 questionnaires, had a serology performed and were eligible for this survey on persistent symptoms.\n\nEthical approval and written or electronic informed consent were obtained from each participant before enrolment in the original cohort. The SAPRIS-SERO study was approved by the Sud-Mediterranée III ethics committee (approval #20.04.22.74247) and electronic informed consent was obtained from all participants for DBS testing.\n\nClassification of participants\n\nParticipants were considered “Sero+” or “Sero-” if the serological test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-like illness during the first pandemic wave was defined according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) case definition. Participants were considered “ECDC+” if they reported at least one of the following symptoms that lasted at least 3 days: dysgeusia/anosmia, dyspnea, fever, and cough in at least one of the two first questionnaires.10 Other acute symptoms included headache, unusual asthenia, myalgia, joint pain, runny nose, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea and skin problems.\n\nThe seropositive and seronegative status was defined by IgG results against the spike protein of the virus (i.e., optical density ratio ≥1.1 and <0.7, respectively) using the (Euroimmun®, Lübeck, Germany) test.9 In case of indeterminate results (i.e., optical density ratio ≥0.7 and <1.1), an in-house microneutralization assay to detect neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was performed. Participants with neutralizing antibody titers ≥40 were also considered to be seropositive. Most seropositive participants were assumed to have been infected during the first wave of the pandemic, between February 2020 and May 2020.\n\nWe selected all seropositive and seronegative participants who completed the follow-up questionnaire excluding participants who reported a diagnosis of COVID-19 after the serological test. There were 4 groups of participants: the ECDC+/Sero+ group defined by ECDC symptoms and seropositivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; the ECDC+/Sero- group defined by ECDC symptoms and seronegativity; the ECDC-/Sero+ group defined by the absence of ECDC symptoms, seropositivity and no history of COVID-19 reported on the third questionnaire; and the ECDC-/Sero- goup defined by the absence of ECDC symptoms, seronegativity and no history of COVID-19 reported on the third questionnaire (see supplementary appendix p 1).\n\nPersistent symptoms\n\nTo identify persistent symptoms, we used symptoms reported in the third questionnaire. The list of symptoms was based on symptoms described in the literature on “post-covid-19 syndrome” and “long-covid”.6 It explored dysgeusia/anosmia, cardiothoracic symptoms (cough, thoracic pain, palpitations), pains (backpain, arthralgia, myalgia, headache), digestive disorders (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain), and others symptoms that were frequently associated with long-covid (asthenia, fever, cognitive complaints, cranial nerves abnormalities, sensory disorders, talk abnormalities, auditory disorders, dizziness, sleep disorders, skin disorders).\n\nPersistent symptoms were defined as those that began after March 2020, lasted at least two months, and were still present at the time of the third questionnaire.\n\nData analysis\n\nBecause our goal was to compare persistent symptoms according to infection assessed by SARS-CoV-2 serological status and to highlight the specific association with past infection in patients with a history of acute symptoms during the first pandemic wave, the risk of presenting each persistent symptom was compared between Sero+ and Sero- groups, and between ECDC+/Sero+ and ECDC+/Sero- groups. Comparisons involving ECDC-/Sero+ and ECDC-/Sero- are presented in the supplementary appendix (ECDC-/Sero+ VS ECDC-/Sero-; ECDC+/Sero+ VS ECDC-/Sero-). Groups were compared using t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for qualitative variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to estimate the strength of association (odds-ratio (OR)) between each persistent symptoms (the dependent variable) and the group (independent variable). Multivariable OR estimates were adjusted for sex, age, educational level, comorbidities lasting more than 6 months and the number of symptoms reported during the first wave of the pandemic (aOR). Indeed, persistent symptoms seem to be epidemiologically associated with the number of acute symptoms in hospitalized patients and in outpatients with COVID-19.11,12 All tests were two-sided and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nWe also used longitudinal data for the 10 symptoms that were collected in all questionnaires to compare the persistence of each of these symptoms between Sero- and Sero+ participants.\n\nWe finally conducted a mediation analysis for all persistent symptoms associated with the serological status in univariable analysis. In this analysis, we assumed that a part of the association of the serological status on persistent symptoms was mediated by the acute symptoms caused by the infection; in other words, the acute symptoms are supposed to be in the causal pathway between the infection and the persistent symptoms and cannot be considered as a confounding factor ( ).\n\nMediation analysis has been widely used in social and medical sciences.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 It relies on a set of regression equations to model the relationships between the dependent variable, the mediator and the independent variable, while allowing adjustments for confounding factors.\n\nWe analyzed the association of past infection (defined by the SARS-CoV-2 serology result) on persistent symptoms, mediated by the initial clinical presentation, defined by ECDC status. The “effect” of past infection status can thus be direct, not passing through the initial symptoms, or indirect, passing through the initial clinical presentation.\n\nWe estimated the direct and indirect effect by calculating the following parameters: 16,17\n\n-\n\nThe natural direct effect (NDE), defined as the effect of a positive serology versus a negative serology on the probability of persistent symptoms when the ECDC status is negative. The NDE includes an interaction effect of serology with ECDC status which is not mediated;\n\n-\n\nThe natural indirect effect (NIE), defined as the effect of ECDC positive versus ECDC negative on the probability of persistent symptoms when the serological status is positive. The NIE includes an interaction effect of serology with ECDC status which is mediated;\n\n-\n\nThe total effect (TE) defined as the overall effect of serology on persistent symptoms, which is the product of NDE and NIE, when they are calculated as adjusted OR (aORTE=aORNDEx aORNIE).\n\n-\n\nThe proportion of the total effect that was mediated using the formula on the risk difference scale, (100xaORNDE x(aORNIE -1)/(aORTE -1))\n\n-\n\nThe proportion of the effect due to interaction (see ).\n\nFor each persistent symptom, the estimation of direct and indirect effects was based on two logistic models. A first logistic model predicted the probability of persistent symptom according to serological status, ECDC status, an interaction term between these two covariates, and the confounding factors. The second model predicted the probability of ECDC status according to serological status and the confounding factors. Direct and indirect aOR estimates were deduced from these two logistic models (formulas can be found in Ref 16.). All the mediation models were adjusted on age, sex, and comorbidities. Confidence intervals for estimates were calculated using bootstrap with 10 000 replicates.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software 4.0.5. Mediation analysis was performed using the CAUSALMED procedure in SAS 9.4.\n\nRole of the funding source\n\nThe sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nResults\n\nOverall, 29,438 of 35,852 (82%) eligible participants completed the follow-up questionnaire. After excluding those whose serology was indeterminate or who reported a diagnosis of COVID-19 after serology, 25,910 (72%) participants were classified into one of the four groups of interest (see supplementary appendix p 1).\n\nParticipant characteristics according to the presence of at least one persistent symptom reported through the follow-up questionnaire are summarized in . All variables were statistically different between the groups declaring no persistent symptom and the group declaring at least one persistent symptom. However, the most important difference was in the number of acute symptoms presented during the acute phase of the epidemic (70.1 and 50.2% declared no acute symptoms in the group having no persistent symptoms and in the group having at least one persistent symptom, respectively). The median time between completion of the first questionnaire and the third follow-up questionnaire was 242 days [IQR:238–251]. Overall, 4028 (15.5%) participants experienced COVID-19-like illness during the first wave and 1022 (3.9%) participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Overall, 6643 (25.6%) reported having at least one persistent symptom in the follow-up questionnaire (in those participants, the median number (IQR) of persistent symptoms was 1 (1-2)).\n\nTable 1\n\nAll participantsAt least one persistent symptom lasting more than 2 months - 12/2020-02/2021NoYespN = 25910N = 19267N = 6643Mean age (SD)49.5 (12.9)48.9 (13.0)51.1 (12.2)<0.0001Sex (female)13299 (51.3%)9509 (49.4%)3790 (57.1%)<0.0001Educational level<0.0001Other294 (1.13%)222 (1.2%)72 (1.1%)Under high school diploma7027 (27.1%)5109 (26.5%)1918 (28.9%)Under graduate degree9948 (38.4%)7326 (38.0%)2622 (39.5%)Post graduate degree8641 (33.4%)6610 (34.3%)2031 (30.6%)At least one Comorbidity⁎⁎6989 (27.2%)4541 (23.7%)2448 (37.3%)<0.0001Groups<0.0001ECDC-/Sero-21354 (82.4%)16393 (85.1%)4961 (74.7%)ECDC-/Sero+528 (2.0%)423 (2.2%)105 (1.6%)ECDC+/Sero-3534 (13.6%)2170 (11.3%)1364 (20.5%)ECDC+/Sero+494 (1.9%)281 (1.5%)213 (3.2%)Number of acute symptoms⁎⁎⁎<0.0001016054 (65.0%)12919 (70.1%)3135 (50.2%)15085 (20.6%)3484 (18.9%)1601 (25.7%)21926 (7.8%)1206 (6.5%)720 (11.5%)3753 (3.1%)427 (2.3%)326 (5.2%)4 or more863 (3.50%)405 (2.2%)458 (7.3%)\n\nThe association between SARS-CoV-2 serological status and each persistent symptom is presented in .

All aOR for NIE were > 1, meaning that the experience of ECDC symptoms was associated with persistent symptoms in those with positive serology. The effect of positive serology on each symptom was mainly mediated by ECDC symptoms (proportion mediated range 50–107%) with a high proportion of the effect due to a positive interaction between serology and ECDC symptoms in all symptoms except cough.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis population-based study quantifies the prevalence of persistent symptoms and examine symptoms according to ECDC COVID-19-like illness criteria and SARS-CoV-2 serological status. The results confirm the high prevalence of persistent symptoms in this population, especially in participants who experienced ECDC symptoms during the first pandemic wave. The mediation analysis showed that persistent symptoms associated with a seropositive status are mainly driven by the acute symptoms during the first pandemic wave.\n\nSome of these persistent symptoms were more frequent in participants with ECDC+/Sero+ than in the other groups, independently of the number of acute symptoms. It confirmed the importance of dysgeusia/anosmia, dyspnea, and asthenia in persistent symptoms.12,18,19 The risk of having the other symptoms that have been suggested as related to “long covid “ were similar or higher in ECDC+/Sero- than in ECDC+/Sero+. This suggest that these persistent symptoms are common and are often not specific to the causative agent. During the first wave of the epidemic in France in 2020, viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 were circulating.20 Furthermore, the lack of specificity of most symptoms or their combinations to the post-covid condition emphasizes the importance of studying post-infectious states. Chronic post-viral fatigue (CMV, EBV, HIV) is a known but poorly explained phenomenon related to a persistent inflammatory state, a latent infection, a particular psychological context, or functional disorders. It has been suggested that persistent symptoms are driven by the initial intensity of the disease as well as other multidimensional and indirect factors.21 This is in line with another study based on the CONSTANCES cohort which shows that, except for dysgeusia/anosmia, a self-reported infection of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with persistent physical symptoms regardless of the result of serological tests.22 Our results are complementary to these, by classifying individuals according to their symptoms in the acute phase rather than a classification according to the diagnosis, which may be affected by the beliefs of the patient and/or the doctor. Here we demonstrated that some symptoms are more associated with SARS-COV-2 infection, especially in case of symptomatic acute symptoms. However, it is interesting to note that the individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were like ECDC-/Sero-, except for having a higher risk of palpitations. These results should be considered with caution, although cardiac consequences in asymptomatic or mild infections have been suggested.23\n\nUnlike in other results in the literature evaluating outpatients with covid-19, the median number of persistent symptoms was low. This could be due to the population-based design of the present study. Most of the studies published in the literature were performed in specific populations (e.g. population with access to a PCR test during the first wave, healthcare workers) or in individuals who used the healthcare system for symptoms.12,19,24, 25, 26 This suggests that the intensity and the number of acute symptoms, which are associated with persistent symptoms, might have been higher in these previous studies than in the general population.11,12 The follow-up in the present survey was also longer. Thus, certain symptoms might have disappeared over time.\n\nPersistent symptoms are known to be associated with the acute disease.12 Here, we take the analysis a step further by quantifying the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on symptom persistence and its indirect effect, mediated by the symptoms present at the initial phase of infection. Interestingly, it appears that the effect is mainly indirect for all symptoms, even for those that are not included in the ECDC's definition. This strong mediation effect underlines the importance of symptoms developed during the initial episode on the risk of presenting persistent symptoms. In addition, the association of persistent symptoms with serology was higher in case of initial ECDC symptoms except for cough. Thus, it can be speculated that all interventions reducing the intensity and/or the number of symptoms of the acute phase of the disease might have an impact on the incidence of post-covid persistent complaints. If this is the case, the individual benefit of vaccination could be enhanced even in people at low risk of severe COVID-19, as already suggested.27\n\nThe strength of this study relies in its design, which was based on a large sample from the general population followed prospectively, thus allowing comparison of different groups of individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated by serological tests in all individuals. Data were not collected through the healthcare system, making the reported symptoms more representative of those perceived by the general population than in previous studies using healthcare databases.18,26\n\nThis work has certain limitations. First, symptoms were self-declared and were not evaluated with specific scales. Also the declarations may have differed depending on the recent medical history, especially during the pandemic where participants were more apt to believe that they had had COVID-19.22 In addition, we could not separate persistent symptoms related to an infection (COVID-19 or other) from those related to otherwise poor health or a change in access to health care. Moreover, the possibility of serology misclassifications cannot be excluded.9,22\n\nHowever, the fact that difference in the risk of anosmia is high between ECDC+/Sero+ and ECDC+/Sero- suggest that the prevalence for SARS-COV-2 infection is likely to be highest in participants with both positive serology results and ECDC symptoms declared during the first phase of the pandemic. Although this is one of the largest surveys on persistent symptoms after Covid-19 first pandemic wave, the number of individuals with this condition remained low in relation to the marked heterogeneity of the number and types of symptoms. Thus, we might have been unable to detect associations between the less frequent symptoms and COVID-19. We compared COVID-19 (ECDC+/Sero+) consequences to those of COVID-Like illness (ECDC+/Sero-). We assumed that this latter group was heterogenous. The consequences of COVID-19 need to be compared with other upper respiratory infection. A recent survey compared the consequences of COVID-19 and influenza in hospitalized patients.26 Although it showed that the burden of COVID-19 was greater, the comparison was performed between two different periods, and did not take into account the possible influence of the pandemic on other factors that could affect health and the health system. Finally, some symptoms following acute infection may not have been reported by participants - particularly if they appeared late after the initial two questionnaires were collected. In any case, this will only reinforce the fact that most of the effect of infection on persistent symptoms is mediated by the symptoms experienced in the acute phase.\n\nIn conclusion, there is an increased risk of persistent anosmia/dysgeusia, dyspnea, and asthenia in individuals with a history of COVID-19. Persistent symptoms are mainly driven by the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are needed to determine the origin of these persistent symptoms which could be associated with various pathophysiological causes that could also interact, from an inappropriate inflammatory response to a persistent functional disorder."
