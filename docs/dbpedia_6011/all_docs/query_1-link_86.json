The Journal des sçavans (later renamed Journal des savants), founded by Denis de Sallo, was the earliest academic journal published in Europe, that from the beginning also carried a proportion of material that would not now be considered scientific, such as obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports. The first edition appeared as a twelve page quarto pamphlet on Monday, 5 January 1665. This was shortly before the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, on 6 March 1665. *Wik\n\n1723 (Jan 5,1723 - December 6, 1788 ) Nicole-Reine Étable (de la Briere ) Lepaute was born in Paris and began to take an interest in mathematics and astronomy in around the time she married her husband Jean-André Lepaute the royal clock maker. Together with her husband she designed and constructed an astronomical clock, which was presented to the French Academy of Science in 1753. She, her husband and Lalande worked on a book entitled Traite d’horlogerie(Treatise on Clockmaking) that was published under her husbands name in 1755. Although she was not mentioned as author Lalande honoured her contribution as follows:\n\n“Madame Lepaute computed for this book a table of numbers of oscillations for pendulums of different lengths, or the lengths for each given number of vibrations, from that of 18 lignes, that does 18000 vibrations per hour, up to that of 3000 leagues.”\n\nFollowing her work with Lalande on Comet Halley, she again collaborated with him on the ephemeris for the 1761 Transit of Venus. She also collaborated with Lalande for fifteen years on the calculations for the Connaissance des temps. In 1762 she calculated the exact time for a solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764. She also wrote an article on the eclipse with an eclipse map. She produced star catalogues and calculated an ephemeris of the sun, moon and the planets from 1774 to 1784. Although childless she adopted and trained he husband nephew, Joseph Lepaute Dagelet (175116788) in astronomy and mathematics. He went on to become professor of mathematics at the French Military School and later deputy astronomer at the French Academy of Science, where he had a distinguished career. A comet and a crater on the moon are named in her honour. <br>This post taken entirely from a longer article by Thony Christie.\n\n1769 On January 5, 1769, James Watt finally received the patent for his steam engine: patent 913 A method of lessening the consumption of steam in steam engines-the separate condenser. *yovisto\n\n1853 \"First derivative\" first used as a noun in English in \"On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy\" by William John Macquorn Rankine, a paper read before the Philosophical Society of Glasgow\n\n1874 In a letter to Dedekind, Cantor asks if the points in a square can be put in one-to-one correspondence with those on a line. “Methinks that answering this question would be no easy job, despite the fact that the answer seems so clearly to be ‘no’ that proof appears almost unnecessary.” It was three years before Cantor could prove the answer was “yes”. *VFR\n\nIn 1892, the first successful auroral photograph was made by the German physicist Martin Brendel. Although it was limited to a blurred, low-contrast picture, it did convey some sense of the shape of the aurora. The task was not easy because the auroral light itself was generally feeble and flickering while photographic materials of the time required a long exposure, and was little sensitive to the deep reds in the aurora. One of his photographs, taken on 1 Feb 1892 was published in the Century Magazine of Oct 1897. Brendel had traveled to Alten Fiord, Lapland, to spend several months studying auroral displays and magnetic disturbances. The first colour pictures were not taken until about 1950, and Life magazine published colour aurora photographs in 1953.*TIS\n\nIn 1896, an Austrian newspaper, Wiener Presse, published the first public account of a discovery by German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen, the form of radiation that became known as X-rays.*TIS\n\n1900 Minkowski responds to Hilbert who had asked his opinion about several potential topics for Hilbert's address at the Second International Conference of Mathematicians in Paris, in the summer. Minkowski responds that, \"Most alluring would be the attempt at a look into the future and a listing of the problems on which mathematicians should try themselves during the coming century. With such a lecture you could have people talking about your lecture decades later.\" *Reid, Hilbert, pg 69\n\n1902 In a letter to his mother, Earnest Rutherford writes, “I have to keep going, as there are always people on my track. I have to publish my present work as rapidly as possible in order to keep in the race. The best sprinters in this road of investigation are Becquerel and the Curies... “ — 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson Ernest Rutherford * Quoted in A. S. Eve, Rutherford: Being the Life and Letters of the Rt. Hon. Lord Rutherford (1939), 80.\n\n1962 The first reference to Simula in writing is made. This early object-oriented language was written by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-John Dahl of the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo. Simula grouped data and instructions into blocks called objects, each representing one facet of a system intended for simulation. *CHM\n\n1974 The famous grasshopper weather vane atop Faneuil Hall in Boston was removed by thieves, but later recovered. When a weather vane was fashioned for this famous trading hall of colonial Boston, the grasshopper was chosen as it appears on the crest of Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of England’s Royal Exchange. He also founded the earliest professorship of mathematics in Great Britain, the chair in Geometry at Gresham College London.*VFR Gresham created the Royal Exchange in London in 1571. It was destroyed in the Great Fire in 1666. Like Faneuil Hall, it had a grasshopper on its weather vane as well. When the modern London exchange was built, a giant golden grasshopper is on top of it as well. Several other locations have grasshopper symbols of one kind or another, like the stone carving marking the location of Garraway's coffee house, and a hanging sign on Lombard St where a goldsmith owned by Gresham was located.\n\nFaneuil Hall weather vane *Wik"
