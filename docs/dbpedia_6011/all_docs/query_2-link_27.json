        "text": "Context: In the book \"New Thinking in School Mathematics\" (p.67) Prof. Gustave Choquet suggests to implement groups, rings and fields in secondary school mathematics. He then proceeds to list precise topics. Among other things he says \"Examples of group; ring of integers modulo $n$, homomorphisms of $\\mathbb Z$ over $\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$ and of $R$ over $R/a\\mathbb Z$\".\n\nHe doesn't define what $R$ is (presumably an arbitrary ring that contains the ideal $a\\mathbb Z$) but what baffles me is the choice of words: What is a homomorphism over something? I have heard of this phrasing in the context of algebras over rings for example but never in the context of homomorphisms.\n\nWhat does or could this mean?"
