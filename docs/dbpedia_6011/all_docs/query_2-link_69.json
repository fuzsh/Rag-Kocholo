        "text": "Revolutionary contributions…\n\n\"Mr. Talagrand is an outstanding and highly productive mathematician whose work has transformed probability theory, functional analysis and statistics. He has had a considerable impact on mathematics and its applications\", said Lise Øvreås, President of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nA member of the French Academy of Sciences, Michel Talagrand was CNRS Research Director at the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu - Paris Rive Gauche . He has been honored \"for his revolutionary contributions to probability theory and functional analysis, with remarkable applications in mathematical physics and statistics\".\n\nA student of Gustave Choquet, his scientific contributions cover topics ranging from measurement theory and functional analysis to probability theory and statistical physics. He proved several important conjectures, such as Fernique's conjecture on the regularity of Gaussian processes, the three-space problem for L1, Parisi's formula in spin glass theory, and Maharam's problem in measurement theory. With his original and innovative ideas and methods, Michel Talagrand has left his mark on several fields of mathematics with results and contributions of the highest order.\n\n…at the heart of today's issues\n\nThe common theme in Michel Talagrand's groundbreaking discoveries is working with and understanding the random processes we see all around us. The modern world is a constant flow of random events. Understanding this randomness has impacts for everything: from business logistics to condensed matter physics, as well as from weather forecasting to our great linguistic models.\n\nThe Abel committee believes that \"Mr. Talagrand's mathematical style is atypical. Solving a given problem often leads him to take it apart into small pieces, sometimes almost trivial cases, and digest them deeply. He doesn't hesitate to study simpler problems as springboards to other important discoveries\". Michel Talagrand says it's \"useful to be humble and start by fully understanding simple universal structures, because they raise important questions. After these steps, the problem studied is better understood, and there is then a potential path to the goal. Patience and technique are then indispensable\", he adds."
