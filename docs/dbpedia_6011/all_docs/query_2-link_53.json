But there were two very distinguished personalities at the beginning who directed and determined the work of CIEAEM in the first ten years: the French Gustave Choquet (President), the Swiss psychologist and cognition theorist Jean Piaget (Vice-president) supported by Caleb Gattegno as secretary. Choquet brought into the discussion the ideas of a reform guided by the restructured new \"architecture\" of mathematics, Piaget presented his famous results of research in cognition and conveyed new insights into the relationships between mental-cognitive operative structures and the scientific development of mathematics, Gattegno attempted to connect the new mathematical meta-theory to psychological research by a philosophical and pedagogical synthesis and to create and establish relationships with mathematics education as an important part of general education."
