        "text": "Idea\n\nElementary mathematics is a conventional term used in the mathematics education denoting the part of mathematics curriculum which does not require advanced, nonstandard or conceptually deep level of background (in particular, no infinitesimal calculus).\n\nThough most good approaches to elementary mathematics include setting up basic foundational issues at the appropriate level (for example the principles of proofs etc.), elementary mathematics should be distinguished from the foundations of mathematics.\n\nTerminological remark\n\nIn another, related but more narrow sense, in 20-th century education, high school and university mathematics was often divided into “elementary” and “higher” mathematics where elementary the part developed without usage of infinitesimal calculus. Higher mathematics in this obsolete sense denoted calculus and related subjects, but still not any research level, nonstandard or recent mathematics.\n\nReferences\n\nRelated nnLab entries include mathematics education, foundations, axioms of plane geometry\n\nEducational theory on elementary mathematics\n\nwikipedia: modern elementary mathematics\n\nModern elementary mathematics is the theory and practice of teaching elementary mathematics according to contemporary research and thinking about learning. This can include pedagogical ideas, mathematics education research frameworks, and curricular material.\n\nGeneral references on elementary mathematics\n\nThe following is a classics (vol. I in German 1908).\n\nFelix Klein, Elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint\n\nThe following overview of elementary mathematics is written by a Lebesgue’s student Lucienne Félix (1901-1994) in French, a well known name in mathematics education (cf. <http://guy-brousseau.com/lucienne-felix>); there are German and Russian translations but no English translation. The introduction says that many of the pedagogical ideas of Lebesgue are incorporated into the text.\n\nLucienne Félix, Exposé moderne des mathématiques élémentaires, Dunot Editeur, Paris, 1962, 1966; Translated into Russian by Prosveshenie in 1967, into German by Vieweg Teubner in 1969. Title of Rus. transl.: Элементарная математика в современном изложении, 1967\n\nSoviet mathematicains (A. D. Aleksandrov, complex analyst Markushevich and Hinchin) wrote in 1950s an ambitious 5-volume work “Encyclopaedia of elementary mathematics” (basic calculus included; geometry is volumes 4 and 5, redacted by Yaglom and Boltianskii):\n\nАлександров, Марукушевич, Хинчин, Энциклопедия элементарной математики\n\nReferences on elementary geometry\n\nHere we try to include only mathematically sound references which brought something new or are very influential, pedagogically original or well written.\n\nThe following texts contain useful material for teaching elementary geometry at an intermediate high-school and undergraduate level:\n\nRobin Hartshorne, Teaching geometry according to Euclid , Notices AMS 47:4 (2000) 460-465 pdf\n\nRobin Hartshorne, Geometry - Euclid and Beyond , UTM Springer 2000.\n\nDavid Hilbert, Stephan Cohn-Vossen, Anschauliche Geometrie , Springer Berlin 1932.

Levy, Universitext Springer 1987, 1994. xiv+427 pp.\n\nBasic calculus adapted to physicists and engineers\n\nInfinitesimal calculus is usually not listed as elementary mathematics. In US educational system infinitesimal calculus at rigorous and advanced level is usually called mathematical analysis while at the beginner’s level it is called simply calculus. The textbooks are very numerous and widely available and will not be listed here; they witnessed many trends and reforms like calculator-intensive courses and so on. As these textbooks are usually rich in accompanying techniques like teacher manuals, problem sets, solution sets etc. their authors are usually professional mathematicians most often those dedicated to teaching, rather than leading research mathematians.\n\nA different project of a beginner calculus textbook written by a leading physicist together with a leading geometer came from former Soviet Union\n\nYa. B. Zeldovich, I. M. Yaglom, Higher math for beginners, Mir 1987 (translated from Russian original published by Nauka in 1982) pdf\n\nSome argue that calculus is more intuitive for engineers if taught in the nonstandard analysis approach. One of the major such textbooks is free online\n\nH. Jerome Keistler, Elementary calculus: an infinitesimal approach, 2000 files; see also companion booklet Foundations of infinitesimal calculus, files\n\nFoundations of mathematics and categories\n\nFoundations of mathematics is a subject, which is beyond the very basics, NOT belonging to elementary mathematics, nor this entry. However, some readers of this page may find beneficial that we list just a very short choice of standard books on foundations for the first reading (but not that elementary).\n\nPractical Foundations of Mathematics\n\nElliott Mendelson, Introduction to mathematical logic, Chapman and Hall 1964, 1979, 1987, 1997\n\nThe following book is a unique attempt by two prominent mathematicians to give an elementary introduction to category theory directed at beginning students and general readers which is relevant to school education as well:\n\nF. William Lawvere, Stephen H. Schanuel, Conceptual mathematics: a first introduction to categories , Cambridge UP 1997.\n\nOne should note that the category theory is not traditionally considered a part of elementary mathematics even if some parts can be explained in an elementary way (the same is true for the simplest parts of infinitesimal calculus)."
