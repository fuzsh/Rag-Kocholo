        "text": "It seems that the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have finally reached the end of their long lives, since Samsung has removed both of these devices from its list of models to receive regular security updates.\n\nThe removal of security updates signals that the end has now come for the devices, and that no future updates are planned for either of them. Since the S6 and S6 Edge are both now three years old, having been revealed in the first ever Samsung Unpacked event, it’s not unreasonable for Samsung to cut both of these old flagships off after three years of security and major OS updates.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAn earlier report stated that the S6 Edge+ and the S6 Active had also been removed from the list, but that article has been amended to correct that Samsung then re-added both the S6 Edge+ and S6 Active, presumably because both of those devices are still just under three years old — the S6 Edge+ having been revealed at the same August 2015 event as the Note 5, and the S6 Active in June 2015. It’s fair to assume that support for both of these devices will expire later this year, to match the older models in the S6 range. It’s also unclear how this relates to a proposed update to Android 8.0 Oreo for the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge — according to previous reports, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge would receive the update. However, with this news that seems unlikely. We have reached out to Samsung for comment."
