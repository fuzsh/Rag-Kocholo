        "text": "Welcome to a battle of 2015’s most controversial new phones.\n\nThree months on from their star studded launch, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge continue to polarise opinion: those who think they are the stylish and beautifully crafted phones Samsung desperately needed, and those who think they’re style over substance and a betrayal of the Galaxy S range’s famed practicality.\n\nThey also divide opinion over which model is best: the cheaper, more traditional Galaxy S6 or the sexier but more expensive Galaxy S6 Edge. In fact that argument divides opinion even on Forbes and my colleague Ewan Spence wrote a strong argument in favour of the Galaxy S6 last week. You can read his long term comparison here:\n\nRead more - Samsung Galaxy S6 Long-Term Review: Why It Beats The Galaxy S6 Edge\n\nHaving also used both phones for three months I think differently, so Ewan and I planned these articles as a pair with him getting first bite. I now hope to persuade you otherwise.\n\nTo be clear I won’t be dwelling on the factors where the two phones are identical, namely: Android, TouchWiz, performance, call quality and their external speakers - but where the key differences in user experience lie. The exception to this rule is their cameras because they are a standout feature and there’s much to say after three months using them both.\n\nNote I would also like to thank Three UK and Vodafone UK for their long term loans of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge respectively.\n\nWith that out the way, let’s get started:\n\nDesign And Durability, Wear and Tear\n\nFirst an undeniable fact: both the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge are beautifully made.\n\nEvery angle, seam, button, speaker grill and port on these two smartphones is crafted to perfection. In fact, for my money, they’re both superior in finish to HTC ’s lauded One range which suffers from asymmetric port alignment and poor button placement.\n\nThen again when it comes to the choice of materials Samsung has used, it’s a whole different story and three months on I can safely say its controversial use of glass backs was a mistake.\n\nThis is because life with both phones is a constant exercise is wiping. They are fingerprint, smudge and smear magnets and the glass makes them both slippery and sweaty to hold during long calls or when gaming.\n\nInterestingly, the Edge’s more angular back edge actually makes it easier to hold, but the curve on the front makes it less comfortable and harder to pick up in the first place while you don’t really notice the fractional differences in their weight and dimensions:\n\nGalaxy S6 – 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm (5.64 x 2.77 x 0.27 in) and 138g (4.86 oz)\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge – 142.1 x 70.1 x 7 mm (5.59 x 2.76 x 0.27 in) and 132g (4.65 oz)\n\nAs for bumps and scratches, their Gorilla Glass 4 fronts and backs actually hold up better to day-to-day wear and tear than their aluminium edges which are quite easily scuffed.\n\nRead more - Samsung Galaxy S6 Vs Galaxy S5 Review: Should You Upgrade?\n\nThat said I did crack the Galaxy S6 screen from a single (accidental) three foot fall onto concrete, so while GG4 resists minor damage well it isn’t a miraculous leap that saves your phone from bigger incidents. I didn’t drop the Galaxy S6 Edge during my time with it but I’m sure its glass edges won’t make it any more durable.\n\nNeedless to say a case will address most of these concerns for the majority of users, but I’m here to test the phones themselves as too many case variables exist.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S6 - It’s Better In Hand\n\nNext page: Displays and Cameras...\n\nDisplays - Gorgeous Indulgence\n\nIn fairness you’ll want to protect both phones as much as possible because in dropping the Galaxy S6 I was distraught to break my second favourite feature: the display.\n\nMuch has been written about the ever increasing resolution of smartphone displays and yes, they are indulgent (more later) but they contribute to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge having the best mobile screens currently on the market.\n\nBoth are stunningly bright, vivid and with jaw dropping colours that aren’t overly exaggerated as has been Samsung’s want in the past. Which wins out? This divides opinion, but I found myself preferring the Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nWhile purists argue the curved edges slightly distort video and notifications in the corner bar (and they do), I love the ‘infinity pool’ bezel-less effect they bring to photos and video which makes them appear to be floating in air. The curve also fits perfectly in with the side swipe in gesture of Google ’s Material Design apps which feels great.\n\nAnd let’s be blunt: physically the Edge display looks amazing, everyone asks you about it and there’s nothing else which looks like it. These factors seal it for me.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S6 Edge - Real Wow Factor\n\nRead more - Galaxy S6 Vs iPhone 6 Review: Samsung Uses Apple To Beat Apple\n\nCameras - Best In Class\n\nI said the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge displays were my second favourite thing about these phones, despite their brilliance, and that’s because nothing can top the best feature: their cameras.\n\nAfter three months using both models they are quite simply the best smartphone cameras available on any phone. Yes, I know what you’re thinking: what about the iPhone 6 Plus or the LG G4?\n\nAddressing the former is simple: the S6 and S6 Edge are simply better. They capture more detail, are superior in low light, freeze moving objects more successfully and offer outstanding 4K video recording.\n\nThe battle is closer with the LG G4 because its offers more advanced settings which let enthusiasts produce photos which can top the S6es, but in auto mode (where most users will live most of the time) the Samsungs are noticeably more consistent in both colour accuracy and light balance.\n\nThere’s also the simplistic brilliance of the S6 and S6 Edge’s home button double tap to access the camera. The G4 and iPhone 6 cameras start equally quickly, but not from any location like the Samsungs. Reading your email, browsing the web or even gaming and notice a photo opportunity? These phones will have you ready to shoot in under a second.\n\nSo how do you separate the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge? In all honesty I couldn’t. A big reason for this is both my review samples have Sony sensors while some models use Samsung sensors which are claimed to be fractionally inferior but I haven’t witnessed this first hand.\n\nRead more - Samsung Galaxy S6 Vs Galaxy Note 4 Review: First Impressions Raise Big Questions\n\nSo, that aside, the only real differentiator is again the screens. If you like the Edge’s infinity display style (which I do) that’ll swing it and if you prefer the more technically correct flat S6 display that’ll have the advantage. But in reality...\n\nWinner: A Tie\n\nNext page: Battery Life and Software...\n\nBattery Life - A Potential Show Stopper\n\nSamsung split aspiring Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge customers right down the middle when it announced these phones would be ditching the customary removable battery of their predecessors. Some were infuriated, some couldn’t care less.\n\nSo how does it play out in reality? I’m sad to say it’s the greatest weakness of both phones.\n\nWhile it is debateable how many owners actually bought second batteries when the Galaxy S line could swap them, what is black and white is Samsung got it wrong in doubling that blow by also reducing the battery capacity.\n\nGalaxy S5 – 2800 mAh\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge – 2600 mAh\n\nGalaxy S6 – 2550 mAh\n\nOf course the first line of defence for this is: the new Galaxy S6es are more efficient, and that’s true: their Exynos 7420 chipsets use less power and even the power consumption of their 1440p displays are less than the 1080p display in the Galaxy S5.\n\nBut it isn’t enough. While their displays are efficient, the extra power required to drive pixels tothese incredible 2k screens is extreme. As such in light use both phones can get you through a whole day (a proper ‘bed-to-bed’, as I define it) but when the screen is on battery life drops like a stone and these smaller batteries can’t cut it.\n\nHow many apps you have installed, screen brightness, usage habits (Gamer? Reader?), even area signal strength all play a part but I struggled to ever get the S6 or S6 Edge beyond about 4pm without needing a charger.\n\nRead more - Galaxy S6 Vs LG G4: Samsung's Failed Galaxy S5 Successor\n\nThere is good news: with their supplied fast charger they do charge incredibly quickly (little more than an hour to go from 0-100%) and their dual standard (PMA and Qi) wireless charging is a great addition all phones should match. It may be slower than wired charging, but it's also much more convenient.\n\nSo, frustrated as I am, did the Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge hold any advantage over the other?\n\nNothing tangible. The extra S6 Edge capacity (just 2%) goes on the fractionally wider edge screen and I’d suggest you either carry a portable charger, keep close to wall sockets or curb your usage habits if you plan to have either phone last until bedtime. This is a real shame and fall from grace as the Galaxy S5 had best in class smartphone battery life last year and 1.5 days usage was common and the Galaxy Note 4 also blows them away.\n\nWinner: Both Lose\n\nSoftware - Having The Edge\n\nI’ll keep this short as it isn’t so much a discussion of both phone’s full feature sets (you’ll find that in Forbes’ full reviews) but rather where they differ - and here it is all about the Galaxy S6 Edge. In short: the Galaxy S6 Edge can do everything the Galaxy S6 can, plus a few party tricks.\n\nThe problem is those party tricks aren’t very good:\n\nPeople Edge - a shortlist of top contacts accessed by swiping left from the top right edge of the home screen and each contact is assigned a colour for:\n\nEdge Lighting - place the phone face down and the edge lights up in the colours assigned to contacts in the People Edge when they call\n\nInformation Stream - get news and weather highlights scrolling along the edge of the display\n\nNight Clock - display the time on the edge at night, making it easy to read from a bedside table\n\nYes this list is hardly awe inspiring and a long way off the useful functionality of the larger, single-sided curve on the Galaxy Note Edge. And yet I’ll give the win here to the Galaxy S6 Edge purely because of potential.\n\nLet’s be frank: right now Samsung is still figuring out what to do with the Edge, but as the company is clearly committed to the form factor it is evitable updates will come and eventually full third party developer access - which when the real rewards will come.\n\nRead more - Why Consumer Reports Warns Samsung's Galaxy S6 Is A Bad Buy\n\nGiven you’ll most likely own the Galaxy S6 Edge for a minimum of two years, evolution here is a marathon not a sprint and I have faith Samsung will eventually deliver. Either way, there’s nothing to lose.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S6 Edge - On Potential\n\nNext page: Value for Money and Verdict...\n\nValue For Money\n\nNow this is a biggie because if one thing is known about the Galaxy S6 Edge (other than its curved display) it’s that the price is much higher than the Galaxy S6. In fact it is $100 more expensive at every capacity price point:\n\nGalaxy S6 – 32GB ($600), 64GB ($700) and 128GB ($800) off contract – prices vary by carrier on contract\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge - 32GB ($700), 64GB ($800) and 128GB ($1,000) off contract – prices vary by carrier on contract\n\nNow this leads many to a simplistic conclusion, namely: both phones are almost identical so paying $100 more is stupid for the Edge, so just get the Galaxy S6.\n\nWell hold up a minute. Yes $100 is a lot, but even if that price difference is bolted onto a carrier contract over a typical two year period (704 days) the extra cost equates to just 14 cents more per day.\n\nShould that really sway your decision over which phone you live with for the next two years? Not in my opinion.\n\nSo technically while I’ll admit the Galaxy S6 is better value, it isn’t the extreme difference many would have you believe given the ownership timeframe. As such if you want a phone which looks genuinely space age and makes you smile every time you pick it up then don’t hold back on getting the much more exciting Edge.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S6 - But By Less Than You’d Think\n\nRead more - Samsung Silent On Disastrous Galaxy S6 Sales\n\nBottom Line - Winner: Galaxy S6 Edge\n\nWhen the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge were first released most comparison reviews of the two handsets gave the S6 victory. This was primarily based on price and the lack of exceptional Edge software. Neither factors have changed but three months on, I disagree.\n\nWhy? Because the Galaxy S6 is Samsung’s past and the Galaxy S6 Edge is its future.\n\nNo, the future isn’t perfect - the Edge display does need better applications and it should be cheaper - but it is also the far more exciting handset. It is the model which makes you smile every time you take it out your pocket, starts conversations and it is the only Android phone which makes iPhone owners genuinely look jealous. Which is satisfying.\n\nYou see a great deal of smartphone reviewing is done solely based on cold, hard statistics: who has the best specification sheet and who produces the highest benchmarks divided by cost? But the Galaxy S6 Edge is the first Samsung phone in years to complicate matters by throwing in a heavy dose of emotion. It’s a feel good factor that, for me at least, has yet to wear off.\n\nEwan disagrees and you may well disagree, but I want to live in a smartphone world where handsets aspire to be more like the daring design of the Galaxy S6 Edge than the play-it-safe Galaxy S6. Even if they (pardon the pun) have some rough edges.\n\nTechnology should be exciting and, for all its polarising flaws, after three months I found the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge still is.\n\nRead more - Android M Vs Android Lollipop: The Differences In Google's New Android 6.0\n\n___"
