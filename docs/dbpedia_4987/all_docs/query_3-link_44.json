        "text": "NEW YORK — Let's cut to the chase: Samsung nailed it with the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.\n\nThese are Samsung's finest and best-looking smartphones to date and if Android is your mobile cup of tea, they are the handsets to beat.\n\nSamsung designers heard the critics. Gone is the cheesy dimpled plastic. In is premium glass and metal.\n\nThe S6's strong resemblance to the iPhone 6 suggests a distant familial relationship with Apple (though we know otherwise). The phones are available in different colors, and when you hold them up to the light, you'll detect subtle changes in hues on the body of the devices, a nice aesthetic touch.\n\nThe 5.1-inch Quad HD Super Amoled displays on both phones are eye-popping. Of course, the cascading edge of the Edge makes it stand apart from other phones. Samsung introduced this curved \"secondary\" screen concept on its Note Edge phablet last year. I'm not totally convinced that it's all that useful or worth paying the extra $100 premium, but the potential is there. (Pricing varies by carrier.)\n\nOn the S6 Edge, you can use the edge of the screen to display a clock, notifications of missed calls, messages and e-mail, as well as stock quotes and sports scores. With the phone turned down, you can have the Edge screen light up in different colors when there are notifications from designated contacts. For now, though, you can't do as much with the edge display on the S6 Edge compared with the edge display on the Note Edge.\n\nStill, when you consider the latest phones, Samsung has managed to reclaim the Android pedestal without relying too much on the gimmicky parlor tricks that too often defined prior versions of its flagship phones.\n\nNo more emphasis on such gee-whiz trickery as waving your hand to answer a call or looking away from the screen to pause a video. The features Samsung is touting this time — wireless charging, mobile payments, improved fingerprint scanners — are precisely the kinds of things normal people will actually want to use.\n\nThe cameras are splendid and belong in the same conversation as the top-breed cameras on the latest iPhones. I was very pleased with most of the pictures and videos I shot with the rear 16-megapixel camera on the Galaxys, as well the 5-megapixel front cameras.\n\nYou can fire up the cameras in a blink by double-tapping the home key from any screen. New is a tracking feature that lets you keep your subject in focus as they move — think kids — but I found it a bit hard to master.\n\nI have to admit I'm taking a leap of faith on mobile payments because the Samsung Pay feature that promises to transform the phones into mobile wallets won't launch until summer. It remains to be seen how it stacks up against Apple Pay.\n\nThere are reasons to expect a positive outcome.\n\nThe aforementioned fingerprint sensors that you can use to not only unlock the device but to authenticate retail transactions as part of Samsung Pay is dramatically better.\n\nThe sensor on the predecessor Galaxy S5 model drove me nuts — it didn't come close to matching the speed or the accuracy of Apple's Touch ID.\n\nYou can now lay your finger on the home key and you're in. There's no need to swipe. Only rarely did either the S6 or Edge fail to recognize my finger. And yes, I'd have to say the experience is now on par with TouchID.\n\nMoreover, Samsung Pay looks as if it will be accepted at a lot more places than Apple Pay, at least out of the gate. Samsung claims Samsung Pay will work in about 90% of the retail terminals in the U.S.\n\nThe reason is that the phones are compatible with the contactless point-of-sale terminals that work with the NFC (near field communication) technology built into the handsets. But Samsung Pay also promises to work at more traditional \"magnetic stripe\" retail terminals that have been in place for years, thanks largely to Samsung's acquisition of the start-up LoopPay.\n\nThe addition of wireless charging means you can lay the phone down on a wireless charging pad in a Starbucks, say, to get some juice for your phone without wires. The phones support common wireless charging standards. I tested wireless charging on an accessory pad Samsung is selling and it worked fine.\n\nWhen you must use a wall outlet, Samsung includes a fast-charging plug that can provide, the company says, about four hours of power after just 10 minutes of charging, seemingly a reasonable claim based on my tests.\n\nAlas, the battery is no longer removable, however.\n\nAs with other recent Galaxys, there's a heart-rate monitor and Samsung S Health app. The new phones come in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB configurations, but there is no longer a memory slot to bolster the storage.\n\nThe device is also no longer water-resistant, as with the case with the S5.\n\nLike other flagship phones, the Galaxys run Google's Android Lollipop software, with some Samsung screen modifications, more refined than in the past, which is a plus.\n\nThe pressure was on Samsung to respond to feverish competition with something special. Samsung has met the challenge.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge\n\nsamsung.com\n\nPro. Attractive design, beautiful screen, excellent cameras, fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, fast-charging. Potential of Samsung Pay."
