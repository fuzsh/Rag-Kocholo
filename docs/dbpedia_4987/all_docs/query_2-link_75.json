        "text": "Android phones by Samsung have been among the best in their class for well over a decade, offering an amalgam of thoughtful design, top-notch hardware, and performance to match. Samsung was also the first smartphone maker to offer a mainstream foldable smartphone with the half a decade ago.\n\nThe tech giant kicked off 2024 by unveiling the Galaxy S24 series of smartphones. The Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 Ultra bring a host of design and hardware upgrades, along with intuitive AI-powered user experience features, developed in partnership with Google. (The search giant’s Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro brought the tech as a core feature late last year.) From enhanced communication and Google search capabilities to next-level camera performance and image editing, AI will have a hand in many tasks and interactions with your new phone.\n\nShop Prime Day Deals\n\nThis month, Samsung launched its latest foldable smartphones: the Galaxy Z Flip6 and Galaxy Z Fold6. As usual, the newcomers bring a ton of design and hardware improvements, headlined by more powerful chips, enhanced durability across the board, and seven years’ worth of timely Android platform updates. Because of their unique form factors, the latest foldable Galaxy phones take AI interactions up a notch from the S24 series, too.\n\nAs benchmarks for premium design and performance in the Android realm for many years, the Galaxy S lineup should always be on your radar of upgrade options by Samsung. The Galaxy A Series phones will get you instantly recognizable design and hardware features — especially an AMOLED display — at a much lower price point. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Series of foldable phones offer cutting-edge design and unmatched versatility with a price tag to match.\n\nThe Best Samsung Phones\n\nBest Overall:\n\nBest Budget Galaxy:\n\nBest Midrange Galaxy:\n\nBest Galaxy Under $1,000:\n\nA Premium Galaxy for Less:\n\nAll top-shelf smartphones from Samsung have a waterproof design, on top of other essential features, headlined by a vibrant AMOLED display (or two) with millions of individually backlit pixels, a speedy chipset, a versatile multi-sensor camera setup, fast wired and wireless charging, and stereo speakers. You’ll also get future-proof wireless connectivity features such as 5G, Wi-Fi 6/6E/7, and Bluetooth 5.0 (and higher).\n\nThe prices of the smartphones on this list are for unlocked, contract-free devices. That’s a great option to buy if you are a frequent upgrader or purchasing the phone as a gift. You can also, of course, opt to pay for any phone in small monthly installments, either from Samsung or through the wireless carrier of your choice.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nForm Factor\n\nWith the latest Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold iterations, Samsung transformed its foldable smartphones from expensive niche offerings to legit mainstream contenders. Therefore, they’re now worth considering before buying a Galaxy phone.\n\nCompared to standard rectangular slabs, foldable Galaxy phones offer vastly superior portability and multitasking chops. The Galaxy Z Flip is super pocketable, while the bulkier Galaxy Z Fold can replace a phone and a tablet in one. Due to their innovative design and more elaborate engineering, the Galaxy Z products are pricier than a standard high-end Samsung phone.\n\nDurability\n\nIn addition to being pricier, the foldable Galaxy Z smartphones lack the durability of their mainstream siblings, which have an IP rating for water and dust resistance. For comparison, the Galaxy Z Series phones have a lower durability rating. The intricate hinges of their foldable screens rely on moving parts, so sealing the products against prolonged exposure to water and dust is more challenging.\n\nTraditional Galaxy phones are also more likely to survive accidental drops with or without a protective case — so if you have a bad habit of frequently dropping your phone, you should keep this in mind. I highly recommend you purchase a case for a foldable Galaxy because its build is more complicated and less likely to withstand heavy tumbles.\n\nCamera\n\nEven though they’re on another level when it comes to multitasking and entertainment capabilities brought by their shape-shifting primary screens, Samsung’s foldable phones don’t have the camera prowess of the top-shelf Galaxy S handsets. This is entirely a matter of packaging and space — incorporating a foldable display inside the phone leaves less space for camera sensors and zoom lenses.\n\nIf camera quality is paramount to you, consider a Galaxy with an Ultra moniker. These phones always pack the best camera tech of any Galaxy.\n\nMemory\n\nThe more RAM a Samsung Galaxy phone has, the better it will be at multitasking — so if you plan on constantly toggling between many open apps, you should consider a phone with 8GB or more.\n\nRegarding onboard storage, if you plan to capture many photos and videos with your Galaxy’s (consistently stellar for the money) camera, consider getting a version with more storage than the 128-GB entry-level models provide. Most Samsung phones don’t have memory card slots for easy expansion, so spending another $50 to $100 upfront is worth it. Depending on your needs and budget, you can spec high-end Galaxy phones with up to 1 TB of storage.\n\nHow We Chose\n\nWe've been testing smartphones for years, including Samsung's Galaxy lineup. When new products launch, we begin testing them for weeks to evaluate their design, hardware, performance, and battery life as compared to older models. We also pay close attention to the overall value they deliver.\n\nThis Samsung Galaxy guide contains picks with the most up-to-date specs and features in their price categories — from affordable to high-end — ensuring that your new phone will keep you satisfied for a long time. We also included older iterations, which come at a slightly lower price point, that are still worthy and perfectly capable if you don’t need the latest bells and whistles. But we always recommend spending a bit more to get the current generation if you’re on the fence; the design and hardware improvements you’ll get are worth it.\n\nHere are the best Samsung phones worth buying today."
