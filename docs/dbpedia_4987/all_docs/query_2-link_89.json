Right now, you can get the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold 6 for up to $1,200 off its list price with eligible phone trade-ins. The Z Flip 6 is available with 512GB of storage and can be yours for up to $650 off its price tag with trade-ins.\n\n$1850 off (57%) Trade-in\n\n$1389 98\n\n$3239 98\n\nBuy at Samsung\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 6 is available at Amazon\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is available at Amazon. You can't take advantage of any discounts at the time of writing. This is the 256GB model.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is Samsung's 2024 clamshell foldable phone. It just got announced in a Samsung Unpacked event on July 10. Here's what you need to know about the device.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 retains the 3.4-inch outer display of its predecessor, even though early rumors said the external screen could grow to 3.9-inch. The main display is a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED, similar to its predecessor (although, when you account for the rounded edges of the Flip 5, the display gets to 6.6 inches).\n\nMeanwhile, we also have a similar design to its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 (albeit slightly thinner when folded). You can also enjoy some beautiful colors to choose from. Samsung has paid attention to the durability of the Flip and it now has enhanced layers on its screen with a less visible crease and an IP48 rating.\n\nAs for the camera, things are getting more exciting. We have a new 50MP main sensor, which is a substantial upgrade from the Flip 5's 12MP one. Apart from the new main camera, we still have a dual-camera setup with a 12MP ultra-wide. The selfie camera sports a 10MP resolution.\n\nThe phone comes with Galaxy AI support, Android 14, and the usual foldable features such as Flex mode. Luckily, the earlier rumors about an Exynos-powered variant turned out not to be true, so we have a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip to power the foldable. Also, we're finally getting 12 gigs of RAM. And a bigger battery - 4,000mAh.\n\nAs for the price, we're getting a $100 price increase in the U.S. and the phone now starts at $1099.\n\nJump to:\n\nRelease datePriceCameraStorageDesignDisplay specsBattery and charging specsFeatures and softwareHardware and specsGalaxy Z Flip 6 comparisons\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 release date\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 has just been announced during Samsung's July 10 Unpacked event.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 price\n\nThe US price for the Flip 6 is unfortunately seeing a price increase, just like rumors indicated. The phone now costs $100 more, and starts at $1099.\n\nOf course, just right after launch, we have generous Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals for you to get, so if you're from the early adopters, you have a chance to save some money.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 camera\n\nCameras aren't exactly the strongest suit of a foldable phone, but Samsung is looking to turn things with a new camera for the Flip 6.\n\nFor the Galaxy Z Flip 6 camera, we have some interesting things going on. We now have a 50MP main camera (the ultra-wide remains the same as the phone's predecessor at 12MP) with an aperture of f/1.8. This is a huge upgrade over the Flip 5's 12MP camera.\n\nApart from an upgraded main camera, you enjoy a dual-camera setup with a 12MP ultra-wide like the Flip 5. The foldable has a third camera (the selfie cam on the inner screen), which comes with a 10MP resolution.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 storage\n\nThings are already pretty reliable with storage when it comes to Samsung phones in general, and foldables in particular. For one, the Flip 5 is available in two storage configurations: 256GB or 512 GB. And that's the case for the Flip 6 as well.\n\nUsually, phones that come with more storage are more geared towards power users, and such phones include the beasty Galaxy S24 Ultra or the Z Fold 5 (these both have 1TB storage options as well). The Flip 6 isn't branded as a power-user phone though, and it doesn't have a 1TB option.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 design\n\nClamshell foldables gain points for design over other phones automatically - just because of their unique and recognizable form factor.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6's design isn't much different than what we have on the Galaxy Z Flip 5. We still get a beautiful clamshell form factor, a 3.4-inch external screen, and refined colors to choose from.\n\nSamsung is keeping its signature folder look for the outer display.\n\nWe have some slight differences in the look though: we have less space between the two camera lenses, and the speaker grille is changed from multiple small holes to one single cutout.\n\nLast time, Samsung improved on the hinge of the Flip 5 with a new hinge technology which helped make the foldable slightly slimmer. This time, Samsung has improved the foldable display and we get less of a visible crease.\n\nOn top of that, the foldable is now thinner when folded - by 0.2 inches, but it's still something. Its other dimensions are the same as its predecessor.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 dimensions vs Flip 5 dimensions (HxWxD in mm):\n\nFolded: 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9 vs 85.1 x 71.9 x 6.9 mm\n\nUnfolded: 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9 vs 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9\n\nWeight: 187 g. vs 187 g.\n\nAlso read: Galaxy Z Flip 6: Size Comparison\n\nAs for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors, Samsung is known to offer beautiful colors for its premium phones, and the Flip 6 continues the tradition. The following colors are the main Z Flip 6 hues: Blue, Mint, Silver Shadow, and Yellow, and we have Samsung.com exclusive: Crafter Black, Peach, and White.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 display specs\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6's display specs aren't much different from the Flip 5's.\n\nMain Z Flip 6 display specs (the folding screen):\n\n6.7 inches\n\n2640 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution\n\nDynamic AMOLED 2X\n\n1-120Hz adaptive display refresh rate\n\nOuter Z Flip 6 display specs (cover screen):\n\n3.4 inches\n\n720 x 748 resolution\n\nSuper AMOLED 60Hz\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 battery and charging specs\n\nWe are luckily getting an upgrade when it comes to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 battery. We now have a 4,000mAh battery for the Flip 6, which is awesome news.\n\nIn fact, battery upgrades are always awesome news, as this is an aspect of modern phones that can be improved almost endlessly.\n\nAs for charging, the foldable is getting 25W wired charging, just like its predecessor.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 features and software\n\nThe phone ships with Android 14 and One UI 6.1.1, and will then be probably updated to One UI 7 and Android 15 in late 2024. Samsung's much-advertised hot features, Galaxy AI, are also present on the Flip 6. Generative AI features included in Galaxy AI are Live Translate, Circle to Search, features to edit photos and other cool and fancy generative AI tricks.\n\nApart from that, we have the foldable-specific features from the Flip 5 like for example Flex Mode available for the Flip 6 as well.\n\nYou get to also enjoy FlexCam, now enhanced with a new Auto Zoom. The feature helps find the best framing for your shot by detecting the subject and zooming in and out to ensure everything looks as good as it can.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 hardware\n\nThe clamshell foldables by Samsung always come with the latest and greatest chip. In the Z Flip 6's case, this means a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip,finally 12 gigs of RAM for seamless multitasking, and a starting storage of 256GB. A bigger storage variant of 512GB is also available.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 comparisons\n\nNow the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is official and we're comparing it with some of its key rivals.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 vs iPhone 16 Pro - at first glance, those two phones are incomparible.
