When trying to share the contents by Quick share feature, the person I want to share with isn’t showing up.\n\nIf the person you want to share with isn’t showing up, make sure the other person’s device has Quick Share or Phone visibility turned on in the quick panel. Also, make sure the other person’s screen is on. You may incur additional charges when sharing files via the mobile network.
