        "text": "If you don't have a compatible charger from a previous Samsung phone or tablet, you need a replacement, or just want to have a spare, they are available on our website. Just find your model in the following list to make sure you get the right one!\n\nMost phones and tablets use either a USB Type C or Micro USB charger. USB Type C is the newest type of USB charger. The design helps prevent damage occurring inside the USB port because it doesn't matter which way you insert it into a phone or tablet.\n\nIf you aren't sure what model phone or tablet you have, you can check in the device's settings. Navigate to and open Settings, and then tap About phone or About tablet. Your device's name and model number will appear on this page.\n\nDevices that use USB Type C\n\nThe latest models: Galaxy Z Flip6 and Z Fold6\n\nGalaxy Z phones: Z Fold, Z Fold2, Z Fold3, Z Fold4, Z Fold 5, Z Fold6, Z Flip, Z Flip 5G, Z Flip3 5G, Z Flip4, Z Flip5, and Z Flip6\n\nGalaxy S phones: S8, S8+, S9, S9+, S10e, S10, S10+, S10 5G, S20 FE, S20 5G, S20+ 5G, S20 Ultra 5G, S21 FE 5G, S21 5G, S21+ 5G, S21 Ultra 5G, S22, S22+, S22 Ultra, S23 FE, S23, S23+, S23 Ultra, S24, S24+, S24 Ultra\n\nGalaxy Note phones: Note8, Note9, Note10, Note10+, Note10+ 5G, Note 20 5G, and Note20 Ultra 5G.\n\nGalaxy A phones: A03s, A10e, A20, A50, A02, A12, A13, A14 5G, A15 5G, A23 5G, A25 5G, A32 5G, A35, A42 5G, A71, A51, A21, A11, A01, A13 5G, A52 5G, A53 5G, and A54 5G.\n\nGalaxy XCover phones: Galaxy XCover6 Pro\n\nGalaxy S tablets: Tab S3, Tab S4, Tab S5e, Tab S6, Tab S7, TabS7+, Tab S8, Tab S9, Tab S9 FE, Tab S9+, Tab S9 FE+, and Tab S9 Ultra\n\nGalaxy A tablets: Tab A9+, Tab A 10.1 (2019-2020), Tab A 10.5 (2019), Tab A 8.0 (2016-2019), Tab A 8.4 (2020), Tab A7 (2020), Tab A7 Lite (2021), and Tab A 8 (2022)\n\nTo make things a little trickier, there are different kinds of USB-C cables. If you’re unsure which USB Type C cable you have, it’s most likely a 3A or 5A cable. Both types are capable of charging your devices as well as transferring data. However, 5A cables are thicker and able to carry more power.\n\nDevices that use Micro USB Type B\n\nYou're probably already familiar with Micro USB Type B cables. They've been used for a long time with multiple devices. The cable's head is not symmetrical. One side has ridges while the other is flat. Make sure to insert it into your phone's or tablet's USB port the correct way or it could damage the inside of your device.\n\nGalaxy S phones: S5, S6, S6 edge, S7, and S7 edge\n\nGalaxy Note phones: Note5\n\nGalaxy A phones: A6\n\nGalaxy J phones: J3 and J7 (all models)\n\nGalaxy S and E tablets: Tab S, Tab S2, and Tab E\n\nGalaxy A tablets: Tab A 10.1 (2016), Tab A 8.0 (2015), Tab A 7.0, and Tab A 9.7\n\nIf you've lost your Micro USB Type B charger, you can purchase a new one. You can also use adapters with these cables to charge USB Type C devices.\n\nAll phones since the S8 and Note8 are compatible with USB-C chargers and QI-certified wireless chargers. Newer Galaxy tablets are also compatible with USB-C chargers but may not work with wireless chargers because of their size.\n\nWall chargers:\n\nAdaptive Fast Charging Wall Charger: This is the standard Samsung charger that used to come with most Galaxy phones. It uses 15W.\n\n25W USB-C Fast Charging Wall Charger: This charger is even more powerful with 25W or 3 amps of power.\n\n35W Power Adapter Duo: This powerful charger supports USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 and lets you charge two devices simultaneously with a USB-C and USB-A port. Not only can you charge your Samsung phone or tablet, you can quickly charge any USB-C PD 3.0 device, like a laptop, or even an iPhone. The USB-A port supports Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging.\n\n45W USB-C Fast Charging Wall Charger: This powerful charger comes with 45W or 3 amps of power! Your device will be completely charged before you know it.\n\n65W Trio Adapter: With up to 65W total power output and Super Fast Charging, you can charge a range of devices all at once! To take advantage of 65W charging with a supported device, you'll need to be sure to use a 5A USB cable.\n\nWireless chargers:\n\nWireless Charger Pad 9W: This wireless pad lays flat on a table, so you can lay your phone down on it to charge. It can be used with other QI-certified devices like iPhones.\n\nWireless Charger Convertible: This is another charging pad, but it stands your phone upright. You can place your phone upright or sideways and use it while it’s charging!\n\nWireless Charger Trio: This new accessory lets you wirelessly charge three devices at once! You can charge a phone, a smart watch, and another device simultaneously. Switch it up for the best order that works for you.\n\n15W Wireless Charger Duo with Travel Adapter: This is a flat wireless charger that can fast charge two devices at once.\n\nThe following tips and instructions will help you get the most out of your device's battery.\n\nWall charger\n\nBefore you start charging, make sure you are using the correct charger for your device. When you're ready, all it takes is three easy steps to get your device charging at top speed.\n\nFirst, connect the USB cable to a charging adapter, and then insert the other end of the USB cable into the USB port on your phone or tablet.\n\nYou can then connect the adapter into a power source.\n\nNote: For the fastest charging time, connect your adapter to a power outlet. Plugging the USB cable into a computer or another device will lengthen the charging time.\n\nTo use a charging feature, navigate to and open Settings, then tap Battery, and then tap Charging settings. Tap the switch next to Fast charging or Fast wireless charging. Only the charging speeds your device supports will show up here. The device will determine the fastest charging available based on connected charger and battery status.\n\nWhen your device is finished charging, disconnect the USB cable from your device, and then remove the adapter from the power source.\n\nWireless charging and PowerShare\n\nYou can use wireless charging or PowerShare with compatible devices, such as Galaxy phones, Galaxy watches, and Galaxy earbuds. Please refer to our wireless charging and PowerShare guide for more information.\n\nBest practices for charging\n\nWhen using wireless charging accessories, please be aware that any metal or magnetic materials (e.g., coins, magnetic cards) placed between the device and the wireless charger may decrease charging efficiency or cause damage to the phone or tablet and charger.\n\nCharging may take longer when using adapters, charging wirelessly, or charging the phone or tablet through another device like a PC.\n\nWhen using wired charging accessories, always check whether any foreign objects are in the connector or plug, as they may prevent charging or cause the charging accessories to overheat.\n\nMake sure your phone or tablet doesn't overheat. Keep it in a cool location, especially while charging.\n\nDon't let your battery completely drain. With new lithium-ion batteries being used, it is better to keep the battery partially charged, instead of letting it die. When possible, charge your device in small amounts to keep the battery from depleting.\n\nNote: If the power has been depleted, the battery charging indicator may take up to 10 minutes to appear on the device's screen while charging.\n\nUse a genuine Samsung fast charger for the quickest charge. You can't use the fast charging feature if you're using a standard charger.\n\nIf your phone or tablet is not charging, there are a couple of things that could be causing the problem. However, if your charger doesn't work at all, it should be replaced. If it's under warranty you can request service. If not, you will need to purchase a new one."
