        "text": "I just finished reading about the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge announced at MWC today. I can’t say I’m entirely thrilled with some of the changes and some of the things that stayed the same:\n\nNo MicroSD slot - users will be offered 32/64/128GB models, no doubt at much higher cost than MicroSD memory. The pro on this is it is faster memory than a MicroSD, but who cares when it comes to music or pic storage?\n\nNo replaceable battery - smaller battery than S5, and non-replaceable. Will need to wait and see about battery life, but no matter how good, it won’t be as good as swapping to a fresh battery in about 30 seconds while walking through the airport, and someday while the phone is otherwise usable, it won’t be as good as a new battery.\n\nStill 16MP camera like S5, but faster lens (lower f-stop) means better low-light pics. Font camera is 5MP. Lens sticks out of back quite a bit, but shouldn’t be a problem with a case.\n\nDual edge - so far, reports seem unclear about whether the edges work the same as on the Note 4 Edge, or how this will impact ruggedness or case design. I read one report that hinted at a clock showing on the edge, and different colors appearing on the edge depending on which favorite contact is calling. Most reports indicated the edge was very subtle compared with Note 4 Edge, to the point they weren’t sure it was justified at all. Both phones do have Quad HD 5.1\" screens for 577 pixels per inch, however, but there are questions about power use.\n\nWireless charging - Both phones support wireless charging, but USB chargers are a lot more ubiquitous than charging mats. Fortunately it still has a USB port . The question is what is the charging speed for each method?\n\nNot water-resistant like S5 - Despite now being a sealed battery and no SD-card, the S6 is less water-resistant than the S5. This seems surprising.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n@Google\n\nWOW… They dropped the ball big on this… They literally took the best features that distinguish them from an iPhone and removed them to make it look “nicer” like an iPhone…\n\nI was expecting to upgrade to the S6, now I’m going to be in the market for a new vendor…\n\nDo people really need to change batteries mid way through the day any more? If you’re carrying a spare, you might as well have an external charging pack. The bigger problem is that the phone is expected to last for 2 years, but the battery gives up at 18 months…\n\nI’ve always lobbied for microSD slots, but my Note 3 has 32Gb of storage and I somehow can’t fill even that.\n\nWireless charging is useful - yes, USB leads are everywhere, which is why my wife will always unplug my phone to charge her kindle.\n\nI’ve had a couple Samsung smart phones. The thing I noticed with Samsung is that they are so excited to show off their new tech that they put it out there before it’s been fully developed and ends up causing problems, and the only solution to fix it is to upgrade to the newest version that fixed that particular problem while creating a new one. Now I just avoid them entirely because long term support for a device is questionable at best and practically nonexistent.\n\nNo removable storage and no removable battery make this phone an automatic NO for me. I hope they don’t do the same thing with the Note5 when it comes out. I have the Note3 now and was holding off for the N5 but I may just have to get the 4.\n\nNot impressed. They’re clearly just gunning for iPhone users with this new phone, which by the looks of it means that they’re going to some volume to HTC, LG, and Motorola for a little bit. However, there’s probably another more business-smart reason for the S6 being that way… cheaper phone = easier to get into the hands of random 2nd and 3rd party carriers, which would likely lead to a wider user base than staying with their previous offering as effectively one of the top-tier phones on the market (not that they won’t be still, but the S6 being effectively a lesser offering feature-wise than its’ predecessor probably means they’re gunning for market-share via back-end price cutting to retailers and carriers).\n\nI hope Lumia phones pick up some of the disgruntled Galaxy phone folks, but I’m a little prejudiced since I got my Lumia phones. ^.^\n\nI was really looking forward to this phone as I need a replacement for my S3. I can deal without the removable storage option since 32Gb is enough for me (although I would probably buy the 64gb version of this phone just in case). While the water-resistant feature of the S5 is nice, it isn’t anything I really need. However, the non-replaceable battery is an issue for me. I had to replace the battery on my S3 as it aged because it just wasn’t holding a charge long enough. Also, there have been times where the phone just locked up and I just removed the battery. With the S6 the only solution will be to let the battery drain which could take hours.\n\nI’m still on the fence whether to wait now for the Note 5 (or get the Note 4 now) or just go with the S6 despite these flaws.\n\nI love my S4, but no, I won’t be going with the S6. I want the ability to add storage and to change out the battery. I’ve had to have 3 new batteries in the few years I’ve had the S4. I don’t want to be sending off the phone for that, even if it is covered by a warranty.\n\nI’ll be looking at the LG and Sony offerings, amongst others, when I need my next phone."
