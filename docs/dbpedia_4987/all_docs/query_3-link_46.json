        "text": "I couldn't decide which was best for me so on Friday I ordered both the Galaxy S6 Edge and HTC One M9.\n\nI've had the S6 Edge for a day and while I work on my full review I thought readers might appreciate a quick rundown of how the Galaxy S6 Edge is different than the Galaxy Note Edge.\n\nIf you are looking for all of the great secondary screen functions found on the Galaxy Note Edge, then understand most are not available on the Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nThe only reason to spend the extra $100 on the S6 Edge over the S6 is if you prefer the unique design. The extra functions of the Galaxy S6 Edge are limited primarily to ways to view limited information and the edge is not as useful as the display found on the Note Edge.\n\nHere is how the Galaxy S6 Edge stacks up to the Galaxy Note Edge, in terms of specs:\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note Edge Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Processor 2.7 GHz Snapdragon 805 quad-core Exynos 7420 octa-core Display 5.6\" 2560 x 1440 Super AMOLED Quad HD 5.1\" 2560 x 1440 Super AMOLED Quad HD Storage 32GB with microSD card slot 32GB, 64GB, 128GB Cameras 16 megapixel rear with OIS, 3.7 megapixel front 16 megapixel rear with OIS, 5 megapixel front RAM 3GB 3GB Battery Removable 3000 mAh 2600 mAh Other Fast charging, S Pen functionality Fast charging, Qi & PMA wireless charging Dimensions 151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm / 174 g 142.1 x 70.1 x 7 mm / 132 g\n\nWhat about the edges?\n\nBoth of these unique Samsung phones have a special settings area titled Edge Screen. Here is the functionality present on each device.\n\nGalaxy Note Edge\n\nPanels for notifications, music control, app shortcuts, Twitter feed, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and Yahoo! News, games, carrier apps, S Health data, and panel store\n\nHandy tools panel that includes a ruler, stopwatch, timer, flashlight, and voice recorder\n\nAbility to have a custom panel that is shown when the device is locked\n\nNight clock\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge:\n\nPanels for notifications, Twitter feed, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and Yahoo! News, and other RSS feeds\n\nWeather, if you use the Samsung weather widget on a home screen panel\n\nNight clock\n\nPeople edge so you can easily contact people and have the phone light up with selected colors when face down\n\nThe Note Edge provides a more interactive experience that is especially useful for launching your favorite apps, controlling music while you do other things on your phone, accessing some cool tools, and having the camera capture controls moved out of the main viewfinder and onto the edge.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 Edge information panels are only available when the display is off and you have to make a back and forth swipe motion to activate. The ability to contact people quickly is available when the device is in use, accessed by swiping in from the light gray tab.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 Edge looks amazing and if you are a person who likes cool designs and wants to be different, then the $100 may be worth it to you. The sides are a bit sharper than the Galaxy S6 and you do notice text you are reading gets a bit strange along the edges as it curves down away from you. ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes posted a comparison of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge that you should read if you are trying to decide between these two.\n\nThe Galaxy Note Edge is a device to consider if you want something with a unique design that is also very functional. I personally prefer it over the Note 4, but don't use the S Pen enough to justify the larger device. Then again, with microSD storage expansion and a removable battery, the Note series may appeal more to the road warrior.\n\nIt's too early for me to say whether or not I am keeping the Galaxy S6 Edge, but I am having a blast using the latest and greatest from Samsung. BTW, I loved the emerald green one I saw in Spain, but that is not coming to the US anytime soon. I bought the black sapphire one, not realizing this meant in most well-lit areas the phone is navy blue and not black. As a huge fan of this color I am very pleased with my color selection.\n\nRelated ZDNet Galaxy S6 coverage"
