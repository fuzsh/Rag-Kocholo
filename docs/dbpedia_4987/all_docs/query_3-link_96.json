        "text": "Updated On Jan 20, 2015 at 02:48 PM IST\n\nSamsung was always expected to be announcing the Galaxy S6 Edge along with the standard Galaxy S6 in March. A new report suggests that this curved display model will be slightly different than what was initially expected. According to Sam Mobile, the smartphone will have a dual edge display, meaning there will be two curved edges on the device instead of just one as we saw on the Galaxy Note Edge.\n\nWe’re not sure how this will be useful for the customers, but it is said that the company will make usability a priority by allowing users to control almost every aspect of how these edges function. The report mentions features like Glance Lighting, which basically lights up these edges whenever you get an incoming call alert or a notification.\n\nYou can also set certain colors to contacts so that their name appears prominently on the edge of the screen during an incoming call or any other notification. We’re guessing Samsung will also allow users to enable each edge individually, which could help right or left handed users.\n\nThere are also going to be apps that can offer notifications on these edges, which is a feature currently available on the Galaxy Note Edge as well. Samsung will reportedly include support for a pedometer widget based on S Health and also a list of favorite apps set by the users.\n\nThe hardware on the smartphone is expected to be pretty much the same as the Galaxy S6, which includes a 2K resolution display, a Snapdragon 810 or Exynos 6 chipset, a 20MP camera, 4GB of RAM and Android 5.0 Lollipop with the latest iteration of TouchWiz.\n\n[Sam Mobile]\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETTelecom App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
