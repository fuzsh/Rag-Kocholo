        "text": "Page 1 of 7\n\nWhile there seems to be an endless number of Android phones on the market, for those of you shopping for one this summer are most likely only going to be looking at just a few. The perennially popular Galaxy S lineup being at or near the top of that list. This year Samsung introduced the S6 with two models (and just recently announced a third), you can pick from the regular Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge. On top of wanting to see what the new Samsung phones had to offer, I also really wanted to take a closer look at the difference between the two phones. I spent a little time with the original S6 and then spent a bunch of time with the Edge to see what sets it apart and also to see what justifies its higher price point. So today I’m going to talk a little about my experience.\n\nProduct Name: Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge\n\nReview Sample Provided by: Verizon\n\nWritten by: Wes\n\nPictures by: Wes\n\nAmazon Link: HERE"
