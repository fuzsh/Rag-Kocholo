        "text": "David Reiss\n\nDavid Reiss\n\nCo-CEO and Principal Consultant - helping businesses to transform using Cloud and DevOps\n\nPublished Jul 20, 2015\n\nIt's still amazing to me how much function is being crammed into smartphones - and the speed of releasing new models. They are a key productivity tool for digital workers, but also something that we connect with very personally.\n\nSo when I'm already attached to my smartphone, I want to know it's worth the time and money to upgrade. I faced this decision recently - and thought I'd share my experience.\n\nMy path to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge\n\nI've used all of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, upgrading when the new one comes out. Some of those upgrades have been a huge step forward, others (like the S4 to S5) have just been an incremental improvement.\n\nI recently got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, as an upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S5. Here's my impressions after a week of use.\n\nIt really is kinda sexy\n\nIt really is a nice looking phone - the build quality is great, it's slim and the curves are appealing. The screen is excellent and has a very broad viewing angle - so I have had to be careful if I didn't want people to see what's on the screen. I wasn't sure about the glass back at first, but it really feels better than the plastic back of the S5. The back is quite slippery, though - it has fallen off my lap a few times, thankfully onto a carpeted floor.\n\n... but the \"edge\" itself isn't that useful (yet)\n\nThe rounded edge of the screen has a few functions - a night-time clock, information ticker, subtle notification light and favourite contact notification bar. Of those, the best would be the information ticker, if it had useful information. Unfortunately there aren't many sources yet and the ones they have aren't ones that I use. Hopefully more will be added soon - and some of the functionality on the Note Edge.\n\nIt's NOT waterproof - and I like that\n\nThe waterproof feature of the S5 seemed like a great idea to me. I once dropped a phone into a toilet - and seriously considered leaving it for dead for a few seconds, before gritting my teeth and going in after it. But I found the S5 quite annoying, continually notifying me to close the seal when I took it off charge. I'm happier without it and will just be more careful in the bathroom.\n\nThere is no slot for an SD card to add storage\n\nI only have the 32GB version - and while I haven't filled it yet, I am going to have to limit how many photos, videos and songs I keep on the device. With cloud storage that might be less of an issue (it includes 100GB of OneDrive storage free for 2 years), but I like the speed of having my data on the device.\n\nIt's powerful and a pleasure to use\n\nWith dual CPUs, the speed of the user experience is excellent - even opening the camera happens almost instantly. Interacting with phone feels immediate and responsive and the graphics are fantastic. I haven't found anywhere near as many hangs and delays as I got on the S5.\n\nAndroid 5.0 \"Lollipop\" is better than it was on the S5\n\nIt's a slightly different version of the operating system than I updated on my S5 and it seems to work better. I still use the TouchWiz interface, though I am tempted to try some other options. Some of the little bugs have been fixed, but some new ones added in. The most annoying is that the Apps screen doesn't display the apps in alphabetical order. This is only an issue with the \"international\" (read: not USA) versions of the operating system.\n\n... and a little less bloated\n\nSamsung have a history of cramming as much as possible into their smartphones - much of it unwanted. Thankfully, the S6 feels a bit less bloated than the S5. I could uninstall more apps that I didn't want and those I couldn't, could be disabled so they don't show up. So they're at least out of sight - if not out of my limited smartphone storage.\n\nBattery life has been good (for me)\n\nSome online reviews have been fairly negative about the battery life, though I have found it ok. The battery lasts me until the end of the day with normal use. Previously I have had to install Juice Defender to always reach the end of the day. The battery can't be removed, so carrying a spare isn't an option. But it does come with a fast charging adaptor which charges the phone in only an hour.\n\nGood security that's easy to use\n\nI like knowing my phone is secure, but not if it compromises function. The S6 achieves this well. The fingerprint reader is much better than the S5, which I basically gave up on. It still takes a little precision and time to open - but it can be disabled when connected to \"trusted\" Bluetooth devices. So when it's near my Gear 2 smartwatch or my car kit, a simple swipe gets past the lock screen. It also comes with enterprise security features, like KNOX.\n\nThe 16-megapixel camera is fantastic\n\nI had reason over the weekend to take some pictures and also some video - and I'm really impressed by the quality. The interface is simplified and I've found the \"auto\" mode to reliably take good pictures. Samsung have also improved the image stabilisation, which I rely on when using a smartphone as a camera. Double tapping the home button opens the camera in only 0.5 seconds, so spur of the moment pictures are easier to get.\n\nConclusion - style and substance, at a cost\n\nEverything about the way the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge feels makes it the best of the range. Performance, functionally and aesthetics are definitely an upgrade. It's much more of an upgrade than the S4 to the S5 was - and it's easily the best smartphone I've ever used.\n\nIt's also a talking point - with many people commenting on how nice it looks and wanting to hold it themselves.\n\nI still think I will become frustrated about not having an SD card - and the interface has some strange bugs and quirks. Hopefully they will be ironed out with an update.\n\nFinally, it's not cheap - at $1349 for the 32GB model, that's $100 more expensive than the standard 64GB Galaxy S6, or the 64GB iPhone 6.\n\nBut despite the cost, if you're in the market for a premium smartphone, it is worth checking out.\n\n_________________________________\n\nPlease Like / Comment with your feelings about the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge\n\n_________________________________\n\nFollow me for regular articles about Digital Transformation, Innovation and Disruption.
