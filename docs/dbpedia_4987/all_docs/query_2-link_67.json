        "text": "Starting March 28, millions of Samsung customers will begin receiving One UI 6.1. This is the biggest update One UI has gotten in some time, with the One UI 6.1 update clocking in at 3GB or so, the same size as the Android 14 and One UI 6.0 update combined.\n\nThe highlight here is Galaxy AI, a variety of features and functions powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning that came out on the Galaxy S24 series in January.\n\nSamsung will start rolling out One UI 6.1 for the Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9 series on March 28.
