        "text": "Samsung has received a lot of criticism for the features omitted from its 2015 Galaxy smartphones, but their naming schemes have also left a lot of people confused. As it stands we now have the ‘Galaxy S6’, ‘Galaxy S6 Edge’ and ‘Galaxy S6 Edge+’.\n\nWhat is the difference between them? This is exactly what this guide will help you find out…\n\nSize - Smartphone Or Phablet?\n\nThe first point of differentiation is size:\n\nGalaxy S6 – 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm and 138g (4.86 oz)\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge – 142.1 x 70.1 x 7 mm and 132g (4.65 oz)\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ – 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9mm and 153g (5.39 oz)\n\nAs you will see, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are much smaller than the S6 Edge+. These are 5.1-inch smartphones with very similar sizes and weights while the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is a significantly larger 5.5-inch phablet.\n\nDisplays - Straight Or Curved?\n\nWhile the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are both smartphones, the real twins are the S6 Edge and S6 Edge+. This is because the Edge+ is essentially just a larger version of the Edge so they share the same highly distinctive curved displays:\n\nGalaxy S6 – flat 5.1-inch panel, 2560 x 1440 pixels (577 ppi), Super AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass 4\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge – curved 5.1-inch panel, 2560 x 1440 pixels (577 ppi), Super AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass 4\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ – curved 5.7-inch panel, 2560 x 1440 pixels (515 ppi), Super AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass 4\n\nYou’ll notice that because all three models sport the same native resolution, the smartphones have greater pixel density (pixels per inch) than the S6 Edge+ phablet. Don’t worry about this.\n\nAt the time of writing these phones (along with the Galaxy Note 5) have the best quality handset displays on the market. This may change with the upcoming iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, but it seems unlikely given Apple will stick with the lower native resolutions of the iPhone 6 (750p) and iPhone 6 Plus (1080p).\n\nConsequently of more use are the differences in how the displays work because the curves on the Edges have additional functionality compared to the flat display of the S6:\n\n‘Information Stream’ (headlines scroll on the screen edge)\n\n‘Night Clock’ (time shows on the edge at night)\n\n‘People Edge’ (swiping the top right corner brings up favourite contacts), and\n\n‘Edge Lighting’ (colour specific edge lighting when favourite contacts call).\n\nIn addition to this, the larger S6 Edge+ has an enhanced People Edge so it can send photos and emoticons. The good news is these changes are also being rolled out for the Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nPersonally I don’t think any of these are must have features, but they are a nice point of differentiation and I expect Samsung will improve them with new features over time.\n\nRead more - Galaxy Note 5 Vs Galaxy S6 Edge+: What's The Difference?\n\nDesign - Stunning But Impractical\n\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect to all three of these phones are the radical design changes Samsung has made from its previous design philosophy.\n\nThe Good - Gone are the somewhat tacky Galaxy plastic backs and there is also far greater attention to detail in the finishes of the new handsets with beautifully crafted edges, ports and buttons which match anything Apple has ever made. They’re a visual treat.\n\nThe Bad - Unfortunately with this added style is a loss of substance. Unlike the Galaxy S5, all three of these new models no longer offer:\n\nExpandable microSD storage\n\nA removable battery\n\nWater resistance.\n\nThere has been a lot of justifiable outcry about these regressive moves and for many at least one has proved to be a deal breaker. Samsung claims its own research found many users didn’t take advantage of these features, which is why they were removed. That may be true, but I do find the loss of these features across all three models to be disappointing.\n\nThere is also concern over the Gorilla Glass 4 backs in the new phones. Yes the potential to crack is an issue, but equally problematic is the glass is slippery to cold hands, sticky to warm hands and a fingerprint magnet. I would much prefer Samsung to use a removable metal back next time to give users the best of both worlds.\n\nOne key differentiator: the Galaxy S6 Edge+ uses harder Series 7000 aluminium on its edges which should mean it resists bumps and scuffs there a little better.\n\nPerformance - Fast Meets Even Faster\n\nIf you aren’t scared off by the features the new phones lose, then there are huge benefits to the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+. One of the greatest being their performance:\n\nGalaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge – Exynos 7420, Quad-core 2.1GHz and 1.5GHz CPUs and Mali-T760 GPU, 3GB RAM\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ – Exynos 7420, Quad-core 2.1GHz and 1.5GHz CPUs and Mali-T760 GPU, 4GB RAM\n\nIf you don’t look hard you might not spot the difference here: the S6 Edge+ has an extra 1GB of RAM compared to the smaller smartphones.\n\nThis is actually useful as Android has turned into a RAM swallowing beast since the release of Android 5.0 Lollipop (though that may change with Android 6.0 Marshmallow) and there is extra zip compared to the (already fast) S6 and S6 Edge.\n\nThat said none of these phones are slow. In fact, with the disastrous Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 launch, Samsung’s decision to use its own Exynos chipsets has proved inspired. The result is the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is the fastest phone in the world right now (alongside the identically specified Galaxy Note 5) with the S6 and S6 Edge right behind.\n\nOne Black Mark: despite all their power, Samsung heavily restricts background activity.\n\nJust the five most recent apps are held in memory meaning apps often need to reload when you’re multitasking. The upside is the phones remain sharp at all times, but this shouldn’t be an issue in the first place with so much power on tap and I hope Samsung changes this in a future firmware update.\n\nRead more - Galaxy S6 Edge Vs Galaxy S6 Three Month Review: Which To Buy?\n\nCamera - Best Of The Best\n\nPerhaps the best thing about the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+ are their cameras. In fact at the time of publishing they have the best smartphone cameras on the market.\n\nThat said I won’t be dwelling on them for one reason: they all feature the same camera module (minor sensor variations aside) so you’ll get identical (and incredible) results from each:\n\n16 megapixel Sony IMX240 sensor, F1.9 aperture, OIS, LED flash, 4K video. Front facing 5MP camera, F1.9, 1080p video\n\nFor a detailed review of what makes this camera so spectacular you can read my in-depth testing (and more photos samples) here. Apple will need to have something incredible lined up for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus to retake the smartphone camera crown.\n\nNext page: Features, Battery Life, (Jaw dropping) Charging, Cost and Verdict...\n\nFeatures - Numerous, But Bloated\n\nMuch like the camera the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 Edge+ share, I won’t spend a great deal of time on the software side of these phones as they are also identical.\n\nThis means Samsung’s love/hate TouchWiz UI on top of Android and a lot of bloatware - particularly following a deal with Microsoft which sees Skype, OneNote, Word, Excel and more pre-installed.\n\nOn the upside Samsung has made TouchWiz far more efficient with this generation of phones. It’s look isn’t to my taste, but it operates far more quickly and smoothly with numerous Samsung customisations in place. My favourites are:\n\nThe ability to arrange apps side-by-side\n\nTo shrink (most) apps into a small window while working elsewhere\n\nA double tap home button shortcut to quickly open the camera\n\nCustom ‘Theme’ support, which includes stock Android themes\n\nNotable differentiator: The Galaxy S6 Edge+ also has a shortcut where triple tapping the home button will shrink the UI to a small, one handed view. I actually think the view is too small (equivalent to about a 3-inch display) but it is very handy when you need to quickly type with one hand on the move.\n\nBattery Life - Bigger Is Better\n\nPerhaps my biggest concern with Samsung’s 2015 phones is they have taken a step backwards in their battery life compared to the 2014 models. That’s not progress.\n\nGalaxy S6 - 2550 mAh capacity battery\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge - 2600 mAh capacity battery\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ - 3000 mAh capacity battery\n\nThe issue is twofold:\n\nThese battery capacities have actually reduced (the Galaxy S5 had a 2800 mAh battery, the Note 4 phablet a 3220 mAh battery)\n\nThey run more demanding hardware\n\nThe latter requires some explanation as Samsung claims both the Exynos chipset and the new phones’ 2K displays are more efficient than their equivalents last year. That may be true for each component, but the problem is the energy required to drive pixels to their higher resolution screens is what causes the problem: apps, games, everything has to work harder.\n\nThe end result is Samsung has gone from being a leader in smartphone battery life last year to falling behind the pack this year. Whereas the Galaxy S5 would get you 1.5 days on a charge, I’ve yet to have the S6 or S6 Edge last me one full day with anything but the lightest use.\n\nRead more - Galaxy Note 5 Vs Galaxy Note 4: What's The Difference?\n\nIn this respect the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is better. Heavy use will still deaden it before a day is up, but when used in moderation it should see you survive ok. That’s a definite win for the larger S6 Edge+, but it’s still disappointing generationally.\n\nCharging - New Industry Standard Bearers\n\nI wouldn’t normally give Charging its own section, but while these phones have disappointing battery life their charging abilities are mind blowing.\n\nFirstly there’s the array of options: each model supports super fast wired charging as well as PMA and Qi wireless charging. No other phone currently supports both these wireless charging standards simultaneously.\n\nSecondly there’s the speed of the charging because they can charge in little over an hour. That’s about 2.5x faster than an iPhone 6 (which has an even smaller battery). Even 10 minutes from flat will give you 15-20% which is enough to get you crucial extra hours usage when out and above.\n\nWhich is best? Surprisingly it’s the Galaxy S6 Edge+. Despite having the largest battery Samsung has tweaked the charging performance since the S6 and S6 Edge were released in February and claims it charges 27% faster. Given how fast the S6 and S6 Edge already were this is to be commended.\n\nNow if only Samsung had fitted them with larger batteries in the first place…\n\nCost - Wallet Breakers, Key Storage Differences\n\nThe Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+ sit (alongside the Galaxy Note 5) at the very top of Samsung’s smartphone and phablet offerings and that is reflected in their high prices.\n\nGalaxy S6 - 32GB: $579.99, 64GB: $659.99, 128GB: $659.99\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge - 32GB: $679.99, 64GB: $759.99, 128GB: $759.99\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ - 32GB: $779.99, 64GB: $859.99\n\nA big shock is the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge prices are actually after Samsung issued a price cut and this still means these phones are priced more highly than any other Android phone with the Edge models within touching distance of Apple’s iPhones.\n\nBut perhaps an even bigger shock is Samsung - for some unknown reason - is not offering the larger S6 Edge+ in the largest 128GB capacity. Yes, this means for maximum capacity you need the smaller models! Hopefully this will change before long and Samsung will see sense.\n\nSo are these models worth their asking prices? And, if so, which one should you buy? It’s time for the...\n\nVerdict - Compromised Game Changers\n\nWhile the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 Edge+ have confusingly similar names and even more similar features, there are clear points of differentiation in terms of display, size, performance, storage capacity, battery life and cost.\n\nWeighing up which of these elements are most important to you will determine whether you opt for one of these controversial phones or skip them altogether.\n\nMy personal recommendation? While I bemoan the downgraded battery life on all three, for me the Galaxy S6 Edge+ holds most appeal.\n\nLike the S6 Edge it is stunning to look at and compared to the others it is slightly faster, lasts longer on a charge and charges even more quickly. The asking price is a concern and you will need to survive without the 128GB option, but if you can afford the expense I think it is the most eye catching phone currently available.\n\nYour move Apple…\n\nRead more - Android M Vs Android Lollipop: The Differences In Google's New Android 6.0\n\n___"
