        "text": "I was offered a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge a few months ago and I discovered over time that applications installed themselves on my phone and performed operations in the background and my ins such as activate the microphone , play music or send sms. I tried several factory values ​​reset but nothing changes, each time I have the internet connection activated they reinstall completely. This has the effect of heating my phone and reducing the life of the battery.\n\nSo I decided to flash my phone with an Official ROM that I did on SamMobile But when I launched the flash with Odin and my phone in download mode the operation failed!\n\nI haven't been able to solve this problem for months already that's why I come here to ask for your help.\n\nwhen the flash fails, my phone displays the error \"SECURE CHECK FAIL: (BOOTLOADER)\n\nI would like to make some clarifications: - my phone is an SM-G925F (This is what is written behind it is also what is displayed in the settings) - In download mode I rather see Product: name SM-G925L - in the developer option, I don't find the \"Unlock OEM\" button - When I click on \"Software update\" in my phone, nothing happens - I don't know if it's important to specify it but I live in Cameroon\n\nI need help please!"
