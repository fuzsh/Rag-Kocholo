It was rooted and it was running with EE apps. I assume it is from EE. But it was working fine even with 4G. I wanted to upgrade it to marshmallow. When I unroot it and upgraded to Marshmallow it stopped registering my phone on the network. I am in Pakistan and I purchased the phone from here.\n\nEverything is working fine with the phone WIFI, Mobile Hotspot etc. But the only problem is that it is not registering the network. Sim is being read by the phone and it searches all the available network but couldn't register.\n\nI downgraded the phone to lollipop and made the configuration just like it was before. I again rooted the device so that it may work again. But it was of no use. I have been struggling to make it work for the past 4 days..\n\nI have flashed modem.bin file of different carriers as well and tried to get that working but it doesn't work.\n\nPlease help me with that.. Any response will be very much appreciated.\n\nRegards...."
