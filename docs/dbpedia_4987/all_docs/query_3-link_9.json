        "text": "Ok, so my model number is SM-G925W8 (Canadian) and I assume all the parts on ifixit are listed for the American models. I just want to order a USB/Charging Daughter Board, does anyone know how picky I need to be here? or is there an american equivalent to my model number? Also does anyone have any suggestions for which adhesive to use inside the phone when I go to put it all back together?\n\nSo i recently got a good look at a photo for an OEM daughter board and the part is listed as G925A/W8 so the AT&T board would be the same as the Bell one. Now i just need to find out if the battery is the same across all the versions of the S6 series or if the S6, S6 Edge and the S6 Edge Plus all have different batteries"
