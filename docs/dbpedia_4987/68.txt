Hardware / sensors

Results from sudo hwtest on SM-G925T:

Results from sensors (package lm-sensors) on SM-G925T:

For reference, sensor information from sensorssandbox (f-droid) on SM-G925T; note that in addition to hardware-based sensors, it presumably includes software-based / derived sensors:

The following refers to SM-G925F (zeroltexx) and SM-G920F (zerofltexx): Some of the sensors, as well as the infrared (remote control) sender LED, can be activated by first initializing the sensorhub with a firmware blob (which Android does within the "lhd" daemon). This firmware blob is actually compiled into the downstream kernel already (readable in device /dev/bbd_patch), but needs to be uploaded to the sensor hub chip using a special packetized protocol in /dev/bbd_packet. An example Rust program for doing that is available here.
