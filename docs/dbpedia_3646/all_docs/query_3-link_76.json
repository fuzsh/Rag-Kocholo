        "text": "A donation from a world famous artist will enable a drama about war hero Wally Harris to be finished.\n\nMackenzie Thorpe has made a contribution of “several thousands of pounds” to the independent film about the Bracknell Second World War soldier.\n\nMr Harris was awarded the Military Medal for his heroism when he took on a German machine gun crew single-handed with a weapon he had salvaged from the D-Day beaches.\n\nHis story will be told in Above and Beyond: The Craftsman – an independent film which is being produced with the support of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Mr Harris’ old regiment.\n\nAs a REME ‘craftsman’ Mr Harris was trained as a mechanic, not a fighter but a split second decision to take on the enemy on his own saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.\n\nDirector Rowland Kimber said he was delighted with the donation. He explained: “We spent a week filming in May on Salisbury Plain with the Army and with this donation we should have it all done by the end of the year.\n\n“Wally visited the set and was making notes and advising on the action. The great thing is that Wally has been with us every step of the way. If we have a problem or want to check something we can just ask him.”\n\nWith filming on Salisbury Plain in the can, Mr Harris now plans to accompany the crew and lead actor David Persiva to Norfolk to film the D-Day landing scenes.\n\nThe 90-year-old said: “On Salisbury Plain standing with the actors dressed as German soldiers it took me right back.\n\n“I met David who is keen to do a good job and not let me down. I will be going to Muckleburgh in Norfolk when they film the D-Day scenes to advise.”\n\nMr Harris landed on Gold beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944, as part of the Allied invasion force but returned to the water later that day to salvage weapons.\n\nIt was with a Browning gun lifted from an abandoned craft that Mr Harris took on the enemy position in September 1944.\n\nHis regiment was pushing into Belgium to form part of Operation Market Garden – the infamous campaign immortalised in the film A Bridge Too Far.\n\nMr Harris, of Loughborough, Crown Wood, received his Military Medal for killing between 12 and 15 of the enemy and taking 15 prisoners.\n\nThe project has gained royal interest after Mr Harris was introduced to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh last month at\n\nBassingbourn Barracks in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe directors hope Mr Harris’ story will be the first of a series of films to commemorate those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty."
