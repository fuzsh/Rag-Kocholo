The 2050 Tour was not afraid to go to the extreme on the love of the party culture, with many of the rappers, including Wiz Khalifa asking, “Where the party at?”\n\nJuicy J’s set consisted primarily of his hit songs including “Bandz a Make Her Dance”. He took it upon himself to make sure the crowd was getting involved by routinely inviting females on stage to dance. He capped off his set with a 3-6 Mafia classic, “Stay Fly”.\n\nWiz Khalifa came out banging with Cabin Fever classics and even having a live drummer to give a more live show feel than most rap concerts do. Khalifa mellowed the crowd out with his “Kush and Orange” songs such as “Kid Named Frankie” and “Mezmorized” complimented by his oft-spoken motivational speaking, something he uniquely does in his concerts."
