        "text": "The mainstream music industry can be cutthroat. And even when some break through, most don’t last beyond the first 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThe opposite looks like it could be true for Jonathan ‘Sap’ King.\n\nOne of Delaware’s biggest stars, Sap continues to win in the music industry and just landed a collaboration that could end up taking his career into overdrive.\n\nSap is one of Delaware’s hottest and most sought-after record producers and has literally been putting Delaware on the map since 2008 when he produced Meek Mill’s first club hit, “In My Bag.” His first mainstream biggest hit came in 2011 when he produced the song “Donald Trump” for hip-hop star Mac Miller, which, in 2013, was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nSap has also produced for artists such as The Game, Schoolboy Q, Juicy J, Fat Joe, Freddie Gibbs and Wiz Khalifa, to name a few. But his most recent production credit may be the biggest yet.\n\nRELATED: Upcoming concerts in Delaware, Philly & region\n\nSTORY: Hoochi Coochi taking Delaware by storm\n\nRick Ross’s ninth studio album, “Rather You Than Me,” debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and features the track “Powers That Be,” produced by Sap. Besides the track being selected by a superstar like Ross, the song also features hip-hop legend Nas. That feature alone has opened the door for Sap to connect with Nas in the hopes of potentially working with the star on what could possibly be his last album.\n\nSap, who moved to Los Angeles last year, has been also working with rapper Nipsy Hussle and has confirmed at least one track placement on his upcoming album.\n\nBesides production, Sap’s career as an artist is beginning to take off. His single “O Eight,” all about his ascent as a producer in Delaware, has more than half a million streams on Spotify and is his most popular single to date. Sap plans to release his next album this summer.\n\nWe spoke with Sap on how he linked up with Rick Ross and Nas, other artists he’s working with this year, and how the Donald Trump song has been affected by this recent election.\n\nQ: So 2017 has already started out with a bang for your career. Tell us how you were able to get on Rick Ross’s new album?\n\nA: Really it’s all about work ethic and creating great relationships. That beat is actually like 3 or 4 years old and I sent it to Sam Sneak, who is a major part of Rick Ross’s team. I knew the beat had a Miami feel to it so I just sent it off and they loved it. I still had no idea a legend like Nas would be featured on the track.\n\nQ: How did you find out Nas would be featured and what was your reaction?\n\nA: Sam Sneak told me at first that I made the album and that there was a legend on the track with him. They couldn’t confirm or tell me yet so I kept guessing. I was like, “Is it Jay-Z?”, and all they could tell me was it was around that same level. Once I heard a rumor that Nas was going to be on Ross’s album I kind of figured that was my track. My reaction was pure shock. I still don’t think it’s fully hit me yet. It’s just a blessing that I really can’t describe. I just know that having someone like Nas rapping over a beat that I created is priceless. Hopefully, it won’t be the last time,\n\nQ: Who else can you confirm you’re working with this year?\n\nA: I’ve been working with Nipsy Hussle for a while now and his album is going to be crazy! I know I have one confirmed track on his album but we have many tracks we’ve worked on over the years. Nipsy is a real cool dude and is gearing up for a crazy album which he’s been working on for years now.\n\nQ: The song you produced for Mac Miller, “Donald Trump,” was almost prophetic now that he is the president. What are your thoughts on that song now almost 6 years later?\n\nA: It’s crazy how history turned out. Obviously, when the song was created, none of us could imagine he would ever be president. Neither I nor Mac Miller endorsed or voted for him but since he was elected the song streams increased dramatically. It actually charted on iTunes again, which is crazy for a 6-year-old track. What’s even crazier is the song was originally going to be named, “Take Over the World,” but Rostrum Records decided to go with “Donald Trump.” Who knew it would turn into this.\n\nQ: Your new album as a solo artist is set to drop this year as well. Why name it “With All Due Respect”?\n\nA: Well, I am a pretty humble dude and don’t do a bunch of flashing or talking on social media. But I feel like I deserve some respect. I’ve been doing this now for over 10 years and I feel like it’s time to stake my claim in this industry. I’m not the type to try and stunt on social media so I think it’s time I lyrically show people.\n\nFollow Sap on Social Media\n\nTwitter & Instagram: @TheRealSap"
