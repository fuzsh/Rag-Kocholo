As a follow up to ROLLING PAPERS, Wiz Released O.N.I.F.C. This album contained his songs “Work Hard Play Hard” and “Remember You” featuring The Weeknd. His third studio album, BLACC HOLLYWOOD, ‎debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Top 200 album chart and featured the hit single “We DemBoyz.” Soon after, Wiz’s track,‎ “See You Again,” off the FURIOUS 7 soundtrack, catapulted to the top of the charts across 95 countries. Holding the #1 spot for 12 consecutive weeks, “See You Again” broke records by being Spotify’s most-streamed track in a single day in the United States and in a single week in 26 countries. In addition to winning 3 Teen Choice Awards in 2015, “See You Again” continued its success by winning a Critics’ Choice Award in the “Best Song” category, winning two Billboard Music Awards in the categories “Top Hot 100 Song” and “Top Rap Song,” earning three Grammy Award nominations in the categories “Song of the Year,” “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” and “Best Song Written for Visual Media,” and a Golden Globe nomination in the category “Best Original Song – Motion Picture.” Wiz released his album, KHALIFA, in February 2016 as a thank you to fans which includes the tracks “Bake Sale” featuring Travis Scott and “Elevated.” In June of the same year, Wiz collaborated with Juicy J to debut TGOD MAFIA PRESENTS: RUDE AWAKENING and TM88 and also embarked on his co-headlining “The High Road Summer Tour” with Snoop Dogg. On April 20th, 2017, Wiz launched his mobile app, Wiz Khalifa’s Weed Farm, which has garnered over 10 million downloads and is currently being played in over eight countries and six languages. Later that year, Wiz’s mixtape, LAUGH NOW, FLY LATER, was released in November and featured the chart-topping hit, “Letterman.” His latest studio album, ROLLING PAPERS 2, which is certified gold, was released in July 2018. It contains his hits “Something New” featuring Ty Dolla $ign and “Hopeless Romantic” featuring Swae Lee. Following the release of ROLLING PAPERS 2, Wiz and rap duo Rae Sremmurd hit the road for their “Dazed and Blazed Tour” throughout summer 2018. Most recently, Wiz just wrapped his “2009” joint tour with Curren$y which kicked off in February 2019 in support of their new mixtape in the same name. These tours are just part of the seven shed summer tours Wiz has headlined.\n\nAbout French Montana\n\nSome artists blur genres, but French Montana blurs borders. His inimitable fusion of classic East Coast rhymes, wavy pop swagger, and international ambition elevated him to the forefront of the game on a global scale. Earlier this month French dropped a new single entitled “Slide” [feat. BLUEFACE & Lil TJay], off his upcoming album. In the fall of 2018 he released “No Stylist” [feat. Drake], a beat thumping track that was accompanied by a music video featuring cameos from A$AP Rocky, Cam’ron, Dapper Dan, Young Thug, Luka Sabbat and Slick Rick. The hit earned platinum certification from the RIAA and crossed 200 million streams on Spotify.\n\n2017 saw him ascend to superstar status with the smash “UNFORGETTABLE” [feat. Swae Lee]”, which cemented him in the “Billion Club” for streaming and earned a quintuple-platinum certification from the RIAA. Meanwhile, his sophomore effort, JUNGLE RULES, went gold and dominated the charts. At the same time, he has left an indelible mark on communities around the globe. In addition to becoming the very first rap ambassador of Global Citizen, he staunchly supported humanitarian efforts, spanning DACA, the viral Mama Hope #UNFORGETTABLE Dance Challenge, which raised over $500,000-plus, and his Pan-African health and education movement into Morocco with Care Morocco. 2018 also saw him become a U.S. Citizen after emigrating to the South Bronx from Morocco at just 13-years-old.\n\nAbout Playboi Carti\n\nJust a few years after edging into Atlanta’s hip-hop underground, Playboi Carti released his highly anticipated debut self-titled debut on April 14, 2017. The tape debuted at #12 on the Billboard 200. His first release for Interscope Records and AWGE, Playboi Carti features “Magnolia” and “wokeuplikethis*”—two chart-busting singles that embody the 22-year-old rapper’s deeply experimental but hook-heavy sound. Both tracks featured on the Billboard 100 (Magnolia peaked at #8) and appeared on Spotify’s RapCaviar playlist, accolades that affirmed Playboi Carti’s position as one of today’s biggest breakout hip-hop artists. Playboi Carti has also won recognition within the fashion world, landing features in Vogue, GQ and W Magazine. He played to sold out crowds last summer on his debut headlining world tour, including festival appearances at Rolling Loud, Coachella (alongside Lil Uzi Vert and Gucci Mane,) and the Forbes 30 Under 30 festival where he was selected as the 2017 Music Callout.\n\nPlayboi Carti released his first album Die Lit as surprise release on May 11 via AWGE/Interscope Records. Die Lit debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, and amassed over 60K in consumption units in its first week with over 82.1 million streams, more than double the first week streams of his 2017 self-titled debut. The album garnered a great deal of critical acclaim, earning an 8.5 score and Best New Music nod from Pitchfork, who lauded it as a “57-minute sugar high that’s even wilder, more disorienting, and more perversely infectious than its predecessor.” SPIN has praised the album for its “broadcast[ing] a refreshing and well-developed aesthetic–one that feels like Carti’s specific achievement.” Meanwhile, Stereogum has hailed Die Lit as “a strange, exciting, physical record…It bursts with ideas and with personality, and it sets itself immediately apart.” A week following the release, Carti made a surprise appearance on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, joining musical guest Nicki Minaj for a performance of “Poke It Out.” Nicki Minaj is featured on “Poke It Out,” a track included on Die Lit.\n\nAbout Live Nation Entertainment:\n\nLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
