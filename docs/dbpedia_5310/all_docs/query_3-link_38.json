As a follow up to Rolling Papers, Wiz Released O.N.I.F.C. This album contained his songs “Work Hard Play Hard” and “Remember You” featuring The Weeknd. His third studio album, Blacc Hollywood, ‎debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Top 200 album chart and featured the hit single “We DemBoyz.” Soon after, Wiz’s track,‎ “See You Again,” off the Furious 7 soundtrack, catapulted to the top of the charts across 95 countries. Holding the #1 spot for 12 consecutive weeks, “See You Again” broke records by being Spotify’s most-streamed track in a single day in the United States and in a single week in 26 countries. In addition to winning 3 Teen Choice Awards in 2015, “See You Again” continued its success by winning a Critics’ Choice Award in the “Best Song” category, winning two Billboard Music Awards in the categories “Top Hot 100 Song” and “Top Rap Song,” earning three Grammy® Award nominations in the categories “Song of the Year,” “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” and “Best Song Written for Visual Media,” and a Golden Globe nomination in the category “Best Original Song – Motion Picture.” Wiz released his album, Khalifa, in February 2016 as a thank you to fans which includes the tracks “Bake Sale” featuring Travis Scott and “Elevated.” In June of the same year, Wiz collaborated with Juicy J to debut TGOD Mafia Presents: Rude Awakening and TM88 and also embarked on his co-headlining “The High Road Summer Tour” with Snoop Dogg. On April 20th, 2017, Wiz launched his mobile app, Wiz Khalifa’s Weed Farm, which has garnered over 10 million downloads and is currently being played in over eight countries and six languages. Later that year, Wiz’s mixtape, Laugh Now, Fly Later, was released in November and featured the chart-topping hit, “Letterman.” His latest studio album, Rolling Papers 2, which is certified gold, was released in July 2018. It contains his hits “Something New” featuring Ty Dolla $ign and “Hopeless Romantic” featuring Swae Lee. Following the release of Rolling Papers 2, Wiz and rap duo Rae Sremmurd hit the road for their “Dazed and Blazed Tour” throughout summer 2018. Most recently, Wiz just wrapped his “2009” joint tour with Curren$y which kicked off in February 2019 in support of their new mixtape in the same name. These tours are just part of the seven shed summer tours Wiz has headlined.\n\nAbout French Montana\n\nSome artists blur genres, but French Montana blurs borders. His inimitable fusion of classic East Coast rhymes, wavy pop swagger and international ambition elevated him to the forefront of the game on a global scale. Earlier this month French dropped a new single entitled “Slide” [feat. BLUEFACE & Lil TJay], off his upcoming album. In the fall of 2018 he released “No Stylist” [feat. Drake], a beat thumping track that was accompanied by a music video featuring cameos from A$AP Rocky, Cam’ron, Dapper Dan, Young Thug, Luka Sabbat and Slick Rick. The hit earned platinum certification from the RIAA and crossed 200 million streams on Spotify."
