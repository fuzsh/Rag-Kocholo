        "text": "Wiz Khalifa responds to the idea that his career has reached its peak. Speaking with T-Rell on the Back On Figg podcast, the Pittsburgh rapper shared a confident answer after the host asked what he has to say to any detractors of his star power and talent.\n\n“I think people are always gonna say that if you’re not right in their face, but if you look at what I do or the amount of sh*t that I put out or how constantly I’m working, you can’t say that,” answered the 36-year-old.\n\n“Even the old songs that I have, they’re still streaming, they’re still popular. The ni**as who might have old songs, they can’t do those old songs right now.”\n\nHe continued, “They can’t sell tickets, they can’t go places across the world. So I’m still able to do those things and I’m still releasing newer music. So that’s not even possible to say that and be real about it. You can say it because that’s what you think, but if you add it up, it don’t make no sense.”\n\nThe chart-topping rapper released his latest project Khali Sober last month and as VIBE describes, “flexes his melodicism as much as his rap prowess.” Across 12 songs, the mixtape features contributions from producers, including Quadwoofer Bangz, ID Labs, Lex Luger, and Iamsu.\n\n“Adding to sauce creatively. I love to create, so just the act of doing something new inspires me,” explained Wiz Khalifa to Men’s Health earlier this year about remaining in the rap game after nearly two decades."
