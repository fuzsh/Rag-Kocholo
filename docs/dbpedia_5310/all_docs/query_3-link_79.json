        "text": "Grammy®-Nominated Superstar Scores First-Ever #1 Debut On SoundScan/Billboard 200;\n\nAcclaimed Album Also Atop Array of Other Charts;\n\nFall 2014 Wiz Khalifa Collection By Converse In Stores;\n\n“Blacc Hollywood” Available Now\n\nRostrum/Atlantic recording artist Wiz Khalifa has made a spectacular chart debut with his acclaimed new album. “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” arrived at #1 on the SoundScan/Billboard 200 with sales in excess of 90,000 – Wiz’ first time ever at the top of the overall chart. The album is also standing tall atop a range of other rankings, including Billboard’s “Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums,” “Rap Albums,” “R&B Albums,” and “Digital Albums” charts.\n\nThe GRAMMY® Award-nominated rapper’s third full-length label release “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” showcases such recent singles as “KK (Feat. Project Pat & Juicy J),” “You and Your Friends (Feat. Snoop Dogg & Ty Dolla $ign),” and the critically acclaimed hit, “We Dem Boyz.” Released earlier this year, “We Dem Boyz” proved an immediate hip-hop hit, earning total sales approaching 500,000 while ascending to the top 5 on Billboard’s “Hot Rap Songs” chart. In addition, the Detail-produced track’s official companion video – directed by Ethan Lader (Bruno Mars, Ty Dolla $ign) – is an online blockbuster with close to 39 million individual views at www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX6K7waag5Q. An additional array of official audio and companion videos can be found at Wiz’s official YouTube channel www.youtube.com/taylorgangent.\n\nAlong with its remarkable popular success, “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” has received an incredible response from such national publications as Rolling Stone, which hailed the album for its “supremely chill singsong flows about how much Wiz loves to get high, over beats as softly enveloping as a cloud of sweet smoke.” “A surprisingly strong offering,” noted Billboard, “rooted in simplicity and banking heavily on Khalifa’s natural charisma…(Wiz) seems more certain about and comfortable with who and where he is than ever before. And where he is, is a new creative zenith.”\n\nHaving spent his summer heralding “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” on the third annual “Under the Influence of Music Tour,” Wiz has slated a number of live dates through November, including Austin, Texas’ Fun Fun Fun on November 9th. For complete information, please see www.wizkhalifa.com/tour.\n\nWiz will celebrate both the success of “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” and the recent unveiling of the Fall 2014 Wiz Khalifa Collection by Converse with a major meet-and-greet appearance, scheduled for tomorrow, August 28th at New York City’s Footaction (112 W 34th St.) between 6PM and 8PM. For more information re: the Fall 2014 Wiz Khalifa Collection by Converse – featuring the new Converse Chuck Taylor All Star ILL – please visit play.converse.com/blog/2014/08/20/wiz-khalifa-collection-by-converse-2.\n\nWiz Khalifa lit up the hip-hop universe with his 2011 Rostrum/Atlantic debut album, “ROLLING PAPERS,” highlighted by the 4x platinum-certified #1 single, “Black and Yellow,” the 2x platinum-certified hit “Roll Up,” and the platinum-certified “No Sleep.” “O.N.I.F.C.” made an incredible chart debut upon its release in 2012, arriving at #1 on Billboard’s “Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums” and “Top Rap Albums” charts, not to mention coming in at #2 on the overall SoundScan/Billboard 200.\n\nIn addition to his massive popular success, Wiz has earned a career total of five GRAMMY® nominations, including nods for such blockbuster tracks as the chart-topping “Black and Yellow” and 2012’s RIAA gold-certified “Remember You (Feat. The Weeknd).” Other nominated tracks include 2011’s “Young, Wild & Free (Feat. Bruno Mars),” Wiz’s 3x platinum-certified, top 10 smash partnership with Snoop Dogg (featured on their 2011 collaborative soundtrack, “MAC & DEVIN GO TO HIGH SCHOOL”), and Maroon 5’s 2012 worldwide hit, “Payphone (Feat. Wiz Khalifa).”\n\nMore than just a music powerhouse, Wiz is also a fashion-forward icon and entrepreneur. In addition to deals with Raw® Rolling Papers (https://rawthentic.com/raw-life/raw-wiz/) and luxury headwear designer Flat Fitty (flatfitty.com/product-category/wiz-khalifa-collection), Wiz recently announced a new partnership with leading active lifestyle brand Neff for the “BLACC HOLLYWOOD” collection, available exclusively at Zumiez.
