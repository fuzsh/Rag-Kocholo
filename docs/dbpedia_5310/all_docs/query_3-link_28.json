The tour will be a can’t miss event bringing together two influential and culture shaping artists, who continue to march to the beat of their own drums, for one epic co-headlining night.\n\nAbout Wiz Khalifa\n\nMulti-platinum selling, Grammy® and Golden Globe nominated recording artist Wiz Khalifa burst onto the scene with mainstream success with the release of his first major label debut, Rolling Papers‎ in 2011. ‎Rolling Papers spawned the hugely successful hits “Black and Yellow,” “Roll Up” and “No Sleep” and gave Wiz the platform to win the award for Best New Artist at the 2011 BET Awards and Top New Artist at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. His sophomore studio album, Blacc Hollywood, ‎debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Top 200 album chart and featured the hit single \"We Dem Boyz.\" Soon after Khalifa's track,‎ “See You Again,” off the FURIOUS 7 soundtrack, catapulted to the top of the charts across 95 countries. Holding the #1 spot for 12 consecutive weeks, “See You Again” broke records by being Spotify’s most-streamed track in a single day in the United States and in a single week in 26 countries. In addition to winning three Teen Choice Awards in 2015, “See You Again” continued its success by winning a Critics’ Choice Award in the category Best Song, winning two Billboard Music Awards in the categories Top Hot 100 Song and Top Rap Song, earning three Grammy® Award nominations in the categories Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media, and a Golden Globe nomination in the category Best Original Song – Motion Picture. In 2016 Wiz announced his partnership with RiverRock Cannabis on an exclusive line of regulated cannabis products, his first such collaboration in the regulated cannabis industry and renewed his partnership with RAW Rolling Papers. Wiz released his album Khalifa in February of 2016 as a thank you to fans which includes the tracks “Bake Sale” featuring Travis Scott, “Zoney” and “Elevated.” In June, Wiz released TGOD Mafia Presents: Rude Awakening with Juicy J and TM88. He recently co-headlined “The High Road Summer Tour” with Snoop Dogg and released his mixtape Laugh Now, Cry Later introducing the chart topping hit, “Letterman.” He’s also preparing to release a new studio album called Rolling Papers 2 which will be available everywhere July 13.\n\nAbout Rae Sremmurd\n\nMississippi-bred brothers Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi make up the hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd. Their third album SR3MM arrives as the follow-up to SremmLife 2—a 2016 album offering the multi-platinum No. 1 hit “Black Beatles” (ft. Gucci Mane). SremmLife 2 drew acclaim from the likes of the New York Times, who noted that “thanks to the more-meditative production,SremmLife 2 is at times a commentary on and an updating of decades of Southern club rap.” Meanwhile, Pitchfork pointed out that tracks like “Black Beatles” “push their talents to new heights by redefining what the duo can and will do.”"
