Fresh outta the oven, Wiz Khalifa cooks up plenty of delectable treats to go around on “Bake Sale,” the hotly-anticipated collaboration with Travis Scott from his self-titled album, Khalifa, expected to arrive tomorrow – or at midnight on iTunes – as per comments made while on the red carpet of the 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards earlier this month.\n\n“I got flowers, wax, inhalers, edibles – all shit you never saw,” boasts the Taylor Gang leader as he extends a warm welcome to any and all potential buyers on the hospitable record, which features production by Juicy J, TM88, Lex Luger, Crazy Mike and DJ Spinz, after the original beat – constructed by the latter along with Southside and GSP – was eventually sold to G-Eazy for “Order More” off his recent album, When It’s Dark Out. Listen to the finished product below."
