        "text": "As quiet as its kept, Wiz Khalifa had an amazing run with his Taylor Gang recording imprint. Over the years, the label has not only delivered his album, but it has also attracted talent like Chevy Woods, Ty Dolla $ign and Juicy J. While it has been some time since Wiz Khalifa and company released a Taylor Gang posse cut or compilation, it appears that the bond between the artists that have been featured on the label is as strong as ever.\n\nJuicy J and Wiz Khalifa have always worked together to produce quality music. In the past, the duo has developed tracks like “The Plan” and “Smoke A N*gga.” More recently, they’ve released “Pop That Trunk” and “Backseat” with Project Pat. Now, they’re going to take their longstanding “Stoner’s Night” series and turn it into an entire album.\n\nJuicy J isn’t stopping here. In addition to releasing an album with Wiz Khalifa, he also plans to drop a project with Pi’erre Bourne who is best known for his work on “Magnolia” with Playboi Carti. Bourne confirmed the project’s existence by sharing a video of the two hard at work in the studio.\n\nWhile we wait for the Juicy J and Pi’erre Bourne joint album, check out Stoner’s Night with Wiz Khalifa below."
