        "text": "There have been dozens of epic feuds in rap's long and contentious history: this might be the weirdest.\n\nWiz Khalifa and Juicy J recently collaborated on a rap song — “Shellshocked” — for the upcoming Michael Bay-produced “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” movie, but '90s hit rapper Vanilla Ice is unimpressed.\n\n“With respect to all of the artists, the song doesn't really do it for me. It feels a little artificial — what I mean by that is that it sounds like a bunch of executives in the corporate world put it together.” Ice told GQ.\n\nAlso read: Megan Fox Tells ‘Ninja Turtles’ Haters to ‘F-ck Off’\n\n“It really does not fit the theme of the Ninja Turtles legend. I think you have to understand, and be a true Ninja, to possess the Magic to really pull off the secret sound.”\n\nWhile Ice wrote “Ninja Rap” for the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze” soundtrack, he remains best known for his 1990 hit “Ice Ice Baby,” and that one time he destroyed an MTV set with a baseball bat.\n\nKhalifa and Juicy J are best known for their current, popular, multi-song rap careers.\n\nAlso read: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ 9/11 Poster Shell Shocks Social Media\n\nHear both songs below:\n\n“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” starring Will Arnett and Megan Fox, hits theaters Aug. 8.\n\nThe post New ‘Ninja Turtles’ Rap From Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J Deemed ‘Artificial’ by Vanilla Ice appeared first on TheWrap.\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\n'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Review: Michael Bay's Reboot an Empty Shell\n\nMegan Fox Tells 'Ninja Turtles' Haters to 'F-ck Off'\n\n'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 9/11 Poster Shell Shocks Social Media"
