He rose to fame in the late 2000s and has since become one of the most recognizable figures in contemporary rap music. Fans often wonder when Wiz Khalifa \"came out,\" or when he first gained widespread recognition in the music industry. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the timeline of Wiz Khalifa's career and discuss when he truly broke out into the mainstream.\n\nWiz Khalifa was born Cameron Jibril Thomaz in Minot, North Dakota, on September 8, 1987. He grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he began rapping at the age of nine. In 2005, at the age of 18, Wiz Khalifa released his debut mixtape, \"Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania.\" The mixtape received some positive reviews, but it did not generate much buzz outside of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 2006, Wiz Khalifa signed with Warner Bros. Records and released his debut single, \"Say Yeah,\" which sampled Alice Deejay's hit \"Better Off Alone.\" The song was a moderate success, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. However, it did not become a mainstream hit, and Wiz Khalifa's career remained in a relatively dormant state for the next few years.\n\nIt wasn't until 2010 that Wiz Khalifa truly broke out into the mainstream. That year, he released his third studio album, \"Rolling Papers,\" which featured the hit single \"Black and Yellow.\" The song was an instant success, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming one of the biggest rap songs of the year. \"Rolling Papers\" also received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, cementing Wiz Khalifa's status as a rising star in the music industry.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Rolling Papers,\" Wiz Khalifa continued to release hit singles and albums. In 2012, he released his fourth studio album, \"O.N.I.F.C.,\" which featured the hit single \"Work Hard, Play Hard.\" The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and received mixed reviews from critics. In 2014, Wiz Khalifa released his fifth studio album, \"Blacc Hollywood,\" which featured the hit singles \"We Dem Boyz\" and \"Stayin Out All Night.\" The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nSince then, Wiz Khalifa has continued to release music and collaborate with other artists. He has also dabbled in acting, appearing in films such as \"Gangs of Roses 2: Next Generation\" and \"Mac & Devin Go to High School.\" In 2020, he released his latest studio album, \"The Saga of Wiz Khalifa,\" which featured collaborations with artists such as Megan Thee Stallion, Tyga, and Logic.\n\nIn conclusion, Wiz Khalifa came out as a rising star in the music industry in 2010, when he released his third studio album, \"Rolling Papers,\" which featured the hit single \"Black and Yellow.\" The song became one of the biggest rap hits of the year and helped to catapult Wiz Khalifa into mainstream success. Since then, he has continued to release hit singles and albums, solidifying his status as one of the most recognizable figures in contemporary rap music."
