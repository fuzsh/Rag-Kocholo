        "text": "Canadian brothers DVBBS keep showcasing their creative prowess by breaking genre barriers with their new single with Wiz Khalifa - \"SH SH SH (Hit That),\" a record sitting on the intersection of bass and hip hop music, infused with a sample coming from a startup rapper, urfavxboyfriend, that DVBBS accidentally stumbled upon on his TikTok account on one of the uploads. They loved the line from the get-go and knew they had to make it into a full-length track. Wiz wasted no time jumping on board, and the rest is history - a unique sound that sees DVBBS experimenting and Wiz's signature flow with the catchy \"SH SH SH\" vocal overlay. This unusual release is part of the growing trend of TikTok mashups that have become popular with the platform and Instagram's videos, giving previously unknown artists yet another way to break through to the masses. Viral dancer and social media personality Casey Frey recently uploaded his video take on \"SH SH SH (Hit That)\" with DVBBS & Wiz Khalifa's track to Instagram, which has amassed over 280K likes and surpassed 6M views within only 3 days from its upload.\n\nDVBBS\n\nOnly a few producers have risen to the top in the electronic music scene as quickly as DVBBS, who captured the industry's attention with hits like \"Tsunami\" and \"Not Going Home\" and never let it go. The Canadian brothers Alex and Christopher have been continuously cultivating their sound since their debut in 2012 and have racked up an impressive display of collaborations with renowned names from diverse musical backgrounds, such as blackbear, 24kGoldn, Jasmine Thompson, Belly, NERVO, Juicy J, Galantis, Cody Simpson, Aloe Blacc, Icona Pop, GASHI, and more. DVBBS continue to prove there's nothing they can't accomplish. Their hits, such as \"La La Land,\" \"Gold Skies,\" and the breakthrough \"Angel\" are staples in every dance music fan's library. Prior to the global pandemic, DVBBS performed a staggering 250 dates per year at some of the world's hottest music festivals and top-tier clubs, including Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Ultra Music Festival, Hakkasan Las Vegas or Ibiza's Amnesia, and Ushuaia. Throughout their career, DVBBS has proved they are relentlessly dedicated to expanding their global footprint and bringing cutting-edge new music to their listeners.\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nA perfect balance of pop hooks, effortless charm, and stoner rap swagger, Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa was one of the highest-rising stars of a certain sect of mainstream hip-hop in the 2010s. With a series of hits built around slick rhymes and slicker production, Khalifa moved from mixtapes to stadium anthems and even major motion-picture soundtrack collaborations with pop star Charlie Puth. In 2018, Wiz released the single \"Hopeless Romantic\" with Swae Lee b/w \"Real Rich\" with Gucci Mane. Both tracks appeared on his sequel, \"Rolling Papers 2,\" which arrived that summer. Khalifa returned in February 2019 with the Trippie Red and Preme collaboration \"Alright,\" and revisited his collaborative friendship with Curren$y for the nostalgic mixtape 2009 and the cloudy, old-school-tinged \"Fly Times, Vol. 1: The Good Fly Young.\" These more off-handed and casual mixtape releases were followed in 2020 by the brief but manicured production of the seven-song EP \"The Saga of Wiz Khalifa.\" In addition to strongly stylized pop production, the EP included high-profile features from Logic, Quavo, Tyga, Megan Thee Stallion, and more. After devoting much of the next few years to collaborations and rapid-fire mixtape releases like the Juicy J joint project Stoner's Night and the quadruple-threat Full Court Press with Smoke DZA, Girl Talk, and Big K.R.I.T., Wiz returned in July of 2022 with his seventh solo studio album, \"Multiverse.\" Recorded primarily in Khalifa's home studio in Los Angeles, \"Multiverse\" was a more mature outing for the rapper and dealt with lyrical themes of self-acceptance, fatherhood, and emotional growth. His charm, persona, and weedy wit have been in peak form from the time of his major-label debut - 2011's \"Rolling Papers,\" to 2022's more mature \"Multiverse.\""
