        "text": "Not only has that relationship between estranged couple Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose long been strained, now the rapper has penned some lines on Juicy J’s new song “For Everybody” that appears to slam his former lady love.\n\nAmong the lyrics are these: “I fell in love with a stripper/Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker/They don’t pay attention to the love anyway/They only concerned with what the haters say/Bottles be turning these girls into THOTS/Instagram turning these wifes into hos.”\n\nThat rap does appear to refer to Rose’s past as a stripper, her recent feuds on social media and those sexy Instagram photos she’s posted.\n\nAnother hint that Khalifa was indeed dissing Rose? He posted artwork with the song on Soundcloud that included a photo of himself and Juicy J, taken at Khalifa’s wedding to Rose.\n\nThe couple finally split — and in very bitter fashion — last September, with both slinging infidelityh accusations at each other."
