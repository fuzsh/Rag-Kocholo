        "text": "The rapper — who shares a 10-year-old son, Sebastian, with Amber Rose — explained that he shows up high to his son's school because that's his true self.\n\n\"And yeah, I'm pulling up stoned; I'm pulling up high because I want them to connect with the real me,\" Khalifa said. \"They're not going to get a fake version of me or this made-up parent that society makes you think that you're supposed to be.\"\n\nHe also shared that he doesn't believe in changing himself or acting like a different person just because of the nature of the places he's going to.\n\n\"That's not how I'm going to be living my life ever. Hell no,\" Khalifa said.\n\nThe \"See You Again\" rapper also added that he's almost certain that his son \"smells like weed.\"\n\n\"I don't know because I can't smell it, but I'm pretty sure he smells like pot,\" he said.\n\nThe rapper is known for his habit of smoking marijuana and even has his own brand of weed, Khalifa Kush. He previously mentioned that he believes smoking weed gives him more 'breath control' during workouts.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThis is not the first time that a celebrity has spoken about parenting while under the influence.\n\nIn December 2022, American actor Lake Bell admitted she \"can't get through the holidays without\" marijuana, during a panel hosted by Cann — a cannabis-infused beverage company, per People.\n\n\"I am straight up a better parent when I'm just two Canns in,\" Bell said, referring to the beverage company. She wrote and directed a promotional video, \"Cann-Do Holiday,\" to promote the drink last year.\n\nIn January 2011, Mark Wahlberg revealed at the Palm Springs Film Festival that he gave up smoking marijuana because of his kids, per Today.\n\n\"One day, we were driving and you could smell it from somewhere. My daughter asked what the smell was so I told her it was a skunk,\" Wahlberg said. \"Then she said, 'Sometimes Daddy smells like that!' to me and my wife. So I knew I had quit.\""
