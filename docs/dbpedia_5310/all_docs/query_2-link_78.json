        "text": "Wiz Khalifa is not here for the claims that he fell off — and he has the receipts to back up the fact he hasn’t.\n\nThe Taylor Gang CEO dropped in to the Back On Figg podcast that was streamed live on Friday (October 27). When co-host T-Rell asked his thoughts on the haters that say he isn’t hot anymore, Wiz broke down exactly why that’s not a factual statement.\n\n“I think people are always gonna say that if you’re not right in their face, but if you look at what I do or the amount of shit that I put out or how constantly I’m working, you can’t say that,” he said. “Even the old songs that I have, they’re still streaming, they’re still popular. The n-ggas who might have old songs, they can’t do those old songs right now.”\n\nHe continued: “They can’t sell tickets, they can’t go places across the world. So I’m still able to do those things and I’m still releasing newer music. So that’s not even possible to say that and be real about it. You can say it because that’s what you think, but if you add it up, it don’t make no sense.”\n\nYou can view the full episode below:\n\nWiz Khalifa is one of few artists who haven’t been affected by the slump in ticket sales in recent years, and has continued to tour both nationally and internationally year after year. This past summer, he successfully hit the road with Snoop Dogg, Too $hort, Warren G, Berner and special guest DJ Drama for the 33-city High School Reunion Tour.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, the “Roll Up” rapper will be crossing over into the country genre for the 2024 Stagecoach Country Music Festival, bringing Hip Hop to the annual country music concert.\n\nWiz will be headlining Sunday night’s “Late Night in Palomino” event when the three-day festival takes place from April 26-28, 2024 in Indio, California (aka the home of Coachella).\n\nDespite not quite fitting the country mold, sources connected to the Pittsburgh native told TMZ “there was no hesitation” in taking the gig and that he’s excited to be bringing his “amazing show full of hits” and stage presence to the show. Jelly Roll and Post Malone will also be among the performers.\n\nThe news followed Wiz Khalifa’s recent appearance at country music star Morgan Wallen’s concert in the former’s hometown of Pittsburgh.\n\nDuring his two-night sold out tour in the Pennsylvania city in August, the “Black and Yellow” rapper came out to support Wallen at the PNC Park.\n\nKhalifa performed his best-known hit and gave Wallen a true Pittsburgh welcome, embracing him and handing him a Terrible Towel (the rally towel associated with the Pittsburgh Steelers) before he left the stage.\n\nWiz is just the latest rapper to show love to Wallen. Back in May, it was revealed that Lil Durk and the country star were actually the best of friends, going so far as to call one another “family,” and even went on a fishing trip together.\n\nIn a post shared to the rapper’s Instagram that month, the unlikely pair appeared decked out in camo as they showed off a fresh new catch they snagged while fishing in Wallen’s hometown of Tennessee.\n\n“Family is family can’t nothing change that p.s I’m done wit fish,” Smurk wrote in his caption.\n\nWallen also posted a photo of their fishing session while joking: “Durk done pulled up and taught me how to fish,” with Durk adding in the comments: “Family energy.”"
