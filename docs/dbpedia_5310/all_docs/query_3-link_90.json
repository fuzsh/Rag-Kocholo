        "text": "Not only have we been gifted by solo music from Niall Horan and Zayn Malik in the past year, we edge ever closer to Liam Payne becoming the third One Direction boy to hit the charts on his own.\n\nLiam has now signed two records deals, one in the UK and one in the US. Fans celebrated his latest announcement with the hashtag #CongratsLiam trending on Twitter.\n\nA lot of people believed it was confirmation that his girlfriend Cheryl had confirmed a rumoured pregnancy. She hasn't.\n\nIt has been nearly a year since One Direction dropped their fifth album Made In The A.M. and while it has been a quiet 12 months, things are starting to get a little noisier.\n\nHere's what's happening with each member of 1D and their solo careers - or frustrating lack of.\n\nLiam has already been working with some very big name artists behind the scenes. He is believed to have worked with Jennifer Lopez on her next album and a leaked track with rappers Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J hinted at a hip hop direction.\n\nOh, and then there's his girlfriend Cheryl Cole - who will has passed on a few nuggets of information about pop stardom over breakfast, we're sure.\n\nLiam is expected to release his debut album in late 2016 or early 2017. With rumoured dates like these, we reckon there's a good chance Liam could be among the guest performers on the X Factor live shows.\n\nNiall has warmed our cold, dead hearts with his debut solo single This Town, which scored the Irish lad his first ever Top Ten solo single in late 2016.\n\nHe is yet to announce his debut album, but This Town brings together Niall's influences perfectly. He names The Eagles, Bon Jovi and The Script among his favourite artists, so we're expecting some epic moments when he finally blesses us with a full album.\n\nHe's a big fan of swing music but he should probably leave that to Michael Buble and stick to his love of rock music.\n\nRumours suggest Niall is working with writer and producer Greg Kurstin, who is responsible for huge songs by Adele, Years & Years, Sia, Taylor Swift and many more A-list artists.\n\nZayn is already a certified solo star. The first out of the gates, Zayn took the brave move of quitting 1D at the peak of the boyband's success. There were tears at first, but they were long dry by the time he released chart topping single Pillowtalk and debut album Mind Of Mine.\n\nThe 23-year-old star is now making big-name friends in the music industry, having teamed up with Snakehips on their new hit Cruel and M.I.A on her tune Freedun.\n\nHe is the first ever UK male artist to enter the albums at No.1 in the UK and US with his debut album. Not a bad start to a solo career.\n\nLong before One Direction went on hiatus and Zayn dropped his debut album, there were rumours Harry Styles was planning to quit the band and release a solo album. Well, we're still waiting and, as excited as we are about his role in new wartime movie Dunkirk, it's the album we're waiting for.\n\nHarry is believed to have signed a three-album deal with Columbia Records (part of Sony) and while we're yet to hear so much as a note from that golden voice, we have already heard his work for other artists. He has penned songs for Ariana Grande, Alex & Sierra, Gavin DeGraw and Michael Buble while working on music for his own album.\n\nThere's no date for when we can expect to hear Harry's solo music because life is just awful like that sometimes."
