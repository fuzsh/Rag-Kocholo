It gives you the option to spend money but in reality you really donât have to progress far in the game, which I like. Additionally, you can subscribe to the diamond membership which I really donât think it that worth it, but if you do, you get a free 3 day trial and it even gives you the option to unsubscribe though the app which I think is the best PtE out there. A lot of other apps donât actually tell you how to unsubscribe to things and I love how this game lets you know. You get a free car out of it as well which is a lot more than other games give you. While Iâm sure it will eventually get boring as all games do, itâs a good time filler if you really have nothing better to do. Iâm also a big fan of Wiz which may make this post biased but I think itâs the best farming game out there atm. Happy blazing!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review!

I try to be active with turning on the lamp every four hours and playing the music every now and then, but it doesnât seem to help. I spend the coins for watering and upgrading in hopes that itâll increase the intake, but Iâm not even putting a dent in it. Thereâs not much more going on outside that which makes the game simply a âin and outâ process. I go in, collect the coins and leave. Maybe you should implement side games to earn prices instead of making people watch these videos that force stop the game. And whatâs the real purpose of the cash after we harvest. I would rather use the cash towards up grades or opening plots early. At this point I became bored with the game since week two and have decided to delete it. You should look into similar games and see where you all could make room for improvements. Graphics are nice but I wish we could see more of Wiz, like on some come completing missions type stuff. Or just seeing some of anybody would be great. Put some workers in there or something.\n\nStMaNNS ,\n\nDonât play this app\n\nIâve been playing for a little over 6 months know and all of a sudden I wasnât allowed to play in the tournaments. I wrote to apps support and they told me I was flagged for cheating from their filter system. I wrote them back saying I definitely wasnât cheating. I wonât even know how to. They wrote me back saying how did I spend 155k gems without making a purchase. It then being obvious to me that do to the fact of me constantly playing the game and crate challenges is how I did achieve that many gems but to them the fact that I could with out a purchase wasnât good for them. So I explained Iâm a obsessed game player and challenges in a short period of time is what Iâm good at. And also gave them a chance to look over my gameplay and monitor it. So they said that they got the ok to restore my tournament play. It wasnât even 2 whole days when I was almost to the top position of the tournament and it kicked me again. I wrote them thinking they never restored me back in completely again and they wrote back saying I was flagged again by the filter system. So basically if you play a lot and win with out spending your cash then you are going to get flagged. What bull$h/t! Wiz thatâs garbage\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nSorry you can no longer access Tournaments! We are currently looking into this issue to make sure everything is working correctly.
