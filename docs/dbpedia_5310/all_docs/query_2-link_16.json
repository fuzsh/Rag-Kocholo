But that doesn’t mean the rapper is completely out of the music business. He co-founded Taylor Gang Entertainment with his longtime manager and friend, Will Dzombak, and the label is home to successful artists like Ty Dolla $ign. As Khalifa told Forbes back in 2017, it was important for him to keep his hands in the music business despite diversifying his other businesses.\n\n“At the end of the day, everything I do business-wise is part of my real-life anyway,” he said. “I still wanna create, and I still have tons of ideas. I’m a musical person so my words are my gift. Finding ways to get better is really the exciting part.”\n\nRegardless, Wiz Khalifa made the vast bulk of his net worth in businesses outside of music. According to Celebrity Net Worth, his $60 million war chest really started building in 2014, when he stopped paying for marijuana and instead began lining up endorsements with some of the biggest cannabis brands in the world. His partnership with The Cookie Company has resulted in his own strain of weed — the Khalifa Kush (KK) — and other deals in the same vein.\n\nLet’s take a look at the green business that put more green in Wiz Khalifa’s pocket.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CTGO0zMlR3D/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nBernadette Giacomazzo\n\nBernadette Giacomazzo is the SEO Manager at Blavity, Inc.
