        "text": "Juicy J might have had a scary health issue the past month, but that isn’t stopping the rapper-producer from providing for his fans. The Juice man just dropped the music video for his “For Everybody” track which features Wiz Khalifa and R. City.\n\nIn this track, Juicy raps about a girl who’s made it a habit to be sleeping with several rappers. In my opinion, Juicy J made little rendition of his own extended version of the good ol’ “From what I heard she got a baby by Busta/My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher” line and let me just say, I’m digging it.\n\nSee the new visuals from Juicy J above and stay tuned for his sophomore album The Hustle Continue, which is set to drop later this year. – Lupe Looove"
