        "text": "Over the past few decades, rappers have teamed up with artists from other genres. They've gone out of their comfort zones to show how they can create magic, even with unlikely pairings.\n\nSome of hip-hop's best collaborations have came about when rappers banded with some of the era's biggest pop stars. Let's take a look at some of the best songs in which hip-hop and pop have merged.\n\n1 of 20\n\n“Dirrty” by Christina Aguilera feat. Redman\n\nAaron J. Thornton/WireImage\n\nIn the early 2000s, Christina Aguilera was establishing herself as a rising pop princess. However, many people criticized her album Stripped because the themes were totally different from her debut. She teamed up with Redman on the album’s lead single “Dirrty,” that showcased how Aguilera can elevate her sound and a more sexual image. Despite the mixed reviews, “Dirrty” is still a fan favorite.\n\n2 of 20\n\n“Promiscuous” by Nelly Furtado feat. Timbaland\n\nKevin Mazur/AMA2009/WireImage\n\nIn 2006, Nelly Furtado teamed up with producer Timbaland on the bulk of her third album Loose. On the hit single “Promiscuous,” Furtado and Timbaland trade verses in the form of a conversation between two people that are interested in each other.\n\n3 of 20\n\n“Suit & Tie” by Justin Timberlake feat. Jay Z\n\nStephen Lovekin/Getty Images for M2M Construction\n\nOnce Justin Timberlake decided to embark on a solo career, he developed a relationship with superproducer Timbaland. When Timberlake released his third solo album The 20/20 Experience, he naturally called on Timbaland to help craft the project. He teamed up with Jay-Z on the album’s lead single “Suit & Tie,” a track that highlights the intricacies of being well-dressed.\n\n4 of 20\n\n“The Monster” by Eminem feat. Rihanna\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images for MTV\n\n“The Monster” became the second collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna, just three years after releasing “Love The Way You Lie.” On the track, Eminem wrestles with another side to his persona, the side that listens to other voices in his head, and he reflects on dealing with the monster side of fame.\n\n5 of 20\n\n“See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nMany fans of the Fast & Furious movie franchise fell in love with lead actor Paul Walker, and were left distraught after his passing in a tragic car accident. Furious 7 was the last movie that featured Walker in the franchise, so it was only right to have a song as a proper tribute. Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth teamed up on the soundtrack’s hit single “See You Again.” On the track, they highlight how people deal with grief and hope for better days.\n\n6 of 20\n\n“Let Me Blow Ya Mind” by Eve feat. Gwen Stefani\n\nM. Caulfield/WireImage for The Recording Academy\n\nFor the longtime Eve fans, a collaboration with No Doubt frontwoman Gwen Stefani may not seem like it would have worked. It's two genres and completely different styles, but with production from Dr. Dre and Scott Storch, “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” became one of the biggest collaborations of 2001.\n\n7 of 20\n\n“California Gurls” by Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nKaty Perry and Snoop Dogg released an elite West Coast anthem with the 2010 single “California Gurls.” On the track, Perry and Snoop detail how women hailing from the Golden State are the best in the land, and no other women compare. As Perry sings on the hook, “California girls, we’re unforgettable / Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top / Sun-kissed skin so hot, we’ll melt your popsicle.”\n\n8 of 20\n\n“Don’t Cha” by The Pųssycat Dolls feat. Busta Rhymes\n\nNicky Johnston/Comic Relief/Getty Images\n\nIn 2005, girl group the Pųssycat Dolls released their debut album PCD. CeeLo Green wrote and produced the album’s lead track “Don’t Cha.” Joined by Busta Rhymes, the song finds the group taunting a guy as they compare their hotness to the not-so-hotness of the guy's girlfriend. The smash hit peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n9 of 20\n\n“Heard ‘Em Say” by Kanye West feat. Adam Levine\n\nScott Gries/Getty Images\n\nIn 2005, Kanye West released his critically-acclaimed sophomore album Late Registration to rave reviews. He teamed up with Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine on the album’s third single “Heard ‘Em Say.” On the track, West details the socioeconomic issues that people face, while also encouraging them to remain as present as possible.\n\n10 of 20\n\n“Chillin” by Wale feat. Lady Gaga\n\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\n\nIn Wale’s early music days, he was releasing mixtapes and touring with the likes of Mark Ronson. Signing to Ronson’s record label imprint Allido, he released his debut album Attention Deficit. He teamed up with Lady Gaga on the album’s lead single “Chillin.” Produced by Cool & Dre, the song features a sample of the 1969 Steam single “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.”\n\n11 of 20\n\n“Glamorous” by Fergie feat. Ludacris\n\nAl Messerschmidt/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to her work with the Black Eyed Peas, Fergie wanted to break away with a solo career. She did just that in 2006 when she released her debut album The Dutchess. She teamed up with producer Polow Da Don and rapper Ludacris on her hit single “Glamorous.” On the track, Fergie details living a life of luxury, from her first-class travels, to her fashions and jewelry.\n\n12 of 20\n\n“Got ‘Til It’s Gone” by Janet Jackson feat. Q-Tip\n\nAlexander Tamargo/Getty Images\n\nOn Janet Jackson's 1997 single \"Got 'Til It's Gone,\" she mixes pop and neo-soul with hip-hop. Sampling the Joni Mitchell track \"Big Yellow Taxi,\" and adding a verse from A Tribe Called Quest member Q-Tip, the song makes for a perfect message about appreciating what one has and not taking things for granted.\n\n13 of 20\n\n“I’m Real (remix)” by Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for Global Citizen\n\nIn the early 2000s, Jennifer Lopez was establishing herself as a pop star, in addition to her acting career. Her sophomore album J. Lo brought her hit collaboration alongside Ja Rule, \"I'm Real (remix).\" On the track, they detail how some people want to keep their relationship status private, while still staying true to their partners.\n\n14 of 20\n\n“Baby” by Justin Bieber feat. Ludacris\n\nLarry Marano/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, Justin Bieber was praised as be the next big thing in pop music when he released his debut album My World 2.0. The-Dream and Tricky Stewart produced Bieber’s lead single “Baby.” With assistance from rapper Ludacris, the song details how one is dealing with a breakup, but still longs to rekindle the relationship.\n\n15 of 20\n\n“FourFiveSeconds” by Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney\n\nLarry Busacca/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nRihanna and Kanye West have collaborated several times throughout their careers, but an unlikely collaboration came in 2005 when they teamed up with Paul McCartney. On the track “FourFiveSeconds,” Rihanna and West handle vocals, while McCartney takes on the acoustic guitar. While the production gives more of a laidback feel, the lyrics detail how people can be triggered if people try their patience and emotions.\n\n16 of 20\n\n“SexyBack” by Justin Timberlake feat. Timbaland\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images for Songwriters Hall Of Fame\n\nIn 2006, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland put the world on notice with the hit single “SexyBack.” One thing about Timbaland, he’s always going to make a production that doesn’t sound like any other producer. Not only does “SexyBack” bring pop and hip-hop to the forefront, but he also meshes dance and a little bit of disco to it.\n\n17 of 20\n\n“Dark Horse” by Katy Perry feat. Juicy J\n\nKevin Winter/MTV1415/Getty Images for MTV\n\nIn 2013, Katy Perry released her fourth album Prism. She teamed up with rapper Juicy J on their hit single “Dark Horse.” On the track, Perry details how a man is falling for her, but she warns him to be careful because she may have some spells up her sleeve.\n\n18 of 20\n\n“Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira feat. Wyclef Jean\n\nROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 2006, Shakira and Wyclef Jean had fans running to the dance floor with their infectious hit “Hips Don’t Lie.” Shakira has always been a master at belly dancing, and this was a perfect song for fans to show off their best moves. On the track, Shakira details how her moves can be so captivating to anyone watching.\n\n19 of 20\n\n“Airplanes” by B.o.B feat. Hayley Williams\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage for Clear Channel\n\nIn 2010, rapper B.o.B released his debut album B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray. He teamed up with Paramore’s frontwoman Hayley Williams on the third single “Airplanes.” On the track, B.o.B finds himself reminiscing about life being so much simpler before the fame and fortune. As Hayley sings on the hook, “Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? / I could really use a wish right now,” which plays into B.o.B wishing he could go back to his previous life.\n\n20 of 20\n\n“Havana” by Camila Cabello feat. Young Thug\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nIn 2017, former Fifth Harmony member Camila Cabello released her solo debut single “Havana.” Teaming up with rapper Young Thug, Cabello uses the song to detail the feelings she has for a partner, while also paying homage to her hometown.\n\nMya Singleton is a freelance music journalist and social strategist based in the Bay Area, with experience covering R&B and hip-hop.
