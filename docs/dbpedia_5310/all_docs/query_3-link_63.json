        "text": "In recognition of hip hop’s 50th anniversary, BET Digital, in partnership with Ambrosia For Heads, is celebrating the culture by hosting a bracket-style competition that allows you to determine hip hop’s greatest crew.\n\nRather than having “experts” tell you who is the greatest of all time, this is your opportunity to collectively make that decision. After giving the opportunity to any and all fans to provide feedback on which crews should be included, 32 collectives from different regions, styles, and generations have been selected—all vying for that #1 spot. When the final battle is over and the last vote is cast, you will have determined who is your Greatest Rap Crew of All Time.\n\nRELATED: Who’s The G.O.A.T. Rap Crew? GOOD Music vs Shady | Round 2\n\nIn this celebration of hip hop and all of its talented crews, your vote decides the winner, so vote below.\n\nG.O.O.D. Music vs Hypnotize Minds | Round 3\n\nThis matchup will send one winner to represent Midwest regional supremacy among the four finalists. In the early 1990s, Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat, and others formed the Hypnotize Minds camp. This crew of Memphis artists would eventually make hits, earn plaques, and win a series of awards, including an Oscar.\n\nA decade or so later, Kanye West launched a crew of friends that eventually expanded to attract industry veterans and incubate future stars. G.O.O.D. Music made great music and brought their chemistry to collaborations and compilations. These two crews worked together. Kanye West appeared on the reissue of Three 6 Mafia’s “Most Known Unknown,” a decade before teaming with Juicy J for “Ballin.’” Among many songs together, Juicy and 2 Chainz made a 2013 hit collaboration in “Bandz A Make Her Dance.” G.O.O.D. Music defeated the St. Lunatics in Round 1 and surpassed Shady in Round 2, while Hypnotize Minds bested Yo Gotti’s CMG in a Memphis showdown for Round 1 and stepped by Soulquarians in Round 2. Only one squad can advance to represent the Midwest as the tournament becomes four contenders.\n\nG.O.O.D. Music\n\n(Defeated the St. Lunatics in Round 1 and defeated Shady in Round 2)\n\nKanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music crew shared a combined goal of Getting Out Our Dreams, and did just that. In addition to being a record label that has supplied albums by Big Sean, Pusha-T, Kid Cudi, Common, Consequence, and others, the crew includes talented acts from around the country, including 2 Chainz, CyHi The Prynce, Yasiin Bey (pka Mos Def), Desiigner, and more.\n\nAt the center of the action is a superstar producer/artist who has utilized the creative ensemble for nearly 20 years. From early rallying cries like “Grammy Family” to the six-times-platinum “Mercy” and “Don’t Like,” G.O.O.D. thrives off of crew energy. 2012’s “Cruel Summer” repped the brand in grand fashion. Through crew association and West’s oversight of albums, G.O.O.D. added new chapters to veterans Common and Pusha’s careers with Grammy-nominated albums in “Be” and “Daytona,” respectively.\n\nThe crew mentored would-be stars in Big Sean and Kid Cudi and regularly integrated them into collaborative work with the vets. West has co-produced several of Sean’s biggest hits, while Common narrated and guested on Cudi’s acclaimed debut. The crew members were integral to 2018’s summertime run of Kanye-produced projects recorded on retreat in Wyoming, including Pusha-T and a Kids See Ghosts collaboration between ‘Ye and Cudi. Though the cast has rotated periodically, through the years, G.O.O.D. artists have come together to achieve greatness.\n\nHypnotize Minds\n\n(Defeated CMG in Round 1 and defeated Soulquarians in Round 2)\n\nThe Hypnotize Minds crew harnessed the magic of underground albums in the 1990s and used that same formula to win Oscars and earn a hallway full of plaques. Three 6 Mafia, a rapping and producing conglomerate including Juicy J, DJ Paul, Gangsta Boo, Crunchy Black, Lord Infamous, and Koopsta Knicca, extend beyond their collective to involve Juicy’s brother Project Pat, Lil Wyte, La Chat, and others. Across the board, the energy blended soul samples with beats designed to tear da club up. Songs like Three 6’s “Sippin’ On Some Syrup and Pat’s “Chickenhead” kicked in doors with an extended crew.\n\nWith platinum and gold plaques already on hand, support increased by the mid-2000s after songs like “Stay Fly” took Three 6 to new heights, as the soundtrack song “It’s Hard Out Here For A P*mp” earned the group an Academy Award.\n\nThe mainstream began to embrace an unapologetic and street-rooted sound. Juicy’s influence would soar through a new generation of artists, ranging from Wiz Khalifa to Katy Perry. At the same time, Hypnotize Minds fed core fans with projects by Gangsta Boo and La Chat together as well as Da Mafia 6ix—an amended version of the original Three 6 Mafia. Even after the passing of Infamous, Koopsta, and Gangsta Boo, Hypnotize Minds' music remains active and keeps fans entranced.\n\nEDITOR's NOTE: Register for the sweepstakes for a chance to win the grand prize of (2) two tickets to the 2023 BET Awards, (2) two round-trip airline tickets, and a 2-night hotel stay on June 25. Up your chances to win by voting weekly.\n\nNO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. VOID OUTSIDE OF THE 50 U.S. & D.C. AND WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW. Open to legal residents of the 50 U.S. & D.C. who are 18 years of age or older at the time of entry. Ends at 12:00 p.m. ET on June 9, 2023. Official Rules: bet.com/grcoat-official-rules.
