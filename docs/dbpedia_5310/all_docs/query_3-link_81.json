        "text": "DJ Holiday, also known as Robert Avery, was born in Germany and raised in Decatur, GA. Before establishing his party promotion company in 2006 titled “Plush Blue Entertainment,” Holiday spent years Dj’ing for parties and making a name for himself in Atlanta. It was not long before Holiday caught the attention of DJ Drama, which would later turn into Holiday joining Drama’s team known as the “ Aphillates Music Group.” Soon after his recruitment, Holiday began the popular mixtape series “Holiday Season,” which would later help open the doors for many of the upcoming artists in the South during that time. Throughout his career, XXL, Hip Hop Weekly, and Ozone Magazine have rewarded Holiday for his incomparable skill and work ethic as an American DJ. MTV even gave Holiday an award for the best breakthrough DJ of the Year in 2010. Below is a list of artists that DJ Holiday has helped push and support throughout his career.\n\nGucci Mane\n\nDJ Holiday and Gucci Mane probably have had the longest working relationship out of any of the artist on this list. Likewise, DJ Holiday met many of the artists on this list due to his connection to Gucci Mane. Back when Dj Holiday released the first project under the “Holiday Season” series in 2008, it featured songs by Gucci Mane, Rocko, Young Jeezy, and T.I. DJ Holiday would continue pushing songs for Gucci, and even hosted many of his mixtapes like Jewelry Selection, Buy My Album, Writing On The Wall 2, I'm Up, and Trap Back.\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nNow here’s an artist that many people seem to forget about when referring to DJ Holiday’s impressive resume. There is no denying Nicki Minaj’s prominent talent. However, it was no other than Gucci Mane and DJ Holiday who first helped Nicki get her records played throughout the city of Atlanta. Nicki Minaj’s, Beam Me Up Scotty, was not only her breakthrough mixtape, but it also included features by Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, and Drake. Just for the record, it was the one and only DJ Holiday and The Trapaholics who hosted that very same project for Nicki before she signed with Young Money Records.\n\nFrench Montana"
