        "text": "Are you planning on dropping another mixtape before the album?\n\nI’m working on a bunch of material. Some of it, I’m just going to throw out there for free. I’m doing a bunch of collabos and features at the moment. Maybe a mixtape. I’m looking at the album coming out in March or April of next year. I can’t give you the title yet but you know what to expect from me.\n\nWhat has been your favorite collabo thus far?\n\nDefinitely, it was working with Juicy J and Snoop. I did something with the Doggfather for his album. But people don’t know I’m a huge Juicy J fan, I grew up on Three 6 Mafia. I look at them the same way I look at Snoop. We actually got another record that we haven’t released yet.\n\nYou and Snoop are a-likes. How big of an influence has he been on your music?\n\nHearing Doggystyle for the first time was really important. I was living in Georgia at the time with my Mom. I was too young to even be listening to it but she had a ghetto homegirl who used to blast it in her truck when she would give me rides. I remember it sounded so bad like people getting their heads cut off and the blood squirting out. [laughs] That’s just the vision it gave me. But I was so into it. My favorite song now is probably “G’z Up, Hoes Down”. But back then you know “Gin & Juice” was like the single of the decade.\n\nYou have a big single of your own climbing up the charts with ‘Black & Yellow’, there have been rumors that the Steelers reached out to use it at games. True?\n\nYea, they are. I haven’t been talking to them personally but it would only be right. They’ve been talking to my management about it for sure.\n\nIt’s probably your most successful song to date. But, really it sounds more like one of the joints that you just had fun with.\n\nYea, that’s vibe, man. When we were done with it, the producers Stargate were really happy with it. And from they’re reputation alone, it made me think twice about it. I took it to the label and everybody was clapping by the end of the meeting. People can’t box my sound in anymore.\n\nHow do you feel about the whole ‘weed rap’ labeling?\n\nIt’s cool because people are always going to label you as something. And before this year, it really wasn’t that genre of “stoner rap” at the forefront or whatever, but I’ll just use it as motivation to build on and change people’s opinions of me. Even with whatever people want to label me with, there are so many other sides to me."
