        "text": "Wiz Khalifa is continuing to build his brand.\n\nSlowly but surely, the rapper's Taylor Gang team is expanding. Earlier this month, he brought Lola Monroe on board, and now veteran rapper Juicy J has joined the squad.\n\n“We been talking about it and it just went down,” Juicy tells xxlmag.com. “They like brothers to me. It’s a blessing. I’ve been doing this over twenty years [and for] people to still recognize my music and appreciate my music, it’s a blessing.”\n\nJuicy J says that both he and Wiz are already hard at work.\n\n“Wiz got a new album coming out next year,\" he shares. \"It’s crazy. He’s got over 40 songs done. He’s still recording. And he’s got a compilation album he’s gonna put out featuring all of his artists.” According to the Memphis native, as of now, those other artists are Chevy Woods, Lola Monroe, Neako and possibly others.\n\nWiz and Juicy first collaborated on the track “In My Car,” and later got together for the remix to “Black and Yellow,” as well as “Erreeday,” off of the Pittsburgh MC’s Cabin Fever mixtape.\n\nYesterday (November 28), another track featuring the newly-aligned rhymers, “Stoner’s Night 2,” hit the ‘net. It’s off of Juicy’s new mixtape, Blue Dream & Lean (Download here). Juicy described the release as “Old school shit with a new school swag. You gonna be like, 'Oh shit! This nigga is jammin’!”\n\n“I got a Trippy Mane movie I got coming out,\" he said. \"That’s definitely in the works. Get ready for that. It’s a comedy but it’s gonna be trippy.”\n\nIn addition, next month, be on the lookout for the Cocaine Mafia mixtape from Juicy, French Montana, Project Pat and DJ Paul. —Adam Fleischer"
