        "text": "Wiz Khalifa's song \"You (feat. Juicy J & Liam Payne)\" is a contemporary love anthem that delves into themes of modern relationships, social media influence, and the luxurious lifestyle. The song opens with a nod to the digital age, specifically addressing women who are active on Snapchat, highlighting the pervasive role of social media in today's romantic interactions. This sets the stage for a narrative that intertwines digital connectivity with personal relationships.\n\nThe lyrics emphasize a deep, almost obsessive focus on a significant other, with repeated lines like \"All I need is you\" and \"All I see is you.\" This repetition underscores the central theme of devotion and exclusivity in the relationship. The song also touches on the idea of loyalty and trust, as seen in lines like \"If I told you tote that strap, you'll pop a lick,\" suggesting a partner who is not only loyal but also willing to go to great lengths for their significant other. This portrayal of a ride-or-die partner is a common trope in hip-hop, symbolizing ultimate loyalty and commitment.\n\nAdditionally, the song is rich with references to luxury and indulgence, from mentions of designer brands like Vickys (Victoria's Secret) to high-end alcohol like Bombay. These elements paint a picture of a lavish lifestyle that complements the intense romantic focus. The repeated phrase \"Shawty want to smoke me out\" further adds to the hedonistic vibe, suggesting a relationship that thrives on shared pleasures and mutual indulgence. Overall, the song captures the essence of a modern, passionate relationship set against a backdrop of social media and luxury."
