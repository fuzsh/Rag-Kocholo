        "text": "Juicy J's forthcoming Highly Intoxicated mixtape is giving plenty of hip-hop newcomers some shine and the latest artists to join the fold are $uicideboy$.\n\nThe Three 6 Mafia member has been giving fans an advanced listen of what's to come from the tape via snippets on Snapchat. Most recently, he shared a sampling of what $lick and Ruby Da Cherry have to offer. \"Highly Intoxicated mixtape prod by $uicideboy$,\" Juicy J wrote as the caption for a video featuring a beat perfect for him to flex on.\n\n$uicideboy$ join producers TM88 and Southside, among others, who are contributing sounds to the project, which doesn't have a release date yet.\n\nXXXTentacion, Cardi B and Smokepurpp are among the newer artists that join Ruby Da Cherry and $lick on the tape. Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky and Wiz Khalifa are also set to appear.\n\nThe $uicideboy$ seem to have something of their own in the works with Juicy J too. $lick recently posted an Instagram photo of himself and the rap veteran in the studio. \"JUICEMANE GAVE US THE BLESSING. WELCOME BACK TO HELL VOLUME 666 COMING SOON. BRINGING BACK THE '93-94,\" he wrote as the caption.\n\nThis month, the New Orleans pair plan to drop five EPs. They'll continue their Kill Yourself series, featuring parts 16-20, which drops Sept. 11.\n\nEarlier this year, Ruby and $lick spoke with XXL about their influences for The Break. Not surprisingly, the duo named Three 6 Mafia as one of their earliest entries into rap. \"I was always into rap. I got introduced to Three 6 Mafia when I was 8 when I was riding with my uncle,\" $lick shared. \"He played U.N.L.V.’s ‘Drag Em ‘N the River,’ Three 6 Mafia’s ‘Slob on My Knob’ and ‘Tear da Club Up’ and after I heard that I got obsessed. And besides that it was Cash Money, No Limit, you know the hometown heroes. Then when the Waka Flocka Flame age came in I got obsessed with that and Gucci too.”\n\nCheck out a preview of the Juicy J and $uicideboy$ collab below."
