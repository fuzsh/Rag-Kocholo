As a follow-up to âRolling Papers,â Khalifa released âO.N.I.F.C.â in 2012. This album featured the tracks âWork Hard, Play Hardâ and âRemember You,â featuring The Weeknd. His third studio album, âBlacc Hollywood,â was released in 2014 and âdebuted at #1 on Billboardâs Top 200 album chart and included hit single âWe DemBoyz.â Soon after, Khalifaâs âSee You Again,â off of the âFurious 7â soundtrack, catapulted to the top of the charts in 95 countries. Holding the #1 spot for 12 consecutive weeks, âSee You Againâ broke records by being Spotifyâs most-streamed track in a single day in the United States and in a single week in 26 countries. In addition to winning three TEEN CHOICE Awards in 2015, âSee You Againâ continued its success by winning a Critics Choice Award in the Best Song category; two Billboard Music Awards in the categories Top Hot 100 Song and Top Rap Song; earning three Grammy Award nominations in the categories Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media; and a Golden Globe Award nomination in the category Best Original Song â Motion Picture.\n\nIn February 2016, the album âKhalifaâ was released, which included the tracks âBake Sale,â featuring Travis Scott, and âElevated.â In June of the same year, Khalifa collaborated with Juicy J and TM88 to debut âTGOD Mafia Presents: Rude Awakening,â and co-headlined The High Road Summer Tour with Snoop Dogg.
