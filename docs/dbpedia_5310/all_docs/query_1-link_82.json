        "text": "Wiz Khalifa‘s new album, Blacc Hollywood, has been teased since he put out the video for “Old Chanel” last year, but once “We Dem Boyz”–one of the bigger rap records of the year–impacted, it was pretty plain to see that Wiz had a master plan to make sure that his third album was a big one. Now, after performing at Summer Jam, and releasing a 28-track mixtape, aptly titled 28 Grams, just a few weeks ago, he’s ready to push forward with his second single, which features, Juicy J & Project Pat-uh, who join Khalifa Man on his latest record.\n\n“KK” will be featured on Blacc Hollywood, which is hitting later this summer."
