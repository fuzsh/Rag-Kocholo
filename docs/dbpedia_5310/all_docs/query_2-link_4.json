        "text": "Wiz Khalifa is going to be a girl dad. The Taylor Gang honcho and his girlfriend Aimee Aguilar announced that the couple is expecting their first child together.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native teamed up with Clear Blue to make it official on Father’s Day (June 16) with an Instagram post revealing that they have a baby girl on the way.\n\nKhalifa shared a photo alongside Aguilar holding a Clear Blue pregnancy test while Aimee posted photos showing off her growing baby bump from her maternity shoot.\n\nWiz and Aguilar received plenty of love in their comment section following the announcement, but didn’t reveal a due date for the baby.\n\nThe “Roll Up” rapper’s ex Amber Rose, with whom he shares 11-year-old son Sebastian together, made sure to congratulate the couple on their bundle of joy.\n\n“We love you guys so much and we can’t wait to meet her,” Rose wrote in a repost to her Instagram Story. Amber also left a comment under Aguilar’s photo shoot. “Gorgeous mama,” she gushed.\n\nLudacris, Warren G, Kevin Hart and more also made sure to show some love to the 36-year-old. “Welcome To Da Girl Dad Club,” the “Stand Up” rapper wrote.\n\nComedian-rapper Lil Duval hilariously chimed in: “If i have a baby im getting a pregnancy test deal too!”\n\nIt’s unclear when Khalifa and Aguilar started dating, but the couple was spotted together going back to 2019. On the music side, Wiz has been taking it easy in 2024 after unloading four different solo projects in 2023.\n\nCheck out the photo announcements from Wiz Khalifa and Aimee Aguilar below."
