        "text": "New Album From Rap Superstar Sits Atop Billboard’s “Top Rap Albums” & “Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums” Charts & Debuts At #2 On The “Top 200 Albums” Chart;\n\nAcclaimed MC Receives Two Grammy Nominations At The 55th Annual Grammy Awards;\n\nToday Named “Wiz Khalifa Day” In Pittsburgh, PA;\n\n“O.N.I.F.C.” Available Everywhere Now\n\n“O.N.I.F.C.,” the highly-anticipated sophomore album from Rostrum/Atlantic recording artist Wiz Khalifa, has debuted at #2 on the Billboard “Top 200 Albums” chart. With sales exceeding 141,000 units, the album is also sitting at #1 on Billboard’s “Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums” and “Top Rap Albums” charts. The album also spent the week atop of iTunes’ “Overall Albums” and “Top Hip-Hop/Rap Albums” charts. Wiz celebrated the release of “O.N.I.F.C.” with an appearance on yesterday’s episode of The Wendy Williams Show (check local listings).\n\nAdding to what was already an exciting week, Wiz received two nominations for this year’s Grammy Awards. Khalifa received nominations for “Best Rap Song” for his collaboration with Snoop Dogg, “Young, Wild & Free” featuring Bruno Mars, from the soundtrack to their film “MAC AND DEVIN GO TO HIGH SCHOOL,” and “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” for his collaboration with Maroon 5 on their hit single, “Payphone.” The 55th Annual Grammy Awards will be announced live on Sunday, February 10, 2013 from the Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA on CBS (check local listings). These new nominations add to the two Wiz received last year for his breakout hit “Black And Yellow.”\n\nIf all this weren’t enough, Wiz was recently recognized by the Pittsburgh City Council, proclaiming that Wednesday, December 12th be named “Wiz Khalifa Day.” Of the honor, Wiz said, “It means a lot to me, being a kid from Pittsburgh and riding the buses and going to school out here and just loving Pittsburgh so much.”\n\nKhalifa is currently taking flight throughout North America on the “2050 Tour,” which includes Taylor Gang members Juicy J, Chevy Woods, Lola Monroe, Tuki Carter and Berner. The nationwide tour kicked off at the Bryce Jordan Center in State College, PA on October 12, and wraps up today in the rapper’s hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nWiz has made several high profile appearances in advance of “O.N.I.F.C.,” including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Larry King Now, while gracing the covers of the October/November issues of both Complex, XXL, the latter alongside fiancé Amber Rose. In May, Khalifa was joined by Taylor Gang members Juicy J, Chevy Woods and Lola Monroe on the cover of The Source.\n\nWiz also celebrated the release of “O.N.I.F.C.” with a special 30 minute performance on BET’s 106th & Park. What’s more, Wiz describes everything that went into the making of “O.N.I.F.C.” for MTV’s “Road To Release,” which ran on MTV.com leading up to the release of the album last week.\n\nWiz continues to have an undeniable online presence, with over 8 million fans following him on Twitter, over 18 million likes on Facebook and over 1 million followers on Instagram. In addition to this, Wiz’s music videos have been a success on the Internet with nearly 500 million total views on YouTube.\n\n# # #\n\n“O.N.I.F.C.” is the follow-up to Wiz Khalifa’s gold-certified major label debut, “ROLLING PAPERS,” which was released in March 2011, and spawned the multi-platinum hits “Black and Yellow,” “Roll Up” and “No Sleep.” Wiz earned himself two nominations at the 2011 Grammy Awards thanks to his breakout hit “Black and Yellow,” in both the “Best Rap Song” and “Best Rap Performance” categories. Khalifa then joined forces with Snoop Dogg for “MAC AND DEVIN GO TO HIGH SCHOOL SOUNDTRACK,” the collaborative soundtrack album for the film “Mac and Devin Go to High School.” The album featured the hit single “Young, Wild & Free” featuring Bruno Mars, which has gone on to become 3x-certified Platinum, and a top 10 success on Billboard’s “Hot 100 Singles” chart.\n\nEarlier this year, Wiz was featured in a high-profile campaign with search engine, Bing, where he was featured in nationwide commercials. On top of this, Wiz was included as one of the artists featured in the Pepsi NFL Anthems campaign. The nationwide campaign – which also featured the likes of Ice Cube, Kelly Clarkson, Lenny Kravitz, Kid Rock and Travie McCoy – saw the rapper paired with Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker Lamar Woodley and featured a special “Steeler Nation Remix” to his multi-platinum hit single “Black And Yellow.”\n\nFor the latest news, information and tour dates, please visit www.wizkhalifa.com, www.twitter.com/RealWizKhalifa, www.facebook.com/WizKhalifa, and https://www.instagram.com/mistercap.\n\nFor press materials, visit https://press.atlanticrecords.com/WizKhalifa.\n\nWATCH WIZ’ VIDEOS BELOW:\n\n“WORK HARD, PLAY HARD” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWHNr0BrNgo\n\n“IT’S NOTHIN’” https://youtu.be/gmpuPDYeL8A\n\n“REMEMBER YOU (FEAT.
