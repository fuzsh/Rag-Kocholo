        "text": "Click HERE to purchase this album.\n\nThis album was released on June 3rd this year. I’m not expecting to like this. I’m not a fan of Wiz Khalifa. The last album of his that I listened was called Blacc Hollywood, and it’s fucking terrible. I used to enjoy his music tho. I liked a lot of the shit he did before O.N.I.F.C. I never thought he was that good of a rapper, but I was able to enjoy his music on a sonic level. I didn’t really like O.N.I.F.C. that much, but I thought it was decent. I knew something was wrong when I heard the first single to Blacc Hollywood tho. “HOL’ UP HOL’ UP HOL’ UP… WE DEM BOYZ.” That song is fucking… HAHAHA. I just went back and read my review of that song. Jesus. I used to be REALLY fucking stereotypical. That’s what prejudice does to you. I’m glad I got over that phase of my life. I’m also glad I stopped using the N word so much. I called Wiz Khalifa a “fuck nigga” in my review of that song. God. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time just to whoop my own ass. Wiz Khalifa, if you’re reading this, I sincerely apologize for calling you a “fuck nigga.” To everyone who reads my blog, I apologize for using that insult. Anyway, Wiz Khalifa has really fallen off to me. There are few rappers who have fallen off that hard. There’s a reason I completely skipped his latest solo album, Khalifa. It really feels like he smoked his whole brain away. Juicy J on the other hand is nowhere near as wack. I still don’t like him tho. I’ve never liked Juicy J. I never thought he was terrible, but his music is just so fucking generic to me. It would be alright if he had an interesting voice or delivery. He just sounds so average tho. His voice does absolutely nothing for me. People are always praising his flow, but his flow is really nothing special to me either. TM88 is pretty hit or miss with me as well. So yeah. I’m really not looking forward to this album. I’m tryin’ to review as many projects that come out this year as I can tho. Mostly because I wanna have a wide range of nominees for the BCTV Awards this year. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the official album cover for this project is fucking awful.\n\nI guess some people will probably like it, but that shit is ugly as fuck in my opinion. It’s not even poorly drawn or anything; I just really don’t like the concept. Anyway, I’m just gonna try to get this album over with as soon as possible. Every song is produced by TM88.\n\nTrack 1: TGOD Mafia Intro\n\nFuck… Alright, here we go. It’s starting now. Alright, it just ended. This intro is incredibly unnecessary. I don’t know why Juicy J had autotune on his voice. I’m not gonna rate this track tho since it’s just a pointless intro.\n\nTrack 2: Da Power\n\nI haven’t done any work in 2 days. Mostly because I don’t wanna listen to this album. It has to be done tho. Obviously I’m not gonna be judging the content too harshly. I just want to be entertained. Okay, this song is starting now. This beat is actually really dope. Juicy J is on the first verse. FUCK. I just accidentally restarted the song. The hook’s okay I guess. Alright, the first verse is starting again now. Nah. I’m bored. This is the kinda song that needs like 3 different features just to stay interesting. I’m already tired of this beat. It’s really not as dope as I thought it was 20 seconds ago. This kinda music is like fast food to me. I enjoy it when it’s first starting, but after about half a minute I lose all interest and want to hear a different song. I still listen to some of the songs from Flockaveli 1.5 tho. Flocka does this style really well. Wiz Khalifa doesn’t. He’s goin’ in on the second verse right now, and it’s absolutely terrible. This sounds like some bullshit he would “freestyle” on Sway In The Morning. His flow is wack, and his fuckin’ melodic delivery is just straight balls. I didn’t expect him to use this flow for the whole verse, but I guess he’s really doing it. Wiz Khalifa does not try anymore. When your first verse on your first song on your album sounds like this, it’s obvious that you just don’t give a fuck anymore. It sounds like he doesn’t even wanna rap anymore. What the fuck was that verse? That verse was awful. This is a Juicy J song. This is Juicy J featuring Wiz Khalifa. I should’ve put Juicy J’s name first in the title of this review… Fuck, that verse was so wack. His flow was so bad. Wiz Khalifa makes Juicy J look like Eminem on this song. This is honestly better than I thought it was gonna be, but that’s really not saying much. This is wack to me. Juicy J did a decent job I guess. I really didn’t even like his verses. It’s just that Wiz Khalifa was so bad. Anyway, this song is wack. I’m not feelin’ this bullshit. 2/5\n\nTrack 3: Medication\n\nI wonder what a song by Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J called Medication is gonna be about… This beat is alright I guess. I feel the exact same way about this song that I did about the previous track in terms of production. Juicy’s on the hook. It’s alright I guess. Do people call him Juicy for short? Or J? I think I’ll just play it safe and write out “Juicy J” each time I need to mention him. He’s on the first verse. It wasn’t good. He used the same rhyme scheme from the hook for the whole verse. Wiz is on the second verse again. His flow here is actually much better than that of Juicy J. Yeah, Wiz’s verse was way better than Juicy J’s on this song. Oh. Juicy J has another verse. This one was thankfully better than his first. His flow was actually pretty dope. Okay, so far this is turning out to be a Juicy J album that just happens to feature Wiz Khalifa on every track. Juicy’s on the hook, and he has two verses, while Wiz only has one. Juicy J was also the only artist on the intro. That’s probably a good thing for me personally. The way this song ends is pretty abrupt. It doesn’t really matter tho. It’s wack either way. Oh God. EVERY bulb in the ceiling fan in my room is out. Anyway, I’m not feelin’ this song. The beat and hook are both repetitive as fuck. The first verse from Juicy J was wack, and the other two verses were mediocre at best. I’m not feelin’ this shit. This is wack to me. 2/5\n\nTrack 4: Where Was You\n\nI think I’m really just not a fan of 808 Mafia. Obviously they have a few gems, but for the most part their shit just sounds super generic to me. I don’t even know why there are so many members of 808 Mafia. It’s not like any of them sound different. Not that I’m super familiar with every member of 808 Mafia, but even the beats on this album from just TM88 sound exactly like what I would expect from the full production team. It’s just super conventional Trap music. With all that said, this is definitely the best beat on the album so far. It’s actually kinda cool. The hook from Juicy J is alright. He’s on the first verse. Yeah, I guess Wiz just has a single verse on each song. The first verse was pretty bad. “I might leave a trail cause my swag drippin’.” I definitely wasn’t feelin’ the second verse from Wiz. Literally every bar ended with the N word. Shit was wack. So far this whole album just sounds like a bunch of throwaway tracks from Juicy J that Wiz decided to hop on real quick. This is another wack song. The beat sounded dope at first, but it gets old pretty quickly. Pretty much everything I said about the other two songs applies to this one. This is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 5: All Night\n\nHoly shit. I just found out that there are like 20 members of 808 Mafia. That’s kinda sad. It’s pretty fucked up that they need 20 members just to create that boring, generic sound. Anyway, I guess this song was supposed to be the big single for this album. I’ve never heard it, but I never listen to the radio, so I don’t really have any idea of how successful it was. I couldn’t find a music video for this song, so I’m assuming they just didn’t make one. I didn’t know I if I should check Wiz Khalifa’s Vevo page or Juicy J’s. It doesn’t matter tho. It’s starting now. This hook is very underwhelming. This beat is actually pretty dope. Well, it’s not. I like it’s fast pace tho. Wiz only has one verse again. The whole song just ended. I’m so fucking bored right now. Do I even have to say anything else about this song? I know I haven’t said much, but there’s really not much else that I CAN say. I don’t feel any different about this track than I did about the other ones. It’s another bad song. Nothing stands out about it aside from the faster pace. The fast pace doesn’t really add much tho. I’m not feelin’ this shit. This is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 6: I See It I Want It\n\nWhy did I decide to review this album? The readers of this website don’t give a shit about Wiz Khalifa. I doubt they care about Juicy J either. I guess it’s a good thing that I haven’t heard any absolutely horrible songs yet. Okay, this song is starting now. I’m not feelin’ this beat. As soon as it drops you hear that same fuckin’… I don’t even know how to describe it… It’s this sound effect that damn near every Trap music producer uses. I know I’ve talked about it before. I can’t remember how I said it… Oh yeah. It’s kind of a high pitched squeak noise. You hear it in like every other 808 Mafia beat. If you still don’t know what I’m talking about, go to YouTube and look up a song called Really by The Game. Great song by the way. I highly recommend listening to the whole song because The Game fucking ripped his verse to shreds. I think I told y’all to listen to this song the first time I was talking about this. Just wait until the beat drops. Every other time the snare hits, you can hear the high pitched squeak that I’m talking about. I’m so tired of that sound effect. I swear it’s in every other Trap beat. Anyway, the hook from Juicy J is very underwhelming. The song just ended. Remember what I said about the other songs on this album? Pretend I said it again. That’s the review for this song. It’s wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 7: Hit Me Up\n\nWell, I can’t say that this album isn’t consistent so far. It’s just consistently bad. What the fuck… I feel like I’ve been listening to the same fucking song over and over again. This is so bad. I might have to start ducking points just because this shit is all so similar. This is the most generic album I’ve heard in a long ass time. This is so bad. I’m so bored. This is so bad. FUUUCK. Nah. That’s it. I’m getting pissed off. I’m so tired of listening to this fucking wack ass music. I can’t even say that this song is any worse than the other tracks. When you see my “favorite song” from this album, please take it with a grain of salt because pretty much everything on this album sounds exactly the same to me. This shit is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 8: Green Suicide\n\nJuicy J apparently has his own strain of weed coming out called Green Suicide. That doesn’t sound very appealing… Am I gonna fucking die if I smoke it? Oh my God… This sounds the fucking SAME. This fucking album should be called Groundhog Day. Did I accidentally put the first song on repeat? That would be hilarious if I actually did that, and I wrote 7 different reviews for the same track. Actually, that would be annoying as hell. Wiz has had one verse on literally every single song so far. I honestly think TM88 is the biggest problem with this album. The production is just really bad. It’s so basic. I don’t even wanna listen to this whole song. I know what to expect. The only thing that I could see one of them doing is MAYBE switching up their flow. Doing that for one verse isn’t gonna save the song tho. I’m not feelin’ this shit. This is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 9: Bossed Up\n\n“You gotta boss up, man. It’s time to stop playing around; being lazy, nigga.” It’s pretty ironic that Juicy J would say something like that on an album like this. Maybe he was trying to tell Wiz Khalifa to spit more than one verse. It didn’t work tho because nothing changed. I guess the beat actually sounds different. I might as well not even be listening to anything right now because this album is doing absolutely nothing for me. Jesus Christ. WHY DID I START THIS SHIT? I’m already passed the halfway point. I gotta keep going. I’m not feelin’ this song. Absolutely nothing stands out about this track. The beat actually sounds kinda different. It went from sounding like a generic Trap beat to a generic West Coastish sounding beat. This is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 10: She In Love\n\nAt this rate, I’ll be shocked if this album doesn’t end up getting a 40% from me. I’m not feelin’ the hook. I’m not feelin’ the beat. I have hiccups. Lyrically this whole album is “I smoke a lot of marijuana. I make a lot of money because I’m a hard working man who has lots of sex with women whom I don’t respect. Women are things.” Okay, that last sentence was kind of an exaggeration. People who’ve heard this album should understand why I said it tho. Wow. Wiz Khalifa’s verse was somehow even more disrespectful and offensive than Juicy J’s. “Bitch, you a bitch / Ricky P said you was talking that shit / How you a ho when you ain’t rich? / Need to open your mouth up and eat a dick.” I guess I was wrong when I predicted this album’s score. This song is fucking awful. The beat was actually kinda cool, but I can’t tolerate anything else about this song. 1/5\n\nTrack 11: Breaking News Feat. Project Pat\n\nThis song has another underwhelming hook. It sounds like Wiz is finally contributing something other than a tacked on verse in the middle of the song tho. What is there to say about this song that hasn’t already been said for every other song here? The production is super generic. None of the verses are good. Jesus Christ… You know, albums like this really make this website feel like work. I can’t fuck with this song. I didn’t even like Project Pat’s verse. This shit is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 12: Itself\n\nuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. No more… No more TM88… No more Juicy J… I’m so fucking tired of this album. Hold up, what the fuck did Juicy J just say? I gotta rewind this shit… “She just wanna come with me and smoke on this cookie / I think all these bitches gay and all these niggas crooked.” Juicy J… What the fuck was that? Is the “cookie” what makes it gay? I guess that’s what he meant since cookie is sometimes used as a slang term for pussy. That’s just so bad tho. That’s so bad… And why the fuck is he lumping in lesbians with “crooked niggas.” I mean, I don’t think anyone’s surprised that Juicy J doesn’t respect the LGBT community, but still. Leave the homophobia out of the music please. This beat is awful. Wiz’s verse was awful. The last verse from Juicy J is awful. I am so over this album. I can’t even say that this song was any worse than the others, but at this point I don’t really give a shit anymore. I probably overrated most of the other tracks too. This is fucking awful. 1/5\n\nTrack 13: Luxury Flow\n\nUh oh… This beat… OH MY Gawd… Are you serious? When it was first starting I thought this beat was gonna be different. It sounded really dope at first… I don’t know why it switched up as soon as Juicy J started going in. Speaking of Juicy J, apparently the “Luxury Flow” is the same flow he always uses. TM88 tricked me. This sounded like it was gonna be a dark, atmospheric beat. It almost sounded like some Travi$ Scott shit, which, in terms of production, would be a good thing. Nah. The song just ended. Nah. I’m so fucking tired of this shit. This isn’t a good song. This shit is wack. 2/5\n\nTrack 14: Stay The Same\n\nOh. My. God. I’m so fucking bored. I’m not even fucking talking about this album anymore. It’s at the point where I’m just talking about how bored I am for 4 minutes, and then I move on to the next song. This song sounds like every other Juicy J song I’ve ever heard, which could obviously be said about every other track on this album, so I kinda lost my shit when this motherfucker really had the gall to ask me “you think I work this hard to stay the same?” ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME RIGHT NOW, JUICY J? I shouldn’t be getting this mad listening to an album. That fucking laugh that Wiz Khalifa does before any of his verses is really pushing me to the limit too. I’m listening to one of the worst albums I’ve heard this year, and he’s fucking laughing. He’s laughing at me. I guess it is kinda funny. It’s funny because this is actually one of the best songs on the album. You know why? Because it’s the shortest track. Every other song, with the exception of the final track, is at least four minutes long. This song is only about two and half minutes long. It’s still bad tho. I’m so unhappy right now. 2/5\n\nTrack 15: On The Way\n\nNo. Nooooo. I can’t do this. This is my fourth day trying to work on this album. I shouldn’t be taking this long. This song… I don’t even know why I try anymore. I’ve said this so many times, but it’s so true; there’s absolutely nothing I can say that I haven’t already said before. Why am I getting so pissed off? This isn’t the emotion I want to have when I’m listening to music. Not this kind of music at least. I know I haven’t really talked much about this song in particular, but I’m just gonna move on to the final song. I need this album to be over with already. All you need to know is that this song isn’t good. 2/5\n\nTrack 16: Cell Ready\n\nI’m not feelin’ this shit… You can tell from the buildup at the beginning of the track that they wanted this to be a good finale, but I personally can’t fuck with this shit. This is the first track that actually sounds like a real collaboration tho. It actually sounds like they were in the studio together. There’s chemistry on this song. They’re tradin’ bars and everything. Every other contribution from Wiz felt like an afterthought up to this point. This album… Well, I’ll save it for my final thoughts. This is definitely the most engaging song on the whole album so far. They actually did something different. It’s still not good to me at all, but it feels like a different song. It feels like they put effort into this track. I actually think this track is well done. It ends pretty abruptly, and I wouldn’t ever listen to it ever again, but it’s way better than anything else on this album. 3/5\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nOh my God, it’s finally over. Nah. This album is fucking awful. I don’t think anyone expected me to enjoy this shit tho. If you regularly read my shit I don’t think you’re surprised that I didn’t like this. This isn’t for me. I can enjoy music like this when it’s well done tho. I’ve enjoyed Juicy J’s work before. I’ve enjoyed Wiz Khalifa’s work before. I’ve even enjoyed TM88’s work before. I think. That may not actually be true. I can’t think of any songs that I like that are produced by TM88 off the top of my head. I’m sure I’ve heard a good TM88 beat before. This album isn’t good tho. It’s just not. I don’t even think Juicy J fans would think that this is a good album. This album feels like a mixtape. It feels like a collection of unreleased Juicy J songs that just happened to be produced by TM88 that he was gonna throw together for a mixtape, but he wanted to make money off of it, so he tacked on a single, half assed Wiz Khalifa verse to every track and called it an album. There’s absolutely no focus, no cohesion, and no substance. I don’t think any of those things are really to be expected from a Juicy J album tho. I’m not super familiar with all of his work, but it’s hard for me to imagine an album from him that DOES have a focus, cohesion, and substance. This whole album just feels like a cheap distraction for fans of Juicy J. He even takes the last quarter of the final track to just shamelessly promote upcoming projects from himself and other Taylor Gang artists. So yeah. This isn’t a good album. If you’re a big fan of Juicy J or Wiz Khalifa I guess you should skim it and see if anything catches your ear. I personally think that this is one of the worst albums I’ve heard all year tho. This shit is wack to me.\n\nFavorite Song: Cell Ready\n\nLeast Favorite Song: She In Love\n\nVerdict:\n\n38%\n\nTell me if I’m trippin’ in the comments below\n\nIf you enjoyed this article share it on Twitter & Facebook"
