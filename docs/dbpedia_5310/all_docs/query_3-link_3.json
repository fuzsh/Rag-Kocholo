At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66, based on 10 reviews.[71] Al Shipley of the Baltimore City Paper gave the album a positive review, saying \"Stay Trippy winds up as something of a triumph, one of the year's most thoroughly enjoyable major label albums.\"[82] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \"Fans will need four or five hands to count all the other laugh-out-loud punch lines, and even if this album is redundant and overstuffed with hedonism and recklessness, that's just Juicy being Juicy.\"[72] Rick Florino of Artistdirect stated, \"Stay Trippy is as wild as modern hip-hop gets. It's a slick, seductive, and stone romp through a hazy synth boom, strip club-ready beats, and some of Juicy J's tightest rapping to date.\"[73] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying \"Despite the wild assortment of flows and flavors, Juicy J manages to avoid being eclipsed on his own project. Their presence only amplifies the quality of his offering, a hypothesis that is reinforced by three of the album's standout pieces.\"[83] B.J. Steiner of XXL said, \"Stay Trippy is a record that knows to stay within the lane that it's carved for itself. Big-budget stripper rap has rarely sounded so fresh.\"[81] Nick Henderson of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"On Stay Trippy, Juicy J sounds as energized, self-assured, and dangerous as ever.\"[84] Patrick Taylor of RapReviews.com stated, \"Even if Juicy J's brand of explicit hip-hop isn't your cup of syrup, you have to admire the man for staying relevant and good as he nears his third decade in the game.\"[78]\n\nChris Kelly of Fact said, \"By embracing the codeine-weed-molly trifecta, hashtag-friendly hooks, and â€” perhaps most significantly â€” ascendant producers, the 38-year-old rapper has maintained rap relevance, even as that has become more difficult than ever.\"[75] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, \"For all its vulgarity, predictability, repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs, Juicy J's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit.\"[74] Julia LeConte of Now said, \"The whole thing isn't about disrespecting women, though. Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple-pleasure narratives: popping molly, making money. On his third solo record, the Three 6 Mafia rapper signed to Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang is 'getting high like he's 18.' At 38, though, it's not super-amusing, like J is the hip-hop Peter Pan refusing to grow up among a crew of younger emcees.\"[77] Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated, \"Stay Trippy can be musically compelling. Granted, the words are hard to miss. \"Stay motivated, stay high, stay hustling, (forget) everything else,\" he intones on \"So Much Money\", a title that sums up the highest virtue in J's world.\"[80] David \"Rek\" Lee of HipHopDX said, \"Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word. Then there are songs that are meant to be played loud in public settings, and the lyrics don't matter so much. If you haven't already figured it out, Stay Trippy is the latter. And for as much flack as it receives, there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the 'trippy' lifestyle.\"[76]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nStay Trippy was ranked number 20 on Spin's list of the 40 best hip hop albums of 2013. They commented saying, \"this is basically what the Juiceman's been doing for 20 years â€” self-producing albums of bellowing bass, eerie synths, and shouted slogans. It helps that his sound helped spawn wildly popular things like Atlanta trap and Chicago drill; it helps that Wiz Khalifa helped him acquire the budget to get an absolutely monstrous low end; and it helps that we're not sick of \"Bandz a Make Her Dance.\"[85] It was also positioned at number 27 on Complex's list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They said, \"armed with an endless barrage of rattling beats, and a host of just-so-over-the-top-ridiculous-you-have-to-laugh punchlines, and enough believable gangsta talk to separate himself from the good kids of today's rap scene, Stay Trippy is the perfect explanation for why Juicy has been rich since the '90s.\"[86] XXL ranked it at number 13 on their list of the best albums of 2014.[87]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Stay Trippy.[88]\n\nNotes\n\n^[a] signifies a co-producer\n\nSample credits\n\n\"Smokin' Rollin'\" samples \"High For This\" performed by The Weeknd.\n\n\"Wax\" samples \"I Get High (On Your Memory)\" performed by Freda Payne.\n\n\"One Thousand\" samples \"Just Like That\" performed by Toots and the Maytals.\n\n\"Having Sex\" samples \"If You Believe In Sex\" performed by 2 Live Crew.\n\nChart positions\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format Label Australia[32] August 23, 2013 Digital download Kemosabe, Columbia Canada[97] France[98] Germany[99] New Zealand[100] Spain[101][102] CD, digital download Sony United Kingdom[103] Digital download Kemosabe, Columbia United Kingdom[104] August 27, 2013 CD United States[105][106] CD, digital download Kemosabe, Columbia"
