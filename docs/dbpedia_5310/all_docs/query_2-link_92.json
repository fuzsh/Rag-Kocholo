        "text": "What is your favorite quote about America?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I’m not sure I have one...\n\nWhat three words define the States today?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I don’t know.\n\nWhich living American do you most admire and why?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I just admire anybody who’s working and doesn’t have everything right there in front of them, but is making their own way. Those are the people I respect and admire in America.\n\nWhich living American do you most despise and why?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I don’t despise anybody.\n\nWho gave you your first break? Do you still talk?\n\nWiz Khalifa: Nobody gave me my first big break.\n\nWhen and where are you the most happiest?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I’m the most happiest when I’m with my son or when I’m in the studio just creating and vibing...coming up with new ideas.\n\nWhat high school clique were you in? Do you stay in touch?\n\nWiz Khalifa: \"Weirdo clique\". Yeah I still talk to them.\n\nWhat food reminds you of home?\n\nWiz Khalifa: Well there’s certain food that you can only get at home, and then there’s the food that reminds me of home. I would probably say like a gyro.\n\nWhat smell do you associate with the city of your birth?\n\nWiz Khalifa: I don’t remember the city of my birth that much. I wasn’t born in Pittsburgh, but a smell that reminds me of the city of Pittsburgh is the smell of rivers.\n\nWhat's the best road trip you've ever been on?\n\nWiz Khalifa: Probably camping with my parents.\n\nWhere did you lose your virginity?\n\nWiz Khalifa: In my teens. In a bed.\n\nWhat would make you leave America forever?\n\nWiz Khalifa: If we were threatened by war. Like if they said, \"We’re gonna take over your whole country,” I would just get out and go to Australia or something.\n\nWhat noise reminds you of the States?\n\nWiz Khalifa: People laughing.\n\nWhat is your favorite American building?\n\nWiz Khalifa: The Rock n’ Roll Hall Of Fame!\n\nUltimate American film?\n\nWiz Khalifa: Pulp Fiction."
