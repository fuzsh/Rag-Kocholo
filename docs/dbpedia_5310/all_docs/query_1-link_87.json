Juicy J links with Wiz Khalifa and Rock City on his latest song “For Everybody.” The Memphis rapper calls out the thots who mess with Drake (“I ain’t surprised / All these hos fu**in’ with Drake”), while Wiz raps about his ex-wife Amber Rose.\n\n“I fell in love with a stripper / Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker,” he raps (ouch!).\n\nJuicy’s album The Hustle Continues is due this summer."
