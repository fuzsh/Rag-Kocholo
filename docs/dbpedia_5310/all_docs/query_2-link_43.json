        "text": "Cannabis icon Wiz Khalifa’s weed brand Khalifa Kush launched in California this year to adoring fans. As long as the Grammy and Golden Globe-nominated rapper has been creating music, he’s been advocating for cannabis.\n\nThe brand launched in California through an exclusive partnership with Cookies. That’s because Khalifa and Cookies’ founder Berner go way back. The duo have been working together since 2010. Founded in 2016, the Khalifa Kush product lineup today includes flower, pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, and concentrates. It’s on shelves in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Khalifa Kush evolved into its own lifestyle brand, offering hoodies and hype-worthy apparel with stoney, psychedelic sentiments like “Stay Positive and Stoned,” and “Smoke Better Weed.”\n\nKhalifa says the brand will be expanding across the country in 2022. Khalifa Kush will be officially on shelves in Florida next with an exclusive partnership with Trulieve Cannabis Co. Beginning this summer, consumers can expect Khalifa Kush on shelves at Trulieve medical dispensaries across Florida. Khalifa says he plans to launch in Pennsylvania and Michigan later this year.\n\nThe rapper’s entertainment label Taylor Gang—which boasts talent including Ty Dolla $ign, Juicy J, Project Pat, and Chevy Woods— also recently announced a partnership with Stündenglass. It’s a unique smoking device called a “gravity infuser,” an innovative and elegant reimagining of the gravity bong. The limited-edition Taylor Gang x Stündenglass comes in black and gold and costs $599.95.\n\nI recently spoke with Khalifa on weed’s intersection with creativity, how his collaboration with Berner came to be, and advice that other business entrepreneurs can take away from his lifelong work in the cannabis, fashion, and music industries.\n\nCongrats on the Khalifa Kush California launch. How does it feel to be selling your brand now closer to home?\n\nWiz Khalifa: It feels really good. I’ve been working on this brand for a long time. To finally have it in stores and be available to people is really dope.\n\nIt was crazy, there was a line was around the corner. Everybody really, really enjoyed the actual product. To be out there and connect with the fans and to meet them, it was just cool.\n\nAre there any new markets you’ll be launching the brand in this year that you can hint to for the Forbes readers?\n\nYeah, actually California is our first launch. By the summertime, we’re going to be launching in Michigan, we’re going to be launching in Pennsylvania, and Florida as well. We’re just looking forward to expanding as time goes on.\n\nFlorida’s medical market is huge.\n\nIt really is.\n\nWhat’s your relationship with Berner and the Cookies family like? When did you start smoking together, collaborating?\n\nMe and Berner met maybe like ten years ago, that’s when we started smoking together. He established the Cookies brand, put together the whole team. At that point he was just comin’ up, working at the shops he was really popular at. I was just kinda getting a name in music around the same time. We started connecting, building our brands together. He brought me the Khalifa Kush strain all the way back then. Now he’s built his brand not just in America but around the world.\n\nWhat strain are you smoking now? Of the Khalifa Kush lineup, do you have a favorite at the moment?\n\nKhalifa Kush is definitely still my favorite strain, especially throughout this whole project. We’ve gone through a lot of testing and naming of different strains. But I always end up going back to Khalifa Kush, it’s just my favorite one, it feels the best. It gets me the highest, it’s a clean high.\n\nIs it a strain that helps you with creativity and in the studio?\n\nDefinitely. I like the Khalifa Kush effects, I can’t have anything that’s going make me too sleepy, or make me not want to work. KK not only takes my mind away from thinking too much or not thinking enough, but you know, I can continue to smoke it without passing out or getting too tired.\n\nYour new single dropped, Backseat with Juicy J. This collab album you created together sounds so unique, what is the concept behind it?\n\nThe albums called Stoner’s Night, it’s really something we had a concept for for a long time. Anytime we meet up, it’s stoner’s night. He brings the best of his best, and I bring my best as well, and we get stoned. That’s pretty much what we did for the album, too. He brought in a lot of songs he wrote, I brought a lot of songs that I wrote. And we mixed them together, we made the best collaboration. It’s like a hybrid, a mix of the best weed in the world.\n\nI see you’re on the lineup for The Smoker’s Club fest in April. How does it feel to be back on stage performing after the last few years paused the live music industry?\n\nIt feels really good, I love being on stage, I love performing. Especially the fact that I’m planning on dropping a lot of new music this year, more than I have in a while, and I’ll be on the road.\n\nWhat plans do you have for April 20 this year?\n\nI’m thinking, dropping the album, maybe doing a show. Getting the whole world high at the same time.\n\nWhat advice do you have for a budding weed entrepreneur who may look up to your brand and your company?\n\nAnybody who looks up to my brand or Khalifa Kush, I’d tell them it’s all about building your team. You’ve got to establish those key players on your team, and get out there and do what you’re best at doing. The more you know, the more you grow.\n\nYour Wiz Weed Farm game looks so dope and surreal. Are you trying to enter more digital realms like the NFT/metaverse spaces?\n\nYeah, definitely. I released my first NFT collection late last year, and it did really well. As NFTs start to grow and become more popular, we’re definitely going to explore more in that space. In the metaverse as well. There are a lot of things going on and there are a lot of places that my brand could exist over there. As things grow, we’re just going to keep looking into it.\n\nWhere do you see the cannabis industry in 5 years from now? National, international?\n\n5 years from now, it’s hard to gauge where it will be. I definitely feel like it will be much more open to the public, for people who just want to experience it. Even if you’re not going to be a returning smoker, you should still be able to experience it however you want to. I see more countries being more lenient on pot, and I see different ways of people enjoying it. Who knows, we might have a super strain by then. That’s a possibility as well."
