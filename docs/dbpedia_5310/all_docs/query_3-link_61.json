        "text": "Legendary rapper, producer, entrepreneur, and Academy Award winner Juicy J has a new collaborative album out today via Trippy Music with super-producer and artist Pi’erre Bourne. Space Age Pimpin was executive produced by Juicy J and shows two worlds coming together with the high energy Southern grit of J colliding with the new age melodic trap sound Bourne helped shape since his arrival into the industry.\n\nSpace Age Pimpin boasts the first single they dropped called “This Fronto” which got acclaim from Pitchfork, The Fader, Stereogum, Complex, Hypebeast, Uproxx, Paste Magazine, and many more. It’s been nonstop hard work for J, from performing a classic Verzuz battle and performing many sold out shows (alongside Three 6 Mafia) to dropping a collaborative album called Stoner’s Night with Wiz Khalifa to recent production credits Drake’s newest Honestly, Nevermind album (“Jimmy Cooks”)."
