        "text": "Wiz Khalifa was charged with illegal drug possession after using marijuana while performing at the Beach Please! Festival in Romania on Saturday night.\n\n“The prosecutors of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism – Constanța Territorial Service ordered the initiation of criminal proceedings against a defendant (US citizen), investigated for the crime of unlawful possession of drugs risk,” Romanian anti-organized crime prosecutors DIICOT said in a press release Sunday.\n\n“During a recital held during a music festival held in the resort of Costinești, Constanța county, [Khalifa] possessed over 18 grams of cannabis (risk drug) and consumed (on stage) another amount of cannabis under the shape of a craft cigarette.”\n\nBarron’s reports the 10-time Grammy nominee and others were taken in for questioning early Sunday. Khalifa was charged, but released from custody.\n\nA video posted online also shows the rapper being escorted from the festival grounds surrounded by a group of Romanian police officers.\n\nPossession of marijuana in Romania can be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nKhalifa — real name Cameron Jibril Thomaz — posted on X say that he did not “mean any disrespect” to the country of Romania by “lighting up on stage.”\n\n“They were very respectful and let me go. I’ll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time,” he added."
