        "text": "Wiz Khalifa definitely does not need an introduction. Absolutely everyone knows his music career and along with that, his close link with the world of cannabis.\n\nAs a good businessman, Wiz did not miss the opportunity to enter the recent and booming cannabis market, raiding several ventures related to cannabis.\n\nThe various raids that the rapper had in the world of cannabis caused his name to reach the market and immortalized its presence on it; Being already immortalized in the music market, always with a narrow connection between his music and marijuana.\n\nSo What We Smoke Weed?\n\nFrom early in his career Wiz always showed himself in favor of cannabis use, being this, a very recursive theme in his projects. Such as \"Rolling papers\", \"Young wild & free\", \"Medicated\", “Kush & Orange Juice” and much more.\n\nAlways from a combative and respectful side, he knew how to move the public perception of cannabis. Without a doubt, he contributed culturally to reach the point where cannabis is today, with very high levels of acceptance and a much more decriminalized perception.\n\nIn 2010, on an interview, Wiz told MTV \"I thought weed was bad for a minute,\" and continued \"When I was younger, I thought it was bad, but I got to a point where it worked for me. It don't work for everybody else. People gotta stay free, people need jobs”...\"Definitely, legalize it. Please, everybody needs it. The world would be a better place.”\n\nSee Also: Chelsea Handler: From Canna-Loving Comedian To Activist\n\nLuckily, the rapper not only predicted the legalization of cannabis but also the market gave him part of the jobs he was requesting for the people as the Cannabis Market is one of the markets that more jobs are generating.\n\nWiz Khalifa Rolling Papers\n\nIn 2014, the musician associated with RAW, one of the main rolling paper brands in order to present an entire line of rolling products.\n\n\"I'm really excited to have my own line of papers with Raw. I've been using the product for years and it only felt right to make this happen with them,\" Wiz expressed when announcing this venture.\n\nKhalifa Kush Enterprise\n\nThe world-wide known rapper announced in 2015, the foundation of Khalifa Kush Enterprise, launching its own strain brand, a rare phenotype of the OG Kush. Making it available in market with two main associations.\n\nRiverRock Cannabis\n\nPittsburgh Rapper in 2016 announced a new partnership with RiverRock Cannabis. Producing an exclusive entire line of cannabis products including Khalifa-curated strains, infused products, and concentrates. Finally making available its signed Khalifa OG Strain present in the US market.\n\n“These products have taken years to perfect,” Wiz said in a release. “I’m really excited to finally share them with the public and to work with RiverRock to raise awareness and end cannabis prohibition nationwide.”\n\nSupreme Cannabis\n\nLater on, in 2018 he announced the association with Supreme Cannabis (OTC: SPRWF) to make available in the Canadian market its Khalifa Kush Strain. The product lineup includes pre-rolls, extracts, capsules and cannabis oils.\n\nSee Also: Seth Rogen And Evan Goldberg's Weed Brand Is Not Only Beautiful, But Also Committed To Social Justice\n\n\"I'm excited to bring our first products to Canada and launch KKE Oils.

The App is titled “Wiz Khalifa’s Weed Farm” and was developed by the artist and a game studio called Metamoki. The app is intended to give digital weed growers an idea of how the cannabis business is developing.\n\nSee Also: What You Need To Know About Whoopi Goldberg's Cannabis Ventures\n\nAbout Benzinga Events: The Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference series is held throughout the year in North American cities.
