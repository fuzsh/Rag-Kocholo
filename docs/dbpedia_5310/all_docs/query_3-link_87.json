        "text": "Well, it finally happened. Fourteen weeks into its run, just a scant few weeks from breaking a record held for nearly twenty years, it was unseated by a dark horse soundtrack hit by a subpar rapper and a YouTuber that nobody could have seen coming. Yes, the rest of the week happened and gave me a fair amount to actually talk about, but in a rare occurence on this show, it actually looks like our Top Ten might be more interesting - because this week, 'Uptown Funk' by Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars lost the #1 slot.\n\nSo let's talk about that major shift, shall we? Our new #1 is 'See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth and in retrospect, I shouldn't be as surprised as I kind of am that this got big. Wiz Khalifa has been at the top before, he's riding the wave of Furious 7's tremendous success, 'Let It Go' last year proved that soundtrack hits have viability, and Paul Walker's tragic death gave the song some real emotive presence - it's basically this year's version of 'Candle In The Wind 1997' by Elton John. The fact that like that song, it happens to be a good song helps matters - but unlike that song, there is an open question how long it'll last. This week it rode monstrous sales and huge streaming to the top, buoyed by a strong YouTube presence, but how long that lasts becomes the big question - those sorts of sales bursts rarely hold for multiple weeks, and the question becomes whether airplay can keep up. Because let's face facts, 'Uptown Funk' still has a ton of airplay and unlike most long-time hits, it's not dropping as quickly as expected. Sure, it's no longer dominant in streaming, but it still has the top YouTube slot - if 'See You Again' slips, and I'd argue it might, 'Uptown Funk' has a shot at going back to #1 and still challenging the record. Yes, it'd be non-consecutive and purists will take issue with this, but I'd argue it's still relevant.\n\nThat is, of course, if 'Uptown Funk' can stop any competition from slipping in. 'Sugar' by Maroon 5 seems the first contender by sales and airplay position, holding to #3, but it seems like airplay has finally stalled out and it slipped on streaming and YouTube this week. Next up is a more serious contender with 'Trap Queen' by Fetty Wap rising again to #4 - sure as hell higher than I ever would have expected, with stronger sales and huge streaming, but it doesn't have a lot of YouTube and even with slow gains on airplay, will it be enough? 'Thinking Out Loud' by Ed Sheeran at #5 is out of the question at this point - losing in all categories except for decent streaming numbers, but I don't see a recovery here. Well, what about 'Earned It' by The Weeknd at #6, which somehow is still gaining a ton of airplay... but the sales numbers are not impressive and streaming looks shaky as well. 'Love Me Like You Do' by Ellie Goulding would have been a contender, but it did not have a good week, with radio slowing, dips in streaming, and surprisingly weak sales - it may have hit its peak here. So what about 'G.D.F.R.' by Flo Rida, Sage The Gemini, and Lookas at #8? Well, I'm honestly a little unsure about this one - good sales and airplay, sure, but streaming is shaky and the lack of real YouTube might not give it enough of a push to really make it. Now on to the contender that I want to see make it, and our new arrival to the Top 10 at #9 - 'Shut Up And Dance' by Walk The Moon! Yes, we've got an indie rock song in the Top 10 again, and yes, it's awesome. And it's also surprisingly healthy across the board - strong sales, gains in airplay, and even starting to pick up some streaming. Yeah, it's not doing great on YouTube, but I can hold out some degree of hope. The last on our list is 'Style' by Taylor Swift, which is holding onto #10 thanks to airplay and little else.\n\nMoving away from all that craziness and excitement, let's move onto the exact opposite - losers and dropouts. The latter category is pretty much all tracks that were on their way out anyways - 'Apparently' by J.Cole, 'I See You' by Luke Bryan, 'I Bet My Life' by Imagine Dragons, 'She Knows' by Ne-Yo & Juicy J, 'Night Changes' by One Direction, 'Animals' by Maroon 5, and - most pleasing of all - 'Coco' by O.T. Genasis. It doesn't help me much - 'Coco' still likely lasted long enough to land on the year-end list, but at least I'm not seeing it now. And in a nice change of pace, we didn't get a lot of big losers this week either. 'Homegrown Honey' by Darius Rucker drops to #81 - odd, considering his album just dropped, guess everyone else ignored it as hard as I did - and 'Lonely Eyes' by Chris Young, both of which are just losing steam naturally. And then there's 'Outside' by Calvin Harris ft. Ellie Goulding, and actually liking that song, it's a little frustrating to see it slip to #46... but then again, it's oscillated all around the charts, so I have no idea where it's going to land.\n\nBut where the majority of the action was this week was in our gains, most of which were simply following in the path of previous boosts. 'Dear Future Husband' by Meghan Trainor continuing its regrettable rise to 26 is thankfully balanced out by 'Honey I'm Good' by Andy Grammer maintaining its steady boosts to 34. In particular electronic music had strong gains this week - 'Where Are U Now' by Skrillex, Diplo, and Justin Bieber rose to 42, 'Get Low' by Dillon Francis & DJ Snake rose to 61 off its debut last week, and 'You Know You Like It' by DJ Snake & AlunaGeorge continued its rise to 67. Hell, even 'Hey Mama' by David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, and AfroJack rose up to 44. Outside of that... well, Kanye West's 'All Day' with Theophilius London, Allan Kingdom and Paul McCartney went up to 52 - probably will gain more with that Kendrick Lamar remix going around - 'Bright' by Echosmith got a boost to 76, and for some ungodly reason, 'Commas' by Future went up to 79, because apparently our charts needed more badly written and generically made hip-hop tracks.\n\nWant proof? Let's take a look at our one returning entry, shall we?"
