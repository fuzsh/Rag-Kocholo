        "text": "On July 14, local prosecutors claimed the rapper was smoking cannabis onstage during his headlining set at a festival in Costinesti\n\nWiz Khalifa has addressed his illegal drug possession charge in Romania.\n\nOn Sunday, July 14, the rapper (whose real is name Cameron Thomaz), 36, issued an apology on X (formerly known as Twitter) explaining he \"didn't mean any disrespect\" by smoking marijuana onstage during his headlining set at the \"Beach, Please!\" festival held in Costinesti.\n\n\"Last nights show was amazing,\" Khalifa wrote. \"I didn’t mean any disrespect to the country of Romania by lighting up on stage. They were very respectful and let me go. I’ll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\"\n\nRelated: Wiz Khalifa Charged with Illegal Drug Possession in Romania\n\nAccording to reports from French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP), authorities allegedly found cannabis in the rapper/actor's possession in the early hours of Sunday, said prosecutors.\n\nUnder Romanian law, cannabis is considered a \"risk drug,\" and if Khalifa is convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison, according to the outlet.\n\nIn a statement to the French outlet on Sunday, the Romanian anti-organized crime prosecutors organization DIICOT said that the \"See You Again\" rapper smoked cannabis onstage during his set.\n\n\"During a performance at a music festival held in the resort of Costinesti, the accused was found to have possessed more than 18 grams of cannabis and to have consumed (onstage) another quantity in the form of a handmade cigarette,\" they said in its statement.\n\nA source who spoke with the outlet also claimed that Khalifa was questioned by local authorities on Sunday alongside several others.\n\nAlthough he was charged, he was released soon after.\n\nAFTP reported that the investigation is ongoing.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Amber Rose and Wiz Khalifa Reunite for Son Sebastian's Elementary School Graduation: 'Our Baby Is Growing Up'\n\nMuch of Khalifa's image has been centered around cannabis.\n\nThroughout his songs, he's often discussed smoking and even joked that he has attended his son's parent-teacher conferences high in an episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast earlier this year.\n\n\"Hell yeah. I'm pulling up stoned. They expect it,\" Khalifa told host Alex Cooper. \"They know what's up. It's not like back in the day [where] you're considered a bad parent if you smoke weed. I'm pretty sure my son smells like weed. I don't know because I can't smell it but I'm pretty sure he smells like pot.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
